Chapter 5812: The Divine Deer Recovers

Chu Feng stowed away the bead, knowing it was a rare treasure that could help those whose cultivation had been crippled. Jia Lingyi was able to recover so well even though he had thoroughly crippled her back then; it would surely work well on Bai Yunqing too.

“I was wrong, Chu Feng,” Jia Lingyi said. “I regret everything I have done. I never thought a decision I made back then would land me in this plight. If I could do things over, I would have never harmed your grandmother and her family. I know I deserve death, but please spare our Pill Dao Immortal Sect. I’m begging you!”

Jia Lingyi, despite her weakness, climbed to her knees and kowtowed to Chu Feng and the other prodigies. She realized that she had been cornered.

She still couldn’t understand why so many prodigies had decided to side with Chu Feng, but without a doubt, her Pill Dao Immortal Sect didn’t have the strength to go against Chu Feng anymore.

“Jia Lingyi, are you trying to trade your life to save your Pill Dao Immortal Sect? I’ll tell you upfront that's impossible. I can take your life right now, but I’ll let you live. I want you to live in pain and agony, as you witness the death of your Pill Dao Immortal Sectmembers one by one,” Chu Feng said.

“Chu Feng, my crimes shouldn’t implicate my family members! Please, spare my Pill Dao Immortal Sect. I’m begging you here!” Jia Lingyi cried as she crawled up to Chu Feng.

Jiang Jingyu and the others were taken aback by the sight. The Jia Lingyi they knew was a lofty and dazzling person, but who could have thought she would be reduced to this state?

Jia Lingyi was someone with a backbone. Back then, the Totem Dragon clan had tortured her to make her rat out the Totem Dragon Clansmen who had colluded with her, but she kept silent and didn’t say a word at all. She must have known about Long Lin by then, but she refused to say a word because she knew the Pill Dao Immortal Sect would be ruined if she revealed it.

As evil as she was, she truly loved the Pill Dao Immortal Sect... just that her love was none of Chu Feng’s business.

Before Jia Lingyi’s hand could reach Chu Feng’s thigh, he kicked her in the face and sent her tumbling over the desert.

“To think you dare utter such words. Even if not for you, your Pill Dao Immortal Sect doesn’t deserve to exist in this world. It has committed far too many atrocities,” Chu Feng spoke with not killing intent but determination.

He had already made up his mind to destroy the Pill Dao Immortal Sect.

Jia Lingyi turned to Long Chengyu and Long Muxi, and she could see the coldness in their eyes. This made her realize there was no way to save her sect anymore.

Thus, her eyes hardened in determination.

Gah!

Jia Lingyi cried in excruciating pain, as the final sliver of her life force flowed from her. At the same time, her body glowed brilliantly, and powerful teleportation energy manifested from her body. She was planning to escape!

Chu Feng quickly constructed a sealing formation to stop her, but the teleportation energy was too strong. Jia Lingyi vanished in the blink of an eye.

“She got away? She actually had such a formidable treasure with her?”

The prodigies were taken aback too. They didn’t think Jia Lingyi would have such a powerful treasure with her.

“The Pill Dao Immortal Sect is a world spiritist sect with a long lineage. They have been to plenty of ancient remnants, so it’s not surprising for them to have such treasures. However, she has ignited her remaining life force earlier. Not even the most potent treasure in the world can heal her spirit power. She might have escaped, but she’s crippled for good,” Ling Xiao said.

“No wonder she didn’t use it right away. She had to pay a heavy price to invoke it. What’s the point of escaping if she has to pay such a heavy price for it?” Qin Xuan was confused.

“S-s-she might have thought she would be t-t-tortured if she stays here,” Wang Qiang guessed.

“That’s true,” Qin Xuan said.

Chu Feng thought Ling Xiao’s words made sense. He had inspected Jia Lingyi’s body with his psyche earlier when he stabbed her dantian to check her treasures, and that was how he had found the bead. He didn’t find anything else earlier, which was why he got complacent.

Jia Lingyi must have used a one-time-use treasure, and it was likely to be a powerful one if it could escape Chu Feng’s detection. It was a pity, as that treasure would have likely been useful to him too.

“Chu Feng, I have recovered,” a familiar voice suddenly echoed. It was the Divine Deer.

This was good news. The Divine Deer had the ability to pass through formations, and it would be a reliable escape means in times of danger. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“I understand, elder,” Chu Feng replied before turning to Qin Xuan and the others.

He hadn’t intended to kill Jia Lingyi, as the latter didn’t have the power to raise any more storms. He wanted Jia Lingyi to witness the destruction of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect and experience the pain of watching her clansmen killed. It was just that he didn’t have the power to do so yet, so he could only keep her alive for the time being.

That being said, he was planning to keep her under control and release her only after they left.

Who could have thought that Jia Lingyi had such a formidable means of escape? While she paid a heavy price for it, she did manage to slip away.

Chu Feng didn’t mind it, but he was worried it would affect his companions. Thus, he turned to the others and asked, “Do you really not mind her revealing that she encountered us?”

“Big brother, let her speak all she wants. I doubt she’d dare let it slip. I have no fear even if she does. I’ll eradicate her Pill Dao Immortal Sect if she dares to say anything!” Little Fishy said.

“Miss Yu’er is right. She wouldn’t dare to say anything, or else it would only bring trouble upon her and the Pill Dao Immortal Sect,” Qin Xuan said. He even turned to Jiang Jingyu and said, “You’re free to speak of this if you wish to.”

Jiang Jingyu and the others immediately shook their heads and replied, “Rest assured, young master Qin Xuan. We won’t tell anyone about our encounter here today!”

Qin Xuan revealed a satisfied smile. He walked over to Chu Feng’s side, patted his shoulder, and said, “Let’s go. Don’t be too bothered by small fry. We should focus on what’s important.”

Neither Qin Xuan nor the other prodigies were bothered by Jia Lingyi’s escape. Their backgrounds were strong enough to bear the repercussions.

“Let’s go,” Chu Feng said as he began making their way toward the third remnant.

“Wait a moment, young hero Chu Feng,” Jiang Jingyu suddenly spoke up.
