Chapter 5684: Don’t Think About Leaving Till You Fail

Chu Feng halted his footsteps, turned to Ling Xinian, and asked via voice transmission, “Big sister Xinian, did I put you in a spot by clearing the Seven Stars Gravity Towers?”

“Little brother Chu Feng, I don’t mean to blame you, but… Your accomplishment here will leave some in our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion feeling embarrassed. That might draw unnecessary hostility to you. Why don’t you take on the Seven Realms Challenge Formation and intentionally fail? That’ll placate them at least placate them. It’ll help you,” Ling Xinian said.

“All right. I’ll do it since big sister Xinian has spoken up,” Chu Feng replied. He turned to the red-haired man and asked, “Where’s the Seven Realms Challenge Formation?”

“Looks like you aren’t as spineless as I thought. Let’s go. Let me see if you’re really as formidable as you seem,” the red-haired man said as he rose into the air and led the way.

Chu Feng followed him.

In truth, there was no way to peacefully resolve the situation. These people were forcing him to challenge another formation even though he had already intentionally feigned weakness…

Their stance couldn’t be clearer.

Furthermore, there was not a single person present who stopped the red-haired man, including the Saint-tier elder, despite his horrible attitude. This signified that his will represented them too. They wanted to salvage their reputation, even if they had to resort to despicable means.

What else could Chu Feng do?

There was no way they would allow him to safely leave the place unless he failed a challenge.

Soon, they arrived at the Seven Realms Challenge Formation.

Along the way, Ling Xinian filled Chu Feng in with the details about the Seven Realms Challenge Formation via voice transmission. It was a talent assessment formation based on the natures of the Seven Spirit Worlds, and it had been around since the establishment of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.

It was no simple talent assessment. It also tested one’s control of their psyche. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Those who could clear a single trial of the challenge were already considered prodigies, though the juniors who were qualified to enter the Sacred Mansion would have been at least at this level.

Take Ling Yunhao for example, he had cleared two trials of the challenge. Ling Yunxi and Jie Feng had cleared three trials of the challenge.

However, there was hardly anyone who had cleared four trials of the challenge. As for clearing five trials, only five people in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion had succeeded in doing so thus far.

In the current generation of juniors, only Ling Xiao and Ling Sheng’er had accomplished this feat.

As for clearing six trials, there was only one person who had ever accomplished it, and she was Jie Ranqing.

However, that wasn’t Jie Ranqing’s limit. In fact, she had cleared all seven trials of the challenge, and she was the only one in the long history of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion to have achieved this feat.

…

The Seven Realms Challenge Formation looked much more impressive compared to the Seven Stars Gravity Towers. Seven different sculptures surrounded the formation in a circle, and each of them stood at a height of over ten thousand meters. These seven sculptures represented the Seven Spirit Worlds.

The formation was floating in mid-air, and it was constantly moving up and down.

According to Ling Xinian, the challenge would begin as soon as he stepped into the formation.

However, Chu Feng’s eyes were drawn to the deeper area of the Sacred Mansion, where he spotted ten lifelike sculptures that were around a thousand meters in height. These sculptures wore armor and wielded blades, looking like warriors.

The sculptures were nourished by a massive and incredibly powerful formation beneath them. This made Chu Feng realize that the sculptures weren’t as simple as they seemed.

“What’s that?” Chu Feng asked.

“Are you trying to stall for time?” the red-haired man scoffed.

“For what reason would I stall for time? Is there an ideal time to challenge the Seven Realms Challenge Formation?” Chu Feng retorted.

“Stop wasting time and enter the formation!” the red-haired man urged.

“I’ll challenge the formation whenever I want to. Can’t you tell that I’m in a weakened state? Don’t you think it’s inappropriate for you to urge me when I’m already weakened?” Chu Feng asked.

Those words were like thorns jabbing into the hearts of the crowd.

They had wanted to see Chu Feng fail and make a fool of himself, and they were willing to disadvantage him for that. It embarrassed them to have their shameful thoughts plainly pointed out like that.

“Just say so if you don’t dare to challenge the formation!” the infuriated red-haired man roared.

Instead of losing his temper, Chu Feng replied with a chuckle, “Your provocation is too cheap.”

It could have been because he wanted Chu Feng to quickly enter the formation, or that his conscience finally got the better of him, but the Saint-tier elder, Ling Mouzi, finally spoke up, “Young friend Chu Feng, those ten sculptures were left behind by one of our predecessors. We aren’t sure what it’s used for either.”

“May I know which predecessor it is?” Chu Feng asked.

“It’s the World Spiritist Immortal King,” Ling Mouzi replied.

“I see. That would explain it,” Chu Feng replied with a nod.

With his curiosity satisfied, he leaped into the Seven Realms Challenge Formation.

The seven sculptures shook ever so slightly before emanating a brilliant light. At the same time, the entire Seven Realms Challenge Formation glowed, indicating that it had been activated.

He realized that he could choose the trial he wanted to challenge by willing it, but instead of challenging them one by one, he grandly waved his sleeves.

All seven sculptures simultaneously cast a ray of light on Chu Feng.

“He’s challenging all seven trials at the same time?”

The crowd was stunned. Even Jie Ranqing had challenged the trials one at a time back then, but Chu Feng actually challenged all seven of them at once. He was clearly planning to fail!

“That child is too ambitious,” the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect’s Sectmaster remarked.

The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master turned around and headed off.

“You aren’t watching anymore?”

“He isn’t serious about challenging the formation. He’s just throwing a tantrum. What’s the point of watching on?”

“Indeed. I doubt that he’ll clear even a single trial.”

Unlike the Seven Stars Gravity Towers, the Seven Realms Challenge Formation was so famous that even the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect’s Sectmaster had heard about it. That was why he agreed that Chu Feng wasn’t seriously trying to clear the formation too.

“Mansion Master, wait for me!”

The Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect’s Sectmaster quickly chased after the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master, thinking that it was pointless to watch on too.
