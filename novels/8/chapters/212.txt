MGA: Chapter 213 - Void Zhenren

The Blade of the Void Dragon’s Cry was in the Void Tower.

However, starting from a thousand years ago and after the founder of the Void School, Void Zhenren, passed away with grudges, no one else in the Void School could grasp that martial skill anymore. In reality, no one even saw what the martial skill looked like.

With World Spiritist methods, Chu Feng went up and down the Void Tower, and searched back and forth many times. However, he could not find any traces of the Blade of the Void Dragon’s Cry. That made Chu Feng anxious.

Because, with the eyes of a World Spiritist, he could tell that the Void Tower was very special and he knew that there must be something hidden within the tower, and after hearing the school head’s words, Chu Feng felt that most likely, the thing that was hidden was the Blade of the Void Dragon’s Cry. However, in front of his eyes, Chu Feng could not find it even if it depended on his life, so naturally, it made him anxious.

After all, the Blade of the Void Dragon’s Cry was not a simple martial skill. It was created by a Heaven realm expert and it was a rank 7 martial skill that did not exist within the Azure Province. Also, it was not a simple rank 7 martial skill. It was a rank 7 martial skill that was infinitely near a rank 8 martial skill.

Of course, since Chu Feng knew that such a martial skill existed, he would want to get it within his hands because as long as he grasped that martial skill, undoubtedly, it would be one of the trump cards that could protect his life in the future.

Thinking to that point, Chu Feng searched in detail once again. But it was useless as after the whole night, he had no harvests. Not to mention the cultivation method of the Blade of the Void Dragon’s Cry, he could not even find a single strand of hair.

“Will I, Chu Feng, really have to miss such a good opportunity with the Blade of the Void Dragon’s Cry?” Chu Feng stood on top of the Void Tower, and as he looked at the faint light that came from the east, his heart was full of regret.

In that entire night, Chu Feng truly used everything he had and used every single method he could. So, the situation was already set. No matter how much more time Chu Feng spent to search, it would be for nothing.

Saying it with Eggy’s words, Chu Feng’s ability was not enough and his Spirit power was not sufficient, so he had no way of observing everything the Void Tower hid.

However, when Chu Feng’s Spirit power grew to the point in which he could see through the Void Tower, how great of a use would a rank 7 martial skill have to Chu Feng?

“You are not a disciple from the Void School.” Suddenly, an aged voice came from behind Chu Feng.

“Who?” After hearing that voice, Chu Feng was shocked. He first leaped forward, and only after dozens of meters did he turn around and sweep his gaze forward.

Although the gaze did not seem to be important, Chu Feng was instantly frightened because an aged old man who had white hair stood in front of him.

That old man was short and he had wrinkles all over his face. His appearance did not seem out of the ordinary, but his body emitted a special type of aura. It was an aura that belonged to those who cultivated to a certain realm.

The most important thing was that the old man’s body was translucent. It meant that he was not a complete life form but a consciousness. A consciousness that was able to avoid Chu Feng’s Spirit power.

“Chu Feng, careful. This is a consciousness from a Heaven realm expert. Although after being worn down for many years and it is extremely weak, it should not be underestimated.” Eggy nervously reminded.

“Senior, I wonder you are?” Chu Feng respectfully asked. Such a strong consciousness would not appear for no cause or reason at all, so immediately, Chu Feng associated him with a person. It was the founder of the Void School, Void Zhenren.

Although it was quite inconceivable for a Heaven realm consciousness to live for a thousand years, the only person Chu Feng could think of was that person.

“I never would have thought that after such a long time, a decently talented person finally came, yet was not part of my school. Ahh, whatever. Perhaps this is the will of the heavens.” The old man did not answer Chu Feng question. He only helplessly sighed, then said to Chu Feng,

“Boy, I’ll pass the cultivation method for the Blade of the Void Dragon’s Cry verbally down to you. As for how much you can remember and whether you succeed in cultivating it will all depend on your talent and luck.”

After that, the old man started to narrate the cultivation method to Chu Feng, and Chu Feng quickly listened to it seriously and diligently remembered everything with his heart, in his heart. The old man did not speak over a hundred phrases in total, but every single phrase was very fine and detailed. To completely understand it required extremely high comprehension power.

When the old man finished speaking, Chu Feng was incomparably joyful in his heart because he knew what the old man passed him down was undoubtedly the Blade of the Void Dragon’s Cry.

“Senior, thank you for passing your unique skill down to me!” After firmly memorizing the cultivation method in his heart, Chu Feng paid his respects to the old man.

“No need to thank me. I just don’t want my unique skill to be lost. Also, if you don’t have anything else, leave. Don’t disturb my peace again.” After speaking, the old man waved his sleeve and he disappeared without leaving any traces.

“Eggy, do you think the old man was Void Zhenren?” Chu Feng asked as he walked out of the Void Tower. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“It’s extremely likely that it is him.” Eggy replied.

“But didn’t you say that the period of existence for consciousness was limited, and Heaven realm consciousnesses could not live past a thousand years?” Chu Feng asked in confusion.

“That is indeed true, but there are always exceptions for everything. Although consciousnesses still grasp a certain amount of power, after all, they are virtual bodies. Perhaps through special treasures or methods, they can extend their period of life.”

“This Void Tower is quite special, and maybe because of that, it let Void Zhenren’s consciousness exist for a longer period of time.”

“However, I feel like the reason why Void Zhenren wants his own consciousness to exist is not only because he doesn’t want his unique skill to be lost. It is more because he’s thinking for himself.” Eggy said.

“Thinking for himself? What do you mean by that?” Chu Feng got more and more curious.

“When you knew about Void Zhenren, your first thought was to get his unique skill, the Blade of the Void Dragon’s Cry.”

“However, my first thought was to absorb the Source energy from his corpse. But just now, I dispelled that thought.” Eggy giggled and relied.

“You mean?” Chu Feng suddenly understood.

“That’s right. This Void Zhenren should be guarding his own corpse because he doesn’t want his Source energy to be taken away by World Spiritists after he died. So, with special methods, he let his own consciousness survive.”

“But looking at how he is, I’m guessing that he can’t go on for much longer. Within two years, he will certainly completely disappear. At that time, it would not be late for us to take away his Source energy.” Eggy evilly smiled and said.

“You little girl.” Chu Feng could only show helplessness after hearing Eggy’s thoughts.

Since he thought that the head of the Void School would certainly personally send him off as he left, after leaving the Void Tower, Chu Feng did not directly leave but return to his own resting palace.

“Why is he here? Was it discovered that I snuck into the Void Tower?”

However, before even nearing the palace, Chu Feng couldn’t help but be taken aback because with his Spirit power observations, the head of the Void School was currently standing at the entrance to his palace and he seemed rather anxious.
