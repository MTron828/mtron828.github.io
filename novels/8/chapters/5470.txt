Chapter 5470: You Aren’t Worthy

The light from the Myriad Treasures Dragon Exalted’s eyes had started fading, but its tightly-shut mouth slowly opened. A token filled with talismans dropped out and flew toward Chu Feng.

This token was crackling with golden lightning and red flames, and it harnessed the aura of the Ancient Era.

“The Lightning Flame Token?!”

The crowd recognized the token. It was a powerful offensive treasure that could immediately kill anyone beneath Half-God level, but it could only be used once. It was indeed a formidable treasure, but the crowd didn’t think that there was anything special about it.

After all, the Totem Dragon Clan had plenty of True God level cultivators.

Even though the Lightning Flame Token was rare and valuable, this was an outcome they could accept. In fact, they heaved a sigh of relief. They had thought that Chu Feng would obtain some kind of never-seen-before treasure, considering the huge phenomenon he had caused.

In contrast, Chu Feng looked overjoyed.

“He’s a countryside bumpkin, after all. Look at how happy he is.”

“It’s only normal. I reckon that he would have never seen such treasure if he never came to our Totem Dragon Clan. He got lucky.”

The Totem Dragon Clansmen secretly insulted Chu Feng in disdain. They only felt repulsion toward him because they felt like he was an outsider who had come here to steal their items.

As the barrier dissipated, Chu Feng carefully stowed away the Lightning Flame Token before descending over to Long Muxi’s side.

The two of them were just about to leave the area when Long Yuhong pointed her finger at Long Muxi and bellowed, “What’s with your gaze? Why are you acting so arrogant?”

Long Muxi coldly looked at Long Yuhong and asked, “Long Yuhong, are you trying to stir trouble?”

“Aren’t you the one stirring trouble here? Why did you bring an outsider here when you have already severed ties with our Totem Dragon Clan?” Long YUhong sneered.

Long Muxi’s eyes turned cold when she heard the word ‘outsider’. Her rank four Half-God level oppressive might gushed out with a ferocious beast to suppress Long Yuhong. Grandma Jin quickly stepped forward to protect Long Yuhong.

“Young miss Muxi has reached rank four Half-God level too?”

“That’s incredible! As expected of Young miss Muxi. She’s still catching up with her training despite having left the clan.”

The Totem Dragon Clansmen were impressed with Long Muxi even though her attack had been stopped by Grandma Jin. Unfortunately, their compliments only further displeased Long Yuhong.

“Long Muxi, are you going to make a move? I’m not afraid of you!” Long Yuhong scoffed, but her confidence was waning, evident from how she was subtly hiding behind Grandma Jin.

“Step aside, Grandma Jin,” Long Muxi ordered.

She had truly lost her anger. She was determined to teach Long Yuhong a lesson as soon as Grandma Jin stepped aside.

Long Yuhong panicked. She had only provoked Long Muxi because she thought that her cultivation had surpassed the latter, but she wasn’t confident of defeating her if they were in the same cultivation level. In fact, her recovered arm had started aching once more when she saw Long Muxi’s cold eyes…

She knew just how vicious Long Muxi could get.

“Stop hiding, Long Yuhong. Didn’t you want to fight me? I’m giving you a chance right now,” Long Muxi sneered.

Long Yuhong was so intimidated that she didn’t dare to talk back anymore. It was obvious who was in the stronger position here.

“Step aside, Grandma Jin. I’d like to see what Long Muxi can do to our Yuhong,” another voice echoed.

It was Long Yuhong’s mother, Long Huayue.

Long Yuhong quickly hid behind her mother’s back.

“Long Muxi, do you think that you are the lofty princess you used to be? Times have changed. You can’t bear the consequences for laying a finger on Yuhong,” Long Huayue said.

However, Long Muxi wasn’t intimidated in the least. “Is that so? Grandma Jin, step aside… I’d like to see what kind of consequences I won’t be able to bear.”

“Long Muxi, I know why you’re here. You don’t want to miss out on the treasures from the Armory Hall. I can’t stop you from entering the Armory Hall, but you can only access the main hall and not the side hall!” Long Hueyue said.

“Why would I enter the side hall?” Long Muxi asked.

It was a known fact that the good Divine Armaments were all in the main hall. There was no reason for her to enter the side hall.

Upon hearing that question, Long Huayue laughed in glee. “Just as I thought. You don’t know anything at all. I’ll enlighten you. Our Totem Dragon Clan has devoted our resources not to the Armory Hall’s main hall but the side hall. Lord Clan Chief has picked out six Divine Armaments and placed them in the side hall. There’s a good chance that those who enter the side hall will be able to tame the Divine Armaments, but only two people can do so. One slot goes to young master Long Chengyu, whereas the other belongs to my daughter, Long Yuhong!”

“Ah? There’s such a thing?”

Those words caused a stir amongst the crowd. Even Grandma Jin looked conflicted.

Should this news be true, it would mean that the Totem Dragon Clan intended to lower Long Muxi’s position and raise Long Yuhong’s standing. From this day on, it would be Long Yuhong and not Long Muxi who shared equal position with Long Chengyu.

That would explain why Long Yuhong and her mother were so arrogant. Even Long Muxi was fazed, but she looked more disappointed than frightened.

Just then, two silhouettes landed beside Long Muxi.

The crowd was taken aback, including Long Yuhong and her mother. The two individuals who had just arrived were none other than Long Chengyu and Long Suqing.

“Chengyu, when did you return?”

“Little brother Chengyu, you’re back!”

The crowd hurriedly bowed to Long Chengyu. Even Long Yuhong and her mother lowered their stature and warmly greeted Long Chengyu.

Yet, Long Chengyu ignored them and instead asked Long Muxi, “Big sister, is Long Yuhong bothering you?”

Long Yuhong and her mother felt their hearts sink.

They had heard rumors that Long Chengyu and Long Muxi’s relationship had become strained from their estrangement, but that clearly wasn’t the case. They subconsciously realized that they had gotten into trouble.

“It’s nothing.”

Long Muxi retracted her oppressive might. She didn’t want to rely on Long Chengyu.

Even so, Long Chengyu turned to Long Yuhong and threatened, “Long Yuhong, I’m giving you one last warning not to bother my big sister.”

“Little brother Chengyu, I-I didn’t!” Long Yuhong was so afraid of Long Chengyu that she didn’t even dare to admit what she had just done.

“You didn’t? Do you take us to be blind?” Long Suqing bellowed as she walked up to Long Yuhong and her mother.

Long Yuhong was so intimidated that she could only hide behind her mother’s back.

“Are you oppressing the juniors with your seniority?” Long Suqing coldly questioned Long Huayue as if she was interrogating a criminal.

Long Huayue was displeased. She was afraid of Long Suqing, but her pride wouldn’t tolerate others slighting her, especially now that they were in public.

“What do you want, Long Suqing? I’m warning you…”

Pah!

Before Long Huayue could finish her words, she was struck squarely in the cheeks. The world went completely silent after. A blood-red palm had been imprinted on her face!

This slap wasn’t just on her face but on her dignity and pride too!

“You’re warning me? Are you going to tell the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief to teach me a lesson? Take a look in the mirror and see how much you’re worth first! Do you think that my big brother will turn against me for a woman like you? You’re only receiving preferential treatment because your daughter has passable talents!” Long Suqing sneered.

“Heh…” Long Yuhong’s mother laughed coldly. She glared at Long Suqing with eyes that could kill. “Long Suqing, I shan’t argue with you, but you’ll pay for what you did today!”

“I’d like to see what a woman who relies on her daughter to climb up the ranks can do to me,” Long Suqing scoffed. She turned to the crowd and declared, “I’ll confirm what Long Huayue has just said. We have indeed devoted our resources toward the side hall’s formation to make it easier to tame the Divine Armaments placed there. It’s also true that only two people are able to access the side halls due to the formation’s restriction.”

“What? That’s actually true?”

The crowd was stunned.

How could Long Suqing treat Long Huayue like this when the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief was favoring Long Yuhong by handing this precious opportunity to her?

Long Chengyu answered their doubts, “My father constructed that side hall for me and my big sister. The opportunity was only handed down to Long Yuhong because my father thought that my big sister wouldn’t return, but now that my big sister is back, it’s only right for the opportunity to be returned to its rightful owner.”

The crowd was stunned.

Long Yuhong’s face turned dark. It had always been her wish to overtake Long Muxi, and she thought that she had finally achieved it, but it was suddenly revealed to her that she was only Long Muxi’s back-up all this while! How could she accept that? Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Long Yuhong, you have no rights to enter the side hall. Also, I only acknowledge Long Muxi as my big sister in the entire Totem Dragon Clan. Don’t you ever dare call me little brother again! You aren’t worthy of that,” Long Chengyu sneered.
