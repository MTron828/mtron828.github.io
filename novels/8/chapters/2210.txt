Chapter 2210 - Dangerous Game Of Chess

After that shattering sound, everyone turned their gazes to Zhao Ruofan.

Not only had Zhao Ruofan shattered the teacup in his hand, the tea water in the cup had also splashed all over him.

Awkward. Zhao Ruofan was placed in a truly awkward situation. It was the words of the Red Butterfly Society’s President that made him feel such awkwardness.

The reason for that was because even a fool could tell that their Lady Society President’s final words possessed special meaning.

“Vice President Zhao, what’s wrong?” The Red Butterfly Society’s President asked even though she already knew the answer.

“Lady Society President, are you implying that Chu Feng is to go to Mount Cloud Crane instead of me?” Zhao Ruofan asked directly.

Once he said those words, many of the people present sucked in a mouthful of cold air. None of them had expected Zhao Ruofan to be so direct.

“Vice President Zhao, I had said that the invitation title plate should be given to an able individual,” The Red Butterfly Society’s President said.

“Please excuse this subordinate for his offense, but I truly do not feel that Chu Feng surpasses me in any aspect.”

Zhao Ruofan spoke what he felt. After all, this matter concerned him. Furthermore, the Red Butterfly Society’s President had agreed to have him go with her before.

Thus, even though she was going back on her promise, he still insisted on fighting against her decision. Even if it meant that he would offend her, he would still not hesitate.

He knew very well that the value of a single Immortal-cloak World Spiritist was not something that even the entire Red Butterfly Society could match up against.

If he were as to become an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, he would not care even if he were to be forced to leave the Red Butterfly Society.

“Haha...” Hearing what Zhao Ruofan said, the Red Butterfly Society’s President laughed out loud. She stood up and said to the crowd, “Elders, how old do you think Chu Feng is?”

“Little friend Chu Feng seems to not even be thirty years old. His age would cause him to be considered a member of the younger generation’s younger generation. Even if he were to be placed among ordinary commoners, he would still be considered to be young,” Elder Huang Luo replied.

Hearing what Huang Luo said, the other elders also nodded. In terms of age, Chu Feng was indeed extremely young.

This was especially true when viewed from the viewpoint of the world of martial cultivation. It would not be excessive to say that Chu Feng’s age was simply akin to that of a child that had just set foot into the world of martial cultivation.

“How many people of Chu Feng’s age with rank two Half Martial Ancestor-level cultivations have you all seen before?” The Red Butterfly Society’s President continued to ask.

“Extremely rare. At the very least, I’ve never met another,” Huang Luo replied.

“Indeed, it’s extremely rare.”

The other elders also nodded in succession. Regardless of whether or not Chu Feng was an outsider, it remained that they had to acknowledge his strength.

“I believe there is no need for me to mention to you all how talented Chu Feng is in terms of martial cultivation. However, he possesses another identity that I believe you all might not know about.”

“Chu Feng is actually an Asura World Spiritist,” The Red Butterfly Society’s President continued.

“Asura World Spiritist?!” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Once those words were said, other than the people that already knew about this, the people present were all shocked.

Even Zhao Ruofan, Zhao Xuan and Zhao Xian were stunned.

After all, Asura World Spiritists were no small matter. They were extremely respected existences!!!

“Not only is Chu Feng an Asura World Spiritist, he is also a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist.”

“To be able to train in both martial cultivation and world spirit techniques and obtain such extraordinary accomplishments at such a young age, I believe that no one has seen someone like Chu Feng before, right?” The Red Butterfly Society’s President asked.

“Never, this is simply unheard of,” The crowd said.

“Little friend Chu Feng is truly an absolute genius,” In fact, there were even people that started to flatter Chu Feng with the intention of courting favors from him.

It must be said that when the people found out that Chu Feng was an Asura World Spiritist, there was an enormous change in their attitude toward him.

“That is why Chu Feng is our Red Butterfly Society’s honored guest. In the future, no one is allowed to act rudely toward Chu Feng,” The Red Butterfly Society’s President spoke those words very loudly and clearly.

At that moment, the people present all nodded their heads to express their approval of their Lady Society President’s decision.

They understood the intention of the Red Butterfly Society’s President. An Asura World Spiritist, even if he was only a Royal-cloak World Spiritist now, would be someone that all the powers would want to rope in.

After all, the future potential that an Asura World Spiritist possessed was unable to be estimated.

When looking at it from another point of view, it would be the Red Butterfly Society’s fortune to be able to invite Chu Feng to be their guest.

Thus, the Red Butterfly Society should capture this opportunity and think of all the ways to curry favors with this future grand character they could.

Before, the crowd had felt Liu Chengkun’s request to have Chu Feng accompany their Lady Society President to Mount Cloud Crane to be deliberately creating troubles. However, they now felt that his request was extremely reasonable and fair. At that moment, practically everyone was in favor of that request.

“Lady Society President, you told me before that I would be accompanying you,” Zhao Ruofan said. Even though he knew that those words would end up offending the Red Butterfly Society’s President, he still said them. The reason for that was because he truly did not wish to miss out on a chance of becoming an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist.

“Ah?” Hearing those words, the crowd were all startled. After all, they had never known about that, and also didn’t know whether or not Zhao Ruofan was lying.

However, more than anything, they were shocked by how Zhao Ruofan dared to publicly declare such a thing. His actions were simply challenging their Lady Society President’s authority.

“Vice President Zhao, why do I not remember ever saying that sort of thing to you?” The Red Butterfly Society’s President did not admit to it. Not only that, she also took a displeased glance at Zhao Ruofan.

At the same time, the air in the vast palace hall turned ice cold. Everyone present managed to sense that chilliness.

Facing the gaze of the Red Butterfly Society’s President, as well as her invisible anger, Zhao Ruofan’s body shivered. In the end, he was afraid of their Lady Society President.

“Putt~~~”

Suddenly, Zhao Ruofan kneeled onto the ground. In a very apologetic manner, he declared, “This subordinate is stupid, this subordinate was wrong.”

“Merely, Lady Society President, my older cousin said that if I am able to become an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, our Red Butterfly Society would be able to become the Sunset Cloud Valley’s subsidiary power, that the Sunset Cloud Valley would be willing to help our Red Butterfly Society against Luyang’s Pavilion.”

“Thus, this subordinate is most definitely not trying to strive for this opportunity for my own personal gains. Instead, it is for the sake of our Red Butterfly Society.”

“What?!” Hearing what Zhao Ruofan said, the expressions of the crowd all changed. After all, what he had said was no small matter.

“Vice President Zhao, is what you said the truth?” The Red Butterfly Society’s President narrowed her eyes. Her gaze was filled with suspicion.

Based on her understanding of Zhao Ruofan’s character, she did not believe his words. Merely, she also did not dare to ascertain them to be false, nor did she want to declare him to be lying in public. After all, Vice President Zhao’s older cousin was someone that she could not afford to offend.

“This subordinate would not dare to deceive Lady Society President,” Although Zhao Ruofan spoke those words with confidence, he was feeling very scared. The reason for that was because he knew that he had made it all up, that his older cousin had never mentioned those things before.

However, for the sake of entering Mount Cloud Crane, he must stake his all. Even if he would be punished by the Red Butterfly Society’s President in the future, he must still seize this chance.

If worst came to worst, he could always leave the Red Butterfly Society. However, if he were to become an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist in the process, it would truly mean meteoric success for him.

This was a very dangerous game of chess that he was playing. However, he must continue to play it.
