Chapter 4381: Death Dominion

“Who are you?”

Chu Feng turned in the direction where the voice had come from, but he swiftly realized that the voice originated from the depths of the city, a very far distance away from where Chu Feng was.

It was so far that Chu Feng was unable to reply to him via voice transmission.

Through this, he could tell that the other party was no ordinary figure.

Somehow, it appeared that the other party knew that he was looking for the black streak. So, he quickly got up and flew in the direction where the voice had come from.

While the city was massive, the crowd was mostly gathered around the marketplaces and event zones.

Thee area which Chu Feng went into was the mountain forest, which was filled with the chirping of birds and the fragrance of flowers. It was a beautiful scenery that appeared to be untouched by human hands, forming a stark contrast to the bustle that was happening around him a moment ago.

Any other cultivator would have felt his heart quietening down upon arriving at this area, but it was the opposite for Chu Feng.

His heart was beating in trepidation because the owner of the voice was right within this forest.

Soon, by a small lake within the forest, Chu Feng met the person he was looking for.

It was a silhouette dressed in a white robe. The person was wearing a bamboo hat with a white shawl hanging from it that concealed their appearance, making it impossible for Chu Feng to discern their gender.

On top of that, the person appeared to have modified their voice too, so Chu Feng was unable to make a judgment through that either.

“Junior Chu Feng pays respects to elder.”

After Chu Feng landed on the ground, he first greeted the other party deeply and introduced himself.

He felt that there was no point concealing his identity. Since the other party knew that he was looking for the black streak, it was likely that the other party knew of his identity too. If that was the case, there wasn’t much meaning in him hiding his name.

“I know that you’re Chu Feng,” the other party replied.

“Elder, do you really know what I’m looking for?” Chu Feng asked with incredible politeness and respect.

“The item you are looking for an extremely dangerous object.”

“Elder, can you tell where it is at the moment?” Chu Feng asked.

“I can tell where it is, but you’ll have to do me a favor first,” the other party replied.

“May I know what help can I offer to you?” Chu Feng asked.

There’s an item in the city right now that I’m interested in. I want you to get it for me.”

“What item is it, and where can I get it?” Chu Feng asked.

“It’s the prize of the world spiritist tournament that is being held in the city at the moment. You should be able to emerge victorious easily with your capability. As long as you bring the item here to me, I’ll tell you where the item you are seeking is,” the other party replied.

In truth, Chu Feng had a lot of doubts in his mind at the moment.

He wanted to know who the other party was, as well as how they knew of his motive. In fact, he suspected that the culprit who had interfered with the sensing of his compass might be the other party

However, Chu Feng didn’t voice out his curiosity. Instead, he asked, “Elder, can I take your words for it?”

“Of course!” the other party replied.

“Do you have any evidence for me to believe in what you have just said?” Chu Feng asked.

Shoosh!

Right after Chu Feng said those words, the other party suddenly vanished on the spot.

When the other party finally appeared once more, he was already standing right before Chu Feng, and his finger was pressing against Chu Feng’s forehead.

It was a very gentle touch, but nevertheless, when that finger came into contact with his forehead, Chu Feng felt as if he had fallen into the abyss.

It was fortunate that the feeling only lasted for a moment before vanishing into thin air. By then, however, he was already sweating profusely, and he was gasping for air.

The other party was extremely powerful, a being who possessed strength even he couldn’t fathom.

“Do you still have any more doubts?” the other party asked.

“Elder, if you are this powerful, why don’t you take the item you want personally instead? Why do you need to send me to do it in your stead?”

The other party was so powerful that they could be considered to be like a godlike figure to the current Chu Feng. Based on his estimations, the other party was unlikely to be an ordinary Martial Exalted level cultivator, especially since there was no Martial Exalted level cultivator who had been able to leave him with such pressure before.

Due to that, he couldn’t understand why the other party would need his help on this matter.

“A gentleman may be materialistic but he chooses his means. Besides, the owner of that item is not as simple as you think him out to be. Attempting to snatch his thing away forcefully is not a wise decision,” the other party said.

“You mean the Sagacious Grandmaster?”

Based on what he was hearing, it seemed like the Sagacious Grandmaster was truly powerful.

Without a doubt, the Nine Souls Galaxy was stronger than the Holy Light Galaxy. It hadn’t been long since Chu Feng had arrived here, but he had already encountered so many experts in this Upper Realm.

Chu Feng felt that the person before him was an expert whom even the renowned Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief of the Holy Light Galaxy wouldn’t be able to deal with, and the gap between them was considerably huge.

And if such was the case for the Nine Souls Galaxy, how would it be for the remaining seven Galaxies then?

Chu Feng suddenly felt like he was incredibly insignificant in the larger world.

“Elder, if I were to obtain what you needed, where should I head to in order to look for you?” Chu Feng asked.

It was not that Chu Feng particularly trusted the other party, but he had no choice but to work together with the other party. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“As long as you are able to obtain it, you can expect me to look for you,” the other party replied.

“Elder, if someone were to hinder me, would you be offering me any help?” Chu Feng asked again.

“If my help is needed in this matter, what use do I have for you? Shouldn’t I simply snatch it over myself then?” the other party replied impatiently.

“Elder, please don’t misunderstand. I’ll obtain the treasure for you through my own strength, but I have a few enemies in this area. If they were to interfere, would it be possible for you to assist me in warding them off?”

The enemies that Chu Feng was talking about was, of course, those from the Soaring Flower Gazebo.

He did steal the treasure that the Soaring Flower Gazebo had been cultivating for a very long time, and there was no way the Soaring Flower Gazebo would let things go easily.

He wasn’t sure whether the Soaring Flower Gazebo’s sectmaster knew about this matter yet, but at the same time, he didn’t dare to conceal his appearance due to Zhao Hong.

If the Soaring Flower Gazebo’s sectmaster were to know that he was the culprit who stole away the treasure, and Chu Feng were to appear in public at this moment, he would be simply courting death.

“I see, I get what you mean. You don’t have to worry about that. If outsiders were to hinder you, I will back you,” the other party replied.

“Thank you, elder. I’ll be heading over to obtain what you need then.”

Hearing those words, Chu Feng felt a bit more confident than before, so he quickly got into action.

As he had heard quite a few news regarding the world spiritist tournament along the way, he knew that the tournament had already begun and would soon come to an end.

If he wanted to participate in it, he would have to make haste.

There were two methods as to how one could join the tournament, and they were stated very clearly in the rules right from the start.

The first way was to go through the usual route, fighting against opponents round after round and gradually progress into the finals.

But other than that, there was actually a faster method, and that was to challenge the Death Dominion.
