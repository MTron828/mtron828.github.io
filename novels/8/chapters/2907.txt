Chapter 2907 - Stone Gambling Hall

The Stone Gambling Hall was not only a place of enjoyment for the arriving guests, it was also an important place of profit for the Ghost Sect Hall. Thus, a lot of gamblers would arrive at the Stone Gambling Hall and become engrossed in Stone Gambling every day.

Some people had abandoned their path of martial cultivation because of this. Some had even lost all of their family fortune. From this, it could be seen that the fascination of Stone Gambling was truly extraordinary.

Although the Stone Gambling Hall possessed entrances especially for the gamblers, it was still located within the Ghost Sect Hall.

Thus, it was not a long journey. Soon, Chu Feng, Xia Yun’er and Elder Xingyi arrived at the so-called Stone Gambling Hall.

Upon arrival, Chu Feng finally managed to see the so-called Black Crystal Stone.

The Black Crystal Stones were completely black in color. It was so black that it was actually reflecting the light shining on it.

Chu Feng attempted to use his world spirit techniques to observe the Black Crystal Stones. Sure enough, he was unable to see through them.

From this, it could be seen that Xia Yun’er had not deceived him. It would appear that world spiritists were truly unable to see through those Black Crystal Stones.

However, when Chu Feng attempted to use his Heaven’s Eyes to inspect them, he discovered that there was a change.

Even though his Heaven’s Eyes were also unable to see through the Black Crystal Stones, the effect of his Heaven’s Eyes was definitely not limited to simply seeing through something.

The most important aspect of the Heaven’s Eyes was that they could see details that ordinary people would not be able to see. They were capable of deciphering formations, searching for tombs and seeing through one’s character.

As for those Black Crystal Stones, regardless of how extraordinary they were, they remained material objects. Through his Heaven’s Eyes, Chu Feng was able to discover peculiarities.

Merely, Chu Feng was unable to be certain as to whether what he saw was correct or not. He would still have to study the Black Crystal Stones meticulously. As for success or failure, he must give it a try first.

“Chu Feng, there are too many people here. Let’s go to the second floor,” Xia Yun’er said.

The so-called Stone Gambling Hall was actually a vast and extravagant palace. There were a total of three floors to the palace.

The Black Crystal Stones being sold on the first floor were all some leftover small stones. Even the largest among them would only be the size of a watermelon. The smallest among them were only as big as a potato. Because of that, their prices were relatively cheap.

The first floor had the greatest amount of people, so many that it could even be considered a vast crowd. It was truly a gathering of gamblers. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Xia Yun’er did not wish to linger on the first floor for too long. It might be because the Black Crystal Stones there were too small, and did not attract her.

On the other hand, it might be because there were too many people there, making things chaotic. As Xia Yun’er and Chu Feng were akin to celebrities in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, the moment someone recognized her, she would naturally be surrounded by others and stared at like a monkey.

“Look! Isn’t that Chu Feng, the exceptional genius who defeated Han Yu?!”

“Woah! Who is that beauty beside Chu Feng?! She is simply too beautiful! How could there be such a beautiful woman in this world?! She is simply not a human, but a celestial fairy!”

“That is... that is... that is the Starfall Holy Land’s Holy Daughter, one of our Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm’s Three Great Beauties, Xia Yun’er!!!”

“What?! Xia Yun’er?! The Starfall Holy Land’s Holy Daughter?! Heavens! I was actually fortunate enough to see the Starfall Holy Land’s Holy Daughter! I have no regrets in life, no regrets in life!”

Unfortunately, Xia Yun’er’s proposal to move to the second floor was spoken too late. They were immediately recognized right after entering the Stone Gambling Hall.

At that moment, everyone cast their gazes toward them. Those gamblers even let go of their most-beloved Stone Gambling.

A wave emerged from the vast crowd of people. That vast amount of people began to move toward Chu Feng and Xia Yun’er.

“Cough, cough...”

Right at that moment, Elder Xingyi coughed twice.

Even though his coughing was done very lightly, the people present were all able to hear it.

“Elder Xingyi?! It’s the Starfall Eight Immortal’s Elder Xingyi!” A keen-eyed individual in the crowd actually recognized Elder Xingyi.

Upon hearing the name of Elder Xingyi, practically everyone present no longer dared to approach Chu Feng and Xia Yun’er. The Stone Gambling Hall that was in an uproar earlier grew quiet.

It was common knowledge that the Starfall Holy Land’s Holy Daughter was protected by the Starfall Eight Immortals.

Who were the Starfall Eight Immortals? They were all Martial Immortal-level existences.

As for Elder Xingyi, he was the leader of the Starfall Eight Immortals, and also the strongest among them.

Before him, countless grand characters would yield. As for people of their level, how could they possibly dare to act rashly before him?

“Friends, please make way. Our Holy Daughter wishes to proceed to the second floor,” Elder Xingyi said.

“Crash~~~”

Once Elder Xingyi said those words, the tightly packed crowd immediately moved aside to form a path leading straight to the second floor.

Chu Feng, Xia Yun’er and Elder Xingyi arrived at the entrance of the second floor before the gazes of the crowd.

The second floor was not a place that just anyone could enter. The reason for that was because it was guarded.

Guarding the entrance was an aged old man. Not only did he appear quite strong, but he was actually pretty strong. Judging from his aura, he should be a Martial Immortal-level expert as well.

With an existence of his level guarding the entrance, it could be seen how much the Ghost Sect Hall valued the Gambling Stone Hall.

Furthermore, with that old man guarding the entrance, it illustrated that the second floor was not a place that people could enter at will. Beside that old man was a signboard. On the signboard were several large words.

‘A hundred Immortal Martial Stones per person.’

Elder Xingyi was prepared. He already had three hundred Immortal Martial Stones in hand by the time he arrived before that old man.

“Elder Xingyi, Young Master Chu Feng, our Lord Hall Master has given the order. You all do not have to pay the entrance fee upon coming here,” that old man said.

“Rules are rules. Please express our thanks to your Hall Master,” Elder Xingyi said with a smile on his face.

Then, he placed the three hundred Immortal Martial Stones into the jade basin located on the side. Although that jade basin was not very large, it possessed an identical effect to Cosmos Sacks. In fact, its volume greatly surpassed that of Cosmos Sacks.

The mere three hundred Immortal Martial Stones were immediately swallowed by the jade basin upon landing in it.

With Elder Xingyi insisting on paying the fee, that elder in charge of guarding the entrance did not say anything, and immediately moved aside.

Elder Xingyi led Chu Feng and Xia Yun’er to the second floor of the Gambling Stone Hall.

Chu Feng and the others felt that a hundred Immortal Martial Stones would be able to stop a lot of people. After all, an ordinary Immortal Armament would only be worth ten thousand Immortal Martial Stones. As such, a hundred Immortal Martial Stones was quite a sum.

While it would not be too excessive to pay a hundred Immortal Martial Stones to purchase something, it was not a small fee to pay for an entrance fee.

Unless the ones paying the fees were truly rich, one would definitely feel pained to spend a hundred Immortal Martial Stones on an entrance fee.

However, Chu Feng and Xia Yun’er had underestimated their charm. Immediately after Chu Feng, Xia Yun’er and Elder Xingyi ascended to the the second floor, a large group of people followed after them from behind.

All those people had prepared a hundred Immortal Martial Stones. They were planning to ascend to the second floor to continue to observe Chu Feng and Xia Yun’er.

However, who would’ve thought that right after Chu Feng, Xia Yun’er and Elder Xingyi stepped onto the path to the second floor, the elder in charge of guarding the entrance waved his sleeve. The next moment, the words on the signboard changed.

It was no longer ‘A hundred Immortal Martial Stones per person.’

Instead, it became ‘Five hundred Immortal Martial Stones per person.’
