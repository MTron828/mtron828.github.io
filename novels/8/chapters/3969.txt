Chapter 3969 - Chu Feng’s Methods

“He actually dares to speak in such a manner?”

Chu Feng’s words had utterly astonished the crowd. No matter what, that Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain’s female disciple was a rank two Exalted.

Although her strength was weaker than Song Jinglun and Zhao Zicheng’s, she was still an extremely powerful existence among the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain’s disciples.

Besides, there were so many Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain disciples present. Even Song Jinglun and Zhao Zicheng were there.

Especially Zhao Zicheng, he stood right beside that female disciple. Yet, in such a situation, Chu Feng actually dared to speak in such a manner. It was only natural that the crowd would be astonished.

Compared to the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain disciples, the Wind Lightning Sword Sect disciples were even more astonished.

Compared to Bai Lulu, they felt that Wang Chen going against the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain’s disciples with his cultivation was even more of an act of courting death.

“I, Zhao Zicheng, guarantee that even if you do not die today, you will not be able to leave peacefully.”

Right at that moment, Zhao Zicheng stood forward.

He had fully unleashed his aura. Even though he spoke in a very deemphasizing manner, one could feel enormous threat from his words.

Even though his words were aimed at Chu Feng and not them, the disciples of the Wind Lightning Sword Sect still shivered in fear.

Seeing Zhao Zicheng acting like that, the same thought appeared in the minds of the Wind Lightning Sword Sect disciples.

‘Doomed. This Wang Chen is most definitely screwed.’

Compared to the terrified Wind Lightning Sword Sect’s disciples, Chu Feng let out a faint chuckle.

“Threatening me?”

“It would appear that you still haven’t realized that you’re also nothing more than trash in my eyes,” Chu Feng said to Zhao Zicheng.

“What?”

“This...”

“This guy, he...”

“Madness. Wang Chen must’ve gone mad.”

“That’s Zhao Zicheng of all people, the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain’s genius second only to Song Jinglun.”

The crowd opened their mouths wide with shock after hearing Chu Feng’s words.

Even though Chu Feng had blocked the oppressive might from that Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain’s female disciple, they did not think that Chu Feng, or Wang Chen as they saw him, would be able to defeat Zhao Zicheng.

As such, they felt that as their Wind Lightning Sword Sect was already defeated, Wang Chen’s provocation towards Zhao Zicheng was most definitely not a sensible act.

“Brat, you’ve truly grown tired of living.”

“If my memory serves me right, the person that was contradicting senior brother Song earlier was also you.”

“A perfect opportunity. I will teach you a lesson on behalf of senior brother Song.”

After saying those words, Zhao Zicheng pulled out his weapon. He was planning to attack Chu Feng.

“Wait.”

However, at that moment, Chu Feng suddenly waved his hand and indicated for Zhao Zicheng to stay his hand.

“What’s this? Scared?”

“It’s too late to be scared now.”

An evil smile appeared on Zhao Zicheng’s face.

Then, he continued, “That said, it remains that the six great powers are allies. Taking that into consideration, I could give you a chance.”

“How about this: if you are to kneel, kowtow and apologize to me, and then make sure to always kneel, kowtow and address me as ancestor whenever you see me, and then lick clean the mud on the soles of my shoes, I will consider sparing you today.”

Once Zhao Zicheng said those words, the disciples from the Wind Lightning Sword Sect all heaved a sigh of relief for Chu Feng.

Although kneeling, kowtowing, begging for forgiveness and licking the soles of someone’s shoes were very humiliating things, it was still better than being ruthlessly taught a lesson by Zhao Zicheng.

However, after hearing Zhao Zicheng’s words, the smile that was originally on Chu Feng’s face disappeared. In its place was an ice-cold look.

When he looked to Zhao Zicheng again, the air he emitted had changed completely.

“If you are to apologize right now, I can pretend that you never said those words.” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Otherwise, you shall have to bear the consequences of your actions,” said Chu Feng.

“Madness. This guy’s most definitely gone mad!”

“He’s actually still threatening Zhao Zicheng in such a situation?”

Both the disciples from the Wind Lightning Sword Sect and the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain were thinking the same thing.

They felt that Chu Feng’s behavior was most definitely him seeking his own doom.

With that, it was likely that not even the celestial emperor himself would be able to save him.

As for Zhao Zicheng, he burst into loud laughter.

His laughter was very eerie. Hearing it, one would tremble with fear.

“It would appear that you’re someone who refuses to shed a tear until you see your coffin,” Zhao Zicheng said ferociously.

“Indeed, you are someone who refuses to shed a tear until you see your coffin,” said Chu Feng.

“Zzzzz~~~”

In the next instant, lightning surged forth. Chu Feng had attacked.

At the instant Chu Feng attacked, the disciples from the Wind Lightning Sword Sect and the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain were all stunned.

“Look! Look over there! Look at the Wind Lightning Sword Sect!” someone outside cried in a sudden alarm.

Once his cries were heard, the crowd, whose focus was originally on Nangong Yifan’s battle against Wu Ming and Miao Jiutian, turned their gazes in the Wind Lightning Sword Sect’s direction out of curiosity.

“Heavens! What is that?!”

Once they did so, the crowd’s expressions all changed.

Even the expressions of the grand existences atop the main viewing platforms changed.

They were able to see that the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain disciples that had defeated the Wind Lightning Sword Sect disciples were actually all surrounding a single person.

That person was a disciple of the Wind Lightning Sword Sect.

With a Wind Lightning Sword in hand, that disciple was sweeping everything before him.

With every attack, disciples from the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain would fall by his sword.

In merely an instant, all of the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain’s disciples had fallen to the ground.

However, it just so happened that the crowd recognized that Wind Lightning Sword Sect disciple.

They couldn’t possibly forget him. After all, he was the person that the crowd had deemed to be trash at the very start.

He was that disciple by the name of Wang Chen.

“Why would he be this powerful?”

“What’s going on? Exactly what is going on here?”

It was not only the Wind Lightning Sword Sect disciples that were astonished. The bystanders outside were also all astonished.

In fact, even the sectmaster of the Wind Lightning Sword Sect had a look of disbelief on his face.

After all, he clearly remembered that it was that disciple that had utterly humiliated him earlier.

Yet, in the time of their Wind Lightning Sword Sect’s crisis, that disciple actually stood forth for them.

This was something that he’d never anticipated would happen.

“Truly well concealed. This young friend has truly concealed his strength well.”

“Sectmaster Wind Lightning, your Wind Lightning Sword Sect is one with crouching tigers and hidden dragons.”

“Right. That child’s strength is extraordinary. The way I see it, he’s likely not inferior to Ouyang Pingzhi.”

“Congratulations Sectmaster Wind Lightning. Congratulations on your Wind Lightning Sword Sect gaining another such demon-level genius.”

At that moment, the people that had been mocking the Wind Lightning Sword Sect’s sectmaster earlier began to offer him congratulations.

Faced with this, the previously ugly expression on the Wind Lightning Sword Sect’s sectmaster disappeared completely. He was beaming with happiness.

That said, he had no idea how to respond to the crowd’s questions.

After all, even he himself did not know who that disciple was.

Even though he was the Wind Lightning Sword Sect’s sectmaster, he would generally be in closed-door training the entire time.

Apart from Ouyang Pingzhi and a few other top disciples, he knew very little about any individual disciple.

At the least, he did not know Wang Chen.

That said, he had to admit that that disciple had given him an enormously pleasant surprise.

“This guy!”

Soon, the pleasantly surprised looks on the crowd’s faces were replaced with ones of complicated emotions.

This was especially true for the Wind Lightning Sword Sect’s elders. Unease filled their faces as they turned to their sectmaster.

As for the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain’s headmaster, he even smashed his hand onto the side table beside him and stood up.

With a furious expression, he pointed to the Wind Lightning Sword Sect’s sectmaster. “Look at your good disciple! Is he not going to abide by the simplest rules?!”

Faced with the criticism from the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain’s headmaster, the Wind Lightning Sword Sect’s sectmaster revealed a distressed and disappointed look. He didn’t know how to respond.

Indeed, the current situation had surpassed everyone’s expectations.

Chu Feng became more and more ruthless toward the disciples of the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain.

As for how ruthless he was, it could be seen by the expressions of the Wind Lightning Sword Sect’s disciples in the spirit formation world.

The Wind Lightning Sword Sect disciples were not only defeated by the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain’s disciples, but they were also humiliated by them.

Logically, they should be filled with hatred and resentment toward them.

Yet, at that moment, they were actually unable to bear to look at the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain disciples. Some among them even had fearful looks on their faces.

Even though they were fellow disciples, they were still terrified by Chu Feng’s methods.
