Chapter 3954 - This Item Is Extraordinary

Then, Chu Feng proceeded towards the location where the people from the Red-dress Holy Land were.

He wanted to inform them of what had happened on Mount Ivory Valley so that they could prepare mentally.

To Chu Feng’s surprise, by the time he arrived, everyone from the Red-dress Holy Land had left. Furthermore, they did not leave any clues as to where they went.

That being said, judging from the appearance of things, the people from the Red-dress Holy Land didn’t seem to have been attacked. Instead, it seemed more like they’d decided to leave on their own.

Chu Feng did not directly leave. Instead, he proceeded to the Seven Suns Mountain Range.

He wanted to inform Yuan Shu about those Ancient Era’s organisms.

However, when he reached the Seven Suns Mountain Range, he learned that Yuan Shu was not present either.

Due to the urgent timing of things, Chu Feng needed to proceed for the All-heaven Upper Realm without delay. Thus, Chu Feng told the guards of the Seven Suns Mountain Range about what had happened on Mount Ivory Valley.

Then, Chu Feng proceeded to the All-heaven Upper Realm and arrived at the appointed place with the Mystic Cave Saints.

The place that they’d agreed to meet at was a little abandoned fishing village.

This little fishing village was very close to the All-heaven Sect. However, it was now completely empty.

All of the villagers had left the village. The reason for that was because it was too close to the All-heaven Sect.

The All-heaven Sect was extremely tyrannical. They refused to allow any power to be permanently established within ten thousand miles of them.

Because of that, the surrounding ten thousand miles around the All-heaven Sect were completely devoid of human habitation. Apart from travelers, martial cultivators were rarely seen, and simply no one lived in the area.

That said, the Mystic Cave Saints had waited for Chu Feng in the fishing village for a long time already.

“Brother Asura, you’re finally here. We’d thought that something had happened to you.”

“Right. We were truly worried about you. Seeing that you’re fine, we are truly relieved.”

The Mystic Cave Saints were all overjoyed to see Chu Feng.

Their emotional appearance looked rather exaggerated. However, they didn’t seem to be faking it either.

Although Chu Feng and the Mystic Cave Saints had not known each other for long, Chu Feng was already someone with a special status in the hearts of the Mystic Cave Saints.

“Not only did I not encounter any mishaps, I instead managed to gain some harvest,” Chu Feng said with a smile.

“Harvest? What sort of harvest?” Hearing the word ‘harvest,’ the interest of the Mystic Cave Saints was immediately perked.

Chu Feng knew the personality of the Mystic Cave Saints very well. Since they were curious, he would have to explain things to them. If he didn’t, the Mystic Cave Saints would continue to pester him to no end.

As such, he did not bother to conceal things from the Mystic Cave Saints. He informed them of everything that had happened in the Galewind Hunting Clan.

He even told them about the divine deer.

“Brother Asura, could you display that Ancient Era’s secret skill again?”

“Right. Show it to us so that we can see it for ourselves, and properly help you determine what level of secret skill it is.”

After hearing Chu Feng talk about the divine deer, the Mystic Cave Saints all became very interested in it.

“I’ve already told you that I am unable to control that power. Unless it wants to, I am unable to unleash it,” Chu Feng said with a sigh.

“Hearing what you’ve said, that thing is truly remarkable.”

“Treasure. Brother Asura, you’ve picked up an extraordinary otherworldly treasure. That’s simply an enormous fortune, an enormous opportunity that you’ve received. Fate, oh that is fate. You are truly fortunate.”

The Mystic Cave Saints were wild with joy. They acted as if they were the ones that had obtained the Ancient Era’s secret skill.

“Well then, I’ve already told you what I’ve experienced.”

“Now, let’s discuss proper business. How are preparations for this operation coming along?”

“You said to leave everything to you, that I merely needed to arrive on time,” said Chu Feng.

“Brother Asura, you can set your mind to ease at how we handle things.”

“During these days, we’ve spent a great amount of resources to set up a grand formation outside the All-heaven Sect. Once that grand formation is set in motion, no one will be able to cause you harm within a short period of time. At that time, you’ll be able to escape safely.”

“As for sneaking in to plunder the treasure, it is not something that will pose a problem for you to begin with. After all, you’re a person of the younger generation. Thus, you merely need to disguise yourself, and you’ll be able to enter that spirit formation space.”

“Once you’ve entered that spirit formation space, you’ll be able to do whatever you please. Those people of the younger generation are simply no match for you.”

“As for the experts of the All-heaven Sect, no matter how powerful they might be, they are unable to enter that world spirit space due to their age. Thus, the treasure is yours to take.”

“Once you leave that world spirit space, we will activate the grand formation. With that, you’ll be able to escape,” said the Mystic Cave Saints.

“That spirit formation is truly that powerful?” asked Chu Feng.

“Rest assured, the spirit formation will definitely not let you down. For the sake of that spirit formation, we’ve put forth enormous strength. We guarantee that no one will be able to cause you harm. Not to mention the All-heaven Sect, even the overlords of other starfields will not be able to do anything to you,” the Mystic Cave Saints guaranteed as they patted their chests.

“With how powerful that spirit formation is, are we able to utilize it to kill them?” asked Chu Feng.

“Kill who? You want to kill the headmaster of the All-heaven Sect?” asked the Mystic Cave Saints.

“Is the spirit formation capable of that?” asked Chu Feng.

“No, it wouldn’t be able to do that. Although that spirit formation is capable of protecting you thoroughly, it is unable to harm them. Furthermore, that spirit formation can only be used for a limited period of time. You must escape within the time limit.” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Brother Asura, it’s like this. Our spirit formation could be considered to be a temporary spatial teleportation formation. Once you exit the space with the treasures, you will enter the spirit formation, and the spirit formation will be able to directly teleport you to a safe region.”

“Of course, we will prepare the imprint on your body ahead of time. Only by using that imprint will one be able to enter that spirit formation and be teleported.”

“Thus, even if the people from the All-heaven Sect want to pursue you, they will not be able to.”

“They can only look on helplessly as you take away their treasures, and be unable to do anything,” added the eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.

“So that’s the case. I understand then,” said Chu Feng.

“Brother Asura, you can rest assured. We will not harm you. Our preparations are absolutely safe. In fact... we’ve spent a great amount of effort to obtain a treasure.”

“Look, it’s this.”

As the eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints spoke, he took out an item from his body.

It was a little golden person. That person was fully made of golden gases.

Chu Feng was able to sense enormous power from the little golden person.

“What is this?” asked Chu Feng.

“This here is a remarkable item.”

“Should one activate this item, one will be able to fight against the people from the All-heaven Sect!” the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints said proudly.
