Chapter 2938 - No One Can Save You

“Enough of your bullshit. That Blackflame Ghost Sword is our Chu Heavenly Clan’s clan-protection treasure. It belongs only to our Chu Heavenly Clan,” the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations said.

“Even if the Blackflame Ghost Sword is your Chu Heavenly Clan’s clan-protection treasure; so what? It’s something I’ve obtained from the Illusory Blood Lotus, not something I stole from your Chu Heavenly Clan. Why must I hand it over to you all?” Chu Feng asked.

“Humph. Chu Feng, the way I see it, you still don’t understand whose territory this Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm is,” Chu Huanyu said coldly.

However, after Chu Feng heard those words, he laughed coldly, “You’re trying to threaten me? I’m sorry but I, Chu Feng, have never feared threats before.”

“However, this remains to be something that Senior Chu Hanxian created. I will respect Senior Chu Hanxian and give you all an opportunity to retrieve the Blackflame Ghost Sword.”

“Chu Feng, he...”

The crowd were all surprised by hearing Chu Feng’s words. They felt a slight amount of disappointment in their eyes.

They all subconsciously felt that Chu Feng was about to reach terms. However, should Chu Feng reach terms, the fearless image that he had in their hearts would be damaged.

At the moment when the crowd felt that Chu Feng was afraid of the Chu Heavenly Clan and about to reach terms, Chu Feng turned the around Blackflame Ghost Sword and held the sword’s blade with his hand, pointing the hilt toward the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations.

He said, “Pass through the crimson fog and arrive before me. Do that, and the Blackflame Ghost Sword shall be yours.”

“This guy!!!”

Once Chu Feng said those words, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations, including Chu Huanyu, all started to frown.

If they dared to enter the crimson fog, was there even a need for them to demand the Blackflame Ghost Sword from Chu Feng?

Chu Feng’s words had truly stumped them.

Seeing that the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations had all grown quiet, the smile on Chu Feng’s face grew even stronger. Unable to contain himself, he said, “I have given you all the chance. Unfortunately, you all are beyond hope.”

“Chu Feng, you are simply bullying intolerably!!”

Chu Huanyu and the other Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations all revealed looks of anger all over their faces.

Chu Feng was insulting them before all these people. They were truly unable to not be angry at Chu Feng.

However, Chu Feng was inside the crimson fog, and they did not dare to approach him. Even though they were feeling extremely furious, they were unable to do anything. As such, they grew more and more angry.

“Little friends from the Chu Heavenly Clan, do not be angry. I will help you all take care of that Chu Feng.”

Right at that moment, a voice was suddenly heard. Following that, several figures appeared in the nearby sky.

It was a group of people. They were standing in an orderly manner in the sky. One could tell from a glance that they were all well-trained experts.

When that group of people appeared, everyone present felt themselves being suppressed by some sort of invisible power. Those people were truly too strong. Their waving banners also allowed the crowd to know who those people were.

Goldenstone Royal Clan. Those people were from the Goldenstone Royal Clan.

Furthermore, the person leading them was an Exalted-level expert, the Goldenstone Royal Clan’s Clan Chief. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Goldenstone Royal Clan?”

“Sure enough, they didn’t leave; they’re planning to take care of Chu Feng!!!”

Upon seeing the Goldenstone Royal Clan’s troops, many people started to worry for Chu Feng.

Had it been other people that wanted to attack Chu Feng, the crowd present might not necessarily be so tense.

However, the person who had spoken and declared his intention to take care of Chu Feng was none other than the Goldenstone Royal Clan’s Clan Chief, an Exalted-level expert.

With an Exalted-level expert wanting to take care of Chu Feng, who could possibly save him?

Not to mention Elder Xingyi, not even the Ghost Sect Hall’s Hall Master could protect Chu Feng.

“Clan Chief Jinshi, little friend Chu Feng only won ten million Immortal Martial Stones from your son.”

“For you to want to kill little friend Chu Feng because of something so minor, do you not think it would make you appear extremely petty, do you not feel that it would go against your status?” The Ghost Sect Hall’s Hall master said. There was no small amount of mockery in his tone.

However, the Goldenstone Royal Clan’s Clan Chief chuckled at the Ghost Sect Hall’s Hall Master’s words, “Did you really think that I was trying to take care of Chu Feng for something that minor?”

“Is that not the reason?”

“If that isn’t the reason, then I will have to trouble you with providing me with an explanation for trying to take care of Chu Feng. Otherwise... I will absolutely not ignore this matter,” the Ghost Sect Hall’s Hall Master said.

Once he said those words, the crowd present immediately burst into an uproar.

After all, what the Ghost Sect Hall’s Hall Master said was equivalent to him telling everyone that he was planning to protect Chu Feng.

Even when faced with the Goldenstone Royal Clan’s Clan Chief, the Ghost Sect Hall’s Hall Master was still willing to challenge them. The crowd felt admiration toward his courage.

“That’s right. There should be a reason why you want to kill Young Hero Chu Feng, no?”

The crowd present also began to echo the Ghost Sect Hall’s Hall Master’s question.

Actually, they were all skeptical toward what the Goldenstone Royal Clan’s Clan Chief said.

Those people all felt that the Goldenstone Royal Clan’s Clan Chief wanted to kill Chu Feng as revenge because Chu Feng had won a large sum of Immortal Martial Stones from his son. The crowd simply did not believe him when he said that wasn’t the reason.

Faced with the crowd’s questions, the Goldenstone Royal Clan’s Clan Chief said, “It was merely a request from someone, a request that I needed to help with.”

“A request from someone?”

Once the Goldenstone Royal Clan’s Clan Chief said those words, he immediately created a major commotion.

Not to mention the others, even the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations were feeling extremely shocked.

The Goldenstone Royal Clan’s Clan Chief was actually asked by someone to kill Chu Feng. In that case, who was the person that had requested his assistance?

After all, the Goldenstone Royal Clan was the strongest expert of an Upper Realm. The person who was able to request his assistance would definitely not be an ordinary individual.

“Clan Chief Jinshi received his request from this old man. Everyone, do you all have any objection to it?”

At the moment when the crowd were all guessing who could possibly request the Goldenstone Royal Clan’s Clan Chief, a voice suddenly sounded.

“Who is it?! Who dares to speak in such an arrogant manner?!”

After that voice was heard, many people from the older generations started to question it.

After all, the final words spoken by that individual, that ‘do you all have any objection to it,’ were said in a truly arrogant manner. That person was simply not placing anyone present in his eyes at all.

“Haha, arrogant? It is this old man who said those words,” Soon, that old man’s voice sounded again.

At the same time, a figure appeared in the distant sky.

“Heavens, that is!!!”

When the crowd saw that old man, the expressions of the experts from the older generation all changed enormously.

The person who had appeared was a legendary character of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.

He had disappeared for many years. His name was Yuwen Huazang.

“It’s him?!!!”

Not to mention the others, even the Ghost Sect Hall’s Hall Master and Elder Xingyi revealed a change in expression. Deep worry filled their eyes.

That Yuwen Huazang was most definitely a top character in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.

Although he was unassociated with any power, his own strength was extremely powerful. He had stepped into the Exalted realm many years ago.

Although he was still only a rank one Exalted, his strength was most definitely not something that ordinary rank one Exalted could compare against.

In fact, after he revealed himself, even the Goldenstone Royal Clan’s Clan Chief’s aura seemed to have been suppressed by him. From this, it could be seen how powerful that Yuwen Huazang was.

Not to mention a power like the Ghost Sect Hall, even a colossus like the Starfall Holy Land would not be willing to make an enemy of an existence like him.

Furthermore, everyone knew that whilst Yuwen Huazang was unassociated with any power, he was the Yuwen City’s City Master’s master. Thus, Yuwen Huazang possessed an extraordinary relationship with Yuwen City.

As for the Yuwen City’s City Master’s son, he was killed by Chu Feng. As such, it was reasonable for Yuwen Huazang to help the Yuwen City’s City Master obtain revenge.

As such, Yuwen Huazang possessed sufficient reason to take care of Chu Feng.

At that moment, the people that were concerned for Chu Feng all cried ‘Oh no!’ in their hearts.

The reason for that was because that Yuwen Huazang was actually even more thorny compared to the Goldenstone Royal Clan.

“I am the one that wants to kill that Chu Feng. Everyone, do you all have any objections?” Yuwen Huazang asked the crowd.

Once he said those words, not even the Ghost Sect Hall’s Hall Master dared to say anything.

Yuwen Huazang was a famous vagabond. He dared to do all sorts of things. Although the Ghost Sect Hall also possessed a backer behind them, their backer was not present at the moment.

If the Ghost Sect Hall was to try to protect Chu Feng, then with the personality of Yuwen Huazang, it would not be impossible for him to wipe out the entire Ghost Sect Hall.

After weighing the pros and cons, the Ghost Sect Hall’s Hall Master had no choice but to shut his mouth tight.

As the Hall Master of the Ghost Sect Hall, he could not ruin the entire Ghost Sect Hall for the sake of a single Chu Feng.

At the same time, Elder Xingyi, who had declared that he would definitely protect Chu Feng before, also did not dare to say anything.

The reason for that was because he knew very well what sort of temperament Yuwen Huazang possessed. Thus, he did not dare to speak.

He was afraid that if he were to attempt to protect Chu Feng, it would not only be him who would end up suffering a calamity, Xia Yun’er and the other disciples from the Starfall Holy Land would all be implicated too.

After all, Yuwen Huazang was a lawless homicidal maniac.

When even the Ghost Sect Hall’s Hall Master and Elder Xingyi did not dare to say anything, who among the crowd could possibly dare to speak out for Chu Feng?

At that moment, although people had filled both the sky and the ground, it was completely quiet.

Seeing this, Yuwen Huazang revealed a sneer on his face. Then, he said to Chu Feng, “Chu Feng, it would appear that no one will be able to save you today.”

“I doubt that,” right after Yuwen Huazang said those words, a voice exploded in the distance.

That voice was so ear-piercing that it was even more resounding than thunder.

When that voice rang out, the entire region started to tremble violently.
