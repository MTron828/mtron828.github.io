Chapter 4192 - A Late Night Visit

Chu Feng learned from the Golden Crane True Immortal that they were in a sealed world. There were not only powerful spirit formations outside, there were also powerful spirit formation beasts inside.

As the cultivations of the people there were much too weak, they were simply unable to leave. With no other alternative, they had ended up living there.

Some people had already been there for thousands of years.

Some had even been born and had died there of old age.

That was the reason why the Golden Crane True Immortal shook his head repeatedly after seeing Chu Feng.

He knew that Chu Feng’s talent in martial cultivation was extremely high, and that he had a boundless future ahead of him.

However, it was simply impossible for one to leave the sealed world after entering it. Chu Feng would end up being trapped there for the rest of his life.

That said, there was one thing that brought joy.

That was, all the people that had just entered the sealed world would have their cultivations and Cosmos Sacks temporarily sealed.

Their cultivations would be slowly recovered over time, and their Cosmos Sacks would also be unsealed.

However, the time it took for people to recover their cultivations and unseal their Cosmos Sacks differed.

Nevertheless, everyone had been able to regain their original cultivations.

The reason why their cultivations and Cosmos Sacks got sealed was most likely related to the special spirit formation gate.

Regardless of what the reason might be, Chu Feng was relieved to learn that his cultivation could return.

“Chu Feng, you shouldn’t be greedy.”

[1. I also have no idea what this was supposed to mean.]

“You might not know this, but everyone that has entered this place is unable to escape.”

“You have a great future ahead of you. You shouldn’t be wasting your time here,” the Golden Crane True Immortal sighed.

“Senior Golden Crane, please rest assured. I will think of a way to bring you out,” Chu Feng comforted him.

Even though he was unfamiliar with the sealed world, he was confident of being able to escape.

Chu Feng was now certain that the sealed world was where Zhuge Yuankong had left his inheritance and treasures.

It was only because the Golden Crane True Immortal and the others were too weak that they were unable to reach them.

That was why they believed it to be nothing more than a world that had trapped them.

Chu Feng on the other hand, was different. Not only was he an Utmost Exalted-level expert, he was also a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist.

As long as his cultivation and spirit power recovered, he would be able to attempt to solve the secrets of the sealed world.

“Oh, that’s right. Chu Feng, Old Poisonous Substance is also here,” the Golden Crane True Immortal said all of a sudden.

“Old Poisonous Substance? Who’s that?” asked Chu Feng.

“He’s that plain-clothed monk.”

“He helped you in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. Don’t you remember?” the Golden Crane True Immortal asked. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Oh, it’s that senior.”

“I remember. Of course I remember.”

Chu Feng became overjoyed.

He even stood up in excitement.

How could he not remember the plain-clothed old monk?

“Senior Golden Crane, where is that senior right now?” Chu Feng asked hurriedly.

The plain-clothed old monk was someone that Chu Feng had been acquainted with in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.

It was the plain-clothed old monk who had brought Chu Feng to Zhao Hong’s true body.

At that time, the plain-clothed old monk had taken away Zhao Hong’s Reincarnation Pearl.

And now, Zhao Hong had managed to fuse with her Reincarnation Divine Body. Yet, she was unable to gain the complete power of the Reincarnation Divine Body. The reason for that was because the Reincarnation Pearl that had been taken away from her contained a remnant of that power.

If Chu Feng was able to return the Reincarnation Pearl to Zhao Hong, she would be able to gain the complete Reincarnation Divine Body.

As such, he would naturally be happy to encounter the plain-clothed old monk.

Mainly, he was happy for Zhao Hong.

“That Old Poisonous Substance has wanted to leave this place the entire time. Thus, he has been searching for a way to leave the entire time.”

“This time around, he’s been out for a long while. Judging from the time, he should be returning soon,” said the Golden Crane True Immortal.

“Where did he go? I’ll go find him,” Chu Feng was impatient to see the plain-clothed old monk.

“Chu Feng, before your cultivation recovers, do not rush indiscriminately into action.”

“The region you’re in right now is safe. At the very most, there’ll be ferocious beasts hidden in the mountain forests. There are no other dangers here.”

“But, if you are to leave this region, you will encounter spirit formation beasts outside. Those spirit formation beasts are very powerful. They are not existences that you can contend against.”

“Thus, do not move about at random before your cultivation recovers. It is better that you stay here and wait for that Old Poisonous Substance’s return,” urged the Golden Crane True Immortal.

Chu Feng felt his words to be very reasonable.

It was true that he had no combat ability at that moment.

Else, he wouldn’t have been devoured by that weak ferocious beast.

“Oh, that’s right. Young friend Chu Feng, it’s been several years since we parted.”

“With young friend Chu Feng’s talent, you must’ve made rapid progress. Your cultivation must’ve increased greatly.”

“This old man is very curious as to what young friend Chu Feng’s... cultivation is right now?”

The Golden Crane True Immortal’s gaze changed as he asked that question.

After all, he had placed high hopes on Chu Feng back then. He believed that he would become an expert capable of charging out of their starfield.

“Senior, I...”

Right when Chu Feng began to answer, a series of shouts sounded from outside.

“Old Brother Golden Crane! Old Brother Golden Crane, are you here?!”

The Golden Crane True Immortal immediately walked towards the palace’s entrance upon hearing the voice. Seeing that, Chu Feng also followed suit.

When they got to the palace entrance, two figures stood outside.

One of them was an old man. That old man only had a few strands of hair left on his head. He was smiling. His smile revealed that he barely had any teeth left in his mouth. He was truly old.

Standing behind the old man was a young woman.

The woman was very good-looking. She appeared very intelligent and charming. She resembled the daughter of a distinguished family.

Once the entrance opened, both the old man and the young woman immediately turned their gazes onto Chu Feng.

“Oh my, this must be young friend Chu Feng, right?!” The old man shouted in excitement.

“Old Man Zhao, why are you so excited?”

The Golden Crane True Immortal cast a side-eye at the old man.

Then, he turned to smile at Chu Feng. “Chu Feng, allow me to introduce you.”

“This person here is Zhao Zisheng. He came from the All-heaven Starfield. He’s someone that I became acquainted with here.”

“Moreover, he’s one of the earliest ones here. He has been trapped here for thousands of years already. You can say he’s one of the elders of this place.”

“As for this young lady here, she is Zhao Zisheng’s little granddaughter. Her name is Zhao Menglu.”

The Golden Crane True Immortal introduced the two people to Chu Feng.

“I am Chu Feng. It is my pleasure to meet Senior Zhao and Miss Zhao,” Chu Feng stepped forward and greeted them respectfully.

Then, the four of them began to chat.

Through their conversation, Chu Feng learned that the Golden Crane True Immortal had mentioned him and his accomplishments to the people there on various occasions.

Old man Zhao was very interested in Chu Feng.

Even though he had been trapped there for thousands of years, he still believed that he would one day be able to leave.

He had been shouting about marrying his granddaughter Zhao Menglu to Chu Feng should he be able to leave one day.

Of course, it had only been a joke.

After all, he didn’t know Chu Feng. Even if he left the sealed world, he would have no idea where to find him. He had only made the joke purely out of his admiration for Chu Feng’s talent and desire to encourage his granddaughter.

However, to his great surprise, Chu Feng had actually entered the sealed world.
