Chapter 2713 - Rank Two True Immortal

“What happened? How come such a frightening divine lightning suddenly disappeared?”

The crowd were all unable to take their eyes away from the sky. They all had expressions of confusion and bewilderment on their faces.

“This couldn’t be an abnormal sign caused by someone’s breakthrough in cultivation, right? I’ve never seen such frightening divine lightning from a breakthrough before,” Someone said.

“That’s not for certain. Perhaps there is an expert undergoing closed-door training here. Perhaps it is that expert that evoked such an abnormal sign.”

“But, if someone managed to successfully reach a breakthrough, then that divine lightning would have definitely descended. Why is it that the divine lightning did not descend?”

“There could only be one explanation for that. The person that was attempting the breakthrough failed.”

The crowd began to make all kinds of speculations. Some determined that it was a calamity that had dissipated for some unknown reason.

Some determined that it was a possessor of Heavenly Bloodline undergoing a breakthrough in cultivation.

However, even those that felt that it was an abnormal sign caused by a Heavenly Bloodline possessor felt that the Heavenly Bloodline possessor had failed in their attempt.

They felt that that was the reason why the divine lightning did not successfully descend upon them.

The crowd argued among themselves about what that divine lightning really was for a very long time. They seemed to have forgotten their purpose for being there.

All their discussions were only about a single subject -- that frightening divine lightning.

Practically no one cared about the hunt.

At the moment when the crowd was still discussing among themselves, Chu Feng, who was inside the hunting ground, opened his eyes.

At that moment, Chu Feng had an excited expression on his face. Even his aura had changed.

Chu Feng had successfully made a breakthrough, becoming a rank two True Immortal.

“Amazing. You’ve actually managed to successfully reach a breakthrough. The divine lightning from earlier was quite frightening. However, you’ve managed to dissipate it so quickly this time around.”

“What is going on? Could it be because you’ve received better martial comprehension that allowed you to decrease the amount of time you needed to endure the Divine Tribulation’s lightning?” Eggy asked curiously.

Although Her Lady Queen had been in Chu Feng’s world spirit space the entire time, she was still capable of sensing how frightening the Divine Tribulation’s lightning was this time around.

That Divine Tribulation’s lightning was attacking Chu Feng frantically. It was truly terrifying.

Merely, the Divine Tribulation’s lightning this time around arrived very fast and left very fast.

That was the reason why Her Lady Queen was so puzzled.

“No, that shouldn’t be the case. The martial comprehension I’ve obtained this time was not even enough for me to be certain of being able to make a breakthrough,” Chu Feng himself was actually also very puzzled.

“Could this be what happens after you reach the True Immortal realm?” Her Lady Queen guessed.

“I don’t think that’s the case either,” Chu Feng shook his head.

“It couldn’t be that it’s because of this hunting ground, right?” Her Lady Queen said.

“How could that be?” Chu Feng shook his head with a smile on his face.

“How couldn’t it be? What if this hunting ground is not merely an isolated space for conducting the hunt, but also a treasure capable of resisting the power of Self-Punishment Mysterious Techniques like Li Yue’er’s umbrella, only much stronger?” Her Lady Queen said with a beaming smile.

Although she said those words, she was clearly joking around.

She also did not think the hunting ground would possess that sort of ability.

“This time was truly different from before. The power of the Divine Tribulation’s lightning was extremely strong. However, it disappeared very quickly.”

“That said, I will know exactly what is going on once I attempt to breakthrough to rank three True Immortal,” Chu Feng said.

Chu Feng was no longer just happy. Instead, he was overjoyed.

He simply had not even possessed any certainty of success in his breakthrough attempt this time around. Yet, he had managed to succeed.

Although his success this time around was a bit different from before, it remained that he had succeeded in reaching a breakthrough to rank two True Immortal.

With his new level of cultivation and various abilities, Chu Feng was now capable of contending against Chu Xianshuo.

“Indeed. No matter what, you’ve managed to obtain what you wanted.”

“Likely, at this moment, everyone outside the hunting ground is pondering exactly who managed to reach a breakthrough and give rise to the Divine Tribulation’s lightning,” Her Lady Queen said with a beaming smile.

Hearing her words, the smile on Chu Feng’s face grew even denser.

However, the two of them had no idea that while the Divine Tribulation’s lightning did appear in the sky, it did not successfully strike down in the eyes of the people outside.

As a result, the people outside naturally had no idea that there was a Heavenly Bloodline possessor that managed to successfully reach a breakthrough inside the hunting ground.

......

Finally, the tenth day of the hunt arrived.

Chu Xianshuo, who’d been sitting on the viewing platform the entire time, finally stood up.

“Look! Young master Chu Xianshuo has stood up. Could he be planning to enter the hunting ground?”

Originally, the crowd was still discussing the divine lightning that had suddenly disappeared. However, once Chu Xianshuo stood up, the crowd all cast their eyes to him.

At that moment, the Immortal Armament Villa’s younger generations also stood up. They said to Chu Xianshuo, “Brother Xianshuo, you must not disappoint us.”

“Rest assured. As long as I enter the hunting ground, this hunt’s first place will definitely be mine.”

Chu Xianshuo had a smile of confidence on his face.

“Little friend Chu Xianshuo, the hunting ground this year is different from before. It is very dangerous inside. You must be extra careful,” A black-gowned old man with long fiery red hair said to Chu Xianshuo enthusiastically.

Although he was telling Chu Xianshuo to be careful, his words were actually said in a warning-like manner. He was trying to tell Chu Xianshuo not to be overly confident, or else he would end up suffering.

“It’s that pleasant surprise you all have prepared, right? It seems that is not only a pleasant surprise, but also a danger,” Chu Xianshuo said.

“Hahaha...” The old man laughed lightly. However, he didn’t say anything.

“However, I can tell you with certainty that no matter how dangerous of a pleasant surprise it might be, I, Chu Xianshuo, will still be able to obtain it,” Chu Xianshuo spoke in a very confident manner.

“You will not be able to obtain that pleasant surprise.”

Right at that moment, an old man wearing the same sort of black gown and a long head of white hair walked over in midair.

“We pay our respects to Lord Villa Master,” Upon seeing the old man, everyone in the Immortal Armament Villa immediately bowed to him respectfully.

Even that fiery red-haired old man was no exception.

The reason for that was because that white-haired old man was the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master.

“Villa Master, did you... manage to succeed in your closed-door training?” The fiery red-haired old man asked with a happy expression on his face.

He had actually already managed to sense the change in the Villa Master’s aura. He was merely asking for confirmation.

“Mn, I’ve entered closed-door training for half a year, and finally succeeded,” The Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master replied with a faint smile on his face.

Although it was a very faint smile, one could tell from his eyes that he was extremely happy to have successfully reached a breakthrough.

After all, after reaching his level of cultivation, reaching a breakthrough in cultivation was an extremely difficult task.

He had failed many times. This success could be said to have been obtained through much difficulty.

“Congratulations Lord Villa Master,” At that moment, the Immortal Armament Villa’s crowd all started to congratulate their Villa Master.

The increase in the cultivation of their Villa Master was a happy occasion for the entire Immortal Armament Villa. Naturally, they would be overjoyed.

In fact, after finding out that their Villa Master had managed to reach a breakthrough, the entire Immortal Armament Villa burst into an uproar.

Even the people who were not part of the Immortal Armament Villa started to spiritedly discuss the matter.

They all knew that the position the Immortal Armament Villa held would likely rise again.

At that moment when everyone was overjoyed, that fiery red-haired old man suddenly took note of a crystal ball in the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master’s hand.

That crystal ball was silvery white and flickering with light. The scenery inside was changing nonstop. It was as if it contained a world within. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Lord Villa Master, why did you say that little friend Chu Xianshuo would not be able to obtain the pleasant surprise?” The fiery red-haired old man asked.

He knew very well that crystal ball was no ordinary ball. Instead, the crystal ball was linked to the hunting ground.

The crystal ball possessed another distinctive name. It was called a Mirror Pearl.

That Mirror Pearl was capable of clearly seeing the situation inside the hunting ground.

Since the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master had made such a declaration, it was clear that he had already seen the Mirror Pearl, and understood what the current situation inside the hunting ground was.

Likely, the situation inside the hunting ground was detrimental toward Chu Xianshuo.
