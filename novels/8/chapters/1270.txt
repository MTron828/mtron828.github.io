MGA: Chapter 1271 - Utter Disgrace

Bai Yunxiao and the others were trapped in that bloody cage. Although there were no obvious bruises on their bodies, they were displaying extremely painful expressions. It was evident that they were receiving enormous pressure at this moment.

Among the six of them, the one in the best condition was Bai Yunxiao. He was waving his fists around and pounding on the cage. However, it was of no use, as his current fists were a clear contradiction to the powerful might that he had displayed earlier; they were extremely weak and seemed very powerless.

As for Tao Xiangyu and the others, their state was much more unsightly. At this moment, they did not even have the strength to resist, and could only sit cross-legged within the cage and wholeheartedly resist the pressure that had engulfed their bodies.

When the crowd looked to the Monstrous Dragon Beasts, they saw that not only were they emitting ominous glints from their eyes, their frightening mouths seemed to even be smiling. It was as if they were looking at a tasty meal sitting before them and ridiculing the futile struggle of their food.

“Heavens, how did things turn out like this?”

When they saw this scene, the surrounding people were all shocked. They had never imagined that Bai Yunxiao and the others who had been massacring the Monstrous Dragon Beasts would be instantly trapped like turtles in a jar.

As for the disciples of the Cyanwood Mountain, they felt an enormous amount of embarrassment. Earlier, they had been smiling and laughing complacently. Yet now, they could not even force themselves to smile.

That was because the geniuses that they were so proud of earlier had been captured by the animals that they had been ridiculing.

Such a sudden and enormous change caused the crowd to all be taken aback. Some even felt this to be surreal and could not believe their eyes.

Wasn’t this a show of carnage put on by the Cyanwood Mountain’s disciples? With the current state of affairs, what exactly was going on?

“What an amazing technique. That cage is extremely powerful. It is no ordinary formation. How did they manage to set up such a powerful formation in such a short amount of time?” At this moment, even the world spiritist genius Sima Ying was amazed.

As she was very proficient in world spirit techniques, she was able to tell that the cage was, while not a world spirit formation, a special sort of formation. That formation was extremely powerful and was capable of binding the strength and power of Bai Yunxiao and the others, making it so that no matter how strong they were, they would not be able to have access to their strength.

However, the more powerful a formation technique was, the longer it would take to set up. It was obvious that this formation had been set up and activated in an instant, else it would have been impossible for it to be able to cover Bai Yunxiao and the others and trap them. Thus, she was shocked, and wanted to know exactly how these Monstrous Dragon Beasts managed to accomplish such a feat.

“It’s not that their speed of setting up the formation was very fast. Instead, they had already set it up beforehand. It was a trap to begin with,” Chu Feng explained.

“Already set up beforehand?” Sima Ying became even more puzzled.

“That is a Bloodline Formation Technique,” Right at this moment, Bai Suyan suddenly spoke. She began to explain, “The blood of the Monstrous Dragon Beasts contains an extremely rich Bloodline power. The more concentrated their blood is, the stronger their Bloodline power will be.”

“Earlier, they deliberately allowed those Monstrous Dragon Beasts to be killed. Their purpose was for the blood of those Monstrous Dragon Beasts to engulf the lake so as to form an enormous trap that would catch Bai Yunxiao and the others unprepared.”

“That’s actually the case? They sacrificed their kin in order to bring down their enemy? Isn’t this a bit too cruel?” Hearing those words, Bai Ruochen’s expression slightly changed. She was shocked by the method employed by the Monstrous Dragon Beasts.

Even though the outcome of this battle was extremely crucial to the battle between the two parties, it was still extremely cruel for one party to sacrifice the lives of their comrades in order to win. At the very least, it was not a method that she was capable of using.

“Even though this method is very cruel, its result is extremely good. The Monstrous Dragon Beasts have won this battle.”

“Since they were able to obtain victory, then some necessary sacrifices should be acceptable,” Bai Suyan said.

“Heh, who cares if it’s cruel or not cruel, it remains that those Cyanwood Mountain disciples have disgraced themselves now. This lady is feeling pleased from the bottom of her heart.”

“The Cyanwood Mountain has racked their brains to plan and conduct this dragon grade mission, all for the sake of allowing everyone to experience the powerful strength of their disciples.”

“Yet now, the disciples that were tasked with massacring the Monstrous Dragon Beasts have instead become the target of the massacre. Look at the expressions of those Cyanwood Mountain elders. They were laughing and smiling so happily earlier, yet now they are unable to smile at all. They have truly and utterly disgraced themselves. Hehe...” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Sima Ying’s laughter was one filled with joy. It could be seen that she was extremely satisfied to be able to see this.

Right at this moment, the Monstrous Dragon Beast king spoke. “People of the Cyanwood Mountain, listen carefully. If you all do not give us a way to live, then we will definitely not let you have an easy time either.”

“All of you, withdraw from this place immediately and allow us to leave here. If you do, we’ll release these little bastards. If you don’t, we will dismember them into ten thousand pieces and turn them into piles of blood,”

“Monstrous Dragon Beast king, do not think that you can escape here alive today. Release our disciples right away, and I’ll consider leaving you an intact corpse.”

Suddenly, a management elder of the Punishment Department stood forward. His aura was extremely powerful, and his tone was very overbearing. He did not put the Monstrous Dragon Beasts in his eyes at all.

Seeing this, the Monstrous Dragon Beast king coldly threatened him. “Old bastard, do you truly want these six little bastards to be buried with us?”

“If you have the ability, I wish you to try to see if you can make them be buried with you all,” That elder spoke again. “Don’t you think that I can’t tell that you’ve used a despicable method to temporarily suppress our disciples’ strength. While it is true that you managed to trap them, their lives are not something that you can take as you wish.”

Hearing those words, the gaze of the Monstrous Dragon Beast king began to flicker. He had begun to panic. He had never expected that his trump card would be seen through. Indeed, he was incapable of taking the lives of Bai Yunxiao and the others right away.

“Jeajeajeajea.” However, after a moment of silence, the Monstrous Dragon Beast king actually began to laugh savagely. “So what if that is the case? If you have the ability, then come and kill me. However, are you shameless enough to do that?”

“Your Cyanwood Mountian has deliberately sealed off my clan and invited all these people to enjoy the show. Isn’t it all so that you could allow these six little bastards to fully display their capabilities by massacring us so as to display the greatness of your Cyanwood Mountain?”

“However, I’ll tell you all right now. Your Cyanwood Mountain’s little bastards are too weak. They are not qualified to massacre our clan. If it weren’t for you old bastards protecting them, they would be the ones massacred by our clan instead.”

“Come, old bastards, attack us. I admit that I am no match for the lot of you.”

“However, even if you are to wipe our clan out, the ones losing this time are still all of you.”

“You...” Hearing those words, that management elder began to frown deeply and clenched his fists tightly. That was because the Monstrous Dragon Beast king had struck him right at the heart with his words.

As a management elder of the Punishment Department, he possessed matchless power. If he wanted to exterminate this bunch of Monstrous Dragon beasts, it would be extremely easy for him to do so.

However, he simply could not do that. If he was to do it, he would be admitting that their Cyanwood Mountain’s disciples did not have the ability to defeat these Monstrous Dragon Beasts and that only they, the older generation, could accomplish that feat.

If that was the case, then what would be the purpose of the gathering of all these people here today?

Wouldn’t this be equivalent to telling everyone that the Cyanwood Mountain’s disciples had failed their dragon grade mission and would have to have their elders wipe their asses?

If that were to happen, then it would be exactly as the Monstrous Dragon Beast king said, they would truly be the ones losing, the ones being disgraced.

When they saw this scene, practically all of the expressions of the Cyanwood Mountain’s elders and disciples turned ugly.

If many people were still wishfully thinking that Bai Yunxiao and the others would be able to make a comeback earlier, then after hearing the conversation between the management elder from the Punishment Department and the Monstrous Dragon Beast king, their final hope was crushed.

Bai Yunxiao and the others had truly become the Monstrous Dragon Beasts’ prisoners, and would need the management elders to come and deal with the aftermath.

Even if the management elders possessed the capability to rescue them, possessed the ability to easily exterminate this bunch of Monstrous Dragon Beasts, it remained an unchangeable fact that Bai Yunxiao and the others had been subdued by the Monstrous Dragon Beasts.

At this moment, while the disciples were still relatively fine, the elders began to sigh and shake their heads nonstop.

They knew very well that although none of the people present were vocally insulting the Cyanwood Mountain or belittling Bai Yunxiao and the others, it did not mean that they were not insulting the Cyanwood Mountain and belittling Bai Yunxiao and the others in their hearts.

It was merely that they did not dare to insult the Cyanwood Mountain right in front of them. However, they were already doing it in their hearts, and enjoying the mockery presented by the Cyanwood Mountain.

There were even some among the observers that felt extremely overjoyed by this. That was because the Cyanwood Mountain had truly become the laughingstock this time around and utterly lost all face.
