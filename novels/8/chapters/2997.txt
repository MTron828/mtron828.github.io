Chapter 2997 - May I Kill Them?

“Little brother Chu Feng, how can we not trust you?”

“That’s right, if it wasn’t for you, we wouldn’t have been able to find this place at all.”

“Little brother Chu Feng, you’re overthinking things.”

Once Chu Feng said those words, the crowd immediately revealed artificial smiles.

“Since that’s the case, I will enter first. Everyone, wait for my news,” Chu Feng said.

Right at that moment, Chu Zhiyuan suddenly said, “Wait, little brother Chu Feng, I will enter with you.”

He then added, “It’s been very difficult for you to bring us here. We’re a group. Since we will be enjoying blessings together, we will naturally have to suffer hardships together too. I will enter with you. If we really end up encountering problems, we can look after one another.”

Chu Zhiyuan’s words were spoken in a righteous manner. It was as if he were a very affectionate and loyal individual. Should it be any normal person, they would likely be moved to tears upon hearing those words.

However, Chu Feng was not moved in the slightest. He knew that Chu Zhiyuan was merely worried that he would try to seize all of the treasures for himself.

He could be said to be an extreme hypocrite.

"Sure, let’s enter together then," Chu Feng said.

Right at that moment, Chu Ruoshi said, "I’m coming too."

"I feel what big brother Chu Zhiyuan said to be very correct. Since we’ll be enjoying the benefits together, we will naturally have to endure hardships together with little brother Chu Feng. I will also enter together with you all."

"Me too."

Right after Chu Ruoshi voiced her desire to enter, two more people also voiced their desire to accompany Chu Feng.

Those two people did not possess any conflict with Chu Feng. Judging from their appearance, it seemed that the two of them were truly planning to endure hardships together with Chu Feng. However, Chu Feng still felt that they’d only decided to accompany him because they were feeling unassured with him entering alone.

As for Chu Haoyan and Chu Huanyu, the two of them did not say anything this time around. Likely, they felt that it was sufficient for Chu Ruoshi to follow Chu Feng. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Of course, it was also possible that the two of them were afraid. After all, no one would know what happened inside. If Chu Feng were to try to kill them, they would not even know how they died.

"Little brother Chu Feng, just allow us to enter together with you. Like that, we will be able to look after one another," Seeing that Chu Feng was quiet, Chu Zhiyuan spoke again.

"Sure, let’s enter together," Chu Feng did not refuse them. Firstly, Chu Feng was not afraid of what tricks they might try. After all, with Her Lady Queen with him, they would simply be no match for him.

Furthermore, since they had already said it like that, if Chu Feng still refused to bring them along, he would appear guilty of trying to hog all of the treasures for himself.

Right at that moment, Chu Lingxi said, “Chu Feng, I’m coming too.”

“You should stay here. There’s enough people coming along already. If too many people come at once, I will not be able to handle it should something really happen,” Chu Feng said.

“I alone shouldn’t make any difference, no?” Chu Lingxi was very determined.

Seeing this, Chu Feng walked over to Chu Lingxi and moved toward her ear. Using a tone that only she could hear, he said, “I am not joking around. It is truly very dangerous inside. I do not care if they want to throw their lives away. But you are different. I cannot disregard your life. You should just wait out here for my news.”

“Eh...” Chu Lingxi was startled momentarily upon hearing those words. However, in the end, she nodded and said, “Okay then.”

“Let’s go in,” Seeing that Chu Lingxi had agreed, Chu Feng turned around and led the way into the narrow pathway.

Chu Ruoshi, Chu Zhiyuan and those two male Chu Heavenly Clansmen also followed closely behind Chu Feng.

At that moment, the five of them were walking along the narrow pathway, one behind another.

No, to be exact, there were six people.

The reason for that was because Her Lady Queen was following behind Chu Feng.

Her Lady Queen was worried that Chu Ruoshi and Chu Zhiyuan might try to attack Chu Feng. Thus, she did not return to her World Spirit Space. Instead, she continued to follow Chu Feng.

As they walked in the cave, Chu Zhiyuan asked curiously, “Little brother Chu Feng, I am very curious. What did you say to little sister Lingxi to actually make her listen to you? You should know that little sister Lingxi’s personality is one where ordinary people will not be able to persuade her.”

Chu Feng turned around and said, “It’s very simple, I was merely being sincere.”

Chu Feng was mocking Chu Ruoshi and Chu Zhiyuan. After all, the two of them were not sincere toward him at all.

That said, Chu Zhiyuan appeared to be very unaccepting of Chu Feng’s answer.

“Little brother Chu Feng and Lingxi’s relationship seems to be very extraordinary,” Chu Zhiyuan said with a smile.

“It’s not as complicated as you think it to be,” Chu Feng returned a faint smile of his own. Then, he continued forward. Chu Feng’s mannerisms were very cold. It could be seen that he did not wish to deal with Chu Zhiyuan excessively.

Faced with such an attitude from Chu Feng, there was also nothing Chu Zhiyuan could do. He continued to have a forced smile on his face. Merely, a trace of coldness flashed through his eyes.

Although that coldness in his eyes flashed past instantly, Her Lady Queen suddenly turned around to look at him.

At the moment Her Lady Queen looked at him, Chu Zhiyuan suddenly felt as if he had fallen into an incomparably cold ice-pit. He immediately felt his hair stand on end, and he began to tremble with fear.

“Young lady, why are you looking at me like that?” Chu Zhiyuan asked with a forced smile.

“Humph,” Her Lady Queen let out a cold snort before turning around. She was disinclined to even talk to Chu Zhiyuan.

Hearing Chu Zhiyuan addressing Her Lady Queen, Chu Feng immediately turned around. He was afraid that Chu Zhiyuan was bullying Her Lady Queen. However, upon seeing Chu Zhiyuan’s flustered face and Her Lady Queen’s calm look, Chu Feng knew that even if something did happen, Her Lady Queen was definitely not being taken advantage of.

However, even though that was the case, Chu Feng still secretly sent a voice transmission to Her Lady Queen, “Eggy, what’s wrong?”

“It’s nothing. Oh, no, there’s something I need to ask you,” Her Lady Queen replied through the voice transmission.

“Milady Queen, what is it?” Chu Feng asked.

“If they are to try to kill you, may this Queen kill them?” Her Lady Queen asked.

Hearing those words, Chu Feng smiled. Then he said, “Of course you may.”

“This Queen understands. Well then, there’s nothing else. You just have to concentrate on leading the way,” Her Lady Queen said with a beaming smile. Her joyous expression seemed as if she was very impatient to kill Chu Zhiyuan and the others.

Seeing such an expression from Her Lady Queen, Chu Feng’s smile grew more intense.
