Chapter 5611: Someone Familiar

“We don’t have to head there?” Tuoba Yijian and Tuoba Tianxue looked at Chu Feng.

“There are two roads before us. One is to head to that mountain, but the rewards are limited based on what I have observed. The alternative is to use our tokens. These tokens are an entrance too, but we’ll have to activate them. It’ll be tougher, but the rewards are higher too,” Chu Feng said.

Tuoba Yijian took out an exquisite compass with a flick of his wrist. The compass emanated an extremely old aura that indicated that it was a treasure from the Immemorial Era.

“Is this the compass that allowed him to reach this boulder before me?” Chu Feng could tell that the compass was an invaluable treasure harnessing immense power. It was likely to be even stronger than his Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk.

The compass’ needle was wavering among three points, namely Chu Feng, Tuoba Yijian, and Tuoba Tianxue.

“These tokens are really entrances,” Tuoba Yijian exclaimed in delight. He turned to Chu Feng and asked, “Do you know how to decipher the tokens?”

“Channel your consciousness into your token; there should be a trial awaiting you there. However, I don’t think that we’ll be able to cooperate on the trial. We’ll have to clear it with our own capability,” Chu Feng said.

“Let’s give it a try, but let’s not enter the entrance if you figure out the way to clear the trial. Return here and share your insights with the others instead,” Tuoba Yijian said.

“I suspect that we’ll be pulled into the entrance as soon as we clear the trial, but I’ll try my best to return here if possible,” Chu Feng said as he inspected the token.

A moment later, his consciousness was pulled into another dimension reminiscent of a labyrinth. There was a huge incense stick floating above the labyrinth, which most likely served as a timer. He had roughly two hours to clear the labyrinth judging by the rate it was burning down.

The labyrinth was harder than Chu Feng had expected. He failed to figure a way out of the labyrinth before the incense stick burned down, and his consciousness was sent back to his body.

As soon as he opened his eyes, he saw Tuoba Yijian and Tuoba Tianxue staring at the tokens in their hands, but their bodies were stiffened. Clearly, they had projected their consciousness into their tokens too.

Not too long later, the two of them began to move.

Tuoba Yijian turned to Chu Feng and asked, “Did you enter a labyrinth with a time limit of two hours too?”

“I did, but I failed the trial,” Chu Feng replied.

“That’s fine. I failed the trial too, but I think we’re able to attempt it again. Why don’t we share what we found first?” Tuoba Yijian asked.

“Sure,” Chu Feng replied.

He constructed a formation to share his findings from the labyrinth. He also drew out the path that he thought was the right one.

“That’s not right. Why are our labyrinths different?” Tuoba Yijian said with a frown.

Weng!

Tuoba Tianxue used his martial power to draw out the labyrinth. His mapping of the labyrinth was incomplete, but it was clearly different from Chu Feng’s.

“This is the one I saw earlier,” Tuoba Tianxue said.Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“This is bad. Our labyrinths are different. We can’t exchange insights like that,” Tuoba Yijian said with a frown.

“Let me give it another try,” Chu Feng said as he projected his consciousness into his token.

To his astonishment, the labyrinth he entered this time around was different from the one he had entered. It didn’t match the ones Tuoba Tianxue and Tuoba Yijian drew too. It would appear that the labyrinth would change every time they entered it, rendering whatever they learned from the previous time useless.

“I don’t believe that it’s impossible.”

This challenge didn’t shake Chu Feng’s confidence; if anything, it only made him even more determined to pull it through.

Two hours passed in a flash.

Tuoba Yijian and Tuoba Tianxue regained consciousness.

“This is too much! The labyrinth is different from before!” Tuoba Yijian exclaimed.

“It’s the same for me too,” Tuoba Tianxue replied.

“This is too difficult. I don’t think I can clear it. I’ll be counting on you for this,” Tuoba Yijian said.

“I don’t think I can do it either.” Tuoba Tianxue shook his head.

Tuoba Yijian turned to Chu Feng and said, “Brother Chu Feng, is it the same for you too? Did you enter a brand new labyrinth?”

Much to Tuoba Yijian’s surprise, Chu Feng didn’t answer.

“Chu Feng isn’t out yet? He went in earlier than us!”

Just then, Chu Feng transformed into a whiff of smoke and seeped into his token. Then, his token vanished into thin air.

“My gosh. Did he succeed?” Tuoba Yijian was taken aback.

“He’s incredible,” Tuoba Tianxue said with a sigh. He was certain that Chu Feng had gotten in.

“He’s indeed formidable,” Tuoba Yijian remarked with a sigh.

“Hm?”

All of a sudden, the two of them frowned upon sensing something.

“Damn it! Why now?” Tuoba Yijian frowned worriedly.

“We knew that they would discover our absence when we came out. What are you so surprised by,” Tuoba Tianxue said.

“I find it a pity that they found us so early. Just a little longer, and we would have been able to explore the Nine Realms Immortal Region. How annoying!” Tuoba Yijian was displeased, but he quickly thought of something and turned to Tuoba Tianxue. “Since we have been found anyway, why don’t we complete our exploration before heading back?”

“You’re being too optimistic. The punishment will be lighter if we return right now,” Tuoba Tianxue said.

“But this is the Nine Realms Immortal Region. It’s a rare opportunity! We have been trapped there from a young age, and it wasn’t easy for us to get out. Tianxue, let’s play a little longer.” Tuoba Yijian looked at Tuoba Tianxue with pleading eyes, as if the latter was the only one who could decide for them both.

“I’m heading back. You do whatever you want,” Tuoba Tianxue replied before leaving the area. He headed not for the mountain peak but another direction, presumably where he had identified as the exit.

“Seriously…” Tuoba Yijian was indignant, but he rose into the air and chased after Tuoba Tianxue too.

Meanwhile, Chu Feng had entered another dimension, where he found himself floating above a clearwater lake that spanned the size of an ocean.

“Is that the water of the Immortal Stream?” Eggy asked.

“Looks like it,” Chu Feng replied as he heaved a sigh of relief.

“Brother Chu Feng?!”

Chu Feng suddenly heard an awfully familiar voice behind him that jolted his heart. It was someone whom he recognized. He quickly turned around and took a look…

Someone he knew was indeed standing not too far away, staring at him with a look of surprise.
