Chapter 2372 - Healing

Being guided by Tian Yi, Chu Feng soon arrived at a cave. Inside the cave was a woman.

The woman’s age was similar to Tian Yi’s. However, she had a younger appearance than Tian Yi; her physical appearance was that of a pretty young woman.

Most importantly, this woman’s cultivation was stronger than Tian Yi’s, she was a rank three Half Martial Ancestor.

Merely, at that moment, that woman’s complexion was pale like paper. She appeared to be in very weak health. Furthermore, green veined patterns filled her eyes.

She was injured. Not only was she physically injured, she had also been poisoned.

“Tian Yi, who is he?” Upon seeing Chu Feng, the woman revealed an alarmed expression.

“Lil Yue, don’t worry. This person is an expert that I’ve requested assistance from. He will be able to treat your injuries,” Tian Yi walked over to the woman and helped her up.

Seeing these two individuals’ intimate appearance, Chu Feng was able to guess that the two of them should be lovers.

“Tian Yi, I have never seen this person before. Could it be that he is a trespasser?” However, that woman who Tian Yi addressed as Lil Yue started to size Chu Feng up in a cautious manner. She revealed an even more alarmed expression.

“That’s right, he is indeed an outsider. But...”

“Have him leave. I don’t need a trespasser treating my injuries,” The woman interrupted Tian Yi before he could finish.

“I am able to cure your injury,” Chu Feng did not want to waste time, nor was he concerned about whether or not the woman consented to him curing her injuries. As such, he walked toward the woman and grabbed her arm.

“Scram! I don’t need your treatment,” The woman waved her sleeve and unleashed her rank three Half Martial Ancestor aura. She wanted to forcibly push Chu Feng aside.

However, after she unleashed her aura, she only managed to push aside Tian Yi, who she had no intention of pushing aside, yet she was unable to push Chu Feng, who she wanted to push, aside.

“You...” At that moment, the gaze with which the woman looked at Chu Feng changed. She had realized that the man before her was no ordinary character, that he was someone with strength superior to her own. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Sit there obediently,” As Chu Feng spoke, he unleashed his oppressive might and forced the woman to sit on the ground.

Then, regardless of the woman’s reaction, Chu Feng began to set up a healing formation that enveloped her.

“This?!!!!”

When streams of Immortal-level spirit power began to be released from Chu Feng’s body and gather to form a dazzling spirit formation, both Tian Yi and that woman revealed stupefied expressions.

“What powerful spirit power. I have simply never seen anything like this before. Could it be that you’re... you’re a legendary Immortal-cloak World Spiritist?” Tian Yi and that woman exclaimed with shocked and admiring tones.

As for Chu Feng, he did not care about their current shock or admiration. Instead, he continued to wholeheartedly focus on operating his spirit formation to cure that woman.

In merely a short moment, Chu Feng completely cured that woman’s injuries.

“Senior, earlier, this Ma Yue had eyes, but failed to recognize Mount Tai, and offended you. I hope that senior will not take offense to my mistakes,” After her injuries were cured, that Ma Yue actually knelt onto the ground and respectfully bowed to Chu Feng. She had an ashamed expression on her face. She was feeling shame and regret for acting rudely toward Chu Feng earlier.

“It is not wrong to be on guard. Come, stand up,” Chu Feng waved his sleeve, and a gentle power lifted Ma Yue back up.

“Senior,” Right at that moment, that Tian Yi also knelt on the ground. Furthermore, he had an ashamed and apologetic expression all over his face.

Chu Feng felt that something was amiss, thus he asked with a serious tone, “Tian Yi, what are you doing?”

“Senior, this junior lied to you about one matter,” Tian Yi said.

“Could it be that you do not know the location of the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone?” Chu Feng asked.

“No, this junior does know its location. Merely... it is said that the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone is unmovable. I fear that senior will have come in vain,” Tian Yi said.

“There’s actually such a saying?” Hearing what Tian Yi said, Chu Feng’s expression changed. However, he soon helped Tian Yi back up. He said, “Tian Yi, you merely need to show me the way. Whether or not I am able to obtain the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone is my business. It is unrelated to you.”

“Very well. Senior, please follow me. I will bring you over right away,” As Tian Yi spoke, he planned to leave.

“Wait, I’m coming too,” Ma Yue said.

“Lil Yue, your injuries have only just been healed. Are you planning to find Zhou Zongzhi for revenge right away?” Tian Yi asked.

“Rest assured. Senior’s world spirit techniques are extremely powerful. I have been completely healed,” Ma Yue said.

“Okay then,” Tian Yi nodded. Then, he said to Chu Feng, “Senior, please follow me.”

After Tian Yi finished saying those words, he began to proceed toward the depths of the Hundred Refinements Stage whilst Chu Feng and Ma Yue followed behind him.

............

The Hundred Refinements Stage was guarded by the guardian clan. The headquarters of the guardian clan was constructed outside of the Hundred Refinements Stage.

This was a location that outsiders would not be able to discover. It was a mysterious palace that those not from the guardian clan would not be able to open.

At that moment, the guardian clan’s management elders were gathered in the palace hall of that palace. Those experts stood to either side in an orderly manner.

After guarding that place for many generations through the tens of thousands of years, the people from the guardian clan came to possess an extremely unique temperament. If their temperaments must be described, then it could be said that they were stubborn. Yet, it could also be said that they were utterly loyal to their responsibilities.

At the end of the palace hall was a throne. This throne was incomparably bright. It was even more dazzling than the thrones of rulers.

However, sitting on top of such a magnificent throne was an ordinary and plain-looking old man. The clothes that the old man wore were the same as that of the others from the guardian clan.

He wore a blue gown. The design of the gown greatly resembled that of ordinary Daoist gowns. Furthermore, there was a special symbol on both the back and the chest area of the gown. The symbol seemed to be the word ‘guardian.’

Actually, the gowns had originally been all the same. However, it might be that the old man had worn his gown for so long that it appeared to be a lot more old-fashioned when compared to the gowns of others.

However, even though the gown appeared to be old-fashioned, it was very neat and tidy. In fact, there was not the slightest bit of damage on the gown.

As for that simple-looking old man, he was the guardian clan’s current clan chief.

At that moment, the clan chief and all of the elders present had their eyes focused on a single person. That person was not a member of their guardian clan. Instead, he was Kong Zheng.

Merely, at that time, there was another person standing beside Kong Zheng. This person was called Hu Xuanyi.

This Hu Xuanyi was precisely the person Kong Zheng had mentioned to Chu Feng, the person who owed Kong Zheng’s grandfather an enormous favor.

“Putt~~~”

Suddenly, Hu Xuanyi kneeled on the ground and bowed respectfully to the guardian clan’s clan chief. He said, “Lord Clan Chief, the Kong Heavenly Clan has shown grace toward me. This subordinate once promised them that I would do anything the Kong Heavenly Clan requested of me if it is something that I can accomplish.”

“Today, little friend Kong Zheng’s intention to enter the Hundred Refinements Stage is indeed against our guardian clan’s rules. But...”

“Xuanyi, speak no more,” However, before Hu Xuanyi could finish, the guardian clan’s clan chief waved his hand.

Then, the guardian clan’s clan chief turned to Kong Zheng and said, “Little friend, it is not that I refuse to allow you to enter, merely, by the fact that you plan to obtain the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone after entering, it means that even if I am to let you in, you will have to return empty-handed.”

“Senior Clan Chief, could it be that the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone has been sealed by you all?”

“But, why have I heard that the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone was placed there without any special protection from spirit formations or guards?” Kong Zheng asked.

Kong Zheng was implying that he knew about the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone, and was telling the guardian clan to not bother to deceive him.

“Indeed. The Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone was placed in the Hundred Refinements Stage without any special protection. However, the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone is truly special; it is impossible for ordinary people to remove it,” The guardian clan’s clan chief said.

“It would seem that Senior Clan Chief is looking down on this Kong Zheng,” Kong Zheng sneered.

“It is not that I am looking down on you. Rather, there is a reason for it,” The guardian clan’s clan chief said.

“Regardless of what reason there might be, as long as you allow me to enter, I will definitely be able to obtain the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone.”

“Merely, if I am able to obtain the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone, I hope that Senior Clan Chief will not prevent me from bringing it away. After all, this matter concerns the life and death of my elder brother,” Kong Zheng said with enormous confidence.
