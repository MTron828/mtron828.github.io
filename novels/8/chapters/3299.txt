Chapter 3299 - The Two Beautiful Women

“For the sake of befriending them, your Wuma Heavenly Clan has truly invested greatly. Never have I ever witnessed your clan chief acting this generous before,” the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

The Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Supreme Elder sighed, and had a very helpless look on his face as he said, “Don’t bring it up.”

“It just so happened that the various guests were all present when we received the news of the Ancient Era’s remnant. We thought that even if it was a remnant, it wouldn’t be an extraordinary one that appears once in a lifetime. Thus, we decided to bring them along to the remnant with us.”

“You also know about our Scarlet Province Upper Realm; never have we ever had such an extraordinary Ancient Era’s remnant appear here.”

“However, to our great surprise, the Ancient Era’s remnant this time around was very different, so very extraordinary. Truth be told, our Lord Clan Chief is regretting it enormously.”

“However, what was said cannot be retrieved. Even if he wanted to back out of his promise, he wouldn’t be able to.” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Hearing those words, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief had a change in his expression. He was forcibly restraining his laughter.

Precisely because he knew the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief very well, he knew that he must be feeling so much regret that his intestines had all turned green, so much regret that he even wanted to kill himself.

It was only because the people that were present were all people with extraordinary status. Otherwise, that old codger would definitely go back upon his promise.

Imagining the grief-filled expression of that old codger, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief wanted to laugh very badly. After all, that old codger was simply an extreme miser.

Because of that, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was also feeling impatient to have a look at his current appearance.

“Since they’re able to enjoy the treasures in that remnant too, those people are likely exerting themselves and assisting in the opening of that remnant’s spirit formation, no?” The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief asked.

“That’s right,” the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Supreme Elder nodded. Then, he added, “Actually, it is thanks to the Li Heavenly Clan that we were able to request the help of Liangqiu Chengfeng.”

Hearing those words, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief nodded gently. However, his gaze turned deep and profound.

With how much the remnant was being focused on, with how even the Li Heavenly Clan was sparing no effort to help open the remnant, that was definitely not good for him and Chu Feng.

As the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Supreme Elder and the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief continued to chat, they arrived at the Multitude Spirits Mountain Range.

The Multitude Spirits Mountain Range was very large. Whilst it was a beautiful place, there were not many cultivation resources there. Generally, no one would bother to visit. It could be said to be one of the few undisturbed places in the Scarlet Province Upper Realm.

However, the Multitude Spirits Mountain Range was currently completely sealed off. People from the Wuma Heavenly Clan were present all over.

At least half of all of the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s experts were present in the Multitude Spirits Mountain Range at that moment.

That said, those experts were all focused on trying to open the remnant.

That was the reason why, even after Su Rou and Su Mei’s whereabouts were discovered, they did not immediately request that the experts present in the Multitude Spirits Mountain Range take care of them, but instead returned to that Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Supreme Elder, who was far away in their capital city, to ask him to come and handle the matter.

The reason for that was because the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s experts were simply too busy to concern themselves with Su Rou and Su Mei.

Besides, the Wuma Heavenly Clansmen from the Law Enforcement Hall simply did not dare to disturb those other experts.

The reason for that was because if the remnant were to open while their Lord Clan Chief and Supreme Elders were focused on capturing those two women, and all the treasures ended up being taken away by the outsiders, their Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief would become so furious that he would end up killing them.

After verifying the situation at hand, both the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief and Chu Feng realized an issue.

The remnant was likely even more extraordinary than they had imagined it to be.

After arriving at the Multitude Spirits Mountain Range, that Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Supreme Elder naturally went to inquire about Su Rou and Su Mei.

He did not proceed with the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief and Chu Feng when he left to inquire about them.

Because of this, Chu Feng and the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief were staying inside a palace that had been up temporarily.

“Chu Feng, are you able to verify that the mysterious place recorded in the Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram is here?” The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief asked Chu Feng through a voice transmission.

Chu Feng took out his Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram, opened it, and began to inspect it.

Chu Feng did not attempt to avoid taking out the Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram. After all, only he was able to see its contents. As for others, they would not be able to see anything at all.

“Indeed, it is here. However, currently, I can only be certain that it’s located in this Multitude Spirits Mountain Range; I am unable to determine its exact location,” Chu Feng said.

“That’s not very good for us,” the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief frowned slightly.

They had come to the Scarlet Province Upper Realm for the sake of that mysterious place.

However, not only was the mysterious place discovered by the Wuma Heavenly Clan, but even the Li Heavenly Clan and various other strong powers had fixed their eyes on that mysterious place.

With the situation being like that, they would be in a very passive situation. Likely, it would be very difficult for them to gain an opportunity to seize the treasures inside that mysterious place.

“Senior, it might be possible that the remnant the Wuma Heavenly Clan has discovered is not the mysterious place recorded in the Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram, no?” Chu Feng said with a smile.

“Boy, you’re quite optimistic. If this tiny Multitude Spirits Mountain Range really contained two treasure grounds, it would truly be a miracle,” the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief shook his head. He felt that the possibility of such a thing was simply nonexistent.

“Brother Chu.”

“This is truly strange.”

Right at that moment, the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Supreme Elder walked in with a depressed look on his face.

The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief stood up and asked, “Brother Wuma, what’s wrong? Could it be that there’s been an error in the information?”

“It would be great if the information were mistaken. The issue is, several dozen of our clansmen witnessed those two women at the Multitude Spirits Mountain Range in succession. There were even a couple among them that were injured by those two,” the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Supreme Elder said.

“It would appear that those two women have received information about the treasures here, and came for the sake of the treasures?”

“Those two are truly daring,” the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief gasped with admiration.

“That’s right. However, the issue is the strength of those two women. They’ve already realized that, aside from our clan’s Lord Clan Chief, there are various experts from other powers present in this Multitude Spirits Mountain Range.”

“Yet, even though they knew that was the case, they did not flee. There could only be two reasons for that. Either they’re foolish or... they’re even more remarkable than we imagined them to be.”

“I think that there’s a higher possibility of it being the latter. After all, they’re clearly in the Multitude Spirits Mountain Range, yet the many experts that are present here seem to not be able to detect them,” the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Supreme Elder said. As he said those words, the look of depression on his face grew more and more intense.

“No, I must report this matter to Lord Clan Chief. Only through requesting Lord Liangqiu Chengfeng’s assistance will we be able to track those two women.”

“Otherwise, if something is to happen, I will not be able to shoulder the responsibility.”

After that Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Supreme Elder finished saying those words, he immediately started walking out of the palace hall.
