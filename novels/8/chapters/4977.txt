Chapter 4977: Godsoul Immortal Exalted

Chu Feng was startled for an instant before wariness struck him. The person standing behind the stone gates happened to be a familiar face.

It was Zi Ling.

But that couldn’t have been possible. Zi Ling was in the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, so how could she have appeared here?&nbsp;

For that reason, Chu Feng felt that it was just an illusion.

While Chu Feng was assessing the Zi Ling inside the stone gates, the latter also discovered him. She was surprised, but there was no vigilance in her eyes. A second later, her eyes lit up in delight.

“Big brother Chu Feng, what are you doing here? Did my master send you here?”

Before the stone gates could fully open, Zi Ling had already passed through the gates to rush over to Chu Feng’s side. She grabbed Chu Feng’s robe with her hands and started shaking it happily.&nbsp;

She wasn’t the immature type, but she tended to act like a child whenever she was truly happy. This was an adorable side to her that she would only show in front of Chu Feng.

Seeing how the woman before him only had eyes for him, Chu Feng’s wariness faded.

“You… You really are Zi Ling?”

Chu Feng suddenly felt that she wasn’t just an illusion but his Zi Ling. An illusion couldn’t have given him such a feeling of familiarity.&nbsp;

“Big brother Chu Feng, what kind of nonsense are you spouting? It can’t be that you can’t even recognize me?”&nbsp;

Zi Ling took a step back and looked at Chu Feng with a pout. She was angry that Chu Feng was doubting her identity. Her subtle expressions made Chu Feng even more certain that she was indeed the real Zi Ling.&nbsp;

“You really are my Zi Ling! You can’t blame me for being skeptical. I didn’t expect to meet you at a dangerous place like this. I had to clear many formations before reaching this place. Your sudden appearance was so coincidental made me think that you’re just an apparition conjured by an illusion formation.

“Speaking of which, what brings you here?” Chu Feng awkwardly asked.

“My master brought me here to cultivate. Big brother Chu Feng, based on what I’m hearing, it sounds like it wasn’t my master who brought you here. How did you get in here then? Also, what did you mean by dangerous?”

Zi Ling looked at Chu Feng in confusion. It was not that she suspected him of lying to her, but she honestly couldn’t understand what he was saying.&nbsp;

Her response alerted Chu Feng to the possibility that there might be something more to the ancient remnant than he had expected. So, he first explained his situation to her.&nbsp;

Zi Ling was visibly astounded to hear his story.

“Big brother Chu Feng, bring me over to take a look. I’d like to look at the formations you spoke of,” Zi Ling said.&nbsp;

“Let’s go.”

The formations that Chu Feng had deciphered along the way would revert back to their original state after a period of time, so it wasn’t difficult to find a restored formation for Zi Ling to look at.

“It looks like there’s an entrance from the Nine Souls Galaxy too, but why are the formations along the passageway still active?” Zi Ling remarked.

“Zi Ling, does this ancient remnant have anything to do with the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect?”

Chu Feng could tell that Zi Ling did know a thing or two about this place.&nbsp;

Zi Ling revealed everything she knew to him.&nbsp;

First and foremost, Zi Ling had entered this ancient remnant by another entrance. The other entrance was not located in the Nine Souls Galaxy but the Holy Light Galaxy. In other words, the ancient remnant was located at a place in between the two galaxies.&nbsp;

As for why Zi Ling was able to get in here, the truth was that she didn’t encounter any formations along the way. The heritage in the ancient remnant had already been claimed by someone else, and that person was none other than the famous Dugu Lingtian.&nbsp;

The ancient remnant was slightly unique in the sense that it harnessed great soul energy. While Dugu Lingtian had already laid claim to the heritage, the soul energy still continued to linger in this space.&nbsp;

It was just that soul energy wasn’t too useful to normal cultivators. World spiritists might have a use for it, but it wasn’t of importance either.&nbsp;

Only those who practiced special cultivation techniques would have a use for it. Thus, the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect decided to seal off the ancient remnant.

Upon learning that Zi Ling needed soul energy to treat her ailment, the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster recalled this ancient remnant and sent Zi Ling over.&nbsp;

After hearing Zi Ling’s story, Chu Feng walked through the stone gates and entered the palace. It was then that he noticed another pair of stone gates at the other end of the palace. It was linked to an Upper Realm in the Holy Light Galaxy, and there weren’t any formations along the way at all.&nbsp;

“Big brother Chu Feng, why would the formations at the other side of the entrance remain active even though Lord Dugu Lingtian has already laid claim to the heritage? Could it be that there are other treasures in the palace?” Zi Ling asked.

“That’s unlikely to be the case.”

Chu Feng shook his head. He had taken a look at the surroundings and saw that there weren’t any treasures in the underground palace anymore.&nbsp;

“It looks like the owner of the ancient remnant has prepared this place as a fortuitous encounter for those from the Holy Light Galaxy and Nine Souls Galaxy. It could be that the Holy Light Galaxy has been deemed to have cleared the trial, so all of the obstacles are moved on their side. Of course, this is just my deduction. There’s no way to confirm that now.&nbsp;

“It’s just that… I pity those from the Holy Valley.”

He thought that it was a waste that the Holy Valley had sent so many prodigies to their doom for a heritage that no longer existed. What made things even more ironic was how the Holy Valley ended up challenging on the Nine Souls Galaxy’s side despite being from the Holy Light Galaxy.

“Godsoul Immortal Exalted. Is that the owner of this ancient remnant?”

Chu Feng turned his attention toward a stone tablet inside the palace, where the words ‘Godsoul Immortal Exalted’ were inscribed.&nbsp;
