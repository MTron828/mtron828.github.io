MGA: Chapter 1020 - Mysterious Treasure Box

“Arrogant child, you actually dared to ridicule this grand church head’s weapon? Today, I shall allow you to experience the might of my weapon.”

Seeing that his prided weapon was unexpectedly insulted, this caused the grand church head of the Occult Blood Church to become visibly angry. He waved the half-moon shaped blade in his hand from left to right and a burst of Martial King martial power was shot forth, engulfing everything. The Martial King martial power turned into tens of thousands of blood red colored light rays and, with sounds like that of wolves crying and ghosts howling, rushed toward Chu Feng.

That was a martial skill. Not only was it extremely profound and contained the power of evil, it also managed to perfectly combine with this Incomplete Royal Armament and gave off an extremely powerful might.

However, despite this, Chu Feng was still fearless. Only at the moment when the attack that gave off the sounds of wolves crying and ghosts howling were fast-approaching did he suddenly wave his palm. A large black sword appeared in his hand.

“Boom~~~~”

“Aooo~~~~”

Once the pitch black colored sword appeared, rising wind immediately started appearing and the earth started to tremble. The attack that the church head of the Occult Blood Church had cast instantly vanished like smoke in thin air. As this for large sword, it was naturally the king among Royal Armaments, the Demon Sealing Sword.

Once the Demon Sealing Sword appeared, Chu Feng’s aura also completely changed. He was like a real God of War. As for the Demon Sealing Sword that he held in his hand, it was like a dragon that would devour everything. With its invincible might, the Demon Sealing Sword was thrust toward the chest of the Occult Blood Church’s church head.

“Damn it.”

At this moment, the Occult Blood Church’s church head had thought about using his all to defend the incoming attack. However, when he started to brandish the Incomplete Royal Armament in his hand, he was shocked to discover that not only was the Incomplete Royal Armament in his hand violently trembling, it even seemed to have lost control - it had already lost its ability to resist.

“Puchi.” At the split second when the Occult Blood Church’s church head hesitated, the Demon Sealing Sword in Chu Feng’s hand had already pierced into his chest and out his back.

“Wuuwa.” Having his chest penetrated by the giant sword, the Occult Blood Church’s church head gave off a miserable scream. At this moment, like a nail, he was pinned to the altar and unable to move at all.

“You, you, who exactly are you?” The church head of the Occult Blood Church started to panic. At the moment when Chu Feng took out the Demon Sealing Sword, he already realized that Chu Feng was definitely not of ordinary origins.

That was because he was able to sense the Demon Sealing Sword that Chu Feng had taken out was a Royal Armament. Furthermore, based on the might that it displayed, it seemed to be several times more powerful than the Royal Armaments that he had seen before. At the very least, the oppressive sensation that it had given to his Incomplete Royal Armament had greatly surpassed that of ordinary Royal Armaments.

This caused him to become certain that there was definitely a formidable power behind Chu Feng. Otherwise, with his cultivation and age, how could he possibly possess such a precious weapon?

“Senior Luo, how do you wish to torment this scum?” Chu Feng did not bother to pay attention to the Occult Blood Church’s church head. Instead, his gaze was cast toward Grandfather Luo.

“This...” Although Grandfather Luo’s hatred for the Occult Blood Church’s church head was deep to the bone, but when asked about how to torment him, Grandfather Luo actually started to hesitate.

“No matter, since all torments are the same, allow this junior to help you with it.” Chu Feng lightly smiled and stopped waiting for Grandfather Luo’s response. While keeping the Occult Blood Church’s church head pinned by the Demon Sealing Sword, Chu Feng extended his two hands. Like two large pincers, he started to pinch the body of the Occult Blood Church.

“Ahhh~~~~~~”

Chu Feng’s hands were extremely powerful. Anywhere he pinched would give off a ‘kacha, kacha’ sound of something being broken. As for the places that he pinched, not only would the flesh and blood be mutilated, even the bones would be broken. In merely a blink of an eye, Chu Feng’s hands had gone past the entire body of the Occult Blood Church’s church head. This caused the church head’s body to be covered in blood with broken bones all over. He had turned into a cripple.

After subjecting the Occult Blood Church’s church head to the pain of having his entire body’s bones broken, Chu Feng did not stop. Instead, he raised his hand and a dagger appeared in it. Once the dagger appeared, Chu Feng began to frantically pierce it into the body of the Occult Blood Church’s church head. Relying on the sharpness of the dagger, Chu Feng began to pull out the tendons and meridians of the Occult Blood Church’s church head one after another and then pierced holes through his organs.

“Ah~~~~ Stop, stop. Don’t torment me anymore. The treasure box that you want is in my Cosmos Sack. If you want it, then take it. After all, it is merely a useless item that can’t even be opened. I don’t want it anymore, I’m giving it back, alright?”

“Please spare my life. Big brother Luo, I was wrong. Please spare my life.”

Unable to bear Chu Feng’s torments anymore, the Occult Blood Church’s church head began to beg for forgiveness. Seeing that begging to Chu Feng was useless, he cast his gaze toward Grandfather Luo.

Seeing Chu Feng tormenting the Occult Blood Church’s church head like that, even Grandfather Luo who had experienced many large gales and waves started to deeply frown. His forehead was filled with cold sweat. As his age was old, he had also become unable to endure watching this sort of excessively cruel torment anymore. Thus, he opened his mouth and said,

“Chu Feng, you can stop. Take out that treasure box of mine and check it out first. See if what he had said is true or false. After all, his life is nowhere as precious as that treasure chest of mine.”

Hearing Grandfather Luo speaking out, Chu Feng naturally stopped his torment. He went and picked up the Occult Blood Church’s church head’s cosmos sack. After inspecting it, he soon discovered an extraordinary item in it.

After taking out that item, even Chu Feng’s eyes started to shine. That was because that was a treasure box.

This treasure box was a wooden box. Its color was a bit blackish purple. From a single glance, it appeared to be very shabby. However, those people with great eyesight were able to tell with a single glance that it was a treasure box.

This treasure box was very ancient. As for the runes and patterns on it, they too were extremely profound. The most important matter was when one held it in their hand, one would be able to sense an extremely powerful energy flowing through the treasure box. This meant that the treasure chest contained extraordinary items.

“Wow, it’s actually a treasure box. Chu Feng, quickly open it and see exactly what it is that’s inside.” At this moment, even the great Lady Queen gasped in surprise. Unable to stop herself, she ran over to Chu Feng.

“Haha, open this treasure box? You can continue to dream! After I obtained this treasure box, I had painstakingly studied it for many years. However, I was unable to open it at all.” The Occult Blood Church’s church head sneered.

“Heh....” Toward the words spoken by the Occult Blood Church’s church head, Chu Feng merely gave a laugh of disdain. He did not directly try to open the treasure box right away. Instead, his gaze flashed, activating his Heaven Eyes. Using that, Chu Feng began to carefully inspect the patterns on the treasure box.

After his inspection, he spread out his majestic golden spiritual energy and began to create a unique opening formation on the ground. Next, he placed the treasure chest in the opening formation and began to activate it.

“Buzz.” As the formation was activated, light instantly engulfed the entire place. Layers upon layers of powerful runes, like a magnificent army of thousands of men and horses, started to attack the treasure box. Before that sort of attack, the treasure box actually started to slightly sway. Moreover, the runes on the treasure box also began to flicker with light. In the end, a popping sound was heard. That treasure box was indeed opened.

“Impossible. This is impossible. I have painstakingly spent all those years trying to open it to no avail, how could you possibly open it?”

Seeing the treasure box being opened before his eyes, the Occult Blood Church’s church head was driven mad. Like a crazy man, he started to twist and wring his body and was trying to break away from the binding of the Demon Sealing Sword. At the same time, his eyes were emitting a gaze filled with greed and was fixed upon the opened treasure box. From this, one could tell how badly he wanted the things inside the treasure box.

In reality, not only him, even Grandfather Luo had an expression of shock. He was so emotional that his aged body was even shivering. If the Occult Blood Church’s church head had spent many years in trying to open this treasure box to no avail, then the amount of time that Grandfather Luo had spent was several decades.

The treasure box that they had spent that many years trying to open with no avail, was actually opened after being in Chu Feng’s hand for only a short moment. How could they possibly not be emotional?

At this moment, they realized an issue. It turned out that it wasn’t that the treasure box was hard to open. Instead, it was that the methods they used to to try opening the treasure box was far too inferior.
