Chapter 4836: Descent of a Heavenly God

The following morning, the members of the HIdden Dragon Martial Sect stood in neat formation at the Hidden Dragon Square.

Be it elder or disciple, East Dragon Hall, West Tiger Hall, South Vermilion Hall, or Black Tortoise Hall, everyone was present other than those who were in closed-door training or out for mission.

Even the sectmaster and vice sectmaster had arrived way ahead of time.

However, Chu Feng, Duan Liufeng, and Zi Ling were still nowhere to be seen.

The crowd felt extremely unconfident, but they dared not to voice their reservations seeing that the sectmaster wasn’t saying anything either.

It was only when Chu Feng and Duan Liufeng finally arrived that a slight commotion rose amidst the solemn crowd.

Chu Feng walked over under Zi Ling’s support. His eyes were sunk in, his lips dry, and his figure far thinner than before. He seemed to be in a feeble state.

Other than the golden glow that was vaguely flowing beneath his skin, he looked like a person who was terminally ill and on the verge of breathing his last.

Was such a Chu Feng really capable of withstanding the might of the Hidden Dragon Heavenly God Formation?

It would be a lie if the crowd were to say that they weren’t concerned. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“How did the tempering go?” the sectmaster asked Duan Liufeng.

“Lord Sectmaster, everything is successful. Anyone else other than my Brother Chu would have definitely been unable to withstand the suffering.”

Despite Chu Feng’s frail state, Duan Liufeng still spoke of him with great pride.

Duan Liufeng was usually a reticent person, but somehow, he seemed to change into a different person whenever he spoke of Chu Feng.

However, the sectmaster didn’t respond to Duan Liufeng’s praise. In fact, she only spared a glance at Chu Feng before turning her eyes away.

She wasn’t concerned about whether Chu Feng was outstanding or not. All that mattered here was whether he had succeeded in his tempering or not.

On the other hand, the vice sectmaster’s eyes remained focused on Chu Feng. He tried his best to rein in his feelings, but Chu Feng, Duan Liufeng, and sectmaster still noticed something was amiss with him.

“I’ll make it clear right now that I won’t spare anyone who dares to cause any trouble here, regardless of whether you’re a disciple or an elder,” the sectmaster said.

She didn’t particularly look at anyone when she spoke, but Chu Feng and Duan Liufeng knew deep well that it was a warning directed toward the vice sectmaster.

The vice sectmaster caught the drift too, so he finally tore his eyes away from Chu Feng.

Shoosh!

The sectmaster waved her hands, and two objects appeared on both sides of her.

On her left was a floating golden box that was around half a meter in length.

On her right was a scroll that spanned a length of a meter. This scroll emanated an ancient aura, and there was a talisman seal plastered on it. It drew the crowd’s curiosity as to what was in it.

Bam!

The golden box opened up, and countless golden pills rained out from the box like a meteor shower. They fell into the hands of the elders and disciples present.

The disciples and the elders took a good look at the pills that had fallen in their hands, knowing that it had something to do with the Hidden Dragon Heavenly Dragon Formation they were going to be channeling today.

It was said that these pills were personally forged by the sect founder.

If not for the fact that they needed it today, probably no one would bear to swallow it just like that. They would cherish it as if it was their family heirloom.

“This is probably your first time seeing these pills. It’s the Heavenly Dragon Formation Core Pill, and it’ll allow you to establish a connection with the Hidden Dragon Heavenly God Formation once you swallow them.”

After explaining the function of the pill, the sectmaster turned her gaze toward the scroll with a talisman seal on it.

“This scroll over here is a relic left behind by our sect founder. I was told that this scroll can only be opened when our Hidden Dragon Martial Sect is facing a great calamity, and there’s no doubt that our sect is facing an unprecedented danger like never before in the course of its history.”

Everyone had grim looks on their faces.

“You have come from different realms across the Ancestral Martial Galaxy, and the fact that you are all gathered here as a member of our Hidden Dragon Martial Sect is testament to your talents. Since you are already one of us, let’s live and die as one.

“The one to break the calamity might be Chu Feng, but we’ll all be putting our strength together to channel the Hidden Dragon Heavenly God Formation.

“Pull no punches today. Give everything you got in driving the Hidden Dragon Heavenly God Formation, for we’ll all be deciding our fates today. Are you all prepared for it?”

The sectmaster’s voice roared louder than the thunderous rumbling above.

“I’m willing to live and die with the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect!”

“I’m willing to live and die with the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect!”

…

The sectmaster showed a rare heartened smile upon seeing the unity displayed by the elders and sect members.

She turned to Chu Feng and said, “Chu Feng, we have put our strength together in order to support you. Don’t let us down. Regardless of whether it was intentional or not, there’s no doubt that you’re the cause of the calamity befalling us. If you are unable to break the calamity, you’ll have to bear responsibility for it.”

Chu Feng clasped his fist in response after hearing those words.

“Lord Sectmaster, please rest assured. I, Chu Feng, am a member of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect too. Even if this calamity has nothing to do with me, I’d still do everything I can to break it. Even if I have to put my life on the line, I’ll ensure that everything goes smoothly!”

Chu Feng’s eyes were filled with determination.

The sectmaster turned her eyes away from Chu Feng. She took out a golden pill from the golden box and placed it into her mouth.

The elders and disciples quickly emulated her actions and swallowed the pill too.

Weng!

As they assimilated the energy inside the pill, their bodies began to emanate a golden aura.

“Everyone, we shall start activating the formation now!”

The sectmaster began forming a series of hand seals, and the elders and disciples did the same too.

Boom boom boom!

The ground rumbled in response to their converging powers. The trembling wasn’t just limited to this square but the entire Hidden Dragon Martial Sect.

Boom!

Boom!

Boom!

With each rumble, a golden aura would burst forth from the ground and gush into the sky. Soon, thousands of golden aura pillars could be seen rising from all over the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect.

They interweaved one another to form a massive giant that towered at over ten thousand meters. This giant wore armor and wielded a sword. The aura it emanated far surpassed that of any Martial Exalted level cultivator.

It stood in the sky like a heavenly god that had descended to the mortal world.

This was the Hidden Dragon Heavenly God Formation.

It was just that the energy emanated from the Hidden Dragon Heavenly God Formation left Zi Ling, Duan Liufeng, and the others feelings incredibly unconfident. Could Chu Feng really be able to withstand such great energy being channeled into his body?

Shoosh!

While everyone was harboring doubts about the success of this operation, Chu Feng leaped right into the Hidden Dragon Heavenly God Formation in the sky. Right after, the golden aura began to converge toward him.

Chu Feng shone as brilliantly as a sun in the sky, but this situation didn’t last for too long.

When the blinding light finally dissipated, the humongous giant vanished without the slightest trace. Its powers had all been infused into Chu Feng’s body.

That very instant, Chu Feng and the Hidden Dragon Heavenly God Formation had fused into one. His thin and sickly body swiftly grew healthy and powerful, and a divine glow shone from his body.

“He managed to hold on perfectly… Is this the talents of the greatest prodigy of our Hidden Dragon Martial Sect?”

The crowd couldn’t help but mutter praises upon seeing Chu Feng’s transformation.

“This strength likely exceeds that of Martial Exalted level.”

Chu Feng clenched his fists tightly as he felt the power flowing through his body. It made him feel incredibly excited.

If the strongest expert in the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect was previously the sectmaster, he might just be stronger than her right now.

He turned his gaze to look at the sky, where streaks of violet lightning were rampaging about. It was still terrifying, but not as much as before.

“Allow me to have a taste of your power!”

Chu Feng released the golden aura in his body, and it swiftly morphed to a ten thousand meters tall giant that shared his appearance. He swung his blade down on it.

Boom!

The clouds rumbled, and astonishingly, the ferocious violet lightning was actually dissipated.

Everyone was taken aback for an instant before frenzied joy erupted on their faces.

In a calamity which even the sectmaster was unable to do anything about, Chu Feng was actually able to tear a hole in it with just a single slash of his blade.

At the same time, the sounds coming from the violet lightning also changed. Rather than its usual aggressive roars, it seemed to be wailing in pain.

However, this was only the start. Chu Feng rose into the sky like a heavenly god and dived right into the calamity to begin his massacre.
