Chapter 5350: The Frightened Zhou Clan

Chu Feng was as confused as the crowd, for he hadn’t released any energy at all. In fact, he could tell that the energy that appeared to have been released from his body was actually Old Man Zhou’s means. 

“Young friend,” a voice was relayed to Chu Feng’s ears. 

It was Old Man Zhou’s voice. He appeared to be unconscious, but the voice transmission was indubitably coming from him. 

“Elder, you aren’t sick at all?” Chu Feng asked.

“Oh? You figured it out pretty fast. That’s right, I’m not sick. I’m just pretending to be ill. I wanted to see who would eye my treasure on the Unageing Peak while I’m away, as well as to see how my descendants would fare in my absence. I have achieved my goal, but I don’t want anyone to know that it’s just an act. That’s why I need to borrow your help here. I’ll definitely repay you for this favor,” Old Man Zhou said. 

“Elder, may I ask where you have obtained that crystal from?” Chu Feng asked via voice transmission.

“You’re talking about the Life Crystal?” Old Man Zhou asked.

“That’s right,” Chu Feng replied.

That was the name of the treasure. He had tried asking Zhou Yi and the others about it, but none of them knew what the treasure was called. Old Man Zhou had told them that it was a rare treasure, but he had never told them the name of the treasure.

“Young friend, who are you intending to save? Is the Life Crystal you have awakened insufficient?” Old Man Zhou asked.

“I need more than that,” Chu Feng replied.

“How much more do you require?” Old Man Zhou asked.

“I’m not certain, but I’d likely require at least a hundred more,” Chu Feng gauged.

He felt that Eggy should be able to make a full recovery as long as he acquired sufficient Life Crystals, but he wasn’t sure how many he exactly needed. 

“A hundred Life Crystals?” Old Man Zhou exclaimed in astonishment. “Young friend Chu Feng, you aren’t trying to save someone’s life here. You’re practically trying to resurrect a person.”

“Elder, can you tell me where you obtained the Life Crystal?” Chu Feng asked.

“That’s no ordinary place. Allow me to carefully ponder it through first,” Old Man Zhou replied.

The energy that appeared to be released from Chu Feng’s body stopped. The fact that not even Daoist Sixth Dragon was able to see through Old Man Zhou’s means showed just how powerful he was. It was no wonder no one dared to steal the Life Crystal under his watch. 

Soon, Old Man Zhou regained consciousness.

“Father!”

“Grandfather!”

The Zhou Clan’s Clan Chief, Zhou Yi, Zhou Zhi, and Zhou Shuang charged toward Old Man Zhou. They could tell that the old man was finally out of danger. 

“Young friend, were you the one who saved me?” Old Man Zhou looked at Chu Feng with eyes filled with gratitude.

“Pft. That old man sure is good at acting.” Eggy burst into laughter. She shared her senses with Chu Feng, allowing her to hear what Old Man Zhou had said earlier even though he had relayed his words via voice transmission.  

However, no one else was aware of the truth. The crowd earnestly believed that Chu Feng was the one who saved Old Man Zhou. Even the four daoists looked at Chu Feng in a different light. They didn’t think that Chu Feng could deal with an illness that even they were helpless before.

“Young friend Chu Feng, I thought that I was a goner. How did you save me?” Old Man Zhou asked.

“I previously obtained a treasure with healing properties. I was just thinking of giving it a try, but it turns out to be truly effective,” Chu Feng randomly found an excuse to explain the situation. 

His earlier success in awakening the Life Crystal had already shown that he was a formidable individual. No one doubted his claim. Old Man Zhou took this opportunity to chase everyone out, claiming that he wanted to properly express his gratitude to Chu Feng. 

With a wave of his hand, Old Man Zhou constructed a barrier that sealed off the palace.

Chu Feng was astonished to see the barrier. Old Man Zhou turned out to be stronger than he thought. Outside the palace, Daoist Sixth Dragon also frowned as well.

“I’ve long heard that Old Man Zhou is a formidable world spiritist, but I didn’t think that he would be this powerful. It’s fortunate that we didn’t massacre the Zhou Clan earlier, or else we would have been done in by that old man,” Daoist Sixth Dragon told his other three brothers.

“Sixth Brother, how powerful is Old Man Zhou?” the other three asked.

“I reckon that only our big brother and second brother stand a chance against him,” Daoist Sixth Dragon said.

The other three daoists gasped in astonishment. Their big brother and second brother were strong enough to be considered two of the most powerful world spiritists in the world of cultivation, but Old Man Zhou was actually able to rival them.

That showed just how powerful Old Man Zhou was.

“Young friend Chu Feng, can you return the compass to me? It might look like nothing, but it really is the family heirloom of our Zhou Clan,” Old Man Zhou said with a smile.

“I can tell that it’s a rare treasure,” Chu Feng replied with a smile.

To be honest, the treasure was so formidable that he had considered withholding the treasure, especially after how the Zhou Clan had treated him earlier. However, the Life Crystal was much more important to him now, especially since it was the key to treating Eggy. 

He was still relying on Old Man Zhou to divulge the whereabouts of the Life Crystal, so he could only obediently return the compass.

“Look around this place.”

Old Man Zhou took out a map and handed it to Chu Feng. The latter unfurled the map and saw that the indicated location was in the Bloodline Galaxy.

“Take this along with you, or else that person might refuse to meet you.” Old Man Zhou handed a broken sword to Chu Feng.

Chu Feng could tell that the broken sword was a world spiritist treasure, just that it had lost its effects now that it had been broken.

“Thank you, elder.” Chu Feng thanked Old Man Zhou.

“I’m saying this out of goodwill, but don’t get your hopes up yet. Even if that person is willing to spare you that many Life Crystals, there’s no guarantee that you’ll be able to awaken the others even though you succeeded with the one I have,” Old Man Zhou said.

“Thank you for your reminder. I’ll be taking my leave right now,” Chu Feng said.

“Are you in such a rush?” Old Man Zhou asked.

“Mmhm.” 

“Since that’s the case, I shan’t keep you here.”

When Chu Feng walked out of the palace, he saw the four daoists waiting for him. 

He suddenly noticed something and raised his head. An individual was rushing in his direction. It was Bai Yunqing. 

“Big brother Chu Feng, I heard that you managed to awaken the treasure! How is it? Did it work on that young miss?” 

Bai Yunqing had just come over from the Unageing Peak. He was trembling with excitement after having heard about the events that had transpired earlier, which compelled him to shout over despite having yet to get close. 

“It’s useful.” Chu Feng was delighted to see Bai Yunqing.

He thought that he would miss Bai Yunqing since he was already planning to set off, but the latter arrived right on the dot. However, he quickly noticed that something was amiss as the latter came closer.

“Why is your aura so weak?” Chu Feng asked.

Despite Bai Yunqing’s attempt to mask his condition, Chu Feng still sensed that something was amiss. 

“I’m fine. It’s the result of the special training I went through,” Bai Yunqing replied cheerily.

Chu Feng didn’t think much about it since there were indeed some types of training that imposed a huge burden on the body. 

“This young friend is…” 

The four daoists looked at Bai Yunqing. They actually weren’t too interested in Bai Yunqing, but they figured that it was worth knowing someone who was on such close terms with Chu Feng.

“He’s my brother, Bai Yunqing,” Chu Feng introduced.

“I am Bai Yunqing, the disciple of Taishi Xingzhong, the Totem Dragon Clan’s First Elder. Paying respects to the four daoists,” Bai Yunqing said.

He had heard about how the four daoists had stood up for Chu Feng, and he was grateful to them for that even though he still had no idea why they had done so. 

“A young hero indeed. Taishi Xingzhong sure has hidden his disciple from us well!” the four daoists exclaimed with smiles before turning to Chu Feng. “Young friend Chu Feng, where are you heading to next? It happens that we don’t have anything up. Shall we travel together?”

“I am heading to the Bloodline Galaxy. Do you wish to come along with me?” Chu Feng asked.

It would be great if the four daoists were willing to travel together with him. Both Daoist Sixth Dragon and Daoist Seventh Dragon were True Dragon World Spiritists. There was no reason for Chu Feng to turn down the protection of such powerful experts. 

“It has been a long time since I have been to the Bloodline Galaxy. It just so happens that I have been wanting to head there. If young friend Chu Feng doesn’t mind, the four of us will be joining you on your journey,” the four daoists said. 

“I’d be more than happy with it,” Chu Feng replied.

Bai Yunqing could hardly hide his grin too.

With that, Chu Feng, Bai Yunqing, and the four daoists began making their way toward the Bloodline Galaxy. 

Meanwhile, Old Man Zhou gathered the members of the Zhou Clan and punished every single one of them. In particular, Zhou Shuang received the most severe punishment, being banished from the main family and condemned to be sidelined from now onward.

Zhou Zhi was the only one who was spared from punishment, but he wasn’t rewarded either. After all, he did lose their family heirloom.

After issuing the punishments, Old Man Zhou went right into closed-door training. 

Even though Old Man Zhou wouldn’t be supervising the execution of the punishments, the members of the Zhou Clan knew better than to disobey him. 

Zhou Zhi, the only one who was spared from the punishments, headed over to the Unageing Peak. Looking at the empty spot where the Life Crystal was previously placed, he felt a rush of emotions. 

Chu Feng had shown him the difference between him and a true prodigy.

All of a sudden, another young man arrived at the mountaintop. He didn’t fly up but instead climbed up the mountain a step at a time. He had a youthful appearance, but he emanated an air of coldness.

“You’re from the Zhou Clan?” the young man asked Zhou Zhi.

Zhou Zhi ignored him. He could tell that the other party was a junior, and he didn’t have much respect for his peers other than those whom he had acknowledged, such as Chu Feng. 

“Where’s the treasure of your Unageing Peak? I want to awaken it,” the young man said.

“Heh…” Zhou Zhi sneered in disdain. “Do you think that just anyone can awaken our treasure? You should know your place!”Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Boom!

The young man released a whiff of spirit power that vaguely contained a dragon’s roar. 

Zhou Zhi immediately felt immense pressure crushing down on him. He widened his eyes in disbelief. He assessed the young man before him again and again, and he was certain that the other party was indeed a junior.

Yet, the young man was an Immortal Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist.

Meanwhile, Old Man Zhou had really gone into closed-door training. To prevent others from interrupting him, he even spent some time setting up a powerful protection formation. But just as he finished constructing the formation, his face suddenly warped in shock.

He saw an old man passing through the palace’s walls to enter his room. The formation he had just constructed was completely useless against the other party.
