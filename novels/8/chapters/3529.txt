Chapter 3529 - Head-on Battle

The lightning was purple in color. Not only was it dazzling, but its mighty aura also covered the entire sky.

Most importantly, after the lightning appeared, Kong Tianhui’s cultivation increased from rank one Exalted to rank two Exalted.

“Purple Lightning Divine Body.”

“Kong Tianhui actually managed to train his Purple Lightning Divine Body to such a degree?”

At that moment, the expressions of Tantai Yinjian, The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief and others changed.

They all knew that the purple lightning was Kong Tianhui’s Divine Power.

The strength of a Divine Body’s Divine Power was directly related to the capability of the cultivator.

Those with sufficiently powerful strength were capable of utilizing their Divine Power to increase their cultivation by a level.

The people from Divine Body Royal City possessed superior attainments in the field of utilization of Divine Power to begin with. Furthermore, they also had their unique training method.

Thus, for a genius like Kong Tianhui to be able to possess Divine Power capable of increasing his cultivation by a level was within the crowd’s expectation. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Merely, the crowd did not expect that after Kong Tianhui’s Divine Power increased his cultivation by a level, his battle power has also increased.

“Boom~~~”

A fist shot forth, shattering space.

In an instant, Kong Tianhui arrived before Chu Feng, and launched a punch directly at him.

However, after he shot forth his punch, Kong Tianhui turned his displeased gaze behind him, “You bastard!”

It turned out that Chu Feng had dodged Kong Tianhui’s attack, and was standing behind him.

The character ‘Divine’ was on Chu Feng’s forehead . His Divine-level Lightning Mark had been activated.

With the activation of the Divine-level Lightning Mark, his cultivation increased from rank one Exalted to rank two Exalted.

It was because his cultivation had increased that he was able to easily avoid Kong Tianhui’s attack.

Kong Tianhui had already heard rumors that Chu Feng was trained in the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique, and was capable of increasing his cultivation by a level.

Thus, if that was all there was to it, Kong Tianhui would not have such a displeased look on his face.

The reason why Kong Tianhui was so displeased was because Chu Feng was standing at the edge of the compass.

Should Chu Feng leave the compass, he would no longer be restricted by it. At that time, he would be able to release his world spirit, and Kong Tianhui would not be able to contend against him at all.

Yet, even though he was clearly able to leave the compass, Chu Feng decided to stay.

To Kong Tianhui, this was an act of naked provocation.

“To not leave the compass when you can, Chu Feng, what is the meaning of this? Are you looking down on me?” Kong Tianhui asked angrily.

“It’s not that I am looking down on you. I merely want you to accept your defeat.”

“People only know that I, Chu Feng, possess some attainments in terms of my world spirit techniques. However, I, Chu Feng, am someone who focuses first on my martial cultivation.”

“It’s been a long time since I’ve utilized my martial power to my satisfaction.”

“Thus, I wish to do so today,” as Chu Feng spoke, he took several steps forward, and walked to the center of the compass.

“Motherfucker, you dare to despise me like this!”

“Today, this young master will definitely have you realize how powerful I, Kong Tianhui, am!”

“Woosh~~~”

As Kong Tianhui spoke, he flipped his wrist, and a cyan sword appeared in his hand.

After that sword appeared, the space around Kong Tianhui started to emit a special sort of ripple. Even the natural energies were affected by that sword.

Seeing that sword, everyone’s eyes started to shine.

That sword was an Incomplete Exalted Armament.

Incomplete Exalted Armaments were extremely precious items. Yet, a person of the younger generation like Kong Tianhui actually possessed one.

While they were feeling envious, the crowd exclaimed in admiration toward the strength of Divine Body Royal City. If they weren’t powerful enough, how could they be willing to allocate such a precious weapon to a person of the younger generation?

With that Incomplete Exalted Armament in hand, Kong Tianhui’s battle power immediately surged.

He did not say anything, and instead directly aimed his sword at Chu Feng and thrust forth.

“Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~”

Sword rays began to swirl in the air. Like a storm of howling wind and torrential rain, they covered the entire region, filling the sky outside the compass.

Kong Tianhui’s attack was extremely strong, and his swordplay was outstanding. One could tell that he had already attained a fluent command over his Incomplete Exalted Armament.

However, the more exceptional Kong Tianhai’s performance was, the more astonished the crowd became. Even people like Tantai Yinjian had an increasing look of surprise on his face.

Holding an Incomplete Exalted Armament, Kong Tianhui’s battle power had increased enormously. Furthermore, his attacks were very natural, like moving clouds and flowing water.

Yet, such a Kong Tianhui was unable to cause the slightest damage to Chu Feng.

Because of that, the crowd were unable to contain their astonishment, and wondered exactly how much battle experience Chu Feng possessed. Furthermore, his battle power was also not something comparable to ordinary individuals.

“Although completely weaponless, he is able to contend against Kong Tianhui, who holds an Incomplete Exalted Armament. This sort of battle power is simply too astonishing. Could it be... is this the power of the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique?”

Even the people of the older generation were exclaiming in admiration as they looked at Chu Feng.

Disregarding the fact that the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique was extremely precious, even if one was given the opportunity to train in it, it was not something that just anyone could learn.

Learning the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique was extremely difficult That was common knowledge to everyone.

Thus, it was Chu Feng’s own ability to be able to master the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique to gain such battle power.

This... was a display of his talent.

After a series of attacks that yielded no results, Kong Tianhui flew back and descended onto the compass.

“You got some skills. Since that’s the case, I, Kong Tianhui, shall be impolite. This time around... I will definitely have you kneel and beg for forgiveness.”

“Boom~~~”

Suddenly, purple light began to shine from Kong Tianhui’s body.

The purple light quickly shrank in size, and formed armor that covered his body.

The armor was composed of light. Overlapped with his purple lightning, the armor resembled purple lightning armor, and was extremely dazzling.

That said, what was most important was that Kong Tianhui’s cultivation had actually increased again.

His cultivation had increased from rank two Exalted to rank three Exalted.

Even without thinking much about it, the crowd knew that what had increased Kong Tianhui’s cultivation again was not his Divine Power.

After all, no matter how strong a Divine Power might be, it would not be able to increase one’s cultivation by two levels.

Thus, Kong Tianhui’s armor of light was a treasure.

Kong Tianhui had increased his cultivation again through the use of a treasure.

“How will Chu Feng deal with it now?”

“Could it be that he also possesses a treasure capable of increasing his cultivation?”

The crowd looked to Chu Feng, and discovered that he actually had a confident look. At that moment, they began to wonder what he would do.
