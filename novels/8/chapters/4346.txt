Chapter 4346: The Method of Salvation Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Master, there must be a way to save you!” Chu Feng exclaimed worriedly.

He didn’t wish for anything to happen to the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

But the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was a person who possessed means far beyond what Chu Feng was capable of. If even he was unable to do anything about his current condition, what could Chu Feng possibly do?

Even though Chu Feng insisted that there would be a way out, his heart had already fallen into a mess. He could hardly make sense of anything at all at the moment.

“Don’t panic. There’s indeed a method, but I might have to trouble you to do something for me,” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said.

“Master, what is it?” Chu Feng asked hurriedly.

“In order to recover from my condition, I have been looking for a body that can fuse perfectly with my soul so that I can recover my strength. A while ago, I managed to find it. That item is a mystical product of nature, and it possesses the ability to morph into anything in the world. Before it matured, I have already infused a surge of my energy into it.

“Judging by the time, it should be nearing maturity by now, making it the ideal period for me to fuse myself with it. If it were to fully mature and awaken, it would be too late.

“I should have started heading there by now, but this body of mine needs to take some time to recuperate, so it wouldn’t be appropriate for me to go on a long journey now. Furthermore, even though the Dragon Clan is treating us with the utmost respect at the moment, it’s clear that they are still guarded toward us.

“They might be willing to let you go, but until Long Xiaoxiao fully assimilates with the power of the Dragon Vein Source, there’s no way they’ll let me leave this area. So, I can only count on you to head over and bring that item here for me,” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said.

“Master, where is the item you speak of? I’ll set off right now!” Chu Feng said.

“That item is not located in the Holy Light Galaxy, but the Nine Souls Galaxy. There, in the Upper Realm of the Risefall Starfield, there is a mountain range. The item is buried in one of the mountains.”

As the Ox-nosed Old Daoist spoke, he struggled to raise his hand and released his spirit energy to draw out the map of a mountain range.

Just by looking at the map, Chu Feng could already see the uniqueness of the region.

However, the final location that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist circled out was on the top of one of the smaller hills instead.

After that, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist retracted his formation, and the massive map swiftly contracted into a small bundle before falling into Chu Feng’s hands.

Following that, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist took out two items from his Cosmos Sack.

One of them was a key, but the other one was slightly more complicated. It was a gunny sack with complicated runic patterns and a powerful formation cast on it.

“Chu Feng, take this Barrier Key. It’ll allow you to pass through the barrier I created. Once you’re in, use this gunny sack to seal the item and bring it back to me.

“Remember, if the item has already awoken, you must flee right away. Do not attempt to fight it!” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said.

“Master, would the item be useless to you if it has already awoken?” Chu Feng asked.

“That’s not it.”

The Ox-nosed Old Daoist shook his head before continuing, “The item has the ability to morph into anything, making it a mystical medicine that can cure many different illnesses, but at the same time, it has a particularly vile nature.”

“Back then, I took advantage of its weakness to erase its consciousness before I was able to get it under my control. However, if it were to mature, not only will it regain its consciousness, but its memories will return to it as well. On top of that, its strength would be above mine too. Even I would dare not approach it, let alone you!” the Ox-nosed Daoist exclaimed.

“So, it’s not that you are unable to use it once it has matures, but that it would be too strong for us to control it?” Chu Feng asked.

“Yes, that’s right,” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist replied with a nod.

Then, he quickly added, “Chu Feng, that item is a vile being. I should have killed it the moment I found it, but I was greedy. I wanted to use it to treat my injuries, so I kept it with me. If it has matured, you have to run as far as you can from it. Do not attempt to clash head-on with it regardless of the situation! As for my condition, it hasn’t reached a hopeless situation yet. Even if you fail to retrieve that item, we can simply find another solution.”

Even though the Ox-nosed Old Daoist had put it like that, just by looking at how frail he looked, Chu Feng was deeply worried that he wouldn’t be able to last that long.

If not to suppress the Qilin’s egg for him, even if it was only a matter of time before the Ox-nosed Old Daoist suffered a relapse, his condition still wouldn’t have been as bad as it was at the moment.

In Chu Feng’s point of view, he had a part to play in his master’s current critical condition.

On top of that, despite already being in such a state, his master was still worried about his safety.

So, out of both self-reproach and filial piety, he was determined to bring the item back as long as there was a sliver of hope.

However, so as to not worry the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, he still obediently nodded to reassure his master.

“Master, don’t worry. I’ll act as you have instructed. I won’t put myself in danger.”

After that, Chu Feng helped the Ox-nosed Old Daoist out of the Dragon Clan’s Ancestral Ground.

When those of the Dragon Clan saw the state that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was in, they were all worried. They quickly asked about his condition with worried looks on their faces.

Of course, there was no way the Ox-nosed Old Daoist would say that it was a result of him suppressing the Qilin’s egg, as well as the fact that he was already ill before this.

So, he claimed that it was a rebound from overexerting himself when he opened the Dragon Vein Source.

This made those of the Dragon Clan feel even more indebted to the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

Despite that, when the Ox-nosed Old Daoist requested to leave the Dragon Clan to recuperate from his injuries, the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief did everything within his ability to retain him.

Both Chu Feng and the Ox-nosed Old Daoist knew that the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief was not worried about the Ox-nosed Old Daoist. Rather, he was afraid that a mishap might occur with Long Xiaoxiao while she was trying to assimilate with the Dragon Vein Source, so he was determined to keep the latter here to troubleshoot.

Left with no choice, Chu Feng could only claim that he was heading out to find some medicine the Ox-nosed Old Daoist needed, and leave the Dragon Clan by himself.

Regarding this matter, the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief didn’t stop Chu Feng at all. On the contrary, he even walked Chu Feng out personally.

It was just that right before Chu Feng was about to leave, the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief reminded him with a solemn look on his face, “Young friend Chu Feng, I have to ask you to keep Xiaoxiao’s affairs confidential. If word were to reach the ears of the Holy Light Clan, not only would Xiaoxiao’s life be in danger, but even our Dragon Clan would be in deep danger.”

The Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief wasn’t saying these words to threaten Chu Feng. Even Chu Feng knew how great the implications of this matter could be.

The current Long Xiaoxiao was the hope of the Dragon Clan, as well as a threat to the Holy Light Clan’s supremacy. It was inevitable that the Holy Light Clan would view her as a thorn in its back.

Even if the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief hadn’t reminded him of this matter, Chu Feng would also not speak of it lightly either.

“Lord Clan Chief, rest assured. I’ll not speak a word of this matter to anyone else,” Chu Feng promised.

After that, he stepped into a teleportation formation inside the Dragon Clan.

It was just that even though the Dragon Clan’s teleportation formation was pretty decent, the locations that it could teleport to were limited to only within the Holy Light Galaxy.

If Chu Feng wanted to head to the Nine Souls Galaxy, he still needed to head somewhere else first.

In that place, there was an ancient teleportation formation that very few people knew of. It was a teleportation formation that could bring him straight to the Nine Souls Galaxy.
