Chapter 2556 - Mysterious Individual, Blue Gown

At the moment when Chu Feng and Zi Xunyi were rushing toward the Kong Heavenly Clan, the Zhou Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief brought with him a total of five True Immortal-level Utmost Exalted Elders and arrived in the Kong Heavenly Clan.

At that moment, they were all in a hidden palace. It was a Kong Heavenly Clan’s forbidden area.

“Didn’t you agree to bring all of your True Immortals over?” The Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“I have brought five of our six Utmost Exalted Elders. Is that not enough? You need to allow me to leave one behind to protect my clan, no?” The Zhou Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“Forget about it, forget about it,” The Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief waved his hand in a somewhat dissatisfied manner.

“Didn’t you tell me to bring all of our clan’s battle power over for the sake of eliminating Chu Feng?”

“Since that’s the case, do you know where Chu Feng is right now?” The Zhou Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief asked.

“It is best for Grandmaster Prophet to explain this to you,” As the Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief spoke, he opened the a door in his palace hall.

Then, a figure walked out from it.

It was a white-gowned old man. He was Grandmaster Prophet.

“Grandmaster, could it be that you managed to prophesy something?”

At that moment, the Zhou Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief as well as the five Zhou Heavenly Clan’s Utmost Exalted Elders all looked to the crystal ball in Grandmaster Prophet’s hand.

It was the Prophecy Crystal Ball. The reason why Grandmaster Prophet’s prophecies were so accurate was all because of that Prophecy Crystal Ball.

“I’ve prophesied that Chu Feng will arrive at the Kong Heavenly Clan in the near future,” Grandmaster Prophet said.

“Arrive at the Kong Heavenly Clan? Could it be... that he’s planning to take the initiative to attack you all?” The Zhou Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief looked to the Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

“That’s most likely the case. The reason for that is because Grandmaster Prophet has prophesied that Chu Feng will not be coming alone. There will be two other individuals accompanying him,” The Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“Those two other individuals must be Zhao Hong and Wang Qiang. Merely three brats, what sort of storm could they possibly raise?” The Zhou Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

Right at that moment, Grandmaster Prophet added, “While it is certain that Chu Feng is coming, I am still unable to ascertain who the other two individuals are. As of now, the only thing that is certain is that one of them is a woman. As for that woman, she is a True Immortal.”

“True Immortal-level woman?”

“Impossible. Regardless of how heaven-defying that Zhao Hong might be, it would still be impossible for her to raise her cultivation to the True Immortal realm in such a short period of time.”

The Zhou Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief revealed a tensed expression as he asked, “Chu Feng has found another helper? Could it be that he has brought forth the person behind him?”

“Didn’t you say that there was a True Immortal helping Chu Feng when you were trying to eliminate him two years ago?”

“No, that’s not the case. According to our investigation, the True Immortal that helped Chu Feng two years ago was a man,” The Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“In that case, does that mean that his backing has changed? There are others backing Chu Feng now?”

“Grandmaster Prophet, that individual... what is her cultivation?” The Zhou Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief asked nervously.

If it was the same True Immortal that had helped Chu Feng two years ago, he would not be that nervous. After all, they knew that True Immortal was only a rank one True Immortal.

However, they were thinking the entire time that since Chu Feng dared to act so absolutely unrestrained in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, he very likely possessed a powerful character backing him.

He was afraid of that powerful character acting for Chu Feng. Most importantly, they were all uncertain as to what the cultivation of Chu Feng’s backer might be if he really did possess someone backing him.

“My apologies, as of now, this old man is only able to determine that one of the two individuals is a True Immortal. As for their exact cultivation, I am unable to predict it,” Grandmaster Prophet declared.

“Exactly who is she?” At that moment, the Zhou Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief started to frown.

He was a bit panicky. After all, no matter how confident he might be, he would still fear the unknown.

Moreover, this battle concerned their life and death. In fact, it concerned the continued existence of their two clans. As such, he would naturally be worried.

“That is precisely the reason why I had you bring all of your Zhou Heavenly Clan’s battle power over,” The Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“However, if that person is a rank three True Immortal, what are we to do then?” The Zhou Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief suddenly asked.

“You’re scared?” The Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief asked.

“Actually, our conflict with Chu Feng is not that deep. It would be one thing if it were only him. We naturally cannot forgive him.”

“However, if he truly possesses backing that we cannot defeat, then...” The Zhou Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was evidently showing signs of cowardice.

The reason for that was because he deeply believed in Grandmaster Prophet’s prophecy.

“If he possesses a rank three True Immortal behind him, then it would most definitely be someone from the Upper Realms. If the people from the Upper Realms are to interfere in this matter, I will also not resign myself to fate,” Right at that moment, a voice suddenly sounded. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Following that, a figure appeared.

This person was wearing a blue gown. The blue gown covered that individual’s facial appearance. As such, one simply could not see his facial appearance.

However, the aura he emitted was exceptionally valiant. Even the Zhou Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, that rank two True Immortal, felt himself to be insignificant before that blue-gowned individual.

“This person is?” The Zhou Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief’s expression changed. He looked at the Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

The reason for that was because he did not know that individual. However, he was able to faintly sense that this blue gowned individual was extremely extraordinary.

Else, it would be impossible for them to have not noticed him in the slightest even though he was right beside them.

“Weren’t you very curious as to why I still dared to make an enemy out of that Chu Feng after experiencing the power of his Demon Armament?”

“The reason for that is because this senior is standing behind our Kong Heavenly Clan. He is willing to support us,” The Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief introduced.

“You can call me Blue Gown,” That mysterious blue-gowned individual said.

“Senior Blue Gown, you are willing to help us take care of that Chu Feng?” The Zhou Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief reacted as if he had seen a savior.

Even though it was the first time he had met that Blue Gown individual, and he knew nothing about him, he was able to tell judging from the situation at hand that that mysterious individual should be from the Upper Realms.

Furthermore... he was willing to stand on their side.

If such a powerful existence were to help them, then regardless of how formidable the existence behind Chu Feng might be, they would no longer be afraid.

“I cannot attack people from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. Thus... unless there’s someone from the Upper Realms involving themselves in this matter... I cannot interfere.”

“However, I am still able to assist you all. For example, there’s this,” As the man spoke, he extended his palm.

There was a jade pendant on his palm. The pendant was gold in color and round in shape. When it appeared, it immediately unleashed an intense ancient aura.

Most importantly, on that round jade pendant were ancient characters, two large characters inscribed onto it -- Demon Suppression!!!

“Senior, is this the treasure that you mentioned?”

Upon seeing the jade pendant, the Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was immediately overjoyed and filled with endless excitement.

“What is that?” The Zhou Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief asked curiously.

“This is a Demon Armament Suppression Talisman. It is especially used to suppress Demon Armaments,” That Blue Gown said.

“Demon Armament Suppression Talisman? What use does it have?” The Zhou Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief asked.

“Two years ago, Chu Feng nearly eliminated our entire Kong Heavenly Clan. At that time, no one was backing him. He relied completely on his Demon Armament that he held in his hand.”

“Senior Blue Gown mentioned before that he was capable of finding a treasure capable of suppressing Chu Feng’s Demon Armament. It is precisely due to that talisman that I dared to declare war on Chu Feng again,” The Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

His words were absolutely not empty words.

Two years ago, after he personally witnessed the power of Chu Feng’s Evil God Sword and after Chu Feng decided to spare them for some unknown reason, the Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief made the decision to no longer make an enemy of Chu Feng.

The reason for that was because he knew that Chu Feng, with the power of the Demon Armament in his hand, was truly capable of completely exterminating their Kong Heavenly Clan.

Thus, even though Zhao Hong and Wang Qiang were attacking their Kong Heavenly Clan nonstop over the past two years, their Kong Heavenly Clan never really tried to suppress Zhao Hong and Wang Qiang.

They were not afraid of Zhao Hong and Wang Qiang. Rather, they were afraid of Chu Feng.

Although Chu Feng had disappeared for two years, the Kong Heavenly Clan still firmly remembered the nightmare from two years ago.

In fact, the Kong Heavenly Clan had been unable to ascertain whether or not Chu Feng would seek them for revenge, should he still be alive.

This sort of struggle and unease caused the Kong Heavenly Clan to live the past two years in great misery. This was especially true for the Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief. He was practically unable to sleep properly every night.

He always had nightmares upon sleeping. It was always the same nightmare, the nightmare of Chu Feng arriving at their Kong Heavenly Clan with that Demon Armament in hand.

Then, before his face, Chu Feng beheaded everyone from their Kong Heavenly Clan. Regardless of whether they were men or women, young or old, not a single person was spared. In the end, even he himself was not spared.

Thus, he always felt that Chu Feng would one day reappear and seek revenge against their Kong Heavenly Clan.

When the news of Chu Feng’s reappearance arrived not long ago, the worry that he had magnified by an unbounded amount.

Although Chu Feng did not rush to their Kong Heavenly Clan with killing desire and Demon Armament in hand, the Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief felt that day would arrive sooner or later.

However, right at that moment, the mysterious blue-gowned individual appeared.
