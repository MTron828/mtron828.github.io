Chapter 5729: The Clan Chief’s Plan

“Did no one look into Huangfu Shangting’s disappearance?” Chu Feng asked.

Only those of extraordinary talent could reach Heavenly God level. It would stand to reason that Huangfu Shangting was a renowned figure.

“Not at all. He must have stumbled upon a fortuitous encounter and gone into closed-door cultivation. He should have made his name in the world of cultivation, but he chose to make an enemy out of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion and ended up disappearing without making a splash,” the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“Thank you for your advice.”

Chu Feng finally realized why his father hadn’t saved his mother yet despite his tremendous strength. The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion did have an even stronger powerhouse.

He realized how lucky he was to be able to escape from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion the last time he wreaked havoc there.

“Young friend Chu Feng, why do you ask that?” the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief asked.

“I wish to know more about the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. It’s only a matter of time before I have a showdown with them,” Chu Feng replied.

“You and the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion?”

The Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief was stunned.

He didn’t know about Chu Feng’s confrontation with the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, as the Totem Dragon Clan had been facing a revolt while he was wreaking havoc in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. He was later defeated and incarcerated, so it was no wonder he hadn’t heard about Chu Feng’s affairs.

Chu Feng told the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief that Jie Ranqing was his mother and that the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion harbored great hostility toward his father.

“Young friend Chu Feng, were you the one who induced the phenomenon of the Ruler’s Bloodline and the nine-colored heavenly lightning?” The Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief was taken aback.

Even though he was already imprisoned then, he still saw the bloodline phenomenon at the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.

“Yes,” Chu Feng replied with a nod.

“Jie Tianran must be blind! He actually refuses to acknowledge such an outstanding grandson?” the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief cursed. “Young friend Chu Feng, as talented as your mother is, your father is definitely worthy of her. No one in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion holds a candle to your father, including Jie Mubai. Jie Tianran will regret his decision.”

“I don’t care whether he regrets it or not. If he dares to make my mother suffer, I won’t let him off the hook,” Chu Feng said.

The Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief knew that Chu Feng wasn’t just bragging.

Chu Feng was already talented as he was, and his two powerful bloodlines would only push him to greater heights. It wouldn’t be a stretch to claim he was the most talented junior of the current generation.

Furthermore, that terrifying protection formation he had unleashed showed that he did have powerful backing. Even the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion would have to think twice before messing with Chu Feng.

The Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief hesitated before speaking up with a look of shame, “Young friend Chu Feng, please keep what I have told you a secret. Our Totem Dragon Clan can’t afford to offend the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion at this juncture.”

“Rest assured, elder, I’ll keep it a secret,” Chu Feng replied.

“My apologies, young friend Chu Feng. I wouldn’t have feared the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion if I was alone, but I have an entire clan behind me. It’s my duty as the clan chief to consider their safety,” the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief said with a lowered head.

Chu Feng had just saved them, but he showed such a cowardly side despite having just heard about Chu Feng’s enmity with the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.

“I understand, elder. There’s actually another matter that I’m hesitant to speak about,” Chu Feng said.

“Oh?”

“I chanced upon a unique beast by a stroke of luck. This beast possesses exceptional abilities. As soon as the ancestral dragon’s secret skill was lifted, it devoured the dragon essence in my body, and it’s impossible to extract the dragon essence from it,” Chu Feng said.

“What beast has the ability to devour Lord Ancestral Dragon’s dragon essence?” the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief asked in surprise.

“It’s here. Come out and apologize to the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief.” Chu Feng tried to pull out the Heaven-devouring Qilin imprinted on his robe, but he was unable to do so.

“Who does he think he is to deserve an apology from me? Little Feng, I’ll apologize to you for acting without your permission, but you shouldn’t think that I’ll humble myself and apologize to every cat and dog on the street,” the Heaven-devouring Qilin said those words aloud, such that even the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief could hear them.

“You’re being rude,” Chu Feng said in displeasure.

He tried to use his martial power to pull out the Heaven-devouring Qilin, but it was to no avail.

The Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief was in an awkward position, but he stepped in and said, “Calm down, young friend Chu Feng. An existence that remains unfazed after consuming Lord Ancestral Dragon’s dragon essence is bound to be extraordinary. I understand its reluctance to apologize to me.”

“Hah, at least you do know your place. All right, I’ll make it up to you one day,” the Heaven-devouring QIlin said.

The Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief chuckled. He was a galaxy overlord despite the recent turmoil. He had only remained composed on Chu Feng’s account, not out of deference for the Heaven-devouring Qilin. He didn’t expect much from the latter’s compensation.

He turned to Chu Feng and said, “Young friend Chu Feng, our Totem Dragon Clan would have fallen into decline if not for you. While the dragon essence is important to us, I’d rather give it to the beast you’re rearing than let Long Lin have it.”

“Elder, you’re truly generous. You’re nothing like the pig I’m rearing,” Chu Feng remarked.

“Pig?” The Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief was stunned. He took a closer look at the imprint, and indeed, it was no different from a pig.

“Elder, do you know Long Xue?” Chu Feng asked.

The Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief had heard of Long Xue; the latter was a prodigy in her era, but she caught an illness that ruined her future. This showed that Long Lin didn’t lie to Chu Feng about her.

In contrast, the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief hadn’t heard about Long Lin before. He was unaware that there was such a person in the Totem Dragon Clan, which prompted him to turn to Chu Feng and ask about how the two of them met.

So, Chu Feng shared with the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief his history with Long Lin.

“That Long Lin is a despicable scum! He exploited you even though you treated him so well! Don’t worry, young friend Chu Feng. I’ll get rid of Long Lin,” the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief said determinedly.

“Elder, what do you intend to do?”DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Chu Feng sensed that the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief was in a severely weakened state, and his cultivation was impaired too.

“I’ll be honest with you. He sprung an assault on me that day, and I received severe injuries that affect my cultivation even to this day. On top of that, I had to break free of the ancestral dragon’s secret skill to slay those nine traitors, and that resulted in a severe backlash. The elders and I will have to spend some time recuperating to regain our cultivation. We might have been defeated this time around, but we managed to secure the retreat of most of our clansmen, so our foundation is still intact.

“One day, I’ll slay Long Lin, Taishi Xingzhong, and all of the traitors. I’ll also take down the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect as well!” the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief said with calm eyes that were filled with rage.

He already had a plan in mind.

“Wu…”

Groans echoed on the ship, as more Totem Dragon Clansmen regained consciousness.

As soon as they saw Chu Feng, their eyes gleamed with respect. They respected him as their savior, but at the same time, they were intimidated by the prowess of the lightning formation they had witnessed earlier.

They understood that Chu Feng was not just a talented prodigy. He also had a strong backing.
