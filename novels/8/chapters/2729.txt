Chapter 2729 - Darkstone Dagger

It was a black dagger. It did not seem to be made of metal. Instead, it seemed more like it was made of some kind of gemstone. There were no gorgeous carvings on the dagger. It was merely an ordinary dagger. However, undoubtedly, the dagger was very refined.

It was a simple sort of refined.

The dagger was an actual Immortal Armament. However, compared to the rest of the Immortal Armaments on the second level, that dagger was extremely ordinary in quality. This could be seen by the fact that the aura emitted by the dagger was inferior to the other Immortal Armaments. It could even be said that that dagger was the worst of all the Immortal Armaments present.

That being said, as Chu Feng approached the dagger, the dagger started to tremble more and more intensely. Its trembling grew so intense that everyone was able to see it clearly.

“A resonance. An Immortal Armament actually resonated with little friend Chu Feng!”

“This is simply unimaginable! If I didn’t witness it myself, I truly would not dare to believe that an Immortal Armament from the Immortal Armament Armory would resonate with someone!”

The crowd burst into an uproar. They were unable to contain their excitement.

They were reacting as if they were the one to cause that Immortal Armament to resonate.

That being said, their reactions were understandable too. After all, to them, this was something akin to a miracle.

As for them, they were all witnesses to this miracle. To them, this was a sort of honor. Thus, they would naturally be excited and overjoyed.

“Lord Villa Master, this...”

At that moment, the fiery red-haired old man looked to the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master.

Although he was feeling joy for Chu Feng when Chu Feng made all of the Incomplete Immortal Armaments on the first level of the Immortal Armament Armory resonate, a worried expression emerged on his face when Chu Feng managed to cause an Immortal Armament on the second level to resonate with him.

His reaction was understandable too. After all, the value of Immortal Armaments greatly surpassed that of Incomplete Immortal Armaments. Even for the Immortal Armament Villa, an Immortal Armament was a treasure of considerable value.

They were neither friends nor relatives to Chu Feng. Thus, they would naturally not be willing to part with an Immortal Armament and give it to Chu Feng.

“This is his ability. Thus, we should keep our promise,” The Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master said.

“This...” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

The red-haired old man seemed to want to so saything. However, he didn’t know what to say. In the end, he sighed helplessly and unwillingly.

“Senior, did you see that? This Immortal Armament seems to have resonated with me,” With a smile on his face, Chu Feng spoke to the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master.

It was as if Chu Feng was reminding the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master that he, Chu Feng, had succeeded.

“Clap, clap, clap~~~”

The Immortal Armament Villa’s VIlla Master started to clap. At the same time, he was clapping, he smiled and said, “Sure enough, little friend Chu Feng is a dragon among men. You are truly amazing. You were actually capable of causing an Immortal Armament to resonate with you. Even for this old man, this is the first time that I’ve seen something like this.”

“Men! Go and retrieve the Darkstone Dagger.”

After the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master said those words, a person entered the Immortal Armament Villa.

After a short while passed, that person returned. In his hands was a case.

That case was very exquisite. After the case was handed to the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master, the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master waved his sleeve and began to form hand seals single-handedly.

“Clamor~~~”

The next moment, the Immortal Armament Armory and the lake floating in midair began to fly toward the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master like a water dragon.

In the end, they turned into a ball of water. That ball of water looked exactly the same as before.

The Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master put the ball of water away. Then, he soared into the sky and walked over to Chu Feng.

He opened the case. A weapon was lying inside the case. That weapon was precisely the dark black dagger.

As for that dagger, it was no longer formed with a spirit formation. Instead, it was an actual Immortal Armament.

“Little friend Chu Feng, congratulations,” The Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master handed the Immortal Armament, together with the case, to Chu Feng.

“Thank you senior,” Chu Feng received the case. A joyous expression was present on his face.

That was an Immortal Armament. Chu Feng still did not know how valuable an Immortal Armament was. However, he was certain that it was valued far more than an Incomplete Immortal Armament.

“There’s no need for thanks. This is something that you’ve obtained with your own capability,” The Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master replied with a smile on his face.

“Senior, may I know why this weapon is called the Darkstone Dagger?” Chu Feng asked.

“This Darkstone Dagger was refined by my martial uncle. It is also him who named it that. As for why he named it the Darkstone Dagger, I am not too certain myself. Perhaps it might be because it possessed a dark black color,” The Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master said.

“In that case, I would have to thank senior’s martial uncle,”

“Why’s that?” The Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master asked.

“If senior’s martial uncle did not refine this Darkstone Dagger, then this Chu Feng would not have been able to encounter it today,” Chu Feng said.

“Haha. Little friend Chu Feng is truly good with words. Unfortunately, my martial uncle is no longer in this world. Otherwise... he would definitely be happy to know you,” The Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master said.

“He’s no longer in this world? Senior, my apologies. This junior has misspoken,” Chu Feng said.

Chu Feng felt that since the person who created the Darkstone Dagger was the martial uncle of the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master, the two of them must possess a friendly relationship.

Likely, the death of his martial uncle must’ve caused grief for the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master. Thus, Chu Feng mentioning the matter was akin to bringing this to the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master all over again.

“My, you’re overthinking things. Everyone will eventually die one day. This is nothing serious,” The Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master said with a smile on his face. Then, he added, “Little friend Chu Feng, do you mind coming inside our Immortal Armament Villa to have a chat?”

Chu Feng was able to tell that the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master wanted to ask him questions.

This was a good opportunity for him to get to know a grand character like the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master.

Thus, Chu Feng did not refuse the offer, and said, “This junior is honored to be invited by senior. Merely, I have a friend here too. Might it be possible for him to accompany me?”

As Chu Feng spoke, he looked to a certain region of the crowd.

At that moment, the crowd also looked toward that region following Chu Feng’s line of sight.

They all wanted to know exactly what sort of person Chu Feng’s friend was.

As the crowd looked toward the direction of Chu Feng’s line of sight, their eyes landed on Song Xi.

Originally, Song Xi had hidden himself inside the Immortal Armament Villa. However, upon hearing that Chu Feng was going to fight against Chu Xianshuo, he had immediately run out.

Thus, he had also witnessed how Chu Feng defeated Chu Xianshuo, and how Chu Feng caused an Immortal Armament in the Immortal Armament Armory to resonate with him.

At that moment, Song Xi was wild with joy. He was feeling joy for Chu Feng.

Upon seeing that Chu Feng was looking at him, he began to wave his hand at Chu Feng.

Merely, upon seeing Song Xi, the crowd was all startled.

“He is young master Chu Feng’s friend?”

This was practically the response that the entire crowd had upon seeing Song Xi. They did not dare to believe their eyes.

The reason for that was because Song Xi’s cultivation was simply too weak when compared to Chu Feng.

As the saying goes, dragons with dragons, phoenixes with phoenixes, and the friends of mice can gnaw.

Similar people would usually gather in groups. That was very common knowledge.

The disparity between Chu Feng and Song Xi was simply too great.

Thus, to the crowd, Chu Feng and Song Xi simply didn’t resemble friends.

“That’s him. He’s my friend, Song Xi.”

At the moment when the crowd was all thinking that they’d made a mistake, Chu Feng spoke again to clarify to them that Song Xi was indeed his friend.

“We will naturally treat little friend Chu Feng’s friend as an honored guest,” The Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master said.

“Thank you,” Chu Feng clasped his fist.

“Please,” The Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master said.

Then, Chu Feng and Song Xi followed the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master and the various elders of the Immortal Armament Villa and returned to the Immortal Armament Villa again.

Their return this time around was different from before. Because of the fact that Chu Feng was a participant in the hunt, they were staying where all of the participants were staying.

However, this time around, they were not only entering the actual Immortal Armament Villa, but they were also personally invited by the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master. To Song Xi, this was an enormous honor.

He was so excited, that he started crying.
