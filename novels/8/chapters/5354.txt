Chapter 5354: Are the Nine Daoists In Danger?

The woman contemplatively stared at the words manifested by the Heavenly Edict of the Nine Daoists. Unease and worry could be seen in her eyes.

Moments later, an old woman stepped into the palace and bowed, “This old servant pays respect to Lord Lingyi.”

It turned out that the woman in the palace was none other than the daughter of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect’s sectmaster, Jia Lingyi. She was also the culprit behind the downfall of Chu Feng’s grandmother.

“Grandma Jiang, why have you returned?” Jia Lingyi asked.

It wasn’t long ago that she dispatched Grandma Jiang to settle some affairs. The latter’s return meant that something must have happened.

“Lord Lingyi, Sectmaster Bai Ling’s life bead has shattered,” Grandma Jiang replied as she opened up her palm, revealing a shattered life bead. 

“Oh? It looks like he has failed.” Jia Lingyi looked at the life bead contemplatively.

“It was shortly after Sectmaster Bai Ling’s life bead shattered that the Totem Nine Daoists made their declaration. I suspect that the Totem Nine Daoists have been secretly protecting Chu Feng, and Sectmaster Bai Ling died at their hands. Sectmaster Bai Ling isn’t someone with tight lips, so it could be possible that the Totem Nine Daoists are already aware of our involvement in this matter. That might have been the reason behind their abrupt declaration,” Grandma Jiang said. 

Jia Lingyi took her time to analyze the situation herself with narrowed eyes. Moments later, her lips curled into a smile.

“Lord Lingyi, you…”

Grandma Jiang couldn’t understand why Jia Lingyi was smiling when the situation was grim. 

“Why would the Totem Nine Daoists issue the Heavenly Edict of the Nine Daoists after knowing that we’re after Chu Feng? Clearly, they are trying to scare us. But there is no need for the Totem Nine Daoists to do that at all. Looking at it from another perspective, this is good news to us,” Jia Lingyi said.

“What do you mean, Lord Lingyi?” Grandma Jiang asked.

“If the Totem Nine Daoists were truly determined to protect Chu Feng, they would have just knocked on our doors and gotten to the bottom of the matter. It’s extraneous to make such a grandiose declaration. They must be putting on a brave front,” Jia Lingyi said.

“The Totem Nine Daoists are putting on a brave front?”

Grandma Jiang couldn’t understand what those words mean. Why would the powerful Totem Nine Daoists have to put on a brave front?

“That’s right. To put it in other words, they currently don’t have the means to protect Chu Feng, but they are worried that something might happen to him. That left them with no choice but to resort to this move,” Jia Lingyi said. 

“Lord Lingyi, could it be that the rumor is true? The Daoist First Dragon, Second Dragon, Third Dragon, and Fourth Dragon have really gone to the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s remnant,” Grandma Jiang asked.

“That’s likely so. It could even be possible that their days are numbered. Not even the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion dares to step into the remnant of the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect! What the Totem Nine Daoists did was no different from courting death,” Jia Lingyi said.

“The Ancestral Martial Starfield might have fallen into decline a long time ago, but the remnants left behind during its peak remain the most fearsome ones in the world of cultivation. It makes me wonder just how powerful the Ancestral Martial Starfield was at its peak,” Grandma Jiang remarked.

Everyone in the Totem Galaxy knew how powerful Daoist First Dragon and Daoist Second Dragon were. Yet, not a single person would doubt the possibility of them getting trapped in the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s remnant. That was how terrifying the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s remnant was.

“Those were the people who dominated the world of cultivation right after the Ancient Era, after all. However, it does not matter. They have already fallen from grace anyway. 

“With the inception of God’s Era, prodigies are appearing one after another in all of the galaxies. There is no doubt that the current generation will surpass those before. It’s a matter of time before we surpass the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s peak. By then, we’ll naturally overcome those remnants they have left behind. However, the ones to do so won’t be the Totem Nine Daoists.

“If the rumors are indeed true, the Totem Nine Daoists don’t pose a threat to us anymore. The remaining ones are small fry once those four are gone,” Jia Lingyi said.

“Lord Lingyi, what should we do?” Grandma Jiang asked.

“Continue hunting down Chu Feng. We can’t let him live. Inform the Immortal Slaughterer to make a move too,” Jiang Lingyi ordered.

Even though she thought that the Totem Nine Daoists were in a precarious position, the fact that they had gone this far to declare their support for him still alarmed him. It further convinced her that she had to root out Chu Feng once and for all.

“But Lord Lingyi, what if those four from the Totem Nine Daoists didn’t go to the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s remnant?” Grandma Jiang asked out of worry.

“Grandma Jiang, do you think that it’s still possible for us to let bygones be bygones? If Chu Feng chooses to come after us, do you think that the Totem Nine Daoists will simply stand idly by the side?” Jia Lingyi asked. 

The Pill Dao Immortal Sect was no pushover, but it wouldn’t be in its best interest to directly clash with the Totem Nine Daoists. 

“We don’t have any other choice. Besides, that thing is about to begin. Once it comes to fruition, not even the Totem Nine Daoists will be able to pose a threat to us,” Jiang Lingyi said.

“Lord Lingyi, is that true?” Grandma Jiang asked excitedly.

“Mmhm, but it absolutely has to be kept a secret for the time being. You know the consequences if the matter gets leaked,” Jia Lingyi warned.

“This old servant understands.” 

An expectant smile formed on Grandma Jiang’s face. She knew what it meant for the Pill Dao Immortal Sect if that matter succeeded.

“I’ll make arrangements to deal with Chu Feng right now!” Grandma Jiang said as she began backing out of the palace.

However, Jia Lingyi suddenly spoke up, “Wait a moment. If possible, capture Chu Feng alive. Otherwise, do your best to ensure that his corpse remains intact. Jia Chengying mentioned that there’s something peculiar about Chu Feng. I want to see just what kind of power he harnesses inside of him.”

“What if we aren’t able to capture him alive or keep his corpse intact?” Grandma Jiang asked.

“Then make sure you kill him. He mustn’t live,” Jia Lingyi said coldly.

“Understood.” Grandma Jiang took her leave.

Jia Lingyi raised her head to look at the words manifested by the Heavenly Edict of the Nine Daoists in the sky once more. Her unease and worry had already vanished, replaced by a contemptuous smile.

… 

Chu Feng and Bai Yunqing were oblivious to what had happened outside as they were still in the teleportation passageway, not to mention that they were traveling out of the Totem Galaxy.Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

After a long journey, they finally arrived at the Bloodline Galaxy. 

The Bloodline Galaxy was known as a lawless place where sinners gathered. Not wanting to get into unnecessary trouble, Chu Feng and Bai Yunqing concealed themselves with a formation as soon as they stepped out of the teleportation passageway. 

The two of them followed Old Man Zhou’s map and soon arrived on a mountain. This mountain was located in the middle of a desert where a furious sandstorm raged. Despite the humongous size of the mountain, there was not a single blade of grass or tree to be found on it. 

This allowed Chu Feng and Bai Yunqing to get a good view of their surroundings, though that ironically served to confuse them further. They had already employed all of their observation means, but they weren’t able to find anything at all. 

This put them at a loss.

They double-checked the map again; this was the place Old Man Zhou had indicated on it. 

“Big brother Chu Feng, is Old Man Zhou taking you on a ride? There’s nothing here at all,” Bai Yunqing asked with skeptical eyes.

“There isn’t any reason for him to trick us,” Chu Feng replied.

Weng!

A spatial crevice suddenly manifested out of thin air, and a huge formation hand shot out and reached for them. This was the means of a True Dragon World Spiritist; Chu Feng and Bai Yunqing couldn’t dodge it at all.

The two of them were dragged into the spatial crevice, and the scenery around them changed right away.

They were still in the same place as before, but the mountain around them had transformed from a barren desert to a lush forest filled with trickling streams. Greenery could be spotted all around. 

At the same time, two women appeared in front of Chu Feng and Bai Yunqing. The two of them appeared to be middle-aged, but what was more surprising was their identical appearances. One of them had white hair and was dressed in a black dress, whereas the other had black hair and was dressed in a white dress.

They were the ones who had dragged Chu Feng and Bai Yunqing in here. 

Chu Feng glanced at their waists, and his heart shuddered. He noticed that the two of them were carrying a token that had four words inscribed on it: Seven Realms Sacred Mansion!!!
