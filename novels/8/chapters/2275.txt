Chapter 2275 - Endlessly Excited

“Aiya, don’t smile. I am miserable enough.”

“Back then, I was so infuriated by that Kou Kang that I lost my ability to reason. Furthermore, I was confident in our Sunset Cloud Valley.”

“That’s why I thought that I could just gamble, that I wasn’t afraid.”

“However, who would’ve thought that our Sunset Cloud Valley would not be able to find an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist after an entire year passed,” As Xu Yiyi said those words, there was a hint of complaint in her tone. Her complaint seemed to not be aimed at their Lord Valley Master or her master. Rather, it seemed to be aimed at Chu Feng.

As for Chu Feng, he naturally noticed it. He was able to tell that Xu Yiyi was complaining about his refusal to help their Sunset Cloud Valley.

Thus, Chu Feng smiled and said, “Then, do you wish to marry that Kou Kang?”

“Of course not. If I did, why would I make such a bet with him? I merely do not wish for him to continue to bother me. That is the reason why I agreed to the bet,” Xu Yiyi said in grievance.

“I understand then,” Chu Feng nodded. Then, he said to the green skirted woman, “Young lady, may I know at what sort of level the Immortal-cloak World Spiritist invited over by your Three Stars Hall is?”

“Daoist Gold Star that we managed to invite seemed to be an Insect Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist,” That woman replied.

“If that’s the case, then I can handle it,” Chu Feng looked to Xu Yiyi and said, “I’ll battle on behalf of your Sunset Cloud Valley.”

Hearing those words, the woman’s expression immediately changed.

Originally, she had thought that Chu Feng was Xu Yiyi’s friend. That was why she had spoken to Chu Feng with a decent attitude.

However, after Chu Feng said those words, when he stated that he would be able to handle it, and that he would battle on behalf of the Sunset Cloud Valley, the impression the green skirted woman had toward Chu Feng changed immediately.

She was now looking to Chu Feng with a disgusted gaze. The way she saw it, Chu Feng, someone who was not much older than her, was most definitely boasting.

Furthermore, his boasting was no ordinary boasting.

Who was Daoist Gold Star? When ignoring his cultivation, he was an actual Immortal-cloak World Spiritist.

How could someone like Chu Feng possibly be able to handle him?

“Really? Chu Feng, you’re really willing to help us?” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

However, after hearing what Chu Feng said, Xu Yiyi revealed an overjoyed expression. Her expression and her gaze was simply akin to someone seeing a benefactor. It was filled with gratefulness.

Upon seeing Xu Yiyi’s reaction, the green skirted woman’s expression changed once again. She was perplexed and confused by what was happening.

Xu Yiyi was no fool. On the contrary, she was very bright. Why would she reveal such an excited appearance toward someone who was boasting like this?

“Little sister Yiyi, I’ve been here for so long now. Isn’t it about time you give me an introduction?” The green skirted woman said.

At that moment, she suddenly wanted to know exactly who this man before her who possessed a decent relationship with Xu Yiyi was.

She wanted to judge from Chu Feng’s identity as to whether or not he was truly someone with actual ability, or someone that was only boasting.

“Haha, look at me. I was only concerned about my own worries, and forgot to introduce the two of you,” Xu Yiyi said with a beaming smile.

“Little sister Biyu, did you hear about the appearance of a genius world spiritist during Mount Cloud Crane’s Immortalization Assembly held by Golden Crane True Immortal?” Xu Yiyi asked in a deliberately mystifying manner.

“I do. There was a youngster who managed to become an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist on Mount Cloud Crane. Furthermore, he had obtained the good graces of various major powers.”

“If I am not mistaken, that person is called Chu Feng. Mentioning it, that Chu Feng is now very famous in our Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.”

“Likely, in the near future, the entire Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm will know of that youngster by the name of Chu Feng becoming an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist.”

“If possible, I truly want to get to know him too. After all, he is the second young Immortal-cloak World Spiritist to have appeared in our Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm,” That woman began to talk enthusiastically. Furthermore, an expression of anticipation filled her delicate little face as she said those words.

Hearing what the green skirted woman said, Xu Yiyi covered her mouth with her hand and started to chuckle.

“Why are you laughing? Do you not want to know who Chu Feng is?”

“Oh, that’s right. Didn’t you also go to Mount Cloud Crane? Did you see that Chu Feng?” The woman turned to ask Xu Yiyi.

“Not only did I meet him, I already knew him before going to Mount Cloud Crane,” Xu Yiyi said proudly.

“Are you for real, or are you lying?” The woman had a skeptical expression.

“Truth be told, this person here is the Chu Feng that you wish to know,” Xu Yiyi said as she pointed to Chu Feng.

“Ah?” Hearing those words, the woman immediately opened her mouth wide in astonishment.

Stunned. Even though she had guessed that the man before her might possess a special identity, she had never associated him with Chu Feng.

However, upon looking at Chu Feng now and recalling what he had said to Xu Yiyi, she realized that it was truly possible for the man before her to be that Chu Feng.

Else, why would he boast about battling Daoist Gold Star?

“You are really Chu Feng? The Chu Feng who defeated the Four World Spiritist Emperors and became an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist on Mount Cloud Crane?” The green skirted woman stared at Chu Feng as she questioned him.

“It was indeed I,” Chu Feng nodded.

“You are really Chu Feng?” The green skirted woman asked again. At that moment, her eyes were shining.

“Yes, it really is me,” As Chu Feng spoke, he extended his finger and let out a strand of Insect Mark Immortal-level spirit power from his fingertip. Like a little snake, his spirit power began to revolve around his finger.

“Wow! You are actually that Chu Feng?! Wow!!!” At that moment, the eyes of that green skirted woman that were originally shining were now filled with countless little stars.

Then, the green skirted woman grabbed Chu Feng’s hands and said, “Chu Feng, I am a disciple of the Three Stars Hall. My name is Song Biyu. I am extremely pleased to get to know you. So... could we be considered to be friends now?”

“Yes,” Chu Feng said with a smile.

“Wow! This is truly great! I’ve become friends with Chu Feng!”

“Chu Feng, did you know that you’re simply my idol? It is not only me. After hearing about your accomplishments, everyone in our Three Stars Hall viewed you as their idol.”

“You are simply too amazing. You are simply our model. You have truly won honor for us, the younger generation,” The green skirted woman was extremely excited. It was as if she had been fed a stimulant.

“Hey, hey, hey, little sister Biyu, be a bit more reserved, okay?” Seeing this scene, Xu Yiyi spoke in contempt.

“Aiya, it’s not that I’m not trying to act reserved. Rather, I’m seeing my idol here. Furthermore, I’ve become friends with my idol. How could I not be excited?” Song Biyu said with a beaming smile.

She had been tightly grabbing onto Chu Feng’s hands with her fair-skinned and beautiful lily-white hands the entire time. There was not the slightest trace of embarrassment to be seen. Instead, she was elated.

“I truly do not know what to do with you,” Xu Yiyi cast a helpless side eye at Song Biyu. Then, she said to Chu Feng, “Chu Feng, are you really willing to battle on behalf of our Sunset Cloud Valley?”

“Should I watch as you are married to someone that you do not like then?” Chu Feng said with a smile.

“Then there’s no time to lose. Let’s go over there right now,” Xu Yiyi said with a joyous expression.

“Yay, yay, I’m finally able to see a marvelous showdown between Immortal-cloak World Spiritists,” Song Biyu followed after them in great delight.

Seeing Song Biyu’s expression, Chu Feng realized that she was also a simple-minded girl.

Else, as a disciple of the Three Stars Hall, why would she be this happy upon finding out that the Sunset Cloud Valley had found a helper?

However, Chu Feng was fond of her personality. At least, this meant that she did not place much importance on fame and profit.

After that, Chu Feng, Xu Yiyi and Song Biyu left directly for the place where the Sunset Cloud Valley was receiving the Three Stars Hall’s headmaster.

Merely, before they arrived at the palace, they were blocked by a man. To be exact, that man had blocked Xu Yiyi.

This man also had a Three Stars Hall title plate hanging on his waist. He was looking at Xu Yiyi with an extremely lecherous expression.

Without needing any introduction, Chu Feng knew that this person should be that so-called Kou Kang.
