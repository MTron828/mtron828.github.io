Chapter 3412 - Change Within The Formation!

“Sigh.”

Seeing that things had come to a conclusion, Grandmaster Liangqiu sighed in a very helpless manner.

He felt injustice for Chu Feng. Yet, there was nothing he could do. Ignoring the fact that he did not possess the strength to enter the grand formation to assist Chu Feng, even if he could, with Linghu Yuhua present, there was no way for him to help.

As Linghu Hongfei’s guardian, Linghu Yuhua would not allow anyone to do anything detrimental to Linghu Hongfei.

Right at that moment, a figure flew over and landed behind Grandmaster Liangqiu and Linghu Yuhua.

That person was Liangqiu Chengfeng.

“Senior, you’re also here?” Liangqiu Chengfeng immediately bowed respectfully upon seeing Linghu Yuhua. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“With Hongfei here, I will naturally also be here,” Linghu Yuhua had a smile on her face, and appeared very good-natured. Although she was a grand character of both status and power, she did not possess much arrogance.

Hearing Linghu Yuhua’s response, Liangqiu Chengfeng smiled in embarrassment. He actually knew that Linghu Yuhua would be present where Linghu Hongfei was present.

Merely, Linghu Yuhua would generally not show herself before others.

He was not surprised by Linghu Yuhua being there. Instead, he was surprised by Linghu Yuhua showing herself.

When Liangqiu Chengfeng saw the copper mirror that was floating in midair, he came to a complete realization.

That copper mirror was a treasure. Its name was called the Immortality Paradise Mirror.

That mirror had fused with Linghu Hongfei’s soul. Thus, within a certain range, no matter where Linghu Hongfei might be, the mirror would be able to detect the situation around him.

Liangqiu Chengfeng was able to guess why Linghu Yuhua would take out the mirror. Likely, the spirit formation was so powerful that not even his master was able to see the situation inside. Thus, they had to rely on that treasured mirror.

After greeting Linghu Yuhua, Liangqiu Chengfeng cast his gaze to Grandmaster Liangqiu, “Master, are you still not planning to enter the formation?”

The grand formation had entered the most crucial point. They would soon be able to obtain its power. It would all depend on this point as to whether they would be able to make a breakthrough in their world spirit techniques.

If Grandmaster Liangqiu still did not enter the grand formation at that time, he would miss out on the opportunity.

That was why Liangqiu Chengfeng returned to remind Grandmaster Liangqiu at this crucial moment.

“The power that young friend Chu Feng has gone through great difficulty to assimilate was stolen by another, this old man no longer has the heart to enter that grand formation,” Grandmaster Liangqiu shook his head.

Hearing those words, Liangqiu Chengfeng cast his gaze back to the copper mirror. Upon doing so, he discovered that it was actually Linghu Hongfei that had stolen Chu Feng’s power.

“Senior, are you not going to do anything when Linghu Hongfei is doing such a shameless thing?” Liangqiu Chengfeng spoke very frankly, and questioned Linghu Yuhua directly.

“I am only in charge of protecting him. As for what he does, that is his business,” Linghu Yuhua said.

“Even if he does outrageous acts and atrocities that cry to the heavens, are you still not going to do anything?” Liangqiu Chengfeng narrowed his brows. Anger appeared in his eyes.

“Chengfeng, was I not clear enough?”

“My mission is to protect him. I am not qualified to teach him how to conduct himself. Although... I also do not approve of his methods, the path of martial cultivation is as such.” Linghu Yuhua said.

“Indeed, the world of martial cultivators is a cruel one. However, one should be able to distinguish right from wrong. Else, one will not be able to gain acceptance from the people, and even the heavens will not allow one to commit outrages forever. If you all continue to allow Linghu Hongfei to run amok, he will one day pay bitterly for his actions,” Liangqiu Chengfeng’s tone got even worse.

“Chengfeng, that’s enough,” Grandmaster Liangqiu suddenly spoke.

Although he was an Utmost Exalted-level expert, he might not necessarily be a match for Linghu Yuhua should they end up fighting.

Thus, Grandmaster Liangqiu did not wish for Liangqiu Chengfeng to enrange her.

“It’s fine, it’s fine. Actually, what Chengfeng said is very true too. Unfortunately, everyone has their own path of martial cultivation. We all walk different paths. That is the path that Hongfei has chosen to take. I have no authority to interfere with it,” Linghu Yuhua replied with a faint smile.

Seeing Linghu Yuhua acting like that, Liangqiu Chengfeng was at a loss for words. Although Linghu Yuhua was smiling the entire time, her eyes were filled with helplessness.

This meant that she was not lying; she really did not approve of Linghu Hongfei’s actions. Unfortunately, there was nothing she could do.

“There’s been a change to the formation!” Suddenly, Linghu Yuhua’s expression changed. She immediately cast her eyes to the copper mirror.

Grandmaster Liangqiu and Liangqiu Chengfeng also immediately turned their eyes to the copper mirror.

At that moment, practically all of the black flames within the grand formation had been assimilated.

Apart from Chu Feng and Linghu Hongfei, everyone else had fallen unconscious.

However, at that moment, Linghu Hongfei, the person who should have won, had an expression of pain on his face.

It was instead Chu Feng who had a relaxed expression, and appeared completely fine.

Grandmaster Liangqiu, Linghu Yuhua and Liangqiu Chengfeng were all puzzled upon seeing that.

“Boom~~~”

Suddenly, a muffled explosion was heard. The black gaseous flames that were assimilated by Linghu Hongfei suddenly burst out from his body like a tide.

Furthermore, as if they were being summoned, they began to fly toward Chu Feng!!!
