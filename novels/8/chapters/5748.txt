Chapter 5748: The Demon Exalted Isn’t Dead

That voice was from the Descent of the Demon Exalted. It was a secret art created by the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted that was later imparted to Chu Feng.

For a long time, the Descent of the Demon Exalted refused to obey Chu Feng’s instructions. It was only when Chu Feng made a move on it using Protection Bane that it finally spoke the truth.

It turned out that Chu Feng couldn’t use the Descent of the Demon Exalted due to a restriction placed by the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted. The Blood-devouring Demon Exalted had only imparted the Descent of the Demon Exalted to him to locate Chu Feng, though this connection appeared to go both ways.

The Descent of the Demon Exalted had previously mentioned that it could sense the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted when the latter was in proximity.

“You sensed him? Is he in Wang Qiang’s body?” Chu Feng asked.

“Yes, he’s in Wang Qiang’s body, but you shouldn’t make a move yet. The Blood-devouring Demon Exalted is a cunning one, and there’s more to him than what you see. He’s not to be underestimated. I fear he might be up to something,” the Descent of the Demon Exalted said with a fearful voice.

“I know,” Chu Feng replied with a nod.

He knew that the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted was a difficult adversary, be it the restriction the latter had placed on the Descent of the Demon Exalted or the sealed Evil God Sword that he still was unable to do anything about.

The Blood-devouring Demon Exalted was definitely stronger than what he claimed back then. Wang Qiang wouldn’t be able to easily subdue him.

As a matter of fact, Chu Feng had noticed something amiss about Wang Qiang too. The latter had always enjoyed the bustle, but he had hardly shown himself at the Nine Heavens’ Zenith. Chu Feng suspected that this anomaly was related to the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.

He would have to find a safe way to communicate with Wang Qiang regarding this matter. Thus, he spent some time constructing two delicate communication formations. He hid one in his body and the other inside an object.

This pair of formations would amplify the secrecy of their voice transmission. They might be able to circumvent the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted’s surveillance through them.

After constructing the formations, Chu Feng headed out to look for Wang Qiang. They had to deal with the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted as soon as possible, or else the consequences could be dire.

Something flew in Chu Feng’s direction as soon as he stepped out of the white fog.

It was a palm-sized rock, and it landed not too far away from where he was. Runes quickly manifested all over the rock, and the rock emanated a surge of light that quickly enveloped Chu Feng.

“This feeling!”

Chu Feng could tell that the light possessed outstanding penetrative prowess, though it wasn’t dangerous. It was likely a tool to gauge his cultivation.

The light receded into the rock before erupting into a grand light pillar with the words ‘Rank three Half-God’ written on it.

“What’s that?”

“Rank three Half-God? Is that Chu Feng’s current cultivation level? Is he really only at rank three Half-God level?”

Many people in the square noticed the phenomenon.

“Rank three Half-God level… To think that the famous Chu Feng is only at this cultivation level. What a disappointment,” a voice sounded.

Chu Feng turned his head over and saw a man standing not too far away.

The man was tall and brawny, with masculine features resembling a ferocious general on the battlefield. His black robe was covered in lightning marks, reminiscent of a barrage of lightning in the dark sky. He looked dashing.

He had a rectangular, black, wooden crate behind him that Chu Feng couldn’t see through.

Chu Feng knew that this man was the one who had thrown the rock at him.

Shoosh!

Just then, a figure flitted toward the man to kick him in the face. It was Little Fishy.

Her speed as a rank six Half-God level cultivator was impressive, such that the man couldn’t dodge anymore by the time he noticed her attack. He had no choice but to raise his hand to guard himself.

The man succeeded in blocking that kick, but he was still sent flying by its sheer force.

“Xianhai Yu’er? You’re at rank six Half-God level?”

The man wasn’t angry despite being knocked back. He looked at Little Fishy with an enigmatic smile. It was also then that the crowd realized that the man was also a rank six Half-God level cultivator.

“Woah! Xianhai Yu’er is that powerful?”

The crowd was taken aback by Little Fishy’s strength.

Qin Xuan and Wang Quang had previously crossed hands, and they were shown to be at rank six Half-God level. In terms of sheer strength, Little Fishy appeared to be nowhere weaker than Wang Qiang, which was shocking given her young age.

However, this also brought attention to the man.

“Who’s that? He’s at rank six Half-God level too?”

The crowd was initially surprised as that man was a foreign face, but it quickly occurred to them that he was likely to be one of the five Huangfus.

“Let me go. I have to teach him a lesson for daring to mess with big brother,” Little Fishy said.

It turned out she was planning to launch a follow-up attack, but a hand on her shoulder held her in place. It was from Xianhai Shaoyu.

Xianhai Shaoyu turned to the man and asked, “You’re one of the Huangfus?”

“I am Huangfu Jiangyao,” the man replied. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Based on the rankings, he was the second strongest one of the Huangfus.

“Why are you testing out Chu Feng’s cultivation?” Xianhai Shaoyu asked.

“I kept hearing about Chu Feng after coming out of closed-door training and was curious about his cultivation level, so I tested it,” Huangfu Jiangyao replied.

“He isn’t someone you can mess with on a whim. Apologize to him,” Xianhai Shaoyu said.

“Apologize? I merely tested his cultivation level,” Huangfu Jiangyao replied.

“Apologize,” Xianhai Shaoyu repeated himself with a frosty voice.

However, Huangfu Jiangyao wasn’t intimidated in the least. He revealed a taunting smile as he said, “What can you do if I don’t apologize?”

Xianhai Shaoyu’s eyebrows shot up. He was about to make a move when Chu Feng spoke up.

“You don’t have to apologize. I’ll take this as compensation.”

The crowd looked over and saw Chu Feng fiddling with the rock that had gauged his cultivation level earlier.

“Do you think you can take my possessions on a whim?” Huangfu Jiangyao widened his eyes in astonishment. He didn’t think Chu Feng would be so shameless as to take his possession in public.

“You tested my cultivation on a whim. It’s only reasonable for me to take something as compensation,” Chu Feng replied.

“How is that reasonable? Do you even know what that is? Do you know how much it’s worth?” Huangfu Jiangyao asked.

“Of course I know that it’s invaluable. Why else would I want it?” Chu Feng retorted.

“You…” Huangfu Jiangyao was speechless.
