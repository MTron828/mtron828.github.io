Chapter 3494 - Sealed Power

“Grandfather, could it be that Linghu Hongfei is at a disadvantage?” Gong Mingyue asked.

“That’s not the case. They’re merely equally matched,” the Gong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief answered.

“To be able to be equally matched against Linghu Hongfei, that is simply too unimaginable. After all... she’s only a rank one Exalted, whereas Linghu Hongfei’s actual cultivation is that of a rank two Exalted.”

“Judging from this, should the two of them possess the same cultivation, wouldn’t it mean that Linghu Hongfei would not be a match for that world spirit?”

“A world spirit this powerful is simply too terrifying, no? Oh, how enormous of a talent must one possess to have this sort of power. While that world spirit is not the strongest world spirit that I’ve met, she is the most terrifying one,” an old acquaintance of the Gong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“Yet, such a powerful world spirit was actually subdued by Chu Feng,” Gong Mingyue suddenly added.

Once Gong Mingyue said those words, all the surrounding people expressed their agreement.

That said, many of the Gong Heavenly Clansmen revealed complicated expressions upon hearing those words. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

This was especially true for the Gong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief. There was a trace of heartache in his eyes as he looked to Gong Mingyue.

He knew very well how prideful his granddaughter was.

The reason why she looked down on Chu Feng so much, and even went so far as to publicly reject him, was because she felt that he was too weak, and unable to match her.

However, she now had no choice but to recognize how powerful Chu Feng was.

The attitude that she held toward him had experienced such an enormous shift. What she had experienced in her heart was something that others would find very difficult to imagine.

“Boom~~~”

“Boom~~~”

“Boom~~~”

Right at that moment, rumbles began to sound in succession.

The rumbles were particularly ear-piercing. With every rumble, it felt like heaven and earth were going to cave in.

Cultivators around Gong Qing’s cultivation immediately covered their ears with their hands as pained expressions appeared on their faces.

Seeing that, the Gong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief had no choice but to release his own martial power to create a barrier to protect the Gong Heavenly Clan’s younger generations.

The experts from the other powers were also forced to release their own martial power to protect their younger generations.

Had it been before, the Starfield Master Realm would definitely not allow bystanders to release their martial power.

However, this time around, they did not act against the experts that released their martial power.

After all, the battle between Linghu Hongfei and the female world spirit had surpassed everyone’s expectations. It was no longer a battle that the people of the younger generation could withstand.

In fact, even the Starfield Master Realm was forced to use stronger methods to seal away the powers wreaking havoc on the fighting stage.

Although they were able to seal away the destructive energy ripples, they did not seal away the sounds of the battle, for the sake of allowing the bystanders to witness it more thoroughly.

Merely, they never imagined that merely the sound of the battle would reach such a devastating state that it could injure the bystanders. The rumbles were so powerful that many people of the younger generation were unable to endure them.

Due to the situation being like that, the Starfield Master Realm had no choice but to quietly accept the bystanders releasing their martial power to protect the people of the younger generations present.

After the Gong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief unleashed his martial power, Gong Qing immediately obtained relief. As for Gong Mingyue, she immediately rushed up to her to help treat her injury.

“Lil Qing, your ears.”

Upon reaching Gong Qing, Gong Mingyue discovered that a large expanse of blood was flowing from Gong Qing’s ears.

Judging from Gong Qing’s pained look, that was most definitely not a mere physical injury. Likely, her soul was also injured.

It was not only Gong Qing who was in such a state. The other Gong Heavenly Clan’s younger generations, as well as many others of the younger generation present, were also showing the same symptoms.

Those who had suffered more serious injuries had already fainted. It was unknown if they were even still alive.

“Big sister, I’m fine,” Gong Qing smiled and shook her head. Then, she turned her gaze to the fighting stage again.

The stage had been completely sealed away by strong martial power. Although the martial power was transparent and one could still see the stage, powerful energy ripples were wreaking havoc all over the stage, with black gaseous flames and golden radiance all over the place. Thus, for people of Gong Qing’s cultivation, they were simply unable to see what the actual situation of the battle was. Nevertheless, they were able to sense how powerful it was.

“So powerful. Had I not witnessed it myself, I would definitely not believe that a battle between people of the younger generation could reach such a level.”

“The battle for the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s strongest member of the younger generation is truly marvelous beyond my imagination,” Gong Qing exclaimed with admiration.

It was not only the people of the younger generations that agreed with her words; even those from the older generation agreed with her.

“I have seen a lot of matches in the selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars. Today’s battle is indeed the most marvelous.” The Gong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief and many other people from the older generation also sighed with admiration.

“That is?” Suddenly, the Gong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief’s expression became extremely serious.

The reason for that was because he had noticed that the female world spirit had summoned a black warhorse.

After that black warhorse appeared, the female world spirit’s heaven-defying battle power increased from being able to surmount three levels of cultivation to four.

After the female world spirit unleashed such an ability, in addition to the Gong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, the great majority of the people present were also unable to maintain their calm.

Although the crowd were shocked earlier when Chu Feng unleashed heaven-defying performances repeatedly, they were never worried about Linghu Hongfei.

The reason for that was because they knew very well that Linghu Hongfei still possessed hidden trump cards. No matter how powerful Chu Feng might be, he would still not be able to defeat him.

However, things were now substantially different. All of Linghu Hongfei’s hidden trump cards that the crowd knew of were already used. Yet, in such a situation, the female world spirit actually once again gained another level of heaven-defying battle power. With that, how could Linghu Hongfei take her on?

The female world spirit was extremely decisive. Once she summoned her black warhorse, she immediately launched an attack at Linghu Hongfei.

At that moment, many people’s hearts tensed up. They felt that Linghu Hongfei would not be able to withstand the incoming attack.

“Zzzzz~~~”

However, when the female world spirit’s attack approached Linghu Hongfei, dazzling lightning blossomed magnificently on the fighting stage covered by energy ripples.

“Heavens! That power!!!”

“This old man is not mistaken, right?”

At that moment, the people that were able to see the battle revealed even greater astonishment in their eyes.

In fact, even Chu Feng revealed a look of astonishment.

“Grandfather, what is happening?” Gong Qing and Gong Mingyue asked at the same time.

“Chu Feng’s world spirit summoned a black warhorse. Riding that black warhorse, her heaven-defying battle power increased by another level,” said the Gong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

“Ah? Another level of heaven-defying battle power? Then, wouldn’t it mean that Linghu Hongfei...?”

All of the people of the younger generation felt their hearts sink upon hearing those words. This result was not what they were expecting at all.

“Linghu Hongfei is not yet defeated. He will also not be defeated,” the Gong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief added.

“Grandfather, why do you say that?” Hearing the Gong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief’s words, Gong Qing and Gong Mingyue became even more puzzled.

“That’s because Linghu Hongfei has managed to awaken his sealed bloodline power and unleash the Lightning Armor,” said the Gong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

“Ah? The Lightning Armor?!!!”

At that moment, Gong Mingyue, Gong Qing and the other people of the younger generation all revealed astonished expressions.

As possessors of Heavenly Bloodlines, they knew extremely well what the Lightning Armor was.
