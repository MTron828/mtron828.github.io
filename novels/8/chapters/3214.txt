Chapter 3214 - Chu Feng’s Action

At the moment when the crowd was confused, a voice suddenly sounded from that lightning formation.

“Everyone, do not panic. I am Linghu Xiuming of the Linghu Heavenly Clan.”

Although the voice from the spirit formation sounded slightly strange, if one were to listen carefully, one would notice that it was indeed Linghu Xiuming’s voice.

“Someone from the Linghu Heavenly Clan?”

As the people present were all newcomers, they did not know who Linghu Xiuming was. However, they did know about the Linghu Heavenly Clan. After all, the Linghu Heavenly Clan was the current ruler of the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm’s Overlord Region.

However, they were inside the New Excellence Formation, something that the people from the Linghu Heavenly Clan would not enter. As such, why would such a formation suddenly appear, and why would the voice of someone from the Linghu Heavenly Clan be heard from it?

At that moment, the crowd were all bewildered. They were at a complete loss as to what to do in such a sudden unforeseen event.

At that moment, it was Chu Feng who was able to remain calm, and ask that Linghu Xiuming, “Excuse me, is there something you need?”

Once Chu Feng’s question left his mouth, the experts in the plaza were unable to remain calm.

Although Chu Feng and the other newcomers were unable to see them, they were able to see every action from Chu Feng and the others through the water mirror in the sky. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

They all witnessed the bewildered expressions on the newcomers’ faces. Evidently, the involvement of the Linghu Heavenly Clan had caught them at a complete loss.

At a time like that, if anyone was able to remain calm and collected, it would mean that they were remarkable.

As for Chu Feng’s reaction, it was simply perfect.

In fact, that shrewd and experienced look on his face, as well as his calm attitude, simply did not resemble something that a newcomer should possess.

Not to mention the others on the plaza, even Linghu Tiemian was looking at Chu Feng with a complicated expression.

“You must be Chu Xuanyuan’s son, Chu Feng, right?” Linghu Xiuming’s voice sounded from the spirit formation again.

“I am,” Chu Feng answered.

“Were you the one that defeated the Holy Spirit Beast and summoned the Holy Spirit Formation of Light?” Linghu Xiuming’s voice sounded again.

“That’s correct,” Chu Feng replied.

“Brother Chu Feng is truly extraordinary. As someone from the Linghu Heavenly Clan, I must thank you for our Linghu Heavenly Clan, the Nightmare Spirit Clan and the Heaven-reaching Beast Clan’s newcomers.”

“If it wasn’t for brother Chu Feng, they would not have the opportunity to enter the Holy Spirit Formation of Light. Merely...”

“Merely what?” Chu Feng’s expression turned sharp. He realized that the situation was not simple from the way Linghu Xiuming spoke.

“Merely, regardless of whether it might be the Holy Spirit Formation of Light or the Formation of Light, they are both things that only the ruler of the Overlord Region can enjoy. As such, I am truly apologetic to inform everyone present that you all are not allowed to enter the Holy Spirit Formation of Light,” Linghu Xiuming said.

“What?!”

“We’re not allowed to enter the Holy Spirit Formation of Light?!”

“Why?!”

“For what reason?!”

Once Linghu Xiuming’s voice was heard, a huge ruckus immediately arose from the newcomers.

At that moment, the newcomers from the various powers were finally unable to contain their emotions, and all began to ask Linghu Xiuming why they were not allowed to enter the Holy Spirit Formation of Light.

After all, entering the Holy Spirit Formation of Light was something that they were all looking forward to doing. Furthermore, they were also able to enter the Holy Spirit Formation of Light.

They would naturally find it unacceptable for someone to suddenly stand forth and inform them that they were not allowed to enter the Holy Spirit Formation of Light.

“To put it simply, you all are not qualified to enter,” Linghu Xiuming said.

“Qualified?” Hearing those words, Chu Feng frowned. At the same time, a displeased expression appeared in his eyes. He asked, “You said that we’re not qualified?”

“Not to mention the Holy Spirit Formation of Light, even if it’s the ordinary Formation of Light, you will still have to rely on us newcomers from the four regions to summon it. In terms of qualification, the ones that are the most qualified should be us.”

“Yet you actually said... that we are not qualified?!”

Chu Feng’s words were immediately met with agreement from the other newcomers., Many people also began to voice their agreement with Chu Feng.

However, Chu Feng’s words were only met with a disdainful laugh from Linghu Xiuming.

“Qualification is not something that you all get to decide. Instead, it is something that our Linghu Heavenly Clan gets to decide.”

“I was already courteous with you all. I’d advise everyone to not refuse a toast only to be forced to drink a forfeit,” Linghu Xiuming said.

“Your Linghu Heavenly Clan gets to decide? This is the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm. Only the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm gets to decide everything.”

“We will not fight over the fact that we are not allowed to enter the ordinary Formation of Light.”

“However, the entrance to the Holy Spirit Formation of Light is right before us. This indicates that the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm has allowed us to enter it to train. I’m afraid that your Linghu Heavenly Clan should not obstruct us,” Chu Feng said.

“That’s right. The entrance is right before us, how could you tell us that we are not allowed to enter it?”

“If it wasn’t for young master Chu Feng, there wouldn’t be a Holy Spirit Formation of Light. For you to refuse to have us enter it is simply something that cannot be justified.”

“Linghu Heavenly Clan, are you all not being too tyrannical by acting like this?”

Chu Feng’s words seemed to have invoked the public will. All the newcomers began to voice their displeasure.

“Haha. It seems that you all truly do not understand anything.”

“I have already said all that I should say. You all are not allowed to enter the Holy Spirit Formation of Light. If you refuse to listen to my advise, you shall all have to take responsibility for the consequences of your actions.”

After Linghu Xiuming finished saying those words, from deep within the already opened Holy Spirit Formation of Light’s entrance appeared a myriad of lightning.

The lightning gathered in one place and formed a lightning wall. The lightning wall forcibly sealed off the entrance to the Holy Spirit Formation of Light.

“That... that is done by the Linghu Heavenly Clan?! They actually set up a spirit formation to forcibly seal off the entrance to the Holy Spirit Formation of Light?!”

“Too excessive! This Linghu Heavenly Clan is simply too excessive!”

Seeing the lightning wall, the newcomers all felt extremely furious. However, they were also at a loss as to what to do.

They were all able to sense enormous power from that lightning formation. That power was so strong that they even felt fatal danger from it.

Meanwhile on the plaza, seeing the extremely furious yet completely baffled newcomers, the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen, the Nightmare Spirit Clansmen and the Heaven-reaching Beast Clansmen all revealed complacent expressions.

As for the clansmen from the powers of the four regions, they, like the newcomers inside the New Excellence Formation, all felt downcast.

Inside the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm, the Linghu Heavenly Clan dictated everything. Although they were able to train there, they had to comply with the orders of the Linghu Heavenly Clan.

It must be said that they were feeling awfully sullen. However, there was nothing they could do.

“Everyone, look! What is that Chu Feng doing?!”

Right at that moment, someone’s expression changed.

Following that, the crowd in the plaza all noticed that Chu Feng, who was inside the New Excellence Formation, began to emit an overwhelming amount of spirit power from his body. Chu Feng... was setting up a spirit formation.

“Heavens! The marks of that spirit power, it’s actually Snake Mark Exalted-cloak! That Chu Feng... is actually a Snake Mark Exalted-cloak World Spiritist?!”

The crowd were astonished upon seeing Chu Feng’s spirit power. Their astonishment was understandable.

To be a Snake Mark Exalted-cloak World Spiritist at such a young age, this sort of strength was simply too powerful.

Perhaps it was precisely due to that powerful world spirit power that Chu Feng was able to defeat the Holy Spirit Beast and summon the Holy Spirit Formation of Light.
