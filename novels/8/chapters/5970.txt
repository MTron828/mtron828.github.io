Chapter 5971: Totem Nine Daoists Bows In Gratitude

News quickly reached Jie Tian and Ling Mouzi’s ears.

“Did Chu Feng succeed?”

Those from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion had awful looks. They could sense spirit power receding from the remnant; it signified that someone had obtained the treasure in there. Knowing that kind of order Jie Tianran had issued regarding the remnant, they knew that they would be severely punished if Chu Feng took the treasure away.

“Good. He doesn’t disappoint. He must be feeling gleeful now. Wait for him to emerge from the remnant. I’ll show him that he has worked in vain!”

Jie Tian stared at the formation map projected from his token. He spoke with a confident voice, but his face was twitching. He felt indignant that Chu Feng had achieved a feat he hadn’t.

The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s sealing formation was powerful, but it had nothing to do with him. This incident only further proved that he was inferior to Chu Feng in terms of individual prowess. He had utterly lost here.

Ten days passed in a flash.

The crowd gathering outside the remnant was more than a thousand times greater than before. No one had seen Chu Feng yet, but news that this Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s remnant had been cleared spread like wildfire.

The dominant rumor was that Chu Feng was the one who cleared the remnant, and hardly anyone refuted that.

Chu Feng obtained the golden death immunity token and defeated Jie Tian. He even subdued the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s elders, including a Saint-tier elder, forcing them to flee with their tails between their legs. These were all amazing feats.

Even those from the elders were awed by his feat, let alone the juniors.

More and more people gathered around the remnant, wanting to see Chu Feng in person.

Some claimed that Chu Feng had already left after obtaining the treasure, but the crowd was still reluctant to disperse. They still harbored a sliver of hope that they might see Chu Feng here.

In truth, Chu Feng hadn’t left the remnant, and those from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion knew that.

Jie Tian had a formation tracking Chu Feng’s whereabouts, so they could tell that Chu Feng had been dwelling deep in the remnant, not moving in the slightest for the past ten days.

“What is Chu Feng doing? Has he passed out in there?”

“Or is he too afraid to come out?”

“That shouldn’t be. Such remnants should have a teleportation formation to bring him out.”

The elders of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion were confused.

However, Jie Tian calmly replied, “He won’t be able to flee from our grasp no matter what he’s up to. I don’t believe that the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s remnant can teleport him out of this realm.”

...

Meanwhile, Chu Feng was still studying the Initiate Tome.

It took ten days before he finally grasped it. He had to concede that it was indeed a formidable formation. Figuring out the Initiate Tome had given him a deeper understanding of formations.

He might still be a God-cloak World Spiritist, but he could now potentially decipher formations that stumped early or even mid True Dragon World Spiritists. This was how strong the Initiate Tome was.

Even so, this wouldn’t be enough for him to deal with the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. Supposing that they had prepared a formidable formation outside to capture him, what he currently had wouldn’t be enough to deal with that.

However, Chu Feng wasn’t worried.

He had backup here with him—the Totem Nine Daoists. Now that they were no longer restricted by the remnant, they should be able to swiftly recover from their injuries.

No formation could stand in their way if they combined their strength with his expertise in formations.

It would be best if Daoist First Dragon and Daoist Second Dragon were safe and sound, as according to Daoist Fifth Dragon, they were both rank nine True Dragon World Spiritists.

Chu Feng stood up, stowed away the Heaven Tome, and walked out.

When he left the spirit formation gate, he could sense a change rippling from it. At the same time, he noticed that Daoist Ninth Dragon, Daoist Eighth Dragon, Daoist Seventh Dragon, and Daoist Sixth Dragon had awoken.

They were standing in front of the spirit formation gate with Daoist Fifth Dragon and four other foreign faces.

From their positions, Chu Feng could tell that the other four foreign faces were Daoist First Dragon to Daoist Fourth Dragon. With this, the Totem Nine Daoists were reunited. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Chu Feng was overjoyed.

“Thank you, young hero Chu Feng.” The Totem Nine Daoists bowed deeply to Chu Feng.

“Elders, please don’t do this.” Chu Feng rushed forward to support them.

“Young hero Chu Feng, my fifth brother has told us what happened. We might have died here if not for you,” Daoist Ninth Dragon said in gratitude.

“It’s not ‘might’. We would have died here,” the oldest but also the most dignified one of the Totem Nine Daoists spoke up.

“Young hero Chu Feng, this is my big brother, my second brother, my third brother, and my fourth brother,” Daoist Fifth Dragon stepped forward and introduced the four to Chu Feng.

As Chu Feng had guessed, they were standing per their positions.

“Paying respect to the four elders.” Chu Feng bowed to Daoist First Dragon, Daoist Second Dragon, Daoist Third Dragon, and Daoist Fourth Dragon one by one.

“Young hero Chu Feng, there’s no need to be so courteous with us. We have already heard about what happened from our fifth brother. We would have died here if not for you clearing the remnant.

“We shan’t harp on words of gratitude, but we have to at least express it. This is a token of our gratitude. You have to accept it,” Daoist Ninth Dragon said as he passed a Cosmos Sack to Chu Feng.

Chu Feng took a look inside the Cosmos Sack. There were many treasures, including formation materials, pills, natural oddities, and world spiritist resources. Many were useful to Chu Feng.

However, Chu Feng pushed the Cosmos Sack back and said, “Elder, you don’t need to do this. If you feel like you owe me a favor, there is one thing that I need your help with, but it might be tough. I’d understand if you refuse to lend me a helping hand on this matter.”

The other daoists exchanged conflicted looks. They could tell from Chu Feng’s words that this matter was of grave importance.

While they were in a dilemma, Daoist First Dragon asked, “Young hero Chu Feng, may I know what is it concerning?”

“To put it simply, there’s a grudge between me and the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. They know that I’m in the remnant, and they have dispatched many experts here to capture me. Their Saint-tier elder, Ling Mouzi, is outside, and they might have called for further reinforcements. Thus, I’d like to request your help. You just have to escort me out of here,” Chu Feng said.
