Chapter 4251 - The Sacred Ground Turning Into A Cemetery

“It’s finally here.”

As they stared at the sacred light, practically everyone present had looks of anticipation on their faces.

The crowd’s excitement had reached its peak.

Grandmaster Tang Chen and others that had Incomplete Maps of the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain immediately took them out. They wanted to see if they could discover decisive opportunities from their incomplete maps.

At that moment, when some people were filled with joy, there were naturally some people that were worried.

At the same time as the majority of the crowd were absorbed in joy at the opening of the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain, Lu Jie and his senior brothers and sisters were frowning.

“Junior brother, why hasn’t master shown himself yet?”

The disciples of the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted were all looking at Lu Jie.

The reason they were worried was because their master, the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted, still hadn’t revealed himself.

They were afraid that their master would miss out on the opportunity to enter the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain.

But, none of them knew the whereabouts of the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted. Lu Jie was the only one who knew their master’s whereabouts.

“I don’t know either. Logically speaking, master should’ve arrived long ago.”

Lu Jie wanted the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted to be there more than anyone else.

After all, he had received an unprecedented humiliation.

Only his master would be able to stand up for him.

“Buzz---”

Suddenly, the light emitted by the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain began changing.

The light gave off an enormous sense of oppression, and covered everyone present.

Feeling the oppression, those with strong cultivations all narrowed their brows. Expressions of difficulty appeared on their faces.

As for those with weak cultivations, they began bleeding from their seven facial orifices. Some even fell to the ground motionlessly. It was unknown if they had fainted or died.

This transformation made the crowd suddenly realize that the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain was completely different from what they had imagined.

What the opening of the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain brought them was not hope. Rather, it was death.

Seeing that the situation had turned bad, there were people that immediately set off to escape from the vicinity of the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain.

But, right after flying off, those people fell from the sky.

The earth seemed to possess an enormous suction force. They were stuck on the ground and were unable to fly.

Seeing that they were unable to escape by flying, they decided to run away from the region.

But, they soon discovered that they were unable to run either.

All of them were restricted by the enormous suction force. Regardless of how strong their cultivations were, they were all trapped there.

Even Grandmaster Tang Chen, Grandmaster Luo Tuo, the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted and Celestial Fairy Muzhi were unable to move.

What brought the crowd the greatest despair was the fact that the enormous pressure was growing stronger by the second.

It was a threat of death. If they continued to linger there, all of them would be crushed alive by the power of the light.

“How could this be?”

The crowd started panicking. It was not only the people of the younger generation. Even the experts of the older generation panicked.

The oppression was so strong that it affected both their bodies and souls.

The oppression was real, completely real. It was threatening their lives.

In a panic, Yuan Shu turned to Grandmaster Tang Chen for help. “Master, what’s going on? Why is such a terrifying power restricting us?”

As matters stood, he could only put his hope onto his master.

After all, his master was someone with a lot of experience and knowledge. He believed that his master should be able to handle the situation much better than him.

What Yuan Shu didn’t know was that even his master, Grandmaster Tang Chen, was panicking.

Not even Grandmaster Tang Chen understood what was happening.

“Chu Feng, take out your Incomplete Maps of the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain too. See if they might have a way to shove this situation,” Grandmaster Tang Chen said to Chu Feng.

Chu Feng did not hesitate. He immediately took out all his Incomplete Maps of the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain.

But, no matter how he assembled them, no matter how he examined them, he was unable to find any clues at all.

The oppression continued to grow stronger. At that moment, people with lower cultivations were all screaming in pain. Many had already lost consciousness.

“Damn it! Exactly what is going on here?! Wasn’t this an inheritance for world spiritists?! Why would it turn into a cemetery for world spiritists?!”

“This place is simply not a place where one can obtain an inheritance! It’s a place where we’ll end up losing our lives!” Someone shouted angrily. It was Grandmaster Luo Tuo.

Although renowned, Grandmaster Luo Tuo was actually unable to contain his emotions, and started making a huge fuss.

His furious shouts and snarls were thunderously loud. It sounded like a ferocious beast wreaking havoc throughout the surroundings.

But, it was all useless. No matter how powerful his abilities were, despite him being a Martial Exalted-level expert, he was still unable to escape.

Logically, someone of his caliber shouldn’t lose their sense of rationality in such a situation.

But, after thinking about it, it was understandable too.

Grandmaster Luo Tuo was an extremely shrewd person.

He was amongst the first set of people to try to escape after realizing that the situation was amiss.

But, he discovered that he was trapped. Not only was he unable to escape, the threat of death was also pressing closer and closer upon him. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

No, that was no threat. If they were unable to escape from, as time passed, everyone present would end up dying there. The only difference would be who would die first.

When even someone of Grandmaster Luo Tuo’s caliber was crumbling from the threat of death, more and more people started crumbling.

Many renowned individuals began to howl in grief and cry bitterly.

Some were begging for forgiveness. Some were cursing loudly. Some even took forbidden medicines to strengthen themselves in hopes of being able to break free from the restrictions.

But, no matter what they did, it was all useless.

Seeing that he was unable to discover any clues from the incomplete maps, Chu Feng activated his Heaven’s Eyes to examine the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain.

He even took out the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk. He hoped to use it to find some clues.

Yet, all his efforts were in vain.

No matter what he did, he was unable to find any clues that would help him resolve their current situation.

The light coming from deep beneath the ground of the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain was still enveloping the entire region.

All martial cultivators and world spiritists were trapped inside it.

That light was still as sacred as before. It resembled an illumination from the heavens.

Yet, the places illuminated by the light emitted an unbreachable killing intent.

Before that, no one would’ve imagined that the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain that they had looked forward to for so long would become their graveyard.

Small and weak. Being trapped there, apart from feeling how powerful the light was, everyone felt how small and weak they were.

Seeing the light, Chu Feng began to think. “Could it be that this inheritance formation is so powerful that we’re not even qualified to set foot into it?”

Everyone present still stood outside the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain. No one dared to set foot into it.

But, even though they hadn’t set foot into it, they were still able to sense the threat of death.

That feeling seemed to be telling them that they weren’t even qualified to challenge the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain.

How mocking was this?!

Right at that moment, an aged voice sounded from the central region of the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain, “A bunch of scoundrels want to obtain this old man’s inheritance?”

Not only was the voice aged, it was also very powerful, and emitted an ancient aura.

Just hearing the voice, the crowd was able to tell that the person that the voice belonged to was extremely powerful.

“Milord, we had no intention to offend you. Please spare us.”

When the voice was heard, the crowd reacted as if they’d found a lifeline.

Many people began begging for forgiveness and kowtowing with their hands held in front of them.

They no longer wanted to obtain the inheritance. They only wanted to escape from that dangerous place.

But, the ancient voice did not respond to those people begging for forgiveness.

However, it also did not disappear.

Not long afterward, the ancient voice sounded again.

What was said this time had finally alleviated the panicked crowd’s hearts.

They had seen a trace of hope.
