Chapter 4844: Brightmoon Spirit Tower

Boom!

The All-encompassing Net released a white burst of energy that swiftly diffused in all directions at an incredible speed. It took only a blink of an eye for it to fully envelope the Yinyang Withered Well Realm.

However, it wasn’t just stopping there.

The All-encompassing Net was much more powerful than that. It rushed out of the Yinyang Withered Well Realm to spread out even further.

However, Long Xie and the others weren’t too concerned about that. They knew that it was normal for the All-encompassing Net.

At the same time, the center of the All-encompassing Net turned into a mirror surface.

“Let me see the extent of Chu Feng’s talents!”

Lord Long Xie, the monstrous old man, and the others eyed the mirror surface of the All-encompassing Net intently.

Weng!

Soon, the All-encompassing Net finally started to react. A black dot appeared on the surface. It was so small that ordinary mortals wouldn’t have been able to see it, but it didn’t escape Lord Long Xie and the others’ notice.

Not only were they able to see the black dot, but they could see what it was clearly. If one were to magnify the black dot, one would be able to tell that it was Chu Feng.

The color of the black dot started to fade away, and at the same time, its aura seemed to be getting loftier.

Lord Long Xie and the others had known that the All-encompassing Net would react in such a manner, so they weren’t too surprised by it. However, when Chu Feng’s silhouette in the mirror surface turned white, their eyes immediately lit up in delight.

However, that wasn’t the end of it yet.

After Chu Feng’s silhouette turned white, it began to glow. It was flickering with such great radiance that even ordinary mortals would have long noticed it by now.

“His talents are top-notch! Chu Feng is a top-notch prodigy!”

The monstrous old man was excited by the discovery. Even the seemingly calm Kui An was astonished as well. The humanoid monster’s eyes had dilated to the extent that they looked like two full moons. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

All of them quickly turned their eyes toward Chu Feng once more, but the nature of their gazes had changed. They knew just what the glowing white dot on the mirror surface represented.

Anyone who was detected by the All-encompassing Net was worthy of being deemed as a prodigy, and the difference in color represented the extent of their talent.

White meant that a person’s talent had reached an incredible level. If it glowed on top of that, it would mean that the person’s talent was at the top of the top.

If such a person was given time to mature, it was only a matter of time before he became one of the powerhouses towering over the massive world of cultivation.

“You’re making a big fuss out of nothing. I’ve long said that this child has something extraordinary in him. Otherwise, our lord wouldn’t have entrusted the Massacre Forbidden Art to him,” Lord Long Xie said.

He was much calmer compared to the other three, though his voice sounded a little gleeful. After all, he was the first one to put his trust in Chu Feng.

“There are more?”

Their eyes narrowed in surprise.

Two more figures had appeared on the All-encompassing Net. They were prodigies outside of the Yinyang Withered Well Realm.

“It’s Zi Ling and that little brat.”

Long Xie was able to quickly identify the two from their silhouettes.

One of them was Zi Ling and the other one was the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple.

“I’ve long noticed that that brat has something more to him, but I didn’t think that Zi Ling would be regarded as a talent too.”

Both Zi Ling and the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciples’ silhouettes were black at the start too, but their colors began slowly fading.

The lighter the color was, the more talented they were.

“Zi Ling’s talent is actually that incredible?”

A hint of delight flashed across Long Xie’s eyes.

The Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple’s silhouette eventually stopped at gray color. It was the third strongest talent there was.

As for Zi Ling, her silhouette stopped at white color. That was the second strongest talent.

There was only a tier between white and gray, but the gap between the two was massive.

If Chu Feng was destined to rise to the very top, Zi Ling was going to become someone who was second only to Chu Feng. That was definitely within the upper echelons of the massive world of cultivation.

“What an unexpected surprise. I never thought that there would be such a disciple in the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect. It looks like I haven’t used the All-encompassing Net for nothing. To think that it would bring me such a surprise!” Lord Long Xie remarked.

“No, that’s not right.”

Lord Long Xie soon noticed something that made his eyes narrow in astonishment.

When he took a closer look at Zi Ling’s silhouette, he noticed a small blood-red speck. It was extremely small, but someone who had reached Long Xie’s level was able to see it clearly.

When he realized that the blood-red speck was actually an ancient tower, his eyes narrowed in sheer astonishment. Even his massive body beyond the sky trembled as well.

The monstrous old man and Kui An also began shuddering as well.

It was not out of fear but excitement.

“L-Lord Long Xie... Do you see that? A-a-am I seeing things?” the monstrous old man stuttered.

“No, you aren’t seeing things. That’s the tower that Lord Blood Emperor crafted for Lord Brightmoon, the Brightmoon Spirit Tower. To think that someone in the world actually managed to unearth the Brightmoon Spirit Tower!

“That explains why Zi Ling’s talent is evaluated to be at such a level! She has the Brightmoon Spirit Tower in her body! It was hidden so deep that I didn’t even notice it! If not for the All-encompassing Net, I would have really overlooked it!

“Just who could be the one behind this...”

Lord Long Xie’s voice was filled with not just astonishment but curiosity too. He was curious who was the one who placed the Brightmoon Spirit Tower into Zi Ling’s body.

“Lord Blood Emperor personally sealed off the Brightmoon Spirit Tower. Someone who has the ability to remove Lord Blood Emperor’s seal is bound to be an incredible figure.

“Lord Long Xie, allow me. I’ll make Zi Ling divulge the person who placed the Brightmoon Spirit Tower without hurting me,” the monstrous old man said.

“Forget it,” Lord Long Xie rejected the suggestion.

“But Lord Long Xie... don’t you wish to know the identity of the person who broke Lord Blood Emperor’s seal and released the Brightmoon Spirit Tower? That person is bound to be an existence who has the power to shake the world of cultivation,” the monstrous old man asked.

“Of course I do, but there’s no point resorting to such means. Rather than using special means to unearth that person’s identity, we might as well focus our effort on grooming Zi Ling. After all, Lord Blood Emperor chose to seal off the Brightmoon Spirit Tower instead of burying it with Lord Brightmoon in the hopes that someone would be able to bring out its full prowess one day.

“It’s truly the work of fate that the Brightmoon Spirit Tower eventually landed in Zi Ling’s hands, a disciple of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect,” Lord Long Xie exclaimed.

“It truly is the work of fate. Is it possible that... this is the true reason why Milord constructed the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect in the first place?”

The monstrous old man, Kui An, and the humanoid monster stared at the blood-red ancient tower revealed in Zi Ling’s body on the All-encompassing Net intently. None of them was paying any heed to Chu Feng anymore.

To them, the significance of the ancient tower was much greater than that of Chu Feng. For that reason, they felt that the one whom they were waiting for all this while wasn’t Chu Feng but Zi Ling.
