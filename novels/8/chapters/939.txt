MGA: Chapter 940 - Shameless You Mingdeng

Royal Armaments weren’t objects ordinary Martial Kings could create. They demanded not only cultivation of a Martial King, but also the realm of a Royal-cloak World Spiritist.

This was why there was a limited number of Royal Armaments despite there being quite a few Martial Kings—there was not a single Royal-cloak World Spiritist in the Eastern Sea Region.

Imperial Armaments were the same. Not just any Martial Emperor could create Imperial Armaments, because there was still the second requirement: being an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist.

It was a fairly normal occurrence for a Martial Emperor to forge a Royal Armament; however, undoubtedly, a Royal Armament that came from a Royal-cloak Martial Emperor would have superior quality to one that came from a Royal-cloak Martial King. As for this Demon Sealing Sword, it likely came from a Martial Emperor.

“Chu Feng, the formation that surrounds the Demon Sealing Sword seems to be changed,” Eggy said.

Upon a careful inspection, Chu Feng found that the formation surrounding the Demon Sealing Sword had indeed changed. There were layers of closely connected circles, and there were ten layers in total. The pressure within every layer was different.

“They didn’t switch the formation; they just changed something from the original one. It must be the work of those Protectors, but I have no clue what they’re preparing to do,” Chu Feng said.

“Heh, these foolish clowns still dare to select a sect head! Don’t they know the person who’s fulfilled all requirements is here already?” Eggy said as she giggled. The person she spoke of was naturally Chu Feng.

“No matter. We still have time anyway, so we can watch the show they put up.” Chu Feng lightly smiled, and prepared himself for a good spectacle.

Back then, the reason You Mingdeng treated him so poorly was solely because he feared Chu Feng’s potential. He, You Mingdeng, feared his position would be affected if Chu Feng continued staying in the Crippling Night Demon Sect. He was afraid of Chu Feng’s ever increasing fame, which would push him to become the sect head eventually.

But today, when You Mingdeng plotted to rise to the role of sect head, Chu Feng was already all prepared. No matter what You Mingdeng did, Chu Feng would make all his plans fall flat, because this position was Chu Feng’s.

“Everyone, I’m extremely grateful to all of you for returning to the Crippling Night Demon Sect from faraway places and peaceful established lives.

“I had thought, with us three old bones’ rallying power, there’d definitely be quite a few brothers who would be willing to rejoin the Crippling Night Demon Sect and recreate our dominion.

“I had never, however, expected it to be this powerful. After being separated for so many years, just some words from us recalled millions of brothers. This has truly exceeded my imaginations.

“As I feel joy, I must say that I also feel grateful. I thank you all—I thank you, my brothers. If Sect Head is up in heaven, he must also feel very relieved.”

You Mingdeng stood up, and spoke with a solemn and appreciative tone. He even deeply bowed to the Crippling Night Demon Sect’s members in an expression of his gratitude.

“Brothers! Do you remember our Crippling Night Demon Sect’s mantra? Do you remember the declarations when we joined the Crippling Night Demon Sect?” shouted someone amongst the crowd.

“I share my lives with the Crippling Night Demon Sect! I share my dignity with the Crippling Night Demon Sect! When the sect is honoured, I am honoured! When the sect is shamed, I am shamed! When the sect lives, I live! When the sect dies, I die!”

The first shout was the catalyst for the response of the entire crowd. The ones within the palace were the first to shout, then the ones within the tunnel, then, in the end, everyone—over ten million members—who gathered in the Depraved Ravine shouted in unison.

“WHEN THE SECT LIVES, I LIVE. WHEN THE SECT DIES, I DIE!”

The Crippling Night Demon Sect’s declaration was even more deafening than thunder. It not only shook the lands, it shook everyone’s heart.

“Good! My brothers are indeed all courageous men! You are indeed dragons amongst men!

“However, a crowd of dragons cannot lack a leader—the Crippling Night Demon Sect is the same.

“If it weren’t for a lack of leadership in so many years, we wouldn’t have allowed that Immortal Execution Archipelago to rise in power, nor would we have allowed them to disgrace us like this.

“Right now, we are facing a crisis. We cannot sit and await death. We must engage in a counterattack, but before doing so we must find a suitable leader. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Today, we have asked all of you to assemble here just for this. I’m sure there’s a fitting leader in everyone’s hearts right now.

“And if I’m not mistaken, many of you wish for the leader to arise from us Four Protector, and of those people, half of them certainly hope that Qiu Canfeng enters that role.

“That’s right. At this moment, the person most qualified to become sect head is undoubtedly Big Brother Qiu Canfeng. He is the leader of the Four Protectors, but sadly, Big Brother Qiu Canfeng has disappeared for nearly two years. I haven’t even heard anything from him as of yet.

“Even though the Crippling Night Demon Sect is about to begin fighting the Immortal Execution Archipelago, he hasn’t appeared yet. However, from what I know of him, he is absolutely not a person who ignores such matters. If he knows we will soon battle, he would definitely stand out for us, and even be the first to do so.

“But now, he hasn’t. This doesn’t make sense. I have even searched through his residence but I saw no sign of him. No one knows where he’s gone.

“There is no reason for Big Brother Qiu Canfeng to disappear. So, there is only one explanation—he has been met with misfortune, and has been struck by the Immortal Execution Archipelago’s venomous hands,” You Mingdeng said quite sorrowfully.

“What? Great Protector Qiu Canfeng...” Everyone was astonished. They found great difficulty in accepting this as an indescribable sadness and shock spread throughout the crowd.

“He is truly shameless. For his own benefit, he says my master is dead!” Chu Feng cursed in his heart. He, at last, had seen signs of You Mingdeng’s shamelessness.

“Although it is only a guess, it is likely true. Although Big Brother Qiu Canfeng is powerful, I’m sure you all know that the Immortal Execution Archipelago has an old monster—Murong Mingtian.

“Murong Mingtian is able to even defeat Lady Piaomiao, and I’m afraid only the sect head, if he were alive, could stand a chance against him. Even if Big Brother Qiu Canfeng were to fight him, he would likely be defeated.”

Just at that moment, Xue Xiyue also spoke. Even her eyes were a bit red—she had a face of fake sadness.

“Avenge Great Protector, avenge Great Protector!

“A debt of blood must be paid in blood! A debt of blood must be paid in blood!” shouted someone loudly. Quickly following that were others who also raised their fists and yelled. Their voices were like thunder, every single word loud and clear. One could thus see that Qiu Canfeng held a very high position in all of their hearts, his position even surpassing the other three Protectors combined.
