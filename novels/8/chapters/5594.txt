Chapter 5594: Long Xiaoxiao’s Gift

“4000,” the person neighboring Chu Feng’s room upped the bid.

“5000.” Chu Feng didn’t bother beating around the bush either.

“6000.”

“7000,” Chu Feng raised the bid once more, but at the same time, he turned to Eggy and said, “That item is useful to me, but not by much. I personally consider the treasure to be worth 5000 sycees to me, and I’m only willing to pay 7000 sycees for it at most. I’m not going to be a sucker and pay for anything beyond that.”

“Yes, there’s no need to be a sucker just to get back at him,” Eggy replied in agreement.

“10,000 sycees,” the person in the neighboring room declared.

He had raised the bid by 3000 sycees in a breath… That was 10,000 Exalted Armaments!

“Heh…” Chu Feng scoffed under his breath as he stopped bidding.

He definitely had the means to raise the bid and compete with the other party, but he didn’t think that it was worth doing so. He had already inspected the pearl, and its use to him was limited. At the very least, it wasn’t potent enough to raise his cultivation.

He wouldn’t spend 10,000 sycees on it.

Besides, he could sense how determined the person in the neighboring guest room was to acquire the Nine-colored Heavenly Lightning Pearl. The latter would have continued bidding if Chu Feng competed with him. Since the latter was willing to be a sucker, Chu Feng was more than happy to let him play that role.

Thus, the Nine-colored Heavenly Lightning Pearl fell into the hands of the person in the neighboring guest room.

Following that, the final item was finally unveiled in the auction hall. It was a red lotus emanating a blood-colored aura. Without a doubt, that was the Blood Gathering Red Lotus.

Frankly speaking, there was nothing particularly special about the Blood Gathering Red Lotus, be it in terms of its appearance or its aura.

“Is that lotus the biggest treasure of this auction?”

Many in the crowd expressed their skepticism.

“May I present to you the Blood Gathering Red Lotus! This treasure has the exceptional ability to heal one’s soul. The starting bid will be 1000 sycees!” the elder said.

“Haa?! A simple medicinal herb is actually priced higher than the Nine-colored Heavenly Lightning Pearl?”Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Most people in the auction hall failed to understand how the Blood Gathering Red Lotus was worth so much money, so they had no reason to bid for it.

“Isn’t that the biggest treasure for this auction? I thought that they would elaborate more about it so as to raise its value.” Eggy was astonished.

Chu Feng sensed that something was amiss as well. It was common for auctioneers to provide an elaborate introduction about the auctioned items so as to hype up the crowd and encourage more bids, especially since the Blood Gathering Red Lotus was supposed to be the biggest treasure of this auction. Yet, it somehow felt like the auctioneer was downplaying the value of the Blood Gathering Red Lotus instead.

As a result, no one was willing to make a bid. Instead, it drew criticism from the crowd.

“1010 sycees,” Chu Feng made his bid. He didn’t up the bid by too much as he didn’t want to show that he really needed this item.

“What? Someone is spending so much money to buy that?”

“Which young master is that? He must be a fool!”

“Does someone really think that this item is worth that much money? There are so many other treasures that can heal the soul too! There’s no need to squander so much money here.”

The crowd thought that Chu Feng was a fool.

“That guest over there has bid 1010 sycees. Does anyone want to raise the bid?” the auctioneer asked. A second later, he said, “Deal! The Blood Gathering Red Lotus has been sold for 1010 sycees!”

Just like that, the Blood Gathering Red Lotus had been sold to Chu Feng.

“See, the bid was accepted right away. It has to be a scam! I reckon that they didn’t want to give that fellow time to retract his bid lest he regret his decision!”

The crowd thought that Chu Feng had been duped.

“The Ma guy must have pulled some strings to help you secure the Blood Gathering Red Lotus. You owe him a favor,” Eggy said, having figured out the truth.

“Yes, Elder Ma did me a huge favor this time around.” Chu Feng nodded in agreement.

He had come to the same conclusion that the branch manager had been taking care of him too.

As the auction came to an end, the crowd began leaving the premises. Those who had won their bids needed to head backstage to complete their trades. However, Chu Feng only needed to remain in his distinguished guest room, and someone would deliver the goods to him.

It didn’t take long for the Blood Gathering Red Lotus to be delivered into his hands. The person who delivered it was the woman who first received Chu Feng.

“Congratulations, young hero Chu Feng,” the woman said shortly after she entered the room.

“Please thank Manager Ma on my behalf,” Chu Feng said as he took out 1010 ordinary Exalted Armaments.

While Exalted Armaments were invaluable treasures in the Eastern Region, he collected quite a bunch of them along the way. From the looks of it now, he was indeed making a mountain out of a molehill by attempting to exchange his God Armament into sycees.

Chu Feng tried returning the token to the woman too.

The latter accepted the Exalted Armaments but returned the token, saying, “Young hero Chu Feng, our manager said that you should keep the token. You’ll be able to enjoy the same privileges with that token at any of our branches. It may prove to be useful if you wish to join any of our other auctions.”

“I’ll accept this gift then.” Chu Feng accepted the token without beating around the bush.

He believed that favors should be remembered rather than to be harped on. Should an opportunity arise in the future, he would return the favor to Manager Ma.

Having completed his business in the Martial Cultivator Commerce Guild, he opened the door and took his leave, only to find a group of people standing outside. They were dressed in the same uniforms, and they had the same tokens hanging on their waists.

They were all from the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect. Their leader was a dashing young man who was clearly of notable standing.

“Do you need something from me?” Chu Feng asked.

“Not at all. I’m just interested to see the face of the person who dares to vie with me over the Nine-colored Heavenly Lightning Pearl. You do look outstanding, but I believe I am the winner here,” the young man taunted with a smile.

Chu Feng still had matters to attend to, so he simply walked away. The young man also didn’t stop him, choosing instead to watch him leave with disdainful eyes. Just then, a beautiful figure happened to walk over.

Chu Feng was taken aback. The beautiful figure froze in her tracks too.

It was Long Xiaoxiao.

“Chu Feng, what are you doing here?” Long Xiaoxiao asked in excitement.

She was still a distance away from him when they caught sight of each other, but she covered the gap between them with a few swift steps to arrive in front of him.

“Xiaoxiao, what are you doing here?” Chu Feng was both surprised and delighted to see Long Xiaoxiao too, especially since they were on close terms.

The last time they met was at the Totem Dragon Clan’s Trial of the Strongest. It hadn’t exactly been a long time since then, but Chu Feng had been through so much in the meantime that it felt like a long time had passed.

“Junior Xiaoxiao, you know him?” the young man from the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect walked over and asked.

His expression was significantly tensed up compared to before, as it was apparent that Chu Feng and Long Xiaoxiao were close to each other.

Long Xiaoxiao didn’t answer the young man’s question, instead asking, “Senior Qin Hang, did you manage to obtain the item I requested?”

“I did. There’s no way I would err on a request made by Junior Xiaoxiao,” Qin Hang said as he took out an item and passed it to Long Xiaoxiao.

It was the Nine-colored Heavenly Lightning Pearl, the treasure he had spent 10,000 sycees on earlier in the auction.

Qin Hang watched as Long Xiaoxiao took the Nine-colored Heavenly Lightning Pearl before turning to look at Chu Feng gleefully. His expression seemed to be saying ‘So what if you know Xiaoxiao? Your capability is nowhere near mine! I can get her what she wants. Can you do the same?’

To his shock, Long Xiaoxiao passed the Nine-colored Heavenly Lightning Pearl to Chu Feng and said, “Chu Feng, this is the Nine-colored Heavenly Lightning Pearl. It’s useful to cultivators possessing the Heavenly Bloodline. It’s a gift I have prepared for you.”

The glee on Qin Hang’s face disappeared without a trace. His mouth fell agape as if someone had stuffed feces down his throat. He looked as if he wanted to vanish on the spot.
