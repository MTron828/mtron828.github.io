Chapter 5524: The Powerful Blood-eyed Qilin Clan

The Totem Phoenix Clansmen quickly understood what was going on once they turned their sights to Chu Feng. The latter was emanating the spirit power of a Gold Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist, which meant that he was a formidable world spiritist!

However, this only drew further questions.

A Gold Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist was only comparable to a rank five Half-God level cultivator, whereas Feng Jiuyue was a Royal Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist, which was comparable to a rank six Half-God level cultivator.

How could Chu Feng defeat Feng Jiuyue despite their power disparity?

“Y-you’re actually…” Feng Jiuyue stared at Chu Feng with a mix of fear and despair.

It was only a single exchange, but it made her realize that Chu Feng was extremely powerful. The latter’s fighting prowess was far stronger than hers although her spirit power was above his. She didn’t stand a chance against him at all.

“Is that fellow’s spirit power even stronger than his martial cultivation?”

Even the severely injured Feng Tiansheng was horrified. Despite his earlier indignation about his defeat, he started to fear for Chu Feng. He was not the one directly confronting Chu Feng at the moment, but he knew how strong his big sister was as they often sparred.

And the two of them were often equally matched. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

The fact that Chu Feng was able to defeat his older sister so quickly meant that he would likely face the same plight if he crossed blows with him now.

“What’s your relationship with the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion?” Chu Feng asked.

“Kill me if you want to, but I can’t tell you anything about that,” Feng Jiuyue said.

Chu Feng chuckled softly.

With a fist containing the might of his formation, he punched at the sealing formation. Cracks quickly spread over the surface of the sealing formation before finally shattering into pieces.

The Totem Phoenix Clansmen were stunned.

They finally understood how scary the young man named Chu Feng was. Their most talented martial cultivator and world spiritist in their clan’s history was thoroughly lost to him! Now that their strongest duo had been defeated, all that was awaiting them was death.

Shoosh!

However, Chu Feng waved his sleeves and returned the phoenix avatars to Feng Tiansheng and the other Totem Phoenix Clansmen.

“Don’t ever mess with me and the Totem Dragon Clan again. I won’t be so courteous next time,” Chu Feng said before heading toward the formation.

The Totem Phoenix Clansmen were rendered speechless.

It was only now that they understood that Chu Feng wasn’t trying to make things difficult for them; he only wanted to teach them a lesson. In the first place, they were the ones who had provoked him.

Chu Feng finally turned to Long Zhizhi and Long Yuhong and asked, “Is Brother Chengyu and the others in danger?”

“That’s right.” Long Yuhong and Long Zhizhi nodded.

“Lead the way,” Chu Feng said.

“But…” Long Zhizhi was at a loss.

“Lead the way right now!” Chu Feng spoke with a heavier tone.

“Let’s go.”

Long Yuhong took the lead, and Chu Feng and Long Zhizhi followed her.

“Tell me now what has happened. Is it the Blood-eyed Qilin Clan?” Chu Feng asked along the way. He could roughly guess what had happened even without them saying a word.

“That’s right,” Long Yuhong replied with a nod before sharing what had happened.

The two clans had been individually competing over the formations thus far, but they eventually encountered each other. Neither was willing to submit to the other, resulting in a conflict.

However, the Blood-eyed Qilin Clansmen showed no mercy. Upon claiming a dominant position, they proceeded to slaughter the Totem Dragon Clansmen. Only a minority survived the ordeal, but even so, all of them sustained severe injuries.

There was no way the Totem Dragon Clan could let things rest like that.

Long Chengyu and Long Muxi marched forth to avenge their clansmen. Long Yuhong, Long Zhizhi, and the others also quickly rushed over, hoping to offer some help.

However, the situation wasn’t optimistic when they arrived.

The rank five Half-God level Blood-eyed Qilin Clansman was present too, and he had started crossing blows with Long Chengyu. He proved to be a troublesome adversary. Long Muxi had sustained severe injuries, whereas Long Chengyu had fallen into a disadvantageous position.

To make things worse, the rank five Half-God level Blood-eyed Qilin Clansman was blazing with killing intent. Should he emerge victorious, he wouldn’t hesitate to kill Long Chengyu and Long Muxi.

Due to that, Long Yuhong and Long Zhizhi quickly rushed off to look for Chu Feng, thinking that he was the only one who could save them.

“Why did you hesitate to show me the way then?” Chu Feng asked.

“I know that you’re strong, but that rank five Half-God level Blood-eyed Qilin Clansman is simply too scary. I’m afraid that…” Long Zhizhi lowered her head. She was afraid that something bad would happen to Chu Feng.

“Point the direction out for me,” Chu Feng told Long Yuhong.

Long Yuhong quickly did as she was told. Chu Feng first confirmed the direction before rushing over using Divine Flitting, dragging Long Yuhong and Long Zhizhi together with him. He wouldn’t be able to use Divine Flitting for too long, but it could at least reduce the traveling time.

By alternating the usage of Divine Flitting with his other movement skills, Chu Feng soon heard a commotion ahead of him. He continued traveling for a while longer, and he soon encountered Long Muxi and the Blood-eyed Qilin Clansmen.

Long Muxi had sustained severe injuries. She had lost her right arm, and her right shoulder had been impaled. Blood was trickling down her body, and her breath had become extremely faint. The Totem Dragon Clansmen around her were also severely wounded, and some of them had even breathed their last.

To make things worse, the Blood-eyed Qilin Clan held all of the injured Totem Dragon Clansmen hostages, and they didn’t hesitate to gobble up the deceased. Even Chu Feng was revulsed by the sight.

It was worth mentioning, however, that the Blood-eyed Qilin Clan had suffered even more casualties than the Totem Dragon Clansmen, and their deaths were much more gruesome. Their carcasses were completely dried up, emptied of their origin energies.

However, Chu Feng was only concerned about the Totem Dragon Clan. As furious as he was, he suppressed his anger and hid his aura to watch the situation.

Terrifying shockwaves could be seen rippling from the sky, leaving even Chu Feng hesitant to approach. There, he could sense the auras of Long Chengyu and the rank five Half-God level Blood-eyed Qilin Clansman.
