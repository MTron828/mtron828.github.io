Chapter 5757: Let’s Go And Eat

“Who do you think the victor will be, Lord Chu Feng?” the Asura King asked.

“It’s hard to say. Neither of them are exerting their true prowess. I can only say that they are equally matched at the moment,” Chu Feng replied.

“Indeed.” The Asura King agreed with Chu Feng’s judgment.

Tzlala!

Just then, Huangfu Shengyu’s Lightning Mark and Lightning Armor suddenly glowed brighter than before, and his Lightning Wings enlarged as well. More importantly, his fighting prowess had become significantly stronger than before.

“How did he suddenly become so powerful? Is it his bloodline power?” the Asura King asked.

“No, it’s a forbidden medicine created specifically for the Heavenly Bloodline. It’s probably hidden in his body, so that he can activate it whenever he needs to,” Chu Feng said.

“There’s such a forbidden medicine in the world?” The Asura King was taken aback.

The consumption of forbidden medicine was usually obvious due to the change in aura, but it was hard to sense it from Huangfu Shengyu’s aura.

With the aid of the forbidden medicine, Huangfu Shengyu claimed the upper hand and began suppressing Xianhai Shaoyu.

Xianhai Shaoyu sensed that something was amiss, so he looked at Huangfu Shengyu with a deep smile as he said, “We’re just playing around. There’s no need to get so serious.”

He then leaped off the dueling ring and said, “I admit defeat.”

“Xianhai Shaoyu admitted defeat? This… Huangfu Shengyu actually defeated Xianhai Shaoyu!” The crowd, who didn’t know what happened, only saw the outcome

They had known that Huangfu Shengyu was strong, but the result still came as a shock as Xianhai Shaoyu had never suffered a defeat before this. In other words, Huangfu Shengyu’s victory here carried great significance.

“At least you know your place,” Huangfu Shengyu said.

The shockwaves on the dueling ring faded, but he didn’t retract his power. His lightning-clad body looked imposing, reminiscent of an emperor.

“The lightning enveloping him is incredible! It’s much stronger than the other Huangfus.”

“Is this the Saint-tier Heavenly Bloodline? Even its appearance is different!”

Unaware of the truth, the crowd thought that Huangfu Shengyu’s lightning was only this powerful due to his bloodline. Men looked at him with respect, and women looked at him in admiration. Huangfu Shengyu had just claimed the title of the strongest junior by defeating Xianhai Shaoyu, so it was no wonder why the crowd saw him in a different light.

However, Huangfu Shaoyu scoffed in disdain and said, “Ignorant cultivators of the present era, do you finally understand what true strength is?”

“What does he mean?” The crowd was confused.

Seeing the confused expressions around him, Huangfu Shengyu said, “You still don’t get it? We’re different from the rest of you. Our Huangfu Heavenly Clan is from the Ancient Era.”

Those words shocked the crowd. They found it hard to believe that there was still an intact Heavenly Clan from the Ancient Era that could freely move around in the world of cultivation. Based on what they knew, most ancient existences had been restrained by some force.

Furthermore, they couldn’t sense the Ancient Era’s aura from them.

“Wait a moment, doesn’t that mean that they aren’t juniors? Did they sneak in using some kind of special means?” Long Chengyu asked.

“No, they are juniors like us, just that their clans were prominent not in the present era but the Ancient Era,” Chu Feng said.

“That explains why they don’t carry the Ancient Era’s aura,” Long Chengyu replied.

Chu Feng and Long Chengyu had spoken softly, so most people didn’t hear them and were still confused about the situation. They couldn’t make sense of how someone from the Ancient Era could enter the Nine Heavens’ Zenith.

“Look at your gazes. You’re frogs in the well. I don’t blame you since you haven’t seen how big the world is. We’re here to show you the reality of things and make you understand how weak you are.

“Do you honestly think you are the true overlords of the world of cultivation? How naive. You’ll be reduced to our slaves the moment we make a move. That’s the gap between the cultivators of the current era and the Ancient Era,” Huangfu Shengyu said with an arrogant attitude.

The respect and admiration that the crowd had previously shown him vanished without a trace, replaced with anger. Huangfu Shengyu’s words were simply too insulting. They were prodigies, but Huangfu Shengyu actually thought of them as slaves?

The crowd felt humiliated like someone had trampled on their dignity.Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

However, Huangfu Shengyu had no intention of reining himself in despite sensing an anomaly in the atmosphere.

“I heard that there’s a God’s Era or something that pins all hope on juniors like you, which is why your respective powers are devoting all their resources to nurturing you in hopes of clinching the initiative. Hahaha!”

Huangfu Shengyu suddenly burst into jarring and maniacal laughter. He laughed for a long while before slowly calming down. He turned to the crowd and said, “Sorry, I couldn’t hold myself back because of how hilarious it was. I really want to ask the weaklings of the present generation: given your measly strength, what does God’s Era have to do with you at all?”

The crowd gritted their teeth in anger upon hearing those words.

Huangfu Shengyu was not just insulting a specific someone but all of the cultivators in the present era. His attitude was arrogant as if others were beneath him. Yet, none of them could say a word since even Xianhai Shaoyu had fallen in defeat.

“Indignant? I’ll give you another chance to challenge me. Feel free to come up if you disagree with my words. I’m waiting for you up here. I’d like to see if any of you have the guts to protect your dignity.”

Huangfu Shengyu glanced at Little Fishy, as he sensed that she was the only one who could rival him other than Xianhai Shaoyu. The crowd also turned their eyes toward Little Fishy and Xianhai Shaoyu.

Little Fishy’s base cultivation was only at rank six Half-God level, but her earlier performance was incredible. Xianhai Shaoyu might have fallen in defeat, but he had lost via surrendering and didn’t sustain any injuries, so there was a chance he could turn the tables around.

The crowd didn’t think that there was anyone else who could defend the name of the cultivators of the present era here. Xianhai Shaoyu and Little Fishy were their only hope.

Xianhai Shaoyu considered returning to the dueling ring, but he suddenly heard a voice transmission.

“You didn’t exert your full strength earlier, which means you don’t intend to go all out here. Since that’s the case, you should just stick to that. There’s no need to reveal your true means here.” The voice transmission was from Chu Feng.

Shoosh!

A person leaped onto the dueling ring.

The crowd was taken aback, as that person was none other than Chu Feng.

“Chu Feng, what nonsense are you up to? He’s a rank seven Half-God level cultivator, not to mention he possesses the Saint-tier Heavenly Bloodline. You can’t deal with him!”

“Come down, Chu Feng. Don’t waste this opportunity we have to right our name.”

“Chu Feng, this isn’t the time for you to be messing around. Come down right now! You aren’t just embarrassing yourself but all cultivators of the present era!”

And those already were the better-sounding words. Some went even further than that, going to the extent of insulting Chu Feng. They couldn’t bear the thought of Chu Feng squandering this opportunity for them to right their name.

Even Long Chengyu, Xian Miaomiao, Long Muxi, and the others, who understood Chu Feng, were perplexed by his action. It was only normal for them to feel this way after witnessing Huangfu Shengyu’s overwhelming strength.

“Big brother.” Little Fishy looked at Xianhai Shaoyu. She was worried about Chu Feng.

“He’ll be fine,” Xianhai Shaoyu replied with a smile. He then turned to the crowd and bellowed, “Shut up! What rights do you have to criticize Chu Feng when none of you had the guts to step onto the dueling ring?”

“Xianhai Shaoyu, it’s not that we want to put down Chu Feng, but Huangfu Shengyu has already stated that he’s a cultivator from the Ancient Era. Whoever steps onto the stage to fight him will be representing us, cultivators from the present era, but Chu Feng clearly isn’t up for that role! He’s merely a rank three Half-God level cultivator. It’d be better if you go up instead!”

“Indeed, young master Xianhai. Why don’t you fight with Huangfu Shengyu again and uphold our reputation as the cultivators of the present era? Consider us begging you, all right?”

The crowd said.

However, Xianhai Shaoyu’s face turned even colder as he roared, “I told you to shut up!”

His voice wasn’t any louder than before, but the chilling edge in his tone compelled the crowd to go silent. They were afraid of what he would do if they continued running their mouths.

After reprimanding the crowd, Xianhai Shaoyu looked at Chu Feng with a smile and said, “Brother Chu Feng, I have faith in you.”

“Don’t worry,” Chu Feng replied with a smile.

He wasn’t fazed by the crowd’s earlier criticism. He had long gotten used to receiving such reactions from strangers.

“Do you really intend to challenge me?” Huangfu Shengyu asked.

“Do you have more forbidden medicine in you?” Chu Feng asked.

“What?” Huangfu Shengyu feigned ignorance.

“Use all of them,” Chu Feng said.

“What rubbish are you spouting?” Huangfu Shengyu frowned, refusing to admit that he had consumed forbidden medicine earlier.

“I’m telling you to use all of your forbidden medicine now, or else you won’t get a chance to do so later on,” Chu Feng said.

“What a joke. The likes of you don’t stand a chance against me. I’ll stand here and let you do as you please. If you can even hurt me at all, I’ll consider it your victory,” Huangfu Shengyu said.

“Heh…” Chu Feng chuckled.

His eyes suddenly turned cold, as he unleashed a surge of oppressive might. There was a loud explosion, shaking not just the dueling ring but the area outside it too.

The crowd quickly turned to the dueling ring, only to see Huangfu Shengyu, who stood loftily like an emperor earlier, lying on the ground in pain. They were shocked.

Even Xianhai Shaoyu, Long Chengyu, Long Muxi, Xian Miaomiao, Feng Ling, and the others were taken aback too.

Qin Xuan, Qin Shu, and the others, who demanded Chu Feng come down earlier, widened their eyes in horror.

Chu Feng was emanating the aura of a True God level cultivator!

No matter how powerful Huangfu Shengyu was, there was no way he, as a Half-God, could stand a chance against a True God. All it took was Chu Feng’s oppressive might to subdue him.

Chu Feng slowly took step by step toward Huangfu Shengyu. The latter clenched his jaws and tried to scramble to his feet, but it was to no avail.

“What’s going on? How can Chu Feng be a True God level cultivator? Did he conceal his cultivation?”

The crowd was confused.

“It’s a world spirit. Chu Feng has a True God level world spirit. He’s currently borrowing the strength of his world spirit,” Ling Xiao offered the answer to the question.

“A True God level world spirit? A True God level world spirit actually submitted to him?

“I-is this what Lord Jie Ranqing’s son is capable of? He’s able to subjugate a True God level world spirit despite being only at rank three Half-God level himself?”

The crowd looked at Chu Feng in a different light. They were starting to see how he managed to wreak havoc in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion back then. It turned out that they were really frogs in the well. How could they underestimate a person who got away scot-free after wreaking havoc in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion?

By then, Chu Feng had already reached Huangfu Shengyu’s side. With a wave of his hand, the pearl, which Huangfu Shengyu had dropped to the ground, flew into his grasp.

He looked at Huangfu Shengyu and scoffed, “You said you’re from an Ancient Era Heavenly Clan? Look at yourself. What does God’s Era have to do with you?”

Then, he leaped off the dueling ring and headed toward Little Fishy and the others.

“You’re awesome, big brother!”

“Brother Chu Feng, I didn’t know you had a True God level world spirit! You sure hid it well!”

Little Fishy, Long Chengyu, and the others surrounded Chu Feng with excited looks.

Chu Feng replied with a nonchalant shrug, “Let’s not talk about this. Come, let’s have dinner first.”
