Chapter 5225: You’ll Have To Die Too

“Why? You can’t bear watching me kill your wife? That isn’t good. How will you be able to take it when I kill your son then?” Chu Feng asked.

“Kill my son? Do you have the capability to do so?”

Yue Lian laughed upon hearing those words. While his protective formation wielded no offensive prowess, it was still a powerful barrier that automatically triggered whenever anyone threatened his son’s life.

“Yue Lian, your protective formation is indeed powerful, but I’ll breach it before your eyes today. Watch closely. The moment I breach the protective formation is the moment your son dies.”

Chu Feng began constructing a formation to dispel the protective formation Yue Lian had placed on his son. He had tried doing the same for the one Old Cat had placed on young master Wolf, but he failed due to the time restriction.

However, he was much more confident this time even though Yue Lian’s protective formation was more powerful.

“Someone of your caliber thinks that he can breach my formation?”

Yue Lian initially expressed his disdain toward Chu Feng’s remark, especially since he had spent a great deal of effort constructing it. Even a Gray Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist would struggle to breach it, let alone a rank nine Dragon Transformation Sensation world spiritist like Chu Feng. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Not to mention, he had infused the Yue Clan’s legacy into the protective formation, making it hard to breach it using normal means. This was no longer about the world spiritist’s spirit power but their world spirit techniques.

He didn’t think that there was any world spiritist in the world that could match the ingenuity of the Yue Clan’s legacy.

“This is?”

Yue Lian’s glee didn’t last for long.

He realized that Chu Feng had begun breaching the formation at an extremely fast speed, unraveling the protective formation he had painstakingly constructed over a long time.

On top of that, Chu Feng was doing it not through sheer force but his ingenious world spiritist techniques. His spirit power was nowhere close to a Gray Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist, but he was well-versed with the Yue Clan’s legacy.

It was like Yue Lian had meticulously crafted an exquisite lock to protect Yue Hui, only to discover that Chu Feng possessed the key to it.

It was truly ironic how Yue Lian’s confidence stemmed from him incorporating the Yue Clan’s legacy into the protective formation. Indeed, it would have posed a problem to other world spiritists, but to Chu Feng, it was nothing but a loophole for him to exploit.

Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been able to breach it at all.

“You… actually practiced our Yue Clan’s legacy? Yue Ling, you unfilial daughter! I’ll rip you into shreds!” Yue Lian howled in anger.

He could tell that Chu Feng’s mastery over the Yue Clan’s legacy far surpassed even his own, which was why Chu Feng had been able to easily breach his protective formation

“How meaningless. Why don’t you come down here and kill us right now?” Chu Feng mocked.

“Little bastard, I dare you to wait there for me!” Yue Lian shouted.

“You want me to wait here for you? You must think that I’m an idiot just like your son. Why would I foolishly wait for you to come here and kill me? I pray that you aren’t too far away right now, or else you can only watch helplessly as I end your son’s life.”

With one last burst of spirit power, the barrier around Yue Hui finally crumbled. Chu Feng had intentionally chose to breach just the barrier of the protective formation so that Yue Lian could witness his son’s death.

“Save me, father!” Yue Hui cried.

.

His arrogance had already faded away from the moment he saw Chu Feng murder his mother. By now, he had already known that it was unlikely for him to survive this ordeal.

“Don’t! Don’t hurt my son! Let’s talk things out!”

Yue Lian also finally dropped his haughty attitude with Chu Feng.

“There isn’t a huge grudge between us in the first place. There really isn’t any need for us to go this far. I am a guest elder of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect. You don’t want to get on the bad side of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect too, right? Please spare my son. I’m willing to compensate you if he has offended you in any way. Feel free to tell me what you want. I’ll do everything I can to meet your demands.”

Yue Lian put down his dignity and yielded to Chu Feng. Despite knowing that it was unlikely to work, he was willing to lower his head for the sliver of chance that his son might just be spared.

“Compensate? You might be able to compensate me, but what about Yue Ling? Yue Ling is my friend, and anyone who hurts her is my enemy too. Your wife and your son are just the opening act. You’re next on the list. I don’t care whether you’re a guest elder of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect or not. If the Pill Dao Immortal Sect tries to protect you, I’ll bring them down as well.”

With a flick of his wrist, Chu Feng’s sword swung across the air and lopped off Yue Hui’s head. Just like that, Yue Hui was dead.

“You beast! I’ll massacre your clan!”

Yue Lian roared with incomparable rage at the sight of his son’s death. His intense murderous aura could be felt even through the projection.

However, Chu Feng wasn’t afraid in the least.

“Massacre my clan? Try it then. Just know that I’ll be coming after you next.

“One more thing. Do you know why I was able to breach your protective formation that easily? It’d have usually taken me a much longer time to breach such protective formations, but you arrogantly incorporated your ancestor’s legacy into it. You must have thought that you were smart for doing that. Little did you know that I have already mastered your ancestor’s legacy. What would have usually taken me a long time ended up taking me only a few minutes.

“In other words, your son died because of your own foolishness!” Chu Feng said.

Yue Lian’s complexion turned livid. He could tell as much even without Chu Feng saying a word. He directed a murderous glare at Yue Ling and spat, “Just you wait, Yue Ling. I’ll kill you in cold blood.”

“Were you the one who caused my mother’s death?” Yue Ling suddenly asked.

“That’s right, I was the one who caused your mother’s death. I regret not having killed her myself. I should have ended your life back then too,” Yue Lian said through gritted teeth.

“I also regret being born as your daughter,” Yue Ling replied.

“Heh…”

Yue Lian sneered before turning to Chu Feng.

“Mark my words. You’ll pay the price for what you did. I’ll let you know who you have offended today!”

With those words, Yue Lian’s projection vanished. He had dispelled the protective formation.

Without a doubt, Yue Lian would do everything he could to get his revenge, but Chu Feng wasn’t worried in the least. In the first place, he didn’t know anything about Chu Feng. Chu Feng could go into hiding with Yue Ling, and he wouldn’t be able to do a thing about it at all.

Of course, Yue Lian could try going after Old Cat and Taowu, but it would be in vain.

Old Cat was a cunning rascal who could maneuver his way out of even the trickiest situations.

Taowu was a world spirit from the Ancient Era. Even if Yue Lian somehow managed to find Taowu, a single snort from the latter would be more than enough to erase him from the face of the world.
