Chapter 5059: God’s Era Has Already Begun

Jiang Kongping had the shock of his life, but he continued observing the colossal apparition intently, hoping to find something out from it. His tightly knitted eyebrows showed that he could hardly discern anything at all, but even so, he didn’t give up on it.

It was only till the energy in the Heavenview Divine Rock dissipated along with the image before him that he finally turned his attention back to Jiang Yuantai.

“Big brother, this is too shocking. What is that?”

Jiang Kongping’s face was a little pale from the earlier shock, but his voice showcased his excitement too. He knew that Jiang Yuantai wasn’t lying to him. Something huge had indeed happened in the vast world of cultivation.

It filled him with unprecedented excitement.

“Kongping, do you really not know what that signifies?”

Jiang Yuantai looked at Jiang Kongping with a disapproving frown. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“H-how could I possibly know?”

Jiang Kongping’s body stiffened up. He tried his best to think about it, but he was unable to figure anything out.

“That’s the result of playing around too much. How could you forget about that?” Jiang Yuantai said with a deep sigh.

“Big brother, what’s that thing? Stop beating around the bush and tell me!” Jiang Kongping urged.

“Around thirty thousand years ago, a stone tablet was discovered in an ancient remnant in the Seven Realms Galaxy that dated all the way back to the Immemorial Era. The stone tablet was blank, but everyone could sense boundless power pulsating from it.

“The only problem is that the stone tablet couldn’t be moved. So, the experts in the vast world of cultivation gathered around the stone tablet, hoping to put their strength together to decipher the stone tablet.”

Before Jiang Yuantai could finish his story, Jiang Kongping had already smacked his head in realization.

“Big brother, I remember that! Father told me about that once. The stone tablet is actually not a treasure but a prophetic medium from the Immemorial Era. Words from the Immemorial Era started appearing on the stone tablet later on,” Jiang Kongping excitedly interjected.

“Yes, I’m referring to that prophecy.”

Jiang Yuantai revealed a heartened smile when he saw Jiang Kongping recalling the matter, though it didn’t last for long.

“Wait a moment, big brother. What was written on the stone tablet?” Jiang Kongping asked.

“Didn’t our father tell you?” Jiang Yuantai asked in bewilderment.

“I… I forgot.”

“You…”

Jiang Yuantai suddenly felt a strong urge to give his younger brother a tight slap so that he could wake up to his idea.

“Big brother, I was wrong. It sounded so nonsensical to me that I didn’t bother remembering it back then. Please tell me what’s written on the stone tablet,” Jiang Kongping pleaded.

Jiang Yuantai shot a sharp glare at Jiang Kongping before continuing with the story.

“Four sentences of words written in the Immemorial Era appeared on the prophetic stone tablet. Upon deciphering the words, this was what they meant:

“Countless heroes there are treading the path of cultivation, but few are able to leave their name under the relentless flow of time. Should a day come where a colossal avatar appears amidst countless stars, a prodigy shall rise to godhood within a century.”

After reciting the prophecy, Jiang Yuantai turned to look at Jiang Kongping with a gleam in his eyes. However, the latter frowned contemplatively for a moment before asking, “Big brother, what does that mean?”

“You can’t even understand something as simple as that? Use your brain!” Jiang Yuantai bellowed.

“Big brother, you also know that I’m still decent at cultivation, but I’m bad with anything that requires the use of my brain,” Jiang Kongping replied indignantly.

“You sure are a load of trouble! The prophecy is saying that there have been countless experts in the way of cultivation thus far, but none of them have been able to survive the testament of time. If a day comes where heaven reveals a prophetic symbol, a huge ripple of change will come upon the world of cultivation. Countless prodigies will rise through the ranks, and of them, one will rise to the top and become the strongest existence ever within a century.

“It might just be a short century, but it’ll change the history of our world forever. Some call it God’s Era.” Jiang Yuantai said.

“Big brother, you’re saying that the colossal apparition is the prophetic symbol?” Jiang Kongping asked.

“Yes, the appearance of the colossal avatar heralds the beginning of God’s Era. Kongping, this is also the reason why I came here to look for you. You possess exceptional talent. If you work hard in your cultivation, there’s a chance that you might become the supreme existence,” Jiang Yuantai said.

“Big brother, if we look at the time of appearance of the colossal avatar, there’s no way the prophesied prodigy is me,” Jiang Kongping replied.

“You don’t understand. The prophecy only says that countless prodigies will appear upon the inception of God’s Era, but it didn’t state that only those who are born after God’s Era will be able to become the supreme existence. In fact, it wasn’t stated anywhere that this opportunity is only limited to juniors. Even those of the older generation could possibly be that prodigy.

“What I mean is that everyone stands a chance at becoming that supreme existence within the next hundred years.

“However, it’s common knowledge that the juniors of our generation possess exceptional talent. None of the juniors from the other generations come close to matching us. There have been guesses that our generation will usher in God’s Era, and the appearance of the colossal avatar verifies that. It’s very likely that someone of our generation will eventually become the supreme existence.

“That’s why, Kongping, I don’t want you to miss this opportunity.”

Jiang Yuantai patted at Jiang Kongping’s shoulder and looked at him with eyes filled with expectations.

“Big brother, let’s not talk about the older generation and the generation after us for now. Even within our generation, there are plenty of people who are more powerful than me. I don’t think that I’ll stand a chance even if I were to work hard. If someone in our generation will become a supreme existence, I think that person is most likely to be Xianhai Shaoyu,” Jiang Kongping said.

There was a complicated look in Jiang Kongping’s eyes when he heard that name. There was no one from the Totem Galaxy who didn’t know of Xianhai Shaoyu.

That young master of the Immortal Sea Fish Clan was known to be one of the most talented prodigies in the current world of cultivation, especially in the Totem Galaxy.

In fact, there was a saying that in this era of prodigies, it was possible to classify all cultivators into two categories: Xianhai Shaoyu and everyone else!
