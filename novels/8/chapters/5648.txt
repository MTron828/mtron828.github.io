Chapter 5648: Alliance With Fu Xing

It was a woman with a curvaceous face but a voluptuous figure. Chu Feng had once met her at the Painter Mountain.

She had been recruited by the Pill Dao Immortal Sect to kill Chu Feng, just that she was no match for him and had to escape through a formation. She had a mysterious background, and her means were formidable too.

But what left the greatest impression on Chu Feng was her sword, which had the power to significantly raise one’s spirit power. It was an invaluable treasure that Chu Feng lusted over.

The woman had been at Golden Dragon God-cloak back then, but the spirit power she was currently emanating was that of a Royal Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist. It hadn’t been long since they parted at the Painter Mountain, but she had made a huge progress since then. This showed just how talented she was.

“I’m guessing you were the champion of the earlier trial? I would have never known that it would be a familiar face,” Chu Feng said.

“You’re too high profile. You weren’t as smart as you were back at the Painter Mountain,” the woman said. She was mocking Chu Feng for carelessly getting trapped in her formation.

“Did you prepare this formation specifically for me? How vindictive,” Chu Feng remarked.

He had crossed blows with the woman back at the Painter Mountain. In the end, he managed to bind her with a formation he prepared beforehand.

This time around, the tables were turned on him, andS the woman had prepared a formation beforehand to deal with him. It was an eye for an eye. Furthermore, the spirit power flowing in the formation was comparable to that of an Immortal Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist, though its true prowess was probably a little weaker than what it appeared.

Nevertheless, it was a formidable feat that a Royal Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist had constructed an Immortal Dragon God-cloak level formation.

Chu Feng figured that the woman had probably used a treasure as the formation’s foundation, and she probably spent quite some time constructing it.

“Don’t worry, I don’t intend to kill you. Just tell me who your master is,” the woman asked.

“You really are curious about that.” Chu Fen couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

Initially, the woman didn’t think too much about Chu Feng and wanted to simply kill him, but she quickly realized that he wasn’t as simple as he seemed after crossing blows. From them on, she kept asking him who his master was. She was extremely curious about his background.

It was just that Chu Feng kept withholding the information from her.

“Chu Feng, you should be able to sense how powerful my formation is. I constructed it using a treasure as a formation. You should obediently heed my orders now that you’re trapped in my formation, or else I’ll torture you through the formation,” the woman said.

“I can tell you who my master is, but why don’t you tell me your origin first?” Chu Feng asked.

“You are a stubborn one!”

The woman formed a series of hand seals that induced the formation’s lightning to crackle, ready to strike Chu Feng at her call. Any Golden Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist would have been instantaneously reduced to ashes if struck by the lightning.

Yet, Chu Feng remained fearless. “I have nothing but my thick skin. Torture me all you want. I won’t speak as long as you don’t reveal your background.”

“You… Hmph!” The woman harrumphed helplessly before waving her sleeves. “So be it. It’s not as if I really wanted to know anyway. I’ll take the Saint-tier treasure for myself then. You can wait here.”

The woman began making her way deeper into the desert after saying those words. She didn’t really intend to harm Chu Feng.

Tzlala!

Lightning suddenly flashed across her eyes. Chu Feng had flitted in front of her like a specter. By the time the woman saw him, his Exalted Armament was already pressed against her neck. The Lightning Mark crackled on his forehead, the Lightning Armor enveloped his body, and the Lightning Wings sprouted from his back.

His cultivation had risen to rank six Half-God level.

However, the woman narrowed her eyes, knowing that a rank six Half-God level cultivator couldn’t have breached her formation. Even if its prowess was a little inflated, its prowess was still comparable to that of an Immortal Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist.

As hard as it was for her to believe it, Chu Feng’s current fighting prowess was on par with rank seven Half-God level cultivators.

The woman chuckled softly and remarked, “I’ve underestimated you.”

“Don’t worry. I’ll spare you after asking a question,” Chu Feng said.

“Kill me if you want to. Don’t bother trying to gather any intelligence from me,” the woman said before closing her eyes.

“I just wanted to ask your name. Do you have to go that far to protect your name?” Chu Feng asked.

“Why are you asking that?” The woman opened her eyes and looked at Chu Feng in confusion.

“You know my name, but I don’t know yours. That’s unfair,” Chu Feng replied.

The woman was momentarily taken aback by his reply before replying, “I am Fu Xing.”

“Fu Xing? Which ‘Fu’ and which ‘Xing’?” Chu Feng asked.

“Fu, as in resurgence, and Xing, as in the stars,” the woman replied.

“I see. I thought that you were planning to resurge something,” Chu Feng said with a chuckle.

He stowed away his Exalted Armament, and his cultivation reverted to rank three Half-God level. He opened up his palm and passed a pearl containing the power of an Immortal Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist to her.

This pearl was the treasure she had used as her formation’s foundation. Chu Feng had obtained the treasure while breaching it. It still could be used even though its energy was greatly depleted from the activation of the formation.

However, Chu Feng didn’t claim the item for his own but instead passed it to the woman, saying, “I’ll return this to you.”

“What do you mean by this?” the woman asked.Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“I said that I’d let you go if you told me your name. It’s only right for me to return your treasure too,” Chu Feng replied.

“But I’m your rival. I attempted to take your life once, and I even trapped you earlier,” the woman said.

“I also tried to kill you previously. You did trap me earlier, but you didn’t attempt to take my life. This shows that you don’t harbor any killing intent toward me anymore. The reason you wanted to kill me back then was due to the benefits you received from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect, but there’s no deep grudge between us. There’s no need for us to be so hostile toward each other. Besides, this remnant is a dangerous place. Our best bet for leaving this place alive is to work together with each other,” Chu Feng said.

The woman looked at the pearl in Chu Feng’s hand contemplatively before abruptly snatching it over with a wave of her sleeves. “Fine. I’ll work together with you to resolve any dangers that we encounter later on, but I should let you know that my goal is the Saint-tier treasure. I won’t make a move on you, but I have no intention of holding back either.”

“Don’t worry, I am of the same thought too. I am after the Saint-tier treasure as well. I don’t plan on holding back against you,” Chu Feng said.
