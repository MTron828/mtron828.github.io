Chapter 5868: Jie Tianran’s Strength

While Chu Feng was observing Jie Tianran, Wen Xue was observing Chu Feng. She quickly figured out who Jie Tianran was.

“Ooh, I see him! That old man is your maternal grandfather? The spirit power shrouding our entire galaxy is his means too, right? With how strong and despicable he is, he won’t be an easy opponent to deal with. Junior Chu Feng, you’ll have a tough time after offending such a person,” Wen Xue stroked her lower jaw as she analyzed the situation.

Chu Feng ignored Wen Xue, but his eyes alternated between Jie Tianran and the Ancestral Martial Ream Sect. What he was worried about right now wasn’t Jie Tianran himself but him claiming the initiative in claiming the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s treasure.

“Junior Chu Feng, did you fight your maternal grandfather to a draw with the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s formation? It would have to be a powerful formation for you to rival an expert of his caliber. You must have suffered a lot channeling such a formation,” Wen Xue remarked.

“Junior Wen Xue, please don’t disturb my big brother Chu Feng,” Zi Ling said.

The Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster also said, “Wen Xue, be quiet.”

“Master, I’m just helping Junior Chu Feng analyze the situation out of worry,” Wen Xue said.

The sectmaster directed a stern glare at her. Wen Xue shrugged before shutting her mouth.

...

After issuing the Seven Realms Edict, Jie Tianran turned to his clansmen and ordered, “Wait here first. No one is allowed to approach the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s main city without my permission.”

After saying those words, he began making his way toward the main city by himself.

Chu Feng hurriedly turned his gaze toward the main city, knowing that Jie Tianran was going to try to enter the main city. “Lord Sectmaster, can you focus the image projection on the gates of the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s main city?”

“Of course.” The sectmaster channeled the formation to take a closer look at the main city.

“This isn’t working. I can’t tell what’s going on solely through this observation formation. Lord Sectmaster, can you activate the teleportation formation and send me over?” Chu Feng asked.

There had to be clues on the gate as to how the protective formation could be breached, but he couldn’t see through it via the observation formation. He would have to look at it in person.

“I can do that, but you can’t stay for too long. You only have two hours. Whether it works or not, you have to return by then,” the sectmaster said.

“Understood.” Chu Feng nodded.

The sectmaster brought Chu Feng and the others out of the formation realm and toward another door, which contained another formidable formation. This formation could transport one to anywhere within the Ancestral Martial Galaxy within a short time.

“Big brother Chu Feng, won’t it be dangerous?” Zi Ling worriedly asked.

Any elder on the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s floating warships could easily subdue all of them, let alone Jie Tianran. Chu Feng wouldn’t stand a chance if he was caught by them.

“Don’t worry, Zi Ling,” Chu Feng said.

The Divine Deer had recovered, which meant that he had a way to escape. He had already communicated with the Divine Deer on the matter, and the latter had confirmed that it could circumvent the means of a Heavenly Dragon World Spiritist.

Chu Feng didn’t doubt the Divine Deer’s words, having previously witnessed what it was capable of.

The sectmaster passed a talisman paper and a jade bottle to Chu Feng.

“Thank you, Lord Sectmaster,” Chu Feng said.

It turned out that the sectmaster also had her means to ensure his safety. Using the talisman paper and the medicine inside the jade bottle together would grant him a strong concealment effect.

“This is no ordinary concealment formation. It’s linked to our Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s formations. You’ll be able to communicate with me while the formation is active. If you do meet with danger, inform me right away, and I’ll activate the formation and transport you back. However, you have to make sure that you don’t stay for more than two hours,” the sectmaster said.

“I understand. Thank you, Lord Sectmaster.”

Chu Feng first consumed the medicine inside the jade bottle before channeling the talisman paper, which resulted in his complete concealment. Then, he stepped into the teleportation formation.

He was quickly transported to a location that was some distance away from the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s main city and the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s army.

“Chu Feng, you’re up against the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, after all. No matter how powerful our founder’s formation is, you still have to exercise prudence, and if possible, keep your distance from Jie Tianran,” the sectmaster told Chu Feng via the formation.

“Rest assured, Lord Sectmaster. The Ancestral Martial Realm City’s main city is massive. It’ll suffice for me to examine the gates from here,” Chu Feng replied.

The Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s main city was as big as a realm, after all.

Thus, he stood on the spot and examined the gates’ content. Through his Heaven’s Eyes, the runes on the gates began dancing as if they had a life of their own. There were so many runes that it felt like he was looking at countless schools of fishes. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

To figure out the way to open the gates, he needed to find specific fishes and put them in the correct order.

There was also another more dangerous way to go about it, and that was to break through the gate via brute force. However, that would result in a backlash from the city’s formation.

“This is too tough. Why did they leave behind such a difficult formation?” Chu Feng frowned.

He felt goosebumps just looking at the runes. This puzzle was nigh impossible to solve due to its sheer complexity.

Jie Tianran frowned as well. It looked like he was stumped too.

However, he soon reached into his Cosmos Sack and took out an old copper mirror that appeared to be from the Immemorial Era. He formed a hand seal, and the copper mirror swiftly enlarged and unleashed a beam of light on the city gates.

“Jie Tianran has a treasure of such caliber?” Chu Feng was delighted.

The copper mirror’s light greatly lowered the difficulty of the puzzle, bringing him a ray of hope. If what he previously had to do was to find a fish in the vast ocean, the copper mirror reduced the search area to a tenth of what it was before.

It was still a difficult task, but it was at least plausible now.

Chu Feng quickly focused his attention, knowing that this opportunity was transient.

What Chu Feng didn’t know was that someone was also observing Jie Tianran, and that person was Song Changsheng.

“Why would he have that?” Song Changsheng recognized the copper mirror, and through that, he realized that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist didn’t lie to him.

Jie Tianran was indeed concealing his true ability.
