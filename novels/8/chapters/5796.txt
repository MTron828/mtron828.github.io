Chapter 5796: The Infuriated Jie Tianran

Instead of answering the question, the Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s Clan Chief stared intently at Chu Feng before suddenly remarking, “It’ll end soon.”

Little Fishy’s mother turned to look at Chu Feng.

In spite of the taunting from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, Chu Feng’s bloodline didn’t go completely berserk. On the contrary, the lightning covering the sky began to dissipate.

Chu Feng had suppressed his berserk bloodline.

“He managed to put his berserk bloodline under control?”

The crowd was baffled.

“Could it be another means of his instead of his bloodline going berserk?”

The crowd was previously convinced that Chu Feng’s bloodline had gone berserk, but they weren’t certain now. It was stated in the records that those whose bloodline had gone berserk would lose all rationality and self-control. The fact that Chu Feng could retract this power made them think that his bloodline hadn’t actually gone berserk.

The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master’s face turned livid upon seeing Chu Feng successfully suppressing his berserk bloodline.

By this point, Chu Feng had already regained his composure. He looked at the formation protecting him and saw that it was cracked. He then turned to the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master and saw disappointment, anger, and indignation in his eyes.

He belatedly realized that he nearly fell into crisis.

The formation protecting him would have been destroyed if his bloodline continued to run amok, forcing him to confront those from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion face-on. While he would enjoy a huge power boost from his berserk bloodline, he might lose consciousness. That would mean leaving everything to fate.

It was uncertain whether you could triumph over the wily old fox Jie Tianran under such circumstances.

“Chu Feng, are you getting scared? You’re a coward, after all!” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s elders taunted Chu Feng.

Now that he had regained his composure, Chu Feng thought that their actions were ludicrous, but he couldn’t bring himself to laugh. His anger continued to seethe, as their words concerned his mother.

“I’ll visit the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion once more. I’ll make sure to destroy every single one of you.” Chu Feng coldly eyed the elders.

All voices halted. From Chu Feng’s eyes, the crowd felt tremendous killing intent, as if a death god had locked his eyes on them. It was at this moment their fates were sealed.

Chu Feng made sure to remember every single one of their faces.

He didn’t know who was the one who sent him a voice transmission earlier to snap him out of his trance, but he didn’t think he could fully trust the other party either. There was a chance that his mother already had her bloodline taken away. Should that be true, all of the people here would have hell to pay for.

After finishing his piece, he returned to the ancient hall via the spirit formation gate.

Shortly after he left, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master turned around and returned to his mobile palace. With a wave of his sleeves, he constructed a sealing formation and sealed off the entire palace.

“Lord Mansion Master, are you all right?”

The elders had wanted to follow the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master into the palace, as they would have usually held a discussion to decide how to deal with this situation, but the latter had isolated himself with a barrier.

That made them worry about the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master.

“What problem could I possibly have?” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master replied in displeasure.

“We deserve death. We were heedless in our words,” the elders replied.

Unbeknownst to them, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master had sat down on the ground and was taking off his robes. A brilliant light was emanating from countless glowing runes on his body, and it was becoming increasingly brighter with time.

The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master worriedly inspected his body.

He first popped a couple of pills before forming hand seals. He invoked a formation that had been planted inside him for a long time now, drawing out a powerful surge of sealing energy. Through the suppression of this sealing energy, the glowing runes receded beneath his skin.

However, his muscles soon began to distort as if he was unable to suppress his power anymore. This made him panic, as he sensed that there was a risk he might implode if he continued suppressing his power.

Nevertheless, he didn’t want to give up on it. He consumed a few extremely high-tier pills and even crushed an invaluable talisman to augment the sealing energy within him.

As valuable as the talisman was, deep down, he knew that it was unable to help him much in his current state. It was truly an act of sheer desperation in hopes that a miracle might happen.

Uwa!

Blood suddenly spurted out of his mouth with incredible force, dyeing the ground red. Cracks appeared on his skin, and blood furiously spewed out from those cracks. In a matter of seconds, he was already completely covered in blood.

The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master immediately dispelled his formation, and the sealing energy dissipated.

The golden runes began reappearing all over his body, and his aura grew stronger. Anyone would have been delighted to obtain such power, but his face was filled with anger and resentment.

“Chu Feng!!!!”

He clenched his fists tightly, and his muscles swelled. His anger was palpable.

He had been suppressing this power for tens of thousands of years to turn the tables on his enemies in a critical situation. However, as Chu Feng flaunted his talent before him again and again, his hatred intensified to a level that he wanted nothing more than to exploit the earlier opportunity to obliterate Chu Feng.

For that, he even lifted his seal.

That was why he stood fearlessly in the face of Chu Feng’s terrifying aura. He was confident of suppressing and killing Chu Feng, even when the latter’s bloodline had gone berserk.

Yet, when he lifted his seal, Chu Feng suddenly regained his composure and suppressed his berserk bloodline. It was not to say that this tremendous power he had accumulated would be wasted, but he wouldn’t be able to exploit the full value of it anymore. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

His plan had been thrown into disarray. How could he not be infuriated?

…

Meanwhile, Chu Feng had returned to the ancient hall.

Those in the ancient hall saw him, but not a person said a word. They dared not to since they knew that he had to be in a terrible mood.

Just then, Chu Feng turned to Ling Xiao and Jie Baobao and asked, “Are you aware of what happened to my mother?”

“I’ll be honest with you, Chu Feng. I heard such a rumor before,” Ling Xiao said.

Xianhai Shaoyu, Little Fishy, and the others revealed worried looks. It didn’t bode well that Ling Xiao, one of the strongest juniors of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, was saying this.

However, Ling Xiao quickly added, “But Lord Mansion Master dotes on Lord Jie Ranqing a lot. Personally, I don’t think he’d resort to something like that. I suspect he only said those words to agitate you.”

“Chu Feng, I also don’t think Lord Mansion Master would do that to Lord Jie Ranqing,” Jie Baobao agreed.

“Mm.” Chu Feng nodded.

Just then, a hand meekly reached over and grabbed the corner of his sleeve. It was Little Fishy.

“Big brother, are you fine?” Little Fishy looked at Chu Feng with eyes glistening with worry.

Xian Miaomiao was also looking at him with concerned eyes. This made him feel ashamed.

“My apologies, I worried you all,” Chu Feng said.

“What are you saying? You have nothing to apologize for! Jie Tianran, that old thing, went too far! How could he utter such nonsense to agitate you? He’s a terrible person! Fortunately, you didn’t fall for his trick,” Feng Ling said.

She didn’t hesitate to insult the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master even though Ling Xiao and Jie Baobao were in the vicinity. Those two didn’t say a word about it, as they also thought that their Mansion Master and elders had gone too far.
