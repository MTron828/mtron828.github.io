Chapter 3341 - Drawing The Evil God Sword In Anger

“Lord Hanpeng.”

At that moment, Chu Xuanzhengfa turned his eyes to Chu Hanpeng.

He knew that Chu Hanpeng was the only one capable of helping him at that moment.

“This matter is indeed very dubious,” Chu Hanpeng said.

“What’s dubious about it?” Chu Hanqing asked.

“The fact that Chu Feng poisoned Lord Clan Chief and did so right before us is the dubious point. No matter how foolish one might be, one would not do that sort of thing. It would be impossible for Chu Feng to do this sort of thing, for there is no reason for him to do it,” Chu Xuanzhengfa said.

“Dubious? The way I see it, Chu Feng did that deliberately.”

“He deliberately poisoned Lord Clan Chief before us, escaped and then deliberately hid himself within his residence to pretend that nothing had happened. He did all that so that we would think that someone disguised themselves as him to do the poisoning, and make us think that he is unrelated to this matter, that he is also a victim.”

“However, he has underestimated us. Let me ask, who could possibly disguise themselves as him and not be detected by Lord Clan Chief?”

“There is only one possible answer to that. That is, all of this was deliberately done by Chu Feng,” Chu Hanqing said.

“What Chu Hanqing said is very correct. Lord Hanpeng, that Chu Feng is an ingrate. Someone like him must be executed,” Chu Hanyouyou added. After she said those words, she actually half-kneeled before Chu Hanpeng.

“Lord Hanpeng, that child harbors unfathomable motives. Lord Clan Chief had treated him like his own grandson. Yet, he dared to poison him. His crime cannot be forgiven. He must be executed so as to avenge Lord Clan Chief,” Chu Hanqing added. Then, he also half-kneeled on the ground.

“Lord Supreme Elder, that child cannot be left alive!”

Following that, the accomplices of Chu Hanqing and Chu Hanyouyou also uniformly half-knelt on the ground, demanding the execution of Chu Feng.

“Chu Feng, why did you poison Lord Clan Chief?” Chu Hanpeng looked to Chu Feng and asked with a stern voice.

“Humph,” Chu Feng coldly snorted, “Those that believe my innocence need not question me. Those that don’t believe my innocence, no matter how much they question, it will all be useless. Do whatever you want.”

“However, if you all want to kill me today, I, Chu Feng, will definitely not allow myself to be killed without fighting back.”

After Chu Feng finished saying those words, he flipped his palm and, with a flash of crimson light, the Evil God Sword appeared in his hand.

At that moment, Chu Feng was filled with anger. He could not be certain who it was that had framed him. However, regardless of who it might be, he could not tolerate such a thing.

If the Chu Heavenly Clansmen were determined to attack him, he would not mind having them experience the power of the Evil God Sword.

After all, there would still be a chance to live should he resist. Otherwise... he would likely die by the hands of those vile characters.

“That must be the Demon Armament you obtained from the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm, right?” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“What utter ridiculousness. While you have managed to move about unhindered with that Demon Armament in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, that Demon Armament, like you, is akin to trash with a vicious external shell before us,” Chu Hanqing pointed at Chu Feng.

He naturally knew about the Evil God Sword in Chu Feng’s hand. Unfortunately, it seemed that he did not know about its true powers.

In fact, it was not only Chu Hanqing. Even Chu Feng himself did not know exactly how powerful the Evil God Sword truly was.

“So that’s it. You all have truly considered me, Chu Feng, to be a pushover. That’s why you all dared to act so aggressively.”

“Since that’s the case, I will have you all realize exactly what sort of person I, Chu Feng, am.”

After Chu Feng finished saying those words, he planned to assimilate his power with the Evil God Sword.

“Paaa~~~”

However, before Chu Feng could attack, a hand grabbed his wrist, sealing his martial power.

It was Chu Xuanzhengfa.

Chu Xuanzhengfa had stopped Chu Feng. After a glance at Chu Feng, he cast his gaze to Chu Hanqing, Chu Hanyouyou and the others.

With a serious voice, he said, “Chu Feng has the Death Exemption Title Plate. Lord Clan Chief had stated that regardless of what sort of crime he might commit, no one is allowed to cause him any harm. Lord Clan Chief even repeated those words just earlier.”

“If you all plan to attack Chu Feng, you will be disobeying Lord Clan Chief’s order.”

“I, Chu Xuanzhengfa, as the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Law Enforcement Hall’s Vice Hall Master, will definitely not allow this sort of thing to happen. If anyone dares to attack Chu Feng, I will kill that person in accordance with our laws!!!”

“Clank~~~”

After Chu Xuanzhengfa finished saying those words, he pulled out the weapon on his waist and pointed it towards Chu Hanqing and the others.

“Clank, clank, clank, clank~~~”

Following that, all the members of the Law Enforcement Hall present landed beside Chu Xuanzhengfa and Chu Feng. They too drew their weapons and aimed them at Chu Hanqing and the others.

“Humph, I knew that you were an accomplice of that Chu Feng. Today... this old man shall eliminate all the scourges of the clan!”

As Chu Hanqing spoke, he released his oppressive might.

As for Chu Hanyouyou and their accomplices, they too unleashed their oppressive might. They planned to attack Chu Xuanzhengfa.

“Stop!!!”

However, right at that moment, a furious shout was heard. At the same time, a very powerful oppressive might was sent forth.

Not only did that oppressive might seal the entire region, but it also sealed the movements of everyone present.

The owner of that powerful oppressive might was Chu Hanpeng.

“What are you all doing?! Lord Clan Chief is currently poisoned, it is even hard to determine if he can live! Yet you all are planning to have internal strife?!” Chu Hanpeng shouted loudly.

“Lord Hanpeng, that Chu Feng has poisoned Lord Clan Chief. He absolutely cannot be allowed to escape,” Chu Hanqing and the others said.

“Lord Hanpeng, not only are there countless dubious aspects to this matter, but Chu Feng also possesses the Death Exemption Title Plate. Furthermore, before Lord Clan Chief fell unconscious, he personally ordered that we are not to attack Chu Feng. How could we go against Lord Clan Chief’s orders?” Chu Xuanzhengfa said to Chu Hanpeng.

At that moment, the two sides were arguing nonstop.

“All of you, shut up!” Suddenly, Chu Hanpeng shouted again.

Then, he said, “Indeed, what happened today is very dubious. We must investigate this matter properly.”

“However, we have all witnessed Chu Feng poisoning Lord Clan Chief. Even if he possesses the Death Exemption Title Plate, even if he can escape capital punishment, he must still be punished.”

“Men! Arrest Chu Feng and bring him to the Heavenly Lightning Punishment Platform. Unless he is to tell the truth himself, or we finish investigating this matter, he’s not allowed to be released.”

“This...” Hearing those words, Chu Xuanzhengfa’s expression changed greatly. He became extremely worried.

As for Chu Hanqing, Chu Hanyouyou and the others, they revealed joyous looks on their faces.

The Heavenly Lightning Punishment Platform was constructed by their Chu Heavenly Clan’s Old Ancestor. Being there, one would have one’s soul and bloodline bombarded by lightning from the ninth heaven. It was an extremely cruel punishment.

In the history of the Chu Heavenly Clan, there had never been a person who was able to endure the punishment of the Heavenly Lightning Punishment Platform for over a day.

In fact, for many people, they ended up dying after being struck by the first lightning bolt.

The way they saw it, even if Chu Feng could escape death immediately, being sent to the Heavenly Lightning Punishment Platform was akin to a death sentence.
