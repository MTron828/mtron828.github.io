Chapter 3918 - The Power Of The Formation Core

“Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~”

In the short moment when Yin Zhuanghong was stunned, countless sickles flew out from within the formation core, coming straight for her.

“Crap!”

As Yin Zhuanghong was momentarily stunned and the sickles were extremely fast, by the time she reacted to them, it was already too late for her to dodge.

“Woosh~~~”

However, at the moment when Yin Zhuanghong believed that she would be killed, a figure suddenly landed before her.

“Bang~~~”

Before Yin Zhuanghong could even see who that person was, she was pushed away by an enormous power.

It was that person who had landed before her. That person was the one who had pushed her away.

After being pushed away, Yin Zhaunghong was finally able to see who that person was.

It was Chu Feng. Chu Feng was the one that had landed before her. He was the one that had pushed her away.

However, by the time she realized it was Chu Feng, the sickles that flew out from the formation core had all landed on him.

“Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~”

Blood splattered everywhere. Chu Feng’s body was covered in wounds.

Even though he had taken the initiative to use his spirit power to form layers of armor to protect himself beforehand, before those powerful sickles, the multiple layers of spirit formation armor he had covered himself with were simply akin to paper, and unable to withstand a single blow.

“Chu Feng!!!”

After the sickles returned to the formation core, Yin Zhuanghong immediately used her martial power to pull Chu Feng to her side.

At that moment, Chu Feng was completely covered in wounds and blood. Even his aura became extremely weak.

“I’m sorry. It’s all my fault, all my fault.”

Seeing the dying Chu Feng, Yin Zhuanghong shed tears like rain.

She was feeling extremely sad and guilty. If he hadn’t saved her, Chu Feng wouldn’t have ended up like that.

“This seems to be the first time I’ve seen you cry, girl.”

Although Chu Feng was covered in wounds and on the verge of dying, the corners of his mouth rose into a faint smile.

“I’m sorry. I’m sorry. It’s all my fault.”

Yin Zhuanghong apologized nonstop. She felt that she was the one that had harmed Chu Feng..

“It’s enough. Don’t cry anymore. I’m not dead yet,” said Chu Feng.

“Clamor~~~”

Right after Chu Feng finished saying those words, blood-red gaseous flames began to pour from his body.

As the blood-red gaseous flames appeared, his wounds began to heal. Even his aura was quickly recovering.

“Girl, your embrace is quite comfortable,” Chu Feng opened his mouth and revealed a wide smile.

Compared to his previous smile, the smile on his face at that moment appeared very vile and disgusting.

“What’s going on with you?”

“Why...?”

Yin Zhuanghong immediately let go of Chu Feng. She looked at him with confusion.

“Girl, were you thinking that by shooting that ruler you infused with your aura into the formation core, you’d be able to obtain the power of the formation core? You’re simply too foolish.”

“One’s aura is not enough. One must combine their aura with their blood.”

“However, even aura and blood will not be enough. You’ll also need this.”

As Chu Feng spoke, he opened his palm, and a special sort of spring water appeared in his hand.

“That... is that the item that you said was inside that entrance?” asked Yin Zhuanghong.

“Correct. This here is able to conceal my blood and aura. After they’re concealed, the formation core will not be able to detect them, and will bring my blood and aura into the formation core,” said Chu Feng.

“Thus, you were deliberately allowing yourself to be injured earlier?” asked Yin Zhuanghong.

“That’s right,” Chu Feng nodded.

“Then... you’ve obtained the power of the formation core?” asked Yin Zhuanghong.

“That’s right. I think that we can go and rescue the elders of your Red-dress Holy Land now,” said Chu Feng.

“Great,” Yin Zhuanghong nodded.

“Woosh~~~”

Right after Yin Zhuanghong said those words, her body was enveloped by blood-red gaseous flames. Then, she began to move rapidly.

“Chu Feng, thank you.”

Yin Zhanghong looked to Chu Feng.

“What are you thinking me for?” asked Chu Feng.

“If it wasn’t for you, our Red-dress Holy Land would likely really suffer disastrously,” said Yin Zhuanghong.

“We’re friends. There’s no need such things between friends.”

“However, there is one thing that I need to tell you. You’d best prepare yourself for it,” said Chu Feng.

“What is it?” asked Yin Zhuanghong.

“Does this Ancient Era’s Blood Refinement Pond contain treasures?” asked Chu Feng.

“Correct. It contains treasures from the Ancient Era. Merely, we still have no idea what exactly the treasures are, since we’ve been unable to successfully open this Ancient Era’s Blood Refinement Pond the entire time,” said Yin Zhuanghong.

“As I’ve obtained the power of the formation core now, I am able to detect certain things in the Ancient Era’s Blood Refinement Pond.”

“I know where the treasures are located.”

“However, that place is currently empty,” said Chu Feng. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Empty? What do you mean?” asked Yin Zhuanghong.

“Someone has already retrieved all the treasures in the Ancient Era’s Blood Refinement Pond,” said Chu Feng.

“Someone took them already? How could that be possible?”

“Could it be that this Ancient Era’s Blood Refinement Pond never had any treasure to begin with?”

“Did we discover it too late, and the treasures in the Ancient Era’s Blood Refinement Pond were already taken by the time we discovered it?”

“But, that shouldn’t be the case. Our Red-dress Holy Land has guarded this Ancient Era’s Blood Refinement Pond for tens of thousands of years.”

Yin Zhuanghong became very emotional.

The Ancient Era’s Blood Refinement Pond was simply too important to them. They’d guarded it for so many years for the sake of obtaining the treasures inside. Yet, Chu Feng was saying that those treasures were gone. She found it very difficult to accept.
