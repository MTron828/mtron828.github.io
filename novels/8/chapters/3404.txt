Chapter 3404 - The World Spiritist Immortal King’s Acknowledgement

“Buzz~~~”

After being astonished, the crowd soon noticed that there were three dazzling bodies of light within the light that filled the sky.

Upon closer inspection, they could see that they were actually three spirit formation swords. With rapid speed, the three spirit formation swords flew toward Chu Feng, and ultimately stopped right behind him.

“This guy, he really annihilated that Utmost Exalted-level monster?”

The expressions of astonishment on the crowd’s faces grew even stronger. The acknowledgement from the three spirit formation swords had made the crowd certain that Chu Feng had really succeeded.

Seeing that Chu Feng had managed to obtain three spirit formation swords at once, the crowd were all very surprised.

However, what the crowd was most surprised by was how Chu Feng managed to eliminate that Utmost Exalted-level expert with only a single fist strike.

“Turns out, that Utmost Exalted-level monster was nothing more than an illusion.”

“So that was an illusion? No wonder, no wonder it appeared as if it could not see us, did not attack us, and was weaker than even that Exalted-level sword guardian beast.”

“In that case, wouldn’t it mean that Chu Feng has managed to benefit enormously without putting in real effort?”

Soon, someone felt that the Utmost Exalted-level monster was nothing more than an illusion, and did not possess an Utmost Exalted’s level of strength at all.

Once that idea was proposed, the crowd all began to endorse it.

They felt that Chu Feng, as a Martial Immortal, couldn’t possibly eliminate an Utmost Exalted-level monster with a single fist strike. If that monster was a fake Utmost Exalted-level existence, then it would all make sense.

“Grandmaster, that wasn’t an illusion, was it?”

Outside the grand formation, Wuming Xingyun and the others turned their eyes to Grandmaster Liangqiu.

“It was naturally not an illusion,” Grandmaster Liangqiu said.

“Then how did Chu Feng accomplish such a feat?”

Curiosity filled the crowd’s eyes. A Martial Immortal destroying an Utmost Exalted-level existence was simply too inconceivable.

“Only Chu Feng himself knows exactly what he experienced. His unimaginable accomplishment serves as proof of how unimaginable his experience was.”

“The treasures left behind by the World Spiritist Immortal King are only for those that are sufficiently powerful,” Grandmaster Liangqiu said.

Hearing those words, the expressions and the gazes with which Liangqiu Chengfeng and the others looked to Chu Feng became even more appreciative and filled with admiration.

They did not know what Chu Feng had experienced. However, the fact that he was able to accomplish such an unimaginable feat illustrated one thing -- he must’ve obtained the World Spiritist Immortal King’s acknowledgement.

Thus, regardless of how he accomplished it, he was qualified.

“Chu Feng, how did you get in here?” Linghu Tiemian asked Chu Feng coldly.

Linghu Mingye and Linghu Lun also looked to Chu Feng with questioning gazes. Displeasure could be seen on their faces.

They all felt that Chu Feng had not entered the grand formation through the twelve zodiac entrances. Instead, he had entered the grand formation through some underhanded methods, and gained an unfair advantage.

“Didn’t you all see how I came in here?” Facing the suspicions of Linghu Tiemian and the others, Chu Feng’s attitude was not at all friendly. Instead, he looked at them like he was looking at a bunch of fools.

“We have all entered through the twelve zodiac entrances. As for you, you were already eliminated. You’re unqualified to show up here,” Linghu Tiemian decided to speak his heart.

“Who told you that I’d been eliminated?”

“Since when did you get to decide whether I am qualified or not?” Chu Feng spoke with contempt.

“Both you and Wuma Shengjie chose the rat zodiac’s entrance. As for Wuma Shengjie, he entered through the rat zodiac’s entrance. If you were not eliminated, what are you then?” Linghu Tiemian questioned.

“Let me clarify this for you first. Chu Feng and I never fought one another. Even if we were to fight, I wouldn’t be a match for him,” Wuma Shengjie suddenly spoke.

“Wuma Shengjie, who are you trying to deceive?”

“If you didn’t fight against Chu Feng, how come you’re the one who entered through the rat zodiac’s entrance, and not him?”

“Don’t tell me that Chu Feng allowed you to come in instead.”

Linghu Tiemian had a mocking expression on his face. There was also a trace of anger. He felt that Wuma Shengjie was deliberately trying to defend Chu Feng.

“That’s right, he allowed me to enter,” Wuma Shengjie nodded.

“You...”

Linghu Tiemian turned green with anger. He had wanted to ridicule Wuma Shengjie. Never did he expect that Wuma Shengjie would actually admit to it.

He actually really ended up saying that he was allowed in by Chu Feng.

However, as everyone knew, the entrances of the twelve zodiacs would only be opened once within a certain period of time. Otherwise, those younger generations would not have fought one another over the entrances. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

How could Chu Feng allow Wuma Shengjie to enter?

At that moment, it was not only Linghu Tiemian who didn’t believe it; the others present also didn’t believe it.

Right at that moment, Linghu Hongfei suddenly spoke.

“It would appear that there’s another way to enter here apart from the twelve zodiac entrances.”

“Brother Chu Feng must’ve learned of another method to enter this place, correct?”

“Linghu Tiemian, they all say that one’s intelligence determines one’s strength. It’s no wonder this brother of yours is so much stronger than you. Look at his intelligence, you’re simply incapable of even comparing to him,” Chu Feng said to Linghu Tiemian.

“You!!!” Linghu Tiemian gnashed his teeth furiously.

He truly never imagined Chu Feng to be so arrogant as to not place him in his eyes, even with Linghu Hongfei standing there.

“Brother Chu Feng, I am Linghu Hongfei. It’s my pleasure to meet you.”

With a smile on his face, Linghu Hongfei clasped his fist respectfully at Chu Feng.

Seeing that, Chu Feng immediately clasped his fist to return the respectful gesture. “I am Chu Feng, I’m honored to be able to meet brother Hongfei today.”

“Brother Chu Feng, since those three spirit formation swords have acknowledged you now, I believe you should be able to sense their usage.”

“Why don’t we open that gate right away? At that time, all of us here will be able to touch that power. I believe we’ll all be able to benefit from it.”

Hearing what Linghu Hongfei said, the expressions of the crowd within the grand formation changed. They did not understand the spirit formation swords that well. However, what Linghu Hongfei had just said had allowed them to learn about some extraordinary matters.

“Big brother Chu Feng, is that power that you speak of the power that could allow us to make a breakthrough in our world spirit techniques?” Linghu Yueyue asked.

“Precisely,” Linghu Hongfei nodded.

“Young master Hongfei, would we also be able to obtain that power even though we don’t possess any spirit formation swords?” Someone asked.

“You will obtain less power without spirit formation swords. However, you’ll still be able to obtain some power. However, it is everyone’s comprehensive ability that will decide how much you will be able to obtain.”

“Of course, the more spirit formation swords there are, the more power we’ll be able to unlock.”

“Now that we have five spirit formation swords at hand, we’re practically able to unlock all of the power the World Spiritist Immortal King left in here. Thus, I believe that everyone will be able to benefit considerably,” Linghu Hongfei said.

“That’s truly great!”

“And here I thought we would be returning empty-handed. Never would I have expected to be able to enjoy young master Linghu’s good fortune.”

“Lord Linghu Hongfei, you are truly our benefactor.”

At that moment, the crowd all felt extremely joyous. They were simply pleased beyond expectation.

However, at the moment when the crowd were overjoyed and impatient to obtain the treasures left behind by the World Spiritist Immortal King, a voice sounded. That voice was like a basin of cold water poured over the crowd.

“My apologies, I don’t plan to participate in this event,” Chu Feng looked at the crowd with a very indifferent look.
