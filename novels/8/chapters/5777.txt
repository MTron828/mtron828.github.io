Chapter 5777: Not In a Mood to Celebrate

Boom!

Huangfu Fanni’s disintegrated body flowed into Chu Feng’s palm, as the latter collected his origin energies. Chu Feng would never spare someone who had tried to kill Xian Miaomiao and Long Chengyu.

“What a pity he used up all of the forbidden medicine.” Chu Feng shook his head after checking Huangfu Fanni’s disintegrated body for treasures.

“Chu Feng… did you know the Huangfu Heavenly Clan beforehand?” Long Chengyu asked.

“I don’t know them.” Chu Feng shook his head.

“Then why do you know their God Taboo Martial Skill?” Long Chengyu asked.

“Brother Long, I can’t answer that question. All of us have our own secrets,” Chu Feng replied. He wasn’t planning to tell anyone about Dark Plunder for the time being.

“You’re too strong, Brother Chu Feng. I previously thought I wouldn’t pale too much compared to you, but I don’t think that way anymore,” Long Chengyu said with a bitter smile.

He used to think that he was at least the top three prodigies of the world of cultivation, but he didn’t think that he was even within the top ten anymore. On the other hand, Chu Feng was a strong contender to be the strongest junior.

“We’re on the same side. Don’t say such words.” While he was speaking, Chu Feng turned to Xian Miaomiao, passed a pill to her, and said, “Miaomiao, take this.”

“I’m fine, Chu Feng. I’m feeling much better now.” Xian Miaomiao even flashed her usual beaming smile to reassure Chu Feng.

“Just take it. I took this from Huangfu Fanni’s Cosmos Sack. I’ve already checked and confirmed that it’ll be useful to you. It’ll be a waste not to use it,” Chu Feng said as he stuffed the pill into Xian Miaomiao’s hand.

“I’ll take it as his compensation then.” Xian Miaomiao popped the pill into her mouth.

“Speaking of which, Qin Xuan, how did you end up on the same side as our Xian Miaomiao and Brother Long? Did you switch sides, or were you forced to join hands?” Chu Feng asked.

Chu Feng didn’t smile at Qin Xuan, but his attitude wasn’t hostile either. He remembered how Qin Xuan had told Long Chengyu to bring Xian Miaomiao to safety earlier, and that changed his impression of him.

“I was forced to join hands with them, but I’m thinking of switching sides now. Chu Feng, you saved me today, so I shan’t pursue the matter of you bullying my younger brother… and it’s not as if I can do anything to you even if I want to anyway,” Qin Xuan said with an awkward smile.

He was hoping to use this as an impetus to improve their relationship. As much as possible, he didn’t want to make an enemy out of the monstrous Chu Feng.

“You’re indeed no match for me, but I didn’t come here for you either. I’m here to save Miaomiao and Brother Long. I wouldn’t have intervened if you were the only one here,” Chu Feng said.

“Yes, I understand.” Qin Xuan’s smile became even more awkward.

“Also, I didn’t bully your younger brother. I have the utmost disdain for those who oppress the weak for no reason. Your younger brother was arrogant back in the Ancient Realm. He couldn’t defeat us, so he brought up your name in hopes we’d lower our heads. Your younger brother was the one trying to bully us, but he failed because he was too weak,” Chu Feng said.

“My younger brother rarely lies to me.” Those words relayed that Qin Xuan trusted his younger brother more.

“Qin Xuan, I honestly don’t care how you look at me, but let me say a bit more since you did help Miaomiao and Brother Long today. Touch your heart—do you really not know what kind of person your younger brother is, or have you simply been trying to turn your eyes away from it? Are you really unaware of what your younger brother has been doing, or are you just denying it?

“You should know that your self-deception only results in more innocent people being harmed by your younger brother, and he’s sullying your name while doing so. Is that what you want to see? That’s all I have to say. Do think about it.”

After saying his piece, Chu Feng turned to his comrades and said, “Miaomiao, Brother Long, let’s set off. We’re lagging behind now.”

Chu Feng flitted out of the ancient palace and headed deeper into the trial. Xian Miaomiao and Long Chengyu quickly followed him.

Meanwhile, Qin Xuan stood on the spot in deep contemplation. Chu Feng’s words had struck a chord in his heart. He had heard about Qin Shu’s deeds, but he refused to believe or admit that his younger brother would do something like that.

But was this the correct thing to do?

Chu Feng’s group encountered many obstacles along the way, but be it illusions, mechanisms, formations, or monsters, none of these posed a challenge to him. Long Chengyu, Qin Xuan, and Xian Miaomiao only had to follow him; they didn’t even have to lift a finger at all.

“This is not what I imagined from the Nine Heavens’ Zenith,” Qin Xuan remarked with a sigh.

As the strongest junior in the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect, he had always been the one charging at the forefront, with hordes of people cheering him on behind.

“Doesn’t it feel great?” Long Chengyu asked with a smile.

“It does feel great, but I also feel my confidence being rattled,” Qin Xuan replied.

“No worries. You’ll get used to it soon.” Long Chengyu chuckled.

Qin Xuan looked at Chu Feng, who was working on a formation. That was a formation he would have taken some time to decipher, but Chu Feng breached it in a matter of moments. He shook his head and sighed. “Haa, I’m starting to doubt whether I’m a prodigy at all.”

The group advanced, and they soon arrived at a new area.

Chu Feng’s eyes lit up in delight. “We’re reaching.”

This was the place where he had seen Xianhai Shaoyu, Little Fishy, and Feng Ling in the mirror earlier on. Many passageways led here, and the one Chu Feng and the others took was only one of them. Based on what he had observed in the mirror, it shouldn’t take long for them to catch up with Xianhai Shaoyu and the others.

Just as he had expected, after traveling a little more and deciphering a formation, they arrived before a platform and a spirit formation gate. It looked like there should have been something on the platform, but there was nothing there now.

“What does this mean?” Long Chengyu was confused.

“Someone must have taken the item from the platform,” Chu Feng said.

“So fast?” Long Chengyu was taken aback.

“It’s fine. It should be our people.” Chu Feng figured that Xianhai Shaoyu’s group was the one who took the item.

So, the four of them entered the spirit formation gate.

They soon arrived at an ancient hall that was much larger than the ancient palace they were in. This ancient hall felt more like a realm in itself that had been bricked off, though it still felt stifling being in such an enclosed space, no matter how big the space was.

Chu Feng spotted Xianhai Shaoyu, Little Fishy, and Feng Ling, as well as Yuwen Yanri and two other experts from the Divine Body Heavenly Mansion not too far away. There was a gigantic treasure chest with two keyholes in front of them.

Xianhai Shaoyu’s group and Yuwen Yanri’s group stood at one side of the treasure chest, while Huangfu Shengyu, Huangfu Jiangyao, and Huangfu Shangyang stood at the other side.

“They are here too.”

Chu Feng thought that Xianhai Shaoyu’s group would encounter Huangfu Shengyu’s group, which was why he anxiously rushed here. He had learned from Liu Kuo that the Huangfus had an advantage here, after all.

Fortunately, he made it in time.VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Big brother!”

Little Fishy was the first one to notice Chu Feng. She was still yawning a second ago, but her eyes lit up the moment she saw Chu Feng, and she quickly flitted over to his side.

“Big sister Miaomiao, you’re lucky to be paired with big brother!” Little Fishy exclaimed.

“We only met later, but it was lucky we met. Otherwise, we would have been dead by now,” Xian Miaomiao said.

“Oh?” Little Fishy sensed that something might have happened.

“Brother Chu Feng,” Xianhai Shaoyu’s voice echoed from afar.

While Xianhai Shaoyu and Feng Ling didn’t rush over to welcome them, the two of them waved their hands at them smilingly.

In contrast, Huangfu Shengyu and the others couldn’t bring themselves to smile upon seeing Chu Feng.
