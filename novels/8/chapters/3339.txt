Chapter 3339 - Not Allowed To Do Anything To Chu Feng

The reason why the crowd were so pleasantly surprised upon seeing the figure that walked out from the barrier was because that person’s appearance was simply identical to Chu Feng.

Furthermore, no matter how they inspected him, they were unable to determine that he was in disguise.

“Lady Supreme Elder, this person is?” Someone asked.

“You all need not know who this person is. All you need to know is that he will be poisoning the clan chief tomorrow. At that time, you all will have to cooperate with Chu Hanqing and I in suppressing that Chu Feng,” Chu Hanyouyou said.

“We will do as Lady Supreme Elder commands,” The crowd all half-kneeled on the ground.

“You may disperse,” Chu Hanyouyou waved her hand, and then the crowd scattered and left in succession. They all left very secretly, and even used concealment methods for fear of being discovered. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Finally, apart from Chu Hanyouyou and Chu Hanqing, only that man who had an identical appearance to Chu Feng remained.

“We’ll have to trouble you with this matter,” Chu Hanqing and Chu Hanyouyou both clasped their fists at that man. Their attitude very courteous.

“You all need not thank me. I am not doing this for your sake. Instead, it is for my own sake. I will have that Chu Feng’s reputation be swept away completely, and have him die a miserable death.”

When that man talked, even his voice was completely identical to Chu Feng’s. Merely, his tone was filled with hatred toward Chu Feng.

“May I know exactly what sort of conflict you have with Chu Feng?” Chu Hanqing asked.

At the same time, Chu Hanyouyou fixed her eyes on the imposter.

That person had come to find them to take care of Chu Feng of his own accord. Even the plan was proposed by him.

Although that person had done some things to prove that he wanted to take care of Chu Feng, which caused Chu Hanqing and Chu Hanyouyou to ultimately accept his cooperation, they were still on guard against him.

“You two need not know about it. Since I am willing to cooperate with you two, it means that I trust the two of you. Thus, I hope that you will place your trust in me too,” That man said.

“Of course,” Chu Hanqing and Chu Hanyouyou nodded their heads.

“Wuu~~~”

Suddenly, that man revealed a painful expression. Then, his body turned into two silhouettes, and he began to violently sway back and forth.

However, that situation only lasted for a short moment before that man regained the appearance of Chu Feng.

“What are you…?”

Seeing this, both Chu Hanqing and Chu Hanyouyou revealed worried looks.

They were both able to tell that there seemed to be something wrong with the man’s body.

What they were worried about was naturally not that man’s health. Instead, they were worried about tomorrow; they were afraid that it might affect their plan.

“It’s fine. It’s merely a minor defect. Tomorrow, I will take medicine to suppress it. There will be absolutely no mishaps,” That man said.

“That would be for the best,” Chu Hanqing and Chu Hanyouyou said.

“In that case, let us meet again tomorrow,” The man’s body shifted. He turned into a black silhouette and rapidly flew away.

At that time, Chu Hanqing and Chu Hanyouyou looked to one another.

“That man is truly unreassuring,” Chu Hanqing said.

“Indeed. However, with things having reached this stage, we have no alternative but to take this risk, for this might be our only opportunity,” Chu Hanyouyou said.

The next day, Chu Hanyouyou and Chu Hanqing invited the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief over.

As they had planned it beforehand, they very easily accomplished the first step of their plan.

They deliberately created a gathering with many of the Chu Heavenly Clan’s upper echelons present. Even Chu Xuanzhengfa and Chu Hanpeng were present.

Originally, this was only a simple family gathering, and everyone was talking cheerfully and wittily. Even though the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief and the various Supreme Elders were present, the atmosphere was still very unrestrained.

However, when Chu Feng appeared, the crowd all took the same action without prior consultation, and stopped their conversations to look to him.

Chu Feng was carrying a container, and slowly walking into the crowd’s field of view.

For the majority of the crowd, their eyes were not focused on Chu Feng. Instead, they were focused on the container Chu Feng was carrying with both hands. They were very curious as to what might be inside it.

As for Chu Hanqing, Chu Hanyouyou and the others, they were extremely nervous.

For those with an inferior ability to contain their emotions, they were not only sweating profusely, but their bodies were even shivering.

The reason for that was because they knew very well that the person who had appeared was not the actual Chu Feng. Instead, he was the imposter that they’d found.

As for the real Chu Feng, he was still inside his palace hall, guarded by their people. If he were to exit his palace, they would immediately be notified, so as to prevent both Chu Fengs from appearing in the same place.

Nevertheless, they were still worried.

Even though they were truly incapable of seeing through that fake Chu Feng’s disguise, they could not be certain if the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief would be able to see through it.

In merely the blink of an eye, the imposter Chu Feng had arrived. He half-kneeled on the ground and spoke with a very respectful tone, “Chu Feng pays his respects to Lord Clan Chief, Supreme Elders and the various seniors.”

“Chu Feng, quickly, stand up. Didn’t you plan to enter closed-door training? Why would you appear here today?” The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was very happy to see Chu Feng. He was smiling even more joyously at that moment, than before.

Evidently, he had not discovered that the Chu Feng before him was an imposter.

“Knowing that Lord Clan Chief has exhausted himself, Chu Feng has deliberately slow-cooked a bowl of soup for Lord Clan Chief using rare and precious treasures so as to bring relief to Lord Clan Chief’s tiredness,” Chu Feng said.

“Boy, since when did you learn such flattery?” Although the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said those words, he was beaming with smiles. Immediately, he waved his hand and said, “Come, let me have a taste of your culinary skill.”

Seeing this, the imposter Chu Feng carried the bowl of soup in his hand and began to walk toward the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief with quick steps.

“It must be said, this soup tastes very good.”

The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief opened the container and took a whiff of the soup inside. Then, he gulped the medicinal soup down in one go.

At that moment, the people that did not know of the scheme had no idea that something fishy was going on. Instead, they were watching all of this with smiles on their faces.

“Puuu~~~”

Suddenly, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief sprayed out a mouthful of blood. Then, he looked to Chu Feng with an astonished expression.

He had realized that he had been poisoned, poisoned by Chu Feng’s soup. However, he did not mention that he had been poisoned by the soup, and instead put the bowl of soup away so as to not let others realize the matter.

“Lord Clan Chief, are you alright?”

However, seeing the mouthful of black blood that was sprayed out by the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, the crowd all started to panic, and swarmed toward him.

As for Chu Hanqing, he even snatched the bowl away from the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief. Then, he loudly shouted, “It’s this soup! There’s poison in this soup! Chu Feng, you dare to poison Lord Clan Chief?!”

“What?!”

The crowd all looked to Chu Feng with disbelief upon hearing those words. Those who did not know the truth were filled with suspicion. They were unable to accept that Chu Feng would poison the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief. After all, there was no motivation for him to do such a thing.

“Puuu~~~”

Right at that moment, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief began to vomit blood like a spring-fountain. Furthermore, the blood he vomited was all black, and emitting a nasty stink.

After the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief vomited blood, his body became extremely shriveled, and all his hair fell out. He looked no different from a mummified corpse. His health became frighteningly weak.

However, although he was like that, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief still exerted his final strength to shout, “All Chu Heavenly Clansmen, listen up! You are not allowed to do anything to Chu Feng!!!”

After he finished saying those words, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief’s body leaned to one side, and fell back onto the chair. He had lost consciousness.
