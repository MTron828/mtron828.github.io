Chapter 5652: He Flees, He Chases, She Chases

Fu Xing didn’t rush to infuse her spirit power into the sword but instead walked aside.

Chu Feng noticed that Fu Xing had something to say, so he followed her too.

“Chu Feng, you are a good person, right?” Fu Xing asked.

“Well… I can’t answer that question. Some see me as a good person, but more people see me as a villain,” Chu Feng replied deprecatingly. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Can I trust you?” Fu Xing asked.

Chu Feng thought about it for a moment before replying, “You can.”

“You have to keep this secret for me. It might cost my life if word gets out,” Fu Xing replied as she passed a scroll to him.

Chu Feng opened the scroll. It was a special cultivation technique for world spiritists named Combat Enhancement Formula. Its simple name crudely relayed its purpose, and it also told him why Fu Xing needed to keep this a secret.

The Combat Enhancement Formula was created by the founder of the Celestial Master’s Sacred Sect. It required the consumption of a secret pill, the Celestial Master’s Sacred Pill, to raise one’s fighting prowess.

“You’re from the Celestial Master’s Sacred Sect?” Chu Feng asked via voice transmission even though there was no one around.

“Yes, I’m from the Celestial Master’s Sacred Sect. Since you know about the Celestial Master’s Sacred Sect, you should know what will happen if the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion learns about my identity,” Fu Xing said.

“Don’t worry, I’ll keep it a secret for you,” Chu Feng replied.

“It shouldn’t be tough for you to grasp this formula,” Fu Xing replied.

“I should be able to execute it right away,” Chu Feng replied.

Fu Xing opened up her palm to reveal an ordinary-looking yellow pill.

“This is the Celestial Master’s Sacred Pill. Only our founder is capable of forging this pill, so there are only a fixed number of them left. This pill, when used together with our Combat Enhancement Formula, significantly raises one’s spirit power without any side effects,” Fu Xing said.

Chu Feng took the pill and inspected it. It looked normal at first glance, but he could sense how extraordinary it was with his psyche. No forbidden medicine could compete with it.

“It’s good stuff,” Chu Feng remarked.

Fu Xing passed another scroll to Chu Feng. Unfurling it revealed a special support formation to enhance Fu Xing’s fighting prowess. She was hoping that Chu Feng could support her.

“I’m not making light of you, but we have a common enemy now. The important thing is to defeat him,” Fu Xing said.

“I’m fine with it as long as I get a share of the fruit,” Chu Feng replied. He rolled the scrolls back up and passed them back to Fu Xing.

.

“Aren’t you going to take another look?” Fu Xing asked.

Chu Feng chuckled. Without saying a word, he quickly constructed a massive formation. It was the support formation Fu Xing had wanted him to learn.

“I’m glad my master didn’t meet you beforehand, or else he wouldn’t have taken me in as his disciple,” Fu Xing said with a sigh.

She then took out another Celestial Master’s Sacred Pill and swallowed it. She formed a series of hand seals, and her spirit power grew at a visible rate. She channeled her spirit power into the black metal sword, causing it to transform into a rose-red sword.

The transformed sword was both sharp and beautiful, and it greatly boosted Fu Xing’s fighting prowess.

Chu Feng swallowed the Celestial Master’s Sacred Pill and channeled the Combat Enhancement Pill too, causing his fighting prowess to increase as well. He then stepped into the hall and began channeling his spirit power into the support formation.

The black humanoid figure inside the hall opened his eyes and picked up its saber. With a casual slash, it unleashed a crescent arc of spirit power at Chu Feng.

Boom!

The spirit power was neutralized by another surge of sword qi before it could reach Chu Feng. Fu Xing had also stepped into the hall with her rose-red sword.

Chu Feng quickly channeled the support formation, causing a light pillar to surge forth from it and fuse together with Fu Xing. The latter’s fighting prowess grew once more.

Without any hesitation, Fu Xing charged at the black humanoid figure. With the support of her sword, Chu Feng’s support formation, and the Celestial Master’s Sacred Pill, she was now able to stand her ground against the black humanoid figure.

“One attacks while the other supports? I see. However, there’s a fatal flaw in your plan,” the black humanoid figure sneered.

There was a surge of teleportation energy, and the black humanoid figure vanished into thin air. By the time he reappeared, he was already holding a sword before Chu Feng.

He had chosen to ignore Fu Xing to focus on Chu Feng first!

However, Chu Feng chuckled at the black humanoid figure’s approach. A surge of teleportation energy enveloped him, and he vanished into thin air. A moment later, he reappeared by the corner of the hall.

“You were able to construct a teleportation formation while channeling the support formation? I’m impressed… but are you able to maneuver faster than me?”

The black humanoid figure could tell how Chu Feng escaped, but he wasn’t too surprised by it. Another surge of teleportation energy enveloped him, and he reappeared beside Chu Feng.

However, Chu Feng had already anticipated such a move. As soon as the black humanoid figure disappeared, he activated his teleportation formation to escape to another corner of the hall.

“Stop running and fight with me!” Fu Xing exclaimed as she chased after the black humanoid figure, but the latter refused to pay her any heed.

It resulted in a peculiar situation where one was running, one was chasing, and one was chasing the chaser.
