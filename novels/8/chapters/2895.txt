Chapter 2895 - Taking Advantage Of Eggy

Suddenly, Chu Feng stood up again. Joy covered his face, “I... I’ve actually made a breakthrough?”

Then, with a thought, boundless spirit power was released from his body.

Merely, the spirit power emitted by Chu Feng was no longer Dragon Mark spirit power. Instead, it had become Insect Mark spirit power.

Although it was Insect Mark spirit power, Chu Feng was wild with joy, and was so excited that he started grinning from ear to ear as he looked at it.

The reason for that was because Chu Feng’s spirit power was no longer Immortal-cloak. Rather, it was Exalted-cloak.

Chu Feng had become an Insect Mark Exalted-cloak World Spiritist.

“This trip has truly not been made in vain. I’ve actually became an Exalted-cloak World Spiritist.”

Even though Chu Feng knew that he would become an Exalted-cloak World Spiritist sooner or later, the Inheritance Formation within the palace had evidently greatly accelerated the speed of his progress to become an Exalted-cloak World Spiritist.

“Buzz~~~”

Right at that moment, dazzling light once again emerged from the stone case. Soon, the dazzling light enveloped Chu Feng again.

“There’s more inheritance? This time... it’s actually martial comprehension?”

Chu Feng simply did not dare to believe his eyes. The light that had enveloped him was no longer a spirit formation. Rather, it was martial comprehension that had been artificially condensed together.

As the martial comprehension was artificially gathered, there was simply no need for Chu Feng to comprehend it. After it entered Chu Feng’s body, it started assimilating with his soul and fusing with his body.

Furthermore, after the martial comprehension entered Chu Feng’s body, Chu Feng soon felt the opportunity to make a breakthrough. Furthermore, this sensation of being able to make a breakthrough was very intense.

This time around, Chu Feng was ninety percent certain that he would be able to successfully reach a breakthrough.

“Holy! This is simply too great! As long as I am willing, I can break through and become a rank six True Immortal right now.”

Chu Feng was so excited even his hair started to stand on end.

Rank six True Immortal. If Chu Feng were to break through to rank six True Immortal, he would be able to fight against rank eight True Immortals with the abilities that he had grasped. With that level of strength, very few people among the younger generation would be able to contend against him.

However, Chu Feng did not immediately attempt to make his breakthrough. The reason for that was because he was surprised to discover that the stone case had shattered. After it shattered, it turned into a ray of light and formed a series of large words.

‘Receive the inheritance and the gate shall open.’

Those words only appeared for a split second before disappearing like the light of a firefly.

The intention behind those words was very clear. Only by receiving all of the treasures in the palace would the exit appear.

“Regardless, I must first leave this place so as to not make Eggy worry.”

Chu Feng actually wanted to make his breakthrough as soon as possible. However, he had lost his connection with Eggy the moment he entered the place.

Chu Feng felt that Eggy would definitely be extremely worried for his safety. Thus, for the sake of not making Eggy worry, he must leave that place as quickly as possible.

Even the breakthrough must be put off momentarily.

After all, to Chu Feng, Her Lady Queen was even more important than his cultivation.

Thus, Chu Feng gathered all of the treasures present into his Cosmos Sack.

After the treasures entered his cosmos sack, a gate appeared.

Upon seeing that spirit formation gate, Chu Feng finally heaved a sigh of relief. He was finally able to leave.

When thinking about being able to see Her Lady Queen and share his harvest with her, Chu Feng started to walk toward that spirit formation gate impatiently.

“Aiyoh~~~”

However, right after Chu feng approached that spirit formation gate, a figure suddenly entered that spirit formation gate and smashed firmly into Chu feng’s chest. The powerful impact knocked Chu Feng to the ground.

The sudden collision had originally caused Chu Feng to feel slightly angry. However, when he lowered his head to look, Chu Feng immediately started grinning from ear to ear.

He saw Her Lady Queen in his bosom.

It turned out that the thing that had collided into him was Her Lady Queen.

“Eggy? How did you get in here?”

“Your cultivation? Heavens! My god! Eggy, your... your... your cultivation actually increased to rank five True Immortal?! Your cultivation is now the same as my own?!”

“My dear Eggy, what did you experience in the first Inheritance Site?”

Chu Feng noticed Her Lady Queen’s cultivation, and became endlessly excited.

The reason for that was because the change in Her Lady Queen’s cultivation was simply too enormous. This simply surpassed his imagination.

That said, Chu Feng was also feeling happy for Her Lady Queen from the bottom of his heart. In fact, he was even more happy for Her Lady Queen than when he had obtained Exalted Archer’s inheritance.

Right at that moment, Chu Feng was suddenly stunned.

He discovered that Her Lady Queen was actually hugging him tightly. Her exceptionally beautiful face was pushed tightly into his chest.

Her Lady Queen didn’t say a word. Just like that, she continued to tightly hug Chu Feng with her eyes closed.

Furthermore, two streams of sparking tears were rolling down her cheeks.

Seeing Her Lady Queen like this, Chu Feng, who was originally overwhelmed with excitement immediately, quieted down.

Distress filled his heart.

“I’m sorry, I’ve made you worry.”

As Chu Feng spoke, he raised his hand and gently wiped away the tears on Her Lady Queen’s cheeks.

Then, he spread his arms and hugged Her Lady Queen.

At that moment, Her Lady Queen’s aroma had not only entered Chu Feng’s nose, it had also entered Chu Feng’s heart.

Chu Feng felt that he was in extreme bliss. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

It was for no other reason than because Her Lady Queen was within his bosom.

This sort of sensation was simply even more intoxicating than gaining control over the entire world.

“Woosh~~~”

However, before Chu Feng could properly enjoy that feeling of bliss, Her Lady Queen removed herself from Chu Feng’s embrace.

“What’s this? Are you trying to take advantage of this Queen?”

Her Lady Queen narrowed her brows and used a grudge-filled gaze to stare at Chu Feng.
