Chapter 4113 - Western Ghost Wasp

For the sake of rescuing Little Fishy as quickly as possible, Chu Feng unleashed his full strength to proceed with his fastest speed.

With Fumo Xin’er’s guidance, he soon arrived at the border of the sealed territory.

That was a spirit formation that sealed off heaven and earth. Once one passed through that spirit formation, one would leave the sealed territory.

That spirit formation was very remarkable.

For the great majority of spirit formations, regardless of how powerful they might be, their appearance would be like that of a wall.

Regardless of what sort of method one used, one would be able to pass through the spirit formation by passing through that wall.

However, this spirit formation was not that simple.

Upon entering that spirit formation, Chu Feng felt as if he had entered a world of nothingness, a world of primal chaos.

Not only was the world enormous in size, but Chu Feng also received severe interference to his spirit power and sight.

Furthermore, violent winds erupted and mist filled the air. Because of that, Chu Feng was unable to distinguish directions.

That place was simply a maze.

Not only was the maze capable of confusing outsiders, but it was also able to confuse the people inside the sealed territory.

Fortunately, Fumo Xin’er showed him the way. Otherwise, if Chu Feng were on his own, passing through this spirit formation would be no easy task.

Of course, the reason why Fumo Xin’er was able to guide Chu Feng was not because she had a better understanding of the maze. Instead, it was because she held a special compass in her hand.

It was that compass that was showing the way.

“Where did you obtain that compass?” Chu Feng asked curiously.

“It was given to me by my grandmother. My big brother also has one,” said Fumo Xin’er.

“Isn’t your grandmother against you and your brother leaving the sealed territory? Why would she give you those compasses capable of allowing the two of you to leave?” Chu Feng felt very confused.

“My grandmother isn’t really that against my brother and I going out.” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“She has a sharp tongue, but a soft heart. She also hoped that my brother and I would be able to go out and check out the society outside.”

“It’s just that she is not fond of us causing trouble,” said Fumo Xin’er.

“Wuu~~~”

“Buzz~~~”

Suddenly, a strange voice sounded up ahead.

“This is bad! Chu Feng, change directions, quickly!” Fumo Xin’er said urgently upon hearing that voice.

Actually, Chu Feng had already changed directions before she had said anything.

Even though his vision had been greatly reduced because of the spirit formation, and he was unable to detect what it was that let out the strange sound, he was able to tell merely by hearing the sound that whoever it was came with ill intent in mind.

“Buzz~~~”

Right after Chu Feng and Fumo Xin’er turned around, before they could walk far away, creatures rushed after them.

Turning around, Chu Feng saw what it was that came toward them.

It was actually a large group of hornets.

Those hornets were tens of times larger than ordinary hornets.

Each of them were fist-sized.

The number of hornets behind Chu Feng were simply innumerable. They were all densely packed together.

Forming a wave of black, the hornets rushed toward Chu Feng and Fumo Xin’er.

Most terrifying of all, the hornets were extremely fast. Even though Chu Feng was traveling with his fastest speed, the hornets were still managing to close the distance between them.

“What are those?”

Seeing that the situation was bad, Chu Feng released his spirit power. He was planning to attack those hornets.

“Don’t! You must not attack them. If you do, you’ll end up enraging them.”

“If you enrage them, we’ll undoubtedly be killed,” Fumo Xin’er warned before Chu Feng could do anything.

“What are we to do then?” asked Chu Feng.

“They’ve locked onto us. Stop running. We’ll stop and not move. Otherwise, things will be even more miserable for us,” said Fumo Xin’er.

“Stop here and now?” asked Chu Feng. He could sense how powerful those hornets were.

If they were to stop, it would be equivalent to them allowing themselves to be slaughtered by the hornets. It was clearly not a sensible act.

However, those hornets were faster than him. This meant that their strength could very well be stronger than his.

According to Fumo Xin’er, taking them on was not a sensible act.

As matters stood, he had no choice but to listen to her.

As such, he would stop moving on the spot should she say so.

After all, Fumo Xin’er knew the world much better than him.

“Stop. Right here. Right away. Immediately. Stop now.”

“Once you stop, crouch down and do not move. Hold your head with your hands and do not move in the slightest!” Fumo Xin’er shouted.

Seeing her reaction, Chu Feng did not dare to hesitate, and immediately stopped.

Furthermore, he did as Fumo Xin’er ordered, and held his head with his hands and crouched down.

“Clamor~~~”

In the next instant, the large group of hornets rushed towards Chu Feng and Fumo Xin’er.

They surrounded the two of them and rapidly swept past their bodies.

Chu Feng could clearly see the appearances of those hornets.

They were pitch-black. Even their wings were black, and they had sharp, glimmering teeth.

Whilst they were a group of hornets, their exposed fangs made them appear very fierce.

However, the group of hornets really didn’t attack Chu Feng.

Extremely puzzled but also afraid of alarming the hornets, Chu Feng decided to ask Fumo Xin’er using voice transmission, “They were clearly chasing after us. Why did they not attack us after we stopped?”

“These are Western Ghost Wasps. Reportedly, they’re from the Ancient Era.”

“They are extremely tyrannical and possess extremely strong battle power. Not even world spirit techniques are able to stop them. Furthermore, the more engaged they are in battle, the stronger they become.”

“Normally, they might only possess the battle power of a rank four or rank five Utmost Exalted. However, if you are to attack them, their battle power will increase exponentially, and might even reach peak Utmost Exalted.”

“However, if one is to stay motionless and put one’s hands over one’s head, they will generally not attack,” said Fumo Xin’er.

“In other words, what we’re doing right now is equivalent to admitting defeat. That is why they spared us?” asked Chu Feng.

“That’s more or less the case,” said Fumo Xin’er.

“In that case, wouldn’t it do for you to just tell me to stop directly? Why did you have me run?” asked Chu Feng.

“They’re the renowned Western Ghost Wasps. They’re very dangerous. If we’re able to escape, it’s definitely better to escape.”

“It’s only when we can’t escape that we’ll have to do this,” said Fumo Xin’er.

“That’s true,” Chu Feng couldn’t find a reason to refute her.

The Western Ghost Wasps spiraled around Chu Feng and Fumo Xin’er for a long time before finally turning around and leaving.

“We’ve finally avoided this calamity.”

After the Western Ghost Wasps left, Chu Feng was drenched in sweat.

It was as Fumo Xin’er had said. Even though those Western Ghost Wasps might not attack them, they were simply too dangerous.

It would be a lie to say that he wasn’t afraid after being surrounded by them.

What if one of them had wanted to taste Chu Feng’s flesh, and had suddenly bitten him?

It would be one thing if it were only a single bite. But, what if they were to expose their stingers and sting him? Who knew what sort of consequence that could have.

“Chu Feng.”

Suddenly, Fumo Xin’er grabbed Chu Feng.

Chu Feng looked at her, and discovered that she had become especially charming.

There was no need to doubt her facial beauty. She possessed a face capable of causing the downfall of a city or state.

At that moment, a blush of red had appeared on her fair-skinned face. It made her resemble the red of an apple.

Even her clear eyes had become blurred. She appeared so very alluring.

“What happened to you?” Chu Feng asked with a stern voice. He realized that Fumo Xin’er’s change was abnormal.

“Damn it. I was bitten by a Western Ghost Wasp.”

Fumo Xin’er revealed her sleeve as she spoke. Sure enough, there was a bite mark on her arm.

The wound had turned black.

The Western Ghost Wasps were poisonous.

“Let me have a look.”

Seeing that the situation was bad, Chu Feng immediately grabbed Fumo Xin’er’s wrist and began to inspect her condition.

Upon doing so, he was shocked to discover that the poison was extremely overbearing. It has already entered Fumo Xin’er’s soul.

“This...”

Chu Feng realized that the situation was very bad.

His experience as a world spiritist told him that even he would not be able to remove the poison.

Fumo Xin’er might end up losing her life.
