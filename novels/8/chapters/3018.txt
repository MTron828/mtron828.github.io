Chapter 3018 - Sky-covering Divine Lightning

“Humph,” hearing those words, Chu Haoyan’s grandfather immediately revealed a displeased expression. After letting out his cold snort, he seemed to want to say something.

However, before Chu Haoyan’s grandfather could say anything, Chu Zhiyuan’s grandfather said, “Imminent catastrophe? The one who has done all the evils was Chu Feng. Zhiyuan and Ruoshi are the victims here. We are already extremely benevolent and virtuous to not seek Chu Xuanyuan for justice. Yet, you’re saying that Chu Xuanyuan will come cause trouble for us? Forgive me for speaking bluntly, but if he really wants to seek trouble, this old man will keep him company.”

“Very well, you’re the one who said those words. I hope that you will still continue to act unyieldingly when Chu Xuanyuan returns,” Chu Xuanzhengfa sneered. Then, he waved his sleeve and said, “Lingxi, let’s go.”

After he finished saying those words, Chu Xuanzhengfa soared into the sky and left together with Chu Lingxi.

En route, Chu Lingxi started to ask Chu Xuanzhengfa in an unreconciled manner, “Lord Father, did Lord Hanpeng really believe in Chu Zhiyuan and the others?” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Does Lord Hanpeng not know what sort of people Chu Zhiyuan and Chu Ruoshi are?”

“I am also feeling very unreconciled to not be able to obtain justice for Chu Feng. However, without any proof, I am truly powerless to prove that it was Zhiyuan and Ruoshi that harmed Chu Feng.”

“If I insist on clinging to the matter, they would instead be able to fault me for not being impartial,” Chu Xuanzhengfa said.

“But, are we really going to let Chu Feng die in vain like this? Are we really going to let him shoulder accusations that do not belong to him on top of that?” Chu Lingxi asked.

Suddenly, Chu Xuanzhengfa asked Chu Lingxi with a smile on his face, “Foolish girl, did you really think that Chu Feng died?”

“Father, could it be that you’re thinking that Chu Feng didn’t die?” Chu Lingxi suddenly revealed a joyous expression.

“Chu Feng simply resembles his father too much. As for his father, he entered multiple dangerous grounds that were said to be certain death. Yet, in the end, he returned from all those places unscathed.”

“People like them possess enormous luck. They would not be killed so easily,” Chu Xuanzhengfa said.

“Lord Father, you mean to say that Chu Feng is still inside the Nine Moons Sacred Domain and not dead?”

“But... the Nine Moons Sacred Domain has already closed. Being trapped in there, he will undoubtedly die,” Chu Lingxi said.

“Actually, I’m also uncertain as to whether or not Chu Feng is still alive. However, as matters stand, we’re powerless to do anything. Rather than worrying, it’s better that we entrust our hopes to Chu Feng,” Chu Xuanzhengfa said.

“Entrust our hopes to Chu Feng? How are we to do that?” Chu Lingxi asked in a very puzzled manner.

“Let us hope that Chu Feng will be able to bring forth a miracle once more, and walk out of the Nine Moons Sacred Domain that no one could return from alive after it closes,” Chu Xuanzhengfa said.

Hearing those words, Chu Lingxi became even more worried.

To hope for a miracle, this meant that if the miracle didn’t happen, Chu Feng would really be dead.

However, if Chu Feng were to really die like that, his death would be too much of an injustice.

“Lord Vice Hall Master.”

Right at that moment, a figure flew over rapidly. That person was a member of the Law Enforcement Hall.

“What is it?” Chu Xuanzhengfa asked.

“It’s the Nine Moons Sacred Domain. An abnormal sign has appeared in the sky above the Nine Moons Sacred Domain,” That person said.

“Abnormal sign? What sort of abnormal sign?” Chu Xuanzhengfa asked.

“Lightning has filled the sky above the Nine Moons Sacred Domain. It is like a descent of divine lightning,” that person said.

“Chu Feng! Father, it’s Chu Feng!” Chu Lingxi looked to Chu Xuanzhengfa with a joyous expression on her face.

Chu Xuanzhengfa also revealed a joyous expression. Then, without demur, Chu Xuanzhengfa brought Chu Lingxi with him and began to rapidly proceed toward the direction of the Nine Moons Sacred Domain.

Chu Zhiyuan’s grandfather and Chu Haoyan’s grandfather should have obtained this information too. The two of them arrived at the Nine Moons Sacred Domain before Chu Xuanzhengfa did.

The Nine Moons Sacred Domain had disappeared. The vast palace from before had returned to being a vast and boundless prairie. However, the sky above the boundless prairie was in complete unrest.

Lightning was moving about high up in the sky. They were like furious dragons that would soon descend from the sky to subdue monsters and extinguish evil.

“Father, it really is Chu Feng, it really is Chu Feng. This abnormal sign is the same as the time he made his breakthrough back then.”

“No, it’s slightly different. It is even stronger than before. The lightning seems to be even stronger this time.”

“This means that Chu Feng is making his breakthrough. Chu Feng is really still alive. He is still inside the Nine Moons Sacred Domain. Furthermore, he has obtained an opportunity that has allowed him to make a breakthrough,” Chu Lingxi was overjoyed. She was hopping in joy. Rarely did this young miss ever show such a side.

The reason why she was acting like that was because the lightning in the sky was very familiar to her. That was lightning that they’d never seen before Chu Feng. That was the tribulation lightning caused by his Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique.

While Chu Lingxi was feeling joyous, Chu Zhiyuan was frowning. He was panicking. Unable to contain himself, he looked to his grandfather.

“Grandfather,” Chu Zhiyuan quietly called.

“Zhiyuan, calm yourself,” Chu Zhiyuan’s grandfather ordered through a voice transmission.

“But, this abnormal sign is too much like the one Chu Feng caused that day. That is simply the abnormal sign from Chu Feng making a breakthrough,” Chu Zhiyuan said through a voice transmission. He was truly panicking. Even though he was sending a voice transmission, his panic was present in his trembling voice.

“It is most likely him. What is going on with that brat, how could he still be alive after falling into that lake?” Chu Zhiyuan’s grandfather also knew that the lightning was most likely caused by Chu Feng.

However, he was unable to understand how Chu Feng could still be alive after falling into the fiery lake. After all, he knew very well how frightening that lake’s waters were.

Not to mention Chu Feng, even a rank two Exalted expert like Chu Youyuan would undoubtedly be killed upon falling into that lake.

Furthermore, they were really unable to sense Chu Feng and Chu Youyuan’s auras after they fell into the lake. The two of them should be dead.

“Grandfather, what do we do? If they’re still alive, won’t our affair be exposed?”

“Lord Youyuan is someone Lord Clan Chief holds in high regard. Lord Clan Chief will definitely believe his words,” Chu Zhiyuan said.

“I said calm yourself. Not to mention that Chu Feng will not be able to come out, even if he did, he would have no means to prove that you and Ruoshi are lying,” Chu Zhiyuan’s grandfather said.

Seeing the confident expression on his grandfather’s face, Chu Zhiyuan’s panicky heart eased greatly.

“Rumble~~~”

Right at that moment, the Divine Tribulation’s lightning in the sky suddenly struck down. It struck directly onto the location of the Nine Moons Sacred Domain.

After the lightning struck, it immediately disappeared. Not a single person was injured.

However, the people knew that the Divine Tribulation’s lightning had entered the ground. This meant that... Chu Feng was truly still alive.
