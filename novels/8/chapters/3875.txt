“Heh...”

Right when the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints was intending to forcibly drag Chu Feng into the gate on the left, Chu Feng let out a cold sneer.

“I’ve long guessed that your cultivation is very powerful. Sure enough, I was right, you’re an Utmost Exalted.”

“However, I never would’ve expected that you would unleash your oppressive might against me whilst we’re allies,” Chu Feng’s voice was filled with mockery.

Hearing that, the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints felt rather ashamed.

“Brother Asura, I truly do not wish for you to throw your life away in vain.”

“The gate on the left will truly lead to death.”

“The YinYang Guidance Lamps will never be wrong," said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.

“Do I need you to determine my life and death?” asked Chu Feng.

“This... of course not. It’s just...” The Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints found himself at a loss as to how to explain things.

“Are you so certain that the gate on the left is the life gate? What if it’s the death gate?”

“I chose the right gate. Even if I am to die by doing so, I can assume full responsibility for it myself.”

“However, if you are to forcibly bring me into the left gate, you will have to shoulder the responsibility should I end up dying in there.”

“I ask you this, are you able to shoulder the responsibility of my life?” Chu Feng asked. His tone had become rather sharper.

The Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints was stunned after being questioned by Chu Feng.

“Huu~~~”

Then, the oppressive might that had restricted Chu Feng’s movement disappeared.

In the end, the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints retrieved his oppressive might.

“Brother Asura, it would appear that you’ve made your decision," said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.

“In that case, are you all willing to enter the right gate together with me?” asked Chu Feng.

The Mystic Cave Saints did not answer him. However, their silence had already given him their answer.

“In that case, why don’t you all wait here for a bit? If I don’t return after entering the gate, it would not be too late for you all to enter the left gate then," Chu Feng’s unyielding tone had softened.

He truly did not wish for the Mystic Cave Saints to die in vain.

Thus, he wanted to test things out with his own life, he wanted to gamble with his own life, to prove that his decision was correct. Once he proved that, he would then have the Mystic Cave Saints make their decision.

“Brother Asura, you must not enter that gate. That’s the death gate.”

“It doesn’t matter if you don’t believe in the YinYang Guidance Lamps...”

“How about this. All of you wait here first. I will enter the gate on the left.”

“I will go in and explore the path first. I will prove that the YinYang Guidance Lamps are not mistaken.”

As the Mystic Cave Saints’ Eldest spoke, he planned to walk towards the left gate.

He had the same idea as Chu Feng. He was also planning to test out the dangers with his own life.

Seeing that, Chu Feng was left speechless, and felt very uncomfortable.

He was able to tell that even though the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints was someone who regarded wealth as his life, he was actually also someone who dared to assume responsibility. Otherwise... he wouldn’t possibly be willing to use his own life to explore the left gate.

But, in Chu Feng’s eyes, the left gate was the death gate. He truly did not wish for the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints to throw away his life like that.

However, Chu Feng was unable to persuade him. The Mystic Cave Saints were simply firm in their belief that the YinYang Guidance Lamps would not be mistaken.

Chu Feng, on the other hand, firmly believed in himself.

“Wuuahh~~~”

However, before the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints could step into the left gate, Chu Feng’s body suddenly let out a sharp pain again.

At the same time, the Mystic Cave Saints also began to scream miserably in pain.

It was the talismans in their bodies. They had activated again. Furthermore, the impact of the talismans this time around was even stronger than last time.

Previously, the talismans were merely trying to torment them as a sign of warning.

As for this time around, the pain seemed fatal. Chu Feng and the Mystic Cave Saints were all able to tell that they could no longer delay.

If they did not make a choice quickly, the talismans could take their lives at any moment.

“Brother Asura, we brothers have said everything we needed to say. You insist on choosing the gate on the right. If you die, do not blame us.”

After saying those words, the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints stepped into the left gate without any hesitation.

“Brother Asura, you...”

The others from the Mystic Cave Saints all took a glance at Chu Feng, sighed, then hurriedly followed their eldest brother.

They did not dare to delay anymore because they knew that if they did not go in, they might end up dying at any moment.

Seeing the eleven Mystic Cave Saints all disappearing into the coffin on the left, Chu Feng shook his head helplessly.

As matters stood, what could he possibly do?

They were the ones that had chosen that path. Even if they died in the process, it was not Chu Feng’s responsibility.

Thus, Chu Feng stopped hesitating and, enduring the pain from the talismans, stepped into the right gate.

“Buzz~~~”

Passing through the spirit formation gate, the intense fiery sensation coming from the talismans in his body immediately ebbed.

The pain that had filled his body also disappeared.

However, even though the pain from the talismans had disappeared, Chu Feng did not feel any joy. Instead, his nerves were tensed.

He discovered that he had entered a mystical space.

He was still in the palace hall. However, he had entered a mystical space.

He was able to clearly witness everything in the palace hall. Yet, he was unable to move anything.

As if he was restricted, his body was simply unable to move. Only his eyes were able to move around.

“This feeling???”

Suddenly, Chu Feng’s expression changed enormously.

He felt an extremely terrifying aura emerging from all directions and sweeping towards him.

Following that, Chu Feng could see palms emerging from the void.

Countless palms were reaching for him, grabbing him, winding around him and covering his entire body.

At that moment, both the strange palms and the strange space brought an oppressive sensation to Chu Feng. That aura was able to make one crumble under its pressure.

It was the aura of death!!!

“Could it be, I was the one who made the wrong choice?”

Such a thought emerged in Chu Feng’s heart.
