Chapter 2952 - Helping Who, Exactly?

“Lord Utmost Exalted Elder, in the history of our Chu Heavenly Clan, only our Lord Ancestor managed to ascend to the eighth step of the Nine Levels Heavenly Lightning Steps.”

“You only want to test Chu Feng’s talent, yet you want him to ascend to the eighth step. Isn’t this a bit too...?” Chu Xuanzhengfa was frowning.

“A bit too what?”

“You wish to say that I’m making things a bit too difficult for Chu Feng, right?” Chu Hanpeng asked.

“Eh... Lord Utmost Exalted Elder, although it would be disrespectful for me to say it, but that is indeed the case. It is merely a test for his talent, there is simply no need for him to ascend to the eighth step, no?” Chu Xuanzhengfa said.

“If he were any other ordinary person, there would naturally be no need for him to ascend to the Heavenly Steps’ eighth step. However, is Chu Feng an ordinary person?” Chu Hanpeng asked.

Hearing those words, Chu Xuanzhengfa said no more. Strictly speaking, Chu Feng really could not be looked upon as an ordinary Chu Heavenly Clansman. After all, he was Chu Xuanyuan’s son.

Merely with that identity, he should not be considered among the ranks of ordinary Chu Heavenly Clansmen.

“I’ve said it already. Chu Feng needs to prove two things, both his talent and the fact that he is Chu Xuanyuan’s son.”

“Compared to the first aspect, the second aspect is even more important.”

“Otherwise, if any random person is to appear and declare himself to be Chu Xuanyuan’s son and wanted to receive our Chu Heavenly Clan’s inheritance, must we also accept him?” Chu Hanpeng said.

“What Lord Utmost Exalted Elder says is very correct. However, if we really wanted to prove Chu Feng to be Chu Xuanyuan’s son, wouldn’t it do for us to dispatch men down to the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm to ask Chu Xuanyuan about it?” Chu Xuanzhengfa asked.

“Did you think only you’re smart enough to think of that?” Chu Hanpeng said coldly.

“Eh....” Chu Xuanyuan didn’t know how to respond.

“When this old man left his closed-door training and found out about the matter, I immediately proceeded for the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm,” Chu Hanpeng said.

“Then, Lord Utmost Exalted Elder, could it be that Chu Xuanyuan did not give you an answer?” Chu Xuanzhengfa was somewhat worried.

He was afraid that Chu Xuanyuan, with his temperament, would refuse to even give Chu Hanpeng face. Should that be the case, the one to suffer would be Chu Feng.

“That Chu Xuanyuan has sealed away our Chu Heavenly Clan’s forbidden land in the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm. This old man was simply unable to meet him,” Chu Hanpeng said.

“That damned Chu Xuanyuan is simply too daring! He must be punished severely!”

“Lord Utmost Exalted Elder, this subordinate requests your approval to proceed to the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm to severely punish Chu Xuanyuan,” The Military Hall’s Hall Master said.

“The formation Chu Xuanyuan set up was something that not even this old man was capable of breaching. How could you possibly break through it?” Chu Hanpeng asked.

Hearing those words, the Military Hall’s Hall Master’s expression became very ugly.

It was not only him; the expressions of the two other Hall Masters and Chu Xuanzhengfa also changed.

Not even Chu Hanpeng could breach Chu Xuanyuan’s formation. This was sufficient to prove how powerful Chu Xuanyuan was.

“Furthermore, do not speak of taking care of Chu Xuanyuan again. Unless... you wish to end up like Chu Kongtong.”

When Chu Hanpeng said those words, he deliberately took a glance at the Military Hall, World Spirit Hall and Treasure Hall’s Hall Masters.

Hearing those words, the three Hall Masters’ bodies all trembled.

They naturally knew about what had happened to Chu Kongtong. Chu Kongtong had entered the Ancestral Lower Martial Realm and insulted the Old Ape who attended to Chu Xuanyuan, and ended up having his eyes dug out and his legs chopped off. Although his cultivation was not crippled, it had been decreasing continuously.

Most importantly, no one was capable of treating his lost eyes and legs. At present, Chu Kongtong had become a cripple.

Only a madman would want to end up like him.

“Lord Utmost Exalted Elder, are we to ignore Chu Xuanyuan like this then?” The Military Hall’s Hall Master asked.

“Heh...” At that moment, Chu Hanpeng chuckled. He said, “Did you really think that our Chu Heavenly Clan was capable of imprisoning Chu Xuanyuan?”

Once Chu Hanpeng said those words, the three Hall Masters’ expressions turned even uglier.

Chu Hanpeng’s words were simply too astonishing. For someone like him to say such words, he was simply admitting to the fact that the Chu Heavenly Clan was actually no match for Chu Xuanyuan.

“For certain things, there’s no need to say it too obviously. It would do for you all to know what’s going on in your hearts.”

“However, I will give you all this word of advice. Touch the dragon’s inverse scale, and you’ll end up dying. You all should know why Chu Xuanyuan did what he did back then.”

“Thus, even though you all possess grievances in your hearts, this old man must still advise you all to exercise restraint,” Chu Hanpeng continued.

Hearing those words, those three Hall Masters’ faces turned ashen.

However, Chu Xuanzhengfa was secretly delighted because of this.

Chu Xuanyuan ended up unleashing a massacre back then because of Chu Feng.

As for Chu Hanpeng, he had first declared that Chu Xuanyuan was extremely powerful, and not even the Chu Heavenly Clan could do anything about him.

Then, he declared Chu Feng to be Chu Xuanyuan’s inverse scale. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

He was clearly reminding the Military Hall, World Spirit Hall and Treasure Hall’s Hall Masters to not do anything to Chu Feng without first thinking of the consequences.

Otherwise, they’d end up like Chu Kongtong.

Chu Xuanzhengfa was perplexed precisely because of this. Wasn’t Chu Hanpeng not fond of Chu Xuanyuan? Wasn’t he the backer of the Military Hall?

Why would he be acting in such a manner today?

“In that case, Lord Utmost Exalted Elder, as long as Chu Feng ascends to the eighth step of the Nine Heavenly Lightning Steps, he will have proved himself to be Chu Xuanyuan’s son, right?” Chu Xuanzhengfa asked.

“That is what this old man thinks to be the case. What do you think?” Chu Hanpeng said.

“This junior also feels this to be feasible,” Chu Xuanzhengfa said.

“Since that’s the case, it’s settled. Immediately prepare the Nine Heavenly Lightnings Step and have Chu Feng climb it. If he is able to ascend to the eighth step, he shall stay. If he is unable to do so, he’ll have to scram.”

“You shall handle this matter. Do you have any objections?” Chu Hanpeng asked.

“Lord Utmost Exalted Elder, this junior will definitely handle the matter according to Lord Utmost Exalted Elder’s desire,” Chu Xuanzhengfa said.

After he finished saying those words, Chu Xuanzhengfa stood up and planned to leave.

“Wait,” However, right at that moment, the Military Hall’s Hall Master suddenly spoke. After he stopped Chu Xuanzhengfa from leaving, he turned to Chu Hanpeng, “Lord Utmost Exalted Elder, ignoring the matter regarding Chu Feng, this Chu Xuanzhengfa was disrespectful toward his seniors. Are we to just let him go like this? If the others from our Chu Heavenly Clan are to copy his behavior, wouldn’t we end up losing all rules and laws?”

“That’s right. Lord Utmost Exalted Elder, he absolutely cannot be forgiven like this,” The other two Hall Masters added.

Hearing those words, Chu Xuanzhengfa started to frown. Those three old men were truly unwilling to let him get away.

However, Chu Hanpeng’s expression did not change much after hearing the words spoken by the three Hall Masters. Calmly, he said, “Indeed, Chu Xuanzhengfa was disrespectful toward his seniors. However, have the three of you, as his subordinates, been respectful toward him?”

“This...”

Hearing those words, the three Hall Master’s faces immediately turned ashen.

Chu Xuanzhengfa was also stunned. Exactly who was Chu Hanpeng helping?
