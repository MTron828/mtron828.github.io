Chapter 3648 - Overflowing Killing Intent

“What happened?”

Witnessing such a thing, even Chu Feng’s expression changed.

Although that sword aura was not an extremely powerful offensive technique, it possessed the strength of a rank five Exalted.

The superiority in cultivation was absolutely not something that one’s opponent could make up for. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Regardless of how powerful one’s abilities might be, if one did not possess heaven-defying battle power, one would not be able to effortlessly block the attack of someone with a higher cultivation.

Currently, it was obvious that Nangong Yifan possessed a cultivation weaker than Wuming Yuanzhi. Yet, he was able to effortlessly disperse Wuming Yuanzhi’s sword aura.

“Something’s amiss!”

Soon, Chu Feng noticed that something was amiss.

Nangong Yifan’s aura had changed. At that moment, the aura that he emitted was no longer that of a rank four Exalted. Instead, it was that of a rank five Exalted.

Even though he had concealed his cultivation very well, and many of the people present did not detect it, Chu Feng was able to detect it.

“How could this be? How could this be?”

Wuming Yuanzhi had a look of bewilderment on his face. He did not detect that Nangong Yifan’s cultivation had changed.

Thus, he felt that Nangong Yifan had dispersed his rank five Exalted power with a rank four Exalted cultivation.

“Damn it!!!”

Suddenly, Wuming Yuanzhi shouted with rage and unreconciliation.

Following that, he raised his Incomplete Exalted Armament and planned to unleash another attack at Nangong Yifan.

“Woosh~~~”

Right at that moment, Nangong Yifan raised and opened his hand.

Once he did that, Wuming Yuanzhi was shot down from the sky. He sustained serious injuries, and was left in such a miserable state that even his Incomplete Exalted Armament fell to the ground.

“Exactly what is happening?”

Not to mention the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s younger generations, even the All-heaven Starfield’s younger generations were completely puzzled. They had no idea what was happening.

A rank four Exalted managed to easily defeat a rank five Exalted?

That was simply impossible according to their knowledge. It was also something that they had never witnessed before.

“Are you unable to comprehend what happened?”

“Since you all wish to know so much, I, Nangong Yifan, will tell you the truth.”

Suddenly, Nangong Yifan narrowed his brows. Following that, boundless power emerged from his body.

At that moment, an enormous image measuring over ten thousand meters in height appeared above Nangong Yifan.

It was an enormous buddha. The buddha appeared incomparably divine. Seeing it, one would feel a sort of reverence from the bottom of their heart.

After that giant buddha appeared, Nangong Yifan’s concealed rank five Exalted aura was also released.

At that moment, everyone came to a realization. It turned out that it was not that Nangong Yifan who was so heaven-defying that he could defeat a rank five Exalted Wuming Yuanzhi with a rank four Exalted cultivation.

Instead, he had used a sort of special ability to increase his cultivation.

“It’s our All-heaven Sect’s Secret Technique, All-heaven Buddha Body!”

“Indeed, that is the All-heaven Buddha-body, that is our All-heaven Buddha Body!”

“Never would I have imagined that Yifan actually managed to successfully cultivate the legendary All-heaven Buddha Body.”

The All-heaven Starfield’s younger generations became exceptionally excited.

From their excited voices, Chu Feng and the others learned of the ability Nangong Yifan had used.

The people from the All-heaven Sect all trained in a special mysterious technique since their youth. That mysterious technique was called the All-heaven Mysterious Technique.

The All-heaven Mysterious Technique was a secret technique. That secret technique was called the All-heaven Buddha Body.

That said, the All-heaven Buddha Body was very difficult to learn.

It was a legendary power.

Reportedly, in the entire All-heaven Starfield, only their current headmaster had grasped the technique.

Never had anyone imagined that Nangong Yifan had also managed to successfully learn the All-heaven Buddha Body.

This was also the reason why the All-heaven Starfield’s younger generations were so excited.

“Woosh~~~”

Right at that moment, Nangong Yifan’s body shifted. He started flying, and appeared before Wuming Yuanzhi in the next instant.

“Wuming Yuanzhi, do you now know how small and weak you are?”

Nangong Yifan was looking at Wuming Yuanzhi like a god looking down upon a mere mortal. His gaze was filled with arrogance and contempt.

“Heh....” Wuming Yuanzhi let out a faint laugh. Then, boundless martial power started to emit from his body. Like a tide, the boundless martial power surged toward Nangong Yifan.

The tide of martial power was emitting a strange aura. That was no ordinary martial power.

Even though Nangong Yifan was not beaten back by the boundless martial power tide, his movement was restricted by it.

That was a secret skill, a secret skill capable of momentarily binding Nangong Yifan.

“Crap! Yifan was careless.”

The All-heaven Starfield’s younger generations all revealed nervous expressions upon seeing that.

Even though Nangong Yifan’s battle power was much stronger than Wuming Yuanzhi’s, he was restricted by Wuming Yuanzhi. Like a target, he could only allow himself to be thrashed by Wuming Yuanzhi.

“Die!!!”

At that moment, Wuming Yuanzhi let out a furious shout. Then, he suddenly got up, raised his fist and smashed it explosively at Nangong Yifan’s face.

“Boom~~~”

The fist struck. The surrounding air started to tremble violently. However, Wuming Yuanzhi’s expression turned stiff.

Even though his fist had struck Nangong Yifan’s face, there was no damage to Nangong Yifan’s face at all.

Instead, it was Wuming Yuanzhi’s fist that was drenched with blood.

“You!!!” A shocked look filled Wuming Yuanzhi’s face.

“The All-heaven Buddha Body is of utmost toughness, utmost masculinity. Not only does it increase my cultivation, but it is also capable of protecting me. With it present, you will not be able to injure me with the bits of ability that you possess.”

“Although you’ve managed to increase your cultivation using your treasure, your bloodline power and your Divine Power, you’ve only managed to accomplish that with great difficulty. Thus, even though you’re also a rank five Exalted right now, our battle power is on completely different levels.”

“If battle power between same levels could differ by heaven and earth, then I would be standing in the heavens, and you would be buried deep in the earth.”

“Wuming Yuanzhi, this is the disparity between you and I. This is the truth that you will never be able to change in your life.”

Not only did Nangong Yifan have a mocking expression on his face, but his words were also extremely malicious. Each and every word from him was a personal insult toward Wuming Yuanzhi.

“Is that so?” Wuming Yuanzhi suddenly let out a sneer. Then, he opened his mouth and let out a giant spit at Nangong Yifan’s face.

Unprepared, Nangong Yifan was struck by Wuming Yuanzhi’s spit.

“Although I am unable to cause harm to your body, I can disgrace you.”

“Nangong Yifan, no matter how amazing you might be, you need to remember that this spit is an insult brought to you by your granddaddy Wuming Yuanzhi!” he said with a proud look. Then, he burst into a loud laugh.

Wuming Yuanzhi had realized that he was indeed no match for Nangong Yifan. However, that spit brought him great pleasure. He felt that even though he had lost to Nangong Yifan, he had not suffered a complete loss.

As for Nangong Yifan, he stood there completely dumbfounded.

He simply did not dare to believe what had just happened.

Even though Wuming Yuanzhi’s spit, like his martial power, was simply unable to cause him any harm, even though the spit was unable to even dirty his face, it remained that the spit had landed on his face.

This was the first time in Nangong Yifan’s life that someone had spit on his face.

What sort of humiliation was this?

Being spit on was something that ordinary people would find intolerable, much less someone as arrogant and conceited as Nangong Yifan.

“I’m going to kill you!!!”

Suddenly, a furious shout was heard. Nangong Yifan’s expression grew twisted. His eyes were even more terrifying than those of ferocious beasts. Furthermore, he was emitting boundlessing killing intent.

Nangong Yifan was not joking around. He was really planning to kill Wuming Yuanzhi. Furthermore, he had already sent a punch at Wuming Yuanzhi’s dantian.

If that punch landed, even if Wuming Yuanzhi survived, he would most definitely lose his cultivation.

“Woosh~~~”

However, at the moment of Wuming Yuanzhi’s imminent peril, a figure suddenly appeared between Wuming Yuanzhi and Nangong Yifan.

Like lightning, that person forcibly blocked Nangong Yifan’s killing-intent-filled fist with his hand.

“You’ll have to pass through me if you want to kill him.”

Following that, a gentle voice was heard.
