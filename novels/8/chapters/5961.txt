Chapter 5962: I Have to Intervene

Chu Feng had indeed entered the chess door.

While the death immunity token allowed him to conceal himself and teleport a short distance away, it had its restrictions too. For instance, he had to use one of his death immunity counts to trigger those effects.

Chu Feng had already triggered two death immunity counts thus far.

He was still concealed at the moment, but it was through his concealment formation, so the effects weren’t as potent.

He squatted on the ground with the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk in his hand and surveyed his surroundings while keeping up his vigilance.

“The earlier tremors... Is that one of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s means?”

Chu Feng was checking out the cause of the earlier tremors. It had happened out of the blue, and it encompassed a vast area, which led him to deduce that the tremors were not as simple as they seemed.

However, his capability was limited, so he couldn’t discern the origin or the cause of the tremors.

Thus, he stood up and looked at the entrance.

Those from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion should have figured out by now that he had entered the chess door, but none of them chased after him. It was as if they were intentionally leaving him be.

“It looks like the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion has prepared a hand?” Chu Feng murmured with a faint smile.

He had no way to figure out what the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion was up to, so he proceeded carefully despite having the death immunity token in his possession.

Jie Tian was right about one thing. He might have the death immunity token, but there was a limit to how many times it could protect him.

...

As Chu Feng ventured deeper, he realized that the area inside the chess door was ridiculously large. It comprised an entire underground city, and he couldn’t tell how deep it ran.

It didn’t take him long to encounter other world spiritists. These world spiritists spent much of their time here, and there were even a few who chose to cultivate here. Thus, they were initially oblivious to what had happened outside, and they didn’t know about Chu Feng’s arrival either.

Chu Feng also paid no heed to them, though he would occasionally eavesdrop whenever they were on a topic that interested him.

He observed his surroundings while venturing ahead in search of clues. He wanted to confirm the deciphering method.

While he was deciphering the entrance of the chess door, he already had a clue as to how this remnant had to be breached.

First and foremost, the area inside the chess door was humongous. There were thousands of paths and tens of thousands of formations.

The way to clear it was simple—he had to pick a hundred formations out of the tens of thousands of formations to decipher. However, they had to be deciphered in the correct sequence.

The more correct his sequence of deciphering was, the deeper he could venture down the path. If his sequence of deciphering was completely correct, he would be able to reach the innermost depth of the remnant.

But even if he reached the innermost depth, that didn’t mean that he would necessarily obtain the treasure here. There was still one last gate standing in his path, and he would have to offer his life as a tribute to open the gate.

The correct sequence lay not just in the chess door but also in the chess door's entrance formation.

Of course, the sequence was hidden very discreetly, such that normal world spiritists wouldn’t even notice them. However, it was a walk in the park for Chu Feng. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Chu Feng realized that the formations here imitated Qin Jiu’s formation construction method. While Chu Feng’s spirit power was still lacking, he was still Qin Jiu’s legitimate successor. That helped him greatly in deciphering the formations here, to the extent that it even compensated for his lacking spirit power.

That being said, it would still take him some time to decipher the formations.

Even though he had already obtained the sequence, he wanted to first verify it.

Soon, he found a clue. It was a vague clue, but it hinted at the method he employed to obtain the correct sequence from the chess door’s entrance formation. This made him certain that he was on the right path.

What he had to do now was to decipher the formations based on the sequence he had found, but there was just one last problem left—time.

While Chu Feng could use Qin Jiu’s formation deciphering method to compensate for the gap in his spirit power, that didn’t mean that he was invincible here. Of the hundred formations he had to decipher, some were easy, but some were extremely difficult.

He estimated that he would need a month to decipher all hundred formations, but the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion would have already brought in a huge army of reinforcements by then.

But since he was already here, he didn’t plan to give up on it easily. Risk and reward came hand in hand, after all.

He would persevere unless he depleted all of the death immunity counts in his death immunity token.

While he was venturing deeper, he suddenly heard a commotion. There was a fight ahead, but it was not particularly surprising for people to fight in a place like this.

Chu Feng chose to ignore the matter and continue his plan.

Half a day passed in a flash, and he had already deciphered three formations.

While he was making his way toward the fourth formation, he stumbled upon three world spiritists chasing after a woman. He initially didn’t want to get involved in it, but that woman’s appearance caught his attention.

That woman had a fiery figure but an innocent face, which stoked a strong desire to protect her. She had eight whiskers growing out of where her ears should have been, and the tip of these whiskers contained a formation. This suggested that she was a monstrous beast, and probably a special one at that.

“The Spiritualist Sacred Clan?”

Chu Feng hadn’t conversed with anyone since entering the chess door, but he had gathered quite some information from eavesdropping on the people here.

Many years ago, a peculiar monstrous clan appeared inside the chess door—the Spiritualist Sacred Clan.

The Spiritualist Sacred Clan possessed extraordinary senses. While it was often said that monstrous beast world spiritists were less talented than human world spiritists, the Spiritualist Sacred Clansmen were innately talented world spiritists.

Every one of their clansmen was born with psyche, and their bodies harnessed formations.

Currently, the one who was most likely to clear the chess door was the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. It was rumored that Jie Tianran and Jie Ranqing had long reached the final stage of the remnant, but they chose not to open the final door for some reason.

The crowd speculated that they weren’t confident in themselves, since the door demanded they paid with their lives. Unless they were confident, there was a chance they could drop dead.

The second likeliest candidate to clear the remnant was the Spiritualist Sacred Clan. Their ability to decipher formations was outstanding, but some of their clansmen weren’t too powerful in terms of their spirit power.

Due to that, there were scheming people who exploited every opportunity to capture the Spiritualist Sacred Clansmen to use them to decipher the formations.

Right now, three world spiritists were trying to capture a woman from the Spiritualist Sacred Clan to have her decipher formations in their stead.

This woman was already wounded. If no one stood forward to help her, it was only a matter of time before she was caught.

“It looks like I have no choice but to get involved,” Chu Feng murmured with a helpless smile.
