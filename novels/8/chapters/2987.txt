Chapter 2987 - Challenging The Highest Level

“Mother, rest assured. With little brother Chu Feng and I working together, we will definitely be able to acquire good records.”

“Although little brother Chu Feng currently does not possess sufficient backing in the clan, and is surrounded by danger, I believe that he will be able to rise in power. I will continue to stay by his side,” Chu Yue spoke with a determined expression.

“Very well. Yue’er, you must take care of Chu Feng. At the very least, you must do what an older sister should do.” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Trust your mother. Befriending Chu Feng is definitely the most correct path that you’ve ever taken,” Chu Yue’s mother grabbed Chu Yue’s shoulder and spoke with a very serious expression on her face.

The reason why Chu Yue’s mother said those words to Chu Yue was because she had personally witnessed what had happened to the people that had befriended Chu Xuanyuan. They were clearly people with ordinary talent. Yet, because of Chu Xuanyuan’s assistance, they gained instant success.

Back then, she was foolish and missed that opportunity. However, she hoped for her daughter Chu Yue to not miss the opportunity that she had missed. Moreover, Chu Yue currently had such a great opportunity.

Hearing what her mother said, Chu Yue smiled sweetly. Then, she nodded heavily.

Seeing Chu Yue’s response, Chu Yue’s mother finally revealed a satisfied smile.

As long as Chu Yue could grasp this opportunity to befriend Chu Feng, it would not only be Chu Yue; even she would gain greater success by association.

This was what the world of martial cultivators was like. Each martial cultivator was a tree. When they were a sapling, it would be difficult to determine how vast of a tree they would grow into. However, one day, the saplings would differentiate themselves in size.

For some people, they would forever remain mediocre. They would become trees that would end up being cut in half by a burst of wind.

For some other people, they were destined to become giant, heaven-reaching trees. Even the light emitted by the sun and the moon would be covered by them.

The people that managed to be underneath such an enormous heaven-reaching tree would be absolutely safe.

Chu Yue’s mother felt that Chu Feng was one such heaven-reaching tree. As for the reason for that, it was none other than because Chu Feng was Chu Xuanyuan’s son.

......

After this, Chu Yue arrived at Chu Feng’s residence with the materials for the Yin Yang Fate Pearls.

The two of them immediately began attempting to awaken and refine their Yin Yang Fate Pearls. As Chu Feng was an Exalted-cloak World Spiritist, he quickly gained an understanding of the Yin Yang Fate Pearls.

Firstly, within each Yin Yang Fate Pearl were two different powers - the power of yin and the power of yang.

If one were to focus on increasing the strength of a single power, one would make more progress.

For example, one could focus on increasing the yang power for one Yin Yang Fate Pearl and the yin power for the other.

That was the reason why it would be more effective for two Yin Yang Fate Pearls to be strengthened together.

Time passed very quickly. In the blink of an eye, it was only a day away from the opening of the Nine Moons Sacred Domain.

During this period of time, all sorts of news was spreading about nonstop.

Some people reported that Chu Haoyan had managed to refine his Yin Yang Fate Pearl to the Macrostar level on the first day.

And at present, there were reports of Chu Ruoshi and her sweetheart Chu Zhiyuan successfully refining their Yin Yang Fate Pearls to the Half-moon level.

That said, those were all rumors. No one knew exactly what the truth was.

That said, when Chu Feng and Chu Yue placed their Yin Yang Fate Pearls together, the auras within them would change. An enormous moon would appear in both Yin Yang Fate Pearls.

“Heavens! Could this be the legendary Full Moon?!”

Seeing the full moons in the Yin Yang Fate Pearls, Chu Yue’s eyes were opened extremely wide. She simply did not dare to believe her eyes.

From weak to strong, the Yin Yang Fate Pearls were separated into the Microstar, Macrostar, Half-moon, Full Moon and Sun-moon levels.

Generally speaking, being able to awaken one’s Yin Yang Fate Pearl to the Macrostar level was already extremely outstanding. As for the Half-moon level, only three pairs were ever able to accomplish that in the Chu Heavenly Clan’s history.

As for the Full Moon, it was something that no one in the Chu Heavenly Clan had ever accomplished.

In other words, Chu Feng and Chu Yue would become the first pair in the Chu Heavenly Clan’s history to awaken their Yin Yang Fate Pearls to the Full Moon level. With this, how could Chu Yue not be excited?

Suddenly, Chu Feng said, “Big sis Chu Yue, I have an idea in mind.”

“What is it?” Chu Yue asked.

“Do not do anything, let me handle both Yin Yang Fate Pearls,” Chu Feng said.

“Okay,” Although Chu Yue didn’t understand what Chu Feng was planning, she still nodded.

She firmly trusted Chu Feng. The reason for that was because she knew very well that it was all thanks to Chu Feng’s efforts that they were able to reach the Full Moon level. She was merely a very small helper, someone who was simply nonessential to the process.

Chu Feng began to control the two Yin Yang Fate Pearls simultaneously. One of the Yin Yang Fate Pearls started to release its aura, while the other started to accept it. Chu Feng was actually instilling all of the power that he had condensed into his Yin Yang Fate Pearl over the course of two days into Chu Yue’s Yin Yang Fate Pearl.

In other words, Chu Feng’s Yin Yang Fate Pearl had become an empty Yin Yang Fate Pearl.

As for Chu Yue’s Yin Yang Fate Pearl, it contained sufficient power to reach the Full Moon level all by itself.

“Little brother Chu Feng, what are you doing?” Chu Yue looked to the Full Moon-level Yin Yang Fate Pearl in her hand in a very astonished manner.

“I wish to challenge that highest-level Yin Yang Fate Pearl,” Chu Feng said.

“Little brother Chu Feng, you’re talking about the Sun-moon level?” Chu Yue was very shocked.

“That’s right,” Chu Feng nodded.

Hearing those words, the shock that covered Chu Yue’s face turned into one of utter astonishment. She was truly incapable of remaining calm.

Before, she had never even thought about the Full Moon level. However, never would she have expected Chu Feng’s goal to actually be the Sun-moon level.

“If I want to challenge the Sun-moon level Yin Yang Fate Pearl, I must remove all of the power I gathered before.”

“However, I am unable to be certain as to whether or not I can succeed. As such, I decided to instill all of the power within my Yin Yang Fate Pearl into yours.”

“Like that, even if I am to fail, it would do no harm,” Chu Feng said.

“So that’s the case. Little brother Chu Feng, you are truly amazing. For ordinary people, being able to awaken their Yin Yang Fate Pearls to the Full Moon level is already an extremely astonishing feat. Yet you still want to challenge the Sun-moon level,” Chu Yue said.

“Life is a challenge. We cannot be satisfied with only what’s before us,” Chu Feng said with a faint smile.

“Right, little brother Chu Feng is very correct.”

“In that case, little brother Chu Feng, do you need my assistance in challenging the Sun-moon level Yin Yang Fate Pearl?” Chu Yue asked.

“Your Yin Yang Fate Pearl is already at the Full Moon level by itself. It would be very difficult for it to unleash its power again. Thus, it’s simply impossible for you to help me. Big sis Chu Yue, you can return first. It would do for me to take care of the rest myself,” Chu Feng said.

“Since that’s the case, I will not bother little brother Chu Feng then,” Chu Yue smiled sweetly. Then, she turned around and left.

However, after Chu Yue left, Her Lady Queen suddenly spoke out, “Chu Feng, why am I feeling that Chu Yue’s smile to be somewhat abnormal?”

“Eggy, you noticed it too?” Chu Feng asked.

“To be exact, this Queen has felt her behavior to be quite abnormal for the past two days. I was afraid that you would think I’m overthinking things, that’s why I didn’t mention it to you,” Her Lady Queen said.

“I’ve also noticed it. During this period of time, Chu Yue has not asked what she should be asking, but kept asking about things that she shouldn’t be asking. I keep feeling like she’s scheming something. I don’t know if I’m overthinking things,” Chu Feng said.

“Of course you’re not overthinking things. This Queen felt it too,” Her Lady Queen said.

“Eh...” Chu Feng felt a bit speechless.

“You fool! Since you discovered her abnormal behavior, why would you hand the Full Moon Yin Yang Fate Pearl that you’ve painstakingly attained to her Yin Yang Fate Pearl? Aren’t you afraid that she will refuse to harmonize it with your Yin Yang Fate Pearl when the time comes?” Her Lady Queen asked angrily.

“Why would I be afraid? It’s merely the Full Moon level. My goal is the Sun-moon level,” Chu Feng said.

“In that case, what percentage of certainty do you have in being able to successfully reach the Sun-moon level?” Her Lady Queen asked.

“Before reaching the Full Moon level, I only had thirty percent certainty of success.”

“However now, after reaching the Full Moon level, my Yin Yang Fate Pearl has undergone a foundational transformation.”

“Using this Yin Yang Fate Pearl to attempt awakening again, I dare to say...”

“... I have complete certainty of success,” Chu Feng said.
