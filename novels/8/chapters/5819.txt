Chapter 5819: Qiang Qiang Qiang Qiang Mansion

Chapter 5819: Qiang Qiang Qiang Qiang Mansion

Long Chengyu and Qin Xuan were prodigies whose names were spoken alongside Xianhai Shaoyu, Ling Xiao, and the others back then, but they were the only ones who weren’t able to enter the Immemorial Land of Dao Creation.

This vexed them.

“Maybe we’re lacking something,” Long Chengyu remarked.

While he didn’t want to put down his older sister, his talent was indeed higher than Long Muxi’s. If Long Muxi could enter the Immemorial Land of Dao Creation, what he and Qin Xuan lacked was not just talent.

Just then, there was a flicker of light, and the golden door opened.

Qin Xuan and Long Chengyu were overjoyed, as they thought that they had just been deemed qualified to enter the Immemorial Land of Dao Creation. However, a person soon emerged from the golden door—Long Muxi.

It was not that they had been deemed qualified, but Long Muxi had simply come out. She wasn’t in a good condition; she was struggling to even maintain flight.

Long Chengyu was worried, but there was nothing he could do. He could only wait till she retreated to their vicinity before he could rush forward to support her.

“What’s wrong, big sister?”

“I’m fine, but the Immemorial Land of Dao Creation isn’t for anyone.” Long Muxi shook her head bitterly.

She was unable to withstand the energy inside and had no choice but to leave.

“What about Chu Feng and the others?” Qin Xuan asked. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“They should be able to succeed.” Long Muxi didn’t elaborate any further, but she recalled what she had witnessed inside the Immemorial Land of Dao Creation.

There, she saw different people trying to adapt to different powers. They were all top prodigies of the world of cultivation, but even they were divided into different tiers.

She had known that her talent was lacking, but it was still painful for her to see others easily accessing areas she struggled to step into. She couldn’t even withstand the weakest energy inside the Immemorial Land of Dao Creation, but Chu Feng and Xianhai Yu’er were perfectly relaxed despite standing amidst the most terrifying energies there.

...

As time passed, Little Fishy, Xianhai Shaoyu, and Wang Qiang’s buildings began to take shape. Their progress was surprisingly close. In contrast, Chu Feng was much slower despite being the first one to begin construction.

Meanwhile, Feng Ling, Ling Xiao, Jie Baobao, Xian Miaomiao, and Yuwen Yanri had found the energies most suitable to them and had begun constructing their buildings.

Weng!

There was a sudden flash of light.

Everyone halted their construction to look in Little Fishy’s direction. The light was coming from her building. She had completed her construction.

All of them had been constructing the same simple house, but Little Fishy’s house began to transform under the brilliant light. It morphed into a mansion ten times larger. Its walls were pink, and it was shrouded in a flowing pink light reminiscent of flowing waves.

The mansion was not exactly majestic, but it went well with Little Fishy’s disposition.

None of the other buildings they had seen in the Immemorial Land of Dao Creation were shrouded in light, making them feel heavy and dead. In contrast, Little Fishy’s mansion felt vibrant.

Just then, a deep voice echoed, “Please name your Dao Creation Building.”

The voice sounded as if it had come from a far distance away, transcending even space. It was hard to tell whether it was from a formation or a real person.

“Immortal Sea Mansion,” Little Fishy replied right away.

The words ‘Immortal Sea Mansion’ appeared on the plaque hanging on Little Fishy’s mansion.

“You have two hours. You have to tame your Dao Creation Building within the time limit, or else you’ll be deemed to have failed, and you’ll be evicted from this land,” the deep voice echoed.

Little Fishy’s Immortal Sea Mansion began to shake. Even the pink light shrouding it wavered, looking as if it would scatter at any moment.

Little Fishy quickly formed a hand seal in an attempt to control her Dao Creation Building.

“So, the structures we’re building are called Dao Creation Buildings, and we’ll have to tame it to succeed in our dao creation. I’m guessing the other Dao Creation Buildings floating around us are the remains of those who had failed before us.”

Even with their limited vision, they could spot many buildings floating around them. There were probably even more buildings around.

This suggested many people had entered the Immemorial Land of Dao Creation in the Ancient Era or even the Immemorial Era, though it had become extremely difficult to enter this place in the present era. Even so, most people still eventually failed in their dao creation, or else there wouldn’t have been so many Dao Creation Buildings left behind.

Soon, Xianhai Shaoyu completed his Dao Creation Building as well. It was shaped like a mansion too, though it was slightly larger than Little Fishy’s. Its walls were blue, and the light shrouding it felt like waves.

At a glance, it looked like a mansion in the sea.

“Please name your Dao Creation Building,” the deep voice echoed.

“Shaoyu Mansion,” Xianhai Shaoyu replied right away.

The words ‘Shaoyu Mansion’ appeared on the mansion’s plaque. Xianhai Shaoyu immediately began taming the mansion. Even if he had succeeded in the construction, it would be futile if he failed to tame it in the end.

Soon, Wang Qiang completed his Dao Creation Building too. It was a dark purple mansion, and it was shrouded in a dark purple light. It felt very different from Xianhai Shaoyu and Little Fishy’s buildings.

Little Fishy’s mansion felt feminine, and Xianhai Shaoyu’s mansion felt majestic and graceful. While their mansions were different in terms of aesthetics, they gave off an air of vibrancy.

In contrast, Wang Qiang’s mansion felt dark. However, the crowd paid it no heed and instead celebrated his success.

“Please name your Dao Creation Building,” the deep voice echoed.

“Brother S-S-Shaoyu used his name for his mansion. I l-l-like that. I’ll do the s-s-same as well! My Dao Creation Building shall be called Q-Q-Q-Qiang Mansion!”

Five words appeared on his Dao Creation Mansion’s plaque—Qiang Qiang Qiang Qiang Mansion.

“Bloody hell! It’s Qiang Mansion, not Qiang Qiang Qiang Qiang Mansion! Y-y-you got it wrong!” Wang Qiang anxiously tried to correct it, but there was no response whatsoever. “What the hell!”

Wang Qiang was frustrated, but what was done was done. He had no choice but to proceed to tame his Dao Creation Building, or else he might just fail in his dao creation.
