Chapter 4195 - Truly Shameless

“Menglu is my woman. You’d best keep your distance from her from now on,” Xiao Yu ordered as he hugged Zhao Menglu.

Pride and arrogance filled his face. However, it was laughable that he also had a slight look of panic.

Seeing Xiao Yu like that, Chu Feng was unable to contain himself, and burst out laughing.

Even though those people were hundreds of years older than him, their mentality and cultivations all seemed to be much weaker.

Because of that, Chu Feng didn’t want to bicker with them either.

He said, “Don’t tell me that. It’s your woman who came to bother me on a daily basis. Thus, you should control your own woman properly. If you could contain her, I wouldn’t bother to bicker with you about this matter either.”

After saying those words, Chu Feng began walking away whilst holding the fruit in his hand up high.

Unfortunately, people all have their pride. Chu Feng’s words had clearly hurt Zhao Menglu’s ego.

She was clearly very scared of Chu Feng. Yet, she suddenly grew courageous.

“Chu Feng, if it wasn’t for the Golden Crane True Immortal, do you really think I’d make soup and dimsum for you?”

“You’ve tried to grope me every day, tried to court my favor the entire time. When did I bother to pay attention to any of that?” Zhao Menglu said as she pointed her finger at Chu Feng.

“What?! He tried to grope you?!”

Anger surged on Xiao Yu’s face upon hearing those words.

Even the others were surprised.

After all, Chu Feng didn’t seem to be that sort of person.

“Big brother Xiao Yu, that’s right. He even tried to push me down.”

“If it wasn’t for the fact that I vowed to rather die than obey, he might’ve succeeded.”

Zhao Menglu had actually begun crying. With tears flowing down her face, she truly looked like she had been wronged enormously.

Hearing Zhao Menglu’s words, even Chu Feng had a look of great surprise.

Over the five days he’d been there, Zhao Menglu had been trying to push herself onto him the entire time. If it wasn’t for him keeping his distance and refusing her repeatedly, Zhao Menglu would’ve stripped down for him already.

Why would she suddenly turn everything around at that moment?

How could she even say such things?

Was this not a deliberate distortion of the truth?

“He even dared try to push you down?! Even I, Xiao Yu, have not touched you!”

Xiao Yu was so furious that his face turned deep red as he gnashed his teeth with rage.

“Big brother Xiao Yu, you have no idea how much this Chu Feng wanted me.”

“I told him that I like to eat fruit. Look... didn’t he go out to pick fruit for me?” said Zhao Menglu as she pointed at the fruit in Chu Feng’s hand.

“That’s true!”

Xiao Yu and the others present all took Zhao Menglu’s words to be true after seeing the fruit that Chu Feng held in his hand.

“I am truly fucking being wronged here.”

Chu Feng didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.

He had clearly gone out to pick the fruits because he had discovered that they were capable of aiding the unsealing of his cultivation.

Why would it turn into him picking fruit for Zhao Menglu?

How shameless could the woman be?

She had completely changed Chu Feng’s opinion of her.

“Chu Feng, stop bothering me in the future! I truly do not like you!”

“What I told big brother Xiao Yu earlier is what I truly feel.”

“But, as this is a matter between us of the younger generation, it should be settled amongst ourselves. If you’re a man, do not tell Lord Golden Crane and the others,” Zhao Menglu said to Chu Feng as she continued crying.

Hearing those words, Chu Feng truly had no idea if he should laugh or cry.

Zhao Menglu had inverted the truth and was tainting his image. Yet, she still didn’t want him to tell the Golden Crane True Immortal about it.

She was truly a schemer.

Unfortunately, she belonged to the stupid schemer type.

Chu Feng had no intention of telling the Golden Crane True Immortal about the matter.

However, he could not tolerate her tainting his image.

Because of that, Chu Feng waved his sleeve and revealed his wrist.

On his wrist was a bracelet emitting a red radiance. The bracelet was very pretty.

When she saw the bracelet, Zhao Menglu’s face turned green.

The reason for that was because that bracelet was something that she had meticulously prepared and gifted to Chu Feng.

Chu Feng had originally refused to accept it. But, Zhao Menglu had insisted that the bracelet would be able to accelerate the speed at which his cultivation recovered, and had urged him to put it on.

That was the reason why Chu Feng had accepted the bracelet.

“Miss Menglu, you said I was the one bothering you nonstop, that I wanted to push you down by force. In that case, what is your explanation for this bracelet?”

“You’d best not tell me this bracelet is something that I forcibly snatched away from you. If I snatched it away by force, how come your aura’s still on it?”

As Chu Feng spoke, he touched the bracelet with his finger. Then, the bracelet began to radiate with light. With that, Zhao Menglu’s silhouette appeared from the bracelet.

It was a spirit formation, yet it was very life-like.

The spirit formation was not only something that Zhao Menglu had set up on her own, she had also been the one to infuse her aura into the spirit formation.

Most importantly, the Zhao Menglu formed by the spirit formation was wearing very little. Furthermore, she was capable of speech.

“Little brother Chu Feng, you must make sure to eat the dimsum I made for you~ Don’t be afraid of eating all of them, because I’ll be sending more over every day. Besides that, you’ve looked very tired these past days. Remember to rest well.”

After saying those words, the spirit formation image smiled sweetly. Her smile was especially charming.

Zhao Menglu’s silhouette only disappeared after smiling.

Seeing the spirit formation, Xiao Yu and the others all held a new opinion of Zhao Menglu.

The spirit formation was simply one that was meant to seduce Chu Feng.

With things having reached this point, there was no need for more words, as the truth had been revealed.

It was not Chu Feng that had been bothering Zhao Menglu nonstop. Rather, it was the other way around.

“Menglu, what exactly is the meaning of this?”

“That spirit formation has your aura. You’d best not tell me that it wasn’t done by you.”

Xiao Yu’s face had turned deep red. Angry fumes were pouring from his seven facial orifices.

Likely, even his heart, liver, spleen, lungs and kidneys were about to explode.

“I... this is because of my grandpa. My grandpa was the one who forced me to do that.”

“I didn’t want to do it either.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Wuuu~~~”

Zhao Menglu was unable to counter the evidence. She crouched down and began crying bitterly.

However, all the people present knew Zhao Menglu’s grandpa well.

Whilst her grandpa was someone that might force Zhao Menglu to get close to Chu Feng and take care of him, he would definitely not force her to indulge in such trickery.

“Motherfucker! You damned bastard! I’ll beat you to death!”

Surprisingly, attacked by rage, Xiao Yu actually turned his anger towards Chu Feng.

That was understandable. After all, he liked Zhao Menglu too much.

Even if he had been angered by her, he was unable to attack her.

It was akin to how a man loved a woman, but the woman instead loved another man.

Unable to obtain the woman he loved, that man would naturally be furious. But, although he might be furious, he would not turn his anger to the woman he loved. Instead, he would teach the man his woman loved a lesson instead.

Although it was very irrational behavior, some men just so happened to be irrational.

As for Xiao Yu, he was one such man.

In the blink of an eye, Xiao Yu arrived before Chu Feng.

He raised his hand and smashed it towards Chu Feng’s face.

But then, he stopped.

Then he changed the direction of his fist. Aiming for Chu Feng’s abdomen instead, he smashed his fist forward.

Seeing that, Chu Feng smiled.

He knew why Xiao Yu had hesitated. Likely, he was afraid that if he were to injure Chu Feng’s face, the Golden Crane True Immortal would notice it.

“Bang---”

Right at that moment, Xiao Yu’s fist struck Chu Feng’s abdomen.

Due to the fact that Chu Feng’s cultivation was still sealed, he was sent flying several hundred meters away.

Of course, although his cultivation hadn’t recovered, his body remained extremely tough.

Because of that, Chu Feng only looked miserable after being struck by Xiao Yu’s punch, but was actually completely uninjured.
