Chapter 4605: A Maneating Demoness

A certain part of the Incubation Forest had been severed off by a barrier. It was impossible to see or hear anything from the inside, but if one could pass through the barrier to take a close look, one would hear heart-wrenching screams.

But if one were to see the face of the one who had just screamed, one would surely be shocked.

That was because he was no other than the famed young prodigy of the world spiritists, Yin Tianchou.

At this very moment, his body was filled with bloodied lacerations. They were marks from a whip.

Pah!

All of a sudden, a whip sloshed across the air at a speed that was surprisingly not very fast. Yet, Yin Tianshou was still unable to dodge it. The whip struck an uninjured part of his body accurately, ripping his skin open and revealing his flesh.

The sheer pain from the strike induced another scream from Yin Tianchou’s mouth.

An incongruously gentle voice sounded in this hellish situation, “How is it? Is it comfortable?”

The one who spoke was Song Yun. With a whip in her hand, she gazed down at Yin Tianchou with a smile on her lips.

“Who in the world are you? It should be impossible to use martial power in here, so how is it that you are able to do so?!”

Yin Tianchou stared at Song Yun with horror in his eyes.

He was able to tell that there was a peculiar relationship between Chu Feng and Song Yun, so he was planning to first curb the two of them before taking advantage of Song Yun before Chu Feng. There was nothing more humiliating to a man than to be forced to watch helplessly as the woman he loved was taken by another man.

He thought that this would be the perfect vengeance against Chu Feng.

Yet, who could have thought that his plan would be all ruined before he could even make a move at all?

The person whom he thought as an innocent white rabbit turned out to be a demon from hell.

Song Yun’s strength was already at Martial Exalted level. Putting him aside, even the three prodigies of the Songsun Clan wouldn’t be a match for her!

But what left Yin Tianchou the most confused was that the entire Incubation Forest was shrouded in the Wretched Demon’s power, such that it was impossible for one to exert martial power here. Yet, he could clearly sense that Song Yun’s attacks were imbued with spirit power, not martial power.

This made Yin Tianchou realize that the lady standing before him was of far greater standing than he could imagine.

“I’m surprised that you’re still able to speak. Looks like I haven’t gone hard enough.”

Song Yun chuckled softly to herself before flicking her wrist powerfully. Thorns began to protrude from the whip in her grasp.

This sight turned Yin Tianchou’s face pale in horror.

Not daring to hesitate in the least, he immediately kneeled on the floor and began begging Song Yun for mercy, “Young miss, I have done wrong. I was just joking! All I wanted to do was to teach that fellow a lesson. I promise that I have no intention of doing anything to you.”

“You were planning to teach him a lesson? Are you saying that a trash like you is qualified to teach my big brother Chu Feng a lesson?”

Yin Tianchou would have never imagined that his words would only land him deeper into trouble, as the sweet face of the young lady standing before him grew a little darker.

Song Yun flicked her wrist, and the whip in her grasp darted for Yin Tianchou as if a venomous serpent.

Knowing that the situation was really bad for him, Yin Tianchou swiftly got back up to his feet and fled away. However, his efforts were futile. No matter where he ran, the whip seemed to be able to trace his location, not to mention that he wasn’t fast enough to outrun the whip too.

The whip landed squarely on Yin Tianchou’s body, and with a swift tug of the whip, the thorns tore out a horrifyingly large chunk of flesh from him. Some of his bones were even fractured by the impact too.

Yin Tianchou fell to the ground and hissed sharply in pain. The attack wasn’t just a physical one. It had hurt his soul as well.

However, things were just barely getting started. Song Yun flicked her wrist once more, and the whip continued lashing at Yin Tianchou.

In just a few strikes, Yin Tianchou was already turned into a bloody mess, such that hardly anyone could recognize him anymore. At this rate, he might just get beaten to death!”

“Shit, you demoness! If I were to die today, I shan’t allow you to live either!”

With a furious roar, Yin Tianchou raised his hand, and a surge of light suddenly darted toward Song Yun.

In response, Song Yun sneered coldly and stepped aside, dodging the surge of light.

Weng!

But unexpectedly, the surge of light suddenly began expanding, encompassing an area of tens of thousands of meters in the blink of an eye. It covered Chu Feng, Song Yun, Yin Tianchou, and a huge plot of the forest.

This surge of light didn’t hurt Song Yun, but it emanated a bizarre surge of energy that melded into the Divine Rejuvenation Pearl in Song Yun’s hand. Following that, the light began giving off the aura of the Divine Rejuvenation Pearl as well.

“A formation?”

It was then that Song Yun realized what was going on.

“Ki ki ki! Divine Rejuvenation Pearl, Divine Rejuvenation Pearl!!!”

A deafening bellow suddenly sounded from the depths of the ground. The earth began to tremor, causing massive trees to collapse to the ground. Dirt was rising out from the land beneath.

A massive creature burrowed its way out from the ground.

It was a black creature with tentacles lashing all around its body.

Be it in terms of form or aura, it carried an uncanny resemblance to the monster inside the world of the Divine Rejuvenation Pearl. However, judging from the aura itself, this massive creature seemed to be much more powerful.

From the moment it rose from the ground, the scent of death began suffusing around the area.

“Hahaha, it has appeared! This is the Dark Demon protecting the Divine Rejuvenation Pearl. Demoness, you didn’t expect this, right? Did you honestly think that the dangers of the pearl was just limited to the world inside it?

“You’re wrong! There’s still the Dark Demon camping in the vicinity of the pearl too! The Dark Demon would usually lurk beneath the pearl in a gaseous state, making it impossible to sense it. However, as soon as the true pearl makes its appearance, the Dark Demon would emerge as well.

“The only reason why the Dark Demon hasn’t appeared thus far is because I used my formation to seal off the area, thus preventing the Dark Demon from sensing the aura of the pearl. However, I have just released my formation and amplified the aura of the pearl! It would take a miracle for the Dark Demon to still not notice it after that!

“Since you want to kill me, we shall all just go down together then!”

Like a lunatic, Yin Tianchou laughed heartily in the face of the Dark Demon, as if he was celebrating its emergence.

In his view, there was already no way he could get out of this. The least he could do was to drag Song Yun and Chu Feng down together with him.

Awooo!

But all of a sudden, the massive Dark Demon shrieked in horror before hurriedly burrowing back underground. It was almost as if... it was escaping from something even more frightening!

However, before it could get away, a suction force suddenly engulfed it, causing its body to break apart. Amidst screams of agony, the Dark Demon was reduced to wisps of smoke that was swiftly pulled toward Song Yun and into her mouth.

“You... What in the world are you?!” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Seeing such a frightening sight, Yin Tianchou fell back on his bum as he stared at Song Yun in utter fear. He couldn’t stop his body from trembling.

It wasn’t just the Dark Demon being devoured that he just saw. He had also gotten a glimpse of Song Yun’s current appearance too.

Song Yun’s eyes were blood-red at the moment, and her mouth was filled with rows of crimson fangs. She looked like a terrifying beast that had come from the netherworld.

The sweet, innocent girl was nowhere to be seen anymore.

She was obviously a terrifying maneating demoness.
