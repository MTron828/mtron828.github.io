Chapter 4591: Spurting Blood From Fury!

“However, I have a condition. My grandson, Shengguang Yu, is still being held hostage by Chu Feng. I can release Chu Feng, but he has to hand over my grandson first,” Shengguang Xuanye said.

“Young friend Chu Feng, is Shengguang Yu really in your hands?” Jiuhun Guizhi turned to Chu Feng and asked.

“He’s indeed in my hands, and I’m willing to free Shengguang Yu too. However, I would first like to clarify that I have never killed anyone from the Holy Light Clan, and I have never stolen any of their treasures before. The Holy Light Clan views me as a threat and seeks to undermine me. If not for the generous help offered by those from the Nine Souls Galaxy, I would have surely lost my life here!”

Chu Feng’s words provoked discussions from the crowd.

The crowd was surprised, but not because of the truth that Chu Feng was speaking. Many of them had already guessed that he was framed; no one would foolishly make an enemy out of the Holy Light Clan for no reason. Rather, what they were surprised of was Chu Feng’s courage to argue with the Holy Light Clan.

“Chu Feng, are you a man? You dare not man up to what you did?”

As expected, Chu Feng’s words immediately incited rebuttal from the Holy Light Clan.

However, Chu Feng was unfazed. He replied with a cold sneer, “Says the ones who pin crimes on others for the sake of justifying their actions. If that’s what the Holy Light Clan deems to be the quality of a man, I must say that all of you are outstanding men!”

“Chu Feng, do you really think that we dare not kill you?”

Several elders from the Holy Light Clan directed chilling gazes toward Chu Feng.

They were indeed frightened of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan, but they couldn’t stomach the humiliation that Chu Feng brought to the Holy Light Clan. After all, this was the Holy Light Galaxy they were in, and they were standing right before the people of the Holy Light Galaxy!

“Try touching him if you dare!” Xian Miaomiao spat from behind.

Her voice wasn’t loud, but the sheer lividness of the face of this sweet-looking princess was more than enough for the crowd to feel the sheer rage boiling inside her. It was apparent that the relationship between Chu Feng and this princess of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan went farther than just ordinary friends.

“Young friend Chu Feng, hand Shengguang Yu back to them. I’ll ensure your safety,” Jiuhun Guizhi said.

Chu Feng also didn’t bother arguing with the Holy Light Clan anymore. He had no intention of having a debate with the Holy Light Clan anyway, but he simply couldn’t stand the Holy Light Clan smearing shit on his head.

It was enough for him to speak his point of view. As for whether the crowd was willing to believe him or not, that was up to them.

Chu Feng revealed Shengguang Yu’s whereabouts to Jiuhun Guizhi, and Jiuhun Guizhi dispatched her people over to save Shengguang Yu from the killing formation before delivering him back into the hands of the Holy Light Clan.

“This!!!”

It was just that when Shengguang Yu finally appeared before everyone’s eyes, there was no one who could remain calm. The Holy Light Clan was infuriated, and the onlookers were all appalled.

Miserable.

Shengguang Yu looked far too miserable.

His body was caked in dried blood, and there was not an inch of skin intact on his body. To make things worse, he appeared to be in a deranged state. Fright was the expression on his face, and he wouldn’t stop trembling. He kept on muttering...

“I was wrong. Please, forgive me. Let me off. I’m begging you...”

His state was more than enough for the crowd to imagine just what kind of horrors he had been put through.

“Chu Feng, I’ll slaughter you!”

There were many people in the Holy Light Clan who couldn’t curb the anger in their hearts. They whipped out their weapons as they swore to get rid of Chu Feng.

They might have framed Chu Feng for killing their clan members and stealing their treasures, but the wounds on Shengguang Yu’s body and his deranged mental state was a fact. They couldn’t swallow this down.

One must know that this was the esteemed Shengguang Yu, the grandson of the Holy Light Clan’s Clan Chief!!!

Such an esteemed individual of their Holy Light Clan was actually tortured by Chu Feng to such a state! How could they possibly tolerate this?

However, they were fated to never be able to harm Chu Feng here. From the moment they whipped out their weapons, a surge of energy had already shrouded Chu Feng, protecting him from any harm.

And this surge of energy came no other from the Holy Light Clan’s Clan Chief, Shengguang Xuanye.

“Settle down!”

Veins were popping from Shengguang Xuanye’s temples as he shouted those words.

He was more furious than anyone to see his own grandson being reduced to such a state, but he had already made a promise to Jiuhun Guizhi to release Chu Feng as long as the latter returned Shengguang Yu to them. If he were to renege on his promise right now, he would be sullying the reputation of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan. This could potentially evolve into a war between the two of them.

He had no choice but to hand Chu Feng into Jiuhun Guizhi’s hands.

“Holy Light Clan’s Clan Chief, I hope that you’ll let bygones be bygones. Don’t ever look for young friend Chu Feng and make things difficult for him anymore. Regardless of what young friend Chu Feng has done or has not done, it’s all over from this point onward.

“On the account that young friend Chu Feng is a good friend of our princess, won’t you at least do this for our Nine Souls Sacred Clan?”

Jiuhun Guizhi had even brought out the name of the ‘Nine Souls Sacred Clan’ in her words. It couldn’t be more obvious that she was indirectly declaring the Nine Souls Sacred Clan’s protection of Chu Feng.

“Lord Guizhi, I have already given a lot of respect to your Nine Souls Sacred Clan. I can let bygones be bygones, but if Chu Feng dares to bring any trouble to my Holy Light Clan once more, I won’t let him off the hook so easily anymore.”

After saying those words, Shengguang Xuanye flung his sleeves coldly and led his clan members back into the camp.

The members of the Holy Light Clan were still burning with rage on the inside. They were actually humiliated on their land, and they couldn’t stomach it.

But despite their fury, no one dared to say a word.

That was because Shengguang Xuanye’s face was exceptionally dark. They feared that they would bring the rage of their clan chief upon themselves if they were to voice out right now.

They were well aware of just how terrifying their clan chief was when he was in a state of wrath. Anyone who dared to provoke him right now would be courting his death.

Pu!

But all of a sudden, a mouthful of blood spurted out from Shengguang Xuanye.

It wasn’t that he was injured, but his sheer anger had jolted his innards, causing his to spurt blood!

This was the first time such a thing had ever happened to the strongest cultivator of the Holy Light Galaxy!

“Lord Clan Chief!” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

The elders of the Holy Light Clan rushed up to him out of worry.

When had their clan chief ever had to suffer such treatment?

“Scram!”

However, Shengguang Xuanye waved his hand and knocked everyone who tried to approach him back. Then, he clenched his fists tightly as he spat out word for word.

“Chu Feng, if I don’t take your dog life, I’d have lived for vain my whole life!!!”
