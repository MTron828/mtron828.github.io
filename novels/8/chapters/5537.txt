Chapter 5537: A Reason I Have To Go

“The real Immemorial Star Sea? Isn’t that currently inaccessible? Can you enter the Immemorial Star Sea from here?” one of the Totem Phoenix Clansmen expressed his doubt.

“If Brother Chu Feng says it’s possible, that’s bound to be the case. Why are you doubting him?” Feng Tiansheng berated that person.

“I was foolish!” the Totem Phoenix Clansman hurriedly apologized.

Chu Feng wasn’t too bothered by their words. Instead, he turned his gaze to Long Chengyu and the others and asked, “Are you interested to come along?”

“I wish to take a look,” Long Chengyu said.

“Me too,” Feng Tiansheng chirped in too.

More and more people expressed their interest to visit the true Immemorial Star Sea, but they numbered in the minority. Most people were still reluctant to enter because they knew what kind of place the Immemorial Star Sea was.

Only one person in history had managed to leave her name on the Immemorial Star Sea’s stone monument. They weren’t so optimistic as to think that they could outdo that.

In truth, Long Chengyu, Feng Tiansheng, and the others didn’t bear much hope about leaving their names on the stone monument too. They only wanted to enter because Chu Feng wanted to do so.

After all they had been through, they were starting to lose their confidence. It was hard not to feel that way when there was a monster constantly reminding them of their inadequacy. They only wanted to head in to take a look and see what the Immemorial Star Sea was.

It was better to take a look with their own eyes than to rely on hearsay.

“Big sister, this is a rare opportunity. You also know that father wouldn’t allow me to go if he knew about it, so…” Long Chengyu looked at Long Muxi.

“Go ahead. I’ll tell father about what happened here,” Long Muxi replied.

“Big sister, you’re the best!” Long Chengyu grinned.

Feng Tiansheng also looked at his older sister, Feng Jiuyue, and the latter replied, “Go ahead.”

Thus, the two of them parted ways.

Long Muxi, Feng Jiuyue, and the majority of their clansmen chose to leave this place. After the events that had transpired here, it was of utmost importance for them to inform their respective clan chiefs as soon as possible so that they could take countermeasures.

On the other hand, Chu Feng, Long Chengyu, Feng Tiansheng, and a small group of people chose to venture into the Immemorial Star Sea. Stepping into the spirit formation gate, they found themselves entering a bizarre realm.

Their immediate surroundings had an ethereal atmosphere reminiscent of the Immemorial Star Sea, but it didn’t seem like they were in the Immemorial Star Sea yet. There was a long path beneath their feet that led into the depths of this bizarre realm.

No one knew what was awaiting them at the end of the path, but they could only move along this path. They couldn’t explore the area even though the realm was vast and stretched beyond what they could see with their eyes.

To make things worse, an unknown power continuously crashed into the path they were standing on, similar to waves. While the path did nullify that unknown power, the crowd still felt tremendous pressure from it.

“This is different from the Immemorial Star Sea I heard about,” Feng Tiansheng said with a frown.

Most of them had heard things about what their ancestors had gone through in the Immemorial Star Sea despite having never stepped into it themselves, so they weren’t completely ignorant about it.

However, this path had never appeared in any of their ancestors’ descriptions.

“We aren’t at the real Immemorial Star Sea yet. This is more like a formation region. The compass has forcefully created a path for us to pass through. We should be able to enter the real Immemorial Star Sea once we reach the other end of this path,” Chu Feng said.

“Young master, young hero Chu Feng, I-I can’t hold on anymore. The pressure is too great. Can I return first?” a Totem Dragon Clansman said.

Many more from both the Totem Dragon Clan and Totem Phoenix Clan expressed that they couldn’t withstand the pressure either.

“We are only here to take a look around. Please return if you find yourself reaching your limits. By no means should you risk your life to enter the Immemorial Star Sea,” Chu Feng said.

Long Chengyu and Feng Tiansheng also said the same as well, so those who had reached their limits quickly returned via the spirit formation gate.

Unfortunately, the pressure only got stronger as the group proceeded further down the path. More and more people reached their limits. Before long, the only ones who were left were Chu Feng, Long Chengyu, and Feng Tiansheng.

“This won’t do. I can’t hold on anymore too. Brother Chu Feng, Brother Chengyu, I’ll wait for you outside.” Feng Tiansheng was reluctant to give up, but he was already at his limit. In the end, he had no choice but to turn around and head back. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

It was a huge relief that the pressure would immediately half as soon as one turned around and headed back, but they had to continue walking on for the pressure reduction to apply. The moment they halted their footsteps, the tremendous pressure would assault them once again.

In other words, they could safely return as long as they chose to give up.

Long Chengyu looked at Chu Feng with a deep frown. He had long noticed that the latter had an awful complexion that looked worse than his and Feng Tiansheng’s.

“Brother Chu Feng, why don’t we give up? There will be plenty of chances in the future to enter the Immemorial Star Sea. You have exhausted yourself channeling the formation, and your body hasn’t recovered from the toll yet. You don’t need to risk your life here,” Long Chengyu said.

He knew that he wouldn’t be able to last to the very end, let alone Chu Feng, who was clearly in a worse state than him. It was likely that Chu Feng had already reached his limit, but somehow, he still managed to persevere up to this point.

He was worried that something might happen to Chu Feng after he would leave.

“I have to admit, Brother Chengyu, that I am struggling as well. This path is harder than I thought. However, I still wish to give it a try. Brother Chengyu, you can return first. You don’t have to accompany me,” Chu Feng said.

Chu Feng could tell that Long Chengyu was planning to retreat, but he chose to persevere on with gritted teeth out of worry for him.

“I’ll accompany you,” Long Chengyu insisted.

Just like that, the two of them continued advancing some distance ahead. However, Long Chengyu eventually reached his limit.

“Are you fine, Brother Chengyu?” Chu Feng asked.

“You’re insane, Brother Chu Feng. I could tell that you have already reached your limit shortly after we entered this place, but somehow, you still managed to outlast all of us.” Long Chengyu squatted down and gasped for air. He was so tired that even his voice sounded hoarse.

He couldn’t understand Chu Feng managed to hold on despite being in a worse condition.

“There’s a reason I need to enter the Immemorial Star Sea. You don’t need to endure all this. You should head back,” Chu Feng advised.

“Brother Chu Feng, are you able to hold on?” Long Chengyu asked.

“Don’t worry about me. Even if I reach my limit, I can turn back any time,” Chu Feng said.

“It’s a deal then. You have to turn back right away if you reach your limit. You mustn’t force yourself!” Long Chengyu exclaimed before he rose to his feet and headed back.

He was initially still worried about Chu Feng, but his worry faded when he noticed that the bulk of the pressure dispersed when he started heading back. This meant that Chu Feng could always leave this place safely as long as he made up his mind to give up.

Of course, that was only if Chu Feng still had the energy to walk when he gave up.

Soon, Chu Feng was the only one left on this seemingly endless path. His small silhouette looked insignificant compared to this expanse world, as he slowly advanced a step at a time with great difficulty.

He didn’t falter in the least even after Long Chengyu chose to give up. He wasn’t traveling at a fast speed, but he was making steady progress. He wanted to enter the Immemorial Star Sea because he was worried about Little Fishy due to the changes on the stone monument.

While he knew that Little Fishy was now one of the top prodigies in the vast world of cultivation, he still wouldn’t hesitate to cast aside everything to help her if she was in trouble.
