Chapter 4465: A Cold Attitude

After coming to a decision, Chu Feng quickly passed through the crowds and headed right for the barrier. Even though this barrier had covered up the mountain range entirely, there was still a small gate beneath for people to pass through.

It was just that the small gate was currently closed, and there were many guards watching over it.

The leaders of the guards were two old men.

These two old men didn’t appear to be particularly powerful. Chu Feng could tell that they were only at Utmost Exalted level.

Needless to say, the cultivation of the other guards was even lower.

However, they were holding onto the key to opening the gate in their hands. If Chu Feng wanted to pass through the gate, he would have to earn their recognition.

In truth, there were plenty of people amongst the onlookers whose cultivation was above that of the two old men, and that was excluding the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief and the others who had come together with Chu Feng. Nevertheless, the onlookers still displayed deep deference toward these two old men. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

No one dared to approach the gate at all. They were only observing the situation from a distance away.

The reason for that was because the master of the two old men was no other than Zhao Yuzhuo.

Zhao Yuzhuo was the person who was on extremely close terms with a princess of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan. Just this identity itself was more than enough to intimidate the others, making no one dare to offend him.

And this intimidation extended over to Zhao Yuzhuo’s underlings either.

There was simply no better protective umbrella to stand under other than that of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan within the Nine Souls Galaxy. It wasn’t the overlord of the Nine Souls Galaxy without a reason.

So, when Chu Feng attempted to approach the gate, he immediately caught everyone’s attention. A commotion immediately broke out amidst the onlookers as they tried to figure out what he was up to.

Even the two old men were shooting Chu Feng hostile gazes upon seeing him.

“Hold it right there! Do you know whose land this is? How dare a cretin like you dare to approach this place?”

Before the two old men could even speak, a middle-aged guard had already raised his voice and bellowed at Chu Feng.

Not only was his attitude abhorrent, but his tone was also filled with the disdain he felt for Chu Feng.

“Elder, I am well aware of that. This is the territory of the two young masters of the Zhao Clan,” Chu Feng replied.

He was phrasing it in such a manner due to the recent rise of two formidable figures from the Zhao Clan.

One of them was Zhao Yuzhuo. His close relations with a princess of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan had played a crucial role in building up the current influence the Zhao Clan commanded at the moment.

But if one were to put aside connections and just look at strength, there was another person who was even more formidable in the Zhao Clan.

He was the elder brother of Zhao Yuzhuo, Zhao Batian.

Zhao Batian was no longer a junior. It was said that he was over two hundred years in age. Nevertheless, there was no questioning that he was a prodigy. Not only was his cultivation level high, but his fighting prowess was incredible too.

Before Zhao Yuzhuo came to be acquainted with a princess of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan, his elder brother, Zhao Batian, was the most respected person in the Zhao Clan, striking fear in the hearts of others.

Another thing to note was that these two brothers were on very good terms with one another. From the very start, Zhao Batian was already an extremely violent and unreasonable person, and with Zhao Yuzhuo backing him up, he became even more brazen than before.

As for Zhao Yuzhuo, he was also gradually revealing his true domineering nature as well.

As a result, the Zhao Clan, Zhao Batian, and Zhao Yuzhuo became figures whom others would try to shun as far as they could.

“Since you know whose territory this is, how dare you try to barge in?” the middle-aged man asked.

“I am here not to cause trouble but to offer my help. I heard that the two young masters are currently hunting down a spirit beast, and I believe that my world spiritist techniques might be of some help to them.”

As Chu Feng spoke, he released his spirit power to reveal his identity as a world spiritist.

Feeling the remarkable prowess of a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist, the gazes of the crowd immediately changed.

Even in the Nine Souls Galaxy, it was an amazing feat for a junior to possess the strength of a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist.

Those two old men were initially still glaring at Chu Feng in impatience and hostility, hoping to chase him off. However, after realizing that he was no average figure, they exchanged glances before nodding their heads together.

“Let him in,” the first old man said.

“If you manage to capture the spirit beast, our young master will reward you handsomely. However, if you attempt to pull anything, both you and your family members will have to pay the price with your lives,” the second old man warned as he passed a token over to Chu Feng.

“If you meet anyone from our Zhao Clan after entering, you can just say that you’re here to help out. Show them the token and they’ll understand,” the second old man added.

Taking the token, Chu Feng thanked the two old men before he began making his way through the gate.

“Wait a moment. We are together!”

Yet, who could have thought that a voice would sound behind Chu Feng at this moment. Chu Feng turned around to take a look, and a slight frown immediately formed on his forehead.

The person who had just spoken was no other than Long Xiaoxiao.

Even though Long Xiaoxiao had altered her appearance, Chu Feng was still able to recognize her.

“Allow me to enter as well. I am a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist too. I’ll be able to help your young masters. Furthermore, the two of us know one another, so we can collaborate with one another to ensure the task gets done with maximum efficiency.”

As Long Xiaoxiao spoke, she released her spirit power too.

Even though she had yet to grasp the Dragon Transformation Sensation, there was no doubt that she was a true Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist.

On the other hand, after verifying Long Xiaoxiao’s strength, the second old man took out yet another token and passed it to her, permitting her entry.

As a result, Chu Feng and Long Xiaoxiao ended up passing through the gate and entering the mountain range together.

“Why are you here?”

But barely after proceeding in for a little, Chu Feng quickly checked his surroundings to verify that there was no one around before asking her gravely.

“Little benefactor, you don’t need to worry. I won’t cause trouble for you!” Long Xiaoxiao said with a smile.

“Go back.”

Yet, who could have thought that Chu Feng’s attitude would suddenly turn frosty?

Chu Feng knew that this trip would be filled with dangers, so he was unwilling to implicate Long Xiaoxiao with him.
