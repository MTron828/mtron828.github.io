MGA: Chapter 1184 - False Countercharge

At that moment, Bai Ruochen, Long Chenyi and practically everyone else present cast their gazes onto Chu Feng. They all felt that what Chu Feng would say would create an enormous wave. [1. Extremely controversial.]

“Since everyone wants to know about it this badly, then I won’t conceal it anymore either.”

“Actually, it’s very simple. The exceptional genius that you all have thought to be comparable to Lord Qing Xuantian, the demon-level character Yuan Qing, is actually no genius at all. Instead, he is merely trash.”

“Furthermore, not only is he trash, he is also an extremely despicable, shameless, petty and vile character.”

“The fact of him triggering the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle is a lie, and the fact of him obtaining the Commander Flag is also a lie. All of the honor and glory that he carries on him are lies, things that he has stolen from someone else, things that he has robbed another of.”

“As he does not have true ability, how could he possibly dare to fight against me? Without the ability to survive, how could he possibly dare to accept a fight to the death before this many people?” Chu Feng’s voice grew louder and louder. Furthermore, each and every one of his words was very resounding, trembling through the entire sky and intimidating the hearts of the crowd.

“What? The honors and glories that Yuan Qing accomplished were all fake? In that case, doesn’t it mean that he has not triggered the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle, and not obtained the Commander Flag?”

“Exactly what is going on? Why did Chu Feng say that the honors and glories that Yuan Qing has were stolen and robbed? Is he implying that the person who had done all of those was not Yuan Qing, and Yuan Qing merely claimed someone else’s accomplishments as his own?”

“But, in that case, exactly whose accomplishments did Yuan Qing claim to be his own? Exactly who is that real exceptional genius?”

Chu Feng’s words immediately created a ruckus among the crowd. Everyone’s expressions changed greatly. They had thought that perhaps Yuan Qing feared Chu Feng because he felt that Chu Feng was too powerful and that he was no match for him.

However, never had they ever imagined that everything that Yuan Qing ever accomplished was fake. It turned out that he was simply not an exceptional genius. Instead, he was an extremely fake, despicable and shamelessly vile individual.

“Chu Feng, you’re spouting bullshit. While you can insult us, we definitely cannot allow you to frame our junior brother Yuan Qing.” At this moment, the disciples of the Orion Monastery were all enraged. They who believed Yuan Qing firmly all felt that Chu Feng was lying, that he was seizing this opportunity to attack Yuan Qing, and that he was the one that was actually despicable and shameless.

“Chu Feng, while you can eat whatever you wish, you cannot say whatever you wish. If you dare to continue to speak nonsense like this to attack another’s dignity and slander another’s reputation, then do not blame me for doing my duty as an elder and taking you down.”

In fact, it was not only the disciples of the Orion Monastery that were enraged, the elders from the Orion Monastery were also enraged. Especially those several Half Martial Emperor-level elders; they were displaying their anger without concealing anything.

With overflowing anger, they caused the skies to turn dark and lightning to appear. This scene was truly terrifying. It was as if they would truly attack Chu Feng should he dare to speak malicious words toward Yuan Qing.

“Ha, haha, hahaha, hahahahaha...” However, faced with this sort of situation, not only was Chu Feng not afraid in the slightest, he instead started to frantically laugh once again.

He laughed for quite a while before suddenly stopping his laughter. With raised eyebrows and a serious expression, he looked at the elders of the Orion Monastery and said with a loud voice. “You say that I am attacking Yuan Qing’s dignity and slandering his reputation, then let me ask you all a question. Who among you all had personally seen Yuan Qing triggering the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle? Who among you all had personally seen Yuan Qing obtaining the Commander Flag? All of you only saw the aftermath, but who among you actually saw the process?”

“This...”

“While none of us saw the process, the results clearly indicate everything. Regardless of whether it is the triggering of the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle or obtaining the Commander Flag, they were both done by Yuan Qing.”

“These are things that us elders could vouch for with our own dignity, for Yuan Qing is a disciple of our Orion Monastery, and we know of and believe in his personal character very well.”

“Thus, Chu Feng, it is best for you to not continue to slander Yuan Qing. Otherwise, we will truly not hold back against you.” said the elders of the Orion Monastery in anger.

“Good, very good. What a great ‘vouch for Yuan Qing with our dignity.’ Since you elders are willing to vouch for Yuan Qing, then I have a question that I wish to ask Yuan Qing.”

“Yuan Qing, since you’ve obtained the Commander Flag, where is the Commander Flag? As far as I know, you have yet to exchange your Commander Flag for the rewards, right?” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Since you’ve yet to exchange it for the rewards, it means that the Commander Flag must most definitely be on you. Are you daring enough to take it out so that we can see it?” Chu Feng asked Yuan Qing.

“That’s right, although Yuan Qing obtained the Commander Flag, it appears that no one have seen him take out the Commander Flag before. He hasn’t exchanged the Commander Flag for the rewards in the Mission Plaza either. So where exactly is the Commander Flag?”

As expected, once Chu Feng said those words, many people started to put everything together. As none of them had seen Yuan Qing’s Commander Flag before, this caused many of them to become suspicious of Yuan Qing. More and more people began to question the authenticity of this genius.

“Yuan Qing, take out the Commander Flag and show it to him so that he has nothing to say,” said an elder from the Orion Monastery with a loud voice.

“Elders, I...” Yuan Qing was forced into a dead end by Chu Feng. At this moment, not only was his complexion pale, he was also sweating and trembling. Even his speech had started to stutter and tremble.

Faced with the questioning from the crowd, he finally clenched his teeth and said, “The Commander Flag, the Commander Flag, I’ve... lost it.”

“What? You’ve lost the Commander Flag?” Hearing those words, not to mention the others, even the expressions of those elders from the Orion Monastery changed greatly.

They had all vouched for Yuan Qing with their own dignity. Yet, Yuan Qing was actually unable to take out the Commander Flag right now and even said that he had lost it. Wasn’t this equivalent to a slap to their faces?

“Elders, I, Yuan Qing, have let you all down. However, I have truly lost the Commander Flag. I should’ve told you all about this matter sooner, I should not have concealed it. Elders, please punish me.” Gnashing his teeth with anger, Yuan Qing confirmed the matter.

“Lost it? From the way I see it, it’s not that you’ve lost it, but instead, that you never obtained it to begin with and have never even seen what it looks like, no?” said Chu Feng with a smile on his face.

“I have lost it, so whatever you say now is fine. However, Chu Feng, I truly do not understand why must you attack me like this. Could it be that you’re jealous and envious of me? Is that the reason that caused you to harbor such hatred for me?”

“I know, that must be the reason. You were among the people who entered the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond alongside me. However, the person who triggered the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle in the end was me and not you.”

“Ever since that time, you’ve hated me to the bones and planned to frame me the entire time. Today, you’ve finally managed to obtain what you wanted, isn’t that right?”

“However, I’ll tell you this. You are wrong. The eyes of the elders are bright and clear. The senior brothers and sisters of the Cyanwood Mountain are sensible people. It is impossible for this little scheme of yours to deceive them. It is impossible for you to entrap me. In the end, you will only become a laughingstock, everyone’s object of contempt.”

Yuan Qing was nearly forced insane by Chu Feng. At this moment, he was finally unable to restrain himself anymore and burst forth with all of the anger within his heart. However, Yuan Qing was very intelligent. Not only did he provide an explanation for himself, he even made a false countercharge against Chu Feng.

“Jealous of you? Envious of you? Hey hey hey, Yuan Qing, aren’t you thinking too highly of yourself? Why don’t you carefully inspect yourself and see exactly what you possess that is worthy of my jealousy? Is there even anything that you have that surpasses me?”

“You say you’ve lost the Commander Flag, in that case, how did you lose it and where did you lose it? Are you able to tell us that? Even if you are to lie, you should make your lies out to be reasonable, no?” Chu Feng had already anticipated that Yuan Qing would countercharge him. He was not angered in the slightest. Instead, he was smiling an extremely brilliant smile. Everything was within Chu Feng’s grasp.
