Chapter 3780 - The Frightened Song Ge

“I had originally thought this to be a fated encounter between lovers. Never would I have imagined that you’d be such scum. You’ve truly disappointed me,” Chu Feng said to Ma Liang.

“Motherfucker! Who did you think you are? You dare spoil the fun of your daddy Ma Liang?! You’re truly courting death!”

Without even putting on his clothes, Ma Liang rushed towards Chu Feng.

His speed was very fast. He arrived before Chu Feng in the blink of an eye.

He raised his hand and shot a punch towards Chu Feng’s dantian.

He was trying to cripple Chu Feng’s cultivation.

However, Chu Feng did not even attempt to avoid Ma Liang’s attack. Just like that, he allowed Ma Liang’s attack to reach him.

Seeing that, the hopeful Song Ge was immediately discouraged.

Although her battle power was greatly affected by her injury, she still had her perceptive ability.

Thus, she was able to clearly witness the scene of Ma Liang rushing towards Chu Feng. Yet, to her surprise, Chu Feng did not react to it in the slightest.

She felt that Chu Feng was simply too weak, and unable to defeat Ma Liang. With that, how could he possibly save her?

“Bang~~~”

Suddenly, a muffled echo was heard. Ma Liang’s fist landed. However, Chu Feng was completely unharmed. It was instead Ma Liang’s fist that ended up being injured. He took several steps back, grimaced, and started screaming in pain.

Song Ge was originally confused as to why Ma Liang suddenly reacted like that.

It was only when she looked closely that she noticed that Ma Liang’s fist was completely drenched with blood and was completely mutilated.

She then looked to Chu Feng, and discovered that he was completely uninjured.

“This...”

At that moment, Song Ge began to carefully size up the mediocre-looking man standing beside her. Upon doing so, extreme shock appeared in her eyes.

Even though she had thought that the man standing beside her might be able to save her, she actually didn’t place too much hope in being saved.

This was especially true earlier as she gave up on the small hope she’d had.

It was precisely because she didn’t put much hope in the man beside her being able to save her that she was especially stunned by the situation before her.

“You... who are you?”

Ma Liang had managed to calm down. With a serious look on his face, he stared at Chu Feng.

Chu Feng’s body shifted and appeared before Ma Liang. He grabbed his head and forced him onto his knees.

Chu Feng did not answer Ma Liang’s question. Instead, with a cold voice, he said, “Do you know what forcibly depriving someone of a secret skill will do?”

“Milord, I was wrong. I was wrong.”

“Milord, please give me another chance. I am a disciple of Cloud Paradise. My master is Cloud Paradise’s Supreme Elder, Zhang Tao.”

“As long as you spare my life, my master will be willing to give you anything. My master has many secret skills.”

Ma Liang was completely terrified. He knew that if the secret skill was forcibly stripped from him, he would end up being killed in the process.

“Humph.”

Chu Feng let out a cold snort at Ma Liang’s proposal.

Then, power appeared in Chu Feng’s palm. With that, Ma Liang began to shake uncontrollably.

Ma Liang had a sinister look on his face. One could see that he was in extreme pain. However, he was unable to utter a single word, unable to even scream.

Such a situation lasted but a split second before Ma Liang fell to the ground with a ‘putt.’

Ma Liang had turned into a corpse. He had died.

Looking over to Chu Feng, one could see that there was a body of light in his hand. That was the secret skill from earlier.

Song Ge stood there completely dumbfounded and terrified.

She never imagined that Chu Feng would kill Ma Liang just like that.

He was simply too decisive with his actions.

“Young lady, don’t be afraid. This man needed to be killed.”

“If he was allowed to live, who knows how many more people he would end up harming.”

Seeing that Song Ge looked slightly frightened, Chu Feng immediately started comforting her.

“Thank you for saving me, senior.”

Slowly, Song Ge managed to calm herself. She immediately kneeled before Chu Feng and bowed respectfully to him. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Even though she didn’t understand him and didn’t know who he was, she guessed from his words that it was possible that he had killed Ma Liang to save her. Because of this, she felt particularly grateful toward him.

“Woosh~~~”

Suddenly, Chu Feng flicked his finger, and the secret skill he was holding earlier was sent into Song Ge’s body.

Song Ge’s body grew stiff. She knew that the secret skill had assimilated with her, and that she had gained its power.

“Senior, why did you...”

Song Ge was confused. Chu Feng had already saved her and showed her enormous grace.

Yet, he actually ended up giving the secret skill to her too? Whilst she felt extremely grateful towards him for doing that, she was also completely confused by it.

She was unable to understand why Chu Feng would possibly give a secret skill to her, a stranger.

“That secret skill is useless to me. However, it’s useful to you. It’s better than being wasted,” Chu Feng said to Song Ge.

This simple sentence from Chu Feng erased the confusion in Song Ge’s heart.

Indeed. Whilst that secret skill might be of considerable value for someone like Song Ge, it would be completely worthless to true experts.

She was the one lacking in experience.

“Song Ge will forever remember senior’s grace and kindness.”

Song Ge kneeled to Chu Feng again.

However, this time around, Chu Feng grabbed her arm before she could kneel and pulled her back up.

“You’re injured. Take this medicine.” Chu Feng handed Song Ge a medicinal pellet.

Song Ge looked at the medicinal pellet. Then, without hesitation, she swallowed it.

It wasn’t that she wasn’t wary of Chu Feng. After experiencing what had happened with Ma Liang, she was afraid that Chu Feng’s medicinal pellet might have some sort of issue.

However, upon thinking about what Chu Feng had done earlier and how powerful he was, she decided to believe him.

After swallowing the medicinal pellet, the many injuries that covered Song Ge began to rapidly improve.

As a martial cultivator, it was normal for Song Ge to be injured. For the level of injury she had sustained earlier, it would generally require medicinal pellets combined with healing formations to cure. Furthermore, it would be impossible to cure that level of injury in a short period of time.

However, now, she was actually completely cured by a single medicinal pellet. With this, Song Ge had a whole new level of respect for Chu Feng.

“Senior, that medicinal pellet of yours is simply too powerful. It is simply the work of gods,” Song Ge praised.

“Don’t address me as senior. I’m actually younger than you,” Chu Feng said with a smile.

“Senior, you’re younger than me?”

“But you...”

Song Ge felt completely surprised.

She was considered to be a genius in the Void Cleanse Monastery.

She could be said to be showered with praises the entire time, from being a disciple all the way to becoming an elder.

Thus, when she encountered someone as powerful as Chu Feng, the very first thought that came to her mind was that Chu Feng was a senior expert who must be much older than her.

Yet, he actually told her that he was younger than her. Naturally, Song Ge felt very surprised by that.

After all, if that was indeed the case, it would mean that Song Ge had encountered a genius even more powerful than her.

Furthermore, Chu Feng seemed to be much more powerful than her.

Would this mean that the person standing before her was an exceptional genius?
