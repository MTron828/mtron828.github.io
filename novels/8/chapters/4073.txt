Chapter 4073 - Worrisome Gift

“Xuan Tianpeng, if you intend to bully Headmaster Han, you’ll have to first pass through me,” suddenly, a deep and resounding voice exploded in the sky.

Then, a figure walked out from the direction of the Purple Star Hall and landed before the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster.

This person was the Inferno Academy’s headmaster.

“The Xuanming Family is truly impressive.”

“You actually dare to bully my close friend?”

Then, another figure walked over from the sky.

Not only did he also land before Han Xiu, but he was also someone of enormous origin.

He was the Dragon Immortal Pavilion’s pavilion master.

“You all!”

The Xuanming Family’s family head turned green in the face.

The three people that had appeared all possessed rank four Utmost Exalted-level cultivation. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

They were all existences that he could not defeat.

It was even more so when the three of them appeared together.

“Humph.”

Finally, the Xuanming Family’s family head let out a cold snort. He planned to leave with the people from the Xuanming Family.

“Wait.”

However, right after he turned around, three powerful auras blocked the path of the Xuanming Family.

They were oppressive might from the Miao Heavenly Clan’s clan chief, the Dragon Phoenix Immortal Pavilion’s pavilion master and the Inferno Academy’s headmaster.

“What else do you all want?” asked the Xuanming Family’s family head.

The tone of his voice actually contained a slight amount of grievance.

Indeed, he was feeling wronged. He had originally only planned to bully the Chu Heavenly Clan.

Yet, a Red-dress Holy Land suddenly appeared. That said, he was not afraid of the Red-dress Holy Land.

Yet, to his surprise, these three actually appeared afterwards.

Knowing his own strength, he immediately admitted defeat. Since he could not defeat them, he decided to avoid them.

Yet, they actually refused to allow him to leave. This...

Could it be that they wanted him to apologize?

“Xuan Tianpeng, listen carefully. We are giving you a chance today by sparing you.”

“If you dare to cause trouble for the Red-dress Holy Land again, don’t blame us for not remembering our old friendship,” said the Miao Heavenly Clan’s clan chief.

Although the other two leaders did not say anything, one could tell from their expressions that they were in agreement with him.

At this moment, the Xuanming Family’s family head was feeling extreme regret.

If he had known that this would happen, he wouldn’t have come out in the first place.

He had only planned to take care of the Chu Heavenly Clan. Yet, he ended up being ordered around by others. His face was nearly lost completely.

Fortunately, after the Miao Heavenly Clan’s clan chief finished saying those words, he retrieved his oppressive might.

Dejected, the Xuanming Family’s family head left.

After the Xuanming Family left, the bystanders burst into an uproar.

The Red-dress Holy Land was not as powerful as they had imagined. In fact, they were even somewhat weak.

But, why would the Miao Heavenly Clan, Dragon Phoenix Immortal Pavilion and Inferno Academy, those three great powers, help them?

Those three powers used to be allied with the All-heaven Sect.

Why would they behave like they had such a close relationship with the Red-dress Holy Land?

While the crowd were feeling confused, they realized that even though the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster was not very powerful, she was definitely not someone to be looked down on.

“Milords, thank you all for coming to our aid.”

The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief stepped forward and expressed his thanks.

The Miao Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief smiled in response.

Neither the Inferno Academy’s headmaster or the Dragon Phoenix Immortal Pavilion’s pavilion master bothered to pay attention to the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief. Instead, they exchanged some words of pleasantries with Han Xiu and left.

They were only intending to come to the Red-dress Holy Land’s aid.

As for the Chu Heavenly Clan, they actually looked down on them.

This scene caused the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief to feel somewhat awkward.

Fortunately, the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster’s attitude was very amiable.

“Clan Chief Chu, you don’t have to thank me. I am merely unable to tolerate people that bully the weak yet fear the strong,” the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster said with a smile.

Then, she exchanged some pleasantries with the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

However, she did not mention Zhao Hong. She acted as if she were really coming to their rescue due to the injustice that they were suffering, and not because of anything else.

Without the Xuanming Family’s obstruction, the Chu Heavenly Clan managed to smoothly enter the Purple Star Hall.

Soon after, the grand ceremony began.

After the overlords from the Ten Abandoned Starfields entered the Purple Star Hall, they no longer started any conflicts.

In fact, even after everyone learned of the Chu Heavenly Clan obtaining the legendary Flower Sea King, still no one made things difficult for them.

This eased the worries of the Chu Heavenly Clansmen.

Furthermore, the grand ceremony was different from what the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief had imagined it to be.

Apart from the need to find Purple Star Wisterias on their own, the Purple Star Hall had prepared other gifts for the Ten Abandoned Starfields’ overlords.

The following days seemed to be full of hospitable entertainment.

The grand occasion truly seemed to be a gathering the Purple Star Hall had created for the Ten Abandoned Starfields’ overlords.

The Ten Abandoned Starfields’ overlords were enjoying treatment like they were distinguished guests of the Purple Star Hall.

This was no Feast at Swan Goose Gate at all.

However, things changed on the tenth day the Chu Heavenly Clan arrived at the Purple Star Hall.

Although the Ten Abandoned Starfields’ overlords were the main characters of the previous gatherings, the other powers from the Purple Star Upper Realm were also allowed to participate.

However, the following banquet was something that only the Ten Abandoned Starfields’ overlords were allowed to participate in.

Furthermore, the Purple Star Hall’s Hall master personally appeared to entertain them at this banquet.

Before this banquet, they had been entertained by the Purple Star Hall’s elders, and the Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master had never shown himself.

However, it would be one thing if he were only there to entertain them.

The issue was that at the end of the banquet, the Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master prepared a great gift for the Ten Abandoned Starfields’ overlords.

This great gift just so happened to worry the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

......

After the banquet ended, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief returned to the palace the Purple Star Hall had prepared for them.

There was a private sleeping chamber inside this palace guarded by experts of the Chu Heavenly Clan.

The reason for that was because this was the place where Chu Feng was resting.

Ever since the day his poison had flared up, he had been sleeping with his eyes closed. Even though he was still alive, his aura had remained very weak the entire time.

This greatly worried the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief. If it wasn’t for Chu Feng telling him to not seek aid from others, he would’ve thickened his skin and sought help long ago.

Seeing Chu Feng with a painful expression on his face even though he was sleeping with closed eyes, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief sighed.

That sigh of his was very powerless.

He was deeply worried about Chu Feng, deeply afraid that he would never wake up from this sleep.

Standing beside the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, Chu Hanpeng also had a look of worry. However, he was not only worried about Chu Feng.

He was also worried about the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

“Lord Clan Chief, are you really going? Can’t you not go?”

“Would the Purple Star Hall really make things difficult for us if we don’t go?”

“No matter what, we’re still guests, no?”

“How could they force us to go?” asked Chu Hanpeng.

“Hanpeng, it’s enough.”

“Besides, the Purple Star Hall is doing this with good intentions. If we don’t go, it’ll be truly inappropriate,” said the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.
