Chapter 5369: Divine Inheritance Ground

“Young miss, this is…?” Chu Feng was perplexed.

“You need it, don’t you?” Ling Sheng’er asked.

“How much does it cost?”

“How much? I told you that I’ll return your favor, didn’t I? Take it.” Ling Sheng’er stuffed the Life Crystal into Chu Feng’s hand.

Jie Yu was taken aback. He finally saw some semblance of truth in Chu Feng’s earlier claim that he had a pleasant chat with Ling Sheng’er. Not in his wildest imagination did he think that Ling Sheng’er could be this courteous to another junior. 

“Young miss, you’re too generous. I’ll accept your gift then.”

Putting aside the fact that Chu Feng was thick-skinned, he really needed the Life Crystal. There was no reason for him to turn down Ling Sheng’er’s goodwill. 

“Didn’t you say that you’re able to awaken it? I’ll like to see you do it,” Ling Sheng’er said.

“I’d like to see it too,” Yao Luo said with a smirk.

“All right. Since the two ladies wish to see it, I’ll give it a try.”

Chu Feng first dispelled the formation around the Life Crystal. A moment later, both Chu Feng and the Life Crystal began to glow brightly.

“What do you think, ladies?” Chu Feng asked.

“You… You really awakened it just like that?” Yao Luo’s eyes widened into huge circles as her mouth opened agape. Disbelief could be seen on her face.

“Unless you think that I faked it,” Chu Feng replied.

As a matter of fact, that was also what Yao Luo was thinking. If not for Chu Feng emanating the same glow as the Life Crystal, she would have been certain that he was faking it. After all, she knew how convoluted the awakening process of the Life Crystal was. 

To her, it was unthinkable that it could be done that easily. 

On the other hand, Ling Sheng’er chuckled at that sight and asked, “Is one enough?”

“It isn’t,” Chu Feng replied.

“I can offer you another two more, but it won’t be for free. I have already repaid my favor to you,” Ling Sheng’er said.

“Young miss, what can I offer my assistance for?” Chu Feng asked.

Someone of Ling Sheng’er’s standing was bound to have no lack of treasures and resources, so it didn’t make sense for her to sell the Life Crystal to him. It was more likely that she needed his help on a matter. 

“You’re a smart man. Yes, I do need your help. I promise that I’ll give you the two Life Crystals at the end whether we succeed or not,” Ling Sheng’er said. She turned to Jie Yu and asked, “You’re entering the Ancient Palace tomorrow too, right?”

“Yes, I’ll be going too,” Jie Yu replied with a nod. He looked almost like a subordinate before Ling Sheng’er.

“Bring Chu Feng with you tomorrow,” Ling Sheng’er ordered. She turned her attention back to Chu Feng and flashed him a sweet smile, saying, “Chu Feng, it looks like we’ll be meeting again tomorrow.”

With those words, she rose to the sky and left the scene.Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“See you tomorrow, young master Chu Feng.” Yao Luo bade Chu Feng farewell before chasing after Ling Sheng’er.

“Congratulations, Brother Chu Feng,” Jie Yu exclaimed.

“Jie Yu, what is the Ancient Palace?” Bai Yunqing asked.

Chu Feng also looked at Jie Yu with a confused look.

“To talk about the Ancient Palace, I have to first talk about the land we’re standing on right now,” Jie Yu replied via voice transmission.

Knowing that this matter was likely to be confidential, Chu Feng swapped to voice transmission before asking on, “What’s special about the land we’re standing on?”

“Let’s talk inside,” Jie Yu said.

Once the three of them were inside the palace, Jie Yu took out a treasure and activated it, constructing a powerful isolation barrier around the palace. 

“Chu Feng, Bai Yunqing, whatever I tell you mustn’t reach anyone else’s ears, or else it could cost you your life. This is an important secret of our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion,” Jie Yu said. 

“Don’t worry, we won’t divulge it,” Chu Feng replied.

“You can trust us on this.” Bai Yunqing nodded.

“You have been through the trial too. If you were meticulous enough, you would have noticed marks of the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect,” Jie Yu said.

“We did notice them. This place really isn’t constructed by the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion?” Bai Yunqing asked.

“Of course not. This is one of the Divine Inheritance Grounds,” Jie Yu replied.

“Divine Inheritance Grounds? Is that for real?” Bai Yunqing was stunned.

“Of course it’s real!” Jie Yu replied.

“My gosh. My gosh! I’m actually standing on a Divine Inheritance Ground! I never thought that I would ever be able to enter a Divine Inheritance Ground!” Bai Yunqing exclaimed in excitement, almost as if he couldn’t believe it to be true. 

“What is a Divine Inheritance Ground?” Chu Feng asked.

Baffled by the question, Jie Yu turned to Chu Feng and asked, “Brother Chu Feng, you have never heard of the Divine Inheritance Grounds?”

Accustomed to how ignorant Chu Feng was, Bai Yunqing patiently explained the matter to him, “Big brother Chu Feng, there was a point in the Ancient Era where both martial cultivation and world spiritist techniques reached the peak after refinement over countless generations. In truth, we call the Ancient Era as it is not because it was in a distant era but because there was a lapse in the inheritance of knowledge between the Ancient Era and our current era. 

“There are many guesses as to why there was a lapse in the inheritance of knowledge. One of the more popular conjectures was that a huge disaster befell the world of cultivation during the final years of the Ancient Era, causing many to lose their lives. There are still a small handful of cultivators who have survived the Ancient Era, but most of them have lost their memories and have forgotten about what happened in the Ancient Era.

“The point I’m trying to make here is that there is very little relation between the people of our era and those from the Ancient Era. 

“There were hardly any living beings during the inception of the present era. It was a long time before humans and monstrous beasts repopulated the world of cultivation, but even so, none of them possessed the foundation for cultivation. They were mortals in the truest sense. Those born with bloodline abilities were unable to exert them due to the lack of knowledge to develop them. Monstrous beasts were stronger than humans due to their superior physical prowess, but they were no different from wild beasts.

“Humans and monstrous beasts eventually grasped cultivation and world spiritist techniques once more, but it wasn’t because they redeveloped it from scratch. Rather, they learned them from the remnants and artifacts. But that is weird in itself. Humans and monstrous beasts were extremely weak back in the earlier years of our present era, whereas ancient remnants are inaccessible to ordinary mortals due to the powerful formations within them. 

“As it turned out, there are some remnants that have no restrictions at all. Anyone can enter those remnants and inherit knowledge about martial cultivation and world spiritist techniques. What’s intriguing about these remnants is that they weren’t from the Ancient Era; it was almost as if they have appeared specifically for the people of the current era. 

“No one knows where these remnants are from, but their existence has most definitely helped us greatly in developing our knowledge about martial cultivation and world spiritist techniques. Due to that, we dubbed these places as ‘Divine Inheritance Grounds’. I heard that all of the Divine Inheritance Grounds have already disappeared, but it looks like that might have been a lie,” Bai Yunqing said.

“But based on what I know, all of the Divine Inheritance Grounds have already disappeared. 

Jie Yu nodded in agreement and replied, “Most of the Divine Inheritance Grounds have indeed disappeared, but there are still a few of them around. It’s just that those have been claimed by powerhouses and aren’t open to the public.”

“Is this Divine Inheritance Remnant a place to inherit world spiritist techniques?” Bai Yunqing asked.

“Yes. This was the first Divine Inheritance Remnant to appear in our era. It was previously under the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s control, then our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion took over. However, neither the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect nor our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion has deciphered its deepest secrets, so we don’t know what else is on this land. That’s why the Seven Realm Sacred Mansion strictly forbade outsiders from stepping into the Ancient Palace. Brother Chu Feng, it’s a huge stroke of luck that you have been given such an opportunity,” Jie Yu said.
