Chapter 5539: The Second Inheritor of the Royal Bloodline

The Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief didn’t say a word, and the fear in his eyes disappeared in a flash. However, he retracted his domineering oppressive might.

That brought a smile to the face of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master, as he said, “That’s more like it, Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief. We have known each other for many years. Let’s talk things out if there are any misunderstandings between us. Resorting to violence will only undermine the amicable ties between our clans.”

The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master waved off his sleeves, and a palace instantaneously manifested around them. The palace was massive, but it only contained a set of a table and chairs positioned right in front of the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief.

“Take a seat, Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief,” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master said.

“There’s no need for that. I hope that you can offer me a satisfactory explanation for what happened earlier,” the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief, do you know who’s the most talented prodigy of our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion?” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master asked.

“Isn’t it Ling Xiao?”

It had already dawned on the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief that was unlikely to be the answer when he said those words, or else the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master wouldn’t have asked such a question.

Still, with how talented Ling Xiao was, it was hard to imagine another junior more talented than him.

“That’s not it.” The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master shook his head. He looked at the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief with a proud expression. “The most talented prodigy of our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion is Jie Tian.”

“Jie Tian? I have never heard of him before.” The moment the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief said those words, another possibility surfaced in his mind, and he quickly added, “Have you been hiding him from the rest of the world?”

“Indeed, I have been raising Tian’er right by my side. There are no more than ten people in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion who know about Tian’er’s existence,” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master said.

“What does Tian’er have to do with the events here? Could it be…”

The Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief suddenly thought about the recent changes to the stone monument located in the Immemorial Star Sea. Xianhai Yu’er’s name had been clearly shown on it for a while, but her name suddenly began blurring and two words appeared on top of it.

Those two words were likely to be another person’s name.

“Could it be that Jie Tian has entered the Immemorial Star Sea too, and the second name appearing on the stone monument belongs to him?” the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief asked.

“That’s right,” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master replied with a nod. “Tian’er isn’t just the most talented prodigy in our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. He’s also Mubai and Tiannian’s son, which makes him my grandson.”

The Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief was taken aback.

While he didn’t expect to hear that Ling Xiao wasn’t the most talented prodigy in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, he wasn’t too surprised since it wasn’t out of character for the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master to pick out a prodigy and secretly nurture him.

However, the fact that Jie Tian was Jie Mubai and Jie Tiannian’s son, as well as the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master’s grandson, changed the nature of this matter.

The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master had two daughters.

One was Jie Ranqing, who was known as the most talented individual to have ever emerged in the vast world of cultivation. The other was Jie Tiannian, who was a hundred years older than Jie Ranqing.

Prior to Jie Ranqing’s rise to fame, Jie Tiannian and Jie Mubai had been the number one prodigy in the world of cultivation in their respective eras. In particular, Jie Mubai had been so talented that he didn’t pale much in comparison to Jie Ranqing. He towered over all other prodigies who shared a generation with him, becoming an unsurpassable figure for them.

Jie Mubai was not at a thousand years of age yet, but he was close to reaching pinnacle True Dragon World Spiritist, which would make him the youngest powerhouse in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.

Whether he was truly the youngest powerhouse or not depended on how far Jie Ranqing had advanced her spirit power in her closed-door cultivation. It was hard to tell for sure, but most people reckoned that Jie Ranqing wouldn’t pale much in comparison to Jie Mubai.

Regardless, there was no doubt that Jie Mubai was one of the strongest figures in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion amongst the younger generation. Other than Jie Ranqing, he was the most likely person to become the next Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master.

Jie Tiannian’s current strength was unknown, but her talent was only second to Jie Mubai and Jie Ranqing back then. It would be foolish to make light of her.

A child born between Jie Mubai and Jie Tiannian was not to be underestimated.

Speaking of which, the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief had even attended Jie Mubai and Jie Tiannian’s wedding decades ago. He clearly remembered the event, as it had happened shortly after Jie Ranqing announced that she would be going into closed-door cultivation.

“Who could have thought that Mubai and Tiannian already have a child?” the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief remarked.

“Tian’er was born a year after their marriage. His birth was accompanied by a phenomenon, but I claimed that the phenomenon came from an ancient world spiritist remnant so as to not draw attention to him,” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master said.

“Could it be that phenomenon?” The Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief was stunned.

He suddenly remembered a massive phenomenon spanning the entire Seven Realms Galaxy just a year after Jie Mubai and Jie Tiannian’s marriage. It affected the entire world of cultivation; it was visible even from the Totem Galaxy.

However, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master later announced that it was caused by the discovery of an ancient world spiritist remnant. Who could have thought that the true cause behind it was Jie Tian’s birth?

“That phenomenon was nowhere inferior to Jie Ranqing’s birth,” the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“Of course. Tian’er has the Royal Bloodline too,” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master replied smugly.

“He has the Royal Bloodline too?!”

The Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief was taken aback. The announcement heaped a great deal of stress on him. Jie Ranqing had shone brightly back in her generation because she had the Royal Bloodline, making her a unique existence in the world spiritist-filled Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.

Who could have thought that Jie Mubai and Jie Tiannian’s child would possess the Royal Bloodline too? 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

All powerhouses knew how important the juniors were in God’s Era. Xianhai Shaoyu was already a headache to deal with, but who could have thought that the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion would have another possessor of the Royal Bloodline too?

Should this be true, Jie Tian’s reputation would surely surpass that of Jie Ranqing’s. The juniors of the current generation were different from the preceding ones; none of them were pushovers. Even Long Chengyu would have easily been the strongest junior if put in any other era.

There was no doubt that the strongest junior in the current generation would go down in history.

The Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief had an ominous feeling about this matter, but he couldn’t be so petty as to show it. Instead, he burst into laughter and said, “It looks like there’ll be a rival for Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s Xianhai Shaoyu!”

“Xianhai Shaoyu?”

The Seven Realm Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master revealed a contemptuous smile, almost as if saying that the current strongest and most talented prodigy of the world of cultivation, Xianhai Shaoyu, wasn’t worth Jie Tian’s attention at all.
