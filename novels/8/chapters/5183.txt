Chapter 5183: The World Inside the Demon Coffin

“It’s the Demon Spirit King. I sent Xue Ji to the Demonic Spirit King!” Old Cat cried out.

“Who is the Demon Spirit King?” Chu Feng asked.

“It’s an evil spirit from the Demon Spirit World. Just like Xue Ji, he doesn’t have a master, but he’s able to roam freely in the world of cultivation due to his strength and unique constitution. He was interested in Xue Ji from the very first sight. While they weren’t from the same Spirit World, they could be said to be comrades in the same plight,” Old Cat said.

“That’s why you sold Xue Ji to him?” Chu Feng asked.

“Well… Yes, that’s right. Wait, no, that isn’t entirely the case either. That was also what Xue Ji wanted too!” Old Cat said.

“You’re saying that Xue Ji wanted to marry that Demon Spirit King?” Chu Feng asked incredulously.

“It’s true, I’m not lying to you! After getting to know each other, Xue Ji and I have become friends. If she wasn’t willing to marry the Demon Spirit King, I would have never entrusted her to him no matter how much money he gave me!” Old Cat exclaimed.

“Heh… Do you really expect me to believe those words?” Chu Feng sneered.

Old Cat was the kind of person who would utter anything that was advantageous to him according to the situation. It was only when he had the upper hand that he would arrogantly reveal the truth.

To be honest, Chu Feng wanted to give him a good pummeling before continuing the conversation, but he took a deep breath and composed himself.

He had no idea why he had lost his temper back there, but he knew that it would be unwise for him to make a move on Old Cat now since he didn’t have the Asura King to back him.

The moment Old Cat would found out that Chu Feng was no longer a match for him, it would surely make a move.

“Brother Chu Feng, you’re only saying that because you don’t know me well. I know that I might seem like an unprincipled cat who would do anything for money, but I am loyal to my friends.

“Take my disciple for example, he’s actually the child of a good friend. I visited that friend shortly after returning from the Ancestral Starfield, but a confrontation with a powerful enemy had left him with severe injuries. His days were already numbered. He told me to take care of his child, which is how I ended up taking that child in as my disciple.

“That day was the very first day I met that child. To be frank with you, I harbor no feelings for him at all. I only took him in as a disciple because that’s my old friend’s dying wish,” Old Cat said.

“Stop changing the topic. Tell me how powerful the Demon Spirit King is and when his marriage with Xue Ji is,” Chu Feng said coldly.

While he couldn’t come to blows with Old Cat, he still had to maintain a domineering attitude in order to remain in control of the situation.

“The Demon Spirit King is unfathomably strong. I don’t know what his current level of cultivation is, but I heard that a peak Half-God level cultivator has once confronted him but ended up getting killed. Some even say that he has already reached True God level.

“He’s a terrifying existence who stands at the top of the world of cultivation. Brother Chu Feng, I am not lying when I told you that he’s not a person we can mess with,” Old Cat said.

“Peak Half-God level… True God level?”

Chu Feng felt a heavy weight on his shoulders when he heard those words.

Dealing with a peak Half-God level cultivator was already a nightmare for him, but a True God level was completely beyond his reach. That was an existence that could drown him with a single spit.

Even if he had the backing of the Asura World Army, he still wouldn’t stand a chance against such an entity. That was not someone he could currently deal with. He never thought that he would encounter such a powerful enemy shortly after entering the Totem Galaxy.

It was no different from a newborn tiger challenging an adult grizzly to a fight. The outcome was already decided.

However, Chu Feng was not someone who feared danger, not to mention that he had a compelling reason to head there. He had to find out whether Xue Ji was marrying the Demon Spirit King out of her own volition.

It was one thing if she had willingly gone into the marriage, but if not, he would save her no matter how powerful the enemy was.

“Where’s the Demon Spirit King? When are they getting married?” Chu Feng asked.

“He’s in the True Dragon Starfield’s Demoncoffin Ordinary Realm, not too far away from here. You could make it there before the wedding if you rush over now, but Brother Chu Feng, you mustn’t tell anyone that I was the one who told you the location,” Old Cat said.

It manifested a map with his spirit power and handed it over to Chu Feng. With a single glance, Chu Feng could tell from the location that it was likely to be a private hideout. It was no wonder Old Cat was so hesitant to reveal Xue Ji’s location.

Chu Feng alternated his gaze between the map and Old Cat. He knew that Old Cat wasn’t one to be trusted, so he came to a decision.

“I don’t trust you. You’re coming with me,” Chu Feng said.

“Me? Not a chance in hell. I already told you what kind of person the Demon Spirit King is! I won’t stop you from looking for Xue Ji, but I don’t want to get involved in this matter. Brother Chu Feng, do some good this time and let me off, alright?”

Old Cat was so frightened that the tall figure it had conjured using his spirit power started trembling. It was truly afraid of the Demon Spirit King.

“I can’t trust your words. You just have to bring me there. Once I confirm Xue Ji is truly there, you and your disciple will be free to leave,” Chu Feng said.

“Really?” Old Cat asked.

“Yes,” Chu Feng replied.

“Good. Let my disciple go first. We’ll accompany you to the Demoncoffin Ordinary Realm,” Old Cat said.

“You must think that I’m a fool. If I return your disciple right now, you’ll flee as soon as you get a chance. I, Chu Feng, don’t fall for the same trick twice. You’ll be coming with me alone. As long as you haven’t lied to me, I’ll tell you where I have imprisoned your disciple.

“Rest assured. Your disciple will be safe as long as you don’t play any tricks. Conversely, if you dare to take me for a fool, your disciple will be the one paying the price,” Chu Feng threatened.

“Brother Chu Feng, there’s no way I would lie to you! To be honest, you’re the type of person I’d want to befriend. I know that I have done you an injustice in the past and I want to make up for it. You can be certain that I’ll never lie to you ever again!” Old Cat said.

“Shut your trap and lead the way,” Chu Feng said.

“You should at least let me meet my disciple. What if he’s dead? I mean, I can’t even sense him with my protective formation anymore.” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Old Cat finally revealed its worries. As expected, it had been secretly attempting to communicate with young master Wolf. It was fortunate that Chu Feng was prepared for that and had severed the connection between Old Cat and the protective formation in advance.

“Don’t worry, I’m not as despicable as you. Your disciple is safe. Hurry up and lead the way. You’re starting to wear my patience thin,” Chu Feng said domineeringly.

As reluctant as Old Cat was, it could only lead the way for Chu Feng.

Just like that, the two of them embarked on their journey to Demoncoffin Ordinary Realm. It was interesting how he had just left True Dragon Starfield not too long ago, only to return there now.

“Why is that place called Demoncoffin Ordinary Realm? It doesn’t sound auspicious,” Chu Feng asked out of curiosity.

“Demoncoffin Ordinary Realm has an incredible history behind it.”

This conversation piqued Old Cat’s excitement, and it started to share the story with Chu Feng.

While the sizes of each realm varied, most of them were spherical in shape. Some were elliptical, but those were rare.

However, just like how there were highly talented cultivators that broke established norms, there were also unique realms too. The Demoncoffin Ordinary Realm was one such unique realm. Instead of being spherical in shape, it was a cuboid.

“That’s not all. Looking from afar, the Demoncoffin Ordinary Realm appeared to be delicately sculpted. No matter how one looks at it, it resembles a single object.”

Old Cat made a dramatic pause here.

“A coffin?” Chu Feng asked.

“That’s right, a coffin. Just imagine it, a coffin so huge that it became a realm of its own! However, you’ll be mistaken if you think of it as nothing more than a huge coffin. It often emanates sinister blue and purple gaseous flames that resemble demonic aura. That’s also how its name came about,” Old Cat said.

“You’re saying that the Demoncoffin Ordinary Realm is a realm located on a coffin? Isn’t that inauspicious?” Chu Feng asked.

“Inauspicious is an understatement. There are rumors that a humongous demon was sealed inside the Demoncoffin Ordinary Realm. Countless would be killed if it was ever released.”

Old Cat switched to a hoarse and vigilant tone, reminiscent of a prophet foretelling a frightening future.
