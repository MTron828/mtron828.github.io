Chapter 4282 - Plan

“The Holy Light Clan is not qualified?”

Not only was Chu Feng astonished to hear those words, even Yu Ting was astonished.

Although she was a disciple of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, she still knew that the ruler of the Holy Light Galaxy was the Holy Light Clan.

Since they’re the ruler, they must be the strongest power in the Holy Light Galaxy.

Not even she knew that the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect was so powerful to not even give face to the Holy Light Clan.

“Master, in that case, it would mean that the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect has grown so powerful that they do not even fear the Holy Light Clan?” asked Chu Feng.

Chu Feng felt pressure.

Since the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect was planning to harm Zi Ling, it would mean that they’re his enemy.

If the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect was truly that powerful, it was most definitely not good news for Chu Feng.

“This old man doesn’t know if the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect fears the Holy Light Clan.”

“However, the strength of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect could always be described with a single word.”

Hearing that, Chu Feng immediately asked, “What word?”

“Unfathomable,” said Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“Unfathomable?!”

Hearing that description, Chu Feng felt even more uneasy.

After all, compared to a power that one already knew the strength of, a power that was unfathomable was even more dangerous.

But, even though that was the case, Chu Feng still didn’t give up.

“Master, could you bring me over to check out the teleportation formation that could allow one to enter the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect?” asked Chu Feng.

“Chu Feng, your master I will not lie to you.”

“Unless you become a rank four Utmost Exalted, you wouldn’t even be qualified to enter that spirit formation.”

“Furthermore, the cultivation of rank four Utmost Exalted is only the bare minimum required to enter it. It does not mean that you will be able to come out unscathed.”

“As your master, I do not agree for you to go there.”

“No matter how capable you are, this old man felt that you will need the cultivation of at least rank seven Utmost Exalted to challenge that spirit formation,” said Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“Master, in that case, do you know of any method to quickly increase one’s cultivation?” asked Chu Feng.

“If I knew of a method to quickly increase one’s cultivation, I wouldn’t be unable to take my revenge even now,” Ox-nosed Old Daoist had a wry smile on his face as he said those words.

Hearing that, Chu Feng felt very helpless. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

He knew that he was being too anxious and rushing to get things done.

How could there possibly be shortcuts in the path of martial cultivation?

If there were really shortcuts, his father wouldn’t have had him learn through experience on his own.

“Chu Feng, Yu Ting, the two of you don’t have to worry too much.”

“This old man had met the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s Sectmaster before.”

“According to my understanding of her, she possesses an exceptionally good nature and is someone who treasures talents a whole lot.”

“Since that Zi Ling girl was able to become her personal disciple, it is obvious how highly the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s Sectmaster regarded her as.”

“The way I see it, she’s only teaching that Zi Ling girl a lesson. She will not take her life.”

“Perhaps by the time the two of you entered the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, that Zi Ling would’ve already been released and returned to becoming a top figure in the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect.”

“It might even be possible for the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s Sectmaster to agree to having Zi Ling leave the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect to find you,” said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“Senior, are you really certain that our Lady Sectmaster is that sensible?”

“Would Lady Sectmaster really be willing to release Zi Ling?”

The reason why Yu Ting asked that was because the Lady Sectmaster she knew was a cold-hearted and emotionless person.

She was someone that all the disciples and elders of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect feared from the bottom of their hearts.

The description ‘sensible’ was practically unseen on their Lady Sectmaster.

“Little girl, while you might be a disciple of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, your understanding of your Lady Sectmaster might not necessarily be better than this old man.”

“Trust this old man. My judgement cannot be wrong. Your Lady Sectmaster is most definitely someone who cherishes talents.”

“Unless that girl Zi Ling really did something that she was unable to tolerate, she will not take her life.”

“The fact that that Zi Ling girl is still alive right now meant that things are not that serious,” said Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

Hearing those words, Yu Ting felt what the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said to be rather reasonable.

Even though the Lady Sectmaster in her impression was someone very cold, she agrees that her Lady Sectmaster was someone who values talented individuals.

Truth is, Yu Ting also knew that Zi Ling will not be in fatal danger for the time being.

But, she was still worried about what sort of torment Zi Ling will endure being imprisoned in a place like that. That was also the reason why she was so pained.

Seeing how anxious Chu Feng looked, Yu Ting felt very guilty.

After all, if she didn’t come to seek out Chu Feng, he wouldn’t be in such pressure.

Of course, Yu Ting didn’t care about all that at the beginning. She didn’t care about Chu Feng’s life and death at all. All she cared about was Zi Ling’s safety.

But, after interacting with Chu Feng, Yu Ting gained a new opinion of him.

Even though they’ve only interacted with each other for a short period of time, Yu Ting had realized why Zi Ling loved Chu Feng so dearly.

Chu Feng does possess aspects superior to other people. It was not only his talent. He also possessed a charisma that was unpresent in others.

Even Yu Ting began to subconsciously consider Chu Feng to be a close friend.

“Chu Feng, I feel what your master said to be very correct.”

“Saving Zi Ling is indeed not something that could be accomplished in a rush.”

“As I’ve told you before, while Zi Ling is imprisoned in the Land of Abandonment, she’s only imprisoned there. Lady Sectmaster never mentioned any desire to take Zi Ling’s life.”

“Furthermore, Lady Sectmaster was indeed very fond of Zi Ling. Her fondness toward Zi Ling far surpassed that of any other disciple.”

“As such, you don’t have to be too anxious in saving Zi Ling. Else, you’ll end up harming yourself. If that is to happen, Zi Ling would feel very sad too,” Yu Ting actually comforted Chu Feng.

“Chu Feng, your master I know that, with your personality, you will likely only be at ease by seeing Zi Ling being fine with your very eyes.”

“But, Chu Feng, you’re a smart child. You knew that you cannot rush this matter. Thus, calm yourself and steadily increase your cultivation. That is the best method to save Zi Ling.”

“Furthermore, Zi Ling is currently the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s Sectmaster’s personal disciple.”

“According to my understanding of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s Sectmaster, she will not be willing to hand Zi Ling to you if you’re not an outstanding person of the younger generation yourself.”

“You understand what I mean by that?” asked the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“I understand.”

“You all don’t have to worry for me. I will definitely stand before Zi Ling in my best condition,” said Chu Feng.

Following that, Chu Feng no longer continued to twist himself in this matter.

His plan was extremely clear. He needed to quickly increase his cultivation.

But, he will not wait till rank seven Utmost Exalted to challenge the spirit formation like the Ox-nosed Old Daoist suggested.

Since rank four Utmost Exalted was the qualification that was needed, Chu Feng will challenge it at rank four Utmost Exalted.

He was not concerned about dangers. He only cared about Zi Ling.

On their way to the Reincarnation Upper Realm, Chu Feng inquired the Ox-nosed Old Daoist about what happened back then.

Ox-nosed Old Daoist did not conceal what happened back then.

The course of events was as Chu Feng heard.

The reason why the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was defeated back then was indeed because he was poisoned.

Furthermore, even now, Ox-nosed Old Daoist had not been able to find the person who poisoned him.
