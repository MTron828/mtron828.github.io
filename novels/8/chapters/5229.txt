Chapter 5229: Extraordinary Land

There were still a few days before the junior hunting competition, so Chu Feng wasn’t in a rush to make a move. Since he was already here, he decided to first visit the hideout where Song Yuwei and the others would be staying.

While the Spirit Beast Upper Realm was known for the mountain valley filled with spirit beasts, it was also one of the more prosperous Upper Realms. There were many powerful clans and sects based here.

In terms of land mass, it was at least dozens of times larger than the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.

The Ancient Era’s secret realm was located in the Golden Dragon Mountain Range, which was named after the region’s golden landscape. Be it its land, rocks, grass, or even trees, they were all golden in color.

There were a diverse range of vicious beasts dwelling in this mountain range. They were unintelligent but fairly strong, ranging from Utmost Exalted level to Martial Exalted level. Interestingly, all of them had a golden exterior.

But other than that, there were no treasures or precious herbs to be found on the Golden Dragon Mountain Range, which led to its abandonment many years back.

However, Bitter Remembrance happened to stumble upon an Ancient Era’s forbidden land here.

Traveling to the golden mountain range by air, Chu Feng couldn’t help but think that the undulating golden mountain range resembled a massive golden dragon lying at rest. It looked both beautiful and majestic.

“Is there really nothing on this mountain range at all?” Milady Queen asked.

Even she couldn’t help but think that there had to be treasures hidden in a place like that.

“It doesn’t seem like there is anything here.”

Chu Feng had already used his Heaven’s Eyes to scan the surroundings, but he was unable to find anything at all.

“There aren't any signs of treasure on this mountain range. It sure is weird,” Lord Yuwei remarked.

She was also observing the surroundings with her means but to no avail.

Chu Feng took out the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk, but the latter didn’t offer him any guidance whatsoever.

“Young master Chu Feng, that horsetail whisk of yours seems to be a formidable treasure.”

Bitter Remembrance’s eyes lit up upon seeing the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk.

“Elder Bitter Remembrance, you’re able to see through the prowess of my horsetail whisk?” Chu Feng asked in surprise.

The Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk was indeed a formidable treasure, but it wasn’t showing its true prowess now, not to mention that Chu Feng had intentionally masked its true nature. The fact that Bitter Remembrance was able to see through it was indicative of his sharp eyes.

“I can’t discern the intricacies, but I can at least tell that it’s made out of extraordinary materials. I might not be a highly accomplished world spiritist, but my eyes are still fairly sharp. Otherwise,I wouldn’t have been able to find this Ancient Era’s forbidden land.

“There were quite a few powerhouses who explored the Golden Dragon Mountain Range in the earlier phases of the current era, but they weren’t able to find any treasures or natural oddities here,” Bitter Remembrance said.

“The powerhouses of the Totem Galaxy didn’t discover the Ancient Era’s secret realm?” Chu Feng asked.

“I don’t have an answer to that question, but even if a powerhouse did discover the secret realm, it’s unlikely that they would have been able to get in without knowing the proper way of entering the secret realm. Even I have only uncovered it by a stroke of luck,” Bitter Remembrance said.

“Elder Bitter Remembrance, please lead the way forward. I’m getting increasingly curious about the Ancient Era’s forbidden land you speak of,” Chu Feng said.

He initially thought that it was nothing more than an abandoned Ancient Era’s secret realm, but after seeing how extraordinary the Golden Dragon Mountain Range was, he found it hard to believe that a secret realm located here would be ordinary.

“Let’s go.”

Bitter Remembrance led the way forward

Soon, they descended from the sky and landed on one of the mountains. They could hear furious roars and the sounds of battle in the distance, but Chu Feng and the others weren’t worried at all. These vicious beasts didn’t pose a threat to them.

The group walked down a winding path and soon arrived at a cavern in the depths of the mountain range. The cavern was small and shallow, and there was nothing peculiar about it.

Bitter Remembrance began forming a hand seal that clearly originated from the Ancient Era. Seeing that, Chu Feng and the others quickly copied his movements.

According to Bitter Remembrance’s instructions, they had to quickly enter and leave the cavern thrice with the hand seal, repeat the process with slower footsteps, and finally do it one last time with footsteps of interchanging speed. Then, by releasing the hand seal and entering the cavern once more, they would be brought to the Ancient Era’s secret realm.

Chu Feng and the others did as they were told, and they suddenly found the cavern becoming much deeper than before. They ventured forward and soon spotted traces of light ahead.

“What a formidable formation,” Chu Feng exclaimed.

He had been closely observing the cavern while following Bitter Remembrance’s instructions, but he didn’t sense the slightest spirit power from the cavern, let alone a formation. There was no doubt in his mind that a formation was responsible for this phenomenon, just that it was so advanced that he couldn’t sense it at all.

Beyond the cavern was a mountain valley that was large enough to hold over a thousand palaces. What was worth noting was that the greenery in this mountain valley was no longer golden but green. The flowers also came in a variety of colors.

Butterflies danced amidst the flowers. Birds clustered on the trees. Wild rabbits chased one another. It was a much more harmonious sight compared to the monotonous golden outside.

“Were you the one who constructed this garden, Elder Bitter Remembrance?” Chu Feng asked.

He could sense the aura of the Ancient Era from the golden cavern walls, but the aura didn’t seep into the animals, trees, and flowers. This indicated that they were brought in afterward.

“You have sharp eyes, young hero Chu Feng. Indeed, I was the one who constructed this garden here. This mountain valley was completely golden too before I stumbled upon this place. I thought that this would be the place where I would want to go into seclusion in the future, so I planted a few seeds and brought in a few animals to liven the place up.

“None of what you saw before you is a formation. They are real trees and animals that have formed their own ecosystem over the years,” Bitter Remembrance replied gleefully.

He felt much more accomplished having organically cultivated these trees and animals than constructing them with his spirit power.

“Master Bitter Remembrance, where are we going to stay?” Yue Ling asked with a smile.

She was delighted to be able to live at such a beautiful place. The change in environment had considerably cleared up the gloom on her face ever since learning about her father’s betrayal.

“Yue Ling, this mountain valley is ours. You can live wherever you want to. Choose a spot you like and tell me. I’ll personally construct a hut and garden you like,” Bitter Remembrance said.

“Thank you, Master Bitter Remembrance!” Yue Ling replied with an excited nod. She grabbed Song Yuwei’s hand and said, “Master Yuwei, let’s choose a place together!”

“Let’s go,” Song Yuwei replied with a smile.

The two ladies dove into the depths of the mountain valley to explore the area.

“Elder, how did you find this place?” Chu Feng asked.

While Yue Ling and the others were looking to settle down, Chu Feng was more concerned about the Ancient Era’s secret realm itself.

Unexpectedly, Bitter Remembrance revealed a conflicted look upon hearing the question.

“Elder, please ignore my question if it isn’t convenient for you to answer it,” Chu Feng replied.

He had no intention of making things hard for Bitter Remembrance. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Young master Chu Feng, it’s truly by coincidence that I have stumbled upon this place, but I’m afraid that it’s inconvenient for me to share the details with you. I hope that you can understand that,” Bitter Remembrance clasped his fist as he replied.

“I understand, elder. May I look around too? Would it be fine if I investigate deeper if I discover anything amiss?” Chu Feng asked.

This secret realm was discovered by Bitter Remembrance, after all. No matter how curious he was, he wouldn’t mess around without the other party’s permission.
