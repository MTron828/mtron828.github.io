Chapter 4521: I Might Accidentally Kill You

Gah!

A tragic cry echoed loudly before the entrance of the Locksoul Sect, but strangely enough, those further outside of the Locksoul Sect weren’t able to hear a thing at all.

A layer of mist had sealed off the Locksoul Sect from the world. Just like a barrier, it concealed one’s vision, hindered sounds, and prevented certain people from coming into the vicinity.

This mist continued for linger for several days.

As time went by, the disciples and elders who had returned from their mission began to gather outside the entrance, bewildered as to why they weren’t able to enter their sect at all.

At the same time, visiting guests were also starting to gather.

News of Hun Lei and Hun Yong’s death had already spread far and wide, and there were many people who wanted to know how the Locksoul Sect would respond to it. As such, the crowds gathered only continued to grow.

Without an exception, none of them were able to enter the Locksoul Sect at all.

“What’s going on here? Why can’t we enter the Locksoul Sect?”

Faced with this situation, the crowd was intrigued as to where this mist had come from. Since they were unable to enter the Locksoul Sect, they could only speculate what was going on from the entrance.

“Hey, look over there! The energy seems to be fading!” someone from the crowd suddenly shouted.

Just as he had said, a portion of the mist that was preventing them from peering into the Locksoul Sect had finally dissipated a little.

And upon seeing what was within, a lot of different emotions appeared on the faces of the crowd.

Some of them nervous, some of them looked agitated, but most of them looked horrified.

“My gosh, how did something like this happen?!”

A revolting sight unfolded before the eyes of the crowd as the mist faded, leaving everyone utterly stunned.

Those who were gutsier were still able to barely hold back their revulsion, but those who were timider immediately turned tail and fled, and some of them even fainted on the spot.

There were also some who fell on the ground and began to retch.

And the disciples and elders of the Locksoul Sect began to wail in agony as they shook their head in disbelief at what they were seeing. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Locksoul Sect itself was still intact, but the same couldn’t be said about its people. Corpses were littered all around the place, but they were decimated to an extent where it was already impossible to tell who was who anymore.

Bits of fleshes could be seen everywhere, and there were limbs that had been torn off with sheer brute force.

It was an extremely wretched sight. Even horrifying wouldn’t be enough to describe the scene that was sitting before them.

“How could this happen? Who’s the one who did it? Is it that Chu Feng? Or is it the two burglars?”

No one knew that the culprit behind this was Song Yun, and instead, they pinned this matter on Chu Feng.

From the moment that Chu Feng killed Hun Lei and Hun Yong back at the Conquerstar Mountain Villa, the grudge between them was already irreconcilable. It wouldn’t be surprising if Chu Feng had chosen to strike first.

“As expected, that background of that genius is really extraordinary. On top of destroying the Conquerstar Mountain Villa, he even managed to massacre the Locksoul Sect!

“The world of cultivators is indeed filled with countless experts. It would be best to keep a low profile, or else it could spell a calamity if we were to accidentally offend some formidable fellow out there!”

There was no one who blamed Chu Feng for doing this. Instead, they felt deference toward him.

Unless they didn’t want their heads anymore, how could they dare to pin blame on a person who was able to wreak havoc upon the Locksoul Sect?

What the crowd didn’t know was that not only was the culprit not Chu Feng, but the real culprit was still within this world, and she was currently not too far away from the Locksoul Sect.

...

In a forest several hundred kilometers away from the Locksoul Sect stood two beautiful figures—Song Yun and Song Xue’er.

It had been several days since they had come here; there was no way slaughtering a mere Locksoul Sect would have taken them so much time, after all.

Song Xue’er was lying on a hammock leisurely whereas Song Yun was sitting on the ground with her eyes closed.

Song Yun was currently cultivating. After massacring the Locksoul Sect, she immediately headed over here and started to cultivate.

So far, she had already cultivated for a few days.

It was then when Song Xue’er suddenly sprung to her feet and looked at Song Yun with an intense look.

Certain changes were occurring to Song Yun at the moment. A black mark had appeared on Song Yun’s forehead, and this black mark was emanating black aura.

And astonishingly, this mark was actually identical to that of the Conquerstar Demon Flower.

It was just that this black mark only appeared for a brief instant before disappearing once more.

When it finally disappeared, Song Yun opened her eyes once more.

“Yun’er, how is it? Did you succeed?” Song Xue’er walked up and asked with a joyful smile.

“You can put it that way,” Song Yun replied as her lips inched upward to form a sweet smile.

Her clear eyes, youthful face, and sweet smile brought out the vibrance of a young girl to the fullest extent. It would be hard to imagine that such a beautiful young lady was actually be culprit who massacred the Locksoul Sect.

“You sure are incredible. To think that you would use Chu Feng to obtain the Conquerstar Demon Flower!” Song Xue’er said.

As it turned out, the Conquerstar Demon Flower didn’t vanish abruptly from Chu Feng’s body, but rather, it was Song Yun who retrieved it from him.

Song Yun’s earlier cultivation was also to assimilate the Conquerstar Demon Flower into her body, and it was due to the successful assimilation that the black imprint appeared on her forehead earlier.

“I’m not making use of him. I wanted to help him too. If not for me, how could he have managed to raise his cultivation by a rank so successfully?” Song Yun replied.

“Didn’t you get him to do it because you were worried that you would face some difficulties retrieving the Conquerstar Demon Flower?” Song Xue’er asked.

“Of course not! How could I possibly hurt a man whom I like so much?” Song Yun replied matter-of-factly.

“Yun’er... you really like him? But he isn’t worthy of you!” Song Xue’er said.

“Big sister, why do I feel like you have strong objections toward a relationship between me and big brother Chu Feng? Could it be that you like him? I do know that you have some history with him in the past,” Song Yun asked with narrowed eyes.

“That’s impossible. How could I possibly like him?” Song Xue’er shook her head in response.

Hearing those words, a smile blossomed on Song Yun’s lips as she said joyfully, “That’s good. It’s all good as long as you don’t like him! Otherwise, if you try to snatch him away from me, I might just forget about our bond as sisters and kill you. Heh.”
