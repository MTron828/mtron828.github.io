Chapter 5795: Why Corner Him

Boom!

The nine-colored lightning enveloping the sky fused together with the nine-colored lightning shrouding Chu Feng. The world shook, as an aura that shouldn’t have belonged to someone of Chu Feng’s cultivation level swept imposingly across the land.

“What’s going on? Is that the power of the Genesis Bloodline?”

“That should be the Heavenly Lightning Bloodline, but why is it emanating such a powerful aura?”

“Chu Feng shouldn’t be this powerful, right?”

The crowd struggled to understand how Chu Feng was emanating such terrifying power.

“This feeling… His bloodline went berserk,” Song Changsheng, who was observing the situation from outside the realm, murmured.

He could tell that it was Chu Feng’s power with a single glance, and his eyes turned grim. He didn’t know whether he should intervene in this situation or not.

“How is Chu Feng emanating such a powerful aura?” Those from the Divine Body Heavenly Mansion were confused too.

“His bloodline went berserk,” the Divine Body Heavenly Mansion’s Mansion Master replied.

“What?”

The experts from the Divine Body Heavenly Mansion were taken aback.

There were many different bloodline powers in this world, and their prowess could vary greatly from one to the other. Those blessed with powerful bloodlines could find their bloodlines going berserk under certain circumstances, such as when their emotions were running amok.

Those whose bloodlines went berserk would be able to exert strength beyond their cultivation level, but they would lose consciousness and become a slaughtering monster.

However, it was rare for such a situation to happen. Since the Ancient Era, there had only been three people whose bloodlines had gone berserk, and they were incredibly powerful individuals.

Of course, it wouldn’t be surprising for someone of Chu Feng’s talent to face such a situation, but the strength he was displaying was simply too powerful. It far surpassed what a junior could normally exert, and it was still becoming stronger with each passing second.

“Relay my order. Have everyone from our Divine Body Heavenly Mansion retreat a safe distance away,” the Divine Body Heavenly Mansion’s Mansion Master said.

The experts of the Divine Body Heavenly Mansion quickly carried out his orders.

The other powerhouses such as the Immortal Sea Fish Clan and the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect had come to the same conclusion and did the same as well. The crowd quickly made their retreat, causing the surroundings to suddenly become empty.

Only a single power stayed put—the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. They erected protective and slaughter formations as they waited for Chu Feng to make his move.

“Lord Mansion Master!”

Even so, the experts from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion panicked upon sensing Chu Feng’s strength. All of them were late True Dragon World Spiritists, so none of them were weak by any means, but the oppressive might Chu Feng exerted stoked their unease.

The power Chu Feng exerted could easily obliterate them.

“Don’t worry. He’ll step away from that formation at this rate. As soon as that happens, I’ll subdue him,” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master said as he hoped that Chu Feng would step out of the Nine Heavens’ Zenith’s formation.

“Calm down, Chu Feng,” a foreign elder’s voice echoed in Chu Feng’s ears.

This voice was not just a simple voice transmission; it harnessed tremendous spirit power that snapped sanity back into Chu Feng’s mind.

“At this rate, you’ll ruin the Nine Heavens’ Zenith’s formation and put yourself at risk of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s attacks. Don’t be agitated by Jie Tianran. Your mother’s bloodline hasn’t been stolen,” the elder said one more.

“W-who are you? How do you know my mother’s bloodline hasn’t been taken?” Chu Feng asked.

“It’s a trap. Don’t fall for it,” the elder’s voice said, but his voice was becoming softer as if his voice transmission was being obstructed.

The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master noticed that Chu Feng hadn’t launched his attack despite some time passing, and instead, his bloodline berserk condition seemed to be alleviating. This brought a frown to his face. He quickly sent a voice transmission to the elders of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, saying, “Agitate him. Make him attack us.”

“Chu Feng, I was also involved in taking away Jie Ranqing’s bloodline. Do you dare to touch me now that I’m standing before you?”

“Ah, I can still vividly remember Jie Ranqing’s cries of agony as she was being stripped of her bloodline.”Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“A star has fallen just like that. You little trash made her lose everything.”

All kinds of jarring voices filled the sky. Some of them even spoke depraved words unbecoming of their reputation to agitate Chu Feng.

“They deserve to die,” Little Fishy coldly muttered.

She couldn’t see those from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion from the Ancient Hall, but she could hear their voices, and that was enough to induce her killing intent. She would have charged at them if she could leave this place.

Xianhai Shaoyu, Long Chengyu, Xian Miaomiao, and the others didn’t utter a word, but their eyes were blazing with fury. They had always known that it wasn’t easy for Chu Feng to come this far, though they didn’t know the difficulties he had been through.

It was only now that they had a glimpse into Chu Feng’s suffering, but even so, this was only the tip of the iceberg. As his friends, how could they not be incensed?

…

Meanwhile, the Immortal Sea Fish Clansmen, including Little Fishy’s parents, had retreated a safe distance away, but they were still using their means to observe Chu Feng.

“They are trying to agitate Chu Feng even though he’s emitting a terrifying aura? Are they not afraid of death?” Little Fishy’s mother failed to grasp what the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion was getting at.

“Jie Tianran doesn’t do things he isn’t confident about. He’s doing it intentionally,” the Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“Is he intentionally agitating Chu Feng to make his bloodline go berserk before making their escape? Are they trying to ruin Chu Feng through the backlash of his berserk bloodline? That’s despicable! He’s only a child, and he hasn’t done anything wrong. Do they have to corner him?” Little Fishy’s mother was enraged.

She wasn’t close to Chu Feng, but as a mother, she felt aggrieved to see a junior like Chu Feng being bullied like that.
