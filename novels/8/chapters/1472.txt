MGA: Chapter 1473 - Living Demon

“You’re the one who’s going to die!”

A disciple of the Cursed Soil Sect attacked. His movements were very peculiar. He was moving about like a cheetah. His hands were very strong; it was as if they were a pair of tiger claws. As for his body, it was in a very strange form, much like that of a crane. It was a martial skill, one that was at least rank eight.

Unfortunately, even though he had mastered this martial skill and he possessed the same cultivation as Chu Feng, a rank six Martial King, the difference between their battle power was truly too enormous.

“Bang~~~~”

Chu Feng did not counterattack. Instead, he merely stamped his foot on the ground. Following that, a wave of air surged forth and landed on that Cursed Soil Sect disciple’s body.

“Crackle, crackle~~~”

In an instant, crisp snapping sounds began to be heard from that disciple’s body. At the time when he fell to the ground, not only was he bleeding from his eyes, ears, nostrils and mouth, his veins and meridians were also snapped apart. He was now completely covered in blood.

“Bastard!”

Another one of the Cursed Soil Sect’s disciples started to attack Chu Feng. This disciple was a rank seven Martial King, a level higher than Chu Feng. This disciple was absolutely certain that he would be able to defeat Chu Feng.

Using a movement martial skill, this disciple arrived before Chu Feng in an instant. His five fingers clenched into a fist and then he stuck his middle finger out. This was a martial skill with all of its power focused on the middle finger. If one was struck by this martial skill, even if one didn’t die, one would be crippled.

Furthermore, in order to increase the power of his attack, this Cursed Soil Sect’s disciple had even placed a vaguely visible talisman on his middle finger. This was the way the Cursed Soil Sect did things. They would use talismans to increase their battle power.

This Cursed Soil Sect’s disciple had aimed his fist at Chu Feng’s dantian. He was planning to cripple Chu Feng’s cultivation. One must admit, he was extremely ruthless.

“Puttchh~~~”

“Ahhh~~~~”

However, before his fist could hit Chu Feng, he screamed out loud. It turned out that his dantian had been pierced. Chu Feng had pierced through his dantian. Chu Feng’s hand was like a sword. Not only did it completely pierce through this Cursed Soil Sect disciple’s dantian, it was also not covered with blood at all when Chu Feng pulled it out. It was as if Chu Feng’s hand was a treasured sword that could not be tainted.

“Paaa~~~”

After crippling that Cursed Soil Sect’s disciple, Chu Feng ruthlessly slapped him several meters away. Like a sandbag, that disciple smashed into a large tree before falling to the ground, where he lost consciousness.

“Next!” Chu Feng said with a very clear voice. His tone was filled with contempt. It was as if the Cursed Soil Sect’s disciples before him were not people and were instead pigs, sheeps, ducks and geese, merely a bunch of livestock waiting to be slaughtered. If he wished to kill them, he would be able to do so with ease.

“You...”

Seeing this and hearing what Chu Feng said, the remaining dozen-plus disciples of the Cursed Soil Sect started to gnash their teeth in anger. They wanted to swarm at Chu Feng and kill him.

“Stop.” However, a shout was suddenly heard. This voice stopped all of the disciples. It was Yan Gui.

“I’ve underestimated you,” Yan Gui said.

“You’re not the first to say those words,” Chu Feng said with a light smile.

“Even if you possess the battle power to surmount a cultivation three levels above your own, your cultivation is still only that of a rank six Martial King. At the very most, you can contend against ordinary rank nine Martial Kings.”

“Yet, among us here, the number of people capable of contending against Half Martial Emperors is no small number. Did you truly think that you would be able to win against us?” Yan Gui said.

“If I were to tell you that even if all of you are to come at me together, you would not be a match for me, would you all believe that?” Chu Feng asked.

“Hahahaha...” Once Chu Feng said those words, Yan Gui and the other disciples all burst into loud laughter. The way they saw it, Chu Feng was cracking jokes.

It was as if a monkey was telling a pack of wolves that he would be able to eat all of them. It was extremely unrealistic, and ridiculous enough to cause one to die from excessive laughter.

“Woosh~~~”

Right at this moment, a ray of light flashed past. It was as if something had arrived between them.

Upon closer inspection, the Cursed Soil Sect’s disciples were all startled. It was actually Chu Feng! Chu Feng had arrived between them. Furthermore, he had a strange smile on his face.

“All of you, get on the floor.”

Suddenly, Chu Feng raised his hand and a golden light shot through the sky, turning into a golden cloud.

That cloud was flickering with golden radiance and had runes and seals roaming through it. As it suddenly fell upon the crowd, an enormous pressure also dropped from the sky.

“Boom~~~~~~”

In an instant, all of the Cursed Soil Sect’s disciples, including even Yan Gui, were lying on their stomach like dying dogs. They were unable to move in the slightest.

“Do you all believe me now?” Chu Feng asked.

“You, exactly what sort of monster are you?” One of the Cursed Soil Sect’s disciples was deeply frightened. Even the tone of his voice had changed. Never had he even thought that Chu Feng would be this powerful.

However, it was clear that his cultivation was that of a rank six Martial King. For a rank six Martial King to be able to do something like this, other than a monster, this Cursed Soil Sect’s disciple could not think of a different possibility.

“Buzz~~~~”

Chu Feng made a grasping motion with one hand, and a sword formed from martial power appeared in his hand. Ruthlessly, he thrust that sword down into that disciple’s left shoulder. “Puu,” the sword pierced into that disciple’s shoulder.

“I’ll ask and you all will answer. If you say anything extra, do not blame me for being ruthless,” Chu Feng’s tone was ice-cold and filled with killing intent. He was not joking around.

The disciples of the Cursed Soil Sect were all able to sense that Chu Feng was not joking around. While one might be able to lie with words, one’s killing intent would definitely not lie. Especially for Chu Feng’s killing intent, it was something that he had tempered through countless massacres. This was definitely not fake. Furthermore, as the disciples of the Cursed Soil Sect were also people who had embarked on the path of slaughter, they knew with even more certainty how real Chu Feng’s killing intent was.

Thus, the disciples of the Cursed Soil Sect were able to imagine how frightening Chu Feng was, and that his hands must have been tainted with the blood of countless people. He was a fiend who had killed countless times without even blinking an eye. He was a true cold-blooded murderer.

Thus, they knew that Chu Feng would do what he said he would do, and would really kill them if they dared to say anything more than he asked. Thus, even Yan Gui did not dare to say anything. Like frightened birds, they shivered while lying on the ground.

“Who among you all, are the Cursed Soil Seven?” Chu Feng asked.

“This...” Those words startled all of the Cursed Soil Sect’s disciples. Especially Yan Gui, whose expression turned unnatural. However, no one was willing to say anything.

“Woosh~~~”

Chu Feng waved his arm. His sword that was on the shoulder of that disciple followed the motion of his arm and sliced all the way down to the dantian area. That disciple’s dantian was completely sliced apart by Chu Feng.

“Ahhh~~~~” That disciple uttered a miserable scream. His scream was not because of the pain that he was feeling. Rather, it was because the cultivation that he had trained for many years was currently evaporating away. At this time, he felt that living was more miserable than dying. [1. Dantian is located below the abdomen... so... Chu Feng’s sword went from shoulder to abdomen, shouldn’t that disciple die now since he no longer has cultivation to heal? I guess Chu Feng did not pierce his sword all the way through to cut the organs?]

After that, Chu Feng pointed his sword to another disciple and thrust it into that disciple’s body. Then, he threatened, “Tell me now. Else, your end will be the same as him.”

“Please don’t, please don’t cripple my cultivation. I’ll tell you, I’ll tell you...” That disciple did not dare to resist. He turned his gaze to three people. Then, he started to cry in pain.

That was because the three people that he looked to, although they were not all the strongest among all of them, they were the three with the most extraordinary status.

Among them, one was their Cursed Soil Sect’s strongest disciple, Yan Gui, a rank nine Martial King.

As for the other two, Chu Feng did not know their names. However, one was a rank eight Martial King and the other was a rank seven Martial King.

After seeing these three people, Chu Feng started to smile... At the same time he started to smile, he also closed his eyes. Four faces appeared in his mind.

Jiang Qisha, Wu Kunlun, Zhao Yuetian and Kuang Bainian.

After these four appeared in the Eastern Sea Region, they created an enormous upheaval and became Chu Feng’s greatest enemies.

At the time when the four of them first appeared, Chu Feng felt an enormous pressure. The four of them were like four insurmountable walls. Before Chu Feng, they pressured him so hard that he found even breathing to be difficult.

As for the four of them, they were four of the seven personal disciples of the Cursed Soil Sect’s headmaster. Overall, the seven of them were known as the Cursed Soil Seven.

Back then, if it wasn’t for Lady Piaomiao lending Chu Feng her strength, it would have simply been impossible for Chu Feng to defeat Jiang Qisha and the others. At that time, Chu Feng had still been too small and weak.

Suddenly, Chu Feng opened his eyes and looked to Yan Gui and the other two again. At this time, the smile on his face grew even more dense.

These three people were also part of the Cursed Soil Seven. Each one of them were stronger than Jiang Qisha and the other three. Yet now, they were lying beneath Chu Feng’s feet like dying dogs. If Chu Feng wanted to kill them, it would be as easy as crushing ants.

Most importantly, this time around, Chu Feng had not borrowed strength from anyone else. He had relied... on only himself.

“Yan Gui, it would seem that you’re the head of the Cursed Soil Seven, right?” Chu Feng walked over to Yan Gui and asked.

“Chu Feng, it is not that I wanted to attack you. It was Qin Lingyun, he asked us to handle you.” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“That’s right, in my Cosmos Sack are the benefits that Qin Lingyun gave us. You can take that. No, take everything in my Cosmos Sack. Please, please let us go,” Yan Gui did not dare to answer Chu Feng’s question. Instead, he started to plead for forgiveness.

It was not that Yan Gui did not have moral backbone. Rather, it was because he was extremely afraid and filled with regret.

Before, he had thought that Chu Feng was a sheep that he could easily capture. However, he now discovered that instead of a sheep, Chu Feng was a fierce tiger. Even though they were hungry wolves, they were still extremely small and weak before Chu Feng. And now, they had all become Chu Feng’s meal.

Chu Feng smiled once again. He already knew that Yan Gui and the other disciples of the Cursed Soil Sect coming to attack him might be related to Qin Lingyun. However, never did he expect that to be really the case.

Chu Feng extended his arm and made a grabbing motion. All of their Cosmos Sacks were sucked into Chu Feng’s hand. After that, he casually placed them into his own Cosmos Sack without the slightest trace of guilt. It was as if all of these were his to begin with.

However, it was clear that Chu Feng did not plan to let them go just like this. He opened his palm, and another attractive force began to spread. Yan Gui was sucked into his hand.

Chu Feng held onto Yan Gui’s neck with one hand and held onto his sword with the other. Then, he pierced the sword into Yan Gui’s waist. The sword was only several centimeters from Yan Gui’s dantian.

“I’ll ask and you’ll answer. If you dare to hesitate in the slightest, if you dare to lie in the slightest, I’ll make your cultivation that you’ve spent the last thirty two years on turn into smoke.”

“It’s best that you speak truthfully. You should know that I will be able to see through your lies,” Lightning flickered in Chu Feng’s eyes; at that moment he was like a living demon that could see through everything.
