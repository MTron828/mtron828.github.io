Chapter 2364 - Revealing One’s Identity

“Husband, help me,” Zhao Hong said to Wang Qiang.

“Righto,” Although Wang Qiang had no idea what Zhao Hong planned to do, he still agreed to it immediately.

Then, Zhao Hong began to unleash her spirit power, and started setting up a spirit formation to contain all of the people from the Kong Heavenly Clan.

“You’re kidding! That woman, she’s actually an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist?!!!” Once Zhao Hong began to set up her spirit formation, the people of the younger generation present were all shocked. Even Kong Cheng’s expression changed enormously. Shock filled his face.

The reason for that was because they were already able to tell that Zhao Hong was an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist. Although she was only an Insect Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, it remained that she was an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist. In the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, Immortal-cloak World Spiritists were extremely rare existences. As such, how could they not be astonished?

Just when everyone was astonished, someone muttered in a mocking voice, “Humph, and here I thought we had encountered experts from the younger generation, but it turned out to be a senior-level expert bullying us from the younger generation.”

This reaction was understandable. The reason for that was because Chu Feng, Zhao Hong and Wang Qiang were concealing their appearances with conical bamboo hats the entire time. Thus, these people from the younger generation were simply unable to see their appearances. Furthermore, as Immortal-cloak World Spiritists were generally old monsters who had cultivated for a very long time, they automatically thought Zhao Hong to be an old monster.

“Bullying the younger generation? Humph, open your dog eyes and look carefully. My age is younger than all of yours,” Zhao Hong removed the conical bamboo hat from her head.

“This...” Upon seeing Zhao Hong’s appearance, the crowd were astonished again. Firstly, they were shocked by Zhao Hong’s appearance. They did not expect that the fiendish demon-like woman would be so beautiful.

However, most importantly, the people present all possessed their own means to differentiate someone’s age. Thus, they were able to get a rough estimate of Zhao Hong’s age. As such, they were certain that Zhao Hong was a member of the younger generation, that she was indeed not old.

However, a member of the younger generation was actually an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist. How could they not be astonished by this?

“A bunch of f-frogs at the bottom of the well,” Wang Qiang said mockingly. Then, he also took off the conical bamboo hat on his head. After that, he shouted, “W-wife, I’ll c-come help you.”

As Wang Qiang spoke, he also unleashed his spirit power and began to help Zhao Hong set up her spirit formation. Furthermore, Wang Qiang had a very proud expression on his face. Evidently, he was doing this deliberately.

“That stutterer is actually also an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist?” Sure enough, when the crowd saw the Immortal-level spirit power that Wang Qiang was releasing, they were all tongue-tied with shock. The astonishment they felt right now was even stronger than before.

One Immortal-cloak World Spiritist was shocking enough. For there to be two Immortal-cloak World Spiritists made them feel as if this was simply inconceivable.

Right at that moment, Chu Feng suddenly said, “Zhao Hong, there’s no need to kill them,”

The reason for that was because Chu Feng was able to tell how powerful the spirit formation Zhao Hong and Wang Qiang were setting up was. Chu Feng felt that there was a need to inform Zhao Hong to not kill them.

Although Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong already possessed some friction with the Kong Heavenly Clan, it remained that these people here were people of the younger generation, and that the matter of what had happened before was unrelated to them. Even if they ended up clashing today, it was Chu Feng and the others who had picked a fight with them first.

Thus, Chu Feng felt that teaching them a slight lesson for the sake of achieving his purpose would already suffice. He truly did not want to go as far as killing them.

“Chu Feng, you can rest assured. The spirit formation that I am setting up is definitely not what you are thinking,” Zhao Hong smiled lightly at Chu Feng. Then, she continued to set up her spirit formation. It was a very peculiar spirit formation.

After Zhao Hong finished setting up the core of her spirit formation, she first had her two world spirits enter it. Then, she activated the spirit formation.

“Buzz~~~:

After that spirit formation was activated, a boundless killing intent immediately swept forth. The spirit formation she had set up was a slaughtering formation. It was extremely powerful.

“Stop!!!”

“Don’t harm them!” Sensing that killing intent, Kong Cheng thought that Zhao Hong was planning to kill his clansmen,. and was immediately furious.

“As long as you listen to me obediently, they will not die,” Zhao Hong said to Kong Cheng.

“What do you want from me?” Kong Cheng asked.

“Enter that spirit formation core and stay there for four hours. After four hours, this spirit formation will disappear by itself. As that time, they will be able to come out unscathed.”

“However, if you are to leave that spirit formation core in the four hour time period, then I am sorry to say that they will die without an intact corpse,” Zhao Hong said with a beaming smile.

“You!!!” Kong Cheng felt a bit speechless. He did not expect Zhao Hong to use this sort of method to confine him. However, he still entered the spirit formation core with no hesitation. The reason for that was because compared to what he had in mind, what Zhao Hong was doing could already be considered lenient.

As for Chu Feng, he did not say anything more. The reason for that was because he was able to tell while the spirit formation Zhao Hong had set up was a powerful slaughtering formation, Zhao Hong had altered it.

It was as Zhao Hong had declared, as long as there was a Martial Ancestor-level expert in the spirit formation core while the spirit formation was active, the people inside the spirit formation would not be harmed.

Furthermore, as long as the spirit formation was active for four hours, it would automatically dispel itself.

However, if the Martial Ancestor-level expert in the spirit formation core were to leave in that period of time without another Martial Ancestor-level expert entering the spirit formation core to replace that person, the spirit formation would unleash its true might and slaughter the people inside.

By the same account, if someone tried to undo the spirit formation from the outside, the spirit formation would also immediately activate and massacre all the people within it.

“Oh, that’s right. I’d urge to you listen to my instructions obediently. It’s best that you do not try to use your power to force open that spirit formation. Else... don’t blame me for the deaths of your relatives,” Zhao Hong suddenly added.

“It’s best that you listen to her. Else, you will bring harm to them,” Chu Feng was afraid that Kong Cheng would not trust Zhao Hong, and thus echoed what Zhao Hong said. As the spirit formation was jointly set up by Zhao Hong and Wang Qiang, even though Kong Cheng possessed the capability to forcibly break it apart with his martial power, he would immediately trigger the mechanism of the spirit formation and cause it to kill all the people inside.

“Who are you all? Do you dare leave your names?” Kong Cheng asked coldly.

Hearing those words, Chu Feng also removed his conical bamboo hat. Then, he said, “I am Chu Feng. If you want revenge in the future, you can come and find me.”

“Chu Feng, it’s you?!!!” Upon seeing Chu Feng, the crowd’s expression changed once again.

Compared to Zhao Hong and Wang Qiang, Chu Feng was quite famous in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm right now. Chu Feng’s wanted posters that the Ying Heavenly Clan sent out had already spread through the entire Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. As such, they all knew what Chu Feng looked like.

Although Kong Cheng did not say anything, the other young Half Martial Ancestors from the Kong Heavenly Clan began to threaten Chu Feng fiercely. “Chu Feng, you truly have nerve! Today, you have offended all four of the strongest powers in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm! We shall see how you will continue to survive in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm!”

“If I were scared, I would not have revealed myself today,” Chu Feng smiled coldly. Then, he turned around and soared into the sky. Zhao Hong and Wang Qiang also soared into the sky following him. Then, the three of them disappeared into the distant sky.

“That Chu Feng is truly brazen! He actually dared to attack us! Does he really think that our Kong Heavenly Clan are trash like the Ying Heavenly Clan? Does he really think that we are people that he can afford to offend?!” That rank six Half Martial Ancestor from the Kong Heavenly Clan spoke while gnashing his teeth angrily. It could be seen that he was extremely furious because of what happened today.

“Kong Zheng, speak no more. If they had wanted to kill you earlier, you would already be dead now,” Kong Cheng said.

“But, big brother Kong Cheng, we absolutely cannot let this matter go,” That rank six Half Martial Ancestor Kong Zheng said.

“Even if they have been lenient, I will absolutely still not let this matter go. After you all regain your freedom, we shall find them and take our revenge,” Kong Cheng said. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Big brother Kong Cheng, we still have matters to take care of, so we’ll take our leave first,” Right at that moment, the other members of the younger generation present began to voice their intentions to leave. As they spoke, they prepared to leave.

“What are you all doing? Could it be that you all have been scared by that Chu Feng?” Seeing their friends all planning to leave, Kong Zheng spoke in a very displeased manner.

“Kong Zheng, it is truly not us speaking ill of you. However, it is clear that they are no ordinary people. It is best that we don’t look further into this matter.”

“Not mentioning that Chu Feng, merely that tigress and that stutterer are both extraordinary individuals.”

“As for that Chu Feng, ever since his reputation spread, his various deeds have made it known that he is an absolutely fearless individual.”

“For three such demon-level characters to appear in our Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, do you all not feel that it is strange? Do you all really think that they do not possess backing?”

“We have already been defeated in this battle. As such, we really do not wish to continue, because we do not wish to die.”

“That’s right. It is clear that those three people are all not to be trifled with. I urge you all to drop this matter too. Don’t bother finding them again.”

After the younger generations from the various powers finished saying those words, they all left. The only people that remained were the younger generation from the Kong Heavenly Clan.

At that moment, not to mention Kong Cheng, even that Kong Zheng entered deep contemplation.
