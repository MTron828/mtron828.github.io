Chapter 3271

“Tiemian, did you say that it was Chu Xuanyuan’s son?” An elder asked.

The gazes of the other elders also turned stern as they looked at Linghu Tiemian.

“Milord, it was indeed Chu Xuanyuan’s son, Chu Feng.”

“That Chu Feng has not died. Furthermore, he has returned to the Chu Heavenly Clan, and entered the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm this time around.”

“I don’t know what sort of trick he used, but he actually managed to gain control over an extremely powerful spirit formation.”

“That spirit formation was capable of controlling everything inside the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm, and even ignoring the power of the grand protective formation to directly kill people inside the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.”

“With the power of that spirit formation, we were simply no match for him,” Linghu Tiemian said.

Linghu Tiemian was extremely emotional and furious when he said those words. The reason for that was because he was still unreconciled over having lost to Chu Feng, as he still felt that Chu Feng had had an unfair advantage in their match.

“There’s actually such a thing?”

At that moment, those Linghu Heavenly Clan elders, who enjoyed great status, began to ponder.

They were people that had first-hand experience of Chu Hanxian and Chu Xuanyuan, and knew very well how frightening that father and son duo were.

And now, Chu Hanxian’s grandson, Chu Xuanyuan’s son, Chu Feng had actually appeared out of thin air, and in such an overwhelming manner.

With this, they truly could not ignore it.

......

Chu Feng had no idea what was happening in the Linghu Heavenly Clan. He also had no heart to guess what might be happening.

Currently, Chu Feng was busy with a major task.

Chu Feng was practically able to sense the location of all the cultivation resources in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.

However, those cultivation resources were not very useful to the current Chu Feng.

Furthermore, Chu Feng had discovered that the cultivation resources of the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm were not fixed in place; they would disappear and reform repeatedly. It was a continuous cycle.

Perhaps, in the future, a cultivation resource that would provide great assistance to Chu Feng might appear. However, Chu Feng had no idea when that time would arrive.

It might be possible for such a cultivation resource to appear in a couple days. It might also be possible that such a cultivation resource would never appear in Chu Feng’s lifetime.

He did not wish to waste time, and also did not wish to gamble on the matter.

As such, Chu Feng planned to leave the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.

However, Chu Feng knew that, with the current strength of the Chu Heavenly Clan, the status of the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm’s overlord that he had just obtained for the Chu Heavenly Clan would immediately be snatched away by others should he leave.

As such, Chu Feng could not just leave like that. Besides, Chu Feng had already discovered a method to allow their Chu Heavenly Clan to continue to rule over the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.

As for that method, it would be to remove the formation core from his body and set up a grand formation using it.

The power of that grand formation would be under the Chu Heavenly Clan’s control. With that, the Chu Heavenly Clansmen would naturally be able to continue to rule the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm. At the same time, they would also receive an unending stream of cultivation resources.

Although those cultivation resources might not be of much assistance to Chu Feng, they would be of great use to the other Chu Heavenly Clansmen.

Of course, such a formation would be very difficult to set up, and would require quite a bit of energy from Chu Feng.

That said, after a month passed, Chu Feng managed to successfully set up his spirit formation.

After he finished setting it up, Chu Feng handed the spirit formation to Chu Ping. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Big brother Chu Ping, the power of this spirit formation is no small matter. You must protect our clan. However... you shouldn’t willfully slaughter the innocent, or become excessively domineering.”

“Among rulers, there are those that are wise, those that are incompetent, and those that are despotic.”

“I hope that big brother Chu Ping will be able to become a wise ruler. I also hope that your successor will also be a wise ruler,” Chu Feng said to Chu Ping.

The reason why Chu Feng selected Chu Ping to handle the spirit formation was because of Chu Ping’s kind nature. Chu Feng firmly believed that Chu Ping would not become arrogant and egotistical just because he had obtained the power of the grand formation.

However, should the power of that grand formation be given to other clansmen, that might not necessarily be the case.

That said, Chu Feng also knew that Chu Ping would one day leave the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm. At that time, a new leader would be needed to lead the Chu Heavenly Clansmen.

Chu Feng hoped that Chu Ping would be cautious when making his selection for his successor. Otherwise... it would create no end of trouble.

“Little brother Chu Feng, I understand your intention. You can rest assured,” Chu Ping said.

“Besides this, there’s one more thing. If you are to find Bai Liluo in the future, you must treat her well,” Chu Feng said to Chu Ping.

Although Chu Feng possessed the power of the grand formation, he was unable to detect Bai Liluo. Because of that, he was extremely worried for her.

Whilst setting up the grand formation, Chu Feng had also attempted to seek out Bai Liluo multiple times.

Unfortunately, he was still unable to detect her. As such, after having decided that he would leave the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm, apart from the Chu Heavenly Clansmen that he was worried about, Chu Feng was also worried about Bai Liluo.

“Little brother Chu Feng, you can rest assured. Young lady Bai Liluo had such a deep friendship with you; if we are to encounter her, we will definitely treat her like a distinguished guest. We will definitely not allow anyone in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm to bully or humiliate her,” Chu Ping guaranteed.

Chu Feng smiled. Then, he took two steps back and clasped his fist. “Big brother Chu Ping, brothers and sisters, I, Chu Feng, shall take my leave first.”

It was not only Chu Ping that was present. Apart from the three Chu Heavenly Clan’s traitors, the other Chu Heavenly Clansmen were all present.

“Little brother Chu Feng, we will miss you.”

“Little brother Chu Feng, it’s more dangerous outside. You must take care of yourself.”

The Chu Heavenly Clansmen became very emotional upon finding out that Chu Feng was going to leave. For many people, tears began to appear in their eyes.

There were several women among them that actually started to sob quietly.

During the past month, they had fully enjoyed the treatment of being the rulers of the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.

They knew very well that it was all due to Chu Feng’s contribution that they were able to gain their current status.

As such, they had a special sort of sentiment toward him, and were truly reluctant to part with him.

“I will take care of myself. You all take care of yourselves too. Remember, you must remain united.”

“We shall meet again outside the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.”

Chu Feng clasped his fist again. Then, he activated the power within him, the power to leave that place.

In the next moment, Chu Feng felt his surroundings changing nonstop.

When the change finally stopped, Chu Feng’s surroundings had changed.

At that moment, a smile emerged on Chu Feng’s face.

The reason for that was because Chu Feng knew that he had returned.

Chu Feng had left the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm and returned to the Chu Heavenly Clan.
