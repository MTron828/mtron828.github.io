Chapter 3415 - The Queen’s Servant

“Damn it.”

Seeing the nearby Chu Feng, whose body was surrounded by Saint-level spirit power, Linghu Hongfei had extremely complicated feelings.

It was a mixture of unreconcilation, anger and hatred.

Originally, all those benefits had belonged to him. Yet, it had ended up benefitting Chu Feng instead.

Had it been anyone else, they too would not be willing to leave the matter at that and feel nothing.

However, this was not the only reason why Linghu Hongfei felt so pained.

In his entire life, Linghu Hongfei had never suffered when fighting people of the younger generation.

Regardless of what sort of confrontation it might be, as long as he, Linghu Hongfei, decided to participate in it, he would undoubtedly win.

Before his confrontation with Chu Feng, Linghu Hongfei had been undefeated.

Yet, at that moment, his undefeated achievement that he was so proud of, and that he felt could be maintained throughout his entire life, was actually ruined by Chu Feng.

To Linghu Hongfei, what Chu Feng had done was akin to obliterating his honor, and forever destroying what he cared about the most.

Thus, Linghu Hongfei was not only feeling simple unreconciliation. If possible, he would have definitely killed Chu Feng on the spot, dismembered his body into ten thousand pieces, drank his blood, eaten his flesh, flayed his skin and removed his tendons.

In fact, even killing Chu Feng would not be enough to alleviate Linghu Hongfei’s anger.

That said, what caused Linghu Hongfei the greatest pain was the fact that it was impossible for him to even kill Chu Feng at that moment.

Thus, he could only endure the hatred. In fact, Linghu Hongfei was quite capable of restraining himself.

Even though he was clearly surging with anger like a soon-to-erupt volcano, he appeared to be completely unaffected on the surface.

It must be admitted that that in itself... was a sort of skill.

When Linghu Hongfei wanted to exercise restraint, he was able to make it so that others could not determine what he was actually feeling.

At that moment, Chu Feng was able to imagine how deep the resentment Linghu Hongfei felt towards him was.

However, he did not even bother to take a glance at Linghu Hongfei. The reason for that was because that Asura Spirit World’s world spirit had appeared again.

“Girl, let us have a proper talk this time around. You said that you wish to serve me; why don’t you give me a reason to trust you? Otherwise, I will not bring you to this world,” Chu Feng said.

“I...” The world spirit started to hesitate.

“Girl, it’s not the first time that we’ve chatted. You should be able to tell that I am not a fool. It’s best that you tell me the truth, otherwise... you won’t have another opportunity,” Chu Feng said.

“I... want to find my young miss,” that world spirit said.

“!!!”

Upon hearing those words, Chu Feng was immediately startled. An Asura World Spirit said that she wanted to find her young miss. There was only a single person that Chu Feng could think of... Eggy.

However, Chu Feng did not mention that outright. Instead, he stabilized his heart and asked calmly, “Your young miss? Who is your young miss?”

“I will tell you if you enter a contract with me,” That world spirit said.

“You need to tell me. Otherwise, I will not enter a contract with you,” Chu Feng’s attitude was extremely firm.

“No. My young miss refuses to allow me to speak her name. I can only tell you that she is the most beautiful person in the entire world,” That world spirit said.

“In that case, tell me how she looks,” Chu Feng said.

“Very well, I can describe her appearance to you.”

Hearing those words, a feeling of joy emerged in Chu Feng’s heart. If he was given a description, he would be able to distinguish whether that young miss she was searching for was Eggy or not.

As for that world spirit, she kept her word, and began to describe her young miss.

“My young miss has the world’s most beautiful pair of eyes.”

“My young miss has the world’s most beautiful head of hair.”

“My young miss has the world’s most beautiful face.”

“My young miss has the world’s most beautiful skin.” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“My young miss has the world’s most beauti...”

“Stop! How could you call that a description?” Chu Feng had a helpless look on his face.

“But my young miss is the most beautiful person in the entire world. If I don’t describe her like that, how else could I describe her?” That world spirit felt very wronged.

“Can’t you describe her appearance in detail?” Chu Feng felt a bit angry. He felt that that girl was simply toying with him.

“There’s not enough time! Quickly... enter a contract with me! If I miss this opportunity, I will never be able to contact you again, never be able to find my young miss again!” Suddenly, that world spirit’s voice turned very urgent and anxious.

Chu Feng was able to feel that the connection between him and that world spirit was indeed on the verge of fading. She was not lying.

Chu Feng also could not guarantee that the world spirit would still be able to find him during his next breakthrough.

If she was truly Eggy’s friend, if Chu Feng was to refuse her, and ended up not being able to reach her again, he would’ve truly let down Her Lady Queen.

Thinking of that, Chu Feng decided to take the risk!!!

“In that case, tell me this, does your young miss wear a black feather skirt?” Chu Feng asked.

“That’s right. My young miss wears a black feather skirt,” the world spirit replied in a very certain tone.

“Very well, I’ll trust you this once,” after he finished saying those words, Chu Feng cast his consciousness into his world spirit space.

“Eggy, I hope that this girl didn’t lie to me, and is really someone that you know. Should that be the case, you will not have to be all alone in this world.”

Chu Feng took a glance at Eggy, who was still undergoing closed-door training. A smile appeared on his face.

Her Lady Queen was captured by his mother. Due to spirit formation bindings, she was unable to return to the Asura Spirit World.

As an Asura World Spirit, she was only able to remain in the unfamiliar world. Although Her Lady Queen had never expressed any sign of loneliness, Chu Feng was able to imagine how lonely she must feel.

Because of that, Chu Feng felt that he owed her greatly.

Because of that, he decided to take a chance with that world spirit.

Afterwards, Chu Feng began to connect with that world spirit, and attempted to enter a contract between a world spiritist and a world spirit.

As for that world spirit, she was already prepared. Thus, the two of them quickly entered a contract successfully.

“Woosh~~~”

Suddenly, light began to flicker as a violent wind burst forth. A world spirit gate suddenly opened in Chu Feng’s world spirit space.

Following that, a beautiful woman gracefully walked out from the world spirit gate.
