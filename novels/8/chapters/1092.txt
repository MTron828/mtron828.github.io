MGA: Chapter 1093 - Bai Ruochen

“Headmaster Sikong, I am familiar with the agreement between our Ascension Sect’s ancestor and your Southern Cyanwood Forest’s ancestor.”

“However, it has been a very long time now. Yet, your Southern Cyanwood Forest has failed to obtain the keepsake from the Southern Cyanwood Forest’s Pagoda all this time. I feel that for you all to come here this time would be nothing more than a waste of time.”

“Thus, in my opinion, I don’t think you have to come again. In other words, if we were to say it nicely, I suggest you to give up on it for eternity. Or, if we were to say it bluntly, I’m suggesting that you should not bring about your own humiliation anymore.” That Madam Sectmaster spoke. While she had a good-natured smile on her face, her words were extremely offensive.

Once this Madam Sectmaster said those words, Sikong Zhaixing immediately started to deeply frown. His expression became unsteady. While he was extremely angry, he did not dare to refute her and could only endure.

This was what it meant by ‘when beneath eaves, one has no choice but to lower one’s head.’ When faced with someone who possessed greater strength and influence, sometimes, you had no choice but to endure, even if your dignity was insulted.

“And how are you certain that our Southern Cyanwood Forest will leave in failure this time too?” Right at this moment, Chu Feng spoke. While Sikong Zhaixing might have misgivings, Chu Feng did not. To Chu Feng, one’s dignity must be guarded by oneself.

“Yoh. To actually dare to speak to me like this, you’re especially commendable. You’re the disciple that is to enter into the Southern Cyanwood Forest’s Pagoda, right? It seems that you’re pretty confident in yourself.” The Madam Sectmaster inspected Chu Feng and did not display a detestable expression. Instead, she was slightly surprised.

She then turned to Sikong Zhaixing and said, “Headmaster Sikong, for you to bring him here, I believe that you are also confident in him. Since this is the case, how about we make an agreement?”

“What sort of agreement?” Asked Sikong Zhaixing.

“I will allow this disciple of yours to enter into the Southern Cyanwood Forest’s Pagoda. However, this would be the last time.”

“If he is able to obtain the keepsake from the Southern Cyanwood Forest’s Pagoda, everything will be fine. If he is unable to obtain it, I wish that you all would stop coming to our Ascension Sect. Moreover, I will change the Southern Cyanwood Forest’s Pagoda’s name to Ascension Sect’s Pagoda. From today hence, this Southern Cyanwood Forest’s Pagoda would be our Ascension Sect’s possession. What do you think about this?” Said the Madam Sectmaster with a beaming smile.

“This...” Once he heard those words, Sikong Zhaixing’s expression immediately took a huge change. It would be one thing if she was to refuse them, but for her to speak this sort of demand.

This was already no longer an ordinary refusal. Not only was she refusing to allow the Southern Cyanwood Forest to obtain the item that belonged to them to begin with, she wanted to take this Southern Cyanwood Forest’s Pagoda for themselves and make it so that there would be no relationship between it and the Southern Cyanwood Forest henceforth.

At this moment, Sikong Zhaixing was clenching his fists, causing it to give off cracking sounds. He loathed, loathed himself for being so powerless. It was only because he was that powerless that he was bullied like so.

However, as he was powerless, no matter how much the anger in his heart burned, it would only burn him as he didn’t dare to burst outward.

“I agree to your demands.” However, finally, after clenching his teeth, Sikong Zhaixing agreed to it.

His way of thinking was very simple. If he agreed to it, there would still be a chance. However, if he was to refuse her demand, there would never be a chance and the Southern Cyanwood Forest’s Pagoda would have no relation with the Southern Cyanwood Forest anymore. Ascension Sect had the thought to obtain the Southern Cyanwood Forest’s Pagoda for themselves and this was something that Sikong Zhaixing could not alter unless they could obtain the keepsake within it. Thus, he had no choice but to agree to it.

“Very well. Since this is the case, you can go ahead.” Seeing that Sikong Zhaixing had consented to it, the Madam Sectmaster charmingly smiled and then waved her hand at Chu Feng.

“Woosh.” However, right at the moment when Chu Feng prepared to set off, a golden light suddenly appeared. It actually sealed off the entrance to the Southern Cyanwood Forest’s Pagoda.

When he raised his head to look, he discovered that a figure was rapidly flying over. In the end, that figure landed on top of the Southern Cyanwood Forest’s Pagoda.

This person was also a female. However, she was a young female. Her white skirt drifted in the wind. Her long hair was soft, black and dark. Her temperament gave off a sensation of a fairy.

Moreover, not only was her temperament outstanding, even her facial appearance was extraordinary. Her skin was translucent like jade and soft like an infant. Her large watery eyes were as beautiful as the starry sky.

Her sexy red lips, her oval face, her tall figure and impressive curves, this woman was truly an enormous beauty.

Most importantly, this woman’s facial appearance actually resembled Madam Sectmaster. However, she was a tier more beautiful than Madam Sectmaster.

Compared to her beautiful appearance, Chu Feng was more surprised by the cultivation of this woman - a rank three Martial King.

But, in terms of age, she appeared to be of similar age to Zi Ling. In other words, she was even younger than Chu Feng.

With such a cultivation at such an age, this signified one thing — this woman’s talent was exceptionally outstanding, she was no ordinary character.

“We pay our respects to eldest senior sister.” After seeing this woman, the ninety-nine disciples of the Ascension Sect shouted in unison.

“Eldest senior sister?” Hearing those words, both Chu Feng and Sikong Zhaixing were surprised.

This girl appeared to be extremely young, she seemed to not even have reached twenty years of age.How could she possibly be the eldest senior sister of these core disciples? There was definitely something fishy going on.

“Ruochen, why did you come?” Right at this moment, the Madam Sectmaster suddenly spoke.

“Mother, even I am unable to reach the peak of the Southern Cyanwood Forest’s Pagoda, what qualifications does he have to go up in it?”

“If he wishes to go up, that’s fine too. All he has to do is to defeat me, Bai Ruochen. Otherwise, he would have no qualifications to enter.” said the woman by the name of Bai Ruochen.

After she spoke, Chu Feng finally realized why everyone called her eldest senior sister. It turned out that she was the Madam Sectmaster’s daughter. With a special relationship and her outstanding strength, she obtained the title of eldest senior sister.

“Heh, this daughter of mine is truly insensible like this. However, what she says is also reasonable. How about this, little friend, you go ahead and compare notes with my daughter. As long as you can defeat her, I will allow you to enter the Southern Cyanwood Forest’s Pagoda.”

“Moreover, this Southern Cyanwood Forest’s Pagoda would forever remain a possession of your Southern Cyanwood Forest. Even if you fail to obtain the keepsake within it, your Southern Cyanwood Forest would be welcome to come back and enter it anytime you wish.”

“However, if you are unable to defeat my daughter, then, like what we have previously agreed on, the Southern Cyanwood Forest’s Pagoda would not have the slightest relationship with your Southern Cyanwood Forest from today on. I would also change its name to Ascension Sect’s Pagoda. What do you think?” said the Madam Sectmaster.

“Fine by me.” Chu Feng did not bother with superfluous words. He directly looked to Bai Ruouchen and asked, “How do you wish to compare?” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Buzz.” Bai Ruochen extended her finger and drew a one meter diameter circle before her. After that, she waved her hand and drew a hundred-meter circle outside of the one meter circle. Only then did she say to Chu Feng.

“As long as you can enter the outer circle, you are considered to be qualified to enter the Southern Cyanwood Forest’s Pagoda.”

“If you can force me out of the inner circle, it would be considered your win and from today on, the Southern Cyanwood Forest’s Pagoda shall be your Southern Cyanwood Forest’s and our Ascension Sect would never touch upon it again.”

“Senior, does the words spoken by your daughter count?” Chu Feng asked the Madam Sectmaster.

“It does. However, little friend, although your courage is deserving of praise, I still wish to advise you to give up. With your cultivation, what else could it be other than seeking your own humiliation to exchange blows with my daughter?” said the Madam Sectmaster while shaking her head.

“Heh, madam, thank you for your worries, but I am fine.” Chu Feng coldly smiled. He did not bother to restrain himself afterwards. With a movement of his body, he explosively shot out in a flash. Bringing with him an unparalleled amount of power, he flew towards the circles drawn by Bai Ruochen.
