MGA: Chapter 767 - A Disaster

Chu Feng could only lightly smile when he saw Chun Wu’s stunned expression. Then, he said, “Senior Chun Wu, why are you here? And how did you know I would appear at this place?”

“I only knew you would come here because I accidentally overheard a conversation between Master and Senior Qiushui.

“As for how I came here, it’s because my master sent me off for a mission. After completing the mission, I coincidentally discovered it was rather close to this Depraved Ravine, so I came and checked it out.

“After all, I too want to see which is most powerful of the disciples of the Three Protectors. I’ve heard that each of their strengths is not inferior to Murong Xun’s!

“Some people even think they are stronger than Murong Xun. They’re geniuses who’ve disappeared for many years, right? Now, they’ve made a reappearance, so everyone is curious as to what degree of strength they’ve reached,” said Chun Wu as she giggled. After knowing Chu Feng had the ability to conceal his identity, she wasn’t that worried anymore. Now, she returned to her former lively, unrestrained, and playful attitude.

“I see. Then how did you clash with Zhan Feng?

“Even if you had some past conflicts in the Martial Marking Immortal Realm, looking at Zhan Feng’s nature, he shouldn’t have restrained and attacked you for no reason,” Chu Feng asked again.

“Of course he wouldn’t for no reason. If it weren’t because I caught onto a mistake and overheard something I shouldn’t have heard...” Chun Wu said, pouting.

“What did you overhear?” Chu Feng asked.

“Heh, this is a big secret! But if it’s true, this Depraved Ravine will be quite a bit more interesting~” said Chun Wu sweetly.

“What exactly is happening? Senior Chun Wu, please don’t keep me in suspense,” Chu Feng impatiently asked.

“Junior Chu Feng, I’m sure, with your Spirit Formation techniques, you should be able to see that our current location is not the deepest part of the Depraved Ravine. You should also know, then, that the true core is within the Spirit Formation, and that the true Depraved Ravine is within the Spirit Formation, right?” Chun Wu replied with a question.

“Mm. Indeed, that Spirit Formation is very powerful. No matter up in the sky or down into the ground, one cannot pass through it. If anyone wants to pass, they can only destroy the entire Spirit Formation first. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“But, from what I see, this Spirit Formation is extremely skillfully made. The entire formation is connected and contains equal energy throughout. If one strikes it, just a bit, the equalized energy would congregate to that location to defend against the strike. It is very difficult to destroy this formation, and even Martial Kings can do nothing to it.

“But, Senior Chun Wu, does your secret refer to this Spirit Formation?” Chu Feng asked.

“Of course not, but it is related. Everyone knows this place is one of the remains of the Crippling Night Demon Sect. However, no one knows of the importance of this place.

“Within the Depraved Ravine, there is a treasure,” said Chun Wu mysteriously.

“What treasure?” Chu Feng asked.

“I also don’t know what treasure it is; I only know there’s a treasure here from Zhan Feng and the others’ conversations.

“But, from what I’ve heard, the Immortal Execution Archipelago has already sent an army to sneak into this place. Even Murong Xun has come.

“Even of the Immortal Execution Archipelago’s Nine Immortals, the Seventh Immortal, the Eighth Immortal, and also the Ninth Immortal have come. Although that Ninth Immortal is only at the peak of the Martial Lord realm, he possesses a Royal Bloodline and also cultivated a Forbidden Mysterious Technique. He has successfully melded both those powers into one, and his fighting strength is extremely overwhelming. I’ve heard he is an existence that’s invincible within the realm of Martial Lords.

“As for the Seventh Immortal and Eighth Immortal, they are even more impressive. They are both Martial Kings. For the Immortal Execution Archipelago to send such a strong formation of people out, I’m sure that the treasure within the Depraved Ravine must not be simple at all,” Chun Wu said expectantly.

“Since there’s treasure in this Depraved Ravine, and the people from the Immortal Execution Archipelago also know of it, they should already be here. They must be unable to open the formation here so that’s why they haven’t made their move yet.

“And now, since they’re sending so many people, they must have found the method to open the formation. Yet, if they had truly found it, what’s stopping them from just directly opening it? Why must they be so secretive and do something so troublesome such as sneaking in?” Chu Feng contemplated, then, his eyes lit up. “Could it be because of the disciples of the Three Protectors?”

“Junior Wuqing, you are really too smart. It’s exactly because of the disciples of the Three Protectors.

“I heard Zhan Feng and the others say that the reason why this formation is difficult to open is because the head of the Crippling Night Demon Sect personally laid it. Back in the days, he was publicly agreed to be the strongest person in the Eastern Sea Region.

“Even the current head of the Immortal Execution Archipelago is likely inferior to him. Naturally, the Immortal Execution Archipelago is unable to open this formation.

“However, the Four Protectors of the Crippling Night Demon Sect know the method of opening this formation; after the sect disbanded, it was the four of them who activated this formation and sealed the Depraved Ravine.

“Right now, the disciples of the Three Protectors have come here for an arranged battle. There is no other reason but because they all have the opening method passed down to them by the Three Protectors. Their goal is also the treasure in the Depraved Ravine.

“However, due to the tumult between the Four Protectors, the disciples of the Three Protectors are in discord as well. That’s why they’ve set this arranged battle. Only the strongest is qualified to obtain the treasure inside.

“Ahh, on that topic, it is truly a pity. The head of the Four Protectors, Qiu Canfeng, had never accepted a disciple. Otherwise, what is soon to arrive would have been the battle between the disciples of the Four Protectors.”

Chun Wu had a face of regret. But, if she were to know that Qiu Canfeng’s disciple did come here, and it was Chu Feng, who knew what she would feel.

“That means the complete method of opening this formation is grasped within the hands of the Four Protectors, and that it’d be impossible with a single person?” Chu Feng asked.

“I believe so.” Chun Wu nodded.

“At present, since the disciples of the Three Protectors have come, then there should be only three methods of breaking it. By lacking one, it is incomplete. How should it be opened then?” Chu Feng was confused.

“Although Qiu Canfeng doesn’t have a disciple, perhaps he has already told the method of breaking it open to the three other Protectors? Although the Four Protectors have never been on good terms with one another, they have when facing an outside enemy,” Chun Wu said.

“I hope so.” Although Chu Feng nodded, he had a nagging feeling that his master didn’t easily tell the fourth method to the other three Protectors.

In reality, Chu Feng also hoped that his master didn’t tell that method to the three other Protectors. That way, even the disciples of the Three Protectors wouldn’t be able to easily break open that formation.

As such, the Immortal Execution Archipelago’s scheme of being “the fisherman that reaps the rewards” could not be used.

“Crap.” However, just at that moment, Chu Feng’s pupils suddenly shrank. His expression simultaneously changed greatly.

He hurriedly transformed his appearance back to “Wuqing,” and at the same time, grabbed Chun Wu, bore into the ground, and planned to dig a way to escape.
