MGA: Chapter 1321 - How Do You Wish To Die?

“Ahhhh~~~~”

Mourning screams like the wailing of ghosts and howling of wolves sounded from that disciple. Due to the fact that his entire mouth had been sliced off by Chu Feng, that disciple’s voice was extremely strange and appeared to be very terrifying.

“Chu Feng, you are truly impudent. As a nominal disciple, you actually dare to harm your fellow senior brother. Did you truly think that we do not dare to punish you?”

Seeing that Chu Feng actually ruthlessly sliced off that disciple’s mouth and chin, a Golden Bamboo Forest elder shouted loudly in anger.

This elder was the same elder who previously invited Chu Feng to join the Golden Bamboo Forest and was refused by him.

Due to Chu Feng refusing his invitation, he harbored hard feelings toward Chu Feng, and had been thinking about how to deal with him the entire time. And now that Chu Feng had actually ruthlessly attacked a genius from the Colorful Bamboo Forest, he finally found an opportunity to deal with Chu Feng.

“That’s right. A disciple like him is simply disregarding all laws and morality. We cannot let him continue on unrestrained. We must punish him,” Many other elders also began to call for Chu Feng’s punishment. They too wanted to harm Chu Feng.

Like the Golden Bamboo Forest’s elder, they had also been rejected by Chu Feng, and harbored ill feelings toward him because of that. And now, they had found an opportunity to strike at Chu Feng. Thus, they wanted to use this opportunity to handle Chu Feng so as to appease the hatred in their hearts.

“If you agree to a bet, you must accept your loss. That is a matter of course. I, Chu Feng, have not gone against the rules of the Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest. Exactly what sort of justification do you all have in punishing me?”

Not only did Chu Feng not fear them, he instead loudly shouted in rebellion. His attitude was extremely arrogant, and he argued with courage and conviction. This stunned even those elders who wanted to teach him a lesson. For the time being, they stood there and did not dare to attack him.

“Agree to a bet, accept the loss, you said? Very well, are you willing to gamble with me too?”

Right at this moment, a resounding voice suddenly exploded from over the horizon. Immediately following it, a man appeared in the sky.

He was a young man. He was very tall; his height was two meters. He possessed a handsome appearance and an elegant demeanor.

Most importantly, his cultivation was very powerful; he was a rank seven Martial King, two levels above Chu Feng.

“Quick, look, that’s the strongest disciple of the Colorful Bamboo Forest, Jiang Wuyi!!!”

“I truly would never have expect him to also come. This time around, there will be an enormously exciting show to watch.”

“Regardless of how powerful this Chu Feng might be, it is impossible for him to be a match for Jiang Wuyi, for Jiang Wuyi is an existence who has defeated even rank nine Martial Kings. Among Martial Kings, he is practically unparalleled.”

When they saw this person, the numerous disciples present burst into an uproar. Reverence filled the faces of the male disciples and affection filled the eyes of the female disciples, completely showing their adoration and lust for this Jiang Wuyi.

That was because this young man was most definitely an extremely influential figure in the Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest, a person who was capable of calling the wind and summoning the rain. He was the number one disciple of the Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest, Jiang Wuyi.

“You also wish to gamble with me? Do you want to eat feces or pick up feces?” Chu Feng asked with a beaming smile. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“I want to gamble for your life,” Jiang Wuyi said. His tone was ice-cold and ruthless, like a ruler who looked down upon the rest of the world. To him, Chu Feng was a petty and low commoner.

“You wish to gamble with your life? Are you certain?” Chu Feng was astonished.

“If you do not dare, then you can just say so,” Jiang Wuyi’s tone was extremely arrogant. He simply did not place Chu Feng in his eyes at all.

“It’s not that I do not dare, it’s merely that there is neither hatred nor grievance between us. If I were to kill you, I’m afraid your Colorful Bamboo Forest’s elders would not allow it,” Chu Feng replied with a smile.

“This is the life and death agreement given personally by the head elder of our Colorful Bamboo Forest. As long as you sign it, our life and death will be determined by our abilities. No one will bother us in this matter,” That Jiang Wuyi did not bother to waste time with superfluous words. He took out a scroll and directly threw it to Chu Feng.

Chu Feng received the scroll and opened it to look. Sure enough, it was a life and death agreement.

“Very well, since you insist on taking my life, I shall give you this opportunity.”

“However, my life is not that easy for you to take.”

“It would be best for you to prepare for the price of trying to take my life.”

After Chu Feng finished saying those words, he left a handprint on that life and death agreement. He had made the preparations to fight Jiang Wuyi to the death.

Although this Jiang Wuyi was the number one disciple of the Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest, possessed a rank seven Martial King cultivation and a heaven-defying battle power that allowed his to cross over two levels, Chu Feng still did not place him in his eyes.

This Jiang Wuyi was, at the very most, only capable of defeating rank nine Martial Kings. It was simply impossible for him to defeat Half Martial Emperor-level experts.

Thus, compared to Bai Yunxiao from the Cyanwood Mountain, this Jiang Wuyi was much weaker. When even Bai Yunxiao was no match for Chu Feng, how could this Jiang Wuyi possibly pose any threat to him?

“Very well, since you’ve accepted the challenge, then prepare to hand over your life,” When he saw that Chu Feng had signed the life and death agreement, that Jiang Wuyi did not bother with superfluous words. He activated his martial power and then explosively shot out a palm strike.

“Boom~~”

In an instant, continuous thunderous explosions sounded, and rising winds began to blow away the clouds.

As the black clouds surged, an enormous pitch-black hand appeared. The hand came swatting down from the sky. Below it, it was as if the sky had collapsed. Targeting Chu Feng, it came crushing down with oppressive might.

“Pretty decent display of strength. However, I wonder how powerful it actually is.”

Facing the enormous pitch-black hand formed by the surging black clouds, Chu Feng stood there motionlessly. His expression did not change. In fact, an anticipatory smile appeared on his face.

“What’s going on? Why isn’t that Chu Feng dodging?”

“The way I see it, he must have realized that he was no match for Wuyi and decided to give up.”

Seeing that Chu Feng did not try to dodge Jiang Wuyi’s attack, those elders who wished for Chu Feng’s death all began to sneer. They all felt that Chu Feng was finally receiving retribution for his arrogance, that he had been terrified by Jiang Wuyi’s frightening attack.

“Rumble, rumble.”

Right at this moment, that enormous hand loudly smashed down. The black clouds scattered in all directions and formed surging ripples. The might behind that attack was simply astonishing.

At this moment, the disciples of the Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest hurriedly stepped back and began to escape the ripples.

As for the elders, they worked together and blocked the resulting energy ripples so that they would not harm the bystanders.

“So powerful. Chu Feng actually did not dodge such an attack. It would appear that he is undoubtedly dead now.”

Seeing that the violent ripples were able to even shatter space, the disciples who felt that they had escaped calamity all began to wipe off their cold sweat. At the same time, they all felt that Chu Feng had undoubtedly been killed.

However, someone suddenly cried in alarm. That person pointed at the surging ripples and loudly shouted, “Quickly, look at that. What is that?”

“Heavens, that is...”

Soon, the expressions of everyone present changed enormously. They all noticed that numerous flashes of lightning were flickering at the location where Chu Feng had previously stood. As for the lightning, it soon took the form of a person.

“Zzzzzzz~~~~”

Right at this time, the lightning began to surge, scattering the ripples near it. Donning his Thunder Armor, and with Thunder Wings on his shoulders, Chu Feng appeared before the crowd.

“Th... tha... that’s Chu Feng! What’s going on? How did his cultivation increase to that of a rank seven Martial King?”

When they saw Chu Feng, not to mention the disciples, even the elders were frightened and began to sweat cold bullets. Never had they ever imagined that Chu Feng would have concealed his strength that deeply. His cultivation had now increased to the same level as Jiang Wuyi.

“It would appear that I have truly underestimated you.”

At this moment, even Jiang Wuyi was frowning deeply. Finally, the gaze with which he looked to Chu Feng was no longer one of disdain. Instead, it was now filled with concern.

He had realized that Chu Feng was not as weak as he had imagined him to be. Thus, he could not afford to be careless.

“The attack you used earlier was a Mortal Taboo Martial Skill. Its might is extremely strong, and it was also filled with deep killing intent. It would appear that you truly want to kill me.”

“Since that is the case, there is no reason for me to be lenient toward you. Your life is mine for certain,” Chu Feng’s tone was very calm. Yet, each and every word he spoke sounded like thunder. Furthermore, each word was filled with strong killing intent.

“Regardless of what sort of method you’ve used, the current you is merely the same as me, a rank seven Martial King.”

“With merely the cultivation of a rank seven Martial King, you want to kill me? You are truly boasting shamelessly!” Seeing that Chu Feng spoke of killing him, Jiang Wuyi snarled angrily at him.

Following that, he began to activate a mysterious technique within his body. It caused the surrounding space to become twisted and even shatter from his enormous aura.

At this time, his aura increased once again, and his battle power had also increased greatly. He was now displaying all of his strength.

“Humph,” however, even with this being the case, Chu Feng’s expression did not change in the slightest. Instead, he merely snorted lightly.

“Zzzzzz~~~”

Suddenly, Chu Feng’s figure warped. A flash of lightning shot out explosively, which began to charge toward Jiang Wuyi.

“Come, I shall see exactly what sort of skill you possess,” Seeing that Chu Feng had come to attack him, Jiang Wuyi flipped his wrist. Following that, a long sword that shone with silvery light appeared in his hand.

It was a Royal Armament. He had truly made preparations to fight Chu Feng to the death.

“Buzz.” However, suddenly, the flash of lightning in the sky shone with light. Immediately afterward, Chu Feng actually disappeared.

Seeing that, the expressions of everyone present changed. Even Jiang Wuyi was no exception. None of them knew where exactly Chu Feng had gone to.

“Ahhh~~~”

Right at this moment, Jiang Wuyi suddenly uttered a miserable scream. When they turned their gazes toward Jiang Wuyi, everyone’s expression changed greatly.

At this time, lightning was flickering in front of Jiang Wuyi’s chest, and blood was flowing from it. His chest had been pierced through.

As for what had pierced through his chest, it was not any powerful weapon. Instead, it was an arm covered with lightning. As for that arm, it was Chu Feng’s arm.

Chu Feng was standing behind Jiang Wuyi. Using his arm, he had pierced through Jiang Wuyi’s chest from behind.

“How do you wish to die?” Chu Feng asked coldly.
