Chapter 5440: It’s You

Fear filled Jia Lingyi’s soul.

She was not a timid person. With her privileged background and her outstanding talent, there was hardly anything that could strike fear in her heart. However, when she locked eyes with Chu Feng, fear spurred in her heart.

She had heard of Chu Feng’s affairs before this, but she didn’t think much of him.

A junior, no matter how talented, was nothing more than an ant that could be easily crushed before maturing. Yet, the devastating killing intent she felt from him earlier on gave the image of corpses strewn all over the Pill Dao Immortal Sect. She realized that she had to get rid of Chu Feng right now, or else there would be severe consequences in the future.

“Young friend Chu Feng, you may enter now,” the World Spiritist Painter said.

Chu Feng stepped forward and entered the Gate of the Masses. The crowd quickly followed after him. Even Jia Lingyi and the others who had returned to the warship earlier didn’t let go of this precious opportunity.

The Gate of the Masses was an incomparably huge painting, but it also served as a spirit formation gate too.

Passing through the spirit formation gate, Chu Feng found himself entering a realm suffusing with the aura of the Ancient Era. He quickly found some clues lying around, so he decided to follow them, thinking that it would lead him to this realm’s fortuitous encounter.

Soon, he arrived in an ancient city. The ancient city was completely barren, but its ruins hinted at its previous glory.

“I can sense that person’s aura here,” Chu Feng said.

“That person? Who?” Eggy asked.

“Eggy, I’m referring to the person inside the coffin.”

“You’re talking about the painting the World Spiritist Painter showed you earlier?”

The World Spiritist Painter had previously taken out a painting and showed it to Chu Feng, hoping that the latter could decipher the formation inside the painting and uncover its secret. Chu Feng did manage to uncover bits that others weren’t able to see, but he was unable to see anything more than the coffin hidden inside the painting.

“Yes, that’s the one I’m referring to,” Chu Feng said.

“Didn’t you mention earlier that you couldn’t see the person inside the coffin?” Eggy asked.

“It wasn’t a lie. I couldn’t see the person inside the coffin, but I could sense that someone was inside. There are traces of that person’s aura here too.”

“Why didn’t you tell the World Spiritist Painter about that?”

“That’s because I sensed a threat while I was examining the coffin.”

“A threat? What kind of threat?”

“It felt like a warning,” Chu Feng replied.

“You’re saying that the person inside the coffin is warning you not to tell the World Spiritist Painter about their existence?” Eggy asked.

“To be frank, there was a good chance I could have seen what was inside the coffin if I had continued examining the painting, but I stopped because of the warning. I have a feeling that the person inside the coffin is still alive, and the aura was intended to deter me from disturbing their peace. Since the person didn’t want me to see their appearance, it’s only right for me to respect that,” Chu Feng replied.

“That’s true.” Eggy nodded in agreement. “But if what you said is true, doesn’t that mean that there’s a living person inside the coffin? Who could it be? Is that person sealed in there?”

“I don’t think that person was sealed in there. I suspect that they might be the true owner of the All Lives Are Equal Palace,” Chu Feng said.

“The Chaotic Era Scholar?” Eggy was surprised.

“That’s what I suspect. The painting shares a similar aura with the All Lives Are Equal Palace, but I sense even greater spirit power inside it. To put it in another perspective, I’d say that it is more likely that the All Lives Are Equal Palace is a part of the painting instead of the other way around,” Chu Feng said.

“If the master of the All Lives Are Equal Palace is still alive, doesn’t that mean that another formidable figure has survived the Ancient Era? What kind of elixir did they consume to live for that long?” Eggy remarked. She thought that the turn of events was rather interesting.

“Those from the Ancient Era truly possess extraordinary means. It looks like there’s a long way ahead of me,” Chu Feng said with a chuckle, lamenting his weakness.

He might have gained considerable power, but he knew that he was far from reaching the peak of the world of cultivation. There were already plenty of juniors who were stronger than him, let alone the truly formidable existences.

“Stop lamenting. It’s only a matter of time before you stomp them beneath your feet anyway.” Eggy expressed her confidence in Chu Feng before changing the topic. “Do you think there’s any fortuitous encounter here?”

“There is definitely one in this realm.” Chu Feng rose above the clouds to get a bird’s eye view over the ancient city, but he shook his head moments later and spoke aloud, “But I don’t think that it is in this ancient city.”

The way Chu Feng had spoken aloud had made it seem as if those words were not intended for Eggy but for someone else, but the problem was that there was no one else in the vicinity.

The World Spiritist Painter had already said that those who entered the Gate of the Masses would be transported into independent realms, which was why Chu Feng didn’t have to worry about encountering anyone from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect.

Following that, Chu Feng headed into a forest behind the ancient city.

“Eggy, there is a fortuitous encounter here,” Chu Feng exclaimed excitedly.

He immediately began constructing a massive formation encompassing the entire forest, and it took him three whole days in order to complete it.

“Activate formation!” Chu Feng roared. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

The earth shook, and countless trees sunk into the ground. As the trees descended into the earth, an object rose to the surface. It was a painting.

“It has appeared!” Chu Feng was overjoyed.

Shoosh!

A suction force suddenly appeared out of nowhere to steal the painting.

Chu Feng immediately constructed a defensive formation around the painting to prevent it from being taken away. He raised his gaze, only to see a woman in the sky. The woman had average looks but an amazing physique and her cold eyes looked incredibly familiar.

“It’s you?” Chu Feng blurted out.

He had previously thought that the woman he encountered at the All Lives Are Equal Palace’s mountain valley was Jia Lingyi due to her talent and the hostility in her eyes, but his deduction was off. The woman he met was actually the woman currently standing before him.

“Who are you? I don’t know you,” Chu Feng said.

He couldn’t understand why the woman harbored so much hostility for him when she wasn’t from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect.

Boom!

The woman suddenly thrust out her palm, and a mountain descended from the sky. She was intending to take Chu Feng’s life!
