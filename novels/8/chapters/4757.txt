Chapter 4757: Just a Paper Tiger

“Junior Chu Feng, w-what is going on?” Li Muzhi asked.

“Senior Li, you don’t have to worry about anything. Everything is in my control,” Chu Feng replied.

“Just what is going on?” Li Muzhi continued probing on.

“To put it simply, I triggered a fortuitous encounter by coming into this trial via the Blackwater Sixfinger Lake. I managed to grasp the fortuitous encounter, which initiated the Cleansing,” Chu Feng replied.

“You were the one who started it? But... that’s not right. How could you have started the Cleansing? Even Lord Dugu Lingtian didn’t initiate the Cleansing when he stopped it back then!” Li Muzhi found this matter hard to believe.

It wasn’t just him. The other disciples were in a state of disbelief too. Everything that had transpired was beyond their imagination.

“Lord Dugu Lingtian might have gone about it another way, so I shan’t speculate what he went through. However, I’m very certain what happened this time around. I was the one who triggered the Cleansing, but this is also a fortuitous encounter to the rest of you too.

“Based on what I’ve seen thus far, the entire Vicious Beast Hellworld is a formation constructed by the sect founder, governing the birth and death of the beasts. However, there’s a limit to how much the formation can bear, and once it reaches its limit, it would carry out a Cleansing to reset everything back to zero.

“There are two types of Cleansing in total. One is an automatic function of the formation and the other one is a manual trigger. The results of resetting the world are the same, but the processes are different.

“Later on, when I fully trigger the Cleansing and the destructive energy suffuses the whole Vicious Beast Hellworld, you’ll find yourself surrounded with many fortuitous encounters for cultivation.

“If I’m not mistaken, all of you will be put inside an illusory world by then. There are varying difficulties to the illusory world, but as long as you can clear it, you’ll be able to receive a benefit that’ll be vital to you later on.

“Of course, you won’t be punished if you can’t clear the illusory world either. You’ll just be trapped inside, only allowed to leave once the destructive energy finally recedes. In any case, you won’t face any danger here,” Chu Feng said.

The disciples thought that they were all doomed, but who could have thought that there would be such a turn of events?

Not only would they not die to the terrifying Cleansing, but there were also fortuitous encounters waiting for them! It felt like they had been teleported from hell into paradise in the blink of an eye!

With such thoughts in mind, they began trembling in excitement.

“You bastard! In the end, you were the one who started this whole mess!”

A furious bellow suddenly sounded, bursting everyone’s bubble. It was from Zuoqiu Yanliang.

“You interrupted our hunt and still dare to claim that you would be able to ensure our safety? Aren’t you the one who put us in danger in the first place?” Zuoqiu Yanliang pointed a finger at Chu Feng as he spat through gritted teeth.

He had fallen on his bum out of fear earlier, but when he realized that the Cleansing was under Chu Feng’s control, he rose back to his feet and reverted back to his initial arrogant state.

Grar!

All of a sudden, a furious howl echoed from the Hellking beneath Chu Feng’s feet. Before the towering Hellking, Zuoqiu Yanliang looked as insignificant as an ant. It wasn’t just a difference in physique; he was also hopelessly weak in comparison.

This roar directed toward Zuoqiu Yanliang ripped his robe apart, almost exposing his bare body before everyone. Meanwhile, Zuoqiu Yanliang felt his body turning numb as he fell to the ground once more.

“Zuoqiu Yanliang, you sure are shameless. Even till now, you still dare to act arrogantly before me? Do you think I dare not deal with you just because you have a grandfather to back you? Kneel down and admit your fault right now, or else... I’ll make sure that you die a dog’s death!” Chu Feng spat.

“Chu Feng, what are you doing? Are you intending to deal with me using the powers of the Hellking? Others might be intimidated by that trick of yours, but not me! Do it if you dare then! If you kill me, even if you can get out of the Vicious Beast Hellworld alive, you won’t be able to escape from the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect!”

Unexpectedly, Zuoqiu Yanliang actually showed no fear before the powerful Hellking, putting on a hardy attitude instead.

“Are you questioning my guts?”

The Hellking raised its leg up, projecting a massive shadow over a large swathe of land.

“Junior Chu Feng, we’re all disciples from the same sect. Why must you make things difficult for Senior Zuoqiu?” Song Qian spoke up with the intention of pleading on Zuoqiu Yanliang’s behalf.

“How ironic for you to say that, Senior Song. To think that you do know that we’re from the sect. If so, why didn’t you try to stop Zuoqiu Yanliang when he was trying to oppress me? It looks like the only one you view as your fellow sect member is Zuoqiu Yanliang whereas I’m just a mere outsider,” Chu Feng sneered.

“Junior Chu Feng, how can you distort the meaning of my words?” Song Qian tried to argue her way out of this. Needless to say, she wouldn’t admit to being unfair here.

However, Chu Feng had already lost his patience with her.

“Scram aside, or else you’ll be dying together with Zuoqiu Yanliang here!”

The Hellking began lowering its massive leg. Despite its slow speed, the tremendous pressure from its weight had already crushed down on the ground, stirring up a furious gale and indenting a huge depression on the ground.

Seeing this, the other disciples quickly scattered away. Even Song Qian dared not to remain in the area. Only Zuoqiu Yanliang was left paralyzed on the spot.

It was not that Zuoqiu Yanliang didn’t want to escape, but his strength had been sealed off by the Hellking, rendering him unable to move at all.

“Stop, stop! I admit my fault, alright?”

Seeing that he was really going to die at this rate, Zuoqiu Yanliang finally relented. He broke down in tears, and even snot began dripping out of his nose.

How could he not be afraid before the powerful Hellking? He was merely putting on a strong front. He was betting on the fact that Chu Feng dared not to kill him.

However, he dared not to continue gambling on it anymore. Chu Feng would really kill him if he continued being obstinate here, so he ended up breaking down like a child who had done wrong.

He had completely lost his previous imposing front as a Hidden Dragon Disciple. If not for the disciples seeing it with their own eyes, they wouldn’t dare to believe that Zuoqiu Yanliang actually had such a weak side to him.

“Heh...”

Seeing the current state Zuoqiu Yanliang was in, he let out a sneer and didn’t continue pressuring him. He knew from the start that Zuoqiu Yanliang was just a paper tiger. It was just that he didn’t think that the latter would actually be so weak.

It was already a huge punishment for the arrogant Zuoqiu Yanliang to expose such a sight of him to the others. After all, he was obviously someone who had a lot of pride and cared a lot about his reputation.

“I officially declare the commencement of the Cleansing. Seniors, the opportunity is in your hands. How much you can grasp depends on yourself.”

Chu Feng quickly formed a series of hand seals, and the Hellking began releasing a white glow that swiftly enveloped the whole Vicious Beast Hellworld, blinding the surroundings.
