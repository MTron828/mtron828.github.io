Chapter 2735 - Emergency Meeting

“Father, I am not planning to leave. I have returned precisely so that I can prepare for the Heavenly Beloved Martial Competition,” Chu Hanyu said.

“Time truly passes quickly. In the blink of an eye, it is time for the Heavenly Beloved Martial Competition that happens once every three years again?” Chu Kongtong said.

“There’s still one year, two months and twenty one days,” Chu Hanyu said.

“Then, judging by the timing of things, Chu Qing will not be able to participate in the next Heavenly Beloved Martial Competition,” Chu Kongtong said.

“Chu Qing will be a hundred years old in another year and eighteen days. He will no longer be considered a member of the younger generation. Thus, he will not be able to participate in the Heavenly Beloved Martial Competition,” Chu Hanyu said.

“Chu Qing has reached that age. With that, another spot will be opened. Hanyu, you will be able to increase your ranking again.”

“This is great, this is truly great,” Chu Kongtong said.

“Father, your son’s goal this time around is not merely to increase my ranking,” Chu Hanyu said.

“Hanyu, in that case, what is your goal?” Chu Kongtong asked.

“Since Chu Qing is no longer able to continue to participate in the Heavenly Beloved Martial Competition, then your son’s goal will be to obtain first place in the Heavenly Beloved Martial Competition,” Chu Hanyu said.

“Very well. You are ambitious. As expected of my son.”

“Merely, Hanyu, that girl Chu Ruoshi and the Starfall Holy Land’s Song Yunfei both cannot be looked down upon. How certain are you of obtaining first place?” Chu Kongtong asked.

“Father, please rest assured. Your son has eighty percent certainty of obtaining first place,” Chu Hanyu said.

“Good, very good. Hanyu, your talent for martial cultivation greatly surpasses that of your father. Your future prospects are most definitely immeasurable.”

Seeing how confident Chu Hanyu was, Chu Kongtong grew even more joyous.

After that, Chu Kongtong and Chu Hanyu continued to chat for a very long time.

Chu Hanyu only left Chu Kongtong’s palace chamber when night fell.

When he walked out of Chu Kongtong’s palace chamber, he discovered that Chu Xianshuo was waiting for him.

“Little brother, I’ve heard that you are now a rank seven True Immortal. You are truly amazing.”

“You have now surpassed Chu Haoyan. Apart from Chu Qing, among our Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations, only Chu Ruoshi would be able to contend against you,” Chu Xianshuo moved toward Chu Hanyu with an eagerly attentive expression on his face.

“Humph, Chu Haoyan is incomparable to me to begin with. As for Chu Ruoshi, I will surpass her sooner or later. As for that Chu Qing, he will soon no longer be a member of the younger generation. There is no need for me to compare myself to him.”

Chu Hanyu was filled with confidence. He was emitting an air of arrogance all over his body.

“Of course, of course.”

Chu Xianshuo echoed repeatedly. He was extremely eager and attentive. There was no trace of his usual arrogance on him at all.

“I heard that you were defeated by an outsider? How could you be this humiliating?”

Chu Hanyu took a disdainful glance at Chu Xianshuo. There was simply no trace of familial affection in his eyes. The only things present were contempt and disgust.

“Little brother, you don’t know the full story. We have no idea where that brat called Chu Feng is from. However, he’s extremely powerful. He is most definitely not ordinary,” Chu Xianshuo said.

“Humph, definitely not ordinary you say?”

“Few people in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm will be able to catch my eyes. The only ones capable of catching my eyes are Chu Qing, Chu Ruoshi, Song Yunfei and Chu Haoyan.”

“Apart from the four of them that could be slightly comparable to me in terms of talent, the others are all trash,” Chu Hanyu said.

“Little brother, I am truly not lying to you. That Chu Feng was truly extremely powerful. Otherwise... as a rank four True Immortal, how could I be defeated by him, a rank two True Immortal?” Chu XIanshuo said.

“That’s because you’re useless,” Chu Hanyu said.

“Little brother, although your big brother’s talent cannot be compared to yours, I am most definitely not weak among the younger generations.”

“You really shouldn’t underestimate that Chu Feng. He is truly remarkable. Furthermore, there are rumors saying that he is Chu Xuanyuan’s son,” Chu Xianshuo said.

“What?!” Hearing those words, Chu Hanyu’s gaze immediately turned sharp.

“What sort of nonsense are you spouting? Didn’t that Chu Feng already die? That is something Lord Father personally witnessed,” Chu Hanyu said.

“I am truly not spouting nonsense. Not only does that Chu Feng have the same name as Chu Feng, his age also conforms to Chu Feng’s age. Most importantly, was how that Chu Feng was able to defeat me, a rank four True Immortal, with the cultivation of a rank two True Immortal.”

“That’s because he trained in the legendary Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique. In all of history, only Chu Xuanyuan and Chu Hanxian have trained in the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique. Apart from the two of them, our Chu Heavenly Clan does not even possess the method to train in the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique.”

“Moreover, apart from the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique, that Chu Feng also grasped a very strange secret skill. That secret skill actually possessed a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting a level of cultivation.”

“That is simply too unusual. That secret skill of his is simply not something from our Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm,” Chu Xianshuo said.

“Enough of your nonsense. Lord Father personally witnessed the bones of Chu Xuanyuan’s son. It’s impossible for him to be alive.”

“However, regardless of who that Chu Feng might be, I will still kill him.”

“However, I am most definitely not killing him for you.”

“I am going to kill him because I am very interested in that secret skill of his capable of surmounting a level of cultivation.”

As Chu Hanyu spoke, unconcealed greed filled his eyes.

After he finished saying those words, he directly left.

After Chu Hanyu left, Chu Xianshuo’s expression was no longer eager and attentive. Instead, strong disgust emerged in his eyes.

Quietly, he muttered, “If you kill that Chu Feng, you’ll have to shoulder the responsibility yourself.”

After he finished saying those words, a strange smile emerged on his face.

It turned out that he was deliberately telling Chu Hanyu all this so that he could incite Chu Hanyu to kill Chu Feng.

He felt that even if Chu Feng wasn’t Chu Xuanyuan’s son, he was most definitely someone with a very remarkable background.

Although Chu Hanyu was one of the most talented geniuses in the Chu Heavenly Clan, and the Chu Heavenly Clan would protect him, there were certain things that he could shoulder the responsibility for, and certain things that he could not.

Take Chu Xuanyuan for an example. He was a genius renowned throughout the entire Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, the hope of their Chu Heavenly Clan.

Yet, because Chu Xuanyuan killed people that he should not have killed, he ended up being reduced to his current state.

Chu Xianshuo was actually plotting against Chu Hanyu. The reason for that was because he detested Chu Hanyu.

Originally, he was Chu Kongtong’s most valued son. He had his father’s favor. He was the person that Chu Kongtong spared no effort to nurture.

However, ever since the day Chu Hanyu underwent the talent test, all the pampering that Chu Kongtong had given him was taken away by Chu Hanyu.

It was not only him. Even his mother was no longer favored by Chu Kongtong.

Because of this, he had wished for Chu Hanyu’s death the entire time. Only with Chu Hanyu’s death would he be able to alleviate the hatred in his heart.

......

There was a very luxurious palace in the Chu Heavenly Clan.

That palace was called the Four Halls Main Palace. It was one of the most supreme palaces in the Chu Heavenly Clan.

Those without sufficient status and cultivation were not only unable to enter the Four Halls Main Palace, but they would not even be qualified to approach it.

At that moment, very deep and powerful auras filled the Four Halls Main Palace. The auras within spread to even the outside of the palace.

If a passerby were to sense those auras, they would definitely be scared witless.

The reason for the extremely powerful auras was because extremely powerful experts were gathered in the Four Halls Main Palace.

Those people were all Martial Immortal-level experts. This was especially true for the three white-haired old men. The three of them had their eyebrows narrowed. Even without revealing any fury, their might was completely unleashed. Furthermore, their auras were frighteningly powerful. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The three of them were respectively the Military Hall’s Hall Master, the World Spirit Hall’s Hall Master and the Treasure Hall’s Hall Master.

Apart from the three of them was another expert. That person was the Law Enforcement Hall’s Vice Hall Master, Chu Xuanzhengfa.

The meeting was actually initiated by Chu Xuanzhengfa.

“Chu Xuanzhengfa, what is the important matter you needed to discuss with us that made you gather us this urgently?” The Military Hall’s Hall Master asked.

“If there’s something you need, tell us quickly. I’m still busy,” the World Spirit Hall’s Hall Master spoke impatiently.

The Treasure Hall’s Hall Master did not say anything. Merely, his expression was also quite ugly.

Those three Hall Masters, regardless of their age or status, were all above Chu Xuanzhengfa.

Furthermore, they were all actual Hall Masters, whereas Chu Xuanzhengfa was merely a Vice Hall Master.

Thus, they looked down on Chu Xuanzhengfa from the bottoms of their hearts. They felt that the only person in the Law Enforcement Hall worthy of their time was Chu Xuanzhengfa’s father.

As for Chu Xuanzhengfa himself, he was not qualified to speak with them.

Yet now, they were actually gathered here by Chu Xuanzhengfa. Naturally, they feeling displeased.
