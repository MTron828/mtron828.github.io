Chapter 5682: The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Honor

The two galaxy overlords approached the area, but they didn’t reveal themselves, choosing instead to observe the situation from above the clouds.

The phenomenon induced by the Seven Stars Gravity Tower didn’t just attract the two galaxy overlords. World spiritists cultivating in the Sacred Mansion arrived in droves. Many chose not to show their faces, but those who did number in the hundreds, and they were increasing with each passing second.

There were elders and juniors amongst them, but the fact that they were cultivating in the Sacred Mansion meant that they were of extraordinary background.

There were even quite a few True Dragon World Spiritists amongst them.

Practically everyone had to lower their heads and greet those who were of higher standing than them, but there was one elder who was an exception to the rule.

This elder was advanced in age. His back was so hunched that he needed a walking cane to move around, and despite his skinny stature, his skin hung loose from all the wrinkles. He was wearing a world spiritist robe, and he didn’t make any attempt to conceal his spirit power either.

He was a pinnacle God-cloak World Spiritist.

The elder couldn’t be considered a weakling, but there were True Dragon World Spiritists in the vicinity. Yet, he didn’t bow to anyone at all and instead slowly made his way toward Ling Xinian.

The crowd, be it the elders or the juniors, didn’t berate him for not showing respect either. Instead, they clasped their fists and greeted the elder.

“Paying respects to Lord Canghai.”

The old man named Canghai didn’t bother replying to any of the greetings, even those coming from the True Dragon World Spiritists. He walked right up to Ling Xinian before stopping.

Ling Xinian quickly manifested a chair with her spirit power and placed it behind Lord Canghai, but the latter didn’t settle down on it. In fact, he didn’t even spare a proper look at Ling Xinian. His eyes were focused on the pillar of light coming from the first Seven Stars Gravity Tower.

“Did someone reach the top of the tower? Who is it?”

“Lord Canghai, the ones who are currently challenging the tower are Jie Feng and Chu Feng,” Ling Xinian honestly replied.

“Chu Feng? An outsider?” Lord Canghai asked.

“He is currently an outsider, but he has cleared our entrance examination with exceptional results. It’s likely that he’ll be the champion, which means that he’ll be joining our ranks in due time,” Ling Xinian said.

“What entrance examination? Did that lad, Tianran, come up with it?” Lord Canghai asked.

He was referring to Mansion Master Jie Tianran, but who would dare to directly address the Mansion Master’s name inside the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, let alone refer to him as a lad?

Anyone else who did so would have been immediately subdued and thrown into prison, perhaps even sentenced to death on the spot. Yet, there was not a person who dared to correct Canghai’s words.

“Long Canghai, Lord Mansion Master has given his approval,” Ling Xinian replied.

“Mm.” Canghai nodded before turning his focus back to the tower.

The Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect’s Sectmaster looked at the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master and chuckled, saying, “There aren’t many people left in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion who dare to address you in such a manner, right?”

“It’s not bad to have someone address me in such a manner,” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master replied with a smile.

“Why hasn’t Lord Canghai made a breakthrough to become a True Dragon World Spiritist yet? Is he really cultivating some kind of special psyche cultivation skill?” the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect’s Sectmaster asked.

“I’m not sure, but that’s not important. I only hope for Long Canghai’s good health and longevity,” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master replied.

“The current Seven Realms Sacred Mansion isn’t reliant on Lord Canghai to augment its might. Regardless, there’s no doubt Lord Canghai is the strongest world spiritist below True Dragon World Spiritists,” the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect’s Sectmaster said.

It was then the two galaxy overlords narrowed their eyes.

Two individuals walked out of the Gravity Psyche Tower. They were Jie Feng and Chu Feng.

Jie Feng was in an incredibly frail state, so much so that he had to be supported by Chu Feng. In contrast, Chu Feng only had a few droplets of sweat on his face. It went without saying that the one who had scaled to the top of the tower was Chu Feng.

“Is that Chu Feng from the entrance examination?” the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect’s Sectmaster asked.

“That’s right,” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master asked.

“The one that’s acquainted with the two brats from the Totem Dragon Clan?”

“Yes.”

“I didn’t think that he’d be such a talented world spiritist too.”

The Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect’s Sectmaster didn’t know much about the Seven Stars Gravity Towers, but he could tell that Chu Feng had performed an extraordinary feat from the reactions of those below.

But again, as a galaxy overlord, he had seen all kinds of prodigies. There was no doubt that Chu Feng was a talented junior, but he didn’t think that Chu Feng was on par with the top-notch prodigies in the world of cultivation.

“That child’s capability goes beyond this. He might just be able to clear five of the Seven Stars Gravity Towers,” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master said.

Chu Feng was at the center of attention. Ling Xinian and the others rushed forward to crowd around him.

“Little brother Chu Feng, were you really the one who reached the top of the tower?” Ling Xinian asked.

“That’s right,” Chu Feng replied with a nod.

“How are you unfazed? You must be putting on a strong front. You’re too good at acting!”

Ling Yunhao began touching Chu Feng from head to toe, and someone else even tried to feel Chu Feng’s pulse. They couldn’t believe that someone could clear the first Seven Stars Gravity Tower with such ease, so they wanted to check if his composure was feigned.

“I’m fine,” Chu Feng replied.

“If that’s really the case, why don’t you challenge the next tower?” one of the True Dragon World Spiritist elders asked tauntingly.

“Can I?” Chu Feng asked.

“Of course. As long as your body can withstand it,” that elder replied.

“You have my gratitude.”

Chu Feng knew that the elder wasn’t doing this out of goodwill, but he still thanked the latter before entering the second Seven Stars Gravity Tower.

Not too long later, another pillar of light rose from the second Seven Stars Gravity Tower. Someone had successfully reached its top. What was truly shocking about this feat was how fast it was cleared.

“How did he do it so quickly?”

Even the elders were baffled, let alone the juniors.

Chu Feng soon stepped out of the tower. He was weaker than before, but it was just by a bit. Without any hesitation, he made his way toward the third Seven Stars Gravity Tower.

It was a bit slower this time around, but he successfully reached the peak.

He then moved on to the fourth one and the fifth one. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

By the time he cleared the fifth Seven Stars Gravity Tower, those from the Seven Stars Sacred Mansion couldn’t remain composed anymore. After all, he had just achieved the same feat as Ling Xiao with a much faster time.

Furthermore, Ling Xiao had entered the Seven Stars Gravity Towers many times before scaling the fifth tower in order to adapt to the pressure inside. In comparison, this was Chu Feng’s first time here.

“Is that fellow planning to break Ling Xiao’s record?”

Chu Feng’s complexion was a little pale when he walked out of the fifth tower, but his footsteps remained stable. Those from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion panicked, as they still saw him as an outsider even though he was going to join their ranks very soon.

In their minds, they still thought that Chu Feng was beneath them.

They felt that Ling Xiao’s record represented the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s honor, and it wouldn’t reflect well on them if an outsider like Chu Feng broke it.

All of a sudden, a person flitted in front of the sixth Seven Stars Gravity Tower. It was one of the members of the Jie Clan Heaven Crushing Army. He looked at Chu Feng and said, “Chu Feng, you must be exhausted. Don’t push yourself too much.”

However, it was clear to the crowd that he was trying to stop Chu Feng from further challenging the Seven Stars Gravity Towers.
