Chapter 4108 - Ancient Era’s Heaven-devouring Beast

Chu Feng and Long Daozhi had arrived at the Heaven-devouring Starfield.

However, they were still in the Ancient Era’s Teleportation Formation. They had taken the teleportation channel in order to continue towards their destination: the Immortal-bestowment Upper Realm.

The Immortal-bestowment Upper Realm was the location where Long Daozhi and the other four fellow clansmen-led powers had agreed to meet.

[1. Just noticed, if there are 4 stones, how will it be split among 5 powers?]

For the sake of increasing their speed, Long Daozhi used a special war chariot inside the Ancient Era’s teleportation formation. That war chariot greatly increased their speed.

Suddenly, the war chariot started to shake.

Even the palace hall inside the war chariot used for resting started to tremble violently.

“What’s happening?”

Chu Feng, who had been training with his eyes closed, immediately opened his eyes.

As a world spiritist, he had a bad feeling.

But, Long Daozhi was still sitting. There was no trace of panic on his face at all.

“Young friend Chu Feng, you don’t have to worry. We merely encountered a fluctuation within the teleportation formation. It will soon stabilize itself,” he explained.

“It doesn’t seem to be that simple.”

“Senior, please listen. There seems to be howls mixed in with the sound of the wind.”

“Those howls are quite terrifying. Rarely have I heard such terrifying howling.”

“That means that the one howling must be an extremely powerful and arrogant sort of ferocious beast."

Chu Feng had already gotten up as he spoke, and looked ahead with his Heaven’s Eyes.

The reason why he was looking ahead was because the wind that was violently shaking their war chariot came from ahead of them.

At that moment, Chu Feng had a very serious look on his face. However, after examining the situation he did not discover anything special.

This caused him to feel rather puzzled.

Their current situation was very strange.

There seemed to be danger approaching toward them. Yet, Chu Feng was unable to find any danger.

“Young friend Chu Feng, the Heaven-devouring Starfield’s Ancient Era’s teleportation formations are different from those of other places.”

“When fluctuations arise in this place, the incoming wind will be filled with those strange voices,” said Long Daozhi.

“Oh? Why would there be such a change?” asked Chu Feng curiously.

As a world spiritist, he was extremely knowledgeable of world spirit techniques.

Logically, all the Ancient Era’s teleportation formations in the Holy Light Galaxy should be identical.

Even if fluctuations were to occur inside a teleportation formation, their behavior should be the same. There shouldn’t be a case that was different from the others.

Yet, what was occurring inside the Ancient Era’s teleportation formation’s teleportation channel this time around was truly special.

“Chu Feng, do you know why this place is called the Heaven-devouring Starfield?”

“The reason for that is because there was a sort of giant beast in this Heaven-devouring Starfield back in the Ancient Era. That beast was called the Heaven-devouring Beast.”

“As for cultivators from our era, we address them as the Ancient Era’s Heaven-devouring Beasts.”

“Reportedly, these Ancient Era’s Heaven-devouring Beasts are extremely fond of cultivating inside Ancient Era’s teleportation formations.”

“As such, from time to time, even though they disappeared in the Ancient Era, one can hear their voices inside the Ancient Era’s teleportation formations,” Long Daozhi explained.

“So that’s the case,”

“But, if they disappeared in the Ancient Era, how do the people here know about them?” asked Chu Feng.

“Even though the Ancient Era’s Heaven-devouring Beasts have disappeared since the time of the Ancient Era, they left behind a lot of remains.”

“That said, the majority of those remains were fragments. There was only a single complete set of remains.”

“Through that set of remains, world spiritists managed to reconstruct the appearance of the Ancient Era’s Heaven-devouring Beasts.”

“While its appearance was reconstructed through world spirit techniques, perhaps because the set of remains was real, the reconstructed Ancient Era’s Heaven-devouring Beast, although fake, emits an imposing might not present in ordinary monsters.”

“Even I feel incomparably small before it.”

“I can only imagine just how powerful of the Ancient Era’s Heaven-devouring Beasts were when they were alive.”

“Once we’re done with our business here, I can bring young friend Chu Feng to have a look at the remains of that Ancient Era’s Heaven-devouring Beast.”

“Perhaps it might even be of aid to your training,” said Long Daozhi.

“Sure,” Chu Feng nodded.

He was very curious about the matters of the Ancient Era to begin with.

As such, he would naturally be curious about a creature that had played a role in the Ancient Era.

Even though Chu Feng had met quite a few creatures from the Ancient Era, he still wanted to learn more about a creature as powerful as the Ancient Era’s Heaven-devouring Beasts.

“Roar~~~” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Suddenly, roars sounded from ahead.

Even the violent wind that engulfed them became even more intense.

“Senior, were the fluctuations from earlier also like this?” Chu Feng asked.

Even though he’d heard the roar from the very beginning, it was very vague. If one didn’t pay close attention and use special observation methods, one simply wouldn’t be able to hear the roar.

However, that roar was different.

The sound of the roar had covered the sound of the violent winds.

“It is also the first time I’ve heard a roar that loud.”

At that moment, Long Daozhi’s face was no longer calm and composed. Instead, there was a faint amount of unease present on It.

“Oh?”

Chu Feng realized that things were bad when he saw Long Daozhi’s reaction.

“Rumble~~~”

Suddenly, the rapidly moving war chariot came to a sudden stop.

Even though the flow of the Ancient Era’s teleportation formation was still pushing the war chariot forward, the war chariot was not moving.

The situation made both Long Daozhi and Chu Feng frown.

The two of them both walked out of the palace and arrived at the front of the war chariot.

They wanted to see exactly what sort of unforeseen event had occurred.

“Buzz~~~”

Suddenly, a giant pair of eyes appeared in the pitch-black teleportation channel ahead.

That giant pair of eyes emitted a red light that dyed the entire region blood-red.

Then, another roar was heard as a colossal monster appeared before the war chariot.

It was a giant beast over a hundred thousand meters in length.

Before the giant beast, even the war chariot appeared immensely small.

As for Chu Feng and Long Daozhi, they were akin to specks of dust.

Upon seeing the giant beast, Chu Feng’s heart immediately tensed up. From merely a single glance, he could tell just how terrifying the giant beast before him was.

The beast’s eyes were blood-red, and its body was pitch-black. It had a head that resembled that of an alligator, and a body like a rhinoceros. On its back covered in black scales were two pairs of enormous wings that were several times larger than its body.

The winds created by the movement of the wings caused the war chariot to totter. It seemed as if it would be destroyed at any moment.

Most terrifying of all, the giant beast emitted an intense Ancient Era’s aura.

As for its cultivation, it had reached an unfathomable level.

Before the giant beast, even Long Daozhi wore an expression of fear on his face.

“How could this be?”

“Could it be that there are still living Ancient Era’s Heaven-devouring Beasts inside the Ancient Era’s teleportation formations?” Long Daozhi cried out in alarm.

“Ancient Era’s Heaven-devouring Beast?”

“Senior, could this be the Ancient Era’s Heaven-devouring Beast you mentioned?”

Chu Feng was also very surprised after hearing Long Daozhi’s words.

He had not met any Ancient Era’s Heaven-devouring Beasts before. But, according to Long Daozhi, those giant and powerful ferocious beasts of the Ancient Era should’ve been wiped out.

But, evidently, they had not been wiped out. After all, the legendary, powerful creature was alive and standing before them.

“Roar~~~”

Before Chu Feng could think more about the situation, the Ancient Era’s Heaven-devouring Beast opened its mouth.

Accompanying its roar was an enormous suction force.

The suction power enveloped Chu Feng completely. He was simply unable to resist it in the slightest.

In the blink of an eye, he was sucked into the Ancient Era’s Heaven-devouring Beast’s mouth.

After devouring Chu Feng, the Ancient Era’s Heaven-devouring Beast actually turned around and disappeared.

When the Ancient Era’s Heaven-devouring Beast disappeared, the war chariot moved on as normal. It continued to follow the flow of the Ancient Era’s teleportation formation’s current and rapidly proceeded onward in the tunnel.

Everything returned to normal.

The strange violent wind had disappeared. The roars that were heard from the wind had also disappeared.

The war chariot was no longer shaking. Furthermore, it had not received much damage.

Yet, Chu Feng had disappeared.

Long Daozhi stood there in a completely dumbfounded manner. He only managed to slowly react to what had happened after a long time had passed.

“How could this be?”

“The legendary Ancient Era’s Heaven-devouring Beast is still alive. Furthermore, it devoured young friend Chu Feng.”

“But... why would it spare me?”

“Could it be that I am unqualified to become its meal?”

“This... exactly what is going on here?!”

Long Daozhi was in a complete panic. With a complicated expression, he was completely puzzled.
