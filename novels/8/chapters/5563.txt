Chapter 5563: The Powerful Little Fishy

Jie Tian instinctively dodged with a sidestep upon sensing the killing intent.

A formation arrow harnessing frightening power that smashed even space itself whizzed through the area he was standing before. It was eventually stopped by a mountain imbued with spirit power, but it still left a deep hole in it.

Jie Tian turned to look at Little Fishy, only to see her holding onto a formation bow. There was no doubt that she was the one who released the earlier arrow.

“Why did you attack me?” Jie Tian asked.

“Do you take me for a fool? I know that you have been colluding with the traitors. You are up to something that’s likely to be detrimental to me. There’s no way I’d allow you to leave just like that,” Little Fishy revealed the reason she made a move on Jie Tian.

“Do you have evidence?” Jie Tian asked.

“I don’t need evidence other than my intuition,” Little Fishy replied.

“You tried to kill me without evidence? You’re treading on dangerous grounds,” Jie Tian said.

“I am aware that the primal elder regards you highly. It’ll be troublesome if you report this matter to him, so I have no choice but to kill you,” Little Fishy said with a sweet smile.

“You aren’t as naive as I thought, but you overestimate your own capabilities. You think that you can kill me?” Jie Tian sneered.

Boom!

Little Fishy’s formation armor shook. Her long hair fluttered as a powerful aura surged forth from her body. A gigantic wave formed behind her and quickly devoured everything within sight. They should have been in the middle of a mountain range, but it looked like they were under the ocean instead.

Gigantic black shadows could be vaguely seen amidst the raging waves behind Little Fishy. The black shadows slowly crept closer, revealing their outlines. They were ocean beasts, emanating incomparably terrifying auras. It felt like every single one of them wielded the power to destroy the world.

“W-what’s that?” Eggy’s eyes widened in shock.

“It’s a phenomenon triggered by Little Fishy’s bloodline power,” Chu Feng replied.

From the phenomenon, he could tell that Little Fishy’s bloodline power had reached a frightening level.

“She’s actually able to trigger a phenomenon through her bloodline power. Is she that powerful?”

Eggy was taken aback. She had known that Little Fishy was highly talented, but she didn’t think that it was to such an extent.

In contrast, Jie Tian was much calmer.

“You are able to exert your bloodline power through the formation armor. Your formation armor has indeed improved by leaps and bounds. It’s no wonder you dare to make a move against me. However, is that all you have?” Jie Tian asked.

He didn’t think too highly of the power Little Fishy had displayed.

Chu Feng’s heart clenched up. He couldn’t help but worry about Little Fishy since Jie Tian’s words suggested that he was confident in dealing with Little Fishy’s aggression.

Shoosh!

The surrounding scenery suddenly changed, and tremendous killing intent suddenly surged forth from behind.

Boom!

Boom!

Boom!

Loud explosions echoed.

“Are they crossing blows?”ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Everything happened so quickly that Eggy struggled to perceive it. On the other hand, Chu Feng carefully paid attention to the changes in the surrounding scenery. He keenly noticed that the incessant explosions had all come from behind, which gave rise to a deduction.

“They aren’t crossing blows. Jie Tian seems to be escaping instead,” Chu Feng said.

“He’s escaping? All he does after speaking so arrogantly is to run away?” Eggy exclaimed.

A smile formed on her lips despite her angry outburst, for this proved that Little Fishy was indeed extremely powerful. Little Fishy was at a disadvantage here, having to rely on the formation armor to manifest her strength, but Jie Tian was unable to do anything to her but flee. This showed just how strong she was.

In the first place, the ability to invoke a phenomenon when using one’s bloodline power was an incredible feat. That was not something Chu Feng could do. Only someone who had unlocked their bloodline power to the extreme could do that.

This, in itself, showed that Little Fishy was strong enough to tower above all other juniors in the world of cultivation.

…

Jie Tian was doing his best to escape, but their surroundings were enveloped by the phenomenon invoked by Little Fishy’s bloodline power. He couldn’t escape at all.

Upon realizing that, he flicked his wrist and took out an ancient teleportation talisman that gave off the same aura as the Star Memorial Domain. As soon as he scrunched up the teleportation talisman, their surroundings changed.

In the blink of an eye, they were no longer in the vast mountain range, and the flood invoked by Little Fishy was nowhere to be seen. Jie Tian had succeeded in getting away.

Even so, he continued fleeing until he arrived in a forest. Hidden in the forest was a cavern, and it contained a spirit formation gate in its depth. The spirit formation gate had to be opened with a key, which Jie Tian had in his possession.

He entered the spirit formation gate. There was a huge formation and many formation entities inside.

As soon as Chu Feng saw the formation, he immediately knew that it was the final step to completing the eighteen formation armors.

“Paying respect to Lord Jie Tian,” the formation entities said as they bowed to Jie Tian.

However, Jie Tian paid them no heed and continued heading deeper in. He passed through another spirit formation gate and entered a room with three aged formation entities in it.

These three formation entities were powerful experts. One of them was the emaciated chief elder assigned to take care of Jie Tian. He had somehow managed to enter the Star Memorial Domain, but it wasn’t too surprising considering that it was already known that those who had defected to the evil power’s side had the power to enter this place.

“Lord Jie Tian, you’re injured?”

The three elders were taken aback to see Jie Tian’s current state. It was only then Chu Feng knew that Jie Tian was injured, as he was unable to perceive the latter’s condition from his point of view.

“It’s Xianhai Yu’er. She found out that I have defected over,” Jie Tian said.

“She knows about it? But… how could she be Lord Jie Tian’s match?”

The three elders were confused.

“Her formation armor has been modified in a way that allows her to exert her bloodline power,” Jie Tian said.

“Is her bloodline power so strong that even Lord Jie Tian isn’t a match for it?”

The three elders found the matter hard to believe. Xianhai Yu’er’s bloodline power could only be exerted through the formation armor here. No matter how strong a cultivator’s bloodline was, it was inconceivable for them to defeat a world spiritist in terms of world spiritist techniques.

“Her bloodline power is strong enough to induce a phenomenon,” Jie Tian said.

“Induce a phenomenon?”

The three elders were taken aback. This was how big of an issue this was.

“Under normal circumstances, she shouldn’t have been able to exert her bloodline power here no matter how strong it was, but her formation armor has been modified in a way that perfectly complements her bloodline power. It was almost as if it was created for her.”

At this point, Jie Tian suddenly pulled Chu Feng out of the formation space with a wave of his sleeves before crushing the formation space.

“521, were you the one who modified Xianhai Yu’er’s formation armor?” Jie Tian asked icily.
