Chapter 2430 - Great Catastrophe

Suddenly, Chu Feng looked at Wang Qiang. He said, “Rest assured, I will not kill him. The reason for that is because his Origin Life Treasure is simply unable to stop me.”

After saying those words, Chu Feng thrust the Evil God Sword he held in his hand toward Kong Yuehua.

“Roar~~~”

A crimson sword ray shot forth with a shocking sound akin to the wailing of ghosts and the howling of wolves.

The crimson sword ray streaked through the sky and accurately landed on the Origin Life Treasure covering Kong Yuehua.

“Boom~~~”

An ear-piercing explosion was heard. Then, golden light began to radiate all around, and the copper bowl appeared. Merely, at that moment, the copper bowl was like the golden light; it had been shattered into countless pieces and scattered in all directions.

Kong Shunlian’s Origin Life Treasure was actually destroyed by Chu Feng with a single sword thrust.

One should know that this Origin Life Treasure was said to be indestructible unless Kong Shunlian was killed.

However, Chu Feng had not attacked Kong Shunlian. Instead, he had directly attacked the Origin Life Treasure. Just like that, Chu Feng broke through the defense of the Origin Life Treasure. As such, how could the crowd not be astonished?

“Puu~~~” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

At the same time as his Origin Life Treasure was destroyed, Kong Shunlian vomited a mouthful of blood.

After vomiting that mouthful of blood, Kong Shunlian’s complexion instantly became pale. He started to lose his balance, and began to sway left and right in midair.

In merely an instant, Kong Shunlian appeared to have aged tens of years. He simply appeared like a person on his deathbed.

“S-S-Senior K-Kong, a-are you a-alright?” Wang Qiang walked toward Kong Shunlian and supported him.

At the same time, that mysterious individual had also arrived at Kong Shunlian’s side.

However, Chu Feng, who had shattered Kong Shunlian’s Origin Life Treasure, did not continue to attack Kong Yuehua. Instead, he stood there, motionless.

To be exact, he was not standing there motionlessly. The reason for that was because the arm with which he held the Evil God Sword was trembling violently.

“Damn it,” Suddenly, Chu Feng spoke. He revealed a painful expression.

Then, he looked at the Evil God Sword he held in his hand and asked, “Why are you continuously instilling killing intent into me to affect my wisdom?”

“Tsk, tsk, tsk...” After Chu Feng finished saying those words, a strange laughter entered his ears.

“Brat, they are planning to kill you. Don’t tell me that you’re planning to spare them.”

“Kill!!!”

“Exterminate their entire clan! Only like that will you be able to establish your might!” That voice continued to resound in Chu Feng’s ears. It was only Chu Feng that could hear that voice, the voice of the Evil God Sword.

“Today, Senior Kong Shunlian risked his life to save me. And now, he is putting his life on the line to stop me. I cannot injure him,” Chu Feng said.

“What relationship does his life and death have with you? If he plans to stop you, you should just kill him,” The Evil God Sword said.

“Senior Kong Shunlian has shown kindness and grace towards me. How can I kill him?” Chu Feng said.

“Soft-hearted. Since you cannot bear to kill them, I will help you kill them today,” After the Evil God Sword finished saying those words, Chu Feng once again felt wave after wave of killing intent pouring into his body.

That killing intent was too powerful. It was on the verge of completely swallowing Chu Feng’s reasoning. Chu Feng found it very difficult to remain calm now. His heart was filled with hatred and killing intent. At this moment, he only had one thing in mind -- kill all of the Kong Heavenly Clansmen.

“Milady Queen, I... I am being controlled by this Demon Armament, help me, help me dispel this killing intent,” Sensing that the situation was amiss, Chu Feng turned to ask Her Lady Queen for help.

“Chu Feng, it’s not that I don’t want to help you. Rather, I am powerless against something like this.”

“Furthermore, to tell the truth, even if I’m able to help you, I would choose not to help you. I feel that these Kong Heavenly Clan’s old farts deserve to be killed, that the Kong Heavenly Clan should be exterminated.”

“If you fear losing control and harming those that are close to you, it’s best you tell Wang Qiang and the others to leave hurriedly,” Her Lady Queen said.

“Damn it,” Chu Feng’s eyes turned red. His anger soared, and his entire body started to tremble. It was as if he was making a very difficult decision.

“Woosh~~~”

Suddenly, Chu Feng moved. He extended his hand toward Kong Yuehua.

“Stop!!!” Seeing this, Kong Shunlian let out a loud yet hoarse shout.

Unfortunately, as he was already seriously injured, he was unable to do anything at all.

As for Kong Yuehua, she was also already seriously injured by Chu Feng. As such, she was powerless to do anything herself.

Thus, she closed her eyes and prepared herself for death.

To Wang Qiang and the others, they felt that Kong Yuehua would also undoubtedly be killed.

“Woosh~~~”

However, after Chu Feng grabbed Kong Yuehua, he did not kill her. Instead, he tossed her to Kong Shunlian.

This scene was something that no one had anticipated!!!

“This is all I can do! You all, leave immediately! If you continue to stay here, I might end up killing you all!!!” Chu Feng shouted at Kong Shunlian and the others.

At that moment, Chu Feng’s long hair was fluttering in the sky, and he was emitting overwhelming killing intent.

His entire body was covered with crimson gaseous flames that were reflecting the crimson clouds in the sky. At a glance, he simply did not appear like a human at all. Rather, he appeared more like a great demon.

“Let’s go. Chu Feng is being controlled by that Demon Armament. Soon, he will not even recognize us.”

At that moment, Wang Qiang and the others were able conclude that Chu Feng was affected by the Demon Armament, and that his conduct and deeds were not really what he wanted to do.

“Go!!!” Seeing that Kong Shunlian and the others were still hesitating, Chu Feng let out a loud shout.

After that loud shout was heard, a powerful energy rippled swept forth. Even True Immortals were blown away.

“Master, I understand your intentions. Rest assured, I will definitely protect them.”

The mysterious individual realized Chu Feng’s desire. He grabbed Kong Shunlian, Kong Yuehua and Wang Qiang and rushed to leave.

After Kong Yuehua and the others left, Chu Feng looked to the Evil God Sword in his hand. He said, “Must we really do this?”

“Tsk, tsk. Boy, let yourself go. This Evil God guarantees that no one in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm will dare bully you again after today,” The Evil God Sword’s voice sounded again.

“Heh...” At that moment, the corners of Chu Feng’s mouth lifted into a smile. It was a very frightening smile.

No one knew whether the smile belonged to Chu Feng or the Evil God.

“Woosh~~~”

After that, Chu Feng suddenly waved the Evil God Sword he held in his hand. Immediately, crimson rays swept past the other two Kong Heavenly Clan’s Utmost Exalted Elder’s heads, beheading them.

Then, Chu Feng raised his hand, and those two Utmost Exalted Elders let out miserable screams.

Merely, they only let out a single scream. The reason for that was because they were immediately killed, and their source energies were devoured by Chu Feng.

Then, Chu Feng spread open his hand. Including Kong Moyu, the three Kong Heavenly Clan’s Utmost Exalted Elders’ heads were sucked toward Chu Feng’s hand. With the three heads in his hand, Chu Feng rapidly flew toward the direction of the Kong Heavenly Clan.

“Chu Feng’s coming, he... couldn’t possibly be planning to kill us, right?” Seeing Chu Feng flying over, Zhuge Mingren and the other bystanders all revealed frightened expressions.

Zhuge Mingren had seen all that had happened earlier. As such, the crowd already knew that Chu Feng’s killing intent had been aroused. As such, they were truly afraid that Chu Feng would kill them.

After all, in a short period of time, three True Immortals had already fallen by Chu Feng’s hands.

“Woosh~~~”

However, Chu Feng flashed past them. He did not attack the bystanders. Instead, he was directly flying toward the Kong Heavenly Clan.

However, the overwhelming killing intent emitted by Chu Feng caused the crowd’s hair to stand on end. Some people were so scared that their legs grew weak.

Everyone was frightened by Chu Feng.

After a moment of panic, someone turned to ask Zhuge Mingren, “Senior Zhuge, do you know... what little friend Chu Feng is planning to do?”

After all, only Zhuge Mingren knew the full details as to what happened.

Zhuge Mingren sighed. He looked to the direction of the Kong Heavenly Clan and said, “I fear that today a great catastrophe will befall the Kong Heavenly Clan.”
