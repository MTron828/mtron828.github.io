Chapter 3458 - Black-feathered Specter

When Chu Feng returned, there were not only countless complicated gazes looking at him, but countless voice transmissions also reached his ears.

Those were all people trying to curry favors by flattering him.

However, Chu Feng completely ignored all of them. Those people were clearly about to launch a suppression of him earlier. Yet, they were suddenly flattering and fawning over him. Vile people like them who would take advantage of the situation were not people that Chu Feng wished to associate with.

Tantai Xing’er seemed to also have sensed that Chu Feng did not wish to interact with those people. Thus, she found an excuse and brought Chu Feng and the others away.

Of course, Chu Feng bid his farewells to Gong Qing because of that.

After all, Chu Feng and Wuma Shengjie were going to follow Tantai Xing’er to meet Wuming Xingyun. Gong Qing would naturally not be able to accompany them.

Tantai Xing’er knew that Chu Feng was rushing to see Wuming Xingyun. Thus, she directly brought Chu Feng to his residence.

Although Wuming Xingyun was invited to the Tantai Heavenly Clan as an important guest, he did not receive excessive hospitality after arriving at the Tantai Heavenly Clan. Instead, he had directly enclosed himself to help remove Bai Liluo’s seal.

To Chu Feng’s joy, when he arrived at Wuming Xingyun’s residence, Wuming Xingyun was already waiting for him.

“Senior, has my big sister’s seal been removed?” After hearing from Wuming Xingyun, Chu Feng felt even more joyous.

“Not only has her seal been removed, she’s recovering pretty well too,” Wuming Xingyun replied with a faint smile. Inadvertently, he revealed a proud expression.

After all, Bai Liluo’s inverse seal was not something easily removed. His helping Chu Feng in removing that seal had indirectly shown his own strength.

“Thank you senior. This junior will deeply remember senior’s help. In the future, if there is anything that senior needs this junior to help with, even if I am tasked to climb a mountain of blades or enter a sea of flames, this junior will not hesitate to do so,” Chu Feng spoke with his fist clasped.

“Truly?” Wuming Xingyun asked.

“Truly,” Chu Feng spoke with certainty. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“There’s no need to climb a mountain of blades or enter a sea of flames. It would do if you are to become my disciple,” said Wuming Xingyun.

“This...” Wuming Xingyun’s words not only shocked Chu Feng; they also shocked Wuma Shengjie and Tantai Xing’er.

“Haha. I was merely joking. Young friend Chu Feng, you don’t have to be so nervous.”

“Actually, this old man never planned to take a disciple. After all, being by myself is more free,” Wuming Xingyun laughed. He was sincere as he said those words, as he had indeed never taken a disciple. Even when the people from the Starfield Master Realm wanted to learn world spirit techniques from him, he would only pick a couple that he liked and give them some instructions to assist them. Never had he ever taken anyone as his disciple.

That said, Wuming Xingyun had also never joked like that with anyone.

Thus, Chu Feng, Wuma Shengjie and Tantai Xing’er all knew that Wuming Xingyun most likely really did want to take Chu Feng as his disciple.

After all, Chu Feng was such a talented individual. Which grandmaster wouldn’t want to find a person like Chu Feng as their successor?

Merely, Wuming Xingyun was also able to tell that Chu Feng didn’t wish to become anyone’s disciple. That was why he said it was only a joke. He was merely trying to give himself and Chu Feng a way out of the embarrassing situation.

Suddenly, Wuming Xingyun asked, “Oh, that’s right. Young friend, I’ve heard that you’ve refused both Grandmaster Liangqiu and Grandmaster Long Xuan? Is that true?”

Once he asked that question, Tantai Xingyun also revealed a curious gaze as she looked to Chu Feng.

They seemed to all want to know if Chu Feng had really refused Grandmaster Liangqiu and Grandmaster Long Xuan’s request to take him as their disciple.

“It is true that this junior doesn’t plan to become a disciple of anyone,” said Chu Feng.

While Wuming Xingyun was still calm after hearing those words, Tantai Xing’er was completely shocked.

It was one thing to refuse Grandmaster Long Xuan. However, Grandmaster Liangqiu was the publicly accepted strongest world spiritist of the Ancestral Martial Starfield.

Furthermore, he had become a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist. He was only a step away from becoming a legendary God-cloak World Spiritist.

Chu Feng had even refused someone like him? This made Tantai Xing’er feel that Chu Feng was someone with great ambitions.

Thus, Tantai Xing’er looked at Chu Feng with not only shock in her eyes, but also a slight bit of a different expression.

She had a whole new level of respect for Chu Feng.

“It would appear that young friend Chu Feng aspires to travel far and make your mark. Very well. That sort of disposition is something that this old man appreciates,” Wuming Xingyun sighed in admiration. It seemed that he was thinking the same thing as Tantai Xing’er.

Actually, their reaction was understandable. After all, any normal person would think that way too.

Only Chu Feng himself knew that he had refused Grandmaster Liangqiu and Grandmaster Long Xuan because he had made a pledge that he would not become anyone’s disciple again. Otherwise... Chu Feng would naturally want to maintain a very close relationship with someone like Grandmaster Liangqiu.

Ignoring others, one thing could be certain. If Chu Feng were to become Grandmaster Liangqiu’s disciple, how would the Li Heavenly Clan possibly dare to declare war on their Chu Heavenly Clan?

Chu Feng knew very well the benefits and drawbacks to becoming Grandmaster Liangqiu’s disciple.

However, as Chu Feng had already made a vow, he would not go back on his word.

“Young friend Chu Feng, come, let’s go and have a look at your big sister,” Wuming Xingyun said.

“Senior, are we able to come too?” Tantai Xing’er asked. She had actually only heard that Chu Feng’s friend was sick, and needed Wuming Xingyun’s help with treatment. She had never met Chu Feng’s big sister. Thus, she was rather curious.

“Regarding that... it would depend on young friend Chu Feng,” Wuming Xingyun looked at Chu Feng.

“Let us go together,” said Chu Feng.

Wuming Xingyun led Chu Feng and the others to the location where he had treated Bai Liluo.

It was a very hidden location. There was only a single entrance. Wuming Xingyun had even set up a spirit formation around the entrance.

Thus, even the people from the Tantai Heavenly Clan would find it very difficult to enter that place.

However, after Chu Feng and the others entered, they were all confused.

The reason for that was because that place was completely empty. Bai Liluo was nowhere to be seen.

“Senior, where’s my big sister? Did she go somewhere else?” Chu Feng asked.

“No, that’s impossible. She couldn’t have left. That spirit formation of mine is still intact. This means that she didn’t leave,” Wuming Xingyun said. Compared to Chu Feng and the others, Wuming Xingyun actually had a nervous look on his face.

“Ah?” Hearing Wuming Xingyun’s words and then seeing his current expression, Chu Feng’s expression changed.

Chu Feng had thought that Bai Liluo must’ve gone out, since she wasn’t there. He did not expect Wuming Xingyun’s reaction to be so intense.

This meant that Bai Liluo had most likely not left. It was very possible that something had happened to her.

Thus, Chu Feng began to carefully examine the place. Upon doing so, he discovered that there there was a black feather on the bed.

The black feather was very thin, long and glossy. Furthermore, it was emitting a faint stink. At a glance, Chu Feng was unable to tell what sort of animal’s feather it was.

“Senior, did you leave this?” Chu Feng asked.

“No,” Wuming Xingyun shook his head.

Suddenly, Tantai Xing’er let out a shriek. “Heavens! That’s the Black-feathered Specter!”

Chu Feng’s heart grew tense upon seeing the current Tantai Xing’er. He cried out ‘oh no’ in his heart.

Chu Feng saw fear in Tantai Xing’er’s eyes.

It was very intense fear!!!
