Chapter 3135 - Strange Fog

Chapter 3135 - Strange Fog

"Humph, pretending to be a virtuous person," After Chu Feng left, Chu Haoyan muttered in a very displeased manner.

"Little brother Haoyan, you should not forget who it was that risked his life to save us when we were being humiliated earlier, who it was that obtained justice for us and stayed to stop the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan’s reinforcements all alone so that we could escape."

"Ask yourself honestly. Was Chu Feng really concerned about us, or was he pretending to be a virtuous man?" Chu Qing said to Chu Haoyan.

"But am I wrong? The world of martial cultivators is a world where cultivation is of the greatest importance. Right now, this undercurrent of the Immortal River will only last a short while. If we do not seize this opportunity to train, we will simply be wasting it."

"Forget about it, do as you want. I will not waste this opportunity."

After Chu Haoyan said those words, he leapt into the undercurrent.

Chu Qing was not angered by Chu Haoyan’s reaction.

The reason for that was because Chu Qing saw a trace of guilt in Chu Haoyan’s face when he said those words earlier.

This meant that he felt ashamed for saying that Chu Feng was pretending to be a virtuous person earlier.

Regardless of how much he detested Chu Feng before, and even if he still detested Chu Feng greatly at that moment, he had realized that Chu Feng had truly given a lot for them.

Chu Qing felt that for someone of Chu Haoyan’s temperament to have this sort of change was already a very good thing. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

......

Chu Feng once again entered that vast cave. He began to search for Chu Shuangshuang. Compelled by circumstances, Chu Feng even began to interrogate the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clansmen he encountered.

That said, even with that being the case, Chu Feng still found no trace of Chu Shuangshuang. With the situation being like that, Chu Feng started to panic slightly.

If Chu Shaungshuang was truly captured by the people from the Cyanfeather Monstrous clan, although there would be no danger to her life, she would definitely be tortured.

This was especially true as they had offended the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan earlier. If Chu Shuangshuang were to be captured, she would be in enormous danger.

Chu Feng knew very well that if one’s soul was ravaged repeatedly, even if it remained intact, one would still suffer mental damages, and even go insane or lose one’s memories.

Moreover, should one end up suffering mental damages, it would be very difficult to cure it.

With no alternative, Chu Feng had no choice but to continue deeper into the cave. In fact, Chu Feng changed his target to the people from the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan. Whenever he encountered people from the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan, Chu Feng would carefully inspect them to see if they showed any sign of having captured Chu Shuangshuang.

Unfortunately, Chu Feng still found no clues.

“Chu Feng, I will not say anything about your decision to miss the opportunity to train in the undercurrent of the Immortal River. However, if you are to continue to enter deeper into this cave, you will likely end up encountering experts from the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan. At that time, not to mention being unable to save Chu Shuangshuang, you yourself will also end up suffering,” Her Lady Queen was unable to keep herself from warning Chu Feng.

One must know that Her Lady Queen was the person who had always cared for Chu Feng the most.

Her Lady Queen did not care about the lives and deaths of Chu Feng’s friends. She only wanted Chu Feng to obtain more benefits.

That undercurrent of the Immortal River was most definitely a chance encounter for Chu Feng.

However, Her Lady Queen did not say anything when Chu Feng decided to give up training in the undercurrent to search for Chu Shuangshuang. The reason for that was because she knew that Chu Feng had always considered certain people to be of enormous importance.

Even though certain people simply did not have that deep of a relationship with Chu Feng, even though Her Lady Queen felt that there was simply no need for Chu Feng to invest so much for them, she knew that as long as Chu Feng decided that he would concern himself with them, everything she said would be useless.

Evidently, Chu Shuangshuang was one such individual to Chu Feng. That was the reason why Her Lady Queen did not attempt to persuade Chu Feng to not save Chu Shuangshuang. She was respecting Chu Feng.

However, the situation at hand was different. If Chu Feng were to continue to go deeper into the cave, even his own safety would be at risk. With the situation being like that, Her Lady Queen was unable to sit and watch indifferently anymore.

“Eggy, rest assured. I have a plan in mind,” Chu Feng replied to Eggy with a smile on his face.

Hearing those words, Her Lady Queen felt very helpless. She knew that her persuasion had been useless once again.

Strangely, the deeper into the cave Chu Feng went , the fewer Cyanfeather Monstrous Beasts he saw.

Furthermore, after going deep into the cave, Chu Feng actually discovered a thick fog in the vast cave.

The white fog resembled a sea, filling one’s eyesight completely.

Originally, the fog was not so bad. While standing outside of the fog, Chu Feng was able to see through the fog without even using his Heaven’s Eyes.

However, after Chu Feng actually entered the fog, he discovered that everything had changed. From white, the fog gradually turned multi-colored. Chu Feng’s line of sight also became obscured by the thick fog.

Chu Feng not only had to use his Heaven’s Eyes to see through the fog, but he was also only able to see a limited distance even using his Heaven’s Eyes.

“This fog is so strange. Could it be a trap laid by the Cyanfeather Monstrous Beasts?” Her Lady Queen asked nervously.

“No, it is likely that we have encountered a fortunate opportunity,” Chu Feng said.

“An opportunity? Could it be... this is related to that Immortal Crystal Ore?” Her Lady Queen asked.

“With my Heaven’s Eyes, I am able to see through it a bit. This place is definitely related to the Immortal Crystal Ore,” Chu Feng said.

“This is great. There is simply no sign of the Cyanfeather Monstrous Beasts here. It would appear that they’ve yet to discover this place. Chu Feng, this is an enormous opportunity. You’ve already missed that undercurrent of the Immortal River, you cannot miss this Immortal Crystal Ore too.”

“You must know that you have offended the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan now, and must quickly increase your strength. Otherwise, how could you possibly contend against them?”

“In a place like this, you have no one to rely on. You can only rely on yourself. Not only that, but all those Chu Heavenly Clansmen will have to rely on you too,” Her Lady Queen said.

“My Eggy, you don’t need to say anymore. Even without the Immortal Crystal Ore, I will still not leave this fog,” Chu Feng said.

“Ah? Why is that?” Hearing what Chu Feng said, Her Lady Queen felt a bit lost.
