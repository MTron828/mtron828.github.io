Chapter 5946: Let Me Try The Prowess of Your Netherworld Sect’s World Spiritist

Meanwhile, a group of people barged into the underground chamber where Song Yun was imprisoned. Leading the group was a chubby man with a fair complexion.

His name was Chen Hui, and Chu Feng would have recognized him. They met when Chu Feng participated in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s entrance examination.

Chu Feng had a favorable impression of Chen Hui. He even tried looking for the latter after the entrance examination ended, but the latter was nowhere to be found.

Yet, Chen Hui was now wearing the Netherworld Sect’s red robes, and his entourage were all Netherworld Generals.

One of the guards for Song Yun’s cell weakly spoke up, “Young master Chen Hui, you can’t...”

“Scram.”

A single word from Chen Hui sent the guards fleeing.

Chen Hui pushed the cell door open and saw Song Yun sitting quietly inside.

She was neither tied up nor injured. She sat on an exquisite chair in the middle of this eerie cell, her legs leisurely crossed. She took nibbles from the plate of snacks placed on a table in front of her while reading a martial art scroll.

She didn’t look concerned at all.

“Little sister Yun’er, are you fine?” Chen Hui asked.

“Does it look like I’m not fine?” Song Yun stowed away the scroll and smiled sweetly.

“I heard...”

Before Chen Hui could finish his sentence, Song Yun replied, “It’s true.”

“Why are you so foolish? There are other ways to help Chu Feng. You don’t need to go this far!” Chen Hui panicked.

The Netherworld Sect had strict rules. Even he would have no way of saving Song Yun if she was convicted of the crime of murdering their fellow sectmembers.

“I told you. What you heard is all true,” Song Yun emphasized.

“You really killed them?” Chen Hui asked.

“Mm, but it’s fine. We have already inspected the Demon Netherworld Tower. I am confident.”

“How confident are you?”

“10%”

“...” Chen Hui was rendered speechless. This was no different from jumping off a cliff! “Are you using this as a chance to challenge the Demon Netherworld Tower, or are you simply trying to help Chu Feng?”

“Both,” Song Yun replied.

“If you wish to challenge the Demon Netherworld Tower, you can do so without resorting to this. If your goal is to help Chu Feng, your efforts have ended in vain. Lord Nine Demons has issued a kill order on Chu Feng. You’re achieving nothing by shouldering this burden,” Chen Hui said.

“Did Chu Feng kill one of our sectmembers?”

Song Yun was baffled. She knew that Lord Nine Demons wouldn’t go after Chu Feng over the Immortal Slaughterers, since those without Netherworld Embryos wouldn’t be considered as proper sectmembers. Using that as a justification to go after Chu Feng was insufficient.

Something else must have happened to give Lord Nine Demons the legitimacy to hunt down Chu Feng. He must have either killed a Netherworld Sectmember, or he was caught trying to save Xianhai Yu’er.

“Chu Feng killed one of our sectmembers after you were imprisoned. I investigated the matter, and it doesn’t seem to be Chu Feng’s doing. Something is amiss here,” Chen Hui said.

“What do you mean?”

“Someone is trying to frame Chu Feng.”

“Frame Chu Feng? I’m not surprised. Surrendering Chu Feng to the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion could reap handsome rewards, but even if not for that, he still has many things worth coveting, such as the legendary Ruler’s Bloodline and the Genesis Bloodline. And that is just the tip of the iceberg. To be honest, even I am tempted too. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“But that Nine Demons is trying to use our Netherworld Sect to satisfy his greed? How dare he touch someone I’m protecting? Tsk tsk, very well. I’ll show him how vindictive I, Song Yun, am.”

Those words were spoken with a light-hearted tone, but Song Yun wasn’t smiling at all. Her eyes were suffocatingly cold.

However, Chen Hui was already used to seeing such a look on her face. He had long known that this girl from the Nine Souls Galaxy was no pushover, and that was why he fancied her.

Boom!

The earth suddenly shook intensely. The tremors weakened after some time, but they persisted.

Chen Hui quickly made his way out of the cell, and Song Yun followed him.

“Miss Song Yun, you can’t...” One of the guards tried to stop Song Yun.

“Scram!” But a single bellow from Chen Hui intimidated the guard.

“Don’t worry, I won’t escape. I just want to see what’s happening. I’ll just stand at the entrance.” In contrast, Song Yun’s attitude was much gentler.

“A-all right.” The guard had no choice but to let the matter go.

Through their observation means, they peered through the ceiling to look at the outside world. Both Chen Hui and Song Yun narrowed their eyes in shock.

A massive barrier was enveloping the sky, and it would soon cover the entire realm.

Those residing in this realm were alarmed. While the Netherworld Sect had set up its base here, it had done so discreetly without alarming anyone, so most locals in this realm didn’t know about their presence.

All of a sudden, Bluesnow Upper Realm became a cage.

Explosions continued to echo from the neighboring Littlelight Upper Realm. This made them realize that they had been caught in a fight between powerhouses. Something huge must have happened!

Thus, they were baffled when the Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s formation enveloped their realm earlier and all their teleportation formation stopped working. It made them realize that they were trapped inside Bluesnow Upper Realm.

The explosion that echoed from the neighboring Littlelight Upper Realm suggested that something huge must have happened—there was a fight between powerhouses.

This filled the locals’ hearts with fear. Many thought their realm was going to be destroyed.

As for the Netherworld Sectmembers, they were also confused. They could tell that this was their Netherworld Sect’s means, but they couldn’t understand the rationale behind it. Were they trying to trap themselves in here?

“What’s going on? Why did we set up a sealing formation too?” Even Chen Hui was baffled.

Song Yun pondered about it. Did the Immortal Sea Fish Clan arrive earlier than I thought to rescue Xianhai Yu’er? Or did Chu Feng use some other means to save her?

She didn’t think that the Netherworld Sect would activate a sealing formation for no reason. Most likely, it was a way to prevent Xianhai Yu’er from escaping.

Meanwhile, Chu Feng was also looking at the sealing formation in the sky, but he still didn’t complete his concealment formation either. Instead, he continued biding his time.

Soon, the sealing formation was completed, and the tremors died down.

Shortly after, the earth trembled once more, but the tremors this time around were so weak that even ordinary cultivators couldn’t sense it, let alone mortals. However, Chu Feng’s eyes further narrowed.

His hands, which had stopped for a long time, began to move. He was finishing up the incomplete formation.

He had finally seen it, the enemy’s detection formation!

The minuscule tremors were caused by an overwhelmingly powerful detection formation enveloping the realm. It was many times stronger than the sealing formation that had isolated them from the rest of the world, yet it was so discreet that hardly anyone noticed it.

If Chu Feng wanted to neutralize the effects of the detection formation, he would have constructed his formation just as the detection formation was activated.

His enemy was far stronger than him, so the only way he stood a chance was to wait for the enemy to begin constructing their detection formation, look for loopholes in it, and exploit them.

As the detection formation unleashed, Chu Feng turned his attention away from the sky and devoted it to his incomplete formation. It was not that he didn’t want to continue examining the detection formation, but its loopholes were swiftly disappearing as it took shape.

However, Chu Feng thought that the loopholes he had found at the very start were sufficient.

He moved fast and finished constructing his concealment formation before the detection formation could fully envelop the realm and activate.

After some thought, he dragged Little Fishy out of the formation he had placed her in to rouse her consciousness, though she showed no signs of waking up to this point. However, this was to be expected, as the Netherworld Sect must have used special means to keep her unconscious. It wouldn’t be that easy to wake her up.

Chu Feng placed Little Fishy on the floor and constructed a formation around her. He couldn’t guarantee that the concealment formation he had constructed was effective, so to be safe, he decided to stack another concealment formation on her.

If the enemy found him, he would use himself as bait to distract the enemy while Little Fishy continued hiding.

After he was done placing a formation on Little Fishy, he took out a fistful of pills and stuffed them into his mouth. Some were recovery pills, some were painkillers, and some boosted his spirit power. It looked as if he had randomly grabbed a bunch of pills, but he had meticulously selected them.

Just then, the detection formation was finally complete. It began to whir into activation.

“Let’s see how strong your Netherworld Sect’s world spiritists are.”

Chu Feng stood up and placed his hands into the formation. With a roar, his spirit power gushed into the formations around him and Little Fishy.

The stand-off finally began!
