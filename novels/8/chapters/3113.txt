Chapter 3113 - Grandfather’s Present

“Chu Feng, the reason why I want you to enter the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm is most definitely not to have you guide our Chu Heavenly Clan back into the Overlord Region.”

“If that were the case, it would be meaningless to enter the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm. After all, even if you manage to enter the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm’s Overlord Region, you will still have to end up leaving the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm. It is impossible to stay there forever.”

“Even if you happen to successfully lead our Chu Heavenly Clan into the Overlord Region while there, our Chu Heavenly Clansmen will still be driven out when you leave the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm,” The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“Senior, in that case, why did you want me to enter the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm?” Chu Feng asked.

“Chu Feng, there are a lot of cultivation resources in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm. However, the best cultivation resources are all located in the Overlord Region.”

“That said, some cultivation resources are hidden, and need to be excavated. Otherwise, one will simply not be able to obtain them.”

“Back then, when your grandfather and I were young, during the time when we occupied the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm’s Overlord Region, we discovered a place with hidden cultivation resources.”

“Although the cultivation resources that were hidden there could not be said to be extremely exceptional, they were very beneficial to me back then, and will be to you now.”

“However, as that cultivation resource was hidden extremely well, we had to use a spirit formation to incubate its power. However, the incubation period was extremely long. We felt that even if we are unable to use its power, it would benefit our Chu Heavenly Clansmen that would come after us.”

“When your father’s generation entered the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm, we mentioned this matter to them too. However, when your father and the others returned, they said that the cultivation resource was still not done incubating, that they were unable to use it.”

“However, according to your father’s estimation, that cultivation resource should have finished incubating by now. It should be capable of being used now.”

“That is why I want you to enter the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm. After all, only you will be able to successfully obtain that cultivation resource,” The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“In that case, wouldn’t it mean that I will get to enjoy the cultivation resources that senior and my grandfather left behind for us?” At that moment, Chu Feng revealed an excited expression.

Even though that cultivation resource belonged to the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm to begin with, it remained to be something that Chu Feng’s grandfather had discovered. If it wasn’t for the spirit formation set up by his grandfather, that cultivation resource would not have been able to be excavatable..

Thus, Chu Feng viewed that cultivation resource as a gift from his grandfather. Because of that, he became extremely excited, and looked forward to it greatly.

“Indeed, you can say that,” The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief smiled lightly. As he spoke, he extended his finger and pointed at Chu Feng’s forehead.

At the moment when the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief’s finger touched Chu Feng’s forehead, a faint light emerged from his fingertip and entered Chu Feng’s head.

At that moment, a map and a formation diagram appeared in Chu Feng’s head.

The map was the location where the cultivation resource was hidden. As for that formation diagram, it was the formation to find the cultivation resource.

Neither of those two items were dispensable.

For the sake of preventing the cultivation resource from being obtained by others, Chu Feng’s grandfather had spent great effort in concealing it.

Thus, if one did not know about the map or the formation, it would be extremely difficult to find out where the hidden cultivation resource was.

“Senior, who else will be accompanying me this time around?” Chu Feng asked.

“How did you know that you were going to have company?” The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief asked with a smile on his face.

“You have five keys in your hand. As for me, I only need one. You wouldn’t possibly waste the other four keys, no?” Chu Feng said.

“Indeed, apart from you, I also want to have four other individuals accompany you. I guess it could be considered training for them,” The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“Senior, may I know who those four people might be?” Chu Feng asked.

“Chu Qing, Chu Haoyan, Chu Huanyu and Chu Shuangshuang.”

After saying those words, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief seemed to be afraid that Chu Feng wouldn’t understand the situation. He continued, “I believe you are quite familiar with Chu Qing, Haoyan and Huanyu already.”

“As for Chu Shuangshuang, she is a bit older than you all. She is almost three hundred years old this year. However, that age is actually quite young in the world of martial cultivators.”

“Perhaps our clansmen that are training in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm right now might not know the four of you. However, Shuangshuang knows them. As such, it would make communication better should Shaungshaung bring you all there.”

“What do you think of the four of them accompanying you?” The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief asked.

His tone was not only soft, it even seemed to be seeking Chu Feng’s approval. If Chu Feng wasn’t willing to have them accompany him, he would immediately change the candidates.

Likely, Chu Feng was the only person of the younger generation among all the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations that could receive this sort of treatment. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Chu Feng is only a member of our Chu Heavenly Clan. If senior feels that it is feasible, then it is feasible,” Chu Feng said.

“Good spirit. You are exactly like your father, broad-minded and open.”

“Actually, I know that you have had conflicts with Huanyu and Haoyan.”

“However, they are also members of our Chu Heavenly Clan. Even if there are grudges between you all, you should still turn hostility into friendship, and not kill one another.”

“I know that you understand that principle. However, they still do not understand it. That’s why I hope that we can use entering the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm to have them understand the importance of our clansmen standing united,” The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“Senior, while I understand the principle, I will not be courteous to anyone, regardless if they’re our clansmen or outsiders, should they touch my baseline,” Chu Feng said.

“This old man understands. If they are to do something too excessive to you, you can take care of them. This old man gives you the authority to do so,” The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said with a smile.

“Thank you for your confidence in me, senior,” Chu Feng returned a smile.

The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief treated Chu Feng extremely well.

“Milord, this is bad!” Right at that moment, an elder’s panic-filled shout suddenly sounded from outside the palace.
