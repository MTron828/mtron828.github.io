MGA: Chapter 874 - Coincidentally Meeting Yan Ruyu

At that moment, in order to concoct a cure for Zi Ling’s Heaven Gripping Pellet, Lady Piaomiao had remained isolation for quite a while, and it was said she still needed more time before coming out.

Since Chu Feng didn’t really like Xia Yu and Dong Xue, nor was he too familiar with Qiu Zhu, when he had requests, he always enjoyed looking for Chun Wu.

“Senior Chun Wu, I’ll take my leave first.” However, before entering Chun Wu’s palace, Chu Feng heard a rather familiar voice.

*jii—*

Just as Chu Feng prepared to knock on the door, it was suddenly opened. At the same time, a familiar person appeared within Chu Feng’s line of sight.

A tall figure, a bewitching body, white skin, charming face, and a unique aura—that person was Yan Ruyu.

After she saw Chu Feng, she couldn’t help but be taken aback. Her beautiful eyes glittered endlessly—she was panicking slightly.

Chu Feng lowered his head, a bit embarrassed, when he saw Yan Ruyu. He didn’t dare to look straight at her, because at that moment, he unavoidably recalled the scene of forcing her in the bed back then in the Azure Province.

But that was a thing of the past. After all, it had been quite a while, so following just an instant of hesitation, Chu Feng put on a light smile, raised his head, and wanted to greet Yan Ruyu.

*whoosh*

But who would have expected before Chu Feng spoke, she had already moved and passed Chu Feng, leaving behind only a faint bodily fragrance.

Chu Feng did seem to expect that to occur, so he dryly chuckled, but didn’t brood on that for too long. He strode forth and prepared to enter.

“Chu Feng.” But when Chu Feng put one foot past the doors, Yan Ruyu had spoken.

“What is it?” Chu Feng turned his head around. He saw that she had already stopped and was looking at himself with a gaze containing complicated emotions.

“Thank you,” Yan Ruyu said with a gentle tone, then after meaningfully looking at Chu Feng, she turned around, and left.

Seeing her fading figure, a relieved smile was worn on Chu Feng’s face. From her eyes, he could tell Yan Ruyu didn’t hate him at all. Instead, there was a hint of gratitude.

The old grudge with Yan Ruyu was finally resolved.

“Junior Chu Feng, what are you doing standing at the entrance?”

Just at that moment, Chun Wu’s voice rang out. When Chu Feng looked into the palace, he saw Chun Wu smiling as she looked at him.

“Senior Chun Wu.” Chu Feng walked in.

“Junior Chu Feng, didn’t you say Junior Yan was your friend? Back then, you too had done quite a bit in order to save her! However, judging by that just now, you don’t seem too close to her.

“Have you hid anything from me?” The intelligent Chun Wu instantly saw that the relationship between Chu Feng and Yan Ruyu wasn’t close. They were definitely not friends.

“To be honest, Senior Chun Wu, we are indeed not friends, and there was even a misunderstanding before! So, I suppose I owed her,” Chu Feng said with a bitter smile.

“No matter if you owed her or not, you’ve done enough for her. Even if there was a disagreement, it’s been compensated by now. After all, it was you who saved her life.

“But, don’t worry. Although Junior Yan doesn’t speak much, and it feels that there’s a layer between us, I don’t think she’s a bad person. I will still take care of her even without you asking. Also, my master likes her as well.”

As if afraid Chu Feng worried she wouldn’t take care of Yan Ruyu because of their distant relationship, Chun Wu specially expressed her thought towards Chu Feng.

“Thank you, Senior Chun Wu.” Chu Feng was truly thankful for Chun Wu’s concern. Concern not only directed towards Yan Ruyu, but also directed towards himself and everyone close to him. It could even be said she was the closest person to him in the Misty Peak, and also one who helped him with all her power.

And, the greater the intimacy, the less the constraint. So, Chu Feng said with a smile, “However, I have come here because I have a request, Senior Chun Wu.”

“You are my savior! If you say another word of thanks, I’ll kick you out!” Chun Wu curled her lips, feigning anger. Then, she said with a smile, “What is it? Just say it. If I can do it, I will help you with my full strength.”

“Senior Chun Wu, you remember I got a Taboo martial skill at the Martial Marking Immortal Realm, right? Since the requirement of it was too high, I have yet to do much with it.

“However, right now, I feel like I can give it a try. So, I’m preparing to cultivate it,” Chu Feng said. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“You... Don’t scare me like that! If I remember correctly, the martial skill you got was an Earthen Taboo martial skill!

“According to my master, that’s a martial skill even Martial Kings have difficulty controlling! Its power is very frightening, and it has extremely high requirements on one’s physical body. Its cultivation difficulty is very high as well.

“Junior Chu Feng, although your strength is very powerful, that Earthen Taboo martial skill is too fierce! You cannot rashly cultivate it; otherwise, if there’s a tiny bit of a mistake, it can possibly leave permanent damage to your physical body! It will also have an unimaginable effect on your future cultivation!” After knowing Chu Feng wanted to cultivate that Earthen Taboo martial skill, Chun Wu’s complexion changed greatly. She hurriedly attempted to convince him otherwise.

“Senior Chun Wu, thank you for your good intentions, but I more or less understand the requirements of this Earthen Taboo martial skill. I truly feel like I can attempt it right now, so that’s why I want to give it a try,” Chu Feng said with a smile. Moreover, there was not a single trace of fear on his face. Instead, it was filled with confidence.

“Junior Chu Feng, are you certain?” The worry on Chun Wu’s face instantly became shock.

“Senior Chun Wu, you’ve known me for so long! Have I ever lied to you?

“Believe me. If I don’t have a certain grasp on it, I wouldn’t even go touch that Earthen Taboo martial skill.

“I know it is very difficult to cultivate. Its difficulty is even dozens of times the Mortal Taboo martial skills, and hundreds of times rank nine martial skills.

“So, I will definitely not force my way through. If I cannot continue, I will stop when appropriate,” Chu Feng said.

“You truly do bring astonishment to others. My master clearly told me even typical Martial Kings find it difficult to successfully cultivate an Earthen Taboo martial skill. Yet you, a Martial Lord, are already preparing.

“Ahh, this is truly infuriating! Sometimes, I truly do suspect whether you are from our world. You wouldn’t be from the Holy Land of Martialism, right?” Chun Wu said with a joking tone.

“Senior Chun Wu, don’t joke with me! If I came from the Holy Land of Martialism, I wouldn’t be in the Eastern Sea Region right now!”

Chu Feng had a bitter smile. Although he didn’t know whether he was from the Holy Land of Martialism, he knew he was likely not from the Eastern Sea Region or the eastern continents.
