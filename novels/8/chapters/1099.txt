MGA: Chapter 1100 - The Sign of Honesty

At this moment, Chu Feng took a glance at the Southern Cyanwood Forest’s Pagoda and discovered that the pagoda only had ten floors. After hearing what the Ascension Sect’s Sectmaster said, Chu Feng knew that every floor of this Southern Cyanwood Forest’s Pagoda would definitely be harder than the previous one.

Thinking till this point, Chu Feng turned his gaze to Bai Ruochen and asked, “Miss Bai, you have also been to the pagoda before. May I know which floor you’ve managed to reach?” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Hearing those words, Bai Ruochen gave Chu Feng a glance of displeasure. Then, she snorted lowly.[1.this is a reference to the tone/pitch of her snort being low.] She did not tell him which floor she had reached. Instead, she expressed a great deal of discontent towards Chu Feng’s question.

At this moment, Bai Ruochen’s mother charmingly smiled and said, “My daughter’s untalented. She has only reached the sixth floor.”

“Oh?” Hearing those words, Chu Feng’s gaze changed slightly. It was as if he had thought of something. However, he did not say anything; instead, he looked to the Ascension Sect’s Sectmaster and asked, “If my guess is correct, senior sectmaster wants Chu Feng to help bring senior’s master’s remains back, right?”

“What little friend Chu Feng says is correct. If you are able to encounter my master’s remains, I wish that you could bring them back intact.” The Ascension Sect’s Sectmaster nodded. Moreover, his tone contained some traces of pleading.

“This is something that I should do. If this junior is capable of coming across senior sectmaster’s master’s remains, I will definitely bring them back.” Chu Feng nodded.

“Little friend Chu Feng, the Southern Cyanwood Forest’s Pagoda is a formation created by Senior Baili Xuankong. The formation is extremely powerful. If my master had not forced himself to climb the pagoda, he would definitely not have lost his life to it. Thus, little friend Chu Feng, you must not force yourself. If you feel that you cannot continue, it would be best for you to give up,” the Ascension Sect’s Sectmaster advised.

“Thank you for the advice, senior. Chu Feng will definitely act within his abilities.” Chu Feng cupped his fist respectfully to express his thanks. After that, he entered the Southern Cyanwood Forest’s Pagoda.

As he entered through the entrance, the first thing that appeared before Chu Feng was a spirit formation gate. After passing through the spirit formation gate, he arrived at the true interior of the Southern Cyanwood Forest’s Pagoda.

The Southern Cyanwood Forest’s Pagoda; when looking at it from the outside, it appeared to be an ordinary-sized ancient pagoda. However, when looked at from the inside, it was completely different.

At the very least, this first floor of the Southern Cyanwood Forest’s Pagoda was very vast. However, this was nothing strange either. This Southern Cyanwood Forest’s Pagoda was an enormous formation to begin with. A powerful world spiritist was capable of creating a vast world. Thus, such a place was not a difficult creation for a world spiritist. Even Chu Feng, with his current abilities, could create one such pagoda.

When Chu Feng entered the Southern Cyanwood Forest’s Pagoda, he indeed felt a pressure. However, this pressure was simply unworthy of mention to Chu Feng.

Like this, Chu Feng did not bother to stay on the first floor for too long. Instead, he immediately began to climb the floors. Every floor that he climbed would increase the pressure. However, the pressure continued to remain within Chu Feng’s range of tolerance.

Chu Feng continued onward unhindered. However, when he reached the sixth floor, he stopped.

The area within the Southern Cyanwood Forest’s Pagoda became narrower the further up one reached. The sixth floor was vastly more narrow than the first floor.

Chu Feng looked to his surroundings, and displayed a smile as if he had seen through something. He said, “The sixth floor’s pressure could stop Bai Ruochen? What a joke.”

After he finished saying those words, Chu Feng continued onward. When he reached the eighth floor, Chu Feng paid especial attention, and inspected his surroundings. However, he did not discover any human remains.

Just like this, Chu Feng continued toward the ninth floor. However, on the staircase connecting the eighth floor to the ninth floor, Chu Feng discovered some human remains.

These human remains appeared to be someone who had been climbing the stairs. It was evident that whoever it had been was trying to reach the ninth floor; unfortunately, that individual did not succeed, and instead died on the stairs.

Upon seeing this pile of human remains, Chu Feng did not even have to think about it to know that it must be the Ascension Sect’s Sectmaster’s master’s remains.

“What a powerful cultivation.” Chu Feng examined the human remains. Although this person had died long ago, and only a pile of bones remained, the bones were nevertheless extraordinary.

They were white like jade, and also emitted a faint glimmer. From a glance, they appeared to be a precious treasure. Actually, this pile of bones could indeed be considered to be a treasure.

When cultivators reach a certain point in their cultivation, their flesh would become extremely valiant. After their death, their cultivation would disappear, and their flesh, having lost the energy from their cultivation, would decompose.

However, the bones were different. The bones of cultivators, even though they might be inferior to the time when they were alive, would still be extremely hard. There were even people who used the bones of experts to create weapons.

As for this pile of bones, the source energy contained within it allowed Chu Feng to know that during the time when the owner of this pile of bones was alive, he was most definitely a Half Martial Emperor-level expert. However, Chu Feng was unable to determine what the exact cultivation of this expert was during the time he was alive.

“Wow, a Half Martial Emperor’s source energy. Quickly, help me absorb and refine it. This Queen will definitely be able to reach a breakthrough in her cultivation.” At this moment, Eggy was extremely excited. To her, the source energy from a Half Martial Emperor level expert was most definitely an object of great supplementary value.

“Eggy, when I enter the Cyanwood Mountain, I’ll help you find source energy. However, as for this pile of human remains, we cannot use its source energy.” Chu Feng said in a difficult manner.

“Why?” Eggy cast a glance at Chu Feng. She was confused.

“I have promised the Ascension Sect’s Sectmaster that I will bring his master’s remains out of the Southern Cyanwood Forest’s Pagoda intact. If we were to refine his master’s remains’ source energy, how could it still be considered to be intact?” said Chu Feng.

“In that case, you can help me refine the source energy and then destroy this pile of bones. Afterwards, when you return, you can just tell them that you never encountered it. Wouldn’t that solve the problem then?” said Eggy.

“To accept one’s request, one must be honest. How could I possibly agree to the request from the Ascension Sect’s Sectmaster and then go on behind his back to do such a dishonest and unjust thing?” said Chu Feng.

“What do you suggest we do then? Are we to return this pile of remains to them? Have you forgotten the treatment they gave you earlier?”

“Moreover, even if you return this pile of Half Martial Emperor remains with their source energy intact, it does not mean that the Ascension Sect’s Sectmaster would not take it for himself. In that case, is it not better for you to use it yourself?” said Eggy.

“I feel that the Ascension Sect’s Sectmaster is a person who greatly reveres his master. Moreover, even if he refined his master’s source energy, that would be his personal business. As for my business, that would be bringing this pile of remains back intact,” said Chu Feng.

“Sigh. Forget about it. I am unable to win against you in an argument. This Queen will give up on this source energy, is that fine now? Go, put it away, let’s continue onward.” Eggy curled her lips. Although she wanted to refine the source energy, she did not get angry because Chu Feng refused to do that for her.

“Eggy, rest assured. After I enter the Cyanwood Mountain, I will find time to help you find source energy to help you restore your strength.”

Although Eggy did not get angry, Chu Feng was still able to tell that she wanted to restore her strength urgently. Thus, he made the resolution to definitely help Eggy in the future. After all, Eggy had done a great deal for him.

“Don’t bother with that, this Queen is not that worried. Moreover, if you wanted to restore my strength, even if you are to exhaust yourself to death, you would not be able to find enough source energy to restore my strength. At the very least, it would be hopeless in this Holy Land of Martialism.”

。”

“You do not have to worry about the matter of source energies. Just help this Queen refine the source energies if you are to come across them. If you do not, then just forget about it. It is more important to spend the time on increasing your strength. If your father was to accept you as his son, wouldn’t the problem be solved if you have him remove the seal on me? I believe that your father would have this ability.”

“Even if your father does not, your mother definitely does. After all, it was her who sealed me in you,” said Eggy.

Hearing those words from Eggy, Chu Feng’s heart felt a burst of warmth. He knew very well that Eggy was thinking for his benefit.

However, the more Eggy acted this way, the more guilty Chu Feng felt. Especially during the moment when he put the pile of bones with the dense source energy away, the guilt he felt at that moment was heart-piercing.

But since he had accepted another’s request, he must be loyal and honest. This source energy was something that Chu Feng could not touch.

Therefore, he decided that in the future, he would definitely find a way to find even better source energy for Eggy. Otherwise, he would not be able to soothe his guilt toward Eggy.
