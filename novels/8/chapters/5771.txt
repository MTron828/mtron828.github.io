Chapter 5771: Jie Baobao’s Teamwork

Shockwaves rippled nonstop in a lush area in the realm.

Jie Baobao was channeling a powerful formation from mid-air to deal with a few hundred-meter-tall formation entities that resembled octopuses. These formation entities came from a humongous spirit formation gate that boasted a height of over ten thousand meters in the sky, but their target was not Jie Baobao but Chu Feng.

Chu Feng was standing in front of a huge formation, attempting to decipher it, whereas the formation entities were seeking to stop him. The closer Chu Feng came to deciphering the formation, the more powerful and numerous the formation entities became.

Despite being an Exalted Dragon World Spiritist with a fighting prowess on par with rank nine Half-God level, Jie Baobao was starting to struggle against those formation entities. Still, she continued to channel her formation with all her might to protect Chu Feng.

Uwa!

A pillar of spirit power suddenly gushed toward her. She failed to dodge in time and suffered injuries on her right arm.

More pillars of spirit power followed, as the formation entities opened their mouths and blasted their attacks toward Jie Baobao. Faced with such a sight, Jie Baobao closed her eyes, knowing that she had reached her limit and couldn’t dodge anymore. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Why are you resting here?” Chu Feng suddenly asked.

Jie Baobao opened her eyes and saw Chu Feng standing in front of her. The formation entities had all disintegrated into spirit power. She quickly turned her head over and saw the formation Chu Feng had been working on had been deciphered.

“You succeeded?” Jie Baobao looked at Chu Feng with conflicted eyes.

It was obvious that Chu Feng had succeeded, or else those formation entities wouldn’t have disappeared, but she still found it hard to believe as she nearly lost her life earlier.

“Of course. You’re truly sincere about working with me. You could have escaped on your own, but you chose to protect me to your dying breath. Is it worth putting your life on the line for a one-time-off partnership?” Chu Feng asked.

“You were testing me?” Jie Baobao’s narrowed her eyes.

Now that she thought about it, it was too much of a coincidence for Chu Feng to have deciphered the formation just as she was about to lose her life. It was likelier that Chu Feng had done it intentionally. He could have deciphered the formation earlier, but he chose not to do so so that he could assess whether she was sincere about their partnership.

“That’s right,” Chu Feng replied.

“Why did you accept my offer to work together if you don’t trust me?” Jie Baobao was livid.

“I accepted your offer to work together because we share the same goals, and it’d be more efficient for us to join forces. However, I don’t know you well as a person, not to mention that you’re from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. Can you give me a reason why I should trust you?” Chu Feng asked.

Jie Baobao fell silent. She had heard about what the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion had done to Chu Feng, so she understood why Chu Feng harbored animosity toward the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.

“Chu Feng, not everyone in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion detests you,” Jie Baobao said after a brief pause.

“Like you?” Chu Feng asked.

“It’s not just me,” Jie Baobao said.

“I know,” Chu Feng replied with a smile as he passed five pebbles to Jie Baobao.

It was the fortuitous encounter from deciphering the formation. These five pebbles had runes inscribed on them, and they could swiftly raise one’s spirit power within a short period of time. On top of that, he also passed a scroll over to her.

“There are ten pebbles in total. Let’s split half-half,” Chu Feng said,

“What’s this?” Jie Baobao asked as she received the scroll.

“It’s an assimilation formation I came up with to best benefit from the pebbles. Of course, you can use your own method too,” Chu Feng replied.

He descended to the ground and began constructing a formation, with the intention of assimilating the pebbles right away. It didn’t take him long to complete the formation.

Jie Baobao was taken aback by that formation.

She had a rough gauge of how skilled Chu Feng was as a world spiritist by now, but her eyes would still light up each time he constructed a formation. The ingenuity of his formations was one thing, but his superior world spiritist technique was equally impressive. It felt like he could bring any formation to another level with his touch.

“Hold on, Chu Feng,” Jie Baobao descended from the sky as she said.

“What’s wrong?” Chu Feng asked.

Jie Baobao took out a scroll and tossed it to Chu Feng. “Why don’t you try this formation? It’s a formation from our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion though, so…”

“I don’t mind,” Chu Feng replied as he received the scroll and unfurled it.

The assimilation formation Jie Baobao had provided him was indeed more potent, as it was specifically tailored to formations on pebbles. With the world spiritist techniques he had grasped from Qin Jiu, he could indeed elevate the prowess of the assimilation formation.

He quickly derived a better way to construct the formation and relayed it to Jie Baobao. The two of them then used the same method to construct the formation to assimilate the five pebbles.

These pebbles might be small, but they were treasures from the Ancient Era. The amount of spirit power they harnessed was not to be made light of.

Chu Feng made a breakthrough from Royal Dragon God-cloak to Immortal Dragon God-cloak, which was comparable to rank seven Half-God level cultivators. Due to his partial awakening of his Ruler’s Bloodline, both his fighting prowess and ability to decipher formations were on par with world spiritists two ranks stronger, which meant that he was as powerful as a Saint-cloak World Spiritist or a rank nine Half-God level cultivator.

On the other hand, Jie Baobao failed to make a breakthrough as her spirit power was stronger than Chu Feng, though she benefited greatly from the assimilation of the pebbles.

“Chu Feng, these pebbles are amazing! I…” Jie Baobao opened her eyes and looked at Chu Feng with a beaming smile. She wanted to tell him that she had a deep epiphany and might soon advance to Saint Dragon God-cloak, only to notice that his spirit power was much stronger than before. Astonished, she asked, “You made a breakthrough?”

“I did. Did you benefit from the pebbles too?” Chu Feng asked.

“I benefited greatly. I really have to thank you for this. I wouldn’t have known that such a treasure was hiding here if not for you, let alone benefit from it,” Jie Baobao said in gratitude.

“You deserve it,” Chu Feng replied.

He had tested Jie Baobao earlier to determine what kind of person she was.

If she had fled earlier, he wouldn’t have done anything since they were only in a temporary partnership. It was normal for her to prioritize her own safety over his.

If she had tried to attack Chu Feng while he was trying to breach the formation, he would have killed her on the spot.

But much to Chu Feng’s surprise, Jie Baobao was so determined to protect him that she nearly lost her life as a result. Due to that, he decided to split half of the reward with her.

She deserved the reward.
