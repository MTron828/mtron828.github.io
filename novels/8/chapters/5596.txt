Chapter 5596: Guild Leader

Chu Feng didn’t see where the madwoman had headed, but he figured she was inside the cavern. He was right on the mark. In fact, the madwoman had released Little Fishy too.

“Big brother!” Little Fishy quickly rose to her feet to run to Chu Feng’s side, only to freeze up right away.

Needless to say, it had to be the madwoman’s doing.

Chu Feng hurriedly took out the Blood Gathering Red Lotus, but before he could pass it over, the item had already fallen into the madwoman’s hand. She took a glance at it before stowing it away.

At the same time, Little Fishy regained her freedom.

“You may leave now,” the madwoman said.

Both Chu Feng and Little Fishy quickly left, fearing that the madwoman would change her mind. But as soon as they rose into the sky, the madwoman’s voice echoed, “Wait a moment.”

“Elder, you have to keep your promise!” Little Fishy protested.

The madwoman ignored Little Fishy and instead turned to Chu Feng.

Weng!

An item appeared on her palm. It was a metal can, presumably the very item that the Wang Clan’s granddaughter had dug out of their old residence.

“You came here for this,” the madwoman pointed out.

Chu Feng looked at Little Fishy, and the latter shook her head, indicating that she didn’t say anything at all. Even so, he had a feeling that the madwoman was somehow certain that he had come to this realm for the metal can.

If it wasn’t Little Fishy who divulged that piece of information, it was possible that the madwoman had overheard his conversation with the Wang Clan’s Clan Chief, even though she was a far distance away.

That wouldn’t have been surprising, considering the powerful means the madwoman possessed. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have been feared by even the galaxy overlords and be deemed a lunatic by the rest of the world.

“Yes, elder. I have come for this item,” Chu Feng honestly confessed.

Shoosh!

The madwoman flicked her finger, and the metal can drifted up to Chu Feng.

“I have examined the metal can. There are three locks on it, but I’m only able to decipher the first lock. If you can decipher the second lock, I’ll concede that you’re fated with this treasure and allow you to have it,” the madwoman said.

“Thank you, elder,” Chu Feng first bowed to the madwoman before he activated his Heaven’s Eyes to examine the metal can. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

He felt an invisible aura rushing at him right away, leaving him feeling uneasy. Yet, when he retracted his Heaven’s Eyes and turned away, the invisible aura quickly dissipated. This must be the metal can’s protective mechanism, but it wasn’t the lock the madwoman was referring to.

So, he prepared himself once more before examining the metal can with his Heaven’s Eyes. The invisible aura rushed at him once more, but it didn’t faze him this time around since he was ready for it.

Much to his surprise, a puzzle-like copper barrier harnessing tremendous defense prowess began to manifest around the metal can. Most likely, this copper barrier was the first lock the madwoman had mentioned.

After a moment of examination, Chu Feng figured that he should be able to decipher the first lock by properly organizing the puzzle-like copper barrier. So, he quickly began rearranging the copper barrier.

The madwoman’s eyes narrowed.

Neither she nor Little Fishy could see the copper barrier, so they could only see Chu Feng’s hands moving around empty space. Nevertheless, she could tell that he was deciphering the first lock.

Weng!

There was a brilliant burst of light, and cracks started appearing around the metal can. Soon, the metal can disintegrated to reveal a silver can underneath.

The silver can was slightly smaller than the copper can, but otherwise, there wasn’t much of a difference between them. The invisible aura that disturbed one’s mind was stronger than before, so much that it disrupted Chu Feng’s focus.

Chu Feng took his time to adjust his state of mind and compose himself. It was only after confirming that he wouldn’t be affected by the invisible aura anymore did he continue examining the metal can.

Soon, a silver barrier manifested around the metal can. This was the second lock. The second lock had to be deciphered in the same way, but the difficulty was much higher.

Chu Feng stared at the silver barrier for a long time. He had first received the metal can in the afternoon, but it was only at nightfall that he finally figured out the way to revert the silver barrier to its original appearance.

Thus, he quickly got to work.

Soon, the silver can emanated a brilliant light, and its surface began to disintegrate. Beneath it was a golden can.

The madwoman finally shifted her gaze from the metal can onto Chu Feng. Awe could be seen in her eyes.

Meanwhile, Chu Feng’s attention remained on the metal can.

The invisible aura coming from the metal can became so much stronger that most people wouldn’t have been able to withstand it. Even Chu Feng was only barely able to withstand the effects of the invisible aura, and even so, his warped expression showed that he was being pushed to his limits.

A golden barrier surfaced around the golden can, but its difficulty was several times greater than the silver barrier. It didn’t help that the mental interference from the invisible aura was hindering his thinking too.

He knew that he had reached his limit, so he withdrew his Heaven’s Eyes.

As soon as Chu Feng retracted his Heaven’s Eyes, the golden can first turned back into a silver can, followed by a copper can, as if nothing had happened.

“You may take it with you,” the madwoman said.

She had already stepped out of the cavern, with her back facing Chu Feng. It looked like she really intended to give the metal can to Chu Feng and leave this area.

“Wait a moment,” Chu Feng suddenly spoke up.

“What is it?” the madwoman turned around and asked.

“Elder, why did you instruct me to acquire the Blood Gathering Red Lotus instead of doing it yourself?” Chu Feng asked.

The madwoman didn’t answer the question. She simply stared at Chu Feng for a few seconds before suddenly vanishing into thin air.

“Big brother, it looks like she isn’t as bad as the rumors put her out to be. She feels more like a secular expert to me,” Little Fishy said.

“You’re speaking up for her even though she imprisoned you?” Chu Feng asked with a smile.

“She freed me as soon as you’re gone. She didn’t answer my questions, but she didn’t make things hard for me either. I think that she wanted to sell you a favor because she’s impressed by your talents. I reckon that she ordered you to obtain the Blood Gathering Red Lotus to serve as a pretext for that,” Little Fishy said.

“Mm.” Chu Feng nodded, though he didn’t fully agree.

He had a feeling that there was more to the situation, but he couldn’t figure out what it was.

…

Meanwhile, Manager Ma Qiang had just settled his affairs for the day and was returning to his bedroom to rest. As soon as he stepped into his bedroom, he immediately put on his guard and asked, “Who is it?”

He sensed that there was someone inside the bedroom. When he finally took a closer look, he hurriedly fell to his knees and kowtowed.

“Paying respects to the guild leader! Please pardon my lack of hospitality. I was unaware of your arrival!” Manager Ma exclaimed.

“I have been here since a long time ago,” the other party said.

“Ah?” Manager Ma was taken aback.

“I saw what you did. You were wise to have chosen to befriend Chu Feng. Here’s your reward for making the right choice.”

A letter flew toward Manager Ma. It was a recommendation letter, promoting Manager Ma to the Martial Cultivator Commerce Guild’s headquarters. When he finally raised his head once more, he found that the guild leader was nowhere to be seen.

Nevertheless, he still kowtowed and said, “Thank you, guild leader.”

As much as he was delighted at having been promoted, he felt fearful as well. The fact that the guild leader had rewarded him meant that the guild leader had a high impression of Chu Feng. Had he made the wrong choice earlier today, that might have spelled the end of his career!
