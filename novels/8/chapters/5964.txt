Chapter 5965: Fool

“You look obedient, but I didn’t expect you to be a bootlicker.” Chu Feng chuckled.

“I-I am not a bootlicker. I am not! I’m just awed.”

“Awed?” Chu Feng asked.

“I have long heard about your feats, and I believed that you pulled them off too. Yet, even those seemingly exaggerated rumors did little to reveal the true extent of your capabilities.” Tongling Yueyue expressed her shock with her quivering voice.

“You’re exaggerating it. I’m not that formidable. I’ll have to personally decipher some of the more difficult formations later on, and there’s a chance I might fail,” Chu Feng said.

“Young hero Chu Feng, you can call my clansmen over to help.”

“Does your Spirituality Sacred Clan not know that there needs to be a main challenger for the formation deciphering? Cooperation is allowed, but of the hundred formations, at least seventy of them need to be personally deciphered by the main challenger. Otherwise, we won’t be able to clear the chess door even with the right formation deciphering sequence.”

“There’s no such record in our Spirituality Sacred Clan. Young hero Chu Feng, how did you figure that out?” Tongling Yueyue looked at Chu Feng with curious eyes.

This was Chu Feng’s first time here, yet he seemed to know more than her.

“There are many clues around us. Don’t worry too much about that. It’s normal for you to be unable to see through it. You would have cleared the chess door by now if you had all of the clues in your hands. Tell your clansmen to decipher these two formations.”

Chu Feng drew a map indicating the positions of two formations before walking away from his newly forged path.

“Young hero Chu Feng, this is the path you have just forged. Aren’t you going to head in and take a look?” Tongling Yueyue asked.

“What’s there to see? We have only deciphered ten out of a hundred formations. Our path will be blocked even if we enter now. Focus on deciphering the formation first. We need to decipher enough formations before we can venture deep into the path.”

Chu Feng continued to decipher some formations while assigning some to the Spirituality Sacred Clansmen. He tried to assign the harder formations to the Spirituality Sacred Clansmen, as that would boost the speed of their formation deciphering.

However, he would still work on some of the harder formations on his own.

What he had told Tongling Yueyue was true. He had to personally decipher at least seventy formations. Even after assigning the hardest ones to the Spirituality Sacred Clan, he still needed to deal with some of them on his own.

The harder formations were dangerous, so Chu Feng had Tongling Yueyue stand a safe distance away while he worked on them alone. However, some of these formations were so difficult that accidents still happened from time to time.

Fortunately, Chu Feng had the death immunity token with him.

He successfully cleared dozens of formations, but at the same time, he depleted his death immunity counts too. Soon, he only had one death immunity count left.

Fortunately, the formations were all successfully deciphered in the correct sequence, allowing Chu Feng and Tongling Yueyue to venture deeper into the remnant. Currently, they have already reached the innermost area of the remnant.

A single gate blocked their path.

This gate was imposing, and it was covered with glowing runes. It was clear that there was a powerful formation embedded in the gate.

“Beyond this gate is the remnant’s core. I’m guessing that your clansmen’s corpses are in there. The remaining ten formations are behind this gate too,” Chu Feng said.

“Thank you, young hero Chu Feng. I would have never gotten this far if not for you. I’ll never forget your magnanimity whether I recover my clansmen’s corpses or not,” Tongling Yueyue said in gratitude.

“Don’t say that. You don’t owe me anything. Our goals merely aligned. I wouldn’t have gotten here so quickly if not for your clansmen deciphering the formations on my behalf too,” Chu Feng said as he began constructing a formation.

Tongling Yueyue quickly backed off.

She knew that Chu Feng still had eleven formations to breach, with this gate being one of them. This gate was a highly difficult formation, such that it took Chu Feng three whole days before he completed his formation.

As soon as the deciphering formation came into contact with the gate, the gate shook. Terrifying killing intent and a pillar of spirit power suddenly rushed at Chu Feng without any warning.

Fortunately, a barrier swiftly enveloped Chu Feng and blocked the attack.

“Young hero Chu Feng!” Tongling Yueyue exclaimed. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Stay back! This formation is dangerous,” Chu Feng said as he retreated from the gate.

“Young hero Chu Feng, have you depleted your death immunity counts?” Tongling Yueyue asked.

“That’s right.” Chu Feng nodded.

“What should we do now?” Tongling Yueyue frowned. She could sense that the formation embedded in the gate was extremely difficult to decipher.

“What else can we do? We have already come this far, so we can’t give up now. The death immunity token is just a bonus; I’d have challenged the formations even if not for it. However, I have to admit that this formation is a tricky one.”

Chu Feng waved his sleeves, and a map appeared.

On the map were the locations of ten formations and their respective sequences.

“Young hero Chu Feng, what do you mean by this?” Tongling Yueyue’s eyes fluttered nervously.

“This gate is the only difficult formation left. The remaining ten formations are easier, though the sequencing is important. I’ll continue working on this formation, but I’m not sure if I’ll succeed. If it works out, we’ll enter the remnant’s core and claim the treasure here. Otherwise, you have the correct sequence in your hands. You can gather your clansmen and try again,” Chu Feng said.

“Young hero Chu Feng, why don’t you let my clansmen help you decipher this formation?” Tongling Yueyue asked.

“That won’t do. Didn’t I tell you that I’m the main challenger? There are requirements I need to fulfill to clear the chess door. I have to personally decipher this gate, or else it wouldn’t count,” Chu Feng said.

He walked up to the gate and channeled his spirit power to decipher the formation.

But as soon as he turned around, a sneer echoed behind him.

“Since that’s the case, I can’t allow you to continue. Otherwise, what am I to do if you clear the chess door and claim the treasure here?

Hundreds of figures simultaneously appeared around Tongling Yueyue. Some of them were Spirituality Sacred Clansmen, but most of them were from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.

Ling Mouzi and Jie Tian were among them too.

All of them were looking at Chu Feng with eyes filled with ridicule.

The person who had just spoken was Ling Mouzi.

“Why are all of you here?” Chu Feng panicked.

“Chu Feng, you have your dumb moments too. You lost your wits as soon as you saw a woman. Isn’t the situation obvious? Why are you still asking why we are here?” Jie Tian sneered with a triumphant smile.

“Paying respect to young master Jie Tian.” Tongling Yueyue kneeled before Jie Tian and kowtowed.

“You... betrayed me?” Chu Feng stared at Tongling Yueyue in shock.

“Young hero Chu Feng, I am grateful for your trust. If not for that, I wouldn’t have been able to make such a huge contribution to the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. Young master Jie Tian is right. You were dumb to have blindly put your trust in me... though I am grateful for that.”

Now that Tongling Yueyue was standing beside Jie Tian, her attitude and disposition were completely different from before. If she looked innocent and amiable before, she now looked vicious and scheming.

“Hah...” Chu Feng suddenly burst into laughter. “There’s no need to thank me. I should be the one thanking you. If not for you, Jie Tian and the others wouldn’t have appeared so easily.”

The crowd raised their eyebrows. They sensed that something was amiss.

Chu Feng formed a hand seal, and the gate behind him exerted a strong burst of spirit power that enveloped everyone present. The spirit power was so powerful that even world spiritists of Ling Mouzi’s caliber were forced to kneel on the ground.

Only one person was unfazed by the spirit power—Chu Feng.

On top of that, Chu Feng took out his death immunity token. The death immunity token glowed, and eight marks surfaced from it. This signified that he still had eight death immunity counts.

Jie Tian’s face paled at that sight. Having once possessed the death immunity token, he knew that the marks were real.

Chu Feng had not depleted any of his death immunity counts while deciphering the formations.

“Trash of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, who do you think is the foolish one now?”

With the death immunity token in hand, Chu Feng sneered at Jie Tian, Ling Mouzi, Ling Yueyue, and the others.
