Chapter 2678 - Law Enforcement Secret Order Title Plate

Chu Feng passed through the light vortex.

However, he did not return to the Stairway to Heaven that led from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.

At that moment, Chu Feng had arrived at a vast mountain.

That mountain did not appear to be special at all. Even the trees growing on the mountain were very common. The tallest tree among them was only over a dozen meters tall.

That mountain could be said to be extremely ordinary.

It was so ordinary that it resembled the mountain in Chu Feng’s youth, the mountain behind the Chu Family household in the Nine Provinces Continent.

Although all of the flowers, plants and trees on that mountain were extremely ordinary, Chu Feng was able to sense that that place was sealed by spirit power.

The oppressive sensation from the spirit formation informed Chu Feng that there were most definitely signs of martial cultivators there.

“What is going on? Could it be that I have been transferred from one world to another world?”

Chu Feng was very surprised. As a Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, Chu Feng’s perception was very strong.

Generally, if it was a space created by a world spiritist, even if it resembled an actual world, Chu Feng would be able to tell that that was the case.

However, regardless of whether it might be the wasteland earlier or the large mountain, Chu Feng was unable to find any fault in them. He felt that those two places... should most likely both be actual worlds.

“This thing changed again.”

Turning around, Chu Feng’s expression changed. That light vortex was still there. Merely, the light vortex once again no longer possessed its attractive force.

Chu Feng attempted to enter the light vortex, and discovered that he was once again unable to do so. He could only remain in that world.

However, Chu Feng did not leave immediately. Instead, he carefully set up a concealment formation to conceal the light vortex.

Although the light vortex was currently shut off, Chu Feng had no idea when the light vortex would open again.

For caution, Chu Feng had decided that it would be better to conceal the light vortex.

Although Chu Feng would not be able to prevent creatures from that wasteland from entering this place should the light vortex activate again, he would at least be able to prevent the people from this world from entering that wasteland.

After Chu Feng concealed the light vortex, he planned to leave that large mountain. He planned to carefully search around to see exactly what sort of place he was in.

“Chu Feng, be careful,” Her Lady Queen’s voice sounded. Deep worry filled her voice.

While that large mountain might appear to be normal, Her Lady Queen was feeling very worried after experiencing what had happened in the wasteland earlier.

“Let me survey this place first.”

That mountain was extremely vast. Even with Chu Feng’s cultivation, he was unable see through the mountain with a glance, and thus utilized his Heaven’s Eyes.

However, even when using his Heaven’s Eyes, Chu Feng was still unable to see the end of the mountain. That mountain was much larger than Chu Feng had anticipated.

“Woosh~~~”

Suddenly, Chu Feng leapt forth. He planned to travel in the sky.

However, Chu Feng had not even managed to leap a hundred meters into the air before he fell to the ground again.

“Chu Feng, what’s wrong?” Her Lady Queen was very confused by Chu Feng’s actions. She felt that something might be amiss.

“Eggy, this place is much more remarkable than I imagined it to be,” Chu Feng started to frown.

“Exactly what has happened? Could it be that you’ve discovered something?” Her Lady Queen grew even more worried.

“This place actually has a restrictive power. I am simply unable to fly in the sky. Even my power has been weakened.”

“However, I actually did not notice this restrictive power at all earlier. It is only after using my martial power that I discovered it,” Chu Feng said.

“In that case, it would mean that this place is the same as that wasteland?” Her Lady Queen asked.

“That’s hard to say. While this place is indeed strange, it is also different from that wasteland.”

“Either way, let’s explore first.”

Chu Feng had been holding onto the Divine Dragon’s Blood Ruler the entire time. Now, he even took out the Evil God Sword.

After experiencing the encounter in the wasteland, Chu Feng did not dare to be careless in the slightest. He did not want to lose his life due to a moment of carelessness.

However, as the mountain was enormous, and Chu Feng had lost the ability to fly, he ended up having to experience the feeling of crossing a mountain again.

That said, the mountain range was even larger than Chu Feng had expected. Thirteen days passed in the blink of an eye, yet Chu Feng was still unable to exit the mountain range.

Meanwhile, at the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Great Law Enforcement Hall.

The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Law Enforcement Hall’s Vice Hall Master, Chu Xuanzhengfa, was sitting in the palace hall master’s seat.

Kneeling beneath him were ten members from the Law Enforcement Hall. Those ten people were the same ten people who had requested to proceed for the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm to capture Chu Bore that day.

“Has Chu Bore been imprisoned?” Chu Xuanzhengfa asked.

“Milord, as per your instructions, Chu Bore has been imprisoned.”

“However, Milord, after we captured Chu Bore, we managed to learn a piece of information. That young man by the name of Chu Feng did not die,” a person who seemed to be the leader of the ten spoke.

“That Chu Feng didn’t die?” Hearing those words, Chu Xuanzhengfa’s expression immediately changed. He hurriedly asked, “Where is he now?”

“When we found out about it, he had already left with several companions and entered the Stairway to Heaven leading to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.”

“Merely...” The leader of the ten hesitated.

“Speak,” Chu Xuanzhengfa urged.

“Merely, when we returned to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, we discovered that... Chu Feng and his companions simply never arrived in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm,” that person said.

“In that case, it would mean that Chu Feng and his companions proceeded for a different Upper Realm using the Stairway to Heaven?” Chu Xuanzhengfa asked.

While something like that was very difficult for people from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm to accomplish, since Chu Xuanzhengfa suspected that Chu Feng was Chu Xuanyuan’s son, he felt that something like that would not trouble Chu Feng.

“Go and investigate exactly which Upper Realm he entered,” Chu Xuanzhengfa said.

The Stairway to Heaven from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm was controlled by the Chu Heavenly Clan.

Although that Stairway to Heaven was not frequently used, the Chu Heavenly Clan was capable of monitoring everything that happened within it. As long as they wanted to investigate, they would be able to find out where Chu Feng and the others went.

“Milord, I have already investigated. Merely, that Stairway to Heaven indicated that its trajectory was clearly from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm to our Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. There was no change to its path at all,” the leader of the ten said.

“Its path wasn’t changed? In that case, where did Chu Feng go?”

“Did he arrive at the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, or is he still in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm?” Chu Xuanzhengfa asked.

“We have already inquired of the people in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. They all personally witnessed Chu Feng and the others entering the Stairway to Heaven and disappearing into it.”

“Merely, the people from our Chu Heavenly Clan that were in charge of guarding the Stairway to Heaven did not see Chu Feng and his companions appearing in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.”

“Even though the Stairway to Heaven was clearly activated, no one appeared,” the leader of the ten said.

At that moment, Chu Xuanzhengfa started to contemplate.

This matter was simply too freakish. It was extremely unreasonable.

“Woosh~~~”

Suddenly, Chu Xuanzhengfa raised his arm. He tossed a title plate to the leader of the ten.

Upon catching that title plate, the ten Law Enforcement Hall members all revealed an enormous change in expression. An ecstatic expression emerged in their eyes.

That title plate was the Law Enforcement Secret Order Title Plate. With that title plate in hand, the people from the Law Enforcement Hall could disregard all constraints placed upon them by the Chu Heavenly Clan’s laws and decrees. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Having that title plate was equivalent to obtaining the highest power in the Law Enforcement Hall.

Generally, to be able to obtain such a title plate would mean that one would have to carry out an extremely important mission.

To the people of the Law Enforcement Hall, being able to receive the Law Enforcement Secret Order Title Plate was the utmost honor.

“Regardless of what it might take, the ten of you must find that Chu Feng,” Chu Xuanzhengfa said.

“Yes, Milord,” the ten people spoke in unison.

“Remember, this matter must be kept confidential. You are not allowed to let anyone know. Furthermore, if you are to find Chu Feng, do not expose your identities. Instead, monitor him secretly, and then report back to me.”

“Furthermore, if you are to find that Chu Feng, you all must guarantee that Chu Feng’s safety,” Chu Xuanzhengfa reminded the ten.

“These subordinates understand,” the ten men spoke in unison again.
