Chapter 2318 - Enjoy The Fruits Of Others

After journeying for some time, Chu Feng and the others arrived at the Extremely Remote Unmarked Burial Mounds.

They encountered a lot of people on their way there. There were people from practically all of the powers. Chu Feng even encountered people from the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall.

However, Chu Feng did not greet them. Instead, he brushed past them.

Moreover, Zhao Hong’s conical bamboo hats were extremely amazing. Not only were they capable of concealing one’s appearance, they were also able to change their own appearance. In fact, even though they were wearing conical bamboo hats, others were simply unable to see those conical bamboo hats. Instead, what they saw were only unfamiliar faces.

Thus, even though Chu Feng brushed past the people from the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall, none of them recognized Chu Feng.

Finally, Chu Feng, Zhao Hong and Wang Qiang arrived at the place Zhao Hong had mentioned.

It was a place far away from the entrance to Grandmaster Kai Hong’s remnants. Thus, there were practically no people in this area.

“This is bad.”

However, right after arriving in this area, Zhao Hong’s expression changed.

“What’s wrong?” Chu Feng asked.

“I had left a concealment formation here. However, that formation has been broken through by someone,” Zhao Hong said.

“What?”

Hearing those words, the expressions on Chu Feng and Wang Qiang’s faces also changed. After all, this was no small matter.

However, they did not immediately withdraw from this place because of this. In fact, Chu Feng even activated his Heaven’s Eyes, and looked toward the direction indicated by Zhao Hong. He wanted to investigate what was happening.

At the same time Chu Feng activated his Heaven’s Eyes, Zhao Hong and Wang Qiang also using their respective observation method to inspect the region.

“That is?!!!”

Upon looking in that direction, the three of them all started to frown, and their hearts tightened.

They saw a spirit formation. It was a concealment formation. It was the doing of an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist. Furthermore, it was that of a Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist.

In the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, Immortal-cloak World Spiritists were extremely rare. Practically all of the Immortal-cloak World Spiritists were skillful experts.

Furthermore, the person who had set up that spirit formation was a Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, someone a level above Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong.

However, upon closer inspection, Chu Feng saw through what was inside the concealment formation. At this time, a smile appeared on Chu Feng’s face.

“This is truly what they mean by encountering enemies on a narrow road,” Chu Feng said with a smile.

The reason for that was because there were four figures inside the concealment formation. Chu Feng recognized those four people; they were the Four World Spiritist Emperors.

The Four World Spiritist Emperors were currently jointly operating a spirit formation. It was an unsealing formation. As for the spirit formation that they were trying to unseal, it was a very ancient and astonishing grand formation.

Without even Zhao Hong saying anything, Chu Feng was able to tell that the Four World Spiritist Emperors were trying to undo the spirit formation that Zhao Hong had spoken about, the spirit formation that could give them battle power.

Merely, to Chu Feng’s surprise, the Four World Spiritist Emperors were operating a very powerful spirit formation. It was a spirit formation set up by a Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist.

Evidently, that spirit formation was not set up by the four of them. The reason for that was because the four of them were still Royal-cloak World Spiritists. As such, it would be impossible for them to set up such a powerful spirit formation.

However, who would it be that had set up such a powerful spirit formation only to have the Four World Spiritist Emperors activate it?

Chu Feng felt that this spirit formation was most definitely set up by the Four World Spiritist Emperors’ mother.

Other than their mother, there should not be anyone else who would be able to set up such a spirit formation and then allow them to activate it.

One thing worthy of mentioning was that even though the Four World Spiritist Emperors were only Royal-cloak World Spiritists, they possessed treasures on them.

With the assistance of the treasures, it was not very exhausting for them to activate that spirit formation.

Furthermore, it seemed that they had been operating this spirit formation for a very long time. It seemed that the grand spirit formation capable of granting battle power was soon to be opened.

“T-those f-four fatties a-are s-simply h-helping us,” Wang Qiang had a vile smile on his face. It was as if he had picked up a treasure.

After all, the spirit formation the Four World Spiritist Emperors were operating was something set up by a Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist. That was a spirit formation that Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong were unable to set up even if they were to join hands. The might of that spirit formation was extremely powerful.

At this moment, after the efforts from the Four World Spiritist Emperors, that grand formation was soon to be unsealed.

Thus, as long as Chu Feng and the others were to snatch the authority from them and continue to operate the grand formation left behind by the Four World Spiritist Emperors’ mother, they would be able to undo that grand formation. It could truly be said that they would be enjoying the fruits of others.

“Chu Feng, it seems that you possess some sort of conflict with those Four World Spiritist Emperors,” Zhao Hong said.

“Indeed, I do,” Chu Feng said.

“Then, you owe me a favor,” Zhao Hong revealed a strange smile.

Chu Feng understood Zhao Hong’s intention. He knew that she was planning to teach them a lesson on his behalf.

“Leave them alive,” Chu Feng said.

“Why?” Zhao Hong was confused.

“B-brother, y-you m-must not be softhearted. To b-be m-merciful toward one’s e-enemy is t-to be cruel toward oneself,” Wang Qiang added.

“With Zhao Hong here, it is true that there is no need for us to be afraid of the four of them. However, I had actually never placed them in my eyes before.”

“If I must say who I am afraid of, it would be their mother. Judging from the way things are now, their mother is most definitely also in the Extremely Remote Unmarked Burial Mounds.”

“If we are to capture them alive, they might be useful. After all, judging from the two spirit formations, their mother should be a Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist.”

“It’s hard to find a Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist,” Chu Feng said.

“Got it. You are truly quite intelligent to think of something like this,” Zhao Hong looked to Chu Feng in astonishment. Contained in her gaze was a trace of admiration.

“He’s my brother, b-being smart i-is only natural,” Wang Qiang said in an admiring manner. It was as if he had done something very amazing.

They both realized Chu Feng’s intention. What Chu Feng meant was that if they were to directly kill the Four World Spiritist Emperors, the only thing that they would accomplish would be killing them. Other than removing threats to Chu Feng, there was no other benefit to killing them.

However, everyone knew that the Four World Spiritist Emperors’ mother was extremely doting on her four children. If they were to keep the four of them alive, they might be able to make use of their mother.

Although it was uncertain whether or not they would be able to encounter the Four World Spiritist Emperors’ mother, as long as they had a chance of encountering her, it would mean that Chu Feng and the others would have an additional hidden trump card.

“It seems that the Four World Spiritist Emperors’ mother is extremely confident. She only set up a concealment formation, and not a protection formation,” Zhao Hong said.

“I-Isn’t t-this b-better? If t-there was a protective f-formation, we m-might not necessarily b-be able to b-break it. However, since th-there isn’t, hehe, w-with only this c-concealment formation, it won’t be a-able to stop us,” Wang Qiang said with a beaming smile.

“Let’s start. Even though it is only a concealment formation, it will still take us some time to break through it,” Zhao Hong said.

“With the three of us joining hands, it shouldn’t take too long,” Chu Feng said.

Then, Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong, the three Insect Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritists began to join hands in setting up a spirit formation.

They first set up a concealment formation together and covered themselves with it. They did that to prevent others from noticing should they end up fighting against the Four World Spiritist Emperors.

After the concealment formation was completed, the three of them began to jointly remove the concealment spirit formation set up by the Four World Spiritist Emperors’ mother.

It was as Wang Qiang said; even though the spirit formation was set up by a Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, it remained only a concealment formation, and not a protection formation. Thus, with the three of them joining hands, it was not very difficult for them to break that concealment formation.

“Boom~~~”

Following that loud explosion, boundless spirit power began to surge in all directions. Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong had successfully broken through the concealment formation.

“Who is it?!”

The destruction of the concealment formation greatly alarmed the Four World Spiritist Emperors. After all, they felt that only extraordinary individuals would be able to break apart their mother’s spirit formation.

“It’s actually you?” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

However, when the four of them cast their gazes over and discovered that it was actually Chu Feng, their lips immediately lifted into a strange curve.
