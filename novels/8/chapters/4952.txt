Chapter 4952: The Zhuge Clan’s Reverse Scale

“I see. Your world spiritist bloodline is truly something else. However, you shouldn’t forget that this is my treasure. Do you think that you can stand against me just by hiding inside my own treasure? I’ll give you one last chance. Submit to me or die inside!” the blue-cloaked woman said.&nbsp;

“Submit to you? That’s impossible. Try your best to kill me instead,” Chu Feng replied fearlessly.

“Heh. You’re asking for it.”

The blue-cloaked woman’s face turned severe.

Pah!

She put her palms together and started forming several hand seals. Following that, the palace began to contract. She was intending to crush Chu Feng to death within the palace.

Chu Feng wasn’t about to go down without a fight. He quickly invoked his bloodline power to resist the contraction of the palace. His retaliation successfully slowed the rate of the palace’s contraction.

However, the problem was that the palace was still contracting, albeit at a slower rate.

“Things don’t look good. Elder Divine Deer, I need your help now. You have left me to the lurch so many times. Shouldn’t you lend a helping hand to me at least this once?”

Chu Feng turned to the Divine Deer inside of him for help.

In truth, he didn’t bear much hope for the Divine Deer, but he was just trying his luck since he was already in a desperate situation.

“Brat, your world spiritist bloodline is extraordinary.”

To Chu Feng’s delight, the Divine Deer actually responded to his call.

“Elder, you’re finally willing to respond to me. I’m still holding on for the time being, but I fear that the woman has other means. I ask you to take me away from here,” Chu Feng said.

“If you can’t even resolve a crisis like this on your own, you would be unworthy of the world spiritist bloodline you possess. Struggle as hard as you can,” the Divine Deer sneered.

“Elder, I know that you’re testing me to see if I’m qualified of you, but surely I need to survive to be able to prove myself?” Chu Feng argued.

However, the Divine Deer was no longer responding to him anymore.

“Milord, this is a duel. Even if young friend Chu Feng was disrespectful in his words, he doesn’t deserve death. I ask of you to spare his life,” the Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief suddenly spoke up.

Even Chu Feng was surprised to hear that.

The Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief shamelessly resorted to underhanded methods to prevent Chu Feng from entering the legacy formation earlier, and yet, he was pleading for Chu Feng’s mercy now? Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Had it been in the past, the blue-cloaked woman would have simply disregarded the Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief. However, there was a slight difference this time around.

The blue-cloaked woman actually stopped contracting the palace and instead turned her gaze toward the Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief.

“You’re finally pleading on his behalf. I already know that Chu Feng is a member of your Zhuge Clan. Unless he’s an utter idiot, he wouldn’t have stood up for mere strangers, especially not under such circumstances.”

It looked like the blue-cloaked woman had been waiting for this.

“Milord, will you spare him this once on my account?” the Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“Since you’ve already spoken, I’m willing to do you this favor. However, I have a condition. Hand over everything Situ Qi left behind. I know that he didn’t just leave you with the legacy formation,” the blue-cloaked woman said.&nbsp;

“Very well. Let young friend Chu Feng go, and I’ll give you everything we have received from Situ Qi,” the Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief said.&nbsp;

“Not bad. You still have a brain. I guess I can consider sparing your Zhuge Clan.”&nbsp;

The blue-cloaked woman nodded in satisfaction.&nbsp;

However, those from the Zhuge Clan weren’t too pleased to hear those words. It meant that the blue-cloaked woman was planning to massacre them right from the start.

“However, Situ Qi has left his items with you for so many years. I don’t think it’d be fair for you to just return what he has given you. At the very least, our Situ World Spiritist Clan should receive some interest on it,” the blue-cloaked woman said.

“Milord, what do you want?” the Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief asked.

“I heard that your Zhuge Clan once had a prodigy named Zhuge Guangyao. He has a treasure that allowed him to grow swiftly. If I’m not mistaken, the defensive formation around your Zhuge Clan was constructed by him, right?

“It’s just that Zhuge Guangyao wasn’t able to fully control the treasure, resulting in him suffering a backlash from the treasure and die in his prime. What a pity it is for the treasure to meet someone unworthy of it.&nbsp;

“The treasure will be going to waste in your Zhuge Clan anyway, so why don’t you hand it over to our Situ World Spiritist Clan as compensation instead?” the blue-cloaked woman said.&nbsp;

Hostility immediately appeared on the faces of those from the Zhuge Clan. This was the first time they were showing their enmity toward the Situ World Spiritist Clan.

It looked like someone had touched their reverse scale.

“Who is Zhuge Guangyao?”

Sensing the change in the atmosphere, Chu Feng sent a voice transmission to Princess Xiaoxiao to ask about it.

“Zhuge Guangyao is the most formidable person who has appeared in the Zhuge Clan. He was the one who brought the Zhuge Clan to its current heights. Even the widely feared defensive formation was constructed by him. It’s just that Zhuge Guangyao got ill and died a premature death.&nbsp;

“There are rumors that Zhuge Guangyao had a treasure that helped him to grow swiftly, but it’s also the culprit that took away his life,” Princess Xiaoxiao answered through voice transmission.

The face of the Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief turned cold.

“Milord, Lord Zhuge Guangyao is indeed our ancestor, but the so-called treasure is nothing more than a rumor. It doesn’t exist,” the Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief replied.

“I heard that he brought the treasure with him to his grave. Why don’t you try digging up his grave? We’ll know whether it exists or not once we do so. If you think that it’s disrespectful for your ancestors to do that, we can help you,” the blue-cloaked woman said.

How could the Zhuge Clan allow others to dig up the grave of one of their heroic ancestors?

“I fear that I can’t allow any disrespect to the ancestors of our Zhuge Clan.”

The attitude of the Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief became more firm. There was a hint of anger in his words.

“Oh? It looks like you’re rejecting my demands?”&nbsp;

The blue-cloaked woman gazed down on the Zhuge Clan imposingly.

“Like I’ve said, Lord Situ Qi’s items belong to your Situ World Spiritist Clan. I have no qualms if you wish to take it away with you. However, Lord Zhuge Guangyao is a hero of our Zhuge Clan. I’ve already made it clear that he has left nothing behind, and we won’t permit any disrespect toward him,” the Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief said.&nbsp;
