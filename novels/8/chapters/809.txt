MGA: Chapter 810 - End of Hardships, Beginning of Fortune

After dealing with all of them, Chu Feng looked at Zi Xuanyuan and said with some shame, “Senior Xuanyuan, I apologize. I, Chu Feng, have come late.”

“Haha, Chu Feng, I didn’t think you would have come to the Eastern Sea Region so soon, and your growth in cultivation is even so quick! Zi Ling has indeed not been mistaken. Your potential really is huge. You will surpass that Murong Xun sooner or later. Not only have you surpassed everyone in the continent of the Nine Provinces, you will surpass everyone in the Eastern Sea Region soon.”

Zi Xuanyuan already liked Chu Feng quite a bit, and seeing his accomplishments in cultivation, he was even more elated and excited. From the bottom of his heart, he felt joy for Chu Feng.

“Senior Xuanyuan, I’ve heard that Zi Ling was imprisoned. Is that true?” Chu Feng asked.

“Mm, that is true. Zi Ling is not the only one imprisoned. Right now, even her parents are imprisoned,” said Zi Xuanyuan, nodding. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“What’s going on? What exactly happened?” Chu Feng asked.

“It’s not much. After I returned, I learnt that the patriarch of the Zi family already knew of the Immortal Execution Archipelago’s scheme. He already knew that the Immortal Execution Archipelago didn’t really want Murong Xun to marry Zi Ling, that they wanted Zi Ling’s Divine power.

“However, for his own advantages and benefits, he chose to conceal the truth. Even Zi Ling’s parents were tricked by him.

“So, I pretended to agree and support the marriage between Zi Ling and Murong Xun. After earning his trust, I laid a trap and made him announce what happened. As a result, many of the people from the Zi family learnt of the truth, including Zi Ling’s parents.

“After knowing about that, Zi Ling’s parents also felt endless regret. After all, they do love Zi Ling. So, they wanted to bring Zi Ling away, but they failed.” Zi Xuanyuan’s face was full of pity.

“Then, senior, do you know where Zi Ling is imprisoned right now?” Chu Feng was not concerned with Zi Ling’s parents; he was only concerned with Zi Ling.

“I know. She’s being locked in the residence of the patriarch,” Zi Xuanyuan replied.

“What cultivation does the patriarch have?” Chu Feng asked.

“The Immortal Execution Archipelago has given the Zi family many things, and the patriarch has used the resources without restraint. As such, he’s the one who benefited the most. Right now, his cultivation in the Zi family is also the strongest—he’s a rank six Martial Lord,” Zi Xuanyuan said.

“Rank six Martial Lord? Then does the Zi family have the protection of experts from the Immortal Execution Archipelago?” Chu Feng asked.

“There are. The Immortal Execution Archipelago has always had experts within the Zi family, but they are very covert. We have never seen them before, nor do we know what cultivation they have.

“However, something that I’m certain is that the experts from the Immortal Execution Archipelago have strength above the patriarch, because the Immortal Execution Archipelago doesn’t trust him at all,” Zi Xuanyuan said.

After obtaining that information, Chu Feng sank into thought. A rank six Martial Lord was really not enough to make him afraid—with his current cultivation, if he brought forth everything, Chu Feng could put up a fight even against a rank six Martial Lord. So, he was not afraid of the patriarch.

However, Chu Feng had no choice but to be cautious against the hidden experts of the Immortal Execution Archipelago. Yet, since he had come here, Chu Feng could not leave empty-handedly. No matter what, he had to give it a try.

*whoosh* Suddenly, Chu Feng grabbed the unconscious grandson of the patriarch who was lying within a pool of blood. Chu Feng threw him over his shoulder, and then he said to Zi Xuanyuan, “Senior Xuanyuan, please lead the way.”

“This...” Zi Xuanyuan was no fool so he could tell what Chu Feng was planning. Initially, he wanted to urge him otherwise, but recalling his stubborn nature, he decided to remain silent and led the road.

Although, on the surface, there was not a single person from the Zi family who could stop Chu Feng, since he was slightly afraid of the hidden experts from the Immortal Execution Archipelago, he didn’t prepare to make too big of a scene.

When he left the prison, Chu Feng intentionally concealed that place, then, without anyone knowing, snuck into the patriarch’s residence.

Although there were many mechanisms inside, they were all deactivated by Chu Feng.

“This child’s Spirit Formation techniques are this skillful? How powerful has he become?”

On the road, personally witnessing Chu Feng’s techniques, Zi Xuanyuan saw Chu Feng in another new light. He was less and less able to see how powerful Chu Feng currently was.

However, what he was certain was the child, who liked stirring up trouble everywhere in the continent of the Nine Provinces, one that he could kill with merely a thought before, had now far surpassed him.

Finally, with Zi Xuanyuan leading the way, Chu Feng successfully arrived at the place where Zi Ling and her parents were locked up at. It was an underground palace constructed deep below the surface, and there were also countless defensive Spirit Formations laid there. A typical Martial Lord should not even think of coming to that place.

However, that was not difficult for Chu Feng. After Chu Feng opened the gate reinforced with Spirit Formations, a beautiful person who he hadn’t seen in a long time once again appeared before Chu Feng.

Zi Ling—the little beauty Chu Feng thought of every single day and night. At that moment, her grace was still unchanged, and her sweet face, her elegant figure, as well as her innately unique aura overshadowed every single other woman in the world, and she was a person who many men went mad for.

Zi Ling was currently chatting with her parents, and she would have never expected Chu Feng to appear here. She thought it was the patriarch who came to visit her again, so she simply didn’t even look at Chu Feng.

“Zi Ling.” Only after Chu Feng spoke her name, his words a manifestation of all his internal feelings, did Zi Ling’s perfect body tremble once before she quickly turning her head over, casting her gaze at Chu Feng.

When she saw Chu Feng, her eyes were widened roundly, and her quivering brows and widened mouth were all signs of the shock she felt.

She only came to her senses after a good while. She leapt forward, straight up to Chu Feng, and pounced into his embrace. She tightly hugged Chu Feng, unwilling to let go. She only said, with her sobbing voice, “Is it you? Is it you? Is it truly you? This isn’t a dream, right? I’m not dreaming, right?”

At that moment, Chu Feng’s heart was aching and warmed. He too opened up his arms and tightly hugged the beauty in his embrace, firmly saying, “Zi Ling, it’s me. I’ve come to find you. I’m sorry, I’ve let you wait for far too long. I’ve let you suffer far too much.”

“No, it was not long, nor have I suffered.” Zi Ling raised her head, and after looking at Chu Feng with her eyes glittering with tears, she buried her head back into Chu Feng’s chest, and hugged Chu Feng even tighter, as if afraid he would disappear if she were to let go.

No matter how arrogant Zi Ling was, no matter how she treated others, no matter how cold, at that very instant, in Chu Feng’s embrace, she was only like an obedient little girl—Chu Feng was her everything.

“Lord Father, this...” At that instant, Zi Ling’s parents were dumbfounded. They didn’t know what to do about Chu Feng’s sudden arrival.

“Shh.” However, Zi Xuanyuan indicated to them to remain silent. Then, he sent a mental message at them, “Let them enjoy this moment. These two have suffered for far too long.”
