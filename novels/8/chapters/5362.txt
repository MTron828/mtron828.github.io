Chapter 5362: Heaven’s Tome

Jie Yu opened the box despite the old woman’s dissuasion.

The content of the box left the juniors of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion with mixed feelings. Even Chu Feng and Bai Yunqing revealed astonished looks too.

Inside the box was a Life Crystal. It was sealed by a formation, but there was no question that it was a Life Crystal.

“You’re going to stake this on the bet?” Chu Feng asked in disbelief.

“That’s right. You mentioned that you need Life Crystals. Don’t worry, I won’t ask anything from you in return. For this bet, we’ll compete with our true capabilities in front of everyone else. Do you dare to accept the bet?” Jie Yu asked.

“How do you want to go about it?” Chu Feng asked.

“Since you’re a world spiritist too, let’s compete on our ability to construct formations. The two of us will spend an hour constructing a formation, then we’ll pit our formations against each other. The first one to destroy the enemy’s formation is the victor. Don’t worry, I won’t take advantage of you.”

Jie Yu released his spirit power before slowly suppressing it, reducing it from Blue Dragon God-cloak to White Dragon God-cloak.

“Are you sure that you want to suppress your spirit power in this bet?” Chu Feng didn’t think that Jie Yu would suppress his own spirit power for this battle on his own accord.

“I, Jie Yu, am not a sore loser, but I can’t accept how you simply took out that crystal and claimed that you did it yourself. It’s the same for the others too, which is why they accused you of cheating. Since you were able to achieve such an outstanding result in the trial, it should mean that you’re a proficient world spiritist too. I’ll give you a chance to prove yourself right now.

“If you defeat me, you can take the Life Crystal away with you. I’ll also fulfill our earlier bet and respectfully address you as ‘grandpa’ every time I meet you,” Jie Yu said.

“That’s not fair for you, young master Jie Yu. You don’t need to do this for someone as insignificant as him!”

The juniors of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion panicked, for they understood how important the Life Crystals were. They didn’t think that Jie Yu should use it for the bet, not to mention that he wasn’t demanding Chu Feng to bring out anything proportionate in value either.

On the other hand, those words raised Chu Feng and Bai Yunqing’s impression of Jie Yu. It was not to say that they had a favorable impression of Jie Yu now; the latter did underestimate them and provoke Bai Yunqing earlier, after all.

Nevertheless, it was impressive how he was willing to put something valuable on the line and not use it as an opportunity to extort something out of Chu Feng. It made him seem like a man who was willing to take responsibility for his words.

“It’s true that I need Life Crystals. If I win, all you have to do is to give the Life Crystal to me. There’s no need for you to call me grandpa,” Chu Feng replied.

It was clear that Jie Yu was someone who valued his reputation. Calling Chu Feng grandpa was probably much more painful to him than losing a Life Crystal. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have put a Life Crystal on the line to demand a second bet.

“Are you pitying me? I don’t need that!” Jie Yu scoffed.

“I’m not pitying you. I just think that it’s a much fairer trade that way,” Chu Feng replied.

“There’s no need for that. It’s a fair trade as it is. If you lose this duel, it’ll show that you don’t have the capability to nourish such a crystal and have been lying all along. It’ll prove that you are someone without honor and dignity, and that’s sufficient for me,” Jie Yu replied.

“That’s true too,” Chu Feng remarked with a chuckle.

“Does that mean that you’re accepting the bet?” Jie Yu asked.

“Of course. Since you don’t believe me, I’ll just have to prove myself to you,” Chu Feng replied.

“Let’s begin then.”

As soon as he finished those words, Jie Yu began constructing his formation. Chu Feng also swiftly delved into it, not daring to take his opponent lightly.

It didn’t take long for the outlines of Jie Yu’s formation to take shape. In comparison, Chu Feng was in the midst of building the foundation. Upon seeing that, the worried juniors of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion breathed a sigh of relief.

It took skill to swiftly construct the foundation of a formation. On that aspect, Jie Yu appeared to be the superior world spiritist of the two.

Most important of all, the juniors were already able to tell what kind of formation Jie Yu was constructing. They knew that as long as he successfully constructed the formation, there was no way he would lose this bet.

“Chu Feng, there seems to be something peculiar about Jie Yu’s formation,” Eggy said.

“It’s a pretty formidable formation. It looks like I really shouldn’t underestimate the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.” Chu Feng had to acknowledge Jie Yu’s skills as a world spiritist.

Jie Yu’s formation had the traits of a reinforcement formation ingeniously weaved into it, thus amplifying the prowess of the formation. It was impressive indeed.

“Big brother Chu Feng, why aren’t you giving it your all?” Bai Yunqing asked worriedly via voice transmission.

He knew that Chu Feng was capable of constructing formations that surpassed even Blue Dragon God-cloak World Spiritists, but for some reason, the latter wasn’t giving all that he had here. Instead, he had suppressed his spirit power to White Dragon God-cloak as well.

“I want to win the Life Crystal, but I want to make him accept his defeat too,” Chu Feng said.

He was suppressing his spirit power to White Dragon God-cloak because Jie Yu had done the same too. Of course, it wouldn’t have been cheating even if he used his usual means, since that was also proof of his capability too. However, he thought that Jie Yu would be more willing to accept the outcome if he kept his spirit power at White Dragon God-cloak.

“Big brother Chu Feng, you mustn’t underestimate Jie Yu! He isn’t just constructing any normal formation but one from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Heaven Tome! Heaven Tome is a secret manual containing many powerful formations, each of them ingeniously designed so that it looks as if they possess a life of their own.

“These formations can draw out the greatest potential within a world spiritist. If Jie Yu completes that formation, his formation will harness strength far surpassing his own. It’ll be pushing the very limits of what a White Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist is capable of. This was also how I lost to Jie Yu in our previous bet…

“In fact, he intentionally set the time limit to an hour because that is how long it takes for him to complete that formation. Furthermore, it also looks like he has gained a greater mastery of that formation since our last duel. Big brother, he only made this bet because he is confident of defeating you. You mustn’t get careless!” Bai Yunqing reminded.

“There is such a formation in the world?” Chu Feng was surprised.

If what Bai Yunqing mentioned was true, it would mean that the formation that Jie Yu was constructing was much stronger than he had expected.

“The Heaven Tome is the secret behind the Seven Realm Sacred Mansion’s strength,” Bai Yunqing emphasized.

“It won’t be a problem,” Chu Feng replied.

Having already warned Chu Feng on the matter, Bai Yunqing decided not to say anything else lest he distracted Chu Feng from this matter. It didn’t take long for an hour to be up.

Jie Yu finished his formation in the nick of time and stopped channeling his spirit power. Chu Feng did the same too.

Mocking laughter could be heard from the crowd.

“What the hell did you construct? Have you already given up on the bet?”

“I really wonder where you find the guts to claim that you nurtured a crystal of that level with your own strength when this is all you’re capable of?”Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“What a joke! Is this how you prove yourself?”

“He did prove himself to be a trash here. We should give him credit for that. Hahaha!”

The juniors of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion laughed in contempt.

It was only natural for them to react in such a manner, for Chu Feng’s formation hadn’t fully taken shape yet. Its outlines remained blurry, looking more like a huge blob than anything else. It would be a stretch to even call it a half-completed formation.

But in contrast to the juniors’ mocking, the old woman had a severe look on her face. Her complexion turned pale as she alternated her gaze between Chu Feng and his formation.

“Chu Feng, are you admitting defeat by constructing such a formation?” Jie Yu sneered.

He had thought all along that Chu Feng was just putting on a brave front, but he didn’t think that the latter would be this inept. Just then, he received a voice transmission from the old woman.

“Young master Jie Yu, don’t proceed with the bet. There’s more to his formation than what you see,” the old woman said.

Jie Yu’s arrogance dissipated right away. He knew that the old woman must have noticed something that he had overlooked to offer such advice… but he was confident in his formation too. After all, this was a formation from the Heaven Tome!

He had reached a high level of mastery in this formation, allowing him to draw out a White Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist’s power to its very limit… but the old woman knew about this too. She must have her reason for issuing such advice.

Confused, Jie Yu turned to Chu Feng and asked, “What are you up to?”

“Someone must have warned you.”

Chu Feng glanced at the old woman, knowing that his little tricks wouldn’t be able to fool a true expert. Jie Yu must have heard something, or else his confidence wouldn’t suddenly dissipate into hesitance.
