Chapter 3131 - Monstrous Clan Reinforcements

Although the people from the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan were begging for forgiveness, Chu Feng did not have any intention of sparing them.

What Chu Feng needed to do was very simple. He had to satisfy Chu Ping, Chu Qing, Chu Haoyan and Chu Huanyu.

Otherwise, Chu Feng would not spare those Cyanfeather Monstrous Clansmen.

“This sensation?”

Suddenly, Chu Feng’s expression changed. He felt a powerful aura rapidly flying in their direction.

Furthermore, that aura felt similar to that of the other Cyanfeather Monstrous Clansmen before him. The incoming individual was a Cyanfeather Monstrous Beast.

“Little brother Chu Feng, what’s wrong?” Seeing the frown on Chu Feng’s face, Chu Ping noticed that something was amiss.

“Big brother Chu Ping, the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan’s reinforcements are coming. The four of you must quickly leave this place and return in the direction from which we came,” Chu Feng said.

“What? What are we to do about this situation?” Chu Ping asked.

“I will stop them. You all quickly get away from here,” Chu Feng said.

“Okay, you must be careful.”

“Little brothers, follow me.”

Chu Ping did not hesitate. He turned around and immediately escaped with Chu Qing, Chu Haoyan and Chu Huanyu.

The reason for that was because they knew very well that they would not be able to help Chu Feng by staying there. Instead, they would become Chu Feng’s burden.

Sure enough, not long after Chu Ping and the others left, several dozen figures rapidly flew over.

They were all people from the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan. They all had Heavenly Immortal levels of cultivation. The weakest among them was a rank four Heavenly Immortal, whereas the strongest was a rank eight Heavenly Immortal.

When the people from the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan arrived and saw their clansmen that were kneeling on the ground, they all began to frown with complicated emotions in their eyes.

“What the hell are you all doing kneeling on the ground?!” Suddenly, a furious shout was heard. It was that rank eight Heavenly Immortal.

“It’s Lord Qingyu Fengming! This is great! We’re saved now, we’re saved!” [1. Qingyu means cyan feather.]

“Lord Qingyu Fengming, save us, quickly, save us!”

Upon seeing that reinforcements had arrived, the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clansmen that were kneeling on the ground immediately reacted as if they had seen their savior, and all began to frantically call for help.

There were even those among them that began to react in an extremely exaggerated manner with snot and tears as they wept for help.

It was as if they had suffered enormous abuse by Chu Feng’s hands. That said, Chu Feng did indeed use quite cruel and ruthless methods on them. It would not be excessive to call what Chu Feng did to them abuse.

At that moment, that rank eight Heavenly Immortal and the others behind him all realized that all of this must be related to that man down below.

However, as they were unable to sense Chu Feng’s strength, they did not act blindly without thinking. Instead, they began to examine Chu Feng.

When they discovered the Chu Heavenly Clan’s title plate on Chu Feng’s waist, their expressions changed.

Shock filled their eyes.

Evidently, they had not expected their clansmen to be oppressed by a mere Chu Heavenly Clansman.

After all, they felt that the Chu Heavenly Clan in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm was a clan of extremely weak trash.

As for their clansmen kneeling on the ground, the strongest among them was a rank five Heavenly Immortal.

Wouldn’t this mean that that Chu Heavenly Clansman standing below possessed the cultivation of at least a rank six Heavenly Immortal?

Although that sort of cultivation was not something that they, the Cyanfeather Monstrous Beasts, would fear, it was something unimaginable for the current Chu Heavenly Clan.

“You are from the Chu Heavenly Clan?” That rank eight Heavenly Immortal asked.

“Why bother asking something that you already know?” Chu Feng replied with a smile.

“What arrogance! Do you not wish to continue to train peacefully in this Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm?!” That rank eight Heavenly Immortal shouted angrily upon hearing Chu Feng’s arrogance in admitting to who he was.

He did not bother to ask why Chu Feng decided to attack his clansmen and make them kneel. Instead, he had made the judgement of death for Chu Feng from the very start. His behavior was extremely arrogant.

“I feel that you should be asking me why I did what I did to your clansmen,” Chu Feng replied with a smile.

“I do not need to know the reason why. After all, what you have done is a capital offense,” Once that rank eight Heavenly Immortal said those words, killing intent immediately surged in his eyes. With a thought, boundless martial power surged forth to oppress Chu Feng.

Chu Feng had expected all of this. At the same time as he unleashed his killing intent, before he could even send forth his oppressive might, Chu Feng unleashed his Divine level Lightning Mark and the Ancient Era’s War Axe and Ancient Era’s War Sword.

The two secret skills fused with Chu Feng, turning into a small axe and sword that slowly revolved around him.

At that moment, the power of his Divine level Lightning Mark increased Chu Feng’s cultivation by an entire level. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The two secret skills also helped Chu Feng gain a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting a level of cultivation.

Chu Feng’s battle power was no longer weaker than that Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan’s rank eight Heavenly Immortal.

Chu Feng waved his sleeve, and easily dispersed that rank eight Heavenly Immortal’s oppressive might.

“This guy!!!”

Astonishment!. Not only were the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clansmen kneeling before Chu Feng astonished, but even the reinforcements that had arrived later were completely astonished. In fact, even that rank eight Heavenly Immortal was shocked.

They all knew that the possessors of Heavenly Lightning Bloodlines would be able to form Heaven level Lightning Marks and increase their cultivation by a level after training in the Heaven Punishment Mysterious Technique.

However, they had not expected the character that appeared on Chu Feng’s forehead to be the character ‘Divine.’

The reason for this was because this meant that Chu Feng did not train in the Heaven Punishment Mysterious Technique. Instead, he had trained in the legendary Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique.
