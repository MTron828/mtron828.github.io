MGA: Chapter 1052 - The True Identity of the Martial Emperor

“In that case, this senior had truly done a good deed for the Holy Land of Martialism.”

“In that case, senior sister Wang Wei, might this Greatest Martial Emperor still be alive?” Chu Feng suddenly asked.

In the Eastern Sea Region, Immortal Lady Piaomiao was able to use the energy within the Misty Immortal Peak to live close to a thousand years. The strength of Martial Emperors were countless times more powerful than Martial Kings; with their remarkable powers and the methods of the Holy Land of Martialism, it might not be impossible for them to live for ten thousand years. Moreover, that Martial Emperor was such an extraordinary existence.

However, who would’ve thought that faced with Chu Feng’s question, Wang Wei shook her head and said, “Although Martial Emperors are powerful, their life expectancy is still limited. It is said that ten thousand years is the maximum time a Martial Emperor could live for. That end of their life expectancy is something very few Martial Emperor could break through.”

“Who would’ve thought that the limit set up by the Heavens would be this hard to surpass. If it was impossible for even that senior, it would likely be even more difficult for other Martial Emperors.”

Chu Feng sighed. That Greatest Martial Emperor had done such an amazing feat. If possible, Chu Feng truly wanted to meet that Martial Emperor. However, it would appear now that he would not have such an opportunity.

“Although ten thousand years is the limit that a Martial Emperor could live up to and very rarely have there ever been people capable of surpassing that limit, that Greatest Martial Emperor did not die because of old age.”

“It could be said that he had sacrificed his life for our Holy Land of Martialism. That was the reason he was named the Greatest Martial Emperor in the history, with neither precedent nor subsequent.” Explained Wang Wei.

“Sacrificed his life for the Holy Land of Martialism? Senior sister Wang Wei, what do you mean by that?” Asked Chu Feng curiously.

“Ten thousand years ago, a frightening demon appeared in the Holy Land of Martialism. That demon was incomparably ruthless and possessed overflowing strength. It self-proclaimed to be the Magma Emperor and had come from the subterranean abyss, a world all black with no daylight, the Magma World.

“It had broken through its bindings and wanted to enslave all living things. Thus, he ended up bringing about a devastating catastrophe to the Holy Land of Martialism.”

“At that time, not only were the human powers attacked by it, the monstrous beasts and even the Ancient Era’s Elves were attacked by it. The most important thing was that there was actually no one capable of contending against it, no one was capable of fighting it.”

“Of the powerful Martial Emperors from that era, at least eighty percent of them were killed by that Magma Emperor. All races and powers ended up receiving an unprecedented blow.”

“However, right at the moment when all the living things in the Holy Land of Martialism had fallen into despair and given up all hope, right at the time when they felt that the Holy Land of Martialism might perish, that Greatest Martial Emperor appeared once again.”

“The battle between the Greatest Martial Emperor and the Magma Emperor shook the entire Holy Land of Martialism. However, due to the two of them being too powerful, no one dared to approach them and watch the battle.” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“After the world that was shaken violently gradually settled down, no one was able to find any trace of the Greatest Martial Emperor anymore. At the same time, that Magma Emperor also disappeared, never to appear again.”

“And now, ten thousand years has passed. Countless experts have been born and died of old age. Yet, neither of them have appeared again. Thus, everyone believed that the two of them have most definitely perished together in that battle back then.”

“However, all the people of the Holy Land of Martialism would never forget that it was him who had saved us, it was him who saved the Holy Land of Martialism. Not only the humans, but all other races too are extremely grateful towards what he had done for them.”

“Thus, even though he had disappeared for so long, the Ancient Era’s Elves did not go back on the agreement they made with him. Never did they think about taking back the Ancient Era’s Immortal Ponds. They even opened up the Ancient Era’s Immortal Ponds that they controlled for everyone once every year. Although the price to enter the Ancient Era’s Immortal Ponds are not insignificant, they have still opened them up once every year.”

“The conducts of the Ancient Era’s Elves caused some people to say that because they were the most powerful power ten thousand years ago, it led the Magma Emperor to strike at them the deepest, causing them to have the most disastrous losses. Even though ten thousand years have passed, they have still not recovered from their losses. It was simply impossible for them to contend against the human powers and that was the reason why they did not dare to take back the Ancient Era’s Immortal Ponds.”

“However, there are also people who think that the ones that suffered immense losses was definitely not limited to the Ancient Era’s Elves. Practically all of the Martial Emperors from back then were exterminated by the Magma Emperor. It is not that the Ancient Era’s Elves feared the humans. Instead, it was because they revered the Greatest Martial Emperor. That’s the reason why they abide by their agreement with him.”

“However, regardless of exactly what the Ancient Era’s Elves were thinking, regardless of whether there is something fishy within this or not, the contributions left by that senior is unquestionable. He is indeed the Greatest Martial Emperor to ever existed in our Holy Land of Martialism and would forever be the greatest.” Saying till this point, the expression of reverence on Wang Wei’s face was even more distinct. However, there was also a bit of sadness mixed within it.

However, upon hearing till this point, Chu Feng felt that the story of the Greatest Martial Emperor gave off a deja vu feeling. Thus, he asked, “Senior Wang Wei, what might the name of that Greatest Martial Emperor be?”

“Junior brother Chu Feng, in order to honor him, the people of the Holy Land of Martialism all addressed him as the Greatest Martial Emperor. Very rarely would people address him by his name. If someone dared to bluntly mention his tabooed name, they would be viewed as being disrespectful towards him. Thus, while I can tell you what his name is, you must definitely not directly mention his name to other people in conversations.”

Wang Wei seriously warned Chu Feng. Then, she moved her enchanting mouth beside Chu Feng’s ears and softly said, “That senior Greatest Martial Emperor’s name is Qing Xuantian.”

“Senior Qing Xuantian, as expected, it is him.” After hearing what Wang Wei said, although Chu Feng had already guessed that might be the case, he was still shocked. He knew that Qing Xuantian was very powerful but he never expected him to have such a reputation in the Holy Land of Martialism. He was actually known as the the Greatest Martial Emperor to have ever existed in the Holy Land of Martialism.

However, upon thinking about the legends of him in the Eastern Sea Region as well as the things that the Vermillion Bird Resurrection Technique told him about, Chu Feng knew that Qing Xuantian was likely not dead.

There was a legend in the Eastern Sea Region. It said that a fully grown Son of Magma suddenly appeared in the Eastern Sea Region ten thousand years ago. That Son of Magma was extremely frightening and wanted to destroy the Eastern Sea Region. Later on, it was defeated by a powerful Martial Emperor.

Chu Feng felt that the Eastern Sea Region’s legend was true and the achievements of Qing Xuantian in the Holy Land of Martialism was also true. If his guess was correct, what had truly happened would be like this.

The Magma Emperor might be that fully grown Son of Magma. It most definitely had changed its name. It ought to be an extremely powerful being. Otherwise, it was impossible for even the people from the Holy Land of Martialism to have no way to deal with it.

It ought to be that the Magma Emperor had first appeared in the Holy Land of Martialism. Later on, it ended up having an enormous battle with Qing Xuantian. For some unknown reason, their battle ended up moving to the Eastern Sea Region.

For the people of the Holy Land of Martialism, they thought that the two of them had perished together in battle. However, they actually had not. That was because the two of them most definitely had fought again in the Eastern Sea Region. Otherwise, it would be impossible for there to be such a legend in the Eastern Sea Region.

As for the result of their battle, it was that Qing Xuantian used the powers of the four Divine Beasts to defeat and seal the Magma Emperor. This was also the reason why the bodies and consciousness of the four Divine Beasts were separated, causing them to later be turned into Secret Skills.

As for whether that Qing Xuantian was dead or not, based on what the Vermillion Bird Resurrection Technique had mentioned before, he most likely did not die. At the very least, at the time after they sealed off the Magma Emperor with their bodies, Qing Xuantian was still alive.

According to what the Vermillion Bird Resurrection Technique, Qing Xuantian was a very powerful individual. Currently, he ought to still be living. The exact words of the Vermillion Bird were ‘A man like him, there are not many things that could kill him. The only thing that could threaten him would be himself.’
