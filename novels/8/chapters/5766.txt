Chapter 5766: Wang Qiang’s Resolution

“B-b-brother, I-I-I can hear you,” Wang Qiang replied telepathically.

Chu Feng heaved a sigh of relief. The reason they could communicate telepathically despite being a long distance away was due to the pendant serving as a medium. This was the item he had constructed using a formation after learning that the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted was still alive.

This item enhanced the secrecy of their communication, so as to ensure that the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted lingering inside Wang Qiang’s body wouldn’t hear their conversation.

Of course, it was not almighty. It worked because both of them were in the Nine Heavens’ Zenith, but it might not be as effective once they were further away from each other.

“It’s good that you can hear me. To summarize…”

Chu Feng informed Wang Qiang about how the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted had intentionally planted the Descent of the Demon Exalted inside his body, and that the latter sensed the aura of the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted inside Wang Qiang’s body.

“B-b-brother, I’m aware of it.” Wang Qiang’s reply caught Chu Feng by surprise.

It turned out that Wang Qiang had known all along that he hadn’t fully gotten rid of the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted. He suspected that the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted had intentionally lost in their showdown to make him think that he had won so that he could lurk inside his body without any worry.

Wang Qiang didn’t know what the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted was up to, but that old thing definitely didn’t bear any good intentions. Thus, he feigned ignorance about the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted’s existence and spent a huge amount of time cultivating every day to stabilize his soul, lest the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted took control of his body one day.

However, he couldn’t make it too obvious, so he fabricated some excuses so as to not pique the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted’s suspicion.

“Rest assured, b-b-brother. That o-o-old thing won’t take over my body t-t-that easily!” Wang Qiang said.

“Brother, are you able to sense how strong the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted is?” Chu Feng asked. It was of utmost importance for them to know how powerful their enemy was.

“I can’t sense it, b-b-but I can tell he’s very strong. He’s not an opponent we c-c-can get rid of yet,” Wang Qiang replied.

The two of them continued chatting, as Chu Feng looked for ways to help Wang Qiang. However, they were forced to conclude that there was nothing they could do with their current strength to resolve the situation, and Wang Qiang’s solution was the best they could do.

“Brother, I’ll find a way out,” Chu Feng said.

“Aiya, i-i-it’s fine. What kind of storm have we never weathered? I-i-it’s just a mere Blood-devouring Demon Exalted. He’s just a s-s-stepping stone in my path!” Wang Qiang said with a confident smile.

“I believe you can make it. While we’re in the Nine Heavens’ Zenith, you can contact me via this pendant. Feel free to ask me for help,” Chu Feng said. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“You don’t need to worry about me. Focus on the Nine Heavens’ Zenith and claim the title of the strongest. Make sure to give the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion a tight slap!” Wang Qiang said.

“I will,” Chu Feng replied.

He didn’t dwell too much on the matter since he knew there was nothing he could do. His attention was better placed on matters within his means to handle. There were far too many things for him to do. He would never achieve anything if he couldn’t set his priorities right.

Chu Feng proceeded to take out the Immemorial Divine Water, curious to know how potent the medicine only the top-notch prodigies of powerhouses were entitled to.

The Immemorial Divine Water needed to be refined and tamed before it could be consumed. This would have been a complicated process for others, but it was easy for Chu Feng. However, after Chu Feng refined, tamed, and consumed the Immemorial Divine Water, he quickly noticed that something was amiss.

He quickly expelled all of the Immemorial Divine Water from his body, including those he had already assimilated.

“This thing is dangerous!” Chu Feng stared at the Immemorial Divine Water with a furiously beating heart.

He had an ominous feeling when he assimilated the Immemorial Divine Water.

The Immemorial Divine Water would indeed raise his fighting prowess within a short period of time, and he didn’t suffer any backlash after consuming it either, but that didn’t mean that it had no side effects. On the contrary, its side effects were worse than forbidden medicine.

The Immemorial Divine Water increased his fighting prowess by a significant degree, to the point that he could even rival opponents a rank stronger than him, but when he further raised his cultivation and spirit power in the future, it would not only lower his fighting prowess but even cap his potential.

The downsides far surpassed the benefits!

“I wonder if Brother Shaoyu, Little Fishy, and Long Chengyu have consumed it. Hopefully, they didn’t take in too much of it,” Chu Feng murmured.

With their standing, it was likely that they would have received some Immemorial Divine Water. It was one thing if they consumed a small quantity, but if they consumed a significant quantity of it over a long period of time, it would surely affect their cultivation.

Time passed in a flash. Soon, it was time for the juniors in the Nine Heavens’ Zenith to gather.

The square was filled to the brim with people, as most people had arrived early to avoid being late for the tournament.

“Big brother!”

As soon as Chu Feng stepped out of his residence, before his silhouette emerged from the white fog, a euphonious voice echoed. Little Fishy was squatting beside his entrance. She hurriedly got to her feet and ran up to Chu Feng.

“You’re early, Little Fishy,” Chu Feng said with a smile.

“I should be early since it’s the commencement of the Nine Heavens’ Zenith. Big brother, your cultivation method really works. My speed of cultivation improved a lot after using your method,” Little Fishy said with a grin.

“You should have called me instead of squatting outside,” Chu Feng said.

“I didn’t want to disrupt your cultivation. I just arrived myself too,” Little Fishy said.

After exchanging some pleasantries, Chu Feng asked Little Fishy if she had consumed any Immemorial Divine Water. Her answer put his mind at ease.
