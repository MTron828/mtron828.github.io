Chapter 3530 - Void Sacred Tree

“Zzzzz~~~” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Under the focus of the crowd, a large amount of lightning emerged and formed a suit of armor before Chu Feng.

Seeing the surging lightning, the crowd’s eyes started shining.

They were shining in disbelief and utter astonishment.

“Lightning Armor. Never would I have imagined that young friend Chu Feng really managed to unseal the power of the Lightning Armor.”

Even Tantai Yinjian and the elders from the various powers gasped in astonishment.

They had actually already heard rumors that Chu Feng had also unlocked the power of the Lightning Armor.

However, that was, after all, a rumor. In fact, before Chu Feng’s battle against Linghu Hongfei, the crowd all felt those people spreading the rumor to be crazy.

Their reaction was understandable. After all, no one would believe such a rumor without actually witnessing it themselves.

After all, the rumor stated that Chu Feng had managed to unseal his Lightning Armor at the Martial Immortal realm.

Yet, when the truth was placed before them, they had no choice but to believe it.

“The hell?! You actually managed to unlock the power of the Lightning Armor?!”

Even Kong Tianhui opened his mouth wide with shock upon seeing the Lightning Armor on Chu Feng.

“Come, let’s continue,” said Chu Feng.

“Come my ass. No more, I’m done fighting you. This young master admits defeat,” said Kong Tianhui.

“Admits defeat?” The crowd could not believe their ears.

They had thought that Kong Tianhui might be trying to deceive Chu Feng by saying that. However, Kong Tianhui not only put away his Incomplete Exalted Armament, but he also put away his compass, and withdrew his Divine Power and treasure.

At that moment, Kong Tianhui’s cultivation returned to that of a rank one Exalted.

“That Kong Tianhui, he’s actually serious?”

The crowd looked to one another. They all felt it to be completely unimaginable.

It wasn’t that the crowd were making a fuss about nothing. It was simply that Kong Tianhui was too unfathomable.

Earlier, he had repeated himself over and over, shouting that he would kill Chu Feng, shouting that he would teach Chu Feng a lesson. Thus, how could he decide to concede all of a sudden?

“Are you really planning to concede?” Chu Feng narrowed his brows. He did not understand what Kong Tianhui was planning.

“Yes, yes, I concede. What’s there to fight about when I can’t beat you? This young master admits defeat, okay?” said Kong Tianhui.

“Let’s continue fighting. I want you to be able to accept your defeat wholeheartedly,” said Chu Feng.

“Why are you acting so incessantly? Is this not being too overbearing and forceful? I have already conceded to you. What else do you want from me?”

“Go ahead, speak your mind. Exactly what do I have to do to get you to drop the matter?”

Kong Tianhui’s previous condescending attitude was completely gone, and replaced with a miserable look. He was acting as if Chu Feng was the one that had come to challenge him; that Chu Feng was the one forcing him.

Seeing Kong Tianhui acting like that, the crowd all thought that Chu Feng might drop the subject at that.

Ignoring the fact that Kong Tianhui indeed seemed to be admitting his defeat, merely his status was sufficient to make Chu Feng not make things difficult for him. After all, if a battle was truly waged, not even a power like the Tantai Heavenly Clan would be a match for Divine Body Royal City. That would be even more so for a power like the Chu Heavenly Clan.

However, to the crowd’s surprise, Chu Feng smiled and then said, “While it’s fine for you to concede, you will have to apologize to my clan chief for your rudeness earlier.”

“Ah?”

The crowd’s hearts grew tense. This was especially true for the Chu Heavenly Clansmen. Their complexions ashened from fear.

To have Kong Tianhui apologize to the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was simply an impossible thing.

“Chu Feng, do not be rude,” even the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Supreme Elders immediately shouted at Chu Feng, fearing that his words would end up infuriating Kong Tianhui.

“Tsk, and here I was wondering what you would want from me,” to everyone’s surprise, Kong Tianhui was not only not angered, he instead turned to the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, clasped his fist, and bowed. “Senior Clan Chief Chu, this junior was rude earlier. I hope that you will not blame me.”

“Exactly what is going on with this guy?”

At that moment, the crowd were completely puzzled. Not only did Kong Tianhui apologize, but he was also extremely earnest in his apology.

Had they not witnessed it themselves, no one would believe that someone who was so arrogant that he did not place these seniors present in his eyes would actually suddenly admit defeat, and even apologize to someone that he had looked down on previously.

Most importantly, no one had really forced him to do so. At the very most, Chu Feng had only verbally demanded that he make an apology, and had not threatened him with anything.

It could be said that even if it was Chu Feng who wanted him to make the apology, it was Kong Tianhui who voluntarily apologized.

However, that was not all. Another shocking scene occurred.

“How’s that? Brother Chu Feng, are you satisfied now?”

Kong Tianhui walked over to Chu Feng and placed his arm on Chu Feng’s shoulder. Such behavior made it seem like he possessed an excellent relationship with Chu Feng, much akin to a brother.

“With you acting like this, what else can I say? That said, what exactly is your purpose in coming?” Chu Feng asked.

Chu Feng felt that Kong Tianhui’s behavior was simply too abnormal. Likely, there was another reason for his behavior.

“My, what are you talking about? What purpose could I have?” Kong Tianhui continued to smile. Then, he looked to the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief. “Senior Clan Chief Chu, weren’t you preparing a banquet earlier? Remember to arrange me and brother Chu Feng to be seated together when making the seating arrangements.”

“Very well, this old man will definitely arrange it,” the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief smiled and nodded.

Although he also knew that Kong Tianhui’s behavior was extremely strange, it would be their Chu Heavenly Clan’s blessing if they were able to befriend Divine Body Royal City.

“Woosh~~~”

Right at that moment, a bird rapidly flew over and landed in Chu Xuanzhengfa’s hand.

That was a messenger bird. After it landed on Chu Xuanzhengfa’s hand, it turned into a ray of light that assimilated into his body.

This sort of messenger bird was very common. Originally, no one took notice of it. However, to the crowd’s surprise, Chu Xuanzhengfa’s expression changed slightly. Then, he arrived beside the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

“What’s the matter? You can say it directly,” Originally, Chu Xuanzhengfa had wanted to make his report through voice transmission. However, he was suddenly interrupted by the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

The reason why the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said those words was because he wanted to show respect for the guests present.

“Lord Clan Chief, it seems that the spirit formation around the Void Sacred Tree is about to dissipate,” said Chu Xuanzhengfa.

“Ah?”

Chu Xuanzhengfa’s words caused not only the people of the older generation from the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm and the Chu Heavenly Clan to have a change of expression, but even Chu Feng’s expression changed enormously.

What sort of place was the Void Sacred Tree? It was one of the Six Great Sacred Vestiges of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. It was a sacred cultivation ground that opened once every hundred years.

That said, if that was all there was to it, Chu Feng would not have such an intense reaction.

The reason for Chu Feng’s intense reaction was because there had been movement inside the Void Sacred Tree before. Because of that, Chu Feng went over to survey it, and ended up discovering Wang Qiang’s handwriting on the Void Sacred Tree.

Thus, Chu Feng felt that Wang Qiang... was very likely inside the Void Sacred Tree.
