Chapter 5111: So Shocked That He Thought It Was a Dream

“Did we see it wrongly?”

The crowd was dumbstruck. Chu Feng’s cultivation actually surpassed the peak Martial Exalted level expert? Wouldn’t that mean that he was also at Martial Exalted level too?

But how was that possible? How could Chu Feng reach such a level within such a short period of time? He was clearly only at Utmost Exalted level during the tournament to determine the strongest junior of the Holy Light Galaxy!

Grar!

While everyone was struggling to make sense of the situation, the red aura poured out from the Darknight Sacred River with tremendous momentum and gushed straight toward Chu Feng. It was moving with far greater force than before.

Chu Feng didn’t lose his cool despite the situation. The space around him warped, and the Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, and Black Tortoise appeared one after another. With the enhancement from the Four Symbols Divine Power, his cultivation had further risen by a rank. It wasn’t enough for him to reach Half-God level, but he was now three ranks stronger than a rank eight Martial Exalted level cultivator.

Boom!

Chu Feng hurled out a punch. It was a simple punch, but it instantaneously crushed the terrifying red aura.

Grar!

However, the red aura swiftly made a resurgence with even greater fervor. It had grown to the level where it was difficult for Chu Feng to match its might.

“Lord Kui Ting, lend me your strength,” Chu Feng said.

“Understood,” a voice that only he could hear echoed in response.

It was from Asura King Kui Ting.

Following that, Kui Ting’s energy started to flow from the World Spirit Space into his body, imbuing him with the strength of a rank four Half-God level cultivator. With the strength of a Half-God, all it took was just a simple wave of his hand to dissipate the red aura.

At the same time, it revealed Chu Feng’s current level of strength.

“What’s that aura? Am I seeing things?”

Putting aside the cultivators of the Ancestral Martial Starfield and the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, even the Holy Light Clansmen were terrified by the aura Chu Feng was emanating. They felt like they were suffocating under the sheer pressure even though the power wasn’t directed toward them.

“You’re lucky to be able to witness this. If you can pull yourself together and feel it with your heart, it might just be of great help to your future cultivation. What young friend Chu Feng is emanating right now is the power of the gods. This might be the only opportunity in your lifetime to feel something like this,” Shengguang Baimei suddenly spoke out loud.

Those words caused a huge commotion.

“The power of the gods? Could it be that Chu Feng has reached Half-God level? Isn’t that just something of the legends?”

The crowd was shocked by what they were hearing. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Half-God level was simply too far away from them that many of them suspected that it was just a legend. However, they didn’t think that Shengguang Baimei would lie to them about this.

“Chu Feng has really reached Half-God level?”

Looking at Chu Feng once more, the crowd finally understood why the Holy Light Clansmen would personally construct palaces for the Chu Heavenly Clan.

Chu Feng had actually gotten this powerful without them knowing.

Pah pah!

Two slaps echoed loudly amidst the crowd.

It was from the Divine Body Royal City’s Kong Tianhui. He had slapped himself without holding back, evidenced by the bloody palm prints on his face.

“I must be dreaming. I must be freaking dreaming, right? No matter how powerful Brother Chu Feng is, there’s no way he could reach the legendary Half-God level within such a short period of time. Wouldn’t that mean that he has already reached the peak of cultivation? But… isn’t he just a junior?”

Kong Tianhui couldn’t help but wonder if it was all a dream.

He was a doltish person who spoke loudly regardless of the situation. With the surroundings plunging into silence, practically everyone heard his words loud and clear. The reality of things was hard to bear for the juniors of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, especially Song Yunfei and the others who bore hostility toward Chu Feng.

Back when they first met Chu Feng, he was still nothing but a True Immortal. His existence was inconsequential to them then. Yet, he actually stepped into the legendary Half-God level?

But it had only been a few years since their first meeting! He actually advanced across True Immortal, Heavenly Immortal, Martial Immortal, Exalted, Utmost Exalted, and Martial Exalted within such a short period of time?

Was this even humanly possible?

Chu Feng felt a little helpless seeing the crowd’s reaction. He didn’t think that Shengguang Baimei would brag about this even though he was only at rank eight Martial Exalted level.

Grar!

The red aura suddenly returned with greater force than before. This time, its prowess had transcended the limits of Martial Exalted level to reach rank one Half-God level.

Of course, the might of a rank one Half-God couldn’t possibly pose a threat to Chu Feng. He was able to easily curb it with a wave of his hand.

However, the red aura soon returned with the force of a rank two Half-God level cultivator.

Chu Feng was still able to curb it with ease this time around, but he quickly realized that something was amiss.

“Everyone, things are going to get dangerous, so I’ll have to ask you to back off,” Chu Feng said.

Chu Feng’s words were no different from a divine edict to the crowd. They wouldn’t dare to disregard his words. Everyone, including Shengguang Baimei and the others, hurriedly backed off until they thought that they were at a safe distance away.

Chu Feng was the only one left in the vicinity of the Darknight Sacred River, but he remained on alert. He was ready to flee right away if things were to go awry.

By this point, it had become apparent to him that the Darknight Sacred River had the power to grow endlessly strong. At this rate, even if the Asura King were to personally make a move, it was only a matter of time before they succumbed to the red aura.

Grar!

As expected, the red aura soon returned with the force of a rank three Half-God level cultivator.

Chu Feng was able to dissipate it quickly this time around too, but he wasn’t confident of doing so once the red aura reached rank four Half-God level.

“Lord Chu Feng, please let me out,” the Asura King said.

“Give me a moment more. I’ll give up if it doesn’t work,” Chu Feng said.

He wanted to try using the Asura King’s power to deal with the rank four Half-God level attack by the red aura himself. He had already decided that after stopping the rank four Half-God level attack, he would immediately turn tail and flee.

Otherwise, the red aura would return with the might of a rank five Half-God level cultivator, and that would be beyond his means to deal with.
