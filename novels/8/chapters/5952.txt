Chapter 5953: The Tides Have Changed

Back when Chu Feng was in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, he met a man in the Sacred Heavenly Temple, who competed with him over treasures using their psyche.

That man was none other than Xianhai Shuoyi.

Xianhai Shuoyi was of lower standing in the Immortal Sea Fish Clan, but his mother was one of Little Fishy’s maids. It was through this relationship that he was able to meet Little Fishy. The latter always treated all clansmen well, which led Xianhai Shuoyi to think that they were on close terms.

However, Little Fishy only treated him as a friend, whereas he harbored feelings for her.

After Little Fishy returned from the Eastern Sea Region with an additional trinket on her ankles, her attitude toward him suddenly became colder.

Xianhai Shuoyi suspected that she had received the trinket as a gift from a man, so he had been gifting trinkets to Little Fishy, hoping to replace the one she was wearing. However, he overestimated how much he weighed in Little Fishy’s heart.

His defeat to Chu Feng in the Sacred Heavenly Temple left him in a gloomy mood, which prompted him to confess to Little Fishy when he met her again. On the surface, it looked as if he simply wanted her to remove her trinket, but his true motive was to claim dominance over her.

He didn’t want other men to take the position he had in Little Fishy’s heart.

But it turned out that he didn’t have a place in Little Fishy’s heart. She had only been polite to him thus far because she saw him as a friend. His confession only brought about her aversion, and he lost his chance to get close to her anymore.

Instead of giving up, he focused on his cultivation, hoping to change Little Fishy’s mind and return to her side. He knew there was a huge gap between them, but he still dreamt of winning her affection.

Each time he made a breakthrough, his confidence would rise a notch.

Xianhai Shuoyi didn’t take a rest despite having just made a breakthrough. He immediately dove back into his cultivation. In the last few years, he had paid little heed to anything else other than his cultivation and obtaining more cultivation resources.

He wouldn’t even pay much heed to others talking about Little Fishy, as he knew it wasn’t time for him to meet her yet.

But he found it terribly hard to devote his attention to his cultivation after learning that Little Fishy was now in the Myriad Immortals Refinement Lakes. In the end, he opened his eyes.

“Is Yu’er really here?”

He didn’t want to appear before Xianhai Yu’er with his current cultivation level, but he still rose into the air, hoping to catch a glimpse of her even if he couldn’t greet her. Soon, his heart began to beat fast as he saw the silhouette he had been dreaming about.

Her fair skin that glowed under the sunlight, her slender legs, and her impeccable face and physique; they were just as how he imagined her to be. If this place was heaven, she was the only goddess here.

Xianhai Yu’er was not just the most beautiful woman in his eyes. Most men would agree with that sentiment too.

“Yu’er, you’re still as flawlessly beautiful as ever. No words in the world are sufficient to compliment you,” Xianhai Shuoyi remarked with a smile. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

He thought about the time he had spent with Little Fishy. Much of it was his imagination, but he would still often immerse himself in it.

“That is?”

Soon, the smile on his face morphed into anger. He realized that Little Fishy’s eyes had been following someone. He initially thought that person was Xianhai Shaoyu, only to freeze up upon taking a closer look.

He recognized that person. It was the man who embarrassed him in the Sacred Heavenly Temple, Chu Feng!

“What is he doing here?” Xianhai Shuoyi rubbed his eyes, not daring to believe what he was seeing.

In his heart, he had always thought that Chu Feng was trash, and he had only lost due to the restrictions imposed by the Sacred Heavenly Temple. If it had been a battle of cultivation instead of psyche then, he could have smashed Chu Feng into pieces with a mere thought.

How could such trash be qualified to enter their Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s cultivation spot?

What right did he have to make the incomparably noble Her Highness Yu’er cultivate with him?

The more he looked at Chu Feng, the more Xianhai Shuoyi sensed that something was amiss. While Chu Feng was cultivating in the lake, Little Fishy sat by the lake barefoot, with the trinket still around her ankle.

Little Fishy would only accompany Xianhai Shaoyu for his cultivation every now and then, but that was because they were siblings. The mischievous Little Fishy would splash him with water while he was cultivating before running off shortly after.

Yet, Little Fishy was now obediently seated by the side, not daring to even touch the lake with her feet lest she interrupt his cultivation. She was unbelievably obedient.

Above all, she looked at Chu Feng intently with a blissful smile lingering on her lips.

Someone of Little Fishy’s personality should have been bored out of her mind right now, yet she was enjoying this very moment.

The sensitive Xianhai Shuoyi keenly sensed something. He clutched his aching chest, which was hurting more than any pain he had ever felt.

“Bastard!” Xianhai Shuoyi roared.

This roar caught everyone’s attention.

Even the cultivating Chu Feng opened his eyes. He sensed a killing intent surging toward him.

Uwa!

However, the person behind the killing intent plummeted from the sky before he could reach him. It was neither Xianhai Yu’er nor Chu Feng’s doing but the elder guarding the place.

The elder firmly pinned Xianhai Shuoyi down to the ground by his neck with a single hand.

“Let me go! I’ll slaughter him!” Xianhai Shuoyi roared while struggling with all his might.

“My apologies for disturbing your rest, young hero Chu Feng. I’ll lock this lunatic up right now.” The elder lifted Xianhai Shuoyi as if carrying a little chick to take him away.

“Wait a moment. I know him,” Chu Feng suddenly said.

“Big brother, you know him?”

Many of the Immortal Sea Fish Clansmen present, including Little Fishy, were surprised.

“He was the opponent I encountered when I entered the Sacred Heavenly Temple back then. You’re Xianhai Shuoyi, right? Do you remember me? I, your grandfather Chu Feng, am the one who defeated you back then,” Chu Feng said with a smile.

He even imitated the tone he had taken when he met Xianhai Shuoyi back then. Meeting Xianhai Shuoyi again felt pleasant as if meeting an old friend, as it reminded him of his old days.

He was oblivious to how huge the world of cultivation was back when he was still cultivating in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, such that he couldn’t even grasp just how huge of a powerhouse the Immortal Sea Fish Clan was.

Back then, the Chu Heavenly Clan, who governed the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, already looked like a behemoth to him. He was weak but fearless back then, which, thinking back, made him think that the past him was very naive.

Even so, he wasn’t embarrassed of his old days. He was proud of what he had achieved, and he often reminisced about it.

“Of course I remember you! You little thief. How did you sneak into our Immortal Sea Fish Clan? What are you planning to do to Yu’er?” Xianhai Shuoyi roared.

The crowd was surprised.

They didn’t expect Chu Feng to know Xianhai Shuoyi, though it didn’t seem like they had a pleasant encounter. Many of them started shaking their heads, thinking that Xianhai Shuoyi was doomed for having offended Chu Feng.

Chu Feng was smiling, but Little Fishy’s eyes were icy-cold. Never had they seen such a terrifying look from Little Fishy before.

“Release me! I’ll slaughter him!” Xianhai Shuoyi roared through gritted teeth.

“Shut your mouth!” The elder exerted his martial power to stop Xianhai Shuoyi from speaking.

“My apologies, young hero Chu Feng. I don’t know what’s gotten over him. I’m sincerely sorry for the trouble he has caused,” the elder said.

“It’s fine. I did have a small conflict with him, but it’s all in the past. Elder, please deal with him normally. There’s no need to be harsh on him because of me,” Chu Feng said. He then turned to Little Fishy and said, “Let’s go.”

“Big brother, are you done?” Little Fishy asked.

“Mm.” Chu Feng nodded.

The two of them left together.

Chu Feng had no interest in teaching Xianhai Shuoyi a lesson. Their grudge was a thing of the past, not to mention the current Xianhai Shuoyi wasn’t worthy of having him make a move.
