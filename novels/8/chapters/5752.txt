Chapter 5752: Jie Tian’s Trump CardVissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Jie Tian stood in the middle of the dueling ring. The surging dragon he had been riding on was nowhere to be seen, but he was completely unharmed.

He was wrapped in two layers of energy. One was so powerful that it produced a phenomenon around him—it was his bloodline power, the Ruler’s Bloodline! The other was a unique formation that perfectly complemented the Ruler’s Bloodline.

The two layers of energy further boosted Jie Tian’s fighting prowess. He previously wielded strength on par with a rank nine Half-God level fighting power, and he now had heaven-defying battle power of one cultivation rank on top of that.

Of course, this was not enough to rival True Dragon World Spiritist, but it was a terrifying force to behold.

“Why are you hiding the dueling ring? Are you afraid of losing to me again?” Little Fishy asked.

Jie Tian chuckled and replied, “They aren’t worthy of seeing my means. Xianhai Yu’er, I’ll admit you’re a formidable opponent. I wasn’t a match for you back then. However, I am not the same person I used to be. You don’t stand a chance against me anymore.”

His eyes were filled with excitement and unwavering confidence. He had been waiting for a day to cleanse the humiliation he suffered that day, and he had sacrificed a lot for it.

And the chance to do so was finally right before him.

Jie Tian’s overflowing confidence evoked Little Fishy’s laughter.

“Is this your trump card? I’m sorry to disappoint you then,” Little Fishy said as her aura changed yet again.

Taken aback by her transformation, Jie Tian’s earlier confidence disappeared without a trace.

…

“If Jie Tian was the one who constructed that concealment formation, it would mean that he survived Xianhai Yu’er’s God Taboo Martial Skill, right? But why did he construct that formation in the first place? What’s happening inside?”

The crowd was anxious to know what was happening inside.

“Chu Feng, are you able to peer into the dueling ring?” Feng Ling asked.

“The dueling ring is imbued with a special formation, and Jie Tian’s concealment formation is not to be made light of either. I’m afraid I can’t see what’s going on in the dueling ring too.”

“Does Jie Tian truly possess the Ruler’s Bloodline? If so, will Little Fishy be fine?” Feng Ling was worried.

Xian Miaomiao and Long Muxi were concerned too. It hadn’t been long since they met, but they were extremely fond of her.

“Look! The formation is dissipating!”

The crowd noticed that the concealment formation around the dueling ring began to dissipate, though Little Fishy leaped out of the dueling ring before the formation fully disappeared.

Chu Feng and the others heaved a sigh of relief upon seeing her unharmed.

“What happened to Jie Tian?”

As the formation dissipated, the crowd saw Jie Tian lying unconscious in the dueling ring with a bloodied gorge in his chest. Blood was profusely spurting from his nose and mouth. Clearly, he had lost this duel.

“You bastard! Do you have to go this far for a spar?”

The juniors from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion were infuriated. They were obliged to protect Jie Tian in view of his background even though they weren’t close to him.

“You should be glad he isn’t dead. Step forward if you want to avenge him. I, Xianhai Shaoyu, will play with you,” Xianhai Shaoyu said.

As angry as the juniors from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion were, none of them dared to make a move on Xianhai Shaoyu. They knew they wouldn’t stand a chance at all.

“Our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion won’t let this go!”

Xianhai Shaoyu couldn’t be bothered to respond. The strong spoke with their strength; only the weak would bring up their background.

Interestingly, neither Ling Xiao nor Jie Baobao spoke a word about the matter.

Ling Xiao leaped onto the dueling ring to treat Jie Tian, but a surge of recovery energy shrouded Jie Tian before he could finish constructing his formation.

Weng!

It was Liu Kuo.

“Benefactor Ling Xiao, please leave Benefactor Jie Tian to me,” Liu Kuo said.

“I’ll be counting on you,” Ling Xiao said as he retreated from the dueling ring. He could tell from Liu Kuo’s formidable recovery formation that he would be fine.

Liu Kuo rubbed one of the prayer beads in his hand, and both him and Liu Kuo vanished into thin air.

“Is Jie Tian eliminated just like that?”

“Xianhai Yu’er is too powerful! It’s no wonder she was invited to the Nine Heavens’ Zenith instead of Xianhai Shaoyu.”

“That’s terrifying! In terms of talent, she has most likely surpassed the first Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s Clan Chief.”

“A Xianhai Shaoyu is already scary, and now there’s a Xianhai Yu’er too. No one can stop the rise of the Immortal Sea Fish Clan in God’s Era anymore.”

A commotion broke out amidst the crowd after Jie Tian was taken away by Liu Kuo. The daring ones spoke those words aloud, whereas the timid ones communicated via voice transmission. This was simply too shocking to them.

Jie Tian was, without a doubt, incredibly powerful, but Xianhai Yu’er defeated him within an extremely short period of time. This indicated just how terrifyingly powerful she was. Perhaps, she was the true dark horse of the Nine Heavens’ Zenith.

“Little sister Yu’er, you’re amazing. As a reward for teaching Jie Tian a lesson, I’ll make you a scrumptious feast!” Feng Ling said.

“Big sister, you know how to cook?” Little Fishy blinked her large eyes as she asked.

“Of course! My cooking is the real deal, not involving any world spiritist techniques, and I can guarantee that it’ll be delicious!” Feng Ling said.

“Wonderful! I also want to cook something for big brother too,” Little Fishy exclaimed.

Upon hearing those words, Xianhai Shaoyu quickly leaned toward Chu Feng and whispered, “Brother Chu Feng, don’t say that I didn’t warn you. You should think twice about trying my little sister’s cooking.”

Just then, Long Chengyu walked out of the white fog and asked, “What are all of you doing here?”

“Long Chengyu, what took you so long? You missed the show. Jie Tian has been eliminated,” Feng Ling said.

“Jie Tian? How was he eliminated? Has the tournament begun?” Long Chengyu was confused.

“The tournament hasn’t started yet. Jie Tian attacked Chu Feng, so little sister Yu’er furiously challenged him to a duel, with a bet that the loser has to leave the Nine Heavens’ Zenith. You get it,” Feng Ling said gloatingly.

Her desire for drama had been satisfied.
