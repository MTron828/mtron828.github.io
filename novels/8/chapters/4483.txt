Chapter 4483: The Person in the Painting

“Miaomiao, is it really you? Is your mother really from the Nine Souls Sacred Clan? So, the place where you returned to is the Nine Souls Sacred Clan?” Chu Feng asked in agitation.

Instead of replying to Chu Feng straight, Xiao Miaomiao turned to look at the two Supreme Elders and said, “Grandpa Xuansheng, Grandma Tiansheng, I would like to have a private chat with him.”

The black-haired old man immediately understood Xian Miaomiao’s intention. With a wave of his hand, he sealed up the area around Chu Feng and Xian Miaomiao, creating a private space where no one could eavesdrop into.

Xian Miaomiao began to share her story with Chu Feng.

Back then, Xian Miaomiao’s mother forcefully took her away from the Holy Land of Martialism and brought her to the Nine Souls Sacred Clan.

Xian Miaomiao’s cultivation was simply too weak as compared to the other members of the clan when she first arrived back at the Nine Souls Sacred Clan, so her mother gathered a huge bunch of treasures and used the secret skills of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan to raise her cultivation rapidly.

All of the resources devoted to Xian Miaomiao paid off as her cultivation rose by leaps and bounds, but at the same time, it also caused a huge strain on her body. It resulted in her losing her memories of everything that happened at the Holy Land of Martialism, as well as the fact that she had come from the Holy Land of Martialism.

At the same time, Xian Miaomiao’s mother also didn’t wish for Xian Miaomiao to get too obsessed with the affairs of the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm, so she lied to Xian Miaomiao, telling her that she had grown up in the Nine Souls Sacred Clan.

Due to that, she had never returned to the Holy Land of Martialism, and she didn’t return to the Holy Light Galaxy to look for Chu Feng either.

Even when she arrived here a moment ago, her memories still hadn’t returned yet.

It was Chu Feng’s voice that struck up a feeling of nostalgia within her. When she looked at his face and saw the familiar eyes that she had seen many times before, the memories that had been buried in the depths of her mind surfaced once more.

Xian Miaomiao also told Chu Feng that she had gotten rid of those people who had tortured Chu Feng earlier.

“I didn’t think that you would regain your memories due to me. I must have been quite important to you, huh?” Chu Feng remarked with a chuckle.

He was also very thankful for Xian Miaomiao’s timely arrival here, or else he might have really lost his life.

“Of course! You’re my best friend!” Xian Miaomiao replied with a beaming smile.

“But Miaomiao, wouldn’t the act of killing your own clan members bring you great trouble?” Chu Feng asked.

“It won’t. There’s a clear hierarchy within the Nine Souls Sacred Clan. Given their lowly standing, no one would dare to make things difficult for this princess for killing them,” Xian Miaomiao replied confidently.

“What are you doing in this region though?” Chu Feng asked curiously.

He found out that Xian Miaomiao and Princess Youyou hadn’t come here together, which meant that Xian Miaomiao really happened to pass by this area and meet Chu Feng. It was an unbelievable coincidence, but it had indeed happened.

Nevertheless, Chu Feng was still curious as to what kind of business Xian Miaomiao had here.

“I came here in search of a hidden place,” Xian Miaomiao said as she took out a map.

This map left Chu Feng with deep feelings inside. It was the same map that the Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief and the Black-White Twin Malevolence had.

It was just that the routes on the map had vanished, leaving behind only the words ‘Chu Hanxian’.

“It’s a little weird. There were still clear routes indicated on the map earlier, but just a moment ago, they disappeared without a trace,” Xian Miaomiao said.

“So you’re here for that hidden place too...” Chu Feng remarked with a deep look.

He knew the reason why the routes on the map had vanished—the hidden place had closed off once again.

“Could it be that you also came here due to this?” Xian Miaomiao asked Chu Feng.

“That’s right.”

Chu Feng and Xian Miaomiao were on extremely close terms with one another, so he didn’t hide anything from her.

“My gosh, this is truly the work of fate. I must really thank this map, or else who knows when I would have been able to recover my memories and meet you once again?” Xian Miaomiao remarked.

“Indeed. How do those words go again? Fate brings people from two ends of the world together,” Chu Feng agreed with a chuckle.

Chu Feng and Xian Miaomiao had gone through a lot together in the Ancestral Martial Lower World. A lot of the friends he had made back then were trapped in the Ancestral Martial Lower World due to the limitations of their talent.

Even though it was still possible for them to meet one another, they were no longer comrades that could fight side-by-side anymore.

So, meeting Xian Miaomiao once more here had a great significance to Chu Feng, and he was overjoyed by this unexpected reunion.

“Did you manage to find that hidden place?” Xian Miaomiao asked.

“I did. It’s located in that mountain range over there. However, the hidden place has already closed off, which is also the reason why the routes on your map suddenly disappeared,” Chu Feng replied.

“Ah. It looks like I was a step too slow. Did you manage to meet the owner of the hidden place, the person named Chu Hanxian?” Xian Miaomiao pointed to the words ‘Chu Hanxian’ on the map as she asked.

“I didn’t manage to meet him,” Chu Feng shook his head in disappointment.

“Hai...”

Xian Miaomiao sighed deeply upon hearing those words.

“Why do you seem more concerned about Chu Hanxian than the treasures that lie within the hidden place?” Chu Feng asked curiously.

He had already sensed that something was amiss here. Xian Miaomiao was here for the hidden place, but she only asked about Chu Hanxian and nothing else. From the looks of it, it seemed like she wasn’t interested in the treasures that could have been inside the hidden place.

“Well, I came here to find Chu Hanxian,” Xian Miaomiao replied.

Her words were spoken casually, but it caused great waves to rise within Chu Feng’s heart.

Why would Xian Miaomiao be looking for his grandfather? Could it be that she knew something about his grandfather?

“Miaomiao, why are you looking for Chu Hanxian?” Chu Feng asked.

“That’s because we stumbled upon an exceptionally powerful elder, and we wish to look for her,” Xian Miaomiao replied. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Can you fill me in on the details?” Chu Feng asked.

He was unwilling to miss any information he could possibly get about his grandfather.

“Of course. There’s nothing I can’t say to you,” Xian Miaomiao replied with a smile.

As it turned out, the Nine Souls Sacred Clan had encountered a problem not too long ago. A strong cultivator had come over from another galaxy to provoke the Nine Souls Sacred Clan.

In order to deal with this cultivator, the Nine Souls Sacred Clan dispatched many of its top-notch experts to deal with him, but they ended up falling into a stalemate. Both sides were simply equally matched with one another.

It was at that moment that an old woman suddenly appeared on the battlefield.

Any ordinary cultivator would have surely kept their distance or even fled right away upon seeing their battle, but this old woman walked right into the midst of their fight as if she couldn’t see anyone at all.

She walked extremely slowly as she chanted a name over and over again.

This sudden interference from the old woman angered the powerful expert from another galaxy, so he made a move against the old woman.

No one could have thought that the seemingly mad old woman was actually a hidden master. Her strength was actually even above that of the strong cultivator, and she crushed his soul in a single move.

But right after defeating the powerful expert, the old woman suddenly disappeared once again.

Hearing the story up to this point, Chu Feng anxiously asked, “What is the name she kept on chanting?”

“The name that the elder chanted was ‘Hanxian’,” Xian Miaomiao replied.

“Hanxian?” Chu Feng was astonished.

“Yes. It just so happened that we received a lead that there’s a hidden place whose master goes by the name of Chu Hanxian right after. Even though we can’t be sure whether it’s the same person as the elder chanted, we thought that we should still take a look. We thought that as long as we find the person the elder is looking for, we should be able to find the elder too.

“The strength displayed by the elder is simply too overwhelming. If our Nine Souls Sacred Clan could tap into her strength, we’d be able to raise our power and influence significantly,” Xian Miaomiao explained.

Listening up to this point, Chu Feng’s heart had already fallen into discomposure. He couldn’t calm down at all.

He had a strong feeling that the old woman Xian Miaomiao spoke about knew his grandfather, and perhaps, she might even be his grandmother!

“Miaomiao, can you describe how the elder looks like?” Chu Feng asked.

“Our clan member has drawn out a sketch of that elder. I’ll show it to you.”

As Xian Miaomiao spoke, she took out a drawing and passed it over to Chu Feng.

Chu Feng unrolled the painting, and upon seeing the figure depicted on it, he couldn’t help but gasp in shock. He felt like his heart was going to pound right out of his chest.

He was so agitated that it was even showing on his face.

“It’s actually her?” Chu Feng exclaimed in shock.

He actually recognized the person depicted in the painting!
