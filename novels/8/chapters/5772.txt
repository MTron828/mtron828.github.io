Chapter 5772: Rumors

“Sometimes, the choices that we make are more important than working hard,” Ling Xiao’s voice suddenly echoed. He was standing in mid-air a distance away.

Chu Feng had long discovered his presence.

Ling Xiao was around when Jie Baobao was on the verge of succumbing to the formation entities. He had a formation ready, and he was prepared to step in to save Jie Baobao if it came down to it.

For that reason, Chu Feng had a favorable impression of Ling Xiao too.

“Ling Xiao, it’s your loss for not working together with Chu Feng,” Jie Baobao said.

“I know, I know. I’m already regretting it.” Ling Xiao descended from the sky and looked at Chu Feng. “Lord Jie Ranqing’s son is indeed impressive. I wonder if it’s too late for me to work with you?”

“Of course not,” Chu Feng replied.

“That’s great. I noticed there are three formation cores in this world, and we’ll have to work on them simultaneously in order to escape from here,” Ling Xiao said.

“There are indeed three formation cores, but it might be much better if we work together on one of them,” Chu Feng said.

“Work together on one of them?” Ling Xiao and Jie Baobao were taken aback.

“If you trust me, we should abandon the other two formations and focus on deciphering one of the formation cores,” Chu Feng said.

“I’ll follow Chu Feng,” Jie Baobao said.

“I guess there’s no choice then. I’m the minority here,” Ling Xiao said with a smile.

Chu Feng and Jie Baobao smiled too.

When Chu Feng first saw the two of them, he thought that they would become his nemeses. He didn’t think that it was possible for them to get along so harmoniously.

The three of them headed to one of the formation cores and activated it. Chu Feng, Jie Baobao, and Ling Xiao found themselves enveloped by a slaughter formation each. They had to work together to channel the formation core, or else the slaughter formation would take their lives.

“This is an illusion. Don’t be fooled by it,” Chu Feng said.

He channeled his slaughter formation to break the synergy among their three slaughter formations. Such an act should have triggered the slaughter formations to kill them, but much to their surprise, their slaughter formations transformed into sealing formations instead.

As long as they could overcome their sealing formations, they would be able to free themselves.

“I see. I’m impressed,” Ling Xiao remarked.

He finally understood what Chu Feng meant. If they had followed their instincts and channeled the formation core for their self-preservation, they would have been wasting their spirit power, as they wouldn’t have been able to breach this formation. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Chu Feng saw through that from the very start, which was why Ling Xiao was impressed.

Ling Xiao himself could have probably seen through this facade in due time, but he couldn’t have done so that quickly.

Both Ling Xiao and Jie Baobao put everything they had to decipher the formation, and it didn’t take them long to break free of the formation binding them. The two of them succeeded almost at the same time as each other.

But when they turned to Chu Feng, they saw that he was still in the midst of deciphering his formation. In fact, he was only halfway through.

“It was a pleasant partnership. I wish all the best for the two of you,” Chu Feng said to the two of them with a smile.

Before they could reply, Ling Xiao and Jie Baobao were enveloped by teleportation energy and transported into a deep cavern filled with dangers. The teleportation energy morphed into two keys, and each of them received one.

The two of them had been through many remnants and formation realms, so they weren’t too surprised by the situation. They didn’t know what the purpose of the formation keys was yet, but they were their rewards for clearing the first stage, and they were bound to be useful later on.

“How is it?” Ling Xiao asked.

“What?” Jie Baobao asked.

“How is working with Chu Feng?”

“What do you think?”

“One word—exhilarating,” Ling Xiao replied.

“Ah…” Jie Baobao was taken aback.

She was not particularly close with Ling Xiao, but the latter had always come off to her as a reticent individual. She didn’t expect to hear such words from him.

“So, this is how it feels like to have someone to rely on. Everything suddenly becomes much easier,” Ling Xiao remarked.

“Should we keep this matter a secret?” Jie Baobao asked.

“Of course. We’ll have to keep our distance from Chu Feng unless the Sacred Mansion chooses to accept Chu Feng, or else we and our clans will be implicated,” Ling Xiao said.

“It’s the Sacred Manion’s loss for not accepting Chu Feng,” Jie Baobao grumbled.

It was not just about their earlier partnership; the prowess of Chu Feng’s Heavenly Lightning Bloodline had impressed her too. At that moment, she felt as if she was standing before a true king.

She thought that the prodigies of the Nine Heavens’ Zenith could be split into two categories. There was Chu Feng, then there were the others.

“Chu Feng’s overwhelming talents will become well-known after the Nine Heavens’ Zenith. I reckon Lord Mansion Master will retract his decision and instead embrace Chu Feng… but I can tell that Chu Feng is someone with a temper. I don’t know if he’ll be willing to return to our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion,” Ling Xiao said.

“What if Lord Jie Ranqing steps in to advise Chu Feng?” Jie Baobao asked.

“There might be a good chance if Lord Jie Ranqing intervenes,” Ling Xiao replied.

“Ling Xiao, do you know where Lord Jie Ranqing is?”

“I don’t know.”

“I heard some bad rumors.” Jie Baobao’s face turned grim.

“I heard similar rumors too, but that’s impossible. Lord Mansion Master dotes a lot on Lord Jie Ranqing. Taking a step back, it’s not entirely unforgivable for Lord Jie Ranqing to get together with an outsider, not to mention Chu Feng has proven that his father is no ordinary cultivator through his overwhelmingly powerful Heavenly Lightning Bloodline.

“This proves Lord Jie Ranqing’s decision was right. She might have chosen an outsider, but she chose the right person here,” Ling Xiao said.

“So, the rumors are false?” Jie Baobao asked.

“They have to be. There are restless people in the Sacred Mansion who enjoy stirring trouble. We can’t blindly accept any rumors we hear,” Ling Xiao said.
