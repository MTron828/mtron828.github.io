Chapter 3522 - Came For Revenge

“So it was him. No wonder..."

Li Yue’er suddenly recalled that she had indeed been in a very dangerous situation while attempting her breakthrough earlier. She was deeply frightened then, and thought that she would end up failing. However, for some unknown reason, that dangerous situation was suddenly resolved.

Furthermore, the powerful resistance also decreased by many times in an instant.

She was confused by why that would happen. However, she now came to realize that it was actually because Chu Feng had helped her.

“He not only helped you neutralize the power of the formation core, but also converted the power of the lightning into natural energies and restricted them within his body. Then, he imbued the converted natural energies into your body.”

“Because of that, he even solved the most terrifying aspect of the formation core, the Lightning Curse, for you,” said Lord Frog.

“Lightning Curse?” Li Yue’er seemed to recall something. She hurriedly looked down at her chest.

Then, she began to survey her body, seemingly searching for something. When she was unable to find it, she grew more and more nervous.

“Lord Frog, could it be that the Lightning Curse ended up on Chu Feng’s body?” Li Yue’er had a complicated expression. She was not only worried; more than that, she was feeling guilty.

She knew very well how terrifying that Lightning Curse was. If she wanted to continue to stay in the formation core, it would depend on her own talent as to how much progress she could make.

However, the first hurdle was the most dangerous one. The reason for that was because of the Lightning Curse.

Not only would the Lightning Curse remain in one’s body for the rest of one’s life, but it would also likely flare up when one was attempting a breakthrough in cultivation.

If one were to suddenly be filled with acute pain where even one’s mind remained unclear while they were completely focused on making a breakthrough, how could one continue?

That was the reason why Li Yue’er would react in such a manner. She was worried that she had harmed Chu Feng.

If that Lightning Curse could not be taken care of, it would likely ruin his future.

“Indeed, it landed on Chu Feng. However, he neutralized it. Chu Feng... obtained the Lightning Curse’s acknowledgement,” said Lord Frog.

“He actually obtained the Lightning Curse’s acknowledgement?” Li Yue’er felt extremely shocked.

“Indeed. If I hadn’t witnessed it myself, even this old man wouldn’t have believed that someone really managed to obtain the Lightning Curse’s acknowledgement.”

“Thus, that friend of yours is quite powerful. Furthermore... he treats you pretty well.” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“It is all thanks to him that you don’t have to suffer from the complications of the Lightning Curse. With that, your future training will be much easier,” said Lord Frog.

“In that case, it would mean that I owe that guy an enormous favor,” said Li Yue’er.

“That’s right. A single Incomplete Exalted Armament wouldn’t be enough to return that favor,” Lord Frog sighed.

......

......

After Chu Feng walked out from the Li Heavenly Clan’s Ancestral Formation, he mentioned Li Yue’er’s situation to the Li Heavenly Clansmen.

Upon learning that Li Yue’er had reached the Exalted realm, not only was Li Ruochu overjoyed, but even the Li Heavenly Clan’s elders were wild with joy.

Even if Li Yue’er was inferior to Chu Feng and Linghu Hongfei, she was able to reach the Exalted realm at such a young age. That was enough to show disdain for all the other geniuses of the Ancestral Martial Starfield.

Her future accomplishments would also be inestimable.

If this matter were to be known to others, their Li Heavenly Clan’s status in the Ancestral Martial Starfield would undergo changes too. This was truly an enormously joyous matter for the Li Heavenly Clan.

After Chu Feng informed the Li Heavenly Clan of the good news, it was naturally time for him to return to the Chu Heavenly Clan.

Originally, Chu Feng was planning to return alone. He had planned to return to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm by directly traveling through the Upper Realm Gate.

However, after he learned that the Li Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was planning to accompany him because he wanted to discuss the conflict between their clans, Chu Feng, out of respect, decided to accompany the Li Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, Li Ruochu and Li Taiyi, and return to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm by traveling through the Ancient Era’s Teleportation Formations.

Merely, with that being the case, it would take him much longer to return.

......

Chu Feng and the others were not the only group of people that were proceeding for the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.

The people that first arrived at the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm were from two other Upper Realms.

One of them was the Hong Beast Clan.

The Hong Beast Clansmen had a physical appearance very similar to that of humans.

Merely, the blood flowing through them belonged to that of monstrous beasts. Thus, they were much more robust than ordinary humans. Even the shortest among them were three meters tall. As for the tallest, they were over a dozen meters tall.

Furthermore, all of the Hong Beast Clansmen, regardless of gender, were built very robustly. They possessed rock-solid skin. Furthermore, their skin was entirely red.

As for the other clan, they were the Goldenstone Royal Clan.

The Goldenstone Royal Clansmen had personally been to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm before. They came previously because they were asked by others to take care of Chu Feng.

At that time, although Chu Feng was already able to move about unhindered through the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, he was yet to be recognized by the Chu Heavenly Clan. Furthermore, no one knew that he was Chu Xuanyuan’s son.

However, at the moment when the Goldenstone Royal Clan’s Clan Chief planned to personally attack Chu Feng, Chu Xuanzhengfa rushed over and publicly announced his identity. Furthermore, he gave no face to the Goldenstone Royal Clan, and publicly humiliated their Clan Chief.

Ever since that happened, the Goldenstone Royal Clansmen never again set foot into the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.

However, at that moment, the Goldenstone Royal Clan had set foot into the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm again. It was not only the Goldenstone Royal Clan’s Clan Chief that had arrived. He had also brought many experts of his clan with him.

A majestic army was flying straight for the Chu Heavenly Clan’s territory.

Their appearance had caught the attention of many powers in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.

Many powers even dispatched people to secretly follow them.

The reason for that was because they were all able to tell that the arrival of the Goldenstone Royal Clan and Hong Beast Clan was ill-intended.

There was no need to question the hostility the Goldenstone Royal Clan possessed for the Chu Heavenly Clan. As for the Hong Beast Clan, they were a clan that had frictions with the Chu Heavenly Clan many years ago.

At that time, for the sake of fighting over a treasure, the Hong Beast Clan’s Clan Chief ended up fighting with the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

Ultimately, not only did the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief obtain the treasure, but he even seriously injured the Hong Beast Clan’s Clan Chief.

At that time, the Hong Beast Clan’s Clan Chief had threatened that he would definitely cripple the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief in the future. Furthermore, after he returned to the Hong Beast Clan, he actually really entered closed-door training.

Word of that matter had spread far and wide. Even many people in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm knew about the matter.

Merely, after so many years had passed, there was still no news from the Hong Beast Clan’s Clan Chief. Thus, people had already forgotten about him.

No one would’ve expected the Hong Beast Clan’s Clan Chief to suddenly appear at that moment. Furthermore, he was personally leading their Hong Beast Clan’s army.

At that moment, the Hong Beast Clan’s Clan Chief was standing on top of his warship. He was unleashing his aura without any concealment.

His aura was so powerful that it affected the weather. Before his path, regardless of whether they were people or beasts, or even flowers and trees, all would be affected by his aura.

Many people felt that the situation was extremely bad. The reason for that was because the Hong Beast Clan’s Clan Chief’s current cultivation had reached rank six Exalted.

After he increased his cultivation, he had mustered a large force to come to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. It was very likely that he had come for revenge!!!
