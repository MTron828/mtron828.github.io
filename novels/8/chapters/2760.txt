Chapter 2760 - Uncontainable Killing Intent

“Three sirs, I have something that I wish to discuss with young master Chu Feng. Might it be possible for you all to excuse me?” Xia Yun’er said to Li Xiang and his two companions with a smile on her face and an extremely gentle tone.

Seeing Xia Yun’er acting like this, Li Xiang and his two companions simply melted. How could they dare go against her desire?

“Yes, yes, yes.”

The three of them hurriedly walked into the distance. Perhaps they were truly bewitched by Xia Yun’er, seeing as their legs had grown limp and they were swaying left and right as they walked. It was as if they were intoxicated.

At that moment, Chu Feng felt very helpless. He sighed in his heart that Li Xiang and the others were truly lacking in promise.

“Young master Chu Feng, may I speak with you?” Xia Yun’er said to Chu Feng.

Compared to when she spoke to Li Xiang and the others, the tone that she spoke to Chu Feng with was even gentler.

“Miss Xia is being too courteous. If there’s something you want to tell me, it would be fine to say it directly,” Chu Feng said.

“In that case, let us walk together. I will tell you slowly.”

Xia Yun’er arrived beside Chu Feng as she said those words. Chu Feng did not try to be courteous. Just like that, the two of them began to walk alongside one another, leaving their backs to the crowd.

It must be said, when disregarding other things and only taking their backs into consideration, they did resemble an ideal couple. The two of them suited one another very well.

Seeing this scene, Han Yu started to clench his fists within his sleeves.

He detested Chu Feng so much that his teeth were hurting from all the grinding. He wished that he could eat Chu Feng’s flesh and drink his blood.

It was true that he had met Xia Yun’er several times. He had also chatted with her before. Furthermore, the general atmosphere between them was pretty good.

As for Han Yu, he had fallen in love with Xia Yun’er at first sight. He had decided in his heart that he would obtain her.

He had thought that he had already managed to befriend her, and even possessed a high chance of being able to successfully woo her.

With how confident he was, he was certain that Xia Yun’er would converse with him enthusiastically after she arrived.

At that time, he and Xia Yun’er would become the focus of everyone. He would become the target of envy for countless men.

In fact, he had already been imagining that scene.

Yet, who would’ve expected that when Xia Yun’er descend from the sky, she only bothered to chat with Chu Feng?

Moreover, even now, she did not bother to take a single glance at him. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Most importantly, he had secretly sent voice transmissions to Xia Yun’er several times now, yet he had never received a response from her.

Her attitude was extremely cold and detached.

On the one hand, Xia Yun’er was acting completely cold and detached toward him. Yet, on the other hand, she was acting very enthusiastically toward Chu Feng.

This caused Han Yu, who liked Xia Yun’er and felt that she would become his woman in the future, to feel enormous pain, as if a knife were being twisted in his heart.

That was the reason why he detested Chu Feng so much.

That said, regardless of how displeased he felt, regardless of how much he detested Chu Feng, there was nothing he could do. He could only endure it all.

After all, there were many grand characters present. Even if he wanted to attack and kill Chu Feng, he would have no chance to do so.

En route, Xia Yun’er asked Chu Feng, “Young master Chu Feng, how do you plan to choose later?”

“It would naturally be Buried Spirit Lake,” Chu Feng said. Then, he asked, “Miss Xia, how do you plan to choose?”

“My choice is the same as young master Chu Feng. Might it be possible for me to journey together with you after we ascend the mountain?” Xia Yun’er asked with a smile on her face.

Once she said those words, many of the younger generation’s men began to look to Chu Feng with even greater jealousy and envy in their eyes.

After all, Xia Yun’er was the holy maiden in the hearts of all the young men present.

And now, their holy maiden was actually asking to proceed together with Chu Feng of her own accord.

This was simply something that they would never have imagined even in their dreams.

“Of course you may,” Chu Feng nodded his head welcomingly

Just like that, before countless envious and jealous gazes, Chu Feng and Xia Yun’er continued to chat with one another cheerfully as they followed that Ancient Era’s Serpent Clan’s elder while walking shoulder to shoulder.

After a short period of time passed, that Ancient Era’s Serpent Clan’s elder finally stopped.

The reason for that was because they had arrived at the location where they would be able to choose between two options.

Before them were two paths.

Both paths possessed instructions.

However, the instructions were rather profound. That being said, the people present were all able to tell which path lead to the training formation, and which path lead to the maze formation.,

The reason for that was because the secret to all this had already been revealed to them by that now-deceased Ancient Era’s Serpent Clan’s elder.

Thus, the crowd knew very well what sort of outcome would be at the ends of the two paths.

“Why is it that only members of the younger generation within a hundred years of age are able to enter?!”

At that moment, Elder Xingyi shouted loudly in a very displeased manner.

The reason for that was because there was a restriction to the path leading to the maze. That is, only the people of the younger generation within a hundred years of age were allowed to enter it.

The Starfall Eight Immortals were definitely not people within a hundred years of age. It was not only them, but many of the others present were also not within a hundred years of age.

However, what was the duty of the Starfall Eight Immortals? Their duty was to protect Xia Yun’er.

As for Xia Yun’er, the purpose of her visit was precisely that Buried Spirit Lake.

Yet now, with the situation before them, they would not be able to follow her into the Buried Spirit Lake. Naturally, Elder Xingyi would be displeased,

Not only was he displeased, it could even be said that he was rejecting the rule.

“This is the rule set up by our clan’s Clan Chief. If Elder Xingyi is dissatisfied with this rule, you can choose to leave,” That Ancient Era’s Serpent Clan’s elder said.

“If some sort of accident is to happen to our Holy Daughter, could your Ancient Era’s Serpent Clan possibly take responsibility?” Another elder from the Starfall Eight Immortals asked.

“We will not be able to take responsibility. I will repeat the same words, if you’re scared, you can choose to select the other path. Otherwise, you can choose to leave,” That Ancient Era’s Serpent Clan’s elder said.

Compared to the elder that was killed earlier, this elder’s attitude was very unyielding. Even though his strength was inferior to that of the Starfall Eight Immortals, his gaze was akin to that of a torch; there was no trace of fear in his eyes at all.

“It’s alright, I can take care of myself,” Xia Yun’er said with a smile on her face.

Her words revealed her decision to the Starfall Eight Immortals.

The Starfall Eight Immortals did not go against her decision. Thus, they said no more, so as to respect her decision.

“Young master Han Yu,” Right at that moment, Elder Xingyi looked to Han Yu.

“Senior, this junior is present,” Seeing Elder Xingyi calling for him, Han Yu hurriedly stood forth. His attitude was very respectful.

Had it been someone else that called for him, with the status that Han Yu held in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, he would definitely not react as courteously.

This was not merely a disparity in strength. Most importantly, it was because of Elder Xingyi’s status. After all, he was an expert from the Starfall Holy Land and Xia Yun’er’s bodyguard.

“Young master Han Yu, you’re also planning to enter Buried Spirit Lake, right?” Elder Xingyi asked.

“Yes, that’s correct. This junior is also going to choose to enter the maze formation,” Han Yu said.

“In that case, might it be possible for me to ask young master Han Yu to look after our Holy Daughter?” Elder Xingyi said.

Hearing those words, Han Yu was immediately overjoyed. He thought to himself that the opportunity to approach Xia Yun’er had finally arrived.

However, before Han Yu could answer, Xia Yun’er interrupted, “There’s no need for that. I will be journeying with young master Chu Feng. With young master Chu Feng protecting me, I am definitely going to be fine.”

As Xia Yun’er said those words, she deliberately shot an ambiguous glance at Chu Feng.

With Xia Yun’er saying those words, it would naturally be unsuitable for Han Yu to say that he would look after Xia Yun’er.

Thus, he could only forcibly swallow the words that had reached his throat.

That being said, his heart was already erupting with rage. His anger was akin to magma that was about to erupt out of him. He was nearly unable to control his anger.

Thus, he took a glance at Chu Feng again.

When Chu Feng sensed Han Yu’s gaze, he frowned slightly.

Han Yu’s gaze had changed again.

His murderous desire had grown even stronger. It could be said that he wasn’t even bothering to conceal it anymore.

It was as if he was unable to contain his desire to kill Chu Feng.
