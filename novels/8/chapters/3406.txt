Chapter 3406 - Moving About Unhindered

“Brother Chu Feng, you’ve truly changed your mind?” Linghu Hongfei asked.

The others also had joyous looks on their faces. Even though Chu Feng had threatened them with an extremely strange smile, and causing them to feel very uneasy, they did not believe his words.

As such, they would naturally be feel overjoyed, since Chu Feng was willing to open the gate.

“I, Chu Feng, am always one to honor my words. Since they wish to die, I will help them accomplish their desires.”

“However, it is more important to save my friend. Thus, I will go and gather the Ghost-sealing Grass first,” Chu Feng said.

Hearing that, Linghu Hongfei immediately said, “Let me help you.”

“Brother Linghu, I appreciate your kind intentions. However, I myself am sufficient.”

As Chu Feng spoke, his body shifted. He moved over the mountain peaks and went deep within the grand formation.

Apart from Linghu Hongfei, no one else present knew the situation within the grand formation. However, they knew that going deep within the grand formation would be very dangerous.

“Big brother Hongfei, you should go and follow him to have a look. Whilst his death doesn’t matter, it wouldn’t be good if those spirit formation swords ended up being lost with his death,” Linghu Yueyue said to Linghu Hongfei.

“Since brother Chu Feng insists on going alone, we should respect his wish,” Linghu Hongfei said.

When even Linghu Hongfei said it like that, how could the others find it suitable to say anything else?

That said, many people in the grand formation were feeling worried like Linghu Yueyue.

They were not worried for Chu Feng’s life and death. They merely did not wish for his spirit formation swords to be lost should he end up dying. After all, those spirit formation swords concerned their chances if improving their abilities.

“Woosh~~~”

However, after only a short period of time had passed, a figure leaped back from over the mountain peaks and landed amongst the crowd.

The crowd were all surprised upon seeing them. The reason for that was because that person was Chu Feng, who had just left.

“What’s this? For you to return so quickly, did you discover that you were unable to handle the traps deep within the grand formation, and came to seek our help?” Linghu Tiemian looked at Chu Feng and asked with a mocking expression.

It was not only Linghu Tiemian. Linghu Mingye, Linghu Lun and the others, as well as many of the people outside the grand formation, began to feel contempt toward Chu Feng.

If Chu Feng had accepted Linghu Hongfei’s help from the very beginning, no one would look down on him.

After all, Linghu Hongfei was already so powerful. He was not someone that they could match.

However, Chu Feng had refused Linghu Hongfei’s kind intentions and left with full confidence. Yet, he had returned to seek help. It was truly too disappointing.

“Seek help? From whom? You?”

Chu Feng looked at Linghu Tiemian with contempt, “Someone like you couldn’t even climb the mountains, much less enter the depths of the grand formation.”

“Bullshit! How dare you, someone who came back to seek help, act so arrogant?!” Linghu Tiemian felt enraged.

He admitted that he did not dare to enter the depths of the grand formation. However, Chu Feng was looking down on him too much when he said that he was someone who could not even traverse the mountains.

Right at that moment, Linghu Hongfei spoke, “Tiemian, brother Chu Feng didn’t lie to you. The mountain peaks possess sealing formations. Unless you all possess the method to breach it, you will not be able to traverse the mountains.”

“Ah? But earlier, Chu Feng...”

Linghu Tiemian wanted to say that ‘Chu Feng had clearly leaped over the mountains effortlessly, without breaching any spirit formation at all.’

“Brother Chu Feng is very amazing. He was able to traverse the mountain peaks without breaching any of the spirit formations. I believe that... brother Chu Feng must’ve grasped some sort of unknown mystery of this grand formation, no?” Linghu Hongfei said to Chu Feng.

“You can say it like that,” Chu Feng smiled. Shortly afterward, he said, “I will leave momentarily. Upon my return, I will open the gate.”

“Leave? Where are you going?” Liangqiu Hongyue asked curiously.

“Since I’ve collected the Ghost-sealing Grass, I will naturally have to leave this grand formation,” As Chu Feng spoke, he turned his wrist, and a total of a hundred and thirty blades of Ghost-sealing Grass floated in midair.

Those were not Ghost-sealing Grass created by spirit power. Instead, they were actual Ghost-sealing Grasses.

“This guy, he actually managed to collect so much Ghost-sealing Grass in such a short period of time?”

Seeing the Ghost-sealing Grass that Chu Feng displayed, not to mention the people of the younger generation inside and outside the grand formation, even Liangqiu Chengfeng and the others revealed a surprised look.

Even for them, they would need some time to gather Ghost-sealing Grass inside the grand formation. It was definitely impossible for them to be as astonishingly fast as Chu Feng.

‘Wait, did he just say that he wants to leave the grand formation?’

“What sort of place did you consider this to be? You think that you’ll be able to leave this grand formation just because you want to?”

“Did you think that you were the one who constructed this grand formation? This is a grand formation left behind by the World Spiritist Immortal King!” Linghu Lun spoke with a mocking expression.

“Buzz~~~”

However, before he could even finish all that he wanted to say, Chu Feng pointed to the sky, and a spirit formation gate appeared.

“What did you say just now?” Chu Feng turned around to look at Linghu Lun. He acted as if he hadn’t heard him properly. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“I...” Linghu Lun turned ashen. He was at a loss for words.

He was completely baffled the moment he saw the spirit formation gate.

At that moment, confusion filled his mind.

What was going on with that spirit formation gate? Exactly what was happening?

“It’s alright. Don’t panic. Your big brother Chu Feng will return very soon, and let you all experience what despair means.”

With a smile on his face, Chu Feng’s body shifted, and he leapt into the spirit formation gate.

After Chu Feng entered the spirit formation gate, the spirit formation gate disappeared.

At this moment, all of the younger generations inside and outside the grand formation were astonished.

Even Linghu Yueyue, Tantai Xing’er, the Liangqiu Sisters and Wuma Shengjie, geniuses of their caliber, were completely stupefied with astonishment.

Not only had Chu Feng managed to instantly gather over a hundred Ghost-sealing Grass, but he was even able to move about unhindered through such a powerful grand formation.

Was he still human?

Before Chu Feng’s overwhelming power, even someone like Linghu Hongfei appeared much inferior by comparison.

“Did that guy really leave the grand formation?”

“He’s not deceiving us, right?”

“Furthermore, did he really gather those hundred plus Ghost-sealing Grass just now?”

Linghu Lun asked looking to his left and right. He seemed to hope that someone would tell him that none of it was not real.

There were actually quite a few people acting like Linghu Lun, unable to believe what had happened.

Thus, they were fortunate to not know that, outside the grand formation, a spirit formation gate had appeared before Grandmaster Liangqiu and the others.

Otherwise, they would definitely be deeply frightened.

The reason for that was because Chu Feng had truly accomplished the feat of moving about completely unhindered.
