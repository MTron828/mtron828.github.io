Chapter 2747 - Snake-tailed Woman

“Hehe, Milady Queen, rest assured. I will definitely not be careless this time around,” Chu Feng spoke with confidence.

Then, Chu Feng began to attempt to make his breakthrough. Unfortunately... this time around, Chu Feng failed.

Chu Feng continued to attempt to make a breakthrough three times in a row. However, in the end, he still failed.

Chu Feng determined that he did not possess sufficient comprehension toward the way of martial cultivation. In order to make a breakthrough, he would have to obtain more martial comprehension.

Of course, what Chu Feng had gathered was a vast amount already. Chu Feng felt that even though he had failed in making a breakthrough to rank four True Immortal, he shouldn’t be far from it. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

At that moment, Chu Feng turned his attention to Song Xi.

“Lord Chu Feng, how is Xi-boy doing right now?” Song Xi’s mother asked worriedly.

“Aunt, please rest assured. Although Song Xi is still unconscious, he has managed to smoothly fuse with the inheritance. In a short few days, he will be able to wake up,” Chu Feng said.

Actually, Chu Feng was lying to Song Xi’s mother.

Song Xi’s situation was not optimistic at all. It was a question in itself as to whether or not Song Xi would be able to wake up.

However, Song Xi’s mother would not be able to live for long. Chu Feng wished to allow her to leave at ease.

“That would truly be great,” Sure enough, seeing the serious expression on Chu Feng’s face, Song Xi’s mother grew much less worried.

“Lord Chu Feng, while I have no idea when Xi-boy will be able to wake up, I know that when Xi-boy wakes up, it will be a question in and of itself as to whether or not he will be able to endure the power he has inherited.”

“Naturally, it would be best if he is able to endure it. However, if he is unable to do so, he will definitely become possessed by the devil and become very dangerous.”

“Thus, Lord Chu Feng, I have a presumptuous request. I hope that you do not continue to watch over Xi-boy. Instead, you should leave this place.”

“Here, take this.”

Song Xi’s mother handed the key to open the gate, the two banners that could get rid of a portion of the restriction from the Sacred Mountain and that Cosmos Sack to Chu Feng.

“Aunt, what are you doing?” Chu Feng asked.

“Lord Chu Feng, I beg of you, I do not wish for Xi-boy to harm you.”

“Thus, please return here after a year. If Xi-boy is able to withstand the inheritance, he will definitely still be alive after a year’s time.”

“However, if he is unable to withstand it, you will be able to bury him then,” Song Xi’s mother said.

“Very well, Aunt, I’ll do that,” Chu Feng accepted the key and the little banners. However, Chu Feng did not accept the Cosmos Sack.

“Lord Chu Feng, please take that too. It will be useful to you,” Song Xi’s mother said.

“Aunt, I’m not going to take that,” Chu Feng shook his head. He was determined in his refusal.

If Song Xi really ended up dying, Chu Feng would use the contents of the Cosmos Sack. Chu Feng was not that stubborn.

However, as Song Xi was still alive, Chu Feng would not touch the Cosmos Sack.

“Alas, Xi-boy is truly fortunate to encounter a good person like you.”

Song Xi’s mother was so moved that she started to shed silent tears. From how Chu Feng refused the Cosmos Sack, she was able to tell that Chu Feng was truly thinking for Song Xi’s sake, that he truly had considered Song Xi as his friend.

After four hours passed, Song Xi’s mother grew weaker and weaker.

Chu Feng knew that her due time had arrived, that she would soon die.

Song Xi’s mother also noticed this. Thus, she got into Song Xi’s father’s coffin.

Not long after, Song Xi’s mother lost all breath.

Chu Feng set up a spirit formation on Song Xi’s mother. That spirit formation would allow the corpse of Song Xi’s mother to remain the same, and not decompose.

After that, Chu Feng stayed here for several more days. From time to time, Chu Feng would set up spirit formations around Song Xi to help him.

However, it remained that it would be dependent on Song Xi himself. Chu Feng would not be able to do much to help him.

That being said, Chu Feng still did all he could to help him.

It was only when Chu Feng determined he could not stay there anymore, as he needed to proceed for the Spirit Formation Immortal Domain, that he left.

......

Spirit Formation Immortal Domain. As its name implied, that place was most definitely a sacred place for world spiritists.

However, as the Spirit Formation Immortal Domain was currently guarded by the Ancient Era’s Serpent Clan, it was not a place where anyone could come and go at will.

As such, there were not a lot of people in the vicinity of the Spirit Formation Immortal Domain.

Furthermore, for the sake of not missing out on the occasion, those with invitation title plates would generally proceed for the Spirit Formation Immortal Domain ahead of time.

Very few people would rush over right around the time like Chu Feng did. Thus, Chu Feng encountered very few people on his way there.

It was only when Chu Feng was about to reach the Spirit Formation Immortal Domain that he encountered a group of people.

They were three men and a woman. At that moment, they were all inside a concealment formation.

While that concealment formation was the work of an Insect Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, Chu Feng was still able to see through it with a single glance.

Chu Feng was able to clearly see everything happening inside the concealment formation.

Of those three men, two were rather skinny, and the other was rather fat. They all possessed very ordinary appearances. That said, they were not very old. They were all younger generations under a hundred years of age.

As for their cultivations, they were all rank one True Immortals.

Although their ages were quite old when compared to Chu Feng, it remained that few people in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm would be able to reach the True Immortal realm within a hundred years.

From this, it could be seen that those three men were all extraordinary individuals.

In fact, they were indeed extraordinary individuals.

Not only were they all wearing exquisite clothing, but there were also identical title plates on their waists -- Sacred Pellet Villa.

Chu Feng had heard of the Sacred Pellet Villa from the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master. That was a power equally as famous as the Immortal Armament Villa.

Merely, the Immortal Armament Villa was renowned throughout the world because of their weaponry refinement abilities, whereas the Sacred Pellet Villa was renowned throughout the world for their various medicinal pellet conconcting abilities.

The Sacred Pellet Villa possessed outstanding fame. They were known to be a righteous power in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.

However, those three geniuses from the Sacred Pellet Villa were doing something evil.

At that moment, not only were the three of them beating up that woman, they were also insulting her to their heart’s content.

That woman was very scared and curled up on the ground. Even though she was being beaten and insulted, she did not dare to say anything.

As Chu Feng approached, he was able to clearly see that the woman was very young. Rather than calling her a young woman, it would be more accurate to call her a child. She seemed to only be twelve or thirteen years old.

She had very fair skin. While her face could not be said to be very beautiful, her features were very clean and neat.

Most importantly, Chu Feng noticed that she did not have any legs. Instead of legs, she had a three-meter-long snake tail.

She was actually a monstrous beast from the Serpent Clan.

Chu Feng was unable to tolerate the strong bullying the weak. Thus, upon seeing this, he immediately shouted, “Stop!”

Hearing the shout, those three men from the Sacred Pellet Villa were all startled.

Evidently, they were panicking upon having their malicious deeds discovered by another.

After all, they had already set up a concealment formation around them. Subconsciously, they felt that the person that was able to see through their concealment formation would be stronger than them.

However, when they turned their eyes up and discovered that it was Chu Feng standing in the sky, the panic on their faces not only rapidly disappeared, but they even revealed extremely displeased expressions in their eyes.
