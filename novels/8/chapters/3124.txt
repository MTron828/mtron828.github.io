Chapter 3124 - Trust Chu Feng

Chu Feng had only said those words as a sigh of disappointment, and was not targeting anyone specifically. However, Chu Hongyi became extremely displeased upon hearing those words. He pointed at Chu Feng and asked angrily, “Chu Feng, what are you trying to imply here?!”

“What am I trying to imply?” Chu Feng smiled, “I’ve heard that our Chu Heavenly Clan had been to the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm’s Overlord Region. However, now, not only have we withdrawn to the Eastern Region, but even our territory has been seized by others. Yet you’re asking me what I’m implying?”

“You’re implying that we are useless? Very well, if you have the ability, why don’t you go and retrieve our Chu Heavenly Clan’s territory?” Chu Hongyi pointed at Chu Feng.

“I, Chu Feng, will do that even without you telling me to do so,” Chu Feng said.

“What arrogant claims. Who do you think you are?” Chu Hongyi chuckled coldly. Then, he said to the crowd, “Everyone, you’ve all witnessed it. These few people that have just come not only look down on me, Chu Hongyi, but they are also looking down on everyone here.”

“As the saying goes, people walking different paths cannot make plans together. Since they look down on us like this, it means that they possess capabilities themselves. As such, there is no need for us to bring them along with us to find the Immortal River.”

“Thus, everyone, follow me. As for them, let us not concern ourselves with them,” Chu Hongyi ridiculed.

Chu Hongyi’s words were immediately acknowledged by the crowd.

They did not feel the slightest bit of shame from Chu Feng’s words. Instead, they were angered by Chu Feng’s words, and began to feel resentment toward him.

“Wait,” however, right when the crowd was planning to leave with Chu Hongyi, Chu Feng said, “I, Chu Feng, do not care about what sort of decision you all make. However, as fellow members of the Chu Heavenly Clan, I must tell you all this.”

“According to my observation, an Immortal River will indeed appear at the direction that Chu Hongyi indicated. However, that Immortal River is too small. Rather than calling it a river, it would be more accurate to call it a stream. If you all are to enter it and train together, you will obtain a very small amount of benefits.”

“However, an undercurrent will appear deep underground in the northeastern region of our Chu Heavenly Clan’s territory. That undercurrent contains an enormous amount of cultivation resources.”

“If you all are willing, you can follow me. I can lead everyone to the undercurrent,” Chu Feng said.

However, upon hearing Chu Feng’s words, the crowd not only did not reveal any sign of joy, but instead started to frown. They were all questioning Chu Feng’s claim. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Am I mishearing things? You’re telling us that you’re capable of finding an undercurrent?”

“Who the hell do you think you are? Do you think that you’re an Exalt-cloak World Spiritist?” Chu Hongyi pointed at Chu Feng and mocked.

Once Chu Hongyi said those words, the crowd all shook their heads. It would appear that they were thinking the same thing as Chu Hongyi, and simply did not believe in Chu Feng at all.

However, their reaction was understandable too. After all, they had trained there for so long, and knew that the Immortal River’s undercurrents hiding deep underground contained even more natural energies.

However, one simply could not find an undercurrent without sufficient strength. According to their understanding, one must be at least an Exalted-cloak World Spiritist to find an undercurrent. Otherwise, one simply would not be able to detect where an undercurrent might be.

Chu Feng did not bother to answer the crowd’s questions.

Chu Feng was, after all, a human. He was not a virtuous sage. He was also someone who would become angry.

Faced with the crowd’s disbelief, he was truly disinclined to bother to provide an explanation.

After all, it would be they themselves who would end up suffering should they not believe in him.

“Chu Ping, what are your plans? You couldn’t possibly really believe that Chu Feng is capable of bringing you to an undercurrent, right?” Chu Hongyi looked to Chu Ping.

“Hongyi, little brother Chu Feng has just arrived here. He still does not understand this place well. Thus, we should...” Chu Ping naturally did not believe in Chu Feng. He merely wanted to urge Chu Feng to reconsider things.

“I, Chu Hongyi, will absolutely not bring those that do not trust me to the Immortal River. As for you, do what you want,” Chu Hongyi soared into the sky after saying those words and began flying southwest.

Following him, the others present also soared into the sky and began flying after Chu Hongyi. In the blink of an eye, they all disappeared in the southwest.

At that moment, the only people that still stood on the stage were Chu Feng, Chu Qing, Chu Haoyan, Chu Huanyu, Chu Shuangshaung and Chu Ping.

Actually, Chu Feng was surprised to discover that Chu Haoyan and Chu Huanyu had decided to follow him. It did not matter if it might be because of self-interest or cultivation resources, it was still surprising.

However, Chu Feng was not someone who held grudges. Thus, he did not make things difficult for Chu Haoyan and Chu Huanyu.

“Little brother Chu Feng, you all truly do not know about the importance of the Immortal River. You really shouldn’t miss this opportunity. Although Chu Hongyi has a violent temperament, he is still thinking for our sake. Thus, as long as you all go and apologize to him, he will definitely...” Chu Ping was still trying to urge Chu Feng and the others to follow Chu Hongyi.

“Big brother Chu Ping, there is no need for you to say those words anymore. You merely need to follow me,” as Chu Feng spoke, he soared into the sky. Chu Qing, Chu Haoyan and Chu Huanyu also soared into the sky after Chu Feng.

“Shuangshuang, you should try to persuade little brother Chu Feng and the others,” Chu Ping said to Chu Shuangshuang.

However, Chu Shuangshuang only smiled at Chu Ping’s words. She said, “Big brother Chu Ping, just follow us. Rather than trusting that Chu Hongyi, I’d urge you to trust little brother Chu Feng. After all... he will give you a pleasant surprise.”

After she finished saying those words, Chu Shuangshuang also soared into the sky and followed Chu Feng.

At that moment, Chu Ping was completely bewildered. In the end, he decided to soar into the sky and follow Chu Shuangshuang; follow Chu Feng.
