Chapter 5747: A True God

“Why not? This is Brother Chu Feng’s residence,” Xianhai Shaoyu said with a smile.

Long Chengyu dared not to say anything, but he nodded in agreement.

“My words count too.” Little Fishy arrogantly placed her hands on her waist, but her expression was not detestable. If anything, it looked adorable. She looked at Chu Feng with a radiant smile and asked, “Big brother, do my words count?”

“Of course,” Chu Feng replied. He looked at the crowd with feigned authority and said, “Little Fishy’s words count here.”

“I support Little Fishy too!” Xian Miaomiao remarked with a chuckle. She looked at Long Muxi and said, “Miss Muxi, you should stay here with us too.”

“Well…” Long Muxi hesitantly nodded. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Wonderful! It’ll be fun to have big sister Muxi with us!” Little Fishy skipped in excitement.

“I want to join the bustle too. This isn’t fair,” Long Chengyu murmured, but he dared not to say it too loudly out of fear of Little Fishy.

“Ey, Brother Chu Feng. I am envious of you. I’d have liked to stay here with you, but I have other matters to attend to.” Liu Kuo then turned to Little Fishy and remarked, “Benefactor, I’m actually skilled in the art of transformation too, so I can turn into a woman too.”

“…”

The crowd was rendered speechless.

“Just to add on, benefactors, the training grounds in your residences will open every night, but only one person can enter each training ground. You’re free to stay here during the day, but I’d advise you to return to your residence to cultivate at night. The effects of our cultivation ground vary from person to person. You’re talented individuals. It’ll be a waste to miss this opportunity. It’s not every day you get to visit the Nine Heavens’ Zenith,” Liu Kuo said as he prepared to take his leave.

Just then, Feng Ling asked, “When will the Nine Heavens’ Zenith commence?”

“To be honest, I don’t know either. It depends on the will of the Nine Heavens’ Zenith, though the trial should begin soon since all of you are here,” Liu Kuo replied before leaving.

Chu Feng and the others continued chatting after Liu Kuo left. They could tell that there was something special about the cultivation ground judging from what Liu Kuo said, so they returned to their respective residences at nightfall.

“Qilin, did you see that? My cultivation is still lacking compared to the others. How long will it take for you to assimilate the dragon essence and raise my cultivation?” Chu Feng asked the Heaven-devouring Qilin.

There was no answer from the latter.

In fact, Chu Feng had raised this matter multiple times in the past two days, but the Heaven-devouring Qilin never answered him. It was as if it had fallen dead.

“Is it unable to speak because it is focusing on assimilating the dragon essence?” Chu Feng thought.

He decided not to badger the Heaven-devouring Qilin for the time being and make his way to the cultivation ground.

The Nine Heavens’ Zenith’s cultivation grounds were small, existing as pools in the participants’ residences, spanning the size of a bath. They were filled with not water but runes.

The formation was already active by the time Chu Feng arrived. Runes of different colors drifted inside the pool like fireflies. He stepped into the pool.

“This feeling…”

Chu Feng soon noticed something.

The cultivation ground was divided into three layers.

The first layer was to drive the formation to boost one’s cultivation speed. Its effects were decent, but it was not enough for one to make a breakthrough within a short period of time.

The second layer required a deeper level of understanding. Those who comprehended the runes in the pool and rearranged them could obtain a greater amount of power.

The third layer was to break down a barrier, though this was not easy to pull off. Even Chu Feng would take some time to achieve it despite his intelligence.

Chu Feng easily reached the second layer. Not only was he able to rearrange the runes, but he was able to do so in many ways. Based on what he had observed, the formation best supported the cultivation of world spirits.

“Elder Kui Ting, I’ll draw the formation’s power into my World Spirit Space. I’d like you to try to make a breakthrough to True God level via it,” Chu Feng said.

He could have potentially made a breakthrough if he used this power for himself, but he was currently too weak that it was unlikely he could stand his ground in the Nine Heavens’ Zenith even if he made a breakthrough.

In contrast, if he could raise the Asura King’s cultivation to True God level, he could tower above the others. Even a rank nine Half-God level cultivator raising their cultivation by three ranks would only have an advantage against Half-God level cultivators; it wasn’t enough to bridge the gap with a True God level cultivator.

No juniors here could match a True God level cultivator, and the Asura King was a step away from True God level after assimilating the origin energies Chu Feng had previously given him.

“Milord, I’m ready,” the Asura King replied.

Chu Feng rearranged the runes in the pool to convert the energy to boost the cultivation of world spirits. He drew the energy into his World Spirit Space, supplying it for the Asura King’s cultivation.

This continued for the entire night. Right before daybreak, the Asura King successfully made a breakthrough to True God level.

“Lord Chu Feng, I have made a breakthrough!” the Asura King exclaimed.

Even though he was only a step away from reaching True God level, it was unlikely he could have made a breakthrough anytime soon if not for the support of the formation. It was thanks to Chu Feng that he made a breakthrough to True God level.

“Elder, you need not thank me. I benefit greatly from your breakthrough to True God level too.”

Chu Feng was also overjoyed, knowing that he could easily deal with the other juniors now that the Asura King had reached True God level. A world spiritist’s world spirits were considered as part of their strength too.

It was also around then that the formation deactivated on its own accord.

“Hm?” Chu Feng noticed that someone was waiting at his residence’s entrance.

It was Wang Qiang.

He quickly headed to the entrance and brought Wang Qiang in. He was dying to know what had happened to the latter.

Wang Qiang hung his head in shame upon seeing Chu Feng, saying, “Brother, I-I-I-I’m sorry. Actually, I heard about what happened to you, b-b-but I was unable to head over and help you.”

“Don’t say that, brother. I should be the one apologizing,” Chu Feng replied.

He proceeded to tell Wang Qiang about how he had met Zhao Hong, and the latter was kidnapped by a group of mysterious people.

Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong had gotten together at the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, and the three of them had intended to ascend to the Upper Realm together. However, they were separated on the way.

Wang Qiang greatly missed Zhao Hong; Chu Feng could sense it the last time he met Wang Qiang at the Void Sacred Tree. Yet, he failed to protect Zhao Hong well.

“T-t-t-to think such a thing happened. Brother, i-i-i-it’s not your fault. I-I-I believe that the world will treat my wife kindly, a-a-and nothing bad will happen to her,” Wang Qiang said.

“I also hope that Zhao Hong will be fine too. The two of you deserve a happy life together. Brother, you have already heard about my affairs, but I still know nothing about you. Come, tell me what’s happened to you,” Chu Feng said.

He was curious to know how Wang Qiang came to join the Divine Body Heavenly Mansion, as well as the situation concerning the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted. He was hesitant to directly ask the question, as he didn’t know whether the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted was still inside his body.

“Haa, I-I-I was gullible. Y-y-you warned me about the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted, t-t-telling me to be wary of him. You were right. T-t-that old thing had bad intentions! H-h-he was envious of my good physique and w-w-wanted to take over my body! L-l-lucky I wasn’t a pushover.

“It was tough, b-b-but with my wits, I-I-I worked with Zhang Yanfeng and his siblings and got rid of t-t-that old thing!” Wang Qiang explained.

The Blood-devouring Demon Exalted brought Wang Qiang, Zhang Yanfeng, Zhang Boyi, Zhang Shirui, and the others to the Divine Body Galaxy, intending to make a move on Wang Qiang. However, Wang Qiang and the others saw through his ploy and worked together to get rid of the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.

It was just that they paid a heavy price for that. They sustained severe injuries and were unconscious for a long time. They were later saved by the Divine Body Heavenly Mansion.

The Divine Body Heavenly Mansion noticed that they had potential, especially Wang Qiang with his Divine Body, so they forcefully took them in. They treated them well, but they also imposed strict restrictions on them, especially concerning their freedom.

Wang Qiang wouldn’t have been able to leave the Divine Body Heavenly Mansion at all if not for the Nine Heavens’ Zenith.

“T-t-t-that’s what happened, brother. My current cultivation method is a bit special, so I-I-I’ll have to head back to cultivate now. I-I-I’ll see you soon!” Wang Qiang said.

There were still a lot of things Chu Feng wanted to tell Wang Qiang, but he could only let him leave since he needed to cultivate. Right after Wang Qiang left, a voice echoed in Chu Feng’s ears, ”Chu Feng, I can still sense the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted’s aura.”
