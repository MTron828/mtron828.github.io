Chapter 3783 - Coincidental Encounter?

Void Cleanse Monastery. Their exploration of the remnant was rather laid-back. Because of that, the elders were allowed to leave at will.

After Chu Feng left, Song Ge also left the Ancient Era’s remnant.

That said, Song Ge could be considered to be a celebrity in the Void Cleanse Monastery.

As such, it was very easy for Chu Feng to ask where Song Ge went.

There was a city near the Seven Suns Mountain Range. Song Ge was currently inside that city.

Although the area around the Seven Suns Mountain Range was very vast, the vastness differed according to the individual. With Chu Feng’s cultivation, he would be able to reach the Seven Suns Mountain Range in a very short period of time.

Thus, in merely an instant, Chu Feng had arrived at the city after leaving the remnant.

Although the city was vast, it was unable to escape Chu Feng’s discerning eyes, and Chu Feng soon discovered Song Ge.

Chu Feng was able to see that she was currently with a young woman. That woman was also a female elder of the Void Cleanse Monastery. Coincidentally, Chu Feng happened to know that woman too.

She was Aunty Liu’s daughter, Wang Lian.

Song Ge and Wang Lian were not the only people present. There were also other people with them.

There were of both genders. Most of them were men. Furthermore, they all wore gorgeous clothes. It seemed like they were all from wealthy families.

Those people were not from the Void Cleanse Monastery. Instead, they were from a different sect.

Those people must’ve encountered Song Ge accidentally. Several of the men from that group revealed extraordinarily favorable impressions towards Song Ge.

Those people were currently inviting her to enjoy some tea at a teahouse. However, Song Ge didn’t want to enjoy tea with them.

Although she was uninterested, Wang Lian revealed deep interest, and was trying hard to urge Song Ge to go.

From the expression in Wang Lian’s eyes, Chu Feng was able to tell that she was not at all interested in enjoying tea in the teahouse. Instead, she was interested in the men.

Although those men were completely worthless in terms of strength and status for someone like Chu Feng, they were optimal spouse candidates for someone like Wang Lian.

In fact, if Wang Lian was able to get together with any one of those men, she would be climbing the social ladder.

Although Wang Lian had acted extremely arrogant and proud when she met Chu Feng previously, she was extremely eager and attentive toward those men.

Although Song Ge was very cold towards those men, she found it difficult to refuse Wang Lian.

At that moment, Song Ge had entered a very difficult predicament.

Chu Feng knew that it was time for him to step onto the stage.

Thus, he walked out of the shadows and deliberately walked past Song Ge, pretending it was an accidental encounter.

“Asura?”

Sure enough, with Chu Feng’s deliberation, Song Ge soon discovered him.

After all, Chu Feng was Song Ge’s savior.

On top of that, he had chatted with her about many things after saving her. Thus, Song Ge, who felt extremely grateful towards Chu Feng to begin with, had a much more favorable impression of him.

After seeing Chu Feng, Song Ge was not only beaming with happiness, but she even took several rapid steps and ran over to him.

“What a coincidence. Never would I have imagined that I’d meet you here,” Song Ge said whilst smiling like a blooming flower after seeing Chu Feng.

“It is indeed a coincidence.” Chu Feng revealed a pleasantly surprised look.

“Who is that person?”

When those men who were fond of Song Ge saw Chu Feng, they all started frowning. Displeasure was clearly visible in their eyes.

They’d been trying so hard to befriend Song Ge earlier. Yet, they were only met with her contempt.

However, when she saw Chu Feng, she immediately turned into a completely different person. This caused them great envy and displeasure.

“Why would it be him?”

At the moment when the men were sizing Chu Feng up, Wang Lian also turned her gaze to Chu Feng.

She didn’t have to examine him, because she recognized who he was the instant she saw him.

“Elder Wang Lian, you know that person?” Those men asked Wang Lian.

“I wouldn’t say that I know him.”

In Wang Lian’s eyes, Chu Feng was a shameless and despicable person. However, that was not what was important. Most importantly, she felt that Chu Feng was nothing more than trash.

Because of that, she felt that he was unqualified to even know her.

Thus, she found it beneath her to tell others that she knew him.

Although she was unwilling to admit that she knew Chu Feng, she was very curious as to how he and Song Ge knew one another.

Thus, she arrived before them.

“Song Ge, how do you know him?” Wang Lian asked Song Ge.

“Wang Lian, that would be a long story. I will tell you when there’s time,” Song Ge said to Wang Lian.

After hearing Song Ge’s words, Wang Lian glared fiercely at Chu Feng. Then, she pulled Song Ge behind her and pointed her finger at Chu Feng. With a threatening tone, she said, “Let me tell you this! From today on, keep your distance from Song Ge! Otherwise, don’t blame me for becoming impolite with you!”

“Wang Lian, what are you doing?” Seeing that Wang Lian was actually speaking to her benefactor in such a manner, Song Ge felt displeased.

“Song Ge, I’ve met that person before. He is not a good individual. Don’t be deceived by him,” Wang Lian said to Song Ge.

“What nonsense are you spouting?” Song Ge was completely baffled.

In her impression, Chu Feng was her benefactor, and an exceptional genius.

How could he be a swindler?

“Elder Song Ge, Elder Wang Lian, is something the matter?”

Right at that moment, those men and women all gathered around.

Among them, the few men with the highest cultivations and greatest interest in Song Ge began to size up Chu Feng with extremely ill-intended gazes.

“There’s no issue. He’s my friend," Song Ge hurriedly explained.

“Friend? Elder Song Ge’s friend must not be an ordinary individual. Brother, may I know which sect’s elder you might be?”

The men looked to Chu Feng strangely.

“I belong to no sect. My name is Asura," said Chu Feng.

“What? Asura? Hahaha...”

“What’s this, you’re an Asura World Spiritist? If I’m not mistaken, brother Asura must be an Asura World Spiritist, right?” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Otherwise, why would you be named Asura?”

“Everyone, am I not right? Hahaha...”

“Right, right, right. Hahaha...”

Suddenly, the crowd started laughing heartily. Even Wang Lian laughed with them.

Seeing that, Chu Feng revealed a faint smile.

Those people were laughing because they were ridiculing him.

Chu Feng was smiling because he was also ridiculing them for how ignorant they were.

“Well then, Elder Song Ge, it’s a rare encounter for us to meet. It’s better that we go to the Cyan Bamboo Teahouse to enjoy some tea together.”

“Right. I’ve heard that the Cyan Bamboo Teahouse has introduced several rare teas recently. Those teas are all the best of the best.”

“Furthermore, they’ve found an extremely beautiful Natural Oddity. It would be great for us to go there and check it out.”

“Elder Song Ge, you should know about the Cyan Bamboo Teahouse, no? The shopkeeper of the Cyan Bamboo Teahouse is a Martial Immortal-level expert. His teahouse is renowned for its unique performances.”

“Enjoying tea in the Cyan Bamboo Teahouse is not something that just anyone can do.”

“This is especially true today. The Cyan Bamboo Teahouse has hired an extremely marvelous Natural Oddity to sing and dance there. Because of that, it’s completely packed, and extremely difficult to get a seat.”

The men began to persuade Song Ge once again.

However, Song Ge showed absolutely no interest.

It was instead Chu Feng who asked, “If it’s that difficult to enter the teahouse, how are we supposed to enter it?”

Chu Feng deliberately asked that question. After all, the words spoken by those men earlier served merely as a setup so that they could show off to Song Ge.

Unfortunately, Song Ge did not react the way they hoped because she was uninterested.

Chu Feng, on the other hand, was feeling mischievous. He wanted to see how they were planning to show off.
