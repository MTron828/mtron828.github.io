Chapter 4222 - Visiting The Red-dress Holy Land

“The Celestial Master’s Sacred Sect was also a power that contained numerous powerful world spiritists.”

“The Celestial Master’s Sacred Sect was extremely powerful. In the past, their name had shaken the entire vast martial cultivation world.”

“During that time they were an existence on par with the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion,” said Grandmaster Tang Chen.

“On par with the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion?”

Chu Feng felt extremely shocked upon hearing those words.

Even though he knew that the Celestial Master’s Sacred Sect would possess extraordinary strength, he never would have imagined them to be that powerful, so powerful as to be on par with the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.

Wouldn’t that mean that the Celestial Master’s Sacred Sect was a power that stood at the apex of the vast martial cultivation world?

“That’s not all. I’ve heard that the Celestial Master’s Sacred Sect was also located in the Seven Realms Galaxy.”

“But, as the saying goes, a mountain can’t have two tigers.”

“There could only be a single overlord of the Seven Realms Galaxy.”

“There could only be a single power that held the reputation of being the strongest gathering of world spiritists in the entire martial cultivation world.”

“Because of that, a war between the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion and the Celestial Master’s Sacred Sect was inevitable.”

“We all know what the result of their war was. The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion emerged victorious. They became the overlord of the Seven Realms Galaxy, and became the world spiritist power that held the most prestige in the entire martial cultivation world.”

“As for the Celestial Master’s Sacred Sect, they disappeared from the vast martial cultivation world.”

“Of course, those are merely things that I’ve heard from others. The Seven Realms Galaxy is so far away. This old man has never been there either. I’ve heard about all this from a grandmaster world spiritist that came from another galaxy.”

“But, that grandmaster world spiritist was not someone to blurt nonsense. Because of that, this old man feels that this matter is most likely true,” said Grandmaster Tang Chen.

“Never would I have imagined my Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk to possess such a grand origin.” Chu Feng was overjoyed.

“Indeed. If this item is truly a treasure from the Celestial Master’s Sacred Sect, its value would be beyond measure.” Grandmaster Tang Chen gasped with admiration.

There was a slight amount of hesitation in his tone.

He was unable to ascertain if Chu Feng’s Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk was truly a treasure from the Celestial Master’s Sacred Sect.

The reason why he was unable to be certain, afraid to be certain even, was because the Celestial Master’s Sacred Sect was simply too powerful.

A treasure from a power of that caliber could not possibly be so easily obtainable.

Afterwards, Chu Feng chatted with Grandmaster Tang Chen and Yuan Shu.

After making plans to accompany them to the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain some time later, Chu Feng went and brought over Yu Ting.

Chu Feng arranged for Yu Ting to rest in the Seven Suns Mountain Range. As for himself, he proceeded for the Red-dress Holy Land.

Chu Feng had obtained the Reincarnation Pearl.

The Reincarnation Pearl was capable of helping Zhao Hong attain complete fusion with the Reincarnation Divine Body.

As such, Chu Feng wanted to quickly deliver the Reincarnation Pearl to her.

When he arrived outside the Red-dress Holy Land, he sighed emotionally.

When he had been there last time, he had just so happened to see Yin Zhuanghong being forcibly brought away.

At that time, Chu Feng and the Red-dress Holy Land had both been powerless to do anything.

In fact, Chu Feng would not be able to contend against that power even with his current strength.

“Sigh...”

After sighing, Chu Feng’s appearance changed.

He had disguised himself as Asura.

After all, his identity as Chu Feng was not known to the majority of the people from the Red-dress Holy Land.

Asura, on the other hand, was someone who held a special status in the Red-dress Holy Land.

Thus, when Chu Feng entered the Red-dress Holy Land as Asura, not only did no one stop him, he was instead received hospitably.

Even the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster Han Xiu personally came out to receive him.

“Asura, you left that day with injuries. We were very worried then.”

“Seeing that you’re fine, we’re finally able to put our hearts at ease.”

Han Xiu seemed to be blaming herself slightly when she said those words.

After all, Chu Feng had only been injured back then because he had tried to rescue Yin Zhuanghong.

“Senior, speaking of it I must thank you,” said Chu Feng.

“Thank me?”

“Why do you need to thank me?”

Han Xiu was confused by Chu Feng thanking her.

“That day when we were outside the Purple Star Hall, if it wasn’t for senior stopping them, my clan might’ve suffered a calamity,” said Chu Feng.

“Purple Star Hall?”

Han Xiu’s expression changed upon hearing those words. She carefully stared at Chu Feng.

She seemed to have realized something. But, she was still somewhat confused.

“Senior,” as Chu Feng spoke, his appearance began changing back to the appearance of Chu Feng.

“Chu Feng?”

Han Xiu was immediately shocked to see the change in Chu Feng’s appearance, so much so that she stood up from her seat abruptly.

“Senior, back then this junior was afraid of implicating my clan. That is why I had disguised myself whilst I was out. My true identity is Chu Feng,” said Chu Feng.

“In other words, you were the one causing havoc amongst the people of the Purple Star Hall?” asked Han Xiu. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“I am ashamed. It is indeed this junior,” Chu Feng said with an embarrassed smile.

“So it was you.”

“Thus, Lady Zhao Hong already knows your true identity?” asked Han Xiu.

“Mn.” Chu Feng nodded.

“No wonder. No wonder Lady Zhao Hong told me to befriend the Chu Heavenly Clan,” Han Xiu came to a sudden realization.

“Thus, kiddo, your strength has advanced by leaps and bounds again, right?”

“Your strength has already surpassed mine, no?”

Han Xiu’s expression had grown marvelous as she looked at Chu Feng.

Back in the Purple Star Hall, Chu Feng’s performance had stunned everyone.

That scene was still vivid in Han Xiu’s mind.

“Hehe. I’ve incurred ridicule through my poor performance.”

Chu Feng’s smile confirmed Han Xiu’s questions.

“Boy, you are truly a monster.”

Whilst Han Xiu was astonished, she was also smiling joyously.

Even though she already knew that Chu Feng possessed heaven-defying talent, she had not anticipated Chu Feng’s speed of progress to be so fast.

“Senior, where’s Zhao Hong?” asked Chu Feng.

After having a casual conversation with Han Xiu, Chu Feng could not forget his purpose for going to the Red-dress Holy Land.

“Lady Zhao Hong is here. Speaking of it, it is truly a coincidence too. Lady Zhao Hong has just exited her closed-door training. If you want to see her, I can bring you to her.”

Han Xiu was extremely happy. As she spoke, she immediately opened the palace entrance and started leading the way for Chu Feng.

Soon, Chu Feng followed Han Xiu to a forbidden area within the Red-dress Holy Land.

There was a palace hall. That was where Zhao Hong was undergoing closed-door training.

The palace had not only been constructed with strength and security, it was also guarded by protective formations.

“Lady Zhao Hong, Chu Feng is here.”

Han Xiu did not rashly set foot into the palace. Instead, she called out to Zhao Hong.

She called for Zhao Hong several times, yet did not receive a response.

Chu Feng realized that something was amiss. He immediately activated his Heaven’s Eyes to carefully examine the palace.

Under his Heaven’s Eyes, the spirit formations disappeared, and the walls also became transparent. The scene within the palace entered Chu Feng’s eyes.

But, upon seeing the scene inside the palace, Chu Feng’s expression changed enormously.

“Bang---”

Chu Feng raised his leg and abruptly kicked open the tightly closed palace gate.

Han Xiu was confused by Chu Feng’s action.

However, once she saw the scene inside the palace, her complexion turned deathly pale. She was completely horrified!
