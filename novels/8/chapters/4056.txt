Chapter 4056 - Situation Turning Bad

These were not the only things that Chu Feng was feeling emotional about. There was another thing.

Chu Feng had defeated the Wuming Clan, and had made his Chu Heavenly Clan become the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s overlord.

Although he did not think this to be extremely amazing, as he knew that his father had long been able to accomplish this. Not only could have accomplished it, he could do it even better and in a way that was even more worthy of admiration should he have wanted to.

Nevertheless, Chu Feng still felt slightly proud of his accomplishment.

After all, making the Chu Heavenly Clan the overlord of the Ancestral Martial Starfield could be said to have been one of the missions his father had tasked him with.

His completion of this mission could also be considered as him having accomplished one of their Chu Heavenly Clan’s old ancestor’s final wishes.

“Chu Feng, what are you thinking about all by yourself?”

The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief’s voice sounded all of a sudden.

Chu Feng turned around and saw that it was not only the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief that was present. Chu Hanpeng, Chu Xuanzhengfa and other familiar faces were also present.

“Lord Clan Chief, what brought you all here?”

“If you’re out here, how is the feast supposed to continue? Wouldn’t it come to an end?” Chu Feng asked with a smile.

“That’s not important. None of that is important.”

“What’s most important is you...”

“Chu Feng, your return this time... how long will you be able to stay in the clan?” asked the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

“I’ve actually returned this time so that I can lift Big Sister Liluo’s curse.”

“However, she said that i should not disturb her whilst she is undergoing closed-door training.”

“Thus, I’ll wait a bit.”

“I’ll try to wait for her to come out from her closed-door training.”

“Besides, don’t we have to proceed for the Purple Star Hall?” said Chu Feng.

“Chu Feng, Miss Liluo’s curse is no small matter.”

“It is indeed something that should be lifted as soon as possible. Otherwise, it could very possibly cause danger to her life.”

“To both you and our Chu Heavenly Clan, that is indeed the most important matter right now.”

“The meeting of the Purple Star Hall is trivial in comparison.”

“You don’t have to accompany me there. It’s better that you stay and wait for Miss Liluo to come out of her closed-door training.”

“If she is to come out whilst you’re away, it would be bad.”

The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief already knew that Chu Feng had learned of a method to remove the curse.

Although he didn’t know if the method Chu Feng had grasped could remove Bai Liluo’s curse, it would still be best for them to give it a try.

Hearing the words spoken by the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, Chu Feng was unable to keep himself from smiling.

He knew that his Lord Clan Chief knew that the gathering of the ten starfield’s overlords would most likely end as a Feast at Swan Goose Gate.

Furthermore, knowing Chu Feng’s personality, he knew that he was not someone who would endure silently.

The reason why his Lord Clan Chief had said all those things was because he was afraid of Chu Feng accompanying him to the gathering, and then having something happen to him in the process.

Actually, in the short period of time Chu Feng had returned... the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief had both explicitly indicated and implicitly suggested that Chu Feng should not participate in the Purple Star Hall’s grand occasion in many ways.

But, how could Chu Feng not go when he knew very well that things might be dangerous? How could he allow the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief and the others go on their own?

If he were to allow that, he would only knowingly be letting them get setup to be humiliated.

“Lord Clan Chief, you don’t have to mention the matter regarding the Purple Star Hall anymore. I am definitely going. Even if you all are not going, I will still be going.” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Don’t forget that the invitation letter is with me.”

As Chu Feng spoke, he took out the invitation letter, and quickly put it away again.

“You mischievous child.”

Seeing Chu Feng behaving like that, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief shook his head.

He knew Chu Feng’s temperament very well. If he insisted on going, he definitely wouldn’t be able to do anything about it.

However, the Ten Abandoned Starfields were not all powers akin to the Wuming Clan.

Even amongst the Ten Abandoned Starfields, the Ancestral Martial Starfield was the weakest.

While Chu Feng was able to defeat Wuming Doutian, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief did not think he would be able to defeat the overlords of the other starfields.

He was truly worried for Chu Feng, and did not wish for him to be humiliated and, most importantly, encounter any danger.

“Bang~~~”

Suddenly, heaven and earth trembled.

The trembling was so strong that all the top Chu Heavenly Clansmen present, with the exception of Chu Feng and the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, all lost their footing and fell to the ground.

In fact, if it wasn’t for Chu Feng holding onto the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief in time, he would have also lost his footing.

After stabilizing themselves, they turned their gazes to the direction that the loud explosion had come from.

It turned out that it was from their grand protective formation.

A giant hole had appeared in the grand formation that protected the Chu Heavenly Clan and sealed heaven and earth.

Seeing that giant hole, the hearts of everyone present tensed up.

They immediately knew that an expert must’ve smashed their way inside.

Before Chu Feng and the others could even begin to think about who it might be, another change happened to the grand formation.

A layer of power appeared beneath the grand protective formation.

That power began to cover the grand formation. Ultimately, it covered the grand formation completely.

That layer of power was not spirit power. It was a sort of martial power that was pitch-black in color.

When the black power covered the entire grand formation, the sky that had originally beencovered in starlight was dyed completely black.

The blackness that covered heaven and earth created an intense contrast against the brightly lit Chu Heavenly Clan.

It was a very repressive and worrisome contrast.

Seeing that, even Chu Feng cried out ‘oh no’ in his heart.

If the person who came had come with ill intentions, they could’ve very well come openly.

However, that person had unleashed his power to seal off this entire region so as to pull the wool over everyone’s eyes.

This meant that what that person planned to do was definitely going to be extremely shameful.

It was one thing if it was something good. However, if it was bad, Chu Feng simply could not imagine what it would be.

“Tsk, tsk, tsk...”

“You’re actually afraid?”

“Turns out, Chu Xuanyuan’s son is nothing much either.”

A gloomy and cold voice sounded. At the same time, a figure appeared.

That person wore a blue gown, and stood in the sky.

He was none other than Lanfu Jianpeng.

Chu Feng and the others had no idea who he was. But, they were all able to tell that he had come with ill intentions.

“Who are you? I do not know you. What have you come here for?” Chu Feng asked with a stern voice.

“Who I am is not important. You merely need to know that I’ve come here today to wipe out your Chu Heavenly Clan,” said Lanfu Jianpeng.

After saying those words, Lanfu Jianpeng’s gaze suddenly changed. Then, his boundless killing intent swept out like a massive tornado.

In the blink of an eye, his killing intent had enveloped the entire surroundings.

It was not only Chu Feng. Everyone present could sense his terrifying killing intent.

Most importantly, his aura was extremely powerful, much more powerful than Wuming Doutian’s.

Chu Feng was able to sense his cultivation.

He was a rank five Utmost Exalted.

Chu Feng knew very well what he had said earlier was no joke. He really intended to wipe out the entire Chu Heavenly Clan.

Furthermore, he had the strength to wipe out the Chu Heavenly Clan.

With the situation like that, even the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was terrified to a state of confusion.

The only person who was still able to remain calm was Chu Feng.

“Exactly who are you? What grievance does our Chu Heavenly Clan have with you?”

“Even if you are to kill us, shouldn’t you tell us why we’re being killed?” asked Chu Feng.

“Brat, are you trying to stall for time?”

“Haha. Ant. Only ants like you would think of such an inferior trick,” Lanfu Jianpeng said mockingly.
