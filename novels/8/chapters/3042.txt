Chapter 3042 - Being Wrongly Accused

“Lord Youyuan, since this wrist protector is of use to me, this junior decided to keep it. Here are the other treasures from the treasury. Lord Youyuan, please accept them,” As Chu Feng spoke, he took out a Cosmos Sack.

That Cosmos Sack contained all of the treasures Chu Feng had obtained from the treasury.

“Keep it. Those things are of no use to me,” Chu Youyuan waved his hand.

Seeing his response, Chu Feng did not try to be overly courteous, and put the Cosmos Sack away. He knew that those treasures were indeed even more useless to someone like Chu Youyuan.

“Lord Benefactor, Lord Benefactor.”

Right at that moment, a voice was heard. It was Luo Dali.

It was not only Luo Dali; the others from the Luo Family were also flying over. After approaching, they all landed on the ground and began to kowtow to Chu Feng.

Luo Dali had a grateful expression on his face. However, the others from the Luo Family had nervous and panicky expressions.

“I promised you that I would save your family. I kept my promise, no?” Chu Feng said with a smile on his face.

“Lord Benefactor’s promise is worth a thousand pounds of gold. This Luo Dali can’t thank Lord Benefactor enough,” Luo Dali said in a very grateful manner.

“Come on, get back up. There’s no need for all these formalities,” Chu Feng waved his sleeve, and a gentle power brought Luo Dali and the others from the Luo Family to their feet.

Luo Xiaofeng and the others from the Luo Family were all startled. They had not expected Chu Feng to bring them back up to their feet. In unison, they said, “Milord, we were blind, please punish us.”

“Punishment?” Chu Feng chuckled lightly. Then, he said, “I have come to save you, not to punish you.”

Hearing those words, the faces of Luo Xiaofeng and the others turned red.

It turned out that Chu Feng was truly a magnanimous person.

By comparison, they themselves were much more petty and narrow-minded. This caused them to feel extremely ashamed of themselves.

After he said those words, Chu Feng waved his hand and said, “There is no need to thank me. Instead, you all should leave this place quickly. If you do not leave, you all will end up being trapped here forever.”

Hearing what Chu Feng said, the crowd realized that something was amiss. However, they still expressed their thanks to Chu Feng before turning around to leave.

After everyone left, Chu Feng left together with Chu Youyuan, Ying Mingchao and Zi Xunyi.

After leaving the hideout, Chu Feng tightly held an oval-shaped stone in his hand. Immediately, light started to shine, and a colossus appeared behind the four of them.

It was an item that resembled a hideout. It was as large as a small mountain.

Then, with a thought from Chu Feng, the stone started to shine with light, and the hideout started to shrink.

Then, that colossus shrunk down to a body of light the size of a fingernail.

Furthermore, it just so happened that there was a gap on the stone. That gap was precisely the size of the hideout after it shrunk in size.

The body of light merged with the stone. It turned out that they were originally one.

"Chu Feng, you’ve actually obtained the method to control this hideout?" witnessingng this scene, Chu Youyuan also revealed a joyous expression. He knew very well how amazing that hideout was. It could even be said that the hideout was as valuable as the Utmost Exalted Wrist Protector. This was truly an unexpected harvest.

"Actually, this item was located in that giant bug’s stomach. As for those Bandit Beasts, they were merely puppets borne from that giant bug," Chu Feng said.

"No wonder the Bandit Beasts were so loyal. So they were all children borne of that ugly monster," Chu Youyuan lamented.

After hearing what Chu Youyuan said, Chu Feng started to feel slight sympathy for the Bandit Beasts.

Puppets and children were two completely different concepts.

Chu Feng declared those Bandit Beasts to be puppets because he knew that that giant bug simply did not care about the Bandit Beasts’ lives. It was merely using them to capture slaves for it, slaves to provide energy to the two grand formations.

However, it was also true that the Bandit Beasts were born of that bug. Thus, it was completely reasonable to call them that bug’s children.

However, if one were to view them as children, then the Bandit Beasts were truly pitiful.

"Who is it?! Get the hell out here!" Suddenly, Chu Feng turned around and looked far into the forest.

"Lord Chu Feng, please don’t attack me. This old man holds no malice, no malice," Right at that moment, a panicky old man came out from the distant forest.

That old man was the same old man that had informed the people from the Luo Family who Chu Feng was in the hideout.

"What do you need?" Chu Feng asked.

That old man looked to Chu Youyuan and asked, "Lord Chu Feng, if this old man guesses correctly, that person over there should be the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Lord Chu Youyuan, right?"

"Precisely. How did you know about this?" Chu Feng asked.

Chu Youyuan was different from the other Chu Heavenly Clan’s experts. He was someone who kept a very low profile.

Whilst the people of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm might all know about the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Supreme Elders, very few people should know about Chu Youyuan.

"This old man was merely guessing. The reason for that was because there were rumors that you’d died in the Chu Heavenly Clan. Later on, there were rumors that the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Lord Chu Youyuan disappeared."

"After that, rumors began to fill the entire Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. The great majority of people believed the words of the Chu Heavenly Clan, and felt that you were a despicable vile character who, for the sake of embezzling treasures, plotted against others from the Chu Heavenly Clan, and ended up suffering a backlash while embezzling the treasures and died in the Nine Moons Sacred Domain."

"However, there are also a small portion of people that feel that you are not like that. After all, your conduct and deeds have all shown you to be a loyal and righteous person."

"For someone like you, how could you do that sort of despicable thing for the sake of some treasures?"

"Thus, many people guessed that it was the Chu Heavenly Clan that harbored a grudge against what your father did back then, and decided to eradicate you for it. That was why they ended up making up such a lie." Nnêw n0vel chapters are published on n0v/e/(lb)i(n.)co/m

"As for Lord Chu Youyuan, he wanted to protect you. That is why he was also eliminated by the Chu Heavenly Clan."

"As for this old man, I just so happened to be one of those people that believe in Lord Chu Feng’s character."

"Thus, ever since I recognized you, this old man felt that person should be Lord Youyuan, who disappeared alongside you," That old man said.

"You’re saying that the Chu Heavenly Clan is currently slandering Chu Feng’s reputation?" Chu Youyuan asked.

"Milord, that is indeed the case. Furthermore, during this period of time, they have used a lot of tricks, and even forged a lot of false evidence. Right now, many people of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm have considered it to be the truth. They all feel Lord Chu Feng to be a despicable and vile man, that his righteous and loyal nature from before was merely a disguise."

"Right now, for many fools that do not know the truth, they will immediately voice their contempt the moment Lord Chu Feng’s name is mentioned."

"Milord, you must definitely stand forth and demand justice for Lord Chu Feng," After saying those words, that old man actually kneeled to Chu Youyuan.
