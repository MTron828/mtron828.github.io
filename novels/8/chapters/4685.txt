Chapter 4685: The Way to Nurture the Armor

“Elder, you know Zi Ling?”

Chu Feng was surprised that the elder knew of Zi Ling and that Chu Feng was here to save her.

“There’s nothing that this old man doesn’t know of in the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect,” the mysterious voice said.

“Then... where is Zi Ling right now? Is she still fine?” Chu Feng asked.

“Don’t worry. Zi Ling has just been imprisoned; no harm has come upon her. It’s just a bit lonely for her. You have plenty of time to save her. After entering the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, focus your effort on slowly unlocking the Hidden Dragon Soul Armor. As long as you’re able to do so, you’ll be able to save Zi Ling,” the mysterious voice said. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Elder, what do you mean by that?” Chu Feng asked in intrigue.

The mysterious voice seemed to be suggesting that Chu Feng’s Hidden Dragon Soul Armor had something to do with Zi Ling’s imprisonment.

“Just heed my words, and everything will go well. Also, the sealing of your Three Souls and Seven Essences meant that not only has your cultivation regressed, but your other capabilities suffered the same fate as well. Similarly, you would only regain them slowly through unlocking your soul.

“With your current cultivation and capabilities, no one will believe that you have entered the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect through the Hidden Dragon Selection Formation. You might even have your memory erased and be chased out,” the mysterious voice said.

“Elder, can’t you testify for me?” Chu Feng asked.

“I’m not in a convenient position to show myself and testify for you,” the mysterious voice replied.

“Elder, I ask of you to help me on this matter.”

Chu Feng was starting to feel flustered.

He had gone through so much trouble to clear the Hidden Dragon Selection Formation in order to enter the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, and yet, he could possibly be chased out right away? Wouldn’t that render all of his efforts futile?

“Don’t panic. It just so happens that three days from now, the elders of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect will be accepting new disciples. You just have to wait another three days... I’ll make a move and alter the memories of one of the elders to make him think that you’re a disciple that he has found. He’ll lead you into the sect, thus resolving the issue concerning your identity,” the mysterious voice said.

“Thank you, elder.”

Chu Feng bowed deeply in gratitude.

As there were no other alternatives, he could only heed the elder’s words and spend another three days in the cavern. He was planning on chatting with the elder in the cavern to learn more about the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect and the crux to nurturing the armor, but unexpectedly, the elder suddenly stopped replying to him altogether.

What was even worse was that he realized that his spirit power had been sealed too. He was initially at rank three Dragon Transformation Sensation, but right now, he could only exert the strength of a rank one Dragon Transformation Sensation. To make things worse, his Spirit World Space had been sealed off too.

In truth, Chu Feng’s strongest means at the moment wasn’t his powers but his overpowered world spirits, Eggy and Yu Sha.

Eggy had gone into closed-door training, but at least Yu Sha was around.

However, he found that not only was he unable to release Yu Sha, but he couldn’t even tap into her power anymore.

In other words, he only had himself to rely on.

Chu Feng tried asking the elder how far he had to nurture the armor before he could open his World Spirit Space once more, but the elder didn’t give him any response, as if he had vanished into thin air.

Left with no choice, Chu Feng could only rely on himself.

So, he began looking into his Three Souls and Seven Essences to see how he was supposed to nurture the armor. Soon, he realized that there was a specific sequence to unlocking them, or else it wouldn’t work.

The core of a cultivator was his soul; the body was nothing more than a container. Beyond a certain cultivation level, a cultivator could readily regenerate his physical body as long as his soul remained intact.

The soul could be further divided into the Three Souls and Seven Essences. The Three Souls referred to the Life Soul, Earth Soul, Heaven Soul, and the Seven Essences referred to First Essence Tianchong, Second Essence Linghui, Third Essence Weiqu, Fourth Essence Weili, Fifth Essence Zhongshu, Sixth Essence Weijing, and Seventh Essence Weiying.

If any of the Three Souls and Seven Essences were to be harmed, it would deal damage to one’s soul. If all of them were destroyed, the soul would dissipate, and the cultivator would die.

Typically speaking, everyone had Three Souls and Seven Essences; this had nothing to do with cultivation at all. However, the Hidden Dragon Soul Armor had locked Chu Feng’s Three Souls and Seven Essences, as well as his dantian and spirit power. In other words, it had sealed off all of his power sources.

This seal was no ordinary seal. It was as if many layers of formation had been cast on Chu Feng’s body. If he could breach the formation, he would be able to recover his cultivation and even advance to greater heights later on.

However, what was more significant was the benefits to his Three Souls and Seven Essences. As it turned out, unlocking Three Souls and Seven Essences would bring a huge benefit to the Hidden Dragon Soul Armor. That was why this procedure was known as ‘nurturing the armor’.

There was a sequence to unlocking the armor, and based on Chu Feng’s observation, the sequence was as followed: Life Soul, First Essence, Second Essence, Third Essence, Earth Soul, Fourth Essence, Fifth Essence, Sixth Essence, Seventh Essence, Heaven Soul.

The difficulty in unlocking would increase along with the progression of the sequence. Fortunately, three days of careful observation had allowed Chu Feng to find the way to unlocking his Life Soul too.

While the Life Soul was the easiest one to unlock, it was also the very foundation of one’s soul. Chu Feng had to be careful when trying to unlock it, or else he could very well hurt his vitality.

In these three days, what that left Chu Feng the most delighted wasn’t him finding a way to nurture the armor but that the weakened Eggy’s condition had started to improve. With that, Chu Feng’s heart was finally put to ease.

After all, what he was the most worried about was Eggy’s safety, and it frustrated him that he couldn’t do anything for her!
