Chapter 5909: Rank Six Half-God

The key in the sky floated down toward Chu Feng, so he reached out and grabbed it.

Kacha!

As soon as he came into contact with the key, the key suddenly cracked before splitting into five pieces. At the same time, the ground Chu Feng was standing on suddenly glowed and morphed into the Nine Galaxies.

The five keys fell into five of the galaxies as shooting stars, namely the Immortal Sea Galaxy, Totem Galaxy, Bloodline Galaxy, Divine Body Galaxy, and Seven Realms Galaxy.

This was a tip as to where the key fragments were. The locations of the key fragments were detailed in the case of Immortal Sea, Totem, Bloodline, and Seven Realms, but that was not the case for the Divine Body Galaxy.

“There is only one key. The one who finds it will be allowed to enter the city,” the voice said.

A surge of teleportation energy enveloped Chu Feng, and he was transported out of the formation realm back to the middle of space. He looked at the massive Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s main city and sighed in relief.

Jie Tianran must have realized that Chu Feng was keeping track of his movement, so he decided to secretly examine the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s main city instead and successfully made it in.

Chu Feng deduced that Jie Tianran didn’t obtain the complete key and had to gather the five key fragments too. While Jie Tianran was a step faster than him, the chances were that it wasn’t that easy to obtain the key fragments.

This meant that they were on the same starting line.

Thus, Chu Feng returned to the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect and informed the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster and Zi Ling about what he had seen inside the formation realm.

“The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master is a cunning old fox,” the sectmaster remarked.

She had been closely watching the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, but there were no movements on their side. Who could have thought that the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master had already slipped into the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s formation realm?

They were likely already finding the key fragments.

Were it not for Chu Feng, she would have thought the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master was still quietly recuperating in his palace.

“He’s indeed not to be underestimated,” Chu Feng said.

He had to admit that his maternal grandfather was indeed a formidable individual. It wouldn’t be easy to deal with the latter.

“Big brother Chu Feng, where do you intend to head first?” Zi Ling asked.

“I want to treat you first,” Chu Feng said.

Zi Ling burst into laughter. “All right, I’ll let you treat me.”

The sectmaster found a quiet place for them. It took some time to heal Zi Ling, but fortunately, she managed to make a full recovery in the end.

Following that, Chu Feng, Zi Ling, and the sectmaster went to look for Wen Xue.

“Junior Chu Feng, you returned faster than I thought,” Wen Xue warmly greeted Chu Feng and Zi Ling.

“Place this on your body. It should aid you in recovering your depletion.” Chu Feng passed a jade token to Wen Xue. This was the third treasure he obtained from the Sacred Temple.

“Such a meticulous guy you are. However, this doesn’t offset the debt you owe me,” Wen Xue said with a smile as she accepted the jade token.

Her smile was sweet, looking like an innocent little child. However, both Chu Feng and Zi Ling knew that it would be foolish to underestimate what she was capable of.

“My promise holds. You can choose how I should repay the debt I owe you,” Chu Feng replied.

“Good. Junior Chu Feng sure is nice and obedient. It’s no wonder Senior Zi Ling likes you so much,” Wen Xue said with a chuckle. “How do I use this jade token?” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Infuse a blood droplet into it,” Chu Feng said.

“Got it.” Wen Xue did as she was told, and the jade token emanated a gentle healing aura that only worked on its owner. “This is good stuff. Junior Chu Feng, I appreciate your gift.”

She fiddled with the jade token a bit before stuffing it into her waist. The jade token’s effect would last until it ran out of energy.

“Junior Chu Feng, let me know when you’re leaving the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm,” she said.

“Do you need something?” Chu Feng asked.

“I want to go out and play,” Wen Xue said.

Chu Feng and Zi Ling exchanged looks. They could tell that Wen Xue wanted to travel with them.

“My master has already accepted my request. Are the two of you unwilling to bring me along? Don’t worry, I won’t get in your way. I’ll hide if the two of you want to do anything, not to mention Junior Chu Feng is such a powerful world spiritist. I won’t be able to see anything even if I want to,” Wen Xue replied with a mischievous smile.

Chu Feng and Zi Ling looked at the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster.

“Wen Xue requested to travel with you and I granted her permission. However, you get to choose whether you want to bring her along or not,” the sectmaster said.

“Zi Ling can decide,” Chu Feng said.

“You sure are good at pushing things away,” Zi Ling scoffed.

“You’re the one who calls the shots in our family.” Chu Feng chuckled.

“Fine. Let’s travel together then,” Zi Ling said.

Chu Feng was surprised. He thought that Zi Ling would turn Wen Xue down.

“Oi oi oi, what’s that expression? Junior Chu Feng, it can’t be that you don't want to travel with me?” Wen Xue narrowed her eyes.

“Of course not. I already said that Zi Ling calls the shots,” Chu Feng replied.

“When do we leave?” Wen Xue asked.

“Give me some time. We’ll set off after I make a breakthrough.”

Zi Ling and the others thought that Chu Feng was going to find a place to go into closed-door training, but to their surprise, Chu Feng sat down on the floor and began channeling the natural energies gathered within him.

The natural energies came from the 'poison pill' he took from the Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s mysterious elder. This 'poison pill' was actually a potent cultivation resource harnessing martial enlightenment that could aid him in his cultivation.

Chu Feng quickly assimilated the natural energies.

Boom!

A nine-colored lightning appeared in the sky and crashed down. It looked as if the world was going to come to an end, but Chu Feng easily coped with it.

By the time he opened his eyes, he had already successfully made a breakthrough. He was now a rank six Half-God level cultivator.
