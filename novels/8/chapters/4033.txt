Chapter 4033 - Vicious And Merciless

Chu Feng found it incredible to hear that familiar voice.

That said, he only hesitated slightly before continuing onward.

The journey onward was not completely obstruction-free.

Spirit formations, traps, mazes, there were all kinds of things blocking his path.

It could be seen that the master of the place had put forth quite a lot of effort in order to prevent others from entering.

Unfortunately, those traps and spirit formations were completely useless against a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist like Chu Feng.

Soon, he passed through the long tunnel. When he breached the final spirit formation, a vast underground world appeared before him.

For the majority of the underground worlds, they would be constructed like the world above.

Even though they were located underground, one could still see blue skies and white clouds above. There were also mountains and rivers present.

Although they were located underground, those worlds were still magnificent.

Yet, that underground world was not made like that. Its appearance was relatively primitive.

Looking above, one would only see layers upon layers of soil. That said, there was a spirit formation below the final layer of soil. It was that spirit formation that stopped that soil from falling down.

The spirit formation not only supported the soil at the top of the underground world, but it also emitted light that brightly illuminated the underground world.

Because of that, Chu feng did not need to use any special observational methods to clearly see the contents of the cave.

A large amount of monstrous beasts were present in the underground world.

Those monstrous beasts were all humanoid in appearance. However, they were over a dozen times the size of ordinary people.

Furthermore, although they stood on two legs like humans, they had eight arms.

Their eight arms were extremely robust, and looked very advantageous.

Those monstrous beasts also had very thick muscles. Their muscles seemed to be made of steel, and their hands were sharp like blades.

Those monstrous beasts appeared very dangerous.

There were tens of thousands of such monstrous beasts in the underground world.

However, even though those monstrous beasts were clearly extremely robust, they were covered in cuts and bruises.

It turned out that they were doing manual labor. They were using their many powerful arms and sharp blade-like hands to dig at the cave walls.

They were excavating the rocks from the walls with their hands. Then, they used a special spirit formation to refine those excavated rocks into a special sort of gas that remained inside the spirit formation.

Those rocks appeared to be very ordinary. But, they were not ordinary at all.

Unless one were to possess a sufficient amount of martial power or outstanding world spirit techniques, it was simply impossible to do anything to those rocks, much less mine them.

However, the bodies of those monstrous beasts were rather special. They seemed to possess some sort of resonance with the stones that covered the cave walls. Because of that, they were able to mine the rocks from the cave.

However, from their exhausted looks, one could easily tell that excavating those rocks was an extremely laborious task for them too.

Although that was the case, there were thousands of enormous whips floating above the monstrous beasts.

The whips were covered in surging flames. They were extremely dangerous.

If any monstrous beast dared slack off, a whip would immediately strike them.

The whips were capable of splitting open the monstrous beasts’ robust steel-like bodies. Every whiplash would leave a bloody wound.

Those whips were the cause of the monstrous beasts’ miserable screams.

That said, being lashed at by the whips was not the only source of screams.

Chu Feng was also able to hear screams from the grand formation that refined the mined rocks.

It turned out that the grand formation was not only refining rocks, there were also monstrous beasts inside the grand formation. They too were being refined.

Besides the screams of those monstrous beasts, there was another voice.

That voice was shouting at those monstrous beasts, berating them for being too slow.

The person shouting at the monstrous beast was the person in charge of those whips.

As for that person, he was someone that Chu Feng was familiar with.

That person was a survivor who had managed to escape the purge of the All-heaven Sect.

Tuoba Chengan!

Chu Feng had thought about the possibility of finding Tuoba Chengan in the future.

However, he had never imagined that he would run into him so unexpectedly.

Tuoba Chengan was lying on his side atop a hill. There were desserts and fruits next to him. From this position he reprimanded the monstrous beasts as they worked, enjoying his food and drink contentedly.

To him, the manual labor of those monstrous beasts was like an enjoyable show.

It must be said that he appeared to be extremely comfortable.

That said, the hill he was lying atop was no ordinary hill. It was a hill of corpses.

The hill was made up of the piled up corpses of those monstrous beasts.

Those corpses did not appear to have simply been killed. Their flesh had completely dried up. It was as if they had suffered miserable deaths with all their flesh sucked dry.

“That old evil bastard.”

Taking only a single glance at the situation, Chu Feng already had a rough idea of what was happening.

Sure enough, the mountain range contained treasure. As for the treasure, it was the rocks.

However, those rocks were very special. Unless one possessed exceptional strength, it would be impossible to mine them. Only those monstrous beasts were capable of mining the rocks.

Even the spirit formation refining the rocks was not an ordinary spirit formation. The aura of those monstrous beasts was present in that spirit formation.

If Chu Feng guessed correctly, Tuoba Chengan was committing an extremely cruel act.

That spirit formation required the monstrous beasts’ bloodline power.

In order for that spirit formation to possess the power to refine those mined rocks, the monstrous beasts needed to be fed into the spirit formation repeatedly so that they could be refined by it.

Chu Feng was even able to tell what sort of power the gas refined from those mined rocks was.

It was a sort of power beneficial to one’s dantian.

Soul was the life of martial cultivators. As for the dantian, it was the foundation of martial cultivation.

Both martial power and cultivation existed within the dantian. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

If one’s dantian was powerful, one would also be powerful.

It was no wonder Tuoba Chengan hadn’t immediately escaped the All-heaven Starfield even though the All-heaven Sect had been brought to ruin. Instead he’d chosen mine those rocks.

Likely, he was unwilling to part with the power capable of strengthening his dantian.

He wanted to refine all the power contained in the rocks into power that he could utilize before leaving.

“Old bastard Tuoba, you’re truly vicious and merciless.”

Seeing Tuoba Chengan’s savage act, Chu Feng was unable to hold himself back. Not only did he reveal himself, he even spoke.

Apart from the screaming monstrous beasts, Tuoba Chengan was the only person there.

The different voices that had suddenly sounded immediately caught the attention of the monstrous beasts.

Of course, Chu Feng’s voice also caught Tuoba Chengan’s attention.

He also naturally recognized Chu Feng’s voice.

That was also the reason why he felt it so shocking to hear it there.

However, when he looked in the direction of the voice and discovered that Chu Feng was really there, he had no choice but to believe it to be real.

“Asura?!”

“You... why would you be here?”

Panic immediately flooded Tuoba Chengan’s face the moment he saw Chu Feng. He began to look all around.

He was extremely afraid. What he was afraid of was not Chu Feng. Instead, it was Zhao Hong.

As such, he looked around quickly trying to find her.

“It’s no wonder you were able to recover your cultivation so thoroughly as if nothing had happened even after the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s City Master had crippled it.”

“Turns out you’d been tempering your dantian with the power from this place.”

“Using their lives in exchange for power, how are you able to rest and eat in peace?” Chu Feng asked with a stern voice.

“How did you find this place?”

Tuoba Chengan didn’t bother to pay any attention to Chu Feng’s questions. Rather, he started questioning him instead.

“Don’t forget that I’m a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist.”

“Discovering a place like this is not difficult for me.”

“However, you don’t need to be so afraid either. I only discovered this place today by pure accident because I was passing by the area.”

“Before entering, I had no idea you were in here,” said Chu Feng.

“Thus, you came here alone?” asked Tuoba Chengan.

“That’s right,” said Chu Feng.

Hearing those words, Tuoba Chengan’s nervousness finally eased.

At the same time, the corners of his mouth rose into a cold smile, and killing intent appeared in his eyes.
