Chapter 4950: The King Bloodline

“That treasure was hidden inside Situ Gouyue’s arm all along? Wait a moment… could that have been Chu Feng’s goal all along?” Shengguang Baimei exclaimed.

Master Yin Ren stared at Chu Feng with an even deeper gaze than before.

“You were relying on this to enhance your bloodline power. Without this, you couldn’t have constructed such a formidable formation,” Chu Feng said as he fiddled with the crystal in his hand.

Those words verified Shengguang Baimei’s conjecture.

From the very start, Chu Feng wasn’t just going for something as innocuous as to just sever Situ Gouyue’s arm. What he wanted was to retrieve the treasure hidden inside his arm.&nbsp;

However, what was baffling about this was that none of the veteran world spiritists was aware of the existence of a treasure hidden inside Situ Gouyue’s arm, but Chu Feng actually noticed it.&nbsp;

The crowd felt a little suffocated. They realized that the young man from the Ancestral Martial Galaxy was actually superior to them in terms of discernment.&nbsp;

None of them actually realized what Chu Feng was up to all this while.

Just like those from the Situ World Spiritist Clan, they were all duped by Chu Feng.

“Lord Clan Chief, Chu Feng is even more formidable than what the rumors put him out to be. We…”

The crowd from the Zhuge Clan panicked as they turned to look at the Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief. They hadn’t forgotten how they had offended Chu Feng earlier on.

It was common sense in the world of cultivation not to offend a swiftly rising prodigy.&nbsp;

Just the thought of having to deal with Chu Feng as an enemy made cold sweat trickle down their back.&nbsp;

However, the Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief remained perfectly calm. He gestured for the crowd to quieten down and not panic.&nbsp;

As for Chu Feng, he couldn’t be bothered with how others were viewing him. He turned his gaze toward the blue-cloaked woman.

“Elder, I have to say that the ability of this palace of yours to equalize the spirit power of juniors is pretty formidable. However, that doesn’t necessarily place two world spiritists on equal grounds, or should I say, the purpose of this treasure is to have two world spiritists pit their bloodlines against each other.&nbsp;

“Every world spiritist in the world possesses a world spiritist bloodline, but most of their bloodlines are too weak to be perceived. However, this crystal over here has the power to fully awaken a world spiritist’s bloodline, thus giving Situ Gouyue a decisive advantage on this battlefield.

“You banned the usage of treasures for this duel, and yet you concealed this treasure inside Situ Gouyue’s arm with a concealment formation. It’s ironic how the Situ World Spiritist Clan looks down on the eastern region so much, and yet, you stoop to such underhanded methods to defeat us. Your words don’t reflect your actions at all.&nbsp;

“I, Chu Feng, have never seen anything as pathetic as this!”

Chu Feng looked at the blue-cloaked woman scornfully.

“Audacious!”

Many from the Situ World Spiritist Clan glared at Chu Feng with chilling killing intent.

“There’s no need to look at me in such a manner. You can’t intimidate me with mere glares,” Chu Feng said with a chuckle.&nbsp;

He had known from the start that the Situ World Spiritist Clan wouldn’t let him off that easily once he intervened. In truth, if not for his wits, he would have already died in Situ Gouyue’s hands by now.&nbsp;

“I would have never thought that there would be such a junior from the Ancestral Martial Galaxy. You’re right. I’ve never intended to have a fair duel right from the start. We didn’t come here to have a spar with you. Our purpose is simply to humiliate you through and through.

“Take the Zhuge Clan for example. What rights does it have to retain Situ Qi’s legacy?”&nbsp;

The blue-cloaked woman shot a glance at the Zhuge Clan as she spoke.&nbsp;

Those from the Zhuge Clan weren’t too bothered to hear those words since the blue-cloaked woman had never bothered trying to hide her scorn for them. What they were surprised, however, was how the blue-cloaked woman actually admitted to Chu Feng’s words.

It turned out that Zhuge Feiluan didn’t lose to Situ Gouyue because he was weak. The latter simply had a treasure that allowed him to fully utilize his world spiritist bloodline.

That would also explain Situ Gouyue’s formidable formation and the terrifying aura emanated by his world spiritist bloodline.&nbsp;

It was all due to the crystal and the palace. The combination of those two factors granted him astounding powers that didn’t belong to him. If Zhuge Feiluan had that kind of treasures too, there was a good chance that he might have been able to triumph over Situ Gouyue.&nbsp;

It was one thing if they had lost because they were truly weak, but they couldn’t accept losing to such underhanded means!

“Milord, our Zhuge Clan has treated you with respect. Don’t you think that it’s too far for you to resort to such means?” the Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief asked.

There was finally a sliver of anger in his voice.

“Does the means really matter when it comes to the disposal of trash? You’re just a bunch of weaklings who dream of coveting Situ Qi’s legacy, but why don’t you take a look in the mirror and see if you’re truly worthy of it?&nbsp;

“I’ve no time to deal with you now, so I’ll settle that score with you later on,” the blue-cloaked woman sneered coldly.

Those from the Zhuge Clan were infuriated. They had been tolerant thus far in hopes to resolving this conflict amicably, but it looked like the blue-cloaked woman had never planned to let their Zhuge Clan off right from the start.&nbsp;

They realized that their tolerance was nothing more than a futile effort.

They turned to look at the Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief as if waiting for his order.

The blue-cloaked woman did notice their reaction, but she couldn’t care less. Instead, she turned her gaze toward Chu Feng.

“The Zhuge Clan was useless, but you sure surprised me. If you’re willing to join our Situ World Spiritist Clan, we’ll offer you better resources. In fact, we’ll even allow you to become the ruler of the eastern region after your powers fully mature,” the blue-cloaked woman said.

“Ruler of the eastern region?”

Those words surprised not just those from the Zhuge Clan but even Master Yin Ren, Shengguang Baimei, and the others too.&nbsp;

Those words alluded to the Situ World Spiritist Clan’s ambitions.

“What are you saying? Why are you inviting him into our Situ World Spiritist Clan? He has no right to do so! I’ll destroy him right now!”

Those words infuriated Situ Gouyue. He directed his powerful world spiritist bloodline toward Chu Feng with unstoppable momentum, as if a terrifying demon was threatening to devour the world whole.&nbsp;

Yet, Chu Feng stood unfazed before Situ Gouyue’s aggression. He tossed aside his formation dagger and waited for the aura to approach him before clenching his fist around the crystal and hurling his fist forward.

Boom!

The might of the punch tore a gaping hole through the aura and rushed toward Situ Gouyue.&nbsp;

Alarmed, Situ Gouyue tried to gather the power from his world spiritist bloodline to put up a defense against Chu Feng’s punch, but it was to no avail. The punch tore through all the defenses he had constructed, leaving him utterly helpless. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Gwah!

The force of the punch landed squarely onto Situ Gouyue.

He didn’t spurt blood or crumble to the ground. If anything, he looked completely unharmed, as if the punch hadn’t inflicted any damage upon him.&nbsp;

Moments later, however, he lost control of his body and fell to his knees. Then, he fell forward into a crawling position. Even his words sounded weak.&nbsp;

“H-how did this happen?”

He couldn’t accept the outcome.

“Is that the power of the treasure? If that’s the case, our Feiluan wouldn’t have lost either if he had that treasure with him.”

Seeing how easily Chu Feng defeated Situ Gouyue with the treasure in hand, those from the Zhuge Clan felt pity for Zhuge Feiluan. They felt that Zhuge Feiluan could have won the duel if he had a similar treasure on hand.

“Didn’t I already warn you that you’ll only embarrass yourself if you continue the duel? You simply refuse to listen.”

Chu Feng walked over to Situ Gouyue’s side and gazed down on him from above. He shook his head and sighed lamentably.&nbsp;

It was just that his words made those from the Situ World Spiritist Clan grit their teeth angrily. It looked like they wanted nothing more than to rush in and rip Chu Feng into shreds.&nbsp;

One must know that the person Chu Feng was looking down on right now was their young master!

However, there was a different gleam in the eyes of the blue-cloaked woman.

“That young friend over there, your name is Chu Feng, right? Since you already have that bloodline awakening stone in your hand, why don’t you try fully releasing your bloodline?” the blue-cloaked woman asked.&nbsp;

“You wish to see it?” Chu Feng asked.&nbsp;

“That’s right. I’m curious to see the form of your world spiritist bloodline. I’m looking forward to seeing another surprise from you,” the blue-cloaked woman said with a smile.&nbsp;

The gaze she directed toward Chu Feng had completely changed by this point. She was no longer maintaining a lofty attitude anymore. If anything, it looked like she was trying to express goodwill toward him.

“Very well, I’ll satisfy your curiosity then. I’ll show your Situ World Spiritist Clan the powers wielded by the world spiritists of our eastern region!”

Boom!

A loud explosion sounded from Chu Feng’s body.&nbsp;

Situ Gouyue had impressed the crowd by having his aura suffuse a tenth of the palace, but the sheer amount of aura emanated by Chu Feng instantaneously enveloped the entire palace. The palace began to tremor, as if it was struggling to keep the aura within its confinement.&nbsp;

On top of that, the aura released by Chu Feng carried a hint of inviolability and intimidation. The world spiritists present could feel a pressure weighing down on their souls.

They felt like adult wolves encountering the cub of a ferocious tiger.&nbsp;

Even though the adult wolves had the advantage in terms of size and strength, the innate subordination that came from their bloodline still made them feel fear toward the cub. This was bloodline suppression.

They could feel the huge difference between them and Chu Feng in terms of bloodlines.&nbsp;

This was Chu Feng’s world spiritist bloodline!

Once it descended upon the world, all world spiritists would have to lower their heads deferentially. This was the king bloodline!
