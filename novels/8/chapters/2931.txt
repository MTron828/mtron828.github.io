Chapter 2931 - Why Defame Me?

Once that voice was heard, it immediately brought forth a large commotion. The crowd turned toward the direction where that voice sounded from at practically the same moment.

“Those are!!!”

Upon looking, the crowd were immediately overjoyed.

They discovered that there were many people standing at the entrance of the Ghost Sect Hall. The people leading them were a group of people from the younger generation.

That being said, this group of people from the younger generation were all extraordinary individuals.

Not only were there geniuses from the Chu Heavenly Clan and disciples from the Starfall Holy Land present, but even Chu Ruoshi, Chu Lingxi, Chu Huanyu, Song Yunfei and Ren Xiaoyao, those renowned geniuses, were present.

“There are actually this many demon-level geniuses present in this Grand Auction Assembly?”

“It would appear that there’s going to be a great show today.”

After being surprised, the crowd actually revealed expressions of excitement on their faces.

With those demon-level geniuses present, the crowd felt that even though the Illusory Blood Lotus this time around had bloomed only for the people of the younger generation, it would not be able to stop those geniuses.

If all those people from the younger generation were to enter the crimson fog to retrieve the treasure from the Illusory Blood Lotus, it would mean that a competition would indirectly emerge.

Even if the competition would be breaking through the illusions, it remained that being able to break through the illusions first would serve as proof of their abilities.

As such, how could the crowd not be looking forward to it?

“Strange, where’s Young Hero Chu Feng?”

Soon, someone started to ask where Chu Feng was. The reason for that was because they did not discover Chu Feng’s silhouette even after carefully examining that group of people from the younger generation.

“That’s true, where’s Young Hero Chu Feng?”

The next moment, that question began to sound from the crowd in the sky and on the ground nonstop.

It could be seen from both the tones of their voices and their expressions that the crowd was feeling regretful at being unable to see Chu Feng.

Regretful, naturally they would feel regretful.

The people of the younger generation present contained many of the strongest people of the younger generation in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm at the moment. That was something that no one doubted.

However, in terms of being the most famous among the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm’s younger generation at the moment, that person would be none other than Chu Feng.

At that moment, so many of the younger generation’s geniuses were present. In fact, even Chu Ruoshi and Song Yunfei, the two people that were most likely to succeed the first ranker on the Demon-level Geniuses List, had both appeared.

If Chu Feng was to not appear and compete against them, the crowd would naturally feel regretful.

“Chu Feng? He won’t be coming.”

Right at that moment, Ren Xiaoyao let out a cold smile.

Those with discerning eyes noticed that Ren Xiaoyao’s smile was filled with contempt and a sneer.

“Young Hero Ren Xiaoyao, why wouldn’t Young Hero Chu Feng not be coming?” Someone asked curiously.

“That Chu Feng overestimated his capabilities and provoked someone that he shouldn’t have provoked. He ran away before the Grand Auction Assembly was even over. Right now, he’s most likely still fleeing,” Ren Xiaoyao said.

“Provoked someone that he shouldn’t have provoked?”

Ren Xiaoyao’s words were akin to a sudden clap of thunder. He immediately caused the crowd to feel extremely astonished.

Wasn’t Chu Feng a fearless individual according to the rumors? Why would he be so scared that he’d end up fleeing?

If that was the truth, then what sort of existence scared Chu Feng away?

“Little friend Ren Xiaoyao, you should not speak off the cuff. We all know that little friend Chu Feng is a fearless individual. Who could possibly scare him fleeing?”

From among the crowd, a frank and outspoken old man refuted Ren Xiaoyao in a mocking manner.

That old man did not belong to any power. Furthermore, his cultivation was that of a Martial Immortal. Although he was only a rank one Martial Immortal, his strength was above all of the people of the younger generation present.

Furthermore, he was someone that had personally witnessed Chu Feng’s manner of conduct before. Thus, he held a very high opinion of Chu Feng.

Seeing that Ren Xiaoyao was insulting Chu Feng like that when he was not present, that old man was unable to contain himself. That was the reason why he spoke to refute Ren Xiaoyao.

“Humph, you’re implying that I’m lying?”

“If you don’t trust me, you can very well ask everyone else here. You can ask them if Chu Feng was scared away, if he didn’t leave before the auction was even finished,” Ren Xiaoyao said. After he finished saying those words, he even looked over to Song Yunfei, “Brother Song, aren’t I right?”

“Cough, cough,” Song Yunfei coughed lightly twice.

Then, he said, “I do not know if Chu Feng has fled. However, what Brother Ren said is the truth.”

“Brother Chu Feng indeed provoked a major character. Furthermore, he indeed left in a hurry when the most precious treasure to be auctioned on the Grand Auction Assembly was about to appear on stage.”

Although Song Yunfei did not explicitly state that Chu Feng had fled because he offended someone, he implied that with his words.

At that moment, the crowd burst into an uproar again. They were all feeling extremely astonished. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

After all, Song Yunfei’s words carried much more weight than Ren Xiaoyao’s words.

“Never would I have imagined that Young Hero Chu Feng was this sort of person too.”

“Wasn’t he rumored to be completely fearless and daring to provoke anyone? It would appear that the rumors aren’t trustworthy at all.”

“Perhaps he too is someone who will only bully the weak, and fear the strong.”

At that moment, the favorable impression toward Chu Feng that many people held began to wane. Only a small minority of the crowd were suspicious of what Song Yunfei and Ren Xiaoyao claimed.

“All of us present here can bear witness to that matter.”

Right at that moment, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Chu Huanyu actually also spoke.

“That’s right, we can confirm that matter.”

After Chu Huanyu spoke, of the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations present, everyone besides Chu Lingxi and Chu Ruoshi echoed in agreement.

After all, Chu Huanyu was someone who possessed great rallying power amongst the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations.

“Even Young Master Chu Huanyu is saying that. This must mean that there’s no mistake at all, it’s all true.”

After Chu Huanyu and the other members of the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations spoke, the crowd started feeling that the matter was absolutely confirmed. At that moment, their impressions of Chu Feng decreased once again.

“I truly never would’ve expected that leaving the auction early would be claimed as fleeing in fear by others.”

“Even if I, Chu Feng, offended everyone in the past, there shouldn’t be a need to defame me like this, no?”

Right at that moment, a voice sounded from the Ghost Sect Hall’s city wall.

After that voice was heard, several figures appeared.

They were Chu Feng, the Ghost Sect Hall’s Hall Master, Elder Xingyi and Xia Yun’er.

“Chu Feng! It’s Young Hero Chu Feng! Isn’t he there? How is he fleeing?”

The crowd felt extremely surprised to see Chu Feng. At that moment, the eyes of everyone in the sky and on the ground were turned to Song Yunfei, Ren Xiaoyao and the others.

Chu Feng was clearly still in the Ghost Sect Hall. Furthermore, he was with grand characters like the Ghost Sect Hall’s Hall Master and Elder Xingyi. How was he fleeing?

Furthermore, from what Chu Feng had said, it seemed that they had had altercations in the past.

Defaming. If this wasn’t defaming someone, what else could it be?

At that moment, the impression the crowd had regarding Chu Feng increased once again. Furthermore, their impressions of Ren Xiaoyao and Song Yunfei decreased quite a bit.

Of course, this also included Chu Huanyu and the other Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations.

That being said, after thinking about it, the crowd remembered that they’ve heard that there had been conflicts between Chu Feng, Ren Xiaoyao and Song Yunfei. Merely, when had there been a disagreement between Chu Feng and Chu Huanyu and the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations?

“Song Yunfei and Ren Xiaoyao, I only wish to say this to you all. If you are unable to afford to lose in gambling matches, do not attempt to gamble with me, Chu Feng, again. I, Chu Feng, am not fond of you all losing to me and then feeling grievance in your hearts and thereby attempting to smear my name,” Chu Feng said to Song Yunfei and Ren Xiaoyao.

“So that’s the case. So they actually lost to Chu Feng in gambling. No wonder they’re trying to defame Chu Feng.”

After the crowd found out the truth, they turned to look at Chu Huanyu. They wanted to know what sort of conflict there was between Chu Feng and Chu Huanyu.

At that moment, Chu Feng also turned to Chu Huanyu.

“As for you all, I seem to have no conflict with you. Why are you trying to defame me?”

Once Chu Feng’s words were heard, the crowd were extremely astonished.

There was actually no conflict between them?
