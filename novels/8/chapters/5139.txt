Chapter 5139: The Return of the Prodigy

The Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sky was covered by a billowing blood-red aura reminiscent of clouds. It exerted a domineering aura that sent chills down one’s spine.

Such a sight would have usually triggered Chu Feng’s unease, but that wasn’t the case here.

He could tell that the aura was non-threatening despite its lethal nature. It was a phenomenon. Most important of all, there was a whiff of Zi Ling’s aura from the red aura, revealing that the phenomenon was caused by the Blood-red Ancient Tower in Zi Ling’s body.

Chu Feng was overjoyed by the sight, knowing that the chances were likely that Zi Ling had made a significant breakthrough.

“Chu Feng, you’re back!” a familiar voice sounded.

Chu Feng turned his head around and saw a beautiful silhouette heading over from the distance. In the blink of an eye, she had already landed in front of Chu Feng with a whiff of fragrance.

That person was one of Chu Feng’s good friends in the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, Xia Yan.

“Chu Feng, when did you return?”

Xia Yan could hardly suppress her smile upon seeing Chu Feng, but her face quickly stiffened up when she sensed Chu Feng’s aura.

“I-is that… your spirit power?’ Xia Yan asked.

Chu Feng had used his spirit power to accelerate in his boat in the ancient teleportation formation so as to get here as quickly as possible, so there was still a tinge of spirit power lingering around him.

After contracting with the Asura World Spirit Army, he advanced all the way to rank nine Dragon Transformation Sensation. He was still a step away from becoming a legendary God-cloak World Spiritist, but that was already a formidable feat in itself.

At the very least, Xia Yan, who had always been considered a prodigy in world spiritist techniques, found it utterly inconceivable.

“I didn’t just make a breakthrough in my spirit power. Take another look.”

Another energy seeped out from Chu Feng’s body. It was the martial power of a rank eight Martial Exalted level cultivator.

“R-rank eight Martial Exalted level? Rank nine Dragon Transformation Sensation? W-w-w-what in the world is wrong with you?! It has only been a while since you left the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, but how in the world did you grow so much?”

Overwhelmed by shock, Xia Yan clasped her mouth with both her hands.

“I was lucky to stumble upon a fortuitous encounter,” Chu Feng replied.

He had already known that Xia Yan would respond in such a manner. After all, he did grow by a huge margin within a short period of time. It was only because he was on good terms with Xia Yan that he revealed his strength to her and shared his recent growth, though he found her shocked face amusing as well.

“This is incredible! What kind of fortuitous encounter is it? Bring me there too!”

Xia Yan revealed a look of joy. She was happy for Chu Feng.

“Now that I think about it, it’s really a huge coincidence. I stumbled upon the fortuitous encounter at the place where we first met,” Chu Feng replied.

“The place where we first met? Are you referring to the Asura Graveyard?” Xia Yan asked.

“That’s right.” Chu Feng honestly revealed everything that had happened to Xia Yan.

“My gosh! Are you serious? Those Asura World Spirits are inside your body?”

Xia Yan’s mouth opened wide once more.

“Why would I lie to you? Alright, I’ve already told you everything that has happened recently. Quick, tell me what’s with the phenomenon up there. Was it caused by Zi Ling?” Chu Feng asked.

“Yes, it was caused by Zi Ling. The phenomenon has already lasted for quite a few days now, and it doesn’t look like it’ll disappear anytime soon,” Xia Yan replied.

“Did Lord Sectmaster say anything?” Chu Feng asked.

“Lord Sectmaster told us not to worry before leaving the sect,” Xia Yan replied.

“She left the sect? Where did she go?” Chu Feng asked.

“Do you remember the disciple whom Lord Sectmaster brought back? I’m referring to the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple. If I recall correctly, she’s called Wen Xue,” Xia Yan said.

“Yes, I remember her. Did something happen to her?” Chu Feng asked.

“Lord Sectmaster has found an Ancient Era talent assessment platform, and she requested for all disciples and elders to undergo the talent assessment. Wen Xue’s result is astonishing. Lord Sectmaster was satisfied with her result, so she took her elsewhere to cultivate,” Xia Yan said.

“Is that so?”

Chu Feng heaved a sigh of relief upon hearing that the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster wasn’t around. After all, he had secretly brought Yaoyao out of the sect. There was a good chance that he would be punished if she was around.

He had gotten lucky on this matter.

“Chu Feng, you should also test your talent on the talent assessment platform now that you’re back. That platform is quite fun. It can induce phenomena depending on the extent of your aptitude. The phenomenon induced by Wen Xue covered the entire sky. You mustn’t lose to her, alright?”

Xia Yan grabbed Chu Feng’s arm and dragged him all the way into the depths of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect.

It didn’t take long for him to arrive before the talent assessment platform. It looked like an ordinary stone platform at first glance, just that it emanated the aura of the Ancient Era. On closer examination, there were ancient runes inscribed on it.

As a world spiritist himself, Chu Feng could sense just how powerful the formation was. At the very least, it wasn’t something that the current him was capable of creating.

The talent assessment platform was currently locked off by a barrier, preventing anyone from accessing it. However, that wasn’t a problem to them since the key was currently with Duan Liufeng.

Xia Yan told Chu Feng to wait here for him while she called Duan Liufeng over, but she ended up not just calling Duan Liufeng but many other people too. By the time Duan Liufeng arrived, there were already countless elders and disciples gathered around the talent assessment platform.

They had heard that Chu Feng would be stepping on the talent assessment platform, so they were curious to know what his results would be. After all, Chu Feng was recognized to be the most talented disciple in the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect. Some even believed that his talents surpassed Dugu Lingtian, considering how he had broken many of the latter’s records.

“Brother Chu Feng, you’re back.”

Duan Liufeng belatedly arrived after the entire area had gotten crowded. His expression hinted that his lateness might have been intentional.

He took out a spirit formation key and unlocked the barrier around the talent assessment platform.

“Brother Duan, is there anything I need to take note of?” Chu Feng asked.

“There’s no need for that. You can step right onto the platform,” Duan Liufeng said.

Chu Feng began making his way to the talent assessment formation, but he suddenly halted halfway through. He took out a formation that contained a world inside of it. This was the place where Yaoyao had been staying over the last few days.

Just a moment ago, Yaoyao expressed a strong intent to come out from the world.

“Yaoyao, do you wish to try the talent assessment formation?”

As soon as Chu Feng opened the formation, Yaoyao dashed out and made a beeline for the talent assessment formation.

Woosh!

Black gaseous flames rose from the talent assessment formation, swiftly shrouding the entire sky. It clashed against the phenomenon of blood-red aura caused by Zi Ling, almost as if two forces were vying for supremacy.

“What incredible talent that is! Even Wen Xue isn’t a match for her!”

“Yaoyao is actually that amazing?”

Many in the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect had seen Yaoyao when the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster first brought her back, but they didn’t think that she would actually be that talented.

Those who were present had all tried out the talent assessment formation, which was why they knew how amazing it was for Yaoyao to have induced such a phenomenon.

“Daddy!”

As soon as the assessment was over, Yaoyao ran back to Chu Feng’s side. At the same time, the black gaseous flames that previously covered the sky dissipated into thin air, leaving behind just the blood-red aura phenomenon caused by Zi Ling.

However, everyone’s eyes turned toward Chu Feng. The surroundings suddenly fell deathly silent. Everyone was waiting with bated breaths to see what kind of phenomenon Chu Feng would induce. They wondered how it would compare to Yaoyao and Wen Xue.

Before everyone’s anticipating eyes, Chu Feng leaped upward and landed on the talent assessment formation.

Tzlala!

Lightning crackled from the talent assessment formation before bolting toward the sky.

“My gosh!”

Everyone except for Chu Feng became dumbstruck. They saw vague silhouettes of nine massive lightning beasts in the sky. None of them had shown their true appearances, but every single one of their auras was devastatingly powerful. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The blood-red aura phenomenon vanished without a trace, completely covered by the one triggered by Chu Feng.

After the initial shock, many among the crowd started to shudder in fear. Even those from the older generation were drenched in cold sweat. Their bodies started to tremble uncontrollably.

The nine lightning beasts were so powerful that they felt like mere ants in comparison. They knew that it was just a phenomenon, but they couldn’t help but worry that they would be killed by it.

Boom!

The talent assessment platform started to shudder intensely. The crowd could sense another equally strong power gushing out from the platform, ready to rush into the sky.

“Could it be that there’s more to Chu Feng’s talents?”

The crowd was horrified to realize that there was more to Chu Feng’s talents than just the nine lightning beasts.
