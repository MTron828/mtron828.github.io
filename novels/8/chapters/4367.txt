Chapter 4367: Inhuman

“You better make sure that you kill me through and through today, or else I’ll make sure that every single one of you will pay the bitter price for your actions,” Chu Feng spat coldly through his gritted teeth.

“You still want to go with that tough talk, huh? Let’s see how long you can keep it up!”

Without any hesitation, Senior Ma began driving another wave of blades toward Chu Feng once again.

At the same time, the other disciples present also used their own means to assault Chu Feng too.

In an instant, all sorts of sharp blades, terrifying venomous bugs, and toxic poison came flying in Chu Feng’s direction.

The sheer destructive power amassed here was enough to tear an army apart, but all of these attacks were currently aimed at a single person—Chu Feng.

The venomous bugs entered his body and chewed on his innards, the lethal poison sunk into his body and corroded his soul, the weapons wreaked havoc and destroyed his body...

But despite all of this, Chu Feng clenched his jaws tightly and held himself back from making any noise. He didn’t even blink his eyes in the face of such suffering.

It was not that he didn’t feel any pain. In truth, he could barely tolerate it at all.

Had it been on any other occasion, he would have cried in agony by now to distract himself from the pain. However, he was holding it all back with his sheer willpower at this moment.

He was holding on for his dignity.

Even upon death, he wouldn’t let himself be undermined by this bunch of human trash.

“Is this fellow a monster?”

After using all of the means they had on their disposal, the disciples realized that they weren’t able to make Chu Feng concede at all. Their antagonism toward him hadn’t abated in the least, but at the same time, they were starting to get a little frightened by his tenacity

In their view, even the toughest cultivator should have already given in to the pain by now, but Chu Feng was still enduring it all without letting out a squeak.

This was all unbelievable to them. They couldn’t begin to fathom just what kind of person would be capable of tolerating all of this. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

From the start to the end, Chu Feng’s unyielding eyes had been glaring at them ferociously. The look in his eyes really jolted their souls, making some of them dare not look back at him.

“What are you glaring at? I’ll gouge your eyes out!”

At this moment, Senior Ma let loose a roar and directed his blade toward Chu Feng’s eyes.

Pu pu!

Two spurt of blood splattered across the air as a tragic sight occurred.

The blades had pierced through Chu Feng’s left and right eyes just like that.

But despite so, Chu Feng still didn’t let out a sound at all. Instead, he suddenly began roaring in laughter, “Hahahaha!”

He was tortured to the point where it was hard to tell that he was a human anymore, but despite being in such a situation, he was actually laughing.

Even though the laughter was a little feeble, it sounded bone-chilling to those listening to it. Fear had clutched their hearts, and it was telling them that the person before them was a devil.

There was no human who could possibly endure all of this.

“S-Senior Ma, l-let’s kill him...”

“Yes, we should kill this fellow! To avoid any accidents from happening, we should get rid of him as quickly as possible!”

Fear had already overtaken their desire to torture Chu Feng, and at this point in time, they just want to do away with him as quickly as possible.

They were afraid of the vengeance Chu Feng would unleash upon them if he were to somehow escape from here alive. The only thing that could reassure them right now was his death.

The only thing was that none of them dared to make the killing blow, so they turned to Senior Ma in hopes that he could do it.

“We should have handed you over to the Supreme Elders to deal with, but you are simply too vile. Today, I shall send you away with my own hands! Etch it into your mind, the person who is going to kill you is me, Ma Chengying!”

After saying those words, Ma Chengying began to maneuver his weapons once more to assault Chu Feng. But this time, his aim wasn’t just to inflict pain on Chu Feng.

He was going to utterly crush Chu Feng’s soul and take his life away!

Shoosh shoosh shoosh!

Countless flying blades pierced through where Chu Feng was, leaving behind an incredibly gruesome scene.

But in the next moment, all of the disciples of the Soaring Flower Gazebo, including Ma Chengying, jolted in shock.

To their astonishment, they realized that Chu Feng had disappeared right before their eyes.

It wasn’t just his aura that had vanished. Even his body had suddenly disappeared into thin air.

“W-where is he?”

“Senior Ma, you killed him, right? Say something!”

The disciples were all panicked. This was the worst-case scenario for them—Chu Feng escaping with his life.

And at this very moment, the look on Ma Chengying’s face was incredibly awful too.

In truth, Ma Chengying was only putting on a brave front previously. He was also extremely afraid of Chu Feng as well, but it was the proper procedure to hand Chu Feng over to the Supreme Elders to investigate the matter, so he had been keeping the latter alive thus far.

That being said, as soon as someone proposed the idea to kill Chu Feng, he still decided to go with it right away because that was the only way his mind could be put at ease.

However, what he was worried about still happened in the end.

Unlike the others, he knew full well that his earlier attack didn’t strike anything at all. Even though he didn’t see how Chu Feng managed to escape, he knew for certain that Chu Feng had really managed to get away.

“Senior Ma, did you miss him? That can’t be right...”

“I-it can’t be that he really managed to escape, right?”

Seeing the look on Ma Chengying’s face, the other disciples of the Soaring Flower Gazebo immediately realized that there was something amiss with the situation. Some of them were so scared that they began to tremble uncontrollably.

“I have really underestimated that fellow. To think that he would be able to get away despite falling into such a state...” Ma Chengying muttered nervously.

“What should we do then? He’ll surely exact vengeance on us!”

“We have to leave this place right now! It won’t be safe for us to remain here.”

“We should report this to the elders. Since things have already gotten to this point, we shouldn’t hesitate anymore!”

The frightful looks on the faces of the crowd grew more and more vivid, and some people had even begun shouting hysterically. They had completely lost their composure.

They knew that things had really blown up this time around, and if they didn’t take action right now, they could very well lose their lives. They knew that they would be punished for interrupting the elders at this crucial moment, but they had no choice but to do so.

After all, Chu Feng’s means were simply too scary.

Besides, he was here for the treasure too.

Under such circumstances, they would also be making a huge mistake if they didn’t inform the elders of this matter.

So, after much contemplation, the disciples headed toward one of the formation cores where one of the elders was at.

The elder inside this formation core was no ordinary elder. He was one of the Supreme Elders of their Soaring Flower Gazebo, as well as the strongest cultivator on this mountain range at the moment.

“Ma Chengying, are you certain that the Chu Feng you spoke about fled through some special means?”

After being informed of the matter, the Supreme Elder asked Ma Chengying with an uncertain tone.

“Supreme Elder, I am willing to swear on my life that there’s no falsehood in my words. These juniors here can vouch for that. That fellow has really bizarre means, making him a difficult adversary to deal with. Otherwise, we wouldn’t have dared interrupt you for this matter.”

After Ma Chengying said these words, the other disciples also quickly nodded in agreement too.

“Look at your cowardly faces. You have really thrown the face of our Soaring Flower Gazebo this time around!”

But who could have thought that after learning about the incident, the Supreme Elder of the Soaring Flower Gazebo would ridicule them coldly instead?

“So what if he possesses bizarre means? How formidable could he get? If he’s really strong enough to kill all of you, would he have kept you alive till now? Would you still have been able to get here to report this matter to me?” the Supreme Elder asked coldly.
