Chapter 4540: Gathering of Peers

“What are you saying? Do you think of me as a vicious old witch who goes around killing the innocent? Putting aside the fact I’m not such a person, even if I am, I still wouldn’t touch them. Do you know why?” asked Long Xiaoxiao.

“That’s because you’re a kind princess,” replied Chu Feng.

“Pui. I’m not kind at all.”

Long Xiaoxiao pouted. She didn’t like anyone describing her as kind.

“Then why is it so?” asked Chu Feng curiously.

“That’s because I’m afraid that you’ll get angry. You might not care about how I feel, but I care about how you feel.”

As Long Xiaoxiao said those words, the indignance from before reappeared on her face.

“Ah...”

Chu Feng found himself at a loss of words. He really had no idea how he should face Long Xiaoxiao’s feelings.

“What are you ah-ing for? You know the feelings I have for you, but you’re still trying to speak up for other women before me. You’re really... making light of the feelings I have for you! Hmph, you better reflect on it! Or else, you might really lose me!”

Long Xiaoxiao waved her hands before leaving in a huff.

Her attitude was a little different this time. She was not only indignant, but she was maddened too.

“This...”

Chu Feng was a little surprised by this situation. The Long Xiaoxiao in his impression wasn’t a person who would be angered easily. No matter how he treated her, she would usually respond to him with a smile.

But thinking back, it looked more like she didn’t dare to get angry, as if she was afraid that she would displease Chu Feng. For the longest time, she had placed herself in a humble position before Chu Feng.

As such, it was perplexing to Chu Feng why she would fly into a rage when all he did was to remind her not to hurt Long Ning and the others.

“Ah, it’s truly hard to figure out the mind of a woman.”

Chu Feng shook his head helplessly.

He always found it much harder to deal with women than men. No matter how good his relations with his brothers were, they would never fall in love with him. However, it was different when it came to women.

Many of them ended up developing feelings for him, such that he often found himself in a position where he didn’t know what he should do.

...

The war chariots of the Dragon Clan continued to race across the air with an incredible speed.

Soon, Chu Feng and the others finally arrived at the agreed upon Coiling Dragon Snow Mountain. There, those from the Cloudsky Immortal Sect, Monstrous Herd Temple, and Yu Heavenly Clan had already been waiting for a long time.

Chu Feng saw many familiar faces amongst them. Most of the elders that Chu Feng knew of were here.

And as for those from the same generation, there was Kui Wudi, Bao Yue, Yu Lie, Yu Hong, Yu Yin, Yin Daifen, Fu Feiyue, and the others.

They were all the most skilled juniors of the Holy Light Galaxy, so it was expected that they would participate in this tournament.

“Young master Chu Feng, we finally meet once more! You don’t know how much I miss you ever since we parted at the Nine Souls Galaxy. Sometimes, I’d even see you in my dreams!”

Yin Daifen was extremely passionate when she met Chu Feng, and she acted as if they were close with one another.

“You sure know how to dream,” remarked Long Xiaoxiao.

Her sarcasm in his words was clear for everyone to hear, but Yin Daifen acted as if she didn’t sense it at all. She continued looking at Chu Feng warmly, as if she was looking at her own lover.

Chu Feng knew deep well what kind of person Yin Daifen was, so he didn’t pay any heed to her. At the same time, he couldn’t help but wonder how someone as nice as Yin Zhuanghong would end up having such a scheming little sister.

“Young master Chu Feng, please follow me. I have a surprise prepared for you,” Yin Daifen said as she tugged Chu Feng’s arm.

“What are you doing?!”

Long Xiaoxiao grew agitated upon seeing Yin Daifen’s actions.

Yet, who could have thought that Yin Daifen would pay no heed to Long Xiaoxiao at all. She continued pulling Chu Feng along with her.

Klang—

It was then that a cold glint of light flashed across the air. Long Xiaoxiao had actually drawn her sword and pointed it at Yin Daifen!

“Xiaoxiao, don’t be disrespectful!”

Sensing the tension in the air, the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief immediately bellowed at Long Xiaoxiao to stop.

Given the current close ties the Dragon Clan had with the Cloudsky Immortal Sect, it was extremely inappropriate for Long Xiaoxiao to draw her sword on Yin Daifen.

However, Long Xiaoxiao had no intention to back down, even if it was on her father’s command.

“Yin Daifen, let go of my little benefactor right now or else I’ll get nasty on you!” Long Xiaoxiao threatened coldly.

Yin Daifen, on the other hand, shrugged away Long Xiaoxiao’s threat with a chuckle, saying, “Why should I let go just because you say so? Who do you think you are to Chu Feng?”

Those words made Long Xiaoxiao fly into a greater state of rage. She pierced her sword forth to attack Yin Daifen.

However, her sword was stopped right after. Her father, the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief, had intervened in the situation.

“Miss Xiaoxiao, please calm down. Yin Daifen has really prepared a small surprise for young friend Chu Feng,” another voice sounded in the air.

It was a Supreme Elder from the Cloudsky Immortal Sect.

As domineering as Long Xiaoxiao was, she knew better than to snub the words from a Cloudsky Immortal Sect’s Supreme Elder, so she retracted her blade.

Nevertheless, she still looked at Yin Daifen with a displeased look and said, “Just come clean with whatever surprise you have. Is there a need for you to hug my little benefactor like that? Miss Yin, you should have some self-respect.”

Those words seemed to have awakened Chu Feng as he quickly swung aside Yin Daifen’s hand. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

However, Yin Daifen didn’t lose her temper at Chu Feng’s reaction. Instead, she directed a sweet smile toward him.

Even though her character was not worth a mention, she did have a pleasing appearance to look at.

“Young master Chu Feng, you’ll know once we get there.”

Yin Daifen soared into the sky as she spoke, and Chu Feng, after a moment of hesitation, decided to follow suit.

Of course, there was no way Long Xiaoxiao would allow Yin Daifen to be alone with Chu Feng, so she tagged along too.

As the Cloudsky Immortal Sect was the first one to arrive here, they set up a few palaces on top of this Coiling Dragon Snow Mountain so that everyone could rest comfortably.

The place where Yin Daifen brought Chu Feng to was the most majestic palace of all.

This palace was not built out of spirit power. Rather, it was a high-level treasure that prevented even Chu Feng from seeing through what was within.

Yin Daifen landed at the entrance of the palace, but she didn’t head in. Instead, she stood at the doorway and said, “Young master Chu Feng, the surprise is inside. You can head in and have a look for yourself.”

Without standing on ceremony, Chu Feng walked up to the doors of the palace and opened them.

In the moment that the doors were opened, what unfolded before Chu Feng’s eyes was not a palace but a beautiful garden with blooming flowers and chirpy birds.

There were many people standing in the midst of the garden, and they were all familiar faces to Chu Feng.

They were all from the Red-dress Holy Land. Even the sectmaster of the Red-dress Holy Land, Han Xiu, was here too!

Most notably of all though, there was one person who was dressed in the robes of the Cloudsky Immortal Sect despite being affiliated with the Red-dress Holy Land.

And this person was Yin Zhuanghong.

From the moment that Chu Feng saw Yin Zhuanghong, Han Xiu, and the others gathered here, indescribable joy flooded his heart.

He recalled how the Cloudsky Immortal Sect had forcefully taken Yin Zhuanghong with them back then, causing Han Xiu and everyone else in the Red-dress Holy Land to fly into a fluster.

No one could have expected that a day would come where those from the Red-dress Holy Land would be hailed as esteemed guests by the Cloudsky Immortal Sect.

Of course, the reason why Han Xiu and the others were treated in such a manner was mostly due to Yin Zhuanghong’s credit. After all, Yin Zhuanghong was now the treasure of the Cloudsky Immortal Sect.

At the same time, Chu Feng could sense that Yin Zhuanghong had managed to advance her cultivation considerably.
