Chapter 4579: Interested In Long Xiaoxiao

In the days to come, Chu Feng tried thinking of all sorts of ways to breach the formation made up of Niantian Energy inside his body...

Amidst those days, Yu Lie and the others obtained their rewards and took their leave from the Holy Light Clan. In the end, the only ones left behind were just Long Xiaoxiao and Chu Feng.

Long Xiaoxiao would drop by Chu Feng’s palace almost every single day. The Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief had told her to restrain herself a little, but his advice fell on deaf ears. Long Xiaoxiao was as obstinate as a bull when it came to matters concerning Chu Feng.

Five days after the banquet ended, Long Xiaoxiao’s parents were visited by a representative of the Holy Light Clan in the palace they were resting in.

The representative was a graceful old woman who went by the name of Shengguang Yunyue. Not only was she a Martial Exalted level expert, but she was also a Supreme Elder of the Holy Light Clan.

She could be said to be one of the few figures in the Holy Light Clan who were only second to Shengguang Xuanye in terms of strength and standing.

Even the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief wouldn’t dare to show any disrespect to Shengguang Yunyue, not to mention that the latter had come with Long Xiaoxiao’s reward for the tournament.

The reward was an exquisite urn. The urn wasn’t too big, but it was a treasure originating from the Ancient Era. The urn was already valuable as it was, but even more so was the golden fluid that flowed within the urn.

Holy Light Bloodline Essence.

“Lord Yunyue. This... Is this really the reward intended for Xiaoxiao? Could you have made a mistake?”

The Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief was excited to see the contents of the urn, but he couldn’t help but feel a little skeptical about this.

It was known that the reward for the champion of the tournament was the Holy Light Bloodline Essence. Given that Long Xiaoxiao had gotten second place instead, this reward shouldn’t have belonged to her.

At the very least, Yu Lie, who had left earlier, didn’t have the privilege to obtain this too.

“It couldn’t be helped that the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief was feeling so iffy about this, for the Holy Light Bloodline Essence was indeed an invaluable treasure.

“Typically speaking, Princess Xiaoxiao’s reward wouldn’t have been the Holy Light Bloodline Essence. However, our Lord Clan Chief is highly satisfied with Princess Xiaoxiao’s performance in the tournament, so he decided to raise the reward that she is entitled to,” Shengguang Yunyue explained with a smile.

“Thank you, Lord Yunyue. Thank you, Lord Xuanye.”

After confirming that the reward was indeed intended for Long Xiaoxiao, the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief was extremely agitated. He could hardly restrain the smile bursting on his lips.

He had been worried all this while that Long Xiaoxiao would face great pressure from the Holy Light Clan after revealing the prowess of her bloodline. From the looks of it now, it seemed like the Holy Light Clan had no intention of harming Long Xiaoxiao or the Dragon Clan.

In other words, what the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief delighted by was not the reward itself but the attitude of the Holy Light Clan.

“Where’s Princess Xiaoxiao? Is she together with young hero Chu Feng right now?” Shenguang Yunyue suddenly asked.

“Indeed. Xiaoxiao has a childlike personality, and she likes to hang out together with her friends. Everyone else has already left except for Chu Feng, so she has no one else to look for but him,” the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief explained with a smile.

“Is that so?”

Shengguang Yunyue asked as her eyes narrowed sharply, and her lips curled into an unreadable smile.

“I heard that Princess Xiaoxiao hasn’t been anywhere else over the last few days other than Chu Feng’s place. Furthermore, back at the Storm Combat Dragon Ring, Princess Xiaoxiao was initially intending to surrender to the black-robed man, only to choose to carry on the fight due to the black-robed man insulting Chu Feng.

“Based on what I see, Princess Xiaoxiao doesn’t seem to view Chu Feng as an ordinary friend?”

Shengguang Yunyue looked at the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief with a deep look in her eyes.

“Lord Yunyue, you have misunderstood. I don’t deny that Xiaoxiao and Chu Feng are close with one another, but their feelings for one another aren’t that of lovers. It’s just that Chu Feng has once saved Xiaoxiao, so she feels indebted to him,” the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief hurriedly clarified.

“Is that true?” Shengguang Yunyue asked.

“Absolutely,” the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief replied affirmatively.

“That’s good news. To be honest with you, the talent that Princess Xiaoxiao has displayed on the Storm Combat Dragon Ring has caught the fancy of many of our clan’s young masters, including young master Shengguang Yu is no exception. In fact, even our Clan Chief is full of praises for Princess Xiaoxiao.

“However, our Holy Light Clan wouldn’t stoop so low as to force Princess Xiaoxiao into marrying one of our people. If I could just offer you a word of advice, Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief, I think that you should grasp this opportunity. There are no parents in the world who don’t worry about their children, and I believe that there’s no one more qualified to wed Princess Xiaoxiao than the prodigies of our Holy Light Clan.”

Shengguang Yunyue patted the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief’s shoulders meaningfully before leaving together with the others.

After Shengguang Yunyue left the palace, Long Xiaoxiao’s mother turned to the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief and asked, “What does she mean by that?”

“You can’t tell? The Holy Light Clan is interested in Xiaoxiao and wants her to marry into their clan!” the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief said with a smile, delighted by how things were turning out.

Someone with the wits of Long Xiaoxiao’s mother couldn’t possibly have not understood what Shengguang Yunyue said. It was just that she was hoping it wasn’t what she was thinking. In her view, it wasn’t good for Long Xiaoxiao to get involved with the Holy Light Clan.

Thus, after hearing what the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief said, a frown formed on her forehead.

“What should we do?”

“What else can we do? Get Xiaoxiao to stay away from Chu Feng. Xiaoxiao listens to you better, so you should have a talk with her about this,” the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief told Long Xiaoxiao’s mother.

“That won’t do. Can’t you see the feelings that Xiaoxiao harbors for Chu Feng? All I wish for her is to live a blissful life with the man she loves. As for her marriage, I think that she has the right to make the choice on her own. I shan’t interfere in her decision,” Long Xiaoxiao’s mother spoke adamantly.

“Preposterous! Do you think that I want Xiaoxiao to marry into the Holy Light Clan? Xiaoxiao has already revealed the prowess of her bloodline for Chu Feng! Do you really not know why Yu Lie’s cultivation has stagnated over the years?

“Xiaoxiao’s performance at that tournament surpasses even Yu Lie! The Holy Light Clan would never let her off! However, if Xiaoxiao were to marry into their clan, she would become of their own. Naturally, they wouldn’t do anything to harm her anymore..

“I’m not just thinking about the future of the Dragon Clan here. More than that, I’m also thinking about what’s best for Long Xiaoxiao. This is the only way she can keep her life!” the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“But...”

Long Xiaoxiao’s mother was in a fluster too.

It went without saying that she hoped that Long Xiaoxiao could be happy, but more than that, she hoped for Long Xiaoxiao to remain safe.

“There are no buts. The Holy Light Clan has already made their intentions very clear. Xiaoxiao must become one of their people, or else the consequences will be dire.

“I thought that Xiaoxiao would be doomed this time around, but who could have thought that the Holy Light Clan was willing to accept her. This is really a huge stroke of luck, and we can’t let this opportunity slip past our fingers!” the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“Is it possible that you’re overthinking it? Are the hearts of the Holy Light Clan really that narrow as to not allow any prodigies to surpass those of the Holy Light Clan’s?” Long Xiaoxiao’s mother asked.

“You don’t understand. How many overlords in this world are truly magnanimous? Yu Lie is already the perfect example. If not for the fact that Yu Lie no longer poses a threat to them, do you think that he would still be living to this day?” the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“But if what you have just said is true, doesn’t that mean that young friend Chu Feng is in deep danger?” Long Xiaoxiao’s mother asked worriedly.

“Young friend Chu Feng has shown an edge that even the Holy Light Clan is apprehensive of, so there’s no way they would spare him under normal circumstances. However, he has strong backings that even the Holy Light Clan has to think twice before offending.

“In my opinion, the Holy Light Clan’s attitude toward Chu Feng would really depend on how much they know about him. So, I can’t really say for certain how things will end up.”

“However, our Xiaoxiao isn’t the same as young friend Chu Feng. She doesn’t have an unfathomable background unlike him, so there’s only one path she can take—marrying into the Holy Light Clan. That’s the only way she can really remain safe,” the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief said.Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates
