Chapter 2597 - Extremely Astonishing

In the desert outside the Unknown Burial Ground.

An enormous construction had covered the entire region. It was a pyramid-like construction. It covered an area several tens of thousands of meters across. It was truly an enormous monster of an item. Like an enormous palace, it sat on the desert.

That said, that enormous construction was not an actual entity, as it was transparent.

As for what it was... it was the completed grand formation that everyone had spent the last several days setting up.

At this moment, everyone present was standing around that enormous spirit formation. Their gazes were fixed onto the summit of that grand formation.

There were two figures standing there. They were the crucial people for activating this grand formation.

One of them was Ying Mingchao, who had just rushed here. The other person was the person who had arrived with Ying Mingchao. In other words, the person that Ying Mingchao had gone to search for.

This person was someone that the people present did not know of.

She was a woman. She had a youthful and pretty appearance. Furthermore, the aura that she emitted was actually that of a rank two True Immortal.

Her cultivation had earned the reverence of the crowd. After all, rank two True Immortals were the apex level of cultivation in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.

At this moment, the crowd finally realized why someone like Ying Mingchao had to personally go and request the assistance of this individual. Merely by this woman’s cultivation, the crowd knew that she was no small matter.

However, very few people knew who she was. Thus, the crowd present started to gasp in admiration at the fact that there was actually a hidden expert like her in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.

As for this woman, she was actually none other than Zi Xunyi.

When Zi Xunyi left the Kong Heavenly Clan, she had brought back the corpse of the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief to the Demon Elimination Cave.

Seeing that their clan chief was dead, the people from the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan all felt that his death was caused by Zi Xunyi.

However, Zi Xunyi’s strength surpassed all of theirs. Thus, even though they deeply detested Zi Xunyi, they were unable to do anything to her.

That said, Zi Xunyi herself also felt that she had caused the death of the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief. Thus, she set up a grand formation and used it to torture and punish herself. She wanted to torture herself to death.

If it wasn’t for Ying Mingchao’s arrival, Zi Xunyi would likely have died in her grand formation.

Although Ying Mingchao had saved her, Zi Xunyi had no intention of thanking Ying Mingchao. Instead, she said to him coldly, “If you dare lie to me, I will hate you for eternity.”

“Xunyi, I am truly not lying. Chu Feng is indeed trapped in the Unknown Burial Ground,” Ying Mingchao said.

At this moment, Ying Mingchao was still feeling trauma. His emotions were very complicated.

He still remembered the situation inside the Demon Elimination Cave, the situation in the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan’s territory.

Zi Xunyi’s situation was truly miserable. She was extremely weak, and at death’s door. Most importantly... Zi Xunyi was doing that of her own accord.

If it wasn’t for Chu Feng being in trouble that managed to stir up Zi Xunyi’s emotions, Ying Mingchao would likely not have been able to prevent Zi Xunyi from committing suicide.

“It will be up to this to decide whether you’re lying or not.”

Zi Xunyi took out an item. It was a jade pendant.

However, it was only half of a jade pendant.

After that, Ying Mingchao also took out a half jade pendant. He handed it to Zi Xunyi. When the two halves were placed together, they formed a completed jade pendant.

Ying Mingchao looked thoughtfully at the two halves of the jade pendant. Only Zi Xunyi and him knew that those two jade pendants were their engagement keepsakes.

At the same time, those jade pendant halves were also the crucial items to activating the spirit formation.

“Buzz~~~”

Right at this moment, Zi Xunyi placed the two jade pendant halves together. Then, she placed the completed jade pendant onto the spirit formation.

After that, both Zi Xunyi and Ying Mingchao began to form different hand seals. They were jointly activating the jade pendant.

“Buzz~~~”

The next moment, complicated veined patterns appeared on the jade pendant and integrated with the spirit formation.

As more and more veined patterns assimilated into the grand spirit formation, the grand spirit formation started to shine brightly. It had been activated.

“The crystal,” Ying Mongchao spoke loudly. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Here,” Hearing that, the guardian clan’s clan chief immediately handed the crystal that could detect Chu Feng’s current state to Ying Mingchao.

Ying Mingchao placed that crystal above the jade pendant.

The next moment, the grand formation that was originally radiating with light grew completely dark. It was as if all of the light from earlier had disappeared.

“Buzz~~~”

Soon, a golden radiance emerged from the summit of the grand spirit formation.

That golden radiance shot into the sky and began to spread around, illuminating the sky into a dazzling brightness.

Gradually, the radiance stopped being so eye-dazzling.

“That is?”

Seeing that, the crowd all revealed extremely astonished expressions.

They were able to see an image from the radiance in the sky. It was a grand formation. Merely by seeing it with their naked eyes, they were able to tell that it was an exceptionally grand formation.

That grand formation was simply enormous. What appeared in the sky was merely the tip of the iceberg.

Most importantly, the crowd were able to see a figure in the center of that image. That person was none other than Chu Feng.

“How could this be? He... how did he arrive there already?”

“Didn’t you say that he had only just entered the Gates of Hell?” Zi Xunyi asked in a very emotional manner.

Ying Mingchao also revealed a confused expression. Thus, he turned to the guardian clan’s clan chief and asked, “Is there a mistake to the time you informed me?”

“No, I told you when Chu Feng entered the Unknown Burial Ground truthfully. Since you’ve told me that it concerns Chu Feng’s safety, how could I possibly lie about it?” The guardian clan’s clan chief explained.

“He actually managed to pass the two checkpoints, the Gates of Hell and the Soul-extracting Cave this quickly to enter the Life and Death Formation.”

“Chu Feng... exactly how did he accomplish that?” At this moment, the astonishment in Ying Mingchao’s eyes grew even stronger.

Seeing that Ying Mingchao had not lied to her, Zi Xunyi also revealed the same sort of astonished expression.

Only the two of them knew what sorts of places the Gates of Hell and the Soul-extracting Cave were, as they had personally experienced them.

They felt that it would be impossible for Chu Feng to be able to pass through those two checkpoints in succession in such a short period of time.

However, Chu Feng had accomplished it.

That was the reason why they were so astonished.
