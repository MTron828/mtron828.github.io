Chapter 3880 - Treasures Snatched

“What? Ten times?”

The expressions of the All-heaven Sect’s elders all changed enormously upon hearing those words.

They all knew what sort of reward Grandmaster Huang had demanded before.

It was an extremely generous reward to begin with. Yet, he was actually demanding ten times the amount. This was simply too excessive.

His demand was simply highway robbery.

“I am using my life to help you all. Asking for ten times the reward is not excessive at all.”

“Elder Tuoba, you can mull it over. If you’re unwilling to pay that much, it doesn’t matter either. After all, didn’t you all request that person’s help too?”

“You can ask that person to come and help you.” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

As Grandmaster Huang spoke, he looked to the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted’s war chariot with a mocking smile on his face.

“Very well. Grandmaster Huang, I accept your condition.”

“However, the reward that you’ve requested is simply too extraordinary. Even for me, I will need some time to gather it.”

“However, I guarantee you that once this matter is settled, I will definitely give you your reward.” Tuoba Chengan actually accepted Grandmaster Huang’s condition.

“Very well. However, before we can establish the real entrance, I might need some more people to sacrifice themselves,” as Grandmaster Huang spoke, he looked to the army of black-clothed people standing behind them.

“Is a hundred thousand sufficient?” asked Tuoba Chengan.

Hearing those words, the black-clothed people all trembled. In fact, even the expressions of the people from the All-heaven Sect changed enormously.

They were going to use the lives of a hundred thousand people to test for danger?

This was simply too cruel.

“No no, there’s no need for that many. If this old man is still unable to open the real entrance within ten thousand people, this old man is willing to return all the rewards," after saying those words, Grandmaster Huang began to use the compass to set up another spirit formation.

However, this time around, he did not immediately use his spirit formation to breach the Great Monster Slayer Emperor Tomb’s spirit formation.

Instead, he used his spirit formation to shut the entrance he had opened earlier.

It was only after that that he opened another spirit formation entrance.

After opening the entrance, he took out a hundred talisman papers like he had before. The hundred talisman papers were handed to a hundred black-clothed individuals. Then, those hundred black-clothed individuals all entered the entrance to use their lives to explore the insides.

Soon, Grandmaster Huang shook his head again. Then, he began to repeat his previous actions.

He first shut the spirit formation entrance, and then opened a new one.

Seeing that, the people from the All-heaven Sect were confused.

If the location where the entrance was opened was incorrect, they could very well open a new location.

However, Grandmaster Huang was not doing that. Instead, after closing the previous location, he opened a new entrance in the same place.

It was only after Grandmaster Huang explained his actions to them that the people from the All-heaven Sect understood what was going on.

That location was the place with the greatest flaws. Thus, they must open the entrance there.

As for the reason why he was repeatedly opening entrances there, it was because the Great Monster Slayer Emperor had left multiple entrances there.

Of them, there was only a single correct entrance, the life gate, where one could live, whereas the rest were all dead ends, death gates.

Grandmaster Huang was repeating his actions so that he could find the life gate.

“This so-called Grandmaster Huang is simply useless.”

“What does he mean there are a lot of death gates? There’s clearly only two entrances.”

“One entrance leads to the actual Great Monster Slayer Emperor’s Tomb.”

“As for the other one, it leads to the place with the Ancient Era’s organisms.”

“Just because he is incapable of opening the actual entrance, he said that there’s multiple death gates. That man is simply a swindler.”

“Most importantly, he’s using so many lives to probe things. That man is simply too shameless!”

The Mystic Cave Saints were still observing the situation outside with their spirit formation mirror.

They were expressing great disdain towards Grandmaster Huang’s behavior.

“Big brother, that Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted is not doing anything, and that Grandmaster Huang is completely useless.”

“Furthermore, for some treasures in this Great Monster Slayer Emperor’s Tomb, even we would not be able to open them. We happen to need the treasures that the All-heaven Sect possesses. We need them to come in and help us.”

“However, it wouldn’t do for us to continue to wait like this. Should we secretly help that Grandmaster Huang so that he will quickly open the actual entrance, so that they can enter this place and open the treasures so that we can snatch them away?” asked Eleventh.

“Mn. That Grandmaster Huang is completely useless, we should secretly help him.”

The Mystic Cave Saints did not hesitate after making their decision. They began to use the power they’d obtained to secretly help that Grandmaster Huang.

With the help from the Mystic Cave Saints, Grandmaster Huang finally succeeded in opening the entrance to the Great Monster Slayer Emperor’s Tomb.

After confirming that things were safe, Grandmaster Huang, with the treasure given to him by the All-heaven Sect, stepped into the Great Monster Slayer Emperor’s Tomb with the many experts from the All-heaven Sect.

Even though they’d ultimately succeeded in opening the Great Monster Slayer Emperor’s Tomb, Tuoba Chengan stood outside, and did not enter.

The reason why he did not directly enter was because he was worried that the inside would be too dangerous, and he might end up losing his life.

Thus, he would not rashly enter the Great Monster Slayer Emperor’s Tomb. Instead, he had handed all responsibility inside to Grandmaster Huang.

Since his men were following Grandmaster Huang, he was not afraid that Grandmaster Huang might try to snatch those treasures for himself.

Because of that, Tuoba Chengan was still very excited. Finally... he would be able to see the treasures left behind by the Great Monster Slayer Emperor.

“Lord Supreme Elder, this is bad!”

However, not long afterward, elders and disciples from the All-heaven Sect ran back out.

“What happened?”

Seeing their panicking expressions, Tuoba Chengan stepped forward to ask them what had happened.

“Lord Supreme Elder, with the help of Grandmaster Huang, we quickly opened a spirit formation gate to where a treasure was contained. After informing us of how to open that spirit formation, Grandmaster Huang left with other people to the other locations where the treasures are stored.”

“Following the method Grandmaster Huang taught us, we successfully obtained the treasure.”

“However, right after we obtained the treasure, someone immediately appeared and snatched the treasure we had obtained,” said that elder.

“What?! The treasure was snatched away?!”

“How could someone snatch away our treasure?!”

Hearing those words, Tuoba Chengan and the others were all completely confused.

The Great Monster Slayer Emperor’s Tomb had clearly just been opened.

They were clearly the first group of people that had entered the Great Monster Slayer Emperor’s Tomb.

Furthermore, Tuoba Chengan and others had been standing guard outside the entire time.

Apart from the people of the All-heaven Sect and Grandmaster Huang, simply no one was seen entering the Great Monster Slayer Emperor’s Tomb.

Thus, how could there be people snatching their treasure?

“Not only did they snatch our treasure, they even left behind this letter.”

As the elder spoke, he took out a letter and handed it to Tuoba Chengan.

After receiving the letter, Tuoba Chengan’s expression changed. The reason for that was because that letter was addressed to him.

“I shall see who it is that dares to mess with me.”

As Tuoba Chengan spoke, he opened the sealed letter.

“Bang~~~”

However, right after the letter opened, a yellow liquid immediately burst forth.

That yellow liquid did not cause any harm to anyone present. Yet, it emitted a disgusting smell that engulfed the surroundings completely.

That was... the smell of a fart.

“Damn it!”

Tuoba Chengan turned blue with anger.

He knew that he had been pranked.

However, he was unable to think of who it might be that would be so bored as to toy with him like that.

However, upon thinking about it, he felt a sense of deja vu.

“Lord Supreme Elder, this is bad!”

Right at that moment, another group of All-heaven Sect elders ran out of the Great Monster Slayer Emperor’s Tomb.

“What happened to you?” asked Tuoba Chengan.

“Lord Supreme Elder, the treasure we’d just obtained was snatched away by someone.”

“Furthermore, that person left this letter behind to have me hand it to you.”

As that elder spoke, he took out a letter.

Seeing that letter, Tuoba Chengan was so furious that fumes were raging from his nostrils.

He knew that that letter must be another prank. It was no letter at all.

“Lord Supreme Elder, this subordinate is incompetent.”

“Lord Supreme Elder, this is bad!”

“Lord Supreme Elder...”

.........

...

Following that person, more and more elders from the All-heaven Sect began to emerge from the Great Monster Slayer Emperor’s Tomb in succession.

Without exception, they’d all managed to unlock a treasure, but had all gotten their treasures snatched away.

Furthermore, they all rushed out with letters in hand.

All those letters were addressed to Tuoba Chengan.
