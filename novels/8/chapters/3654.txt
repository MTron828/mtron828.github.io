Chapter 3654 - Discrimination?

“Clank~~~”

As sparks scattered everywhere, Nangong Yifan was actually not beaten back in the slightest. He brandished his halberd and swept it towards Chu Feng again.

However, Chu Feng was prepared for his attack. He slashed forth with his Blue Jade Mandarin Duck Sword to confront the incoming halberd.

Nangong Yifan’s attack and Chu Feng’s counterattack collided. The speed of their attacks was so fast that the people of the younger generation were simply unable to see the details. Only during the moments when their weapons collided could the crowd see the two of them.

“Strange. Chu Feng’s battle power far surpasses Nangong Yifan’s. He should also possess absolute dominance in this confrontation of weapons. Why is he not showing any signs of superiority now?” Kong Ci’s eyes were flickering. Confusion filled her face.

“It’s that halberd. Nangong Yifan’s Incomplete Exalted Armament is extremely firm and strong. In a head-on collision, even though they are both Incomplete Exalted Armaments, Chu Feng’s Blue Jade Mandarin Duck Sword would still not be a match.”

“Although the Blue Jade Mandarin Duck Sword is very sharp, it does not possess much superiority in a head-on collision against other weapons, much less against a weapon like Nangong Yifan’s halberd.”

“The reason why Chu Feng is able to not be disadvantaged in a head-on battle between weapons using the Blue Jade Mandarin Duck Sword against Nangong Yifan’s halberd is not because of the power of the Blue Jade Mandarin Duck Sword. Rather, it is fully due to Chu Feng’s battle power.” At that moment, when the crowd were feeling puzzled, Lord Shoujian provided an explanation.

“So that’s the case.” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Nangong Yifan is truly despicable. Because his battle power is inferior, he decided to make up for it with his weapon.”

Kong Ci and the others had looks of displeasure.

“That’s not the case. Young friend Chu Feng’s Blue Jade Mandarin Duck Sword also possesses its own superiority. Not only is it sharp, but it also contains an aura of coldfrost. Should it manage to strike Nangong Yifan even once, the coldfrost aura will spread throughout his body. With that, Nangong Yifan’s movements will become restricted, and the match would be over,” said Lord Shoujian.

Suddenly, Beiyang Luo from the All-heaven Starfield said, “Senior Shoujian, what you said is extremely correct. Merely, I’m afraid that Chu Feng will not have the opportunity to spread that coldfrost aura.”

“Young friend, what might you mean by that?” asked Lord Shoujian.

“Junior brother Nangong has trained in weapons his entire life. He is practically a completely different person when he holds a weapon in his hands.”

“Perhaps Chu Feng might be able to gain a slight advantage over him in a match of fists and feet, but should they fight with weapons, Chu Feng will undoubtedly be defeated.”

Not only did Beiyang Luo provide an explanation, but he was also extremely pleased when he said those words. It was as if he had already seen through everything, and judged that Chu Feng would definitely lose.

After hearing Beiyang Luo’s words, Kong Ci and the others narrowed their brows.

Although Chu Feng’s battle power was very strong, they had fought against Nangong Yifan. Thus, his might was firmly engraved in their hearts. As such, they did not doubt Beiyang Luo’s words in the slightest.

It was precisely because they knew that Nangong Yifan was extremely powerful that they were so worried about Chu Feng.

“Young friend, what you’ve said is incorrect.”

Surprisingly, Lord Shoujian actually denied Beiyang Luo’s claims. Then, he cast his gaze to the younger generations from both the All-heaven Starfield and the Ancestral Martial Starfield, “Young friends, due to being limited by your cultivation, you all are likely unable to see the battle clearly. However, it would be a pity to miss out on this battle.”

“Thus, allow this old man to explain what’s going on in the battle to you,” said Lord Shoujian.

“Very well. In that case, we’ll have to trouble Lord Shoujian,” The people of the younger generation were overjoyed upon hearing those words.

It was as Lord Shoujian had said, they were simply unable to clearly see the details of the match between Chu Feng and Nangong Yifan. Although they were fortunate enough to be present for their battle, they were simply unable to witness its marvelousness. Inevitably, it would cause them to feel somewhat regretful.

If Lord Shoujian was capable of explaining things to them, it would be exactly what they wanted.

Sensing the anticipating gazes from the people of the younger generation, Lord Shoujian did not beat around the bush, and began to explain the situation of the battle to them.

“Young friend Nangong Yifan’s usage of his halberd has certainly reached a superb mastery. Not to mention the people of the younger generation, even those who have trained for thousands of years rarely possess such superb mastery over their weapons. Likely... this is his talent.”

“Talent is truly not something that can be made up for by hard work and time.”

After hearing Lord Shoujian’s words, Kong Ci, Kong Tianhui and the others started to worry even more.

However, before they could worry for too long, Lord Shoujian spoke again, “That said, young friend Chu Feng also possesses superb mastery over his weapon. He has reached a state of fusion with his sword. In his hands, the Blue Jade Mandarin Duck Sword is able to unleash its peak might.”

“The way this old man sees it, in terms of mastery over one’s weapon, young friend Chu Feng’s mastery might be of an even higher level than young friend Nangong’s.” said Lord Shoujian.

“Chu Feng is that powerful?” The crowd were all surprised by Lord Shoujian’s words.

Although they all knew that Chu Feng was very powerful, they knew too little about him. Furthermore, even though he had managed to tie with Linghu Hongfei, he had relied on his world spirit to do so, and not his own martial power or cultivation.

Nangong Yifan, on the other hand, was different. He was already renowned for his might. Furthermore, they’d also witnessed Nangong Yifan’s strength during his fight.

Nangong Yifan had managed to defeat five top geniuses from the Ancestral Martial Starfield in a short few bouts all on his own. This fully illustrated how powerful he was.

Even though Chu Feng had managed to gain massive superiority over Nangong Yifan when they were fighting barehanded, they were still very worried about Chu Feng due to how renowned Nangong Yifan was.

Subconsciously, they still felt that Nangong Yifan was stronger than Chu Feng.

That was the reason why they felt so shocked by Lord Shoujian’s words.

“Lord Shoujian, it is naturally not an issue for you to explain the situation of the battle to us. However, please provide your analysis impartially, and do not discriminate in favor of someone from your Ancestral Martial Starfield.”

“Even if we cannot see the details of the battle, we are still able to roughly make out the general situation. The two of them are clearly equally matched. How could you say that Chu Feng is stronger?” Beiyang Luo said with displeasure.

In fact, Beiyang Luo was not the only one feeling that way. Many of the All-heaven Starfield’s younger generation had looks of displeasure on their faces.

They felt that Lord Shoujian was discriminating in favor of Chu Feng, and deliberately smearing Nangong Yifan’s reputation.

“Are you able to see the battle more clearly than this old man?” asked Lord Shoujian.

“For the sake of his Incomplete Exalted Armament, my junior brother Nangong went out of his way to focus on training in halberd techniques. He has already reached a level of fusion with his weapon. As for Chu Feng, he has only just obtained that Blue Jade Mandarin Duck Sword. This is the first time he is using it. Yet, you’re saying that his mastery over his weapon is above my junior brother Nangong’s. If this isn’t discrmination, what is it?” asked Beiyang Luo.

“Truly despicable. He actually focused on training in halberd techniques before. This match is completely unfair,” said Kong Tianhui.

“Indeed, it’s extremely unfair. So much for speaking about fairness. In the end, he’s doing something so unfair. This Nangong Yifan is truly despicable,” Wuming Yuanzhi and the other Ancestral Martial Starfield’s younger generations also began to lash out at Nangong Yifan.

Hearing the crowd’s criticisms, Beiyang Luo’s expression turned ugly.

It was only at that moment that he suddenly realized that he had mentioned what he should not have.

What he did was clearly defaming Nangong Yifan. However, he hadn’t done so on purpose. He was simply unable to tolerate Lord Shoujian discriminating in favor of Chu Feng, and blurted it out by accident.

After all, only this matter could prove that Nangong Yifan’s mastery over his halberd surpassed Chu Feng’s mastery over his sword.
