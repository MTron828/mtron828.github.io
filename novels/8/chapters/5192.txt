Chapter 5192: So What If I Snatch Your Stuff?

Chu Feng plunged deep down into the entrance. There were no obstacles along the way, so it didn’t take him long to reach the bottom of the pit.

However, what appeared before his eyes was different from what he had expected.

He thought that all of the same-category entrances would be linked to a common palace or something, where everyone would undergo the same trial. However, he found himself entering an underground labyrinth instead, and there were no cultivators to be seen in his vicinity.

There were no signs that this labyrinth was manmade, suggesting that it was formed naturally. It was somewhat similar to an ant’s nest, having many passageways that led to all sorts of places.

All of the entrances probably led to this very underground labyrinth, just different parts of it.

Chu Feng tried activating his Heaven’s Eyes to discern to scan his surroundings, but it was to no avail. The cavern had blocked off his Heaven’s Eyes.

Even so, he didn’t lose his composure and took out the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk instead. This was the ultimate treasure to exploring ancient remnants.

The Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk didn’t respond to him.

“What’s going on?” Chu Feng murmured.

He wouldn’t have been surprised if the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk didn’t respond at all since it often chose to respond to him according to its mood. However, the reason Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk didn’t respond this time around was not because it didn’t want to but because it didn’t have the strength to.

In other words, the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk was also sealed off in this space. This showed just how terrifying the person behind this trial was.

“It looks like I only have myself to count on.”

This made things much harder for Chu Feng, but he wasn’t dismayed in the least. Instead, it piqued his excitement as it showed just how powerful the demonic beast sealed here was. This meant that the fortuitous encounter might be greater than he had expected.

In the first place, the world spiritist behind this wouldn’t have bothered setting up a trial if the fortuitous encounter was no big deal.

There were no clues where Chu Feng should head, so he tried blindly exploring the area first. Along the way, he encountered a faint blue light. Upon coming closer, he noticed a blue rock embedded into the cavern wall.

He could tell right away that the blue rock was no ordinary item. He took a closer examination and discovered mysterious patterns on its surface.

He couldn’t tell what the rock was used for or what kind of power it harnessed, but he knew that he couldn’t let it slip him by. Thus, he reached out and tried to grab it.

Bam!

A sudden blast of force suddenly gushed at Chu Feng.

Chu Feng was able to dodge it thanks to his fast reaction. He took a closer look and noticed a small protective formation around the blue rock. This meant that he would have to decipher the protective formation if he wished to take the blue rock away with him.

This formation was extremely complicated. It was created in a way that challenged a world spiritist’s skills instead of their spirit power. To put it simply, all world spiritists could potentially decipher the formation, but it would take some skill for them to pull it off.

This protective formation didn’t pose a challenge to Chu Feng, especially after he had grasped the legacy left behind by Yue Ling’s ancestor. It didn’t take him long to breach the formation.

As soon as the formation unraveled, the rock automatically drifted toward Chu Feng as if it had a mind of its own.

Chu Feng grabbed the rock and tried to place it into his Cosmos Sack, but he realized that it wouldn’t go in. He then attempted to put it into his robe, but that didn’t work either.

“This is…”

This was clearly an intentional design of the person who came up with this trial. The rock was made to float around its possessor, and it couldn’t be stowed away or hidden. This ensured that those challenging the trial would know who was in possession of the rock, thus leading to intense fights over them.

Chu Feng wasn’t too bothered by it since he didn’t think that there were any juniors who could pose a threat to him here. He continued exploring the area.

Six hours later, there were several hundred glowing blue rocks floating around him.

By this point, Chu Feng had already discovered some of the secrets surrounding the rocks. Each of these rocks had its own unique pattern, and they could be pieced together to form the formation deciphering method.

A formation deciphering method in a trial was bound to be of great use.

If he wanted to get the fortuitous encounter here, he would have to collect as many rocks as possible so as to grasp the formation deciphering method.

“Hm?”

All of a sudden, Chu Feng halted his footsteps.

He discovered a man standing by the corner of the cavern. It went without saying that the man was a junior, and he was dressed opulently. He was also quite a proficient world spiritist, being at rank three Dragon Transformation Sensation.

While it was lacking compared to Chu Feng, he could most definitely be considered as a prodigy amongst the juniors.

Most important of all, he was able to decipher the rocks’ protective formation at an incredibly fast speed. Even rank seven Dragon Transformation Sensation world spiritists wouldn’t have been able to do it as quickly as him!

There were more than eighty rocks floating around him. It paled in comparison to Chu Feng, but it was nevertheless outstanding.

“It looks like I mustn’t underestimate the juniors here,” Chu Feng murmured.

This man was the first junior he had encountered inside this cavern. While the man wasn’t strong enough to pose a threat to him, he was nevertheless impressed by the man’s capability.

The man soon deciphered the protective formation, adding yet another rock to the ones floating around him. He was just about to leave the area when he suddenly noticed Chu Feng.

The man’s eyes immediately widened in shock. He couldn’t believe that someone had actually managed to collect so many rocks. However, a greedy glint soon flashed across his eyes, and his lips curled into a cold smile.

Chu Feng could tell what he was thinking from his expression.

Truth be told, he wasn’t planning on making things difficult for that man. He had only stopped because he was impressed by the capabilities displayed by that man during the deciphering of the protective formation.

However, he wasn’t so kind as to forgive that man if he tried to snatch his rocks.

Thus, Chu Feng stepped forward and asked, “You look like you’re planning to steal my rocks?”

The man was startled to hear Chu Feng pointing it out so directly, but he quickly replied, “What about it?”

“You can give it a try.”

Chu Feng had intended to say those words with a stoic face, but just the thought of what would happen afterward evoked a laugh from him.Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates
