Chapter 5801: I Advise You Not to Touch Chu Feng

“Saint King-tier? Milord, is Saint King-tier the highest tier of our Heavenly Lightning Bloodline?” Huangfu Shangwu asked.

“Yes, Saint King-tier is the pinnacle of our Heavenly Lightning Bloodline, but there are very few who even reach General-tier like mine. It’s formidable for anyone to reach Saint-tier at all, which is why Huangfu Shengyu was seen to be our Huangfu Clan’s future,” Huangfu Zhantian said.

“That means that Chu Feng is likely to be above our young master…” Huangfu Shangwu murmured as he remembered Chu Feng’s feats thus far.

The sheer pressure Chu Feng had exerted on him on the bloodline dueling ring left him with no choice but to accept this reality.

“It’s not just ‘likely’. It’s practically confirmed. We need to re-evaluate the cultivators of the present era; they aren’t as weak as we imagined. Didn’t you see how Huangfu Bufan was killed earlier?” Huangfu Zhantian asked.

“I saw it.”

Huangfu Shangwu had also witnessed it, or else he wouldn’t have hidden in the teleportation formation. That was why he was shivering when Huangfu Zhantian teleported him over. He thought that he was dead meat, but who could have thought Huangfu Zhantian had come too? He didn’t think that he would be saved.

“Lord Zhantian, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master dared to kill our Huangfu Clansmen in broad daylight. Shouldn’t we eradicate them?” Huangfu Shangwu asked.

“There’s more to the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion than meets the eye. We’ll need further discussions on how to deal with them. As for Chu Feng… our clan chief will not let him off for daring to kill Huangfu Shengyu,” Huangfu Zhantian said.

“I advise you not to touch Chu Feng,” a voice suddenly echoed from ahead.

Huangfu Zhantian looked ahead and saw Song Changsheng appearing in his path like a specter. This shocked him so much that he immediately screeched to a halt.

“You… Why did you follow me?” Huangfu Zhantian was appalled.

By now, he was certain Song Changsheng was an existence he couldn’t hope to defeat, which was why he had immediately left with Huangfu Shangwu earlier after asking for permission. He was afraid that Song Changsheng would go back on his word.

But now that Song Changsheng actually caught up with him, he was terrified that Song Changsheng would take his life.

Instead of answering the question, Song Changsheng said, “I don’t know what plans your Huangfu Heavenly Clan has in store, and I don’t plan on intervening in your business. I wouldn’t have blocked your path today if not for my promise to protect Pulse Ignition Ordinary Realm. However, I advise you not to make a move on Chu Feng. It’s one thing if he remains safe, but should any harm befall him, that’ll spell the end of your Huangfu Heavenly Clan.”

Huangfu Zhantian was taken aback. “Thank you for your reminder. If I may ask, what’s Chu Feng’s background?”

However, Song Changsheng didn’t answer that question. He turned around and disappeared into thin air.

Huangfu Zhantian frowned. Instead of continuing on, he stood on the spot in contemplation.

“Milord, who were you talking to?” Huangfu Shangwu asked.

“A present-era cultivator. He’s stronger than me,” Huangfu Zhantian replied.

“A present-era cultivator who’s stronger than you?” Huangfu Shangwu was startled.

He had long heard that Huangfu Zhantian’s fighting prowess was not beneath their clan chief, which was why the latter had a special standing in the Huangfu Heavenly Clan. If there was a present-era cultivator who was even stronger than Huangfu Zhantian, it would mean that their Huangfu Heavenly Clan was not a match for the present-era cultivators.

“Milord, what did he say?” Huangfu Shangwu asked.

“Don’t ask too much. It’ll be detrimental to you to know too much. Take that man for example, he clearly doesn’t want to expose his identity. Even I could be silenced by him for talking too much, let alone you. I won’t be able to help you if he decides to kill you for learning about his identity,” Huangfu Zhantian said.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Milord, I was foolish! P-please don’t tell me anything!” Huangfu Shangwu exclaimed.

“That won’t do. Let’s die together. I didn’t step in when Huangfu Bufan and the others were killed because I was held down by that man.”

“Milord, please stop talking! I don’t want to know that!” Huangfu Shangwu’s face turned pale.

Huangfu Zhantian ignored him and continued, “He appeared earlier to warn us not to make a move on Chu Feng. He says that he can turn a blind eye to whatever our Huangfu Heavenly Clan does, but if we touch Chu Feng…”

Huangfu Zhantian’s words trailed off at this point, but Huangfu Shangwu was so curious that he couldn’t help but ask, “What would happen?”

“That’d be the end of our Huangfu Heavenly Clan’s lineage.”

“Milord, is that present-era cultivator who’s stronger than you from the same group as Chu Feng? That’d explain why Chu Feng is so arrogant.” Huangfu Shangwu nodded his head in realization.

“I don’t know whether they are from the same group or not. He speaks with a weird intonation, but I don’t think he’s joking. Regardless, we shouldn’t touch Chu Feng. This is a dilemma. Huangfu Shengyu is our clan chief’s darling. I fear he won’t listen to reason upon learning that Huangfu Shengyu has been killed,” Huangfu Zhantian said with a sigh.

Huangfu Shangwu fell silent. He also thought it would be hard to stop their clan chief if the latter was convinced that Chu Feng was the culprit behind Huangfu Shengyu’s death.

Huangfu Shengyu was simply too important to the Huangfu Heavenly Clan.

“Do you know what you should do?” Huangfu Zhantian suddenly asked.

“What… I should do?” Huangfu Shangwu was confused. He didn’t think he had a say in a matter of such scale.

“What you told me earlier is just your analysis, and I believe you should keep it to yourself. I’m not an advocate for lying, but if your lie proves to be beneficial to our Huangfu Heavenly Clan, perhaps it’d be worthwhile to do so,” Huangfu Zhantian said.

“I understand, milord,” Huangfu Shangwu said.

…

Meanwhile, in the Nine Heavens’ Zenith, Chu Feng finally met Wang Qiang.

He wanted to meet Wang Qiang because there were rewards other than the Genesis Bloodline in the Nine Heavens’ Zenith. He thought that this was a good opportunity, so he wanted to see if Wang Qiang wanted to travel with them.

Wang Qiang was faring much better than before, so he didn’t need to keep cultivating anymore. Thus, he decided to tag along.

In truth, neither Wang Qiang nor Long Muxi had the right to travel with them. This benefit was only reserved for those who had used their bloodline powers to overcome the formation inside the ancient hall.

However, Chu Feng wanted to bring them with him, and he didn’t think that the others would oppose his decision as he was the one who led them back then.

The issue was that Qin Xuan was also in the ancient hall, and he had the right to travel with them too. Thus, Chu Feng had Master Nine Zenith teleport him to Long Chengyu and Long Muxi.

While Qin Xuan seemed to have gotten along well with Long Chengyu earlier, the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect had supported Long Lin’s rebellion in overthrowing Long Chengyu’s father, thus landing them in their current plight.

Chu Feng thought that he should at least seek Long Chengyu’s opinion. If they didn’t want Qin Xuan to come with them, he would find other ways to compensate Qin Xuan.

Surprisingly, both Long Chengyu and Long Muxi were fine with it.
