Chapter 4979: Let’s Play Something Exciting

Chu Feng and the others soon figured out the situation after getting close.&nbsp;

In the sky not too far away from the city, there were nine silhouettes crossing blows with one another. Eight of them were elders from the Starspecter Valley, of which, five emanated the aura of rank two Martial Exalted level whereas the remaining three emanated the aura of rank three.&nbsp;

However, none of them were using their martial powers. They were all utilizing the prowess of their spirit power instead.&nbsp;

Despite the difference in their cultivation, their spirit power was roughly around the same level. They were all rank six Dragon Transformation Sensation world spiritists, wielding strength equivalent to a rank three Martial Exalted level cultivator.&nbsp;

They had put their strength together to construct a huge formation to suppress a single person, and that person was none other than the disciple of the Godwish Grandmother, Song Xue’er. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Song Xue’er held an Exalted Armament in her grasp. Despite being faced with a huge formation put up by eight rank six Dragon Transformation Sensation world spiritists, she was still able to stand her ground against them.

“As expected of the Godwish Grandmother’s disciple.”

Chu Feng was impressed by Song Xue’er’s strength.&nbsp;

Song Xue’er emanated the aura of a Divine Power, which showed that her cultivation wasn’t at rank three Martial Exalted level but rank two. Nevertheless, reaching rank two Martial Exalted level cultivator as a junior was still considered an impressive feat in the eastern region.&nbsp;

Chu Feng didn’t intervene right away to aid Song Xue’er. Instead, he turned his gaze toward the city.

He could sense auras within the city too. There were the Lady of Dao Sea’s disciples and the disciples of the Starspecter Valley.&nbsp;

The Starspecter Valley were guests invited by the Godwish Grandmother and the Lady of Dao Sea, but they were currently fighting against each other. From the looks of it, it wasn’t just a friendly spar but a life-and-death match.&nbsp;

Their alliance must have unraveled.&nbsp;

Under such circumstances, it wasn’t good news for the disciples of the Lady of Dao Sea to be with Qiu Long and the others.&nbsp;

Chu Feng quickly locked onto their location, which was inside a palace. Using his spirit power, he was able to peer through the walls of the palace and see what was happening within.

Killing intent swiftly blazed in his eyes as he rushed toward the palace furiously.

In the palace, Qiu Long and the other men had surrounded the Lady of Dao Sea’s disciples. They had all taken off their clothes and were eyeing Song Feifei and the others with lecherous eyes.&nbsp;

Little needed to be said about what they were planning to do.

Two of the disciples had already collapsed amidst pools of blood.&nbsp;

“Senior Qiu, you shouldn’t be doing this. How do you intend to face your master afterward?”

Song Feifei’s voice was quivering. She was frightened.

“Kikiki. Junior Song, you sure are naive. Even at this point, you’re thinking of intimidating me with my master. Have you really not figured out that this is my master’s will yet?&nbsp;

“Your master and that Godwish old hag want to use my master’s strength to open the Monstrous King’s Life Mound, but my master has never thought about sharing the mound together with you. Since the mound has finally opened, it goes without saying that it’s time to get rid of all of you.&nbsp;

“That being said, I must say that my brothers and I are really fond of all of you. As long as you give in to us, we’ll spare your lives. Otherwise, your fate will be the same as those two over there.”

Qiu Long pointed to the two the Lady of Dao Sea’s disciples lying amidst pools of blood.&nbsp;

Song Feifei and the others started tearing up out of fear. Those two disciples were killed because they refused to give in even at the expense of their lives, retaliating with everything they had. Due to that, they were killed by Qiu Long.

While Song Feifei and the others were trembling in fright, Qiu Long continued to eye Song Feifei lecherously. The thought that such a beautiful woman would be his very soon made him so excited that he started drooling.

“Senior Qiu, I beg you to let us off!”

Song Feifei kneeled to the ground. Tears dripped down her cheeks as she started sobbing.

The other disciples also soon followed suit.

One of them even said something that left Senior Qiu and the others stunned.&nbsp;

“Senior Qiu, please let us off! We are all still maidens! We know nothing about that kind of thing! Even if you ask us to wait on you, we also don’t know what to do. Please, spare us!”

“You’re maidens?”

After a moment of surprise, Qiu Long’s eyes started glowing in excitement.

“I never thought that the disciples of the Dao Sea would be so disciplined. Wonderful. Splendid! It just so happens that I’m into maidens like you. Brothers, since none of them have experience, don’t you think that it’s only right for us to take the initiative?”

Qiu Long and the others were ready to make a move on Song Feifei.&nbsp;

Bam!

The tightly shut doors of the palace were suddenly kicked open. A silhouette appeared by the entrance of the door.&nbsp;

Qiu Long and the others were initially shocked, and a glimmer of hope flashed across the eyes of Song Feifei and the others. However, upon seeing the person’s face, Song Feifei and other disciples collapsed into despair, and Qiu Long’s group sneered in disdain.

The person who had just arrived was none other than Chu Feng.

“Run, Chu Feng!”

Song Feifei was the first one to urge Chu Feng to escape.

She thought that Chu Feng’s cultivation was still in mid-Utmost Exalted level, but Qiu Long was a rank one Martial Exalted level. There was no way Chu Feng could have been a match for Qiu Long.&nbsp;

Weng!

However, the moment Song Feifei spoke up, the oppressive might from a rank one Martial Exalted level cultivator had already fallen upon Chu Feng. It sealed off his routes of escape, but it didn’t directly attack him.&nbsp;

Needless to say, it was Qiu Long’s doing.

“I was still feeling regretful that you managed to get away ahead of time. Who could have thought that you would deliver yourself into our hands? Very well, I’ll start from you,” Qiu Long snickered.&nbsp;

“Senior Qiu, these women seem to be very fond of that man. Why don’t we play something more exciting?”

A man stepped forward and spoke in a lecherous tone.

“What do you suggest?” Qiu Long asked.

“Let’s not rush to take his life. We’ll let him watch in despair as we have our fun with those women. Wouldn’t that be much better?” the lecherous man said.&nbsp;

“That’s a good idea.”

Qiu Long was interested in that notion.

“Just as I’ve thought. None of you are worth sparing. Since excitement is what you want, I’ll fulfill your wish.”

Chu Feng rolled up his sleeves, preparing to put up a fight.

“Oh? Am I hearing things? That man who only dares to hide behind women is thinking of making a move on us?” the lecherous man sneered.

Pu!

A dull thud suddenly echoed. Qiu Long and the others felt something warm splattering on their faces.

Everyone in the palace fell still.&nbsp;

Before anyone of them could react, the lecherous man had already been decapitated.&nbsp;
