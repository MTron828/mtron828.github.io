Chapter 5018: Ambitions Showing

Boom!

There was yet another loud explosion accompanied by rippling shockwaves, devastating the surroundings. However, the fight started quieting down from this point onward. A gust of wind swiftly appeared and dissipated the shockwaves.

“This…”

When the dust finally settled, the crowd revealed grim looks.

The battle had been decided… but the ones who were defeated were the Godwish Grandmother and the Sagacious Grandmaster.

They were reputable figures whose name was known throughout the Eastern Region, but there they were, lying helplessly on the ground. Even though Master Yin Ren didn’t make any further moves on them, it was clear that he could take both their lives whenever he pleased.

If the crowd hadn’t seen it with their own eyes, no one would have thought that these two powerhouses would be defeated by Master Yin Ren.

At this point, no one dared to look down on Master Yin Ren anymore.

Woosh!

Master Yin Ren’s sleeves suddenly started fluttering, and a powerful oppressive might gushed out from him. All of the spectating crowd were caught in the oppressive might and found their movements restricted.

Then, Master Yin Ren waved his hand, and his spirit power rippled out into the surroundings. All disguises were removed by a touch of his spirit power. Daoist Niantian, Shengguang Baimei, and the Lady of Dao Sea were no exception to the rule.

“Just as I expected, you are here too. It doesn’t seem like Chu Feng is with you? What a pity,” Master Yin Ren said.

“You old scoundrel! Don’t act so smug just because you have us in your grasp. Our Holy Light Clan will not turn a blind eye to this!” Shengguang Baimei bellowed.

“The only thing that’s tough about you is your mouth. Why isn’t your Holy Light Clan here then? Don’t you think that this is a sign of cowardice? However, it matters not. Even if your Holy Light Clan dares not to confront me, I’ll return to the Holy Light Galaxy to look for them. You better pray hard that your people are good at hiding, or else that might just spell the end of your clan,” Master Yin Ren said with a chuckle.

“What a joke! You think that you can destroy our Holy Light Clan?” Shengguang Baimei sneered.

While he wasn’t a match for Master Yin Ren, he wasn’t too worried about the latter confronting the Holy Light Clan. He was confident in the strength of their Holy Monarch.

Master Yin Ren didn’t bother to continue squabbling with the obstinate Shengguang Baimei. He turned his sights toward the rest of the crowd instead.

“Today is a wonderful day. Not only do we have the Sagacious Grandmaster, the Godwish Grandmother, and the Lady of Dao Sea here, but we have so many esteemed individuals here with us too!”

Master Yin Ren directed a sweeping glance at the crowd before his eyes finally fell upon the Lady of Dao Sea. The fact that he was paying extra attention to the Lady of Dao Sea despite the abundance of reputable world spiritists present showed just how highly he thought of the latter.

“Yin Ren, what schemes are you hatching?” the Lady of Dao Sea asked.

By now, she was already certain that the calamity that would befall the Nine Souls Galaxy had something to do with Yin Ren. For that reason, she wanted to know Yin Ren’s plans since this could very well determine the future of the Nine Souls Galaxy.

“Schemes? What an awful choice of word. I guess that all of you are curious about what my plans are, but there’s no rush here. You’ll know in due time. If you’re lucky enough, you might just be able to witness my glorious feat in person. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“For the time being, I guess I can satisfy another one of your curiosity. Yin Ren isn’t my name at all. My real name is Sima Xiangtu.”

Right after Master Yin Ren said those words, his appearance started changing. His face still looked as aged as before, but there was a distinct change in his facial features.

“Sima Xiangtu! You’re actually Sima Xiangtu!”

Shengguang Baimei and Daoist Niantian were astounded by the revelation. The two of them had met Sima Xiangtu before.

It was just that the Sima Xiangtu they knew was nothing more than a small fry back then. It was hard for them to think of the powerful Master Yin Ren as the same humble Sima Xiangtu they knew of.

“It looks like the two of you still remember me. Since that’s the case, you should know why my next destination is Holy Light Galaxy. After all… it’s only right to pay a visit to my homeland, right?”

An unnerving smile surfaced on Sima Xiangtu’s lips. Even Shengguang Baimei felt chills running down his spine.

“Sima Xiangtu! It turns out that you were hiding here all along!”

A furious bellow echoed, but it came not from an elder but a young man. The crowd quickly turned their eyes over, only to be shocked by what they had seen.

Unbeknownst to them, a young man had appeared in the vicinity. He was glaring at Sima Xiangtu with eyes blazing with rage.

Most of the crowd were shocked because they had no idea who this young man was, but it was the opposite for Shengguang Baimei, Daoist Niantian, the Godwish Grandmother, and the Lady of Dao Sea. They felt panicked because they recognized the young man to be none other than Chu Feng.

With even the Godwish Grandmother and the Sagacious Grandmaster falling in defeat to Master Yin Ren, Chu Feng was practically courting his own death by appearing at a time like this!

Even though the Godwish Grandmother had been suppressed, she still gathered all of her strength to let out a shout.

“Junior Chu Feng? That young man is the Godwish Grandmother’s junior?”

The Godwish Grandmother’s words failed to drive away Chu Feng, but it gave the rest of the crowd a deeper understanding of the mysterious young man who suddenly appeared here.

“Junior? Hoh, I was still wondering why the Godwish Grandmother suddenly turned on me. It turns out that there’s such a relationship between the two of you. But why would the Godwish Grandmother be your senior? Who is your master then?” Sima Xiangtu asked curiously.

“Sima Xiangtu, you should have hidden better. You shouldn’t have exposed your identity today,” Chu Feng said with gritted teeth.

Chu Feng also knew of Sima Xiangtu, for the latter was the culprit who backstabbed the Ox-nosed Old Daoist back then.

“Chu Feng, I know why you hate me so much. You wish to exact vengeance for your master, right? What a coincidence. Your master happens to be in my hands right now, but I’m guessing that he’s not the master of you and the Godwish Grandmother, right? Trash like him can only hope to hoodwink you. How could he possibly be qualified to become the Godwish Grandmother’s master?” Sima Xiangtu said.

“What do you mean?”

Sima Xiangtu’s words had revealed some crucial information to Chu Feng, but he was unwilling to believe them.

“I’m saying that your master is my prisoner.”

Before everyone’s eyes, Sima Xiangtu plucked out his right eyeball and crushed it.

Bam!

Fresh blood spurted out, and the crushed bits of the eyeball swiftly converged to form a spirit formation gate. The spirit formation gate was transparent, allowing one to see the insides of it.

“Master!”

Chu Feng could tell that it was a prison with two people trapped inside. One of them was Princess Xiaoxiao, and the other was Chu Feng’s master, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist!
