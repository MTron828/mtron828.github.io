Chapter 3077 - The Strongest Showdown

“Rank seven Heavenly Immortal, is this the strength of the Ancestral Martial Decastars?”

“So powerful, this is simply too powerful.”

At that moment, the crowd from the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm all cried out in alarm.

Chu Feng’s cultivation was already sufficiently heaven-defying among the younger generation. However, Li Anzhi’s cultivation was actually even stronger than Chu Feng’s.

That said, those that knew about Chu Feng did not immediately think that he would definitely lose to Li Anzhi.

After all, they knew about the abilities that Chu Feng possessed. Even if his opponent’s cultivation was a level higher than Chu Feng’s, Chu Feng’s heaven-defying secret skill possessed a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting a single level of cultivation.

“Chu Feng, taking into consideration that you are Chu Xuanyuan’s son, if you are to admit defeat right now, I will not harm you, and will instead let you walk away unscathed,” Li Anzhi said to Chu Feng.

While his words seemed courteous, they were actually filled with the intent to insult.

“I’m afraid that having me admit defeat would be impossible. If you are truly capable, you can try to defeat me with your strength,” Chu Feng stood where he was. He had a faint smile on his face the entire time.

Seeing Chu Feng acting like that, Li Anzhi’s expression of contempt changed slightly.

He realized that Chu Feng must possess hidden methods. Otherwise... it would be impossible for Chu Feng to still be so confident after he revealed his strength.

“Since that’s the case, let us not hold back, and unleash all of our abilities to battle to our heart’s content,” as Li Anzhi spoke, a Heaven level Lightning Mark appeared on his forehead.

After his Heaven level Lightning Mark appeared, Li Anzhi’s cultivation also increased from rank seven Heavenly Immortal to rank eight Heavenly Immortal.

After Li Anzhi’s cultivation increased with the appearance of his Lightning Mark, Chu Feng also unleashed his Lightning Mark. With that, Chu Feng’s cultivation increased from rank six Heavenly Immortal to rank seven Heavenly Immortal.

After Chu Feng’s Divine level Lightning Mark appeared, not to mention the other people of the younger generation from the Li Heavenly Clan, even Li Anzhi revealed a slight frown.

As someone who cultivated the Heaven Punishment Mysterious Technique, Li Anzhi had always looked down on others. This was especially true when his Lightning Mark was unleashed. At that time, he would be akin to a king standing high and above when facing other Heavenly Bloodline possessors.

However at that moment, after Chu Feng unleashed his Divine level Lightning Mark, Li Anzhi felt an extremely powerful sense of oppression.

Even though his cultivation was clearly superior to Chu Feng’s, that oppressive sensation still managed to affect him.

The reason for that was because that oppressive sensation had nothing to do with one’s strength. Instead, it originated from the depths of one’s soul, from within one’s blood.

It was the oppression of one’s blood.

The Heaven Punishment Mysterious Technique was indeed inferior to the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique.

Even though Li Anzhi was feeling the oppression in his blood, he quickly stopped frowning and revealed a calm and composed expression. He was filled with confidence.

“If that’s all you’re capable of, you will not be able to contend against me,” Li Anzhi said to Chu Feng.

“In that case, what about this?” As Chu Feng spoke, the golden-bright and dazzling Ancient Era’s War Sword appeared.

Not only was the Ancient Era’s War Sword radiating with light, but it also possessed the aura of a ruler. It resembled a king among weapons, looking down on all living things.

Furthermore, the Ancient Era’s War Sword’s imposing might was most definitely not false bravado. At the same time it appeared, it’s heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting a single level of cultivation also appeared.

“That sword actually possesses a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting a level of cultivation?”

“What is that sword? It’s not an Immortal Technique or an Immortal Taboo Martial Skill. Could it be a secret skill?”

“That guy actually possesses such a heaven-defying secret skill?” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

After Chu Feng unleashed his Ancient Era’s War Sword, the expressions of the Li Heavenly Clan’s younger generations immediately changed. They finally realized why Chu Feng was so confident.

It tuned out that Chu Feng actually possessed a heaven-defying secret skill capable of surmounting a level of cultivation.

Even though Chu Feng’s cultivation could only be increased to rank seven Heavenly Immortal after using his Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique, and was simply no match for Li Anzhi’s rank eight Heavenly Immortal cultivation, it was not the same when Chu Feng possessed that enormous golden sword with heaven-defying battle power.

By relying on that sword, Chu Feng was capable of contending against Li Anzhi.

“So that’s the case. No wonder you were so confident.”

“However, Chu Feng. You will still be defeated by me today,” Li Anzhi said to Chu Feng.

“Everyone, why are you all still standing here? The upcoming battle is not something that you all can withstand.”

“Could it be that you all want me to protect you?”

Chu Feng deliberately took a glance at Chu Zhiyuan as he said those words.

Hearing those words, Chu Zhiyuan’s expression turned extremely ugly. It was as if he had been fed feces. However, he did not dare to utter a single fart. Crestfallen, he stood up and returned to where the others from the Chu Heavenly Clan stood.

The current Chu Zhiyuan was a criminal. Both his grandfather and his own lives were in Chu Feng’s grasp. As such, how could he dare to talk back to Chu Feng?

At the same time as Chu Zhiyuan left the battle stage, Li Yan and the other Li Heavenly Clansmen also left the battle stage.

Even though Chu Feng’s words were belittling them, they knew very well that they would not be able survive on the battle stage when the battle between Chu Feng and Li Anzhi began.

After everyone left the battle stage, Chu Feng said to Li Anzhi, “Come. Let me experience exactly what sort of strength the strongest member of the Li Heavenly Clan’s younger generation possesses.”

Once Chu Feng said those words, the crowd all revealed expressions filled with anticipation.

As matters stood, the crowd were all certain that Chu Feng was the actual strongest member of the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generation.

As for Li Anzhi, there was no need to doubt that he was the strongest member of the Li Heavenly Clan’s younger generation.

This confrontation between the two of them, regardless of the outcome, would become something that people would discuss enthusiastically in the future.

This battle was most definitely worth looking forward to.

“Woosh~~~”

Suddenly, Li Anzhi flipped his wrist, and an Incomplete Immortal Armament appeared in his hand. Then, he waved his Incomplete Immortal Armament and sent forth a golden crescent-shaped blade ray.

“Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~”

The next moment, countless golden arrows appeared out of the golden crescent blade ray. The arrows shot out in a volley toward Chu Feng.

What Li Anzhi had used was an Immortal Technique. Furthermore, it was a rank three Immortal Technique.

Li Anzhi’s attack was truly extraordinary from the get-go. Without even landing on the battle stage, Li Anzhi had directly unleashed such a powerful rank three Immortal Technique at Chu Feng from the war chariot.

That said, Chu Feng was already prepared for Li Anzhi’s sudden attack. Without even moving, with only a thought, the Ancient Era’s War Sword stood before Chu Feng like a shield.

The next moment, that volley of arrows arrived. They collided with the Ancient Era’s War Sword. However, their collision was akin to crushed rocks smashing into a wall of steel. They all shattered on impact, and then dissipated into thin air.

Before the Ancient Era’s War Sword, Li Anzhi’s rank three Immortal Technique was actually unable to withstand a single blow.

“This...”

Seeing this scene, Li Anzhi’s expression changed. Shock appeared in his eyes.

His rank three Immortal Technique was unleashed with the power of his Incomplete Immortal Armament.

Yet, not only did Chu Feng not use any Immortal Techniques to withstand it, but he didn’t even use an Incomplete Immortal Armament.

Merely by relying on the secret skill itself, Chu Feng managed to neutralize his rank three Immortal Technique.

This illustrated that Chu Feng’s Ancient Era’s War Sword not only possessed a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting a level of cultivation, but its power was also stronger than people imagined it to be.
