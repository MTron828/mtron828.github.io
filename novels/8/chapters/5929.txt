Chapter 5930: You’re Not Just Our Benefactor, You’re Our Clan’s Benefactor

However, the restriction formation on Long Moxiao was so strong that despite mustering all his strength and clenching his teeth, he was still moving at a tortoise’s pace.

It was only when he saw Chu Feng return with hundreds of formation chains behind him, each one dragging a Dragon Breath Clansman, did he breathed a sigh of relief.

They failed and incurred severe injuries, but luckily none of them lost their lives. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

It was just that Chu Feng struggled to drag them back, as all of them had a restriction formation placed on them.

“Let me do it instead, Chu Feng,” Long Moxiao said.

“Elder, you might be stronger than me, but you aren’t able to exert much strength here due to the restriction formation placed on you. Your clansmen’s injuries will only worsen if they remain in this formation space, so we need to leave this place as fast as possible. Let me do it instead.”

Long Moxiao silently nodded. He knew that Chu Feng was right.

Even though Chu Feng was struggling, he could still exert more force than Long Moxiao in this formation space.

More and more people entered the formation space, sensing that something was amiss. However, most of them couldn’t venture too far in as they struggled to adapt to the environment. They could only wait at the outer boundary.

They were moved when they saw Chu Feng dragging the wounded back with tremendous difficulty, to the point where his face had turned pale from exertion, but even so, he refused to give up.

When he finally pulled them back into the formation realm, he collapsed onto the floor out of weakness. It was fortunate he was here. There was no other person here who had the means to drag all of these clansmen out of the formation space.

“Chu Feng, I-I’m sorry.”

Watching as Chu Feng lay weakly in Zi Ling’s embrace, the severely injured Long Mochuan lowered his head in shame. As a world spiritist, he could tell that Chu Feng’s formation had protected them. Otherwise, their injuries would have been even more severe.

As if that wasn’t enough, Chu Feng went a step further to drag them out of the formation space. Were it not for his swift decision, their injuries would have worsened till they died there.

Chu Feng had saved their lives.

Seeing the regret on the faces of Long Mochuan and the others, Chu Feng replied with a smile, “Don’t worry about it. It’s nothing big.”

His casual demeanor only made the Dragon Breath Clansmen respect him more. Most of them previously harbored doubts about the rumors surrounding Chu Feng, but now, they no longer harbored any doubt about his capability.

Without a doubt, Chu Feng wasn’t an ordinary junior. It would be foolish to judge him by the standards of an ordinary junior.

It might have seemed like Chu Feng had only saved Long Mochuan and his group, but in truth, all of them would have died in that teleportation formation if not for his intervention.

In other words, Chu Feng was their clan’s savior.

Chu Feng might have been in a weakened state, but in truth, he had only overexerted himself. Thus, it took only half a day for him to make a full recovery.

Long Mochuan and the others didn’t face any threat to their lives either, though their injuries were so severe that they wouldn’t be able to recover within a short time. They would have to slowly recuperate.

After making a full recovery, Chu Feng shared the method he had come up with with Long Mucheng and the others. It was a simple method of breathing and exhaling energy, just that it had a peculiar rhythm to it. They had to follow the rhythm for it to work.

“Lord Mucheng, the method works!”

The Dragon Breath Clansmen were overjoyed when they tested the method out in the formation core. Chu Feng’s method allowed them to smoothly infuse their dragon breath energy into the reparation formation without any impediment. The process was no longer taxing on them.

“Young friend Chu Feng, I don’t know how I should thank you,” Long Mucheng said.

“Elder, don’t be in a rush to thank me. My method might not necessarily work. We’ll only know after some time passes,” Chu Feng replied.

“First and foremost, this method works. We have been infusing our dragon breath energy into the reparation formation for a long time now, and we can sense a huge difference using your method.

“Even if this method doesn’t work, you are still our clan’s savior. We would have resorted to the teleportation formation as none of us wants to spend tens of thousands of years here. As you can see, we didn’t have the luxury of conducting tests as we only had enough energy to activate the teleportation formation once, so we would have left together.

“If not for you, all our clansmen would have died today. To die in a formation realm due to our recklessness, we would have been the laughingstock of the world.” Long Mucheng shook her head in self-reproach.

While she did support Chu Feng after hearing his suggestion, she had also been one of the clansmen who supported using the teleportation formation to leave this place. Just seeing the plight that had befallen Long Mochuan filled her with fear.

She knew that Long Mochuan and the others would have been in danger if Chu Feng hadn’t been here, and their entire clan would have died using the teleportation formation.

“Elder, you should give yourself more credit. It takes a lot of courage to diverge from a completed plan over an outsider’s words. Most people wouldn’t have been able to do that. You’re the one who decided the Dragon Breath Clan’s fate,” Chu Feng said.

“Chu Feng, you have quite the glib tongue, just like your mother,” Long Mucheng said.

“Did my mother have a glib tongue?” Chu Feng asked.

“She was cold as hell to others, but she’s a mischievous lass before me, albeit a very likable one. Chu Feng, your mother is the most outstanding woman I have ever seen, and you’re the second most outstanding man I have ever seen.”

“Who’s in the first place?”

“You’ll know in due time, but not now.” Long Mucheng kept the suspense.

“I’ll look forward to that day too.” Chu Feng smiled.

Long Mucheng suggested that he stay here, but he still had to look for the other Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s key fragments. Otherwise, he would have been interested in exploring Qin Jiu’s domain to see if he could gather any inspiration here.

In fact, if not for Long Mucheng’s ties with his mother, he would have already long left this place. He had only stayed so long because he wanted to lend them a helping hand.

But it was time to leave now.
