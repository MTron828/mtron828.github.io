Chapter 5080: Difficult Decision

In just a few short moments, all of the Asura Evil Spirits present, with the exception of Yaoyao, had already established a contract with Chu Feng. Unlike the Asura King, they immediately kneeled before Chu Feng after contracting with him.

Their attitude toward Chu Feng was extremely respectful.

It was a grand sight with millions of Asura World Spirits kneeling in order before Chu Feng.

Soon, a few million more Asura Evil Spirits flew over from afar. Leading them were the Asura King and Lord Yunliang.

These were the Asura Evil Spirits who opposed the Asura King’s decision but were imprisoned after falling in defeat.

“Is that man Lord Chu Feng? I didn’t think that he would be a junior!”

“However, it’s an amazing feat for a person as young as him to have reached such a cultivation level. It’s hard to imagine the extent of his talent. It looks like he’ll achieve great things in the future.”

“As expected of someone chosen by Lord Massacre. We’ll be able to conquer the world of cultivation once again!”

The Asura Evil Spirits spoke amongst themselves. There was no doubt nor hesitation in their words, just admiration. They had already acknowledged Chu Feng at first glance.

Meanwhile, the Asura King saw his old subordinates kneeling before Chu Feng, but he didn’t feel indignant at all. On the contrary, he was heartened by the sight. He turned to the Asura Evil Spirits behind him and said, “It’s your turn to make your choice. Are you willing to follow Lord Chu Feng?”

“That’s a redundant question. We have been waiting for this moment all our lives!”

The millions of Asura Evil Spirits who had just regained their freedom quickly made their way toward the contract formation, but Chu Feng never got to witness this great sight. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

As he contracted more and more Asura Evil Spirits, the effects of God’s Contract became more and more potent. He could feel the tremendous asura power stemming from God’s Contract permeating his World Spirit Space, constructing something within him.

At the same time, a significant portion of the asura power was being converted to martial power and spirit power before flowing into his body. Under such circumstances, his cultivation level directly increased without invoking the lightning ordeal.

Rank five Martial Exalted level, rank six Martial Exalted level…

Within moments, his cultivation had already risen to rank eight Martial Exalted level!

At the same time, his spirit power was swiftly growing stronger too. Within a matter of moments, he had already risen from rank seven Dragon Transformation Sensation to rank nine Dragon Transformation Sensation.

What was even more astonishing was that this wasn’t the end yet.

He could feel more asura power surging into his body. There was still plenty of room for his martial cultivation and spirit power to grow, but this situation only left him feeling extremely uneasy.

The foundation of his cultivation had always been extremely sturdy thus far, and that was the reason behind his powerful fighting prowess. To use an analogy, cultivating was similar to building a tower.

It was possible to build towers that rose to the clouds within moments, and those did look impressive, but they tended to be weak and unstable. Conversely, some towers took an extremely long time to build, but they were sturdy enough to weather any storm.

Chu Feng’s cultivation had always been incredibly sturdy, which was one of the key reasons why his fighting prowess had been superior to his peers. Yet, for the first time, he sensed the foundation of his cultivation loosening.

His cultivation had reached rank eight Martial Exalted level, making him far more powerful than before. However, in terms of how his fighting prowess compared to cultivators of the same level, he was no longer confident that he was peerless compared to everyone else.

That put him in a quandary.

If he continued to enjoy the benefits brought about by God’s Contract, he was confident that he could advance to Half-God level and become a God-cloak World Spiritist. However, he would also pay a price for it. It would become much harder for him to reach greater heights.

This single moment of greediness could very well become the bottleneck that limited his future potential.

It was hard for Chu Feng to not be tempted, especially after all of the setbacks he had faced in the Nine Souls Galaxy. He was confident of becoming a powerhouse in the world of cultivation in the future given his talent, but what was the use of it if those whom he cared about were to lose their lives before then?

He was weak right now, and it wouldn’t do for him to just rely on others. Be it the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster or the Divine Deer, they weren’t compelled to help him just because he asked for it. It was not as if they owed him anything. If he wanted to protect those around him, he needed to become strong himself.

However, it wasn’t easy for him to come this far either. Giving in to this temptation would mean rendering his previous efforts futile. His goal was to reach the top of the world of cultivation, and taking on this bottleneck could spell the end of his dream.

On one hand, he could achieve the cultivation level he dreamed of right away.

On the other, he could take his time reinforcing the foundation of his cultivation and eventually climb his way to the very top.

This was not an easy decision to make, but he soon made up his mind.

He put a halt to the benefit he was receiving from God’s Contract. He knew that this was a one-off thing, and this benefit would be forever lost if he didn’t accept it now. Nevertheless, he firmly believed that it was more important for him to preserve the foundation of his cultivation.

Eventually, his cultivation stopped at rank eight Martial Exalted level and rank nine Dragon Transformation Sensation. It was a pity that he didn’t advance any further, but this was still a huge leap for him. That was four whole cultivation ranks within a matter of moments!

Of course, it came at a price. The foundation of his cultivation had loosened, and his relative fighting prowess against his peers had been lowered. Fortunately, the effects weren’t too severe. As long as he worked hard, he should be able to make up for the deficiency and reinforce his cultivation.

After putting a halt to the benefit from God’s Contract, Chu Feng didn’t return his consciousness to his physical body. Instead, he dived into his World Spirit Space to examine the changes that had occurred. He quickly noticed a sinister black gate towering at a height of ten thousand meters had formed in there.

The black gate was opened, allowing Chu Feng to see the situation inside.

A beautiful meadow could be seen on the other side of the gate. It resembled the Asura Graveyard quite a bit.

Boom boom boom!

However, thunderous rumbling could be heard in the depths of the meadow. Dust was constantly puffing into the air in the far distance, and a great amount of spirit power was flowing in the sky. This realm was still under construction, and the end result was likely to be far larger than what Chu Feng was seeing right now.

“Chu Feng, are you able to enter there?” Yu Sha asked.

Chu Feng focused his consciousness and easily passed through the gate to enter the meadows.

“Yeah, I’m inside now,” Chu Feng replied with a chuckle.

“Don’t worry, Yu Sha. Even though this realm is created by the Heavenly King of Massacre’s formation, it’s still within the boundaries of my World Spirit Space. It’s safe,” Chu Feng replied.

“I… can’t enter the gate,” Yu Sha replied.

She raised a hand and pushed it through the gate, but a surge of invisible energy pushed her back.

“You aren’t able to enter the gate?”

Chu Feng was baffled. He tried leaving and entering the gate once more, and he was able to do it without a problem. Yet, the gate denied Yu Sha entry.

Chu Feng took a step back to carefully examine the black gate, and he soon realized that there was more to it than he had expected.
