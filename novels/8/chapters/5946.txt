Chapter 5947: Little Fishy Wakes Up

Chapter 5947: Little Fishy Wakes Up Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

This stand-off was tougher than Chu Feng had expected.

The enemy was too strong. He had to push himself beyond his limits to circumvent the enemy’s detection. In half a day, he had already fallen so weak that his consciousness began to fade.

It was then that the sleeping Little Fishy finally woke up.

The first emotion she felt was horror, as she realized that she was trapped in a formation. However, when she looked around, her face quickly warped in shock.

A person stood not far away from her.

There was a single formation around her, but on top of that, there was another larger formation enveloping her and that person. And that person was channeling both of these formations.

Little Fishy could tell that channeling these two formations was extremely taxing. Steam was rising from that person, and his skin was charred. His blood and flesh looked mashed together, and there was the smell of cooked flesh wafting through the air.

Her eyes reddened at that sight.

Even though that person was disfigured, she could tell who he was just from his back.

“Big brother!!!”

Chu Feng’s consciousness was fading. He was holding on through his sheer willpower. Yet, when he heard that voice, he quickly gathered his attention to look back. A faint smile emerged on his wretched face.

“Little Fishy, you’re awake.”

Those simple words stoked Little Fishy’s guilt. She was feeling groggy, but she could easily guess that Chu Feng was channeling these two formations to protect her. She could also tell that his awful condition was not caused by external factors but by overexertion from channeling the formations.

These injuries wouldn’t just shake his body. His soul would be affected too. He was paying a heavy price here.

Even so, he didn’t reproach Little Fishy, and neither did he explain anything to her. He would rather shoulder all of it alone than to put any pressure on her.

“Big brother, are these formations to protect me?”

“Don’t worry, Little Fishy. You’ll be fine as long as I’m around,” Chu Feng replied with a smile.

Just then, a man’s voice boomed from the sky. “Stop fighting back and hand over that person.”

The voice was artificial, in the sense that it had been altered in some way.

“We have been fighting for some time now. You know what you’re up against, so it should have occurred to you that you won’t be able to last long either. I know someone is backing you, but they aren’t a match for us. You are a talent too, and staying with them is beneath you.

“Why don’t you join us and hand over that person? With that contribution and your capabilities, you will be guaranteed a high position in our ranks. You can soar to the sky in just a single step.”

The voice echoed throughout Bluesnow Upper Realm.

Those words were from the Netherworld Sect, and they were naturally directed toward him. They must have realized that something was off given how they had employed such a strong detection formation but couldn’t find Little Fishy’s trail.

Someone had to be circumventing their detection formation.

However, they weren’t sure who that person was. They were probably thinking that it was an expert from the Immortal Sea Fish Clan, thus their words.

“Big brother, they are talking to you. You rescued me. They are after us, right?” Little Fishy quickly grasped the situation.

“No worries. They can’t find us,” Chu Feng replied.

“Big brother, dispel the formation around me.”

Little Fishy raised her hand, and bundles of light emerged from her skin. They were scales.

She formed a hand seal, and all of the scales except for one receded. This scale was a powerful formation disguised as her scale, constructed using an Ancient Era’s treasure.

Upon seeing that scale, Chu Feng dispelled the formation around Little Fishy. He could tell that the scale served as a distress call, and it would discreetly transmit her location outward.

However, the concealment formation Chu Feng had placed on her would affect the transmission, and Little Fishy probably knew that too, which was why she requested to have the concealment formation lifted.

“I can only lift the concealment formation enveloping you. If I lift the one around us too, they will notice us before you transmit your location out,” Chu Feng replied.

“I know, big brother.”

Little Fishy formed a few hand seals to encode a message into the scale. Then, she crushed the scale, and it dissipated into little specks of light that grew fainter and fainter before disappearing.

“Little Fishy, how long will it take for reinforcements to arrive after you transmit the message?” Chu Feng asked.

Xianhai Shiyue had used a special means to enhance the speed of their travel, but there was only so much one could do to raise one’s speed inside a teleportation formation.

At least, the speed of their travel wasn’t anywhere comparable to the formations in the Nine Heavens Secret Domain. Of course, the Nine Heavens Secret Domain had a downside, in the sense that only a handful of realms were linked to it.

Thus, Chu Feng wondered if the Immortal Sea Fish Clan had employed any special means in the Immortal Sea Galaxy to hasten their traveling speed. If not, judging from Xianhai Shiyue’s traveling speed, they would never make it in time.

Chu Feng was nearing his limit and couldn’t last much longer.

“I don’t know either. My father only told me to use this item when in danger, and he would immediately rush over to save me,” Little Fishy replied.

Upon hearing those words, Chu Feng took out two talismans and passed them to Little Fishy.

These were the talismans from the Martial Cultivator Commerce Guild’s guild leader.

In truth, they wouldn’t be much use in this situation. One of them was intended for concealment, but the enemy’s detection formation was so strong that they would be quickly discovered. Their effectiveness was limited against the enemy’s means.

Even so, it was still worth a try.

Chu Feng thought that if he couldn’t hold on any longer, they should split ways. These two talismans should buy Little Fishy time.

Little Fishy could tell what the uses of these two talismans were. So, she walked up to Chu Feng and returned them to him. “I don’t want to die, but I’m no coward either. I won’t be splitting ways with you today, big brother. We’ll either live or die together.”

...

At the highest peak of Bluesnow Upper Realm was a concealment formation.

In the concealment formation was the true form of the mountain peak. Three immense formations were being channeled on the mountain peak—a sealing formation, a detection formation, and a teleportation formation.

These three formations were powered by the many Ancient Era’s treasures placed in their formation cores, and these treasures would be turned to scrap by the time the formations stopped operating. That was the cost they had to pay for constructing these three powerful formations.

Thousands of Netherworld Sectmembers were gathered outside the formation. White cloaks fluttered behind them. They were all Demon-tier Netherworld Generals.

However, there was also a hierarchy among Demon-tier Netherworld Generals. Those gathered here were from extraordinary backgrounds, and some were even loftier than Lord Nine Demons. Even so, they could only stand outside the formation and await further orders.

Only two individuals were allowed to stand inside the formation.

One was dressed like any other Netherworld Sectmember, just that his bamboo hat and cloak weren’t white but red. On top of that, the words on his red robe were not Netherworld General but Netherworld Marshall!

The other one was dressed in a white robe that fully covered him. Blue patterns flickered on the white robe. His clothes were identical to the person who assaulted the six Ancient Clan’s Clan Chiefs and the Martial Cultivator Commerce Guild’s guild leader when the Ancient Clans were attacking the Ancestral Martial Galaxy.
