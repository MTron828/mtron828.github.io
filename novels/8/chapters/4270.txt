Chapter 4270 - Too Late

The Ox-nosed Old Daoist was killed by the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted.

Everything happened too suddenly. Many people present were utterly shocked.

On one hand, the crowd gasped with admiration at how ruthless the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted was.

On the other hand, they felt what the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted did to be very correct.

After all, even they felt like the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was not qualified to be Chu Feng’s master.

As such, they were able to understand why someone would kill the Ox-nosed Old Daoist. In fact, what the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted did was something they wished for.

But, compared to the bystanders that were enjoying a show, Chu Feng was furious.

The instant he saw the Ox-nosed Old Daoist being killed, he was truly burning with rage and wanted to attack the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted.

It was an anger he was unwilling to let go of even though he knew fully that he would not be a match for the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted.

But, when Chu Feng noticed how Grandmaster Tang Chen had no change in expression and was instead smiling, he suddenly realized that things were not as simple as he thought.

Since Grandmaster Tang Chen was a close friend of the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, he wouldn’t possibly be able to smile after his close friend was killed.

Thus, while Chu Feng was unsure of the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s current strength, he judged from Grandmaster Tang Chen’s reaction that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist would not be killed by the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted that easily.

Likely, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was feigning death!

Even though the anger in Chu Feng’s heart lessened a lot after confirming that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist didn’t die, his hatred for the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted did not decrease.

Regardless of whether or not the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was killed, it remains a fact that the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted had tried to kill him.

Chu Feng will definitely not forgive him easily.

“Young friend Chu Feng, don’t look at me like that.”

“How could a nameless nobody like that possibly be able to become your master?”

“I am helping you here.”

“Perhaps you’re unable to understand it right now. Perhaps you might even hate me.”

“But, one day, you will realize that I’m doing this for your own good.”

Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted was panicking slightly and began to try very hard to justify his behavior after seeing the anger in Chu Feng’s eyes.

After all, he wanted Chu Feng to seek him to become his master.

He knew that his action of killing the Ox-nosed Old Daoist would offend Chu Feng.

But, there was nothing else he could do. At least he would have a chance should he kill the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

But, if he doesn’t, he would have no chance at all.

“A despicable vile man that acts unscrupulously for your goal actually has the nerve to want me to seek you to become my master?”

“Let me tell you this. I, Chu Feng, will never take you as my master in my entire life.”

“But, it’s possible for you to become the next departed soul under my hands,” said Chu Feng.

Hearing those words, the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted narrowed his brows.

From the attitude Chu Feng displayed, he was unable to see a trace of hope.

But, seeing the same thing, Grandmaster Luo Tuo began to beam with happiness. He felt that his chance had arrived.

Thus, he said to Chu Feng, “What young friend Chu Feng said is extremely correct. Someone as despicable and vile as him couldn’t possibly become your master.”

“It’s better that this old man become your master instead.”

But, after hearing the words spoken by Grandmaster Luo Tuo, Chu Feng said, “You are the same as that Ghost-face. You’re only qualified to become a departed soul under my hands.”

“You...”

Grandmaster Luo Tuo narrowed his brows. He was feeling flustered and exasperated after being refused by Chu Feng in such a manner.

“Buzz---”

Suddenly, wind swept forth and the heaven and earth began to tremble. Even the space itself was deforming under the pressure.

Turned out, the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain was undergoing a change.

Before the crowd’s very eyes, the spirit formation around the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain was weakening. In the end, it completely disappeared.

At the beginning, the crowd were skeptical. But, they soon discovered that the spirit formation had really disappeared.

“Woosh, woosh, woosh---”

Once the spirit formation disappeared, many figures rushed forth like a torrential rain. From all directions and at the same time, they were flying toward the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain.

Lu Jie’s senior brothers and sisters arrived beside Lu Jie. They immediately brought him out from the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain and began to treat his injuries.

Before leaving, they did not forget to fiercely glare at Chu Feng.

But, none of them attacked Chu Feng.

The reason for that was because they knew that Chu Feng was not someone that they can attack now.

Even if they tried to attack him, there would be people that would protect him.

In fact, if they rashly attack him, they might court a calamity upon themselves.

Although very unwilling, reason was telling them that it was best to keep a clear head at a time like this.

Apart from Lu Jie’s senior brothers and sisters that came in to rescue Lu Jie, Grandmaster Tang Chen, Yuan Shu and Yu Ting had rushed over to Chu Feng’s side.

Without the existence of the spirit formation barrier, Chu Feng was exposed to people’s attacks. Grandmaster Tang Chen was worried for Chu Feng’s safety and was especially on guard against the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted and Grandmaster Luo Tuo.

As for the others, they all rushed toward the stele.

After all, the stele contained the inheritance.

To the crowd’s surprise, they were all able to approach the stele and even touch it.

But, none of them were able to obtain the inheritance. No matter what method they try, it was all useless.

This gave the crowd a massive headache.

If they cannot receive the inheritance with their own abilities, it would mean that there would only be one possible way -- they would need to become Chu Feng’s master.

But, this hope was simply too remote. The crowd felt that it was practically impossible for them to become Chu Feng’s master.

“Boom---”

Suddenly, an explosion was heard and energy ripples began to wreak havoc.

Many people were sent flying by the energy ripples. In less serious cases, they were seriously injured. In more serious cases, they were killed by the energy ripples.

Someone had attacked the stele.

Wanting to obtain the inheritance inside, someone had tried to destroy the stele using martial power.

The person who attacked the stele was Grandmaster Luo Tuo.

“Luo Tuo, have you gone mad?”

Both the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted and Celestial Fairy Muzhi were furious after seeing Grandmaster Luo Tuo attack the stele.

They were not fearful of the destruction of the stele. Rather, they were afraid of the inheritance inside being damaged.

“So what? Isn’t it completely fine?” said Grandmaster Luo Tuo in irritation.

Hearing those words, the crowd looked over to the stele and discovered that it was completely undamaged.

But, merely the energy ripples from Grandmaster Luo Tuo’s attack was enough to cause serious injuries and even kill the people beside the stele. From that, one could tell that attack was extremely powerful.

Yet, that stele was completely undamaged.

Seeing that, the crowd realized that it was impossible to use brute force to destroy the stele.

“Young friend Chu Feng, take me as your master. I guarantee that I will impart the inheritance to you.”

“Furthermore, I will ensure that you’ll be able to leave this place safely.”

Helpless, Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted looked to Chu Feng again.

The only difference was that the tone of his voice had changed.

He was no longer speaking with a humble attitude.

This time around, there was a slightly threatening tone to his voice.

“Young friend Chu Feng, you cannot trust this Ghost-face. You should instead take this old man as your master. Only this old man could guarantee your safety.”

Grandmaster Luo Tuo also spoke. Likewise, his tone was slightly threatening.

“So the two of you have finally unmasked yourselves?”

“But, with me here, neither of you can think about causing the slightest bit of harm to Chu Feng.”

Grandmaster Tang Chen shielded Chu Feng behind him.

“Tang Chen, do not meddle in other’s business.”

The Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted’s clothes began to flutter. His oppressive might has been released.

“Young friend Chu Feng, that Tang Chen is absolutely not a good person. You must not trust him. He’s merely acting this way because he wanted to obtain the inheritance.”

“You should instead take me as your master. I am much more reliable compared to that hypocrite Tang Chen.”

Grandmaster Luo Tuo also unleashed his oppressive might. It was pressing toward Grandmaster Tang Chen.

These two people that were hostile and arguing with each other, these two people that were about to start fighting one another, actually joined hands again.

The reason for that was because they knew that they would have a much better odds of success in defeating Grandmaster Tang Chen by joining hands.

“Two against one, isn’t it a bit too unfair?”

Right at this moment, a powerful aura landed beside Grandmaster Tang Chen to also shield Chu Feng.

It was the Celestial Fairy Muzhi.

“Muzhi, are you also planning to interfere in other people’s business?” asked Grandmaster Luo Tuo and Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted with stern voices.

If the two of them were to take on Grandmaster Tang Chen, they would have high odds of success.

But, if Celestial Fairy Muzhi joined to assist Grandmaster Tang Chen, things would become thorny.

“It is not too late to back out now,” said Celestial Fairy Muzhi.

“It’s already too late.”

Right after Celestial Fairy Muzhi said those words, another voice sounded.

Once that voice was heard, the crowd’s expressions all changed. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The reason for that was because that voice does not belong to Grandmaster Tang Chen, Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted or Grandmaster Luo Tuo.

Furthermore, that voice sounded from the sky above.

“That is?!”

Looking up, shock appeared in the crowd’s eyes. They seemed completely horrified.

The reason for that was because the person standing in the sky was the incomparably ugly Ox-nosed Old Daoist.
