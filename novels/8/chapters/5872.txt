Chapter 5873: Warning

To be safe, Jie Tianran had constructed a vast sealing formation around the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s main city. This sealing formation was capable of sealing off an entire starfield, and Jie Tianran had to expend a lot of treasures on it.

The Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s main city was constructed in a way that made it impossible to hinder another person’s vision of it as long as they were within a certain radius of it. Not even Jie Tianran could conceal the main city from others.

The most he could do was to construct a vast sealing formation to prevent Chu Feng and the others from coming close, hindering their vision of it through this indirect manner.

That being said, he overlapped a concealment formation just outside the sealing formation, just to be doubly safe.

Little did he know that the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect was capable of sending Chu Feng right into the sealing formation he had constructed. Chu Feng was in a different position than before, but his view of the main city’s gates was no worse than before.

However, Chu Feng realized that he was a step behind Jie Tianran when he walked out of the spirit formation gate. Jie Tianran had already utilized his observation means and was examining the gates. He had no idea when Jie Tianran had arrived, but he was at a disadvantage here.

Thus, he quickly got to observing the gates too.

What he had to do was the same as before, but the pattern had changed. The puzzle wasn’t any easier than before just because he had solved it before.

...

After a moment of studying the gates, Jie Tianran successfully got into the formation realm inside the main city. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Congratulations on reaching here, young friend. You’ll be undergoing a trial,” the deep and mysterious voice echoed.

It called Jie Tianran ‘young friend’ despite its age, but again, in terms of seniority, the person behind this formation was indeed Jie Tianran’s elder.

Jie Tianran wasn’t bothered about being called ‘young friend’. He looked at the colossal gate, knowing that the true trial lay within. “The Ancestral Martial Realm Sect has never thought of passing down whatever they received from the Ancient Era to others. This is an impossible level of difficulty!”

If not for the pointers from the entity in his body, it would have been hard for him to reach here even if he used all of his means. Even so, Jie Tianran was confident in the experience he had built up over time and his talent.

“It doesn’t matter whether they truly want to pass down their legacy or are just putting on an act. A formation of this caliber is bound to have a true treasure lying within. With my pointers, you’ll be able to get in without a hitch,” the voice inside Jie Tianran said.

“Will the treasure in here help you recover?” Jie Tianran asked.

“I’m not sure, but it should at least be beneficial to you. We’re one entity. It’s good news for us whether I recover or you make a breakthrough,” the voice inside Jie Tianran said.

“That’s true. I don’t think the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect truly intends to pass down its legacy. None of its remnants are easy to decipher.” Jie Tianran was worried.

“That’s only because I’m in hibernation, or else no remnant in the world can hope to block my path. You should know I was the one who nurtured Qin Jiu.”

“Hold on a little longer this time.”

“Don’t worry. I specially came out of my hibernation this time to help you.”

The colossal gate opened by nearly halfway while they were chatting. They had to wait for the gate to fully open before they could step in.

All of a sudden, the colossal gate suddenly closed.

Shocked, Jie Tianran anxiously turned around, only to see Chu Feng standing not too far away.

“Jie Tianran, you’re too much. You should have told me you were coming here a second time. Were you planning to monopolize the treasures?” Chu Feng asked.

“Bastard, you’re fine even after all that?” Jie Tianran roared.

He couldn’t believe that Chu Feng was able to get in despite all of the preventive measures he had put in place. The thought of Chu Feng foiling his plan once more infuriated him.

“You’re fine. How can I possibly not be fine?” Chu Feng chuckled.

“I’d like to see how long you can hold on for!” Jie Tianran roared as he channeled his psyche toward Chu Feng.

Chu Feng released his psyche as well.

The two surges of psyche clashed.

Chu Feng was previously worried about clashing with Jie Tianran once more as he hadn’t recovered to his peak, but to his delight, Jie Tianran wasn’t at his peak as well. There was still hope in this battle.

As he had expected, neither of them lasted as long as they did the last time, but Chu Feng’s psyche ended up being slightly weaker than Jie Tianran’s this time around. He held on through his sheer willpower and squeezed out every last bit of his psyche till Jie Tianran depleted all his psyche too.

With the depletion of his psyche, Chu Feng’s consciousness returned to his body. This time, he noticed that Jie Tianran wasn’t as composed as before. His knees fell to the ground, though he disappeared a split moment later.

This showed that Jie Tianran had exerted himself more this time around, though that was to be expected as it was the same for Chu Feng too.

“Lord Sectmaster, bring me back,” Chu Feng weakly murmured.

There was only one last thought in his mind before he passed out: I hope Jie Tianran doesn’t recover that quickly this time, or else I won’t be able to compete with him anymore.

Fortunately, the Hidden Dragon Martial Realm’s sectmaster heard his words and quickly activated the teleportation formation before dragging him into the teleportation passageway.

Jie Tianran returned to his quarters in the floating warship and immediately collapsed onto the floor, just like before. This time, his eyes were brimming with murderous intent and indignation. He couldn’t believe that Chu Feng had foiled him once more.

“Jie Tianran, that grandson of yours keeps getting in our way. When we finally get our hands on him, you mustn’t let him die easily. Make him pay for everything he has done before he dies!” the voice inside Jie Tianran bellowed in fury.

How could they not be upset when they had used so much of their precious treasures, only for their efforts to end in vain?

Jie Tianran didn’t even have the strength to reply.

“Jie Tianran, I shan’t waste my energy anymore since we won’t be able to obtain the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s treasure for now. I won’t be able to assist or communicate with you while I’m in hibernation, but I can sense what you’re going through. If you truly require my help, I’ll still step forward and aid you.”

Those words sounded both like an assurance and a threat.
