News quickly spread.

More and more people rushed into the hall, and their eyes were immediately drawn to the gold token.

A burst of light gushed from the gold token and landed at the center of the hall, shoving everyone in the vicinity aside. A sealed formation realm manifested in the emptied space.

The crowd couldn’t enter this sealed formation realm, but they could see what was happening inside.

Inside the formation realm was a grass field larger than the hall.

“What’s going on?”

The crowd was initially confused.

Two teleportation formations simultaneously appeared at both ends of the formation realms, and two figures emerged. Practically everyone recognized the two of them.

“Chu Feng and Jie Tian?”

“What are the two of them doing here?”

“Chu Feng took over the junior death immunity token earlier, right? Could it be that Jie Tian refused to accept the result and challenged him?”

“My gosh! I have never seen this before.”

“Is that formation a fighting ring?”

“Lady luck must be shining on me to stumble upon such an epic fight!”

The crowd looked forward to the battle.

Meanwhile, an old voice boomed from the formation realm. It was so loud that it could be heard outside the remnant city.

“The current holder of the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s death immunity token has received a challenge from the previous holder. However, the current holder has the right to refuse the challenge, as he has cleared the third stage, whereas the previous holder has only cleared the second stage.

“Does the current holder wish to accept the challenge?”

The crowd was dumbstruck. Jie Tian’s face darkened in anger.

The voice verified that there was a difference between the silver token and the gold token, such that Chu Feng could reject the challenge if he wanted to.

The crowd didn’t know there was a voice in the formation that only Chu Feng could hear. The voice revealed Jie Tian’s current strength to him.

Only spirit power could be used in this remnant, and this was disadvantageous to Chu Feng.

His strongest means was his bloodline ability, God Lightning Bestowment. He could subdue even rank two True God level cultivators with it, let alone God-cloak World Spiritists, although he would faint afterward.

Through the voice, Chu Feng learned that Jie Tian was at Exalted Dragon God-cloak, which meant his normal fighting prowess was comparable to a rank eight Half-God level cultivator. However, Jie Tian’s bloodline and skills further raised his fighting prowess to the caliber of a pinnacle God-cloak World Spiritist, or a rank nine Half-God level cultivator.

Chu Feng’s spirit power was at Immortal Dragon God-cloak, which was comparable to rank seven Half-God level cultivators, but his fighting prowess and world spiritist techniques were at the caliber of a pinnacle God-cloak World Spiritist too.

This meant that the two of them were currently equally matched.

“I accept the challenge,” Chu Feng said.

The crowd was overjoyed to hear that.

“He accepted it! Chu Feng accepted it!”

They were worried that Chu Feng would reject the challenge, for they wanted to witness the battle between two of the top prodigies of the current era.

The formation realm sounded once more, “It’s commendable for the current holder of the death immunity token to accept the challenge, so you’ll be bestowed with a power enhancement token. You may use the power enhancement token for this challenge but you may choose not to use it too. Current holder of the death immunity token, would you like to accept the power enhancement token?”

A translucent gold token appeared in the sky.

“I accept it.”

There was no reason for Chu Feng not to accept the token, as he could choose whether he wanted to use it or not. It would be wiser for him to keep it as a safety precaution in case Jie Tian had other means up his sleeves.

Little Fishy had told him about her battle with Jie Tian.

Initially, Jie Tian’s fighting prowess was revealed to be comparable to a Saint Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist, but later, he sealed off the battlefield and manifested a strong formation that further raised his spirit power by another rank.

He claimed that others weren’t worthy of witnessing his true prowess, but Little Fishy could tell that he didn’t want others to know he was relying on external power to deal with her.

As powerful as the formation was, it was the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s capability and not his own.

Even so, Little Fishy was too strong for him. He still ended up losing to her.

It hadn’t been long since the Nine Heavens’ Zenith ended. Chu Feng thought it was unlikely for Jie Tian to have grasped new tricks within such a short time.

Still, Chu Feng knew his limits. He knew he was unlikely to stand a chance against Jie Tian if the latter used the formation that enhanced his spirit power. The chances were that the power enhancement token would come into play in this challenge.

Chu Feng placed the power enhancement token into his robe.

The crowd said nothing about this seemingly unfair reward since it was in the rules. Besides, Chu Feng could choose whether he wanted to use it or not. The challenge would be fair if Chu Feng didn’t use it.

Besides, it would be a stretch to say that it was unfair for Chu Feng to use it since this was the privilege Chu Feng was rightfully entitled to for obtaining the gold death immunity token.

Even though the crowd thought nothing about it, Jie Tian looked disdainfully at Chu Feng.

“Chu Feng, it looks like you have no self-confidence.”

“What makes you say so?”

“You’re asking the obvious. You wouldn’t have accepted the power enhancement token if you were confident.”

“You think it’s unfair?”

“Of course.”

“If that’s what you think, shall we switch to a fairer method? There’s no need for us to fight here. You can challenge the junior death immunity token again. If you clear the third stage and surpass my record, the death immunity token will naturally be yours. If so, I’ll admit I’m weaker than you and won’t shamelessly issue you a challenge.”

Jie Tian frowned.

He had known that there were three stages to the death immunity token, and he would have challenged the third stage if he could. The problem was that he couldn’t decipher the method to challenge the third stage.

A moment later, Jie Tian’s face darkened as he realized Chu Feng was insulting him. The latter was saying that he was shameless to challenge him despite having been outdone.

“Chu Feng, you might have a sharp tongue, but as world spiritists, you should speak with your skills instead.”

Jie Tian released a gush of spirit power, which swiftly morphed into a terrifying army of thousands that charged at Chu Feng. Every single soldier in this army emanated an aura comparable to a rank nine Half-God level cultivator.

Chu Feng narrowed his eyes. He could tell that Jie Tian was indeed a formidable world spiritist.

In fact, Jie Tian had grown stronger since his battle with Little Fishy!
