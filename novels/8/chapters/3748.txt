Chapter 3748 - Terrifying Transformation

Right at that moment, Linghu Zhishi spoke.

“There’s no mistake, that is indeed an Exalted Taboo Martial Skill.”

“To actually manage to grasp an Exalted Taboo Martial Skill at such a young age, it would appear that young friend Chu Feng has experienced a fortuitous encounter.”

That said, there was a trace of greed in his eyes as he said those words.

Although he spoke pleasantly, he already had a sinister plot in his heart.

Exalted Taboo Martial Skills were extremely precious. Since one had appeared before him, he had decided to seize it for himself.

After even Linghu Zhishi said that what Chu Feng was using was an Exalted Taboo Martial Skill, the crowd had no choice but to accept it to be true.

After all, Linghu Zhishi was different from Gu Mingyuan. No matter how strong Gu Mingyuan might be, her Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan did not possess an Exalted Taboo Martial Skill.

The Linghu Heavenly Clan was different. Not only did they possess an Exalted Taboo Martial Skill, but Linghu Zhishi was also someone who had mastered that Exalted Taboo Martial Skill.

Thus, since he confirmed Chu Feng’s technique to be an Exalted Taboo Martial Skill, it must be an Exalted Taboo Martial Skill.

After confirming that Chu Feng had indeed grasped an Exalted Taboo Martial Skill, Linghu Hongfei no longer dared to be careless.

Instead, he gathered the power within him to strengthen the power of his Exalted Taboo: Vast Heavenly Lens.

“Linghu Hongfei, I’ll use this move to determine the battle.” said Chu Feng.

“Determine the battle? I’m afraid that move of yours will not suffice,” Linghu Hongfei mocked.

“You will soon learn whether or not it’ll suffice.”

After saying those words, Chu Feng’s smiling face turned into an extremely serious one. He suddenly shouted, “Exalted Taboo: Heavenly Fate Seal!!!”

After he finished saying those words, Chu Feng shot forth his palm before his chest.

“Rumble~~~”

Once he shot forth his palm, white light immediately appeared. After the white light gathered, a palm emitting white light appeared before him.

The palm was enormous. It measured ten thousand meters across. Such an enormous palm was flying straight for Linghu Hongfei.

“Humph, what a disappointment.”

After Linghu Hongfei witnessed the power of Chu Feng’s Exalted Taboo Martial Skill, the serious expression on his face disappeared, and the corners of his lips raised upward into a sneer.

After all, his Exalted Taboo: Vast Heavenly Lens measured a hundred thousand meters across.

“Buzz~~~”

Controlled by Linghu Hongfei, the image of the Exalted Taboo: Vast Heavenly Lens appeared above him again.

When a mirror measuring a hundred thousand meters was directly placed against a ten thousand meter palm, it must be said that Chu Feng’s Exalted Taboo: Heavenly Fate Seal appeared to be much weaker.

“Boom~~~”

White light surged forth. The Exalted Taboo: Vast Heavenly Lens shot out dazzling white light again.

Like a sea of white, the white light instantly engulfed Chu Feng’s Exalted Taboo: Heavenly Fate Seal.

“Oh no!”

Seeing that, Gu Mingyuan and others were all extremely worried.

They all felt that even though they were both Exalted Taboo Martial Skills, Chu Feng’s Exalted Taboo: Heavenly Fate Seal seemed to be incapable of contending against Linghu Hongfei’s Exalted Taboo: Vast Heavenly Lens.

“Clamor~~~”

Suddenly, a loud and sharp sound was heard.

Hearing that sound, Gu Mingyuan and the others that were originally worried about Chu Feng immediately revealed joyous looks on their faces.

It was now the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen that were worried.

The reason for that was because what they’d heard was clearly the sound of a mirror shattering.

Sure enough, upon closer inspection, mirror fragments filled the sky, and were falling from the battlefield.

Although the mirror had already shattered, the crowd were able to recognize those shattered pieces to be Linghu Hongfei’s Exalted Taboo: Vast Heavenly Lens.

The bystanders were unable to determine the reason why. However, Gu Mingyuan and the others were capable of seeing it clearly.

At that moment, the Exalted Taboo: Vast Heavenly Lens before Linghu Hongfei had not only shattered, but Linghu Hongfei was also completely covered in blood.

Although Linghu Hongfei was not knocked flying away by Chu Feng’s attack, he was still seriously injured by it.

“Huu~~~”

Suddenly, Chu Feng’s arm moved. A violent wind was immediately raised.

As the wind swept forth, the white gaseous flames that covered the sky were all dispersed.

At that moment, it was no longer only Gu Mingyuan and the other experts that were able to see Linghu Hongfei. Everyone present, regardless of whether they might be from the older or the younger generation, were all able to clearly see Linghu Hongfei’s current appearance.

Linghu Hongfei was half-kneeling in midair. His clothes were completely tattered, and he was covered in blood. Although he did not look completely mutilated, he still had a very sorry appearance.

Seeing this scene, the crowd were all stupefied. Shock filled their eyes and faces.

Linghu Hongfei was defeated. Linghu Hongfei was actually defeated!!!

Most importantly, it was not only Linghu Hongfei who was defeated. Defeated alongside him was the Exalted Taboo: Vast Heavenly Lens, the strongest martial skill of the Linghu Heavenly Clan, and one of the strongest martial skills in the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield.

However, it was precisely such a powerful martial skill that was defeated.

At that moment, the crowd were unable to keep themselves from looking towards Chu Feng. Their gazes had become complicated.

This was especially true for Exalted Heavenly Fate. Not only did he have a look of awkwardness on his face, but his eyes were also filled with astonishment.

It was a look filled with doubt. The scene before him was simply completely different from what he had prophesied!!!

Linghu Hongfei’s strongest technique had been defeated by Chu Feng.

This meant that the match had come to an end.

The person that had lost was not Chu Feng. Instead, it was Linghu Hongfei.

Exalted Heavenly Fate’s prophecy was wrong. Exalted Heavenly Fate, who had never made a mistake in the past, actually ended up making a false prophecy!!!

Chu Feng had really managed to prove himself with his strength.

“Hahaha!!!”

Suddenly, a burst of laughter was heard.

The laughter came from Linghu Hongfei.

Although he was seriously injured, he was slowly standing back up.

Compared to when Yu Sha climbed back to her feet, Linghu Hongfei was able to get up much easier.

Even though he appeared to be very seriously injured, his injuries were not as serious as Yu Sha’s injuries.

That said, that was not what was important. What was important was his current expression.

Even though he was clearly seriously injured, even though his Exalted Taboo: Vast Heavenly Lens was defeated by Chu Feng, Linghu Hongfei was not panicked in the slightest. He was also not feeling any sort of unease. Instead, the look of confidence was still fully visible on his face.

“Chu Feng, did you think you’d won?” Linghu Hongfei asked Chu Feng.

“Did I not?” Chu Feng asked.

“I’ve already told you from the very start that you... will definitely lose today.”

“I’ve also told you earlier that I’m going to play with you. Never would I have expected that my playing with you would actually give you the misconception that you’d be able to win.”

“My apologies, it was my bad. I wasn’t serious enough, and ended up making you have that sort of misconception.”

“However, I will now have to end this boring match.”

“Chu Feng, it will be your time to die now.”

After saying those words, Linghu Hongfei’s eyes turned fiery red.

“Rooaaarrr~~~”

Then, Linghu Hongfei began to emit fiery gaseous flames from his body.

Even his skin had turned fiery red. It seemed like magma, instead of blood, was flowing throughout his body.

That was not all. Linghu Hongfei’s body was also enlarging.

In the blink of an eye, Linghu Hongfei turned into a giant over three thousand meters tall.

It was not only an increase in size. His outward appearance had also changed. From fiery red, his eyes had become blood-red, extremely nefarious and fierce.

At that moment, Linghu Hongfei resembled a demon. A bloody horn had also appeared on his forehead.

Behind him was an enormous figure. It was a face.

It was a face that was ten thousand meters tall.

That said, that was not the face of a person. Instead, it was the face of countless people, millions upon millions of people.

The millions of faces gathered together to form that giant face. They were not only moving about, but they were also letting out either gloomy and low or sharp and intense voices.

All of this appeared so very strange, so very terrifying.

Most astonishing of all, after undergoing this transformation, Linghu Hongfei’s aura changed again.

His cultivation had increased again. From rank eight Exalted, his cultivation increased to rank nine Exalted.

Rank nine Exalted, that was the cultivation of a peak Exalted!!!VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience
