Chapter 5933: The Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s Crisis

“Elder Ma, what brings you here?” Chu Feng asked.

“Young hero Chu Feng, it’s thanks to you. I did you a favor last time, so our guild leader promoted me,” Ma Qing replied with a smile.

“Is your guild leader here?”

“She’s here. Young hero Chu Feng, Miss Zi Ling, please come with me,” Ma Qiang said.

“You know Zi Ling?” Chu Feng was surprised to hear Ma Qiang speaking Zi Ling’s name.

“The guild leader told me that Miss Zi Ling is your lover,” Ma Qiang replied with a chuckle. A second later, he quickly added, “Don’t worry, young hero Chu Feng. My lips are sealed. I’m loyal to the guild leader, or else the guild leader wouldn’t have trusted me with such information.”

“I trust Elder Ma’s character,” Chu Feng replied with a smile.

He intended to have Zi Ling wait outside, thinking that the guild leader wouldn’t want anyone else aside from him to know about her identity. However, it seemed like there was no need for it now.

The guild leader wanted to meet Zi Ling too.

Ma Qiang brought Chu Feng into the depths of the mountain range before taking out a token. The surrounding mountain range transformed into a beautiful paradise. They could vividly sense the rich natural energies in the air.

Before Chu Feng and Zi Ling could examine their surroundings, their eyes were both drawn in the same direction.

A massive army of over ten million armored soldiers was gathered above the beautiful mountain range. They were all the elites of the Immortal Sea Fish Clan!

There were tens of thousands of ferocious beasts chained to massive carriages that were around the size of a small city, but there was not a single person inside. These carriages were tightly sealed, but Chu Feng could tell that they were massive formations. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The Immortal Sea Fish Clansmen also noticed Chu Feng and looked over.

The sight of Chu Feng would have usually stoked some discussions among them, considering his resounding reputation, but despite their surprise, the Immortal Sea Fish Clansmen remained in their positions, not saying a word.

Their grim expressions looked as if they were here not for a visit but to fight a war.

“Elder Ma, why are there so many Immortal Sea Fish Clansmen here? Did something happen?” Chu Feng asked.

“I’m not sure either. Young friend Chu Feng, why don’t you ask our guild leader later?” Ma Qiang replied.

“Mm.”

Ma Qiang led Chu Feng and Zi Ling to a bamboo house amid the palaces at the mountain peak before taking his leave. This bamboo house looked humble on the surface, but it was enveloped by a powerful formation that prevented Chu Feng from peering in.

Ma Qiang pushed the door open and saw the Martial Cultivator Commerce Guild’s guild leader sitting inside the bamboo house. She had already prepared three cups of tea.

“Chu Feng, Zi Ling, we meet again,” the guild leader said with a smile.

“Disciple Chu Feng (Disciple Zi Ling) pays respect to elder,” Chu Feng and Zi Ling said with a bow.

“All right, all right. You aren’t outsiders. You may spare with the ceremony,” the guild leader said.

“Elder, I’m grateful to you for the matter concerning the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect,” Chu Feng said.

“You’re treating me like an outsider now. I’m from the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect too,” the guild leader replied.

“You have also helped me greatly aside from that. I previously wondered why the Martial Cultivator Commerce Guild would grant me so much leeway. It was only after I learned about your identity did I realized why,” Chu Feng said with a smile.

“Both you and Zi Ling are highly talented. Our Hidden Dragon Martial Sect ought to devote its resources to nurturing you. Chu Feng, you didn’t just come here to visit me, right? Is there anything you need my help for?” the guild leader asked.

“Elder, I’m here just to pay you a visit,” Chu Feng replied.

“Are you certain?” The guild leader was skeptical.

“Elder, putting aside the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, I owe you a huge debt for the help you have offered me. I dare not request for your help unless there’s a compelling reason to,” Chu Feng replied.

“What if we factor in the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect?” the guild leader asked.

“Even so, I still owe you a lot. Even if I require your help, I won’t resort to that unless I am cornered. Rather, elder, please feel free to ask anything of me. I’ll do my best to fulfill your requests as long as it’s within my means,” Chu Feng replied.

“You’re different, Chu Feng. If anyone else said those words, I would have thought that they were just pleasantries or even being hypocritical. However, I know that you mean those words from the bottom of your heart,” the guild leader said.

“Elder, you’re flattering me. I believe I am just doing what any other human should,” Chu Feng replied.

“You’re right. Fate sure is mysterious at times. You only came here to visit me, but it just so happens there may be something I require your help for,” the guild leader said.

“Elder, what is it?”

“Did you see the Immortal Sea Fish Clansmen outside?”

“I did. Did something happen to the Immortal Sea Fish Clan?”

“Yes, and it’s a major incident. You’d likely be concerned too.”

“Elder, what is it?”

“Xianhai Yu’er has been kidnapped.”

“Little Fishy? Who kidnapped her?”

“The Netherworld Sect.”

“The Netherworld Sect? Why did they kidnap Little Fishy? Is there a grudge between the Netherworld Sect and the Immortal Sea Fish Clan?”

“I’m not sure about the specifics. The Netherworld Sect has grudges with all of the major sects, though those aren’t anything major. The news hasn’t spread yet, but the upper echelons of the Immortal Sea Fish Clan are all in disarray. The Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s Clan Chief and elders have split up to hunt down possible bases of the Netherworld Sect.

“However, you should have heard about how elusive the Netherworld Sect tends to be. Unless they reveal themselves, it’s no easy feat to find them, let alone uncover their bases. My Martial Cultivator Commerce Guild has eyes all over the world of cultivation, and we are on good terms with the Immortal Sea Fish Clan, so they sought my help to find the Netherworld Sect. The army outside is waiting for our news.

“It just so happens that I did gather some clues. Our people have spotted Netherworld Sectmembers in two realms of the Immortal Sea Galaxy, and these two realms are in the same starfield. They didn’t just spot one or two sectmembers but many of them,” the guild leader said.

“Which two realms are they?” Chu Feng asked.

“There.” The guild leader tossed a map to Chu Feng.
