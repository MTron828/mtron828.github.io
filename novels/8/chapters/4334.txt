Chapter 4334: Changing Fate

Chu Feng didn’t consider himself to be a gentleman. There were times when he was obstinate and unreasonable. In fact, he often followed the adage of ‘Only a fool wouldn’t take advantage of conveniences delivered to their doorstep’.

But somehow, he felt that it wouldn’t be right for him to treat Long Xiaoxiao in such a manner.

Putting aside the fact that Long Xiaoxiao had suffered a lot in recent days, more importantly, Chu Feng felt that this entire matter smelled incredibly fishy to him.

Why in the world would there be such a condition here?

Thinking about everything that had happened previously, Chu Feng had already come to the conclusion that there was someone fooling around with them here.

However, the Dragon Vein Source had already been here even before the old ancestors of the Dragon Clan established their base here. So, this land was not created by the old ancestors of the Dragon Clan.

It would be impossible for him to trace back the creator of this place anymore.

However, no matter how he looked at it, the person who created this space didn’t seem to be a flippant individual.

But speaking of flippant individuals, Chu Feng happened to know one that was right by his side—the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

The Ox-nosed Old Daoist had unfathomable powers, so Chu Feng didn’t harbor any doubt that he possessed the abilities to create a trial like this.

Thinking back to the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s previous actions, Chu Feng felt that the reason why the other party didn’t have them enter right away might be because he was making use of that time to tamper with the inside.

And the product of the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s efforts was no other than the formation that was trapping him and Long Xiaoxiao right now.

However, this was only Chu Feng’s guess. He had no evidence at all, so he wasn’t in a good position to accuse the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, not to mention that the latter was his master.

In any case, there was no way Chu Feng was telling this to Long Xiaoxiao, regardless of whether it was true or not.

Otherwise, Long Xiaoxiao’s favorable impression of his master would go right down the drain.

“Princess Xiaoxiao, please don’t misunderstand me. You’re a ravishing beauty of noble standing, whereas I, Chu Feng, am only a humble lad. How would I possibly scorn you?” Chu Feng hurriedly explained.

“Is that true? Are you really not scorning me?”

Long Xiaoxiao’s beautiful eyes stared fixated at Chu Feng. There was a glint of doubt in the depths of her eyes.

“Of course! I swear to the heavens that if there’s any falsehood in what I said, the heavens shall strike me with five bolts of lightning!” Chu Feng raised his hand and swore.

“You have a Heavenly Bloodline. You get struck by bolts of lightning every time you make a breakthrough!” Long Xiaoxiao exclaimed indignantly.

She thought that Chu Feng was fooling around with her, and that left her maddened.

“I’ll make a new vow then. If I were to lie to you, my son will be born without a hole in his butt,” Chu Feng said.

“What are you doing? You shouldn’t implicate your wife and son in your own affairs! And... you already have a son?” Long Xiaoxiao asked once more.

This time, however, her eyes flickered in trepidation, as if she was worried about something.

“Of course not!” Chu Feng shook his head.

He had gotten into a relationship with someone before, but even in that moment of elation, he still retained a hint of composure.

What was Chu Feng the most afraid of?

It was implicating his own kin in his own affairs. He couldn’t afford to have a child when he didn’t even have the strength to protect himself yet.

While he did enjoy himself then, he had used a special method to control his fluids from flowing out.

As such, he was certain that he didn’t have any children.

“Then there’s even more of a reason that you shouldn’t swear on that!” Long Xiaoxiao remarked.

She shot a side glance at Chu Feng before finally letting the matter slip. “Forget it, I’ll reluctantly trust you this once then! However, if that’s the case, why is it that you would rather die here than to follow the instructions on the patterns?”

“Little benefactor, I think that you should give me a logical explanation for that today, or else I can only take it that you’re scorning me,” Long Xiaoxiao questioned with a pout.

“I just think that there’s something amiss here. It’s very likely that this is a trial,” Chu Feng replied.

“A trial?” Long Xiaoxiao was confused.

“Yes, a trial.”

After that, Chu Feng revealed his own point of view.

He told Long Xiaoxiao that this bizarre condition was to test how much they respected one another. As long as they held on and refused to do as the pattern stated, they would be able to clear this trial.

On the other hand, if they followed what they were told to do, even if they could break the yinyang spirit formation, they would be punished for it.

Chu Feng spoke with a logical flow, and his voice carried great confidence. That made his words exceptionally convincing to Long Xiaoxiao.

“Ah, so that’s how it is! I’ve really misunderstood little benefactor this time around. Let’s wait around then. Even if we die, I would have no regrets as long as little benefactor is with me,” Long Xiaoxiao said with a smile.

Chu Feng was surprised. He didn’t think that this lass would be so trusting of him.

All of a sudden, a voice suddenly sounded within Chu Feng’s ears. “You useless thing! This old man has given you such a great opportunity, so why aren’t you seizing the moment?”

This voice transmission came from none other than Chu Feng’s master, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“I knew you were behind this farce, master! What are you trying to do here?”

Through the voice transmission, Chu Feng was able to sense where the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was as well, so he was able to respond to his words too.

This time, Chu Feng was really infuriated.

Having climbed all the way here from the Lower Realm, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist wasn’t the only master he had had thus far.

However, this was the first time Chu Feng was faced with such a crooked master!

Was his master really the strongest world spiritist in the Holy Light Galaxy in the past?

Would the strongest world spiritist really do something as absurd as this?

“Don’t get ahead of yourself. Your master is also doing this for your sake. Long Xiaoxiao is bound to achieve great things in the future, so you aren’t taking a loss by becoming intimate with her.

“Besides, that lass is quite a looker herself. Why aren’t you taking advantage of the situation to get something done? You’ll really regret it if you miss this opportunity!” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said.

“Master, this is really inappropriate! I don’t harbor such intentions toward Princess Xiaoxiao, so how can I just take advantage of her like that? How could I become your disciple if I was that kind of person?

“If that’s the case, am I to take advantage of every single beautiful lady I see in the future? That would only make me a rapist!” Chu Feng replied.

He had tactfully chosen his words so as to make his point known without criticizing the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“Cough cough...”

A light cough sounded. The Ox-nosed Old Daoist also seemed to have realized that it was inappropriate for him to do something like that, so he said, “As expected of my good disciple, I knew you wouldn’t let me down. Actually, I just wanted to test what kind of person you are. If you had gone through with it, I would have really looked down on you!”

Those words from the Ox-faced Old Daoist left dark streaks all over Chu Feng’s face. He suddenly felt a slight disdain toward his master.

No matter how he looked at it, this wasn’t a test, but a bad prank.

“Congratulations, you have passed my test. Alright, let’s not waste any more time now. Let that lass enjoy the energy of this place!” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said.

Weng!

In the next moment, the pitch-black world suddenly brightened up.

The real world of the Dragon Vein Source unfolded before Chu Feng and Long Xiaoxiao’s eyes.

At the same time, a slit appeared behind them. This was the entrance they had entered by. As long as they wished to, they would be able to leave through it as and when they liked.

It was a blue world that they had entered. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

There were mountains and rivers, but everything here was blue.

It was a very beautiful shade of blue, and it made it look as if everything in here was made out of gleaming sapphires.

It felt like the two of them had walked into a dream.

More importantly, the energy that had trapped them earlier had vanished without a trace.

There was a burst of powerful aura that was surging in their direction from the surroundings, and it was swiftly gathering around Long Xiaoxiao. It was almost as if it was a child that had finally returned to the place where it belonged.

“Little benefactor, you were right! It really was a trial, and we managed to clear it thanks to you!”

Long Xiaoxiao skipped around the place joyfully as she spoke with incredible excitement.

“Hurry up and sit down. Use your martial technique to assimilate the energy here into your body,” Chu Feng urged.

“Little benefactor, you can also sense the energy that’s surging toward me at the moment?” Long Xiaoxiao asked in astonishment.

In truth, the reason why she was so happy was because she could sense a powerful surge of energy flowing in her direction.

She had never felt such powerful energy before, and she had no doubt that it had the power to change her life forever.

It was just that she thought that she was the only one who could sense it. She didn’t think that Chu Feng would be able to sense it too.

“Xiaoxiao, sit down and use the martial technique you have cultivated in the Dragon Clan. Try to assimilate this energy into your body. My master told me to remind you not to waste your time here. You should treasure this opportunity, as it can very well change your fate!”

Chu Feng was not lying. This was indeed what the Ox-nosed Old Daoist had told him earlier.

“Little benefactor, I understand. Wait here for me then.”

Long Xiaoxiao could already tell that the energy around her was incredibly potent, and Chu Feng’s words only served to make her view this matter more seriously.

So, she quickly sat down on the floor, closed her eyes, and drove her martial technique. The energy from the surroundings began to gush right into her body, ushering her toward greater heights.
