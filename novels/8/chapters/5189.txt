Chapter 5189: The Demon Spirit King Arrives

“An Exalted Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist is actually camping here too?”

Chu Feng was astonished.

A God-cloak World Spiritist was the equivalent of a Half-God level cultivator.

White Dragon God-cloak corresponded to rank one Half-God.

Gray Dragon God-cloak corresponded to rank two Half-God.

Blue Dragon God-cloak corresponded to rank three Half-God.

Purple Dragon God-cloak corresponded to rank four Half-God.

Gold Dragon God-cloak corresponded to rank five Half-God.

Royal Dragon God-cloak corresponded to rank six Half-God.

Immortal Dragon God-cloak corresponded to rank seven Half-God.

Exalted Dragon God-cloak corresponded to rank eight Half-God. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Saint Dragon God-cloak corresponded to rank nine Half-God.

The barrier that sealed off the humongous gush of gaseous flame came from none other than an Exalted Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist, who possessed powers comparable to a rank eight Half-God level cultivator.

Even if Chu Feng’s Asura World Spirit Army hadn’t been sealed off, he still wouldn’t have stood a chance against such an existence. The same went for the Situ World Spiritist Clan too.

Chu Feng frowned at the situation.

First the Demon Spirit King, and now an Exalted Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist. Xue Ji is right. There are indeed many experts hiding here, and most of them aren’t native to the Demoncoffin Ordinary Realm. They only came here for the realm’s secret.

“Elder, can you tell me more about the demon coffin? Is this the entrance to the demon coffin?” Chu Feng asked.

He was getting more and more curious about the fortuitous encounter inside.

“This is indeed the entrance of the demon coffin, but you don’t have to worry too much about it. The place is extremely dangerous. It’s doubtful whether they’ll be able to deal with the threats even with their level of cultivation. You just have to follow me, and I’ll guarantee your safety. We might be weaker than them, but that doesn’t mean that we’ll lose out to them,” Tao Wu said confidently.

He remained calm despite the situation.

“You think that you still have a chance here? They have already sealed us out here! We can’t even get in! How are you planning to get anything out of the demon coffin?”

Old Cat looked at Tao Wu disdainfully.

“Old Kitty, you can leave right now if that’s what you really think. Why are you still dawdling around here?” Tao Wu replied.

“Since I came here with Brother Chu Feng, I’m going to leave with him too. Besides, who are you to tell me where I should go? This is a rare sight. Of course I’m going to stay here to watch the commotion!” Old Cat replied.

It even exhaled a long stream of smoke to provoke Tao Wu.

“Heh…”

Tao Wu sneered in disdain before saying, “How meaningless. If it was up to me, I wouldn’t have brought you along at all. It was Brother Chu Feng who insisted on fulfilling his promise with you that I tolerated you till now. Otherwise, I would have long kicked you out.”

Old Cat was stunned to hear those words. It glanced at Chu Feng with a different light in its eyes.

“Elder, what should we do now? Do we just wait here?” Chu Feng asked.

“Just wait and see, young brother. You doubted my words earlier, so this is my chance to prove myself. I’ll put my name on the line here. All we have to do is to wait here and do nothing, and we’ll still be able to enter the demon coffin without a hitch,” Tao Wu said proudly.

Chu Feng could only accept his words for it. None of them had any means to deal with the barrier that had sealed off the gaseous flame anyway.

More and more cultivators gathered in the vicinity, but they were blocked out by the barrier.

The Situ World Spiritist Clan’s flying warship also arrived belatedly a while later. An elder stepped out from the flying warship. He wasn’t emanating his martial power, but based on what Old Cat had said, he was Grand Elder Situ Hongbo.

They would have usually put on a domineering attitude considering that they were the overlords of this starfield, but Situ Hongbo bowed respectfully in the direction of the gaseous flame before he spoke up.

“I am Grand Elder Situ Hongbo of the Situ World Spiritist Clan. May I know the name of the esteemed guest who has paid our True Dragon Starfield’s Demoncoffin Ordinary Realm a visit? Please pardon us for our lack of hospitality.”

Saying that Situ Hongbo was courteous would be an understatement. His attitude was bordering on reverential. Yet, his humble attitude didn’t bring about a response from the other party.

“Cough cough… I have an insolent request to make. The Demoncoffin Ordinary Realm is a territory of our True Dragon Starfield, after all. It’s our obligation as the overlords of the True Dragon Starfield to investigate any phenomenon that occurs here. May I ask you to release the barrier and allow us in?”

Situ Hongbo finally revealed his true intention. To put it plainly, he wanted to get a slice of the pie too.

There was finally a response from inside the barrier. It was a thunderous voice that sounded as if it had rumbled right beside one’s ears. It contained only a single word, but everyone in the vicinity heard it loud and clear.

“Scram!”

Situ Hongbo and the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen fell into an awkward situation.

Despite having encountered such humiliation, Situ Hongbo could only smile awkwardly, not daring to argue back at all. What could he possibly do against an Exalted Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist, an expert who could easily obliterate the entire Situ World Spiritist Clan?

“Heh…”

Chu Feng was exhilarated to see the Situ World Spiritist Clan suffering a setback. At the same time, however, he was infuriated to see how they had caused so much grief to his grandmother, only to bow down like pitiful puppies in the face of true experts.

“Young brother, I can see animosity in your eyes. Are you on bad terms with the Situ World Spiritist Clan?” Tao Wu suddenly asked.

“That’s not it,” Chu Feng shook his head and replied.

Chu Feng could have borrowed Old Cat or Tao Wu’s strength to decimate the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen present here, but he didn’t do so because he wanted to do it with his own strength.

“I see. I guess I shan’t reduce them to cinders then,” Tao Wu replied.

Those words showed his willingness to stand up for Chu Feng should he encounter his enemies.

As time passed, more and more cultivators gathered in the area.

Boom!

Rumbling sounds echoed from the direction where Chu Feng and the others came from.

There was a spatial quiver, and thirteen gigantic black beasts appeared out of nowhere. These beasts were shaped like leopards, but every single one of them was of a hulking size, spanning over ten thousand meters.

These thirteen black beasts were pulling an even larger war chariot containing many palaces behind them. Both the war chariot and the palaces on it were mainly black in color, emanating an air of dominance.

Even the Situ World Spiritist Clan’s flying warship was significantly smaller compared to the black war chariot.

“Chu Feng, that is the carriage of the Demon Spirit King,” Old Cat patted Chu Feng’s shoulder and told him.

“Demon Spirit King? I thought he was already here. It’s weird how he’s only appearing now.”

Chu Feng’s eyes became more serious upon hearing that the war chariot belonged to the Demon Spirit King.

He thought that it was weird that the Demon Spirit King was only arriving now, considering that the Demon Spirit King had set off earlier than they did and was much stronger than them.

Creak!

The gates to one of the war chariot’s palaces opened, and a brawny man standing at over nineteen meters tall stepped out. He was dressed in a black war helmet and black armor, fully covering himself up.

His size was nothing compared to the ten thousand meters long black beasts, but those beasts immediately lowered themselves in mid-air at his appearance, almost as if they were kneeling to him. The disposition he carried himself with was also stronger than anyone else present.

He was the renowned Demon Spirit King.

“Demon Spirit King? Why is he here?”

Many people were confused by the appearance of the Demon Spirit King. The Situ World Spiritist Clansmen even showed looks of fright.

It would seem that the Demon Spirit King had a fearsome reputation.

“Who is that? She’s beautiful!”

The crowd swiftly noticed a beautiful woman walking out after the Demon Spirit King. She was Xue Ji.

Chu Feng immediately understood why the Demon Spirit King had arrived late. The latter had probably arrived at the scene early, but he returned to fetch Xue Ji. That resulted in him arriving after Chu Feng and the others.

“Now that the Demon Spirit King is here, the barrier won’t be able to stop him anymore. It looks like we’ll be able to get in without a hitch,” Old Cat said excitedly.

However, Chu Feng turned to look at Tao Wu.

Tao Wu was the one who remained confident that they would be able to enter the demon coffin for sure. Looking back, it was almost as if he had calculated everything.
