Chapter 3767 - Bai Liluo’s Return

It took Chu Feng a total of two hours to subdue the poison within the Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master’s grandson.

Two hours was actually not a long time. However, after Chu Feng finished, he did not even have the strength to stand up. It took him a long time before he was finally able to stand up with difficulty.

The current Chu Feng was extremely weak. That was precisely the price he had to pay to restrict the poison.

He had exhausted himself.

However, after Chu Feng spent such effort to restrict the poison of the grandson of the Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master, he did not say anything after standing up, and began to walk toward the exit.

Seeing Chu Feng walking away in a weak manner, the eyes of the Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master were filled with complicated emotions.

From his expression, one could tell that he was making a very difficult decision.

At the moment when Chu Feng was about to walk out of the gate, the Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master suddenly spoke.

“Chu Feng, be careful of the Wuming Clan.”

“Wuming Clan?”

Chu Feng stopped upon hearing those words.

He turned around and asked the Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master, “In other words, it is the Wuming Clan that wanted to kill me?”

The Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master lowered his head, and did not answer him.

However, his silence had verified Chu Feng’s guess.

In the past, it was the Wuming Clan that had deemed Chu Xuanyuan and Chu Hanxian to be threats, and forced Chu Feng’s grandfather and father to leave the Ancestral Martial Starfield.

Thus, Chu Feng was not surprised to learn that the Wuming Clan considered him a threat too.

“If it’s the Wuming Clan, they’re not something to be afraid of.”

“After all, the Wuming Clan has already disappeared from the Ancestral Martial Starfield,” said Chu Feng.

“Disappeared? Could it be that the Linghu Heavenly Clan declared war on the Wuming Clan?” asked the Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master.

“The war has already ended,” said Chu Feng.

At that moment, the Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master narrowed his brows. From Chu Feng’s words, he was able to tell that it was the Linghu Heavenly Clan that had won the war.

However, there was no trace of joy on his face after learning this news. Instead, there was a look of worry in his eyes. He soon looked at Chu Feng again. “Chu Feng, the Wuming Clan is not as simple as you imagine them to be.”

Hearing those words, Chu Feng’s expression also changed. He asked, “How are they not simple?”

“I also do not know any details. However, the Wuming Clan is most definitely more extraordinary than they appear to be," said the Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master.

At that moment, Chu Feng realized that the Wuming Clan might really be as the Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master had said, and more extraordinary than everyone imagined them to be.

After all, if they weren’t capable, they wouldn’t have been able to control the Ancestral Martial Starfield for so many years.

The warning from the Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master had hinted to Chu Feng that the Wuming Clan might make a comeback.

Without a doubt, if the Wuming Clan really did make a comeback, the Chu Heavenly Clan would be the one to face the greatest danger.

After all, the current overlord of the Ancestral Martial Starfield was not the Linghu Heavenly Clan. Instead, it was the Chu Heavenly Clan.

This caused Chu Feng to have a feeling of urgency. He felt that he must quickly become stronger. Otherwise... he would not be able to protect the Chu Heavenly Clan.

“Don’t fret, what will come will come eventually.”

Soon, a smile of ease appeared on Chu Feng’s face.

Although he was able to sense the latent threat, he did not feel too much pressure.

The reason for that was because he was confident that even if the Wuming Clan were to make a comeback, he would be able to deal with them.

Afterwards, Chu Feng walked out of the palace hall.

However, to his surprise, he was not only greeted by Chu Xuanzhengfda, Grandmaster Liangqiu and Gu Mingyuan, but there were also three additional people.

One was Chu Lingxi, who had run away earlier with a reddened face.

The other person was the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, who was originally entertaining guests.

The last person was not someone from the Chu Heavenly Clan.

She was a little girl...

She appeared to only be eight or nine years old. Although she looked very young, her features were very refined. One could tell that she would definitely become an exceptional beauty once she grew up.

However, this adorable little girl had a head full of snow-white hair.

“Big sister.”

Chu Feng was pleasantly surprised upon seeing the little girl.

He took a step forward and ran over to her.

It was impossible for Chu Feng to not recognize her. After all, she was Bai Liluo.

But, wasn’t Bai Liluo inside the Black-feathered Specter? Shouldn’t she be in the Tantai Heavenly Clan?

Why would she suddenly appear there?

That said, regardless of what might be the case, Chu Feng was relieved to see her safe and sound.

After all, this was a good thing. At least, it showed that Bai Liluo was not in danger.

“My, little brother, your cultivation has truly increased quickly. You’re actually a rank five Exalted already.” Bai Liluo’s little exquisite face was also brimming with smiles after seeing Chu Feng. It was a very amiable smile.

After all, she did not know anyone else from the Chu Heavenly Clan. She was there precisely to find Chu Feng.

“Big sister, why are you suddenly fine now? Could it be that you’ve managed to fuse with the Black-feathered Specter?” Chu Feng asked.

Once Chu Feng said those words, the expressions of Gu Mingyuan and others who stood beside him all changed.

Black-feathered Specter, they had all heard that name before.

However, the Black-feathered Specter in their impression was not something good.

“How could it be that easy? Your big sister is already very fortunate to be alive and standing before you.”

Whilst smiling, Bai Liluo spread open her hands. Her smile was very sweet. Yet, there were also traces of helplessness.

“In other words, it was a failure?” asked Chu Feng.

“You can say that,” said Bai Liluo.

“Then... what about that Black-feathered Specter? Where is it now?” asked Chu Feng.

Chu Feng knew that the Black-feathered Specter was not something good, and would definitely be a potential threat to the Ancestral Martial Starfield.

“I also do not know where it went. However, before it left, it created a major disturbance,” said Bai Liluo.

“Major disturbance?” Chu Feng’s heart tensed up upon hearing those words. He asked, “What major disturbance?”

“It has massacred the entire Tantai Heavenly Clan,” said Bai Liluo.

“What?” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Massacred the Tantai Heavenly Clan?!”

Hearing those words, the expressions of Chu Feng and the others present all changed greatly.
