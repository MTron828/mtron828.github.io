Chapter 4283 - Failed Infiltration

When he mentioned the person who poisoned him, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist who has always had a smile on his face actually revealed a rarely seen look of anger in his eyes.

Sima Xiangtu was the person the Ox-nosed Old Daoist deemed as a brother since the time when they’re still very young. He was also the person the Ox-nosed Old Daoist trusted the most.

But, he became the person who nearly killed the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

Chu Feng had never experienced that sort of betrayal.

But, he was able to imagine the pain a betrayal like that would bring.

“Master, I will definitely help you find that man.”

“I will make him pay for what he did to you,” Chu Feng vowed with a serious voice.

As Zi Ling was his lover, she was someone that he must save.

As for the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, he was his master. The vengeance of his master was something that Chu Feng must seek forth too.

Although they’ve only just become master and disciple, it remains that a master would be akin to one’s father. As such, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s enemy would be Chu Feng’s enemy.

“Kid, you should first take care of your own business.”

“As for your master’s grudges, your master I am able to resolve them myself. I am not so weak that I needed my disciple to help me.”

While that was what the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was saying, he had a gratified smile on his face.

......

After journeying for some time, ChU Feng and the others finally arrived at the Reincarnation Upper Realm.

But, they did not directly enter the Galewind Hunting Clan’s territory.

Instead, they began to set up a spirit formation at a certain distance away from the Galewind Hunting Clan.

That was a teleportation formation.

Apart from the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, Chu Feng and Yu Ting, Grandmaster Tang Chen and Yuan Shu were also here.

“Ox-nose, are you really going inside?”

“How confident are you in being able to handle this?”

After the grand teleportation formation was completed, Grandmaster Tang Chen turned to ask the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“I am absolutely confident,” said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“Absolutely confident?”

“If you’re absolutely confident, why would you set up this spirit formation?” Grandmaster Tang Chen had a skeptical look to his face.

The usage of this teleportation formation was that it could teleport people here should they activate a teleportation talisman within a certain range from this teleportation formation.

Unless there’s a powerful spirit formation sealing away the area and interfering with the teleportation, nothing could prevent the teleportation talisman’s instant teleportation.

Frankly, this teleportation formation was established here just in case an accident happens.

It was a safeguard to escape from the Galewind Hunting Clan should some sort of accident happen.

“It is better safe than sorry.”

“Say, Tang Chen, don’t you understand me by now? I’ve always done things in a surefire way.”

“Even at times when I feel absolutely confident, I still like to leave behind a hand in case things go wrong,” boasted the Ox-nosed Old Daoist proudly.

“It’s not that I don’t trust you. It’s just that Galewind Hunting Clan...”

Grandmaster Tang Chen was frowning. He was worried because the Galewind Hunting Clan was truly powerful.

Even now, they had no idea exactly how powerful the Galewind Hunting Clan was.

If they weren’t under special restrictions from the Ancient Era that made it impossible for them to leave this region, the Galewind Hunting Clan will definitely pose a threat to the entire Holy Light Galaxy.

That was also the reason why Grandmaster Tang Chen was paying such close attention to the movements of the Galewind Hunting Clan.

He feared the Galewind Hunting Clan would break free from their restrictions and re-emerge into the world.

“Rest assured. Chu Feng and I will definitely be able to return unscathed.”

“You all just wait here. We will soon be back.”

Compared to the deeply worried Grandmaster Tang Chen, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was filled with confidence.

Grandmaster Tang Chen knew that he would not be able to change the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s opinion. Thus, he could only cooperate with him.

After all, by staying here and keeping the teleportation formation activated with his powers, he could ensure the teleportation formation’s efficacy.

With that, there would be a certain level of increased safety guarantee for Chu Feng and the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

Chu Feng and the Ox-nosed Old Daoist entered the Galewind Hunting Clan.

Ox-nosed Old Daoist was someone who grasped rank five Dragon Transformation Sensation.

His strength could be ranked among the highest level for world spiritists in the Holy Light Galaxy right now.

Thus, entering the Galewind Hunting Clan was a trifle matter to him.

Not only did they infiltrate into the Galewind Hunting Clan smoothly, they also soon discovered the location of Yan Ruyu, Ya Fei and Murong Wan.

To prevent being discovered, Ox-nosed Old Daoist sealed off the palace they were in using a spirit formation.

With the spirit formation in place, the people outside were unable to discover anything happening inside the palace.

With this spirit formation present, Chu Feng does not have to worry about anything when he inquire Yan Ruyu and others about the truth.

After the concealment formation was completed, Chu Feng immediately entered the palace to seek out and confront Yan Ruyu, Ya Fei and Murong Wan.

When Chu Feng saw Yan Ruyu, Ya Fei and Murong Wan, complicated feelings emerged in his heart.

Even though the three of them no longer looked the same as they did before, their appearances had turned to that of the Galewind Hunting Clansmen, Chu Feng knew that the three of them were the same Ya Fei, Yan Ruyu and Murong Wan he knew.

The only thing he was uncertain about was whether or not the three of them were still the ones occupying their bodies.

“It’s you again? Exactly what do you want?!”

“Men! There’s an intruder! Someone had intruded into our clan’s territory!”

When Yan Ruyu, Ya Fei and Murong Wan discovered Chu Feng, they did not hesitate at all and immediately called for guards.

The three of them revealed great opposition toward Chu Feng.

But, that was understandable. After all, they’ve all met Chu Feng once already.

Furthermore, the interaction Chu Feng had with them during their prior encounter was very unpleasant.

“You all can stop shouting. It’s useless.”

“No one will come to your rescue this time around,” said Chu Feng.

Even though the three women were shouting and crying for help with enormously ear-piercing voices, Chu Feng was not afraid in the slightest.

He was absolutely confident in the concealment formation the Ox-nosed Old Daoist set up.

“Buzz---”

But, right after his words left his mouth, an extremely powerful aura appeared out of thin air. Coming from the inside of the Galewind Hunting Clan, it permeated through the entire palace.

That oppressive might was extremely terrifying.

The instant that oppressive might appeared, Chu Feng felt that his life was no longer his. Rather, it was now in the hands of the owner of that oppressive might.

Should that person will for it, he will die on the spot.

“I’ve been discovered?”

“But how?! How was I discovered this quickly?”

Chu Feng shouted oh no in his heart the moment he sensed that oppressive might.

The Ox-nose Old Daoist had clearly set up a concealment formation sealing off this area.

Why would Yan Ruyu, Ya Fei and Murong Wan’s cries for help still be heard?

“Brazen human! You dared intrude upon our clan’s territory?!”

“You simply have a deathwish!”

Then, a deep and resounding voice reached Chu Feng’s ears.

That voice was alood and remote. It sounded like a god speaking to a mortal.

Chu Feng knew that the person that spoke, regardless of their identity, was most definitely someone from the Galewind Hunting Clan.

With such power, that person was most definitely a peak existence within the Galewind Hunting Clan.

That person must know what happened to Yan Ruyu, Ya Fei and Murong Wan.

“Senior, I did not come here with ill intentions. I merely wanted to learn the truth about one thing.”

“These three ladies and I are friends. I know that they’re humans.”

“I want to know how they turned this way.” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Exactly what did you all did to them?”

Although Chu Feng was discovered and having his life threatened, he did not cower. Instead, he questioned loudly.

“Friend?”

Hearing those words, the expressions of Yan Ruyu, Murong Wan and Ya Fei changed.

But, after they examined Chu Feng, an answer appeared in their eyes.

They do not recognize this Chu Feng at all. They were certain that they were not his friends.

“Lord Clan Chief, we do not know this person at all. Please kill him,” said Ya Fei loudly.

“Prepare to die!!!”

Once Ya Fei said those words, killing intent appeared from that terrifying oppressive might.

They were indending to kill Chu Feng.

“Woosh---”

However, right at this moment, a figure entered through the palace’s gate and arrived beside Chu Feng.

It was the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

Ox-nosed Old Daoist grabbed Chu Feng and, without saying anything, activated the teleportation talisman in his hand.

The power of the teleportation talisman engulfed them. Smoothly, they escaped from the Galewind Hunting Clan.

Their surroundings transformed. They were no longer in that palace in the Galewind Hunting Clan.

Grandmaster Tang Chen, Yuan Shu and Yu Ting appeared before them. Of course, there was also the teleportation formation they’ve set up ahead of time.

Using the power of that teleportation formation and the teleportation talisman, they’ve escaped to safety.

“Why would you two return this quickly?”

“Did you encounter trouble?”

Grandmaster Tang Chen, Yuan Shu and Yu Ting all stepped forward with concern.

From the expressions on Chu Feng and the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, they realized that things seemed to be amiss.

“I’ve underestimated the Galewind Hunting Clan.”

“This old man had set up a concealment formation sealing off the area. But, those three girl’s cries for help still managed to reach outside my spirit formation.”

“In addition to that, I’ve underestimated the strength of the Galewind Hunting Clan. There are experts far stronger than me in the Galewind Hunting Clan.”

“A close call. That was truly a close call.”

“Fortunately this old man set up the teleportation formation ahead of time. Else, Chu Feng and I will lose our lives in that Galewind Hunting Clan,” said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“In that case, did you manage to obtain any information?” asked Grandmaster Tang Chen.

“No. We were discovered before we’re even able to have any conversation,” said Chu Feng.

“It’s alright. As long as the two of you are fine,” comforted Grandmaster Tang Chen.

“Rumble---”

Right at this moment, the earth started trembling. Then, like a surging storm, terrifying power seeped out from beneath the ground. In an instant, it covered the surroundings.

The aura Chu Feng and Ox-nosed Old Daoist felt in the Galewind Hunting Clan appeared again.

“Crap!”

Seeing the transformation to their surroundings and sensing that terrifying oppressive might, even Ox-nosed Old Daoist cried out oh no.
