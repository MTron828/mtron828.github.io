Chapter 3160 - Revealing One’s Strength

"Rank eight Heavenly Immortal?! Such a young fellow is actually a rank eight Heavenly Immortal?!"

"What is going on with that Lightning Mark on his forehead? I’ve only ever seen Heaven level Lightning Marks before. Never have I ever seen a Lightning Mark with that ’Divine’ character."

"Heavens! Could that be the legendary Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique?! That guy trains in the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique!"

At that moment, the crowd were crying out in alarm repeatedly. This was especially true for the guests invited over by the Burnfield Monstrous Clan. Their facial expressions were truly marvelous. They were all deeply startled by Chu Feng’s strength.

"Buzz~~~"

Right at that moment, Chu Feng raised his hand and made a clenching gesture. A long whip covered in lightning appeared in his hand.

Upon sensing it, one could tell that that whip was merely composed of ordinary martial power, and not a powerful Immortal Technique or secret skill.

The crowd was confused as to why Chu Feng would suddenly form a whip with his martial power. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

At the moment when the crowd was puzzled, Chu Feng slowly said, "People of the Burnfield Monstrous Clan, listen carefully. Kneel and bow to me right now. Do that, and I will let bygones be bygones, and not make you all suffer today."

"However, if you all do not kneel, then you will have to experience the power of this whip in my hand," Chu Feng looked to the people from the Burnfield Monstrous Clan as he said those words.

“This guy! He actually wants us to kneel and submit ourselves to him?!”

“Truly abominable! He is simply too arrogant, no?!”

“Big brother Ganghao, you must definitely teach that brat a lesson! Otherwise, we will not be able to vent our anger!”

The Burnfield Monstrous Clansmen began to shout repeatedly. Even though they knew that they were no match for Chu Feng, they were still incapable of tolerating him and his arrogance. As such, they could only place all their hopes onto Fenye Ganghao.

Even though Chu Feng had increased his cultivation to rank nine Heavenly Immortal with the power of his Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique and gained strength on par with Fenye Ganghao, the Burnfield Monstrous Clansmen were still filled with confidence toward Fenye Ganghao.

“Brothers, rest assured! Today, I will definitely present you all a satisfactory answer!”

“Woosh~~~”

As Fenye Ganghao spoke, he flipped his palm, and a large blade over thirty meters in length appeared in his hand.

That was an Incomplete Immortal Armament. Once Fenye Ganghao grabbed the Incomplete Immortal Armament, his aura immediately increased greatly.

With the cultivation of rank nine Heavenly Immortal, Fenye Ganghao was practically capable of unleashing the power of his Incomplete Immortal Armament to the fullest.

After revealing his Incomplete Immortal Armament, Fenye Ganghao’s body began to change. Red veins began to appear on his stone-like skin. Those veins were emerging from his body and shining through his armor.

When the red veins covered his entire body, Fenye Ganghao’s aura increased once more.

It was the special bloodline power of the Burnfield Monstrous Clan. Although their bloodline power was not capable of increasing their cultivation by a level, it was capable of greatly strengthening their battle power.

As for Fenye Ganghao, his bloodline power was extremely fierce.

Because of that, after he released his bloodline power, the air around him began to tremble fiercely, as if it were afraid of him.

By relying on the fierce power of his bloodline, Fenye Ganghao was practically undefeated among those with the same battle power as his own.

After Fenye Ganghao unleashed the power of his bloodline, the Burnfield Monstrous Clansmen became extremely confident. As for their guests, they all turned their eyes to Chu Feng.

They wanted to know how Chu Feng would answer Fenye Ganghao’s great power.

However, upon looking at Chu Feng, confusion filled their eyes.

Even though Fenye Ganghao had already unleashed such a powerful ability, Chu Feng’s expression remained unchanged. His eyes were still filled with contempt.

Chu Feng was simply not putting Fenye Ganghao in his eyes at all.

“Never would I have imagined you all to be this foolish. If I don’t give you a good lashing with my whip, you won’t know how to properly submit to our Chu Heavenly Clan,” Chu Feng said.

“Brat, you dare to still boast so shamelessly?! Today, I’ll beat you till you kneel before your daddy here and beg for forgiveness! I’ll make you call me ancestor!”

As Fenye Ganghao spoke, he began to brandish the Incomplete Immortal Armament in his hand. His posture was simply not one of seeking only to make Chu Feng kneel and beg for forgiveness. Instead, he was simply trying to hack Chu Feng in two.

However, right after he raised the Incomplete Immortal Armament in his hand, he was fixed in place. It was as if he had been petrified.

At the same time, the expressions of everyone from the Burnfield Monstrous Clan changed enormously. Pain and fear filled their faces.

Even the expressions of the guests invited by the Burnfield Monstrous Clan changed enormously.

When they looked to Chu Feng again, they discovered that there was a sword and an axe revolving around Chu Feng.

The sword and axe resembled guardian treasures as they revolved around Chu Feng. At the same time, he was emitting a golden radiance that resonated with that of the sword and the axe.

The current Chu Feng was majestic like a god, and simply inviolable.

Most importantly, after the sword and the axe appeared, Chu Feng obtained a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting one level of cultivation.

Currently, Chu Feng’s battle power was an entire level stronger than Fenye Ganghao’s.

That was the reason why Chu Feng was capable of fixing Fenye Ganghao in place without even lifting a finger.
