Chapter 5553: I Wish to Meet Xianhai Yu’er

Chu Feng and the others followed the chief elder to the Star Sea Central City.

Soon, they arrived before the barrier that had previously blocked Chu Feng’s path, but this time around, they were able to easily pass through it thanks to the chief elder’s token.

However, the Star Sea Central City didn’t appear before their eyes. Instead, they were met with a boundless wilderness.

Chu Feng quickly realized how naive he had been.

It turned out that there were more barriers along the way, and each of them was stronger than the previous. It eventually reached a point where the barriers were so strong that even pinnacle God-cloak World Spiritists wouldn’t be able to breach them.

Upon passing through the final barrier, Chu Feng’s eyes lit up at the sight before him. The high elder and follower opened their mouths in astonishment.

The ground beneath them had vanished; they had entered a boundless sea of stars. In the distance, they could see an incomparably huge and beautiful city that was on a completely different scale from City 19.

Its walls were white with iridescent lights flowing on its surface. It was so exquisitely designed that it awed even Chu Feng. He felt like he was admiring an artwork.

However, that didn’t mean that these walls were for show. They were infused with spirit power, bringing their resilience to a ridiculous level. Even the barriers they had encountered before were nowhere as tough as these walls.

The closer Chu Feng came to the walls, the more vividly he felt how huge the city was. It felt more like an entire world by itself, just that it was shaped like a city.

“Woah! Looks like the master of the Star Sea Realm is an amazing person,” Eggy complimented.

“It truly is an incredible feat,” Chu Feng agreed.

The creation of this city was far above constructing a lifelike realm. Just constructing the powerful walls protecting the city was already an amazing feat by itself. Even Chu Feng was nowhere close to constructing a lifelike realm, though he could construct formation realms.

Upon entering the Star Sea Central City, the chief elder brought Chu Feng to a palace, where he would be residing from this day onward.

“This elder will be your butler from this day onward,” the chief elder said as he glanced at the conflicted high elder. He then turned his gaze back to Chu Feng and said, “I’ll assign you a few more followers later.”Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

In other words, Chu Feng was entitled to more than a single follower now.

“Lord Elder, I don’t need much. You don’t have to assign me more followers,” Chu Feng said.

The chief elder glanced at Chu Feng before nodding. “All right. Have you been bestowed with spirit power before?”

Chu Feng and 399 shook their heads, but the high elder replied, “Lord Chief Elder, I have received spirit power in City 19 before.”

“Let me show the three of you our Star Sea Central City’s bestowment formation,” the chief elder said.

“U-us too?” Both the high elder and 399 were taken aback.

“Of course,” the high elder replied with a smile. “That’s your reward for having a sharp eye for people.”

In other words, they were only allowed to visit the bestowment formation thanks to Chu Feng.

The high elder’s eyes reddened, and 399 burst into tears. They were so moved that words failed them. They never thought that their fates would suddenly take such a turn. This was a golden opportunity that they dared not even dream about.

The chief elder chuckled at the sight before turning to Chu Feng, only for his eyes to narrow right after. Any other White Dragon God-cloak Formation Master from City 19 would have been overjoyed to receive such an opportunity, but Chu Feng remained perfectly calm.

Even though the chief elder was perplexed, he didn’t voice it aloud. He brought Chu Feng and the others to the bestowment formation.

“You know the rules. You can only receive spirit power from the bestowment formation once every decade, or else your body will explode from energy overload. You have half an incense stick’s time to take in as much spirit power as you can,” the chief elder said.

Chu Feng stepped into the bestowment formation with the high elder and 399. He immediately felt a surge of spirit power gushing at him, though how much he could absorb and retain was a different matter.

It was similar to trying to collect water from the rain—while there was plenty of water raining down, how much water one could collect depended on one’s container.

Even Chu Feng found himself struggling to collect as much spirit power as he could.

By the time half an incense stick’s time passed, Chu Feng’s spirit power had risen to the level of Royal Dragon God-cloak, which was equivalent to a rank six Half-God level cultivator. That was roughly comparable to Chu Feng’s previous strength,

However, he wasn’t satisfied with the outcome despite having made huge progress. This was a rare opportunity for him, after all, and he wanted to raise his fighting prowess as far as possible.

As for the other two, the high elder had only managed to marginally advance his spirit power, whereas 399 managed to make significant progress. Even so, their progress was nowhere close to matching Chu Feng.

“Royal Dragon God-cloak.”

Even the chief elder was surprised upon sensing Chu Feng’s spirit power.

“Lord 521 has reached Royal Dragon God-cloak? It’s his first time entering the bestowment formation, but he managed to advance so far as to surpass me? T-this is inconceivable!” The high elder was taken aback.

Even the elders who were in charge of guarding the bestowment formation also rushed over to take a look.

“Heavens! He made such huge progress even though it was his first time in the bestowment formation. He’s broken the record of our Star Sea Central City!” an elder exclaimed.

Chu Feng wasn’t satisfied with his result, but the others’ responses told him that what he had achieved was already incredible.

“521, let’s have a chat,” the chief elder said.

He brought Chu Feng to a quiet place where they could speak privately.

“What’s your motive for wanting to enter the Star Sea Central City?” the chief elder asked.

Chu Feng immediately figured that he had been caught trying to breach the barrier back then. The chief elder probably let him off in view of the unique means he employed while attempting to breach the barrier. He feigned injury afterward, likely to test his character.

Fortunately, Chu Feng chose to help the chief elder, or else he would have never received the opportunity to come here. Thus, he decided to answer the question candidly, “I wish to meet Lord Xianhai Yu’er.”
