Chapter 5792: Conquering the Genesis Bloodline

Chu Feng looked through the spirit formation gate with absolute composure, not showing the slightest nervousness at all.

It was absolute chaos outside; the crowd was focused on the sky instead of the Nine Heavens’ Zenith. A brilliant light extended to the boundaries of the world—this was the colossal formation channeled by many experts from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.

Both the phenomenon and the formation enveloped the realm, like two clashing armies.

The realm shook when the energy inside the formation flowed, creating many cracks in the earth. This destruction was not just limited to the Pulse Ignition Village but the entire realm. Should the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion desire it, they could have destroyed this realm.

Such great power was imbued into a small silhouette, but somehow, this small silhouette was able to bear its power. It was none other than the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master.

The bustling realm fell silent when the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master appeared. The person before them was the most feared man in the world of cultivation, Jie Tianran. The crowd had to think twice when speaking before him.

The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master placed his hand together and formed a hand seal.

Boom!

The tremors suddenly intensified so much that it felt as if the realm was going to be capsized. The earth shook, as space started to shatter. All juniors, be it in the sky or on land, struggled to keep their balance. They needed an elder’s support to stabilize themselves.

The horrified crowd quickly retreated like alarmed birds.

The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master opened his palm, and a circular formation compass covered in runes rose into the sky, swiftly expanding to a massive size as it did so.

The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master changed his hand seal, and the compass began to revolve while releasing a powerful suction force that dragged everything in the sky into the compass.

Even the Genesis Bloodline wavered, slowly flowing toward the compass like a descending hurricane, but it stalled to a halt before it could be absorbed by the compass.

Nevertheless, the crowd was unnerved.

“Would he really absorb the Genesis Bloodline?” Long Chengyu and the others were nervous, as they didn’t hope for the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master to succeed.

“Don’t worry, he doesn’t stand a chance,” Chu Feng calmly replied as he rose into the sky and headed for the spirit formation gate.

Weng!

Golden runes surfaced on the spirit formation gate upon Chu Feng’s approach, blocking his path. Chu Feng carefully examined the runes, knowing it contained something important.

While the others had their attention on the phenomenon outside, Ling Xiao turned his focus toward the golden runes. He could tell there was something inside the golden runes too, and he wanted to see if he could figure anything out from it.

But before he could figure anything, Chu Feng suddenly formed an incredibly complicated series of hand seals, and the golden runes began flowing into his body. It didn’t take long for all of the golden runes to be fused into his body.

Grar!

A loud explosion echoed from the sky. It was from the Genesis Bloodline!

At the same time, a powerful surge of energy descended from the sky, instantaneously crushing the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s formation compass into little bits. Even the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master was sent flying from the sky into the ground.

All of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s world spiritists channeling the formation suffered a backlash. The stronger ones turned pale, whereas the weaker ones spewed blood. Some even fainted and fell from the sky.

And these were all powerful experts from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion!

A few from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion flew into the air to support the falling experts, whereas the others rushed to the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master’s side to construct a huge protective formation around him lest there was a follow-up attack from the Genesis Bloodline.

“I’m fine,” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master said, though his complexion looked a lot worse than before. He quickly swallowed a pill, but it didn’t seem to help him much. Even so, he hurriedly checked the situation in the sky, and his eyes reddened in indignation.

Many experts from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion had suffered severe backlashes or lost consciousness, making it impossible for them to maintain the colossal formation anymore. Thus, the colossal formation began shattering like a mirror.

“Abandon the formation and retreat!” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master ordered.

Someone immediately relayed his command, and all of the experts from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion hurriedly retreated. Without world spiritists to sustain the colossal formation, the formation fully dissipated. Spirit power scattered into the surroundings like a beautiful rain of light.

The crowd was stunned. This beautiful rain of light signified the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s failure, as well as Jie Tianran’s failure.

“To think that they would fail in spite of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master personally making a move. That golden light must be the legendary Genesis Bloodline, or else it wouldn’t have been so violent,” the crowd remarked.

However, the other powerhouses were pleased with the situation. “This is good news. We would have lots of suffering if Jie Tianran obtained the Genesis Bloodline.”

All of a sudden, another formation appeared in the heart of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s colossal formation. This formation was much smaller in scale, but it gave off a peculiar aura that immediately drew everyone’s attention.

“Does the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion have a secret hand?”

The crowd thought that this was another one of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s means, but their conjecture was proven wrong when a figure climbed out of the formation. They were all stunned, for it was a familiar figure. For a moment, they wondered if they were seeing things.

That person was none other than Chu Feng.

He was able to pass through the spirit formation gate after taking in the golden runes from the ancient hall, and it led him into this formation. The formation was transparent, such that those outside could clearly see him, and he could clearly see those outside too.

“I see.”

Chu Feng examined the formation. He looked down and saw that the spirit formation gate he had just passed through was still there, and he could see the situation inside the ancient hall. He could return to the ancient hall anytime he wished via the spirit formation gate.

The formation he was in, however, was not as simple as it seemed.

Shoosh shoosh shoosh!

Countless rays of light converged from all directions to encircle Chu Feng. All of them were members of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. Upon confirming that the person inside the formation was Chu Feng, they quickly constructed their formations to apprehend him.

“Heh…” Chu Feng wasn’t intimidated in the least. On the contrary, he laughed mockingly.

The formations directed at him were powerful, but they immediately dissipated like a breeze going against a boulder upon clashing with the small formation Chu Feng was in.

“That formation is so powerful?”

The crowd outside the Nine Heavens’ Zenith, including those from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, was baffled.

“Don’t waste your strength. That’s a formation from the Nine Heavens’ Zenith,” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master said via voice transmission.

Those from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion immediately stopped what they were doing, knowing they knew that they were powerless against the Nine Heavens’ Zenith’s formation.

“Isn’t Chu Feng in the NIne Heavens’ Zenith? Why did he suddenly appear here?” someone in the crowd asked.RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

While the crowd was figuring out what was going on, Chu Feng rose into the sky, and the small formation moved along with him. He stopped at an area close to the Genesis Bloodline, and he raised his opened palm.

Golden runes similar to those on the spirit formation gate earlier appeared on Chu Feng’s skin.

“Chu Feng is trying to conquer the Genesis Bloodline!” The crowd finally understood Chu Feng’s intention.

“He’s out of his mind!”

“Even the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion was unable to do anything about it, but a junior like him seeks to tame the Genesis Goddess? He’s seeking death!”

The crowd shook his head, thinking that Chu Feng was making a futile attempt.

Grar!

The Genesis Bloodline suddenly roared. Following that, a tremendous amount of energy stirred before descending from the sky, charging straight at Chu Feng.

“He’s courting death. No matter how powerful the formation protecting him is, there’s no way it’d be able to withstand the prowess of the Genesis Bloodline.”

Many shook their heads. They were convinced Chu Feng was dead meat. However, they soon widened their eyes in astonishment.

Even the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master was dumbfounded too.

The Genesis Bloodline didn’t devour Chu Feng; instead, it flowed toward Chu Feng’s palm before swiftly seeping into his body.
