Chapter 3373 - Ox-nosed Old Daoist

“Milord, may I know who would be able to help me?” Chu Feng asked.

“I think that only Saint-cloak World Spiritists would be able to undo such an inverse seal,” Wuming Fenghuo said.

“Saint-cloak World Spiritist, was it?” Chu Feng actually also knew that it was likely that only Saint-cloak World Spiritists would be able to undo such an inverse seal.

Merely, Chu Feng felt that there were not many Saint-cloak World Spiritists in the Ancestral Martial Starfield. Furthermore, such grand existences would be very difficult to request.

The only person Chu Feng could think of was Liangqiu Chengfeng.

However, Chu Feng had refused Liangqiu Chengfeng’s intention to take him as his disciple. Thus, he was uncertain if Liangqiu Chengfeng would be willing to help him.

Most importantly, Chu Feng simply had no idea where he was.

“Chu Feng, do you know how many Saint-cloak World Spiritists are present in the Ancestral Martial Starfield?” Wuming Fenghuo asked.

“Milord, please inform me,” Chu Feng felt delighted. For Wuming Fenghuo to say that sort of thing, he was evidently planning to give Chu Feng information on the number. As for that information, it was very useful for Chu Feng.

“In the Ancestral Martial Starfield, there are a total of three Snake Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritists.”

“The strongest world spiritist of the Ancestral Martial Starfield, Grandmaster Liangqiu, was naturally one of them. Everyone felt that Grandmaster Liangqiu might have been the first person to become a Snake Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist among the three.”

“Apart from Grandmaster Liangqiu, Saintly Steller Monk and White Dragon Demon Daoist have also reached Snake Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist.”

Hearing those words, Chu Feng’s expression changed somewhat.

Although he knew that the Saintly Stellar Monk and White Dragon Demon Daoist were very powerful, he did not expect the two of them to be Snake Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritists like Grandmaster Liangqiu.

It was no wonder the Chu Heavenly Clan would be so nervous when the two of them decided to honor them with their presence.

“However, the three of them are ever-mobile, like dragons. finding the three of them for help would be no easy task.”

“That said, apart from Snake Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritists, our Ancestral Martial Starfield, according to my knowledge, also has five Insect Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritists.”

“They are respectively the eldest disciple of Grandmaster Liangqiu, Liangqiu Chengfeng.”

“Our Starfield Master Realm’s Wuming Xingyun.”

“Grandmaster Long Xuan, Queen Mother Fox Immortal and Ox-nosed Old Daoist,” Wuming Fenghuo said.

“Senior, do you know where that Ox-nosed Old Daoist is?” Chu Feng suddenly became emotional upon hearing the name Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

Chu Feng’s father had once mentioned to him that there was someone in the Ancestral Martial Starfield capable of helping him in fusing with his Four Symbols Divine Beasts. At that time, Chu Feng would obtain the Divine Power of the Four Symbols Divine Beasts and become a cultivator possessing both a Heavenly Bloodline and a Divine Body.

As for the person who could help him, he was not Grandmaster Liangqiu, not Saintly Stellar Monk or White Dragon Demon Daoist.

Instead, he was the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“Chu Feng, you know of the Ox-nosed Old Daoist?” Wuming Fenghuo asked.

“No, not at all. However, I’ve heard that he is a senior with exquisite world spirit techniques,” Chu Feng said.

“Haha, who told you such a thing? That person was likely lying to you.”

“Chu Feng, Ox-nosed Old Daoist could be said to be the most unreliable individual ever. Not to mention that you’ll not be able to find him, even if you manage to find him, you will not be able to obtain his help,” Wuming Fenghuo laughed.

“Milord, why do you say that? Could it be that that Ox-nosed Old Daoist has done something?” Chu Feng asked.

“It is true that Ox-nosed Old Daoist possesses the qualification of an Insect Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist. However, the reason why he’s unreliable is because he will always create some bizarre things. Furthermore, he never engages in proper business. He is simply no different from a swindler.”

“Furthermore, do you know why he is called Ox-nosed Old Daoist? That’s because even though he’s unreliable, he has a massive temper. If anyone questions him, he will immediately lash out at them. In more serious cases, he will even beat them up. He is simply beyond reasonable.”

Wuming Fenghuo sighed, then warned Chu Feng with a serious expression, “In short, if you are to encounter the Ox-nosed Old Daoist in the future, it’s best to be careful, and not naively trust him, for he is extremely notorious.”

Hearing those words, Chu Feng did not say anything. He felt that Wuming Fenghuo likely had some sort of misunderstanding regarding the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

After all, his father would definitely not deceive him.

“Chu Feng, don’t worry too much. Although I am unable to help you find Grandmaster Liangqiu, Saintly Stellar Monk or the White Dragon Demon Daoist to help you, I’ve just so happened to have heard from Lord Wuming Xingyun that he and the other Insect Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritists are holding a small gathering.”

“Not only will our Starfield Master Realm’s Lord Wuming Xingyun be present, but Grandmaster Liangqiu’s eldest disciple Liangqiu Chengfeng, Queen Mother Fox Immortal and Grandmaster Long Xuan will also be present.”

“I will write a letter for you. You can hand that letter to Lord Wuming Xingyun. Upon reading it, he will definitely help you,” After Wuming Fenghuo finished saying those words, he immediately took out a row of bamboo slips. After he finished writing a letter, he handed it to Chu Feng.

“Thank you Milord. May I know where Lord Wuming Xingyun and the others are gathering?” Chu Feng asked.

“They will be gathering at the Nine Dragons Upper Realm’s Ice Summit.”

“The Ice Summit should be sealed for their gathering. However, with this title plate, you will be able to get up there,” As Wuming Fenghuo spoke, he took out a title plate and handed it to Chu Feng.

Although that title plate was not Wuming Fenghuo’s personal title plate, it was also not engraved with the words ‘Starfield Master Realm.’ Instead, engraved on the title plate was ‘Wuming Xingyun.’ The title plate was condensed from Saint-cloak Spirit Power.

Chu Feng felt that this title plate should be a title plate made by the Starfield Master Realm’s Insect Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist, Wuming Xingyun.

“Thank you Milord. For Milord to help me like this, this junior truly does not know how to repay you,” Chu Feng was extremely grateful toward Wuming Fenghuo.

If Wuming Fenghuo hadn’t shown up, not only would he have suffered a calamity, but the entire Wuma Heavenly Clan would have also been exterminated.

“If you want to repay me, do your best to train. Right now, you need to win honor for your Chu Heavenly Clan. I hope that you will one day be able to accomplish what was impossible for your father and grandfather.”

“That is, I hope that you will be able to win honor for our Ancestral Martial Starfield,” Wuming Fenghuo said.

“I will,” Chu Feng had a very confident expression.

“In that case, I will wait for that day,” Wuming Fenghuo revealed a satisfied smile upon seeing Chu Feng’s confident expression.

Then, after chatting with Chu Feng a bit, then left.

After Wuming Fenghuo left, the Wuma Heavenly Clansmen surrounded Chu Feng entirely.

They were all expressing their thanks to him. The Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief even wanted to hold a feast to thank him.

Of course, he was also planning to give Chu Feng valuable gifts as well.

However, they were all refused by Chu Feng.

“Senior, with the relationship between you and my clan chief, what happened today is something that this junior should do.”

“This junior appreciates senior’s kindness. Merely, I cannot delay in treating my big sister’s condition. As such, I’m afraid that I will have to leave immediately,” Chu Feng said. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Yes, saving her life is of the utmost importance. I will not detain you. However, I just so happen to have planned to bring Shengjie to the Nine Dragons Upper Realm. Thus, it’s perfect for us to journey together,” The Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“Senior is also planning to go to the Nine Dragons Upper Realm?” Chu Feng’s expression changed.

Chu Feng felt that the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief might be deliberately finding an excuse to accompany him and protect him because he was worried about him.

However, the following words from the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief changed Chu Feng’s thinking. It seemed that he really did have something to do in the Nine Dragons Upper Realm.

“Young friend Chu Feng, could it be that you do not know what sort of place the Nine Dragons Upper Realm is?” The Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief asked.
