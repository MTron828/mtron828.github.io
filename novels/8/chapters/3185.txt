Chapter 3185 - Soul-devouring Poisonous Centipede

Chu Feng was sitting cross-legged in the depths of the underground palace.

As Chu Feng had concealed the egg-shaped spirit formation and Bai Liluo with a concealment formation, their surroundings had turned pitch-black.

Suddenly, Chu Feng stood up and turned his eyes toward the entrance.

“It’s you all?!”

Chu Feng started to frown. At the same time, he activated the spirit formation in his palm.

Once the spirit formation within his palm was activated, Chu Feng’s body started to emit a faint light. The light was filled with runes and symbols. The runes and symbols had assimilated with Chu Feng’s body, bones and soul.

With that, Chu Feng gained the cultivation of a rank two Martial Immortal.

At the same time, Chu Feng’s various abilities were sealed.

Chu Feng was currently unable to use the power of his Heavenly Bloodline, his secret skills and his Immortal Techniques.

Currently, apart from his rank two Martial Immortal-level cultivation, the only other thing Chu Feng could use would be his Immortal Armaments.

Chu Feng had no other choice. Although he was only able to see a finite distance, he was able to sense that a large group of people were approaching him. They were the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clansmen.

Facing an expert like Qingyu Ruize, Chu Feng would not be able to win using his own strength. Thus, even though he knew that there were restrictions to Bai Liluo’s spirit formation, he still had to use it.

“Chu Feng, I can let the grudges and grievances between us be bygones as long as you tell me where that girl is,” Qingyu Ruize’s voice sounded from within the darkness.

Since Chu Feng was able to sense the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clansmen, Qingyu Ruize would naturally be able to sense Chu Feng too.

“Heh...” Chu Feng chuckled.

Then, his body shifted. Holding an Immortal Armament in his hand, Chu Feng leaped toward Qingyu Ruize. Chu Feng took the initiative to attack.

Chu Feng decided to do that because Qingyu Ruize was an actual rank two Martial Immortal. Furthermore, unlike Chu Feng, Qingyu Ruize was capable of using all his various abilities. Chu Feng knew that Qingyu Ruize possessed a special bloodline power that he could use.

Thus, normally, Chu Feng would simply not be a match for Qingyu Ruize. If Chu Feng wanted to win against him, he could only do so through a preemptive strike. This was the only opportunity that Chu Feng had.

Chu Feng’s speed was extremely fast. He arrived before Qingyu Ruize in an instant.

The Immortal Armament Chu Feng was using was a sword. The sword increased Chu Feng’s attack speed.

Currently, the sword was thrusting straight for Qingyu Ruize’s dantian.

Everything happened too quickly. Qingyu Ruize was simply unable to react in time.

“Puu~~~”

The sword in Chu Feng’s hand pierced into Qingyu Ruize’s dantian.

“Wuuahh~~~”

The next moment, all of the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clansmen present, including Qingyu Yunlong and Qingyu Yunhu, fell to the ground with painful looks on their faces.

They were all suppressed to a state of immobility by Chu Feng’s powerful and invisible oppressive might.

“Your cultivation!!!”

Qingyu Ruize also had a painful expression on his face. That said, compared to his expression of pain, his eyes were filled with even greater astonishment.

The reason why he was astonished was because even though Chu Feng’s cultivation had increased, it was hidden. Qingyu Ruize was only able to sense Chu Feng’s aura, and not his cultivation.

That was the reason why he was caught off-guard and struck by Chu Feng’s sudden attack.

“Buzz~~~”

Suddenly, the Immortal Armament in Chu Feng’s hand trembled. A powerful oppressive might entered Qingyu Ruize’s dantian and then his soul through Chu Feng’s sword.

The oppressive might caused the expression of pain on Qingyu Ruize’s face to become even more intense. Even his body started to shiver violently. Then his knees became weak, and he half knelt on the ground.

At that moment, even breathing became difficult for Qingyu Ruize.

That said, even though Qingyu Ruize was suppressed by Chu Feng, there was no trace of fear in his eyes.

“Oh, I got it now, you’re using some sort of special spirit formation.”

“Never would I have expected that girl Bai Liluo to be this powerful. She’s even capable of setting up such a spirit formation. Monster, truly a monster.”

“Unfortunately, I, Qingyu Ruize, am not that easily defeated.”

After saying those words, a strange smile appeared on Qingyu Ruize’s face. Following that, his body started to shine brightly. A powerful might was being emitted from his body.

“A protective treasure?”

Chu Feng frowned. He had realized that there was a protective treasure within Qingyu Ruize’s body.

That protective treasure had been forcibly assimilated into Qingyu Ruize’s soul by someone. It was one with Qingyu Ruize.

Activating that protective treasure, Qingyu Ruize managed to instantly recover his seriously damaged body.

Immediately afterwards, Qingyu Ruize unleashed his bloodline power.

Upon releasing the power of his bloodline, Qingyu Ruize’s cultivation increased from rank two Martial Immortal to rank three Martial Immortal.

His cultivation was an entire level above Chu Feng’s.

Seeing that the situation was bad, Chu Feng immediately let go of the Immortal Armament in his hand and leaped backwards. He was planning to escape.

However, at such a close distance, Chu Feng was simply unable to escape.

Right after Chu Feng leapt away, he felt an enormous oppressive might coming from Qingyu Ruize’s body. Like a massive wave, it instantly swallowed him.

“Putt,” Chu Feng was crushed into the ground and unable to move at all.

“Clank~~~”

Qingyu Ruize grabbed Chu Feng’s Immortal Armament and pulled it out of his body. Then, with a flick of his finger, that sword shot into Chu Feng’s dantian.

“Bastard, I am going to cripple you!”

Qingyu Yunlong crawled up from the ground with a furious look on his face. He held an Immortal Armament in his hand and was planning to attack Chu Feng.

“Wait,” however, Qingyu Ruize waved his hand, gesturing for Qingyu Yunlong to stop.

Seeing this, although Qingyu Yunlong was still furious, he stepped back.

Qingyu Ruize was the boss. Should Qingyu Ruize not allow him to attack Chu Feng, he would not dare to do so.

After stopping Qingyu Yunlong, Qingyu Ruize did not say anything. Instead, he calmly took out a little case from his Cosmos Sack.

There was an oval-shaped crystal inside.

Inside that oval-shaped crystal was a centipede. The centipede was green, and had three heads.

“This here is called a Soul-devouring Poisonous Centipede. It is capable of entering your soul and devouring it from within.”

“Although this Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm is protected with a grand formation that will not allow you to die, with this Soul-devouring Poisonous Centipede in your soul, you will definitely die the day you leave this Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.”

“However, that’s not the important aspect. What’s important is that this Soul-devouring Poisonous Centipede’s poison will bring unbearable pain to you. Truth be told, I’ve yet to see anyone capable of enduring the torture from this Soul-devouring Poisonous Centipede.” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“However, if you’re willing to tell me where Bai Liluo is undergoing her closed-door training, you won’t have to suffer this painful torture,” Qingyu Ruize said to Chu Feng.

“Enough of your superfluous words. I won’t tell you where Bai Liluo is,” Chu Feng said.

Hearing that response, Qingyu Ruize did not say anything else. A smile appeared on his face.

“Woosh~~~”

With a point of his finger, that Soul-devouring Poisonous Centipede flew out from the crystal. Like a sharp sword, it shot straight into Chu Feng’s body.
