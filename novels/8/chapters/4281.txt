Chapter 4281 - Losing Qualification

“There is.”

After hearing that answer from the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, both Chu Feng and Yu Ting were overjoyed.

Rescuing Zi Ling was something very difficult. But now... they were finally able to see hope. How could they not be overjoyed?

“Master, what method is it?” asked Chu Feng hurriedly.

“Don’t be celebrating too early.”

“While there’s a method, using this method to enter the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect is a very difficult task. Even you might not necessarily be able to accomplish it,” Ox-nosed Old Daoist said to Chu Feng.

Hearing those words, Chu Feng realized that things were not as simple as he expected.

But, he still asked, “Master, exactly what sort of method is it?”

It was impossible for Chu Feng to give up on Zi Ling. As long as there’s still a chance, Chu Feng will seize it for sure. Even if he must ascend a mountain of daggers or enter a sea of flames, he would not hesitate to do so.

Even if it was an endless hell, he would not hesitate to charge through it.

“The place where the Hidden Dragon Martial Set is established allows geniuses of the younger generation to seek to become their disciple on their own accord.”

“Because of that, they’ve set up a teleportation formation.”

“But, the requirements the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect had for their disciples is simply too excessive. As such, no one has been able to pass through their test.”

“Over time, the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s teleportation formation was abandoned.”

“Later on, the HIdden Dragon Martial Sect decided to dispatch their elders out of the sect to choose disciples personally to bring back.”

“But, that teleportation formation is still there. It is still functional.”

“As such, as long as the two of you brats are able to pass through the test of that teleportation formation, you will be able to enter the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect and officially become their disciple.”

“But... it’s not that this old man is trying to cast cold water over the two of you, trying to enter the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect through that method is practically impossible.”

“It is too difficult. The requirement is simply too harsh,” Ox-nosed Old Daoist shook his head and sighed.

“Master, do you know where that teleportation formation is?”

Chu Feng did not give up.

He had prepared himself. Even if it was something with ninety percent chance of death, he must still give it a try.

“This old man could locate that teleportation formation. But, Chu Feng, the current you is simply unable to quality,” said Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“Why?” asked Chu Feng.

“That teleportation formation possesses requirements. The first requirement is that those trying to use it must be people of the younger generation within a hundred years of age.”

“While that requirement is not demanding at all, the following requirement is truly excessive.”

“Only people of the younger generation with a cultivation of rank four Utmost Exalted or above are qualified to enter the teleportation formation to accept its challenge,” said Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“Rank four Utmost Exalted? Wouldn’t that mean...”

Chu Feng frowned upon hearing those words. He received a shock to the hope he was holding onto.

While he was in a rush to save Zi Ling, his current cultivation was only that of a rank one Utmost Exalted.

There’s three entire levels of cultivation difference between his current cultivation and rank four Utmost Exalted.

As for cultivation, it was not something that he could make a breakthrough with certainty just by gathering sufficient resources. He would also need to gain martial comprehension. No matter how talented he might be, reaching rank four Utmost Exalted in a short period of time was still extremely difficult.

At the time when Chu Feng was worrying from being unable to reach four rank Utmost Exalted in a short period of time to enter the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect to save Zi Ling, the words spoken by the Ox-nosed Old Daoist brought him even greater despair.

“Rank four Utmost Exalted is only the qualification needed to challenge it. Reportedly, if one wanted to successfully pass through the teleportation formation, one needed the cultivation of rank nine Utmost Exalted,” added the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“Rank nine Utmost Exalted?”

“How could anyone accomplish such a thing?”

Before Chu Feng could say anything, Yu Ting voiced her shock.

What sort of existence was a rank nine Utmost Exalted? FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

That was a level of cultivation a step away from reaching Martial Exalted.

How could a person of the younger generation within a hundred years of age possibly possess that cultivation?

Not even the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect possesses a genius of that caliber.

Most depressing of all was the fact that even though Chu Feng possessed exceptional talent and could very well be able to reach rank nine Utmost Exalted within a hundred years of age, it will still take him many years to do so. At that time, who knows if Zi Ling would still be alive.

“Do the two of you now understand why it’s so difficult to enter the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect using that spirit formation?”

“If it’s not difficult, there wouldn’t be no one to enter the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect through that teleportation formation making it eventually forgotten.”

“At first, the requirements the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect had toward their disciples are simply too high.”

“The reason why they changed their disciple selection method was because they were forced to do so.”

“If they followed their original requirements, they simply wouldn’t be able to find a single disciple.”

“Even though the disciples chosen by the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect now could all be regarded as geniuses of the younger generation, they were only able to be chosen because the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect lowered their requirements.”

“Furthermore, that requirement of theirs was lowered by an enormous amount,” said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“Master, apart from this, is there any other method?” asked Chu Feng.

“There is none. That’s the only way to enter the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect.”

“The only other method would be for the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect to choose you and bring you over on their own accord.”

“But, this old man felt that compared to the first method, the second method is much more feasible.”

“Based on the requirements the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect make their disciple selections, you’re already qualified.”

“Furthermore, you’ve gained some reputation now.”

“But, it doesn’t mean that all the geniuses of the younger generation that passed their current requirements will be chosen by the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect.”

“If that was the case, wouldn’t all the geniuses of the Holy Light Galaxy end up entering the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect?”

While the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s words seemed to be comforting Chu Feng, hearing them only brought Chu Feng and Yu Ting even greater despair.

Yu Ting’s eyes had turned completely lifeless. She felt that it was practically impossible to return to the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect.

But, Chu Feng had no intention to give up.

“No, there’s another way.”

“There must be another way.”

“I’ve heard that the Holy Light Clan is able to visit the Hidden Martial Dragon Sect at will.”

“I could ask the Holy Light Clan for help,” said Chu Feng.

Even though Chu Feng knew that obtaining the Holy Light Clan’s help would be something very difficult to accomplish, it was the only opportunity Chu Feng had left.

No matter how difficult, he must still attempt it.

“Kiddo, you’re wrong.”

“What you’ve heard of was in the past.”

“Right now, not even the Holy Light Clan is able to find the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect.”

“According to the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, the Holy Light Clan is too weak right now. They’ve lost the qualification to enter the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect,” said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.
