Chapter 4841: Mysterious Existence

The one who destroyed the black aura released by the vice sectmaster wasn’t Chu Feng but a power hiding in the calamity.

This power was different from the calamity itself, meaning that it was an external force, but why would it help Chu Feng?

Chu Feng guessed that the key to breaking the calamity might be for him to grasp that power and use it to fight the calamity. So, he entered the calamity once more and tried to reach out to the power so as to control it.

He succeeded, and that was why the calamity dissipated.

But what was weird was that the calamity didn’t dissipate because he destroyed it. Rather, the moment he fused together with that power, the calamity started breaking down on its own accord.

This left him puzzled.

What was even odder was that the power actually took control of him and teleported him into another space while the calamity was breaking down.

It was a familiar place to Chu Feng—Yinyang Withered Well Realm.

“Why was I brought here?” Chu Feng murmured in confusion.

It felt like the sole mission entrusted to the power hiding in the calamity was to bring him in here, for it disappeared right after he was teleported here.

Chu Feng was completely lost. He didn’t even know how he could escape from this place.

However, he wasn’t too frightened by this bewildering situation. He swiftly figured that the calamity might be related to those mysterious existence hiding in the Yinyang Withered Well Realm.

“Why is the Hidden Dragon Soul Armor with someone else?” a voice suddenly echoed.

Chu Feng couldn’t see the person who spoke, but he was overjoyed to hear that voice. He recognized the voice.

It was the mysterious voice he had encountered when he first challenged the Hidden Dragon Selection Formation. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Elder, you’re really here!” Chu Feng remarked in delight.

This mysterious voice was the first entity Chu Feng encountered when he entered the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, so he felt a sense of intimacy with the other party.

“Oh? It looks like you’ve guessed that I’d be here?” the mysterious voice asked.

The voice seemed to have come from a faraway place, but it was oddly clear.

“That isn’t too difficult to guess. You wield great prowess but aren’t a member of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, so it stands to reason that you’re here,” Chu Feng said with a chuckle.

Despite knowing that the owner of the mysterious voice was someone formidable, he wasn’t too worried because his intuition told him that the other party wasn’t a bad person.

“Quit it with the flattering. I asked you why you gave the Hidden Dragon Soul Armor to someone else?” the mysterious voice asked.

“Elder, she is my wife, not an outsider. My wife’s soul is impaired, and the Hidden Dragon Soul Armor is able to alleviate her condition. What reason do I have not to give it to her?

“Besides, isn’t the Hidden Dragon Soul Armor a prize I received from clearing the sect founder’s Hidden Dragon Selection Formation? If so, shouldn’t I have the right to decide who to give it to?” Chu Feng asked.

“You do have the right to decide who you want to give it to, but the fact that you handed it into the hands of someone else means that you won’t be able to break the calamity anymore. What are you thinking, stepping into the calamity all alone without any help or the Hidden Dragon Soul Armor? Are you courting death? Did you get your head kicked by a horse?

“If not for my help, your soul would have already dissipated to the calamity!” the mysterious voice bellowed.

“Ah, it was elder who helped me earlier. You have my deepest gratitude,” Chu Feng asked.

He had no idea where the owner of the mysterious voice was, he could only bow in the direction where he thought that voice was coming from.

“Don’t try to butter up to me! I broke the rules by breaking the calamity on your behalf, so you must undergo a new trial!” the mysterious voice said.

Another field of lightning appeared right in front of Chu Feng. The lightning came in six different colors, and for some reason, it bore great resemblance to the Heavenly Lightning Bloodline, though they didn’t seem to be the same thing either.

The lightning bolts were interwoven together, forming a thousand meters tall gate of lightning.

“Enter the gate. If you’re able to escape safely, I’ll let you off,” the mysterious voice said.

“Elder, are you serious about this?”

Chu Feng took a look at the lightning gate in front of him and saw that the interior of the gate was completely covered in lightning, zapping to and fro like sharp daggers.

Anyone who stepped in wouldn’t be able to hide from the lightning. It seemed to be even more frightening than the calamity itself.

Chu Feng couldn’t help but wonder if he would really be able to come out alive if he were to step into the lightning gate.

“I’ll massacre everyone in the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect if you don’t enter the lightning gate. They wouldn’t even get a chance to leave the sect,” the mysterious voice said.

“Elder, who are you? Could it be that... you’re acquainted with the sect founder?” Chu Feng asked.

A hint of nervousness struck his heart. He could tell that the mysterious voice wasn’t joking around. The owner of the mysterious voice was an unfathomable existence who could alter Duan Liufeng’s memories without the latter noticing that something was amiss.

Someone who possessed such means indubitably wielded the power to massacre everyone in the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect.

“Lad, stop prattling off. I’m giving you a chance here not just to save yourself but everyone in the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect. This includes your friends, your brother, and that wife you spoke of,” the mysterious voice said.

“Elder, will this be all over once we pass through the lightning gate?” Chu Feng asked.

“Of course!” the mysterious voice replied.

Having received the confirmation, Chu Feng quickly gathered his focus and conditioned himself to his best state before walking into the lightning gate.

“Hm?”

The lightning looked like the sharp jaws of a ferocious beast that would tear apart anything that stood in its path, but to Chu Feng’s surprise, it opened up a path wherever he passed.

It was unbelievable, but it looked like the lightning was afraid of him!

“How could this be?”

Those words came not from Chu Feng but somewhere else in the Yinyang Withered Well Realm.

At this very place were two gigantic silhouettes. One was a humanoid monster that towered at over ten thousand meters tall, and an ugly monstrous old man stood atop of this monster.

The one who had said those words was the monstrous old man.

Above the monstrous old man was another figure that was even larger than the humanoid monster. His body was beyond the sky, but even so, his sheer size made the ten thousand meters tall humanoid monster look tiny in comparison.

It was as if the world wasn’t big enough to fit him in.

“Lord Long Xie, how did this happen?” the monstrous old man asked the massive figure beyond the sky.

“I have no idea as well. Is that child so talented that even the Heavenly Lightning Bug dare not to approach him?” Lord Long Xie was baffled too.

His voice sounded identical to that of the mysterious voice. In other words, Long Xie was the mysterious entity whom Chu Feng had interacted with back at the Hidden Dragon Selection Formation!
