Chapter 5126: Night Monarch

While the tower looked small on the outside, it was a completely different world within.

Chu Feng’s eyes were already set in a single direction, so he advanced without dragging his feet. He could tell that the ancient tower used to be sealed off by a formation, but the formation was removed for some reason.

Regardless of the reason, the absence of a defensive formation meant that the ancient tower was nothing but a sheet of blank paper before Chu Feng’s eyes. He could clearly see through it even while he was outside earlier.

Not only was he able to determine the location of the Night Monarch, but he also discovered that the Night Monarch was in a weakened state. That being said, he could tell that the Night Monarch had the potential to be much stronger than his current state.

He guessed that the Night Monarch was only weakened due to his recent awakening. It was likely that the Night Monarch had ordered the leader of the guards to tribute everyone to him so that he could recover his own body.

In other words, now was the ideal opportunity to deal with the Night Monarch. If they waited till the Night Monarch recovered, the ones who would be killed were them.

Chu Feng soon arrived before a hall.

The hall was so massive that it was impossible to see the other end of it. It felt as if a small realm was constructed inside of brick walls. At the center of the hall was a powerful rectangular formation reminiscent of a coffin.

A figure was lying inside the formation.

It was around thirty meters tall, reminiscent of a giant. There were two horns extending from its head, suggesting that it was a monstrous beast that had transmogrified into a human. Its skin was charred, making it impossible to make out its facial features.

Without a doubt, it was the Night Monarch, the master of the Darknight Sacred River.

Chu Feng initially couldn’t discern the Night Monarch’s cultivation due to the distance between them. All he knew was that the latter was in a weakened state due to having just awakened from his slumber. However, as he came closer, he swiftly noticed that the Night Monarch was at the same cultivation rank as the Asura King, rank four Half-God level.

This meant that the Asura King had the ability to deal with the Night Monarch.

“Master.”

The Asura King looked at Chu Feng for orders.

“Get rid of him,” Chu Feng ordered without any hesitation.

He could tell that the Night Monarch was still not in a fully-conscious state, making this the ideal opportunity to get rid of him.

The Asura King immediately summoned a ten thousand meters wide black aura hand that surged toward the Night Monarch, but as it was approaching the latter’s body, it suddenly froze in place. It was almost as if someone had halted it in mid-air.

Boom!

A massive explosion occurred the next moment.

Ripples suddenly ran through the black aura hand, and it was abruptly blasted into all directions. A force had ripped it apart.

The Asura King quickly positioned himself in front of Chu Feng, and the remaining Asura World Spirits hurriedly drew their weapons to protect Chu Feng. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

They realized that the Night Monarch was actually conscious. A huge fight was awaiting them!

Kacha!

Kacha!

…

Cracks started appearing on the Night Monarch’s charred body after blocking the Asura King’s attack. Its blackened skin started to peel off, revealing its true appearance.

The Night Monarch had charming facial features that were reminiscent of a human, if not for its towering physique and the two yak horns extending on its head. Its hair cascaded down to its waist, sitting at a length of over twenty meters. Unclothed, its beautiful toned body was in plain sight.

What was surprising about the Night Monarch was its eerily pale skin that was reminiscent of a corpse. It made it appear frightening despite its charming face and beautiful toned body.

The Night Monarch slowly floated into the air, its black hair fluttering quietly behind it.

There was no change in its aura, but the hall started to tremble as if it was responding to its calls.

Even though they were both at rank four Half-God level, the aura emanated by the Night Monarch far surpassed that of the Asura King. The Asura King couldn’t help but frown.

The Night Monarch opened its pitch-black eyes and cast its gaze at Chu Feng. Its gaze was neither terrifying nor vicious, but Chu Feng still felt incredibly pressured under its stare.

Chu Feng knew that even though the Night Monarch was at rank four Half-God at the moment, this wasn’t his real cultivation level. It had regressed due to several reasons, but it should be possible for him to recover his cultivation once his condition improved.

Judging by the pressure he was giving off, his true cultivation level was bound to be extremely high, perhaps even surpassing the boundaries of Half-God.

“Are you the one who intruded into my domain? How weak. If I had known, I wouldn’t have bothered waking up for this,” the Night Monarch mocked.

He didn’t even cast an eye on the Asura World Spirit Army at all, as if they weren’t worth a mention at all.

Chu Feng didn’t answer the Night Monarch’s question. He knew how dangerous the Night Monarch was, so he sent a voice transmission to the Asura King, “Elder, you have to kill him no matter what it takes. Otherwise, we’ll all die here.”

Boom!

The Asura King summoned a black sword with a flick of his wrist before leaping into the air. It swung the black sword down upon the Night Monarch. This slash harnessed so much strength that even space was crushed in its presence.

Yet, all the Night Monarch did was raise its hand. Its movements were extremely slow, but for some reason, with a loud clang, it managed to stop the Asura King’s attack. With just its palm, it tightly held onto the Asura King’s sword.

Chu Feng immediately realized that the situation had gone awry.

There was a change in the Night Monarch’s cultivation. It had risen from rank four Half-God level to rank five.

The Night Monarch finally cast its gaze on the Asura King.

“Asura Evil Spirits. I used to enjoy hunting your people. I never thought that the first beings I would kill after my awakening would be you people. Is this heaven’s will? It looks like our meeting was destined.”

The Night Monarch’s lips curled into an evil smile.
