Chapter 5391: Land of Transformations

Dang!

Dang!

The chimes of a bell echoed outside.

“How punctual,” Chu Feng sneered.

It was finally the agreed time with Lord Shuang Yu, but Chu Feng didn’t get moving right away as he was still waiting for Ling Sheng’er. He didn’t see a need to rush since Lord Shuang Yu’s true target was him. There was no reason for her to rush Bai Yunqing’s execution as long as he was still here.

A while later, Ling Sheng’er finally returned.

However, her expression showed that the result of her investigation was less than satisfactory. “Chu Feng, I have already asked everyone I could, but no one knows where that spirit formation gate is.”

Chu Feng frowned upon hearing the answer. It looked like things were more troublesome than he had expected.

“Are you really going there?” Ling Sheng’er asked. She didn’t want Chu Feng to head there.

“Miss Sheng’er, please don’t worry about me. Just watch my performance,” Chu Feng replied with a chuckle. He stepped out of his accommodations and headed in the direction where the bell chimes were coming from. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Ling Sheng’er concealed herself with the invisibility cloak before following him.

Chu Feng could sense an invisible aura following him. He knew that it was the guard who had been camping outside his palace. In a sense, this showed just how formidable Ling Sheng’er invisibility cloak was, as he couldn’t sense her presence at all.

“It’s pretty far away despite sounding so close,” Chu Feng remarked.

He thought that he would swiftly reach the bell, but he was still nowhere close despite having flown for quite some distance now.

“It’s located at the center of this land,” Ling Sheng’er explained.

“Miss Sheng’er knows where it is?” Chu Feng asked.

He had a feeling that there was a special significance about the place he was heading to. Otherwise, there was no need for Lord Shuang Yu and Zhou Jie to specifically select a faraway location just to deal with him and Bai Yunqing.

“This unique bell chime can only come from the Land of Transformation, though we more commonly term it as the ‘Final Dueling Ground’. Speaking of which, it is quite an interesting place,” Ling Sheng’er said.

“What’s interesting about it?” Chu Feng asked.

“Phenomenons appear whenever people fight there. The stronger the phenomenon, the more talented the two individuals fighting are. Back then, the spar between Lord Jie Ranqing and my mother induced a grand phenomenon of interweaving black and red auras. It was amazing.

“Of course, my mother wasn’t a match for Lord Jie Ranqing at all. They only sparred because Lord Jie Ranqing was curious to know what kinds of phenomena could arise from the Land of Transformation. The phenomenon would have been even more impressive if Lord Jie Ranqing fought with a stronger opponent. Do you know why they chose that place now?” Ling Sheng’er asked.

“I get it. They want to squeeze every last bit of value out of me,” Chu Feng said.

“Indeed. Jie Zhou is decently talented, and you far surpass him. A battle between you two is bound to induce an incredible phenomenon. The intensity of the phenomenon tends to be attributed to the winner since the winner should be the stronger of the two. People will naturally think that the phenomenon was caused by Jie Zhou and not you.

“In other words, you will, in the truest sense, become Jie Zhou’s stepping stone. That’s also the reason I don’t want you to go there,” Ling Sheng’er said.

“I already told you. Look forward to my performance,” Chu Feng replied with a smile.

“Chu Feng, what are you planning?” Ling Sheng’er asked.

From those words, she could tell that Chu Feng was not planning to obediently follow the script Lord Shuang Yu and Jie Zhou had prepared for him, but the best way to save Bai Yunqing was to simply submit to them. Otherwise, they would only suffer.

“You’ll know soon enough,” Chu Feng replied.

The Land of Transformation was quite far away, but the two of them still managed to arrive at their destination. As Chu Feng got delayed a little from waiting for Ling Sheng’er, there was already a sizable crowd gathered in the vicinity. Even so, more people were still coming in.

It was an empty plain with a square in the middle. A massive bell hung by the side of the square. The loud chimes that echoed throughout the entire Divine Inheritance Ground came from none other than that massive bell.

A stone monument inscribed with the words ‘Land of Transformation’ was erected by the side of the square.

Other than these, there was nothing else here. This place seemed to serve as a dueling platform and nothing more.

Bai Yunqing, Lord Shuang Yu, and Jie Zhou had already arrived.

The crowd noticed that Bai Yuqning was bound, and it sparked fervent discussion as to what could have happened. They deduced that Bai Yunqing must have committed a crime, just that they didn’t know the details.

Lord Shuang Yu patiently waited by the side for the final actor to arrive. As soon as Chu Feng arrived at the square, she rose to her feet and said, “Everyone, our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion has welcomed Bai Yunqing as an esteemed guest, yet he attempted to steal our invaluable Life Crystal. In accordance with our rules, theft is a grievous crime, not to mention that the item he tried to steal was of immeasurable value. In view of his sin, I’ll be sentencing him to death.”

The juniors turned their eyes to Chu Feng upon hearing those words.

They had heard about Chu Feng’s affairs, so they knew that the one who needed Life Crystals was Chu Feng and not Bai Yunqing. There was a high chance that Chu Feng was the one who instigated Bai Yunqing into stealing the Life Crystals.

Bai Yunqing’s eyes blazed with anger. He wanted to tell the truth, but he was unable to speak or move. Lord Shuang Yu had secretly used a formation to seal off his mouth, just that none of the juniors was able to see through that.

Seeing that the time was ripe, Jie Zhou stepped forward and said, “Lord Shuang Yu, I think that there’s more than meets the eye. There’s no reason for Bai Yunqing to take this risk since he doesn’t need Life Crystals.”

He then turned his sight to Chu Feng. The intention behind his gaze was clear to everyone.

“Heh… Get straight to the point,” Chu Feng said.

“Brother Chu Feng, you are the one who should be getting straight to the point,” Jie Zhou said.

“You’re trying to say that I’m the one who instigated Bai Yunqing into it, right?” Chu Feng asked.

“Brother Chu Feng, you should frankly admit to it if you’re a man. Don’t let your brother take the fall for you,” Jie Zhou said.

“Young friend Chu Feng, is it really you?” Lord Shuang Yu asked.

She was the mastermind behind it all, yet she was acting as if she was shocked by the news. Her words ‘young friend’ made Chu Feng feel a wave of revulsion.

Chu Feng ignored Jie Zhou and Lord Shuang Yu and instead turned to the crowd and asked, “Will any of you believe it if I say that Bai Yunqing has been framed? Bai Yunqing didn’t steal any Life Crystals, and I didn’t instigate him into anything.”

Those words further fanned the commotion.

Jie Zhou turned to look at Lord Shuang Yu, and the latter’s face darkened. This was not what they had agreed on.

Lord Shuang Yu quickly sent a voice transmission to Chu Feng. “I’ll kill the two of you if you dare to play tricks.”

Faced with Lord Shuang Yu’s threat, Chu Feng chuckled under his breath before turning to Jie Zhou. “Jie Zhou, why are you looking at Shuang Yu? Are you losing your nerves?”
