Chapter 5903: A Familiar Yet Dangerous Aura

The Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief and Elder Sheng carefully searched the area. They had slowly calmed down since, but the worry on their faces only deepened.

“Father, what’s wrong?” Sansheng Qiutian asked aloud.

It was only then that Elder Sheng remembered Chu Feng and the others were still around, so he dispelled the treasure sealing off Chu Feng.

Sansheng Qiutian and Sansheng Xingyu quickly flew into the Sacred Temple. Chu Feng and Zi Ling followed suit.

“Elder, what are these?” Chu Feng got straight to the point.

“These can be considered to be our Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s sacred treasures too,” the clan chief replied before explaining the situation.

The Sacred Temple was a place where their sacred treasures were stored, but the true sacred treasures weren’t placed on the altar but in the center of the hall. The jars on the altar were deemed to be second only to their sacred treasures in their heritage, but the clansmen weren’t sure what those jars were either.

However, they knew that these jars were important to them and that they contained some unknown power. That was why the Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief and Elder Sheng were so worried upon discovering that one jar was missing.

They thought that what was stored within the jar had broken out and was hiding in the Sacred Temple. That could pose a danger to them.

However, the situation appeared to be different from what they had expected. Rather than something breaking out of the jar, it looked more like someone had taken the entire jar away. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“This is weird. Why would a jar suddenly vanish into thin air? Chu Feng, can you help us take a look?” the clan chief asked.

“Well...” Chu Feng was tempted to reveal that he might have encountered that jar when he first entered the sacred mountain, and he might have released whatever was in it. The empty jar was currently sitting in his Cosmos Sack.

However, Chu Feng eventually decided against it because he thought of a possibility—his father might just have been behind the missing jar. What were the chances of such an important jar coincidentally appearing before him when he first entered the sacred mountain back then?

The chances were that his father had arranged for it to happen.

“Elder, let me take a look.” Even though he decided not to tell the truth, Chu Feng put on an act and began examining the surroundings.

He quickly realized that the Sacred Temple was a huge formation, and they were standing in the formation core. Some of the formation’s energy was channeled toward those jars, but the bulk of it was flowing toward the center of the hall, where the sacred treasures used to be placed.

Chu Feng couldn’t tell what was inside the jars, but he had a guess in mind.

The jar contains some kind of living entity. The trials require the participation of the Three Saints Monstrous Clansmen, whereas outsiders can only assist. The final formation is an assimilation formation

Putting all of these together, perhaps the so-called sacred treasures need to be nourished or nurtured through the Three Saints Monstrous Clansmen’s energy, possibly for them to awaken and take control of the entities inside the jars.

“Elder, I have a question. I hope you can be honest with me,” Chu Feng said.

“Speak,” the clan chief replied.

“You entered the first of the last two formations together with my father, right?” Chu Feng asked.

“Yes. He wanted to breach the formation, but he couldn’t do it alone, so I entered it with him,” the clan chief replied.

“Can you tell me what you encountered inside the formation?” Chu Feng asked.

“Of course.”

The Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief told Chu Feng what he had encountered in the first formation back then. The trials they encountered along the way were different, but the last part of the trial was an assimilation formation too.

“Why would there be an assimilation formation?” Elder Sheng was astonished.

Clearly, he was unaware of the details of the last two formations.

Assimilation formations targeted at living things tended to be malevolent. That was why Elder Sheng was shocked to hear that. He couldn’t understand why the training ground prepared by their ancestor had an assimilation formation.

“It’s indeed an assimilation formation. I couldn’t figure out why it’s there, and I didn’t want to worry you or my father, so I didn’t tell you about it,” the clan chief said.

“Father, did you get assimilated?” Sansheng Qiutian asked.

“Of course,” the clan chief replied.

“Then why was the assimilation formation we encountered inactive?” Sansheng Qiutian was confused.

“You encountered any assimilation formation too?” The clan chief was taken aback.

“Indeed. The last trial of our formation was also an assimilation formation, just that it was inactive,” Sansheng Qiutian replied.

“Inactive? No wonder,” the clan chief remarked.

“What do you mean?” Sansheng Qiutian asked.

“It’s no wonder you came out safe and sound. Chu Feng’s father and I nearly died inside,” the clan chief said fearfully. However, he quickly snapped out of it and asked, “Chu Feng, why are you asking about this?”

“Elder Clan Chief, I have a bold guess. Your training ground’s true purpose might be more than just passing down your clan’s legacy. I suspect the goal is to pick the most outstanding clansman, obtain their energy via the assimilation formation, and use it to awaken and control the sacred treasures,” Chu Feng said.

“Awaken the sacred treasures?” The clan chief and Elder Sheng fell into deep thought.

“I suspect that you and my father have awakened the sacred treasures back then, though I’m not sure why the sacred treasures disappeared. Elder, can you tell me how you found out about the sacred treasures’ disappearance back then?” Chu Feng asked.

“Your father and I returned to the mountain peak after breaching the formation. The Sacred Temple appeared and bestowed energy upon us before opening its doors. I saw the container holding our sacred treasure had shattered, and the sacred treasures were nowhere to be seen. That’s why we thought your father failed to breach the formation back then,” the clan chief said.

“Where is the container for the sacred treasure?” Chu Feng asked.

“It’s with me,” the clan chief replied. With a wave of his sleeves, a black bottle appeared.

As soon as the black bottle appeared, the Divine Deer exclaimed, “Chu Feng, that aura!”

“Elder, I feel it too.” Chu Feng was shocked as well.

The two of them sensed a familiar but dangerous aura from the black bottle—the Darkness Monstrous God’s shell!
