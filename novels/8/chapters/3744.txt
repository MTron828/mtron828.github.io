Chapter 3744 - Sensing The Disparity

“Chu Feng, I had originally wanted to play with you for a bit longer.”

“Never would I have imagined that me deciding to have some fun with you would actually make you overthink this much.”

“Did you really think you’d be able to defeat me?”

“Since you have this sort of delusion, I will have to personally extinguish it.”

“Buzz~~~”

After Linghu Hongfei finished saying those words, his cultivation increased again. From rank seven Exalted, he became a rank eight Exalted.

It was the Cyan Nethersoul!!!

Linghu Hongfei had used the Cyan Nethersoul, the powerful treasure within him.

“Is it time for the outcome to be decided?”

After Linghu Hongfei unleashed the power of his Cyan Nethersoul, many people felt that the curtains would drop on the match.

After all, according to their knowledge, Chu Feng seemed to not possess a treasure capable of increasing his cultivation.

As for treasures capable of increasing one’s cultivation, they were extremely difficult to master.

Take Linghu Hongfei’s Cyan Nethersoul for example. It was a treasure that he had fused with as an infant.

Thus, the crowd felt that even if Chu Feng had gained a treasure that could increase his cultivation, he couldn’t possibly fuse with it in such a short period of time.

If Chu Feng hadn’t fused with a treasure capable of increasing his cultivation, how could he possibly contend against Linghu Hongfei?

“Roooarr~~~”

To everyone’s surprise, after Linghu Hongfei unleashed the power of his Cyan Nethersoul, an ear-piercing roar sounded from Chu Feng’s body.

After that roar was heard, boundless flames were released from Chu Feng’s body.

The flames revolved in the air, covering the crowd’s field of view. They were truly beautiful.

However, upon closer inspection, one would notice that they were not flames at all. Instead, they were fiery-red symbols and runes.

The symbols and runes interwove with one another and radiated fiery light all over. They appeared like flames, but were not flames at all. Instead, they were high level runes.

That said, that wasn’t what was important. What was important was that after the fiery runes were released, they changed form and took the form of an enormous Qilin on Chu Feng’s body.

The ear-piercing roar had come from that enormous Fire Qilin.

At that moment, Chu Feng’s cultivation also increased from rank seven Exalted to rank eight Exalted.

“Chu Feng actually also possesses such a cultivation treasure?!”

“Furthermore, judging from the look of things, that’s a legendary treasure, the Fire Qilin Talisman!!!” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Fire Qilin Talisman. That is indeed the Fire Qilin Talisman.”

“Wasn’t that treasure in Gu Mingyuan’s possession the entire time? Someone once offered a high price to purchase it. Yet, Gu Mingyuan refused to sell. She actually gave it to Chu Feng?”

“It would appear that their relationship is truly extraordinary. She actually gave such a precious item away.”

The crowd actually managed to recognize the power that Chu Feng had unleashed to be that of the Fire Qilin Talisman.

Their reactions were understandable too. After all, treasures capable of increasing one’s cultivation were all extremely famous in the Ancestral Martial Starfield. Practically everyone had heard about them.

As for that Fire Qilin Talisman, it was particularly famous.

Although the crowd had never witnessed the power of the Fire Qilin Talisman before, they’d read its description, and knew its rough shape.

On top of that, they knew that there was an extraordinary relationship between Chu Feng and Gu Mingyuan. Thus, the crowd instantly came to the conclusion that the ability Chu Feng had used was the power of the Fire Qilin Talisman.

“His relationship with Gu Mingyuan is not what’s important. What’s important is that the Fire Qilin Talisman is very difficult to handle. Yet, Chu Feng actually managed to subdue that treasure.”

“That’s right. I’ve heard that the Fire Qilin Talisman is extremely fierce, and could be considered to be one of the most difficult treasures to master.”

The crowd began to discuss things spiritedly. Although the Fire Qilin Talisman was something that Chu Feng’s father and Gu Mingyuan had obtained in a remnant, it was actually already famous to begin with.

There were a lot of records of the Fire Qilin Talisman.

That was the reason why the crowd knew about it so well even without having witnessed its might before.

According to the records, the Fire Qilin within the Fire Qilin Talisman was extremely berserk. Because of that, the Fire Qilin Talisman was an extremely difficult treasure to master.

There were even rumors that Gu Mingyuan herself had attempted to fuse with it in the past. Yet, she had failed to do so.

When even a genius of her caliber had failed to fuse with the Fire Qilin Talisman, one could well imagine how difficult it was to fuse with it.

Logically, even if Chu Feng had started to try to fuse with the Fire Qilin Talisman since his childhood, it would still be extremely difficult to succeed.

Furthermore, just several months ago, there were people that had witnessed the Fire Qilin Talisman in Gu Mingyuan’s possession.

Because of this, the crowd knew that Chu Feng must’ve fused with it only recently. In fact, it was very possible that he had successfully accomplished the fusion in only a few months’ time.

This naturally caused the crowd to feel admiration for him.

However, if they were to know that Chu Feng had actually only spent a mere hour to fuse with the Fire Qilin Talisman, they would likely feel even more disbelief.

“Rumble~~~”

“Rumble~~~”

At that moment, explosions sounded in the sky nonstop.

At the moment when the crowd were feeling shocked, Chu Feng and Linghu Hongfei had collided again.

This time around, they were no longer exchanging simple blows, no longer simply slashing with their weapons.

The two of them were both using Immortal Techniques and Martial Skills.

With the situation being like that, the sky was soon engulfed by powerful energy ripples.

At one moment, flames filled the sky. The next moment, surging waves appeared. After that came lightning, followed by violent rainstorms.

In fact, enormous ferocious beasts and armies of several tens of thousands would appear in the sky to besiege the other fighter.

Those were all caused by martial skills or Immortal Techniques.

Martial skills and Immortal Techniques possessed countless transformations. This was the joy of cultivation.

Thus, after Chu Feng and Linghu Hongfei began to use Immortal Techniques and martial skills, the battle truly became a marvelous sight to behold.

Even in terms of Immortal Techniques and martial skills, Chu Feng and Linghu Hongfei possessed superb attainments.

Not to mention the people of the younger generation, even the people of the older generation felt far inferior.

Chu Feng and Linghu Hongfei exchanged attacks back and forth. They were using all kinds of attacks. It was truly a marvelous sight.

Seeing their battle, even the people of the older generation that had cultivated for many years were staring in awe.

As for the people of the younger generation, they were completely stupefied, and completely stunned.

People and powers from all over the Ancestral Martial Starfield had come to witness this battle.

Naturally, among them were people of the younger generation that had fought against Chu Feng before.

Chu Huanyu, Chu Haoyan, Xia Yun’er, Song Yunfei, Li Anzhi, Li Tianyou, Tang Zhenghao and others...

They were all top geniuses from their respective powers.

During specific times in the past, they were on par with or even stronger than Chu Feng.

However, at that moment, they were unable to even see his battle clearly. They could only sense the overflowing might, but were unable to see any details of the battle.

Because of that,they all had the same sort of expressions in their eyes. From their expressions, it seemed like they’d realized that the disparity between themselves and Chu Feng had reached a level where they could not catch up.
