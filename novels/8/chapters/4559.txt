Chapter 4559: The Strongest Expert in the Galaxy

Hu!

The black-robed man looked at Yin Buyu coldly as an even greater amount of black aura poured out from his body.

The hand morphed out of black aura had released Yin Buyu’s neck, but the black aura had formed dozens of sharp claws that encircled him tightly.

From the looks of it, if Yin Buyu were to dare move recklessly, he would be immediately torn to pieces.

“D-don’t kill me, I am the young master of the Yin Clan Manor! My father and the other elders are all here, and they’re right outside! If you don’t believe me, you can take a look for yourself!

“If any harm were to befall me, my father and the other elders will definitely not let you off!”

Yin Buyu was completely panicked. The previous oppressive posture he took had been replaced by terror.

“Yin Clan Manor? Never heard of it before. Not even the Holy Light Clan is worthy of my sights, let alone a nameless power!” the black-robed man scoffed.

It didn’t look like he was just putting on an act of bravado. His relaxed posture was filled with confidence, revealing his utter lack of fear.

Hearing those words from the black-robed man, and putting it together with his unfathomable strength and his condescending attitude, Yin Buyu felt his heart clenching up tightly as he gulped down a mouthful of saliva.

He realized that he was standing before a person far beyond his means to deal with, and he dared not to show any signs of arrogance anymore.

“Milord, as long as you spare me, I’ll tell you whatever you wish to know.”

Yin Buyu tossed aside his dignity and assumed an incredibly humble position. Even if the black-robed man were to ask him to kneel right now, he would do it without hesitation.

“Tell me, what’s going on with that Chu Feng person you keep talking about the last few days? Is he very strong amongst the juniors?” the black-robed man asked.

“That’s right. Chu Feng is the strongest junior in the galaxy right now. However, he’s also an incredibly conceited individual too. He declared that every other junior aside from him in the Holy Light Galaxy are all trash, not worthy of mention at all.

“It’s due to his arrogance that I made up my mind to defeat him so as to crush his overbearing attitude.”

Yin Buyu was also a despicable man too.

When he realized that the black-robed man could have very well been here for the tournament too, he immediately began framing Chu Feng in a bad light, hoping that the black-robed man would deal with Chu Feng on his behalf.

He had a feeling that this black-robed man should be able to curb Chu Feng without any issue, especially since he had never felt such a terrifying pressure from any other junior to this date.

“Hearing you put it in such a way, it seems like Chu Feng is quite an interesting person. I’m starting to feel a little excited about meeting him,” the black-robed man remarked.

“This brother over here, even though Chu Feng is quite powerful, I reckon that he won’t be a match for you. As long as you were to make a move, you should be able to crush him with ease,” Yin Buyu said.

“Cut it with the bootlicking. You aren’t anything good either. However, on the account that you have told me some useful moves, I’ll let you off for stealing my cultivation resource then.”

After saying those words, the black-robed man retracted his black aura before retreating into the shadows and disappearing from view.

With the departure of the black-robed man, the space quickly reverted back to normal.

At this very moment, everyone from the Yin Clan Manor, including the Manor Chief, Yin Buyu’s father, was standing right outside the space.

The sudden disappearance of the space resulted in Yin Buyu to reappear back into the real world. He sat paralyzed on the ground, his body drenched in cold sweat.

This sight made those from the Yin Clan Manor realize that something was amiss, so they quickly rushed to Yin Buyu’s side.

“Buyu, what’s wrong?”

Yin Buyu’s father immediately rushed forward to support Yin Buyu as he asked.

“Father, it seems like we have underestimated the Holy Light Galaxy,” Yin Buyu muttered.

“What do you mean?” Yin Buyu’s father asked.

“I believe that the upcoming tournament will be an exciting one. Aside from the rising star Chu Feng, there are a few other people who will be making a name for themselves,” Yin Buyu said.

“Buyu, did you notice something? Who are you referring to?” Yin Buyu’s father asked.

Yin Buyu quickly told what he had just gone through to the crowd of the Yin Clan Manor.

“There’s actually such a formidable junior? Whose disciple is he?”

After hearing Yin Buyu’s words, even Yin Buyu’s father and the experts of the Yin Clan Manor swiftly realized that things weren’t as simple as they seemed.

If that space was created by the black-robed man for his cultivation, it was likely that he had some formidable treasure on him or had a powerful expert by his side.

...

The powers gathered in the Storm Realm had chosen to camp at different locations, but at this moment, almost everyone was gathered on a vast snowfield.

The day had finally come for the commencement of the tournament to determine the strongest junior.

Cultivators that had come from far and wide filled both land and sky like a huge army of locust. In the middle of this massive crowd, however, lay an empty ground surrounded by a spherical barrier. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

To be fair, this barrier wasn’t very strong, but the flags of the Holy Light Clan that were hoisted around it was more than sufficient to keep people away.

“Everyone, we have kept you waiting!”

A voice suddenly boomed from a distance away.

Turning the sights over to where the voice came from, the huge congregation of crowd immediately parted to open up a wide path leading to the spherical barrier.

In the next moment, several massive warships whizzed across the air in a neat formation.

The largest warship of the cluster had innumerable palaces, mountains, and even lakes on it, making it no different from a mobile country. There were numerous flags of the Holy Light Clan that fluttered along with the movements of the warship.

And standing at the forefront of the warship was a dark-skinned elder with silver hair and a long beard. He was dressed in silver armor, and a silver crown sat on top of his head.

Despite his advanced age, this elder commanded a powerful presence. Just a look from him was enough to compel deference and submission.

His disposition was so powerful that there was no one amongst the crowd who was able to undermine him. This was the airs of a true conqueror.

This elder was no other than the strongest expert of the Holy Light Galaxy, the Holy Light Clan’s Clan Chief, Shengguang Xuanye.

“Paying respects to Lord Clan Chief!”

Upon seeing Shengguang Xuanye, everyone present hurriedly bowed deeply and greeted him.

No one dared to act disrespectfully in the presence of this man. Even the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief and the others could only assume a subservient attitude before him.

“You may spare with the formalities.”

Shengguang Xuanye said with a grand wave of his sleeves, and an intangible force rippled into the surroundings, supporting everyone back upright while dissipating the barrier beneath.

Chu Feng was unable to accurately gauge Shengguang Xuanye’s cultivation, but there was no doubt that he was the strongest cultivator currently in this realm. It was no exaggeration to say that he had the power to decide everyone’s life and death.

After taking a brief look at Shengguang Xuanye, Chu Feng moved on to turn his gaze toward the very center of this snowfield.

After the dissipation of the barrier, a massive dueling ring that emanated an ancient scent came into appearance amidst the snow.

This was the heritage left behind by the Rampaging Storm Clan, the Storm Combat Dragon Ring!
