Chapter 5876: Entering the Sacred Mountain

Chu Feng wanted to bring Zi Ling into the forbidden land, but she was kept out by the protection formation. He could only enter by himself.

“It’s fine. You go in. I’ll wait outside for you,” Zi Ling said.

Chu Feng was afraid that Zi Ling would think too much into it, so he explained, “I don’t think my father was guarding against you. He probably just constructed the formation in a way that only I am only able to pass through it.”

“What are you talking about? There’s no way my master would be guarded against me. Hurry up and go in,” Zi Ling said with a chuckle.

She wouldn’t blame Chu Xuanyuan, even if he was guarded against her.

She was lacking in talent, such that she shouldn’t have been able to break out of Ancestral Martial Lower Realm like Jiang Wushang and Zhang Tianyi. It was thanks to Chu Xuanyuan that she was able to get this far.

“Wait for me,” Chu Feng said. He constructed a concealment formation to protect Zi Ling before entering the forbidden land.

As he walked through familiar places, all kinds of memories began surging into his mind. He remembered the first time he stepped into this place. His heart had been beating nervously as he didn’t know Old Ape was his father’s friend.

Yet, it was all empty now.

Chu Feng scanned the area with his Heaven’s Eyes, but he was unable to find the energy to awaken his bloodline power. Thus, he sat down and tried to sense it with his heart. He couldn’t sense anything at the start, but as time passed, he began to sense tremendous energy hidden in the area.

As soon as he sensed that energy, he felt like he had come into contact with a new world. That energy was exceedingly immense, to the point where he felt like a fish slipping into an ocean. He had no idea how huge this ocean was.

It was, in the truest sense, bottomless. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

But this was the limit of what he was capable of at the moment. He was unable to tell what kind of energy it was, and he couldn’t commune with it either. It was as if there was an invisible door blocking his path, keeping him out.

“Is my cultivation still not strong enough? My father was already far stronger than my current level when he brought me to the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm back then?”

Chu Feng tried a few more times, but he was unable to commune with the energy. He wasn’t too disappointed by the outcome though as he was already prepared for failure.

Thus, he left the forbidden land and found Zi Ling.

“How did it go, big brother Chu Feng?” Zi Ling asked.

“I still have to try harder,” Chu Feng replied with a smile.

“Are we returning to the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect now?” Zi Ling asked.

“We’re heading somewhere else first,” Chu Feng replied.

The two of them activated the teleportation formation and left the area. When they walked out of the teleportation passageway, they found themselves standing amid a mountain.

“Where are we, big brother Chu Feng?” Zi Ling asked.

“Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, Primal Sea Sacred Mountain.” Chu Feng proceeded to tell Zi Ling what he had encountered in the Primal Sea Sacred Mountain.

“You suspect that there’s a formidable treasure hidden in the Primal Sea Sacred Mountain?” Zi Ling asked.

Chu Feng was weak when he first entered the Primal Sea Sacred Mountain. It was normal for him to have encountered entities that he couldn’t deal with. However, things were different now.

“I’m not sure. I’ll have to see if I can activate the spirit formation gate leading into the Primal Sea Sacred Mountain. We’ll know very soon,” Chu Feng said.

He formed a hand seal and released his psyche. He was planning to open up a spirit formation gate leading straight into the Primal Sea Sacred Mountain.

If he couldn’t find the spirit formation gate leading into the Primal Sea Sacred Mountain even with his current spirit power, it would suggest that this place was not as simple as it seemed, and a true treasure was likely lurking within.

Conversely, if he could find it with ease, perhaps the Primal Sea Sacred Mountain wasn’t as impressive as he initially found it.

Soon, Chu Feng found the realm hidden inside the Primal Sea Sacred Mountain with ease, so he opened a spirit formation gate into it.

“Does that spirit formation gate lead into the Primal Sea Sacred Mountain?” Zi Ling asked.

“That’s right.” Chu Feng nodded.

“You seem to have found it quite easily,” Zi Ling remarked.

“I did, but it would be best not to underestimate the Primal Sea Sacred Mountain just yet.”

Chu Feng was prepared to thoroughly comb the area even though he wasn’t sure whether there was a treasure in there or not. It had left too deep of an impression on him.

Back then, he was traveling to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm with Ying Mingchao, Zi Xunyi, Wang Qiang, and Zhao Hong when they encountered a mysterious vortex in the Stairway to Heaven and ended up being separated.

Chu Feng was dragged into the realm within the Primal Sea Sacred Mountain.

This seemingly barren plain had left him with unforgettable memories. He stumbled upon an Immortal Taboo Martial Skill and even encountered a formidable monstrous beast and enigmatic creatures. He had to scurry out of this place to survive.

That made him feel small and insignificant.

However, he was not the same person he used to be. He was determined to get to the bottom of the Primal Sea Sacred Mountain and see what was hidden within.

“Zi Ling!” Chu Feng exclaimed in astonishment.

Zi Ling had already stepped into the spirit formation gate, so he quickly did the same too.

On the other side of the spirit formation gate was a barren plain devoid of any grass, yet a blazing sun shone on him from above. Noises could be vaguely heard in the far distance, and they sounded extremely eerie.

Zi Ling had already traveled a distance away. Upon seeing that Chu Feng had entered the realm too, she quickly ran back with a tattered book in hand.

“Big brother Chu Feng, there is an Immortal Taboo Martial Skill here!” Zi Ling exclaimed in excitement. She had found an Immortal Taboo Martial Skill as soon as she got in here.

Chu Feng took the manual from her and examined it. An expectant smile emerged on his lips.

“It looks like there might be formidable treasures lurking here,” Zi Ling said.

“Indeed.” Chu Feng nodded.

Even without resorting to his skills, he could already sense that there was something special about this realm. It looked like he had made the right choice coming here.

“Zi Ling, let’s conceal ourselves to avoid trouble,” Chu Feng said.

“Mm.” Zi Ling nodded.

Chu Feng constructed a powerful concealment formation around them. The two of them then rose into the sky, and Chu Feng activated his Heaven’s Eyes to scan the area.

It didn’t take him long to decide on a direction to travel toward. He even took out the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk, and interestingly enough, it provided him with guidance this time.
