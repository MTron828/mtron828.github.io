Chapter 5885: Contradictory Attitudes

Chapter 5885: Contradictory Attitudes

Chu Feng didn’t know that the two of them had intended to challenge him, but he could tell that something was weird about the atmosphere. Somehow, the Three Saints Monstrous Clansmen looked a little down.

Elder Sheng soon descended from the sky and landed before Chu Feng.

“Congratulations on entering the city, young friend Chu Feng,” Elder Sheng said.

“Elder, is my speed still fine?” Chu Feng asked.

“You’re the fastest in history to enter our clan,” Elder Sheng replied.

“Fastest?” Chu Feng was surprised.

“You surpassed your father.”

Those words shocked the crowd. He surpassed Chu Xuanyuan? But didn’t the two of them induce the golden monument?

“Wait, The monument of Chu Xuanyuan’s son is indeed slightly taller than Chu Xuanyuan’s.” Someone quickly noticed the difference.

The two monuments looked to be of the same height, but that was only because both were extremely tall. However, upon careful examination, Chu Feng’s stone monument was around half a meter taller than Chu Xuanyuan’s.

It was not a big difference, but it was something.

It was also then that Chu Feng noticed the golden monument. Seeing a monument with his name appearing beside a monument with his father’s name made him swell with happiness.

He had only met his father a couple of times before, and he had never met his mother before. Even so, he didn’t blame them for not being by his side, for he could feel the deep love they had for him. This was especially so after coming to know what they had been through.

Their kinship ran deep, and it couldn’t be undermined by anything. His parents held an important place in his heart. He was proud to be able to stand on the same ground as his father.

“Men, bring young hero Chu Feng to a distinguished guest room,” Elder Sheng ordered.

Two elders who resembled Elder Sheng in terms of appearance landed beside Chu Feng. “This way please, young hero Chu Feng.”

However, Chu Feng turned to Elder Sheng and asked, “Elder, where’s Zi Ling?”

He was more concerned about Zi Ling’s safety.

“Young friend Chu Feng, Miss Zi Ling is safe. Please allow me to look into this matter before replying,” Elder Sheng said.

“All right.”

Chu Feng realized that the people here addressed him as Chu Xuanyuan’s son instead of his name, indicating that his father was a renowned figure here. Some harbored animosity toward him, but most viewed him with respect or even fear.

This made him realize that the Three Saints Monstrous Clan was unlikely to be a hostile power. He felt uneasy not having confirmed Zi Ling’s safety, but it would seem excessive if he kicked up a fuss when nothing was confirmed. Thus, he heeded Elder Sheng’s arrangement and followed the two elders to his resting quarters.

“Elder Sheng, Chu Xuanyuan’s son is not a pushover,” someone remarked.

“Of course. Do you know who’s the strongest junior in the present era of cultivation?” Elder Sheng asked.

“Who?” the crowd asked.

This was a topic that interested the crowd.

A female junior amidst the crowd quickly connected the dots and asked, “Elder Sheng, it can’t be Chu Feng, right?”

“You’re sharp-witted.” Elder Sheng nodded in satisfaction.

“The heck! He’s the strongest junior in the present world of cultivation? No wonder! Who could have thought that Chu Xuanyuan’s son would be this formidable too?”

“He even surpassed his father!”

The crowd remarked wistfully.

Chu Feng’s title as the strongest junior in the present era carried some weight.

With Chu Feng’s current level of cultivation, he could hear the commotion in the square despite being a long distance away. This confirmed his suspicions that these people didn’t harbor strong enmity toward him.

Of course, some viewed him with animosity too, but those were in the minority.

His father had probably left a good impression on them despite his failure later on. At the very least, the Three Saints Monstrous Clansmen seemed to recognize his previous contributions. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have treated a sinner’s son so well.

Chu Feng was soon brought to a courtyard in the middle of the city. It was extremely small, especially when contrasted against the vast city, and its simplistic design felt out of place too. Yet, he felt comfortable here.

“Elder, did my father stay here?” Chu Feng asked.

It was faint, but he could sense his father’s aura.

One of the elders quickly replied, “Indeed. Each time Lord Chu Xuanyuan visited, he would always...”

“Cough cough!” The second elder suddenly interjected with a cough.

“Your father would always stay here each time he comes.” The first elder corrected his words, dropping the honorifics when addressing Chu Xuanyuan.

Fearing that Chu Feng might think too much, the second elder added, “Young hero Chu Feng, I know this courtyard is small, but it’s not that we have anything against you. Both the city and this distinguished guest room were built by our ancestors, and it wouldn’t do for us to change it.”

“There’s no need for that. This works fine,” Chu Feng replied.

“Young hero Chu Feng, we shan’t impose on you anymore. We’ll be standing at your doorstep. Feel free to call us if you need anything from us.”

With that, the two elders walked out and closed the door behind them.

“The people here seem to have a contradictory attitude toward my father.”

One of the elders blurted out the words ‘Lord Chu Xuanyuan’; it indicated that his father had a high standing here back then. However, the other elder correcting him showed that they minded that Chu Xuanyuan lost their sacred treasures.

On the one hand, they recognized Chu Xuanyuan’s contribution.

On the other hand, they couldn’t forgive him for his failure.

This resulted in the Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s dilemma.

“Hm? Is that person heading toward me?”

Chu Feng, through his psyche, noticed that someone was heading in his direction. It was a dashing man, but he had an angry look on his face.

That man landed in Chu Feng’s courtyard.

“Young master Qiutian.”

The two elders sensed the man’s intrusion, so they quickly pushed the door open and entered.

“Get out!”

Yet, a glance from the man addressed as young master Qiutian sent the two elders backing out of the courtyard in a hurry, and they even closed the doors behind them. They were afraid of this young master Qiutian. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“You are Chu Feng? Chu Xuanyuan is your father?” Qiutian puffed up his chest and looked at Chu Feng with lofty eyes.

“Do you need something from me?” Chu Feng asked.

“You’re rather calm. Do you know your woman is about to become someone else’s concubine?”
