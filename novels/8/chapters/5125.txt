Chapter 5125: Chu Feng’s Means

Don’t bother sparing anyone?

Those words shocked not just the crowd but Lord Yuwei as well. Those were their brethren, but Chu Feng wanted to kill all of them?

Shoosh!

While the crowd was still processing the situation, the Asura World Spirit Army had begun their slaughter. By the time the crowd finally registered the situation, those people had already been reduced to corpses.

Countless mutilated body parts fell from the sky with splashes of blood like torrential rain. It was a scene of absolute cruelty.

Those present here were cultivators who had grown accustomed to violence, but this appalling sight still left them paling in horror. Many vomited and even passed out.

As frightening as the guards were, they were still living beings.

Tens of millions of people were killed in the blink of an eye. It was hard for an ordinary person to stomach such violence. Furthermore, a million of them had been friends or acquaintances they had interacted with over their many years of incarceration.

Nothing could have shown the terror of the Asura World Spirit Army as vividly as this.

However, what the crowd feared the most wasn’t the Asura World Spirit Army nor the Asura King, but the young man who commanded them.

Chu Feng didn’t have a vicious appearance, but he was the one who issued the order for the massacre. Despite being the mastermind behind this tragedy, there was not the slightest change in his expression. It was almost as if he had only stomped ants he felt nothing for.

Not a single person dared to say a word, including Lord Bai and Lord Yuwei despite being on closer terms with him.

The atmosphere grew a little peculiar.

However, Chu Feng was unbothered by it. He had long gotten accustomed to such a reaction.

“I remember that they aren’t the only ones who have insulted Elder Yuwei earlier?” Chu Feng muttered as he cast his gaze into the crowd.

Many people had insulted Lord Yuwei earlier, and Chu Feng had imprinted each and every one of their faces to his memory.

“Milord, do we kill the rest of them too?” the Asura King asked while holding the head of the leader of the guards in his hand.

Klang!

The Asura World Spirit Army brandished their swords in response to the Asura King’s words. They were prepared to launch a second round of massacre the moment Chu Feng gave the word.

“Milord, spare us! Please, spare us! We have done wrong, but we were forced into it! Those aren’t our true feelings!”

Those who had insulted Lord Yuwei or displayed reluctance at her leadership immediately fell to their knees and kowtowed to Chu Feng for forgiveness. In fact, water started spraying down to the ground.

They had peed their pants.

However, no one could blame them for that after witnessing the cruelty Chu Feng was capable of. It was impossible to remain calm when faced with such a terrifying demon.

“The person you should be kneeling to isn’t me,” Chu Feng said.

The crowd caught Chu Feng’s drift and turned to beg Lord Yuwei for mercy.

“Do you expect to get off with just a bit of begging? Slap yourselves. I’ll take your lives if you don’t slap yourselves silly,” Chu Feng ordered. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

His words were spoken in a composed fashion, but the hostility in his words demanded obedience.

Pah pah pah!

Loud slapping sounds echoed in the air. Those who didn’t know better would have thought that someone had set off firecrackers.

The crowd slapped themselves with such force that it didn’t take long for their skin to tear, baring their flesh.

Unable to bear the sight any longer, Lord Yuwei stepped forward and spoke on their behalf, “Little young master, forget it.”

“Elder Yuwei, have you forgotten how they treated you earlier?” Chu Feng asked.

“Forget it, it’s just words. They didn’t do anything to me,” Lord Yuwei said.

“It’s just words? It’s only words because your cultivation is higher than theirs. If not for that, do you think that it would have ended with just words? If the leader of the guards were to hold you down and order them to turn their blades on you, they would have unhesitatingly plunged their blades into you!” Chu Feng said.

“…”

Lord Yuwei didn’t say a word. She didn’t know whether those people would really do that or not.

“Even if you can tolerate those people, I can’t,” Chu Feng said.

“Little young master, I know that you’re doing this for me, but these people have been with me for many years. I beg you to spare them on my account!” Lord Yuwei said.

“It’s on your account that they aren’t corpses now. Elder Yuwei, I am not a person completely devoid of kindness, but I only show them to people who are worthy of it. I hope that you can reconsider whether these people are truly worth your kindness or not,” Chu Feng said.

He then turned to the crowd and said, “Continue hitting yourself. I’d like to see who dares to stop until I give the order!”

Those people struck themselves harder than ever, fearing that Chu Feng would really take their lives. To them, this was a much better alternative than dying.

Lord Yuwei decided to back down and allow Chu Feng to do as he wished after hearing those words.

Meanwhile, Chu Feng turned his attention toward the ancient tower.

“Lord Yuwei, Lord Bai, wait out here for me.”

After saying those words, Chu Feng began leading the Asura World Spirit Army toward the ancient tower.

“Little young master, what are you planning to do?” Lord Yuwei asked in shock.

She didn’t approve of Chu Feng punishing the others in such a vicious manner, but she was still concerned about his safety.

“I’ll go meet the Night Monarch,” Chu Feng said.

“I’ll accompany you,” Lord Yuwei said.

“Elder Yuwei, you should stay here. It’s unlikely that you’ll be of help to me, and I’ll only be worried for your safety if you come with me,” Chu Feng said.

Lord Yuwei could only back down when Chu Feng had already put it out in such a straightforward manner. She wanted to accompany Chu Feng to help him, but it would be meaningless if she was only a burden to him.

So, she could only say, “Little young master, you must be careful.”

“Don’t worry, Elder Yuwei. I know what I’m doing.”

Chu Feng began making his way toward the ancient tower. It wasn’t locked, so he was able to push the door open and enter without an issue.
