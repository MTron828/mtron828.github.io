Chapter 3517 - Who Are You?

With Chu Feng’s assistance, not only did the expression of pain on Li Yue’er’s face gradually subside, but the lightning that filled the formation core also began to dissipate.

The formation core had returned to peacefulness.

Chu Feng knew that he had succeeded.

After verifying that Li Yue’er was fine, Chu Feng exited the formation core.

At that moment, he had concluded that the change occurring outside in the Li Heavenly Clan was caused by Li Yue’er.

Although the Li Heavenly Clan’s Ancestral Formation seemed to be in a very critical situation where it could explode at any given time when judging from the outside, it was actually only because Li Yue’er’s behavior inside the formation core was causing a reaction from it.

The Li Heavenly Clan’s Ancestral Formation would not really have any issues. The foundation left behind by generations of Li Heavenly Clan seniors and ancestors would be maintained.

“Wuuu~~~”

Suddenly, Chu Feng felt a burst of pain in his chest. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

However, that pain only lasted but a moment. Chu Feng thought that it was a side-effect caused by him withstanding the lightning strikes earlier. Thus, he did not think too much about the pain.

“Brat, you’ve made this old man have a whole new level of respect for you.”

“Firstly, this old man never would’ve expected you to truly be able to withstand the power inside the spirit formation.”

“More than that, this old man didn’t expect that you really entered it to help that girl Li Yue’er,” that mysterious voice sounded again.

At that moment, that voice became much more gentle. The skepticism and disdain toward Chu Feng that was present in his voice before was no longer there.

“That said, this old man will have to remind you of this. You must not look down on that spirit formation. After enduring such powerful lightning strikes, it’ll be impossible for you to be completely unscathed. If you don’t believe me, have a look at your chest.”

Hearing that, Chu Feng hurriedly looked at his chest.

It was only then that he discovered that there was a lightning-shaped scar on his chest. That scar was very small. It was only the length of an index finger. However, it seemed to be alive.

“Bang, bang~~~”

The scar throbbed twice. Following that, Chu Feng felt the stabbing pain again.

At the moment he felt the pain, Chu Feng felt as if he had been paralyzed. He was unable to move at all. He could only endure the stabbing pain that filled his entire body. He felt as if... his soul was about to split apart.

That stabbing pain was extremely dangerous.

However, the dangerous, stabbing pain disappeared the moment the scar stopped throbbing.

“Senior, what is this?” Chu Feng hurriedly asked. He had a very serious expression on his face.

Chu Feng was, after all, a Saint-cloak World Spiritist. Yet, he was unable to see through that lightning-shaped scar, unable to determine what it was.

He could only feel that it seemed to be a living parasitic organism attached to his chest.

Although it was only on his physical body, it was able to even erode his soul.

The reason why that scar throbbed twice earlier was because Chu Feng had tried to remove it using his spirit power, causing it to react.

In other words, he was unable to remove the scar.

“That is the Lightning Curse. That’s the price for withstanding the Li Heavenly Clan’s Ancestral Formation.”

“It will torture you at random times until you die,” that voice said.

“Until I die? Is there no way to remove it?” Chu Feng asked.

This Lightning Curse was very dangerous. Chu Feng did not wish to have such a dangerous thing in his body the entire time.

“It’s very difficult. Unless... you are to obtain it’s acknowledgement.”

“However, that would be even more difficult to do. It’s practically impossible,” that voice said.

“Obtain its acknowledgement? Senior, what must I do in order to obtain its acknowledgement?” Chu Feng asked.

“That would be very dangerous, fatally dangerous. Are you certain that you wish to attempt it?” that voice asked.

“Senior, please tell me what I must do,” Chu Feng said.

“Do not attempt to remove it from your body. Assimilate your martial power with it and try to accept it into you, allowing it to fuse with you.”

“However, I must warn you. This method is very dangerous.”

“Furthermore, it is very unreliable. After all, there has never been anyone who has managed to obtain the Lightning Curse’s acknowledgement.”

“Not even this old man knows where this method came from, and whether it might be a scam or not.”

“Thus, you should not make a rash attempt. It’s better that you let nature take its course.”

“Although the Lightning Curse will activate at random, it will at least not endanger your life.”

“Mn? This brat’s eye, what’s going on?”

That voice was originally still explaining things to Chu Feng. However, all of a sudden, the voice was filled with questions.

It turned out that Chu Feng’s body had changed at that moment. The most important change to his body were his eyes.

At that moment, his eyes were filled with lightning. The lightning within his eyes was the same sort of lightning that had attacked Chu Feng and Li Yue’er in the formation core.

“Thank you, senior,” Chu Feng suddenly said with his fist clasped.

“Thank? Why thank me?” The voice was somewhat confused at first. However, when he turned his eyes to Chu Feng’s chest and observed it, he came to a sudden realization. The Lightning Curse that was present on his chest had disappeared.

“Brat, you actually began to attempt it while this old man was still explaining it to you? Furthermore, you... you... this... could it be that you’ve... succeeded?”

That voice was filled with astonishment. After all, that method was only a rumor. He had seen many people attempt that method. Yet, they’d all exploded and died.

This was the first time he’d seen someone succeed in removing the Lightning Curse using that method.

He was unable to be certain if the Lightning Curse had disappeared, or if it had really fused with Chu Feng.

However, it was true that the Lightning Curse was no longer on his chest. Furthermore, Chu Feng had undergone an extraordinary change.

“Senior, so you’re here.”

After that mysterious individual let out a voice of astonishment, Chu Feng turned his gaze to the eastern region of the palace hall.

There was an enormous sculpture there that was a hundred meters tall. It was very magnificent.

That said, there was a smaller sculpture atop the magnificent sculpture.

That was a sculpture of a frog. The frog was sculpted out of stone, and was the size of a watermelon.

At a glance, that frog sculpture did not appear to be special at all.

However, earlier, Chu Feng was able to sense a special gaze that was cast onto his chest from that frog’s eyes. The gaze penetrated his clothes, and was able to see that the Lightning Curse on his chest had disappeared.

Thus, Chu Feng suspect that the extraordinary gaze was from the senior that was conversing with him.

“You actually managed to detect this old man because I was observing you. Brat, exactly who are you?”
