Chapter 4468: You Have Finally Come

Chu Feng might still have doubts initially, but there was no questioning that these wolf-head human-body creatures were heading straight toward them anymore.

And what that left Chu Feng feeling terribly unnerved was that the killing intent they emanated was directed toward him as well. They had no intention of sparing him either.

He was also a target of their aggression!

Shoosh!

Shoosh!

It was at this moment that the Black-White Twin Malevolence behind him took out a token each. This token was made of wood, but there were runes inscribed on it that bore a great resemblance to the runes he saw on the cavern wall earlier.

After the two old men took the tokens out, the creatures actually diverted their eyes away from them. With this, their aggression was only locked on a single person now—Chu Feng.

“This...”

Chu Feng felt deeply stifled.

He could tell that the reason why these creatures had diverted their gazes away from the two old men was due to the wooden tokens they whipped out. However, he didn’t have anything like that on him.

This really put him in an awkward situation.

It was just a moment ago that he threatened these two old men, saying that he was the descendant of the owner of this hidden place. Yet, all of a sudden, he was the only one who was attacked by the guards.

With this, his lie was exposed.

“To think that it’s actually useful! Looks like we spent our fortune well on it!”

The two old men looked at the token in their hands and heaved a sigh of relief before finally directing a mocking look toward Chu Feng.

“Brat, didn’t you say that your grandfather is the owner of this place? Wouldn’t that make those monsters over there your servants then? How weird this is... It doesn’t look like they don’t recognize you at all though?”

The two old men ridiculed Chu Feng.

They didn’t carry on to attack Chu Feng, choosing to step back and watch the commotion instead.

The current turn of events clearly told the Black-White Twin Malevolence that Chu Feng had been lying all this while, and that his grandfather wasn’t the owner of this place. Otherwise, these creatures wouldn’t have dared to bare their fangs at Chu Feng at all.

“Let me go right now, and I can spare your life. Otherwise, none of you will be leaving this place alive!” Chu Feng sneered at the two old men.

In truth, he would like more than anything to get up right now and leave this place. While those wolf-head human-body creatures were marching toward him right now, their speed still wasn’t too fast yet.

As long as Chu Feng left this place right away, he should be able to survive.

It was just unfortunate that his body was still held firmly in place by the oppressive might of those two old men.

Even though Chu Feng knew that his lie had already been exposed, he had no choice but to force it through. There was nothing else he could do other than this.

“Still putting on an act, huh? If you’re as formidable as you claim, why don’t you get your servants to kill the two of us?”

The two old men gazed down at Chu Feng mockingly as they slowly backed away to the entrance of the spirit formation gate.

Chu Feng’s lies weren’t going to make them waver anymore.

Seeing that it was futile to talk to these two old men, he turned to the Divine Deer inside his body and pleaded for help, “Elder, you’re the only one who can save me now. You can’t just watch idly as they tear me apart!”

This was his only hope left, or else he could only wait hopelessly for death.

“You’re really useless.”

And to Chu Feng’s delight, the Divine Deer actually responded to him.

Following that, Chu Feng’s body morphed into a streak of white light and darted straight into the depths of the passageway.

“Where did that brat go?”

The two old men were astonished to see Chu Feng disappearing right beneath their eyelids. This abrupt situation had left them flustered at the start as they thought that Chu Feng might really have some peculiar connection to this hidden place.

However, the creatures marching toward them suddenly reined in their killing intent in and obediently walked to the sides of the passageway. It was an act of opening up a path for them to pass through.

This further verified their thoughts that Chu Feng had nothing to do with this place, especially since it was only after Chu Feng disappeared that these creatures finally calmed down.

Meaning to say, Chu Feng had simply used some kind of means to escape from them earlier.

“It looks like that brat has some secrets on him. Big bro, we can’t let him go. We need to capture him and get whatever treasure that is on him!” the black-robed old man said.

“You’re right. Let’s bet that the brat hasn’t left this place yet.”

As the white-robed old man spoke, he took out a treasure and sealed up the spirit formation gate. Needless to say, his intent was to stop Chu Feng from escaping this place.

Following that, they began to venture deeper into the passageway. Their hearts thumped in fright when they walked between the two rows of wolf-head human-body creatures, but fortunately for them, the creatures remained completely still as if statues.

Only then did the two of them finally heaved a sigh of relief.

“This token sure is useful. That auctioneer really didn’t lie to us.”

The two of them remarked once more.

They had acquired their tokens from the same place where they had obtained their maps. The tokens were even more expensive than the maps, but they bought it anyway under the promise of the auctioneer that these tokens would protect them from danger in the hidden place.

They reserved some doubts regarding that claim back then, but they were deeply thankful for their decision back then.

It was almost as if they had a free pass in their hands that allowed them to stroll through the passageway of this hidden place without any worries.

However, Chu Feng had already arrived at the end of the passageway ahead of them, and he found himself standing before a grand hall.

Naturally, the only reason why he could get here so quickly was due to the powers of the Divine Deer. It was just that the Divine Deer had disappeared after she had brought him here. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Elder, why don’t you help me all the way instead? I would be more than thankful if you could bring me out of this place!” Chu Feng called out to the Divine Deer.

He looked at the grand hall around him, and despite its splendor, other than a single chair placed at the other end of the hall, there was nothing in here at all.

Chu Feng knew that even though the passageway was quite long, it was only a matter of time before those two old men got to him. If he were to turn back right now, he would surely encounter the two of them.

In other words, he was cornered.

Unless the Divine Deer were to bring him out of here, he was practically doomed.

However, no matter how he tried to call out to the Divine Deer, she didn’t respond to him at all. Once again, the Divine Deer had abandoned him.

“It looks like I can only depend on myself then!” Chu Feng sighed deeply as he took out his Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk.

He tried to activate it, but it showed no reaction at all.

If he couldn’t tap into the prowess of the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk, the formations he set up, no matter how intricate they might have been, would not be able to stop those two old men.

The situation was really unfavorable for him. His trump cards were not working at all.

Left with no choice, Chu Feng finally resorted to setting up a concealment formation around himself to hide.

It was a very risky move, but he had no other choice right now.

Holding the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk in his hand, he began setting up a formation in the direction of the passageway.

“You have finally come.”

But at this moment, a voice suddenly sounded behind Chu Feng.
