Chapter 5428: Purple Dragon God-cloak

Four hours passed in an instant.

It had only taken two hours for Chu Feng to reach this hall, but he had spent four hours here searching for the cultivation method but to no avail. It showed just how difficult this task was compared to the previous trials.

“Hm?”

Chu Feng noticed someone appearing in the hall beneath. It was none other than Ling Hang.

As soon as Ling Hang stepped in, the hall trembled ever so slightly before a mist drifted out and shrouded him, bestowing him with a unique energy. This energy enhanced Ling Hang’s strength while easing the difficulty of his future cultivation.

This was the talent test that Ling Hang had previously mentioned.

Ling Hang quickly sat down and began forming hand seals. Soon, the walls started glowing as more and more mist flowed into his body. He had begun his cultivation.

“I get it now. It’s not just the keys that are finite; the energy here is finite too. I reckon that there isn’t much energy here after being passed down through so many generations. The cultivation ground is already reaching its limit.” Chu Feng came to a judgment after seeing the light on the wall.

He noticed the lights on the walls dimming as more mist flowed out. The change was practically imperceptible, but he still noticed it nevertheless.

“Why don’t you cultivate down there then? At this rate, Ling Hang will use up all of the remaining energy in here,” Eggy said anxiously.

“I’ll be able to cultivate faster than Ling Hang, but I won’t benefit much even if I head down there. Besides, there’s a time limit to this hall. We’ll be sent out once the time is up. Staying here is my best bet if I wish to win big,” Chu Feng replied before he continued searching for the cultivation method.

He was getting more and more certain that the energy he could receive in this hall was far greater than the one beneath.

Another four hours passed in a flash.

Chu Feng had grasped bits of the cultivation method, but he didn’t start cultivating right away. He knew that he had to grasp the full cultivation method, or else it would just be a waste of time.

“Why isn’t she here yet? Is Li Ta’er that dumb?” Ling Hang was starting to lose his patience.

“How does he know that Li Ta’er will get in here?” Eggy asked.

“He and his ancestors have been here many times before. They must have a record of every single test here, even if they are randomly allocated to one every single time. My guess is that he has told Li Ta’er the way to clearing all of the tests here,” Chu Feng said.

“It looks like Ling Hang treats Li Ta’er not too bad. Li Ta’er didn’t bootlick him in vain,” Eggy remarked.

“True,” Chu Feng replied.

Another hour passed. An excited smile suddenly emerged on Chu Feng’s face.

“Eggy, I have finally grasped it!” Chu Feng sat down and formed a series of hand seals.

Hu!

A steady stream of energy appeared in the hall and flowed toward Chu Feng. It was the same energy that Ling Hang was absorbing in the hall beneath, but it was thousands of times more concentrated.

This tremendously concentrated energy would have been beyond the means of most world spiritists to absorb. They had to take frequent breaks, or else their body wouldn’t be able to withstand it.

However, Chu Feng continued absorbing the energy without any rest, almost as if he was a black hole that furiously devoured everything that came his way. Naturally, he also benefited greatly from that too. It didn’t take him long to make a breakthrough in his spirit power.

“Eggy, I made a breakthrough!” Chu Feng said excitedly.

“That was fast!” Eggy was surprised.

“It was indeed faster than I have anticipated. Eggy, look at the walls of the hall beneath.” Chu Feng pointed downward.

“The lights on the walls have dimmed a lot. They look like they are about to be extinguished,” Eggy remarked.

“Indeed. The energy I am absorbing is much more concentrated than Ling Hang’s. I have only just started absorbing the energy, but I have already greatly depleted it. I don’t think that there’s much energy left in here anymore, so I should just use up all of it.”

Chu Feng didn’t take a break even while he was talking, but as soon as he finished his sentence, he changed his hand seal, and the rate at which he absorbed the energy clearly increased.

Even though Chu Feng knew that the energy Ling Hang was absorbing was paltry compared to his own, he still thought that it was a waste to spare even the slightest bit for the latter.

Moments later, Ling Hang shot to his feet and exclaimed, “What happened?”

To his horror, he realized that the energy he had been absorbing had suddenly vanished without a trace. No more energy was coming out no matter how he changed his hand seals.

“How did this happen? Didn’t grandfather tell me that there is enough energy in here for me to cultivate another ten years? Why did the energy suddenly dry up?” Ling Hang muttered under his breath in a mixture of confusion and unease.

In the hall above, Chu Feng smiled at the sight of Ling Hang’s unease. He knew why the energy in this cultivation ground had suddenly vanished… How could he not know when he was the one who depleted it?

“Did you deplete everything?” Eggy asked.

“I did. Not a single wisp of energy left here. Still, I’m surprised that I was able to raise my spirit power to Purple Dragon God-cloak here,” Chu Feng said.

“Is your spirit power fighting prowess still the same as before?” Eggy asked. She was worried that Chu Feng’s heaven-defying battle power would be undermined as he grew stronger.

“My current spirit power fighting prowess is comparable to Gold Dragon God-cloak. In terms of deciphering formations, I am on par with Royal Dragon God-cloak World Spiritists,” Chu Feng replied.

“That’s great! Who could have thought that Ling Hang would do you such a huge favor?” Eggy was delighted to hear that Chu Feng’s heaven-defying battle power was the same as ever.

Weng!

There was a surge of teleportation energy as a person appeared in the hall below. It was Li Ta’er. The energy inside the hall had already been depleted, but she still received the energy that could raise her fighting prowess, which obviously paled in comparison to Ling Hang.

However, Li Ta’er didn’t look happy in the least despite having received a reward. Her complexion was horrible, and it looked like she had suffered a scare.

Chu Feng knew right away that his earlier trick had worked.

“Miss Ta’er, you’re here. I have waited a long time for you.” Ling Hang excitedly rushed forward, the frustrations he had shown earlier from the depletion of the energy vanishing without a trace. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

However, Li Ta’er subconsciously avoided him.

“Miss Ta’er, what’s wrong?” Ling Hang finally noticed that something was wrong with Li Ta’er’s complexion.

“I-I’m fine,” Li Ta’er shook her head.

“That’s good to hear.” Ling Hang smiled before pulling Li Ta’er into his embrace.

“What are you doing?” Li Ta’er pushed Ling Hang away.

“What’s wrong, Miss Ta’er? It’s only a matter of time before you’re mine. Is it asking too much to embrace you?”

“Young master Ling Hang, aren’t you misunderstanding something?”

“I thought that you like me?”

“I do respect young master Ling Hang… but I do not harbor feelings for you.”

Even Chu Feng and Eggy were shocked to hear those words, let alone Ling Hang. They thought that Li Ta’er was bootlicking Ling Hang to get on his good books, but her attitude suggested that there was more to it.

“Is that so? No worries, feelings can be cultivated over time. Miss Ta’er, I have fallen in love with you at first sight, and I wish to take you as my bride. I’ll talk to your father about this as soon as we leave this place,” Ling Hang said.

“Young master Ling Hang, you’re really misunderstanding me. I don’t have that kind of feelings for you,” Li Ta’er said.

“Heh…” Ling Hang suddenly burst into laughter, but the look in his eyes changed.

Boom!

He released a surge of spirit power that pinned Li Ta’er to the corner of the hall.

“Young master Ling Hang, what are you doing?” Li Ta’er was horrified.

“Miss Ta’er, I know that you have a special constitution. You’ll be of help to me. Don’t worry, I’ll repay you for this. I’m still more than willing to take you in as my concubine,” Ling Hang slowly made his way toward Li Ta’er with a vile smile.

“You… You…” Li Ta’er panicked. She screamed, “Save me! Save me!!!”

Her desperate cries for help only amused Ling Hang.

“Save you? Who are you asking for help from? Those two fools? Miss Ta’er, do you think that I brought my family heirloom to help those two fools? They can’t even get in here without my guidance! From the very start, my goal was to create some alone time for us!” Ling Hang looked at Li Ta’er with perverse eyes.

“Y-you were planning to take advantage of me from the start?” Li Ta’er was taken aback.

“Indeed. I thought that you had feelings for me. I was convinced that you would be touched by my help and offer yourself to me. It was a miscalculation on my part. However, it doesn’t matter. I’m able to achieve my goal nevertheless.”

Ling Hang’s hand began moving toward Li Ta’er.

Boom!

A powerful force suddenly jolted Ling Hang back. A person appeared in front of Li Ta’er.

“It’s you?”

Both Ling Hang and Li Ta’er were taken aback.
