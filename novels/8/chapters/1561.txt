MGA: Chapter 1562 - Frightening Hurricane

“Chu Feng, Miss Tantai, follow me closely.”

Right at this moment, Hong Qiang’s expression suddenly became serious. He extended his hand and grabbed Chu Feng and Tantai Xue’s arms, bringing them to his side.

“All of you, follow closely. Whether or not I’ll be able to bring you all in will be dependent on this,” At the same time, that Nangong Imperial Clan’s Martial Emperor also spoke out.

At this moment, Chu Feng discovered that the little girl had jumped into the bosom of that Martial Emperor. Even that woman who had declared him to be a bad example had an expression of unease in her eyes.

Furthermore, that Martial Emperor had used her power to create an enormous defensive barrier that surrounded everyone from the Nangong Imperial Clan.

Chu Feng had also managed to sense that a frightening danger was approaching them. As he looked toward the direction of that approaching danger, even though he was already prepared, he was still unable to help his heart from beating rapidly in the face of danger.

Unable to contain himself, he blurted out, “Damn, isn’t this a bit too excessive?”

The incoming hurricane was no ordinary hurricane at all. Instead, it was filled with black sickles that seemed to be able to slice through everything. Countless rays of such sickles were interweaved into one location to create the omnipresent wall of wind that came toward them from the storm in the manner of a hurricane.

Chu Feng was able to clearly see with his eyes that the people ahead would all utter sounds of screaming upon entering the hurricane. There were as many screams as the amount of people who entered that place.

“It seems that the exciting part is coming,” Chu Feng gasped. At this moment, the hurricane came before them. The frightening attractive power from the hurricane was sucking them into it. Even if they wished to run away now, they would not be able to escape.

“Rumble~~~~~”

Finally, carrying with it were waves of rumbles, that frightening wind wall swept past Chu Feng and the others, sucking them all into it.

Right after entering into it, Chu Feng immediately sensed an indescribable attractive power. That sort of sensation was like he was being grabbed by a large invisible hand that wanted to pull him away from Hong Qiang.

“Damn it, what sort of power is this? I’m actually unable to resist it.”

Before this attractive power, Hong Qiang’s hands that were tightly grabbing onto Chu Feng and Tantai Xue were helplessly released. It was not that he wanted to release his hands. Rather, there was an invisible power that forcibly pulled his hands open. That power was so strong that he was simply unable to resist it at all.

In the end, Hong Qiang could only watch helplessly as Chu Feng and Tantai Xue were carried away by the hurricane.

“Everyone, remain calm. This hurricane will only separate us and not harm us.”

“Protect Miss Moli. Protect Miss Moli.”

“Damn it, I can’t grab onto her.”

At the moment when Chu Feng was being carried away by the hurricane, he heard shouts from the people of the Nangong Imperial Clan.

Upon closer inspection, Chu Feng discovered that, like them, the people from the Nangong Imperial Clan were also all being scattered everywhere and carried away by the hurricane. They were like countless kites with their strings cut as they rolled about in the hurricane, drifting blindly and helplessly.

It turned out that it was not only Hong Qiang who was unable to protect him and Tantai Xue in the hurricane, even that grand Martial Emperor was unable to protect the people from the Nangong Imperial Clan. From this... it could be seen how frightening that hurricane was.

“It would seem that this hurricane has only separated us, and is not actually planning to harm us.”

Chu Feng had already discovered how frightening this hurricane was. However, he was not overly worried. That was because, if this hurricane wished to harm them, then, with its power, they would all have been killed by now. Even that Nangong Imperial Clan’s Martial Emperor would be no exception.

However, they were all fine. This meant that the hurricane did not plan to hurt them at all. Perhaps, it was as the people from the Nangong Imperial Clan said, this hurricane merely planned to separate them.

After Chu Feng became aware of this, he no longer tried to struggle and instead allowed himself to be carried away by the hurricane. The only thing that he was curious about was where this hurricane was planning to take him.

Gradually, the screams from the crowd grew softer and softer. Then, they disappeared. They had disappeared for a long while. Other than the sound of the wind, Chu Feng was unable to hear any other sound. Chu Feng knew that he was growing further and further away from the rest of the people. They must have been separated by miles.

Finally, the ear-splitting rumbles began to gradually grow softer and softer. At the same time, the attractive power also gradually became weaker.

Everything had ended. Chu Feng had broken free from that storm and reached the surface of the sea.

As he saw the storm that was growing further and further away, as he saw that there was nothing in his surroundings other than sea waves, Chu Feng heaved a long sigh of relief.

“It would seem that reaching the Immortal Island is no easy task.”

“I wonder, are Ling’er and Lil Rou here? Did they manage to successfully reach the Immortal Island? They wouldn’t have encountered dangers, right?”

Chu Feng knew that he was still on the sea, and must not have managed to travel far. However, he began to grow worried about Zi Ling and Su Rou. Even though he knew that the two of them now possessed powerful cultivations, he had discovered that everything here had surpassed his expectations.

He knew that the storm was the first trial. Following that storm, there would likely be more trials awaiting them. Even Chu Feng was uncertain as to whether he would be able to pass the upcoming trials.

In short, Chu Feng was able to become certain of one thing. The ninety thousand miles of water would not be as easy to travel as they might appear to be.

That was because Chu Feng discovered that the pressure on the surface of the sea was even greater. It was many times greater here than the pressure near the shore. Under this sort of pressure, even if there were nothing blocking him, it would still take him at least two days and two nights in order to reach the Immortal Island.

Most importantly, Chu Feng’s spirit power had also received an enormous restriction in this place. Even when using his Heaven’s Eyes, he was unable to see very far.

On this sea, all of his abilities had been restricted. However, this was still not the most frightening aspect. The most frightening aspect was that there were many powerful existences that could cause even Martial Emperors to feel powerless on this sea.

Dangers, they were absolutely everywhere. On this sea, if one did not possess sufficient courage, one would definitely feel extremely frightened.

“Gurgle, gurgle~~~” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Right at this moment, a series of strange gurgling noises sounded from below Chu Feng. It was the sound of water surging. Even though that sound was very soft and had been covered by the overflowing waves on the surface of the water, Chu Feng, being alert, had managed to detect it.

“Woosh~~~”

Suddenly, Chu Feng’s footsteps moved. He used his Mortal Taboo: Illusion Light Technique. He instantly turned into a ray of light and traveled backwards several meters.

“Splash~~~”

Right at this moment, a sudden wave surged forth toward where Chu Feng had previously stood. At the same time, an enormous sea monster appeared before Chu Feng.

It was a giant black crab. However, it was different from ordinary crabs. It was enormous. Its height was over a dozen meters tall, and it possessed four strong pincers. Furthermore, it possessed the cultivation of a rank one Half Martial Emperor.

Fortunately, although its cultivation was strong, its battle power was only ordinary. It did not possess any heaven-defying battle power. Thus, to Chu Feng, it was no issue at all.

“Sure enough, this sea is not without dangers. That’s fine too, what should come will eventually come.”

As Chu Feng spoke, he took out his Incomplete Imperial Armament, the Infinity Edge. Being on a sea like this, Chu Feng did not dare to hold back his strength. He must be extremely cautious and go all out.

Only by doing that would he be able to keep himself safe. Only by doing that would he be able to travel far by himself.
