Chapter 5758: The Only One On the Board

Little Fishy, Xian Miaomiao, Feng Ling, and Long Muxi—outstanding women who were strong and beautiful—followed Chu Feng to his residence. Even people like Xianhai Shaoyu and Long Chengyu looked like sidekicks beside Chu Feng.

In the past, the crowd was both confused and envious by this occurrence, but they finally understood how ignorant and foolish they were.

Chu Feng was the true boss here, with the backing of a True God level world spirit. He didn’t need Xianhai Shaoyu or Xianhai Yu’er’s protection. No one in the Nine Heavens’ Zenith could do anything about him in the first place. It was no wonder he dared to march in here.

He was the true dark horse of the Nine Heavens’ Zenith.

All of a sudden, Qin Shu felt a cold glare on him. It was from his big brother, Qin Xuan.

Qin Shu felt flustered. His big brother had only looked at him with such eyes once before, and he ended up terribly beaten up afterward.

“Big brother, I-I-I didn’t know he has a True God level world spirit!” Qin Shu hurriedly explained.

“Make sure to get to the bottom of things next time, or else we’ll be the ones to suffer,” Qin Xuan replied via voice transmission.

He was planning to deal with Chu Feng if an opportunity surfaced, so as to get even on his little brother’s behalf, but he was relieved that such an opportunity never came. Otherwise, he would have been thoroughly destroyed by Chu Feng.

…

In a tattered cavern in the Nine Heavens’ Zenith, Jie Tian lay on the ground, enveloped by a recovery formation. He had mostly recovered from his injuries, but he was still in deep sleep.

Liu Kuo stood beside him with closed eyes. A faint glow could be seen from his eyes—it was spirit power. The prayer beads he held in his hand were glowing with the same light.

“Brother Chu Feng sure is formidable. He even has a True God level world spirit. He feels more like a monster than a human,” Liu Kuo exclaimed with a smile.

He clearly saw what happened earlier through the formations in the Nine Heavens’ Zenith.

“Wu…”

Liu Kuo opened his eyes and looked at Jie Tian. He shifted his finger to another prayer bead before pointing his finger at Jie Tian, and the recovery formation shrouding the latter dissipated. Jie Tian slowly opened his eyes.Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Where am I?” Jie Tian asked while rubbing his head.

“Do you remember your loss to Xianhai Yu’er?” Liu Kuo asked.

Jie Tian’s expression turned incomparably heavy as he recalled his fight with Xianhai Yu’er. Despite having made huge progress, he still lost.

“It’s good that you remember. In accordance with the bet, you have been eliminated and ought to leave the Nine Heavens’ Zenith.” Liu Kuo’s words placed great pressure on Jie Tian. “But the Nine Heavens’ Zenith is currently in lockdown, so you’ll have to stay here a little longer till the tournament comes to an end.”

Jie Tian heaved a sigh of relief.

“Even if I can’t leave, shouldn’t you find somewhere better for me to rest? What’s this place?” Jie Tian surveyed his surroundings and thought that it was beneath him to stay here.

“Benefactor Jie Tian, you have been eliminated. You aren’t in a position to nitpick. I am already being nice to you by discreetly bringing you here. Would you rather roam aimlessly in the square like Qin Shu and Qin Xuan?” Liu Kuo asked.

Jie Tian rolled his eyes. “This place is fine.”

“Speaking of which, Jie Tian, while you’re currently stuck here, I’d still have to announce your elimination to the rest of the world,” Liu Kuo said.

“What do you mean?” Jie Tian immediately shot to his feet.

“You should have seen a ranking board for the trials on your way here. Unlike previous iterations of the Nine Heavens’ Zenith, we have another board to name those who have been eliminated,” Liu Kuo said.

“You’re saying that everyone can see that I have been eliminated?” Jie Tian asked.

“Indeed. You’ll be the first one on the board, as well as the only one at the moment,” Liu Kuo said.

Jie Tian hurriedly took out a Cosmos Sack and passed it to Liu Kuo.

“What do you mean by this? Are you bribing me?” Liu Kuo asked.

“It isn’t a bribe. I just want to negotiate with you. Can you refrain from writing my name on the elimination board? Otherwise, you can just delay it a little longer…”

“Feeling ashamed? Benefactor Jie Tian, you really should have thought about that beforehand.

“Have you considered how ashamed Chu Feng would have felt if you beat him up till he can’t stand up anymore? Similarly, don’t you think Xianhai Yu’er would have felt ashamed if she lost to you and ended up having her name appear first on the elimination board? I don’t think you care about that. If anything, you would have celebrated that. You were planning to use them as footholds to build your reputation.

“There’s nothing wrong with that. The only problem is that you lost. Since you lost, you have to pay the price,” Liu Kuo looked at Jie Tian with a wry smile.

“Don’t force my hand.” Jie Tian’s face suddenly turned cold.

“Are you threatening me right now? Give it a try then,” Liu Kuo said.

Jie Tian formed several hand seals, and spirit power chains surged from his body to coil around Liu Kuo and bind him in place. However, none of these chains truly reached Liu Kuo, as he was protected by a barrier.

“Hmph!”

With a harrumph, Liu Kuo shattered all of the spirit power chains and sent Jie Tian crashing against the cavern wall.

“Jie Tian, I concede that I might not be a match for you in a normal fight, but we’re currently in the Nine Heavens’ Zenith, my home turf. Do you think you stand a chance against me here?” Liu Kuo looked at Jie Tian in disdain with the prayer beads in hand.

He changed his hand seal, and one of the prayer beads released a surge of spirit power that transformed into a ranking board. At the same time, a board appeared in the sky above Pulse Ignition Village too.

These two boards were identical, just that the one above the Pulse Ignition Village was much bigger. It was the same size as the trial’s ranking board, and it was located right next to it too. The board could be clearly seen even from a far distance away.

“Another board has appeared! Has the Nine Heavens’ Zenith finally commenced?”

The appearance of the board piqued everyone’s attention, be it those floating in the sky or those standing on the ground, near or far. All of them turned their attention toward the newly-appeared board.

In an invisible floating palace in the sky, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master was currently holding a meeting with the elders. He had traveled all the way here to support Jie Tian, but someone of his stature had far too many matters to attend to that he couldn’t afford to idle.

The moment the board appeared, he stopped what he was doing and turned his attention over.

Soon, the words ‘Elimination Board’ appeared on it.

“Ah, it’s an elimination board! It looks like someone is going to be eliminated. I wonder who will be the first one to be eliminated.”

“Do you even need to ask? It’s bound to be some unknown junior. There’s no way the top-notch prodigies would be eliminated that quickly.”

The crowd wasn’t too excited by the appearance of the elimination board.

Soon, Jie Tian’s name appeared on the elimination board.

“Jie Tian? That name sounds awfully familiar… Ah! Isn’t the grandson of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master called Jie Tian too? Could he be the one eliminated?”

That realization piqued the crowd’s interest.

“What are you thinking? How can someone as talented as Jie Tian be eliminated first? Not only is he the grandson of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master, but he’s rumored to possess the Ruler’s Bloodline, which means he’s a prodigy on par with Jie Ranqing!”

Many people immediately shot down that conjecture. It was beyond their imagination that the eliminated Jie Tian could be the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Jie Tian.

The atmosphere inside the invisible floating palace turned heavy.

“Lord Mansion Master, it can’t be young master Jie Tian. It has to be someone with the same name,” an elder stepped forward and said.

“What nonsense are you spouting? Of course, it can’t be Tian’er. Do you think there’s a chance Tian’er would be the first one to be eliminated?” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master replied in displeasure.

He had absolute confidence in Jie Tian.

“I deserve to die for my foolish words!” the elder immediately kneeled down and apologized.

Just then, four words appeared in front of Jie Tian’s name on the elimination board: Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.

Seven Realms Sacred Mansion—Jie Tian.
