Chapter 2003 - Chu Feng’s Massacre Show

“Hun Jingtian, you actually also came to involve yourself in this matter? Are you planning to use this opportunity to kiss the Ancient Era’s Elves’ ass?”

“Or, could it be that you’re planning to use this opportunity to win favor from that boy Chu Feng?” The Heavenly Law Palace’s Palace Master asked coldly.

Clearly, the Heavenly Law Palace’s Palace Master felt extremely displeased. Originally, he had grasped victory in his palm. However, with the addition of the Underworld Palace’s Palace Master, their battle would enter a stalemate once again.

“I merely think that this is the best opportunity to get rid of your Heavenly Law Palace,” Hun Jingtian had a smile on him the entire time. However, the Imperial Armament that he held in his hand grew more and more ferocious. He simply wanted to take the Heavenly Law Palace’s Palace Master’s life.

“Today, it’s not our Heavenly Law Palace, but rather your Underworld Palace that will be eradicated!” The Heavenly Law Palace’s Palace Master shouted. His each and every attack was also extremely ferocious.

There had been grievances between the Heavenly Law Palace and the Underworld Palace for many years now. Today, they would finally fight a battle to the death. It must be said, after the Underworld Palace’s Palace Master joined the battle, the battle became even more intense.

“Woosh~~~”

“Woosh~~~”

“Woosh~~~”

“Woosh~~~”

“Woosh~~~”

“Woosh~~~”

At the moment when the four rank eight Martial Emperors were fighting one another, many blasts of wind began to echo continuously. Countless black flames were surging forth from the distant horizon like a black meteor shower.

In the end, those black flames landed on the battlefield.

Upon entering the battlefield, those black flames turned into black-clothed individuals. Ruthlessly, those people began to attack and kill the people from the Heavenly Law Palace and the Mortal King Palace.

They were the Underworld Palace’s army. It turned out that the Underworld Palace’s Palace Master Hun Jingtian was not the only person that had come. Hun Jingtian had also arrived with the Underworld Palace’s army.

“Little friend Chu Feng, per the order from our Palace Master, we have come to provide you with assistance.”

Right at that moment, an old man appeared beside Chu Feng. This person was the Underworld Palace’s management elder that had helped Chu Feng many times in the Moonlight Maze, Elder Huang Guan.

“Seniors, you all have come at the perfect time,” At that moment, Chu Feng was overjoyed by the appearance of the Underworld Palace’s army. This was something that he and the great majority of the people present had not expected.

The reason for that was because Chu Feng did not possess a familiarity with the Underworld Palace.

However, regardless, the arrival of the Underworld Palace’s army was akin to sending charcoal in snowy weather.

With the addition of the Underworld Palace’s army, the Cyanwood Mountain that had been in an absolutely disadvantaged state against the Mortal King Palace and the Heavenly Law Palace’s armies was able to once again seize dominance in the battle.

“Rooarrr~~~”

Not long after the Underworld Palace joined the battle, dragon-like roars suddenly sounded from afar. Then, enormous black monstrous dragons came galloping towards the Cyanwood Mountain, killing their way onto the battlefield.

Their enormous bodies created a complete mess out of the places where they passed!!!

“Little friend Chu Feng, we are sorry to have come late.”

It was the King Monstrous Dragon Race. The King Monstrous Dragon Race’s Clan Chief had led the King Monstrous Dragon Race army to assist Chu Feng.

Chu Feng was overjoyed to see the King Monstrous Dragon Race. After all, he possessed a deep relationship with the King Monstrous Dragon Race and was allied with them.

The King Monstrous Dragon Race had dispatched all of their elites here to assist Chu Feng. Chu Feng could tell that the King Monstrous Dragon Race were sincerely trying to help him.

“Kill! Even if our Four Great Imperial Clans merely possess the splendor of fireflies, we must still assist little friend Chu Feng today and fight alongside the Cyanwood Mountain.”

To Chu Feng’s surprise, after the arrival of the King Monstrous Dragon Race, the Four Great Imperial Clans’ Utmost Exalted Elders personally led a group of elites from the Four Great Imperial Clans and killed their way onto the battlefield.

Although it was only a group of elites, and only a single Utmost Exalted Elder had been dispatched from each of the clans, it remained that both Chu Feng and the bystanders were shocked by their arrival to help Chu Feng. After all, they had been insistent on killing Chu Feng before.

Some of the crowd even began to rub their eyes nonstop, not daring to believe what they were seeing.

Even though the crowd were all very shocked by the Heavenly Law Palace and the Mortal King Palace joining hands, they were even more shocked by this many powers coming to assist Chu Feng.

They truly managed to experience what it meant by ‘a hundred answers to a single call.’ Furthermore, Chu Feng had not even called for those people. Instead, those powers had come to help Chu Feng of their own accord.

Although Chu Feng was very shocked by this, he soon smiled a relieved smile.

No matter what, the Four Great Imperial Clans’ Utmost Exalted Elders had personally experienced Chu Feng’s strength in the Moonlight Maze. They also knew that Chu Feng possessed a deep relationship with the Ancient Era’s Elves.

Likely, they had carefully considered their actions, and ultimately decided to stand with Chu Feng. They wished to seize this opportunity to board the Ancient Era’s Elves’ great vessel in order to obtain steadiness for their future.

However, regardless, it remained that they had acted upon their beliefs, and had dispatched elites to help Chu Feng. Thus, Chu Feng felt equally grateful toward the Four Great Imperial Clans.

It could be said that the grudges between Chu Feng and the Four Great Imperial Clans were completely settled as of that moment. From today hence, they would be true allies.

What did it mean to be allies? They were people or powers that would come to assist one another at their most critical moments.

“Mere King Monstrous Dragon Beasts and Four Great Imperial Clans actually dared to come contend against our Heavenly Law Palace and Mortal King Palace? After this battle is over, the next to be exterminated will be you all!”

The people from the Heavenly Law Palace and the Mortal King Palace were already furious because of the participation of the Underworld Palace. When the Four Great Imperial Clans and the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts also arrived to help Chu Feng, they became filled with anger.

Even though the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts and the Four Great Imperial Clans possessed strength greatly inferior to their own, it remained that they were great powers.

This was especially true now that they were fighting the Cyanwood Mountain and the Underworld Palace. They were already caught in a disadvantaged state. And now, the appearance of the Four Great Imperial Clans and the King Monstrous Dragon Race would only cause their battles to become even more difficult. As such, how could they not become enraged?

After all, both the Four Great Imperial Clans and the King Monstrous Dragon Race were afraid of them before, and would not dare to cause trouble for them.

The fact that they dared to do so now was only because they were borrowing the imposing power of the Cyanwood Mountain and the Ancient Era’s Elves. Because of that, the people from the Heavenly Law Palace and the Mortal King Palace were all filled with endless rage.

“Puu...”

“Ahh~~~”

Right after the threatening words aimed at the Four Great Imperial Clans and the King Monstrous Dragon Race were spoken by that Heavenly Law Palace’s elder, a silvery light suddenly flashed through the air. Then, that man started to scream in pain. His blood swirled in the air as his physical body was destroyed by Chu Feng.

As for that man, he was already the thousandth person to die after threatening the Four Great Imperial Clans and the King Monstrous Dragon Race.

It was Chu Feng. Chu Feng was the one that had ended up killing them.

“You dare to boast shamelessly when you’re powerless to defend yourself?” After killing a thousand individuals in the blink of an eye, Chu Feng turned his chilly gaze to his surroundings.

Upon hearing what Chu Feng said and seeing his gaze, the troops from the Heavenly Law Palace and the Mortal King Palace started to shiver. At that moment, no one dared to speak any more threats.

The reason for that was because those with cultivations above rank six Martial Emperor were all contained by the Weaponry Refinement Immortal, the Immeasurable Immortal and the Underworld Palace’s experts.

As for those below the cultivation of rank six Martial Emperor, there was simply no one capable of being Chu Feng’s opponent. Thus, to the current Chu Feng, he felt as if he was like a fish released back into the water in the battlefield.

The existence of Chu Feng was simply a nightmare to the people from the Heavenly Law Palace and the Mortal King Palace.

“Humph,” Even though the Heavenly Law Palace and the Mortal King Palace had both grown afraid of him, Chu Feng did not stop his attacks.

With a cold smile, Chu Feng unleashed his attacks again. With each attack, a crimson light would flash through the air.

In order to bring about absolute superiority in this battle, Chu Feng did not fight with rank six Martial Emperors. Instead, he was killing those below rank six Martial Emperor without any restraint. With Chu Feng’s strength, those below rank six Martial Emperor simply did not even possess the power to fight back against him. Thus, this was most definitely a massacre.
