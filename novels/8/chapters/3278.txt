Chapter 3278 - Mysterious Excellency

“Senior, in that case, that Bloodline Altar is a cultivation ground?” Chu Feng asked.

“One can say that the Bloodline Altar is a cultivation ground.”

“However, the Bloodline Altar is no ordinary cultivation ground. It’s only effective for people that possess Heavenly Bloodlines.”

“Furthermore, if one wants to enter the Bloodline Altar, one must first meet the requirements of being under a hundred years of age with the cultivation of a Martial Immortal.”

“Due to that special requirement, our Chu Heavenly Clan’s Bloodline Altar has not been used for several hundred years now.”

He sighed. “Back in your father’s era, even ignoring your father, there was Zhengfa and the others.”

“Yet now, apart from you, there’s no one else in our Chu Heavenly Clan that could be considered a true genius,” after saying those words, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief sighed again.

Had it not been Chu Feng becoming a Martial Immortal within a hundred years of age, likely no one would have been able to open their Chu Heavenly Clan’s Bloodline Altar again.

The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief had had a premonition that the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations would be worse with each generation. Likely, Chu Xuanzhengfa’s era would be the final glorious days of their Chu Heavenly Clan.

Should this continue, the desolation of the Chu Heavenly Clan would be unavoidable.

However, Chu Feng’s appearance had changed this situation. In fact, he had even helped their Chu Heavenly Clan ascend to new heights.

In the end, their Chu Heavenly Clan would have to rely on this descendant of Chu Hanxian and Chu Xuanyuan.

Had Chu Feng not come, the future would truly be unimaginable.

That was the reason why the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief sighed like that.

“Senior, in that case, exactly what sort of power does the Bloodline Altar possess?” Chu Feng asked.

After Chu Feng asked, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief began to inform Chu Feng about the Bloodline Altar.

Firstly, one would be able to comprehend power pertaining to the one’s Heavenly Bloodline.

The power one comprehended could allow one to increase one’s cultivation.

However, the Bloodline Altar’s use was even greater than that. Should it be opened, not only would Chu Feng be able to benefit from it, but the entire Chu Heavenly Clan would be able to benefit from it.

After the Bloodline Altar opened, all the people of the younger generation would be able to enter it. Merely, they would not be able to enter the depths of the Bloodline Altar to comprehend the power coming from deep within it.

That said, the Bloodline Altar contained many powerful Immortal Techniques, and several Immortal Taboo Martial Skills.

Although one could not take those Immortal Techniques and Immortal Taboo Martial Skills from the Bloodline Altar, one could attempt to comprehend them and learn them inside the Bloodline Altar.

Furthermore, although those that were more than a hundred years old would not be able to enter the Bloodline Altar, they too would be able to benefit from it.

As for their benefit, it would be directly related to Chu Feng.

The Bloodline Altar was linked to eight Bloodline Cultivation Formations.

These Bloodline Cultivation Formations were all currently closed. However, after Chu Feng entered the depths of the Bloodline Altar, he would have the opportunity to activate the Bloodline Cultivation Formations.

The more powerful the enlightenment Chu Feng obtained from the depths of the Bloodline Altar, the more Bloodline Cultivation Formations would be activated.

The more Bloodline Cultivation Formations were activated, the more powerful the Bloodline Cultivation Formations would be. With the increased strength, one would also be able to gain a better effect from cultivating inside them.

The amount of Bloodline Cultivation Formations that could be activated was also a sort of evaluation of one’s talent.

“Speaking of the Bloodline Cultivation Formations, this old man was only able to activate a single one,” the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief shook his head with a wry smile on his face.

“Then what about senior Zhengfa?” Chu Feng knew that Chu Xuanzhengfa was also an exceptional genius of his era. Thus, he must’ve entered the Bloodline Altar and activated the Bloodline Cultivation Formation.

“He also only activated one,” the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“Then what about my grandfather?” Chu Feng asked.

“Seven formations,” the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief answered.

“Seven formations?!” Hearing those words, Chu Feng’s expression changed enormously.

Both the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief and Chu Xuanzhengfa were only able to activate a single Bloodline Cultivation Formation. From this, one would be able to tell how difficult it was to gain enlightenment in the Bloodline Altar.

However, Chu Feng’s grandfather actually managed to activate seven Bloodline Cultivation Formations. This disparity was simply too huge.

“Your astonishment is understandable. After all, even our clan’s Old Ancestor, Chu Yetianhong, only managed to activate five Bloodline Cultivation Formations,” the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

Hearing the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief saying it like that, Chu Feng’s heart grew tense.

Chu Yetianhong was publicly accepted by the entire Chu Heavenly Clan as their Old Ancestor. He was also the most revered by the entire Chu Heavenly Clan, someone that no one could replace.

After all, it was Chu Yetianhong who had brought their Chu Heavenly Clan through various campaigns to ascend from the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm all the way to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm to become its ruler.

It was Chu Yetianhong who had established the glory of the Chu Heavenly Clan single-handedly.

After Chu Feng arrived at the Chu Heavenly Clan, he had heard many people mentioning Chu Yetianhong.

He learned from them that Chu Yetianhong was very powerful. Should he have been able to live for a bit longer, the territory under the Chu Heavenly Clan’s rule would definitely not be limited to a single Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.

However, due to overworking himself, Chu Yetianhong suffered from a serious illness, and did not live for long.

If he hadn’t died, Chu Yetianhong’s cultivation would’ve continued to increase. After all, his talent was very frightening.

However, an Old Ancestor-level existence like him was only able to activate five Bloodline Cultivation Formations. With this, it immediately revealed how powerful Chu Feng’s grandfather was.

“Strange. Senior, could it be that this Bloodline Altar is not something constructed by our clan’s Old Ancestor?”

Suddenly, Chu Feng realized an extremely important problem.

He had originally thought that everything in the Chu Heavenly Clan was left behind by their Old Ancestor. Among them, the Bloodline Altar.

However, looking at things now, that seemed to not be the case. If their Old Ancestor had the ability to create the Bloodline Altar, how could he only be able to activate five Bloodline Cultivation Formations?

How could the enlightenment the Old Ancestor obtained from the Bloodline Altar be far inferior to that of his grandfather?

“Indeed, the Bloodline Altar was not constructed by our clan’s Old Ancestor. Instead, it is something constructed by a mysterious excellency.”

“That mysterious excellency was not someone of our Ancestral Martial Starfield. He was someone who traveled through the vast cultivation world, and just so happened to arrive in our Ancestral Martial Starfield and encountered our Old Ancestor by chance.”

“That mysterious excellency was a great and noble individual that our Old Ancestor encountered. He is also a benefactor to our Chu Heavenly Clan.”

“After all, he’s the one who left behind this Bloodline Altar to assist our Old Ancestor, to assist our Chu Heavenly Clan,” the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“It would appear that no one knows who that mysterious excellency is?” Chu Feng asked.

“No one knows who he is. All we know is that his left hand is different from that of the ordinary. His left hand is a hundred times larger than ordinary left hands. Furthermore, on his back are nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine sharp swords.”

“Each and every one of those sharp swords are extremely powerful, and capable of piercing through worlds and destroying everything.”

“That mysterious excellency’s strength is also unimaginably terrifying. With a wave of his hand, he would be able to obliterate everyone in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.”

“He is someone so great that he could bring desolation upon the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield all by himself,” the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

Hearing those words, Chu Feng’s blood began to boil. Not only was he astonished by that mysterious excellency’s might, but he also began to yearn for that sort of overwhelming power.

“Actually, when I was young, I had also wanted to know who that mysterious excellency was. After all, he was a benefactor to our entire Chu heavenly Clan. As such, I wanted to repay our debt to him, even if I was only able to thank him after seeing him.” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“However, once I properly thought about it, even if I were to find out who that mysterious excellency is, it would still be useless. After all, so many years have passed. Likely, that mysterious excellency has already died too. After all, no matter how strong we cultivators might be, we will still be limited by our lifespans,” the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief shook his head.

“In that case, senior, what about my father? How many Bloodline Cultivation Formations was he able to activate?” Chu Feng asked.
