Chapter 4140 - Rank Four Exalted Taboo

Using an Immortal Taboo Martial Skill, Chu Feng took on an Exalted Taboo Martial Skill.

Then, using a rank one Exalted Taboo Martial Skill, he took on a rank two Exalted Taboo Martial Skill.

And after that, using the same rank one Exalted Taboo Martial Skill, he actually took on a rank three Exalted Taboo Martial Skill.

This scene completely astonished the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen, so much so that they were all standing there stunned.

The difference of a single rank in an Exalted Taboo Martial Skill was a disparity in power that was extremely difficult to make up.

Thus, how could it be possible for someone to use a rank one Exalted Taboo to take on a rank three Exalted Taboo?

This was simply an impossible matter.

Yet, this impossible thing happened before their eyes.

At the time when the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen were all baffled, the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief spoke. “It would appear that Chu Feng’s Exalted Taboo greatly resembles our clan’s Exalted Taboo: Black Lightning Attachment.”

“It’s just that his Exalted Taboo is even more profound than ours, and he concealed its strength even better.”

Hearing their Lord Clan Chief’s words, the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen came to a sudden reaction.

They realized what was going on.

Even though Chu Feng’s Exalted Taboo: Heavenly Fate Seal emitted a white light and appeared to be a rank one Exalted Taboo, it was actually not a rank one Exalted Taboo.

Instead, it was very possibly a rank two or even rank three Exalted Taboo.

It’s just that Chu Feng’s Exalted Taboo: Heavenly Fate Seal was special. Not only had it changed its color, but it had also changed its might. Through that, it was able to confuse others.

“Truly despicable.”

Soon, all the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen took what they thought to be the case to be the truth.

Then, they actually began to insult Chu Feng.

They felt that Chu Feng was using a despicable trick to deceive them.

“Lord Clan Chief, there might still be some time before that Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation’s power dissipates.”

“Perhaps we should not have young master Daoyi continue to fight that Chu Feng, and instead think of a way to rescue young master Tiancheng?”

Zuoqiu Hanxun walked over to the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief and spoke quietly.

He was actually afraid. He feared that Zuoqiu Daoyi would not be a match for Chu Feng. He feared that their clan’s two top geniuses would both be trapped in that Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation.

It would be one thing if that Chu Feng decided to only torture their two young masters.

However, if he were to be crazed enough to directly kill them, it would be an enormous loss to their Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan.

It would not be excessive to say that it would be akin to having erased their Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan’s future.

“Don’t worry. Daoyi still hasn’t used his full strength yet.”

Compared to Zuoqiu Hanxun, the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was extremely confident.

He felt that Zuoqiu Daoyi still held victory in his hand.

“Oh?”

Zuoqiu Hanxun was surprised upon hearing those words.

However, he soon thought of something.

“Lord Clan Chief, could it be that young master Daoyi managed to...?” Zuoqiu Hanxun asked, feeling pleasantly surprised.

“Mn,” the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief nodded.

Seeing this, Zuoqiu Hanxun looked to the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation. The panic in his eyes disappeared, and was replaced with a look of expectation.

“Do you have any other tricks up your sleeve?”

“If you do, you should use them quickly. Otherwise, I’ll be taking care of you,” Chu Feng’s voice sounded in the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation.

“Take care of me?”

“Arrogant fool, only you will be taken care of.”

After saying those words, Zuoqiu Daoyi held his sword with both hands.

Then, flames emerged from his body.

Not only did the flames cover his entire body, but they also covered the sword in his hands.

Soon, the flames soared into the sky and turned into a giant silhouette over ten thousand meters tall.

That giant silhouette was Zuoqiu Daoyi.

Not only was its outward appearance the same, but even Zuoqiu Daoyi’s sword had been copied to the giant.

Flames were surging violently through that giant. Merely by looking at it, without even sensing its might, one would be stunned by it.

“Young master Daoyi actually managed to master that technique!”

Seeing the change to Zuoqiu Daoyi, the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen were engulfed by excitement. Unable to contain themselves, they started shouting and cheering.

The reason for that was because the flames emitted by Zuoqiu Daoyi were cyan.

As members of the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan, they knew very well what that ability was.

What Zuoqiu Daoyi had used was one of their Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan’s strongest martial skills, Exalted Taboo: Fiery Cyan Flames!

This Exalted Taboo: Fiery Cyan Flames was a rank four Exalted Taboo.

There was a restriction on one’s cultivation if one wanted to learn a rank four Exalted Taboo.

No matter how talented of a genius one might be, one’s real cultivation must reach rank four Utmost Exalted before one could learn a rank four Exalted Taboo.

If the person trying to learn a rank four Exalted Taboo had mediocre talent, they might have to wait till rank five or rank six Utmost Exalted before they could learn a rank four Exalted Taboo.

Yet, Zuoqiu Daoyi actually managed to successfully learn that rank four Exalted Taboo at a rank three Utmost Exalted-level cultivation.

This meant that Zuoqiu Daoyi’s talent was exceptional, and had reached a point beyond imagination.

Most importantly, Chu Feng’s cultivation earlier was only that of a rank eight Exalted. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Even though he had made two successive breakthroughs and become a rank one Utmost Exalted, he had made those breakthroughs just recently.

This meant that no matter how talented he might be, he would have no chance to have learned a rank four Exalted Taboo.

After all, his cultivation did not meet the requirements needed to learn a rank four Exalted Taboo.

As such, he simply possessed no technique that could possibly contend against Zuoqiu Daoyi.

After all, the power of a rank four Exalted Taboo far surpassed that of a rank three Exalted Taboo.

They were martial skills that only Utmost Exalted could learn.

“Interesting.”

Seeing gigantic Zuoqiu Daoyi surging with flames, Chu Feng could sense how powerful that martial skill was.

A rank four Exalted Taboo was surely powerful.

However, Chu Feng did not fluster before it. Instead, he placed his right hand onto his chest again.

“This guy, he couldn’t possibly...”

The Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen all felt disbelief upon witnessing Chu Feng’s action.

That movement he made was very familiar to them now.

After all, he had made that movement twice already.

That was the movement Chu Feng made to unleash his Exalted Taboo: Heavenly Fate Seal.

“Exalted Taboo: Heavenly Fate Seal!” Chu Feng shouted as he shot forth his right hand explosively.

“Boom~~~”

As rumbles sounded, light scattered in all directions.

The giant hand of light measuring over ten thousand meters appeared again.

The Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen had guessed correctly.

Chu Feng had unleashed that Exalted Taboo: Heavenly Fate Seal again.

Seeing that Chu Feng had actually used that Exalted Taboo: Heavenly Fate Seal again, Zuoqiu Daoyi shouted furiously, “You’re courting death!”

He felt that he was being thoroughly looked down on by Chu Feng.

As he shouted furiously, the giant flame silhouette turned into flames that covered the entire sky and moved toward Chu Feng explosively.

“Rumble~~~”

The giant hand of light collided with the enormous amount of flames.

In an instant, the light and the flames began to wreak havoc.

Surging energy ripples covered the entire Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation.

When the energy ripples began to gradually dissipate, the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen were all stunned.

Not even the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was an exception.

Zuoqiu Daoyi was completely uninjured.

Yet, Chu Feng was also completely uninjured.

Chu Feng had actually really managed to use that Exalted Taboo: Heavenly Fate Seal to take on Zuoqiu Daoyi’s rank four Exalted Taboo!

“How is this possible?”

“That Chu Feng actually really used that Exalted Taboo emitting a white light to take on our clan’s Exalted Taboo: Fiery Cyan Flames?”

“Exactly what sort of ability is that? How could it possess such power?”

The Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen realized that Chu Feng’s Exalted Taboo: Heavenly Fate Seal seemed to be even more extraordinary than they imagined it to be.

“Exactly what rank is that martial skill you used?” Zuoqiu Daoyi asked with a stern voice.

As matters stood, even he felt that Chu Feng’s Exalted Taboo: Heavenly Fate Seal was an extraordinary technique.

“A rank one Exalted Taboo,” replied Chu Feng.

“Say what?”

Zuoqiu Daoyi did not dare to believe his ears. He thought he had misheard Chu Feng.

Chu Feng repeated himself. “I said, the martial skill I used earlier is a rank one Exalted Taboo.”
