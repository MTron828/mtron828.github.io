Chapter 5884: Erecting a Golden Monument, the Greatest Honor

“Chu Xuanyuan has a son? And his son dares to come to our Three Saints Monstrous Clan?”

“Wait, if Chu Xuanyuan’s son is here, doesn’t it mean that Chu Xuanyuan is here too?”

The crowd chatted among themselves.

Their voices were initially filled with disdain and animosity, but they were quickly tinged with a hint of fear and nervousness. They didn’t know what happened outside, and they hadn’t heard about Chu Feng either, but they seemed to be apprehensive about dealing with Chu Xuanyuan.

“Chu Xuanyuan’s son came alone,” Elder Sheng said.

The crowd heaved a sigh of relief, and the tension in the air dissipated.

“He might be Chu Xuanyuan’s son, but I’ll have to ask you not to treat him with prejudice. Follow the rules and treat him as you’d usually do,” Elder Sheng added.

“Elder Sheng, if we go by the rules, can we challenge him and take away his high-tier pill?” someone asked.

“You may do so, but Chu Xuanyuan’s son is a junior. Going by the rules, only our juniors can challenge him,” Elder Sheng said.

“Elder Sheng, I should be qualified, right?” a white-haired man spoke up.

It was the person who clashed with Chu Feng earlier, Sansheng Fengliu. He had mostly recovered from his injuries, so his complexion was better than before.

“You may, but per the rules, you have to prepare a hundred high-tier pills before the challenge. If you lose, you’ll have to hand it over to him,” Elder Sheng said.

Someone immediately took out a hundred pills harnessing the natural energies of the world, suffusing the surroundings with an aroma. One could tell from the aroma itself that it was no ordinary pill.

The person who took out the pills was not the white-haired man but the black-haired man. His name was Sansheng Hongliang.

“I’ve prepared the high-tier pills. I only fear Chu Xuanyuan’s son won’t be able to make it in,” Sansheng Hongliang said.

“That’s possible. Of the present-era cultivators, only Chu Xuanyuan has been able to get into our Three Saints Monstrous Clan. Chu Xuanyuan’s son might not necessarily be strong; even heroes sometimes have useless offspring.”

“That’s true.”

Such words could be heard from the crowd. They had never met Chu Feng before, but they didn’t have a high opinion of the latter.

Weng!

Spirit power suddenly rippled from the stone door at the center of the square, and it manifested into a spirit formation gate.

“Oh? He cleared the trial?”

Both Sansheng Fengliu and Sansheng Hongliang smiled. They were looking forward to fighting Chu Feng and proving their strength. Defeating the intruder was something they could boast about for a long time to come.

Thus, they leaped forth and landed in front of the spirit formation gate.

Thousands more did the same.

All of them were either God-cloak World Spiritists or Half-God level cultivators, and they were all juniors. However, they took their place behind Sansheng Fengliu and Sansheng Hongliang as if they had come to an agreement.

“What are you doing? Causing trouble?” Sansheng Hongliang glanced at the crowd.

“We wouldn’t dare to, but there’s no need to use a cow butcher knife to slay a pig. It’d be excessive for our two young masters to deal with the likes of Chu Xuanyuan’s son. You should leave it to us instead,” the juniors said fawningly.

“Heh, don’t bother. You might lose your hard-earned high-tier pills. He’s probably no trash given how he’s able to come this far,” Sansheng Hongliu said.

“Young master Hongliang is right. Someone who can clear our trial can’t be trash, but we aren’t trash either. Young masters, why don’t you give us a chance to deal with him? It’s not too late for the two of you to make a move after we fail?” a man with a long face said.

“Well...” Sansheng Hongliu considered the matter. If I defeat Chu Feng after the others fall in defeat to him, won’t that make me the hero of the Three Saints Monstrous Clan? That will make a good story! However, it’ll be a gamble.

If the intruder was too weak, he might not get a chance to display his skills.

Boom boom boom!

The square suddenly shook, and a formation emerged on the ground beside the golden monument inscribed with Chu Xuanyuan’s name.

Moments later, another golden monument rose from the ground, and it only stopped when it reached the same height as Chu Xuanyuan’s golden monument. A brilliant light flowed through the golden monument like a soaring dragon, forming the words ‘Chu Feng’.

“A golden monument?” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The surroundings fell silent. Only Elder Sheng remained calm, having expected such a situation. However, the others widened their eyes in shock, and some even breathed heavily.

They knew what the golden monument meant.

This square was the center of their Three Saints Monstrous Clan. There was no greater honor for an outsider than to erect a monument here and permanently leave their mark here!

“Where are you going?” Sansheng Hongliang suddenly turned around and shouted.

The thousands of juniors had quickly retreated from the square like frightened birds.

“Someone who’s able to erect a golden monument is anything but ordinary. We know our place. We’ll leave it to the two young masters,” one of the juniors replied as he left the square.

In particular, the man with a long face ran the fastest.

“Tsk! No loyalty!” Sansheng Hongliang scoffed.

“Did the golden monument scare you too?” Sansheng Fengliu glanced at Sansheng Hongliang and asked. He remained as composed as ever, and the anticipation in his eyes intensified.

“What a joke! Why would I be afraid? I’ve already prepared my high-tier pills! I’m just saying they lack loyalty!” Sansheng Hongliang sneered.

“So you’re determined to compete with me?” Sansheng Fengliu asked.

“I’m worried you might be disadvantaged due to your injuries. You should leave Chu Xuanyuan’s son to me instead,” Sansheng Hongliang said.

He thought that this was an ideal chance for him to forge his reputation. If he defeated someone who erected a golden monument, his people would sing praises of him for many years to come.

“I have recovered from my injuries, but I’m sure I’ll be able to deal with Chu Xuanyuan’s son even if I’m injured. You can keep out of this matter,” Sansheng Fengliu said.

While the two of them were chatting, the spirit formation gate shook, and Chu Feng walked out.

Everyone turned to look at Chu Feng.

“So he’s Chu Xuanyuan’s son?”

“He does have an extraordinary disposition.”

It could be due to his halo as Chu Xuanyuan’s son or the golden monument, but the crowd dared not to make light of Chu Feng despite not knowing his cultivation level. In particular, the ladies looked at him with a peculiar gleam in their eyes.

Such foreigners held a different allure to them.

Sansheng Fengliu and Sansheng Hongliang, however, were dumbfounded.

“It’s you two again.” Chu Feng narrowed his eyes.

“Y-y-you... You weren’t manifested by a formation? You’re a real human being?!” Sansheng Hongliang stuttered in fear.

Sansheng Fengliu’s face turned ghastly pale. He secretly gulped down his saliva and wiped off his cold sweat.

“You thought I was manifested by a formation?” Chu Feng finally understood why the two of them were so disrespectful to him earlier.

“Indeed. We thought...” Sansheng Hongliang was going to explain the matter, but he thought it would be unwise to broadcast what happened earlier, so he quickly changed the topic. “Cough cough, so you’re Chu Xuanyuan’s son, Chu Feng?”

“That’s right,” Chu Feng replied.

“Congratulations on clearing the trial and arriving at our Three Saints Monstrous Clan. I am Sansheng Hongliang. Ah, this is Sansheng Fengliu. He wishes to challenge you to a battle.” Sansheng Hongliang stowed away his hundred top-tier pills and fled from the scene.

“Damn! You’re the most disloyal one of all!” Sansheng Fengliu berated. He turned to Chu Feng and saw the latter staring at him, and his back was immediately drenched in cold sweat.

“You want to challenge me?” Chu Feng asked.

“N-nothing of that sort! He’s just joking!” Sansheng Fengliu replied with a polite smile.

He quickly turned around and left, but he was so nervous that he tripped on his own legs and nearly fell. However, once he regained his balance, he fled from the scene at a speed even faster than Sansheng Hongliang.

The crowd was baffled.

“W-what’s going on?”
