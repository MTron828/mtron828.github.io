Chapter 2722 - The Legendary Divine Mark

“Haha...” However, compared to the displeasure of the fiery red-haired old man, the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master merely laughed indifferently.

He said, “Since little friend Chu Feng wishes to fight young master Chu Xianshuo using his own cultivation, we should comply with his desire.”

“After all, this is a personal grudge between the two of you.”

“However, little friend Chu Feng, there is one sentence that this old man must say beforehand.”

“As this is a personal grudge between the two of you, if you are to refuse the battle while in this old man’s territory, I should be protecting you.”

“As the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master, that is my obligation. It is also the rule that has been passed down through our Immortal Armament Villa.”

“However, since you have accepted the battle, this personal grudge can only be settled by the two of you.”

“If you are unable to match Chu Xianshuo, even if he is to kill you, this old man will not do anything about it,” the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master said to Chu Feng with a smile on his face.

At that moment, Chu Feng realized that this Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master was a much more ruthless individual than that red-haired old man.

This was unrelated to his personal character. Rather, it had to do with the manner in which he did things.

Chu Feng felt that the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master was most definitely sincere when he tried to offer to help Chu Feng increase his cultivation through the use of his spirit formation.

Since he declared that, he would be capable of doing it.

And now, the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master declared that he would not interfere should Chu Xianshuo be able to defeat Chu Feng and decide to kill him after.

These were most definitely also sincere words. Likewise, he was also capable of doing it since he declared it.

However, even though he knew that was the case, Chu Feng still did not show any fear on his face. Instead, he raised his hands and clasped his fist respectfully at the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master again. He said, “This junior appreciates senior’s kindness.”

“Zzzzzz~~~”

After he finished saying those words, Chu Feng’s expression instantly changed. Lightning began to flicker in his eyes.

At the same time, a character appeared on his forehead. It was the character ‘Divine.’

At that moment, Chu Feng’s aura increased from rank two True Immortal to rank three True Immortal.

Not only that, but black clouds also densely covered the sky. Lightning was flickering about through the clouds. That lightning was very frightening. It was like there were over ten thousand dragons galloping about.

If one were to see that lightning with one’s naked eye, then it would truly resemble the Divine Lightning that had emerged from the sky earlier.

“Heavens! The character on Chu Feng’s forehead! It’s the character ‘Divine!!!’”

“What a frightening Lightning Mark! It actually managed to increase his cultivation by an entire level! Never before have I seen such a powerful Lightning Mark!”

“Could this be the legendary Divine level Lightning Mark?! That Chu Feng was able to create a legendary Divine level Lightning Mark?!”

“In that case, wouldn’t it mean that the Divine Lightning that descended from the sky was caused by that Chu Feng?!”

At that moment, the crowd burst into an uproar. None of them were able to remain calm and collected.

Even the gazes with which they looked to Chu Feng had changed.

As this was the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, many people had heard of the legendary Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique.

The Divine Mark that Chu Feng gave rise to caused many people to recall the legendary Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique.

“Big brother Chu Xianshuo, how could that Chu Feng’s Lightning Mark have the character ‘Divine?’ Furthermore... how could his Lightning Mark be able to increase his cultivation by an entire level, and give rise to an abnormal sign? This is truly strange!”

The Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations were all panicking. They were even more panicked, as they themselves were possessors of Heavenly Bloodlines.

They had never before seen a Lightning Mark like the one on Chu Feng’s forehead.

“Big brother Xianshuo, that Chu Feng’s Lightning Mark couldn’t possibly be the legendary Divine level Lightning Mark, right?”

“That Chu Feng couldn’t have possibly trained in the legendary Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique, right?”

Overwhelmed with panic, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations began to send voice transmissions to Chu Xianshuo repeatedly.

They were very afraid that Chu Feng had trained in the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique. The reason for that was because it would mean that Chu Feng’s talent greatly surpassed their own.

It was precisely because they were afraid that they started to question Chu Xianshuo repeatedly. They were still holding out a trace of hope, hoping that Chu Xianshuo with deny their guesses.

However, they had no idea that Chu Xianshuo himself was also panicking.

“How the hell am I supposed to know?! All of you, shut up!”

Chu Xianshuo did not say those words through a voice transmission. Instead, he shouted at them furiously.

Thus, everyone present managed to hear his words.

Many of the people present were astute and circumspect individuals. They were people who had lived for thousands of years. Thus, they were able to tell that Chu Xianshuo and the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations were panicking.

That was very normal. It would instead be strange if they didn’t panic. After all, the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique was no small matter. It was a thing of legends.

“Lord Villa Master, that Chu Feng couldn’t have possibly really trained in the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique, right?” Even the fiery red-haired old man turned to ask the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master.

Once he asked that question, the others present immediately all shut their mouths.

Everyone turned their eyes toward the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master.

They all had speculations in their hearts. However, they wanted to verify their speculations.

As for the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master, he was the person with the strongest strength and highest status among the crowd present.

Thus, his words would be the most trustworthy.

“The ‘Divine’ character on little friend Chu Feng’s forehead is right before you all.”

“Is there even a need to ask that question?” The Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master said.

Once those words were said, the crowd once again burst into an uproar.

What the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master said had served to verify that Chu Feng had trained in the legendary Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique.

At that moment, the gazes of the crowd grew even more complicated as they looked to Chu Feng.

It was only at that moment that they realized that the person standing before them might be an exceptional genius.

No, it was not might, it was definitely. The person standing before them was definitely an exceptional genius.

He was a demon-level genius, an actual demon-level genius.

They knew that he was a demon-level genius not because of anything else, but merely because he had trained in the legendary Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique.

After all, the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique was not something that just anyone could train in.

The disparity between ordinary geniuses and demon-level geniuses was enormous.

There were countless geniuses in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. However, only a select few could be considered demon-level geniuses. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

And now, there was a demon-level genius standing before them. As such, how could they not be startled?

After all, demon-level geniuses could very possibly mature into an exceptional expert of an era.

All the things a demon-level genius experienced could become legends that would spread to future generations.

As for them, they could very possibly become people that witnessed such a legend. As such, how could they not be overjoyed by this?

“Which Heavenly Clan are you from? Who taught you your Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique?”

Right at that moment, Chu Xianshuo spoke out. After Chu Feng revealed his Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique, he had no choice but to take Chu Feng seriously. Even the tone that he spoke with had changed.

“The Heavenly Clan that I belong to and who taught me my Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique are both unrelated to you,” Chu Feng said.

“What arrogance! Don’t you think that just because you’ve trained in the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique that you are unequalled in the entire world.”

“With merely your current strength, you are still incapable of contending against me,” Chu Xianshuo declared.

“You’re overthinking things. I, Chu Feng, have not accepted your challenge so that I can contend against you,” Chu Feng said.

“Then why did you accept it?” Chu Xianshuo was confused.

If Chu Feng did not accept his challenge to fight against him, then why would Chu Feng accept the challenge?

Could it be that Chu Feng was a masochist and wanted to be suppressed to the ground like a dying dog by his oppressive might again?

At the moment when Chu Xianshuo was pondering, Chu Feng spoke again.

He said, “I accepted your challenge to defeat you.”

Once those words were said, the crowd immediately started to discuss it spiritedly among themselves.

Even though they were all extremely astonished by the fact that Chu Feng had trained in the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique, it remained that, regardless of how heaven-defying the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique might be, Chu Feng’s cultivation had only been increased to rank three True Immortal from rank two True Immortal.

There was still an entire level of cultivation between him and Chu Xianshuo.

The crowd was still not optimistic that Chu Feng would be able to defeat Chu Xianshuo.
