Chapter 3038 - Frightening Thing

“Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~”

After Chu Youyuan left, Chu Feng’s hands began to move nonstop, forming all kinds of hand seals. He had unleashed his boundless spirit power.

His spirit power was like a magnificent army of thousands of men and horses. Following Chu Feng’s commands, they began to move about in all directions and condense together.

Chu Feng was setting up a grand unsealing formation.

Chu Feng had determined that the Bandit Beasts’ treasury was located beneath the two grand formations. There was most definitely some sort of special purpose for those formations to be instilling energy beneath them.

That said, the treasury was concealed too well. Even Chu Feng was only able to find clues regarding it, and was unable to see through it completely.

As such, Chu Feng would have to set up a grand unsealing formation in order to enter the place where the Bandit Beasts kept their treasures.

“He... is actually also an Exalted-cloak World Spiritist?”

“For him to possess such abilities, exactly who is he?” At that moment, Luo Xiaofeng, who was already astonished by Chu Feng before, let out a trembling voice.

It was not only her; many others from the Luo Family were also feeling that way. They were completely stunned by how powerful Chu Feng was.

In fact, even Luo Dali, who had believed that Chu Feng would be able to save them the entire time, was stunned.

“You all are truly ignorant, you actually do not even recognize him,” at that moment, an old man arrived beside Luo Dali and the others from one of the two formations below.

He was an old man who was also captured with Chu Feng and the others. He possessed the cultivation of a rank two True Immortal. He had been quiet the entire time on the journey there, but surprisingly, he was actually speaking to the people from the Luo Family now.

Seeing that the old man seemed to know who Chu Feng was, Luo Dali hurriedly stepped forth and asked him, “Senior, exactly who is this benefactor of mine?”

The others from the Luo Family also cast their curious gazes toward the old man.

They all wanted to know exactly who Chu Feng was for him to possess such overwhelming power.

“Originally, I had thought that they were merely lookalikes. After all, with how vast of a place the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm is, there are a lot of lookalikes.”

“However, judging by things now, he is most definitely not simply a lookalike. Instead, it really is him. He is the future hope of our Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm,” the old man looked to Chu Feng as he said those words. Not only were his eyes filled with endless anticipation for the future, but even his voice was filled with excitement.

“Senior, exactly who is he?” The people from the Luo Family were unable to contain their curiosity.

“It would appear that this place is truly a remote location. The news in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm travels far and fast. Yet, you all have never heard of the name Chu Feng,” Seeing that Luo Dali and the others seemed to really not know about Chu Feng, the old man revealed a helpless expression.

After all, truly few people in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm did not know about Chu Feng.

“While you all might not have heard about Chu Feng, you should’ve heard about the Chu Heavenly Clan, right?” The old man asked.

“We naturally know about the Chu Heavenly Clan. They are the overlords of our Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. Who wouldn’t possibly know about the Chu Heavenly Clan?” Luo Dali said.

“In that case, have you all heard about Chu Xuanyuan?” The old man asked.

“We have naturally heard about Chu Xuanyuan. He was Chu Hanxian’s son and a legend of our Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. He was even deemed to be the strongest man to ever appear in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm,” Luo Dali appeared very emotional when mentioning Chu Xuanyuan. Even his tone became emotional.

Hearing those words, that old man revealed a smile on his face. He said, “In that case, things will be easier then.”

“Not only is that Chu Feng the strongest person of the Chu Heavenly Clan’s current younger generations, he is also Chu Hanxian’s grandson, and Chu Xuanyuan’s son,” the old man said.

“What? He’s actually Lord Chu Xuanyuan’s son? But... but... wasn’t it said that his son...???”

The words spoken by that old man came like a lightning strike to the head. It was not only Luo Dali; all of the people from the Luo Family felt their heads buzzing. They simply did not dare to believe what they had just heard.

Not to mention the fact that they felt someone of that caliber would never come across them in their entire life, they’d also heard rumors of Chu Xuanyuan’s son having died since a long time ago.

“There’s no but. Chu Xuanyuan’s son hasn’t died. Furthermore, he is standing before you all.”

“Moreover, you all insulted him earlier,” as the old man spoke, he took a deliberate glance at Luo Xiaofeng and the others from the Luo Family.

“Heavens! He’s actually that Chu Feng!” At that moment, Luo Dali became extremely excited. He seemed to be on the verge of being unable to contain his excitement. His body was trembling so much that he resembled someone who was seriously ill and dying.

As for the others of the Luo Family, especially Luo Xiaofeng and Xu Jialuo, they all fell paralyzed on their butts with ashen faces.

It was only at that moment that they realized what sort of person they’d insulted.

Merely the title of a Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generation would be sufficient to bring upon them the penalty of death.

As for Chu Feng, he was even the strongest person of the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations, the descendant of the two legends Chu Hanxian and Chu Xuanyuan.

“The-the-then, senior, who is that senior over there?” Luo Dali pointed to Chu Youyuan, who was treating Ying Mingchao and Zi Xunyi’s injuries in midair.

“I truly do not know that person. That said, seeing that he appeared at this place together with Chu Feng, I’m assuming that he should be that person,” the old man said.

“Which person?” Luo Dali asked.

“Even if I tell you about it, you wouldn’t know who that person is. All you need to know is that with that person’s strength, even the Starfall Holy Land’s Headmaster would have to bow to him and address him as ‘Milord.’”

“Although he is not a Chu Heavenly Clan’s Supreme Elder, both his status and strength are not inferior to that of the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Supreme Elders,” that old man said.

“He’s actually that powerful? Heavens! I truly never would’ve imagined that I, Luo Dali, would be able to witness such a grand character in my lifetime. Even if I am to die after this, it would all have been worth it. I have not lived my life in vain,” Luo Dali was extremely excited. He did not notice that his family that were scared witless behind him.

At that moment, a single word was echoing through the minds of the people from the Luo Family.

‘Screwed, screwed, screwed.’

They felt that they were totally screwed. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

They actually ended up provoking an Supreme Elder-level character of the Chu Heavenly Clan.

A person like that was truly someone capable of exercising magical powers in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, someone akin to a god. A single spit from a person like that would be able to drown them to death.

“Buzz~~~”

Right at that moment, light started to flicker within the two grand formations. Runes and symbols began to rush forth. Chu Feng had successfully set up his grand unsealing formation.

Chu Feng’s grand unsealing formation had surrounded the two grand formations. However, it did not seal anyone within it.

“Everyone, your life and death is unrelated to me.”

“I will offer you all a bit of advice. What I am going to do now will be very dangerous. If you all wish to survive, do not linger around here, and leave immediately,” Chu Feng said.

Hearing what Chu Feng said, the people that were still inside the two grand formations hurriedly soared into the sky and fled far away with their fastest speed.

There were even people among them that did not even bother to turn around, and instead fled directly.

However, there were also people that stopped fleeing after distancing themselves from Chu Feng’s grand formation. Furthermore, they even turned back to look.

They all wanted to know what Chu Feng planned to do.

They were no longer that scared for their lives.

After all, even without mentioning Chu Youyuan’s strength, merely Chu Feng’s strength was sufficient to provide them with a sense of safety.

Thus, they were no longer afraid of the Bandit Beasts. Instead, they wanted to know exactly why a grand character like Chu Feng had arrived at a place like that.

“Formation, activate!” Suddenly, Chu Feng shouted.

Rumbles began sounding nonstop.

As Chu Feng’s grand formation was activated, the two energy-providing formations began to collapse, and even the ground started to cave in.

“Unseal!” Chu Feng shouted again.

This time around, the power of Chu Feng’s grand formation grew even stronger. Not to mention the boundless aura of the grand formation, merely the intense light emitted by it caused many bystanders to be unable to open their eyes.

Seeing that, the people from the Luo Family saw a hope for survival. Without even looking back, they started fleeing from the hideout.

“Why are you all running away? Lord Benefactor saved us, are you all not planning to thank him?” Luo Dali ran after his family and started to berate them.

“Have you gone mad? We contradicted him like that earlier, so how could he possibly spare us when he finishes what he’s doing?”

“If we don’t flee now, when should we flee?” The people from the Luo Family spoke in unison.

“You all are truly looking down on our Lord Benefactor’s character. If he wanted to kill you all, he would’ve already done so when you contradicted him earlier. Why would he keep you all alive till now?” Luo Dali said.

Hearing what Luo Dali said, the eyes of the people from the Luo Family changed somewhat. They suddenly realized that what Luo Dali said was reasonable.

Since ancient times, experts would always directly unleash their attacks when they were angry. There was simply no reason for an expert to hold back.

As for Chu Feng, he seemed to not be angry with them from the very start. Even when they insulted him, he only smiled at their insults, and did not attempt to tidy them up.

Could it be that Chu Feng was such an open minded person that he did not possess the intention to bring harm upon them? If that was the case, wouldn’t the narrow-minded people be them instead?

“Rumble~~~”

Right at that moment, a loud explosion was suddenly heard from the direction of the grand formation.

The crowd all turned their gazes there. They discovered that not only were the two grand formations filled with crystal stones completely destroyed by Chu Feng’s grand unsealing formation, but the earth below had also completely caved in, leaving behind an endless abyss.

At that moment, screams could be heard from deep within that abyss. The screams were so terrifying that they resembled demonic roars.

Hearing those screams, the crowd felt their hair stand on end, and began to shiver in fear.

Furthermore, the screams were growing louder and clearer.

This meant that some sort of frightening thing was approaching them.
