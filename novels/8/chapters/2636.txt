Chapter 2636 - Ocean Of People

Those gaseous flames appeared very imposing. It seemed as if they were planning to burn Chu Feng to death.

However, the gaseous flames soon started to gradually vanish. To be exact, they were being absorbed by Chu Feng. The gaseous flames were currently fusing with Chu Feng.

Seeing this, Li Yue’er heaved a sigh of relief. Even though the Divine Dragon’s Blood Ruler had initially resisted Chu Feng, from the way it appeared now, Chu Feng had evidently successfully subdued the Divine Dragon’s Blood Ruler.

“I had thought that it would enter Absolute Submission to me. After all, I personally forged it.”

“Never did I imagine that this Divine Dragon’s Blood Ruler would be this stubborn. It truly was quite taxing to subdue you,” Chu Feng said with a beaming smile as he fiddled with the Divine Dragon’s Blood Ruler in his hand.

In the past, most of the weapons that he had subdued entered Absolute Submission. As such, he would, to a lesser or greater degree, receive power from the weapons that he subdued. Those weapons’ power would, to a greater or lesser extent, provide assistance to his cultivation or even increase it directly.

However, even though he had managed to subdue the Divine Dragon’s Blood Ruler and made it recognize him as its master, he was unable to make it undergo Absolute Submission. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Incomplete Immortal Armaments all possess lives. It is best that you do not say those infuriating words toward it. Else... even if it is willing to be used by you, it will not entrust all of its power to you,” Li Yue’er warned Chu Feng.

“Understood,” Chu Feng lightly smiled. Then, he gently caressed the Divine Dragon’s Blood Ruler and said, “You are, after all, the weapon that I have personally forged. I will definitely treat you well.”

“You should give it a name,” Li Yue’er said.

“Let’s just continue to call it the Divine Dragon’s Blood Ruler. After all, its appearance resembles a ruler more than a sword,” Chu Feng said with a wry smile.

Originally, Chu Feng and Li Yue’er had planned to forge the Divine Dragon’s Blood Ruler into a sword.

However, as Chu Feng had decided to skip the process of customizing the appearance of the weapon, the Divine Dragon’s Blood Ruler ended up having the same appearance as it did before, and simply did not resemble a sword at all.

“That works,” Li Yue’er said.

“Oh, that’s right. When do you plan to enter the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm?” Chu Feng asked.

“I’m planning to set off right away. Do you want to journey there with me?” Li Yue’er asked.

“I’m afraid that I can’t. I must still go and settle my debt with the Infant Soul Sect,” Chu Feng said.

“Even though you’ve managed to successfully reach a breakthrough, your cultivation is still only that of a rank one True Immortal. Even though you’ve grasped that overwhelmingly powerful secret skill, you might not necessarily be a match for the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster with your current cultivation.”

“Unless... you’re planning to use the power of your Demon Armament again?” Li Yue’er asked.

“Rest assured, I do not have to utilize the power of the Demon Armament again. Furthermore... I will definitely be able to destroy the Infant Soul Sect with my own hands this time around,” Chu Feng said in a very confident manner.

As Chu Feng was extremely confident, he was also extremely excited at that moment.

His father, Chu Xuanyuan, had given him a mission before he went to the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. That mission was to eliminate the Infant Soul Sect.

However, because of his insufficient strength and impatience to eliminate the Infant Soul Sect, Chu Feng had given up on that mission, given up upon eliminating the Infant Soul Sect personally.

When the allied army was formed, Chu Feng felt that Ying Mingchao would be the one to eliminate the Infant Soul Sect. After all, Ying Mingchao was the strongest individual in the allied army at that time.

However, never did any of them expect the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster to be that powerful. Even Ying Mingchao was no match for him.

However, the situation had changed. After Chu Feng entered the True Immortal realm and felt the strength he currently possessed, Chu Feng felt that he would be able to eliminate the Infant Soul Sect by himself.

With that, he would be able to accomplish the mission given to him by his father.

Although Chu Feng was already thirty years old, compared to the age limit of being under forty years old to accomplish this mission, Chu Feng was still very young.

As long as Chu Feng was able to accomplish the mission, it would mean that he would have brought shame upon the Chu Heavenly Clan.

After all, the mission to eliminate the Infant Soul Sect was a mission set up by the Chu Heavenly Clan for their younger generations.

However, not all of the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generation could attempt the mission, as there was also the forty year age limit. Those who were older than forty years old would not be able to attempt the mission.

This led to there being no one from the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generation capable of accomplishing the mission even after many years had passed. In fact, many talents from the younger generation of the Chu Heavenly Clan had even been killed by the Infant Soul Sect.

The Infant Soul Sect, this Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm’s demonic sect, was simply incomparable to the powers in the Upper Realms.

However, it had become a nightmare in the eyes of countless Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations. In fact, it became a taboo that they did not dare to touch.

As for Chu Feng, who was he? He was a child deemed trash and discarded by the Chu Heavenly Clan. On his forehead was still imprinted the character ‘trash’ that was personally branded upon him by the Chu Heavenly Clan.

If Chu Feng, this trash in the eyes of the Chu Heavenly Clan, was able to accomplish that mission, it would most definitely serve as an enormous humiliation to the Chu Heavenly Clan.

“Since you are determined to go, I will not stop you. Let us bid our farewells now,” Li Yue’er said.

“I believe that we will meet again,” Chu Feng said with a light smile.

“I think so too. As long as both of us are still alive,” Li Yue’er said.

“We definitely will be,” Chu Feng said.

Then, Chu Feng parted ways with Li Yue’er.

Li Yue’er proceeded toward the teleportation formation leading to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. In other words, she had proceeded for the so-called Stairway to Heaven.

As for Chu Feng, he proceeded directly toward Chen Heavenly City, the headquarters of the Infant Soul Sect.

Chu Feng wanted to know exactly what sort of grand activity was happening at the Infant Soul Sect, exactly what was it that the Infant Soul Sect spent so much time and effort plotting for.

............

Chen Heavenly City was completely destroyed on the day when Ying Mingchao and the Infant Soul Sect’s Sect master battled.

However, not only was Chen Heavenly City completely restored now, but it was even many times larger than before.

This new Chen Heavenly City was unimaginably large. Even when standing in the sky and looking down below, one could only see the tip of the iceberg known as Chen Heavenly City.

This city was large enough that it could accommodate everyone in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.

That said, even though the city had expanded many times in size, there were no other buildings apart from the city walls. To be exact, this was merely an empty city with city walls around it.

That said, the city was not a ghost city. On the contrary, it was utterly bustling with noise and excitement.

At a glance, one could see figures all over the city. Those were not ants. Instead, they were humans.

In fact, it was not only humans that were in the city. There were also a lot of monstrous beasts.

There were so many people that one simply could not see the end of them. At a glance, people’s silhouettes seemed to extend all the way to the horizon.

This was a boundless ocean formed with people’s bodies. This was... an ocean of people.

A scene like this could not be described even with the word ‘spectacular.’

Although not everyone from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm was gathered in Chen Heavenly City, at least ninety percent of them were gathered there.

At that moment, the faces of those people were all filled with excitement. They were all anticipating the opening of the Infant Soul Grand Formation. They were all waiting for the Infant Soul Grand Formation to grant them martial comprehension that would allow them to increase their cultivation.

“Sectmaster Hun, everyone that should be here has arrived. The people that did not come are all those that do not want to come. How much longer are you planning to wait till the activation of your Infant Soul Grand Formation?” The Abbot of the Buddha’s Heavenly Temple asked.

“Don’t be so anxious. There are still people on their way here. The Infant Soul Grand Formation will be activated once they’re all here.”

“Everyone, please rest assured. The Infant Soul Grand Formation will bestow all of you with its power. Everyone here will be able to benefit from the Infant Soul Grand Formation,” The Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster spoke to the crowd with a deeply resonating voice.

Even though not everyone was able to see his image, they all heard his voice.

“Long live the Infant Soul Sect! Long live Lord Sectmaster!!!”

It was unknown who started shouting those words. However, soon, everyone started to echo those words.

The densely packed crowd of millions and millions of humans and monstrous beasts were all shouting in unison. This scene was truly spectacular.

That said, it was also very lamentable at the same time. After all, the Infant Soul Sect was a power that willfully slaughtered the innocent.

Such a demonic sect should the target of scorn. They should be detested by all.

Yet, the Infant Soul Sect... was actually revered and worshipped by everyone like gods.

As such, how was it not lamentable???
