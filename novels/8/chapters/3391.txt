Chapter 3391 - The Scramble For The Entrances

The crowd’s hearts all tensed up upon seeing Queen Mother Fox Immortal. More or less, restraining fear emerged in their eyes.

Queen Mother Fox Immortal was greatly renowned for her viciousness. Although they’d never witnessed it themselves, they’d heard a lot about her from their seniors.

Thus, upon seeing Queen Mother Fox Immortal, everyone revealed deep veneration for her. Even Linghu Yueyue and the other extraordinary members of the younger generation did not dare to show any negligence.

After all, before them was an actual female demon. Furthermore, she was completely fearless, and would never give anyone face.

When the various powers were unwilling to offend her, they, people of the younger generation, would naturally not be willing to offend her.

“Although your relationships are quite good, I must still warn you. Only a single person can enter each of the twelve entrances. Thus, among all of you, only twelve people will be able to enter that grand formation,” Queen Mother Fox Immortal said.

“Really? Only twelve people can enter?” At that moment, the expressions of the younger generations present had all, to a greater or lesser degree, changed.

They had all heard about the grand formation.

However, they were uncertain about it. After obtaining the answer from Queen Mother Fox Immortal, they started to panic slightly.

Adding the eight people of the Ancestral Martial Decastars and the Liangqiu sisters, there were a total of ninety-eight people. For ninety-eight people to fight over twelve seats, this was quite ruthless.

“You will naturally be able to obtain a lot of benefits should you be able to enter the grand formation. However, even if you fail to enter the grand formation, it does not mean that you will end up empty-handed.”

“We have prepared a grand gift for you all. However, that gift is something that can only be obtained through the cooperation of the eliminated individuals.”

“As for what the gift will be, you will all naturally come to know when the time comes.”

As Queen Mother Fox Immortal spoke, she waved her sleeve, and the ground started to tremble violently. As the trembling continued, a palace slowly emerged from deep underground.

Seeing that palace, Chu Feng’s expression changed. Then, he smiled faintly. ‘They’ve sure prepared amply.’

Chu Feng was able to tell with a single glance that the palace was actually a spirit formation. Furthermore, that spirit formation was connected to the grand formation.

Upon seeing the grand formation, Chu Feng became even more certain that Queen Mother Fox Immortal and other three Saint-cloak World Spiritists had gathered here, and set up this evaluation for the younger generations to come. It was all for the sake of exploiting the power of the younger generations to help them obtain something that they wanted.

Of course, what they wanted to obtain was not that easily obtainable. Otherwise, the four of them wouldn’t have put forth so much effort and made so many twists and turns to get it..

“That said, I must remind you all that if you are able to enter the grand formation, you will naturally be able to obtain even more benefits. Inside that grand formation... are rewards that we have meticulously prepared for you. Of course, how much you obtain... will depend on your own strength.”

“In addition, if your strength is sufficient, you might even obtain the treasures left behind by the World Spiritist Immortal King,” Queen Mother Fox Immortal said.

“The treasures left behind by the World Spiritist Immortal King?” The younger generation’s eyes all began to shine upon hearing those words.

“Through our years of inspection, we have learned that the grand formation contains five world spiritist swords.”

“Contained within each world spiritist sword is enormous world spirit power. To you all, the world spirit power will be of enormous assistance,” Queen Mother Fox Immortal said.

The crowd all became excited upon hearing the Queen Mother Fox Immortal’s words. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

However, Chu Feng shook his head. As he had seen the contents of the spirit formation in the Fire Prison, he knew that the world spiritist swords did exist. However, they were very difficult to find, and extremely hard to subdue.

If a world spiritist sword refused to recognize one as its master, one would not be able to control it at all. On the contrary... one would be in great danger.

Furthermore, even if the world spiritist sword recognized one as its master, it would still be very difficult to obtain its power.

In order to obtain the power of a world spiritist sword, one must assimilate it with another power.

As for that power, it was capable of allowing a world spiritist to make a breakthrough.

It was also the power that was explicitly stated should not be touched in the Fire Prison.

Merely, apart from Chu Feng, it seemed that no one knew about this.

At that moment, the people of the younger generation were all endlessly excited. Even the Ancestral Martial Decastars and the Liangqiu Sisters were extremely excited.

It was understandable that the others did not know about the world spiritist swords.

However, the Liangqiu Sisters were Grandmaster Liangqiu’s disciples. As such, they shouldn’t be so unfamiliar with the circumstances of the grand formation.

Currently, there was only a single explanation that Chu Feng could think of.

That is, Grandmaster Liangqiu, Queen Mother Fox Immortal and the others also did not know about the dangers of the power contained within the grand formation.

“Senior, will we be able to find the world spiritist swords should we enter the grand formation?” Someone asked.

“Normally, with your strength, it would be impossible for you all to find them. However, we have already entered the grand formation before you, and made preparations in there.”

“We have already discovered two world spiritist swords. Furthermore, we have confined them within a limited area.”

“We will also be activating a spirit formation to weaken the power of the grand formation. This will be of enormous assistance to you all.”

“Thus, go ahead and scramble for them, go ahead and unleash your ambitions in fighting over this rare opportunity.”

“Little fellows, do not disappoint this queen.”

After the Queen Mother Fox Immortal finished saying those words, she smiled charmingly and disappeared.

“Woosh~~~”

Right at that moment, someone took the initiative and rushed into the rat zodiac’s entrance.

That person was naturally Wuma Shengjie.

Wuma Shengjie’s movement immediately ignited the crowd.

At that moment, everyone immediately set off and rushed toward the entrance that they’d chosen.

Of course, there were many people that had chosen the rat zodiac’s entrance.

After all, they’d heard that the rat zodiac’s entrance was the simplest and the easiest to pass.

“Wuuahh~~~”

However, the people that entered the rat zodiac’s entrance, without any exception, were all knocked back.

Seeing their sorry states, it was obvious that they were beaten back by someone.

So many people had rushed toward the rat zodiac’s entrance. Yet, they were all knocked out. Only Wuma Shengjie’s figure did not reappear.

With that, the crowd all knew who it was that had beaten those people back.

“Yoh, that kid from the Wuma Heavenly Clan that just entered seems to be quite remarkable,” Linghu Yueyue looked to the rat zodiac’s entrance with interest.

“That guy is indeed quite remarkable,” Liangqiu Lanyue said.
