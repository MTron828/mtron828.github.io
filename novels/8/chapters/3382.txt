Chapter 3382 - Jackals Of The Same Tribe

“What did you say?!” Chu Feng’s words were immediately met with furious and threatening gazes from the Xu Heavenly Clansmen.

However, facing their threats, Chu Feng was not only confident, but his attitude became even more unyielding, “Are you hard of hearing? In that case, I can repeat myself. I asked, why do I have to move aside?”

“You dare speak to us in such a manner?! You are truly asking for a beating!”

The Xu Heavenly Clansmen were enraged by Chu Feng’s words. Several among them not only rushed toward Chu Feng, but they even raised their hands with the intention to beat him up and slap some sense into him.

“Wuuahh~~~”

However, before their raised hands could even land, a strong burst of wind swept forth and overturned the Xu Heavenly Clansmen.

At that moment, an Exalted-level oppressive might appeared out of thin air.

“If you all plan to touch him, you’ll have to pass this old man first,” the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief stood before Chu Feng majestically.

“This aura, an Exalted?!”

At that moment, everyone present felt the aura of the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief. At that moment, the gazes with which they looked to Chu Feng, Wuma Shengjie and the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief turned serious.

No matter what, Exalted-level experts were Exalted-level experts. They were beings that had reached a realm of cultivation that was impossible for many people to set foot into. Regardless of where they were in the Ancestral Martial Starfield, Exalted-level experts were powerful beings.

“You... who are you?” Although the Xu Heavenly Clansmen were arrogant and despotic, they were immediately terrified upon being faced with an Exalted-level expert.

This was especially true when they saw the title plate on the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief’s waist. The panic in their eyes turned to fear.

“This old man is the clan chief of the Wuma Heavenly Clan, Wuma Tao,” The Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“Wuma Tao? Isn’t the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief Wuma Yantian?”

Upon hearing the words of the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, the Xu Heavenly Clansmen all began to look to one another with confused expressions.

“It should be that so-called main clan.”

Right at that moment, a man from the group of Xu Heavenly Clansmen stood out.

That man was also a person of the younger generation within a hundred years of age. He was very handsome, and his cultivation was pretty decent too. He was a rank three Heavenly Immortal.

Amongst the people of the younger generations, that level of cultivation could be said to be extremely strong.

“It’s the young master of the Xu Heavenly Clan.”

Once that man stood forth, sounds of discussion could be heard from the crowd.

From the discussions of the crowd, Chu Feng learned that the man was called Xu Morong. Xu Morong was the youngest son of the Xu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief. He was also the son that the Xu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief thought most highly of. Reportedly, he was planning to pass on his position as the clan chief to Xu Morong. As such, Xu Morong was the target of focused nurture by the Xu Heavenly Clan.

“Young master, what’s this so-called main clan about?” The Xu Heavenly Clansmen stepped forth to ask Xu Morong.

“They could be considered to be a distant relative of the Ten Great Heavenly Clan’s Wuma Heavenly Clan. However, they’ve long been discarded by them.”

“And now, he’s actually protecting someone from the Chu Heavenly Clan. Likely, they have mingled with the Chu Heavenly Clan. It is no wonder the Wuma Heavenly Clan is unwilling to associate themselves with this distant relative of theirs,” Xu Morong explained.

“So that’s the case. He scared me when he said he was the clan chief of the Wuma Heavenly Clan. I even thought he was Wuma Yantian. It turns out he’s actually a distant relative of the Wuma Heavenly Clan,” Upon finding out that the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was not Wuma Yantian, the fear on the faces of the Xu Heavenly Clansmen immediately disappeared into thin air.

In addition to that, when they looked to the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief again, their eyes were filled with contempt.

That bunch of people of the younger generation whose cultivations were mostly at the peak True Immortal realm actually dared to look down on an Exalted-level expert.

“Even if it were your father standing before me, he would not necessarily dare to speak to this old man in such a manner.”

At that moment, the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief narrowed his brows. A faint amount of anger was present in his eyes.

Even though their Wuma Heavenly Clan’s main clan was indeed much inferior to the branch clan, he knew very well that the Xu Heavenly Clan’s strength was only on par with their Wuma Heavenly Clan too.

Yet, even the Xu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations dared to look down on him so much. It was simply like a bunch of puppies looking down on a fierce tiger. If anyone else were standing in the shoes of the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, they would also feel displeased.

“Someone like you thinks you’re qualified to be discussed alongside my father?” However, Xu Morong was actually enraged by the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief’s comment.

His attitude simply did not place the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief in his eyes. From the bottom of his heart, he felt that the Wuma Heavenly Clan was inferior to them.

“What insolence! Today, this old man will properly teach you a lesson on behalf of your father!”

Faced with Xu Morong acting in such a manner, the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was completely enraged. As he spoke, his oppressive might became even stronger. He was really planning to teach Xu Morong a lesson.

“Who dares release this oppressive might?!”

Right at that moment, a furious shout was heard. Following that, three figures landed.

At the same time, a rank seven Exalted-level oppressive might appeared out of the blue and covered the entire region.

They were three old men. Every one of them possessed a fiendish appearance.

This was especially true for the white-haired old man leading the three. His brows were naturally slanted upward, and his eyes were emitting an ominous glint. His appearance was as terrifying as that of a fierce beast.

Seeing him, one would feel fear just from his appearance. It was even more so when his overwhelming strength was added to the equation.

After all, that rank seven Exalted-level oppressive might was released by none other than him.

That old man’s cultivation was only a level beneath Wuma Yantian’s. He was definitely not someone that the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief could match.

Upon seeing those three old men, not only did the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief’s expression change, but everyone present also started to feel deep veneration for them.

The reason for that was because those three old men were all from the Tantai Heavenly Clan.

As for the person leading the group of three, he was no ordinary individual either. His name was Tantai Changfei. Although he was not the strongest expert of the Tantai Heavenly Clan, he was someone who possessed a high status within the Tantai Heavenly Clan.

Furthermore, he was the one in charge of watching over the Ice Summit.

“We pay our respects to Elder Changfei.”

“Elder Changfei, you must uphold justice for this junior.”

Upon seeing Tantai Changfei, that Xu Morong immediately knelt with an expression of grievance. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Following him, all of the Xu Heavenly Clansmen knelt on the ground.

Some among them even went so far as to weep bitter tears. It was as if they were truly wronged.

Witnessing such a scene, Chu Feng narrowed his brows. For Xu Morong to act so arrogantly, and for those three elders of the Tantai Heavenly Clan to rush over so aggressively, Chu Feng had a feeling that... they were likely jackals of the same tribe.

“Morong, get up first. Tell me, exactly what happened?” That Tantai Changfei helped Xu Morong back up. His attitude was very friendly and intimate.

Xu Morong would naturally not tell the truth. Instead, he distorted the truth, and pushed all of the blame onto Chu Feng and the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, and made himself the victim.

“Impudent! What sort of place did you think this is?! You dare to behave so atrociously here?!”

Sure enough, after hearing what Xu Morong said, that Tantai Changfei was immediately enraged. He simply had no intention to question Chu Feng and the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief. Instead, he immediately aimed his anger at them.

Chu Feng had guessed correctly. They were indeed jackals of the same tribe.

It was no wonder the Xu Heavenly Clan dared to act so arrogantly and condescendingly and be so confident at the same time.

The Tantai Heavenly Clan really was their backing.

“Milord, please investigate as to what the actual truth is. It was clearly they who refused to line up to ascend the mountain. Because we refused to move aside for them, they wanted to attack us. How could we be at fault?”

“If you do not believe us, you can ask the people present. All of them witnessed the scene,” The Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief spoke with deep grievance.

However, the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief did not notice that after he finished saying those words, the people present either started to continue on their journey up the mountain, or lowered their heads silently. Simply no one was willing to testify for them.

That said, Tantai Changfei had no intention to question the bystanders to begin with. Instead, he pointed at the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief and shouted angrily, “What are you trying to imply here?! Are you trying to say that this old man is discriminating in their favor?! Who the hell do you think you are to question this old man’s decisions?!”

Suddenly, Chu Feng spoke. “Enough of your shouting. We have not come here today for your Tantai Heavenly Clan.”

“Call this person down, and we will immediately leave,”

At the moment when Chu Feng spoke, the crowd’s expressions all changed.

The reason for that was because Chu Feng took out a title plate at the same time as he spoke.

Not only was that title plate very meticulously engraved, but the words ‘Wuming Xingyun’ were also inscribed on it!!!
