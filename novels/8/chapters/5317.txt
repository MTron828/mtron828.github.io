Chapter 5317: Vying For the Spots

Following that, the Ancient Realm’s chief allowed the hundred juniors he had picked out beforehand to freely choose the team they wanted to tag along with. 

All of them immediately ran in Chu Feng’s direction.

This left Zhou Dong, Qin Shu, and Jia Chengying feeling utterly embarrassed. 

If not for the limit on how many people could join a certain team, most of them would have surely chosen to go with Chu Feng. It was only after Chu Feng’s team was full did the other juniors finally began picking amongst the remaining three teams. 

Zhou Dong, Qin Shu, and Jia Chengying were infuriated. They were top-notch prodigies who were respected wherever they went, but they actually became the second choice here!

“Young hero Chu Feng, you have the right to first choose which spirit formation gate you wish to go with,” the Ancient Realm’s chief said.

“Damn it!” Jia Chengying was enraged. 

Chu Feng was nothing but a lowly peasant to him, but as soon as they got here, everyone suddenly began putting him on a pedestal as if he was some kind of god. Jia Chengying found this hard to accept.

“I’ll choose the first one,” Chu Feng said.

Following that, he entered the first spirit formation gate together with Bai Yunqing and 25 other juniors from the Ancient Realm. Right after they passed through the spirit formation gate, they found themselves standing in the middle of an underground hall. As soon as the final person entered the underground hall, the spirit formation gate disappeared into thin air.

This meant that they would need to find another exit route if they wanted to leave the underground hall. 

“Everyone, I think that we should pick a new leader,” Bai Yunqing suddenly spoke up.

“Pick a new leader? Didn’t Lord Chief say that young hero Chu Feng is the leader?” a junior protested.

“Think about it. Lord Chief sent you in here so that you can benefit from this experience. There’s no doubt that the underground hall before you is filled with dangers. I am the disciple of the Totem Dragon Clan’s First Guest Elder, Taishi Xingzhong, and I am a rank two Half-God level cultivator. As for my spirit power…” 

Bai Yunqing released a burst of spirit power, causing his robes to flutter. 

“He’s a Blue Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist!”

“Amazing!”

The juniors of the Ancient Realm were impressed by Bai Yunqing’s display of power. 

“With my spirit power, we’ll be able to overcome any formation obstacles. Let me put it this way. If there are any formations here that even I, Bai Yunqing, am unable to unravel, the other teams will definitely be stuck as well. Furthermore, this isn’t all I am capable of.”

Bai Yunqing reined in his spirit power. The next moment, a Lightning Mark and Lightning Armor appeared around him, raising his cultivation to rank four Half-God level. 

“Woah, he’s able to raise his cultivation by two ranks in Half-God level! This is remarkable! As expected of Lord Taishi Xingzhong’s disciple!”

The juniors of the Ancient Realm looked at Bai Yunqing in admiration. 

Bai Yunqing was satisfied with the adulation he was receiving from the juniors of the Ancient Realm. With a gleeful smile, he looked at Chu Feng and taunted him, “Brother Chu Feng, you shouldn’t have any qualms with reselecting the team leader, right? Everyone’s safety is on the line here. It’s only natural for us to choose a leader whom we can trust.” 

“You’re right. Let’s reselect the team leader then,” Chu Feng said.

“Good!” Bai Yunqing thought that Chu Feng was afraid of him, which caused his gleeful smile to further widen. He turned to the juniors of the Ancient Realm and said, “Everyone, stand in front of your preferred team leader.” 

Bai Yunqing was filled with confidence when he first said those words, but his expression began to stiffen up a second later. He couldn’t believe his eyes. He had already displayed his prowess, but 24 of the juniors still chose to walk toward Chu Feng.

Only a decent-looking woman chose Bai Yunqing.

“You all have horrible eyes!” Bai Yunqing glared at the 24 juniors who chose Chu Feng before turning his attention to the only woman who walked toward him. He was consoled by the fact that the woman was still decent-looking.

“This lady over here, you’re the only one with good eyes here. I promise that you won’t regret choosing me over Chu Feng,” Bai Yunqing said.

“Ah! My apologies, I was going to choose Chu Feng,” the woman said.

“What?” Bai Yunqing froze in place. Why did you walk to me when you were going to choose Chu Feng?

Before Bai Yunqing’s bewildered eyes, the woman bent down and picked up a beautiful heart-shaped stone. Then, she ran over to Chu Feng, passed the heart-shaped stone to him, and said, “Young hero Chu Feng, I really, really like you. I am Lai Tiantian. Just like Elder Lai, I am from the Lai Lineage Tribe. This is my welcome gift to you!”

Bai Yunqing looked as if he had been struck by lightning.

“Chu Feng, I advise you to step down and listen to me,” Bai Yunqing said.

“Why should I?” Chu Feng asked.

Bai Yunqing was rendered speechless. He thought that Chu Feng had bowed down to him, but the situation was going in a different direction from what he had expected. However, this worked in his favor too.

I’ve been wanting to deal with you for a long time now.

“Why should you?” Bai Yunqing sneered. “On the basis that I am Bai Yunqing, and I am stronger than you. Don’t force my hand.”

“Waa, how incredible. Bai Yunqing, have you forgotten about what happened in Lord Zhenlong’s remnant?” Chu Feng asked.

Bai Yunqing’s face immediately paled. “W-what did you say?”

He thought that he had heard wrongly.

“You have been to Lord Zhenlong’s remnant, and you even got yourself covered in feces,” Chu Feng said.

“What?”

The juniors of the Ancient Realm turned to look at Bai Yunqing. They didn’t know what ‘Lord Zhenlong’s remnant’ was, but they were curious to know if he had really gotten covered in feces.

“W-who did you hear that from? Is it the Situ World Spiritist Clan?” Bai Yunqing exclaimed in anger. 

The events that had transpired that day were a grievous humiliation to him, a black stain in his history that he didn’t dare to confront. He had warned the Situ World Spiritist Clan not to divulge the matter, but the news still ended up leaking out.

“Those darned bastards of the Situ World Spiritist Clan!” Bai Yunqing solemnly swore to exact vengeance on the Situ World Spiritist clan. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“The Situ World Spiritist Clan saw it too? Woah, you must have been really embarrassed!” Chu Feng burst into laughter.

“What did you mean by that? You didn’t hear it from the Situ World Spiritist Clan?” Bai Yunqing was confused.

“Of course not,” Chu Feng replied.

“Where did you learn about the matter then?” Bai Yunqing was extremely concerned about this matter.

“I didn’t need to hear it from anyone. That puddle of feces was a trap I laid,” Chu Feng replied.

“What?!” The juniors of the Ancient Realm were shocked. They didn’t think that there would be such a history between Chu Feng and Bai Yunqing. 

Shoosh!

Bai Yunqing pushed the juniors of the Ancient Realm aside with a wave of his sleeves before forming a barrier to isolate him and Chu Feng.

“You were there that day? Do you have evidence of that?” Bai Yunqing asked.

Despite his skepticism, he had already started believing Chu Feng’s story. Of the two rivals he had encountered in Lord Zhenlong’s remnant, one of them went by the word ‘Tiger’ whereas the other went by the word ‘Chu’. It was possible that the person who went by the word ‘Chu’ was Chu Feng. 

“Evidence? Cough cough…” Chu Feng cleared his throat.

He imitated Old Cat’s voice and said, “As long as you hand over all of your treasures and cooperate with me in this ancient remnant from now onward, I promise that I won’t hurt you.”

Then, he imitated Bai Yunqing’s voice and said, “Yes, I’ll cooperate with you! As long as you don’t hurt me, I’ll do whatever you ask me to!”

He finally reverted back to his normal voice and said, “Oh right. I created the feces that splashed on you using spirit power.”

Chu Feng had perfectly reenacted what had happened that day. It was the black history that Bai Yunqing never wanted to be reminded of. 

“Shut your mouth, Chu Feng, or else I’ll slaughter you!” Bai Yunqing threatened angrily. 

Weng!

Chu Feng opened his world spirit gate and released Eggy.

“You little trash. Who are you going to slaughter?” Eggy spat coldly.

Bai Yunqing was initially burning with anger, but when he saw Chu Feng’s world spirit, he suddenly didn’t feel that angry anymore. He could sense Eggy’s cultivation, and that made him want to laugh.

“What do you mean by this, Chu Feng? Are you trying to scare me with a mere rank one Half-God level world spirit?” Bai Yunqing asked.

“Can’t I?” Chu Feng asked.

“Chu Feng, you’re underestimating me. I don’t even have to make a move here. Do you think that you’re the only one with a world spirit here? I’ll show you what a real world spirit is!”

Bai Yunqing opened his world spirit gate and released 23 world spirits. These world spirits had vicious looks on their faces, and every single one of them wielded immense power. Twenty of them were at rank one Half-God level, and the remaining three were at rank two Half-God level. 

Shoosh!

Eggy released a flood of black gaseous flames with a wave of her sleeves. 

Bai Yunqing’s 23 world spirits yelped in pain and collapsed to the ground. All of them had sustained severe injuries. And that was Eggy showing mercy on them. If any of these world spirits had said anything that displeased her, all that would have been left of them was mere corpses.
