Chapter 5960: Jie Tian’s Smile

“Heh...” a sneer echoed.

It was from Jie Tian.

“Chu Feng, this isn’t your turf either. Do you think you have everything under your control?” Jie Tian was staring at Chu Feng with provocative eyes.

Chu Feng sensed that there might be more to the situation than he had expected. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Weng!

A surge of teleportation energy suddenly enveloped Jie Tian. In response, Chu Feng quickly exerted a bizarre suction force—Protection Bane.

Despite his swift reaction, Jie Tian still vanished into thin air.

By the time he reappeared, he was already next to Ling Mouzi.

“It looks like that old coot Jie Tianran has invested heavily in you,” Chu Feng said.

Protection Bane should have been able to unravel any protection formation. Its failure to stop Jie Tian from escaping hinted that it was no ordinary protection formation.

Jie Tian was still covered in the wounds Chu Feng had left on him, but he didn’t rush to seek treatment. His twisted face smoothened out, and he coldly stared at Chu Feng and said, “You should escape now, while you still have the chance to do so.”

“I should?” Chu Feng replied.

“You’re right. This isn’t our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s turf. However, you should know that our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion still has a much greater say than you here. That golden death immunity token of yours will only save you ten times, and you have just expended it twice. If we take turns to attack you another eight more times, your death immunity token will be fully expended. You would have nothing to fight us with,” Jie Tian said.

“Oh? You’re saying that my fate is in your hands?”

“Yes, that’s what I’m saying.”

“Heh... Do you even understand this death immunity token? It’s intended to fend against arrogant fools like you. You don’t have the ability to claim the remnant’s treasure, yet you still guard it like a bunch of bandits. Weaklings of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, I’ll be taking the remnant’s treasure for myself. Try to stop me if you can.”

With that, Chu Feng vanished into thin air.

“Where did he go?”

“His aura vanished.”

“Did he enter the remnant?”

The elders from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion panicked.

On the one hand, what Chu Feng had done with the death immunity token went beyond their expectations. On the other hand, this remnant was of great importance to them right now.

Jie Tian had been in closed-door training when he suddenly received Jie Tianran’s orders to head here and take over Ling Xiao’s death immunity token. Ling Mouzi and the others were also mobilized to support Jie Tian in clearing this remnant.

Jie Tian was dispatched for this mission because there was a limit to how many times the death immunity token could take effect.

Jie Tianran had been monopolizing the elder death immunity token for many years, but he had already depleted its usage. It was the same for Ling Xiao too. Without the death immunity token, it would be no easy feat to clear this remnant.

This was why they had no choice but to mobilize Jie Tian even though he was in closed-door training. Jie Tian, Ling Mouzi, and the others knew that this remnant was of great importance to Jie Tianran.

Yet, Chu Feng suddenly appeared here at this juncture. This unnerved them, as they would be the ones to suffer if Chu Feng took away what Jie Tianran wanted.

In contrast to the panicking elders, Jie Tian was much calmer.

“Let’s go in and take a look. I’d like to see if Chu Feng dares to stay here.”

Jie Tian headed deeper into the hall and entered the spirit formation gate. Ling Mouzi and the others from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion did the same too.

Beyond the spirit formation gate was a formation realm, where they were presented with over three thousand paths. All of the paths stretched for a long distance, making it impossible to tell what was at each of their ends.

The center path was the widest path, but a massive door shaped like a chessboard blocked the path. The people here called it the chess door.

Aside from the center path with the chess door, the other three thousand paths were free to access, but they were fraught with danger.

It was said that there were only two ways to reach the core of the remnant and obtain the treasure here. One was to decipher the chess door, and the other one was to find the right path among the three thousand.

The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion had tried both methods for many years. Some of its clansmen devoted themselves to deciphering the chess door, whereas the others ventured into new paths.

Jie Tian and Ling Mouzi were venturing on a new path earlier, just that Chu Feng snatched away Jie Tian’s death immunity token before they could reach its end, thus unraveling their efforts.

There was a consensus that the only way to clear this trial was to decipher the chess door, but that was no easy feat. Only two people had reached the final trial—one was Jie Tianran, and the other was Jie Ranqing.

But neither of them chose to challenge the final trial.

“It looks like Chu Feng has chosen the chess door.”

Ling Mouzi and the others could tell from the glowing chess door that Chu Feng was challenging it.

The so-called chess door was located in a public space, so anyone could freely enter the area.

This remnant was open to the public, and many world spiritists had devoted themselves to deciphering the chess door. To enter the chess door and challenge its trials, one had to first solve the entrance puzzle.

The glowing chess door was a sign that a first-timer was attempting to enter the chess door.

Kacha!

Soon, the chess door opened, revealing a path leading deep into the remnant. This path was much wider than the other three thousand paths, and it gave off a different aura too.

“That’s fast!”

The elders from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion had awful looks on their faces.

Jie Ranqing had been the record holder for the shortest time taken to open the chess door, but Chu Feng had just broken her record. This gave them an ominous feeling.

Chu Feng’s feats had been incredible thus far, so they couldn’t help but worry that he might obtain the treasure inside the remnant. They would be severely punished if that were to happen.

The chess door was a public space, so they could try to intercept him, but the problem was that they couldn’t even see Chu Feng now due to the death immunity token. That put them in a spot.

“Heh...” Jie Tian suddenly burst into laughter.

“Young master Jie Tian?”

The elders were confused.
