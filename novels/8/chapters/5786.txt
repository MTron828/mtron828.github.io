Chapter 5786: Xian Miaomiao’s Prowess

“Seal!” Huangfu Shengyu suddenly roared while forming a hand seal directed at Chu Feng.

Another word appeared on the token on his chest—'Seal'.

A ray of light shot out from the token and struck Chu Feng. It was so fast that he had no hope of dodging it at all; it penetrated him before he noticed it. However, this strike didn’t hurt him in any way, but he immediately sensed the power of the Asura King dissipating.

He was reverting to his original cultivation level.

“This feeling… Could it be?” Chu Feng was appalled.

“Do you sense it? My trump card does more than grant me the cultivation of rank one True God level. Do you finally understand how formidable it is?” Huangfu Shengyu sneered.

“You bound the power of my world spirit instead of my martial power. It looks like your trump card has reached its limit,” Chu Feng said.

“Yes, it has reached its limit, but you don’t stand a chance against me without your world spirit’s power to fall back on,” Huangfu Shengyu said.

Chu Feng noticed that the invisible armor had dissipated while Huangfu Shengyu was speaking. That explained why the latter was anxious to squeeze out the remaining energy in his token to seal the Asura King’s power. He knew he would be helpless before Chu Feng’s swift assaults as soon as his invisible armor was gone.

“Huangfu Shengyu, I concede that your trump card is formidable. Are you willing to uphold your promise? Will you spare the others if I extract the Genesis Bloodline from my body?” Chu Feng asked.

“You mustn’t, Chu Feng!”

“No, big brother!”

Xian Miaomiao, Little Fishy, and the others were vehemently opposed to it. They would rather die with Chu Feng than let him sacrifice himself for them.

“Don’t be foolish, Brother Chu Feng. You have already defeated him earlier, just that the token saved his life. Besides, that man has no credibility to speak of!” Xianhai Shaoyu said.

Tzlala!

With a streak of lightning, Chu Feng suddenly vanished into thin air and appeared behind Huangfu Shengyu once more. He had already activated his Lightning Mark, Lightning Armor, and Lightning Wings, raising his cultivation to rank eight Half-God level, though his true fighting prowess was on par with rank nine Half-God level cultivators.

With his current cultivation level and Divine Flitting, he could indeed move at a speed faster than rank one True God level cultivators, allowing him to sneak behind Huangfu Shengyu without the latter noticing.Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

However, he was unable to plunge his sword into Huangfu Shengyu, as the latter was protected by his True God level martial power.

“This isn’t enough?” Chu Feng sighed.

He was intending to distract Huangfu Shengyu and launch a surprise attack, but the latter had learned his lesson and wrapped his martial power around him. This wouldn’t have been enough to block the attack of a rank one True God level cultivator, but it was sufficient to deal with a Half-God level cultivator.

“You bastard!”

Huangfu Shengyu reached out to grab Chu Feng, but the latter vanished once more and reappeared in the far distance.

“He’s still able to move at such speeds despite regressing to Half-God level?”

Xianhai Shaoyu and the others were stunned. They didn’t think he could still move at such terrifying speeds even as a rank eight Half-God level cultivator. Chu Feng could have easily escaped from Huangfu Shengyu, if not for the fact that this place was sealed off.

Boom!

Huangfu Shengyu exerted his oppressive might on his surroundings.

Chu Feng, despite his incredible speed, was unable to dodge the oppressive might due to the limited space he could maneuver in. He was struck by the oppressive might and pinned against the wall.

“Chu Feng!” Little Fishy, Xian Miaomiao, Xianhai Shaoyu, and the others quickly rushed to Chu Feng’s side.

“I’m fine,” Chu Feng replied. He turned inward and called out, “Elder Divine Deer?”

“You’ll have to rely on yourself here,” the Divine Deer replied.

“You still haven’t recovered yet?” Chu Feng asked in resignation.

“What do you mean by ‘still’? It hasn’t been long since I last saved you!” the Divine Deer exclaimed.

“…” Chu Feng couldn’t refute that. It was just that too many things had happened in recent days that it felt like a long time had passed. He turned to his other ace. “Heaven-devouring Qilin?”

He figured that the Heaven-devouring Qilin, as a god beast, might have extraordinary means, but the latter didn’t respond to him.

“I gave you a chance, Chu Feng, but you didn’t know how to reciprocate. Very well… they shall die together with you!” Huangfu Shengyu exerted his oppressive might with a murderous aura, revealing his intention to kill everyone present.

Boom!

A person stepped forward and stopped the oppressive might. The crowd was taken aback.

It was Xian Miaomiao! Her current cultivation was rank nine Half-God level.

“Has she been concealing her cultivation?” Qin Xuan and Long Chengyu were stunned.

Xian Miaomiao had previously revealed her strength in her fight against Huangfu Fanni. With her base cultivation of rank five Half-God level, she was only able to raise her cultivation up to rank eight Half-God level. Yet, her cultivation was at rank nine Half-God level right now.

This meant that she had been concealing her means.

Even so, this was already her limit. While it was a formidable feat for a junior to be able to match a rank nine Half-God level cultivator, that shouldn’t have been enough for her to block the attack of a rank one True God level cultivator.

Boom!

The ancient hall shook. Even the purple aura sealing the ancient hall started squirming.

It was a phenomenon similar to that when the Genesis Bloodline first appeared earlier. It felt like something terrifying had appeared in the ancient hall.

A green aura surfaced from Xian Miaomiao’s body, drawing everyone’s attention. The green aura was the culprit that had blocked Huangfu Shengyu’s oppressive might and induced the anomaly in the ancient hall.

“Soul Fog! It’s the Soul Fog! Hahaha! I never thought that I’d stumble upon the Genesis Bloodline and the Soul Fog on the very same day!” Huangfu Shengyu burst into laughter.
