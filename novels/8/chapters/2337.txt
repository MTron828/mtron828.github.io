Chapter 2337 - Ruthless Character

“Who is it?!”

“Did someone come to save us?”

At that moment, the crowd from the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall were filled with questions. One by one, they raised their heads and looked toward the sky.

They all wanted to see exactly who it was that was capable of suppressing Daoist Gold Star and saving them.

“It’s him?”

Upon looking, practically everyone present was struck dumb and astonishment filled their eyes.

The reason for that was because the person who came was not someone that they had anticipated. The reason for that was because he was not an expert from the Sunset Cloud Valley or the Three Stars Hall. Instead, it was someone that was completely unexpected.

The reason for that was because the person that came to save them was none other than Chu Feng.

It was not only Chu Feng. Beside him was a crystal giant. The aura of that crystal giant was extremely powerful. No one present was able to see through its cultivation. However, without a doubt, that crystal giant possessed strength capable of suppressing Daoist Gold Star, that grand rank six Martial Ancestor.

Even though the crystal giant was the one that was suppressing Daoist Gold Star, the crowd’s focus was still placed on Chu Feng.

The reason for that was because regardless of how mighty, how powerful and how unfathomable that crystal giant might be, it appeared more like a puppet, a guard.

As for its master, it would be Chu Feng. Thus... the crowd felt that the person that had saved them was Chu Feng.

“Chu Feng, you actually dare to show yourself.”

“Very well, you have come at the perfect time. You have saved me time to search for you,” Although Daoist Gold Star was astonished by Chu Feng’s appearance, he immediately gnashed his teeth furiously and revealed a sinister expression. He had completely manifested the hatred he felt towards Chu Feng.

He felt enormous resentment and hatred toward Chu Feng. After all, Chu Feng, a member of the younger generation, had actually defeated him in terms of world spirit techniques. This completely ruined his reputation. As such, he could not tolerate Chu Feng.

“Daoist Gold Star, no matter what, you could be considered to be a somewhat prestigious individual in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. Never would I have expected that you are actually such a narrow-minded and petty man,” Chu Feng mocked.

“Narrow-minded and petty? You actually dare to declare that I am narrow-minded and petty?! Do you not remember what you all did to me in the Sunset Cloud Valley?!” Daoist Gold Star said with deep resentment.

“What happened in the Sunset Cloud Valley was but a trifling matter. Yet, for the sake of that trifling matter, you have decided to join forces with the Ying Heavenly Clan to attack the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall.”

“Furthermore, you were the one who was being unreasonable back then. Yet, the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall did not do anything to you. However, now you want to bring about their deaths. Tell me, are you not a narrow-minded and petty man?”

“I know that the reason why you did all this is actually all because of your hatred toward me. However, since you hate me, you could very well have come and searched for me. There was no need for you to attack the people from the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall, no? After all, they are innocent,” Chu Feng mocked.

“Enough of your bullshit. Today, all of you will die!” Daoist Goldstar was completely furious. He did not want to bother speaking rubbish with Chu Feng. With a flip of his wrist, he revealed an Incomplete Ancestral Armament. Then, he pointed his weapon toward Chu Feng.

“Boom~~~”

“Roar~~~”

Martial power surged forth, bringing about a strong wind. A dragon-like ferocious beast appeared from the surging martial power. It opened its mouth wide and revealed its sharp fangs as it charged toward Chu Feng.

Once that beast appeared, the weather immediately changed. An unstoppable force soon engulfed the entire region.

That was no ordinary beast. Rather, it was an Emperor Taboo Martial Skill.

Daoist Gold Star seemed to have realized that the crystal giant beside Chu Feng was no small matter. Thus, he did not act carelessly, and unleashed his trump card from the get-go.

After Daoist Gold Star unleashed an Emperor Taboo Martial Skill using his Incomplete Ancestral Armament, the crowd from the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall all grew extremely nervous.

The reason for that was because the might of that ferocious beast was truly frightening. They were all scared that Chu Feng would not be able to handle it.

“Boom~~~”

However, right at that moment, the crystal giant beside Chu Feng slowly raised its arm. Then, it shot forth a punch.

Although that punch appeared to be powerless, it caused heaven and earth to tremble violently the moment it was shot forth. In a split second, that ferocious beast formed by the Emperor Taboo Martial Skill was shattered to pieces.

“This?!!!”

At that moment, the crowd from the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall discovered that they had been worrying for nothing.

Chu Feng’s crystal giant was too powerful. At the moment that crystal giant attacked, the crowd realized that no matter how strong Daoist Gold Star might be, he would not be able to injure Chu Feng in the slightest. The reason for that was because the strength of that crystal giant most definitely surpassed Daoist Gold Star.

“Why would such a powerful existence appear beside Chu Feng?”

“Exactly what sort of origin does that Chu Feng possess?”

The might of the crystal giant made the crowd realize with greater certainty that Chu Feng’s origin was no small matter. Likely, he possessed an enormous background. Else, how could such a powerful existence protect him like a bodyguard?

At that moment, in terms of feeling the most complicated, it would be none other than a disciple from the Sunset Cloud Valley.

This person was called Jiang Hao. This Jiang Hao was someone who was fond of Xu Yiyi. Due to the fact that Xu Yiyi treated Chu Feng very well, he had tried to deliberately make things difficult for Chu Feng on Mount Cloud Crane, and had even thought about killing Chu Feng.

At that time, he felt that Chu Feng was only a minor character. Thus, he naturally did not take him to heart.

However, as matters stood, he now had no choice but to reevaluate Chu Feng.

In fact, he had already grown a bit scared. He had realized that Chu Feng was not a minor character. Rather, Chu Feng was a grand character that he could not afford to offend.

When recalling all the things he had done to Chu Feng back then, how could he not be scared?

“Damn it!”

Just when the crowd were pondering Chu Feng’s origin, Daoist Gold Star turned around and began to flee. At the same time, the people from the Ying Heavenly Clan also did not dare to stay any longer.

One by one, they either entered into the void, dug underground or flew into the sky. They were using all sorts of methods to escape from that place.

“Buzz~~~”

The eyes of that crystal giant flickered with a red light. Then, an invisible ripple began to spread.

“Aiyoh!”

“Heavens!”

The very next moment, regardless of whether it was Daoist Gold Star or the crowd from the Ying Heavenly Clan, they were all brought back to their original locations. Merely, at that moment, they were no longer standing.Instead they were all lying on their stomachs.

“You all wanted to escape now that you failed to kill others? Is there such an easy thing in this world?” Chu Feng looked to the crowd lying on the ground and spoke with a light smile.

“Chu Feng, what are you planning to do?!” Daoist Gold Star and the crowd from the Ying Heavenly Clan shouted in unison.

“What do I plan to do? Naturally, to kill you all,” Chu Feng said.

“You dare?!!!” Daoist Gold Star and the crowd from the Ying Heavenly Clan shouted in unison again.

“Heh...” Chu Feng laughed. Then, he said, “You all will come to know whether or not I dare.”

“Bang~~~”

“Bang~~~”

“Bang~~~”

“Bang~~~”

............

Right after Chu Feng said those words, muffled explosions began to be heard in rapid succession. As the muffled explosions resonated, Daoist Gold Star and the people from the Ying Heavenly Clan all exploded and turned into puddles of blood.

Chu Feng extended his hand and made a grabbing motion, causing Daoist Gold Star’s as well as the Ying Heavenly Clan’s Clansmen’s Cosmos Sacks to all enter his grasp. He then placed them into his own Cosmos Sack.

Then, he looked down, and discovered that the reactions from the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall’s elders were relatively fine. However, the disciples were somewhat scared.

They were scared not because they had not yet emerged from the time when their lives were in the hands of Daoist Gold Star. Rather, it was most likely because Chu Feng was able to so effortlessly kill Daoist Gold Star and the many people from the Ying Heavenly Clan. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

After all, no matter what, those were over a thousand lives. Furthermore, many among them were people of the older generation that had cultivated for many years.

Thus, even though they all felt that those people deserved to die, they still involuntarily began to feel reverence and fear toward Chu Feng. After all, only truly ruthless characters were capable of actually killing those people.

Without a doubt, Chu Feng had become one such ruthless character in their hearts.

The ruthlessness that he possessed was not something that they, fellow members of the younger generation, possessed.
