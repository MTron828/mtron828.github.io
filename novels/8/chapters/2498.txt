Chapter 2498 - Chu Feng’s Victory

“I’ll kill you!”

Young Master Li Ming’s face turned a deep red. With overwhelming killing intent, she charged toward Chu Feng.

Her appearance was not only that of someone who wanted to kill Chu Feng. Instead, she simply wanted to dismember Chu Feng’s body into ten thousand pieces.

While dodging Li Ming’s attack, Chu Feng started to ridicule Li Ming with a smile on his face, “Hey hey hey, what are you doing? It was clearly stated that we were only sparring, since when did we start trying to kill each other?”

“Oh, I get it now. Isn’t it just because I accidentally touched you? You can’t blame me for that. After all, it’s your fault for dressing up as a man.”

“If I had known that you were a woman to begin with, I would’ve never touched you there. Thus, you cannot blame me for this. If you want to blame someone, you can only blame yourself.”

“Say, why would you, a little beauty, dress up as a man? Could it be...”

As Chu Feng spoke, his gaze grew a bit more provocative. He said, “Could it be that you have some sort of special interest? You couldn’t possibly also be fond of women, right?”

“I’ll tear your mouth apart!!!”

Young Master Li Ming started to gnash her teeth in anger. Her charming red lips seemed to be spraying out fire as she spoke.

She began to rush toward Chu Feng to attack him nonstop. Not only were all her attacks fatal in nature, her killing intent was also extremely dreadful.

She was not playing around. She was truly trying to kill Chu Feng.

“Aiyayaya, this is bad. Not only was Li Ming’s identity as a woman seen through by Chu Feng, she was also taken advantage of by him.”

“With Li Ming’s temperament, she might really end up killing Chu Feng. Golden Crane, should we act to stop her?” The plain-clothed old monk asked.

“This match is still not over yet. Furthermore, Li Ming’s cultivation has been restricted by me. She is only able to use the power she has obtained from the Profound Light Pillar.”

“Even if she has truly decided to kill, she will not be able to kill the current Chu Feng. Even if an accident is to truly occur, I will definitely act immediately. Thus, you don’t have to worry about Chu Feng’s safety,” The Golden Crane True Immortal said.

“This place is, after all, your territory. Thus, you’ll handle the things here. As for me, my job is to enjoy the show,” The plain-clothed old monk said with a beaming smile.

“There’s actually nothing worth seeing. The outcome of this match has been decided already. Earlier, Li Ming was pretending to be enraged by Chu Feng. However, it’s different now.”

“After Chu Feng touched her taboo, she was truly enraged by him. On top of that, Chu Feng has said those provocative words. Thus, Li Ming is already completely enraged by him.”

“Such a Li Ming is already no longer able to continue to contend against Chu Feng. Soon, Chu Feng will obtain victory,” The Golden Crane True Immortal said.

“Indeed. That child Chu Feng is truly crafty. He was actually willing to take advantage of even such a thing. He has completely utilized Li Ming’s fury after having taking advantage of her.”

“However, to be honest, I am truly growing more and more fond of this boy Chu Feng,” The plain-clothed old monk said.

“I am the same,” The Golden Crane True Immortal revealed a faint smile on his face.

They did not look down on Chu Feng for his shamelessness. On the contrary, they both appreciated Chu Feng’s quick-wittedness, and his ability to change according to the situation.

“In that case, why not just take him as your disciple?”

“If you are to protect him, who in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm would dare to bully him?” The plain-clothed old monk asked. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“It does seem that in all aspects, Chu Feng is superior to Li Ming. However, I am someone who will always finish what I have started. Since I have already decided that I want Li Ming to be my disciple, I will not go and take another person as my disciple.”

“Furthermore, no matter how talented one might be, they must still be nurtured. While Chu Feng’s display of performance is currently excellent, that does not mean that he will continue to be this outstanding. It might even be possible for Li Ming to surpass him.”

“In short, between the two of them, I am still more optimistic about Li Ming,” The Golden Crane True Immortal said.

“Is that so?” The plain-clothed old monk smiled faintly. However, contained within his eyes was a clear expression of disbelief.

He knew that it was actually due to another reason that the Golden Crane True Immortal did not wish to take Chu Feng as his disciple.

Meanwhile, Li Ming was running around the formation, chasing after Chu Feng and attacking him.

As for Chu Feng, he was merely running without fighting back.

At that moment, the location Chu Feng was running toward was already less than a meter away from Li Ming’s Profound Light Pillar. He extended his hand and grabbed the Profound Light Pillar.

“Taa~~~”

After grabbing the Profound Light Pillar, Chu Feng suddenly stopped and turned around. With a smile on his face, he said to Young Master Li Ming, who was chasing after him, “Lil’ Sis Li Ming, in a match, one must accept one’s losses; I have won.”

“I’ll kill you!!!”

Seeing that Chu Feng was holding the Profound Light Pillar in his hand, Young Master Li Ming realized that she had been made a fool of by Chu Feng again. Thus, at that moment, she was even more furious than before. She was truly determined to kill Chu Feng.

“Buzz~~~”

However, right at the moment when Li Ming rushed toward Chu Feng to kill him, right when she was about to reach Chu Feng, an enormous power suddenly appeared out of nowhere, restricting her movements.

The current Li Ming was no longer able to move in the slightest.

“Buzz~~~”

The next moment, a figure appeared out of thin air. That person appeared in the center of the formation. He was none other than the Golden Crane True Immortal.

“Li Ming, you must be able to accept your loss. Chu Feng has won this match,” The Golden Crane True Immortal said.

“Damn it! Let me go, I’ll kill him!” Evidently, Young Master Li Ming had yet to break free from her anger. She was still shouting angrily.

“Li Ming, this place is my territory. I will not allow you to behave atrociously here.”

“You have lost this match. As such, I will not help you.”

“However, I will give you an opportunity. Even though you’ve lost today, if you are willing to become my disciple, I will definitely help you,” The Golden Crane True Immortal said to Li Ming.

“If you are to release me now, return my cultivation and allow me to kill this Chu Feng, I will consider becoming your disciple,” Young Master Li Ming said to the Golden Crane True Immortal.

“I’m afraid that won’t do. You should consider what I said first,” The Golden Crane True Immortal smiled lightly. Then, he gently raised his arm, and a strand of light flew out of his palm. That light enveloped Young Master Li Ming.

“Buzz~~~”

The next moment, that Young Master Li Ming disappeared into thin air. She had left that place.

Likely, she had been sent out of Mount Cloud Crane by the Golden Crane True Immortal.

“Junior Chu Feng pays his respects to senior.”

As for Chu Feng, he bowed respectfully to the Golden Crane True Immortal.

After all, this was the first time he had seen the Golden Crane True Immortal’s actual appearance.

After seeing him, Chu Feng became even more certain that Golden Crane True Immortal was an otherworldly expert.

Even though Chu Feng was unable to see through the cultivation of the Golden Crane True Immortal, the ruler-like aura that he emitted made it clear that he was no ordinary martial cultivator.

“Follow me,” As the Golden Crane True Immortal spoke, he turned around and waved his sleeve.

“Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~”

Chu Feng felt that the scenery surrounding him started to change rapidly.

He was unable to clearly see anything. The only thing he was able to see was the Golden Crane True Immortal’s back.

The Golden Crane True Immortal was ahead, leading the way for Chu Feng.

Finally, the scenery surrounding Chu Feng started to clear up.

“That is?”

As Chu Feng saw the things before him, his eyes shrunk, and his expression changed.
