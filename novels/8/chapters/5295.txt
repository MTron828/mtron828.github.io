Chapter 5295: Chu Feng Dares Not Come?

Instead of digging up the graves, Chu Feng made his way toward a tomb that stood out even amidst the surrounding extravagance. It was so well-adorned that one could mistake it for a majestic palace.

The tombstone erected in front of it towered at a height of over a hundred thousand meters, piercing through the clouds. It was made out of the finest jade in the world. Carved on it were the words: Tomb of the Situ World Spiritist Clan’s Founder.

Chu Feng didn’t bother heading into the massive tomb. He knew that its extravagance was just a facade, and the tomb was actually empty inside. Instead, he placed his hand on the massive tombstone and infused his spirit power in it.

A spirit formation gate soon floated out from the tombstone.

“There’s a hidden mechanism here?” Eggy was surprised.

“The aura that Situ Kunye emanates originates from here. My guess is that he has been in closed-door training here to grasp control over the clan formation left behind by his ancestors,” Chu Feng said.

He took out his Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk.

“The Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk hasn’t been reacting recently, but it has been pulsating ever since I stepped foot into the Situ World Spiritist Clan. For some reason, I know that it’ll lend me its strength this time despite having ignored my pleas many times before,” Chu Feng said.

He channeled his spirit power into the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk, and the latter correspondingly unleashed a torrent of energy into the spirit formation gate. Soon, the spirit formation gate started to undergo changes.

Chu Feng smiled at that sight.

The spirit formation gate only granted access to only those who carried the Situ World Spiritist Clan’s bloodline. Its restriction was even stricter than that of the Spirit Beast Mountain Range, such that impersonating a Situ World Spiritist Clansman wouldn’t work either.

Under normal circumstances, Chu Feng wouldn’t have been able to enter the spirit formation gate. However, through the deception of the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk, he was able to pull off the impossible.

The first thing Chu Feng saw upon stepping into the spirit formation gate were three massive formations with a monument erected in front of each of them. These monuments carried the words ‘Offense’, ‘Defense’, and ‘Cultivate’ respectively.

The ‘Offense’ formation was the strongest one, followed by ‘Defense’, and finally ‘Cultivate’. Yet, the most peculiar one of all was none other than the ‘Cultivate’ formation.

Chu Feng could discern the effects of three formations with a single glance.

The ‘Offense’ formation referred to assault formations. Those who grasped this formation would be able to use its power to exert strength greater than what they were currently capable of.

Situ Kunye had only been able to suppress Yue Lian earlier thanks to this ‘Offense’ formation. It was just that he hadn’t grasped much of it, so he wasn’t able to raise his fighting prowess by too much.

The ‘Defense’ formation referred to protection formations. This formation should have been extremely powerful, but it had been greatly weakened, possibly because the Situ World Spiritist Clan had used it too many times. As a result, it didn’t have much energy left in it.

Needless to say, the ‘Cultivation’ formation was used for cultivation purposes. It used to be the strongest of the three formations, but it had been used incorrectly so many times that it didn’t have much energy left in it either.

Chu Feng could grasp control of the ‘Offense’ formation and ‘Defense’ formation with the help of the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk, but the ‘Cultivation’ formation could only be used by the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen.

Of course, he could fool the ‘Cultivation’ formation into providing him with its energy, but he wouldn’t be able to benefit from it due to bloodline incompatibility. Besides, there wasn’t much energy left inside the formation anyway.

So, Chu Feng focused his attention on the ‘Offense’ and ‘Defense’ formations.

Even though the energies in the two formations were running out, if he fully grasped the ‘Defense’ formation, he would be able to protect himself for an hour even if the opponent was a True God level cultivator.

Similarly, if he fully grasped the ‘Offense’ formation and used it in a single burst, he would be able to exert strength comparable to a pinnacle Half-God level cultivator. In fact, if he possessed the Situ World Spiritist Clan’s bloodline, he might even be able to exert might comparable to a True God level cultivator.

This showed just how formidable the ancestors of the Situ World Spiritist Clan were.

The strength of a pinnacle Half-God level cultivator was more than enough to destroy the Situ World Spiritist Clan.

“Not only am I going to dig up the ancestral grave of the Situ World Spiritist Clan, but I’m also going to use their power to destroy them!” Chu Feng finally allowed his face to glower in anger.

He first channeled the power of the Celestial Master’s Horsetail to deal with the ‘Defense’ formation. It didn’t take long for him to siphon away the energy from the ‘Defense’ formation.

“You succeeded?” Eggy was surprised at how fast Chu Feng grasped control over the ‘Defense’ formation.

While the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk had helped Chu Feng to beguile the formation, the speed at which he grasped the formation was still dependent on his own talent.

“I am Lord Qin Jiu’s successor. I’d be a disgrace if I stumbled over a formation of this caliber,” Chu Feng replied matter-of-factly.

These formations were left behind by the ancestors of the Situ World Spiritist Clan to test their intelligence, and that happened to be a trait that Chu Feng was confident of.

Now that he had grasped control of the ‘Defense’ formation, he turned his sights toward the ‘Offense’ formation. However, instead of attempting to grasp control of it, he tried to shift the entire formation away.

“What are you doing, Chu Feng?”

Eggy couldn’t understand why Chu Feng was wasting his strength to shift the ‘Offense’ formation when he could simply grasp control of it.

“Situ Kunye lured everyone from the True Dragon Starfield over to embarrass me. Since that’s the case, I’ll grasp control over his ancestor’s formation before everyone’s eyes to show just how incompetent their Situ World Spiritist Clan is,” Chu Feng said.

“What a despicable plan, but I like it.” Eggy was satisfied with Chu Feng’s idea.

Moving a formation was usually no easy feat, but not to Chu Feng. As someone who had inherited Lord Qin Jiu’s heritage, he was capable of means that even world spiritists far stronger than him were incapable of. It didn’t take him long to stow away the ‘Offense’ formation.

Of course, these formations were powered by this hall, meaning that he couldn’t shift it too far away, or else they would lose their effects. In other words, he could only exert the prowess of the formations inside the Situ World Spiritist Clan.

That was exactly what Chu Feng was going to do, so this restriction meant nothing to him.

After grasping the ‘Defense’ formation and lifting up the ‘Offense’ formation, Chu Feng began making his way out of the hall.

“Chu Feng, destroy that ‘Cultivate’ formation,” Eggy said.

Chu Feng shot a glance at that ‘Cultivate’ formation.

“There’s no need to waste our time on that. There isn’t much energy left inside that formation, and it’s not as if the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen will get a chance to use it,” Chu Feng said before leaving through the spirit formation gate.

Returning to the ancestral graveyard, Chu Feng began unearthing the remains of the Situ World Spiritist Clan’s ancestors. Many of them still retained their origin energies, and Chu Feng fed them all to Eggy.

Eggy’s cultivation quickly rose to rank nine Martial Exalted level. She said that with a bit of cultivation, she should be able to reach Half-God level very soon.

“What a pity that the remains of the Situ World Spiritist Clan’s founder aren’t here. I’d have benefited greatly from his origin energies,” Eggy remarked lamentably.

“His origin energies are here, but it’s infused into the ‘Cultivate’ formation. It’s just that it has been sapped dry by now,” Chu Feng said.

“Ah? The ‘Cultivate’ formation was formed out of the remains of the Situ World Spiritist Clan’s founder?” Eggy was surprised.

“I think so. I can sense their founder’s aura inside the ‘Cultivate’ formation. Their founder was willing to go to such lengths to further the prosperity of the Situ World Spiritist Clan, but his descendants were too dumb. At least nine-tenths of the energy inside the ‘Cultivate’ formation went to waste. They didn’t even manage to harness a tenth of the formation’s potency,” Chu Feng said.

“It looks like the founder of the Situ World Spiritist Clan was a noble man. He was willing to sacrifice his body to squeeze out every last bit of value he could leave to his descendants. It is a pity that his descendants are inept,” Eggy agreed.

If the founder was still alive and saw how inept and vile his descendants were, he would have probably slaughtered them with his own hands.

“I understand now why you’re reluctant to destroy that ‘Cultivate’ formation.”

Eggy knew that Chu Feng was the type of person who drew a clear line when it came to his enmity. He wouldn’t let his enemies off the hook, but neither would he implicate others in his vengeance. As much as he hated the Situ World Spiritist Clan, he still harbored respect for its founder.

Chu Feng didn’t refute Eggy’s words.

…

Situ Kunye was oblivious to what Chu Feng had done. He should have been able to detect it since he was linked to those formations too, but the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk had obscured his detection.

Due to that, Situ Kunye didn’t know how close he was to danger. He was still naively immersed in his glee from having subdued Yue Lian.

He lead the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen to the headquarters’ entrance, where a crowd had gathered, and announced, “All of you should be aware of the conflict we had with the Golden Dragon Flame Sect back then, so I, Situ Kunye, shan’t waste my breath talking about it.

“Chu Feng sees himself as a warrior of justice, but he doesn’t seem to understand that strength is the foundation to upholding justice. He mentioned that he wants to exact vengeance for his grandmother and the Golden Dragon Flame Sect.

“Very well, I’ll give him a chance to do that. I shall stand here together with the entire Situ World Spiritist Clan to await his arrival. I dare him to come here, but I doubt that he even has the guts to do so. He sure was courageous when he took advantage of the weaker ones in our Situ World Spiritist Clan, but does he dare to face me in person?

“Let it be known that I’ll wait for him here for a month. If he doesn’t come within a month’s time, I’ll be the one to hunt him down. He’ll join the corpses of the Golden Dragon Flame Sect hanging at our entrance.” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Situ Kunye’s words were domineering. He practically admitted to the tyranny his clan had committed back then, not even bothering to weave an excuse for it. Yet, no one was able to do anything about him.

This was a cruel world that spoke with strength, not with words. Should Chu Feng seek vengeance, the outcome awaiting him was death.

The crowd felt a crushing pressure weighing down their chests. They could tell that Situ Kunye was an even more frightening individual than Situ Tingye, and they would have to live under this person’s shadows for many years to come.

Those who were sitting on the fence raised their hands and cheered aloud for the Situ World Spiritist Clan, proclaiming their undying loyalty.

“The ones who will die are not me but your Situ World Spiritist Clansmen.”

Chu Feng suddenly appeared right in front of Situ Kunye. He was standing alone against the entire Situ World Spiritist Clan, but there was no fear in his eyes.

“Chu Feng?”

“He really came?!”

The crowd was bewildered. They didn’t think that Chu Feng would actually come. However, what happened next furthered their shock.

Chu Feng waved his sleeves and scattered countless bones and tombstones all around him. The bones might not be recognizable, but the same couldn’t be said about the tombstones. They clearly belonged to the ancestors of the Situ World Spiritist Clan.

Chu Feng had not only come to confront Situ Kunye, but he had even dug up the Situ World Spiritist Clan’s ancestral grave!
