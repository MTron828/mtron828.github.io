Chapter 3564 - Clan Chief’s Aura

Suddenly, Chu Feng’s body started to sink.

At that moment, Chu Feng’s surroundings began to change.

He felt as if he had entered a boundless world.

His surroundings had turned pitch-black. He was unable to see a trace of light at all. However, he was able to sense its vastness.

What filled this vast world was not martial power or spirit power. Instead, it was a power that Chu Feng had never felt before.

He suspected that it must be the power of the Sacred Tree.

The reason for that was because he was capable of sensing an enormous tree. Even though that enormous tree did not appear before him, and he was unable to see it with his eyes, he was capable of sensing it. That tree was so enormous that it simply filled this entire world. It was hidden in this world, dictating things from the shadows.

Even though the feeling Chu Feng had was a similar feeling to imagining something, it had allowed him to realize that the power of the Void Sacred Tree might be powerful to a degree of boundlessness.

This sort of sensation lasted for only an instant. Soon, Chu Feng’s awareness returned to normal.

When his awareness returned to reality, a piece of information appeared in his mind.

It was information regarding the Sacred Palace Hall.

Indeed, one must refine the souls of others in order to open the entrance to the Sacred Palace Hall.

As for the formation capable of refining the souls, one could summon it using the pendant.

That said, a total of nine million nine hundred and ninety thousand people must be tossed into the refining formation in order to open the gate.

It must be said that this was a very cruel and ruthless method.

Fortunately, refining people’s souls in order to open the gate to the Sacred Palace Hall was not the only method.

There was another method apart from that. Merely, that method was rather complicated.

Compared to the alternative, it was indeed easier to capture over nine million people and toss them into the formation to refine their souls.

“Right, there’s another question. Do you know of Wang Qiang?” Chu Feng asked Zhang Yanfeng.

“Are you talking about the person who appeared in the Void Sacred Tree when it was still closed and left ‘Daddy Wang Qiang was here,’ that Wang Qiang?” asked Zhang Yanfeng.

“Right,” said Chu Feng.

“I’ve heard of that matter, but I do not know of him. I have told you practically all of our knowledge of the Void Sacred Tree.”

“Furthermore, you should also be able to control the power of this place now,” Zhang Yanfeng said.

“Mn,” Chu Feng nodded.

Indeed, he was able to control the power of the Void Sacred Tree in this special region through the use of the pendant. However, this power differed greatly from the power that he had sensed.

The power that he had sensed was simply boundless and inexhaustible.

However, the power that he could currently make use of was very limited. It would be simply be akin to the tip of an iceberg.

That said, even though the power was limited, it was still extremely exceptional.

Unless one was an Utmost Exalted expert... the power that Chu Feng possessed could be said to be of absolute dominance.

“Can you release my sister now?” asked Zhang Yanfeng.

“Of course,” as Chu Feng spoke, he released Zhang Shirui.

Zhang Shirui hurriedly ran behind Zhang Yanfeng.

It was not only her. All of the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen were standing behind Zhang Yanfeng.

“I have honored my promise, no?” Chu Feng asked.

“What do you mean by that? Are you planning to go back on your word?” Hearing those words, Zhang Yanfeng immediately narrowed his brows. He realized that Chu Feng might have something else in mind.

“Going back on my word? No no no.”

“I, Chu Feng, always keep my promises. How could I go back on my word?”

“I said that I would spare you. However, I never said that I would never do anything to you for the rest of my life. If I said that... wouldn’t it mean that I, Chu Feng, would not be able to fight back should you decide to attack me?”

“Just then, I had spared you all once. As such, I have kept my promise.”

“That said, considering current affairs, I’m afraid that I will have to capture you all again.”

As Chu Feng spoke, he held the pendant with his hand. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Suddenly, enormously powerful gaseous flames appeared out of thin air.

After the gaseous flames appeared, they turned into an enormous cage and imprisoned Zhang Yanfeng, Zhang Boyi, Zhang Shirui and all of the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen present.

“Chu Feng, you are shameless and despicable! You are unworthy of being Chu Xuanyuan’s son!”

“You have dishonored Lord Chu Xuanyuan’s reputation!”

“You are simply scum! An animal! You are a vile little man from head to toe!!!”

Seeing their clansmen all being imprisoned, Zhang Yanfeng and the others all turned deathly white with anger. They even went so far as to curse Chu Feng out.

However, Chu Feng simply ignored those curses.

With a very calm and undisturbed tone, he said, “I, Chu Feng, never said that I was some sort of upright gentleman. Furthermore, never did I say that I want to be one.”

“I only wish to protect the people that I care about. That’s all.”

“Right now, many of my clansmen are still out there and being captured by your Blood-devouring Demon Clan. How could I, Chu Feng, let you all go?”

“However, be at ease. When settling disputes, one should not involve third parties. You all are merely my bargaining chips. I will not harm you. Unless... your clansmen decide to harm my friends and family.”

After he finished saying those words, with a thought from Chu Feng, the enormous cage instantly shrunk to the size of a palm and floated into Chu Feng’s hand.

Zhang Yanfeng and the others were still inside the cage and still cursing Chu Feng. However, due to the fact that their powers were restricted by Chu Feng, their voices were also cut off from his ears.

After taking care of Zhang Yanfeng and the others, Chu Feng naturally released all of the captives.

“Chu Feng, those Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen have committed all sorts of evils. You should not keep them alive. It’s better to kill them directly.”

After being rescued by Chu Feng, many Chu Heavenly Clansmen tried to earnestly persuade him to kill the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen.

“I will decide whether to kill them or not. Seniors, you all need not interfere in this matter. Or else... with the temperament that I, Chu Feng, possess, you should know that even though you are my fellow clansmen, I will not be lenient should you anger me,” Chu Feng looked to the crowd with a sharp gaze.

After seeing his gaze, the crowd all trembled with fear, and immediately shut their mouths.

Then, Chu Feng decided to guard that place.

More and more Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen began to arrive after capturing people from various powers.

All of the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen that arrived would end up being subdued by Chu Feng.

As for their captives, they were all released by Chu Feng.

As for the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen, they were imprisoned.

Just like that, three days quickly passed...

Chu Feng was sitting cross-legged on the ground and releasing his power to sense his surroundings.

He was waiting for people to approach.

“This aura... it’s Lord Clan Chief. Lord Clan Chief actually became a peak Exalted?”

Chu Feng stood up all of a sudden. Not only did he manage to sense the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief’s aura, but he also sensed his cultivation.

Peak Exalted. Chu Feng knew very well what that represented.

This meant that the Chu Heavenly Clan would no longer be bullied by others.

To the Chu Heavenly Clan, this was an enormously joyous matter.

“Strange.”

However, before Chu Feng could be happy, his expression suddenly sank. Then, he hurriedly turned his worry-filled eyes in the direction of the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.
