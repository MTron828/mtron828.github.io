“It is the Ancestral Martial Sect Realm’s main city. I never expected it to be hidden in the Ancestral Martial Galaxy!”

Those from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion stared at the massive city with heated eyes. They were much more excited than Jie Tianran, to the point where their emotions seemed to run amok.

They knew better than anyone else how powerful the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect was. According to their records, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion had even developed under the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect when it was first founded.

If not for the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect, their Seven Realms Sacred Mansion wouldn’t have become the strongest power in the vast world of cultivation. Of course, this was also due to the entire Ancestral Martial Realm Sect moving into the Immemorial Domain of Gods.

The Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s foundation was simply too strong, as they monopolized the best world spiritist resources in the early years of the present era. Even to this day, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion still struggled to breach some of the remnants they had left behind.

This indirectly meant that the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion still hadn’t reached the level of the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect. Due to that, those from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion were obsessed with the legacies left behind by the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect.

“Lord Mansion Master, is there a way to move the main city away?” an elder asked.

Their first thought upon seeing the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect was how to monopolize it. However, as world spiritists, they could tell that it was no easy feat to take the main city away with them. Thus, they turned to Jie Tianran to see if he had a solution.

“I doubt that our formations will be able to faze it. We can construct protective formations and prevent others from approaching it, but we won’t be able to stop others from observing it. However, there’s no need to worry. It won’t be easy to obtain the treasures there. If we can’t do anything about it, I doubt that they can do better,” Jie Tianran said.

“Lord Mansion Master, where did those from the Ancient Era’s clans go? Did they leave because they weren’t able to do anything about the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s main city? Or are they hiding in the vicinity?” an elder asked.

They were still worried.

From the formation they had previously constructed, they had seen the woman in a white dress fighting with the Ancient Era’s clans, but they couldn’t see what happened afterward. By the time they arrived, it was already over. The Ancestral Martial Galaxy’s protective formation was gone, and the Ancient Era’s clans were nowhere to be seen.

All that was left was an awful blood stench, signaling that there must have been a terrible battle where many people had died. Since it was a battle, someone must have won. Regardless of who the victor was, it was someone whom they had to guard against.

“Ignore them,” Jie Tianran calmly replied.

He was so composed as if he had everything planned out. He took out the Seven Realms Edict, wrote some words on it, and activated it.

A powerful surge of spirit power rippled not only across the Ancestral Martial Galaxy but to the other galaxies too. The speed of transmission was limited, but it didn’t take too long for his message to reach every nook and cranny in the Ancestral Martial Galaxy.

The spirit power covered the skies of the Ancestral Martial Galaxy’s realms with a white glow like a paper wrapping itself around each of the realms. Majestic words manifested on the paper.

The vast world of cultivation ought to be one. The Ancestral Martial Galaxy has contributed greatly to the world of cultivation’s current prosperity, so our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion won’t stand for anyone harming it, whether it’s those from the Ancient Era or the present era.

From this day onward, the Ancestral Martial Galaxy will be under our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s protection. Anyone who makes a move against the Ancestral Martial Galaxy will be making an enemy out of us too.

-Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master, Jie Tianran.

...

“What’s the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion doing?” the Holy Master asked with a frown.

He had heard about the conflict between Chu Feng and the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, which was why he thought the latter would go on a massacre and plunder the Ancestral Martial Galaxy’s resources to exact vengeance on Chu Feng.

He hadn’t expected them to do this instead.

...

The cultivators from the Ancestral Martial Galaxy were taken aback too. More cultivators made their way toward the realms shrouded by the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s protective formation.

Most people in the Ancestral Martial Galaxy hadn’t heard of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, but they could tell that the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion was a formidable existence from the spirit power shrouding their skies.

The earlier attack from the Ancient Era’s clans had put them on the edge, so the first thought that crossed their minds upon hearing the announcement was to first hide.

...

The Seven Realms Edict reached every realm in the Ancestral Martial Galaxy, and it was making its way toward the other galaxies. However, the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect was covered by a powerful formation that blocked the Seven Realms Edict, so it was impossible to see its content from within.

The Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster brought Chu Feng and the others to an observation formation to confirm if those from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion were here.

The observation formation was located in the sectmaster’s sleeping chamber. It appeared to be an ordinary door on the surface, but it led into a formation realm.

Inside the formation realm was a starry sky, but only the Ancestral Martial Galaxy could be seen in the sky. The formation could be freely maneuvered to observe wherever they wanted to see in the Ancestral Martial Galaxy.

“The Hidden Dragon Martial Sect is truly formidable.”

Chu Feng was amazed by the formation.

The protective formation earlier did allow him to observe everything that was going on in the Ancestral Martial Galaxy, but it consumed a huge amount of energy. It was only a matter of time before the protective formation ran out of energy and dissipated.

On the other hand, this observation formation consumed much less energy, and it had probably been used to observe the Ancestral Martial Galaxy for an extremely long time now.

Not even the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion would have such a powerful formation.

This showed just how powerful the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s foundation was.

Through observing the situation in the Ancestral Martial Galaxy, Chu Feng quickly learned about how the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion had arrived at the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s main city and about their Seven Realms Edict.

“They want to protect the Ancestral Martial Galaxy? Are they that kind?” Zi Ling murmured with a frown, sensing that something was amiss.

“What they want to protect isn’t the Ancestral Martial Galaxy but the treasures left behind by the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect. If they truly intended to protect our Ancestral Martial Galaxy, they should have made a move when the Ancient Era’s clans attacked us earlier instead of now. Clearly, they were observing the situation from afar and had decided to intervene only after seeing the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s main city,” Chu Feng replied.

“Junior Chu Feng is right. The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion sure is despicable,” Wen Xue said in agreement. She looked at Chu Feng with curious eyes. “I heard that the incumbent Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master is your maternal grandfather. Is he here as well? Which one is he?”

Chu Feng didn’t say a word, but his eyes were locked on Jie Tianran.
