Chapter 4914: Uncovering the Truth

“Elder, you said that… Miaomiao is dead?” Chu Feng asked in bewilderment.

He dared not believe what he had just heard.

“Chu Feng, you need to calm down,” Daoist Niantian said.

Just by looking at Chu Feng’s reaction, he could tell how close Chu Feng and Princess Miaomiao were.&nbsp;

“Elder, where did you hear the news from? Is it reliable?” Chu Feng tried his best to stabilize his emotions before asking on.

He felt that there was a need to get to the bottom of this matter.

“This news came from the Nine Souls Sacred Clan. Otherwise, Shengguang Xuanye wouldn’t have dared to treat you in such a way,” Daoist Niantian said.

“Elder, do you know the inside story? Why would Miaomiao lose her life all of a sudden?” Chu Feng asked.

“I do know of the inside story.”

Daoist Niantian proceeded to inform Chu Feng about what he had heard.

Based on the information leaked by the Nine Souls Sacred Clan, Princess Miaomiao’s mother was the younger sister of the incumbent Nine Souls Sacred Clan’s Clan Chief. Due to that, Princess Miaomiao had a high standing in the clan.

There were many princesses in the Nine Souls Sacred Clan, but the one who was on closest terms with Xian Miaomiao was a princess named Jiuhun Qiu.

Jiuhun Qiu was the daughter of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan’s Clan Chief, which meant that her standing was even higher than that of Xian Miaomiao. She was also well-liked within the clan.

As a result, despite maintaining an appearance of close ties with Jiuhun Qiu on the surface, Xian Miaomiao was swallowed by her jealousy and attempted to harm the other party. It was just that her ploy was exposed in the end, and the Nine Souls Sacred Clan’s Clan Chief flew into a fit of rage.

To right her name, Xian Miaomiao’s mother personally executed her own daughter.&nbsp;

“Impossible. Miaomiao wouldn’t get jealous of others, let alone harm others over that!” Chu Feng exclaimed with gritted teeth.

“Chu Feng, do you think that Princess Miaomiao was framed?” Daoist Niantian asked.

“That’s definitely the case,” Chu Feng replied.

“Actually, I’ve discussed this matter with Brother Buyu and Lord Baimei beforehand. If Princess Miaomiao is truly important to you and you wish to get to the bottom of this matter, the three of us are willing to accompany you to the Nine Souls Sacred Clan to understand the situation. It’s just that… we’ll have to move covertly.

“It’s not that we’re afraid of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan, but it’ll be harder for us to uncover the truth if we alarm the Nine Souls Sacred Clan with our presence,” Daoist Niantian said.

“I’ll be troubling you then.”

Chu Feng didn’t reject the offer.

Regardless of whether Xian Miaomiao was dead or not, he had to get to the bottom of this matter. The only problem was that he was too weak to infiltrate the Nine Souls Sacred Clan on his own. If he could borrow the Holy Valley’s strength, that would make things much easier for him.

“Young friend Chu Feng, please wait a moment. I’ll head over and talk to Brother Buyu and the others about it first.”

Daoist Niantian was just about to leave and inform Shengguang Baimei and Shengguang Buyu about Chu Feng’s decision when Chu Feng suddenly spoke up once more.

“Elder, is the news really accurate? Did the Nine Souls Sacred Clan really let out news that Miaomiao is dead?” Chu Feng asked unconfidently.

He was afraid for that to be the case.

“Many people have witnessed with their own eyes how Princess Miaomiao’s mother executed her. Chu Feng, I hope that you can take her death in stride. If Princess Miaomiao is truly framed, we’ll do our best to help you right her name,” Daoist Niantian said with a sigh.

He could understand how Chu Feng was feeling at this moment.

Chu Feng also fell silent too.

Xian Miaomiao was one of his closest friends. The two of them got along well, and they had braved through difficult situations together too. They shared many happy times together.

He was happy for her when he learned that her mother had brought her into the Nine Souls Sacred Clan, but who could have thought that this was the plight awaiting her?

Even if all evidence was pointing toward Xian Miaomiao’s death, he wouldn’t accept it until he saw her body himself. Till then, he would hold onto the small sliver of hope that she was still alive.&nbsp;

Even so, he couldn’t stop sorrow from gripping his heart.&nbsp;

He knew that he had to be prepared for the possibility that Xian Miaomiao might really be dead. It was just that he desperately hoped that that wouldn’t be the case.&nbsp;

“Nine Souls Sacred Clan, why must you harm the kind Miaomiao?”

Rage suddenly filled Chu Feng’s eyes.

Based on his understanding of Xian Miaomiao, he was certain that the rumors were false. There was no way she would do something like that. He was certain that she was framed.

If Xian Miaomiao had indeed been framed by the Nine Souls Sacred Clan, he would have them pay with their lives, even if they were the overlords of the Nine Souls Galaxy!

He wouldn’t let this matter rest easily!

When Daoist Niantian informed Shengguang Buyu and Shengguang Baimei of Chu Feng’s decision, the two of them agreed to it right away.&nbsp;

Shengguang Baimei knew that Chu Feng still held some reservations toward him, so he thought that this was a perfect opportunity to mend their fractured relationship.&nbsp;

Thus, the four of them swiftly made their way to the Nine Souls Galaxy before proceeding to the realm where the Nine Souls Sacred Clan was stationed.

With Daoist Niantian, Shengguang Buyu, and Shengguang Baimei, the four of them were able to infiltrate the tightly-guarded Nine Souls Sacred Clan without any problems.

The first thing they did was to capture their members to verify if Princess Miaomiao was really dead. However, as they moved on to interrogating stronger and more influential members of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan, Chu Feng grew more and more silent.

Almost every single person they asked was certain that the one who died was Princess Miaomiao, and the culprit was her own mother. To be more exact, she was burned to death by her mother’s flame ability.

If this was true, it would mean that Chu Feng wouldn’t even be able to see Princess Miaomiao’s corpse to ascertain her death himself.

“Young friend Chu Feng, I don’t think that it’s possible to get to the bottom of this matter by asking these people. The best way to go about this is to ask Princess Miaomiao’s mother,” Shengguang Baimei said.

“Yeah,” Chu Feng replied with a nod.

Shengguang Baimei quickly led the way.

They had already uncovered where Princess Miaomiao’s mother was staying. She was currently cultivating in one of the forbidden areas of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan.

Even the forbidden areas of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan couldn’t hope to stop Shengguang Baimei and the others. They were able to sneak in there without any issues. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

They soon found themselves face-to-face with a middle-aged woman.

This middle-aged woman had a beautiful face and was dressed beautifully. Chu Feng could tell with a glance that she was Xian Miaomiao’s mother.

The two of them simply looked too alike.

It was just that Xian Miaomiao’s mother was in a much different state compared to what Chu Feng and the others imagined. Even though she was supposedly cultivating at this place, the truth was that she was trapped by a formation.

She was also in a bad condition, looking a little dazed. Her eyes were reddened, and there were tears stains on her cheeks. It showed that she had cried a lot.

Looking at her state, Shengguang Baimei and the others looked at one another. They could tell right away that something was amiss here.

The truth was not as it seemed!
