Chapter 3379 - The Youngest Saint-cloak

“Right, we should handle the proper business first,” With a beaming smile on his face, the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief nodded.

Then, the three of them soared into the sky and began to fly toward the Ice Summit.

No one paid attention to the three of them leaving or to what had happened earlier.

After all, with so many people gathered here, conflicts and people leaving were extremely common. No one would bother to pay any special attention of Chu Feng and the others.

After Chu Feng heard what the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said, he seemed to have an understanding as to why those Gong Heavenly Clan’s younger generations were only quietly discussing him amongst themselves, and started to openly provoke him the moment they discovered him to be a Chu Heavenly Clansman.

Likely, it must be because of that preposterous arranged marriage.

“Clank, clank, clank.”

As they were flying, the sounds of a gong were heard from far away, and even shook the space they were in.

As they looked over, they saw someone holding a gong and beating it while flying and shouting, “Heaven-shocking news! Exalted Heavenly Fate has made a prophecy!”

“Within seven days, the youngest Saint-cloak World Spiritist in the entire history of our Ancestral Martial Starfield will emerge on the Ice Summit!”

The cultivation of that gong-beating individual was not weak. His flying speed was extremely fast. In a flash, he passed by Chu Feng and the others.

However, Chu Feng and everyone else beside him heard that person’s news.

“Ice Summit? Isn’t that the place where we’re going?”

Upon hearing the news, Wuma Shengjie revealed a change in her expression. Then, she turned her eyes to Chu Feng, “The youngest Saint-cloak World Spiritist, it couldn’t possibly be you, right?”

“How could that be? I’m only a Snake Mark Exalted-cloak World Spiritist right now. How could I break through to Saint-cloak in a mere seven days?” Chu Feng shook his head.

“But, Exalted Heavenly Fate’s prophecies are never wrong. Exactly who could that person be?” Wuma Shengjie began to ponder.

“Exalted Heavenly Fate is only a martial cultivator, not a god. Why would his prophecies never be wrong?” Chu Feng questioned.

“Chu Feng, Exalted Heavenly Fate has, in his lifetime, made at least several hundred if not over a thousand prophecies. All of his prophecies end up occurring as he prophecies. There has never been an error in his prophecies,” The Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“Senior, in that case, who do you think that history’s youngest Saint-cloak World Spiritist will be?” Chu Feng asked.

“I’m uncertain about that. However, being history’s youngest does not certainly mean that it will be a person of the younger generation within a hundred years of age. Perhaps that person would only be a bit younger when compared to the others.”

“I think that it is very possible for that history’s youngest Saint-cloak World Spiritist to be one of Grandmaster Liangqiu’s disciples,” The Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“I don’t think that’ll be the case,” Wuma Shengjie said.

Perhaps because of what had happened to her parents, Wuma Shengjie had always harbored grievances against the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, and did not show the slightest amount of respect toward him.

However, the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief did not have any intention of blaming her. Likely, he had already grown accustomed to her contrary behavior.

Seeing the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief and Wuma Shengjie like that, Chu Feng felt it to be quite enjoyable. Although what had happened back then was indeed very painful for Wuma Shengjie, the ones in the wrong were the people of the branch clan, not the main clan.

Chu Feng felt that even if Wuma Shengjie harbored hatred against her clansmen, she would definitely not be able to steel her heart to do anything to them should an opportunity present itself.

The sentiments from all the years had already seeped deep into her heart. In the end, they remained her true relatives.

“Chu Feng, this news will soon spread. At that time, everyone will be making for the Ice Summit. We should increase our speed, so as to avoid needless trouble,” The Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said. Then, he released his Lightning Mark to increase his cultivation, and sped up their traveling speed.

......

There was a mountain peak in the Nine Dragons Upper Realm. The mountain peak was extremely tall, so tall that it continued for many tens of thousands of meters after piercing through the clouds.

A lot of people were gathered around that mountain peak. They came from all different powers. Among them were also many powerful and grand existences.

At that time, those people that were gathered around the mountain peak were all very excited and emotional. Curiosity filled their faces as they talked amongst themselves.

What they were discussing was none other than a prophecy that was being spread around.

......

At the summit of the mountain peak was a palace.

There were three people inside the palace.

One of them was Exalted Heavenly Fate. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

The other was Exalted Heavenly Fate’s subordinate, Aunt Blackface.

The third individual was an old man from the Linghu Heavenly Clan.

The old man was not very tall. He had a good-natured face, and seemed like a benevolent grandpa.

However, Aunt Blackface did not even dare to look at the old man face to face. Unconcealable fear was present in her eyes.

This old man was called Linghu Wentai. He was one of the Linghu Heavenly Clan’s Supreme Elders.

Linghu Wentai was extremely powerful, so powerful as to be an Utmost Exalted-level expert.

“Lord Heavenly Fate, thank you for all the trouble you’ve gone through today,” As Linghu Wentai spoke, he tossed a Cosmos Sack to Exalted Heavenly Fate.

“There’s no need for this,” Exalted Heavenly Fate pushed the Cosmos Sack that was tossed to him back.

Linghu Wentai smiled. However, he did not tangle with Exalted Heavenly Fate, and accepted the returned Cosmos Sack.

“I hope that Lord Heavenly Fate will keep what happened today confidential, for my clan chief will blame me should it be known. This old man is unable to assume responsibility for it,” Linghu Wentai said.

“Lord Wentai, you can rest assured about that,” Exalted Heavenly Fate said.

“Since that’s the case, this old man will be taking his leave. Lord Heavenly Fate, take care,” Linghu Wentai left after bidding farewell.

After Linghu Wentai left, Aunt Blackface complained, “That Linghu Heavenly Clan is simply too excessive! Not even the people from the Starfield Master Realm dare to force Milord to make a false prophecy!”

“Yet the Linghu Heavenly Clan actually dares to force you to do such a thing!”

“The Linghu Heavenly Clan is currently so powerful that even the Starfield Master Realm has no choice but to take them seriously. It will be very hard to determine the structure of the Ancestral Martial Starfield in the future. We cannot afford to offend them,” Exalted Heavenly Fate said.

“But Lord Heavenly Fate, you’ve never announced false prophecies. You’ve truly been wronged to be forced to do what you did today,” Aunt Blackface felt grievance for Exalted Heavenly Fate.

“Who said that the prophecy I made was false?” Exalted Heavenly Fate asked.

Hearing those words, Aunt Blackface’s expression immediately changed. She hurriedly asked, “Milord, could it be that the prophecy you announced is real?”

Exalted Heavenly Fate sighed. “I was indeed forced by the Linghu Heavenly Clan today.”

“I was actually also prepared to announce a false prophecy today.”

“Merely, not even I would’ve imagined for my prophecy to actually bear fruit.”

“Within seven days, a Saint-cloak World Spiritist will really be born on the Ice Summit. Furthermore, that Saint-cloak World Spiritist will be a person of the younger generation within a hundred years of age,” Exalted Heavenly Fate said.
