Chapter 3787 - Serves You Right

“In such a public place with so many people, they’re actually really defecating. Have they gone mad?”

“I can’t anymore. This is simply too disgusting. I’m going out to get some air.”

A woman felt completely disgusted by Luo Zhi and his two close buddies. She held her mouth and ran outside.

Although the others did not directly run away like that woman, they all stood far away from the three, and were looking at them with looks of disgust.

Of course, there were also people looking at them with enjoyment.

From this, it could be seen the bunch were truly a gang of scoundrels.

Luo Zhi and his two close friends were clearly suffering. Yet, not only were they not helping them, but they instead sealed them away using a spirit formation, and then mocked and ridiculed them from the sidelines.

It was said that even though married couples were birds of the same forest, they would flee their own separate ways when a great catastrophe befell them.

Never did Chu Feng expect that a gang of scoundrels would also behave in the same manner.

At the moment when Luo Zhi’s friends decided to abandon them... it was the attendant who ran out in a hurry.

“What’s happening?” Song Ge had a look of confusion.

“It seems like they’re unable to withstand the tea. Didn’t Luo Zhi himself say that ordinary people will not be able to withstand the tea?” said Chu Feng.

“In that case, wouldn’t that mean that you and I are not ordinary people?” Song Ge looked to Chu Feng with her large eyes blinking.

“Of course,” said Chu Feng.

“Then... what about that attendant?” asked Song Ge.

“I don’t know about that attendant. However, he’s at least stronger than Luo Zhi and his two buddies,” Chu Feng said with a smile.

Hearing those words, the smile on Song Ge’s face became even wider.

She did not have any sympathy for Luo Zhi and his friends. The reason for that was because she knew that they were not good people to begin with.

If it wasn’t for Chu Feng wanting to go to the Cyan Bamboo Teahouse to enjoy tea, she never would’ve accompanied them there.

“Your name is Asura, right?”

Right at the moment when Chu Feng and Song Ge were chatting, a sharp and harsh voice transmission suddenly entered Chu Feng’s ears.

It came from the woman beside Song Ge, Wang Lian.

“You need something?” Chu Feng asked using voice transmission.

“I do not care what method you used to approach Song Ge, but Song Ge is my good sister. Thus, I’d urge you to keep your distance from her,” Wang Lian said to Chu Feng.

“And what if I don’t?” asked Chu Feng.

“If you dare to refuse to listen to my advice, I will take your little life,” said Wang Lian. Her attitude was extremely unyielding.

Chu Feng revealed a cold grin at Wang Lian’s threat. His grin was full of contempt and mockery.

In Wang Lian’s eyes, Chu Feng was nothing more than trash. Yet, at that moment, that trash was taunting her like that. Wang Lian was so angered by Chu Feng that even her heart started trembling with rage.

“You should take a mirror and look at yourself. Someone like you dares to think about getting with our Song Ge? You are simply a toad that wants to eat swan meat!” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“You and her, one belongs to the heavens, and the other belongs to the dirt. You will never be able to be together with her.”

Furious, Wang Lian began to curse Chu Feng out.

However, Chu Feng was not angered by Wang Lian’s curses. He replied, “Impossible? I might as well tell you this: as long as I wish for it, I could get with anyone.”

“What? Someone like you actually dares make such a boastful claim?” Wang Lian felt completely astonished.

“This is called knowing one’s own worth," Chu Feng spoke with a confident expression.

“You... you are most definitely the most shameless person I’ve ever met. How could there be someone as shameless as you in this world?”

“Listen carefully! Should you not leave Song Ge’s sight today, I will rip off your skin! I shall see exactly how thick-skinned you are!”

Wang Lian was not only cursing Chu Feng out, but she was even threatening him.

Chu Feng only replied with, “You should be grateful that you have a good mother.”

“What are you implying by that?” Wang Lian asked in confusion.

“You will understand in the future,” said Chu Feng.

“Are you threatening me?”

“Haha. What a joke! Someone like you dares to threaten me?!”

“You should go and check yourself out in a mirror. See for yourself how useless you are,” Wang Lian continued to curse out Chu Feng.

However, Chu Feng no longer bothered to pay any attention to Wang Lian’s curses.

Chu Feng would not be enraged because of curses from someone like Wang Lian. After all, he had seen too many people like her.

Truth be told, her defects of being vain, self-interested and exploiting of her friend were all things that he disliked greatly.

Had it been before, Chu Feng would’ve taught someone like her a lesson.

However, taking Aunty Liu into consideration, Chu Feng had decided to spare her and not bicker with her.

“Coming! Coming! The antidote is coming!”

“Quickly, remove the spirit formation!”

Soon, the attendant ran back.

After the spirit formation was removed, the attendant immediately fed Luo Zhi and the others the antidote.

With the help of the antidote, Luo Zhi and his two friends were finally able to return to normal.

Luo Zhi immediately set up a spirit formation to hide himself and his friends.

When the spirit formation opened again, they had all changed into new clothes. Not only did they no longer have a disgusting smell, but they were instead emitting a faint aroma.

However, their complexions were still ugly. After all, they’d completely humiliated themselves earlier.

“Milords, fortunately I’ve acted quickly,” the attendant said with a smile.

He was actually seeking a reward for his actions. After all, if he hadn’t rushed to return with the antidote, Luo Zhi and his two friends would have had to continue vomiting and defecating for ten days straight.

“Scram!”

Suddenly, Luo Zhi waved his sleeve, and a burst of wind swept forth. The attendant was sent flying out.

“Wuuahh~~~”

After landing, the attendant was seriously injured and unable to even stand up.

He did not receive the reward he sought. Instead, he received a beating.

“To dare harm us with poisoned tea, we are already being extremely benevolent by not killing you!”

“Go and fetch your manager! If you fail to provide me with a proper explanation today, I will smash apart your Cyan Bamboo Teahouse!”

Luo Zhi had aimed all the anger in his heart at the attendant.

He had no choice but to do so. After all, he needed to find a way out of their embarrassing situation.

He couldn’t possibly say that he knew that it was poisoned tea, but thought it to be a sacred tea after witnessing the miraculous effect it had on Chu Feng and Song Ge, and then decided to drink it, only to screw himself?

If he said that, he would be deemed an utter fool.

Because of that, he could only say that he had no idea, and that the attendant was the one who had deliberately poisoned him.

Only that would provide an excuse for what had happened.

Thus, the innocent attendant became the person to shoulder all the blame.

However, Chu Feng did not have any sympathy for the attendant.

The attendant had worked with Luo Zhi and his friends to screw him over. He was not a good person to begin with. Thus, it could only be said that the attendant deserved what had happened to him.
