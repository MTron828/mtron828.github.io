Chapter 5975: An Undefeatable Opponent

After Jie Tian left, all of the elders turned to Ling Mouzi.

“We’ll be punished if we fail to capture Chu Feng, but if something happens to the young master, it won’t end with a punishment,” Ling Mouzi said as he entered the teleportation formation too.

Hearing those words, the others hurriedly entered the teleportation formation too.

This teleportation formation was a part of the sealing formation, and it allowed them to swiftly travel within the area enveloped by the sealing formation.

The area around Chu Feng had been obliterated by the immense pressure coming from the sealing formation, trapping him inside a vacuum. Beneath him, the raging lava billowed like rapid tides.

Weng!

There was suddenly a tear in space, and a spirit formation gate manifested. Jie Tian, Ling Mouzi, and the others walked out from within.

Jie Tian eyed Chu Feng and saw that the latter was indeed trapped in place, but to his surprise, Chu Feng appeared unfazed by the immense pressure of the formation net. Indeed, there was a powerful formation pushing back the formation net, but Jie Tian struggled to identify the origin of the formation.

However, Jie Tian couldn’t be bothered to think deeper into it, since the formation protecting Chu Feng appeared to be on the verge of collapse under the immense pressure of the powerful sealing formation.

Thus, Jie Tian casually conjured a formation chair and sat down. He didn’t say a word; he just wanted to see Chu Feng succumbing to the formation net.

Chu Feng was the first one to speak up. “What’s wrong? Are you too tired to remain standing so you require a chair?”

Jie Tian was unfazed by the provocation. “Hand over the treasure, and I’ll leave you with a whole corpse.”

“I’ll be honest with you. The remnant’s treasure is useless to the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion because you already have it—it is the Heaven Tome,” Chu Feng replied.

“Chu Feng, you’re still lying even at this point? Looks like you need to suffer more.” Ling Mouzi didn’t believe Chu Feng’s words.

“Someone does need to suffer, but it isn’t me.”

Chu Feng pointed his finger and Jie Tian and the others. A burst of spirit power suddenly gushed outward from him, and the formation net descending on him began to rapidly swell up.

Now, the one that looked to be on the verge of collapse was no longer Chu Feng’s formation but the formation net falling on him!

Sensing that something was amiss, Ling Mouzi quickly grabbed Jie Tian to escape via the spirit formation gate.

Boom!

A loud explosion suddenly tore the surrounding space to shreds, vaporizing even the lava below. The spirit formation gate was destroyed too.

“This is bad.”

Ling Mouzi’s face turned grim.

Not only had Chu Feng unraveled the formation net powered by the sealing formation, but he had also destroyed their path of escape too. By this point, it was obvious that he had feigned weakness to lure them in!

The shattered space swiftly recovered, and another massive formation net manifested. This time, the formation net was aimed at Jie Tian, Ling Mouzi, and the others. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Ling Mouzi struggled with all his might, but it was to no avail. The formation net binding them was beyond his means to break free of.

“What’s wrong? A Saint-tier elder can’t break free of a little net? What do you plan to do now? Can that formation of yours save you again?” Chu Feng sneered with narrowed eyes.

Some of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s elders gritted their teeth in anger. They looked as if they wouldn’t hesitate to bite a chunk of meat off Chu Feng!

Chu Feng had used the means they had employed against him to capture them. He had done this on purpose to humiliate them!

However, some trembled in fear.

Chu Feng outdoing them once might be played off as luck, but what about the second time and the third time? Putting all things aside, he had already one-upped them thrice in this remnant. This made them feel terrified and even despair.

It was their first time feeling so powerless before a junior.

Weng!

All of a sudden, great pressure fell from the sky. It slipped through the formation net and knocked out not just Jie Tian but even Ling Mouzi and the others too.

The next moment, the formation net trapping Jie Tian and the others suddenly unraveled, and their figures swiftly drifted away.

Daoist First Dragon and Daoist Second Dragon immediately realized things had gone awry. Someone from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion was trying to save Jie Tian and the others.

Thus, the two of them quickly formed formation seals, and countless vines shot forth at an incredible speed and chased after Jie Tian and the others. It didn’t take long for the vines to catch up.

Whoosh!

Jie Tian and the others halted in place, but at the same time, the vines were sliced into pieces.

An incredibly powerful barrier had formed around Jie Tian and the others, and it unraveled the two daoists’ attack with ease.

“Run, young friend Chu Feng!” Daoist First Dragon said.

A spirit formation gate manifested near Chu Feng. It was a teleportation formation.

That brief clash made Daoist First Dragon and the others realize that whoever was trying to save Jie Tian and the others was incredibly strong; it was an opponent that they couldn’t beat even if they joined hands. Thus, they knew that they had to escape right away.

Kacha! Kacha!

Cracks appeared on the spirit formation gate, and it shattered like a mirror.

The teleportation formation was destroyed as soon as it manifested.

Cornered, the Totem Nine Daoists decided to reveal themselves.

Daoist First Dragon looked at the sky and said, “Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master, why don’t you reveal yourself now that you’re here? Come at us instead of this junior!”

In response to Daoist First Dragon’s words, countless vines suddenly descended from the sky like a torrential rain. There were so many vines that they could easily seal off the entire realm if put to it!

These vines shot toward Chu Feng and the others, but they stopped within a hundred-meter radius of them and began revolving.

“Are you insulting us? Don’t look down on us!”

Daoist First Dragon and Daoist Second Dragon were infuriated.

The vines were identical to the ones they had conjured, just that the other party had summoned far more vines than them. It was almost as if the other party was boasting about their strength, as if they could do whatever the two daoists did better.

Unable to tolerate the insult, the two daoists unleashed a blade storm and shredded the vines.

It was also then that the difference between their vines showed.

The vines conjured by the two daoists had simply dissipated into spirit power, but the ones conjured by the other party remained corporeal even after it was sliced up. Plant juice even splattered as a result of the attack, and there was a scent to it.

Daoist First Dragon’s face darkened when he smelled the scent. “This isn’t good. It’s a formation within a formation. We have fallen for the other party’s trap!”

The scent was from a medicine, and it had the effect of knocking out those who breathed it in. The Totem Nine Daoists realized it too late, and it didn’t take long for them to pass out.

However, they didn’t plummet to the ground, as Chu Feng protected them.

Chu Feng was the only one who remained conscious, but that was because the other party had only attacked the Totem Nine Daoists and not him. This left Chu Feng confused.

Why would the enemy leave me out of their attack? Even if they don’t intend to kill me right away, they should at least try to subdue me one way or something.

“Chu Feng,” a voice suddenly echoed.

Chu Feng turned his head over, and his eyes narrowed.

A dignified middle-aged woman commanding an ethereal disposition, reminiscent of a fairy, was looking at him from the sky with gentle eyes.
