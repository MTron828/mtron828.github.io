Chapter 4364: A Huge Present

The four disciples of the Soaring Flower Gazebo were completely scared out of their wits. They kept fleeing southward without any thought on their mind at all. They were simply driven by a natural instinct to get away as quickly as possible.

After running some distance away, they finally arrived at the heart of a mountain range.

At first glance, there didn’t seem to be anything peculiar about this mountain range. But who could have thought that these four disciples would suddenly take out a formation key?

Under the effects of this formation key, an entrance into a formation suddenly appeared out of nowhere.

Chu Feng watched as everything happened from the shadows, and he even followed them when they passed through the formation too, but the four disciples were too flustered to notice him at all.

After passing through the entrance of the formation, Chu Feng realized that there was more to the mountain range than met the eye.

He was still standing in the midst of a mountain range, but it was vastly different from before. This made him realize that the mountain range outside the formation was nothing more than a diversion.

Chu Feng activated his Heaven’s Eye, and he saw many formidable plants and mystical products of nature lying around.

His guess was spot-on. The treasure that the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk had tipped him off about indeed had something to do with the people from the Soaring Flower Gazebo.

This was the place where the treasure was going to appear.

The only issue at the moment was that someone had set up a particularly powerful and complicated formation on this ground. It encompassed the entire mountain range, and its might was so great that it hindered Chu Feng’s discernment.

As a result, he was unable to determine what the treasure was and where it would surface.

However, Chu Feng was in no rush, especially since he had four guides with him. As long as he followed them, they should do well to lead him to where the treasure was.

From the current looks of it, it would appear that this treasure already had a master, and typically speaking, Chu Feng wouldn’t stoop so low to steal the treasure of another person.

But that being said, the Soaring Flower Gazebo was an exception.

It was a power that put on a righteous front to do all sorts of vile deeds. If Chu Feng had the strength to do it, he would have caught them all in a swoop and wiped them away from the face of this world.

Naturally, he wouldn’t feel any guilt pangs on his conscience to steal from such a group.

Even though the four disciples had fled in a fluster, they had a clear destination of where they were heading.

They advanced forth decisively, and finally, in the midst of a mountain valley, they finally reunited with the other disciples of the Soaring Flower Gazebo.

All in all, there were several hundred people from the Soaring Flower Gazebo here, but most of them looked quite fatigued. This area appeared to be their resting spot.

“Senior, why did you return so quickly? Didn’t you say that you would bring some beauties back to entertain us?

“Did the elders notice you, so you quickly rushed back?” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Where’s Senior Lu?”

Upon seeing the four of them, the other disciples of the Soaring Flower Gazebo quickly gathered around them and asked.

“He’s dead. Senior Lu is dead,” one of the four disciples replied with a grave voice.

“Senior Lu is dead?”

It was as if a pebble had fallen into a lake. There was a brief moment of silence before a huge commotion broke out.

Initially, they thought that the four disciples were joking around as it was simply too abrupt. However, when they looked at the fear and fluster written all over their faces, they realized that the four of them weren’t lying at all.

So, they quickly began to ask about how everything happened.

The four disciples also quickly recounted everything as well.

As it turned out, the four disciples, together with Senior Lu who was killed by Chu Feng, didn’t head out due to the phenomenon from Lian Xi’s group opening the treasure. Rather, they were intending to grab a few beauties off the streets and bring them back in here so as to entertain everyone.

It was just that shortly after they headed out, they happened to chance upon the brilliant burst of light, so they immediately headed over to take a look.

They thought that they had struck the jackpot, but who could have thought that it was a star of calamity instead?

After learning about all that had happened, the other disciples were extremely shocked.

They couldn’t believe that someone would dare to make a move on one of their own despite knowing that he was from the Soaring Flower Gazebo, and this made them realize that the culprit who had killed Senior Lu wasn’t any ordinary individual.

So, they began to anxiously discuss their next course of action.

Through their chatter, Chu Feng learned that many experts of the Soaring Flower Gazebo were actually stationed within this mountain range. Aside from disciples like them, there were also elders here too.

It was just that the elders were busy doing something important at the moment, so they dared not to interrupt them over this matter.

As it turned out, Senior Lu, as a rank six Utmost Exalted level expert, was the strongest amongst them and had the highest standing. On the other hand, the strongest of those in here was only at rank five Utmost Exalted level.

Given so, they didn’t think that they would be a match against Chu Feng, so naturally, they dared not to head out and confront him.

So, their current decision was to wait it out. It wouldn’t be too late to avenge Senior Lu later on anyway.

Weng!

But all of a sudden, a tremendous oppressive might fell upon the mountain range, shocking these disciples of the Soaring Flower Gazebo.

“What’s going on? Did a problem crop up with the formation?”

They could sense that the oppressive might was coming not from a cultivator but from the spirit power of a formation.

“What kind of formation are you talking about?”

And all of a sudden, a silhouette appeared before them—Chu Feng.

“It’s you?!?!”

“Y-you... You actually chased us here?!?!”

The other disciples of the Soaring Flower Gazebo were flustered, but for the four disciples who had just run back here, terror could be seen all over their faces.

After all, they had just witnessed how the rank six Utmost Exalted level Senior Lu was killed in this person’s hands.

“Wait, is this guy who killed Senior Lu?”

Noticing the fearful looks on those four disciples, the others also quickly came to realize what was going on. A wave of fear rippled through the crowd of disciples.

They were still discussing how to deal with Chu Feng a moment ago, but before they could come up with any concrete plan, the man had already appeared right before their eyes. They had no idea what they should do at all.

After all, this was the man who could defeat their strongest expert!

“Don’t get so scared. As long as you do what I tell you to, I’ll spare you. But of course, if you do something that goes against my wishes...” Chu Feng’s voice slowly trailed off as coldness crept into his eyes.

Weng!

And in the next moment, an overwhelming outpour of killing intent filled the area which Chu Feng had already sealed off with his formation.

“M-milord! W-what do you want us to do?”

The disciples of the Soaring Flower Gazebo asked in a fluster.

“Tell me what you are doing here. If I were to detect any falsehood in your words, I’ll make sure that you suffer a fate worse than death!” Chu Feng said.

Hearing that, the disciples of the Soaring Flower Gazebo immediately told Chu Feng everything they knew.

As it turned out, the place they were in was the true mountain range. What that was outside was nothing more than a facade created through a formation.

The reason why even Chu Feng was unable to see through it was because this formation was personally constructed by the sectmaster of the Soaring Flower Gazebo.

On top of that, the world spiritist experts of the Soaring Flower Gazebo would reinforce the formation periodically.

As for why the Soaring Flower Gazebo would go to such lengths to conceal the mountain range, that was because the sectmaster of the Soaring Flower Gazebo had found an extremely formidable treasure in here.

It was a mystical product of nature that could aid one’s cultivation.

This treasure would be presented to the strongest disciple of the Soaring Flower Gazebo, Zhao Xuanhe, as a gift.
