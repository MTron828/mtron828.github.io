Chapter 4210 - Parting Ways

“Grandpa Bu, what you told me before is different from what you’re saying now.”

“You said you were extremely certain that senior Zhuge was defeated very strangely, and that it was most likely Sima Xiangtu that did something,” Long Xiaoxiao said all of a sudden.

“I was present that day. Zhuge Yuankong had originally held absolute superiority. He had suppressed the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted from the very start.”

“Because of that, it was indeed very fishy that he lost the match.”

“But, the world of martial cultivators is one where only results matter. Without proof, it would be difficult for anyone to make any remarks.”

“Besides, even Zhuge Yuankong himself did not say anything about it. Instead, he admitted his own defeat. Now that he’s no longer in this world, even if we doubt that the match was unfair, it wouldn’t matter at all,” Long Shengbu had a look of slight helplessness as he said those words.

It could be seen that he had some sort of worry in his heart.

That was why he didn’t dare mention what had happened to Chu Feng in a tone of certainty.

What he was worried about could very possibly be the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted.

That said, Chu Feng was capable of understanding his worries.

After all, the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted was the current strongest world spiritist in the Holy Light Galaxy.

All powers would have to cooperate with him. Not to mention the Dragon Clan, even the Holy Light Clan would need his help.

Who would possibly be willing to offend an existence like that?

That said, Chu Feng wasn’t worried.

After all, he knew very well that Zhuge Yuankong was still alive.

Instead, he had changed his identity and had become the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

Once he found the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, Chu Feng would naturally be able to learn what had actually happened back then.

“Oh, that’s right. Young friend Chu Feng, since you came from the other remnant, where might that other remnant be located?”

“This old man is not asking that question with any malice in mind. Truth is, this old man feels great respect for Zhuge Yuankong.”

“Now that it’s no longer possible to meet him again, I would like to pay a visit to the remnants he left behind,” Long Shengbu suddenly said to Chu Feng.

“Senior, my apologies. I was only able to enter that remnant because a friend needed my help.”

“Because of that, I will have to ask my friend whether or not I can inform you all of its location,” said Chu Feng.

“That’s alright. I’ve actually only asked about it out of curiosity,” Long Shengbu said with a faint smile.

Long Shengbu had no intention of making things difficult for Chu Feng. Even the two people that had looked down on Chu Feng a lot earlier, Long Nanxun and Long Ruiyun, did not intend to make things difficult for him.

Instead, the expressions that they looked to him with had changed.

Furthermore, not long after this short exchange, Elder Ruiyun walked up to Chu Feng and bowed.

“Young hero Chu Feng, it is truly all thanks to you today. If it wasn’t for you, I would’ve brought a disaster upon us. I hope that young hero Chu Feng will excuse my prior offenses.”

After saying those words to Chu Feng, she kneeled before Long Xiaoxiao.

“Your Highness, this subordinate’s crimes are worthy of ten thousand deaths.”

She was naturally kneeling because of the All-seeing Heavenly Master. After all, she was the one who had requested her help.

However, right after she knelt, she was lifted back up by a power. It was Long Shengbu.

“Elder Ruiyun, what happened today is not your fault.”

“Since they want to kill Xiaoxiao, they would have acted sooner or later. Even if you hadn’t requested the All-seeing Heavenly Master’s help, they would have still attacked us,” said Long Shengbu.

“Elder Ruiyun, it’s true, this matter cannot be blamed on you.”

“On the contrary, I, Long Xiaoxiao, had fully observed how loyal you and Long Nanxun were.”

“Rest assured. I, Long Xiaoxiao, will definitely not let things end like this. I will not accept my fate. I will retrieve what my mother has lost.”

“One day, I will retrieve all that belongs to me. At that time, you and Long Nanxun will most definitely be repaid for your loyalty,” Long Xiaoxiao said to Elder Ruiyun.

After that, Chu Feng chatted with Long Xiaoxiao and the others a bit more.

Chu Feng learned that Long Xiaoxiao and the others had gone to the remnant for the Triple Dragon Coiling Soul Lock. He also learned that the Triple Dragon Coiling Soul Lock was missing from the remnant, and had very likely been retrieved by someone else.

Long Xiaoxiao even asked Chu Feng to see if he could search for the Triple Dragon Coiling Soul Lock with the power of the spirit formation to see if it might have been hidden away somewhere by Zhuge Yuankong.

Without even trying to search for the Triple Dragon Coiling Soul Lock, Chu Feng gave Long Xiaoxiao an answer.

He told her that there wasn’t a Triple Dragon Coiling Soul Lock there.

As for where it went, Chu Feng did not tell them.

But, Chu Feng had a guess as to its whereabouts.

Chu Feng felt that since all the treasures in the main formation had been retrieved by the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, the treasures there had most likely also been retrieved by the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

Perhaps because they were afraid that the All-seeing Heavenly Master would find helpers after her failure, Long Xiaoxiao and others decided to leave after a short exchange with Chu Feng.

As for Chu Feng, he returned to the main formation through the spirit formation gate.

After meeting up with Yu Ting, Chu Feng began searching for the spirit formation gate to the Reincarnation Upper Realm again. After finding the gate, they proceeded for the Reincarnation Upper Realm.

What Chu Feng didn’t know was that even though Long Xiaoxiao and others had parted with Chu Feng, they were still discussing what had happened.

A floating war chariot was flying rapidly in the sky.

Long Xiaoxiao and others were in the palace above the floating war chariot.

Even though they’d just experienced a near-death experience, they’d already regained their composure, and were acting normally. No trace of lingering fear was present on their faces.

“Xiaoxiao, do you know exactly who that Chu Feng is?”

“He seems to only be a person of the younger generation too, no? How was he able to gain control over the remnant’s spirit formation? Furthermore, it seemed like his control over the remnant’s spirit formation surpassed that of the All-seeing Heavenly Master.”

“Could it be that his world spirit techniques surpass that of the All-seeing Heavenly Master?” Long Nanxun asked with great curiosity.

“Long Nanxun, exactly what are you trying to say?” asked Long Xiaoxiao.

“I’m not trying to say anything. I’m simply confused,” said Long Nanxun.

“If Chu Feng was a nobody, would I have requested his help?”

“Didn’t I tell you from the very start that he’s very powerful, countless times more powerful than the two genius world spiritists you found? It was you and Elder Ruiyun who refused to believe me.”

“Whilst he might be from low birth, his talent is simply exceptional. I’ve personally witnessed his abilities. Grandpa Bu also witnessed it himself. If you don’t believe me, you can go ask Grandpa Bu,” said Long Xiaoxiao.

“That child’s talent is indeed outstanding. In the future, he will most definitely become someone great.”

“Furthermore, his talent is not only limited to his world spirit techniques. His attainments in his martial cultivation are equally shocking.”

After saying that, Long Shengbu added, “That said, it is indeed unimaginable for young friend Chu Feng to grasp power even greater than what the All-seeing Heavenly Master grasped.”
