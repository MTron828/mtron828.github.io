Chapter 4623: Walk the Walk, Talk the Talk

“You... You were the one who did this?”

The two prodigies bore with their pain as they asked Chu Feng.

“Who else could it be?” Chu Feng replied mockingly.

“What kind of treasure did you use to wrestle the control over this defensive formation from us? Or could it be that you have been hiding your true power? No, that can’t be. It’s impossible to fool Lord Black Demon. How in the world did you do it? How much do you know about this Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace? Who in the world are you?!”

The two prodigies of the Gongsun Clan demanded an answer to their questions, but amidst their arrogance, one could sense fear in their voices.

After all, their lives were in Chu Feng’s hands at the moment.

“You sure have lots of questions. Are you afraid that I’ll kill you?” Chu Feng replied with a leisurely smile.

This smile looked incredibly sinister in the eyes of the two prodigies. They sensed that Chu Feng was up to something.

“What are you planning to do? If you dare to harm us in the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace, our Gongsun Clan will definitely know about it. You’ll never get out of here alive if so!”

Seeing that the situation was to their disadvantage, one of the prodigies barked out a warning to Chu Feng.

Meanwhile, the other prodigy struggled to retrieve a talisman paper and tore it.

Weng!

A formation immediately emerged from the torn talisman paper, but it was a pity that the formation didn’t free them from the plight they were in.

Nevertheless, the emergence of the formation caused Xia Yan, Xiao Yu, and even Chu Feng to hesitate a little.

The formation manifested in an elliptical form in mid-air. It had a lustrous surface, reminiscent of a mirror. There were several figures to be seen on its surface.

They were all the prodigies of the Gongsun Clan, and even Gongsun Yuntian was amongst them. As soon as the formation was activated, Gongsun Yuntian and the others immediately turned their gazes over.

It was obvious that they could see the circumstances here, and this brought rage to the faces of the prodigies of the Gongsun Clan.

“Who were the ones who did this to you?” Gongsun Yuntian asked.

Clearly, this wasn’t a teleportation formation but a communication formation. Otherwise, given how the prodigies of the Gongsun Clan had reacted, they would have immediately charged over instead of asking a question.

Perhaps out of fear, the two prodigies of the Gongsun Clan didn’t reply right away. Instead, they shot a glance toward Chu Feng.

“I’m asking you who was the one who did this to you! Why are you looking at that trash?”

Another prodigy that was standing right behind Gongsun Yuntian howled in displeasure.

While the other prodigies weren’t saying anything, their expressions were equally displeased too.

In their view, Chu Feng was a trash who got into the matchmaking convention by resorting to trickery. It was beyond them to fathom that Chu Feng was the one behind the plights of the two prodigies.

“I-it’s him! He’s the one who did it!”

Seeing how their kin was unable to understand the nature of their gazes, the two prodigies of the Gongsun Clan could only put it out explicitly.

“Him?”

Those words surprised all of the prodigies from the Gongsun Clan.

They had considered the possibility that it was Xia Yan or Xiao Yu behind it, but it never crossed their mind that it could be Chu Feng.

“Why did you harm my brothers?” Gongsun Yuntian questioned Chu Feng through the formation.

“Your brothers stole my treasures and attempted to use the defensive formation here to deal with me. However, they were too inept that I was able to wrestle over control of the defensive formation and turn the tables on them,” Chu Feng replied.

“Is what he said true?” Gongsun Yuntian asked.

“Yes...”

The two prodigies of the Gongsun Clan nodded meekly.

“Release them right away!” Gongsun Yuntian ordered Chu Feng.

Even though he knew that his brothers were at fault here, he still chose to take on a tough attitude before Chu Feng.

This, however, wasn’t taken very well by Chu Feng.

To be honest, Chu Feng didn’t want to stir trouble. If they had chosen to talk their way out of this properly, he was fine with releasing those two prodigies. However, if they wanted to continue playing it tough, he wouldn’t let them have their way.

He had stood up before those who were far stronger than him before, let alone Gongsun Yuntian.

“Release them? You expect us to do your bidding just like that? Who do you think you are, the king of the world?”

But before Chu Feng could speak up, Xia Yan had already beat him to it.

“Who do you think you are to dare to talk to me like that?” Gongsun Yuntian spoke lividly.

“You want to know who I am? Well, let’s put it like this. I wouldn’t even bat an eyelid at your mere Gongsun Clan!”

Xia Yan began to calmly insult the Gongsun Clan. To make things worse, he wasn’t speaking in a serious tone but with a mischievous smile on his face.

Feeling like they had been made fun of, the prodigies of the Gongsun Clan became even more displeased. They knew that they were being made light of.

“You sure dare to speak lightly of our Gongsun Clan. Why don’t you tell me where you’re from then? We’ll make sure to pay you a visit once we’re out of here,” Gongsun Yuntian said.

His words were laced with threat.

“What big words.”

This time, it was Xiao Yu who spoke up.

“You need not be in such a rush. Someone will visit your Gongsun Clan very soon.”

The reticent Xiao Yu actually began talking back to the Gongsun Clan, and unlike Xia Yan’s playful tone, her earnest expression made it seem like she was really determined to pit it out with the Gongsun Clan.

“A bunch of fools who don’t know their place! You only dare to taunt us just because we’re divided by a formation. The three of you, I’ll remember your faces. If you dare hurt the members of our Gongsun Clan, you need not dream of returning alive!”

The prodigies behind Gongsun Yuntian pointed at Chu Feng and the others as they threatened.

Gah!

However, barely after they said those words, the formation beast tightened its grip around the two prodigies, making them howl in agony.

“Sounds like all words. What’s the point of running your mouth here? If you wish to make a move, go ahead. Didn’t you say earlier that you would take our lives? Since you have already made up your mind, there’s no choice for me but to kill these two then,” Chu Feng said.

“You dare!”

Those prodigies on the other side of the mirror began shouting at Chu Feng threateningly.

“You think I dare not?” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Chu Feng’s gaze turned chilly.
