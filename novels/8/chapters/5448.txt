Chapter 5448: Kill Them With the Formation

“Chu Feng!!! I’ll rip you into shreds!!!”

An infuriated roar filled with terrifying killing intent shook the air. It tore through the fabrics of space, creating innumerable spatial crevices. Jia Lingyi glared at Chu Feng with a warped face reminiscent of a demon.

Veins were popping out from her temples. She had lost her temper.

Those who had died were the future of their Pill Dao Immortal Sect, especially Jia Chengying. He was a prodigy who could have pushed their Pill Dao Immortal Sect to greater heights!

In fact, none of the ten thousand juniors who had entered the Infernal Realm were ordinary members. They were prodigies whom the Pill Dao Immortal Sect had devoted great resources to nurture.

Yet, Chu Feng massacred all of them in the blink of an eye. He had severed their future with a single move,

How could she not be angered?

The others from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect gritted their teeth. They would love nothing more than to tear Chu Feng into shreds right now. Their sheer killing intent shook the crowd outside the Infernal Realm even though they knew that it wasn’t directed at them.

Yet, Chu Feng remained unfazed.

He opened his palm, and a formation surfaced. He raised his finger at the Gate of the Masses, and the formation fused into it. He then turned to Jia Lingyi and said, “The rest of you can enter the Infernal Realm now regardless of whether you are a junior or not. However, only one of you is able to enter. Jia Lingyi, don’t you want to exact vengeance for the deceased juniors of your Pill Dao Immortal Sect? I’m giving you the chance to do so right now. Come in here.”

“What? Chu Feng is allowing Jia Lingyi to enter the Infernal Realm?”

Even the World Spiritist Painter was shocked to hear that, let alone the others. This was insane! It was one thing for Chu Feng to massacre the juniors, but how could he challenge Jia Lingyi?

They had sensed his spirit power when he made his move earlier on; his fighting prowess had to be at least comparable to a Golden Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist, or else he wouldn’t have been able to kill a Purple Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist like Jia Chengying so easily.

But even with that, he wouldn’t stand a chance against Jia Lingyi at all.

Yet, Chu Feng continued to maintain a confident front, as if the one who would be brought down was not him but Jia Lingyi. It was clear that something was amiss here.

A hint of fluster flashed across Jia Lingyi’s eyes. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Young miss, you mustn’t enter. Most of the young masters who entered the Infernal Realm had protective formations, but all of them died without any of their protective formations triggering. He might have grasped some kind of power inside the Infernal Realm. You’ll be falling into his trap if you enter the Infernal Realm!” An elder sent a voice transmission to Jia Lingyi.

In truth, Jia Lingyi wouldn’t have dared to enter even if not for the warning. She, too, could tell that something was amiss. Chu Feng must have grasped tremendous power, perhaps even supreme power within the Infernal Realm. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have dared to challenge her.

“Why aren’t you speaking? Are you afraid? Are you worried that you’ll drop dead like the juniors of your Pill Dao Immortal Sect?” Chu Feng eyed Jia Lingyi in disdain.

However, Jia Lingyi remained silent despite his provocations. She knew that nothing good would come out of responding to him.

No one had expected such an outcome. It was one thing for Chu Feng to kill the juniors of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect, but who could have thought that he would actually intimidate Jia Lingyi as well. No one would have believed such a thing to be possible if they hadn’t seen it with their own eyes.

But what Chu Feng said next rendered the crowd speechless, and Jia Lingyi nearly spewed blood.

“Hah…” Chu Feng sneered. “You fool. I lied. I can’t change the nature of the Gate of the Masses anymore. You can’t enter the Infernal Realm even if you wanted to.”

“It was a lie?”

The crowd examined the Gate of the Masses and noticed that there was no change in its aura. Chu Feng was indeed lying earlier. Jia Lingyi couldn’t have entered the Infernal Realm even if she wanted to.

“You looked so fierce earlier, so I wanted to know if you really wanted to exact vengeance for your people. I have to say that you were much timider than I thought. You didn’t even dare to enter the Infernal Realm. Admit it. You don’t care about the life and death of those juniors at all,” Chu Feng said with narrowed eyes.

Jia Lingyi had never felt so infuriated before.

The crowd finally understood that Chu Feng had been toying with Jia Lingyi all this while, but the latter foolishly fell into his trap and was played like a fiddle.

“How long more do you need?” Jia Lingyi suddenly turned around and roared.

The crowd was baffled. Did this mean that Jia Lingyi had other means up her sleeves?

As a matter of fact, Jia Lingyi was addressing the woman who had crossed blows with Chu Feng earlier.

“I’m ready. Should I begin now?”

The woman opened her eyes. Her reddened cheeks showed that she had recovered from the earlier backlash she had suffered from using her sword.

Seeing a ray of hope in this fight, Jia Lingyi revealed a smirk. She returned into the warship, marched toward the woman, and asked, “Are you confident of success?”

“I have buried a formation core talisman inside the All Lives Are Equal Palace. Everything is already in place, except for your people. Whether it’ll succeed this time around or not depends on whether your people are able to hold on,” the woman said.

“Relay my orders. All sect members are to hold on even at the cost of their lives. We have to succeed this time around!” Jia Lingyi ordered.

An elder immediately rushed toward the depths of the hall to relay the orders.

“I’ll be heading over now.” The woman rose to her feet and headed into the depths of the warship.

Jia Lingyi turned around to look at Chu Feng one last time. The protective formations around the warship prevented Chu Feng from seeing her, but she was able to clearly see him.

“Chu Feng, let’s see how long you can remain smug!” Jia Lingyi sneered.

While Chu Feng couldn’t hear her words, he knew that she wouldn’t let this matter off that easily. However, he wasn’t worried at all. He raised his hand, and the humongous scroll in the sky began contracting before falling into his grasp.

The crowd eyed the scroll in Chu Feng’s hand, curious to know what it was. However, Chu Feng rolled the scroll up and stowed it away in his Cosmos Sack.

“Chu Feng, aren’t you going to take a look at it?” Eggy asked.

“There’s no need for that. I have already grasped the formation,” Chu Feng replied.

“You have?” Eggy was surprised.

“Yes. I have already comprehended the formation long before I feigned death to lure those fools in. How else do you think those fools died?” Chu Feng replied gleefully.
