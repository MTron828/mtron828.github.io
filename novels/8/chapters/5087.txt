Chapter 5087: Cornered

“What kind of terrifying power is this?”

The crowd couldn’t help but shudder in fear looking at the barrier made out of black gaseous flames surrounding Chu Feng and Jiang Yuantai. It was an instinctive response arising from the malevolent nature of the black gaseous flame.

It felt like a force that had come not from hell.

“It’s asura power. Did Chu Feng find a treasure made out of asura power?” the Godwish Grandmother suggested.

Her words snapped the crowd out of their daze.

The black gaseous flame was indeed asura power, just that it was so powerful that it didn’t occur to them right away.

“Is it a treasure from the Asura Spirit World? Or does it mean that Chu Feng has…” Sima Xiangtu murmured with an uneasy frown.

Prince Brightsun had told him earlier that Chu Feng had entered the Asura Graveyard but died in the hellfire. Chu Feng had clearly somehow survived the hellfire, but it should have still been impossible for him to obtain the power of the Asura Graveyard.

He knew that because Yaoyao didn’t wield such power.

Yet, Chu Feng returned stronger than ever, and he even formed a powerful barrier made out of asura power. He had no choice but to think that this was related to the Asura Evil Spirits of the Asura Graveyard, and he knew just how terrifying they were.

With such thoughts in mind, he contemplatively lowered his gaze.

Shoosh!

Chu Feng raised his leg and stomped Jiang Yuantai down from the sky onto the ground. The sheer impact of the fall created a massive crater in the ground, and dust flew all over the place.

The crowd squinted their eyes to look through the dust, and they saw Chu Feng crushing Jiang Yuantai’s chest with his leg. To be exact, Chu Feng wasn’t just pinning Jiang Yuantai down but literally crushing his ribcage, putting him in a pitiful plight.

At the same time, Chu Feng pointed the sword in his hand at Jiang Yuantai.

Faced with such a situation, Jiang Yuantai’s body froze up. Jiang Kongping was stunned too. This scene was familiar to the two of them because they had seen it in the prophecy. Everything had really unraveled according to the prophecy!

“Chu Feng, if you dare touch our young master, I’ll guarantee that none of you will be leaving this place alive!” Jiang Taibai hollered.

An aura seeped out of his body, and his cultivation rose from rank two Half-God to rank three Half-God.

“You speak as if you would have spared me otherwise,” Chu Feng sneered.

Without any hesitation, he plunged his sword into Jiang Yuantai’s eye.

“You bastard!”

Jiang Taibai whipped out an Exalted Armament saber and swung it down.

Boom!

Golden light irradiated the world. A massive martial power saber that was tens of thousands of meters in length fell from the clouds to hack Chu Feng down.

Boom!

Yet, similar to the earlier golden palm, this powerful strike shattered upon contact with the barrier of black gaseous flame.

“My gosh! Even an attack of this caliber is unable to breach the barrier?”

The crowd was conflicted looking at the dissipated golden fragments falling from the sky. They couldn’t clearly perceive Jiang Taibai’s earlier attack, but they did feel the terrifying aura behind it. It was so powerful that they had no doubt that it would have taken their lives if it was directed toward them.

Yet, it couldn’t faze the barrier of gaseous black flame at all!

Wu!

The Ox-nosed Old Daoist suddenly let out a groan.

It turned out that one of the Half-God level elders of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect had discreetly made his way over to the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s side to stab his body.

“Chu Feng, release our young master right now or else I’ll kill your master!” the elder shouted.

Chu Feng glanced at the elder. He didn’t say a word, but the viciousness in his eyes deepened.

Pu!

He pushed his sword through Jiang Yuantai’s dantian.

“Stop!!!”

Those from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect were horrified.

“Step away from my master right away, or else I’ll take his life!” Chu Feng said menacingly.

The elder was conflicted. He was hoping to force Chu Feng to release Jiang Yuantai by holding the Ox-nosed Old Daoist hostage, but it only prompted him to inflict harm on Jiang Yuantai instead. The vicious look on Chu Feng’s face made it clear that he wasn’t just joking around.

So, he quickly released the Ox-nosed Old Daoist and backed away.

“Chu Feng, don’t hurt my older brother anymore!” Jiang Kongping suddenly spoke up.

Upon hearing that request, Chu Feng pulled his blade out of Jiang Yuantai’s dantian.

“Jiang Kongping, you pleaded for my behalf that day. I’d have killed your older brother otherwise no matter what anyone else said, but since you have spoken up, I’ll spare him for today. Go and treat your older brother.”

Chu Feng dissipated the barrier of gaseous black flames with a wave of his hand before throwing Jiang Yuantai toward Jiang Kongping.

“This…”

The cultivators of the Nine Souls Galaxy were stunned. Chu Feng’s actions were utterly incomprehensible to them. He could have used Jiang Yuantai as a hostage to force the Pill Dao Immortal Sect into submission, but instead, he actually gave Jiang Yuantai back to them.

He even dissipated the barrier of gaseous black flames that was protecting him. Wasn’t he asking to be killed?

Those from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect were perplexed too. They had no idea what Chu Feng was up to. Nevertheless, they dared not to carelessly make a move upon recalling what he had done thus far.

Shoosh!

While everyone was trying to figure out Chu Feng’s intention, Jiang Taibai waved his hand and conjured a golden object from his hand. It was originally extremely small, but it swiftly enlarged into a thousand-meters-tall golden gate.

The golden gate opened, and countless silhouettes darted out from within.

“This is bad!”

The cultivators of the Nine Souls Galaxy despaired upon seeing the figures coming out from the golden gate. They were all members of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect, and every single one of them was extremely powerful.

There were several hundred Half-God level cultivators amongst them and countless more Martial Exalted level cultivators.

All in all, they numbered more than a million.

With the appearance of this army of million cultivators, Sima Xiangtu’s puppet army suddenly didn’t seem like a big deal anymore.

All of them quickly formed a tight encirclement around Chu Feng.

“Spit it out! What is the power you have just used?” Jiang Taibai questioned.

It turned out that they were only sparing Chu Feng for the time being in order to find out what he had been through and the means he had acquired.

“What if I refuse to speak?” Chu Feng answered.

“Hmph!”

Jiang Taibai harrumphed coldly. He glanced at the army of cultivators and ordered, “Set up the formation!”

The million cultivators of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect immediately got into position and quickly started setting up a formation. Even Jiang Taibai also joined in as well. Within moments, a massive net made out of blinding golden light covered the sky, trapping Chu Feng and the cultivators of the Nine Souls Galaxy within.

The cultivators of the Nine Souls Galaxy, including the Godwish Grandmother and the Lady of Dao Sea, fell in despair upon seeing the massive formation. They could sense just how powerful the formation was.

“What’s this? Are you trying to put up a performance?”

However, Chu Feng remained fearless.

“Chu Feng, take a good look at the situation you’re in. You’re already cornered. If you obediently follow our orders, we might still consider sparing you from a world of pain,” Jiang Taibai said.

“Cornered?” Chu Feng remarked with a chuckle.

Then, his eyes suddenly turned sharp.

Boom!

There was a loud explosion as Chu Feng suddenly morphed into a surge of gaseous black flame and dashed straight at the golden formation constructed by the million cultivators of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect. The golden formation hardly put up any fight against the sheer destruction might of the gaseous black flame, shattering almost right away.

“How is that possible?”

The crowd was dumbfounded. The terrifying golden formation was actually torn apart by Chu Feng as if it was just a flimsy piece of paper.

While everyone was stunned by the situation, a massive spirit formation gate opened up in front of Chu Feng. The next moment, everyone began shuddering out of fear. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Countless figures darted out from the spirit formation gate, and every single one of them carried an intimidating aura. To make things worse, there were more than ten million of them. The Asura World Spirit Army swiftly spread out and covered the entire sky.

They were superior to the Pill Dao Immortal Sect’s army of million cultivators, be it in terms of physique, aura or number of troops. It took mere moments for them to completely surround them.

Standing before the terrifying Asura World Spirit Army, the crowd suddenly found it hard to breathe. They didn’t even dare to mutter a word at all. Such was the case for the previously arrogant members of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect too.

While everyone was shuddering in fear, Chu Feng’s voice broke the silence.

“Jiang Taibai, who did you say was cornered?”
