Chapter 3007 - Trapped at The Bottom Of The Lake

With lightning covering his entire body, Chu Feng continued to dive down into the lake following its undercurrents. His speed was very fast.

“Chu Feng, what’s going on? That lightning on your body...?” Her Lady Queen was very puzzled. She originally thought that falling into the lake would mean certain death.

The reason for that was because even she could sense how frightening the lake water was.

The lake was soaring with heat. It was as if it were capable of burning everything.

Because of that, Her Lady Queen had never imagined that Chu Feng would be unharmed after entering the lake. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

As for that, it was due to the lightning emitted from Chu Feng’s body.

Not only was the lightning covering Chu Feng completely, but it also covered Chu Youyuan completely.

That said, the lightning did not seem to be under Chu Feng’s control. Rather, it was flowing out by itself.

It could be said that it was Chu Feng’s Heavenly Lightning Bloodline’s instinctual reaction.

“I also do not know what’s happening. However, I think Lord Youyuan does,” Chu Feng looked to Chu Youyuan.

Chu Youyuan was unconscious.

That sneak attack from Chu Zhiyuan’s grandfather had very seriously injured Chu Youyuan. Even though Chu Feng had already treated his wound, it was still not very effective.

That was understandable too. For someone of Chu Youyuan’s cultivation, only an injury to his soul would cause him to fall unconscious. Unfortunately... even Chu Feng was powerless to help him with his current injury.

“It would appear that this Chu Youyuan knew that it was safe to escape into this place. It seems that he truly possesses a deep understanding of the Nine Moons Sacred Domain. He’s not an Utmost Exalted Elder yet, he possesses strength surpassing that of ordinary Utmost Exalted Elders. That old man is not simple at all,” Her Lady Queen had a high evaluation of Chu Youyuan. After all, it was Chu Youyuan who saved Chu Feng and her.

“Oh, that’s right. Chu Feng, how’s this old man’s injury? He won’t die, right?” Her Lady Queen asked.

“I am unable to cure Lord Youyuan’s injury. The situation is not very good. However, it is not a danger to his life. That said, I have no idea when he will wake up,” Chu Feng said.

“It’s good as long as he’s not going to die. Chu Feng, say, where do you think this undercurrent will lead you? Could it be another exit?” Her Lady Queen asked.

“I hope that there’s another exit. In that case, we can make them pay,” Chu Feng said.

Chu Feng was feeling very helpless at that moment. Even though he had escaped a calamity, the power of the lake water was still extremely strong. Now that he was inside the lake, Chu Feng could only follow the flow of the undercurrent. He had no idea where it would lead him.

Furthermore, the undercurrent was extremely fast. Yet, he was still unable to see the end even after drifting in it for so long. From this, it could be seen that the lake was much larger than Chu Feng had originally anticipated.

While the lake looked like a lake from the outside, it would be more fitting to describe it as an entire world on the inside. After all, the inside of the lake was simply too enormous.

With a very fast speed, Chu Feng continued to drift down for an entire day.

After a day of drifting, Chu Feng finally arrived at the bottom of the lake. After reaching the bottom, the undercurrent disappeared, and he regained the freedom to move around.

“You’ve finally reached the bottom after drifting for so long. Exactly how deep is this lake?” Even Her Lady Queen opened her mouth with astonishment.

As for Chu Feng, he was looking up.

Even though he was still inside the lake, the water above him was filled with undercurrents.

“Woosh~~~”

Suddenly, Chu Feng sprang upward rapidly.

However, right after leaping forth, Chu Feng’s movement stopped. The next moment, he was sent back down by the powerful undercurrent.

“Those undercurrents are too powerful. It’s simply impossible to go against them. Not to mention you, I doubt that old man would be capable of it either,” Her Lady Queen said.

“I hope that there’s another way out so that I will not have to be trapped to death in here,” Chu Feng started to frown. They all said that one must leave the Nine Moons Sacred Domain before it closed, or else one would lose one’s life in here.

And at that moment, Chu Feng was trapped at the bottom of the lake with no idea how to get out. With this, how could he not be worried?

Even though he was worried, Chu Feng did not lose his fighting spirit. On the contrary... his fighting spirit was aroused.

Carrying Chu Youyuan on his back, Chu Feng began to quickly travel across the bottom of the lake. Chu Feng wanted to find a way out.

However, after Chu Feng walked for several hours, he was still unable to find an exit. The bottom of the lake was simply too big and vast, so much so that Chu Feng was unable to make any assessment of its actual size. Furthermore, as the lake water was too powerful, Chu Feng’s Heaven’s Eyes ended up being restricted too.

In fact, even Chu Feng’s perception was greatly restricted. At that moment, he was like a headless fly, not knowing where to go or how to leave.

However, even with this being the case, Chu Feng’s fighting spirit was still burning strong. He still persisted.

The reason for that was because Chu Feng knew that he couldn’t die, that he still had a lot of things that he had to do.

He still hadn’t met his mother yet. He still hadn’t found his grandfather yet. There were still a lot of enemies that he had to root out. Chu Feng could not afford to die. He must continue living.

And, being trapped there, Chu Feng would end up dying should the time limit arrive.

There was no one he could rely on. He could only rely on himself. If even he himself decided to give up, he would really end up waiting for death.

“Chu Feng, let me out. We can search separately. I will help you find the exit,” Her Lady Queen said with concern.

“No, absolutely not. This lake is too powerful. The clones that I’ve created with my world spirit techniques will be immediately annihilated the moment they leave the lightning around my body. I do not wish for you to take on this sort of risk,” Chu Feng refused Her Lady Queen’s request without the slightest hesitation.

“No matter what, this Queen is from the Asura Spirit World. You’re completely fine in here; how could I not be fine too?” Her Lady Queen refused to accept Chu Feng’s decision.

“Milady Queen, I know very well how strong you are. However, this place is truly special. I cannot allow you...”

Whilst urging Her Lady Queen against coming out, Chu Feng suddenly turned his gaze backwards and loudly shouted, “Who is it?!”

Chu Feng heard a sound. However, when he turned around, he was unable to see anything in that direction.

“Chu Feng, what’s wrong?”

Her Lady Queen shared Chu Feng’s vision and hearing. However, there was nothing present at the location Chu Feng had looked to. Thus, Her Lady Queen was very confused by Chu Feng’s sudden shout.

“I felt as if there were someone behind me just then,” Chu Feng said.

“That shouldn’t be the case, no? How could there be someone in a place like this?” Her Lady Queen asked.

“I’m unable to sense anything behind me right now. However, I definitely sensed it earlier,” Chu Feng said.

“Could it be that you’re overly exhausted, and started having hallucinations?” Her Lady Queen was worried.

The reason for that was because Chu Feng was not simply traveling across the bottom of the lake. He was also carefully observing his surroundings and exhausting his spirit power to examine everything.

To examine one’s surroundings so thoroughly was actually quite exhausting, and it was quite a burden on Chu Feng.
