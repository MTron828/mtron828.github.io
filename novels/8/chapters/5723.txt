Chapter 5723: Secret Skill Overlapped With Taboo Skill

“Long Tenghui?”

The Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief and the Totem Dragon Clansmen could hardly hold back their anger upon seeing the nine elders.

Those nine elders had committed grievous sins deserving of death, but the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief showed mercy to them and only exiled them. Yet, they knew not of gratitude and defected to Long Lin’s side during the revolt.

Many of the Totem Dragon Clansmen had died in their hands during the revolt.

“Lord Clan Chief, were you planning to impart our Totem Dragon Clan’s bloodline cultivation skill to an outsider? It looks like we were right to follow Lord Long Lin. You aren’t worthy of being the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief,” Long Tenghui said.

With a wave of his sleeve, a golden net was cast from the sky. He was intending to trap Chu Feng and the others here till Long Lin arrived.

“Small fry like you hope to trap me?” the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief roared as he released his oppressive might.

Not only did the golden net instantaneously shatter, but even Long Tenghui and the others were caught in it as well.

“This isn’t good.” Long Tenghui and the others immediately knew they were in trouble.

The Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief was somehow still able to exert his cultivation. He couldn’t unleash his full strength, but it was beyond Long Tenghui and the others’ means to deal with.

Thus, Long Tenghui and the others immediately tried to escape.

However, the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief raised his hand, and with a clench of his fists, and Long Tenghui and the others were reduced to dust. Their existence was wiped from the face of the world just like that; even their origin energies had dissipated.

“What a pity,” Chu Feng murmured, thinking that he could have put their origin energies to good use.

Pu!

Even though the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief destroyed Long Tenghui and the others in a single move, he spat fresh blood right after. Weakness consumed him, as he struggled to even maintain his balance.

“Lord Father!”

“Lord Clan Chief!”

Long Chengyu and the others rushed forward to support the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief, but the latter’s condition only continued to worsen. He had paid a heavy price to temporarily free himself from his restraints to kill Long Tenghui and the others.

Meanwhile, Long Lin continued infusing his own bloodline into the formation, fearing that a mishap might befall Long Xue. He had no idea how to dispel the formation; this was the only way he knew to curb the formation.

All of a sudden, he noticed something amiss on the dragon inscription compass, and that brought a frown to his face.

“He isn’t fully restrained?”

Through the compass, Long Lin could tell that the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief had freed himself from his restraints and exerted his cultivation. Most likely, the nine elders whom he had sent after the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief were already dead.

Even so, Long Lin was still more worried about Chu Feng getting away. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Knowing that he couldn’t let the situation be, a determined glint flashed across his eyes as he mumbled, “Young friend Chu Feng, don’t blame me for this.”

While infusing his bloodline power into Long Xue’s body with one hand, Long Lin reached into his Cosmos Sack with the other to retrieve two items.

One of them was an ancient beastskin leather that carried a dragon insignia and the word ‘Taboo’. The other one was a golden dragon scale that emanated an incomparably domineering aura—it was the ancestral dragon’s scale.

He slit his palm with the dragon scale before infusing his fresh blood and martial power into it. The dragon scale transformed into a whiff of golden aura that fused into the beastskin leather, inducing a change in its formation.

Long Lin gritted his teeth as his body trembled uncontrollably and his face warped in pain.

…

Uwa!

Chu Feng and the Totem Dragon Clansmen suddenly felt a pang of excruciating pain that made a lot of them wail in agony. The dragon’s beard emerging from the ground had suddenly become much stronger, to the point they looked tangible.

All of a sudden, none of them could move anymore.

Despite the immense pain she was under, Long Muxi looked at Chu Feng with worried eyes, asking, “What’s wrong, Chu Feng?”

The crowd turned to Chu Feng as well, only to see that he was in a worse situation than them. The dragon’s beard around him was emanating energy far stronger than those on them.

On top of that, there was something within him emanating a glow so bright that it could be seen outside. This thing was inflicting unbelievable pain on him.

Soon, runes started to pour out from the dragon essence, first covering his soul, followed by his body, before fusing together with the dragon’s beard binding him.

“Those runes… It’s our ancestral dragon’s secret skill! That darned Long Lin! How can he go this far?” the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief roared in anger.

“I was indeed duped by him,” Chu Feng scoffed.

It was clear to him what was happening even without the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief saying a word. There was a hidden formation inside the dragon essence that had eluded his notice, and this formation sought to assimilate his soul to further elevate the dragon essence.

In other words, Long Lin had been lying to him right from the start. He had never intended to allow Chu Feng to survive this ordeal.

“Lord Father, what’s that?” Long Muxi and Long Chengyu anxiously asked the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief.

“The ancestral dragon’s secret skill has been sealed for a long time, and our clansmen aren’t allowed to touch it. I have never seen anyone activating it in person; I have only read about it in historical records. The ancestral dragon’s secret skill comes in many forms, but all require great sacrifices. I don’t know which one Long Lin has planted inside young friend Chu Feng,” the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“Lord Father, is there a way to save Brother Chu Feng?” Long Chengyu asked.

The Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief shook his head and replied, “There’s no way to undo the ancestral dragon’s secret skill.”

Weng!

Just as those words were said, Chu Feng formed a hand seal and focused his full attention on channeling the formation inside him. Astonishingly, the rate at which the runes were spreading slowed down.

However, there was no joy to be seen on the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief’s face, as he knew that it was all futile.

Even though Chu Feng could still barely hold on for the time being with his means, he was only delaying the inevitable. What he was up against was not just Long Lin’s means but the strength of the ancestral dragon’s secret skill.

It was thanks to the ancestral dragon that the Totem Dragon Clan enjoyed its current prosperity. Even though the ancestral dragon was severely weakened on its deathbed, so the secret skill it had cast on its dying breath was nowhere near its true strength, it was still power beyond their reach.

The Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief wouldn’t have been able to do anything about it even if his cultivation hadn’t been sealed.

Oblivious to them, there were two other people present in the vicinity. They had witnessed the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief killing Long Tenghui and the others. They were none other than Daoist Heavensniffer and Beast Shadow.

Both of them were extremely careful, choosing not to show themselves but instead observe the situation from a far distance through the use of a treasure and special means.

“It looks like Chu Feng is on the verge of death,” Beast Shadow said as he readied himself to charge in and apprehend Chu Feng.

He wasn’t worried about Chu Feng’s safety. He only wanted to fulfill the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master’s order, which was to bring Chu Feng back alive.

But Daoist Heavensniffer stopped him right away.

“Don’t move. Someone else is here.”
