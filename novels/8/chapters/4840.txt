Chapter 4840: Disappearance

“Chu Feng, are you saying that you have to break this calamity by yourself without relying on any external power?” the sectmaster asked.

“I’m not certain about it, but that’s indeed what I’m thinking,” Chu Feng replied.

The sectmaster thought about it for a moment before saying, “We shouldn’t do it since you aren’t certain. The calamity won’t remain forever. If we are unable to breach it, we can just leave the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect temporarily and return after it’s all over. Even if the calamity doesn’t dissipate by itself, we’d surely be able to find a way to overcome it with sufficient time. There’s no need for you to put your life on the line.”

Zi Ling and Duan Liufeng were surprised. They never expected to hear those words from the sectmaster.

She was actually trying to persuade Chu Feng not to risk his life!

Chu Feng felt touched by her sentiment.

The sectmaster’s attitude toward him in the past was extremely harsh, but she was showing concern for him right now. It was as if she had turned into a different person altogether. While he was delighted by this development, he was finding it hard to get used to it.

“All of this happened due to me, so I should be the one to end things here. Lord Sectmaster, please allow me to give it a try,” Chu Feng clasped his fist and said.

While Chu Feng was touched by the sectmaster’s concern, he was still determined to give it a try. In truth, he had already figured out a way to overcome the calamity.

It was just that it was all speculation at the moment, so he wasn’t willing to share too much into it lest he gave them false hope.

The sectmaster was opposed to this, but Chu Feng’s determined eyes caused her mind to waver.

“Sectmaster, let him give it a try.”

Even Duan Liufeng was speaking in support of Chu Feng.

It was not that he wasn’t worried about Chu Feng, but this matter had massive implications. He wanted to give it a try as long as there was a sliver of hope here.

Zi Ling didn’t speak a single word all this while; she simply looked at Chu Feng silently. While she was a disciple of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, Chu Feng’s safety was more important to her than anything else. If she could have her way, she wouldn’t want Chu Feng to go.

But at the same time, she knew just what kind of person Chu Feng was. She decided to simply respect his decision.

“Are you certain?” the sectmaster asked.

“Yes, I’m certain,” Chu Feng replied.

“Good. Follow me.”

The sectmaster led Chu Feng, Duan Liufeng, and Zi Ling back to the Hidden Dragon Square. The elders and disciples were still in the area.

Panic and fear could be seen on everyone’s faces, and their words fully showcased their feelings too. They thought that Chu Feng had escaped, so they began to hurl insults at him. All sorts of nasty words could be heard.

They knew that this was a means from the sect founder and that Chu Feng couldn’t really be blamed for it despite being the one to trigger it, but they still couldn’t help but to find someone to vent their emotions.

“Silence!” a voice bellowed.

The noisy square immediately fell silent upon hearing that voice.

The sectmaster had returned together with Chu Feng, Duan Liufeng, and Zi Ling.

Everyone thought that Chu Feng and the others had been captured by the sectmaster, and that the sectmaster was going to execute them. Unexpectedly, the sectmaster turned to the crowd and said, “You should have seen what happened earlier. The Hidden Dragon Heavenly God Formation isn’t enough to break this calamity. However, Chu Feng still doesn’t want to give up. He wishes to challenge the calamity once more with his own strength in hopes of finding a way out.”

The crowd looked at one another in astonishment.

“Chu Feng wishes to challenge the calamity all on his own? Isn’t that courting death?!”

No one believed that Chu Feng could succeed, but most of them still respected Chu Feng for his courage.

“His bravery is something that our sect members ought to learn from. He has chosen not to fight for himself but our entire Hidden Dragon Martial Sect. Regardless of whether he succeeds or not, I shan’t allow any voices of criticisms directed toward him within the Hidden Martial Dragon Sect anymore!” the sectmaster ordered.

All of the elders and disciples who had insulted Chu Feng earlier lowered their heads in shame. They thought that Chu Feng had fled out of fear, but it turned out that they were wrong.

On the other hand, Chu Feng also finally understood the sectmaster’s intention.

The calamity enveloped the whole of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect. It didn’t matter where Chu Feng tackled the calamity from; there was no reason for him to return to the Hidden Dragon Square. Nevertheless, the sectmaster still brought him over to let everyone know that he was going to challenge the calamity once more.

She was hoping to right Chu Feng’s name so that he would no longer be the sinner of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect.

“Chu Feng, are you ready?” the sectmaster asked.

“I’m ready, Lord Sectmaster,” Chu Feng clasped his fist and replied.

“Go on then.”

Shoosh!

Chu Feng rose into the sky, but this time around, he was no longer a ten thousand meters tall giant. He was fighting the calamity all alone with his small body that looked miserably insignificant in comparison.

It didn’t take long for his silhouette to vanish amidst the calamity. No one could see his silhouette or feel his aura.

It felt no different from an ant falling into the ocean, disappearing without even stirring the slightest ripple.

Zi Ling clenched her fists tightly as she stared at the dark clouds and violet lightning above her with unblinking eyes. Her heart was quivering with worry because she knew that the odds were stacked against Chu Feng.

Even she had no idea how Chu Feng could possibly break this calamity.

The crowd waited for a while, but Chu Feng’s silhouette still showed no signs of reappearing. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

At this point, even those who had never crossed paths with Chu Feng couldn’t help but pace around nervously. Putting aside the fact that Chu Feng was their only hope now, they also hoped that no mishap would occur to him. It would leave a bitter taste in their mouth if their savior were to lose his life like that.

Hu hu hu!

All of a sudden, the calamity in the sky started to retreat. The terrifying destructive energy it harnessed seemed to be weakening, and the rumbling thunder quietened down a little.

Everyone was initially still uncertain about it, but it soon became apparent that the calamity was indeed dissipating.

“The calamity is dissipating! It really is!”

“Chu Feng succeeded! He really managed to break this calamity all on his own!”

The crowd was overjoyed. Everything still looked bleak a moment ago, but a ray of hope suddenly shone upon them just like that. None of them could have even fathomed that Chu Feng could have succeeded here.

It turned out that they had underestimated Chu Feng.

Chu Feng really managed to pull off the impossible!

“Incredible! As expected of the most talented prodigy of our Hidden Dragon Martial Sect! Is that the reason why he was able to trigger the calamity in the first place? Perhaps, the sect founder knew that the person who could trigger the calamity would surely be able to resolve it too!”

All of the insults toward Chu Feng earlier on turned into compliments.

However, when the calamity fully disappeared and a blue sky was returned to them, the cheering crowd suddenly began to quieten down.

They finally realized that something was amiss here.

Shoosh!

Zi Ling was the first one to react. She darted into the sky and began searching the area. Duan Liufeng, Xia Yan, and a few others quickly followed suit.

They were searching for Chu Feng.

The calamity might have vanished, but Chu Feng was nowhere to be seen too.

“Chu Feng! Chu Feng!!!”

The voices calling out for Chu Feng grew numerous, and more and more people were joining the search party. It wasn’t just those who were on good terms with Chu Feng that were searching now. Even the elders and disciples whom he had never met before helped out too.

It was just that no one was able to find him.

Chu Feng had vanished together with the calamity!
