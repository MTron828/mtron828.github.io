Chapter 5387: Final Showdown

“But…” Lord Shuang Yu looked hesitant.

“Young master Jie Zhou, I’ll be frank with you. I could have helped you if it was anyone else, but Chu Feng has made great contributions to the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion through what happened in the Ancient Palace. Furthermore, his talents suggest that there is more to his background than we know about. Even if we put that aside, he came here under Lord Deranged Exalted’s recommendation. I fear that Lord Deranged Exalted won’t turn a blind eye to it if we lay our hands on him.”

“Lord Shuang Yu, Lord Deranged Exalted has already left the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. There’s no reason for us to fear him,” Jie Zhou said.

“I am not afraid of Lord Deranged Exalted, but what I am concerned about is his relationship with Lord Nianqing… If Lord Nianqing finds out that we harmed Chu Feng, we won’t get away scot-free,” Lord Shuang Yu said.

“All we have to do is to ensure that my grandmother doesn’t find out that we framed Chu Feng. We just need everyone to think that Chu Feng had it coming. I have already prepared a plan for that. As long as we insist that it’s all Chu Feng’s fault, my grandmother won’t blame us for this,” Jie Zhou said.

“Will Chu Feng go through such humiliation for Bai Yunqing?” Lord Shuang Yu asked.

“It’ll be best if everything goes according to my plan, but if he stubbornly refuses to comply, we’ll just have to kill him. A dead man can’t speak anyway,” Jie Zhou said with a vicious glint in his eyes.

Lord Shuang Yu remained hesitant.

“Lord Shuang Yu, you should also know how much my grandmother dotes on me, or else she wouldn’t have acknowledged me to be her grandson. I might not be her real grandson, but our relationship is as good as that. Do you think that she can bear to see me suffer such grievances in the hands of an outsider?” Jie Zhou asked.

Lord Shuang Yu fell into a dilemma. That was also what she was concerned about. She had insider details regarding this matter that even Jie Zhou was oblivious to.

Lord Nianqing had taken Jie Zhou to her grandson not just because he was the prophesied child but because he shared a resemblance with her child, Jie Ranqing, back when she was younger.

Back then, Jie Ranqing committed a grievous mistake and was severely punished by the clan. Lord Nianqing tried to intervene, but she was unable to save her daughter or her grandson. That filled her with self-reproach.

To cope with her loss, she channeled her feelings onto Jie Zhou and took him in as her grand godson. She treated him well as a way to make it up to her real grandson, who never got to be born in this world.

That incident was also what caused Lord Nianqing to lose faith in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. Currently, she was nothing more than a sinner trapped in this land.

While Lord Nianqing was usually a righteous person who frowned on oppression, there was a good chance that she might value Jie Zhou enough to bend her principles and even overlook her ties with her old friends. After all, she did dote on Jie Zhou a lot over the years.

To further drive the point in, Jie Zhou even burst into tears of grievance.

“Lord Shuang Yu, you watched me grow up. Even if my grandmother doesn’t care about me, are you not going to care about me too?” he cried.

Those were obviously fake tears, yet they struck a chord in Lord Shuang Yu’s heart.

Indeed, Jie Zhou is an exception.

Both she and her sister had always prioritized Jie Zhou’s will out of loyalty to Lord Nianqing, but over the years, she had unknowingly started to dote on Jie Zhou as well. She didn’t like it either when Jie Zhou was being bullied by an outsider.

At this point, she made up her mind and said, “Young master Jie Zhou, I’ll help you. However, this matter mustn’t reach Lord Nianqing’s ears. My older sister must never hear about this too.”

Jie Zhou hurriedly nodded his head. “I promise to keep this matter a secret. No one else will ever hear about it!”

…

Twenty hours had passed since Chu Feng had entered the blood-red spatial realm.

Through diligently collecting the bundles of light, he had reached Heaven Realm and was now capable of flight.

Boom boom boom!

Yet another loud rumble sounded. The specter-like wails grew even closer.

Chu Feng could clearly spot blood-red light pillars appearing on the distant horizon. Those were where the terrifying wails were coming from. Those blood-red light pillars seemed to be slowly sealing away the spatial realm, thus restricting the area one could maneuver in.

Another loud rumble echoed, and the area of the light pillars further narrowed.

At this rate, it wouldn’t be long before Chu Feng gets completely cornered by the blood-red light pillars. These blood-red light pillars harnessed terrifying strength that Chu Feng wouldn’t be able to fight against even if regained his cultivation.

Based on what he had observed thus far, the pillars would move once every fifteen minutes. Given the current proximity of the pillars, he had less than thirty minutes left. By then, he would have no choice but to confront the blood-red pillars.

“I need to quickly defeat that woman.” Chu Feng thought that the only way out was to defeat his rival here.

Weng!

A golden light pillar suddenly rose from the center of the realm. It shared the same aura as the golden bundles of light.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Without any hesitation, Chu Feng charged toward the golden light pillar. Given the tremendous amount of energy harnessed inside it, that could easily make the difference between victory and defeat.

It was time for the final showdown!
