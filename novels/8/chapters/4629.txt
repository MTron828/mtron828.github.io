After retreating from the battle, Gongsun Yuntian turned to his brothers and bellowed. The tone showed that it was a command.

Pu pu pu pu!

The remaining prodigies of the Gongsun Clan immediately raised their hands and pierced it into their chests. Those who didn’t know better would have thought that they were committing suicide.

But unexpectedly, they suddenly ripped something out of their chests.

Chu Feng and the others could see a special jadestone dripping with blood in the hands of those prodigies of the Gongsun Clan.

The jadestone was only the size of a small pearl, but it was shaped in the form of a heart. More importantly, despite being made out of jadestone, it was actually pulsating, just like a real heart.

There were two different powers circulating within the jadestone. One was the power intrinsic to the jadestone itself. It felt elusive and mysterious, and it would be wise not to underestimate it. As for the other, it was the power of the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace.

These two powers were fused together as one.

“It’s no wonder why you’re able to grasp the power of the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace. The Summoned Jadehearts are indeed in your hands! The Gongsun Clan is truly despicable!” Xia Yan berated out loud.

“It doesn’t matter that you know. You aren’t getting out of here with your lives anyway.”

Gongsun Yuntian thought nothing of Xia Yan’s outburst. Instead, he collected all of the Summoned Jadehearts and grasped them tightly in his hands. Without any hesitation, he pierced his hand into his left chest, where his heart was.

“Chu Feng, stop him! You can’t allow him to fuse together with all of the Summoned Jadehearts!”

Xia Yan and Xiao Yu flew into a fluster as they reminded Chu Feng at the same time. Clearly, they knew what the Summoned Jadehearts were.

“Don’t worry, let him do what he wants.”

But unexpectedly, Chu Feng wasn’t worried at all.

“You can’t! You don’t know just how formidable the Summoned Jadehearts are! You need to stop him!” Xia Yan bellowed anxiously.

She was so agitated that she was practically leaping all over the place.

However, Chu Feng remained completely unmoved. In fact, there was even a faint smile on his lips.

“Don’t worry, I have my own means to deal with him. Instead of rushing me, why don’t you tell me the origin of the Summoned Jadehearts instead? To be honest, I’m quite curious about it,” Chu Feng asked.

Chu Feng was certain that Gongsun Yuntian’s great strength stemmed from the Summoned Jadehearts, which made him rather intrigued about them.

Xia Yan and Xiao Yu were nearly anxious out of their minds, but the only one here who could stop Gongsun Yuntian was Chu Feng. If Chu Feng wasn’t intending to make a move, they couldn’t possibly do anything either. So, they began to explain the history behind the Summoned Jadehearts to him.

“It’s said that Summoned Jadehearts are an incredibly valuable energy stone in the Ancient Era. As long as one is able to fuse with it, one would be able to wrestle a portion of power from the formations in any ancient remnant to enhance one’s power. The larger the fused Summoned Jadehearts was, the greater the power wrestled over would be.

“It’s a consumable that can only be used once, but without a doubt, Summoned Jadehearts are the most useful treasures when it comes to exploring dangerous ancient remnants. However, they are extremely rare and expensive. It’s almost impossible to find them around anymore.

“However, just a few decades ago, a cultivator found a remnant in the Nine Souls Galaxy that contains a huge amount of Summoned Jadehearts. However, the remnant was extremely dangerous, such that it’s hard to enter its premises, let alone obtain the Summoned Jadehearts in there.

“In order to secure the Summoned Jadehearts, the Nine Souls Sacred Clan stood forward and rallied the Zhuge Clan, Gongsun Clan, as well as the major world spiritist powers in the Nine Souls Galaxy to clear the remnant together. It’s said that a lot of elusive world spiritists who have gone into seclusion joined the expedition too.

“A lot of world spiritists were needed to maintain the formation, so most people weren’t able to enter the remnant themselves. In the end, they could only task the Gongsun Clan to acquire the Summoned Jadehearts and bring them out.

“However, when the members of the Gongsun Clan left the remnant, they didn’t bring the anticipated Summoned Jadehearts back with them. They claimed that it wasn’t existent in the first place. In order to prove their innocence, they even allowed the Zhuge Clan and the other powers to search their bodies.

“The Summoned Jadehearts are valuable resources to world spiritists, which is why the Nine Souls Sacred Clan took charge of this expedition and rallied everyone together. Thus, the Zhuge Clan and the other powers didn’t stand on ceremony and searched the bodies of the Gongsun Clan. Unfortunately, they didn’t manage to find anything at all.

“Most of them were convinced that the Gongsun Clan had stolen the Summoned Jadehearts so that they could use it for themselves, but as they had no evidence, they could only let the matter rest. Nevertheless, due to that incident, many powers refused to work with the Gongsun Clan anymore.

“However, from the looks of it now, it’s obvious that the Gongsun Clan had taken all of the Summoned Jadehearts for themselves!”

Xia Yan explained to Chu Feng.

“The Gongsun Clan sure is despicable.”

After learning of the story, Chu Feng turned to direct a look of disdain at Gongsun Yuntian.

“Heh... So what about it? This is simply how the world is! There are no powers in the world that are completely upright and clean. Putting aside ur Gongsun Clan, even the host of this marriage convention, Lord Black Demon, has also committed plenty of evil deeds. Yet, has anyone dared to blame him for his misdeeds? Those who have tried to do so are nothing more than corpses in the ground by now!”

Gongsun Yuntian thought nothing of Chu Feng’s reaction. On the contrary, he appeared to be gleeful about it.

“I do agree that everyone has their own way of surviving in this world, but it’s morals that creates a distinction between humans and beasts. If you take pride in such underhanded means, I can only say that you aren’t worthy of being humans,” Chu Feng said.

“Hahaha! You want to look down on me, but do you have the ability to do so?”

All of a sudden, an overwhelming force burst forth from Gongsun Yuntian’s body. His spirit power was far stronger than before after having undergone further enhancements by the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace, making him far stronger than before.

This was the effect of fusing with even more Summoned Jadehearts.

“Hmph!”

In response to this devastating power, Chu Feng simply harrumphed coldly before forming a series of hand seals.

Boom!

Spirit power erupted from Chu Feng’s body like a spurting volcano, bursting forth with great force. His spirit power swiftly charged toward Gongsun Yuntian like an army of thousands of soldiers.

Chu Feng had used a special formation to further channel his spirit power, augmenting its might.

“I was wondering why you didn’t stop me, but it turns out that you have been secretly setting up a formation while I was fusing with the Summoned Jadehearts. Well, I would love to see if your formation is able to triumph over me.”

Gongsun Yuntian saw through Chu Feng’s tricks, but he remained fearless. With a furious howl, a great outburst of spirit power charged toward Chu Feng too.

Boom!

The showdown between the duo unfolded once more, just that it was much more intense than before. Just the shockwaves were more than enough to knock the other prodigies of the Gongsun Clan backward.

Even the formation barrier which Chu Feng had erected for Xia Yan and Xiao Yu had begun cracking under the relentless shockwaves. At this rate, it was only a matter of time before the barrier shattered.

“Those two fellows are truly terrifying.”

Even Xia Yan couldn’t help but remark before the formidable might displayed by the duo before her.

Xiao Yu wasn’t saying a word, but her dazed eyes reflected her astonishment as well.

Whoosh!

A sound reminiscent of shattering glass suddenly sounded as the barrier protecting Xia Yan and Xiao Yu broke down. This horrified the two of them.

One must know that the shockwaves were continuously rippling in their direction, and given their strength, they had no means to protect themselves.

However, in this critical moment, a silhouette suddenly appeared before them and pulled them together with him—Chu Feng.

Pulling the two of them close to him, Chu Feng quickly formed a hand seal to open a formation gate behind them.

The three of them unhesitatingly entered the formation gate, and it vanished right away too.

At the same time, Gongsun Yuntian retracted his power with a flick of his sleeves, and the shockwaves swiftly dissipated. All that was left was an empty cavern.

Gongsun Yuntian’s complexion turned incredibly awful.

“Yuntian, where are the three of them? Are they dead?”

The other prodigies of the Gongsun Clan ran over and asked.

“They got away,” Gongsun Yuntian said.

“They got away? How could that be?”

The other prodigies of the Gongsun Clan asked in astonishment.

“How am I to know? Useless things who only know how to cower at one corner, what use do I have for you?”

Gongsun Yuntian had already resorted to all of his means, but Chu Feng still managed to slip away under his eyelids. He was already infuriated, and the questions posed by his brothers only further fanned his rage. As a result, he ended up venting his anger on them.

The other prodigies immediately shut their mouths, knowing just what kind of temper Gongsun Yuntian had.

“Yuntian, it’s truly a relief that you’re here. If you weren’t here, that Chu Feng fellow wouldn’t have turned tail and fled.”

“Indeed! Our Yuntian is the best. That Chu Feng is not even worth a mention at all! He might have gotten away this time, but it’s only a matter of time before he falls to us!”

The prodigies of the Gongsun Clan quickly changed their tunes as they showered compliments on Gongsun Yuntian so as to improve his mood.

Pu!

But all of a sudden, Gongsun Yuntian lurched forward and spat huge mouthfuls of blood. Following that, his body tilted sideward before falling into the blood he had spat out.

“Chu Feng, I swear that I’ll definitely slaughter you!” Gongsun Yuntian vowed with gritted teeth, but his quivering voice showed that he was in a weakened state.

This sight left the other prodigies of the Gongsun Clan not daring to speak a word at all.

They knew that overusing the powers of the Summoned Jadehearts would pose a huge burden on one’s body, but Gongsun Yuntian’s current state wasn’t entirely due to that. It was obvious that he was severely injured at the moment.

It was no wonder why he was so angry.

It turned out that Chu Feng had actually managed to deal significant injuries to him in the earlier battle!
