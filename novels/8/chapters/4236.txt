Chapter 4236 - Yu Sha Appearing On Stage 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Is there anyone else that’s still unconvinced?”

Once Chu Feng raised that question, the crowd immediately turned absolutely quiet.

Even though this was the first time that the majority of them had met Chu Feng, he had been able to easily defeat Chen Guang.

Because of that, they knew that he possessed true strength.

An existence as powerful as him had most definitely grasped rank one Dragon Transformation Sensation.

Chen Guang was also someone that had grasped rank one Dragon Transformation Sensation.

Yet, he was still easily defeated.

This meant that Chu Feng possessed an extraordinarily strong battle power that far surpassed that of ordinary world spiritists.

Unless it was someone that had grasped rank two Dragon Transformation Sensation, who would possibly dare to challenge him?

“If no one is unconvinced, this reward will go to Chu Feng.”

Old Man Compliance spoke.

He noticed that after Chen Guang had been miserably defeated by Chu Feng, the others present did not dare to issue another challenge.

They were afraid of failure. After all, the price of being defeated by Chu Feng was enormous.

“I am unconvinced.”

Right at that moment, a voice was heard.

It was the dark-skinned fatty, Yue Yang.

“Yue Yang? He’s planning to issue a challenge?!”

Whilst Yue Yang’s reputation was not at all inferior to Chen Guang’s, the crowd all felt that since Chen Guang had been defeated, Yue Yang would only be asking for trouble by challenging Chu Feng.

Even though the crowd knew Yue Yang much better than Chu Feng, no one thought that he could win against Chu Feng.

“Introduce yourself,” said Old Man Compliance.

“I am the Heaven-plundering Grandmaster’s disciple, Yue Yang.”

“Chu Feng, I am unconvinced with you. But...if I am to challenge you, I demand to set the rules,” Yue Yang said to Chu Feng.

Even the bystanders were surprised by Yue Yang’s words.

He was clearly the challenger. How was he qualified to set the rules?

He was acting as if Chu Feng was the one challenging him.

This was completely unconventional.

Thus, after hearing those words, even Old Man Compliance narrowed his brows. He showed his displeasure, and was about to lash out at Yue Yang.

But, before Old Man Compliance could reprimand Yue Yang, Chu Feng spoke, “Very well. You decide the rules. As long as it’s not too excessive, I can accept anything.”

“He actually agreed to it?!”

The crowd felt a whole new level of respect for Chu Feng after hearing those words.

Especially after they saw how calm, composed and confident he looked.

They suddenly felt that Chu Feng was unfathomable.

His didn’t appear to be a pretense at all.

Compared to the surprise of the bystanders, Yue Yang was overjoyed.

“If that’s the case, then I, Yue Yang, will be blunt.”

“Milord, please let me in.”

Yue Yang clasped his fist toward Old Man Compliance.

Whilst Old Man Compliance was not fond of the manner in which Yue Yang had challenged Chu Feng, he did not say anything since Chu Feng had agreed to it.

After all, he had mentioned earlier that the challenger and Chu Feng would be the ones to determine the rules.

Because of that, he waved his sleeve and opened another spirit formation gate.

Yue Yang immediately entered the spirit formation gate. He was very eager. It was as if he was afraid that Chu Feng would back out.

“Brother Chu Feng, my condition is very simple.”

“We shall not fight. Instead, we will have our world spirits compete.”

“Our world spirits shall determine the outcome of the match,” Yue Yang said to Chu Feng with a beaming smile on his face.

“Compete with world spirits?”

The crowd immediately came to realize what Yue Yang had in mind upon hearing those words.

After all, it was common knowledge that Yue Yang’s world spirits were very powerful. After all, he was an Asura World Spiritist.

What the crowd didn’t know was that Yue Yang had challenged Chu Feng to a match with their world spirits before. At that time, Chu Feng had conceded.

That was also the reason why Yue Yang dared to challenge Chu Feng even after Chen Guang was defeated.

Yue Yang felt that it was likely true that Chu Feng’s world spirit techniques had been sealed away because of a treasure.

After all, the battle power of the world spirit technique that Chu Feng had displayed earlier had been truly astonishing.

But, world spirits were something that a world spiritist should possess a great amount of.

Yet, Chu Feng had told him that his world spirits were in closed-door training.

No one would acknowledge such a thing.

Yue Yang naturally didn’t believe it either.

As such, the only possible explanation would be that Chu Feng’s world spirits were not strong at all. That was why he was afraid and cowered before his previous challenge.

His world spirits being in closed-door training was merely an excuse.

Afraid that Chu Feng would not accept his challenge, Yue Yang asked provocatively, “Brother Chu Feng, you couldn’t possibly be afraid to accept my challenge, right?”

“Or could it be that you’re planning to tell me that your world spirits are still in closed-door training?”

After all, Chu Feng had refused and conceded in a match with world spirits back then.

“Speaking of it, it is truly a coincidence. My world spirit just so happened to have exited her closed-door training today.”

“This serves as the best opportunity to make up for the regret back then,” Chu Feng said with a smile.

He had anticipated that Yue Yang would challenge him to a match with world spirits.

Chu Feng’s agreement to his challenge had actually caused Yue Yang some slight discomfort.

But, as he had already shot the arrow, there was no way to retrieve it mid-flight. Besides, he was very confident in his world spirits. As such, Yue Yang did not cower, and instead opened his world spirit gate.

Three world spirits then walked out of his world spirit gate.

Seeing the three world spirits, the expressions of the crowd all changed.

Those three world spirits were not hiding their cultivations. As such, the crowd were all able to tell that they were all rank one Utmost Exalteds.

The three of them were all world spirits from the Asura Spirit World. Chu Feng had met one of them back then.

Back then, Yue Yang had only released a single world spirit. Yet at that moment, he had sent out three at once.

From this, it could be seen that Yue Yang was extremely serious.

“Amazing. He’s actually able to summon Utmost Exalted-level world spirits?”

Some among the crowd were astonished by Yue Yang’s ability to summon three rank one Utmost Exalted-level world spirits.

Even though they’d already heard of the might of Yue Yang’s world spirits, the world spirits they’d heard of were nowhere as powerful as the ones he had summoned. Yue Yang’s world spirits had grown stronger again.

Chu Feng did not rush to open his world spirit gate. Instead, he asked Yu Sha, “Yu Sha, how is it? This shouldn’t be an issue, no?”

“Open the gate,” Yu Sha replied with three words.

Once Chu Feng heard those words, a smile appeared on his face.

That was the personality that Yu Sha had. She spoke very little, but was most definitely not a pushover.

Back then, it was Yu Sha who had fought against Linghu Hongfei and had won Chu Feng the title of first place amongst the Ancestral Martial Decastars.

Her battle power was extremely astonishing.

Chu Feng opened his world spirit gate, and Yu Sha’s wonderful figure appeared before the crowd.

“That world spirit is so beautiful.”

“A world spirit giving off such an air is truly rare.”

“That must also be a world spirit from the Asura Spirit World, no? This Chu Feng is also an Asura World Spiritist?”

The eyes of many people changed upon seeing Yu Sha. Especially the men, their eyes were completely fixed onto her.

The people that were present were all prestigious people. All of them had seen countless beauties.

But, when they saw Yu Sha, they were still enchanted by her beauty.

The truth was that Yu Sha’s beauty was actually slightly inferior when compared to Eggy.

But, the airs that Yu Sha emitted was something very few people could compare to.

That alone was enough to intoxicate the crowd.

“Quite decent-looking. But I wonder, how are her skills?”

There was a bit of jealousy in Yue Yang’s tone.

Whilst they were both Asura World Spiritists, the appearance of his world spirits were unable to compare to Yu Sha.

But, he was not afraid. After all, what world spirits competed in was their strength.

But soon, Yue Yang’s expression changed. He turned to Chu Feng and asked, “Chu Feng, you couldn’t possibly be planning to take on my three world spirits with a single world spirit, right?”

Yue Yang had discovered that other world spirits had come out of Chu Feng’s world spirit gate.

Even though he was very surprised, he thought that Chu Feng might be planning to fight his three world spirits with a single world spirit.

“Is something wrong with that?” asked Chu Feng.

Hearing those words, Yue Yang was overjoyed. With a beaming smile, he said, “No, of course not. That’s your choice. If you lose, just don’t say that I’m bullying you with numbers.”

“Rest assured, I will not blame you,” said Chu Feng.

His words had confirmed Yue Yang’s guess.

At that moment, the others present were also unable to understand Chu Feng’s decision.

Yu Sha had not hidden her cultivation when she appeared. Thus, the crowd were able to sense that she was emitting the aura of a rank one Utmost Exalted.

There was naturally no issue with her cultivation. But, to take on three opponents was clearly unfair.

Was Chu Feng being excessively confident by doing this?

Or could it be that he did not have another rank one Utmost Exalted-level world spirit to fight in the confrontation?

Right when the crowd were making guesses, another voice sounded. When that voice was heard, the shock on the crowd’s faces grew even stronger.

“Go ahead and let out all your world spirits. I’ll handle all of them so that we won’t waste time here.”

It was Yu Sha that had spoken.

Her voice was very pleasant to hear, but her beautiful eyes were filled with contempt.
