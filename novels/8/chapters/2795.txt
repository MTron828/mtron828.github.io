Chapter 2795 - Cure Poison With Poison

“Brother Han Yu, please rest assured. I will definitely not waste your Clone Teleportation Talisman.”

“I will definitely return with Chu Feng’s head.”

With the Clone Teleportation Talisman in hand, Yuwen Hualong turned to walk toward the light pillar.

“Brother Hualong, we don’t have to be too excessive. We merely need to return to him what he has done. Thus, you don’t need to kill Chu Feng. It would do for you to merely cripple his cultivation.”

“Of course, you must bring him back and make him kneel before brother Tingyi. We will have him personally apologize to brother Tingyi,” Han Yu said.

“Very well, I’ll do as you say,” After he said those words, Yuwen Hualong walked into a pillar.

At that moment, Han Yu stood with his hands behind his back. He took a provocative glance at that Ancient Era’s Serpent Clan’s elder.

He seemed to be saying: ‘what can you all possibly do if I want to take care of Chu Feng?’

That Ancient Era’s Serpent Clan’s elder would naturally feel very displeased after seeing this sort of gaze. Merely, no matter how displeased he might be, he could not express his it. He could only endure his displeasure.

......

After passing through the pillar of light, Yuwen Hualong once again returned to the mountain.

Yuwen Hualong did not attempt to move around after entering the mountain. Instead, he directly sat cross-legged on the ground, took the Clone Teleportation Talisman from its case, and placed it between his palms.

“Buzz~~~”

The Clone Teleportation Talisman started to shine brightly with a faint blue light.

The next moment, countless blue lights began to fly out from Yuwen Hualong’s palm like a fountain.

When those blue lights landed on the ground, they started to expand in size. One by one, they took the form of Yuwen Hualong.

Not only did they have the same appearance and aura as Yuwen Hualong, but they were even wearing the same clothes as him.

Judging from the surface, they simply were Yuwen Hualong, simply no different from the actual body. Only Yuwen Hualong himself knew that all of them were merely clones.

The clones continued to shoot out of his clasped palms. In the blink of an eye, there were over a thousand clones around him.

According to the rumors, the Clone Teleportation Talisman was capable of creating a different amount of clones depending on the strength of its user. As for these thousand-plus clones, they should be Yuwen Hualong’s limit.

That being said, over a thousand clones should be more than sufficient to search for Chu Feng. As such, Yuwen Hualong also revealed a satisfied expression on his face.

“Woosh, woosh, woosh, woosh, woosh~~~”

Suddenly, with a thought from Yuwen Hualong, a burst of wind was raised in the area. As his clothes fluttered in the wind, all of his clones disappeared.

Those clones did not really disappear. Rather, they’d scattered about in all directions at an extremely fast speed.

What Yuwen Hualong planned to do was very simple. He was going to guard all of the pillars of light and wait for Chu Feng to appear. He firmly believed that as long as the Ancient Era’s Serpent Clan did not interfere, he would definitely be able to wait till Chu Feng’s arrival.

Chu Feng had no idea that Yuwen Hualong was waiting to ambush him.

Chu Feng was wholly concentrated on comprehending the spirit formation runes and symbols of Buried Spirit Lake.

He had quickly discovered that the best time to comprehend the contents of the runes and symbols would be during the instant when they assimilated with his soul.

Since he had discovered the mystery, then, with Chu Feng’s comprehension ability, he would naturally obtain a considerable harvest.

Since the eruption began, it had only been slightly less than half a day. Yet, Chu Feng had already managed to comprehend enough to reach Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist.

He had begun to attempt making a breakthrough to Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist.

“Wuu~~~”

However, right after Chu Feng started his breakthrough attempt, he suddenly grabbed his head with both of his hands. His expression started to twist with pain.

At that moment, an unbearable pain was being emitted from Chu Feng’s head. That sort of sensation felt as if Chu Feng’s head has been torn apart and was on the verge of exploding.

“Chu Feng, what’s wrong?” Her Lady Queen realized that something was amiss, and hurriedly questioned Chu Feng worriedly.

As for Chu Feng, he was currently being tormented by the pain, and was unable to even speak. His situation only started to ease after some time passed.

The current Chu Feng was already pale. A vast amount of sweat had covered his entire body, and was being mixed with the lake water.

From this, it could be seen how fierce of a pain Chu Feng had been suffering from earlier.

“Eggy, it might be very difficult for me to reach a breakthrough to Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist,” Chu Feng said.

“Why’s that? Why aren’t you able to reach a breakthrough to Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist? Could it be that what you’ve comprehended is incorrect?” Her Lady Queen felt very puzzled.

“No, it’s because the injury to my spirit power has still not healed,” Chu Feng said.

“Injury?”

“Could you be talking about the injury you received in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm from helping that Golden Crane True Immortal retrieve the God Bestowment Bamboo Slip?” Her Lady Queen asked.

“That’s right, it’s the injury from that time,” Chu Feng said.

“Damn it, that damned Golden Crane True Immortal! Why did he insist on making you retrieve that God Bestowment Bamboo Slip? It left you with an injury that you cannot heal completely. What are we to do now? Must you continue to stay at Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist forever?” At that moment, Her Lady Queen was feeling truly worried.

“You can’t blame him. I did it voluntarily,” Chu Feng said with a forced smile.

“Chu Feng, you don’t have to worry about it. After all, you are very talented. This injury of yours might not be completely incurable either. Although you’ve yet to completely recover from it right now, didn’t you still manage to make progress in your world spirit techniques?”

“You will definitely get better. You will one day recover completely.”

“Thus, there’s no need for you to be impatient,” Seemingly fearing that Chu Feng would feel burdened, even though she was extremely worried, Her Lady Queen decided to shift the topic, and started to comfort Chu Feng.

“I can’t wait. I cannot stay stagnant. This is a rare opportunity that I’ve obtained with great difficulty, I do not wish to miss it just like this,” Chu Feng said.

“What do you plan to do then?” Her Lady Queen asked.

“Among methods of curing injuries, there is one called ‘cure poison with poison.’ I wish to attempt that,” Chu Feng said.

“You mean to say...?” Her Lady Queen felt that this might be bad.

“Although it’s very painful, as long as I can endure it, I might be able to successfully reach a breakthrough. As long as I manage to successfully make my breakthrough, my spirit power will be completely renewed. Perhaps that might heal my injury completely,” Chu Feng said.

“No, that method is too cruel. Furthermore, it is also dangerous. What if it ends up making your injuries even worse? I do not wish for you to do this. I do not agree to it. This Queen is absolutely against it,” Her Lady Queen said with a serious face.

“My foolish Eggy, I am not stupid. If I am to really encounter danger, I will immediately stop. I will not play around with my life just for the sake of making a single breakthrough in the world spiritist realm.”

“Furthermore, it has been some time now since my spirit power was injured. During this time, my spirit power has yet to improve. If I continue to wait like this, I have no idea how much longer I’ll have to wait.”

“Rather than wait passively, I feel that it is better that I make an attempt myself. Thus, Milady Queen, please allow me to give it a try,” Chu Feng urged.

At that moment, Her Lady Queen grew silent. She did not wish for Chu Feng to suffer. Yet, she also did not wish for Chu Feng to continue to stagnate . It was true that this was a rare opportunity, and Chu Feng’s suggestion was feasible.

In the end, Her Lady Queen said, “I only have a single request. If you are unable to persevere or feel fatal danger to your life, you must stop immediately. You cannot force yourself.”

“Yes, Milady Queen,” Chu Feng said with a smile on his face.
