Chapter 5784: Battling Huangfu Shengyu

“Chu Feng, I am a reasonable person. You were the one who summoned the Genesis Bloodline and won its recognition, so I’m giving you a choice. You can sacrifice yourself so that the others can live, or I can personally destroy you, steal the Genesis Bloodline, and kill your companions,” Huangfu Shengyu said with narrowed eyes.

Weng!

Chu Feng’s World Spirit Space opened, and the Asura King rushed at Huangfu Shengyu.

The Asura King was also at rank one True God level. He flitted up to Huangfu Shengyu in the blink of an eye and unleashed waves of black auras reminiscent of sharp claws on the latter.

Every single one of his strikes was deadly, but Huangfu Shengyu didn’t bother retaliating. He simply retreated again and again, dodging his attacks with ease.

“Hoh! A rank one Half-God level Asura World Spirit. You must be the world spirit who granted Chu Feng his True God level power,” Huangfu Shengyu sneered in disdain.

“His fighting prowess didn’t decrease despite being granted the cultivation of True God level.”

Chu Feng observed the situation with his Heaven’s Eyes. Even though his spirit power was at Immortal Dragon God-cloak, thanks to his Ruler’s Bloodline, both his fighting prowess and world spiritist techniques were on par with Saint Dragon God-cloak World Spiritists.

In fact, he surpassed ordinary Saint Dragon God-cloak World Spiritists.

Even though that wasn’t enough for him to match the current Huangfu Shengyu, it allowed him to discern the details of the fight between Huangfu Shengyu and the Asura King.

“Construct the formation,” Chu Feng instructed.

Several surges of black aura flowed out of Chu Feng’s World Spirit Space and fused into the Asura King’s body. It was a formation constructed by the Asura World Spirit Army, and it greatly boosted the Asura King’s fighting prowess.

Huangfu Shengyu was no longer able to deal with the Asura King’s attacks as easily as he did before. He was forced to use his martial skills to stand his ground.

“This formation… Am I mistaken?” Jie Baobao looked at Ling Xiao in astonishment.

She could tell that this formation contained countless different auras, as if it was constructed by millions of world spirits. But how could a world spiritist have tens of millions of world spirits?

“You aren’t mistaken,” Ling Xiao said.

“Chu Feng…”

Upon receiving Ling Xiao’s confirmation, Jie Baobao subconsciously clenched her fists. She couldn’t believe what she was witnessing here.

That was tens of millions of world spirits, all from the Asura Spirit World. This was a feat clearly beyond the means of a God-cloak World Spiritist!

“How can we not accept him?” Ling Xiao remarked. As a world spiritist, he was also shocked by Chu Feng’s means.

However, Chu Feng didn’t have the spare energy to bother about them. He was focused on the fight between the Asura King and Huangfu Shengyu. He wasn’t certain what kind of power the token bestowed upon Huangfu Shengyu, so he sent the Asura King out to probe him.

He’s able to execute his martial skills normally, but their prowess seems to be diminished.”

Based on what he had observed, Huagnfu Shengyu’s fighting prowess was a little weaker than his usual self.

With Huangfu Shengyu getting serious, the Asura King began to struggle despite being enhanced by the Asura Spirit Army’s formation.

“Elder, leave it to me,” Chu Feng said.

The Asura King immediately halted his attacks and returned to Chu Feng’s World Spirit Space. A black aura shrouded Chu Feng’s body right after, raising his cultivation to rank one True God level.

‘You still wish to fight me?” Huangfu Shengyu asked.

He flicked his wrist and retrieved the God Armament behind him. Despite his nonchalant face, he dared not to get careless after Chu Feng had bested him twice.

“Huangfu Shengyu, you said you’re able to raise your cultivation to rank one True God level because your predecessor gave up on his fortuitous encounter so as to aid his descendants? What a waste,” Chu Feng said.

“You’ll know whether it’s a waste or not very soon!”

Huangfu Shengyu brandished his God Armament, unleashing a devastating barrage of lightning bolts reminiscent of ferocious beasts upon Chu Feng. These were powerful martial skills, albeit not Taboo Martial Skills.

Chu Feng only had the Immemorial Hero’s Sword, so he had no choice but to dodge the lightning bolts.

Huangfu Shengyu was gleeful to see how Chu Feng couldn’t even retaliate under his onslaught. He even started mocking the latter, saying, “Chu Feng, why don’t you come at me? We’re both at rank one True God level now. I didn’t expect you to be so weak when you don’t have the superiority in cultivation rank. I thought that you were at least a decent opponent, but it looks like I overestimated you. If you can defeat me, I’ll spare you and your companions!”

His voice echoed loudly in the ancient hall.Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“He deserves to die.” Little Fishy’s eyes were filled with murderous intent.

“Little sister, don’t be reckless. That’s a battle between True God level cultivators. You can’t get involved in that,” Xianhai Shaoyu said.

He knew his little sister well. She might be mischievous, but she dealt with problems in a rational and intelligent manner. Unfortunately, that only applied when Chu Feng wasn’t around. She had a tendency to go berserk whenever she saw someone taking advantage of Chu Feng, and it felt like there was nothing she wasn’t capable of.

He was honestly afraid that his little sister would charge into the battle like a raging beast out of recklessness.

“Huangfu Shengyu, I didn’t expect you to be so noisy. I am borrowing my world spirit’s strength, but this is my world spirit. What about you? Where did you obtain your True God level cultivation from? Right, it’s a treasure your predecessor sacrificed for your sake.

“What rights do you have to be so gleeful then? I would be too embarrassed to brag about it if I were in your position. You are riding on your predecessor’s coattails, but you haven’t even hurt me in the slightest. How useless. Your predecessor must be rolling in his grave now! Saint-tier Heavenly Lightning Bloodline, you said? Please don’t say that ever again. Just the thought that I have the same bloodline as you makes me feel utterly embarrassed.”

Chu Feng began to retaliate verbally.
