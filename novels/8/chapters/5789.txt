Chapter 5789: The Indignant Huangfu Shengyu

Huangfu Shengyu stared at his broken arm in a daze.

He couldn’t accept this. He refused to believe that a mere rank eight Half-God level cultivator had severed his arm with sheer strength. However, the pain he felt from his severed stump and the spurting fresh blood from his falling arm were telling him that this was all real.

Boom!

More black thorns grew out of Huangfu Shengyu’s body, turning him into a human-shaped porcupine. Despite his eerie appearance, his fighting prowess rose once more.

“Chu Feng, I’ll rip you into pieces!” Huangfu Shengyu roared.

Paying no heed to his profusely bleeding stump, he tightly gripped his God Armament spear with his remaining right hand and manifested a massive lightning dragon behind him. He was drawing out all of the power of the forbidden medicine in this instant; this was his final chance.

His lightning dragon was different from Huangfu Fanni’s lightning flood dragon, not just in terms of appearance but prowess too. Even though both were rank one God Taboo Martial Skills, this lightning dragon was definitely a stronger one.

Chu Feng wasn’t flustered at all. He tightly gripped his Immemorial Hero’s Sword with both his hands and roared, “God Taboo: Lightning Flood Dragon!”

Tzlala!

Red lightning crackled around Chu Feng, and it manifested into a red lightning flood dragon behind him.

“Lightning Flood Dragon? How does he know our Huangfu Heavenly Clan’s God Taboo?” Huangfu Jiangyao and Huangfu Shangyang exclaimed in disbelief.

Chu Feng ignored them and instead stared at the monstrous Huangfu Shengyu.

The latter had noticed the same too and was shocked. He couldn’t understand how Chu Feng knew their martial skill when they had never imparted it to any outsider. However, he didn’t bother asking, knowing that it was a pointless question. The more important thing was for him to kill Chu Feng.

Otherwise, he would be the one killed here.

“Huangfu Shengyu, you should be familiar with this martial skill of mine, so you should know that it’s weaker than the one you used. Nevertheless, I shall cripple you with it to show you the gap between us,” Chu Feng said.

He pointed the Immemorial Hero’s Sword at Huangfu Shengyu.

Tzlala!

The red lightning flood dragon charged at Huangfu Shengyu.

“What arrogance! Die!” Huangfu Shengyu roared.

His lightning dragon growled ferociously and charged at Chu Feng with destructive might. It should have been the stronger dragon, but its body immediately disintegrated the moment the two collided.

The lightning flood dragon devoured Huangfu Shengyu with unstoppable momentum, and red lightning pierced through Huangfu Shengyu’s body like millions of arrows.

“Gah!” Huangfu Shengyu’s body convulsed as he cried in agony.

When the red lightning finally dissipated, Huangfu Shengyu plummeted from the sky and fell to the ground. He didn’t even have the strength to stand anymore. He only had a single breath left, and that was because Chu Feng had gone easy on him.

Otherwise, that earlier attack could have easily taken his life.

Tak!

A silhouette appeared beside Huangfu Shengyu. It was Chu Feng.

“Why? Why am I weaker than you even though I possess the Saint-tier Heavenly Lightning Bloodline?” Huangfu Shengyu glared at Chu Feng with indignant eyes.

He had always been invincible among his peers in the Huangfu Heavenly Clan, and many viewed him as the hope of their clan. He thought he would become the ruler of this era with his Saint-tier Heavenly Lightning Bloodline. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Yet, his pride was crushed again and again after meeting Chu Feng. He held onto a sliver of hope that Chu Feng had only gotten lucky. Even till now, he refused to believe that he was weaker than Chu Feng.

Instead of answering the question, Chu Feng constructed a formation between him and Huangfu Shengyu as he said, “I’ll be taking your martial skill.”

A black aura rushed out and shrouded Huangfu Shengyu—Dark Plunder. It didn’t take long for Chu Feng to grasp all of the means Hunagfu Shengyu had just executed.

Dark Plunder was terrifying because it granted him the ability to grasp a martial skill without practicing it. It was so overpowered that no one would believe there was such an ability in the world.

“What kind of monster are you?” Huangfu Shengyu asked weakly.

He had no idea what Chu Feng had done to him, but he felt like everything had just been stripped from him. The black aura filled him with fear.

Instead of answering the question, Chu Feng asked, “What does your Huangfu Heavenly Clan plan to do?”

“Kill me.” Huangfu Shengyu closed his eyes and prepared for death.

Chu Feng chuckled.

He constructed a formation on his palm and sucked Huangfu Shengyu into it. The formation turned into an imprint, and all sorts of objects ranging from Cosmos Sacks to treasures flew out of it.

Chu Feng reached out, and Huangfu Shengyu’s God Armament spear fell into his grasp.

“This spear is much better than Huangfu Fanni’s,” Chu Feng remarked.

He tried to infuse his bloodline into the spear, but soon, he frowned. He had to extract Huangfu Shengyu’s aura from the spear in order to make it submit to him. It was troublesome, but it didn’t take long for him to tame the spear.

“Hm?”

The moment Chu Feng’s aura fused with the God Armament spear, he noticed an ancient word appearing on its surface. It resembled the character ‘真 (True)’. It appeared for a brief moment before vanishing.

“What does this mean?” Chu Feng was confused.

He suddenly felt weakness in his limbs, as the red lightning receded from him. His cultivation swiftly regressed to rank five Half-God level.

“This feeling… Is it the backlash?”

Chu Feng quickly dispelled the formation around him, revealing himself to the crowd once more.

The crowd saw him holding onto Huangfu Shengyu’s God Armament spear, treasures, and Cosmos Sack, but Huangfu Shengyu was nowhere to be seen. Clearly, Huangfu Shengyu was dead.

“Chu Feng, I’ll kill you!” Huangfu Jiangyao rushed at Chu Feng with overflowing killing intent.

Chu Feng made no attempt to dodge. On the contrary, he lost strength in his body and fell to the ground.

In the blink of an eye, Huangfu Jiangyao’s God Armament was already right before Chu Feng, but before it could strike the latter, Huangfu Jiangyao suddenly yelped in pain.

Uwa!

It was Xianhai Shaoyu!

He had raised his cultivation to its limit. While supporting the falling Chu Feng, he plunged his God Armament into Huangfu Jiangyao’s dantian.

Little Fishy, Feng Ling, and Xian Miaomiao appeared at the same time too, shielding Chu Feng around them.

“Chu Feng isn’t alone,” Xianhai Shaoyu said before swinging his God Armament, slicing Huangfu Jiangyao into two.
