Chapter 4947: No Chance at Victory

“A nobody like you dares to act so arrogantly. Very well, I’ll teach you a lesson for your arrogance!”&nbsp;

Situ Gouyue entered the palace right after Chu Feng.&nbsp;

Everyone felt worried for Chu Feng, including those from the Zhuge Clan. Chu Feng’s words were simply too arrogant, and Situ Gouyue had shown himself to be a vicious and narrow-minded person.&nbsp;

They felt that Chu Feng was just asking for needless trouble.

But at the same time, Chu Feng was stepping forward for their entire eastern region, so they acknowledged his bravery as well. If possible, they would want Chu Feng to defeat Situ Gouyue as well.

It was just that they couldn’t fathom how Chu Feng could possibly win the battle.&nbsp;

As a result, most people could only sigh helplessly.&nbsp;

It would truly be a pity if a prodigy of Chu Feng’s caliber were to lose his life here.&nbsp;

“You were the one who decide the earlier rules. Shouldn’t I get the right to determine the rules this time around?” Chu Feng said.

“You want to set the rules for me? Who do you think you are? Are you even qualified?” Situ Gouyue spat. He didn’t think that Chu Feng had any say here.&nbsp;

However, Chu Feng had already known that Situ Gouyue would react in such a manner. He wasn’t flustered by his rejection at all. Instead, he sneered coldly and asked, “Are you afraid? Do you think that you can’t beat me at my game?”&nbsp;

“Utter nonsense! Take a look in the mirror. There’s not a single part of you that can intimidate me!” Situ Gouyue bellowed.

“Since that’s the case, what are you so hesitant for? If you wish to utterly crush me, shouldn’t you be able to win me at my own game?” Chu Feng asked.&nbsp;

“You’re an interesting fellow. Alright, I’ll let you set the rules. I’d love to see what a nobody like you can do to survive,” Situ Gouyue replied.&nbsp;

“The rules are simple. Fifteen minutes isn’t enough for me to bring out my strongest formation. I want to increase the duration to 45 minutes. We’ll cross hands after 45 minutes,” Chu Feng replied.

The crowd was stunned to hear those words. They were trying to fathom what Chu Feng was up to.

It was true that a world spiritist’s formation would become stronger if they had more time to construct their formation, but there was also a limit to how strong a formation could become.&nbsp;

Without the enhancement of treasures, a formation constructed by Chu Feng within thirty minutes would be roughly as powerful as a formation he constructed in 45 minutes. However, his confident attitude made it seem like he had an ace up his sleeves, so the crowd couldn’t help but feel a sliver of anticipation even though they couldn’t fully comprehend the situation.

They thought that Chu Feng might really have a way to defeat Situ Gouyue.

“Very well. I’ll make my move as soon as 45 minutes is up. Don’t blame me if you lose your life!”&nbsp;

Situ Gouyue immediately dived into the construction of his formation, but there was a change in his formation construction this time around.&nbsp;

The crowd felt a clench in their hearts. They could tell that the formation Situ Gouyue was constructing was more complicated and powerful than before. By the end of the 45 minutes, the formation he built would potentially wield terrifying destructive prowess.&nbsp;

“Those from the Situ World Spiritist Clan sure are formidable. Our Zhuge Clan doesn’t have any formation as formidable as that.”

The small sliver of hope that had arisen in the hearts of those from the Zhuge Clan crumbled, and they fell into despair once more. They had no idea how Chu Feng could defeat Situ Gouyue.&nbsp;

“No, that’s not right. Take a closer look! The formation Chu Feng is constructing doesn’t look normal either!” someone from the Zhuge Clan exclaimed.&nbsp; ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

There was nothing special with Chu Feng’s formation at first glance, but on closer analysis, it was far more delicate than anyone could have imagined. It was to the point where it would be difficult for even veteran world spiritists to see through it.

Without a doubt, a formation built with such a delicate touch was bound to wield tremendous prowess.&nbsp;

“It looks like Chu Feng has come prepared.”

“As expected of young hero Chu Feng.”

Daoist Niantian, Shengguang Baimei, and the others were overjoyed to see that.&nbsp;

As formidable as Situ Gouyue was, it looked like Chu Feng still stood a fair chance here. Of course, it might be hard for Chu Feng to continue building a formation so delicately for 45 minutes straight, but they were still fairly confident in Chu Feng’s competency.

On the other hand, those from the Situ World Spiritist Sect began to panic. They turned their sights toward the blue-cloaked woman.

As world spiritists themselves, they could tell that Chu Feng was exceptionally talented.&nbsp;

“Milord…”

They barely got a word in when the blue-cloaked woman suddenly spoke up.

“I’ve indeed underestimated that lad from Ancestral Martial Galaxy. However, there’s no need to panic. It’ll be hard for him to maintain such standards for 45 minutes and fully construct a formation. I don’t believe that he’s capable of that.&nbsp;

“Even if he’s lucky enough to finish his formation with such standards, there’s still no way he could defeat young master Gouyue. He has already lost from the very start. Even if there were ten more world spiritists of his skills here, the outcome would still be the same,” the blue-cloaked woman said confidently.&nbsp;
