Chapter 3713 - Chu Feng’s Shadow?

Chu Feng simply had too much of a desire to fuse with the Four Symbols Divine Power.

Even the legendary Battle God’s Halberd did not entice Chu Feng much when compared to the opportunity to fuse with the Four Symbols Divine Power.

Thus, even though Chu Feng knew that things were fishy, he ultimately nodded and agreed to the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s condition.

“Boy, since you’ve agreed to it, this old man will draw those guardian spirits away at once. Once they’re drawn away, you are to immediately retrieve the Battle God’s Halberd.”

Sure enough, after the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said those words, he immediately began to work. He dived straight down and emitted great power, creating enormous ripples in the water.

“Roooar~~~”

Soon, roars began to sound from below.

The dormant guardian spirits were all awakened by the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s approach.

“Boom, boom, boom~~~”

Following that, rumbles began to explode nonstop. The guardian spirits had reached the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“Amazing.”

Even though they were very far away, Chu Feng was able to gain a rough understanding of the battle situation.

The Ox-nosed Old Daoist had used his ability to create over ten thousand clones. Like an army of Ox-nosed Old Daoists, his clones collided with the guardian spirits.

Those guardian spirits were all Utmost Exalteds.

Thus, for the Ox-nosed Old Daoist to be able to fight those guardian spirits head-on, it naturally meant that he also possessed the cultivation of an Utmost Exalted.

Rank one Utmost Exalted was a cultivation that stood at the top of the Ancestral Martial Starfield.

At least, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was stronger than Liangqiu Chengfeng, Wuming Xingyun, Grandmaster Long Xuan and Queen Mother Fox Immortal.

Furthermore, Chu Feng felt that even though they were both rank one Utmost Exalted, Ox-nosed Old Daoist was even stronger than Grandmaster Liangqiu.

The battle below grew increasingly fierce. Not only was the Ox-nosed Old Daoist fighting the guardian spirits, he was even insulting them.

Those guardian spirits seemed to be able to understand him, and grew more furious and frantic in their attacks.

This sort of situation lasted for a while. Then, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist led his clones and began to swim far away, and those guardian spirits actually began to uniformly follow him.

“Insults are actually effective against those guardian spirits?”

Chu Feng felt that if the Ox-nosed Old Daoist didn’t enrage those guardian spirits, the guardian spirits would likely not chase after him. After all, their main mission should be to guard the Battle God’s Halberd.

Thus, Chu Feng was unable to help but admire the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s tricks.

That said, upon thinking about it, Chu Feng was able to understand.

The Ox-nosed Old Daoist himself had mentioned that he had stayed here for many years.

Why was he staying here? Naturally, it was for the Battle God’s Halberd.

After all these years, for the sake of obtaining the Battle God’s Halberd, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist must’ve attempted all sorts of methods. Thus, it was reasonable for him to have discovered some tricks.

That said, Chu Feng also became increasingly certain that what the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said to him was not the truth.

That Battle God’s Halberd was most definitely not so easily obtainable.

Since the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was capable of releasing over ten thousand clones, he would be totally capable of leaving a clone behind to retrieve the Battle God’s Halberd after he led the guardian spirits away.

It was impossible for the Ox-nosed Old Daoist to have not thought about such a simple method.

There was only one possibility as to why he didn’t do that.

The Battle God’s Halberd was simply not that easily obtainable.

Even though Chu Feng had confirmed that it was not easy to obtain the Battle God’s Halberd, he still dived down and extended his hand to retrieve it.

Even though he knew it would not be that easy, he must still give it a try.

“Boom~~~”

Sure enough, before Chu Feng could even touch the Battle God’s Halberd, an enormous aura rushed out from it.

That aura was simply too powerful. Chu Feng was simply unable to withstand it at all. The aura directly blew Chu Feng away.

The powerful aura shot Chu Feng several meters away. Only then did Chu Feng barely stabilize himself.

When Chu Feng stabilized himself, he heard a voice, “Someone as weak as you dares to attempt to obtain the Battle God’s Halberd?”

Chu Feng raised his head, and discovered that a figure had appeared before the Battle God’s Halberd.

That figure seemed like a human, yet was not human.

That individual was pitch-black from head to toe. Chu Feng was unable to determine the person’s appearance. He seemed, like a shadow. It was truly strange.

Strangest of all, his voice was exactly the same as Chu Feng’s voice.

“Who are you?” Chu Feng asked sternly.

“Who I am is not important. What’s important is that you need to defeat me if you want to obtain the Battle God’s Halberd,” said that shadow.

“Clank~~~”

After he finished saying those words, a sword appeared in his hand.

Seeing that sword, Chu Feng’s heart tensed up. Although that sword was also the shape of a shadow, its shape and aura were identical to Chu Feng’s Blue Jade Mandarin Duck Sword.

“Woosh~~~”

Before Chu Feng could think much, that shadow rushed to attack him.

At the instant when that shadow attacked him, Chu Feng was able to sense his cultivation.

His cultivation was the same as Chu Feng’s. He was also a rank three Exalted. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Even though his opponent’s cultivation was identical to his own, and everything was so very strange, Chu Feng did not even take out his weapon to confront the incoming attack.

Instead, he waited for the shadow to approach him before activating both his Lightning Mark and Lightning Armor simultaneously.

In an instant, Chu Feng’s cultivation increased from rank three Exalted to rank five Exalted.

Thus, Chu Feng possessed cultivation that could completely suppress his opponent.

However, at practically the same instant when Chu Feng increased his cultivation, that shadowy individual’s cultivation also increased. Like Chu Feng, his cultivation increased to rank five Exalted.

Furthermore, by the time Chu Feng increased his cultivation, the shadowy figure had arrived before him.

At that time, Chu Feng did not have the time to take out his Blue Jade Mandarin Duck Sword. He could only rely on his own strength to face his incoming opponent.

However, his opponent was simply too fast. Even though Chu Feng had already moved to dodge the attack ahead of time, a splash of blood still formed. Chu Feng’s left arm had been struck by the shadow’s sword.

That was not only a minor flesh wound. Instead, the cut hacked off half of Chu Feng’s bone and nearly sliced off his arm.

After that shadowy figure successfully landed his attack on Chu Feng, he did not continue. Instead, he stood there and said to Chu Feng, “You’d best not be careless facing me.”

His voice was filled with mockery.

Seeing that, Chu Feng narrowed his brows.

Chu Feng discovered that his opponent was not only emitting black lightning, but there was also a faint ‘Divine’ character on his forehead.

Even though everything was black in color, that individual’s appearance and the aura he emitted was exactly the same as Chu Feng’s Lightning Mark and Lightning Armor.

It was precisely through those two methods that his cultivation instantly increased from rank three Exalted to rank five Exalted.

“You’re my shadow?” Chu Feng asked sternly.

The reason why he asked that was because his opponent possessed identical abilities to his own. Even his weapon was identical to his Blue Jade Mandarin Duck Sword.

It was all simply too strange. Thus, Chu Feng determined that the person before him was not human at all. Instead, he should be some sort of illusory ability.

Chu Feng felt that the opponent he was facing at that moment was none other than himself.
