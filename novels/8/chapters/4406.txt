Chapter 4406: The Lady of Dao Sea’s Horror

The Lady of Dao Sea was utterly flabbergasted that her emotions could be seen on her face. She rarely displayed such an emotion at all.

A huge storm had already broken out in the depths of her heart, leaving her feeling completely discomposed.

She had great faith in the Spirit Rock of Prophecies, especially the one she had in her hand.

It was a unique treasure that had been passed down by a seer in the Ancient Era, and it was extremely rare to find anything like it in the current world of cultivators.

It would usually only prophesy a single event, but it tended to be extremely accurate.

Back then, when she first came to learn that the Nine Souls Galaxy would be facing a calamity, she had been trying to find a way to prepare for it in advance so as to overcome it.

It took her a great deal of effort before she managed to find this Spirit Rock of Prophecies, and she asked it whether it was possible for anyone to reverse the tides of the calamity.

The answer she received was the appearance of an infant, an infant whom she had just taken in back then—Wang Yuxian.

Since then, as Wang Yuxian grew, the figure reflected on the Spirit Rock of Prophecies would change along with her. While it had never fully revealed Wang Yuxian’s appearance, the Lady of Dao Sea could still clearly discern that the figure on it was her.

However, there was one thing that bewildered her all this while.

Typically speaking, the Spirit Rock of Prophecies could only make a single prophecy, and once the prophecy came to be, it would lose all energy and revert to an ordinary rock.

Since the Spirit Rock of Prophecies she had in hand had already prophesied that Wang Yuxian would be the person to protect the Nine Souls Galaxy from the calamity that would soon befall it, it should have lost its power by now.

Yet, even as years passed and Wang Yuxian grew from an infant to one of the most talented individuals in the Nine Souls Galaxy, the Spirit Rock of Prophecies never grew dysfunctional. It continued working as if to say that the prophecy hadn’t been fulfilled yet.

So, the Lady of Dao Sea guessed that it could be because Wang Yuxian’s prowess hadn’t reached the level where she could stand against the calamity yet. She thought that once Wang Yuxian reached the level required, the Spirit Rock of Prophecies would finally reveal her true form, and the prophecy would then be considered to have been fulfilled.

But at this very moment, the Spirit Rock of Prophecies in her hand had already reverted back to the form of an ordinary rock. There was no more unique energy harnessed within it, and the figure that was reflected on its surface a moment ago had vanished as well.

It had become a rock that couldn’t be any more ordinary.

But before it did so, it had revealed the complete form of a person. The only issue was the person shown was not her talented disciple, Wang Yuxian, but Chu Feng.

“How did things turn out like that? Do we really need to rely on an outsider to stand against the calamity that would befall us? Does Chu Feng really possess such great capability?”

The Lady of Dao Sea had a conflicted look on her face, and there was even a hint of disappointment even.

It was only natural that she would feel such a way. She had held such great faith in the prophecy, about all of a sudden, it was revealed that she had been mistaken all this while. It was inevitable that she would feel deeply conflicted inside.

But soon, the conflicted look on her face vanished, replaced with a smile instead.

It was a very faint smile, but it was one of liberation. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Kacha!

She crushed the Spirit Rock of Prophecies in her hand into powder.

“Big sister, you’re right. How can we blindly believe in prophecies? In the world of cultivators, it should be us, the living, who take precedence! My Lele will be the strongest of all! Putting aside the fact that the calamity might not even strike, even if it does, my disciple and I will be the one to tear it down!” the Lady of Dao Sea muttered to herself as she looked at the heap of powdery remains of the rock on the ground.

Despite having trusted the Spirit Rock of Prophecies just a moment ago, she cast aside her faith in it without any hesitation. Perhaps, from the very start, it was not the Spirit Rock of Prophecies she trusted in but that it was reflecting an image that reflected her desire.

“Heh...”

But at this very moment, a light chuckle sounded within the room.

Hearing the chuckle, the body of the Lady of Dao Sea suddenly tensed up. She roared furiously, “Who is it?”

As she said those words, she released her sensing ability over not just this palace but the entire Dao Sea, allowing her to perceive everything present within this area.

In fact, she could even sense her big sister, who had yet to leave the territory of the Dao Sea yet.

But somehow, she was unable to perceive the person who had just chuckled a moment ago.

In this very instant, a tight furrow formed on the forehead of the Lady of Dao Sea. Traces of cold sweat even appeared on her faces.

It might not have been very apparent on her face, but her heart was already gripped with terror.

Who could have thought there would be a person in the Nine Souls Galaxy that could make the great Lady of Dao Sea feel fear?

The Lady of Dao Sea had great confidence in her strength. She knew that her cultivation had already reached a level where most people could only dream of.

And from the earlier chuckle that she heard, she could deduce two things.

Firstly, the chuckle had come from within the room where she was in.

Secondly, the chuckle came from a man, so there was no way it could have been his older sister, not to mention that his older sister was already no longer within the room.

It was the realization of these two facts that made her feel great terror.

A man who was even stronger than her had entered her room without her noticing, and there was a good chance that he had seen the prophecy reflected on the Spirit Rock of Prophecies.

Her intuition told her that it was unlikely to be a good thing.

She simply couldn’t remain her cool when someone had snuck into her quarters without her noticing.

“Why snoop around when you’re already here? Show yourself!”

By this moment, the Lady of Dao Sea had already removed all fear from her face. She knew that it would be unwise to reveal her flaws and emotions in the face of a stranger.

She had regained her composed poise, and there was no longer any hint of anger or any other emotions from her anymore.

It was just that she didn’t receive any response from the other party at all.

“Little sister, what’s wrong? Are you that ill that you’re even talking to yourself?”

All of a sudden, another voice sounded in the room, but it was coming from a woman.

The big sister of the Lady of Dao Sea had returned.

She noticed that the Lady of Dao Sea had suddenly released her sensing ability over the entire Dao Sea, and that made her realize that something might have happened. So, she quickly rushed back here to take a look.

And when she arrived, she saw the Lady of Dao Sea muttering to herself in her room.

“Big sister, someone has intruded the Dao Sea!” the Lady of Dao Sea informed her big sister grimly.

“Who is it?”

Hearing those words, her big sister’s expression also grew grave.

The Lady of Dao Sea quickly informed her big sister about what she had encountered earlier.

Upon learning of the matter, the big sister immediately realized that this was a serious matter. If what her little sister mentioned was true, there could be dire consequences.

So, the big sister began using all of her means to scan the Dao Sea, but just like the Lady of Dao Sea, she was unable to find anything at all.

“Little sister, could it be possible that you’re hallucinating due to your grave injuries? I’ve just scanned the entire Dao Sea, but I couldn’t find the person who spoke about anywhere.”

Having confirmed that there was no one in the area, the anxious look on the big sister’s face alleviated significantly. She felt that the Lady of Dao Sea could have been hearing things, and that no one had infiltrated the Dao Sea.

But despite so, the Lady of Dao Sea still firmly believed that what she had heard earlier wasn’t an illusion. Even now, she could still hear that person’s chuckle clearly in her mind.
