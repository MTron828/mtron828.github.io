Chapter 5216: Comprehending a New Formation Deciphering Method

“What’s that?”

The Demon Spirit King subconsciously cowered at the sight of the pill. He sensed that it was something extremely terrifying.

“It’s our Asura Spirit World’s Scattered Soul Reforging Pill,” Xue Ji replied.

“I’m getting an ominous feeling from it. What does it do?” the Demon Spirit King asked.

“Those who consume it will be in great pain. They’ll turn into a walking zombie that’ll only die after many years of grueling torture. However, there’s a sliver of hope. It’s a pill that allows those who are on the verge of death to make one final struggle. If they manage to be reborn anew, they’ll receive the energy contained within the pill,” Xue Ji said.

“What are the chances of success?”

“A peak Half-God level Asura World Spirit would have a hundredth chance of succeeding. Unfortunately, you aren’t an Asura World Spirit, so your chances are reduced to a thousandth,” Xue Ji replied.

“A thousandth?”

The Demon Spirit King was stunned to hear that probability. That practically guaranteed his failure.

“That’s your only chance. I won’t force you if you refuse,” Xue Ji replied.

“Heh…”

The Demon Spirit King suddenly burst into laughter.

“A thousandth chance of succeeding? Most people would despair at that, but I see it as a sliver of hope,” the Demon Spirit King said as he picked up the pill.

“Some words of warning. You won’t die right away if you fail. On the contrary, you’ll live for a very long time. However, your days will be spent in pain. It’ll be a living hell. There’s no doubt that this pill is a precious item back in our Asura Spirit World, but those who have witnessed the consequences of failure would rather die than grasp onto the sliver of hope. It’s not that they have given up on life but that they are afraid of ending up in the same plight,” Xue Ji warned.

“I, the Demon Spirit King, am not afraid of death and torture, but…”

The Demon Spirit King looked at Xue Ji with eyes filled with emotions. He didn’t finish the sentence but instead swallowed the pill whole.

Gah!

The Demon Spirit King cried in agony as soon as he ingested the pill.

“Bear with it. The pain will last for six hours. Remember, if you fail, the pain you’ll suffer would be a thousandfold of this.”

With those words, Xue Ji walked out of the sealed space.

Even from outside the sealed space, she could still vaguely hear the guttural cries of the Demon Spirit King. Even a stranger would have winced at those sounds, but Xue Ji’s face remained completely impassive. It was as if she didn’t care about the Demon Spirit King’s plight at all.

She looked at the night sky with deep eyes. It was impossible to tell what she was thinking.

…

Meanwhile, in the depths of the demon coffin, Chu Feng was channeling his spirit power to keep Tao Wu’s formation from deteriorating further while racking his head to find a way to decipher it.

It was just that his scope of knowledge as a world spiritist was limited, and the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk refused to offer him any help. He found himself at a complete loss as to what he could do.

“This won’t do. I have to save Elder Tao Wu!”

Through Tao Wu’s slowly weakening voice, he knew that Tao Wu wouldn’t be able to last for long. It hadn’t been long since they met each other, but Tao Wu had already done him many favors. No matter what it took, he had to save Tao Wu.

If there was truly no way out of this, he would just have to come up with one.

“Right, I can come up with one!”

Chu Feng began revising the legacy he had inherited from Yue Ling’s ancestral land. He hadn’t fully comprehended the legacy when he first left the ancestral land, but through revising the content afterward, he was able to slowly master it.

However, upon mastering the legacy, he realized that the legacy was actually incomplete. If anything, it was just the tip of the iceberg. The real legacy was bound to be more formidable, possibly beyond his wildest imagination.

Chu Feng didn’t know whether the legacy Yue Ling’s ancestor had inherited was incomplete or that he didn’t leave the complete legacy behind, but nevertheless, this meant that there was plenty of room to develop on the incomplete legacy he had grasped.

As he immersed himself in developing a solution, his world spiritist bloodline began racing through his veins. However, he was unaware of it as his attention was fully focused on deciphering the formation.

The hall began to quake in response to his world spiritist bloodline. In particular, the spirit power he emanated felt like a ferocious beast that had been awakened from its slumber. The furious power he was emanating forced even Eggy to back away.

It was not that his spirit power was truly powerful. Similar to a lightning phenomenon, what was scary was the domineering air coming from it. Even if it wasn’t truly dangerous, just the sheer majesty of it induced fear.

It was to the extent where even Eggy backed away in fear.

“What’s happening? Is that coming from Chu Feng?”

Eggy could sense Chu Feng’s aura amidst the terrifying phenomenon unfolding before her eyes. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Chu Feng’s mind gradually grew clearer under the enhancement of his world spiritist bloodline. It didn’t take him long to comprehend a new formation deciphering method from the legacy, one that was indescribably ingenious.

He didn’t grasp much out of his earlier enlightenment, but it was at least enough for him to deal with the formation in front of him. He had actually wanted to use the opportunity to grasp even more, but possibly due to the limitations of his intelligence or the incomplete legacy, he was unable to do so.

Due to that, he could only make do with what he had and start deciphering the formation. It would take a long time for him to decipher the formation Tao Wu was trapped in, but at least there was a ray of hope now.

Time ticked by.

The spirit power shrouding the formation finally receded, and two figures stepped out from within.

Chu Feng and Tao Wu.

Tao Wu had already fallen unconscious. He was covered in his own flesh and blood, a clear sign that he had been put through cruel torture by the formation.

On the other hand, Chu Feng was unharmed although he was in a severely weakened state. He quickly took out a few recovery pills and fed them to Tao Wu.

“Chu Feng, how are you doing?”

Eggy quickly ran up to Chu Feng.

“Don’t worry, Eggy. I’m fine,” Chu Feng replied with a smile.

He began constructing a recovery formation to heal Tao Wu, but even a fool could tell just how terrible a state Chu Feng was in. He was drenched in sweat, and his pale complexion carried a slight hint of gray. He was much skinnier than he was prior to deciphering the formation, and his aura was so weak that it looked as if it would just flicker out.

“What do you mean by you’re fine? You look as if you’re going to collapse! You can’t construct a recovery formation in your state. It’s too dangerous!” Eggy advised.

“I’ll be alright, Eggy. I can hold on,” Chu Feng said with a smile while persisting on.

“Don’t blame me for this, Chu Feng. It’s all for your sake.”

Eggy gently placed her hand on Chu Feng’s shoulder and sent a gush of energy into his body. The next moment, Chu Feng fell unconscious.

She knew that it was a waste of breath to try convincing Chu Feng otherwise, so she went straight into knocking him out. She quickly supported Chu Feng’s falling body and laid him down on the ground.

This was the only way he would catch any rest.

Boom!

The door to the hall suddenly burst open, and two figures stepped in.

They were none other than Daoist Eighth Dragon and Daoist Ninth Dragon.

Their complexions still looked awful, but they appeared to have recovered a fair bit from their earlier depletion. At the very least, they were no longer on the verge of death anymore.

“What a beautiful lass. Are you the world spirit of those two nobodies?” Daoist Eighth Dragon teased.

Daoist Ninth Dragon didn’t say a word, but there was a cold smile hanging on his lips. The two of them displayed extreme confidence as if Chu Feng and Tao Wu were meat on their chopping board.
