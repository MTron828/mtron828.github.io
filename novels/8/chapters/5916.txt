Chapter 5917: Barging into the Sunmoon Sect

“Someone once thought that and brought experts from other realms and galaxies over. Even those from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion were once here. However, they failed to find anything here,” Tan Yu replied.

His tone changed when he mentioned the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. His respect for them could be felt from the bottom of his heart. He thought that the fact that someone from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion had once trodden on this land made this place even more special.

Zi Ling noticed that and asked, “You have met people from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion before?”

“I did. Those from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion tour the world of cultivation; one of them is bound to have passed by this area. They heard about the affairs here and dropped by to take a look. I was fortunate to have met him.

“It’s no wonder the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion is the strongest power in the world of cultivation. I used to think that cultivators are the true rulers of this world, and world spiritists are bound to be weaker no matter how talented they are. That viewpoint led me to reserve some doubts about the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion being the strongest power in this world.

“However, when I saw those three world spiritists from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion and the disposition they commanded, I realized just how foolish I was. That changed my view about the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. Learning about Lord Jie Ranqing’s affairs only deepened my respect for them,” Tan Yu remarked.

“Lord Jie Ranqing is indeed formidable,” Zi Ling agreed.

She had also learned that the strongest prodigy of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, Jie Ranqing, was Chu Feng’s birth mother.

“She is formidable. She’s my idol. I’d be overjoyed if I could witness her prowess in person once,” Tan Yu remarked. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Have you heard of Chu Feng?” Zi Ling asked.

“Chu Feng? I’m afraid not,” Tan Yu replied.

“You never heard about Chu Feng?” Zi Lin was surprised. There should have been no one who hadn’t heard about Chu Feng in the vast world of cultivation.

“I have been residing in the forest ever since I got injured. I rarely come into contact with the outside world. Is Chu Feng one of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s rising stars?” Tan Yu asked.

“You should find out about it yourself. You might just find yourself a new idol,” Zi Ling replied with a mysterious smile.

“Is he that formidable?” Tan Yu’s curiosity was piqued.

“My Zi Ling is starting to get mischievous,” Chu Feng sent a voice transmission over.

“Mischievous? It’s true. My big brother Chu Feng is that formidable. I idolize you more than anyone else in this world,” Zi Ling replied with a beaming smile. Despite having altered her appearance, her bubbly self still shone through.

“Aren’t you more formidable to have snagged your idol?” Chu Feng replied with a grin.

Zi Ling swiftly turned as red as a ripe apple. “Don’t say that! There’s an outsider here!”

“Oh? Why are you panicking? Can’t you tell whether I’m talking aloud or via voice transmission?” Chu Feng’s smile further widened.

“You...” Zi Ling turned even more red. She dared not raise her head out of embarrassment.

Chu Feng liked it when she reacted like that. They might be an old couple now, but Zi Ling still felt like the same innocent girl she was back then. Even the hardships from the secular world couldn’t erode her innocence.

The more he saw, the more he cherished such simple innocence.

That being said, he would still love her no matter what she became. There were many more things that he cherished about Zi Ling. She was an irreplaceable person to him, and he would always cherish the memories they shared.

Thus, he wouldn’t hesitate to put his life on the line to protect her.

“Don’t keep looking at me.” Zi Ling felt even more embarrassed under Chu Feng’s intent stare. Thus, she quickly changed the topic and asked, “Did you discern anything?”

“I can’t discern anything, but there’s something amiss about this place. Perhaps the Sunmoon Sect might know something. Let’s go ask them.”

Chu Feng advanced with the two of them.

The Sunmoon Sect had a barrier around it, but it immediately crumbled with a mere spirit power ripple from Chu Feng. The world shook as shattered pieces of the barrier fell from the sky like mirror fragments.

The Sunmoon Sect descended into chaos.

“Sunmoon Sect’s sectmaster, get out right now with your grandson!” a furious roar followed.

The Sunmoon Sect’s elders and disciples panicked. This confirmed their guess that a powerful enemy had come knocking on their doors.

They looked over and saw three figures floating in the sky.

“Is that... Tan Yu?”

Two hundred years might have passed, but some of them still recognized Tan Yu even though his appearance had changed a lot. His affairs were passed down through the Sunmoon Sect, so even newer members had heard about him.

Now that Tan Yu had returned with two powerful figures, those from the Sunmoon Sect could easily guess their intentions.

Tan Yu was out for vengeance.

Several elders emerged from the sect, and they gave off a lofty and righteous air. The disciples and the other elders quickly rose to the sky and positioned themselves behind those elders.

In the blink of an eye, hundreds of millions of Sunmoon Sectmembers formed a stand-off with Chu Feng’s group.

The huge difference in their numbers made Tan Yu uneasy, and he wouldn’t stop trembling.

However, Chu Feng and Zi Ling remained nonchalant. They knew that unless someone in the Sunmoon Sect had strength on par with them, or else the number didn’t matter at all. The other party was just putting on a brave front.

“I don’t know the two of you. Why have you invaded our Sunmoon Sect?” the elder standing at the forefront of the formation asked.

Chu Feng figured that this old man was the Sunmoon Sect’s sectmaster. He must have known about Tan Yu’s plight, but he turned a blind eye to his grandson’s atrocities instead of upholding justice. That made him equally guilty.

“You’re the Sunmoon Sect’s sectmaster, right?” Chu Feng looked at the other party in disdain. The other party was practically a dead man in his eyes by now.

“Yes, I am the Sunmoon Sect’s sectmaster.”

The Sunmoon Sect’s sectmaster still didn’t understand the severity of the matter. He waved his sleeves and unleashed a powerful aura, hoping to intimidate Chu Feng with his cultivation!
