Chapter 4157 - Nine Principles Dragon Sect

The various powers were all trying their hardest to search for the Dragon Vein Source Stones.

At the very most, they’d only search for other treasures in passing.

However, no one would go out of their way to especially search for other treasures.

However, there was one power that served as an exception. They were the Nine Principles Dragon Sect.

The Nine Principles Dragon Sect had come to the Endless Abyss in an alliance with other powers.

However, once they’d managed to breach the protective formation that surrounded the entrance, they had immediately abandoned their allies.

The people that had entered through that entrance were all people from their Nine Principles Dragon Sect, and the world spiritists they’d invited.

Although they’d broken the rules, they had not been punished by the Dragon Clan. Instead, the Dragon Clan reacted as if they hadn’t seen anything.

The reason for that was because the Nine Principles Dragon Sect had an excellent relationship with the Dragon Clan.

There had been rumors that there were people in the Dragon Clan backing the Nine Principles Dragon Sect. It was an open secret.

That was also the reason why no other power dared make an enemy of the Nine Principles Dragon Sect.

Who would dare go against a power that was backed by the Dragon Clan?

This time around, the Nine Principles Dragon Sect had invited a total of five Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritists.

Furthermore, their Nine Principles Dragon Sect had two Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritists themselves.

With that, there were a total of seven Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritists working for the Nine Principles Dragon Sect.

Furthermore, the world spiritists that had been invited by the Nine Principles Dragon Sect were all extraordinary individuals.

This could be seen from the fact that the Nine Principles Dragon Sect had been the first to breach the protective formation and enter the Endless Abyss.

From this, one could tell how powerful those world spiritists were.

Logically, with such a powerful lineup of world spiritists, they should be putting forth an all-out effort to find the Dragon Vein Source Stones.

However, they hadn’t done that and had instead formed a base camp that was overseen by the Nine Principles Dragon Sect’s Sectmaster.

The remaining people left in four separate directions with treasure-seeking tools in hand.

Their goal was to find cultivation treasures like the Dragon Vein Blood Stones.

Currently, there was only an old man with sharp white brows in the camp. He sat cross-legged atop a palace.

His eyes were tightly closed, and his breathing followed a special rhythm. Even the surrounding natural energies were being transformed because of him.

Most importantly, there was an unending stream of gases gushing out from beneath the ground below him. Those gases would then ultimately enter his body.

Those gases were not only natural energies, they were also other special powers. The sounds of dragon roars could even be faintly heard from the gases.

It turned out that that place was a sacred cultivation ground.

It was no wonder then that the Nine Principles Dragon Sect had set up camp there.

In fact, even the palace itself was a special spirit formation meant to extract the cultivation gases from beneath the ground.

The person who was training with the cultivation gases at that moment was none other than the Nine Principles Dragon Sect’s Sectmaster, a rank seven Utmost Exalted-level expert.

Suddenly, two figures flew over.

They were a middle-aged man and an old lady in a world spiritist cloak.

The middle-aged man was another son of the Nine Principles Dragon Sect’s Sectmaster.

His age was relatively old. Whilst he had the looks of a middle-aged man, he was over five thousand years old.

The Nine Principles Dragon Sects Sectmaster had over a hundred children. Amongst them, he was most fond of his second son and his youngest son.

Because of how much he pampered them, he had even left two spots into the Endless Abyss to them.

His intention was so that they could use the opportunity to train and make breakthroughs in their cultivations.

The middle-aged man that flew over was the Nine Principles Dragon Sect’s Sectmaster’s second son. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

His name was Long Shangjue. At over five thousand years old, he possessed the cultivation of rank three Utmost Exalted.

He was the person with the highest level of cultivation amongst the Nine Principles Dragon Sect’s Sectmaster’s numerous children.

“Jue’er, you’ve returned. Seeing how happy you are, you must’ve managed to harvest something. Come, let your father have a look at the treasure you discovered.”

The Nine Principles Dragon Sect’s Sectmaster immediately opened his eyes upon detecting Long Shangjue’s return. A smile also appeared on his face.

He knew his son Long Shangjue very well.

This second son of his was someone who would never do anything with uncertainty.

Since he had returned, it meant that he must’ve obtained a harvest.

“Father, please have a look.”

Long Shangjue arrived before his father and brought forth an exquisite case.

The Nine Principles Dragon Sect’s Sectmaster accepted the case. Upon opening it, the look of joy on his face grew even stronger.

Inside the case was a single Dragon Vein Blood Stone.

“Jue’er, sure enough, you’ve not disappointed father.”

“You’ve managed to discover such a precious Dragon Vein Blood Stone so quickly,” praised the Nine Principles Dragon Sect’s Sectmaster.

Suddenly, a voice sounded from afar, “Dragon Vein Blood Stone? That’s extremely precious.”

“Second elder brother, you’re truly amazing.”

Looking towards the direction of the voice, two figures could be seen flying over.

Those two people were the Nine Principles Dragon Sect’s Sectmaster’s youngest son and the Nine Principles Dragon Sect’s Supreme Elder.

The name of the youngest son was Long Shangsong.

As for the Supreme Elder, his name was Long Pinggong.

They were the ones that had robbed Chu Feng of his Dragon Vein Yin Yang Stone earlier.

Seeing the return of his youngest son, the Nine Principles Dragon Sect’s Sectmaster smiled so much that his wrinkles covered his face. He was even more joyous than when he saw his second son’s return.

However, seeing the return of his little brother, Long Shangjue’s expression turned ugly at once.

Long Shangjue and Long Shangsong were the two most beloved sons of the Nine Principles Dragon Sect’s Sectmaster.

However, Long Shangjue’s little brother Long Shangsong possessed talent that surpassed his own.

At present, both their clansmen and outsiders addressed his little brother Long Shangsong as the young sectmaster.

It was as if his little brother would definitely succeed his father as the next sectmaster.

On top of that, the two brothers had a bad relationship to begin with. That was also something that everyone knew.

As such, it was only natural for Long Shangjue to feel very displeased that he was now being suppressed by his little brother.

In fact, everyone could tell that Long Shangsong’s words earlier, although seemingly praising his second brother, were actually a sneer at him.

Naturally, the Nine Principles Dragon Sect’s Sectmaster could tell this too.

But, not only did he not mind it, he instead turned to his youngest son and with a beaming smile on his face asked, “Song’er, could it be that you’ve also managed to obtain a harvest?”

Long Shangsong did not answer the question directly. Instead, he looked to the case his second brother had presented to his father.

“Second brother, you’ve returned to take credit for only a single Dragon Vein Blood Stone?” Long Shangsong said to Long Shangjue.

If his earlier ridicules were still somewhat concealed, then his current ridicule was completely in the open.

“Humph.”

Long Shangjue snorted coldly in anger. But, he didn’t say anything.

He understood what sort of person his little brother was. Since he was making such cutting remarks, it meant that he must’ve found a treasure even better than a Dragon Vein Blood Stone.

“Song’er, exactly what sort of treasure did you find? Quickly let father have a look,” the Nine Principles Dragon Sect’s Sectmaster said with great anticipation.

“Father, your child has prepared a surprise for you,” immensely pleased with himself, Long Shangsong took out a case as he spoke.

Not only was the construction of the case exquisite, light was also circulating through it. That case was a treasure itself. It was countless times more exquisite of a case compared to the case that his second brother Long Shangjue had presented the Dragon Vein Blood Stone in.

Furthermore, that case was also emitting his father’s favorite aroma.

Seeing the case, the smile on the Nine Principles Dragon Sect’s Sectmaster’s face grew even wider. He was grinning from ear to ear.

He accepted the case and opened it.

“Bang!!”

However, the moment he opened the case, a green gaseous substance sprayed out.

As the distance between him and the case was too close and he was also not on guard, the Nine Principles Dragon Sect’s Sectmaster had ended up with his entire face covered by the gaseous substance.

Once he was struck by the gaseous substance, his face immediately changed shape and he became incomparably ugly.

Poisonous gas. That was a poisonous gas.

“Lord Sectmaster!”

Seeing that the situation was bad, the Supreme Elder and the old lady immediately rushed forth to remove the poison the Nine Principles Dragon Sect’s Sectmaster was afflicted with.

As the Nine Principles Dragon Sect’s Sectmaster was a rank seven Utmost Exalted and had a very strong body, the prompt treatment soon relieved him of the poison.

However, the smile had completely disappeared from his face, and had been replaced with a look of anger.

“Is this the surprise you mentioned?”

After he finished saying those words, he smashed the case at Long Shangsong.

The attack was not light at all. Not only was Long Shangsong sent flying, he also had his head bloodied by the case. His face had also deformed.

However, Long Shangsong was not concerned with his injuries at all. He hurriedly picked up the case to inspect it.

Upon doing so, he discovered that there was nothing in the case at all.

“H-h-how c-c-could t-this be possible?!”

Long Shangsong was in a complete panic. He was so shocked that he even began to stutter.
