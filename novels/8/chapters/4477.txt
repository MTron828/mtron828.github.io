Chapter 4477: Amazing The Crowd

“What formidable martial skills! I would have never believed that one could actually master martial skills to such a level at their age!”

“From the looks of it, it would appear that Zhao Batian is not a match for that lad. That lad is simply too frightening! Just who the hell is he?”

Initially, it was only the top-notch experts who could tell that Chu Feng was in an advantageous situation here. However, as Chu Feng’s blue lightning swiftly tore through Zhao Batian’s purple flame, it soon became clear to everyone what the conclusion of the clash would be.

“He isn’t a match for that lad despite having consumed a forbidden medicine.”

“Looks like Zhao Batian doesn’t stand a chance anymore.”

Even the onlookers had proclaimed Zhao Batian’s loss.

“Hahaha, very well! I have been waiting for this day for a very long time! I can finally experience its true strength!”

But to everyone’s surprise, even as the purple flame he had unleashed toward Chu Feng was swiftly being whittled down, Zhao Batian abruptly burst into laughter.

Boom!

Zhao Batian’s body began to swell up once more, growing by another twofold this time around.

His skin had begun cracking, and what that flowed out of these cracks were not fresh blood but a lava-like substance. An even more powerful surge of energy was gradually being emitted from Zhao Batian’s body.

“Big brother, are you insane?” Zhao Yuzhuo hollered anxiously.

He immediately realized that Zhao Batian had done—the latter had just consumed an even more potent forbidden medicine!

Zhao Batian acted as if he had been possessed. He didn’t even bother explaining himself, as if he couldn’t hear Zhao Yuzhuo’s words at all. His eyes that were so red that they looked as if they were spitting fire were fixated on Chu Feng.

“I shall show you the true prowess of a Taboo Exalted Martial Skill!”

As Zhao Batian spoke, a pair of massive eyes suddenly appeared in the midst of the purple flame, and a terrifying howl could vaguely be heard echoing from it. It looked so sinister that it felt almost as if a flame demon had descended upon the world.

At the same time, the prowess of the purple flame also grew exponentially. With its enhanced might, the purple flame finally managed to turn the table around.

With growing momentum, it began to claw its way through Chu Feng’s blue lightning to strike Chu Feng down.

Chu Feng continued to release blue lightning from his body to fend against the purple flame, but he couldn’t stop the terrifying purple flame that was swiftly getting closer toward him.

“Is it possible to manifest life within a martial skill? What a scary power that is!”

The crowd was shocked by the changes that had occurred to the martial skill.

“Hahaha, do you that that’s all? This is nothing but the appetizer!” Zhao Batian laughed frenziedly, as if he had lost his mind to his newfound power.

Yet another two more pairs of eyes appeared amidst the purple flames, and the prowess of the purple flame grew by almost threefold.

“This... Isn’t this a little too much? Just what kind of forbidden medicine did he eat to be able to draw forth such power from his martial skill?!”

The spectating elders around remarked in astonishment.

“It’s unbecoming of a cultivator to be so reliant on such external means to defeat his opponent. I wonder how would that lad respond to this?”

Faced with such a situation, even the experts who didn’t know Chu Feng began worrying in his stead. They felt that it would be a huge pity for Chu Feng to lose his life here.

In a real battle, Zhao Batian wouldn’t stand a chance against Chu Feng. In terms of character, Chu Feng seemed to be much more of a decent human being as compared to Zhao Batian.

Putting aside the cause of the battle, even after Chu Feng had defeated Zhao Batian and chosen to let him off, Zhao Batian still shamelessly tried to sneak a surprise assault on Chu Feng. After his surprise assault had been foiled, he resorted to consuming forbidden medicine to stand his ground.

If there was anyone who deserved to die here, they would point their fingers at Zhao Batian unhesitatingly.

And given that even the onlookers were so worried about Chu Feng, there was no need to say just how the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief, Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster, and the others were feeling at the moment.

It was not that they didn’t believe in Chu Feng’s strength, but Zhao Batian was simply too terrifying after consuming two forbidden medicines. His prowess already far surpassed that of ordinary rank eight Utmost Exalted level cultivators.

Unless Chu Feng had another trump card prepared, it would be hard for him to triumph over Zhao Batian.

But did Chu Feng really still have anything else up his sleeves?

They honestly didn’t know, and they weren’t willing to bet on the possibility. If they continued to stand around and do nothing at all, Chu Feng could very well lose his life!

But before any of them could make a move, Chu Feng suddenly spoke up, “Is that all you have?”

Those who had just prepared themselves to make a move calmed down once more.

Chu Feng’s tone was calm and confident. It didn’t seem like he was panicking despite the overwhelming might of Zhao Batian’s martial skill.

In fact, rather than saying that he was not panicking, it seemed like he was mocking Zhao Batian even.

“What do you mean by this?” Zhao Batian was a little taken aback to hear Chu Feng’s words.

“If you’re done, it should be my turn to make a move.”

Tzlala!

Right after saying those words, six surges of lightning burst forth from Chu Feng’s body and swiftly morphed into the silhouette of a human.

“Those are... Lightning Souls?”

The crowd from the Yu Heavenly Clan dilated their pupils in stupefaction. Even the Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief could hardly conceal his disbelief at this situation.

“I knew that he had left a hand, but I didn’t think that he would still have something so powerful up his sleeves. He could actually manifest six Lightning Souls simultaneously?!”

Yu Lie looked utterly dumbstruck.

One must know that he had to push himself beyond his limit in order to manifest a second Lightning Soul, but at this very instant, Chu Feng was manifesting six Lightning Souls at once with a leisurely look at his face.

This further drove in the disparity in talent between him and Chu Feng, and a feeling of helplessness rose within him.

“How could a junior manifest six Lightning Souls? Just how in the world is Chu Feng doing this? Is it really possible for a person so talented to exist in the world?”

The Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief looked at Chu Feng with a look of lamentation in his eyes. With a deep sigh, he murmured regretfully, “Why is such a prodigy not from our clan?”

Tzlala!

While everyone was still in a state of shock, the six Lightning Souls began to expand rapidly as they launched their attacks toward Zhao Batian.

Boom boom!

The overpowering might of the Lightning Souls tore through the frightening purple flame without any resistance to strike down on Zhao Batian, smashing him right into the ground.

The sheer force had incapacitated Zhao Batian, but he wasn’t dead yet. There was still a breath of life in him.

Chu Feng didn’t kill him right away! Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Pah!

A leg pressed down on Zhao Batian’s chest as a sword was placed right before his face.

It was Chu Feng.

“Like I have said, you won’t be getting out of here alive,” Chu Feng said.

“Stop! If you dare to kill my big brother, I’ll massacre your entire clan!” a furious howl suddenly sounded at this moment—Zhao Yuzhuo.

Zhao Yuzhuo was anxious for his Zhao Batian’s safety, but despite so, his attitude still remained overbearing. He was utterly confident in himself.

But Chu Feng simply sneered coldly in response to Zhao Yuzhuo’s threat.

Puchi.

Chu Feng’s sword pierced right through Zhao Batian’s head.
