Chapter 4478: This is Disastrous

In the moment that Chu Feng impaled Zhao Batian’s head, the commotion in the surroundings fell into utter silence, such that one could hear a pin drop.

No one had expected Chu Feng to really dare to kill Zhao Batian. After all, he was the person whom Zhao Yuzhuo cared about the most.

Killing Zhao Batian was equivalent to making Zhao Yuzhuo his mortal enemy.

And making a mortal enemy out of Zhao Yuzhuo was no different from offending the Nine Souls Sacred Clan.

“How dare a mere ant like you kill my big brother? I’ll rip you into pieces, you insolent trash!” Zhao Yuzhuo flew into a state of rage.

He whipped out a weapon and charged at Chu Feng with great murderous intent.

“Scram!”

With just a light wave of his sleeves, Zhao Yuzhuo was crashed heavily into the ground. Fresh blood spurted from his mouth.

All it took was a casual wave from Chu Feng to inflict internal injuries onto Zhao Yuzhuo.

Even though Zhao Yuzhuo was also a decently talented cultivator, his prowess was beneath that of Zhao Batian. Needless to say, he wasn’t a match for Chu Feng at all.

“Do you wish to die too?” Chu Feng eyed Zhao Yuzhuo coldly as he spoke.

On the other hand, despite suffering grievous damage, Zhao Yuzhuo continued to glare at Chu Feng with bloodshot eyes filled with rage. He forced himself to get back to his feet and bellowed furiously into the sky, “Black-White Twin Malevolence, show yourselves!”

“What? Black-White Twin Malevolence? Is the Black-White Twin Malevolence here?”

“As expected, there’s indeed someone protecting Zhao Yuzhuo form the shadows! It’s just that I didn’t think that it would be the Black-White Twin Malevolence!”

Zhao Yuzhuo’s furious bellow had confirmed the suspicions of the onlookers.

As someone favored by the Nine Souls Sacred Clan, there were many people who suspected that there were experts guarding Zhao Yuzhuo from the shadows. It was just that these experts had never shown themselves in public before, so no one knew who they were.

Due to this, there were also some people who thought that Zhao Yuzhuo actually didn’t have anyone protecting him. He was just banking on his close relations with a princess of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan to intimidate others.

However, Zhao Yuzhuo’s earlier bellow revealed that there were indeed experts protecting him, and they were no other than the notorious Black-White Twin Malevolence.

Those two weren’t just experts of the Nine Souls Galaxy. They were also known to possess the viciousness of a venomous serpent.

“This is bad! Zhao Yuzhuo really has someone protecting him. That means that young friend Chu Feng is in danger then!”

The Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief and the others began to worry about Chu Feng.

In the first place, the reason why they dared not make a move against Zhao Batian was because they feared that there might be experts hiding in the area protecting the Zhao Clan.

And as it turned out, their guess was spot-on.

This was extremely bad news as they were unlikely to be a match for the true experts of the Nine Souls Galaxy.

The crowd waited in tension, but perplexingly, the Black-White Twin Malevolence didn’t appear right away.

“Black-White Twin Malevolence, are the two of you deaf? You scoundrels watched by the side as my big brother was killed without doing a thing at all, and now, you’re disobeying my orders as well? Are you tired of living?” Zhao Yuzhuo roared furiously.

He was infuriated because the Black-White Twin Malevolence were supposed to be guarding them, but they didn’t lift a finger at all when his big brother was killed.

And now, they weren’t even appearing when he was calling for them.

“What’s going on?”

“Something seems amiss here. If the Black-White Twin Malevolence are really guarding Zhao Yuzhuo, they should have appeared to protect Zhao Batian earlier. Why did they do nothing when Zhao Batian was getting killed?”

“It’s also bizarre how they aren’t appearing right now when Zhao Yuzhuo is calling for them.”

Soon, the crowd was starting to find something amiss with the situation too.

Shoosh!

While everyone was still in the midst of confusion, Chu Feng reached into his Cosmos Sack, and with a loud ‘putong!’, he took out two huge objects and tossed it over to Zhao Yuzhuo.

They were actually corpses!

Upon seeing the two corpses, Zhao Yuzhuo’s face warped in astonishment. His pupils dilated not in rage but horror.

“Could they be...”

At the same time, the crowd was also shocked upon seeing the corpses. They were able to recognize the corpses to be the Black-White Twin Malevolence. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Not only were the both of them dead, but they had also died really tragic deaths.

“Do you understand why they didn’t appear to save your elder brother now?” Chu Feng asked Zhao Yuzhuo.

“Y-you killed them? No, that’s impossible. You couldn’t have done it with your strength. W-who is it?!” Zhao Yuzhuo exclaimed.

His voice no longer had the overbearing edge to it anymore. It was quivering with fear.

He knew that there was no way Chu Feng could have killed the Black-White Twin Malevolence no matter how many formidable means he had, but there was no doubt that the two of them were indeed dead.

This left only one possibility—Chu Feng was backed by a powerful expert.

It was no wonder why this fellow was able to act so proudly despite knowing his identity and background. It turned out that he had someone to back him up.

“Heh...” Chu Feng sneered coldly, not replying to Zhao Yuzhuo’s question.

He knew very well how the Black-White Twin Malevolence. He had already taken away all of their treasures, after all.

As for why he kept his corpses, needless to say, it wasn’t so that he could bury them. Rather, he thought that there might be some treasures on them, but as he was in a rush to leave earlier, he didn’t have a chance to take a careful look at them.

So, he chose to keep their bodies for the time being.

However, what that left Chu Feng disappointed was that there was nothing valuable on their bodies. Nevertheless, they still did well extinguishing Zhao Yuzhuo’s overbearing air.

Looking at the fearful and bewildered look on Zhao Yuzhuo’s face, Chu Feng felt that it was a wise choice for him to have taken their corpses with them.

“Audacious! You dare to even touch my people?”

A bellow suddenly sounded in the air, causing the air to tremble from the noise.

It came from a woman.

Wua!

Following that, a powerful oppressive might fell from the sky, crushing down on Chu Feng. It was far beyond Chu Feng’s means to deal with, resulting in him falling flat on the ground.

Everyone widened their eyes in horror when they felt the terrifying might harnessed inside the oppressive might. It was a power that even Martial Exalted level cultivators like the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief couldn’t stand against.

Boom!

The clouds billowed as a massive shadow emerged from them.

It was a gigantic warship.

Upon seeing the huge flags hanging on the warships, those present quickly kneeled onto the floor to pay their respects.

“This is really a disaster!”

The Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief, Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, and the others were utterly appalled by the turn of events.

This was because there were four words written on those huge flags—Nine Souls Sacred Clan!
