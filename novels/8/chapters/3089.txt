Chapter 3089 - A Lot Of Thoughts

Hearing those words, Chu Feng’s psyche tensed up. He hurriedly asked, “Who was it?”

When he asked those words, Chu Feng’s entire expression changed.

When Chu Feng found out that the Starfield Master Realm had been secretly suppressing his grandfather and father, threatened their lives and even forced them to leave the Ancestral Martial Starfield, Chu Feng’s eyes were filled with anger.

However, there was now a determined expression within Chu Feng’s anger-filled gaze.

Even though he did not know who his opponents were, he was prepared to make a stand and fight against that power.

“This old man doesn’t know who they are. Your father did not mention it to me.”

“However, your father said that they were an existence so powerful that very few people could match them in the entire vast Outer World,” The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“In that case, my father could choose to leave. Why did he decide to allow himself to be imprisoned?” Chu Feng asked.

“Actually, it was not only you who didn’t know the reason why, this old man also didn’t know the reason why in the past,” After saying those words, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief smiled. After smiling that complex smile, he said, “There is some sort of power within the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm’s forbidden area.”

“If one is to stay in the forbidden area for an extended period of time, then regardless of what cultivation one might possess, one’s cultivation would start regressing. That was precisely the reason why our Chu Heavenly Clan’s Old Ancestor, Lord Yetianhong, classified that place as a forbidden area and sealed it away.”

“However, your father said that the frightening power of that place is actually capable of awakening his Heavenly Bloodline. Only by awakening his Heavenly Bloodline would he be able to gain the strength to contend against that power.”

“That is the main purpose of his return to our clan. Furthermore, for the sake of not catching the attention of that power, he had no choice but to keep a low profile. If he wanted to keep a low profile, he could not clash with the Starfield Master Realm, and could only choose to endure silently.”

“Of course, none of us had planned for things to develop to the state they did back then. It was truly that we were forced to a state of no alternative after certain things happened.”

“Back then, the result from your talent test was real.”

“After people insulted you, your father was enraged, and ended up killing people from the Starfield Master Realm. That too was real.”

“It is also real that the Starfield Master Realm wanted to put your father to death.”

“Because of that, after what happened, we were forced with no other choice.”

“Originally, I had proposed to secretly raise you. I was truly worried that you would end up dying in there after being brought into the forbidden area by your father.”

“After all, that forbidden area is a place that can even deprive martial cultivators of their cultivation. For an infant that you were back then, it was simply akin to hell.”

“However, your father refused my proposal. He told me to not involve myself in the matter, and pretend as if I did not know of his intentions. He wanted everyone to think that you had truly been expelled by our Chu Heavenly Clan.”

“Back then, this old man did not understand your father’s intentions. I also did not know what exactly it was your father was trying to do. After all, you were only an infant back then.”

“However, I now understand. Actually, your father had selfish motives from the very start.”

As the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said those words, the expression in his eyes changed slightly.

“Senior, you said that my father had selfish motives?” Chu Feng asked curiously.

Chu Feng was actually still unable to understand why his father made the decision he had.

Even if his father wanted to enter closed-door training, there were many methods of doing so. There was no need to get himself expelled from the Chu Heavenly Clan, to become disdained by everyone.

Moreover, it was as this Lord Clan Chief said, even if his father wanted to enter closed-door training in the forbidden area using the excuse of being imprisoned, everything was still within the Chu Heavenly Clan’s control.

There was no need for his father to bring him, Chu Feng, along.

“Firstly, your father had mentioned that hatred is the fastest way for one to become stronger.”

“Because of that, this old man had thought that he wanted you to live with hatred, that he wanted hatred to temper you and make you stronger.”

“Although I must admit that his method has been effective, and you have become very excellent. Ever since you were a child, you have been living a struggle and adversity-filled life. Because of that, you now possess a willpower that other geniuses lack.”

“The willpower that you’ve tempered all your life will become critical to your future growth.”

“Thus, Chu Feng, your father did not abandon you because he truly wanted to abandon you.”

“He wanted you to become even more excellent. After all, since ancient times, all the greats were people that grew up amidst adversity. They were definitely not people raised in protected environments.”

“Because of that, your father actually has enormous expectations of you, so much so that he hopes for you to surpass him.”

“Furthermore, as your father had offended such a strong power, he must’ve prepared himself to encounter them and face the danger of death at any moment.”

“Under that sort of circumstance, it might actually be the safest for him to push you away from him.”

“Thus, Chu Feng, you must not blame him,” The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“Senior, I have never ever blamed my father. Likewise, I’ve never blamed my mother.”

“Even though they’ve never been by my side, I am always able to sense the love that they have for me,” Chu Feng said.

Chu Feng was stating his true feelings. He didn’t blame his father for pushing him away.

After all, it was as the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said, growing up among cold eyes and ridicule had truly tempered Chu Feng’s willpower. This willpower had allowed Chu Feng to survive amidst adversity.

Moreover, what the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said was very true. His father had offended a power much stronger than the Starfield Master Realm. As such, he was powerless to defend himself.

Under that sort of circumstance, it was indeed safer for him to distance himself from Chu Feng.

If it were Chu Feng making the decision, he too would likely make the same decision.

Furthermore, Chu Feng also did not blame his father for not telling him the truth in the Heavenly Road. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The reason for that was that if Chu Feng were to find out the truth at that time, he might really not have received the Chu Heavenly Clan’s acknowledgement so quickly.

Chu Feng knew very well that he was only able to make such rapid progress due to the hatred in his heart. It was that hatred that urged him to grow, urged him to obtain the Chu Heavenly Clan’s acknowledgement.

“Very well, you are truly worthy of being Chu Xuanyuan’s son. Actually, had it been someone else from our clan, even if they possessed excellent talent, they might never have had a chance to shine, or even been killed by those with bloodlines inferior to theirs, should they have been tossed into the Lower Realms.”

“However, you are different. That will not happen to you, for you are Chu Xuanyuan’s son, and Chu Hanxian’s grandson.”

“Flowing within your body is extraordinary blood. Contained within your body is the purest bloodline power.”

“Only you can grow within predicaments to your current state. Likely, your father was only able to be that heartless, push you far away from him and have you temper yourself outside all alone, because he firmly believed in you,” The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said with a smile on his face.

“Lord Father has truly given this a lot of thought,” Chu Feng said.
