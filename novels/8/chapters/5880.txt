Chapter 5881: The Son Repays The Father’s Debt

Chu Feng walked up to a platform and opened a box.

There was a compass inside. It was made out of a special material and tempered with a formation. It would have been worth quite a sum.

However, Chu Feng noticed that the compass was not complete. Its purpose was to harness a formation, but there was no formation on it.

So, he turned his attention to the cavern.

The spirit formation gate that had taken the white-haired man away had disappeared, but the one at the depth of the cavern remained open.

“What’s with that monstrous beast just now? Was that a trial, or is someone making use of me here?” Chu Feng pondered about it instead of advancing right away.

The trials thus far had been simple to him, but he sensed that there was something more here.

“Forget it!” Chu Feng decided to enter the spirit formation gate.

He thought that it would lead him into another cavern, but he found himself standing in the middle of a massive formation instead. This massive formation could be deciphered with both martial power and spirit power too.

Chu Feng quickly deciphered the massive formation, and a surge of teleportation formation immediately enveloped him. Before he knew it, he was brought into yet another cavern.

This cavern looked identical to the one he was previously in. There were also two spirit formation gates, one open and one closed. At the center of the cavern was a platform, and a box sat on the platform.

A man was standing next to the platform, just that he had black hair instead of white hair.

Unlike the relaxed white-haired man, this black-haired man glared at Chu Feng with a livid face. His scales glowed brightly, and his eyes were blood-red. He gave off an imposing aura. In his hand was a three-meter-long bone.

Boom!

While Chu Feng was still assessing the black-haired man, the latter charged at him with the bone.

The black-haired man was a rank nine Half-God level cultivator, though Chu Feng could tell that the other party had used some kind of means to raise his cultivation by three cultivation ranks. That would mean that his base cultivation level was rank six Half-God level.

The bone in his hand had runes shimmering on its surface. It wasn’t any ordinary bone but a God Armament.

Instead of dodging the attack, Chu Feng raised his hand and created a barrier in front of him.

The bone smashed down on him head-on with terrifying might that crushed even space, but it immediately ground to a halt upon clashing with Chu Feng’s barrier. The barrier was completely undamaged.

This was Chu Feng’s superior spirit power. Even against an opponent wielding a God Armament, Chu Feng could easily stop him with his spirit power.

Chu Feng didn’t retaliate right away after stopping his enemy’s attack. Instead, he asked, “Who are you? Is this your territory?” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

He could tell that the enemy harbored hostility toward him, but he knew the priority at hand was to get to the bottom of what was going on.

The black-haired man didn’t answer his question. Instead, he raised his bone once more and emanated a brilliant golden light. He was executing a martial skill!

With the enhancement of a martial skill, he could unleash greater might via his God Armament. Chu Feng’s barrier was swiftly smashed into bits.

Nevertheless, Chu Feng did not attempt to dodge. He changed his hand seal, and the shattered bits of his barrier morphed into a surge of energy that rushed at the black-haired man.

The black-haired man paid no heed to it, thinking that this surge of energy couldn’t hurt him. When the surge of energy materialized around him and trapped him in place, he realized that he had gotten careless.

Gah!

The black-haired man roared, releasing a powerful wave of martial power. This wasn’t just ordinary martial power; it contained the violent aura of monstrous beasts too.

“What a strong bloodline.”

Instead of obstinately holding on, Chu Feng changed his hand seal and released his opponent. He could tell that his opponent was going to unleash a powerful attack next after having utilized his bloodline power.

Grah!

The black-haired man’s martial power turned corporeal, and it swiftly twirled around himself like a tornado. This martial power tornado was both a defensive means and an offensive means, and it harnessed tremendous prowess. It instantaneously tore through Chu Feng’s spirit power.

Then, the black-haired man turned around and dived into the spirit formation gate. The spirit formation gate immediately closed.

“What’s going on?”

Chu Feng was baffled. He couldn’t understand why his opponent had suddenly left.

Regardless, the formation sealing the platform vanished.

Meanwhile, the white-haired man was sitting outside the spirit formation gate with crossed legs, recuperating from the injuries he had sustained. Suddenly, he opened his eyes and stood up. He sensed the return of the black-haired man.

“How was it?” the white-haired man asked.

“The formation this time around is formidable. I’m not confident of defeating him, so I decided to back off for now,” the black-haired man said as he wiped off the cold sweat on his forehead.

The white-haired man breathed a sigh of relief.

“You did well. The fellow manifested by the formation this time around is indeed formidable. Even I sustained injuries in a moment of carelessness. You would have only suffered more if you continued,” the white-haired man replied.

“What are you saying? I escaped unscathed, whereas you sustained heavy injuries. That goes to show that I’m stronger than you,” the black-haired man replied gleefully.

The white-haired man was rendered speechless. He wondered if the black-haired man had escaped just to prove that he was stronger than him.

Naturally, the middle-aged man and the colossal being also saw everything that had just happened.

“I told you that Chu Feng’s title as the strongest in the Nine Heavens’ Zenith wasn’t unfounded,” the colossal being scoffed.

“Heh... It’d be an embarrassment if Chu Xuanyuan’s son wasn’t even capable of this much. Fengliu and Hongliang are only middle-upper in terms of talent in our Three Saints Monstrous Clan. I don’t believe Chu Feng can defeat Xing Yu,” the middle-aged man said.

“Why don’t you call Xing Yu over then?” the colossal being asked.

“You don’t use a cow chopper to slaughter a pig. Who in the world reveals their ace right away? However, Chu Xuanyuan’s son has at least proven himself worthy of crossing blows with Xing Yu now,” the middle-aged man said.

He formed a hand seal and told the white-haired man and black-haired man, “You may return.”

The middle-aged man changed his hand seal. The spirit formation gate reverted into a copper ellipse, and the unique eyes vanished as well.

The middle-aged man turned his attention toward Zi Ling, who was trapped and waiting for Chu Feng to return.

“That lass appears to be close to Chu Xuanyuan’s son. She must be his daughter-in-law?” the middle-aged man mumbled.

“She’s indeed Chu Feng’s lover,” the colossal being replied.

“Heh...” The middle-aged man’s lips curled into a malicious smile. He took out a token and formed a hand seal. A surge of teleportation energy enveloped Zi Ling, taking her elsewhere.

“What are you doing? Chu Feng will be worried when he returns and doesn’t see that lady,” the colossal being said.

“Worried? That’s my intention. A son should repay his father’s debt! I’m going to settle the score with his son!”
