Chapter 2972 - Father’s Shadow

“Boom~~~”

At that moment, martial power surged about as heaven and earth trembled.

Two Incomplete Immortal Armaments appeared in Chu Huanyu’s hands.

At that moment, Chu Huanyu’s aura increased once again.

In fact, he even unleashed an Immortal Technique that covered his body with lightning, making him appear to be invincible.

“Bang~~~”

Suddenly, a loud sound was heard. Chu Huanyu soared into the sky. Once he reached the sky, the two Incomplete Immortal Armaments in his hand slashed forth simultaneously in a cross. His attack swept through space itself, shattering it in the process, as they shot toward the ferocious beasts..

“Bang~~~”

However, when the attack approached, one of the ten ferocious beasts swept its tail, and Chu Huanyu’s attack was easily neutralized.

“Roar~~~”

Following that, that ferocious beast opened its mouth and a sound wave visible to the naked eye shot toward Chu Huanyu.

At that moment, Chu Huanyu’s expression turned ashen. He knew very well that if that sound wave were to hit him, he would likely be completely annihilated.

“Buzz~~~”

However, right when the sound wave was about to hit Chu Huanyu, it suddenly disappeared.

It was Chu Xuanzhengfa. Chu Xuanzhengfa had neutralized the sound wave.

Not only had Chu Xuanzhengfa neutralized the sound wave, but he also used a special method to pacify the ferocious beast that had attacked Chu Huanyu.

“Thank you senior,” Chu Huanyu clasped his fist.

Chu Xuanzhengfa smiled lightly after hearing Chu Huanyu’s thanks. Then, he looked to Chu Haoyan and Chu Ruoshi. “Is there anyone else that wishes to take on the ten guardian beasts? Rest assured, with me here, those ten guardian beasts will not be able to harm you all.”

However, even though Chu Xuanzhengfa declared that, no one was willing to take on the challenge. None of them wanted to disgrace themselves.

“Well then, is there anyone else who suspects this Ten Souls Pearl to be fake?” Chu Xuanzhengfa asked.

The crowd lowered their heads silently. As matters stood, only a fool would now think the Ten Souls Pearl to be fake.

“Chu Feng, Lingxi, in that case, how did the two of you manage to subdue the Ten Souls Pearl?” Chu Xuanzhengfa looked to Chu Feng and Chu Lingxi.

“That’s right, how did the two of them accomplish that?”

Once Chu Xuanzhengfa asked that question, everyone’s gaze turned to Chu Feng and Chu Lingxi.

“I didn’t do anything. Chu Feng was the one who helped me subdue the Ten Souls Pearl,” Chu Lingxi said. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Oh?” Hearing those words, the smile on Chu Xuanzhengfa’s face grew even stronger. He turned to Chu Feng and asked, “Chu Feng, was that what happened?”

“Senior Zhengfa, that is correct,” Chu Feng nodded.

“In that case, is it possible for you to attempt it again so that we can understand how you did it?” Chu Xuanzhengfa said.

“Of course,” Chu Feng nodded again.

Then, Chu Feng began to set up his hypnosis formation. It was the same as the time when he was in the Death Gate’s pond. Chu Feng spent an entire hour to finish hypnotizing the ten guardian beasts.

Then, before the crowd’s eyes, he bypassed the ten guardian beasts and grabbed the Ten Souls Pearl with his hand.

The next moment, the ten guardian beasts turned into ten streams of gaseous substances and assimilated into the Ten Souls Pearl, returning it to a complete state.

“He... he actually really accomplished it. Furthermore, he did it by relying on a spirit formation.”

“That’s not what’s important. What’s important is that Chu Feng’s world spirit techniques have actually already reached Exalted-cloak. He has actually become an Exalted-cloak World Spiritist at such a young age.”

Upon personally witnessing Chu Feng’s world spirit techniques, those Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations that did not know Chu Feng well finally had a whole new level of respect toward him.

It was only at that moment that they realized that Chu Feng didn’t possess an undeserved reputation. At the very least, he had accomplished something that was impossible for Chu Huanyu using world spirit techniques.

Furthermore, everyone knew that among the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations, Chu Huanyu and Chu Haoyan were very close in strength.

At the moment when the crowd were astonished, Chu Feng flew back down and arrived beside Chu Lingxi. He once again handed her the Ten Souls Pearl.

“He actually really ended up handing the Ten Souls Pearl to Chu Lingxi just like that.”

“That’s simply too magnanimous, no? That’s the Ten Souls Pearl, something extremely beneficial to possessors of Heavenly Lightning Bloodlines,” the crowd were all very puzzled by Chu Feng’s action, as his action had simply surpassed their level of understanding.

“Chu Feng, do you understand what that Ten Souls Pearl does?” Chu Xuanzhengfa asked.

“I do,” Chu Feng said.

“Since you do, why did you hand the Ten Souls Pearl to Lingxi instead of using it yourself?” Chu Xuanzhengfa asked.

“Senior, did you know that this Ten Souls Pearl had already been discovered by someone many years ago?” Chu Feng asked.

“I do. That person was your grandfather, Lord Chu Hanxian,” Chu Xuanzhengfa said.

“My grandfather declared that the Ten Souls Pearl was unqualified to fuse with the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique,” Chu Feng said.

“This!!!” Once Chu Feng said those words, he immediately brought forth a massive commotion.

Not only was the Ten Souls Pearl a clan-protection treasure of their Chu Heavenly Clan, but it was also a divine artifact that they yearned after. They would naturally feel very uncomfortable hearing Chu Feng insult the Ten Souls Pearl in such a manner.

“What my grandfather said is a bit excessive,” Chu Feng added.

After he said those words, the crowd’s uncomfortable hearts eased greatly.

They thought to themselves, ‘In the end, it was Chu Feng’s grandfather’s remark. Even if it’s excessive, it’s unrelated to Chu Feng.’

However, to their surprise, Chu Feng spoke again, “However, when the Ten Souls Pearl really ended up in my hand, I discovered that what my grandfather said is correct. While the Ten Souls Pearl is very powerful, it is indeed unqualified to fuse with the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique.”

At that moment, the crowd was dumbfounded. They had an expression as if they had been fed dog shit.

Only Chu Xuanzhengfa smiled lightly. He was actually feeling very gratified to see Chu Feng acting like this. The reason for that was because... Chu Feng was acting just like Chu Xuanyuan back then.
