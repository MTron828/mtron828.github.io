Chapter 5074: The Significance of the Three Plaques

It didn’t take long for an army of ten thousand Asura Evil Spirits to arrive from the sky. Each of them commanded a powerful aura that was far superior to the guards surrounding Chu Feng. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

The one leading the group was riding on a gigantic beast morphed out of an Asura Evil Spirit. The airs he emanated were grand and imposing.

The moment he appeared, all of the Asura Evil Spirits in the vicinity fell to their knees and kowtowed to him.

Chu Feng recognized the man. He was the master of these Asura Evil Spirits, the Asura King!

“Back down.”

At the Asura King’s command, the Asura Evil Spirits immediately retreated. The Asura King continued to assess Yaoyao from his gigantic beast, and his sharp eyes slowly mellowed down. A smile emerged on his icy face.

His silhouette suddenly blurred, and he appeared in front of Yaoyao the next instant.

“Brightmoon, it’s you! My good daughter, you’ve come back to find me!”

He carried Yaoyao up with adoration in his eyes. His words caught Chu Feng by surprise.

Yaoyao is his daughter?

“Who are you calling Brightmoon? That name sounds horrendous. Call me Yaoyao instead.”

However, Yaoyao expressed her contempt toward the name. She pushed the Asura King away and leaped out from his arms before returning to Chu Feng’s side.

“Who are you?”

Seeing this, the Asura King turned his sight toward Chu Feng.

Boom!

Just a mere look from the Asura King made Chu Feng feel as if his soul was going to explode. Even breathing became incredibly laborious to him, to the point that he thought that he was going to lose his life.

The Asura King was far stronger than he had expected!

“You can’t hurt him! He’s my daddy. If you dare hurt him, I’ll kill myself right now and make it impossible for you to leave the Asura Graveyard!”

Yaoyao noticed the pressure Chu Feng was under, so she hurled her fist at the Asura King and shouted.

“Daddy? Brightmoon, what are you saying? I’m your father!”

The Asura King shot a furious glare at Chu Feng.

“You are the one who kidnapped my Brightmoon and deceived her!”

Rage blazed in the Asura King’s eyes. He was intending to murder Chu Feng.

“He didn’t deceive me. I remember everything. I know that you’re my blood-related father, but you sacrificed me and my mother for your so-called ambitions. I don’t recognize you as my daddy. I only have one daddy, and he’s Chu Feng!

“If not for him, I wouldn’t have returned to this horrible place!” Yaoyao said indignantly.

It seemed like she was reminded of her painful memories. Tears began brimming in her eyes.

Seeing that, Chu Feng quickly pulled her into his embrace. He realized that Yaoyao did know her own origin, just that it was too painful that she didn’t want to speak of it.

“Brightmoon, you… remember everything?”

Guilt appeared on the face of the Asura King. That confirmed Chu Feng’s suspicion that the Asura King had done something horrible to Yaoyao. Yaoyao thought that she was nothing but a sacrificial lamb to the Asura King, and that made her reluctant to help the Asura Evil Spirits.

She was thankful to Chu Feng when he took her away from this place, which was why she would rather recognize Chu Feng as her father than acknowledge the Asura King.

If not for Chu Feng meeting with trouble, she would have never returned to this place.

“I’ll say it one last time. I’m Yaoyao, not Brightmoon! Stop calling me by that awful name! I don’t like it!” Yaoyao hollered.

Her rage was fully conveyed despite her childlike voice.

“Alright alright, Yaoyao. I’ll call you Yaoyao since that’s the name you like. Yaoyao, I know that I’m not a qualified father. Your mother is also… Haa…

“Yaoyao, you have to know that I’m doing this for the sake of our Asura World Spirit Army. I hope that you can understand that I have no choice either,” the Asura King said.

“You don’t have to say anything. I know what I have to do. I came back to help you leave this place. However, I have a condition. You have to help my father take care of a group of baddies once you leave this place!” Yaoyao said.

“Baddies? Who are you referring to?” the Asura King asked.

“Allow me to fill you in on the details,” Chu Feng interjected.

He quickly told them about the crisis faced by the Nine Souls Galaxy.

“Hah! I was still wondering what it is. That’s a walk in the park for our Asura World Spirit Army!” the Asura King declared proudly.

“Let’s head over right now,” Yaoyao said, knowing that Chu Feng was in a rush.

The Asura King was conflicted to see how much Yaoyao cared for Chu Feng, but he did want to leave the Asura Graveyard as soon as possible. Thus, he issued an order informing the upper echelons of the Asura World Spirit Army to head to the Asura King Palace.

Once again, Chu Feng walked through the grand doors of the Asura King Palace. It still felt incredibly intimidating to him. As he proceeded deeper inside, he soon encountered three enormous floating plaques, each spanning over a hundred thousand meters.

The leftmost plaque was placed vertically and had the word ‘Hellfire’ written on it. The remaining part of the plaque was awkwardly empty, indicating that the plaque was incomplete. However, there was a bizarre black inferno blazing beneath the plaque, crackling terrifyingly with the roars of thousands of beasts.

No words were needed to describe how dangerous this inferno was. Even Chu Feng would be instantaneously turned to ashes if he fell in.

The rightmost plaque was also placed vertically and had the words ‘King’s Stand’ written on it. The remaining part of the plaque was awkwardly empty, indicating that it was incomplete too. Beneath the plaque was a humongous golden stand that was delicately inscribed with runes reminiscent of artwork. These runes were extremely profound that even Chu Feng couldn’t understand them.

In contrast to the terrifying black inferno, this humongous golden stand looked like a treasure from heaven. It was none other than the King’s Stand.

It was on this very King’s Stand that the Asura King, Lord Yunliang, and the experts of the Asura Evil Spirits had come together to construct a formation around Yaoyao back then.

The middle plaque was slightly peculiar compared to the other two beside it. It was placed horizontally, and there was not a single word written on it at all. However, there was a ten thousand meters tall tower beneath it, and at the tip of the tower was a throne. This throne comprised countless coiling dragons, looking both beautiful and authoritative.

Compared to the golden stand on the right, this throne emanated an even more divine vibe.

However, this throne was split into two from the middle. It was composed of two different colors and materials. The left side was made out of the blazing black inferno whereas the right side gave off a golden shimmer. Clearly, it was a composite product of the black inferno and the golden stand.

Chu Feng thought that it was the Asura King’s throne, but he couldn’t understand why it was constructed here. He had also never seen the Asura King sitting on it before.

Back then, when he first saw the three plaques, as well as the black inferno, the imposing golden stand, and the sacred throne, he felt a jolt in his heart. The feeling of awe had hardly lessened even though he had become much stronger than before.

He was curious to know what the missing words on the three plaques were and what their absence meant.
