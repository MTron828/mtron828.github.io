Chapter 5031: You Have Underestimated Me Too

“In view that you’re a prodigy too, I’ll give you a chance. As long as you serve me well, I’ll turn a blind eye to your transgression. What do you think?” Jiang Kongping said.

There was a lecherous smile as he said those words, and he even grabbed his crotch. His intention was made very clear here.

“What is wrong with you?” Chu Feng berated.

“Well, this is what I enjoy,” Jiang Kongping replied as he gestured to the dead men lying on the ground.

Chu Feng took a second glance and realized that there were lacerations on those men’s nether regions too.

“I’ve seen a lot of beasts, but you’re the first one that left me feeling utterly repulsed,” Chu Feng replied.

“You sure have the guts to say that to me. Now I’m more determined than ever to make you submit to me. I’ll show you what a true man is like!”

Once again, Jiang Kongping formed a series of hand seals before pointing his finger at Chu Feng.

Whoosh!

Ferocious roars echoed from his body, but three tigers were manifested this time around. They swiftly spread out and encircled Chu Feng.

All of them moved at a much faster speed than before, and the strength they harnessed was much greater too.

“Despicable. You were setting up this formation while you were talking to me!”

Chu Feng could tell that this formation wasn’t completed on a whim. Jiang Kongping must have been secretly constructing this formation while chatting with him, or else he wouldn’t have been able to manifest three tigers at once.

He quickly constructed the same speed enhancement formation on his feet and leaped into the sky, attempting to dodge the aggression of the three tigers.

However, those three tigers had already sealed off all of his escape routes. One of them was even charging straight at him,

Chu Feng quickly manifested another spirit power sword and hacked it down on the approaching tiger.

Klang!

A jarring metallic sound echoed, and the spirit power sword was split into two. In contrast, the tiger remained completely unharmed.

The tiger opened its mouth wide and bit down on Chu Feng.

Pu!

Fresh blood splattered all over the ground.

Chu Feng was trapped in the tiger’s mouth, unable to move at all. His body had been crushed by the tiger’s jaws, causing blood to continuously flow from his wounds.

“Your spirit power is formidable, but it looks like your mind is lacking. The prowess of your spirit power sword is much weaker than before. But even if it’s as strong as before, all it’ll do is make my tigers shed a bit of fur. You should be able to tell that my Wrathful Tiger Formation is much stronger now,” Jiang Kongping scoffed.

“Heh…”

However, Chu Feng let out a cold sneer and turned to look at Jiang Kongping.

“Why are you acting so arrogant when you haven’t even won yet?” Chu Feng asked.

“I haven’t won yet? It looks like you aren’t going to admit defeat until you’re at your deathbed. Very well, let’s see how you’ll deal with this then!”

Viciousness flickered across Jiang Kongping’s eyes as he flicked his finger. In response, the tiger clamped its jaws even tighter around Chu Feng.

Pu!

Under the immense force, Chu Feng exploded into a puddle of blood.

Jiang Kongping was astonished to see that. He had controlled the force exerted by the tiger to ensure that it wasn’t enough to take Chu Feng’s life.

“That is…?”

To his astonishment, Chu Feng’s flesh and blood were still moving despite having exploded into bits. They turned into spirit power and converged in mid-air.

It turned out that it wasn’t Chu Feng’s real body!

“Damn it!”

Jiang Kongping realized that he had been tricked.

The next moment, he felt a searing sensation in his chest. He lowered his head and saw that a spirit power sword had plunged into his chest. The culprit was none other than Chu Feng.

Chu Feng was completely unscathed.

“You made use of the opportunity while we were chatting to construct a substitution formation and sneak behind me?” Jiang Kongping asked.

He had already guessed the truth, but he still wanted to verify his guess.

“What’s the point of asking when you have already figured it out?” Chu Feng replied with mocking laughter.

“Despicable fellow. You resorted to underhanded means because you dare not to confront me head-on!” Jiang Kongping roared angrily.

He was certain that Chu Feng wasn’t a match for him. He felt that he had lost not because he was weaker but that he had gotten careless.

“I admit that your formation is formidable, but a battle between world spiritists isn’t just about whose formation is stronger. It’s about utilizing each formation to its best. Surely you should understand that since you’re a world spiritist yourself?” Chu Feng asked.

“If you wish to put it that way, I’ll have no choice but to agree with you. Your control over formations is lacking in comparison to mine, but you do know how to put them to good use. You’re indeed a formidable talent.

“Unfortunately, you still lost to me today. You should start preparing yourself to serve me!”

As he said those words, a gleeful smile broke out on Jiang Kongping’s face.

Sensing that something was amiss, Chu Feng quickly withdrew his spirit power sword and backed away, but as soon as he started moving, he felt a tremendous pressure that caused his speed to slow.

It was then that he realized that he was surrounded by Jiang Kongping’s spirit power. This spirit power was denser than what was inside the Wrathful Tiger Formation.

Chu Feng quickly looked at his surroundings before widening his eyes in realization.

The sleeping chamber he was in turned out to be a formation itself. It was an imprisonment and slaughter formation. The powerful spirit power that was slowing his movement had come from it.

“You constructed this formation in advance?” Chu Feng asked.

He could sense that the formidable might behind the formation, but such a formation couldn’t have been set up in a short span of time.

“You have discerning eyes. Indeed, it took me seven days in order to construct it. I acknowledge your means. If I have not prepared this hand in advance, I might have really lost to you due to my earlier carelessness.

“Unfortunately, you stepped into my territory, so you’ll have to play by my rules. There’s no way you could stand a chance against me inside my formation. You got careless and underestimated me. Did you think that I was trash that only knows how to frolic around? Think again!

“Now, I shall teach you what a true man feels like! This is the price you’ll have to pay for underestimating me.”

Jiang Kongping licked his lips and began taking off his clothes.

“Haa…”

Chu Feng knew what he was going to do next, but he wasn’t intimidated at all. On the contrary, he let out a laugh.

“I did underestimate you, but it seems like it goes both ways,” Chu Feng said.
