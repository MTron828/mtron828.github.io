Chapter 4634: Yu Sha’s Growth

“Yu Sha, you’re awake?”

Chu Feng quickly turned his head around. He wasn’t as excited as before, but there was still a look of joy on his face.

The person who had just called him was no other than Yu Sha.

At this very moment, Yu Sha had opened her eyes, and she was looking at Chu Feng intently.

“What did you do while I was cultivating?” Yu Sha asked Chu Feng.

“Something good, of course. How is it? Did your cultivation grow significantly? Did you manage to fully assimilate the Divine Stone of the Seven Realms?” Chu Feng asked.

Yu Sha had used a special method to cultivate, so Chu Feng couldn’t really discern what happened to the Divine Stone of the Seven Realms.

On top of that, the Purplehaze Ghost King Pearl did have the ability to wake up world spirits, so Chu Feng couldn’t tell if Yu Sha had awoken before she could fully assimilate the divine stone.

“I’ve already assimilated it a long time ago, but I was too anxious to assimilate it that my state of mind was disturbed. I ended up trapping myself in the illusions of my inner demons,” Yu Sha replied.

“So, I helped you to escape from the illusions of your inner demons?” Chu Feng asked with a hint of worry in his voice.

He knew that the so-called ‘illusions of her inner demons’ was actually a sign of her cultivation going berserk. If it wasn’t handled properly, she could have been in great danger.

“Yes,” Yu Sha nodded in response.

Hearing that, Chu Feng heaved a sigh of relief. It was good as long as Yu Sha was fine.

“In other words, you owe me a favor, right? How do you intend to repay the favor?” Chu Feng looked at Yu Sha with a gleeful smile.

Yu Sha didn’t respond, but she began averting her eyes.

“Alright alright, I’m just kidding,” Chu Feng quickly clarified.

Unlike Eggy, Yu Sha didn’t respond to his jokes very well. More often than not, instead of clearing up the air, his jokes only made the situation even more awkward. However, he was already too used to cracking jokes every now and then that it was hard for him to kick the habit.

“While I was in the illusions of my inner demons, I was still conscious, so I could sense a bit of what you went through. If you leave this place and encounter Gongsun Yuntian once more, you need not be afraid of him. If you wish to deal with him, I can help you,” Yu Sha said.

“Lass, that Gongsun Yuntian has grasped rank five Dragon Transformation Sensation, which means that he possesses strength comparable to a rank one Martial Exalted level cultivator. Have you... reached that level too?

“Or do you have some overwhelming fighting prowess that allows you to defeat enemies stronger than you, making you a match for Martial Exalted level cultivators too?” Chu Feng asked excitedly.

Based on what Yu Sha was saying, it would appear that she had grown by a fair bit during this period of time. Given Chu Feng’s current limited strength, Yu Sha’s newfound strength would surely be a huge aid to him.

“My cultivation has reached rank nine Utmost Exalted level after assimilating the Divine Stone of the Seven Realms. I was initially still some way off from reaching Martial Exalted level, but I managed to gain some martial comprehension while I was trapped in the illusions of my inner demons, and the thing you just used has nourished my powers too, so I ended up making a breakthrough,” Yu Sha replied.

“You just made a breakthrough? So, what cultivation level are you at right now?” Chu Feng asked.

“Rank one Martial Exalted level,” Yu Sha replied.

“That’s great. Aiyo, my darling! I knew that the Purplehaze Ghost King Pearl was amazing, but who could have thought that it would be such a great treasure?” Chu Feng shook his fists in excitement.

While there was just a sliver of difference between rank nine Utmost Exalted level and rank one Martial Exalted level, the gap that stood between the two of them was massive. It was qualitative growth, different from just rising a rank within Utmost Exalted level.

With Yu Sha’s rank one Martial Exalted level cultivation, Chu Feng wouldn’t have to fear Gongsun Yuntian even when they were out of this Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace! While he wasn’t certain what kind of trump cards Gongsun Yuntian had up his sleeves, he was confident in Yu Sha’s fighting prowess.

“While my cultivation has grown by a fair bit, similar to the rest of you, some of my powers have been sealed as well. While my cultivation has reached rank one Martial Exalted level, I’m unable to tap into a lot of my means anymore. So, I’ll be helpless if I were to encounter a rank two Martial Exalted level cultivator,” Yu Sha replied.

“Was a lot of your powers sealed? Is it possible to unseal them?” Chu Feng asked worriedly.

One must know that Yu Sha possessed the power to rival enemies three ranks stronger than her in the past. When she summoned her terrifying black war steed, her power further grew to the level where she could defeat enemies that were four ranks stronger than her.

It was with such frightening prowess that she was able to fight toe-to-toe with Linghu Hongfei back then. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

It was precisely because Yu Sha used to be that powerful that he was worried that Yu Sha would feel downcast at the sealing of her abilities.

“It’s possible to recover them, but it’ll take some time. Your earlier help has allowed me to condition my physical state back to its best condition, but still, it doesn’t change the fact that I’m still new to the Martial Exalted level. So far, I still haven’t figured out a way to unseal my powers yet,” Yu Sha explained.

“It’s good as long as you can unseal them. I believe that this matter won’t pose much difficulty for you. Even if you really find yourself stuck, we can work together to figure out a solution,” Chu Feng said.

“Mm.” Yu Sha nodded.

After chatting with Yu Sha for a little longer, Chu Feng left his World Spirit Space.

Even though Yu Sha’s growth had indeed boosted Chu Feng’s confidence significantly, he knew that he had to quickly leave the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace. Otherwise, he wouldn’t even get a chance to fight Gongsun Yuntian at all.

After all, only the first five people who walked out of here would be qualified to proceed on to the next round.

And when Chu Feng finally left, Yu Sha turned her gaze toward Eggy.

Her gaze was nonchalant at first glance, but if one were to take a closer look, one would notice a hint of envy in her eyes.

“The two of you must have been through a lot together for him to care so much for you,” Yu Sha murmured.

...

As soon as Chu Feng returned his consciousness back to his body, Xia Yan rushed up to him and asked, “How is it? Is the Purplehaze Ghost King Pearl useful?”

“Yes, it’s exceptionally useful.” Chu Feng nodded in satisfaction, his face still carrying an excited smile.

“What is its use? Tell us!” Xia Yan asked curiously.

“Well... You’ll know in due time.” Chu Feng decided to keep it a mystery for the time being.

“Tsk! I bet you must have failed to activate the pearl, so it isn’t usable at all, right?” Seeing that Chu Feng wasn’t speaking at all, Xia Yan intentionally tried to taunt him so as to loosen his lips.

However, Chu Feng wasn’t falling for it at all. Instead, he turned to Xiao Yu and asked, “Right, Brother Xiao, did you manage to find what you were looking for?”

“I didn’t.” Xiao Yu shook his head.

“I see. I’m afraid that won’t be able to help you with that because I can’t afford to use the power of this palace anymore. Other than that, while I was obtaining the Purplehaze Ghost King Pearl, I managed to find the path out of here. I’m planning to leave this place now,” Chu Feng said.

“You’re leaving? Chu Feng, you aren’t going to wait a while longer? I reckon that those from the Gongsun Clan are still lingering in the area. It’s still too early to head out right now!” Xia Yan said.

“Isn’t it fine to be the first one to leave? Why should we wait for them?” Chu Feng rebutted.

“Ah? Are you planning... to proceed on to the next round?”

When Xia Yan asked that question, Xiao Yu also turned to look at Chu Feng in astonishment.

The two of them were planning to wait for five of the prodigies of the Gongsun Clan to leave the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace first before finding their way out. This way, they would be able to avoid clashing with them.

In other words, they had already decided to forfeit on this trial.

However, according to what Chu Feng was saying right now... it would appear that he was planning to seriously compete in the marriage convention.

Despite the two shocked gazes directed at him, Chu Feng didn’t answer their question. Instead, with a light smile, he began constructing a formation.

His reaction was more than enough to confirm their doubts.

“Chu Feng, are you out of your mind? You might still be able to fend off Gongsun Yuntian with your spirit power in here, but once you’re out of here, you won’t stand a chance against him anymore! You mustn’t look down on Gongsun Yuntian! He’s one of the most talented world spiritists in the Nine Souls Galaxy!” Xia Yan reminded anxiously.

“That suits me just fine. I was thinking of meeting this so-called most talented world spiritist outside,” Chu Feng said.
