Chapter 4165 - Rather Terrible

“It would appear that you still remember me,” Chu Feng said with a beaming smile.

His smile indirectly admitted his identity.

“So it’s actually you.”

“How could your progress be this fast?” asked the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted with enormous shock.

He naturally remembered Asura. But, although Asura was powerful, he remembered that his world spirit techniques had been inferior to his own.

Yet, at that moment he had been completely surpassed.

“Perhaps... this is talent,” Chu Feng shrugged his shoulders.

“It would appear that this old man will truly end up dying here today.”

Upon discovering that his opponent was actually Asura, the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted knew that no matter how much he begged, it would all be useless.

After all, he knew very well what he had done to him back then.

“However, this old man would rather die by my own hands than die at your hands.”

“Asura, remember this! Even after his old man has become a ghost, I will not let you get away with this!”

The Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted cursed furiously. Then, he opened his palm and smashed it onto his chest.

As the palm landed, energy ripples spread out. With a muffled sound, the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted was reduced to a fog of blood.

At the same time, his aura had completely disappeared.

The Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted had really killed himself.

After seeing the Bloodmist Heavenly Exaited’s suicide, Chu Feng smiled and shook his head.

Mockery and ridicule filled his smile.

“Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted, it’s time for you to accept your fate. This sort of final struggle is useless.”

“Could it be that you still didn’t realize that my world spirit techniques have surpassed your own?”

“Why are you bothering with such tricks?”

As Chu Feng spoke, he waved his arm, and a dazzling golden light shot out of his sleeve and entered the bloody fog.

Once the golden light entered the bloody fog, the fog immediately began to transform. Soon, a figure appeared below the fog. That was the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted.

It turned out that the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted had faked his death! ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“You bastard, you’re truly not planning to let me live?!”

After being discovered again, the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted was truly on the verge of crying.

The trick he had used earlier was his final life-saving trick.

He knew very well that since even this trick of his had been seen through, there was no way for him to escape alive anymore.

“Today, I will have you suffer several times the amount of torture you gave my friends back then.”

As Chu Feng spoke, a fierce look appeared in his eyes. Then, his golden spirit power began to transform. It turned into many sharp blades that pierced into the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted’s body, shuttling back and forth repeatedly.

“Eeeahhh!”

Being tortured in such a manner, the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted began to scream miserably.

His soul was being ravaged.

This torture was simply death by a thousand cuts.

However, an ordinary execution through this method would gradually slice one’s flesh until one’s bones were reached. This would continue until death was attained.

But, Chu Feng’s method of execution by a thousand cuts was aimed at the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted’s soul.

The Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted’s soul was gradually being removed.

It was common knowledge that once a martial cultivator reached a certain level of cultivation, they no longer needed their physical bodies, and their true foundation would lie in their souls.

Because of that, the torture that Chu Feng was inflicting on the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted was even more unbearable than having one’s physical body, having one’s flesh, be gradually sliced away.

“You vicious little bastard! You shall suffer a miserable death! You will die a miserable death!”

“Even if I, Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted, must become an evil ghost, I will still curse your entire life!”

Completely helpless, the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted could only curse at Chu Feng.

However, Chu Feng was not at all afraid of his curses. Instead, he actually felt like laughing after hearing them.

Chu Feng knew that it was a powerless curse. If he had the ability to actually do anything, the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted wouldn’t be cursing like that.

That said, things had been nowhere as effortless when Chu Feng had confronted the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted before.

Was the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted’s current behavior not a manifestation of Chu Feng’s growth?

Because of that, Chu Feng actually felt slightly pleased.

He had managed to surmount another mountain.

“Little bastard, so it was you.”

Suddenly, another voice was heard.

Looking towards the direction of the voice, Chu Feng noticed eight figures standing in the distant sky and looking at him.

Those eight people must’ve concealed their auras earlier. That was why Chu Feng had not been able to sense them at all.

Chu Feng recognized all eight of them.

They were the four leaders that had allied with Long Daozhi, and the four world spiritists they had invited.

They had been driven away by Long Daozhi earlier. Never would Chu Feng have expected to encounter them there.

Most importantly, they were looking at Chu Feng with ill-intended gazes. This made him realize one thing.

“Crap!”

Chu Feng examined himself, and immediately felt his heart tensing up.

He had originally altered his appearance.

Even if they saw him, they shouldn’t be able to recognize him.

But, when Chu Feng received the backlash from the protective formation earlier, his body had been destroyed.

Then, whilst treating his injuries, he had put all his focus on controlling the protective formation and restoring his body. Because of that, he had forgotten to disguise himself again.

Because of that, Chu Feng’s injuries had healed, but his appearance had been revealed. That was why they had managed to recognize him.

“Little bastard, you are truly vicious. You’re actually using this cruel of a method to torture someone?”

“You’re unwilling to even give him a pleasant death?” said the old lady amongst the four leaders.

As they saw Chu Feng, they’d naturally also caught sight of the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted being tortured by Chu Feng.

Furthermore, they were all able to tell that Chu Feng’s torturing method was extremely cruel.

Because of that, they gained a whole new opinion of Chu Feng.

They realized that the brat from the Ancestral Martial Starfield was also a vicious and merciless fellow.

“Milords, please look carefully! That... seems to be the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted!” Suddenly, one of the four world spiritists pointed to the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted and cried out in alarm.

“Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted?”

The others immediately looked to the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted, upon hearing those words. They were all alarmed.

“That really does seem to be him.”

“Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted, why would he...”

They were all people that had done some transactions with the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted.

Thus, even though the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted was currently in a soul body state, they were all able to recognize him.

However, upon confirming that it was the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted that was being tortured, they became even more surprised.

Their surprise was due to their understanding of the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted’s strength.

Especially his world spirit techniques, the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted was someone who had obtained their acknowledgement.

Even though they also knew that Chu Feng’s world spirit techniques were also very powerful, they had never imagined that his world spirit techniques would be so strong that not even the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted would be a match for him.

“This little bastard is quite a talent.”

When they looked at Chu Feng again, the four leaders all sighed emotionally.

Ignoring their different positions, ignoring their grudges, they had to recognize Chu Feng’s strength.

The brat from the Ancestral Martial Starfield was truly a rare talent.

In fact, he could even be said to be a true demon-level genius.

Enduring his pain, the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted shouted, “Everyone, this brat has the Dragon Vein Source Stone on him!”

“All of my treasures were plundered by him too!”

“Should you all rescue me, those treasures shall all be yours!”

This was the only opportunity he had.

“What? The Dragon Vein Source Stone?!”

Shock filled the four leaders’ faces the moment they heard the words ‘Dragon Vein Source Stone’. At the same time, greed filled their eyes.
