Chapter 5234: Because Of This God

“He’s a person whom we should rally to our side, but the rules of our sect prohibit me from doing so… It’ll be terrible if they get to him first. What should I do?”

The woman looked at Chu Feng with a conflicted look on her face.

Meanwhile, Chu Feng dared not to continue exploring the valley, fearing that the woman had other means to observe him. The gap in their strength was simply too huge that he had to take extreme caution.

It was fortunate that the woman, possibly due to her association with Bitter Remembrance, had chosen to only erase his memories. She even apologized to him after doing so, an indication that she was a kind person.

Any other cultivator with her level of strength would have probably outright killed anyone who dared to intrude on their territory. There would have been no need for them to waste their effort to erase the intruder’s memory.

Shortly after returning to the valley, Chu Feng learned about Yue Ling’s fortuitous encounter and immediately examined her condition. He quickly noticed that something was amiss.

It was well-concealed, but he could still tell that the energy inside Yue Ling’s body wasn’t intrinsic to her, meaning that someone else had infused it into her.

“Was it her doing? She’s truly a kind person, but why doesn’t she offer me any help with my cultivation then? I mean, I possess the Ruler’s Bloodline.”

Chu Feng guessed that Yue Ling’s recovery was the woman’s doing.

He still remembered how even a casual stone that woman fed to a statue harnessed enough spirit power for him to make a breakthrough to God-cloak. It was just a pity that the woman displayed no inclination to help him, so he could only rely on himself.

That woman was under no obligation to help him even if she had the power to do so, after all. With that, he decided to leave the valley.

When he expressed his thoughts to Bitter Remembrance, the latter asked with a smile, “Young hero Chu Feng, did you find anything?”

“Well… Elder Bitter Remembrance, there’s indeed nothing here at all. I shan’t waste my time searching the area anymore,” Chu Feng replied awkwardly.

“I’m glad to hear that. That shows that my eyes are still as sharp as ever.”

Bitter Remembrance’s smile further widened in confidence.

Chu Feng could only respond with a bitter smile. The truth was that he had not only uncovered a new passageway but even learned shocking secrets about the world, but he couldn’t divulge anything or else the woman would know that his memories hadn’t been erased.

“Young master Chu Feng, do you really not need me to accompany you?” Song Yuwei asked worriedly.

She wouldn’t be able to live with herself if something happened to the grandson of her young miss. She should have been the one protecting him, being the stronger cultivator here, but she was worried that she would become a burden to Chu Feng, especially after what had happened the previous time.

“Elder Yuwei, please rest assured and wait here for me. I’ll return here safe and sound after I’m done dealing with the Situ World Spiritist Clan,” Chu Feng replied confidently.

Song Yuwei responded with a nod.

Chu Feng left the forbidden area and headed to the Situ World Spiritist Clan’s spirit beast hunting area. It was located in a vast mountain range that had been sealed off by a gigantic compound formation.

The gigantic formation was formed by piecing multiple smaller formations together in an intricate yet ingenious way. It was a level of complexity that Chu Feng could hardly imagine. From the gigantic formation itself, Chu Feng could tell that the founder of the Situ World Spiritist Clan was indeed a formidable figure.

It was just a pity that his descendants were both despicable and incompetent, resulting in the Situ World Spiritist Clan’s eventual decline in the world of cultivation. It was only a matter of time before they vanished from the face of the world, and Chu Feng was here to ensure that.

Chu Feng spent some time circling the outer perimeter of the mountain range sealed off by the formation. He was hoping to find juniors of the Situ World Spiritist Clan to dig out their dantian and put it into himself. That would have allowed him to participate in the spirit beast hunt.

He wouldn’t be able to massacre the juniors of the Situ World Spiritist Clan if he couldn’t even enter the mountain range, let alone claim the fortuitous encounters in there. While hunting the spirit beasts only reinforced one’s spirit power, it was still a huge enticement to world spiritists.

After all, who wouldn’t want to become stronger?

Other than that, Chu Feng also knew that even if he could do as he pleased inside the mountain range, he would be helpless to the devices of the Situ World Spiritist Clan once he left the area. Thus, he planned to construct a powerful teleportation formation in advance in order to make his escape once he was done with his job.

He could already imagine just how frustrated the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen would be when they saw the culprit who had killed their juniors escaping beneath their eyelids.

Under the observation of Heaven’s Eyes, he soon found a spot with a unique geographical terrain that augmented his spirit power. He should be in a safe position if he constructed a teleportation formation at this spot and further reinforced it with treasures.

It would be hard for his enemies to stop him unless they were extremely powerful.

Based on what Chu Feng knew about the Situ World Spiritist Clan, it should be impossible for them to disrupt the invocation of his teleportation formation unless he had a direct confrontation with them.

To ensure that nothing went wrong, Chu Feng spent three whole days on the formation, even borrowing the power of the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk for it.

To his surprise, the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk seemed to be aware of how important this operation was and fully cooperated with him. With its help, the resulting teleportation formation was so powerful that Chu Feng was confident to make his getaway even if he encountered their God-cloak World Spiritists.

“You have truly done me a huge favor this time around, Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk. I won’t forget the help you have offered me today. If you’re able to speak, you can tell me what you want. I’ll try my best to get it for you,” Chu Feng murmured under his breath.

“Chicken, but just the thighs and the wings. I won’t take anything else.” a voice replied.

“You’re really able to speak?”

Chu Feng was shocked. He knew that the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk possessed sentience, but he didn’t think that the latter would actually be able to talk.

“Brat, you can’t even recognize my voice even after all of the times I have helped you?”

The voice carried a hint of sassiness and displeasure.

“Elder, it’s you! You’re finally willing to respond to me.”

Chu Feng finally recognized it to be the Divine Deer’s voice.

He knew how powerful the Divine Deer was, but the latter was even more unpredictable than the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk. While the Divine Deer did offer him help from time to time, there were also times when she simply left him to the lurch, forcing him to figure out another solution out of his quandaries.

He never thought that a day would come where the Divine Deer took the initiative to talk to him. There was no way he would let this opportunity slip through his fingers.

“Elder, it’s rare for you to strike up a conversation with me. Are you intending to offer me help for my upcoming operation?” Chu Feng asked probingly.

“Help, help. All you know is to ask me for help. Do you take me to be your nanny? Grow a pair and learn how to do things by yourself,” the Divine Deer sneered.

“Elder, I would like to do things by myself too, but I’m still in the midst of my growth. What can I do when my opponents are so much stronger than I am? I wouldn’t have to exact vengeance in such a roundabout manner if I could simply march in and slaughter them all,” Chu Feng replied indignantly. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“What I’m saying is that you shouldn’t rely on me helping you all the time. Isn’t it much better if you learn my abilities instead?” the Divine Deer said.

Chu Feng widened his eyes in delight.

“Elder, does that mean that I have cleared your test?”

The Divine Deer had once told Chu Feng that he had to prove himself worthy within a certain period of time, or else she would leave him and look for another host. What she had just said suggested that he had finally cleared her test and was worthy of inheriting her legacy.

“You do have a thing or two in you, so I’ll reluctantly give you a pass on the test. However, I should tell you that it won’t be that easy to grasp my abilities. You’ll undergo great suffering for that. After all, my abilities are all God-level secret skills,” the Divine Deer said.
