Chapter 5531: Joining Hands with the Phoenix Clan

“What do you have in mind?” Long Chengyu asked.

“I deciphered a few stuff from the compass that’s linked to the formation here. I should be able to modify that avatar armor into an enhancement formation, but we don’t have enough people here right now. That’s why I’d like to ask if you’re interested in joining hands with the Totem Phoenix Clan,” Chu Feng asked.

“I don’t mind if that’s what it takes to deal with the Blood-eyed Qilin Clan,” Long Chengyu replied.

“We concur.” The other Totem Dragon Clansmen expressed their agreement too.

“Since that’s the case, Brother Chengyu, you stay here and protect your clansmen. Miss Muxi, I’ll need you to come with me to look for Feng Jiuyue. If we’re going to join hands, we’ll need a representative from the Totem Dragon Clan to negotiate with them,” Chu Feng said.

“I’ll go with you, Chu Feng,” Long Muxi said.

However, Chu Feng didn’t get straight to action. He waved his hand and brought out a unique cultivation skill manual.

“Try to comprehend this cultivation skill. This will be the key to whether we’ll be able to construct the enhancement formation or not,” Chu Feng said before leaving with Long Muxi.

Shortly after they left, Long Muxi turned to Chu Feng and called out, “Chu Feng.”

“What is it, Miss Muxi?” Chu Feng asked.

“You can just call me Muxi.” Long Muxi didn’t look at Chu Feng when she said those words, but Chu Feng could sense her embarrassment.

Chu Feng chuckled softly before replying, “All right. I’ll call you Muxi from now onward.”

“Chu Feng, how much time do we have left to prepare?” Long Muxi asked.

“Less than two hours, I presume,” Chu Feng replied.

“It won’t be easy to find the Totem Phoenix Clan in this vast place,” Long Muxi expressed her worry.

It was one thing if they were still completing the formations, but now that they had all been completed, the Totem Phoenix Clansmen would have likely gathered together, perhaps even going into hiding. It would be no easy feat to find them under such circumstances.

“Don’t worry. We can make it in time,” Chu Feng replied confidently.

Those words prompted Long Muxi to turn to Chu Feng.

Furious winds battered on his face as they rushed ahead, but she couldn’t help but find his face irresistibly attractive. His eyes were focused on the road, showing no signs of anxiety despite the urgent situation.

Long Muxi nodded slightly before retracting her gaze. This man brought her peace of mind that no one else ever had, not even her father.

…

Chu Feng headed in a specific direction as if he had a clear destination in mind. He soon arrived at an empty clearing and began carefully examining the surroundings.

Moments later, he constructed a deciphering formation before pointing his finger forward.

Weng!

The deciphering formation shot forth, and there was intense irradiation of light. Another formation quickly surfaced under the blinding light. It was a concealment formation.

Chu Feng quickly changed his hand seals and roared, “Break!”

Boom!

Chu Feng’s formation rushed forth and devastated the concealment formation, revealing the people hidden in it—Feng Jiuyue, Feng Tiansheng, and the other Totem Phoenix Clansmen.

There were several severely injured individuals amongst them, and the number of people with them was half of what they initially had.

Chu Feng instinctively knew right away that the Totem Phoenix Clansmen had likely come under the attack of the Blood-eyed Qilin Clan, and those who weren’t with them were likely dead.

“What are you doing, Chu Feng?”

Feng Jiuyue and the other Totem Phoenix Clansmen revealed terrified expressions upon seeing Chu Feng and Long Muxi. Chu Feng had proved himself to be stronger than them, and given their earlier grudge, they were worried that he had come at this juncture to kill them all.

“I didn’t come bearing ill will,” Chu Feng clarified. He glanced at the severely injured Totem Phoenix Clansmen before asking, “Is it the doing of the Blood-eyed Qilin Clan?”

“Yes, they are the culprit,” Feng Jiuyue replied.Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Do you wish to exact vengeance?” Chu Feng asked.

“You’re willing to help us?” Feng Jiuyue was taken aback.

“I didn’t come to help you but to propose an alliance. I can tell you right now that Qi Weidao is a rank five Half-God level cultivator, and he is capable of raising his cultivation by three ranks. On top of that, he has a God Armament in possession. He can easily slaughter all of you if he wants to. In two hours, a formation core that is highly beneficial to all of you will appear. Unless you intend to give up on it, a battle with the Blood-eyed Qilin Clan is inevitable,” Chu Feng said.

“That fellow is that powerful? How do we defeat him? Is Long Chengyu able to raise his cultivation by three ranks too?” Feng Jiuyue and Feng Tiansheng asked.

The only one who could oppose Qi Weidao was Long Chengyu, as he was the only other rank five Half-God level cultivator amongst them. No one else here was a match for him, not even Chu Feng.

“Yes, Brother Chengyu can raise his cultivation by three ranks, but the Blood-eyed Qilin Clan has a way to sacrifice the lives of their clansmen to temporarily raise an individual’s fighting prowess. It’ll be hard for Brother Chengyu to defeat Qi Weidao in a normal battle.

“However, I have a way that might grant Brother Chengyu a better fighting chance against Qi Weidao, and I require your help for that. Come with me if you’re interested. We don’t have much time left. Otherwise, treat it as if I didn’t say anything,” Chu Feng said.

“Let’s go,” Feng Jiuyue said as she led her clansmen into the sky.

Chu Feng smiled at that sight before leading them toward where Long Chengyu and the others were. Just then, he received a voice transmission.

‘Chu Feng, how do you know where they are?” Long Muxi asked.

Chu Feng had directly headed here, which hinted that he was aware that the Totem Phoenix Clansmen had been hiding here.

“It’s a guess, but I do have some basis behind it. Feng Jiuyue is a world spiritist too, so if she chooses to conceal herself and her clansmen, she’ll find a safe spot where the Blood-eyed Qilin Clan won’t be able to find them. Following her train of thought, this place is probably the ideal location for the entire realm,” Chu Feng said.

Long Muxi felt conflicted. This wasn’t the first time she was witnessing Chu Feng’s means, but she was still astonished to hear those words. They were both juniors, but Chu Feng seemed to be so much ahead of her in all aspects.

She looked at the Totem Phoenix Clansmen and noticed that there was a change in their faces. They looked reassured. Despite their earlier hostile relationship—some of them even mocked Chu Feng before entering this place—they still held great faith in Chu Feng’s means.

It was as if they had finally found shelter in the face of an impending storm, such that their hearts could finally be at ease. This was how reassuring it was to have Chu Feng on one’s side. In a way, this also showed how formidable Chu Feng was.

“Is this Chu Feng’s charm?” Long Muxi wondered.
