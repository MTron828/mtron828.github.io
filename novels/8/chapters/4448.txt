Chapter 4448: Profoundness, Emergence of Lightning Soul

Upon seeing the blue lightning appearing from Chu Feng’s body, waves of shock crashed down on the hearts of every single person present on the scene. It felt that every cell in their body was shuddering intensely from the sheer shock traversing through their body.

This was especially so for those from the Yu Heavenly Clan. The looks on their faces revealed the feelings that they felt inside with great clarity.

There was no way they wouldn’t have been able to recognize their own hall protection treasure.

“How did you learn our Soul of Heavenly Lightning?”

One of the elders of the Yu Heavenly Clan pointed to Chu Feng as he asked with a tone burning with fury.

It went without saying that the reason they wanted to take back their clan’s Exalted Taboo Martial Skill manuals from Chu Feng was so that it wouldn’t leak out to others. However, now that Chu Feng had already cultivated it, everything had been rendered meaningless.

“Yu Hong’s Cosmos Sack happens to have this martial skill, so I went ahead to cultivate it. Is there anything wrong about that?” Chu Feng asked.

“No, that’s impossible. That can’t be! Soul of Heavenly Lightning is extremely hard to cultivate. Even after studying it for three years, I was only able to grasp the bare basics of it. I’m still not able to draw out its true strength at all.

“It has only been three days since that Cosmos Sack fell into your hands. There’s no way you could have mastered Soul of Heavenly Lightning to such a degree within just three days!

“Do you take us as fools? Speak the truth! Where did you manage to obtain the manual of our Soul of Heavenly Lightning?” Yu Lie questioned furiously.

He didn’t believe Chu Feng’s explanation at all.

That was the shared sentiment of everyone in the Yu Heavenly Clan. They immediately suspected that Chu Feng had managed to obtain the manual of Soul of Heavenly Lightning elsewhere from someone else.

He must have cultivated the technique for a long time before he was able to master it to such a degree.

“Young friend Chu Feng, did you cultivate some sort of secret art of martial technique that allows you to replicate the martial skill of others?” the Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster asked.

“Elder, this is the real Soul of Heavenly Lightning. I’m not just imitating it,” Chu Feng replied.

“Then how did you manage to master it? Where did you obtain our secret manual from?” an elder of the Yu Heavenly Clan asked lividly.

“Like I said, I obtained it from Yu Hong’s Cosmos Sack. Do you not speak human speech?” Chu Feng eyed the elder with narrowed eyes.

“Are you trying to tell us that you managed to master Soul of Heavenly Lightning within just three short days?” the elder sneered.

“Yes, that’s indeed the case. Is there something wrong with that? Just because none of you are able to do it doesn’t mean that I won’t be able to do it too!” Chu Feng replied.

“Well spoken!”

A series of resounding claps reverberated loudly in the air. It was coming from no other than the Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster.

“Yu Heavenly Clan, I get how you feel. Three days to master a rank five Exalted Taboo is indeed illogical. However, based on what I know, rank five Exalted Taboos can only be cultivated by rank six Utmost Exalted level cultivators, and something with the prowess of Soul of Heavenly Lightning requires a minimum cultivation level of rank seven Utmost Exalted level.

“Going by that logic, given that young friend Chu Feng’s real cultivation is still at rank five Utmost Exalted level, he shouldn’t have been able to grasp ordinary rank five Exalted Taboos, let alone Soul of Heavenly Lightning.

“However, there’s no doubt that he has indeed managed to do it. The power he’s emanating at this moment is unquestionable Soul of Heavenly Lightning. Even I find it hard to believe too. Nevertheless, it’s a fact that it has happened. A prodigious cultivator has descended amongst us, and he has managed to achieve the unthinkable.

“And he’s no other than young friend Chu Feng!”

The Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster was filled with compliments for Chu Feng.

After saying those bunch of words, he turned to Yu Lie and said, “Yu Lie, this Exalted recognizes your talent, but everything is relative. As talented as you are, it’s clear that you have been outmatched by young friend Chu Feng. I advise you to surrender and end the fight here.”

Those words from the Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster caused the faces of many from the Yu Heavenly Clan to turn ugly.

How could someone of his standing say such words?

Unable to take it any longer, many of them began to criticize the Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster.

In contrast, Yu Lie didn’t show the slightest anger on his face.

“Elder, I appreciate your goodwill, but I have already bet my life on this battle. There’s no backing down for me here.”

After saying those words to the Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster, Yu Lie turned his gaze back to Chu Feng.

“Brother Chu Feng, allow me to have a taste of the prowess of your Soul of Heavenly Lightning!”

Tzlala! ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Right after saying those words, Yu Lie pointed his sword toward Chu Feng, and the blue lightning began gushing forth as if an army charging on command.

The blue lightning carried such frightening might that it felt almost as if the apocalypse had fallen upon the world.

Seeing this, Chu Feng quickly retaliated.

With the same actions as Yu Lie, he raised his sword, pointed it at Yu Lie, and released a powerful surge of blue lightning.

Boom!

Tzlala!

A deafening explosion shook the air, and lightning ravaged the surroundings.

The lightning of the duo had interwoven together with one another, as if two armies clashing against one another.

Every single person on the spot watched the sight with bated breaths.

They wanted to know which of the two Soul of Heavenly Lightning was stronger.

Needless to say, those from the Yu Heavenly were rooting for Yu Lie, but upon taking a closer look, their hearts sunk.

The two interwoven lightning fell into a stalemate. Neither Chu Feng nor Yu Lie’s blue lightning was able to overcome the prowess of the other.

Shoosh!

But at this very moment, Yu Lie suddenly formed a series of peculiar hand seals.

Right after that, his blue lightning began to morph. It began to fuse together with Chu Feng’s blue lightning, and vaguely, an avatar could be seen floating above the interwoven lightning.

“Profoundness of Heavenly Lightning, Lightning Soul!!!”

Soon after, a human silhouette made of lightning came into shape amidst the interwoven lightning.

“That’s the profoundness of Soul of Heavenly Lightning. Yu Lie managed to grasp the profoundness!!!”

Those from the older generation of the Yu Heavenly Clan were still relatively calmer since they knew that Yu Lie had already managed to grasp the profoundness of the technique.

However, the others such as the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief and the Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster were having trouble keeping their cool.

The lightning soul that had appeared in the midst of the interwoven lightning had begun to expand at a furious pace. It was only two meters large at the very start, but in a matter of moments, it had already grown into a giant of over ten thousand meters tall.

It was humongous to the point where even the clouds only reached up to its waist.

As soon as the lightning giant came to form, it unhesitatingly raised its fist and smashed it down on Chu Feng.
