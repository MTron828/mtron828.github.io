Chapter 4064 - Flower Sea King

“Woosh~~~”

Finally, Chu Feng opened his tightly closed eyes and stood up.

His palms were still clasped together. It was as if there was something within them.

After standing up, Chu Feng took a glance at the Xuanming Family army located above.

His gaze was extremely sharp. It pierced through the sky like two sharp blades.

However, Chu Feng merely took a single glance. Then, without saying anything, he retrieved his gaze.

Although Chu Feng didn’t say anything, his gaze had displeased Xuan Yihang.

“That brat seemed to have been glaring at me earlier.”

“That motherfucker’s courting death,” he said with displeasure.

“Young master, there’s no need for you to personally take care of ants like them,” said the old man beside him.

“Humph, what you say is true. However, I cannot allow that brat to act like that. If he dares to glare at me again, have his eyes scooped out,” said Xuan Yihang.

“Did you all hear what the young master said?” that old man shouted.

“Yes, Milord!”

Thunderous voices sounded from behind.

They did not attempt to prevent anyone from hearing their conversation at all.

As such, everyone present, including Chu Feng, heard everything clearly.

However, Chu Feng did not bother to pay any attention to them. Instead, he began to move his clasped hands.

Without separating his clasped hands, Chu Feng made special hand seals.

His actions caught the attention of everyone present. Naturally, he also caught the attention of the Xuanming Family.

“What is that brat doing acting all mystifying?” asked Xuan Yihang.

“Milord, that man is Chu Feng. He was the one that declared there to be Purple Star Wisterias here.”

“Originally, even the Chu Heavenly Clansmen didn’t believe there to be Purple Star Wisterias here. However, that Chu Feng insisted that there are Purple Stars Wisterias here.”

“Furthermore, before you came, he was sitting on the ground. It was as if he could make them reveal themselves.”

“Most laughable of all, those Chu Heavenly Clansmen actually took his words to be true, and all began to wait in anticipation,” said the Xuanming Family’s lackeys.

“Oh? So he’s that Chu Feng?”

Upon learning Chu Feng’s identity, Xuan Yihang and the old men who stood beside him both began to carefully examine him.

“The hand seals he’s making are indeed a world spiritist’s technique.”

“However, they are merely a very crude set of hand seals.”

“What young master said is correct, he is indeed acting all mystifying.”

“The way I see it, this Chu Feng is someone with unwarranted fame,” Grandmaster Immortal Eyes stepped forward and voiced his opinion.

“It’s no wonder the Chu Heavenly Clan is this weak,” Xuan Yihang said with a sigh.

“No matter what, they’re still a clan. How could they allow themselves to follow a person of the younger generation? How could a power like this possibly become powerful?”

“Forget it, this young master doesn’t wish to continue watching this bunch of lowly clowns. Have them continue with their daydreaming; we’ll go and continue our search for the Purple Star Wisterias,” as he spoke, he began walking toward his palace.

The Xuanming Family’s army also intended to continue on with their journey.

“Buzz~~~”

However, before Xuan Yihang could even enter his palace, movement suddenly emerged from beneath the location where the Chu Heavenly Clansmen stood.

Dazzling light exploded from beneath them.

The light was even more dazzling than the bright sun. Even the Xuanming Family’s army that stood ten thousand meters in the sky found themselves covered by the radiance.

Because of this, their attention was immediately captured.

Everyone turned toward the direction of the light.

Upon doing so, everyone from the Xuanming Family was astonished.

They discovered that the dazzling light had been released from within Chu Feng’s clasped palms.

When Chu Feng opened his palms completely, they were able to see that there was an item in Chu Feng’s hand. It was a spheroid that was wriggling nonstop. It seemed as if it were alive.

If one were to look closely, one would be able tell that the spheroid contained an extremely boundless amount of spirit power.

“How could this be?!”

“That... could that be a treasure?!”

Seeing the item in Chu Feng’s hand, Grandmaster Immortal Eyes revealed a complicated expression.

As a Snake Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist, he was able to tell how powerful of a spirit formation the item in Chu Feng’s hand was.

“Whoosh~~~”

Suddenly, Chu Feng waved his sleeve, and the item in his hand shattered. The shattered spheroid turned into energy that spread outward.

The energy first soared into the sky, and then, like a torrential rain, began to fall gently.

As those bodies of light sprinkled down onto the ground, the earth beneath began to change.

Purple plants then appeared on the boundless field.

Those plants were extremely beautiful, and emitted an immortal air.

Once those plants appeared, the natural energies of the region instantly became abundant.

Those plants were none other than the Purple Star Wisterias.

Based on the size of Purple Star Wisterias, they were seperated into primary stage, middle stage and mature stage.

Primary stage Purple Star Wisterias were only an inch tall. As for middle stage Purple Star Wisterias, they could reach half a meter in height.

However, the Purple Star Wisterias that had appeared were all over a meter tall.

Those were all mature Purple Star Wisterias.

Furthermore, there were over ten thousand such Purple Star Wisterias.

This was truly a sea of Purple Star Wisterias.

A sea of Purple Star Wisterias as spectacular as this was extremely rare in the Purple Star Upper Realm.

The majority of them would be composed of flowers in either the primary stage or middle stage.

Furthermore, their number would not surpass a thousand.

Yet, there were tens of thousands of mature Purple Star Wisterias there.

This was simply the legendary Flower Sea King!

“Flower Sea King! It’s actually the legendary Flower Sea King! This is something that has never been discovered by even the Purple Star Hall!”

“Heavens! This is simply incredible! The legendary Flower Sea King actually appeared here!”

“If one were to refine all the Purple Star Wisterias here, the amount of cultivation resources they would obtain is simply unimaginable!”

“Was it that young man? Was he the one who discovered this Flower Sea King?”

“What eyesight! It’s simply too amazing!” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

The people below began praising Chu Feng nonstop.

However, the more resounding those praises became, the uglier Grandmaster Immortal Eyes’ expression became.

“Didn’t you say that this place was tiny and barren, that there couldn’t possibly be Purple Star Wisterias here?”

“Why would the legendary Flower Sea King appear here?”

Xuan Yihang glared at Grandmaster Immortal Eyes.

His attitude had transformed completely.

He no longer had his earlier respectful attitude. Anger was all that remained.

“This shouldn’t be, how could this old man be mistaken?”

“I got it! It must be that treasure he held in his hand!”

“The light that revealed the Purple Star Wisterias is a treasure!”

“That Chu Feng relied on that treasure to find these Purple Star Wisterias!” explained Grandmaster Immortal Eyes.

“Do you have such a treasure then?” asked Xuan Yihang.

“This old man... does... does not.” Grandmaster Immortal Eyes shook his head.

“Useless trash, why did I hire you?”

“Don’t think about receiving the remainder of the payment! Furthermore, you’ll have to return the payment I made before! Else, I’ll take your old life!” Xuan Yihang shouted angrily.

“I...” Grandmaster Immortal Eyes was enraged, but did not dare to express his anger. In the end, he silently nodded.

Xuan Yihang had been thoroughly angered.

He had racked his brains and searched so long for Purple Star Wisterias to no avail.

Yet, the Chu Heavenly Clan, people he considered to be trash, had actually discovered them first. Furthermore, the Purple Star Wisterias they’d discovered were the legendary Flower Sea King! This made him extremely displeased.

As he looked at the gorgeous, dazzling and immortal-air-emitting sea of flowers, he became more and more furious. He was so furious that even his breathing became hurried.

However, all of a sudden, his gaze changed. He seemed to have thought of something.

Then, not only did a look of joy flash through his eyes, but the corners of his mouth also rose into an avaricious smile.
