Chapter 3236 - Bolt From The Blue

Inside the Holy Spirit Formation of Light. From the Linghu Heavenly Clan, only Linghu Lun remained.

As for the other Linghu Heavenly Clansmen, they had all their Symbols of Light stripped away by Chu Feng, and were banished from the Holy Spirit Formation of Light.

However, there were still several figures inside the sea of flames emitted by Chu Feng’s Fire Qilin Armor.

Those were the people from the Nightmare Spirit Clan and the Heaven-reaching Beast Clan. Among them were Mengyan Wushuang and Tongtian Yuanming, the seventh and eighth ranked of the Ancestral Martial Decastars.

However, even two geniuses like them were completely suppressed by the flames and unable to resist at all.

“Chu... Chu Feng, what are you planning to do?!”

Suddenly, both Mengyan Wushuang and Tongtian Yuanming let out snarls of unease.

The reason for that was because Chu Feng had actually taken out several Ores of Light from his Cosmos Sack.

Normally, the Ores of Light would assimilate into the body of the person closest to them after being extracted. Even something like a Cosmos Sack would not be able to bind them. However, those Ores of Light were surrounded by a spirit formation.

Although they had no idea how Chu Feng had managed to accomplish it, those Ores of Light were indeed surrounded by a spirit formation.

That said, if they had only seen the Ores of Light being surrounded by a spirit formation, they would not be reacting with such unease.

The reason why they were so uneasy was because Chu Feng removed the seals on those Ores of Light.

After the seals were removed, the Ores of Light started assimilating into their bodies and condensing a Symbol of Light on their foreheads.

“How could you all not know what I’m planning to do? It’s not a good habit to ask what you already know,” Chu Feng spoke with a beaming smile.

“Chu Feng, you are shameless, absolutely shameless!!!”

“Do you know who we are?! If you dare to mess around with us, our clans will definitely not spare you!” Mengyan Wushuang and the others shouted angrily.

They had actually already deduced what Chu Feng was planning to do. They knew that Chu Feng planned to condense Symbols of Light on their foreheads, and then strip those Symbols of Light from them.

For Chu Feng to seal away those Ores of Light and then bring them there, he had evidently done so in preparation to take care of them.

Chu Feng... had actually come prepared.

This made them deeply realize how frightening of a person Chu Feng was.

“No matter how strong your clans might be, could they be stronger than the Linghu Heavenly Clan? I, Chu Feng, dared to take care of even the Linghu Heavenly Clan. As such, how could I fear the clans behind you all?” Chu Feng said.

Mengyan Wushuang and Tongtian Yuanming were left speechless by Chu Feng’s words.

At that moment, Chu Feng placed his hand on Mengyan Wushuang’s Symbol of Light.

“Eeeahhh~~~”

In the next moment, a miserable scream began to resonate from Mengyan Wushuang’s mouth.

Meanwhile, the people in the plaza were all astonished by Chu Feng’s conduct.

Not even Dongguo Bingyu had anticipated that Chu Feng would really dare to strip the Symbols of Light from the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen.

Chu Feng’s action was simply making an enemy out of the Linghu Heavenly Clan.

As such, after everything happened, many people felt admiration and shock toward Chu Feng’s boldness.

This was especially true for the newcomers that had had their Symbols of Light plundered by the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen. They felt particularly shocked, and at the same time felt great admiration toward Chu Feng. They knew that none of them possessed the boldness and courage that he did.

“That Chu Feng is truly despicable. He is actually so shameless as to sneak attack the Linghu Heavenly Clan’s newcomers.”

“However, among those that entered the Holy Spirit Formation of Light are also people that Chu Feng does not dare to provoke,” suddenly, a cunning Nightmare Spirit Clansman began to speak.

He said those words with the intention of retrieving face for the Linghu Heavenly Clan.

That was the reason why he deliberately said that Chu Feng had sneak attacked the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen.

“Indeed, he’s truly despicable. However, these clansmen are not all of our clan’s clansmen that have entered the Holy Spirit Formation of Light this time around. Linghu Lun will make him pay for his actions,” a Linghu Heavenly Clansman said.

Upon hearing those words, the expressions of the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen who had had their Symbols of Light taken by Chu Feng turned complicated. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

The reason for that was because they all knew that Linghu Lun was also present at the time. Merely, he was unable to do anything to Chu Feng.

However, they now had no idea what to say. After all, if they were to reveal that matter, their Linghu Heavenly Clan would suffer a massive humiliation.

At that moment, a Nightmare Spirit Clansman spoke proudly. “There’s no need for Linghu Lun to take care of Chu Feng. Our clan’s Wushuang will be sufficient to teach that Chu Feng a lesson.”

He was filled with confidence when he said those words.

“If our clan’s Yuanming is to capture that Chu Feng, he will definitely not let him get away easily either,” someone from the Heaven-reaching Beast Clan added.

The people from the Dongguo Heavenly Clan all firmly believed in their words, so much so that they all revealed worried expressions.

They felt that both Mengyan Wushuang and Tongtian Yuanming were existences that Chu Feng could not contend against. Even if Chu Feng were capable of fighting them, they would definitely be very difficult opponents.

After all, the two of them were both ranked geniuses of the Ancestral Martial Decastars.

“Buzz~~~”

However, right at that moment, a figure appeared amongst the newcomers.

The people present were all astonished to see that person. The reason for that was because that person was someone from the Nightmare Spirit Clan.

The ones that were feeling the most astonished at that moment would naturally be the Nightmare Spirit Clansmen.

Whilst the others might not be able to tell who that Nightmare Spirit Clansman was, they were able to tell with a single glance.

That Nightmare Spirit Clansman that had appeared amongst the newcomers was no mere Nightmare Spirit Clansman. Instead, he was the genius that they were intensely proud of, Mengyan Wushuang.

“Wushuang, what happened?! Exactly what is going on?! Who injured you?!”

Many people from the Nightmare Spirit Clan immediately flew over to Mengyan Wushuang and began to carefully heal his injuries whilst asking him about what had happened in a nervous manner.

Hearing the shouts from the Nightmare Spirit Clansmen, the crowd finally realized that the person that was expelled from the Holy Spirit Formation of Light was actually Mengyan Wushuang.

At that moment, astonishment filled the crowd’s faces once more.

“Putt~~~”

Following that, a giant colossus appeared. It was actually Tongtian Yuanming.

The crowd were even more astonished. It was not only Mengyan Wushuang that was expelled from the Holy Spirit Formation of Light, but Tongtian Yuanming was actually also expelled.

Could it be that... this was also done by Chu Feng?

After the condition of Mengyan Wushuang and Tongtian Yuanming’s injuries turned for the better, they managed to speak out Chu Feng’s name.

“Chu Feng, it’s Chu Feng again?!”

The Nightmare Spirit Clansmen and the Heaven-reaching Beast Clansmen also began to shout furiously.

After verifying that Mengyan Wushuang and Tongtian Yuanming also had their Symbols of Light plundered by Chu Feng, someone from the Linghu Heavenly Clan said, “It would appear that only our clan’s Linghu Lun will be able to take care of Chu Feng.”

The Linghu Heavenly Clansmen were not only not displeased by what had happened to Mengyan Wushuang and Tongtian Yuanming, but the anger in their hearts had also been alleviated slightly.

After all, with both Mengyan Wushuang and Tongtian Yuanming falling by Chu Feng’s hands, it served to prove that Chu Feng’s strength was not to be looked down upon.

As such, it was not as humiliating for their Linghu Heavenly Clan’s newcomers to have their Symbols of Light plundered by Chu Feng.

Furthermore, if Linghu Lun were to take care of Chu Feng now, it would serve to greater manifest Linghu Lun’s strength.

To the people of the Linghu Heavenly Clan, this was not a bad thing at all. Instead, it was a good thing.

At that moment, Mengyan Wushuang spoke with a weak voice, “Could it be, none of them have said anything?”

“Mengyan Wushuang, what are you talking about?!” Linghu Tiemian asked with a frown.

Linghu Tiemian sensed a trace of mockery in Mengyan Wushuang’s tone.

“Linghu Lun was also present when we had our Symbols of Light plundered by Chu Feng,” Mengyan Wushuang said.

“What?!” Hearing those words, the expressions of the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen, and everyone else present, changed.

“Mengyan Wushuang, you said that Linghu Lun was also present?” Many people from the Linghu Heavenly Clan asked simultaneously.

“Linghu Lun was present from the very start. Merely, he was powerless to do anything when Chu Feng plundered our Symbols of Light. He could only look on from the side and stare blankly as we had our Symbols of Light stripped away by Chu Feng,” Mengyan Wushuang said.

“Boom~~~”

It was a bolt from the blue!!!

Mengyan Wushuang’s words were truly a bolt from the blue.

At that moment, the expressions of everyone from the Linghu Heavenly Clan turned dull. The same sort of expression was present in their eyes.

They were at a complete loss as to what to do.
