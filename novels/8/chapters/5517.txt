Chapter 5517: The Prowess of Divine Flitting

“It’s indeed weird, but his aura is that of a rank two Half-God level cultivator. Did he do it intentionally to confuse me?” Feng Jiuyue frowned, unable to make sense of the situation.

The two of them were using movement skills that allowed them to move at tremendous speeds within a short period, but they would naturally slow down as time passed. However, that wasn’t the case for Chu Feng at all. He continued to maintain an extremely high speed, which meant that the distance between them would only continue to grow.

Realizing the situation, a decisive glint flashed across Feng Jiuyue’s eyes. With a flick of her wrist, she took out a red pill and popped it into her mouth.

A red aura enveloped her body as her spirit power surged. This translated to a speed boost, allowing her to gradually catch up with Chu Feng. At the same time, she secretly constructed a capture formation to snag Chu Feng as soon as she closed the distance.

“Don’t waste your strength. You can’t catch me with that formation of yours!” Chu Feng suddenly glanced back at Feng Jiuyue with provocative eyes.

Feng Jiuyue widened her eyes. She hadn’t expected Chu Feng to notice the formation she was secretly constructing. This made her even more determined to capture Chu Feng, and she knew that this was the best opportunity for her to do so.

Tzlala!

Lightning suddenly crackled around Chu Feng, as Lightning Armor manifested on him. He was finally revealing his cultivation—rank three Half-God level.

This proved that Feng Jiuyue was right to say that he was a rank two Half-God level cultivator. Yet, despite having only raised his cultivation by a single rank, his speed suddenly increased by leaps and bounds, going far beyond what Feng Jiuyue could keep up with.

Within the blink of an eye, he had already disappeared from their field of vision.

Feng Jiuyue realized that she had lost her opportunity. There was no way she could capture Chu Feng anymore. As indignant as she felt, she could only give up on it.

She first channeled her cultivation skill to suppress the remaining medicinal energy surging in her body before popping another pill into her mouth. The red pill she had consumed earlier was a forbidden medicine to boost her spirit power, but it came with a backlash.

Since it was no longer possible for her to capture Chu Feng, she decided to minimize the backlash.

Soon, Feng Tiansheng caught up with her.

“Is he really a rank two Half-God level cultivator? How is he that fast?”

While he struggled to catch up with Chu Feng and Feng Jiuyue, he still saw what happened earlier and thus knew that the latter was indeed a rank two Half-God level cultivator.

“He might have some kind of treasure on him,” Feng Jiuyue remarked as she looked in the direction Chu Feng disappeared.

“That must have been the case, but I can’t wrap my head around what kind of treasure could allow a rank two Half-God level cultivator to outspeed us. The moment he raised his cultivation by a rank, he vanished in a flash. He sure has a lot of secrets. Big sister, we should have just curbed him straight away instead of wasting our breath on him! We can just get rid of him once this matter is done. He only has the backing of the Totem Dragon Clan anyway, and it’s not as if we’re afraid of them,” Feng Tiansheng said.RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“What foolish words! Do you think that someone who is that talented and has such treasures would have no backing?” Feng Jiuyue asked.

“He… has backing? Who? There are only so few powerhouses in the vast world of cultivation, and he doesn’t belong to any of them. Who would stand up for him?” Feng Tiansheng asked.

“There is no lack of hidden experts in the world of cultivation. Even the major powerhouses wouldn’t dare to recklessly offend those hidden experts. Chu Feng might just be the disciple of one of these hidden experts,” Feng Jiuyue said.

“Big sister, how can there be that many hidden experts in the world? You’re thinking too much!” Feng Tiansheng refuted.

“You’re getting blinded by your arrogance. It’s one thing if you’re unaware of it, but it should be clear as day now that Chu Feng is anything but normal. How can you continue underestimating him?” Feng Jiuyue asked.

“I know that Chu Feng is an exceptional individual, and I am impressed by his means too. However, we need to consider our clan’s interests. You should also know how important this mission is to us. We have to accomplish it by hook or by crook!” Feng Tiansheng said.

“I know that, or else I wouldn’t have made a move on Chu Feng either,” Feng Jiuyue said.

“You’re still too soft. Leave it to me,” Feng Tiansheng said.

Instead of responding to those words, Feng Jiuyue glanced at the two formations crackling with red lightning behind her, followed by the other completed formations. It couldn’t be clearer to her that the red lightning formations were still the strongest.

In the end, she nodded as if to express her approval.

…

Chu Feng finally came to a halt.

It was only with the Divine Deer’s Divine Flitting that he was able to throw off Feng Jiuyue and Feng Tiansheng. That allowed him to travel at a speed comparable to a rank six Half-God level cultivator despite only being at rank two Half-God level himself, and the speed would increase correspondingly if he raised his cultivation.

He had chosen not to raise his cultivation right away as he wanted to see how his speed compared to experts of Feng Jiuyue and Feng Tiansheng’s caliber. He was delighted with the result, as his speed was superior to theirs under normal circumstances.

If not for Feng Jiuyue consuming a forbidden medicine, he would have been able to shake them off without raising his cultivation.

“Young hero Chu Feng, what’s your current cultivation level?” Long Zhizhi asked out of curiosity.

Long Yuhong also looked at Chu Feng with curious eyes too.

They could sense that Chu Feng was a rank two Half-God level cultivator. While he raised his cultivation by a rank through his Lightning Armor, it still didn’t make sense for him to be able to travel that fast.

“I’m a rank two Half-God level cultivator,” Chu Feng replied.

“Rank two Half-God level? Young hero Chu Feng, how are you able to travel that fast then?” Long Zhizhi asked.

“I have a treasure that allows me to travel faster than usual. It’s a protective treasure my master gave me,” Chu Feng lied.

He didn’t think that he needed to explain why he was able to travel fast to them, and the easiest way to justify it was by attributing it to a treasure.

“A treasure? That’s quite a formidable treasure.”

Even so, Long Zhizhi and the others were still impressed. They knew that there was no treasure equivalent to that in their Totem Dragon Clan even though they were the overlords of a galaxy.

Seeing their responses, Chu Feng was relieved that he had told them that it was a treasure. They would have been even more envious if he told them that it was a martial skill.

“Let’s hurry on our way,” Chu Feng said.

He knew that the priority at hand was to help the Totem Dragon Clan claim more formations.

Boom!

Just as Chu Feng was about to move, the entire realm suddenly shook. Over half of the light pillars connecting the earth to the sky suddenly extinguished. To be exact, all of the formations except for those that had been completed had vanished from sight!
