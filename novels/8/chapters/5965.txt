Chapter 5966: Does She Deserve Death?

Chapter 5966: Does She Deserve Death?

“You have this formation under your control? How did you do it?!” Ling Mouzi’s voice was quivering with rage. He was angry at himself.

He was no fool. The truth was evident.

Chu Feng had been using them to decipher the formations on his behalf. At the same time, he was using this as an impetus to get rid of them in a single swoop.

Of course, Chu Feng alone wouldn’t be a match for them, so he did what he did when he wreaked havoc at the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion—borrowing the strength of a formation.

The only thing that baffled Ling Mouzi was that he had never heard of any formations in this remnant that could be utilized by the challenger, even if the challenger had paved a new path in the chess door.

Jie Tianran, Jie Ranqing, and a few other Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s ancestors had paved new paths in this place, but there were no records of them utilizing the power of the formations here.

Furthermore, Ling Mouzi had been secretly eyeing Chu Feng from the shadows lest he pulled anything.

Yet, Chu Feng still pulled off his plan.

The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion could still blame their previous failure to deal with Chu Feng on their lack of understanding of him, resulting in them getting careless, but what about this time?

Were they to admit that they were inferior to Chu Feng?

But Ling Mouzi was a Saint-tier elder of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, close to reaching pinnacle True Dragon World Spiritist! How could he admit that he was inferior to a junior?

“How did I do it? I just did it the way that I did.

“You must be unable to figure out how I grasped control of this formation. I bet you couldn’t even tell that the energy in this formation can be utilized. No wonder you didn’t notice that I was trying to grasp control of this formation in the past three days while deciphering the other formations.

“Do you see why I call you trash now, Saint-tier elder?” Chu Feng sneered.

He then turned to Jie Tian and scoffed, “Top prodigy? I only see another piece of trash. I knew that you had another hand prepared, and it’s true that there’s a limit to my death immunity death token too. My only way of turning the tables on you is to utilize the formations here, and this is my only chance to do so.

“I was worried that you wouldn’t fall for my trap, so I told Tongling Yueyue about the deciphering sequence and claimed that I would be able to clear this remnant once I passed through this door. I didn’t think you would be so impatient as to reveal yourself.

“Should I be thankful that you people are so dumb?”

Chu Feng looked at the experts from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion and the Spirituality Sacred Clan in ridicule. Yet, they could only lower their heads in shame.

They were outwitted by Chu Feng despite their spirit power being much higher. This was a grievous humiliation to them.

While everyone was quiet, Jie Tian suddenly spoke up, “Chu Feng, you must think that victory is in your grasp?”

Chu Feng turned to Jie Tian. “I didn’t say that, but it’s clear that I have won this round. Jie Tian, do you feel indignant? Many of you must feel the same way. But what can you do? Why don’t you stand up and reason it out with me instead of kneeling there?”

Jie Tian’s face darkened. He would have stood up if he could. They were only kneeling because the formation was pushing down on them.

“What’s wrong? Can’t stand? I’ll be honest—this is my only way to curb you people. If you didn’t fall for this trap, I’d have no choice but to slip away. I can protect myself through my death immunity token, but I wouldn’t be able to do anything about you people.

“Yet, you fell for my trap, and that’s why I won this round. Jie Tian, you might feel indignant, but you have no choice but to admit defeat,” Chu Feng sneered.

“Kill me, Chu Feng. Why don’t you try that?” Jie Tian sneered.

“No, I won’t kill you. I need you alive. I have use for you,” Chu Feng replied.

“Capture me alive then. Let’s see if you have the means to do so?” Jie Tian scoffed.

“What? Do you still have a way to escape from this situation?’” Chu Feng’s smile stiffened up.

“Afraid? Kneel and apologize to me right now, and I might leave you with an intact corpse,” Jie Tian said.

“You must want to suffer. I’ll satisfy you.” Chu Feng channeled the formation’s energy into binding energy to hold Jie Tian and the others in place.

“Heh...” Jie Tian sneered.

A powerful surge of teleportation energy rushed out and enveloped Jie Tian, Ling Mouzi, and those from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. They vanished in an instant.

“Hah... Did you think I wouldn’t know you have an escape means? You’re underestimating me if you think that this is all I amount to. I won’t let you escape next time.”

As soon as Jie Tian and the others vanished, Chu Feng’s fluster vanished. In its place was a gleeful smirk.

He then turned his attention toward Tongling Yueyue and the others.

Those from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion were likely linked to a powerful formation that allowed them to flee in times of danger, but Tongling Yueyue and the others from the Spirituality Sacred Clan couldn’t do the same.

“Young hero Chu Feng, I have my difficulties too. Please spare me! The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion held our Spirituality Sacred Clan hostage, so I had no choice but to...”

“Shut up,” Chu Feng coldly uttered. “It’s too late to be begging for mercy. I warned you that you might face danger if you come with me, and I advised you to think thrice before choosing. I gave you a chance, but you failed to understand my words. Did you think I was worried about you?”

“That... was a warning? You knew from the start that I was a spy from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion?” Tongling Yueyue stared at Chu Feng in disbelief.

“It was just a doubt at first, but I became certain when the people pursuing you didn’t rat on me. Why wouldn’t they rat on me? The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion would have rewarded them for their information. There was only one explanation—you were in cahoots, and the pursuit was just a show intended for me.”

Tongling Yueyue’s face paled in despair.

Chu Feng clenched his fist, and a formation sword manifested in his hands. He slowly walked up to Tongling Yueyue.

“I’ll give you one last chance, Tongling Yueyue. Why don’t you guess whether I’ll spare you?” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“I-I-I know that I have done wrong, but I was indeed coerced into this. I...”

“Coerced into this?” Chu Feng sneered.

He brandished his sword and released a burst of sword ki. Fresh blood splattered along with wails of agony.

Tongling Yueyue had been decapitated, but on top of that, Chu Feng had also severed all of the Spirituality Sacred Clansmen’s whiskers, causing their faces to warp in pain.

“She was still sending updates to the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion while weaving excuses and begging me for mercy. Don’t you think a person like that deserves to die?” Chu Feng looked at the other Spirituality Sacred Clansmen with a blood-soaked sword in hand.
