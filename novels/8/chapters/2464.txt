Chapter 2464 - Subduing The Secret Skill

The Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief’s Ancestral Armament axe fell from the sky. However, his body had long since disappeared. It had shattered into pieces in the sky, turning into a rain of blood.

The Monstrous Clan’s Clansmen all had ashen looks of despair on their faces. They never expected that their Lord Clan Chief would be obliterated by someone like this.

But, when even their Lord Clan Chief was completely helpless before Chu Feng, what could they possibly do?

Today would likely be their doomsday.

“Roar~~~”

However, right at that moment, an ear-piercing snarl suddenly sounded from within the rain of blood.

The next moment, a dark black gaseous substance appeared. Furthermore, the gaseous substance began to grow larger and larger.

The dark black gaseous substance seemed to have intelligence. It seemed to be a person, yet not a person, seemed to be a blade ray, yet not a blade ray. Yet, it was emitting a sinister and strange roar, and a majestic and powerful aura.

“Secret Skill: Enemy Restraining Slash!!!”

The Ancient Era’s Monstrous Clansmen’s expressions all changed. They naturally recognized the secret skill.

After all, this secret skill was their Ancient Era’s Monstrous Clan’s secret skill.

“Secret skill? Never would I have expected that this guy actually possessed such a secret skill.”

“Interesting. Seems like killing him today was the right decision.”

Upon seeing the secret skill, Chu Feng actually revealed a joyous expression. Then, he opened his palm, and his boundless attractive force was revealed once again. This time around, it enveloped the secret skill.

“What is that guy planning to do? Could it be... he wants to seize the secret skill?” Seeing what was happening, the Ancient Era’s Monstrous Clansmen all revealed astonished expressions.

“Ignorant brat, you actually dare to think about obtaining me? You are simply courting death,” However, not only did Chu Feng’s attractive force not move the secret skill, it instead caused the secret skill to let out an incomparably furious snarl.

The next moment, layer upon layer of boundless power began to move toward Chu Feng to oppress him.

Everything happened too quickly. Chu Feng was caught off guard. “Boom!” Chu Feng was actually knocked several tens of thousands of meters away.

It was only when Chu Feng was knocked into a building that he stopped. However, that ferocious energy ripple had already covered Chu Feng.

“Young Hero Chu Feng!!!”

Witnessing that scene, the Ancient Era’s War Clansmen were all shocked. Deeply alarmed expressions emerged on their faces.

After all, the aura emitted by that secret skill was no small matter. Furthermore, Chu Feng was clearly knocked away by it and was currently covered by the energy ripple. It was unknown as to whether or not Chu Feng was alive. Thus, how could they not be worried for Chu Feng?

“This is great! Lord Secret Skill is actually this powerful. We’re saved! Our Ancient Era’s Monstrous Clan is saved!!!”

“That Chu Feng is truly foolish. He actually provoked Lord Secret Skill. Seems like he will undoubtedly die today.”

At that moment when the Ancient Era’s War Clansmen were worried, the Ancient Era’s Monstrous Clansmen all revealed joyous expressions on their faces.

Originally, they had thought that their Monstrous Clan would definitely be extinguished after facing such a powerful enemy.

However, after witnessing how powerful the secret skill was, they suddenly realized that they could still be saved. In fact, it could even be said that they still had hopes of being able to eliminate the Ancient Era’s War Clan.

They might still be able to obtain victory in their battle.

After all, that secret skill was created by their Lord Yao Xing. Thus, the secret skill itself should be extremely powerful.

Back then, even their Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief had not managed to conquer the secret skill with his own power. Rather, he had only managed to inherit it.

Thus, they actually had no idea exactly how powerful the secret skill was.

However, judging by how things were going at the moment, that secret skill was truly powerful. Even Chu Feng was not a match for it. As such, they would naturally be overjoyed. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Die!!!”

Suddenly, a sinister voice was heard. Following that, overwhelming killing intent surged forth.

The secret skill began to pursue Chu Feng to where he had fallen. As it flew toward Chu Feng, its overflowing black flames covered the entire sky.

“Zzzzzz~~~”

Right at that moment, dazzling lightning suddenly emerged in the region covered by the energy ripples.

“Woosh~~~”

The next moment, an enormous hand suddenly broke through the energy ripples. Like a water dragon emerging from the sea, it flew out and grabbed the secret skill.

“Heavens! That is?!!!”

At that moment, the bystanders’ eyes turned sluggish. They were confused as to what was happening.

After all, that hand was so very enormous. No matter how one looked at it, that hand did not resemble a human’s hand.

Soon, the energy ripples started to gradually vanish. At that moment, the crowd finally managed to see the owner of that enormous hand.

That enormous hand was formed with martial power, martial power that originated from Chu Feng. It turned out that enormous hand was a technique from Chu Feng.

Merely, compared to before, Chu Feng was completely different.

At that moment, not only was lightning flashing in Chu Feng’s eyes, but his body was also covered with a suit of armor made of lightning and a pair of lightning wings also extended out from his back.

Most importantly, Chu Feng’s current cultivation was no longer that of a rank seven Martial Ancestor. Rather, he had become a rank nine Martial Ancestor.

With how overwhelmingly powerful Chu Feng had become, even the secret skill was only able to struggle without being able to break free from Chu Feng’s enormous hand made of martial power.

“You have two choices. Either work for me or die,” Chu Feng said to the secret skill.

“Never had I expected you to be this powerful at such a young age. Compared to that trash from the Monstrous Clan, you are countless times more powerful.”

“I am not someone who is unable to differentiate good from bad. My existence is so that I can be used by others.”

“As the saying goes, a fine bird chooses a tree to nest in. Boy, you have ability. Thus, I will recognize you as my master,” That secret skill actually did not hesitate in the slightest, and directly gave Chu Feng an answer. It was planning to follow Chu Feng.

“You’d best not lie to me,” Chu Feng released the secret skill. However, his gaze was still fixed onto the secret skill. He was still on alert.

“I am always one to keep my word. Since I have said that I will follow you, I will definitely be loyal and devoted to you.”

After the secret skill finished saying those words, it turned from a vast black gaseous flame to a little wisp of flame. Then, it entered Chu Feng’s forehead.

That Monstrous Clan’s secret skill actually really ended up surrendering to and pledging allegiance to Chu Feng.

“It’s actually a secret skill meant to attack other secret skills. This has truly surpassed my expectations.”

At that moment, Chu Feng became aware of the abilities of that secret skill.

Originally, Chu Feng was not looking forward to that secret skill too much after having already grasped the powerful secret skill that was the Ancient Era’s War Sword.

He had merely... intended to subdue it for the heck of it. After all, secret skills were extremely rare. Furthermore, that secret skill was the Ancient Era’s Monstrous Clan’s secret skill.

However, upon discovering the special capabilities of the secret skill, Chu Feng was unable to contain his feelings of joy. He had discovered that he had managed to pick up a treasure.

That secret skill was called the Enemy Restraining Slash. When unleashed, it would appear only like an ordinary slash without any particularities. In fact, one could not even determine that it was a secret skill through its aura.

However, if one were to be struck by it, one would not be able to use secret skills again. If one were to try to use one’s secret skill again, they would receive a backlash.

Furthermore, to be exact, that secret skill was not created by that Ancient Era’s Monstrous Clan’s Yao Xing.

Rather, it was created by someone else. To put it simply, that secret skill, the Enemy Restraining Slash, possessed an extraordinary origin. It had been polished by the Ancient Era’s Monstrous Clan’s various experts for many years, but still remained incomplete.

When that secret skill landed in Yao Xing’s hands, it had nearly reached a state of completion. Using the methods left behind by his seniors, Yao Xing added the final polish, and successfully created the secret skill.

It was precisely because of the fact that the secret skill had been through the hands of many people, and the person who had finally managed to successfully complete it was also not very strong, it led to the secret skill itself possessing a much weaker power than the Ancient Era’s War Clan’s secret skill.

However, the Ancient Era’s Monstrous Clan had managed to successfully forge its usage. In other words, while the secret skill itself was not very strong, it was extremely useful. This was especially true when the secret skill was used against opponents that possessed secret skills. It could be said that the secret skill would be a marvelous technique.

“He... he actually managed to subdue Lord Secret Skill.”

“How could this be? Exactly who is he?”

At that moment, Chu Feng had a smile across his face. However, the Ancient Era’s Monstrous Clansmen were completely ashen.

To them, the secret skill was their Ancient Era’s Monstrous Clan’s final hope. Yet at that moment... Chu Feng had obliterated even their final hope.
