Chapter 5902: Familiar Jar

By then, the sacred temple had fully emerged. The clan chief and Elder Sheng formed hand seals, and the sacred mountain shook. 

The fog concealing the mountain dissipated, opening up Chu Feng and the others’ vision. They could finally see just how huge the sacred mountain was.

A golden light slowly rose from the entire sacred mountain and converged toward the sacred temple, as if the world was offering the temple its prayers. When all of the golden lights finally fused into the sacred temple, the sacred temple looked even more brilliant than ever.

Words surfaced, confirming Chu Feng’s conjecture that this was a training ground for the Three Saints Monstrous Clan, and that someone in the clan would receive the legacy now that the last two formations had been breached.

Both the Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief and Elder Sheng breathed a sigh of relief and smiled. These two words confirmed that Chu Xuanyuan did successfully breach the formation back then.

Weng!

Two streaks of golden light burst forth from the sacred temple and fell on the Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief and Sansheng Qiutian.

“Is that the legacy?” Elder Sheng and Sansheng Xingyu looked both astonished and delighted.

Chu Feng and Zi Ling simply watched the commotion, but they could feel the great power lurking inside the golden lights. That was bloodline power. Once the bloodline power seeped into their bodies, their Three Saints Monstrous Clan would rise to greater heights. 

After the two streaks of golden light fully fused into their bodies, both the Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief and Sansheng Qiutian gasped for air. The two of them felt incredulous.

The first thing they did was to exchange looks.

“Father, did we… really obtain the legacy?” Sansheng Qiutian asked.

“Don’t doubt it, my son. Both of us have obtained the legacy,” the clan chief replied with a smile.

“But… why me?” Sansheng Qiutian looked at Sansheng Xingyu, feeling deeply apologetic as he knew that she was the most talented prodigy in the Three Saints Monstrous Clan.

However, Sansheng Xingyu didn’t look envious in the least. Instead, she revealed a heartened smile and said, “I told you there wouldn’t be anything wrong with our ancestors’ needle.”

Boom!

The world suddenly rumbled. It sounded like a ferocious beast was growling. 

The surrounding space shook as a tremendous power swiftly built up in the sacred temple, waiting to be unleashed. 

“It’s coming. It’s the sacred temple’s energy. What a huge commotion!” the clan chief excitedly exclaimed. 

The energy that was currently building up was the energy the sacred temple would bestow to them if they successfully breached the sacred mountain’s formations. The clan chief was planning to use this energy to break the Three Saints Monstrous Clan out of the barrier trapping them here. 

Thus, he quickly took out his token as the Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief. Only the clan chief could harness and use this energy.  

But right after he was prepared to accept the energy, the rumbles suddenly dissipated, and the energy gathering in the sacred temple suddenly receded. The world fell eerily silent.

“What’s going on, clan chief?” Elder Sheng asked.

“I’m not sure either.” The clan chief was equally confused.

“Big brother Chu Feng, the Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief didn’t receive the power, right?” Zi Ling sent a voice transmission to Chu Feng.

“For some reason, the bestowment of the energy was abruptly halted,” Chu Feng replied.

The Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief took out his token and studied it, but no matter what he tried, he was unable to evoke the energy in the sacred temple. “I… didn’t do anything wrong. Why did the bestowment of energy suddenly halt? Where did our energy go?”

He was baffled, anxious, and frustrated. 

Receiving the legacy after clearing the sacred mountain’s final formation was a delightful surprise, but his goal was to obtain the sacred temple’s energy and break free of the barrier trapping them. 

“Does the sacred mountain not want the Three Saints Monstrous Clan to leave?” Zi Ling asked Chu Feng via voice transmission.

“That’s possible,” Chu Feng replied.

He looked toward the sacred temple and saw that its gates were open. He held himself back since the clan chief hadn’t entered it yet, but he could still see what was inside.

The sacred temple looked like a tribute hall. At the center of the temple were dozens of jars, looking like an ancestral worship altar.

Chu Feng found those jars inexplicably familiar. 

All of a sudden, he noticed that there was an empty slot on the altar—one of the jars had gone missing. 

“Could it be…?”

Chu Feng suddenly remembered picking up a jar when he first entered the sacred mountain a long time ago. That jar was identical to the ones placed on the altar. 

He had opened the jar, and it released a huge bundle of black gaseous flame that he initially thought was an imprint. However, when he inspected the jar and found it empty, he belatedly realized that the black gaseous flame could have been what was contained inside the jar… but he released it by accident.

“Lord Clan Chief,” Elder Sheng suddenly called the Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief with a flustered voice.Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

The clan chief was still trying to figure out what had gone wrong and whether he could make the energy reappear when he heard Elder Sheng’s voice and turned over.

Elder Sheng gestured to the sacred temple with his eyes, specifically the empty slot on the altar.

“Why is there one missing?” Horrified, the clan chief quickly rose into the air and flitted toward the sacred temple. 

“The rest of you stay put first,” Elder Sheng told Sansheng Qiutian and the others. 

He even tossed out a treasure that manifested a powerful barrier around them. Following that, he entered the sacred temple.

The two of them drew their weapons right after stepping into the sacred temple. Their wary attitudes made it seem as if they were up against a powerful enemy.
