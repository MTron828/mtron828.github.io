Chapter 2265 - Situation Turning Bad

“If you refuse to tell me, it would mean that you are deceiving me,” Chu Feng said.

“Are you threatening me?” The old cat’s eyes narrowed as it started at Chu Feng.

“No, it’s not a threat. Rather, I am just waiting for your decision,” Chu Feng also narrowed his eyes as he revealed a slight smile.

At that moment, Chu Feng and the old cat were looking at one another. Neither one of them said anything.

Just like that, the two continued to look at one another for a long time.

After a while, the old cat was finally unable to contain itself. It said, “Forget about it, forget about it. Seeing that you are someone of the younger generation, this great sir will yield to you and help you find that tomb first.”

The old cat began to act immediately after it said those words. After agreeing to help Chu Feng find the tomb, it immediately leapt onto that empty field.

Then, its two claws began to move about in unison. In a very experienced manner, the old cat began to draw the diagram for a spirit formation.

As the saying goes, one would know whether someone was an expert the moment they unleashed their skill. When the old cat unleashed its skill, even Chu Feng’s eyes started to shine brightly.

In fact, even Her Lady Queen, who had been making remarks at the old cat the entire time, revealed an astonished expression in her beautiful eyes.

“I truly couldn’t tell that even though that cat is ugly, its knowledge of world spirit techniques is quite profound,” Her Lady Queen was unable to contain herself, and started to praise the old cat.

Chu Feng nodded in agreement to Her Lady Queen’s praise.

Amazing. The spirit formation diagram the old cat was outlining was that of an extremely powerful spirit formation. It was a spirit formation that even Chu Feng felt he might not be able to see through. The composition of that spirit formation had actually surpassed all of the spirit formations that Chu Feng had previously grasped.

That spirit formation was an extremely powerful unsealing formation. It was a spirit formation that was extremely difficult to set up.

The amazing aspect of that old cat was that it had managed to sketch out the diagram of that extremely difficult-to-set-up unsealing formation into a diagram that was much easier to understand.

If knowing about that spirit formation and being able to outline a diagram to show how to set it up was the old cat’s ability, then the fact that the old cat was able to make the outline diagram for a spirit formation that was extremely difficult to set up much easier would mean that the old cat was extremely skillful.

.........

At the same time. Outside the forbidden area. The Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master, who had originally stayed in his own residence, had arrived at another forbidden area in the Sunset Cloud Valley.

This place was a special location for the important people in the Sunset Cloud Valley to undergo closed-door training.

The reason why he had come here so urgently was because Xu Yiyi’s master, Su Jingrui, had just come out from his closed-door training.

He wanted to know whether or not Su Jingrui had truly ordered Chu Luyang that he was not allowed to attack the Red Butterfly Society again. He also wanted to know whether those Law Enforcement Elders were present when those words were said.

“Truly outrageous! Their crimes cannot be forgiven!!!”

Suddenly, the Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master let out a shout of overflowing anger.

Although he trusted Xu Yiyi, Elder Ning Shuang and Chu Feng, he also trusted Li Rui’s master, as well as his Law Enforcement Department’s Elders.

Thus, to a greater or lesser degree, he still had suspicions in his heart, and could not be absolutely certain about the truth of the situation.

This was also the reason why he had not severely punished Li Rui’s master or the Law Enforcement Elders on the spot.

However, after hearing Su Jingrui’s accounting of the matter, the truth had been revealed. As for that result, it was something that the Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master found difficult to accept.

After all, he had placed enormous trust in Li Rui’s master and those Law Enforcement Department’s Elders.

“I was truly blind to entrust such a heavy amount of power to him.”

“I am fortunate to have discovered this matter. If I didn’t, who knows how many more people he would have ended up killing?”

At that moment, the Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master suddenly had a sensation of a sudden realization. The reason for that was because it was not the first time that something like this had happened.

In the past, he had chosen to believe in Li Rui’s master. However, after what had happened today, he suddenly felt that all his previous decisions had been mistakes.

“Lord Valley Master, these things have already happened. Even if you are to blame yourself now, it would be useless. Right now, your top priority should be to punish Tuoba Shangshui accordingly and choose a new Head Elder for the Law Enforcement Department.” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Someone like Tuoba Shangshui absolutely cannot be allowed to hold heavy responsibility again,” Su Jingrui said.

“Elder Su, how do you think I should punish Tuoba Shangshui?” The Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master asked.

“You are the Valley Master. Thus, you should be the one to decide,” Su Jingrui smiled lightly.

The Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master looked to his surroundings. After he confirmed that there was no one in the surroundings, he said to Su Jingrui, “Senior brother, there are no outsiders here. So, just put forth a proposal for your junior brother.”

“You still consider me as your senior brother?” Su Jingrui smiled lightly. However, his smile contained a special meaning.

“Senior brother, it remains that I am currently the Valley Master. As such, for certain things, I must consider the general situation. However, in my heart, you have always been my senior brother,” The Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master actually bowed respectfully to Su Jingrui after he finished saying those words.

In response, Su Jingrui sighed. Then, he said, “I had already told you that Tuoba Shangshui had issues with his character. Yet, you insisted on putting him in an important position.”

“Senior brother, it was you who did not want to bother with the affairs of our Sunset Cloud Valley. Otherwise, the position of the Head Law Enforcement Elder was definitely going to be yours. How could he possibly have had the chance to become the Head Law Enforcement Elder?” The Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master said.

“Are you implying that it’s my fault?” Su Jingrui cast a side eye at the Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master.

“This junior brother did not mean that,” The Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master said with a slightly apologetic tone. Although he was the Lord Valley Master and held a high status, he did not possess the arrogance of a Valley Master before Su Jingrui. Instead, he possessed the humility of a junior brother.

“The rules established by our founder cannot be altered. Not to mention that Tuoba Shangshui had a problem with his moral character, even if he was an outstanding talent, he cannot be tolerated after making this sort of mistake.”

“You should kill him,” Su Jingrui said.

“This...” Hearing those words, the Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master entered a difficult situation.

He understood all of it. Merely, it was as Su Jingrui had said, he was reluctant to kill Tuoba Shangshui.

“How about this? As long as you’re willing to kill him, I am willing to take on the position of the Head Law Enforcement Elder,” Su Jingrui said.

“Senior brother, you should’ve said so sooner,” Hearing those words, the Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master immediately revealed an overjoyed expression. He said, “Like this, when little friend Chu Feng comes out, I will immediately execute Tuoba Shangshui, as well as his henchmen, as per the rules of our Sunset Cloud Valley.”

“This would also be the perfect timing to curb the unhealthy air brewing in our Sunset Cloud Valley.”

“It seems that you possess eyesight like Yiyi, and think very highly of that Chu Feng,” Su Jingrui said with a smile.

“Now that you mention it, Yiyi’s eyesight is truly decent. That Chu Feng is truly a rare talent. Unfortunately, he will not be able to be utilized by our Sunset Cloud Valley,” The Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master said.

“His talent is indeed decent. However, to say that he’s a talent, wouldn’t that be a bit excessive?” Su Jingrui said.

“Senior brother, you have been in closed-door training the entire time, and don’t know about what has happened in this short period of time. That Chu Feng became an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist on Mount Cloud Crane.”

“Have you ever met an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist as young as him?” The Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master asked.

“He became an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist?” Hearing those words, Su Jingrui was very shocked.

“Furthermore, I have personally seen his world spirit techniques. My mother’s illness has been thoroughly cured by him,” The Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master said.

“That is truly a good thing,” After knowing that the Valley Master’s mother’s illness had been cured, Su Jingrui revealed a joyous expression. He then said, “In that case, it would seem that Chu Feng is truly a talent.”

“Lord Valley Master, this is bad!” Right at that moment, a management elder rushed over anxiously.

“What has happened?” In response, the Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master’s expression changed. The reason for that was because that management elder was the person that he had ordered to secretly monitor the Law Enforcement Department.

“Elder Tuoba, he, he charged into the forbidden area,” That management elder said.

“Which forbidden area?” The Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master asked.

“Chu Feng, it’s the forbidden area Chu Feng is in.”

“Not only has he entered the forbidden area, he has also captured Elder Ning Shuang and Xu Yiyi,” That management elder said.

“What?” Hearing those words, the expressions of the Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master and Su Jingrui both changed enormously.
