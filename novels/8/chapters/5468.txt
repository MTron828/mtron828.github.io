Chapter 5468: He Can’t Step Into the Armory Hall

Long Yuhong’s complexion looked awful. She felt like her cheeks were stinging even though no one had struck her. There was nothing she would like more than to find a burrow to dive into at this very moment, but of course, someone of her stature couldn’t possibly do that.

Thus, she glared at Grandma Jin in frustration and roared, “What’s going on?”

The crowd could clearly feel her anger.

Grandma Jin was at a loss for words. She did know that the Myriad Treasures Dragon Exalted didn’t discriminate between Totem Dragon Clansmen and outsiders, but she didn’t think that there would be an outsider talented enough to trigger it.

She stared intently at Chu Feng, hoping to see what was so special about him. Why was he able to induce such a reaction from the Myriad Treasures Dragon Exalted?

A suction force released by the Myriad Treasures Dragon Exalted dragged Chu Feng over to a giant copper sculpture. It was a sculpture of a massive Cosmos Sack with a dragon coiling around it. There was nothing exquisite about this sculpture, but it harnessed great power.

The light emanated by the sculpture rippled into the surroundings and manifested into a transparent barrier that sealed off the area. While the others were unable to step in, they could see what was going on outside.

“That Chu Feng… is really taking the test.”

The Totem Dragon Clansmen revealed indignant looks.

The test from the Myriad Treasures Dragon Exalted was simple—one simply had to stand on a pedestal, and the Dragon Exalted would determine if one was qualified or not. Those deemed to be qualified would receive a treasure.

The crowd couldn’t come to terms with the fact that the Myriad Treasures Dragon Exalted had opened its eyes for an outsider like Chu Feng. Furthermore, this was a different phenomenon from what Long Muxi and Long Chengyu experienced. It was the first time something like this had happened since the Totem Dragon Clan took possession of it.

…

Meanwhile, Long Chengyu, Long Kuitian, and Long Suqing were gathered inside a majestic palace in the Totem Dragon Clan, but the person sitting in the main seat was someone else.

He was Long Xu, the chief of the Totem Dragon Clan’s Nine Flags Dragon Warriors. He wielded great authority within the clan. In fact, he was even above the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief in terms of sheer seniority.

Long Chengyu had just explained to Long Xu about what they had been through and insisted on having Chu Feng enter the Armory Hall together with him.

“That won’t do. How can an outsider be allowed into our Armory Hall?” Long Xu asked impassively.

“It won’t do?” Long Chengyu frowned. “I have already given my word on this. I’ll become a joke if I go back on my words.”

“Then you shouldn’t have made such a promise in the first place then,” Long Xu replied.

“Chu Feng is a prodigy worth investing a God Armament in. Taking a step back, there’s no guarantee that he would be able to tame a God Armament. If we could win him over with this simple gesture, there’s no reason not to do so,” Long Chengyu said.

“Is Chu Feng really that talented?” Long Xu turned toward Long Kuitian and Long Suqing.

Long Kuitian and Long Suqing lavished compliments on Chu Feng. Even though Long Kuitian was still averse to the idea of allowing Chu Feng to enter the Armory Hall, he still wanted to help Long Chengyu realize his promise since he had already given his word.

“Such a prodigy actually emerged from the Ancestral Martial Galaxy?” Long Xu mused.

“It’s the God’s Era, after all. Prodigies are bound to emerge from all galaxies. I have no doubt that Chu Feng is the representative of the Ancestral Martial Galaxy. Lord Long Xu, I am certain that we should get on good terms with Chu Feng,” Long Chengyu said. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Haa… Chengyu, it’s not that I want to make things difficult for you. I’d have been open to the idea if it had been any other occasion. I would have also considered your request if Chu Feng was a normal cultivator. However, I can’t budge on this matter this time around,” Long Xu said.

“Lord Long Xu, are you really going to snub me?” Long Chengyu asked sternly.

“Young master Chengyu, I have the Totem Dragon Clan’s best interest at heart. How can I allow our valuable God Armaments to fall into the hands of an outsider?” Long Xu asked.

“In my capacity as the young master of the Totem Dragon Clan, I order you to allow Chu Feng into the Armory Hall,” Long Chengyu said as he whipped out his identity token.

“Young master Chengyu, I’m afraid that you don’t have the authority to order me around,” Long Xu replied with a smile.

“What if I convince my father?”

“I’d have no choice but to concede if Lord Clan Chief chooses to back you on this matter. However, Lord Clan Chief is currently out.”

“I’ll look for my father.”

“Young master Chengyu, Lord Clan Chief has headed to the Seven Realms Galaxy. The other galactic overlords are there too.”

“Is this related to the God’s Era?” Long Chengyu asked.

“That’s right,” Long Xu replied.

Long Chengyu knew that he mustn’t disturb his father when he was attending to something of such grave importance, but he was unwilling to give up on this matter. Thus, he said, “I’ll wait till father returns.”

Long Xu frowned. He took a gentler tone and said, “Young master Chengyu, you should know that this opening of the Armory Hall is different from usual. We have devoted great resources to increase the chances of taming a God Armament. That’s the reason I’m unwilling to allow Chu Feng, and you should know that too. In fact, the Armory Hall would have been opened if not for Miss Muxi. Now that Miss Muxi is back, we should quickly get it done and over with.”

“You’re saying that you wouldn’t have opened the Armory Hall if not for me and my big sister?” Long Chengyu asked.

“Naturally,” Long Xu replied.

“That’s more reason for you to permit Chu Feng’s entry into the Armory Hall. Neither my big sister nor I will enter the Armory Hall if you don’t grant Chu Feng permission. It’s possible that my big sister might sever her ties with our clan once more because of this. Lord Long Xu, can you take responsibility if that happens?” Long Chengyu asked.

“I’ll have no choice but to force the two of you inside then,” Long Xu replied.

“Audacious!”

Long Chengyu pointed his finger at Long Xu, but Long Suqing pressed his hand down before he could say anything.

“Chengyu, don’t be impolite. You shouldn’t disrespect Lord Long Xu,” Long Suqing said.

As infuriated as Long Chengyu was, he had to concede that Long Suqing was right. Long Xu was a respected elder who had contributed greatly to the clan, after all. Thus, he swallowed the nasty words that he was about to spout to the latter.

“Lord Long Xu, I’ll be frank with you. Chu Feng means a lot to Muxi. If you stop Chu Feng from entering the Armory Hall, there is a good chance that Muxi might completely sever ties with the Totem Dragon Clan,” Long Suqing said.

“If Miss Muxi is willing to go to the extent of severing ties with our clan over an outsider, I can only say that her departure might be a good thing to our clan,” Long Xu replied coldly.

Long Chengyu’s face turned livid. The one thing he absolutely couldn’t tolerate was anyone making light of his big sister. Naturally, he couldn’t accept what Long Xu had just said.

However, someone beat him to throwing a tantrum.

“Long Xu, what dog crap are you spouting? You’re getting arrogant. It’s out of courtesy that I call you ‘Lord Long Xu’, but you really think that you are the chief of the Nine Flags Dragon Warriors, huh? Let me make things clear to you. Whether you like it or not, Chu Feng will be entering the Armory Hall. If you push Muxi away once more, I’ll slice you up and feed you to the dogs!”

Long Suqing shoved her finger into Long Xu’s face and berated him.

Long Chengyu was startled. Even he dared not to utter such awful words.
