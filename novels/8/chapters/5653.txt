Chapter 5653: Don’t Regret It, Elder

“Damn it!”

Despite Fu Xing’s surge in fighting prowess, the black humanoid figure was able to teleport so fast that she was always a step too late no matter how she chased him.

“Head to the southwest corner,” Chu Feng sent a voice transmission to Fu Xing.

The latter caught the drift and quickly headed in that direction.

As expected, Chu Feng appeared behind her next, followed by the black humanoid figure.

Fu Xing quickly plunged her sword toward him, but the black humanoid figure raised his saber and easily deflected her attack before rushing at Chu Feng once more.

“What do you mean by this?” Fu Xing was angered.

The black humanoid figure burst into laughter and said, “He’s enhancing your fighting prowess through a support formation. You’d be a goner once I deal with him.”

“Miss Fu, this won’t work. He’s too fast. I won’t be able to support you with my formation if you aren’t able to stop him. I’ll have to focus my effort on escaping,” Chu Feng said.

He had constructed many teleportation formations and protective formations in advance after the first failure, but he noticed that all of the formations he had constructed in advance had lost their effectiveness upon entering the hall. This made him realize that there was some kind of restriction in the hall that prevented him from using pre-constructed formations.

It was difficult for him to simultaneously channel the support formation while quickly constructing new teleportation formations to escape.

“Prioritize your safety. I’ll deal with him,” Fu Xing replied.

Chu Feng stopped channeling the support formation to focus on escaping, while Fu Xing continued chasing after the black humanoid figure.

She knew that she had to quickly end things. There was a duration limit to how long the Celestial Master’s Sacred Pill lasted. It wouldn’t be to their advantage to continue dragging things out.

“Caught you.”

The black humanoid figure slowed down, allowing Fu Xing to get him into her range of attack. She thought that this was a chance for her to take him down.

“Heh…”

The black humanoid figure suddenly turned around and accelerated, wrapping his hand around Fu Xing’s neck in the blink of an eye.

Boom!

With a fling of his arm, he pressed Fu Xing down onto the ground and stepped on the sword in her hand. At the same time, he pressed his saber against her abdomen. After subduing Fu Xing, he turned to Chu Feng, who was gasping for air not too far away.

“Admit defeat, or else I’ll slaughter her.”

“All right, I’ll admit defeat. Don’t hurt her,” Chu Feng said.

The black humanoid figure released Fu Xing and stepped away.

“You bastard!”

Fu Xing, who was freed from the black humanoid figure’s grasp, quickly got to her feet and charged at him, only to be enveloped in a surge of teleportation energy right after. Before she knew it, she was already teleported outside the hall together with Chu Feng.

The teleportation energy had come not from the black humanoid figure but from the hall, which meant that the remnant had deemed them to have failed the trial.

“You still have one last chance. Fail once more, and you will lose your qualification to step into this hall ever again. Carefully ponder about how you can defeat me. You might as well give up if you don’t have good ideas,” the black humanoid figure said before placing his saber down and closing his eyes.Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

He was so confident as if he was certain that Chu Feng and Fu Xing wouldn’t be a match for him.

“Miss Fu…”

Chu Feng was just about to say something when Fu Xing passed another Celestial Master’s Sacred Pill to Chu Feng with a wave of her sleeves. She then took another one out and tossed it into her own mouth before marching into the hall.

“Calm down, Miss Fu!”

Chu Feng tried to stop her, knowing that Fu Xing was angered by the black humanoid figure’s insult, but he was still a step too late. Fu Xing had stepped into the hall, prompting the black humanoid figure to open his eyes.

The black humanoid figure looked a little disappointed upon seeing Fu Xing. With a helpless and contemptuous smile, he said, “Someone who acts on their feelings doesn’t deserve to come here.”

“Is that so?” Fu Xing sneered as she tossed her sword to Chu Feng with a wave of her sleeves.

As the sword fell into Chu Feng’s grasp, it reverted from a beautiful, rose-red sword back into a black metallic lump. When Chu Feng raised his gaze to look at Fu Xing, he noticed a brilliant light coming from her. She had constructed a support formation too.

“Miss Fu, what do you mean by this?” Chu Feng asked.

“Cut the crap. I know you can use that sword. Use it to teach this arrogant fellow a lesson,” Fu Xing spat through gritted teeth.

“You’re swapping positions? Well, I look forward to seeing how that will turn out.”

The black humanoid figure’s disappointment was alleviated upon seeing how Fu Xing was willing to step back and support Chu Feng. He had also realized that Chu Feng was the more competent of the two.

“Elder, I hope that you won’t regret this,” Chu Feng replied with a smile as he swallowed the Celestial Master’s Sacred Pill and stepped into the hall too. He infused his spirit power into the sword, and the hall shook.

The four meters long black metallic lump morphed into a ten-meter-long black sword enveloped in a black aura. It looked imposing and terrifying. Furthermore, the black aura further extended to envelop Chu Feng as well.

“He’s able to perfectly complement the sword?” Fu Xing widened her eyes in astonishment.

“Looks like things are finally going to get interesting,” the black humanoid figure remarked.
