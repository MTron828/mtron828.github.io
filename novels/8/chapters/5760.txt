Chapter 5760: Consecutive Breakthroughs, Rank Five Half-God

Chu Feng crushed the two pearls and began assimilating them. When he took their energies into his body, he noticed that the energies had been carefully nurtured and fused into the pearls.

In particular, the pearl he had received from Huangfu Shengyu enhanced his bloodline, spirit power, martial power, and profound skills. It would take astounding skills to fuse these different energies together into a single pearl. While these pearls might not have been created by the Huangfu Heavenly Clan themselves, it hinted at the resources they had at their disposal.

However, there was a downside to them—there was a limit to how much energy one could absorb from them.

These pearls were invaluable cultivation resources, harnessing a great amount of energy, but most people could only benefit from assimilating one. They wouldn’t be able to absorb anything more than that.

“This won’t do. I can’t waste such invaluable cultivation resources.”

Chu Feng stopped assimilating the energies from pearls and instead constructed a formation to fuse the energies together so as to reconstruct them. He wanted to change the limitation on the pearls. At the very least, he was confident of at least breaking the limitation of two pearls.

“It worked!”

Soon, Chu Feng smiled in delight. He had overcome the upper limit of the pearls. It was still difficult for him to fully reap the benefit from the two pearls, but it was much better than before.

“Such a pity they can’t see it,” Chu Feng said with a mischievous smile.

The five Huangfus were definitely aware of the limitations of the pearls. They would likely be bewildered if they saw that Chu Feng could overcome its fundamental usage limitation and benefit from the energies of both pearls. It was a pity they weren’t here to see it.

Chu Feng absorbed the energies into his body while channeling the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique to enhance his martial enlightenment. He wanted to reap as much benefit from the pearls.

Boom!

Dark clouds soon gathered in the sky above the Nine Heavens’ Zenith, and nine lightning beasts roared in ferocity.

“What an incredible phenomenon! It’s caused by a Heavenly Bloodline possessor practicing the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique, right? Who could it be?”

The experts around the Pulse Ignition Village could tell that the phenomenon was caused by someone who practiced the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique, but the phenomenon was so terrifying that it induced fear and unease. They had never experienced anything like this before.

“No, this is far stronger than usual. I have never seen anything like this before. Who’s making this breakthrough? Could it be a hidden expert?”

The phenomenon spanned such a huge swathe of the sky that it was impossible to determine where it had originated from until the lightning finally fell. Soon, the dark clouds converged into a bolt of terrifying lightning that struck down on the Nine Heavens’ Zenith.

“It’s directed in the Nine Heavens’ Zenith! It’s a junior who’s making a breakthrough!”

“Who in the world is it? Could it be… Chu Feng?”

The first person that came to most people’s minds was Chu Feng, as they knew that he had not only inherited Jie Ranqing’s Ruler’s Bloodline but also possessed an overwhelmingly powerful Heavenly Bloodline. In fact, the phenomenon induced by his Heavenly Bloodline back in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion was even greater than that from his Ruler’s Bloodline.

This phenomenon was not as frightening, but it had a similar vibe. As time passed, the crowd became more convinced that it was induced by Chu Feng.

Needless to say, those who had been in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion that day to witness the phenomenon Chu Feng had induced up close could also tell that Chu Feng was making a breakthrough.

The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master was in the midst of cultivating in his palace when he heard the discussions outside. He clenched his jaws, as he found himself unable to focus anymore.

The experts from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion dared not to speak a word about the matter, even through voice transmission. They knew that their mansion master was in a terrible mood following Jie Tian’s elimination, and this incident would only worsen his mood.

The crowd viewed the phenomenon from the Pulse Ignition Realm, but Song Changsheng was witnessing it from outer space. Being much closer to the phenomenon, he could better sense its formidable prowess. Had it been anyone else here instead of him, they would have likely fainted from its sheer might even though the phenomenon couldn’t hurt them.

“The phenomenon induced by the Heavenly Lightning Bloodline is impressive up close, though the extent of it… he has probably already surpassed his father, right?” Song Changsheng said.

…

While those outside the Nine Heavens’ Zenith were impressed by the phenomenon, those within couldn’t see or sense it at all due to the formation surrounding it. Even Chu Feng was unable to see it either, though he could sense the appearance of the phenomenon.

Soon, the heavenly lightning appeared out of thin air and zapped down on Chu Feng, devastating his soul as if to tear him into shreds. The lightning tribulation induced by the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique was much worse than other mysterious techniques.

However, Chu Feng was used to it. There wasn’t even the slightest change in his expression, as if this lightning tribulation was nothing to him. The lightning tribulation became more intense as if enraged by his lack of respect, but in the end, it could only admit defeat and seep into his body.

Chu Feng’s aura intensified, as his cultivation rose to rank four Half-God level.

However, his eyes remained closed as he continued cultivating. There were impressive amounts of energies in the two pearls. He wanted to try making two consecutive breakthroughs, and he felt that there was a good chance he could pull it off.

“It looks like I won’t be able to do it.” Chu Feng soon stood up and sighed.

He was already extremely close, but he could sense that he was still a bit off.

“The cultivation ground!” Chu Feng’s eyes suddenly lit up as he rushed toward the cultivation ground.

It would be difficult for him to make a breakthrough with just the cultivation ground itself, but there was a decent chance he could pull it off with the energies he had just received from the pearls. Thus, he leaped into the cultivation ground and continued his cultivation.

The results soon showed.

…

Black clouds continued to linger above Pulse Ignition Village, as the heavenly lightning phenomenon had yet to completely fade.

Boom!

All of a sudden, the heavenly lightning crackled once more with greater force than before.

“It can’t be… Did he make consecutive breakthroughs? What kind of cultivation speed is this?”

It was not as if they had never seen anyone making consecutive breakthroughs before, but it was a difficult feat to pull off, especially at higher cultivation levels. It was not just a problem of cultivation resources but martial enlightenment too.

The juniors in the Nine Heavens’ Zenith were at least at Half-God level, and they had never heard of any Half-God level cultivators making consecutive breakthroughs before.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Did Chu Feng come here to infuriate the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion?”

“Insane! So, this is Jie Ranqing’s son?”

“Jie Tian is also the grandson of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master, but he was the first one to be eliminated. What a jarring contrast!”

The crowd dared not to speak aloud. The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion had people in the vicinity, and they wouldn’t allow others to talk badly about them.

Even so, this changed their impression of Chu Feng. Even talented cultivators with ample cultivation resources could easily spend decades to make a breakthrough, and the less talented could take thousands to tens of thousands of years.

In fact, those who could reach Half-God level were prodigies in their own rights. It was just whether they were the cream of the crop in this group. They understood how difficult cultivation was, and that was why they were impressed by Chu Feng.

They could tell from this consecutive heavenly lightning phenomenon that Chu Feng’s talent was the real deal.

Soon, the heavenly lightning bolted into the Nine Heavens’ Zenith once more. Chu Feng absorbed the heavenly lightning before finally opening his eyes.

“I can finally hold my head up now that I have reached rank five Half-God level,” Chu Feng said with irrepressible joy.

While he had the Asura King, a True God level world spirit, to fall back on, he could only summon the latter two more times before the gate closed again. Ultimately, he still had to rely on himself.

With his cultivation reaching rank five Half-God level, he could at least put up a fight against the likes of Qin Xuan if he exerted his full strength.

If the Heaven-devouring Qilin could raise his cultivation level by at least a rank after assimilating the dragon essence, he could stand his ground against Huangfu Shengyu. And if the increment was two ranks, he could join the ranks as one of the strongest juniors in the world of cultivation.
