Chapter 1987 - Virtuous Thought, Evil Thought

“Eggy, I’m sorry. Due to my stubbornness, you’ll be forced to die with me.”

“Merely, I truly cannot abandon Lil Rou and Lil Mei,” Chu Feng did not escape. Instead, he hugged Su Rou and Su Mei tightly.

As for Su Rou and Su Mei, the two of them also managed to sense the changes in the Fire and Ice Pearls. Seeing that Chu Feng did not leave, they stopped urging him to leave. Instead, like him, they also tightly hugged Chu Feng. As silent tears were shed, they buried their little faces into Chu Feng’s bosom.

To them, if they were to die like this, it would be worth it.

It was the same for Chu Feng. He was willing to die together with his lovers.

Merely, at this moment, Chu Feng was still feeling very complicated. His heart was filled with the sensation of falling short and letting down someone.

After all, Chu Feng was not alone. Contained within his world spirit space was Eggy. He possessed the means to release Eggy from his body.

However, as Eggy was currently asleep, even if Chu Feng were to release her, Eggy would not be able to escape. Thus, Eggy was destined to die together with them. That was the reason why Chu Feng felt very guilty and ashamed.

“Buzz~~~”

Right at that moment, Chu Feng suddenly felt that his awareness started to grow fuzzy. When he looked to his surroundings, he was shocked to discover that, even though he remained where he previously was, Su Rou and Su Mei who he’d been hugging had disappeared. Furthermore, a vast white mist covered his surroundings and blocked his line of sight. He was unable to see more than a distance of ten meters.

“You’re actually not afraid of death?” Right at that moment, a woman’s voice sounded from the thick mist.

Turning toward the voice, Chu Feng saw a woman slowly walking toward him from the vast mist. That woman was wearing a snow-white skirt, and had a very beautiful appearance. Furthermore, she gave off an extremely extraordinary aura. A celestial fairy. From merely a single glance, Chu Feng had the sensation that the woman before him not only appeared like a celestial fairy, rather, her incomparable aura was simply that of a celestial fairy.

“Are you the Moon Immortal?” Chu Feng asked. Chu Feng felt that the person before him was very likely the Moon Immortal. In other words, the legendary Moon Demon.

“Answer my question. Are you not afraid of death?” That woman asked. Even though she looked like a celestial fairy, her tone was extremely ice-cold and without a trace of emotion.

“I am. Who wouldn’t be afraid of death? I still have a lot of things that I need to finish. I naturally do not wish to die,” Chu Feng said with a smile. What he said was the truth.

Upon hearing Chu Feng’s words, that woman’s long, shapely eyebrows narrowed slightly. A trace of misgiving flashed through her eyes. She asked, “Since you’re afraid of death, why didn’t you escape?”

“Even though I’m afraid of death, I cannot disregard my lovers. Since I cannot protect them, I can only accompany them in death,” The smile on Chu Feng’s face did not decrease. However, when he said those words, he revealed an expression of ease.

Even though Chu Feng did not wish to die, he was delighted to die alongside his lovers.

Chu Feng’s words caused that woman’s expression to turn slightly stiff. Then, she gently lifted her snow-white sleeve.

“Rumble~~~”

In an instant, the earth started to quake violently and a crimson gate rose from the ground. That gate appeared before Chu Feng.

That gate was a hundred meters tall. After it opened up, overflowing crimson light filled the gate. Anguished wailing sounded from within the gate nonstop. There were countless silhouettes being tormented within that gate. It was an appalling sight of devastation.

“Since you treasure your lovers so much, I’ll give you a chance. As long as you enter that gate, your soul will be subjected to torment. You will die after your soul is completely refined by me. However, that process will bring you so much pain that you will wish you were dead.”

“However, as for the two of them, they will be able to continue living because of you,” That woman pointed to the purgatory-like gate.

“Are you serious about this?” Chu Feng asked.

“Other than trusting me, you possess no other choice,” The woman said.

“In that case, senior, thank you,” Chu Feng said.

“Why thank me?” The woman was confused by Chu Feng thanking her.

“Originally, we were all going to die. However, senior is willing to spare my lovers’ lives. Naturally, I have to thank you,” Chu Feng said with a smile. Then, his feet started to move. Soon, he leapt forward. Like an arrow that was just shot from a bow, he jumped into that purgatory gate.

For his lovers, Chu Feng had chosen the path of no return without the slightest hesitation.

“Buzz~~~”

However, after Chu Feng entered that gate, he was surprised to discover that he had returned to reality. Su Rou and Su Mei were still in his bosom. The vast mist that had surrounded him and blocked his sight had also disappeared.

However, compared to before, this place had changed slightly. That is, the Fire and Ice Pearls that were on the verge of eruption had calmed down.

Seeing that, Chu Feng hurriedly continued to set up his spirit formation. He wished to seize this opportunity to remove the Fire and Ice Pearls from Su Rou and Su Mei. The reason for that was because Chu Feng had discovered that the two pearls were time bombs. He absolutely could not allow them to remain in Su Rou and Su Mei’s bodies.

“Big brother Chu Feng, wait a moment,” However, right when Chu Feng was about to remove the two pearls, Su Mei suddenly spoke to stop him and grabbed his arm.

“Lil Mei, don’t be scared. I guarantee that it will not hurt,” Chu Feng said with a smile.

“No, don’t extract it,” Su Rou and Su Mei said in unison.

“Why?” Chu Feng was surprised.

“Big sister, you too?”

“Little sister, you too?”

At that moment, Su Rou and Su Mei looked to one another.

Chu Feng sensed that something was wrong. Thus, he asked, “Exactly what happened?”

“It would seem that I am the same as little sister. In that case, let me explain,” Su Rou smiled. Then, she said, “Contained within the Fire and Ice Pearls was a voice. That voice doesn’t seem to be from the Fire and Ice Pearls. Rather, it seems to be from their actual owner, the Moon Demon.”

“Moon Demon?” Chu Feng was startled. He had already met that Moon Demon earlier. Thus, he trusted what Su Rou said completely.

“The Moon Demon said that her virtuous thought had remained in the Fire and Ice Pearls the entire time. Merely, her evil thoughts still remained in the Moonlight Maze.”

“As long as you are capable of subduing her evil thoughts, she is willing to bestow her power to us sisters,” Su Rou said.

“I understand now,” As Chu Feng spoke, he stood up. Then, he set up a very powerful spirit formation that covered Su Rou and Su Mei. After that, he proceeded toward the location of the Moon Demon while bringing Su Rou and Su Mei with him.

He had truly understood. It turned out that the so-called Moon Immortal and Moon Demon were merely the virtuous thoughts and evil thoughts of the same person. The virtuous thoughts were the Immortal part, whereas the evil thoughts were the Demon part. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Currently, the virtuous thoughts were with them inside the Fire and Ice Pearls. It was that celestial fairy-like woman that Chu Feng had met earlier.

As for the evil thoughts, they were the Moon Demon that was currently letting out those frightening snarls.

Originally, Chu Feng had no idea how to contain the Moon Demon. He merely wanted to prevent the Dark Hall from controlling the Moon Demon.

However, the situation had now changed. With the assistance of the virtuous thoughts, Chu Feng knew that there must be a way to contain the Moon Demon.

After all, Qing Xuantian had said that the Fire and Ice Pearls were capable of turning the Moon Demon into the Moon Immortal. And now, he finally realized why the Fire and Ice Pearls possessed that usage.

Most importantly, if the virtuous thought were capable of honoring its promise, Su Rou and Su Mei would be able to make unprecedented progress in their strength.

It might even be possible for the two of them to surpass him, and enter a whole new realm of cultivation. Not only would that be a blessing to Su Rou and Su Mei, it would be a blessing to the entire Holy Land of Martialism. As long as they obtained the Moon Immortal’s power, even the Dark Hall would have to fear them.

Furthermore, even if the virtuous thoughts did not keep her promise, as long as Chu Feng assisted her, she would still become the Moon Immortal. Out of gratefulness from eliminating the Moon Demon, she should be willing to help him. In short... this would be a matter with only benefits and no harm.
