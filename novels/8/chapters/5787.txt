Chapter 5787: Bloodline Skill: God Lightning Bestowment

“Soul Fog? Is it the legendary power hidden in the Nine Souls Galaxy, the power that pushed the Nine Souls Sacred Clan to become a powerhouse in the world of cultivation?”

The crowd looked at Xian Miaomiao in a different light. They had thought that Xian Miaomiao was the weakest among them, but it turned out that she had been concealing her means.

Boom!

Huangfu Shengyu flitted forth and unleashed his martial skill.

Xian Miaomiao released a gush of Soul Fog to form a defensive barrier around Chu Feng and the others. She did manage to block off Huangfu Shengyu’s attack, but she spurted a mouthful of blood as a result.

However, Chu Feng realized that wasn’t all.

Xian Miaomiao’s life force was swiftly dissipating. She was able to block a True God level cultivator’s attack as a rank nine Half-God level cultivator not just because she possessed the Soul Fog, but because she had ignited her life force to further power the Soul Fog too.

“Stop, Miaomiao! You’ll die at this rate!” Chu Feng exclaimed.

The crowd was taken aback. They belatedly realized that Xian Miaomiao was paying a steep price for the power she was exerting.

With a trail of blood streaming from the corner of her lips, Xian Miaomiao turned to Chu Feng and asked with a smile, “Chu Feng, how long have we known each other?”

This abrupt question caught Chu Feng by surprise. This clearly wasn’t the time to be talking about this.

“So many years passed in a flash. When we first met, I never thought I’d be protected by you time and time again. I have received so much help from you, from our time in the Lower Realms to the Upper Realms, from the Ancestral Martial Galaxy to the Nine Souls Galaxy.

“Even when I became the princess of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan and thought I could finally be the one to protect you, you still ended up being the one to protect me. I’d have been long dead if not for you.

“To be honest, I am not very ambitious. I only started cultivating because everyone was doing so, and I didn’t want to fall behind. I was just following the crowd, and I didn’t have a goal of my own. However, I found my goal later on. I wanted to be able to stand in front of you one day and protect you from harm.

“Chu Feng,” Xian Miaomiao looked at him with a smile, though tears started flowing from her crescent-shaped eyes, “Thank you for everything you have done for me. Let me be the one to protect you today.”

Xian Miaomiao turned to Huangfu Shengyu. Her smile vanished in an instant, replaced by overwhelming killing intent. Her Soul Fog erupted like a devastating volcano and gushed toward him.

Huangfu Shengyu, despite his rank one True God level cultivation, was barely able to withstand the onslaught of the Soul Fog.

However, Xian Miaomiao was in a worse state. Her life force was quickly seeping away.

“Stop, big sister Miaomiao! I’ll slaughter him!”

Little Fishy wanted to rush out to deal with Huangfu Shengyu, but Xianhai Shaoyu stopped her. As much as he didn’t want to see Xian Miaomiao sacrifice herself, he didn’t want her little sister to be put in danger too.

The crowd quietly witnessed Xian Miaomiao’s sacrifice. They felt anguished, but there was nothing they could do.

Chu Feng looked at Xian Miaomiao, who was burning her life force to save him, before closing his eyes and immersing his consciousness into his dantian.

When he opened his eyes once more, a colossal red lightning beast was towering behind him.

“Are you certain, brat? Are you certain you wish to take on my challenge at your current cultivation level? I presume you understand the consequence of failure?” the red lightning beast’s voice echoed loudly in the world.

“Elder, I will be obtaining your power today, by hook or by crook,” Chu Feng said as he charged into the red lightning beast’s body.

Countless streaks of red lightning bolted at Chu Feng, devastating his body, but this didn’t slow his movements. He didn’t even let out a cry. His eyes were filled with unwavering determination.

He eventually arrived in the depths of the red lightning beast’s body, where he found a lightning scroll. Written on the lightning scroll were the words ‘Bloodline Skill: God Lightning Bestowment’.

Back in the Ancient Realm, the red lightning beast had appeared and saved Chu Feng from a quandary. That was the first time the red lightning beast had truly communicated with him.

The red lightning beast warned him to not use the Heavenly Lightning Nine Slashes anymore, as it consumed one’s bloodline, but at the same time, it also offered to impart its means to him. However, he mustn’t carelessly attempt to learn it, for if he failed, the red lightning beast would leave his dantian for good, never to become a part of his strength.

That was the reason Chu Feng had refrained from touching the lightning scroll thus far. In fact, he didn’t even know what kind of power it contained.

It was only after he absorbed a sliver of the Genesis Bloodline, thus enhancing his control over his bloodline power, that he finally understood the power harnessed in the lightning scroll.

With the ancient hall sealed, the Divine Deer down, and the Heaven-devouring Qilin not answering his calls, Chu Feng only had himself to rely on. This power was his only hope now.

He wrapped his hand around the lightning scroll as he said, “Thank you, elder.”

He then crushed the lightning scroll, and it seeped into his body as streaks of red lightning.

…

Tzlala!

All of a sudden, Little Fishy, Xianhai Shaoyu, Long Chengyu, and the others noticed a blinding red light flashing behind them, as well as a peculiar aura.VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Chu Feng…”

They turned around, only to be startled by what they saw.

Chu Feng was emanating red lightning reminiscent of domineering dragons. He still had his Lightning Mark, Lightning Armor, and Lightning Wings activated, but his red lightning enveloped all of his bloodline powers, turning the nine-colored lightning red.

The Lightning Mark became more domineering. The Lightning Armor turned more corporeal. The Lightning Wings turned red and grew ten times larger than before as if a demon’s wings had been bestowed upon a human.

Chu Feng opened his eyes, which had red lightning crackling within too. His aura swiftly enveloped the entire ancient hall.

“What did you do?”

The three Huangfus were the most shocked of all.

As possessors of the Heavenly Lightning Bloodline, they could tell that Chu Feng’s transformation had something to do with his bloodline, but they, despite being Huangfu Heavenly Clansmen, had never heard of such a means before.

Above all, they felt nervous and terrified by the red lightning, especially for Huangfu Shangyang. He couldn’t stop himself from shivering.

Chu Feng flitted over to Xian Miaomiao’s side and grabbed her hand. All of her power immediately dissipated.

“Chu Feng?” Xian Miaomiao was startled to see the red lightning-clad Chu Feng.

“Leave the rest to me, Miaomiao,” Chu Feng said with a smile.

With a flick of his wrist, he whipped out the Immemorial Hero’s Sword.

Tzlala!

Red lightning streamed down from Chu Feng’s palm into the Immemorial Hero’s Sword, cloaking it in red lightning too. It looked as if the sword had become a part of him too.

“Chu Feng, I’m talking to you. What’s that red lightning?” Huangfu Shengyu asked once more.

He was dying with curiosity about the red lightning. It fascinated him even more than the Genesis Bloodline and the Soul Fog.

“It’s a means you’ll never grasp, as well as the power that will take your life today,” Chu Feng said.

“What a joke! As formidable as your red lightning is, your cultivation is still at rank eight Half-God level cultivator. There’s an absolute gap between Half-Gods and True Gods. You aren’t a match for me!” Huangfu Shengyu sneered.

He was extremely jealous of Chu Feng’s bloodline and his means, but that didn’t mean that he feared Chu Feng. He still wielded the power of a True God level cultivator, after all. Everything was still under his control.

All of a sudden, Huangfu Shengyu froze in place.

The crowd was stunned too.

The red lightning-clad Chu Feng had suddenly appeared in front of Huangfu Shengyu and plunged the Immemorial Hero’s Sword into him, piercing through his True God level martial power with his rank eight Half-God level cultivation.
