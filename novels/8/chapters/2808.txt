Chapter 2808 - Two Heavenly Beloved Geniuses

“Senior, you’re planning to help me?”

Chu Feng was surprised. He didn’t know how the Ancient Era’s Serpent Clan’s Clan Chief would be able to help him, nor did he know why he would want to help him.

After all, he was clearly not acquaintanced with the Ancient Era’s Serpent Clan.

“I can use a spirit formation to momentarily increase your cultivation from rank four True Immortal to rank five True Immortal. Furthermore, this will last for an entire hour.”

“During the hour when this spirit formation is in effect, your strength will be that of an actual rank five True Immortal. Furthermore, you are able to use all of the abilities that you possess.”

“Merely, when setting up this spirit formation, you will have to endure a bit of pain. Are you willing to do this?” The Ancient Era’s Serpent Clan’s Clan Chief asked.

“Senior is neither a relative nor a friend of mine. Yet you are willing to help me like this. This junior would naturally be willing.”

“Merely, if my cultivation is to be increased to rank five True Immortal, I wonder if this Han Yu would still dare to fight against me?” Chu Feng turned his gaze to Han Yu.

“Humph. Interesting. How could I, Han Yu, possibly fear you?” Han Yu smiled coldly, and disdain filled his eyes.

It was as if he hadn’t placed Chu Feng in his eyes from the very beginning.

“If you don’t have any objection to this either, I will be setting up the spirit formation now,” the Ancient Era’s Serpent Clan’s Clan Chief said to Han Yu.

“What could I possibly do even if I do object to this? Your Ancient Era’s Serpent Clan possesses quite a deep relationship with this Chu Feng to begin with. Was there even a need for me to say this?”

“However, it doesn’t matter to me if you are to help him. It will be the perfect opportunity for me to teach this Chu Feng that even if his cultivation is to increase to that of a rank five True Immortal, he will not be able to defeat me, Han Yu.”

“The Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm’s Demon-level Geniuses List is not that easy to enter. I, Han Yu, have relied on my own capabilities to enter the Demon-level Geniuses List,” Han Yu said.

“Very well. Since that’s the case, little friend Chu Feng, please swallow this medicinal pellet,” the Ancient Era’s Serpent Clan’s Clan Chief handed Chu Feng a medicinal pellet.

After receiving the medicinal pellet, Chu Feng inspected it carefully. He discovered that this was not an ordinary medicinal pellet. Rather, it was a sort of spirit formation.

As Chu Feng was a Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, he was able to imagine the effect of that medicinal pellet.

It could be said that the spirit formation contained within that medicinal pellet would be the most crucial matter to increasing Chu Feng’s cultivation to rank five True Immortal temporarily.

After observing the medicinal pellet, Chu Feng opened his mouth and tossed the medicinal pellet in.

Chu Feng felt that if the Ancient Era’s Serpent Clan’s Clan Chief had wanted to cause him harm, he would’ve already been dead. Thus, he felt that the Ancient Era’s Serpent Clan’s Clan Chief was sincerely trying to help him.

“Buzz~~~”

After the medicinal pellet entered his mouth, it immediately turned into a spirit formation that started to revolve within Chu Feng’s body.

“Little friend Chu Feng, enter the core of this spirit formation.”

The Ancient Era’s Serpent Clan’s Clan Chief had set up a spirit formation.

Chu Feng entered the core of the spirit formation as per the Ancient Era’s Serpent Clan’s Clan Chief’s instructions. Upon doing so, he immediately felt dizzy as his vision blurred and pain emerged from all over his body.

At the same time, the spirit formation within his body began to violently invade Chu Feng’s flesh and soul.

Chu Feng was not flustered. Instead, he hurriedly sat down and allowed the spirit formation within his body to invade his flesh and soul.

Soon, the invasion stopped.

Both the spirit formation outside and the spirit formation inside Chu Feng’s body had disappeared.

However, Chu Feng’s aura had increased from rank four True Immortal to rank five True Immortal.

“Thank you senior,” Chu Feng stood up and thanked the Ancient Era’s Serpent Clan’s Clan Chief.

“Little friend Chu Feng, remember this. This spirit formation is only able to last for an hour. Thus, you must make the most of your time,” the Ancient Era’s Serpent Clan’s Clan Chief said.

After saying those words, the Ancient Era’s Serpent Clan’s Clan Chief began to walk backwards.

In that instant, the others present all began to move backwards. They were providing an open battlefield for Chu Feng and Han Yu.

“An hour?”

At this moment, Han Yu sneered. He said, “I will be able to make him crawl on the ground in merely half an incense stick’s worth of time.”

At that moment, Han Yu gave off a sensation of absolute confidence. He was extremely arrogant.

If everyone gave off an aura, then the aura that Han Yu was emitting right then was extremely powerful.

However, even though Han Yu was acting like this, Chu Feng’s expression remained unchanged. Although he did not act as arrogantly as Han Yu, he did not appear inferior in the slightest compared to Han Yu when standing next to him.

“Indeed, someone will be crawling on the ground in an hour’s time. However, as for whether or not it will be me, Chu Feng, will have to depend on whether or not you, Han Yu, possess the capability to do so.”

As Chu Feng spoke, he took out his Divine Dragon’s Blood Ruler and held it in his hand. At the same time, his Divine level Lightning Mark appeared on his forehead.

After the dazzling Divine level Lightning Mark appeared on his forehead, Chu Feng’s aura increased from rank five True Immortal to rank six True Immortal.

“That is the Divine level Lightning Mark? Amazing.”

It was the first time that many of the people present had ever witnessed Chu Feng’s Divine level Lightning Mark. One by one, they revealed expressions of admiration and surprise.

After all, that was the highest level Self-Punishing Mysterious Technique that Heavenly Bloodline possessors could grasp. It was a legendary Self-Punishing Mysterious Technique.

The Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique was not only legendary in terms of rarity, it was also legendary in terms of difficulty to learn.

This was especially true at that moment because Chu Feng’s Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique had given rise to an abnormal sign. The surging lightning clouds caused by the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique were truly astonishing.

That was the reason why the crowd exclaimed in admiration.

“Rumble~~~”

Right at that moment, a loud sound suddenly exploded in the sky.

A violent tornado actually appeared in the sky covered by lightning and clouds. That tornado covered an immensely vast area. It was spreading in a manner seemingly capable of sweeping away everything in its path. It began to collide with the clouds. Both the tornado and the clouds currently each covered half of the sky.

At that moment, the crowd noticed that wind was engulfing Han Yu’s body. His eyes had even turned white. Wind was wreaking havoc within his eyes.

At that moment, Han Yu’s aura had also increased. From a cultivation of rank six True Immortal, it had increased to rank seven True Immortal.

Seeing such a Han Yu, the crowd started to sing praises in their hearts. Regardless of what sort of character Han Yu possessed, it remained that his strength was undoubtedly strong.

There were a lot of Divine Bodies in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. However, their Divine Power would generally be sealed after they reached the True Immortal Realm.

Those that were capable of regaining the power of their Divine Power were all individuals deemed to be extremely talented.

However, even among those very talented individuals, only an extremely few among them were capable of increasing their cultivation by a entire level after using their Divine Power. It could even be said that one such individual would not be found even among hundreds of millions of people.

This went to show how powerful Han Yu was.

His reputation as a demon-level genius was most definitely well-deserved.

“Chu Feng, your Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique is indeed powerful. However, my Divine Power is also not an ordinary Divine Power. It is most definitely not inferior to your Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique.”

“Thus, if this is all you’re capable of, you will not be able to contend against me. You should unleash your heaven-defying secret skills. Let me witness your strongest abilities,” Han Yu said to Chu Feng.

Perhaps Han Yu had heard the praises from the crowd, but he was currently immensely pleased with himself. It was as if victory was within his grasp, and the victor of the battle had already been determined. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

After Han Yu said those words, the crowd cast their gazes to Chu Feng again.

Deep anticipation appeared within their eyes.

While Han Yu had said those words purely to display his confidence, the people present wanted to witness Chu Feng’s heaven-defying secret skills from the bottoms of their hearts.

“Buzz~~~”

“Buzz~~~”

Right at that moment, with a thought from Chu Feng, golden light started to shine brightly in the sky.

A golden-bright and dazzling war axe and war sword appeared simultaneously.

They were the Ancient Era’s War Axe and the Ancient Era’s War Sword.

“What powerful secret skills!!!”

Upon seeing the enormous axe and the enormous sword floating in the sky, the eyes of the people from the younger generations, and even the people from the older generations, all started shining.

In addition to the fact that the Ancient Era’s War Sword’s aura was capable of surmounting one level of cultivation, the two weapons, although being secret skills, were emitting extremely domineering, overwhelming and arrogant auras.

It was as if they were the rulers of that place, looking down upon everything.

At that moment, the crowd started to anticipate the confrontation between Chu Feng and Han Yu even more.

They were certain that Chu Feng and Han Yu were most definitely demon-level geniuses, heavenly-beloved geniuses.

It was truly unknown who would be the victor of their battle.
