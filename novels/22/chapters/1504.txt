Chapter 1505: Magical beast (1)

Translator: 549690339

The Woman in White was Song Wei, the one that Xia ruofei had been worried about.

The moment he saw Song Wei, Xia ruofei’s tensed heart relaxed. He took a few steps forward and stood in front of Song Wei.

“Song Wei, I finally found you!” Xia ruofei said. You don’t know how worried I was for you just now!”

Song Wei’s face was pale. She stared at Xia ruofei and said,””Why are you doing this to me?”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment and said,””Um ... I’m sorry, Song Wei ... I didn’t know that the altar would change like that. I was caught off guard and fell in here. I didn’t mean to leave you behind ... Well ... Let’s not talk about this, let’s talk about you! How did you get here? What happened outside just now?”

Facing Xia ruofei’s question, Song Wei’s expression remained cold.

“I’m not talking about that!”She said.

“Ah?” Xia ruofei looked at Song Wei in confusion. Under the flickering light of the Zippo, he couldn’t see clearly. He only felt that Song Wei’s face was extremely pale and she must have been frightened.

Song Wei stared into Xia ruofei’s eyes and asked,””I’m asking ... Why did you shoot me?”

Xia ruofei was stunned. Could it be ...

He thought of a possibility. When he was trapped in the illusion array just now, he kept shooting at the illusionary enemies, and in reality, he also found the bullet shells on the ground, which meant that he was actually shooting randomly on the spot.

As for Song Wei, she was so close to the place where he was trapped earlier. There was a high possibility that she would be hit by a stray bullet in the dark.

Xia ruofei panicked and quickly asked,””You ... You’re injured? Where are you hurt? Are you okay?”

At this moment, Song Wei let go of her hand that had been covering her waist. Xia ruofei immediately saw a shocking patch of red.

Xia ruofei’s expression changed. He quickly took off his backpack and took out the box containing the petals of the spirit Heart Flower without hesitation.

“Song Wei, don’t be afraid!” He said as he opened the box. I can definitely cure your injuries ...”

When Xia ruofei was opening the box, he glanced at Song Wei’s feet from the corner of his eye. Suddenly, he had an idea.

He picked up a petal with a pair of tweezers and said,””Don’t be angry with me. I didn’t mean to hurt you. I was trapped in an illusory formation just now. I met some enemies in the formation, so I shot you ... With our relationship, how could I deliberately shoot you?”

“That’s hard to say!”Song Wei snorted. Maybe you’ve met another Vixen?”

Xia ruofei laughed awkwardly and said,”how is that possible?” Don’t let your thoughts run wild, I’ll help you apply the medicine!”

After he finished speaking, he picked up a petal of the spirit Heart Flower and brought it close to Song Wei’s wound.

Song Wei’s eyes flickered as she gathered strength in her hands.

However, just as she was about to attack, Xia ruofei, who was bending over to apply medicine on her, suddenly took a wrong step and placed a military dagger on Song Wei’s neck.

Song Wei’s expression changed. She looked aggrieved and scared as she said,”RUO Fei, you ... What are you doing?”

Xia ruofei’s lips curved up and he said,””You’re not Song Wei!”

“What nonsense are you talking about?” Song Wei’s eyes flickered.”You don’t even recognize me?”

“It seems that you still don’t understand the principle that the more you talk, the more likely you are to lose.” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I tested you a little and you really gave yourself away!”

“I don’t understand what you’re saying ...” Song Wei said.

“Alright! I’m not even in a relationship with Song Wei, how could she say those things!” Xia ruofei said,”are you still going to continue acting? Speak! Who are you?”

When Song Wei heard this, the aggrieved look on her face disappeared. She sneered and said,”I didn’t expect you to be so vigilant! I’m just curious, when did you start to be suspicious?” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“It’s not good to be too curious!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”but since you want to know, I’ll tell you! Song Wei is just an ordinary weak girl. If she was hit by a stray bullet, even if she didn’t fall to the ground, she wouldn’t be able to stand as steadily as you did just now. Her legs didn’t even tremble. Even a well – trained Special Forces soldier wouldn’t be able to do that!”

After ‘Song Wei’ heard Xia ruofei’s words, she revealed a ferocious expression and said,””So what if you saw through me? Since you dare to come in, don’t even think about leaving alive!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she quickly retreated, and at the same time, a wisp of yellow smoke came out of her body.

Xia ruofei looked calm and composed, but he was already on full alert. The moment “Song Wei” moved, he immediately followed her like a shadow. At the same time, the dagger in his hand cut through her neck without hesitation.

“Song Wei” groaned and rolled on the ground, turning into a small yellow beast. It looked like a weasel, but it had three tails.

There was a wound on the little yellow beast’s body. Xia ruofei had just made a cut, but it was not on the fatal neck. It seemed that when it transformed into a human, it had deliberately avoided the fatal part.
