2321 The Morde Organization Part When song Qiming was almost done with his treatment and Xia ruofei was free, he would naturally find a way to find the financial backer.

Xia ruofei had left alone, so Qian guiyou and the others couldn’t have disappeared.

In fact, they had all been sent into the spirit map space by Xia ruofei.

He did this because he had no intention of letting these people out.

The hands of these professional mercenaries were all stained with blood. Xia ruofei had already confirmed this during the interrogation. It could be said that each of the five of them deserved to die. It wouldn’t be too much to execute them a hundred times.

Considering that the shortage of labor in the space was getting worse, Xia ruofei followed the principle of recycling and directly extracted them into the spirit map space.

These people were all bound by Xia ruofei’s Silver needles. When he was collecting them, he released a little bit of spiritual power and put them in a daze. In this state, they did not know how to resist. Xia ruofei easily collected all five of them in one breath.

Xia ruofei used the power of space to set up a cage in the mountain and sea realm of the spirit map world. He threw the five people in and left them alone.

Xia ruofei was prepared to go into the medium to train them when he was free later.

Xia ruofei had no qualms about using the free labor in the realm.

As for safety, there was even less to worry about.

Unless Xia ruofei died and the spirit map became ownerless again, even Bai Qingqing, who had a thorough understanding of the rules of space, would not be able to escape from the small space of the spirit map world without Xia ruofei’s permission, let alone ordinary people like Qian guiyou and the others.

In addition, when Xia ruofei was not in the space, Xia Qing could also use a certain amount of spatial power. Although this level of spatial power was far inferior to the spatial power that Xia ruofei controlled, whether in quality or quantity, it was more than enough to deal with ordinary people in the space.

Not to mention only five people, even if there were fifty or five hundred, Xia Qing could control them all with a single thought.

Even if they took advantage of Xia Qing’s inattentiveness and launched a sneak attack on him, there was no need to worry.

Before putting them into the spatial space, Xia ruofei had stored all their weapons in an independent space in the spirit map world that he had specially opened up. Without Xia ruofei’s permission, even Xia Qing could not get those weapons.

As a high – Level spiritual puppet, Xia Qing’s body was also very strong. Even if a sneak attack was successful, it was impossible for a few ordinary people, who were not even at refined Qi Level 1, to cause him any harm.

Hence, Xia ruofei had considered all the possible problems before making the final decision.

……

After leaving the residential area, Xia ruofei walked straight to his car.

On the way, he even made a detour to a shopping mall and changed his clothes and appearance in the washroom.

After collecting his car, Xia ruofei drove back to the main hospital.

Fang Liyun, Song Wei, song Qiming’s Secretary, Guangzhi Cao, and the others were all in the lobby outside the ICU.

Xia ruofei did not mention the mord organization to them because he knew that this kind of overseas mercenary organization was not something that the special police arranged by the province could deal with. If he told them, it would only make them more uneasy.

Xia ruofei chatted with Fang Liyun and the rest for a while before he went to the intensive care unit to check on song Qiming’s condition. He found that his vital signs were relatively stable.

Besides, Xia ruofei also used his spiritual power to penetrate the outer area of song Qiming’s consciousness and checked it carefully.

The situation was almost as he had expected. Song Qiming had basically absorbed all the medicinal properties of the soup. However, the recovery of his sea of consciousness was only about 1%. If he only relied on the soup, song Qiming’s recovery would be an extremely long process. After all, the soup could only be taken once in seven days.

When Xia ruofei left the intensive care unit, Fang Liyun and the others immediately came to greet him.

He found that professor Chen, who was the chief surgeon for song Qiming’s head operation, was also there.

Due to song Qiming’s special status, professor Chen would come over to check on the situation after finishing his work. After all, such a high – ranking leader was lying in the intensive care unit. Although the General Hospital could not do much, they at least had to show that they attached great importance to him.

“Ruofei, how’s Qiming?” Fang Liyun asked.

Xia ruofei smiled.”Aunty Fang, don’t worry. Uncle song’s condition has always been stable. It’s unlikely that his sadness will relapse.”

“When will he wake up?” Fang Liyun asked.

Just then, a voice came from behind Xia ruofei.””Junior Brother Xia, I knew you were still here!”

Xia ruofei turned around and saw that the person was his senior Ge Jun, whom he had acknowledged as a disciple on behalf of his master.

“Senior GE! You’re back!” Xia ruofei smiled and replied,”did everything go well today?”

He knew that Ge Jun must have gone to Min River to pay his respects to his non – existent master.

“Everything is going smoothly!” Ge Jun smiled and said,”of course, I’m just asking for peace of mind! I don’t know if master will be able to receive this kind of thought ...”

“You definitely can!” Xia ruofei smiled.

Then, Xia ruofei said to Fang Liyun and the others,””Aunt Fang, Song Wei, let me introduce you. This is Ge Jun, senior GE! His senior brother was very accomplished in Chinese medicine and was a leading figure in China’s Chinese medicine field. He usually provided health care services to the leaders in Beijing. Senior GE will also participate in uncle song’s treatment, so you can rest assured! Uncle song will definitely be fine!”

Ge Jun’s name was quite well – known. At least, Fang Liyun and Song Wei had heard of him before. Therefore, Fang Liyun was pleasantly surprised when she heard this and said, “That’s great! Dr. GE, I’ll have to trouble you with Qiming’s matter!”

Fang Liyun’s mind was all on song Qiming, so she did not notice that Xia ruofei’s way of addressing Ge Jun was a little strange.

However, professor Chen was stunned.

He didn’t even consider that Xia ruofei was introducing them to each other. He couldn’t help but exclaim,””Uncle GE, you ... You and Mr. Xia ...”

Ge Jun smiled and said,”Oh!” Little Chen! Yesterday, I talked to Junior Brother Xia and found out that we are from the same sect in Chinese medicine. In terms of seniority, Junior Brother Xia and I are of the same generation. I’m a few years older than you, so I’m naturally your senior brother. ”

Professor Chen was dumbfounded.

This works too?

In that case, in terms of seniority, this young man in front of him was his elder?

Professor Chen was also from a family of Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners. Naturally, he knew that Traditional Chinese Medicine was very particular about inheritance. Moreover, this inheritance was recognized by the country.

To be qualified to practice Chinese medicine, other than going through the country’s full – time Chinese medicine education and passing the examination, there was another way to obtain the qualification, and that was to pass on Chinese medicine.

Even if you didn’t even attend medical school for a day, as long as you were indeed a master and disciple in Chinese medicine, and your inheritance was recognized by the industry, you could still obtain a medical qualification certificate.

Xia ruofei noticed professor Chen as well. He was amused.

“Professor Chen,” he said quickly,”brother GE and I are talking about the succession of Chinese medicine. We should discuss it separately.”

Professor Chen couldn’t help but smile bitterly. It was precisely because this was the seniority of Chinese medicine that he felt that it was a bit of a scam! Although he studied Western medicine, he was also a child of a Chinese medicine family. Strictly speaking, he had to abide by this kind of inheritance.

Ge Jun and his father were of the same generation, which meant that Xia ruofei was of the same generation as his father.

However, professor Chen could not bring himself to call Xia ruofei ‘uncle’.

He sneaked a glance at Ge Jun and saw that Ge Jun did not object. He heaved a sigh of relief and nodded,””Oh ... I see ...”Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com
