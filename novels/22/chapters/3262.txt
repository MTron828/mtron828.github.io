This included the oxygen supply modules. The two batches of oxygen supply modules added up to an average of 400 per person, which was enough to sustain breathing for 2000 to 3000 hours.

The boxes of the oxygen supply modules were stacked together and did not take up too much space, so there was enough storage space for everyone. Everyone in the exploration team kept the oxygen supply modules properly, including Ling Qingxue.

After all the equipment and supplies were distributed, Xia ruofei said to Li Yifu,””Foster husband, there’s some cleaning up work here in the United States. Take your time to deal with it. We’ll talk about it when you’re done.”

Li Yifu knew what Xia ruofei meant was that he did not need to rush back to Peach Blossom Island. However, he could not say it out loud since Chen Nanfeng and the others were present.

“Yes!” He quickly replied. I understand!”

This time, Xia ruofei definitely could not send Li Yifu to Paradise Island. Besides, Li Yifu had returned to the United States by plane and entered the country through normal procedures. It was best to have an exit record when he returned. Otherwise, if he returned through normal channels, he would not be able to explain clearly how he came back from overseas without any exit procedures.

Li Yifu continued.”Grand uncle – Master, the journey to the moon is long and full of unknown dangers. You must take care of yourself and pay attention to your safety!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Don’t worry about me. Just take care of everything at home. I’ll be careful!”

“Please rest assured, grand uncle – Master!” Li Yifu quickly replied. There are disciples at home, so you don’t have to worry about anything!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””Then I’ll take my leave first!”

“Have a safe journey, martial granduncle!” Li Yifu said respectfully.

He sent Xia ruofei and the others to the courtyard and watched as they boarded the black Phoenix flying ship and disappeared into the horizon. There was still a trace of worry on his face that could not be erased.

After all, Xia ruofei was going to the moon, which was hundreds of thousands of miles away. Even if Li Yifu had great confidence in Xia ruofei’s abilities, he could not help but be worried. It was the moon, which did not even have air and had an extremely harsh natural environment! The power of nature was always revered by people. In that lonely land of death, if there was any danger, there was not much difference between an Aurous core stage cultivator and an ordinary person.

However, Xia ruofei was an elder in his sect. No matter how worried he was, he could only bury it in his heart. He could not persuade Xia ruofei not to go to the moon.

Li Yifu valued seniority the most.

He looked at the sky where the black Phoenix flying ship had long disappeared and let out a long sigh. He turned around and locked the warehouse door. This matter was extremely confidential. After the items were transported, he had sent all the workers away. He had to complete all the cleaning work himself and could not let others do it.

……

Xia ruofei controlled the black Phoenix flying ship and spent one to two hours before the group crossed the ocean and returned to Huaxia.

However, they did not go to Beijing this time. Instead, they went to a Holiday Manor in Nanhai province.

This was one of the properties of the first heaven society in the secular world. The first heaven society had already cleared the entire Manor in advance, and all the staff members were on leave. Only a few Qi condensation disciples transferred from the sect were left to serve everyone. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

On the way back, everyone had already discussed and agreed that the expedition team would set off to the moon in three days.

The reason why he left a three – day buffer time was that he hoped that everyone could use the three days to rest and adjust to their best condition. On the other hand, they were going to the moon. It was an unprecedented feat. Therefore, everyone had to make some preparations and replenish their supplies.

Xia ruofei also agreed to make full preparations. After all, even he was not confident in this trip. If they left in a hurry, it would be even more dangerous.

In these three days, the first heaven sect, the surging waves sect, and the soaring Flower Valley had all made a lot of preparations for the disciples who were about to go to the moon.

This included some life – saving magical treasures, talismans, spare flying swords, various practical magical treasures, spirit stones, and so on. There were even a lot of spirit crystals and origin crystals. The three sects were all top – tier sects in the cultivation world and were very rich. For this trip to the moon, they had also taken out their most precious treasures and provided them to the disciples who were joining the expedition team as much as possible to increase their ability to deal with risks.

In addition, the first heaven society, as the host, had also organized people to transport a large amount of food, drinking water, and other living supplies, filling up the storage magical equipment of every member of the exploration team.

Of course, apart from Xia ruofei’s spirit map space, the mountain and sea realm was an independent world. No matter how many resources there were, they could only occupy an unremarkable corner and could not fill it up.

Among the food, there were quite a few compressed biscuits and other similar compressed food. These were the last survival resources. After all, compressed food took up a small space, but it could provide sufficient energy. A small piece could sustain the energy required by an ordinary person for half a day. Cultivators had a relatively small need for food. If they were really trapped in a dangerous place and could not leave, these compressed food could greatly increase the survival time of the cultivators.

In fact, Xia ruofei did not really need these things.

This was because his spirit map space had a large amount of supplies stored in it. This was a normal operation for him. Ever since he had the spirit map space, he had gotten used to storing enough living supplies in the spirit map space so that he could use them at any time.

This was the so – called “when there’s surplus food in the family, one doesn’t have to panic.”

In addition, the spirit map space could even be self – sufficient. His hundreds of free laborers worked hard to cultivate the land of the mountain sea realm every day under Xia Qing’s supervision. In addition to various Chinese medicinal herbs, they also planted high – Quality rice.

It could be said that even if he was trapped in a certain place, Xia ruofei could still rely on the resources of the spirit map space to obtain an endless supply of food. At least, he could guarantee that he would not starve to death.

Of course, in order not to arouse suspicion, Xia ruofei did the same as everyone else. He stored the supplies that the first heaven society had provided him with into the spirit map space.

Besides, Xia ruofei had also secretly transferred some of his cultivation resources, mainly spiritual crystals and origin crystals, to Ling Qingxue so that she could keep them in her storage ring.

Naturally, this was also a precautionary measure in case the two of them were separated by force majeure.

With those resources and the cultivation resources that Xia ruofei had provided, even if Ling Qingxue was trapped alone, she could still rely on these resources to survive.

This was the worst case scenario and Xia ruofei had to consider it. Under normal circumstances, Xia ruofei would definitely avoid being separated from Ling Qingxue.

Three days passed by in a flash, and it was soon the day of departure.

The night sky was filled with stars and the bright moon hung in the sky, giving off a hazy Halo.

A group of people stood in a small square in the holiday villa, looking up at the moon in the sky. This would be their destination for the next few days.

The black – armored flying ship hovered a few meters above the small square.

Xia ruofei and the rest of the group stood below the black Phoenix flying ship. Opposite them were Chen Nanfeng, Mu Sheng, and Liu Mansha.

“Sect leader Chen, sect leader mu, Valley master Liu,” Xia ruofei said with a smile.”We’ll part ways here!”

“I’m fine!” Chen Nanfeng nodded solemnly.”We wish you all a smooth journey!”

Then, he looked at Chen Xuan and said,””Xuan ‘er, you might face unpredictable dangers on this trip. I hope you can cooperate with me sincerely. I’ll wait for your good news at home!”

“Don’t worry, father!”Chen Xuan nodded. I will be careful!”

On the other side, Mu Sheng and Liu Mansha were also giving instructions to their own disciples. Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue were holding hands and standing at the side. For the sake of safety, Xia ruofei had already sent Song Wei to peach source Island in advance, so no one was sending them off tonight.

After a long farewell, Xia ruofei and the rest of the nine people jumped onto the flying boat.

The black Phoenix flying ship rose slowly, and a group of people stood by the ship’s side, waving goodbye to the three sect leaders on the ground.

Following that, the black – Phoenix flying ship suddenly accelerated, turning into a small black dot in the blink of an eye before disappearing into the night sky.
