“These shares look like they’re worth about three billion US dollars,” elder song said with a smile. “Some intangible assets might even be worth more, and there’s still room for growth in the future. However, choosing the shares also means choosing a lot of trouble. ”

Elder song paused for a moment, took a sip of water, and continued,””For a big family like the Liu family, their internal relationships are very complicated. Their company’s equity structure is also very complicated. If you take 40% of it, it will affect the interests of too many people. Also, you only have the shares. Do you have the energy to get involved in the actual management?”

“I’m afraid that’s not realistic. ” Xia ruofei said.

“That’s for sure. Even if you send a professional team to settle in, it will be difficult to form an effective management.” Elder song said,”although the company is large, it is still a family business in essence. The management is made up of the backbone of the Liu family. I can tell you with certainty that if you accept these shares, it may not take more than a year for your shares to become worthless. They will only leave behind a shell company. If they are a little black – hearted, they will even leave you with a huge debt!”

“It’s so dark?” Xia ruofei was speechless.

“You should never underestimate the distortion of human nature in the face of benefits.” Elder song said,”as I said just now, the Liu family’s company has a very complicated equity structure. They also have a large number of companies under their actual control. On the surface, they have nothing to do with the Liu family’s family group, but they can transfer high – Quality assets at any time. By then, you will only be left with a mess!”

“I roughly understand.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”actually, I don’t want any shares. I’m not interested in the Liu family’s business.”

Even if Liu Qunfeng did not say it, Xia ruofei was not prepared to use these shares as the medical fee. He was a person who was afraid of trouble. As elder song said, choosing the shares meant choosing a lot of trouble.

Perhaps the trouble that Xia ruofei could think of was not as thorough as elder song’s analysis. However, just the things that he could think of were already giving him a headache.

“As for the three billion dollars in cash, I’m sure you won’t be too interested in it,” said elder song with a smile.

“Oh? Why did you make such a judgment?” Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”that’s three billion US dollars! If I take it, it’ll be enough for me to squander for a few lifetimes!”

Elder song laughed and said,”you’re testing me, kid ... Ruofei, based on my understanding of you, you don’t have a strong desire for money. If it’s just financial freedom, your assets now are more than enough. I believe that you won’t be blinded by money.”

Then, he changed the topic and said,””Of course, no one would think that the money is too little. It’s a waste not to take the money that’s given to us. At least, it’s much more reliable than choosing the 40% shares.”

“You’re right. To be honest, when I heard elder Liu’s proposal, I was a little tempted. ” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“But even with house Liu’s wealth, it’s almost impossible to come up with three billion US dollars.” Elder song said,”in fact, other than those super – Large companies, there are almost no other companies with such a large cash flow. Therefore, even if you chose this plan, it was basically impossible to get the money in one go. It’s very likely that they’ll propose a plan to pay in installments or cash in through some assets. In short, it’ll be a lot of trouble. ”

“So ...” Xia ruofei said,”you’re suggesting that I take a portion of the cash and the green cloud Island?”

“Of the three proposals we have, this is undoubtedly the most suitable one for you.” Elder song said,”and based on my understanding of old Liu, if there is a measure for these three plans in his mind, I think he would want you to choose the first plan the most, and the second would be the 40% shares, and the last would be the green cloud Island plus cash plan!”

“Oh?” Xia ruofei’s interest was piqued. He smiled and said,”I thought you would give the shares the highest priority! I also think that elder Liu doesn’t want me to choose the equity the most! And ... Liu Qunfeng even came to me in private, hoping that I wouldn’t choose the shares ...”

“Hmph Hmph!” Elder song laughed coldly and said,”Liu Qunfeng is still a little lacking compared to his father. At least on this matter, he is a little short – sighted.”

“So ... This blue cloud Island is not simple!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I really don’t know anything about this. Can you introduce us to each other?” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Although the Liu family’s development of blue cloud Island is a secret, it’s not a secret at all to us, Song Jia.” Elder song said,”green cloud Island is actually not in China, but an Island in the South Pacific Ocean. Legally, it belongs to the state of Cornelius. However, through some political operations, the Liu family has actually taken control of this Island and has been recognized by the state of Cornelius.”

“Hmm, so ... They’ve spent a lot of effort on this Island.” Xia ruofei said.
