Chapter 1556: The poor man who took over the situation (1)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei looked at fatty Luo, who was rubbing his hands in excitement, and said to Yu mingdong,””President Yu, since we’re done here, let’s go back?”

Yu mingdong looked at the raw stone he had already sold to fatty Luo with some reluctance and asked,””President Luo, you ... Are you going to open this material on the spot?”

Fatty Luo waved his hand and said,”of course!” Today, this master’s rate of stone cutting has increased greatly, and that little brother is a gem in front of me. Of course, I have to borrow his luck!”

Yu mingdong heard this and said to Xia ruofei,””Mr. Xia, why don’t we ... Go back after we’re done watching President Luo cut the stone?”

Although this raw stone had been sold, Yu mingdong had always been a little conflicted in his heart. If he didn’t see the stone unraveled with his own eyes, he probably wouldn’t be able to sleep well tonight.

Xia ruofei was in a hurry to go back. On one hand, he knew that Xia Qing had prepared the medicine in the medium and he wanted Song Wei to take it as soon as possible. On the other hand, he knew very well that once this piece of material was completely opened, he would definitely lose the bet, and there was nothing to see at all.

Not to mention that fatty Luo had spent a sky – High price of 53 million to buy it, even if Yu mingdong had spent more than 20 million to buy it before, it would definitely have been a loss.

However, the guest should suit the host. Xia ruofei was considered Yu mingdong’s guest. Since Yu mingdong had said so, and it would not take long to cut a raw stone, Xia ruofei nodded in agreement. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Fatty Luo said excitedly,”then I’ll have to trouble you, master!” Just rub from the position just now!”

The master of cutting stones was only responsible for doing the work, and did not care who the owner of the raw stone was.

He nodded when he heard that. Just as he was about to turn on the power of the grinding turbine, Yu mingdong suddenly shouted,””Master, please wait a moment ...”

At this time, Shi Lei had already walked in from outside. Yu mingdong took two red packets from his hands, which were obviously prepared just now. He walked to the stone cutter and stuffed them into his hands.

Yu mingdong said,”master, you’ve worked hard today. This is a little gift from Mr. Xia and me. Take it and buy some cigarettes!”

This was also an unwritten rule in this line of work. If the price of the raw stone Rose, the owner would definitely give a red envelope to the master of cutting the stone, and it was also a good fortune.

Xia ruofei was not clear about this rule, so Yu mingdong simply did it on his behalf.

The stonecutter didn’t refuse. He took the red packets and pinched them slightly. He knew that each red packet was at least 10000 Yuan. He immediately smiled and said,”Thank you, boss! Thank you, boss!”

Xia ruofei looked at the stonecutter as he kept the red packet. He said to Yu mingdong in a low voice,””How can we let President Yu pay for this? How much did the red packet carry? I’ll transfer it to you later!”

Yu mingdong pretended to be angry.”Mr. Xia, you reduced my price by three million Yuan for that Violet Jade just now. You’re such a good friend. What’s wrong with me giving you a small red packet?” Do you need to be so formal? If you say such things again, then you’re not treating me as a friend!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”good, good, good!” Then I won’t regard you as an outsider ... President Yu, let’s watch the stone cut!”

Yu mingdong then revealed a smile and said,””Yes, yes, yes, let’s see how the stone is cut!”

Fatty Luo watched eagerly as the stonecutter turned on the power and cut the raw material again, fantasizing that this material would be worth sixty to seventy million Yuan, or even seventy to eighty million Yuan of Jade.

With this big piece of material, the shortage of raw materials in the factory would be greatly alleviated ... Fatty Luo thought happily.

Just as he was daydreaming, he suddenly heard exclamations from the surrounding Jade merchants.

Fatty Luo came back to his senses and realized that the stonecutter had already stopped.

“What’s wrong?” Fatty Luo chuckled and asked,”it can’t be the king’s Green, right? Why are you all so surprised?”

Everyone looked at fatty Luo with strange expressions, and the scene was very quiet.

Yu mingdong’s mouth was so wide open that he forgot to close it.

Fatty Luo saw that the situation was a little off and suddenly looked at the raw stone.

At first glance, fatty Luo’s eyes suddenly widened as if he had seen a ghost, and his face turned pale.

The green jadeite on the material was getting lighter and lighter, and the place where it was rubbed had mixed jadeite and stone.

The stone – cutting master polished the newly – made cut in the direction of the window opened by the organizer. The best result was that the Jade exposed on both sides was connected, and the quality of the Jade was very high. This way, it would be worth at least 70 to 80 million Yuan. After all, this piece of material was too big.

In the worst case, there would be a small fault in the middle of the two cuts, or the quality of the Jade would drop slightly. Even in this case, it was still a profit to buy it for 53 million Yuan. It was just a matter of how much it would cost.

However, the situation was far from optimistic. In fact, it was so bad that it was beyond everyone’s expectations, except for Xia ruofei.

It had only been six or seven minutes since the master started cutting the stone again. He had only polished less than ten centimeters from the position where he had stopped to the old cut, and the situation had taken a sharp turn for the worse. The mixed – colored jade was basically a waste. Even if it took a lot of effort to take it out, it would still be very small pieces of jade, which could probably only be made into small rings or pendants.

Moreover, the quality of the Jade was so bad that it would only be a low – end product worth a few hundred Yuan.
