Chapter 1412: If you don’t leave me, I’ll definitely ... (2)

Translator: 549690339

He said,”I know that sister ran will definitely not leave me and the company behind!” That’s why I can’t treat sister ran badly! The million Yuan annual salary was set! When you first joined the company, the company didn’t have much money. Now that we’re making money, we’ll definitely raise your salary, so don’t reject it!”

Feng Jing could tell that Xia ruofei sincerely wanted to give her better treatment, and her heart was filled with warmth.

She gently nodded and said,”alright!” I’ll go back and make some changes to the salary standard for M9!”

Xia ruofei said happily,”that’s right!” I have no objections to the three proposals you came up with, except for the M9’s salary. You have to give me some face for that, right?”

“This isn’t child’s play ...” Feng Rao didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.”Alright, alright, didn’t I already agree to it?”

Feng Rao’s tone was a little doting, and Xia ruofei’s heart couldn’t help but flutter. He couldn’t help but look up at her and see a faint blush on her delicate face. Her delicate skin made her even more attractive, and Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be in a daze.

Feng Rao felt Xia ruofei’s gaze on her and her heart was racing. She quickly stood up and said,””Ruofei, I’ll go back and revise the plan!”

Xia ruofei also came back to his senses. He stood up and said,””Alright! “Sister che, since we’ve decided to implement these plans, there are some things that we have to do first, especially the first appointment of personnel. This concerns everyone’s immediate interests, so we must strictly follow the standards. The staff in human resources will have to work harder these few days. If necessary, make them work overtime!”

“I understand!” Feng Jing smiled.”I’ll personally follow up on the personnel allocation. I won’t allow any favoritism or fraud.”

“I have absolute confidence in you. With your words, I can rest easy!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”by the way, our company’s Annual Meeting is coming up in a few days. I’ve put forward a few changes to the proposal that the administrative department sent over last time. Tell them to change it quickly. I still want to take a look.”

“Good! I’ll get Liu Qian to pass down the message. ” Feng Rao said with a smile.

Xia ruofei also took the company’s first formal Annual Meeting very seriously. This was the first time he took the initiative to ask for a review of the annual meeting plan.

Hence, the administration naturally paid more attention to it. They had specially pulled out a team to handle the annual meeting and had even formulated a rather complete plan for Xia ruofei.

However, to Xia ruofei, their thinking was still not broad enough, especially in some key aspects, which seemed a little petty. So, he wrote down a few hundred words on the plan and then typed it back.

Xia ruofei personally sent Feng Jing to the door of her office and treated her well.

Back in his office, Xia ruofei leaned back in his office chair and heaved a long sigh.

This year was a year of leap – forward development for paradise Corporation. It could be said that through the accumulation of the previous year’s half a year, the company’s performance this year had also ushered in a huge explosion. At the same time, it had also laid a more solid foundation.

It could be imagined that the company’s business would also show explosive growth next year.

At such a critical juncture, Feng Jing’s three plans were timely and necessary.

Xia ruofei believed that as the headquarters moved to the city center and the three proposals were implemented one by one, the rise of paradise Corporation would be unstoppable.

He closed his eyes and rested for a while. Then, he heard a soft knock on the door.

Xia ruofei rubbed his eyes and sat up straight.””Please enter!”

It was the marketing director, Xiao Qiang, who came in. He was very efficient. Xia ruofei decided to start the pre – Appointment conversation today, so the first thing she did when she returned to her office was to inform Xiao Qiang to report to her.

Xiao Qiang didn’t know why Xia ruofei was looking for him.

From what he could remember, this Big Boss didn’t really manage the company. Feng Jing was in charge of almost all the company matters.

So at this moment, Xiao Qiang’s heart was still a little nervous.

“President Xia, President Feng said that you were looking for me?” he asked carefully.

Xia ruofei had a gentle smile on his face. He pointed at the chair opposite his desk and said,””Director Xiao, please take a seat!”

He and Xiao Qiang didn’t have any personal relationship and today was a very formal conversation, so Xia ruofei naturally wouldn’t invite him to make tea.

“Thank you, director Xia!” Xiao Qiang quickly said and sat down on the chair opposite Xia ruofei. He looked at Xia ruofei seriously and pretended to listen.

“It’s been almost a year since director Xiao came to our company, right?”Xia ruofei smiled.

“Yes! Time really flies!” Xiao Qiang replied while guessing Xia ruofei’s purpose for looking for him.

“How does it feel in the company?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile as if he was having a casual conversation.

Xiao Qiang thought for a moment and then said,”President Xia, it feels great to work here! The company’s management is more humane, and it’s full of energy from top to bottom. The company’s development momentum is so good that everyone’s working very comfortably. ”

“Director Xiao, you’ve worked for the company for more than half a year. Your results are obvious to all.” Xia ruofei nodded and said.

“President Xia, you’re too kind. I’m just trying my best to do my job.” Xiao Qiang replied humbly.

His heart was pounding. Xia ruofei was so friendly, and the content of their conversation was to ask about his years of work, to understand his feelings, and even to praise him.

According to common sense, it was not a good thing to say something nice at this time.

Could it be that the company wants to kick me out? Xiao Qiang couldn’t help but feel a little panicked.

Logically speaking, the company’s development was so good that almost every department was short of people. They had to hold a recruitment once in a while, so it was unlikely that they would lay off staff at this time!

Just as Xiao Qiang was worrying about his personal gains and losses, Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”Director Xiao, if the company decides to give you more responsibilities, how do you feel? Are you competent enough for the more important positions?”

Xia ruofei’s words were like the sound of nature to Xiao Qiang. It was as if he had been hovering at the gates of hell a moment ago and had suddenly returned to the clouds. He was a little dizzy.

Fortunately, he had been a company executive for a long time, so he had a strong mental fortitude. He quickly reacted and said,””President Xia, I’ll follow the company’s arrangements!”

This could be considered a standard answer. Yingluo couldn’t possibly say that he was definitely up to the task, right? The leader would not like such an arrogant person.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”to be honest, the next step of the company’s structure adjustment is to absorb more middle – rank core members into the company’s leadership. CEO Feng recommended you to me. He thinks you’re more suitable for the position of como.”

The big stone in Xiao Qiang’s heart finally fell to the ground, and what replaced it was indescribable ecstasy.

Chief Marketing Officer. Although his scope of work was basically the same as the current marketing department, he was still the company’s management, unlike now when he was only a Department Director.

Moreover, this was the first step of the company’s organization. He was chosen for the first position in the company, instead of recruiting more experienced and capable people from outside. This also showed the trust the company’s leaders had in him.

The salary and benefits of this job at paradise Corporation were good, and the most important thing was that the company’s development prospects were too good. To be able to stay in the company and even be promoted to a more important leadership position, how could Xiao Qiang not be overjoyed?

“Thank you for your trust, President Xia and President Feng!” Xiao Qiang suppressed his excitement and quickly said,”I will definitely not let down the expectations of the company’s leaders. I will strive to achieve great results in my new position!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. Then, he said some words of encouragement and put forward some requirements for Xiao Qiang’s work in the future. At the same time, he emphasized confidentiality. Before the company’s Annual Meeting, this matter could only be known to himself and could not be spread. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Xiao Qiang’s attitude was also very proper. When Xia ruofei gave instructions, he quickly wrote it down and nodded in response from time to time.

Xia ruofei acknowledged Xiao Qiang’s ability and quality. Otherwise, he would not have agreed to Feng Jing’s suggestion so readily.

Therefore, he didn’t talk too much about the specific work. After a few simple instructions, he said,””Director Xiao, let’s stop here for today! Please call director pang from the finance department over. ”
