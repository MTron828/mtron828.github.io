Chapter 3456: Don’t believe in evil (2)

Naturally, immortal Shanhe had higher expectations for Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei opened his mouth with great difficulty and gasped for air. In fact, it was difficult to even breathe heavily under such a huge pressure. Many people would feel suffocated under such pressure as if they were seriously short of oxygen. It was very difficult to open their mouths and breathe quickly under the effect of such pressure. It also consumed a lot of physical strength.

The more physical strength he used, the more he would gasp for breath.

This formed a vicious cycle.

However, Xia ruofei’s condition was still good. His body was much stronger than the average golden core cultivator. In addition, his golden core was also different from the rest. His vital Qi was much stronger than that of the average golden core cultivator, so he was able to offset a lot of the pressure.

Although he was in a sorry state, he could still hold on.

It was just that the increase in pressure had suddenly become much greater, catching him off guard. Although Xi Jue had already mentally prepared himself, he still didn’t expect that the increase in pressure this time would be so much greater than the previous one hundred, two hundred, and three hundred layers.

Xia ruofei stood on the 400th step and tried his best to adjust his state of mind. He tried his best to stabilize his Yuan Qi that was on the verge of going berserk. In a situation where the pressure of mental power had already had a great influence on him, it was difficult to even operate the cultivation method without distractions, not to mention that the pressure was also making him feel extremely painful, which made the difficulty even greater.

However, Xia ruofei’s will had always been as strong as iron. He did not lack perseverance.

On the 400th step, he took a full five minutes to adjust himself before stabilizing his vital Qi. At the same time, he gradually straightened his back and stabilized his body.

Seeing this, Daoist priest Qing Xuan and immortal mountain river both heaved a sigh of relief.

The two of them had sharp eyes and could tell that Xia ruofei was unlikely to be thrown out on this step.

“Brother mountain river, your disciple didn’t let us down!” Daoist Qing Xuan stroked his beard and smiled.

“He’s still at a disadvantage because of his cultivation.” Immortal mountain river said calmly,”he is only in the intermediate stage of the Golden core realm and has just broken through. This stage is too difficult for him!”

Qing Xuan nodded in agreement and said,””Indeed. 1 remember that Xuanji Zi’s performance on the four – hundredth step was better than this child’s … However, Xuanji Zi was also one of the top geniuses in the xuanming Grotto – heaven, and he was already a late – Stage golden core when he attempted the heavenly stairs.”

“A core disciple of the xuanming Grotto – heaven … If my disciple was a late – Stage golden core cultivator, his performance wouldn’t be any worse than Xuan Jizi’s!” I’m still confident in the ‘great Dao technique’! If it wasn’t for the fact that 1 can’t cultivate again, I would even be willing to disperse all my power and start from zero!”

“Really?” Daoist priest Qing Xuan’s eyes widened in surprise.”! know that the great Dao chant is the result of the hard work of brother mountain and river, but I didn’t expect you to value it so much!”

Immortal Shanhe smiled as he looked at Xia ruofei in the bronze mirror and said,””To tell you the truth, Xia ruofei is the only one among my disciples who has cultivated the” great Dao chant. “He is also the only one in the entire cultivation world who has cultivated the” great Dao chant. “I have high hopes for him! At least until the Jindan stage, the “great Dao Arts” is in line with my expectations, or even beyond my expectations!”

If Xia ruofei had heard this, who knew what he would think. He had always thought that the “great way of Dao” was a mature technique. He had no idea that it was a set of techniques created by immortal mountain river. Moreover, immortal mountain river himself had never practiced it, and neither had his other disciples.

At this moment, Xia ruofei was resisting the pressure with all his might.

After he stabilized his figure, he did not immediately step up, but continued to stay on the four hundredth step. On one hand, he needed to catch his breath, and on the other hand, he wanted to get used to the sudden increase in pressure.

He would adjust for a while on the hundred steps so that his body could adapt to it.

After a few minutes, Xia ruofei finally regained his energy. He secretly encouraged himself and stepped onto the four hundred and first step …

As expected, the increase in pressure this time was not large.

Even though Xia ruofei could barely withstand the pressure, he had already adapted to it for a while. Hence, even though the increase was not particularly great, he was able to stabilize his body very quickly. He adjusted his breathing and continued to climb.

Xia ruofei seemed to have regained his steady rhythm, but he took longer with each step. His face was more serious as if he felt that the situation was not good.

In fact, that was the case. What Xia ruofei felt the most troublesome was not the huge pressure that had reached 200 to 300 grams, nor the invisible force that stirred the vital Qi. Instead, it was the spiritual pressure.

As the spiritual pressure continued to increase, it had already affected Xia ruofei.

In the face of such spiritual power Pressure, there was no other way to resist it. He could only release his spiritual power to resist it.

Originally, Xia ruofei’s spiritual power was already extremely close to the spiritual transformation realm of a nascent Soul Stage cultivator. It could be said that his spiritual power was definitely at the top level among the Golden core stage cultivators. Most of the later stage golden core cultivators could not reach this level. However, after reaching the 400th step, Xia ruofei still felt that the pressure from his spiritual power was making him more and more disobedient.

This also indirectly explained the difficulty of this Obsidian stairway. The top spiritual power cultivation of the Jindan stage could only persist for more than four hundred steps and was somewhat stretched out.

Now, Xia ruofei had to use up a lot of spiritual power with every step he took. His sea of consciousness was also constantly under attack, which gave him a splitting headache. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

However, Xia ruofei never believed in heresy. Unless he could not take it anymore and fainted, he would definitely grit his teeth and persist.

The muscles on his face began to tremble slightly, but the rhythm of his steps was very stable.

Four hundred and ten, four hundred and twenty, four hundred and thirty…

Xia ruofei continued to climb up slowly and steadily.

The spiritual power Pressure was getting stronger and stronger. He felt that his sea of consciousness was about to be crushed. His head felt like it was being pricked by hundreds of millions of needles at the same time, and his ears were buzzing.

Under this kind of pain, he still had to use all the strength in his body to resist the increasing squeezing force.

At the same time, he had to keep his mind clear and continue to operate the “great Dao technique” to stabilize his vital Qi.

Now, Xia ruofei basically had no way to stop his cultivation. Otherwise, his vital Qi would instantly boil and explode his dantian. It was extremely dangerous.

Xia ruofei finally understood why the Obsidian stairway was placed as the last stage.

He hadn’t felt it so intensely at first, but when he was around level four hundred and fifty, he deeply experienced the terror of this pressure and also deeply experienced the Super – difficult difficulty of this stage.

He stopped at the four hundred and fiftieth step for a while.

In the hidden space enshrouded in purple mist, Daoist Qing Xuan said with a smile,””It seems that 1 was right! This kid has the ability to reach level 450!” “Daoist qingxuan, you’re wrong!” Immortal Shanhe pouted. This disciple of mine clearly hasn’t reached his limit yet, so he’ll continue to improve. You’re not right!”

Daoist priest Qing Xuan laughed and said,”you and 1 both know that this child is already close to his limit!” You see, he’s been on the four hundred and fiftieth step for a long time, which means that he’s already barely resisting the pressure of this position. So even if he can continue to go up, I’m afraid he can only last a few more steps.”

After saying that, Qing Xuan looked at immortal mountain river and said with a smile,”Brother mountain river, you guessed that he was at rank four hundred and eighty.. In the end, we’ll see whose answer is closer to this kid’s actual score! Brother Shanhe, do you think that your disciple can still go past fifteen steps in his current state?”
