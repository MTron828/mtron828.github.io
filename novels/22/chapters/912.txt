“Yes, master!” Xia Qing said immediately.

Immediately after, Xia ruofei received a technique in his mind. As the two of them were communicating with their spiritual thoughts, the technique was very simple and the transmission was completed almost instantly.

Xia ruofei quickly analyzed the technique and realized that it was indeed very rough. The main function was to guide the innate pure Yang Qi through a specific Meridian route in the body and let it enter the dantian. Then, through a simple Qi circulation, the pure Yang Qi would stay in the body safely and nourish the meridians.

Xia ruofei had learned a lot of Chinese medical knowledge and was familiar with the meridians and acupoints of the human body. He quickly familiarized himself with the technique and was ready to help little Haoran clear his meridians.

Xia ruofei and Xia Qing communicated with their divine thoughts at a very fast speed, so not much time had passed. However, little Haoran’s condition had become more and more serious. His skin was burning hot, and his lips had even turned purple.

Tang Yitian and Jennifer waited anxiously on the side, but they didn’t dare to disturb Xia ruofei. They were burning with anxiety.

Not to mention the fact that the plane was 30000 feet in the air, even if they were on the ground, Tang Yitian was very clear that little Haoran’s condition couldn’t be treated by a doctor.

In the past, when little Haoran was in such a situation, they could only lower his temperature physically and wait for him to recover on his own. However, each time it acted up, it would be more serious than the previous one. This time, it was even more life – threatening.

Tang Yitian and Jennifer both felt quite helpless.

At this moment, Xia ruofei opened his eyes. Without hesitation, he carried little Haoran down from his seat and placed him on the floor. Then, he made little Haoran sit cross – legged.

Xia ruofei immediately sat down cross – legged behind little Haoran. He placed his palms on the Xinshu point on little Haoran’s back, closed his eyes, and released his spiritual energy into little Haoran’s meridians.

Lin Qiao, Tang Yitian, and his wife were all nervously watching. Tang Yitian’s eyes flashed with a trace of hope. Xia ruofei’s posture was obviously not the traditional Chinese medicine treatment posture. Moreover, Xia ruofei had blurted out that her meridians were blocked, which made Tang Yitian’s heart full of anticipation.

There were many acupuncture points on the back of the human body, and all of them had the word “Yu” in their names. For example, the heart point, the liver point, the gallbladder point, the stomach point ... These acupuncture points all belonged to the bladder meridian of the foot sun.

“Yu” meant “channel”. It was the channel between the internal organs and the surface of the body. The toxins in the internal organs could be discharged out of the body through the Yu acupuncture point.

Xia ruofei chose this acupuncture point to better channel the innate pure Yang Qi in little Haoran’s meridians. He wanted to expel it from his body and guide it into his own meridians.

When Xia ruofei’s spiritual energy entered little Haoran’s meridians through his Xinshu point, he immediately felt a strong sense of stagnation. His meridians seemed to be filled with a high concentration of pure Yang Qi.

After Xia ruofei’s spiritual energy entered his meridians, he first tried to open up a narrow passage in his meridians so that little Haoran’s main meridians would not be completely blocked by the pure Yang Qi. He could also circulate his qi and blood to a limited extent to solve the urgent situation.

The pure Yang Qi in little Haoran’s body was too strong. Xia ruofei was already exhausted just by temporarily clearing his meridians.

Fortunately, he had been taking the spirit nourishment soup regularly. In addition, he had recently been practicing how to draw the unlocking runes of the human – shaped jade talisman from a distance. His level of control over his mental power had greatly improved, so he was able to persist in one breath.

When Xia ruofei’s spiritual energy broke through the last barrier and reconnected the main meridians in little Haoran’s body, his qi and blood started to flow slowly.

In the eyes of Tang Yitian and the others, little Haoran’s symptoms were gradually getting better. The redness on his skin slowly faded away, and his tightly furrowed brows gradually relaxed. Although he hadn’t regained his consciousness yet, his condition had obviously improved.

Tang Yitian and Jennifer couldn’t help but show a trace of joy. They held each other’s hands tightly, as if they were giving each other strength, but also cheering for little Haoran.

At this moment, Xia ruofei’s T – Shirt was almost drenched in sweat and he looked exhausted.

Xia ruofei could not help but smile bitterly in his heart. He had underestimated the innate pure Yang Qi in little Haoran’s body.

He had yet to start guiding and absorbing the spiritual energy. Just opening up a ‘small path’ in his meridians to allow them to temporarily resume their flow had already consumed a huge amount of his spiritual energy.

Xia ruofei slowly opened his eyes and retracted his hands from the Xinyu acupoint on little Haoran’s back. Jennifer quickly reached out to support little Haoran.

Lin Qiao saw Xia ruofei’s exhausted look and took out a tissue to wipe his sweat. She asked in a low voice,””Brother ruofei, how are you?”

Xia ruofei patted the back of Lin Qiao’s hand and comforted her with a smile,””I’m fine ...”

However, Xia ruofei’s face was pale, he was sweating profusely, and his voice sounded tired. Both Tang Yitian and Jennifer were very touched when they saw this.

Xia ruofei stood up and said,”Mr. Tang, I’ve temporarily helped little Haoran to clear the most serious blocked meridians in his body. His condition should be greatly relieved. Please let the plane fly to Sydney as planned!”

Tang Yitian was overjoyed and quickly said,””Mr. Xia, thank you! Thank you! You’ve worked hard ...”

Then, Tang Yitian quickly apologized to the purser and the flight attendant next to him, saying that he didn’t need to change the plane’s plan and land at the nearest airport.

Jennifer also quickly expressed her gratitude to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei said tiredly,”you two, I haven’t finished. Little Haoran’s condition is more serious. All my efforts just now only cleared his meridians temporarily. This is a temporary solution. Moreover ... I think his meridians will be blocked again in an hour or two at most.”

Little Haoran’s condition was a gradual process. When his symptoms were discovered when he was very young, Tang Yitian must have invited many famous doctors to treat him.

However, the innate pure Yang Qi in his body was still slowly being blocked.

Three feet of ice could not be formed in a day. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

His illness on the plane this time was actually the result of the accumulation of pure Yang Qi in his body for many years.

Xia ruofei used his spiritual power to force open a narrow channel for his qi and blood to circulate. However, the pure Yang Qi in his body did not decrease, so the channel would be blocked again very quickly.

Tang Yitian’s and Jennifer’s expressions changed slightly when they heard this. Jennifer couldn’t help covering her mouth and sobbing helplessly.

Xia ruofei was so tired that he looked like he had just been fished out of the water, but he could only help little Haoran gain half an hour’s time. In Jennifer’s opinion, it was obviously impossible to completely get out of the crisis.

Tang Yitian looked at Xia ruofei pleadingly and said,””Mr. Xia, please save Haoran. I’m willing to pay any price!”

Xia ruofei wiped his sweat and said,”Mr. Tang, Ms. Annie, don’t worry. I’ve used up a lot of energy just now. I need some time to recover. I’ll try another method in half an hour before little Haoran’s meridians are completely blocked.”

“Good, good, good! “Mr. Xia, you should rest first ...” Tang Yitian said quickly.

Jennifer seemed to have grabbed onto a life – saving straw and said,””Mr. Xia, I’ll leave it to you ...”

Xia ruofei smiled weakly and said,””It was fate that little Haoran met us at the airport. He’s so cute, I won’t sit by and do nothing. Besides, Jennifer is my sister’s idol!”

“Lin, I’ll give you a signed CD when we get to Sydney,” Jennifer’s echo said to Lin Qiao.”What do you think?”

Lin Qiao covered her mouth in excitement and said,”A limited edition Jennifer’s echo? And your signature? I’m not dreaming, right?”

As Jennifer’s die – hard Fan, Lin Qiao naturally knew about this famous album.

It was the most powerful team formed by the entertainment companies under Tang Yitian after Jennifer announced her retirement from the entertainment industry. They carefully selected ten of the most classic songs of Jennifer’s acting career and then re – performed them by Jennifer.

Some of these songs were famous when Jennifer had just made her debut. After years of precipitation, Jennifer re – performed it and appeared to have a different flavor.

The most important thing was that this was actually a gift from Tang Yitian to Jennifer. There were only 500 of them in the world and they had never been sold publicly.

Among Jennifer’s fans, it was definitely a Grand – Level collection.

On Jennifer’s fan Forum, there were even rich people who offered to buy it for 100000 dollars, but if a real Jennifer fan was lucky enough to get such an album, they would not sell it no matter how much money they were offered.

When Lin Qiao heard that Jennifer wanted to give her an autographed “Jennifer’s echo,”she fell into a great happiness, as if she was in a dream.

Xia ruofei looked at Lin Qiao with a smile, thinking,”is this the legendary brain – dead fan?” As long as she could save little Haoran, Jennifer would agree without hesitation to hold a concert for Lin Qiao, let alone an album.

However, Xia ruofei didn’t care about Lin Qiao. He was very fond of his sister. As long as Lin Qiao liked her, it was fine.

Xia ruofei returned to his seat and reached into his bag to take out a bottle of dark brown Medicine.

This was the spirit nurturing soup that Xia ruofei had asked Xia Qing to brew in the space through his spiritual sense.

He had just secretly calculated the time, and today was just the right day to take the spirit nurturing soup. So after clearing little Haoran’s meridians, he immediately used his spiritual sense to inform Xia Qing to boil a portion of it in the spirit map space and put it in a mineral water bottle.

Because time flowed 30 times faster at the Archean realm than the outside world, Xia Qing had already prepared the spirit nurturing soup while Xia ruofei was talking to Tang Yitian and the others.

Xia ruofei reached into his bag to fool people. In fact, he took out the soup from the space.

Taking the spirit nourishment soup at this time would not only speed up the recovery of mental power, but it would also increase it to a certain extent.

Although the strength of his mental power had reached this level, and the increase of the spirit nourishment soup was not as strong as it was at the beginning, it was still a drop in the bucket. Perhaps it could play a key role when he guided little Haoran to absorb the pure Yang Qi.

Xia ruofei unscrewed the bottle cap and gulped down the soup. Then, he sat on the chair, closed his eyes, and began to recuperate.

Tang Yitian and the others were afraid of disturbing Xia ruofei, so they didn’t even dare to breathe loudly. Tang Yitian even stayed by Xia ruofei’s side, as if he was protecting little Haoran’s last hope.

Time passed by, and the cabin was silent. Only the sound of the plane’s engine, which had been suppressed by layers of noise, still stubbornly entered everyone’s ears.

About half an hour later, Xia ruofei had finally finished absorbing the essence of the soup. He had fully recovered his spiritual power and even improved a little.

Xia ruofei opened his eyes and stood up.””Jennifer, bring little Haoran over!”
