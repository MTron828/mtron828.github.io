Chapter 1548: Even the gods can’t break an inch of Jade (2)

Translator: 549690339

Yu mingdong looked at Xia ruofei and consoled him,””Mr. Xia, there’s no guarantee of winning in stone gambling. In fact, I’ve already cut out a good Jade, so I don’t think I’ll lose much money ...”

Before Xia ruofei could say anything, a middle – aged man with a big belly looked at the half – Bright material seriously and raised his head to say to Xia ruofei,””Little brother, how about you give me this piece of material? I’ll take the 3.5 million, and you’ll also lose less ...”

“I’m sorry, but I don’t plan to do anything for now,”Xia ruofei said with a faint smile.

Yu mingdong also glared at the middle – aged fatty and said,””Old Luo, Mr. Xia is my friend, and you dare to take advantage of him? Even if this material is a bit broken from the gamble, it shouldn’t be worth only 3.5 million!”

He Ping, who was at the side, said indifferently,””Actually, President Luo’s price is quite fair ...”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but squint his eyes and look at He Ping. What did this old man mean? Which side was he from? Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

He Ping, however, ignored Xia ruofei’s gaze and said,””President Yu, I didn’t think much of this material yesterday. I said that the starting price of five million was a little too high and the risk was too high. Now, my judgment has been confirmed.”

Yu mingdong frowned slightly and said,”old he, even so, 3.5 million is ...”

He Ping pouted and said,”this piece of Jade doesn’t have good penetration. If we continue to cut it, the quality of the Jade will be even worse. There might even be cracks. By then, it might not even be worth two million, let alone 3.5 million ...”

Seeing He Ping belittle this material like this, Xia ruofei was also quite unhappy. He said indifferently,””It doesn’t matter if it’s 3.5 million or 2 million, so what if it’s worthless? It was only a few million Yuan! Master, continue driving!”

He Ping snorted lightly and stood to the side without saying anything.

Boss Luo, who wanted to take advantage of the situation, also smiled and said,””Little brother, why do you have to fight for money? I’m helping you share the risk and reduce your losses!”

Xia ruofei was very confident. Even if this piece of material was really worthless, he didn’t care at all. So, he just smiled faintly and ignored boss Luo. He signaled the stonemasonger to continue opening.

Everyone thought that Xia ruofei was young and aggressive. In addition to He Ping’s judgment, a few people who wanted to raise the price to compete with boss Luo also gave up and made up their minds to watch the show.

Yu mingdong lost his confidence after hearing He Ping’s words. He wanted to advise Xia ruofei, but seeing how determined Xia ruofei was, he could only sigh and continue to watch from the sidelines.

The stonecutter rubbed his hands and continued to cut the stone.

This piece of material was already half – Open, so he did not need He Ping’s guidance. He directly used the grinding machine to start grinding bit by bit. This kind of work was completely familiarized with it. He had already done it for more than 20 years, so it was not difficult at all.

After a while, a complete piece of Jade was peeled off.

After washing it with water, everyone’s eyes naturally fell on this piece of Imperial Jade.

Yu mingdong stepped forward first, picked up the Jade material, and looked at it over and over again.

Then, he turned to Xia ruofei.”Mr. Xia, the situation is not bad. The waxy Jade has a good water source. It should be worth four to five million Yuan ...”

The possibility that He Ping had mentioned did not happen, but there was no miracle either. The final result was also considered to be calm.

He Ping said coldly from the side,”our luck is not bad. However, we only lost a little less. This kind of material costs more than eight million. Only a newbie would have the guts to buy it ...”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but roll his eyes. He didn’t know what was wrong with this old man today. He didn’t seem to have offended him! How could he be so sarcastic?

Yu mingdong was also a smart person. He definitely didn’t want to offend Xia ruofei, but He Ping was also a very capable stone gambling consultant. This time, he had helped him successfully win a lot of raw stones. In the future, he might need his help, so he couldn’t offend him.

Therefore, Yu mingdong simply changed the topic and said,””Mr. Xia, our factory can use this material. How about I buy it for five million?”

He was trying to reduce Xia ruofei’s loss. If it was another Jade merchant who bought it, they might only be able to pay 4.5 million Yuan. However, his own factory needed all kinds of Jade raw materials. Moreover, the skills of the Masters in his factory were quite good. Even if he bought it for 5 million Yuan, he would still make a profit. At the same time, he could do Xia ruofei a favor. It was killing two birds with one stone.

Xia ruofei’s spatial space had already been upgraded. If he continued to use emeralds to upgrade it, it would become a bottomless pit. For the time being, he still hoped to find more world stones.

After all, it wasn’t very reliable to level up by only relying on Jade.

In addition, even if he really needed to upgrade with Jade in the future, he could participate in other public Jade auctions and use the sensing ability of the spirit map scroll to buy raw stones. As long as he didn’t open them on the spot and ate them in a nice way, it wouldn’t be easy to arouse suspicion.

Since this piece had already been opened, selling it was a good choice.

Hence, Xia ruofei did not hesitate. He smiled and nodded.””Sure! If President Yu wants it, then you can have it ...”

Boss Luo and the others were also prepared to bid. Of course, they could not possibly offer such a high price of five million Yuan. They just wanted to take advantage of the situation.

However, this Jade was already a clear material, and there was also Yu mingdong who knew the industry. In addition, Yu mingdong directly offered a price of five million, so they naturally gave up.

“Alright, alright, alright. I’ll keep this piece of material for now!” Yu mingdong said happily,”I’ll transfer the money to you later!”

Xia ruofei nodded slightly. Yu mingdong immediately signaled for Shi Lei to come over and keep the Jade.

At this time, He Ping said coldly from the side,””President Yu, you’re really a good person!”

Yu mingdong smiled awkwardly. He felt that it was inappropriate to say anything, so he simply didn’t say anything.

Naturally, Xia ruofei was even more disgusted. He couldn’t help but say,””Old Mister he, are you so sure that you’ve lost this raw stone?”

He Ping froze for a moment, then shrugged and said with a smile,””Isn’t it obvious?”

Everyone also felt that it was a little funny. This was already a clear material, wasn’t it clear at a glance whether the bet would rise or fall?

This young man couldn’t be muddled from anger, right?

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”obviously?” I don’t think this piece of material has been completely cut open?”

With that, Xia ruofei pointed at the other small half of the raw stone and looked at He Ping.

Everyone immediately roared with laughter. He Ping also could not help but reveal a mocking smile and said,””You’re not hoping that there’s still Jade inside, are you?”

“Little brother, you’re taking this for granted!”

“You’re too naive! That’s just a piece of trash!”

Even the stonecutter couldn’t help but laugh and said,””Boss, there’s no Jade in this half! I’ve been in this business for more than 20 years. Although I’m not as good as those stone – gambling consultants, I can see that it’s just a piece of leftover material ...”

Xia ruofei said indifferently,”are you all so sure?” As the saying goes,’even the gods can’t see through an inch of Jade’. Maybe I’ll be lucky enough to get the king’s Green in the other half!”

He Ping couldn’t help but burst out laughing.”Emperor green? As long as there’s Jade in it, even if it’s bean – Type, I’ll eat it on the spot, let alone the king’s Green!”

“Why should I let you eat my Jade?” Xia ruofei blinked and said innocently,”did you ask for my opinion?”

Instead of getting angry, He Ping laughed and said,”I can’t be bothered to get tangled up with you!” If you want to play, then play! I’d like to see what kind of flowers can bloom from this piece of trash!”

Xia ruofei shrugged his shoulders and walked straight to the half of the raw stone. He said to the stonecutter,””Master, I’ll cut this material myself. Please lend me the grinder!”
