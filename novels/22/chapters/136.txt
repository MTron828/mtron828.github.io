Xia ruofei thought as he put on his clothes,”In the future, when this girl was at home, she would have to lock the door when she slept ... He quickly put on his clothes, then opened the door and walked out of the room. He was shocked as soon as he stepped out of the door. It turned out that Lin Qiao had not left yet. She was standing in the corridor. Seeing Xia ruofei come out, Lin Qiao blushed and said in a low voice,””Brother ruofei, I’m going to tell my mom that you’re a hooligan!” Xia ruofei looked indignant,”who’s the hooligan!” I almost let you see me naked ...” Lin Qiao blushed and laughed,”I don’t care to look at you!” Xia ruofei opened his eyes wide and asked seriously,””Then why did you come to my room ...” “I can’t be bothered with you, you big lazy worm!” Lin Qiao blushed and asked,”where’s the New Year’s gift you promised me?” “So, you came to my room early in the morning to ask for a gift!” Xia ruofei said, not knowing whether to laugh or cry. “You promised! A man must keep his word!” Lin Qiao raised her pretty little face and said. “You should have said so earlier! “I could have given it to you yesterday ...” Xia ruofei was speechless.”Alright, wait for me. I’ll go in and get it for you!” Then, Xia ruofei turned around, opened the door, and walked back to his room. He then turned around and said to Lin Qiao while holding the door,””You’re not allowed to peek this time!” “Who’s peeking at you, you lazy bum ...” Lin qiaojiao stomped her feet and said. Xia ruofei laughed and closed the door. Then, he carefully locked it. He summoned the spirit map scroll from his palm and closed his eyes slightly. His mind swept through the Spirit map space in the scroll and quickly locked onto something. With a thought, a flower pot suddenly appeared on the table. That’s right. Xia ruofei’s New Year gift for Lin Qiao was a beautiful succulents. Girls generally didn’t have much resistance to Mengmeng’s meaty body. Besides, this pot of ice lantern jade dew was carefully selected by Xia ruofei. The window and the shape were perfect. Lin Qiao would definitely like it. Sure enough, when Xia ruofei kept the spiritual map and opened the door with the basin of ice lantern jade dew, Lin Qiao, who couldn’t wait to see the high – Quality ice lantern, immediately showed a surprised look and didn’t hide her love for the basin of jade dew at all. “Brother ruofei, is this the New Year’s gift you’re giving me?” Lin Qiao asked. “Yup! Do you like it?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile. “Yes, yes!” Lin Qiao kept nodding her head, her eyes fixed on the pot of jade dew, unwilling to look away. Then, Lin Qiao hesitated and said,””Brother ruofei, this ... Should be very expensive, right?” Although Lin Qiao had become more cheerful recently and was more rude when talking to Xia ruofei, she was still a well – behaved girl. Therefore, even though she liked the gift very much, she still showed hesitation as she was worried that the gift was too expensive. Xia ruofei laughed.”I have a friend who does this business. He didn’t spend much. If you like it, just take it!” “AI! Thank you, brother ruofei!” Lin Qiao said happily and then took the basin of ice lantern jade dew as if she had obtained a treasure. Just as Lin Qiao was about to leave the room, she suddenly stopped and turned around to look at Xia ruofei. A sly smile appeared on her face as she said,””Brother ruofei, I know this is your fated year!” Lin Qiao’s face turned red and she quickly left Xia ruofei’s room. Xia ruofei was confused by Lin Qiao’s words. He frowned and thought for a while. Suddenly, his expression changed. He quickly lowered his head and pulled open his pants to look inside. He didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. It turned out that this girl had really seen it. This was really embarrassing ... Xia ruofei sat in the room for a long time, feeling the “trauma” in his heart slowly subside. Then, he pulled open the door and went downstairs with a bitter face. Lin Qiao was pasting couplets with ye Lingyun. Ye Lingyun stood on the human – shaped stairs and arranged his position. Lin Qiao would say “a little to the left” and “a little to the right” from time to time, giving ye Lingyun a lot of instructions. Seeing Xia ruofei come down, Lin Qiao blushed and smiled. Xia ruofei immediately ran to the kitchen to help Hu Zi’s mother. However, he was quickly chased out of the kitchen by Hu Zi’s mother because of his clumsiness. Seeing that he couldn’t help and was embarrassed to face Lin Qiao, Xia ruofei simply strolled to the farm. When they passed by the vegetable greenhouse, Xia ruofei saw that Cao tieshu was still squatting inside and working. He walked in as well. “Old Cao, Didn’t I tell you to go home earlier?” Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”you’re not going to prepare New Year’s Eve dinner?” Hearing Xia ruofei’s voice, Cao tieshu stood up and smiled honestly.”Boss, my wife will prepare the New Year’s Eve dinner. I’ll be on duty until the evening.” “No need! There’s nothing on the farm right now except for the seeds you planted a few days ago. It’s not worth it, so it’s fine to go back early. ” Xia ruofei said indifferently. “AI, alright! Thank you, boss!” Cao tieshu said. Then, he hesitated and said,””Boss, you were talking about the sowing, I was just about to report to you!” After he finished speaking, Cao tieshu pointed to the nursery and said,”Look, these seeds have been planted for less than three days, and they’re all sprouting, and these sprouts are not small ... I’ve been farming for my entire life, but I’ve never seen anyone sprout so quickly. Is there a problem?” Xia ruofei knew that it must be because the seed had been soaked in the petal solution, so he smiled and said,””Old Cao, I was wondering what you were doing here alone just now! Wasn’t it a good thing to sprout quickly? What was there to worry about? Don’t worry! This is a high – tech vegetable seed. It grows faster and has better quality than ordinary seeds!” “I’m relieved to hear you say that ...” Cao tieshu laughed awkwardly as he scratched his head.”I reckon that before I start work on the seventh, I’ll be able to transplant the plants on the third and fourth. Should I inform everyone to come over and work overtime on the fourth day of the new year?” Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”that’s fine!” You can ask everyone who’s free, this isn’t mandatory, if you’re free, come help me, I’ll pay you three times your salary!” “Alright!” Cao tieshu said,”everyone will definitely be free. Isn’t the new year just about visiting relatives and playing cards? It won’t be a problem to take a day out. ” Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. He then told Cao tieshu to hurry home and left the vegetable greenhouse. He strolled to the back of the mountain and looked at the fields that had been opened up into an Orchard that looked like a stepped field. He was also thinking about what Cao tieshu had said before. He should decide on the variety of fruit trees as soon as possible. What should I plant? The image of several fruits flashed across Xia ruofei’s mind ...
