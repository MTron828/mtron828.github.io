Chapter 1444: Consultant (1)

Translator: 549690339

Dong Yun had thought that Xia ruofei would ask her to join paradise Corporation again. Even if he did not mention it out of respect, she had already taken the initiative to agree to join. Under normal circumstances, Xia ruofei would have just gone with the flow and agreed.

In fact, Dong Yun had already made her decision at home.

Her mother was indeed the most important person to her. Xia ruofei’s act of righteousness yesterday was undoubtedly a huge favor to her. It was not her style to not repay a favor.

She also knew that Xia ruofei would not be short of money.

And the Paradise Corporation had just extended an olive branch to her, so she had already made preparations to change her plan and work for the Paradise Corporation.

Of course, this wasn’t without a deadline. Her pursuit of her career would never stop, and no matter how great this favor was, it wouldn’t make her work for paradise Corporation for the rest of her life.

Therefore, Dong Yun’s plan was to work for paradise Corporation for one to two years before resigning and leaving.

From her point of view, a year was enough for her to sort out the administrative work in the company and set up various effective systems. Even if she left, it would not have much of an impact. At the same time, she would repay Xia ruofei’s kindness. It was killing two birds with one stone.

She had planned everything well at home, but Xia ruofei did not play his cards according to common sense. This made Dong Yun a little shocked.

Moreover, Dong Yun could tell that Xia ruofei was sincere and did not seem to be faking it.

What should he do? Dong Yun couldn’t help but fall into a difficult situation.

Xia ruofei, who was standing at the side, could roughly guess what Dong Yun was thinking. He smiled and said,””Miss Dong, I’ve said it again and again. This is just a small matter, and I don’t need you to repay me. However, I can also tell that if I really don’t want anything, you might feel bad ...”

Dong Yun’s beautiful eyes looked at Xia ruofei. She thought to herself,”you’ve already said both the right and the wrong. What do you mean?”

Xia ruofei didn’t keep her in suspense and continued,””How about this! Do me a small favor, and then we won’t owe each other anything, how about it?”

“As long as it’s within my ability, I’ll definitely do my best!” Dong Yun said seriously,”but we can’t say that we don’t owe each other anything. No matter what, my mother and I will still be grateful to you, President Xia.”

“Okay, okay, okay ...” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”miss Dong, you haven’t joined a new company recently, right? I hope that if it’s convenient, miss Dong, you can come to our company as a temporary consultant. Whether it’s management, system, or other aspects of the company, as long as you feel that there’s room for improvement, you can directly mention it to President Feng. I hope that with your help, the company can be more formal and professional. ”

“No problem!” Dong Yun said without hesitation.

“Then, please invite miss Dong to our company after the spring Festival!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”President Feng, please arrange a car to pick up miss Dong every day!”

“Alright!” Feng ke said.

Since Xia ruofei was determined not to force her to return the favor and took the opportunity to let Dong Yun work in paradise Corporation, this was the second best option.

There was no doubt about Dong Yun’s ability. Although Feng Jing’s ability was also very strong, after all, she had been in this environment for a long time, and some people involved were confused. As for Dong Yun, she could use the time to take a look at paradise Corporation from an outsider’s perspective and give more suggestions on the hissing and standardization of paradise Corporation. The benefits were obvious.

“There’s no need to wait until after the spring Festival. I can start working now!”Dong Yun said directly.

“Miss Dong, you just returned to the country. Shouldn’t you spend more time with your family?” Xia ruofei asked in surprise.

“My mother works in the day, so there’s no one else at home.” Dong Yun said,”that’s not the main point. Since I’ve already promised President Xia, it’s best to get back to work as soon as possible!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said straightforwardly,”President Feng will personally handle everything with you!”

“CEO Feng, I need the company’s rules and regulations, organizational structure, personnel composition, and other relevant information. Also, please find me a small office. I want to read through the information first!” Dong Yun immediately said to Feng Jing.

“Alright, I’ll help you arrange it!” Feng Jing smiled and said,”miss Dong, please come to my office and have a seat!”

“Then I’ll have to trouble you, President Feng!” Dong Yun said.

Then, the two of them greeted Xia ruofei and walked out of the reception room side by side. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Xia ruofei was dumbfounded as he watched the two of them leave. This was the first time he had witnessed Dong Yun’s fiery style and it had left a deep impression on him.

Feng Jing was already a strong woman who risked her life for her work, and now, there was a Dong Yun with the same style. The two women in paradise Corporation, would there be any sparks?

Xia ruofei shook his head and quickly put this matter to the back of his mind.

There were only a few days left until the Spring Festival, and there wasn’t much work to do in the company. He didn’t stay in the office for long. After sitting for a while, he signed a few documents and sneaked home.

Time flew by.

Before the Spring Festival, while most of the institutions and companies in the system were still working, the employees of paradise Corporation had already entered the state of vacation.

In addition to the necessary staff on duty to ensure the company’s operation, most of the employees had gone home for the new year.
