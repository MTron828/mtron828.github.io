“Yes! Master!” “Yes!” Qingfeng Luo said respectfully.

Then, he couldn’t help but ask curiously,””Master, you ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I have to practice sword Kinesis flight first!” He didn’t try it after his breakthrough yesterday. He couldn’t just fly right away! Wouldn’t it be so embarrassing if you fell into the sea?”

Luo Qingfeng was dumbfounded. After a while, he asked,””Master ... You haven’t tried to ride a flying sword after your breakthrough?”

Generally speaking, when a cultivator broke through to the Golden core stage, they could not wait to try flying on a sword. After all, flying had been the dream of all humans since ancient times, including Luo Qingfeng. After he had completed the construction of the vital Qi vortex, he was still a skeleton. He could not wait to sneak out of his closed – door cultivation and began to learn how to fly on a sword like a child who had just gotten a new toy.

Luo Qingfeng thought that Xia ruofei must have tried it after his breakthrough last night. Otherwise, why would he fly so far today just to get a batch of supplies from the secular world?

Xia ruofei shrugged.”I went back to rest after breaking through last night. I was busy this morning too. I didn’t have the time to try it out!”

Luo Qingfeng could not help but be speechless. He thought to himself, isn’t master’s heart too big?

He thought for a moment and said tactfully,”master, you should get familiar with the operation of sword Kinesis flight first. If it really doesn’t work, we’ll delay our departure for a few days.”

In Luo Qingfeng’s opinion, it was already a genius to be able to master the technique of sword Kinesis flight in a few days.

Xia ruofei smiled.”Thank you for your reminder. I’ll give it a try. If it’s too difficult to master, we’ll delay the departure time.”

Qingfeng Luo was secretly relieved. It seemed that master was not a stubborn person. Look, master was very good at sword Kinesis flight!

With a thought, Xia ruofei took out the blue traveling immortal sword that had been nurtured in his dantian.

The blue immortal sword was like a nimble fish, dancing nimbly around Xia ruofei. This flying sword had been nurtured for a long time and was now very compatible with Xia ruofei. He could control it as if it was his own arm.

Luo Qingfeng was not in the mood to cultivate and regulate his breathing. He stared at Xia ruofei without blinking. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Luo Qingfeng had witnessed the power of this flying sword long ago and had a deep impression of it. At that time, Xia ruofei had just broken through the bottleneck of the Qi refinement stage and had used the power of the array to kill Luo Qingfeng with this flying sword.

Now that Xia ruofei was already in the early – Stage golden core realm and was going to try sword Kinesis flight for the first time, Luo Qingfeng naturally did not want to miss any details.

In the second level of the great Dao Arts, in addition to the cultivation method, there were also various techniques that matched the various stages of the Golden core stage, including the construction of the vital Qi vortex. At the same time, it naturally also contained the very important skill of the Golden core stage, sword riding flight.

The sword control technique recorded in the second level of the “great Dao Arts” was naturally unique. In fact, every cultivator’s sword control technique was different. Because the level of exquisiteness of the technique was different, everyone’s speed and energy transformation efficiency when controlling the sword were different.

Xia ruofei silently reviewed the sword control technique recorded in the “great Dao Arts”, then confidently released his spiritual power to explore the Blue immortal sword ...
