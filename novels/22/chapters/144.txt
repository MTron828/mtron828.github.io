Chapter 145: Chapter 142 – lawless

Cao tieshu did not answer Xia ruofei’s question. Instead, he said worriedly,””Boss, you ... You hit Chen Gang. This is not a small problem ...” The other villagers in the ward also said,” “Yes, boss Xia. Chen Gang is the son of Chen Jinbo, the owner of the abalone farm in the county. He has a lot of power in the county!” “Chen Jinbo is also a committee member of the county’s Government Association. He knows many important people ...” “Boss Xia, please think of a way to resolve this ...” “Stop, stop, stop!” Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.”I have my ways. You don’t have to worry about me. Even if the sky is falling, you should at least let me know what happened, right?” Cao tieshu glared at his wife on the bed and said, “It’s all because of this woman! Why are you joining in the fun? What’s there to visit at a temple fair? Now that we’ve caused such a huge disaster ...” Cao tieshu’s wife said, feeling wronged,”I didn’t know that this would happen! There were at least a few thousand people at the temple fair, so why didn’t they get involved? I’m just so unlucky!” “You still dare to talk back!” Cao tieshu’s eyes widened as he spoke. Xia ruofei forced a smile and advised,”old Cao, what’s done is done. What’s the point of blaming sister – in – Law?” What had happened? I’m still confused!” Cao tieshu sighed and told Xia ruofei everything. It turned out that Cao tieshu’s wife and a few villagers had made an appointment to go to the temple fair in the county. Not long after entering the county, a large Wolfhound suddenly rushed out from the vicinity of the police station in the west of the city. Cao tieshu’s wife was so frightened that she fell heavily from her bicycle. She just happened to hit the stone along the road, and her tibia was fractured on the spot. That large Wolfhound was still aggressively pouncing towards Cao tieshu’s wife. Her leg was fractured, and she couldn’t run away. As a result, her face was scratched and had several bloody marks. The villagers who went to the temple fair with him hurried forward to chase the dog away, but the dog seemed to have gone mad. The situation was urgent at the time, and if this Mad Dog was allowed to go crazy, Cao tieshu’s wife might have lost her life. One of the villagers happened to have a hoe on his tricycle, so he raised it to hit the dog. At that time, the scene was chaotic, and they couldn’t remember the specific situation. They only remembered that they had hit the hoes a few times, and maybe one of them had hit the big wolfdog’s vital point. The big wolfdog was killed on the spot. At this time, the place where Cao tieshu’s wife’s bones were fractured was already very swollen. There were also many bruises and scratches that were bleeding. The villagers did not care about finding the dog’s owner to pay for the medical expenses. They quickly sent Cao tieshu’s wife to the hospital and asked Cao tieshu’s wife to call and inform Cao tieshu. The emergency and hospitalization fees were paid by a few villagers. Unexpectedly, after dealing with the fractures and wounds, Cao tieshu arrived at the inpatient department. Not long after he arrived, Chen Gang came to the door with a few Auxiliary Police officers. It was only then that everyone knew that the Alsatian was Chen Gang ‘s. Chen Gang’s family owned the largest abalone farm in the county. His father, Chen Jinbo, was a member of the county government’s administrative Association and was considered a famous local private entrepreneur. Chen Gang had been mischievous since he was a child, and his academic results were terrible. After graduating from high school, he was transferred to the city’s West police station as an auxiliary police officer through some connections in his family. With his family’s power and the skin of a police officer, Chen Gang was even more arrogant and domineering. His bad reputation was known all over the country. The Alsatian was raised by Chen Jinbo in the abalone farm, and Chen Gang often brought it to the police station. He didn’t know why he had run out of the police station today. Chen Gang, who was on duty today, was playing cards in the office with a few of his bad friends, so he didn’t know anything. After the Wolfhound ran out, it ran towards Cao tieshu’s wife. In the end, it was accidentally killed by a villager, and Chen Gang was completely unaware of it. Later, some of Chen Gang’s acquaintances recognized that it was his dog and quickly ran to the police station to inform him. When Chen Gang saw his beloved dog lying dead on the spot, he immediately exploded and asked around with a few Auxiliary Police officers. Many people had seen what had happened, so Chen Gang and the others quickly found the hospital. When they met, not only did Chen Gang not apologize for his dog hurting people, but he also asked Cao tieshu to compensate him for his dog. He even asked for 50000 Yuan. Cao tieshu’s stomach was filled with anger when his wife got into such a situation on the first day of the new year! Hence, both parties started quarreling and Xia ruofei arrived. Finally, Cao tieshu said indignantly, “I’ve long heard that the Chen family is overbearing. I’ve finally witnessed it today ...” “AI! Tie Shu, what do we common people have to fight with them!” An elderly villager sighed and said,”I think you’d better get out of the hospital with your sister – in – Law and find a place to hide! And this boss Xia, you should also quickly think of a solution. If you can ‘t, go out and hide for a few days ...” The others also tried to persuade him. “Yup! We can’t afford to offend the Chen family!” “Boss Xia, a wise man knows when to retreat. Let’s hide for a while ...” Xia ruofei’s brows furrowed as he listened to Cao tieshu’s story. Although it was only a few words, it was clear how arrogant and despotic Chen Gang was. Moreover, all the villagers were so afraid. It was clear how powerful the Chen family was in Changping County. Chen Gang’s behavior today was simply lawless! Xia ruofei was not a nosy person. However, since something like this happened to his farm employee, he had to step in. Thinking of this, Xia ruofei said to Cao tieshu and the villagers,””Old Cao, sister – in – Law, fellow villagers, you can rest assured! Sister – in – Law can’t get out of bed right now, so you just stay here and recuperate. Don’t worry, with me around, no one will dare to touch a single hair on you!” “Boss Xia, Chen Jinbo has a good relationship with some of the leaders in the county. You ...” The elderly villager said hesitantly. Xia ruofei smiled and said,”no matter how powerful you are, you can’t beat the law. No matter how powerful you are, you can’t beat the organization!” Don’t worry!” The senior villager looked at Xia ruofei. To put it nicely, this young man was like a newborn calf that was not afraid of a Tiger. To put it bluntly, he was a little dazed. Chen Jinbo has been in the Chang Ping District for more than ten years and has many connections. You’re just a young man who started a small farm in the village. How can you fight against such a Big Shot? The other villagers also wanted to persuade Xia ruofei. But Cao tieshu listened to Xia ruofei’s words and said firmly,””Boss, since you’ve said so, I’ll listen to you. Let’s not go anywhere and just recuperate in this hospital. I don’t believe that the Chen family can be above the law!” Xia ruofei nodded in appreciation. The villagers saw that the person involved had such an attitude, so they no longer tried to persuade him. After saying a few words of comfort, they left one after another. They were also afraid of getting into trouble. Although Chen Gang had already identified Cao tieshu’s family, they had killed the dog together after all. After the villagers left, Xia ruofei saw that Cao tieshu’s wife was still worried. He smiled and said,””Sister – in – Law, don’t be afraid. I’ll make a call now. Don’t worry, I also know a few people from the top. ” “Boss Xia, then you should quickly look for the higher – ups and settle this matter ...” Cao tieshu’s wife quickly said. People from the countryside did not know much, but when she heard Xia ruofei say that she had connections, she seemed to be more at ease. “Boss, I’m really sorry! “I didn’t expect that you would be implicated in this matter ...” Cao tieshu said guiltily. “Old Cao, don’t say such things!” Xia ruofei said,”it’s fine if I don’t know about this, but since I know, I have to do something about it. You’re an employee of our company, and you’re even a middle – rank backbone. The company must make decisions for your family!” Cao tieshu revealed a touched expression and said,””Thank you, boss!” Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. He reached out and patted Cao tieshu’s shoulder. Then, he took out his phone and walked to the corridor outside the ward. The most effective way to deal with the matter in Changping County was to look for the newly appointed Wu Liqian. If even Wu Liqian couldn’t handle it herself, she would naturally turn to her old superior, Tian Huilan, for help. However, the possibility of this happening was very low. If a local boss could make Wu Liqian, the executive Deputy County Head, feel helpless, then she wasn’t worthy of Tian Huilan’s trust and heavy responsibility. Hence, Xia ruofei took out his phone and dialed Wu Liqian’s number.
