Chapter 1568: The first experience of cultivation (1)

Translator: 549690339

Yu mingdong couldn’t help but be stunned. His first reaction was that Xia ruofei had called a prostitute last night.

He thought to himself,”young people are so aggressive!” What good stuff could a small place like Rui Zhou have? He was actually so desperate ...

Yu mingdong thought about how Xia ruofei went to his room in the middle of the night to ask for a piece of Jade. He couldn’t help but mumble in his heart. He thought that Xia ruofei couldn’t have been satisfied with the Jade and specially gave it to the woman on the bed. That would be a huge investment ...

Xia ruofei also realized that something was wrong. He quickly explained,””President Yu, that’s my friend. She came to visit me yesterday, but because it was too late, I let her stay over. I slept on the sofa!”

When he said this, Xia ruofei even pointed at the quilt that was spread out on the sofa, afraid that Yu mingdong would not believe him.

Yu mingdong naturally didn’t believe it. As for the quilt on the sofa, who knew if they had fun last night and specially took it out from the bedroom? didn’t young people nowadays like to play something different?

Yu mingdong revealed a smile of understanding and said,””I understand, I understand...Mr. Xia, I’ll wait for you outside! Let’s have breakfast together later!”

Xia ruofei was speechless. He couldn’t clear his name even if he jumped into the Yellow River!

At this time, Song Wei heard the sound and sat up from the bed in a daze.

In fact, she had tossed and turned in bed last night and couldn’t fall asleep. Anyone would be too excited to fall asleep after so many bizarre things happened to them.

Song Wei only managed to fall asleep when the sun started to rise. She had not slept for long.

She rubbed her drowsy eyes and was shocked when she saw that there was an unfamiliar man standing outside besides Xia ruofei.

Even though she was sleeping with her clothes on, she still pulled the blanket up subconsciously.

“Song Wei, you’re awake!” Xia ruofei quickly called out,”come, come, come. Let me introduce you ...”

Only then did Song Wei realize that she was wearing clothes. However, girls loved to look pretty. How could she show her unkempt face when she had just woken up?

“Ruofei, help me close the door first. I’m going to wash up ...” She said.

Xia ruofei then came back to his senses and walked over to close the door. Then, he said to Yu mingdong,””He’s really my friend. Don’t get the wrong idea ...”

Yu mingdong laughed and said,”no, no!” How could he have thought wrongly? Mr. Xia, why don’t I ... Leave for a moment?”

“Don ‘t!” Xia ruofei quickly said,”you should stay here! Otherwise, I won’t be able to clear my name even if I jump into the Yellow River!”

Yu mingdong couldn’t help but laugh. He simply walked to the sofa and sat down.

Xia ruofei passed a cigarette to Yu Ming Dong. Yu Ming Dong took it and looked at the specially – supplied cigarettes without any labels. His eyes brightened, but he did not say anything. He took out the lighter without a sound and took the initiative to light Xia ruofei’s cigarette.

After waiting for more than ten minutes, Song Wei opened the door and walked out.

When Yu mingdong saw this, he knew that he had really misunderstood just now. Let’s not talk about whether the relationship between this girl and Xia ruofei was really as pure as he said, but at least she definitely did not have the natural temperament of the Ruizhou’s local prostitute Song Wei. It was something that girls from ordinary families could not imitate.

Xia ruofei said,”Song Wei, come here. Let me introduce you. This is Yu mingdong, President Yu. He’s in the Jade industry. President Yu has helped me a lot when I came to Yunnan!”

Then, Xia ruofei said to Yu mingdong,””Mr. Yu, Song Wei is my friend. She just arrived in Dian province yesterday. It’s quite late, so I let her stay in my room for the night. I’ll have to trouble you to get another room for her later.”

When Xia ruofei spoke, he gave Song Wei a look. Song Wei was smart and naturally knew how to cooperate with Xia ruofei.

“No problem, no problem!” Yu mingdong quickly said.

“Nice to meet you, miss song!” He said to Song Wei.

“Good day, President Yu!” Song Wei smiled at Yu mingdong.”Sorry for the trouble!”

“No, no, no!” Yu mingdong quickly said,”miss song, you’re too kind! Mr. Xia has been a great help to me!”

Xia ruofei laughed and waved his hand,””Let’s not talk about this. President Yu, you have something to do in the morning. Let’s go to the public Jade bid after lunch!”

Then, Xia ruofei said to Song Wei,””There’s a public Jade bid in Ruizhou. I’ll Take You There in the afternoon.”

“Sure!” Song Wei nodded obediently.

Yu mingdong took it all in and said,”Mr. Xia, miss song, I won’t disturb you anymore. I’ll have them send breakfast to the room.” Also, after you’ve checked in, I’ll have someone send the room card over! I’ll be taking my leave in the morning, please make yourselves at home!” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Good! We’ll contact each other at noon!” Xia ruofei stood up and sent Yu mingdong to the door.

After they returned to their room, Xia ruofei said to Song Wei,””Mr. Yu is in the Jade business. I took an ice – Type jade from him to make your Doraemon pendant. I carved it myself.”

“The public Jade bid should be interesting, right?” Song Wei nodded.

Xia ruofei briefly explained the stone gambling situation to Song Wei and said,””For people like us who have no experience, to put it bluntly, it’s just a matter of luck. If we’re lucky, we might be able to earn ten or twenty times more. Of course, if we’re unlucky, it’s very likely that we’ll lose hundreds or even millions of dollars.”
