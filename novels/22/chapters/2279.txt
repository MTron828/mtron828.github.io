2280 The car has arrived_In the end, Li Zhe said,”this car is different from most Wei nation cars. Not only does it retain the high comfort of Wei nation cars, but it has also been optimized to the extreme. It’s also quite safe, unlike the Wei nation cars that people have a stereotype of ...”

After that, Li Zhe briefly introduced the safety features of the car.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,””Not bad! Not bad! Xiao si, you’ve really worked hard this time! Thank you very much!”

“I should! I should!” Li Zhe quickly said,”as long as you’re satisfied, brother Xia!”

“I’m satisfied! I’m satisfied!” Xia ruofei said with a smile. Then, he took out the cash check that he had prepared earlier from his inner pocket and handed it to Li Zhe. He said,”Xiao si, this is the money for the car. Keep it.”

The amount on the check was 550000 Huaxia dollars. It was basically the price that song Rui had mentioned. Li Zhe had also mentioned during the meal that day that the car was originally custom – made and had some additional functions. Although it had been negotiated and given to Xia ruofei first, the car had already been on the cargo ship at the time. Naturally, it was impossible to change the configuration. Therefore, the price was slightly more than what song Rui had said.

Of course, compared to the market price, it was simply too cheap.

Nowadays, the price of an Elfa car was usually 200000 to 300000 Yuan. Including the import tariffs, the landing price of the same model would be at least 1.6 million Yuan, and 550000 Yuan was not even a fraction of that.

Of course, Li Zhe knew that Xia ruofei was not short of money. At the same time, he also knew that Xia ruofei did not want to owe him too much, so he did not insist on giving Xia ruofei a discount or simply giving him the car.

After Xia ruofei handed the check over, Li Zhe did not reject it and took it with a smile. However, he did not look at the amount and kept the check. He said,””Thank you, brother Xia!”

“I should be the one thanking you!” Xia ruofei smiled.”Xiaosi, I know what to do!”

“Hehe, it’s nothing. It’s not worth mentioning.” Li Zhe hurriedly said.

“Xiao si, it’s almost noon. Stay for lunch!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Li Zhe waved his hand and said,”no!” No! Brother Xia, I’m still working on the license plate! I’ll be going to the vehicle Administration soon! Let’s forget about eating! If there’s a chance next time, I’ll treat you to ...”

“Alright! Since you’re busy, I won’t keep you. ” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”let’s meet again when we have time!”

“Alright! Alright!” Li Zhe hurriedly said,”brother Xia, although the license plate is still being processed, I’ve given you a temporary license plate. You can use this car at any time. Don’t worry, I’ve already done a full – body test at Jingjin port, and the fuel tank is full!”

“Thank you ...” Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. Then he asked,”Oh right, you left your car here. You don’t have a car, do you?” I’ll get Wu Qiang to drive you!”

“No need! No need! No need!” Li Zhe quickly said,”brother Xia, I brought a car. It’s parked at the entrance.”

“Oh, alright then!”

“Brother Xia, I’ll take my leave first. Please stay!” Li Zhe hurriedly said.

Xia ruofei still personally sent Li Zhe to the door. After watching the car leave, he returned to the courtyard.

“President Xia, this car is so beautiful!” Qin Yanan said.

The Veterans, Wu Qiming and Zheng Zhigang, also nodded in agreement.

Xia ruofei walked over with a smile. After looking at Qin Yanan, he suddenly had an idea and asked,””Yanan, has President Dong’s schedule been decided? How many people are there in their group?”

“President Xia, I was just about to report to you!” Qin Yanan quickly said. This time, our company has formed a team of six people, led by President Dong. They’ve already booked the tickets and will be landing in Beijing around 3 pm!”

“Has the hotel been arranged?” Xia ruofei nodded and asked.

Qin Yanan nodded.”Yes, it’s at the Shangri – La Chaoyang restaurant. Tomorrow’s contract signing ceremony will also be held at this hotel. We’ve already booked the room and conference room in advance. He Yu has already gone to the hotel to make the first move. I’ll go to the airport to pick her up in the afternoon.”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”okay!” There are a total of six of them. Including you who’ll be there to pick them up and the driver, there’ll be a total of eight people ... Although it’s a little crowded, it’s still enough! Yanan, you can take this new car to pick us up in the afternoon! If we let Wu Qiang drive, there might be one more person in the back seat, but it’s not a big problem. ”

Qin Yanan smiled and said,”President Xia, you haven’t even enjoyed the new car yet!” Let’s take the lead!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”didn’t I buy the car for use?” Besides, I bought this car for business purposes, so ... It’s just entered the door, and it’s already in use. How great!”

“That’s because you’re considerate of your employees, President Xia!” Qin Yanan complimented Xia ruofei.”Why don’t we just rent a car or ask them to take a taxi?”

“Stop flattering me!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”there will be a lot of work to do these two days. You have to do a good job in coordinating all aspects!”

“Yes!” Qin Yanan said with a smile.

“Go to the backyard and inform Wu Qiang!” Xia ruofei said,”by the way, tell Auntie Wu that I’m going to invite the company’s employees to my house tonight. Tell her to bring out her trump card and prepare a banquet!”

“Do you want to invite President Dong and the others?” Qin Yanan asked.

“Of course! This kind of temporary business trip is also very tiring, I’m going to reward them!” Xia ruofei said,”tell President Dong that after we pick them up in the afternoon, they can go to the hotel to settle down first. Then, they can come directly to the siheyuan!”

“Understood!” Qin Yanan said.

……

After lunch, Qin Yanan left the siheyuan in Wu Qiang’s Black Toyota Elfa business car and headed to the airport to meet Dong Yun and her group.

The car finally returned at around FiveO’ clock, and the courtyard house suddenly became lively.

On the way back, Wu Qiang drove the car in directly from the backyard. As there were several garages rebuilt in the backyard, the car would definitely be parked in the backyard in the future.

The employees that Dong Yun had brought with her were from the finance department, the legal department, the Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory, and the company’s administrative office. Everyone had their own duties and responsibilities, and Dong Yun was in charge of managing the company.

The employees were naturally very excited that the chairman was going to reward everyone with a family dinner.

When everyone saw the magnificent siheyuan, their envy was beyond words.

There were four girls in the team, including Dong Yun, and only two guys.

After looking around, the girls went to the kitchen in the backyard to help out. Even Qin Yanan and he Yu put on their aprons and were busy in the kitchen.

Dong Yun didn’t join in the fun. She came to Xia ruofei and said,””President Xia, this move of yours is really unexpected! When factory manager Xue heard the news, he was so happy that he almost went crazy!”

Xia ruofei laughed.”Jinshan must be complaining. Since he’s going to acquire such a large Pharmaceutical Group, why did he approve the plan to build a branch in Changping County?”

“I guess Factory manager Xue hasn’t had the time to think about this yet!” Dong Yun said with a smile. He’s already drowned in a great sense of happiness!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.””Actually, plans can never be as fast as changes. This incident was also caused by a series of coincidences. I can’t predict the future, so ...”

“By the way, President Xia, President Feng wanted me to pass you a few words before I came out!” Dong Yun suddenly said. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Why didn’t she call me directly?” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.”Why are you being so mysterious?”

“Director Feng was going to come over personally, but she really can’t leave the company. That’s why I’m the one who brought the team here in the end. “President Feng said ... After horizon Corporation merged with paradise Corporation, she requested to dilute her shares ...”
