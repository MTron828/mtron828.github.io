Chapter 364: A showdown (2)

“Who doesn’t know how to say pretty words?” Lu You snorted and said,”as for the awareness of the teachers and students of Agricultural University ... I really don’t believe it!”

“I think you just don’t dare to!” Chen Song sneered and said,”since that’s the case, let’s just call it a draw. We don’t want to be accused of bullying others!”

The students of the three mountains University were not happy with this and began to argue. Naturally, Agricultural University was not to be outdone. The people from both sides started quarreling.

The teachers and students of the other universities in the hall had not left yet, so the dispute here quickly attracted everyone’s attention, and they all turned their eyes to this side.

Agricultural University’s vice – Principal li was about to come down from the rostrum. He frowned and asked loudly,””What’s going on over there?”

Xia ruofei naturally wouldn’t let Meng Zhou’s plan succeed. When he heard vice – Principal Li’s question, he immediately raised his voice and said,””Vice – Principal li, our students from Sanshan University and Agriculture and Forestry University are discussing whether jade lion or yang suhe will win first place!”

At this time, Xia ruofei naturally included himself in the ranks of the three mountains University.

Vice – Principal li frowned and said,””Didn’t the judging panel already come to a conclusion? Two pots of flowers won the gold Prize, what’s there to argue about?”

Xia ruofei smiled faintly.”Although there is no first place in literature or second place in martial arts, since there are gold, silver, and bronze prizes in this exhibition, and there was only one gold Prize, it’s best to distinguish them clearly. Otherwise, people will say that we have taken advantage of them!”

The president of the florist Association, Chen dongbai, laughed and said,”Student, since the judging team believes that the two pots of flowers will win the gold Prize, we must have our own considerations. There is no need to separate the first and second place!”

Xia ruofei said,”but this morning, student Chen Song from Agricultural University said that yang suhe is determined to win the gold medal. He even made a bet with us. He said that our jade lion will definitely not be able to win yang suhe.” Since that’s the case, I think it’s better to distinguish clearly. ”

Vice – Principal Li’s face turned ugly as he glared at Meng Zhou.

He had said such arrogant words before the start of the exhibition, and now it was said in front of all the universities. This made Vice President li feel a little embarrassed.

Meng Zhou looked at Chen Song with a bitter smile. He had no way of explaining. Although this matter had nothing to do with him from the beginning to the end, he, the president, could only take the blame.

“Then how do you guys want to decide who’s better?” Chen dongbai said with a smile.

“President Chen, we would like to invite you to visit the exhibition ...” Meng Zhou immediately said.

“President Chen, I feel that I’ll still have to trouble the judges for this matter.” Xia ruofei interrupted Meng Zhou’s words.

He definitely couldn’t let Meng Zhou voice their proposal. Otherwise, if they really did as Meng Zhou said and invited the audience to vote, it would be unfair. Meng Zhou could mobilize many students and teachers to vote for yang suhe. There were so many students in Agricultural University, and if each of them voted, there would be no suspense at all in the competition.

“Hmph!” Meng Zhou snorted.”Just now, President Chen said that the judges ‘decision was to tie for the gold Prize. Now you want the judges to decide who’s first and who’s second? aren’t you forcing me?”

“That’s still better than some suggestions that can just buy votes!” Xia ruofei said bluntly,”I believe that the judges will definitely have a way to give us an objective and fair judgment!”

The teachers and students from other universities were not in a hurry to leave either. They all stayed to watch the show.

Two Gold Award winners going against each other, what a sight to see!

Chen dongbai’s expression was difficult, and he was also very hesitant. In fact, even the judges couldn’t tell which of these two pots of flowers was stronger, but at the same time, they both surpassed the other flowers in the exhibition by a lot, which was why they tied for the gold Prize.

If it was so easy to distinguish, then one of the two pots of flowers would definitely only win a Silver Prize. Why would the judges go through so much trouble and even change the award limit at the last minute?

Seeing Chen dongbai’s awkward expression, Meng Zhou couldn’t help but feel proud. If Chen dongbai refused this proposal, then he could only follow his words and give the voting rights to the audience.

In this way, yang suhe could win first place without any suspense, which was much better than the tied Gold Award!

Professor Tian, who was also on the stage, looked at Xia ruofei and smiled.””President Chen, since the children have made this request, I think our judging panel should work a little harder ... After all, our job is to evaluate all the flowers and plants that are exhibited!”

Chen dongbai could still reject Xia ruofei’s words, but he couldn’t beat around the bush when it came to the words of the highly respected professor Tian.

Chen dongbai hesitantly said in a small voice,”Elder Tian, we’ve been discussing for so long, but we still can’t come to a consensus ...”

Professor Tian chuckled and said,”President Chen, I think there’s no need for us to discuss this any further. The appraisal of such flowers has always been based on the opinions of the people. Why don’t we just do a secret vote? all the judges will have one vote each. The one who gets the most votes in the end will be first place. What do you think?”

When Chen dongbai heard this, he couldn’t help but feel a little moved.Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates
