Chapter 60: A battle of words (1)

Ling Qingxue closed her phone and said calmly,” “The most direct way is, of course, to look for a new chef! However, I’m afraid it’s not easy to find someone who is as capable and famous as the Executive Head Chef of Ming Hao restaurant in a hurry ...” Ling Xiaotian frowned slightly and said,” “We’ve discussed this just now. The Human Resources Department will contact the headhunting company, but this can’t be solved in a day or two! Say something useful. ” Ling Qingxue shrugged and said,” “Since this method can’t quench our thirst, we can only find another breakthrough. I’ve proposed to make an issue of the quality of the ingredients, but my proposal has been rejected by you. Other than this, I don’t have any better ideas. ” This girl’s resentment was still very deep! The day before yesterday, when she returned home, she had already mentioned this to Ling Xiaotian. However, she didn’t know what he Dong had said to Ling Xiaotian, but Ling Xiaotian didn’t listen to her explanation. He only said that there couldn’t be any compromises when it came to food safety issues, and that ingredients that didn’t have an authoritative test report were strictly not allowed to enter. Ling Qingxue’s next words were completely sealed off. Ling Qingxue naturally felt indignant. Whether it was public or private, she felt that her father was biased and believed in an outsider’s words, but he didn’t listen to his own daughter’s words. It was really unreasonable. Ling Xiaotian’s brows furrowed even more as he said,” “Qingxue, let’s not talk about this plan today!” He said in his heart,”Qingxue is getting more and more insensible!” It seemed that what Xiao He said was true. She must have been deceived by the student who sold vegetables! At this moment, he Dong, who had not spoken all this time, suddenly said,” “Chairman Ling, I think Qingxue’s opinion makes a lot of sense!” Ling Xiaotian’s brows raised in surprise. Even Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but look at he Dong with a strange expression.”Was he out of his mind? You’ve been trying all sorts of underhanded methods to stop my plan. Why did your attitude suddenly take a 180 – degree turn today? Ling Xiaotian quickly regained his normal expression and said indifferently,” “Little he, tell me the details!” He Dong seemed to be very satisfied with the effect of his words. He looked around at the crowd, cleared his throat, and then said in a clear voice,” “The reason is very simple. Everyone has analyzed it just now. Other than finding an Outstanding Chef as soon as possible, what we can do is nothing more than to improve the management system, further improve the service level, and most importantly, make an issue of the ingredients!” He Dong paused, then continued,” “Actually, I’ve always agreed with Qingxue’s opinion. If Ling Ji F & B can find a phenomenal ingredient that can subvert the market, we can definitely turn the tables! But ...” Speaking up to here, he Dong’s tone changed and he said,” “The reason why I objected to Qingxue’s proposal the last time was not because I didn’t agree with this idea. I was completely thinking from the company’s perspective. After my field study and judgment, I feel that the partner Qingxue found has no ability to guarantee food safety. Moreover, the quality of the ingredients provided is very ordinary. It’s impossible to have a disruptive impact on the market ...” “You’re talking nonsense!” Ling Qingxue’s face turned red with anger.”You didn’t even look at it ...” “Qingxue, let Xiao He finish his words!” Ling Xiaotian interrupted Ling Qingxue’s words with some displeasure. Ling Qingxue snorted coldly and shut her mouth. She glanced coldly at he Dong, her loathing for this despicable person growing. He Dong revealed a faint smile and continued, “That’s why I’m only doing this for the sake of the public. If Qingxue is unhappy because I’m performing my duties as the manager of the procurement department, I can apologize!” Ling Qingxue sat expressionlessly in her seat. She didn’t even lift her eyelids, not reacting to he Dong’s words at all. He Dong didn’t mind and continued,” “Back to the topic just now, I actually agree with Qingxue’s train of thought. The problem is that we need to find the top – grade ingredients that can really affect the food industry of three mountains restaurant. I’ve been keeping an eye on related information, and I happened to notice a piece of news recently. I think this is an opportunity for our company!” “Oh? What’s the news?” Ling Xiaotian asked with some interest. He Dong smiled with confidence and said,” “I don’t know if any of you here have heard of the Tao Yuan brand organic vegetables?” He Dong’s words caused the group’s senior executives to start discussing in hushed voices. These two days, the Tao Yuan brand organic vegetables had been in the limelight! Ordinary people might not know, but these people in the food and beverage industry, and they were at least at the manager level, how could they not have heard? Ling Xiaotian’s eyes also lit up as he asked,” “Xiao He, are you talking about the Taoyuan brand organic vegetables launched by the West River Moon Club?” He Dong smiled and nodded,” “I think this is the real top – grade vegetable. It’s also our ...” The sound of a phone ringing interrupted he Dong’s words. Everyone looked over and saw Ling Qingxue take out her phone and look at the caller ID. Her face instantly revealed a happy expression, and she immediately stood up and walked out of the meeting room with her phone. Ling Xiaotian glared at his daughter in anger and said,” “It’s getting more and more outrageous ...” The company’s executives and managers all had strange expressions, but this was the Chairman’s family matter, so they could only lower their heads and pretend not to see it. Ling Xiaotian took a few deep breaths and said,” “Xiao He, continue!” He Dong looked at Ling Qingxue’s empty seat, then said,” “Chairman, I think if the group can reach an agreement with the West River Moon Club and buy some of Tao Yuan brand organic vegetables from them, the performance will definitely rebound! With the celebrity effect of the organic vegetables, it will definitely attract a lot of popularity!” Ling Xiaotian laughed bitterly,”little he, you didn’t see how hot these vegetables are!” Even the West River Moon Club is limited in supply, and they even put it up for auction. Do you think they’ll give us some? That’s not realistic ...” He Dong, however, said with a confident smile,””Chairman, we all know that the so – called auction and queuing are just a means of hunger marketing by the XI Jiang Moon Club. Although the peach Garden vegetables were very rare, the supply would definitely not be that small! I have an acquaintance who is in charge of purchasing at the West River Moon Club. He told me that their President Zheng is personally in charge of purchasing Taoyuan vegetables. Although he doesn’t know much about the specific situation, there is one thing that is very important to us!” “Oh? What’s the situation?” Ling Xiaotian raised his eyebrows and asked. He Dong said with a smile,”my friend told me that President Zheng has revealed that this paradise vegetable supplier has a long – term partnership with the Xijiang Moon Club. In the future, the supply will only get bigger and bigger. President Zheng is prepared to act as the agent for this brand in the future and directly sell this vegetable to the entire province!” He Dong paused for a moment before continuing.”Chairman Ling, I think that under these circumstances, we can totally do some work in the XI Jiang Moon Club. Since they’re going to sell vegetables in the future, why don’t we make the first move and reach an agreement with Xi Jiang Yue in advance?” “Moreover, the supply will increase in the future. As long as we pay enough, President Zheng might give us a small portion of the existing supply now? If that’s the case, the gimmick of paradise vegetables alone is enough to bring us a lot of popularity!” As Ling Xiaotian pondered over he Dong’s words, he nodded his head continuously. It was obvious that he agreed with he Dong’s point of view, and was moved by his words. Seeing this, he Dong’s heart also bloomed with joy. Ever since he realized that it would be very difficult for Ling Qingxue to make a breakthrough, he had begun to shift his focus and put in all his effort to win Ling Xiaotian’s favor. As long as Ling Xiaotian appreciated him, coupled with the great kindness his father had shown Ling Xiaotian, he would definitely be able to win the beauty back! His performance today had definitely increased Ling Xiaotian’s impression of him, and he Dong was both happy and proud. At that moment, the door of the meeting room was pushed open. Ling Qingxue had just finished her call and walked in. The executives and managers realized that Ling Qingxue, who had been as cold as ice a moment ago, suddenly looked radiant. There was even a faint smile on her lips. Her entire person had suddenly become bright and beautiful. Even many of the younger managers couldn’t help but be dazed. Ling Qingxue walked back to her seat and looked at he Dong, who was sitting across from her with a sneer on her face. She asked,” “If I didn’t hear it wrong, what manager he meant just now ... Is that you’re saying that Tao Yuan brand organic vegetables are undeniably the top quality ingredients?”Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m
