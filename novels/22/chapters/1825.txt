Xia ruofei nodded and thanked Feng Jing for her hard work. He then walked into the building and took the elevator to his office on the top floor.

The space here was much bigger than the office at Taoyuan farm. Xia ruofei was not used to it.

He first stood in front of the floor – to – Ceiling window and looked at the situation in the small square for a while. Then, he returned to the spacious reception area, where a full set of tea sets had been prepared. He took out a small bag of Da Hong Pao from the space and began to make tea leisurely.

The fragrance of the tea filled the air. Xia ruofei tasted the first cup of tea, and the fragrance lingered in his mouth. Then, he leaned back on the soft sofa and prepared to close his eyes to rest.

At this moment, Xia Qing, who was in the space, suddenly took the initiative to contact him with her divine sense.””Master, the heart concentrating grass has matured again!”

Xia ruofei suddenly became alert. He sat up straight and asked with his spiritual will,””Oh? How many spiritual crystals did you spend this time?”

“We’ve almost used up all five of them ...” Xia Qing said. She then continued to explain,”master, we’ve used up slightly more spirit crystals this time compared to the last time. It’s mainly because after the heart condensing grass was harvested the last time, it had grown naturally on the spirit map Island in the realm heart for a period of time. In reality, it had already recovered a little. This time, we’ll immediately start the next round of cultivation after the harvest, so ...”

“I’m fine!”Xia ruofei said. We’ve already used up so many spirit crystals, so we don’t care if we have half a spirit crystal each!”

“Xia Qing,” Xia ruofei said,”harvest the heart – concentrating grass now and start brewing the medicine!”

Xia ruofei was very anxious about Ling Qingxue’s cultivation. He planned to give Ling Qingxue a second dose of the medicine once he was done with his business here and returned to the villa.

In any case, the medicine wouldn’t go bad after it was brewed in the spirit map space. He asked Xia Qing to prepare it in advance so that he could directly use it when the time came.

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing said.

Then, Xia Qing asked again,”master, then this heart concentrating grass ... Should we transplant it to spirit map Island?” At the Archean realm, it consumes spirit Qi very quickly. Even if you remove the time array flags, you might still need to continuously use spirit crystals to replenish it ... But spirit tu Island ... Only you can go up ...”

Xia ruofei thought for a moment and said,””You should move it into the mountain and sea realm first! Without a time acceleration of thirty times, it will be able to absorb spiritual energy much slower, and we won’t need to provide it with additional spiritual energy. ”

In fact, if it wasn’t to speed up the ripening of the heart condensing grass, the best choice would naturally be to plant it in the medicine garden on spirit map Island.

Although they were both in the mountain and sea realm, the spirit map island’s herb garden was the most suitable environment for the growth of spiritual herbs. However, Xia ruofei could not leave right now, and he did not want to take the risk of entering the spirit map space in this relatively unfamiliar environment to do something like this. Hence, he could only compromise.

When he found an opportunity to enter the spirit map space, he would transplant the heart concentrating grass into the medicine garden. Although it might cause some damage to the heart concentrating grass after multiple transplants, this type of spirit grass and medicine still had a strong vitality. As long as it was not damaged to the core, it would recover in a little time.

“I know, master!” Xia Qing said. Then I’ll first move it to the mountain and sea realm, and then I’ll start to brew the medicine!”

“Mm! You’ve worked hard!” Xia ruofei said.

Then, Xia ruofei reminded Xia Qing to be careful during the transplant and to try her best to protect the roots of the heart concentrating grass.

Just as he finished talking to Xia Qing, Feng Jing’s call came in.

At this time, Feng Jing called. Xia ruofei’s heart skipped a beat. Did something happen?

“Sister ran, what happened?” he quickly answered the phone.

“Ruofei, the government office just informed us that Deputy – Mayor ni, who’s in charge of urban construction and commerce, is coming to attend our unveiling ceremony. He’s already set off from the city government. Do you think ... We should come down earlier? you’d better welcome him personally ...” Feng Jing said.

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment. He knew that the peach blossom company did not openly invite guests for the relocation of its headquarters. They mainly invited some leaders of the Bureau, bank, and District who were related to the company’s business. They did not send out invitations to the municipal and municipal level.

Deputy – Mayor NI’s uninvited arrival surprised him.

Of course, the development of paradise Corporation was obvious to all, and its value was almost two billion. It was also a well – known private enterprise in Sanshan. It was not unusual for the city leaders to attend the ceremony.

Xia ruofei’s brain worked quickly and he basically understood the reason.

During the last change of government, he had glanced at Deputy – Mayor NI’s resume, and with his memory, he naturally remembered all the information.

Deputy – Mayor ni was not a newly promoted city leader. In the previous municipal government, he was the Deputy Mayor, but his ranking was relatively low. He was mainly in charge of science, education, Culture, and health, so his authority was not particularly large.

Not long after song Qiming took office in Sanshan, the municipal government adjusted the division of labor for the Deputy Mayor. Deputy Mayor NI’s area of jurisdiction also became the popular urban construction, commercial, and other parts. Not long after, he also entered the Standing Committee of the municipal Party Committee and was the only Standing Committee member in the government besides the mayor and the Executive Deputy Mayor.

Although the adjustment of the field of jurisdiction was a government – Level matter, Xia ruofei was not naive enough to think that it had nothing to do with song Qiming, the head of the municipal Party Committee. Moreover, nI had quickly become used to it.

Therefore, Xia ruofei was not surprised when Deputy – Mayor ni showed up uninvited.

“I understand, sister che. I’ll be right down!” He said.

“Oh, yes.” Xia ruofei thought for a while and added,”sister ran, you’d better inform the district government that Deputy – Mayor ni is coming. You have to tell them in advance ...”

“Alright!” Feng Rao said. I’ll make the call immediately!”

After hanging up, Xia ruofei took the elevator to the first floor.

After Feng Rao came up to him, she smiled and said,””Ruofei, you’ve got good foresight ...”

“What’s the matter?”Xia ruofei was stunned.

“I heard that Deputy – Mayor ni was going to attend the ceremony in person, and the district government was in a mess. The district Party Committee contacted me very quickly and said that Secretary Chen had decided to attend our ceremony at the last minute, and he left immediately!” I heard that he was originally planning to go down for research, but he changed his schedule at the last minute!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”isn’t that normal?” A member of the municipal Standing Committee came here personally, but the district only had a Deputy District head. Wasn’t this too arrogant? That’s why I said we should inform them as soon as possible! Otherwise, they’ll definitely blame us!”

“Also, the district has made it clear that Deputy District head Hong’s speech will be canceled ...” Feng Jing nodded with a smile.

“With ni here, how would Deputy Mayor Hong still dare to give a speech?” Xia ruofei said,”contact Deputy – Mayor NI’s Secretary immediately and ask the Leader if he can go on stage and say a few words. If he refuses, we’ll contact the District!”

“Alright!” Feng ke said.

Xia ruofei mumbled to himself,”what the hell is this?!” Why didn’t you tell us in advance that you’re coming? isn’t this a sudden attack just adding to our troubles? How many arrangements would have to be changed? There’s also the seating arrangement, and our staff has to print the seat cards at the last minute ... Who knows how much trouble they’ve caused us!”

Feng Rao didn’t know whether to laugh or cry,”Chairman, you can just say that!” If you say it in front of those big bosses, it’ll be easy to attract hatred!”

A leader of the municipal government came to support him in person, and he still looked so proud and unwilling. If this wasn’t showing off, what was it? Although Xia ruofei did not think of it as a great honor, the key was that other people did not think so!

In fact, Deputy – Mayor NI’s sudden arrival had triggered a series of chain reactions.

In the past few minutes, Feng Jing’s phone didn’t stop ringing ...
