Xia ruofei, who now had the power to drive, sped all the way and soon arrived at Ling Xiaotian’s single Riverside Villa in the Qingjiang villa area. He jumped out of the car with a bag full of five bottles of wine and quickly walked to the door to ring the doorbell. With a click, the metal door opened automatically, and Ling Xiaotian’s voice came from the communication device,””RUO Fei, quickly come in!” Xia ruofei walked into the villa’s courtyard with a bag in his hand. Ling Xiaotian was standing at the door with a smile on his face. “Uncle Ling!” Xia ruofei greeted. “Not bad, you’re quite fast,” Ling Xiaotian said with a smile. Xia ruofei laughed in embarrassment.”Uncle Ling, I was so busy that I forgot what you asked me to do. I’m really sorry ...” Ling Xiaotian laughed and said,”we’re all a family. What’s the point of saying this?” Come in quickly!” Ling Xiaotian let Xia ruofei into the house. Xia ruofei handed the bag to Ling Xiaotian and said,””Uncle Ling, this is the improved version of Drunken Eight Immortals that I mentioned last time. It’s the kind that can be mass – produced.” “Good, good, good!” Ling Xiaotian took the bag and said happily. Xia ruofei looked around but did not see Ling Qingxue, who he had been dreaming of. He could not help but ask,””Uncle Ling, is Qingxue not at home?” Ling Xiaotian couldn’t help but laugh,”so you’ve come so quickly for that lass Qingxue!” I told you that an old man like me wouldn’t have such charm!” Xia ruofei scratched his head in embarrassment and laughed awkwardly without saying anything. Ling Xiaotian asked,”didn’t Qingxue tell you?” She’s on a business trip today!” “Ah?” Xia ruofei was a little disappointed.”Business trip?” “We’re planning to open up a secondary market,”Ling Xiaotian nodded.”We’ll open a few chain stores in some Prefecture – Level cities outside of Sanshan city. Although Qingxue is temporarily in charge of the finance department, my family business will be handed over to her in the future. Sooner or later, she will be able to take charge of everything on her own, so this time, I let her be in charge of market research. It can be considered a form of training!” After Duan Yishan, Ling Xiaotian’s good friend and the Vice – mayor of Sanshan city, fell from his position, Ling Xiaotian had been keeping a low profile. However, now that he had Xia ruofei, it could be said that the haze was gone. Naturally, Ling Ji restaurant would start to expand. “I see ...” Xia ruofei nodded and said. He was naturally very disappointed, especially when it seemed like he would have to continue suppressing his evil fire for a while. However, Xia ruofei could not show it on his face. He could only smile bitterly and shake his head. “RUO Fei, you wouldn’t blame uncle Ling for sending Qingxue out, would you?” Ling Xiaotian laughed. “No, no, of course not.” Xia ruofei quickly said. “Alright, let’s not talk about Qingxue anymore!” Ling Xiaotian said,”let me try the wine you brought!” After he finished speaking, Ling Xiaotian opened his bag and took out a bottle of wine. A rich aroma of wine filled the living room of the villa. Ling Xiaotian leaned close to the bottle and took a deep breath. Then, he said with a happy expression,””Not bad, not bad! Just the aroma of this wine alone is much more mellow and rich than the original Drunken Eight Immortals!” After he finished speaking, he took out a white wine glass from under the coffee table and filled it to the brim. Then, he picked up the glass with his thumb and middle finger, raised his head, and drank it all in one go. Ling Xiaotian closed his eyes and opened them after a while. He said excitedly,””RUO Fei, this wine is really good! Although it was less agile than the last time, the wine fragrance and taste were almost the same! I think it’s better than those high – end white wines on the market that cost hundreds or even thousands of Yuan! The taste is very unique!” “Uncle Ling, so you’re saying that there’s a reason to acquire the winery?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile. “There’s too much!” Ling Xiaotian said without hesitation,”ruofei, I won’t hide it from you. The day you came the last time, I had already ordered my subordinates to start the acquisition plan. After tasting your wine today, I’m even more certain that the decision I made that day was the right one!” “Alright! Since uncle Ling is so confident, let’s work together!” Xia ruofei agreed readily and continued,”but ... Regarding the shares, I think I should invest some money in it, or you can have more shares! It’s not appropriate for me to take half of the shares without spending a single cent ...” “RUO Fei, the technology you’ve mastered is the key to the winery’s development!” Ling Xiaotian said. It’s not a problem to take half of the shares, because without your technology, this acquisition plan is impossible ...” “This ...” “Ruofei, don’t be so modest!” Ling Xiaotian said,”don’t tell me you won’t even listen to me?” Ling Xiaotian’s words implied that he was his future father – in – Law! The daughter had not even married over yet, and the Son – in – Law was already not listening to her. “No, no... Uncle Ling, I just feel that I’m taking too much advantage of you ...” Xia ruofei quickly replied. Of course, if it was another business partner, Xia ruofei would have taken 50% of the shares for granted. However, Ling Xiaotian was different. After all, he was Ling Qingxue’s father! Ling Xiaotian smiled and said,”ruofei, my intuition from being in the business for so many years tells me that even if I only have 50% of the shares, I’ll still profit greatly from this cooperation! Alright, let’s stop fighting over the shares. Just do as I say!” “Alright then ...” Xia ruofei said helplessly,”but, uncle Ling, if the winery still needs more investment, we can invest according to the shares. We can’t let you pay for it all by yourself!” “Alright!” Ling Xiaotian also said straightforwardly,”I’ll get someone to draft the contract later. When you have time, come to my company to sign it.” “Alright!” Xia ruofei said. “Oh right, ruofei, after we acquire the winery, how are you going to produce the improved version of Drunken Eight Immortals?” Ling Xiaotian asked,”do you need any additional equipment or medicinal herbs? I’m going to put these into the budget first. ” Xia ruofei smiled.”No need for that. After the winery is acquired, we can just produce it according to the previous process.” Xia ruofei continued,”but this is a technology that my friend and I have mastered together, so the production may be a little more troublesome ... I’ll rent a warehouse in the suburbs. The winery only needs to send the produced liquor to the warehouse regularly and leave the rest to us. When we’re done with the improvement, we’ll inform the winery to bring the liquor back for bottles.” After listening to Xia ruofei’s explanation of the process, Ling Xiaotian did not feel that there was anything wrong with it. After all, this was a core technique. It was right for Xia ruofei to be cautious, so Ling Xiaotian agreed without any hesitation. “As for the initial acquisition of the winery, the design of the new packaging after production, and the release of advertisements, I won’t be in charge. You’re more experienced, so you can make the decisions.” Xia ruofei said with a smile. “No problem, just focus on the technical side!” Ling Xiaotian said. The two of them chatted about some details, and an hour or two passed before they knew it. Ling Xiaotian enthusiastically invited Xia ruofei to stay for dinner. Naturally, Xia ruofei could not reject his future father-in-law’s request. It was almost dinner time, so the two of them ate at the table. At this moment, Xia ruofei finally understood why Ling Xiaotian had asked him to bring a few more bottles of wine over the phone. It turned out that Ling Xiaotian had already prepared to drink the wine he had brought for dinner. The father and son drank the five bottles of wine one on one, and they had finished three bottles. Xia ruofei had drunk about 1.6 or 1.7 pounds. Despite his amazing alcohol tolerance, he could not help but feel a little dizzy. Since he was drunk, he could not drive tonight. Hence, Ling Xiaotian asked Xia ruofei to stay the night. Xia ruofei gave ye Lingyun a call to inform him and followed Ling Xiaotian upstairs. The room that Ling Xiaotian had arranged for Xia ruofei was Ling Qingxue’s boudoir. Xia ruofei was a little embarrassed as he declined. Ling Xiaotian laughed and said,””What does it matter? Qingxue was not home! At this time, the housekeeper, Madam Chen, had already gone back. Who ... Would prepare a guest room for you? It’s ... It’s one of us, it’s fine, it’s fine ...” Ling Xiaotian had drunk so much that his tongue was a little loose. Since he had already said so, Xia ruofei could only accept this arrangement. “Alright! Thank you, uncle Ling!” Xia ruofei smiled bitterly. “Ruofei, you ... Should rest early!” Ling Xiaotian’s footsteps were a little unsteady. His body swayed as he said,”I ... I’m going back to my room too!” “Good night, uncle Ling!” Xia ruofei said politely. After closing the door, Xia ruofei walked over to the bed with weak steps and laid on the bed. A faint fragrance assailed his nose. This was Ling Qingxue’s bed, and the sheets and blankets were the same as Ling Qingxue’s yesterday ... Xia ruofei imagined the scene of Ling Qingxue lying on the bed, and the evil fire in his heart burned even more fiercely. Xia ruofei could not help but smile bitterly, thinking,”my future father-in-law’s arrangement is really ...” Xia ruofei couldn’t sleep peacefully in Ling Qingxue’s room. He sat up and tried to do the strange pose that the little golden man had demonstrated in the spatial stone tablet ...
