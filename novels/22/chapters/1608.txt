?Chapter 1609: “Careful” consideration (1)

Before Xia ruofei reached the small villa, he heard a WeChat notification from his phone.

He took it out and saw that it was from Feng Jing. He was surprised that she had sent him a message just a minute or two ago. He had just left the room, but she had already sent him a message. Was there an emergency?

Xia ruofei clicked on the voice message with some speculation.

Feng Jing’s voice came from the phone,””Ruofei, if you don’t do anything, the company’s executive Director is going to be fired!”

Xia ruofei was stunned. He immediately exited the WeChat interface and used his phone to call Feng Jing.

“Boss Feng, what’s the situation?” Xia ruofei asked as soon as the call connected.

“Dong Yun’s research at the pharmaceutical factory has already ended,” Feng Jing said.”Even though she’s a little tempted, if you don’t take the initiative, she’ll probably leave after the research report is out ... It’s not like she’s not wanted by anyone. Who knows how many companies are offering her an olive branch!”

Xia ruofei furrowed his brows and said,”so urgent ... I’m going to the capital soon ...”

“Then come over now!” Feng Jing said,”you have to step in for this kind of thing. The others don’t have enough power!” You have to be sincere, don’t you?”

“Alright then!” Xia ruofei said helplessly.

So he turned around and walked back, and soon returned to the comprehensive office building.

Xia ruofei stood at the door of Feng Jing’s office and gently knocked on the door.

Feng Rao looked up at Xia ruofei and smiled.””Dong Yun is in the office next door. You can go there by yourself!”

Xia ruofei forced a smile and said,”the problem is, what should I tell her?” She asked to stay, but I rejected her ...”

“Times have changed!” Feng Jing smiled and said,”you didn’t want to force her to stay back then, and Dong Yun didn’t really want to stay. But from what I can see, she’s probably a little moved. If you bring it up, it’ll be different. ”

“I’ll try ...”Xia ruofei said helplessly. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Feng Jing, who was sitting behind her desk, clenched her fists and smiled at Xia ruofei.””Good luck!”

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly and shook his head. He walked towards the office next door that was specially cleared for Dong Yun.

The office door was tightly shut.

Xia ruofei knocked on the door lightly and heard Dong Yun’s cold voice.””Please enter!”

Xia ruofei pushed open the door and walked in. He saw Dong Yun typing furiously on the keyboard in front of the computer. Her attention was completely focused on the computer screen. She did not even raise her head as she said,”Please wait a moment, I’ll finish this part ...”

Xia ruofei smiled as he stood still, looking at Dong Yun who was extremely focused on her work.

From a certain perspective, Dong Yun and Feng Jing were the same type of people. They both had strong professional skills and a strong sense of business. They were both strong women that ordinary men would be afraid of.

However, there were some differences between Dong Yun and Feng Jing. Feng Jing was more easy – going and had a gentle attitude towards her subordinates, while Dong Yun was a little cold. Perhaps it was because she had been working in an international company for many years, but she was more business – like most of the time.

Xia ruofei waited for more than three minutes.

Dong Yun finally finished typing the “part” that she had said.

She pushed the keyboard lightly and raised her head.

When she saw that it was Xia ruofei who was waiting at the door, she couldn’t help but stand up and blushed.””President Xia, I didn’t know you were here ... Why didn’t you say anything?”

“I didn’t want to disturb you when I saw how focused you were on your work!” Xia ruofei laughed.

“I’m sorry!”Dong Yun said. I’m like this when I’m working. I’m sorry for being negligent just now. ”

“I’m fine, I’m fine!” Xia ruofei laughed as he walked straight to the chair in front of Dong Yun’s desk and sat down. He asked,”miss Dong, how are you feeling in paradise Corporation? Are you used to it?”

“It’s good. Everyone is very supportive of my work!”Dong Yun nodded.

“Then, how does miss Dong feel about our paradise Corporation?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

Dong Yun’s expression changed slightly. She looked at Xia ruofei and chose her words carefully before saying,””In short, President Xia has a very good team. In addition, the company’s business structure is generally very healthy and full of vitality, and the future development potential should be very great. “Of course, I have a different view on management. I’ll elaborate on the details in the research report, so I won’t say much here ...”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”it’s been hard on you these days, miss Dong ...”

Then, he asked without changing his expression,””Miss Dong, I wonder ... What are your plans for the next step?”

“I’ll probably rest for a few days after this research,” Dong Yun said with a faint smile.”After that, I’ll probably continue looking for a job!”

After saying that, Dong Yun shrugged and said,”Although I’ve been working abroad for many years, I didn’t save up much money. I spent all my money on traveling. I can’t just sit back and do nothing!”

Hearing this, Xia ruofei wanted to say something but stopped.

However, he remembered Feng Jing’s words and said,””Miss Dong, on behalf of paradise Corporation, I once again invite you to take up the position of the company’s Administrative Director ...”
