Hearing Xia ruofei’s voice, Wu Liqian’s anger instantly turned into joy. She smiled and said,””It’s RUO Fei! How long have you not called me?”

“I’m just afraid that you’ll be too busy to talk to me. ” Xia ruofei teased her and then asked with concern,””Sister Qian, what happened? Why are you so angry?”

“I’m fine!”Wu Liqian said lightly. He was just a little impatient with work! Let’s not talk about this. Is there something you need from me?”

“There’s something I need to ask you. ” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it’s hard to explain over the phone. I’ll treat you to a meal!” Are you free?”

Wu Liqian smiled bitterly and said,””I’m always free. Just tell me the time and place.”

With how marginalized she was now, no one would notice her even if she didn’t come to work for two days.

For a member of the Standing Committee and the second – in – command of the government, this was a rather abnormal phenomenon.

Of course, Xia ruofei could not detect anything from Wu Liqian’s words. Moreover, they were on the phone and could not see each other’s expressions.

Hence, Xia ruofei didn’t think too much and said,””Then let’s do it at Sixo’ clock tonight. How about Ling Ji’s private kitchen?”

“No problem!” Wu Liqian said,”I’ve long heard that this restaurant ‘s’ Buddha Jumps Over the Wall ‘is very authentic. Unfortunately, the working class can’t afford it! And it’s too difficult to make a reservation ...”

Xia ruofei laughed.”Then I’ll talk to them today. In the future, if sister Qian wants to eat ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’, you don’t have to make a reservation!”

“You’re pretty influential!” Wu Liqian chuckled.

“Hehe, that shop is my girlfriend’s family’s business ...” Xia ruofei said.

Wu Liqian was stunned for a moment. She then remembered that Xia ruofei’s girlfriend, Ling Qingxue, was the little princess of Ling Ji F & B. Wasn’t Ling Ji’s private kitchen a business Under Ling Ji F & B?

She was slightly disappointed, but she quickly smiled and said,””So it’s like this! Then I won’t stand on ceremony with you!”

“Of course, you’re welcome!” Xia ruofei said,” 6 p.m. Tonight. See you there!”

“I won’t leave until we meet!”

After Wu Liqian hung up the phone, the image of Xia ruofei’s bright and clean face appeared in her mind. Her lips unconsciously curved into a beautiful arc, and the gloominess of the past few days seemed to have been dispelled ...

The three mountains, which had just entered the night, were brightly lit.

The business of Ling’s private kitchen was as good as usual, but the quiet backyard was still very quiet.

Xia ruofei sat in front of the tea table and made a pot of Dahongpao tea. In the midst of the rising sandalwood fragrance, the unique tea fragrance of the peach Garden Da Hong Pao tea lingered in the private room, giving off a refreshing feeling.

The door of the private room was knocked gently, and then the waiter pushed the door open.

Xia ruofei looked up and saw Wu Liqian, who he had not seen for a long time, walking in.

Wu Liqian seemed to have lost some weight. Even though she had put on light makeup before going out, it still couldn’t hide her haggardness.

“Sister Qian is here!” Xia ruofei stood up and went up to him.”Come and have a cup of tea!”

Then, Xia ruofei said to the waiter,””Inform the kitchen to serve the cold dishes first. The Buddha Jumps Over the Wall soup will be served in ten minutes!”

“Alright, director Xia!” The waiter bowed and left the room, closing the door behind him.

Wu Liqian looked at Xia ruofei and smiled.””You look good! It seems like you’re Living a Good Life!”

Xia ruofei pulled out a chair for Wu Liqian like a gentleman. When she sat down, he gently pushed it in. Then, he walked around the tea table and came to the opposite side of Wu Liqian. He poured a cup of tea skillfully and placed it in front of Wu Liqian.

Xia ruofei said,”sister Qian, you don’t look well. Are you too tired from work?” You’re a leader, so don’t give yourself so much pressure! My body won’t be able to take it ...”

Wu Liqian’s heart was filled with warmth. The confusion, helplessness, anger, and a series of negative emotions she had these days were all thrown to the back of her mind. Although she had not seen Xia ruofei for a long time, she did not feel any distance from him. On the contrary, her mood had become much calmer.

“I’m fine. I just haven’t been sleeping well recently ...” Wu Liqian said casually.

“Please don’t let it be neurasthenia!” Xia ruofei said,”how about this? I’ll take your pulse later and give you a prescription to recuperate. Sister Qian, you have to know how to take care of your own body! The body is the capital of revolution. I don’t need to teach you this, right?”

“I got it!” Wu Liqian said softly and then smiled.”I’m very honored that miracle doctor Xia gave me a prescription personally! Speak! Do you need my help with something?”

Xia ruofei laughed.”Look at what you’re saying. Sister Qian, do I look like the kind of person who uses people to advance and not people to retreat?” Whether I need your help or not, you’re still my most respected sister Qian!”

Wu Liqian couldn’t help but giggle and said,””I haven’t seen you for a few months, and you’ve become a lot sweeter! It seems like your little girlfriend has taught you well!”

After Wu Liqian finished speaking, she picked up the teacup and drank it in one gulp. She praised,””Good tea!”

Almost everyone in the southeast province drank tea. As a leader, Wu Liqian naturally didn’t lack good tea. However, she was still pleasantly surprised when she drank it today.

He didn’t know if it was because of his attitude or the tea itself, but maybe it was both!

Xia ruofei smiled.”If sister Qian likes it, you can bring some with you when you leave later. These are tea leaves that we produced on our farm. They sell well on the internet.”

You grow tea on your farm?” Wu Liqian was a little surprised.”There shouldn’t be enough space!” Besides, didn’t you open up a fruit garden in that back mountain of yours?”

Xia ruofei laughed as he filled Wu Liqian’s cup of tea. He said,””I can tell that sister Qian doesn’t care about me enough! My farm is under your rule! As our parents, bureaucracy is no good!”

“Shut up!” Wu Liqian said coyly. Why don’t you tell me what this tea is about?”

Xia ruofei leaned back in his chair lazily and said,””It’s very simple! We’re working with others. They provide tea leaves, we process them, and we’re in charge of sales. We have very high requirements for the quality of tea leaves, and we also use traditional tea – making techniques. Every process completely abandons modern equipment, so the output is not too high. ”

“But the price isn’t low either!” Wu Liqian smiled and said,”it seems that I really have to go back and find out more ...”

Xia ruofei laughed,”the rarer something is, the more precious it is!” Besides, our paradise corporation’s philosophy has always been to win with quality, not sales. ”

After chatting for a while, the waiter began to serve the dishes.

Xia ruofei saw the cold dishes on the table and said with a smile,””Sister Qian, let’s talk while we eat! The Buddha Jumps Over the Wall soup will be here soon. ”

“It’s all thanks to you,” Wu Liqian said with a smile.”Otherwise, I wouldn’t be able to afford it with my own salary!”

“Sister Qian, if you want to eat ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’, I don’t know how many people are waiting in line to treat you! Isn’t it just a matter of a few words?” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”it’s my honor to have you!”

Xia ruofei did not notice the gloominess in Wu Liqian’s eyes. He invited Wu Liqian over to the dining table.

As it was only the two of them eating today, Xia ruofei had instructed the lingji private kitchen to remove the Round Table and replace it with a Chinese square table.

The two of them sat facing each other. Today, all the dishes were served separately, one for each person, so there was no need for a turntable. This square table was just right. Otherwise, there would be a distance between two people sitting at a big round table.

“Do you want some wine?” Xia ruofei asked.

“Sure! By the way, I’ve already asked the driver to go back. ” Wu Liqian said,”after dinner, you can send me home!” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

When Wu Liqian was Tian Huilan’s Secretary, she had already bought a small apartment in San Shan city. At that time, her family had to fork out some money to pay the down payment.

After she went to work in Changping County, as long as she wasn’t too busy, she would return to the city to rest on the weekends.

Although it wasn’t the weekend tomorrow, Wu Liqian had been feeling very stuffy in Changping County for the past few days. Therefore, she didn’t plan to return to Changping at night when she came out today. After she arrived at Ling Ji private kitchen, she asked the driver to go back directly.

“No problem!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I brought my chauffeur. I’ll drink with you!”

Xia ruofei had prepared fresh noble rot wine.

This kind of wine had a higher sweetness and was very easy to drink, so it was most suitable for women to drink.

He personally poured Wu Liqian some wine. Wu Liqian’s eyes were also attracted by the thick golden wine, and she couldn’t help but say,””This wine looks really good! I’ve never seen him before!”

“This is made by my winery in Australia, and it hasn’t been sold yet!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”give me your evaluation after you try it! If you like it, I can get you two bottles. This wine is more suitable for women. ”

“Ruofei, your business is getting bigger and bigger. I still remember the time you rented land to build a farm!” Wu Liqian exclaimed. How long had it been? You already have such a big business in Australia ...”

“Everyone’s improving!” Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”has sister Qian also become a leader from a Secretary?”

Wu Liqian could not help but sigh.

In fact, perhaps in terms of position, she had been promoted by one rank, but in terms of influence, the executive deputy head of Changping County was not as valuable as the Secretary of the top leader of San Shan.

Of course, it was impossible for people in politics to always work by the leader’s side. When appropriate, they would be released to gain experience and enrich their work resume. This was the necessary path for every leader to grow.

Wu Liqian didn’t regret seeking a demotion, nor did she regret choosing Changping County. If it weren’t for the recent bad things, her work in Changping County would still be promising. Coupled with her gender advantage, her political future was still very bright.

Xia ruofei could clearly feel the change in Wu Liqian’s mood.

In fact, Xia ruofei had already felt that something was wrong with Wu Liqian when he called her in the morning. After meeting her just now, Wu Liqian’s haggardness that could not be concealed further confirmed this point.

Initially, Xia ruofei did not want to continue asking about things that Wu Liqian did not want to say. However, he saw that Wu Liqian seemed to be in a difficult situation, so after a moment of silence, he asked,””Sister Qian, did you run into some tricky problem at work? Why don’t you tell me? Maybe I can help?”
