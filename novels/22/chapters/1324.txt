Chapter 1325: Chapter 792 – impending disaster (2)

Translator: 549690339

“Paradise Corporation?” Chen shun felt guilty and pretended to be confused,”what’s wrong with the Paradise company? The deal didn’t go through, but you can’t blame me for that, right? If you want to blame someone, blame their appetite for being too big, and they even colluded with Lin Zhongming ...”

“Don’t give me that!” Chen Weinan rudely interrupted Chen shun’s words,”do you know that disaster is imminent? Tell me the truth, what’s going on?”

“Second uncle!” Chen shun said stubbornly. I ... I really don’t know what you’re talking about ... What do you mean by “disaster is imminent”?”

“You still don’t admit it?” Chen Weinan said,”I’m telling you! Now the group’s Discipline Inspection department is already investigating your matter, and President Tang has even personally rushed to the three mountains. You’re only satisfied after you’ve pierced the sky!” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“What? This ...”Chen shun was dumbfounded.” How is this possible?”

“I don’t have time for your nonsense!” Chen Weinan said,”tell me honestly, how much is that batch of Cordyceps worth? Why would you provoke this company?”

Chen shun’s body couldn’t help but tremble slightly. He didn’t dare to hide anything anymore and told them everything that had happened.

Then, he immediately explained,”second uncle, this ... Even if I set a low price, at most, it’s just that you’re not familiar with the business, right?” Besides, weren’t business negotiations all like this? I’m also considering the company’s interests! How is that illegal?”

“You can explain this to the discipline Inspection team!” Chen Weinan said coldly.

As soon as Chen shun finished speaking, Chen Weinan understood everything. Who would believe that it was for the company’s interests? it was nothing more than this damn person who felt that other people didn’t pay attention to him, and the reception was not warm. He also thought that he was the purchaser and the representative of a big company, so he was making things difficult for others.

If the other party was a slightly weaker company, it would be fine even if the business deal didn’t go through.

However, the peach blossom company was obviously not a company that could be manipulated by others. Otherwise, President Tang would not have rushed to the three mountains to put out the fire.

Chen shun panicked and said,”Second uncle, what ... What should we do? You ... You have to save me!”

Chen shun’s job was enviable in Beijing. It paid well and had a lot of extra income. It was easy to have Chen Weinan’s protection. Most importantly, he had no education or ability. It was hard to be hired anywhere. At most, he could only do some manual work. But because of Chen Weinan, he not only entered the Tongren Tang chain company, but also solved the establishment problem. It could be said that he had an iron job!

If he lost his job, it would be worse than killing him.

“Now you know to be afraid?” Chen Weinan coldly snorted. Why didn’t you think of the consequences when you caused trouble! I’m telling you, it’s too late! I can’t even protect myself now, how do you expect me to save you ...”

“Second uncle, I didn’t know that the other party had such a deep background ... Please ... Please help me ...” Chen shun said with a crying face.

Chen shun was in his twenties, but he actually cried in the street, attracting the attention of passers – by.

The purchasing Commissioner, who had been shopping with Chen shun, had already understood what had happened. He looked at Chen shun with pity, but at the same time, he felt a sense of pleasure for some reason.

Chen Weinan saw that Chen shun was on the verge of a mental breakdown, so he said,”What are you howling for? Would crying solve the problem? As a man, don’t you feel ashamed?”

Chen shun wiped his tears and asked,””Second uncle, what should I do?”

Chen Weinan’s tone softened a little and said,”The only way out now is to get the understanding of paradise Corporation! As long as they give in, the group will be able to deal with it lightly!”

“I’ll go!”Chen shun quickly said. I’ll go! I’ll go immediately!”

“President Tang is probably there too,” Chen Weinan said coldly.”Your attitude must be sincere and your self – criticism must be deep. It’s best if you can give yourself a few slaps in pain!” Anyway, I’ll do whatever it takes to embarrass myself!”

When Chen shun heard this, he could not help but hesitate.

As a man of the capital, his face was bigger than the sky. If he were to humiliate himself according to Chen Weinan’s words, it would be worse than killing him.

“If you still want to keep your job, you’d better do as I say!” Chen Weinan said coldly.

When Chen Weinan talked about work, Chen shun immediately quivered and said bitterly,””I understand, second uncle, I’ll go now ...”

After hanging up the phone, Chen shun quickly walked out of the street. In the entire third workshop and Seventh Street, no motor vehicles could enter. Even if he wanted to take a taxi, he had to go to the main street outside.

The purchasing Commissioner thought for a moment, hesitated for a moment, and quickly followed.

He was relaxed when he was strolling, and he had unknowingly walked deep into the alley. Now, Chen shun was burning with anxiety, but he felt that the alley was so long. He ran all the way and was panting, but he still had not reached the outside.

Finally seeing the lights on the other side, Chen shun sped up and stopped a taxi on the side of the street. He jumped into the car and said hurriedly,””Sir, to Taoyuan farm!”

The taxi driver saw Chen shun’s ferocious face, and Tao Yuan farm was in the remote suburbs. He couldn’t help but feel nervous. This couldn’t be a robbery, right?
