2681 Trekking through the peach source Island (2)

Li Yifu pondered for a moment and said,””Martial granduncle, I can gather some people from the Hong sect. The Hong sect has spread all over the world, and many people have been close to me these years. But ... Martial granduncle, this involves the world of cultivation after all. Besides, there’s no knowing what’s in a person’s heart, and I can’t be completely sure ...”

“You only need to choose those you think are reliable.” Xia ruofei said,”I will do a second screening.”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,””Speaking of which ... You’re also a practitioner. When we have some free time, I can teach you some spiritual force techniques. It’s still very easy to use them to identify ordinary people. However, this is based on the fact that your mental power cultivation is not bad, so you must consciously train your mental power when you cultivate. You can’t neglect both true Qi and mental power. ”

“This disciple will follow senior granduncle’s teachings!” Li Yifu quickly bowed and said.

“For now, this is the main task I’m giving you.” Xia ruofei asked,”when is the earliest you can finish?”

Li Yifu pondered for a moment and said,””My initial plan is to gather all the members of the Hong sect from all over the world, then let them meet up in Australia. Then, we’ll charter a plane to come to Paradise Island in one go, so...It’ll take two to three days at the earliest.”

“Sure!” Xia ruofei said,”it just so happens that I need to confirm the details and draw a detailed blueprint. There are some other tasks that can be completed in advance. When your people come, we can link them together.”

Xia ruofei looked into the distance and said,””When the people you’ve recruited are in place, it’ll be about time for me to leave the Peach Blossom Island. I’ve been gone for too long, and the star Seizer sect will probably get impatiently ... Before I leave, I’ll give you a detailed construction plan. As long as you follow my plan and complete the transformation step by step, there won’t be any problems!”

“Alright!” Li Yifu said,”senior granduncle, I will definitely not fail my mission!”

“That’s good! I still have things to do, so I’ll be leaving first!” Xia ruofei said,”you can take a break in the afternoon. The security around the perimeter is pretty good. You don’t have to be so tense. After all, you’re not young anymore. You won’t be able to hold on for long.”

“Yes, thank you for your concern, senior granduncle!” Li Yifu said respectfully,”take care!”

Xia ruofei nodded. He got into the land Rover and drove away from the warehouse.

For the entire afternoon, Xia ruofei drove around Peach Blossom Island, surveying the area.

Sometimes, when there were no roads, he would get out of the car and walk. After arriving at a predetermined location, he would repeatedly compare the direction and terrain, and then make various marks on the map.

His footprints covered almost the entire Island, including the cliffs on the west side.

The west side of the island was filled with craggy, strange rocks, and below the cliffs were stormy waves. This side of the sea was also covered with reefs, including some hidden reefs that did not emerge from the water. Therefore, this side could be said to be a natural barrier, and ships could not approach it.

Xia ruofei even went down to the top of the cliff. There was a key point there that needed to be used to place one of the Jade pillars.

After Xia ruofei carefully compared the direction, he made slight adjustments to the points on his map. At the same time, he used his essential Qi to blast a bowl – sized hole in the cliff and stuck a branch into the rock wall to make a mark.

In fact, Xia ruofei had already marked some important points.

Xia ruofei also met the mercenaries stationed on the southern side of the island. Back then, the Liu family had set aside an area for the International mercenaries. They were in charge of the island’s defense and would not appear anywhere else on the island.

After the island changed owners, the Liu family had not ended the contract with the mercenary organization for the time being. They had also specifically instructed the person in charge of the mercenary organization to restrain their soldiers during this time and not cross the line.

Xia ruofei was sure that one of the key points was right next to the mercenary group’s base. So, even though he did not want to deal with these mercenaries, he still had to come.

Fortunately, Xia ruofei had met the leader of this international mercenary group, Jonathan. When Xia ruofei came to take over Peach Blossom Island, Liu Kuan had asked him to meet him. Hence, after Xia ruofei told them his name, the mercenaries quickly made way for him. Jonathan even came out to greet Xia ruofei.

After Xia ruofei finished inspecting the location, he was also thinking about how to start construction. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

The amount of work required at this point was not too large, and it did not even require the assistance of large machinery.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and decided to find a night to do the work himself.

Only if he took action himself would he be able to complete the work without alerting the mercenaries.

To Xia ruofei, these mercenaries were an unstable factor. If they knew that he was working on a project next to their base, there was no guarantee that they would not dig it up. So the best way was to do it quietly.

“I have to get these mercenaries to leave as soon as possible,” Xia ruofei decided.

In fact, although the South Pacific Ocean was not very peaceful, there were not many threats such as Island attacks. These mercenaries lived a relatively leisurely life on Paradise Island. As long as the array was successfully activated, the Paradise Island would definitely be safe. At that time, he could let these mercenaries go.

When Xia ruofei was done with his investigation, the sun had finally set after struggling for a while on the surface of the sea. Night had fallen on Paradise Island.

Xia ruofei drove back to the airport warehouse in the night.

As soon as he reached the door, Li Yifu stood up and said respectfully,””Martial granduncle, you’re back! You’ve worked hard ...”

Xia ruofei nodded and walked in.

“Dinner is ready, grand uncle – Master,” said Li Yifu.”Would you like to have dinner now?”

Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”you haven’t eaten either, have you?” You don’t have to wait for me in the future. When it’s time to eat, you should eat. When I’m busy, I don’t have a good time. I might not even eat. You’re already so old, you can’t suffer with me!”

“This disciple won’t be hungry either, grand uncle – Master,” said Li Yifu. Oh right, the food was sent over from the project department’s cafeteria. They only sent it to the checkpoint at the intersection, and I went to get it. In addition to dinner, I also asked them to get an Electric Stew pot. Tonight’s dinner is kept warm there!”

“Then let’s eat together! The sky is already dark!” Xia ruofei took off his coat and placed it on the chair as he said,”I’m probably going to stay up very late again tonight. Let’s eat something first! Only when you’re full will you have the strength to work!”

Li Yifu revealed a slightly ashamed expression and said,””Senior granduncle, it’s all because this disciple is incompetent and can’t share senior granduncle’s burden. Otherwise, you wouldn’t have to be so tired!”

Xia ruofei laughed,”why do you always drag yourself into everything?” Hurry up and eat!”

“Yes! Senior granduncle, please take a seat! I’ll go get the food!” Li Yifu said.

When they were eating, Xia ruofei realized that the dinner was obviously more exquisite than the lunch. Without thinking, he knew that this must be Liu Qingfeng’s special special meal.

Xia ruofei did not plan to return to the project building to rest tonight. He found two empty wooden boxes and stacked them together as a table. Then, he opened the drawings that he had taken out from the medium in advance and began to work at the table.

After half a day of observation, Xia ruofei now had a complete and accurate grasp of the entire formation. He was finally confident.

If Xia ruofei did not rest, Li Yifu would not go to sleep either. Seeing that he could not help Xia ruofei, he sat quietly at the entrance of the warehouse. While he was cultivating, he was also on guard.

At oneo’ clock in the morning, Xia ruofei’s work finally came to an end. He threw the drawing pencil on the “table” and let out a long breath. He muttered to himself,””This is my greatest asset ... It should be perfect! There shouldn’t be any problems, and I didn’t miss anything ...”
