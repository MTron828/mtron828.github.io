The commenters on the internet also became active. There were more and more jokes about paradise Corporation. Although these jokes were mostly meant to ridicule it, they objectively increased the exposure of paradise Corporation. Xia ruofei and Feng Jing naturally welcomed them. Even if there were some jokes about paradise Corporation, they just laughed it off.

The next day, there were many people on the streets discussing the peach blossom company and the jaded skin cream.

In an office building in Beijing, three white – collared women were chatting in the tea room while holding cups.

“Lili, did you see the press conference of the jaded skin cream yesterday? It sounds pretty good!”

Lily took a sip of her coffee and said with disdain,””It’s all hype! Cosmetics nowadays are mixed. I can’t believe such a small company! If you’re going to buy something, buy a big brand, the quality is guaranteed. ”

Another white – collar worker immediately expressed a different opinion.”Lili, you definitely didn’t watch the live broadcast yesterday! Even Jennifer praised the magical effect of the Jade skin cream, I don’t believe that anyone could have hired Jennifer to help him hype up the news. Her husband is a super rich man with a net worth of tens of billions!”

“Jennifer?” Lily was stunned.

“Isn’t that so?” The White – collar worker said,”I’m telling you, she’s not the only one! There’s also the Cannes Best Actress Natalie, Juliana, Helena, and Catherine ...”

The White – collar worker was counting the International stars that appeared in the video of the press conference yesterday. Lily, who was beside him, was almost petrified.

After she came back to her senses, she quickly put the cup down and said,””So awesome! I have to go and see the replay! Hurry up and send me the link to the video!”

After that, Lily hurried back to her desk.

At the University of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, Qiantang city, Jiangsu and Zhejiang Province.

A few girls were walking around the campus with books in their hands. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

One of the girls with two braids turned around and asked while walking backward,””Woof! Do you think the jaded skin cream that has been so popular these past two days is reliable?”

“With so many celebrities around, surely they can’t just lie with their eyes open!” A girl with a few freckles on her face said hesitantly,”besides, this company’s products have always been the best. My grandfather has eaten the Ironhide fengdou from paradise company before, and its effects are much better than other brands ‘fengdou!”

“Iron – Skin Kaede and skin care products are two different things!” The girl said,”this company has never produced any cosmetics before. Is it really that magical to suddenly release a new product?”

At this time, the Apple – faced girl who didn’t speak earlier suddenly said,””Stop arguing. I think this jaded skin cream is most likely reliable!”

“What do you mean?” The braided girl hurriedly stopped and asked.

The Apple – faced girl had always been well – informed. In the dormitory, she was known as an all – knowing scholar. She pretended to be mysterious and looked around, then lowered her voice and said,””Did you know? I saw Tao Jingjing using a skin care product a few days ago, but I couldn’t recognize the brand at that time. After watching the press conference of the jaded skin cream yesterday, I remembered that Tao Jingjing was using the jaded skin cream!”

“Ah? Really?” The girl with freckles on her face said,”doesn’t that mean ...”

The Apple – faced girl nodded and said,”she must have gotten the trial Jade skin cream in advance!” Think about it, what kind of person is Tao Jingjing? Her father was a high – ranking official in the capital! Even she was using the jaded skin cream, which meant that this skin care product must be extraordinary. It might even be comparable to those luxury brands that cost thousands or even tens of thousands! Otherwise, how could Tao Jingjing possibly use it?”

“That’s true! Which part of her body isn’t branded?” The girl said.

The Apple – faced girl said,”yes!” What was even rarer was that the selling price of the jaded skin cream was quite affordable. The 588 Yuan model was still affordable! I’m telling you, I’ve already made a reservation at kyokuboku mall. It’s just a matter of luck on the day of release!”

“I’ll make an appointment immediately too!”

“I’ll go too!”

......

Similar scenes played out in different places in the country. The data from e – commerce platforms such as jingbei shopping mall showed that the number of reservations for the jaded skin cream had exceeded 100000 in just one day. Even the limited edition jaded skin cream had more than 200 reservations.

Looking at the data, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel that there were so many rich people in China!

The limited edition jaded skin cream was sold for as high as 880000 Chinese dollars!

The limited edition jaded skin cream was also sold in very small quantities. The five e – commerce platforms only sold 30 copies in total.

Even though they might not necessarily buy it even if they made a reservation, the data made it clear that the cream was already popular even before it was sold ...
