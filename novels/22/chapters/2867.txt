When the referee blew the whistle to end the game, the players of Herona did not want to stay on the field for a moment longer. The humiliating defeat that would almost be written in the team history had dealt a heavy blow to their minds.

The matches of their relegation opponents had not yet ended, and some had not even started. Even so, Herona was still ranked third from the bottom. After this round, they would undoubtedly be deep in the relegation zone. Although there were three rounds left, the possibility of struggling to get out of the relegation zone was very low.

In particular, they had lost 0:8 in this round, which was a kind of devastation to the players’ confidence. They really did not know how they would play in the next three rounds.

Sometimes, a team that wanted to stay in the league just had to hold on. Once this momentum was released, coupled with the despairing number of points they had before reaching the top, there was really no way to turn the situation around.

Although in theory, there was still hope for Herona to stay in the league, anyone who understood football could see that if they wanted to watch Herona play next season, they would probably have to go to the LA Liga.

As soon as the referee blew the whistle to signal the end of the match, Xia ruofei stood up and said, ” “General manager Zhou, let’s go to the changing room together! Give the morale of the players another boost!”

“Give out some bonuses? ” Zhou leiyun asked.

“It’s a must!” Xia ruofei laughed and said, ” of course, it’s enough to increase the prize by 20% . Just take it as an early encouragement! In addition, we have to promise that if we enter the European battle, everyone will get a generous bonus! Sometimes, money is the best way to stimulate enthusiasm!”

“No problem!” Zhou leiyun said.

Xia ruofei turned to Song Wei and Ling Qingxue and said, ” “Should I get chief Zhou to send you two back to the hotel first? ”

It was not suitable for the two girls to enter the changing room. Xia ruofei did not want them to wait for him, so he wanted them to go back to the hotel first.

“Sure!”Ling Qingxue nodded. But don’t forget your promise to treat us to a big meal!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,” don’t worry!” I can’t forget! I’ll get it done tonight! General manager Zhou, please get someone to arrange for the best place! I’ll pay!”

“Then I won’t stand on ceremony ...”Zhou leiyun said with a smile.

The four of them left the room together. Zhou leiyun’s assistant came over to take Ling Qingxue and Song Wei back to the hotel while Xia ruofei and Zhou leiyun walked down the steps of the grandstand to the changing room.

This time, Xia ruofei did not deliberately hide his appearance. Moreover, the fans knew that he was in the VIP box. So, along the way, the fans beside him kept coming over to greet Xia ruofei. They were so enthusiastic that Xia ruofei felt that the muscles on his face were frozen from the smile. From the VIP box down, it took him more than ten minutes to walk the short distance.

Zhou leiyun also received a lot of warm greetings from the fans. As the club chairman, he also enjoyed the feeling of being surrounded by fans for once, which was rare. He was in a good mood.

When the two men arrived at the locker room, the Spanish players had just returned from the field to check on the fans. They were too enthusiastic.

Ruby was also in a very happy mood as he went to attend the post-match press conference. This time, the player under him was Wu Lei, who had scored two goals and three assists. He was the most eye-catching player in the game besides Xia ruofei.

Although Xia ruofei had only played half a match, he still won the best of the match without a doubt.

When mark Rocca returned with the trophy for the best single match, he happened to see Xia ruofei and Zhou leiyun at the entrance of the changing room.

Mark Rocca was holding a ball in one hand and a trophy in the other. When he saw Xia ruofei and Zhou leiyun, his face lit up with joy. He quickly walked over and greeted Zhou leiyun before turning to Xia ruofei. ” Mr. Xia, this is your trophy for the best player. And this ball was specially left for you by Wu. He went to the press conference and told me to give it to you personally! ”

Xia ruofei took the two items with a smile and said, ” “Thank you, Rocca!” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

He then said to the players,” everyone, go in and take a shower and change your clothes!” The season had entered the crucial closing stage, and he couldn’t fall sick at this time! General manager Zhou and I have good news to announce to everyone in a while.”

The players agreed and walked into the locker room.

Xia ruofei and Zhou leiyun, the two bosses, did not put on any airs. They just sat in the changing room and chatted while waiting for everyone to come out. The players all knew that the big boss was waiting outside, so they all took a shower as fast as they could, changed into dry sportswear, and quickly came out.

Coincidentally, Wu Lei and Ruby had also finished the press conference and returned to the locker room together.

Ruby saw Xia ruofei and Zhou leiyun and hastened his steps to greet them.

After politely greeting Zhou leiyun, he turned to Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei could communicate with him in Spanish. Besides, Xia ruofei was not only the boss, but also a big-time player of the Spanish team. In comparison, he naturally felt closer to Xia ruofei.

“Mr. Xia, your performance today was completely phenomenal!” Ruby said excitedly, ” most of the questions at the press conference were about you! ”

Xia ruofei smiled. ” Team Herona isn’t that strong. There’s nothing to be proud of even if we beat them. “
