Chapter 1394: Chief Executive Officer (1)

Translator: 549690339

“Two days ago, the headhunting company recommended a candidate for the Executive Director position!” Feng Jing said as she passed a resume from her notebook to Xia ruofei. She then continued,”you can take a look at the resume first!”

Xia ruofei took the resume with a smile. Before he opened it, he glanced at the photo on the cover and subconsciously frowned. “It’s a woman?”

Feng Rao was unhappy when she heard that and said,””So what if she’s a woman? What era are we living in now? you’re still being sexist?” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Xia ruofei suddenly realized that he had said something wrong. Wasn’t this lady in front of him a beauty as well? She was also a standard career woman. Many men were not as good as her in the management of the company!

“I didn’t mean it that way, sister che,” he quickly said with a smile. What I want to say is that the company’s executive Director is in charge of the daily affairs. There are more miscellaneous things and a heavier workload. If a woman were to take on the role, would it ...”

“A lot of big companies are run by women!” Feng Jing said,”women have many advantages in this position. For example, they are friendly, attentive, and so on ...”

Feng Jing couldn’t help but glance at Xia ruofei.””You should look at your resume first! If you think it’s okay, I’ll go and get in touch with them first. They might not even agree to come over yet!”

“Alright,” he said. Xia ruofei laughed drily and opened the resume.

This woman, Dong Yun, had an eye – catching resume and was comparable to Feng Jing. Yingying was also an overseas graduate and had a master’s from a prestigious University. She also had a Master’s in Business Administration from Harvard, which was a well – known brand in the world. After graduating from Harvard, he entered a well – known company on Wall Street. After that, he had been developing in the United States and had been the director of many companies.

“How is it?” Feng Rao observed Xia ruofei’s expression and asked with a smile.

Xia ruofei closed the resume and said,”it looks good ... Two questions!”

“Go ahead,”

“Firstly, there’s no doubt that Dong Yun’s resume is brilliant. However, I noticed a phenomenon. The company she’s been in for the longest time was one year and eight months, while the shortest was only one week. In the short span of five years, she’s already changed companies more than ten times.” Xia ruofei said unhurriedly,”I’m worried that she won’t be able to work for long even if she’s here. Besides, I have reason to doubt her attitude towards work.”

Feng Jing smiled.”Ruofei, I know Dong Yun a little. She’s very famous and capable. Of course, she has her own personality. Basically, she chooses her job based on what she likes and dislikes. Those jobs that she jumps to in a short time are either because she doesn’t agree with her boss’s ideals or because the environment makes her uncomfortable. Moreover, Dong Yun is a very serious person in her work. Even the company that she worked at for only a week couldn’t find any fault with her work. ”

Feng Jing looked at Xia ruofei meaningfully and said,””So, if you can recruit this general and keep her here, it will depend on your ability ...”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment, then he smiled and said,””Woof! You still want to checkmate me! Sister ran, how many bosses like me are there in the world? If even this can’t keep the talent, then it’s definitely not the boss’s problem ...”

Feng Rao was amused by Xia ruofei’s shameless words. She looked at Xia ruofei and said,””Would a good boss boast like this? Alright, alright! Let’s talk about your second question!”

Xia ruofei shrugged and pointed at the resume.””It’s very obvious! She was still in America! Besides, she hasn’t returned to the country since she graduated from her MBA. The chances of us successfully recruiting her are not high, right? Is there any meaning to it?”

“I was also surprised when I saw this resume,” Feng Jing said. However, since the headhunting company gave us this resume, it means that there’s hope for them to poach her. It’s even possible that Dong Yun herself wants to return to China to develop her career, so she revealed the information to the headhunting company. ”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”I agree in principle!” You can contact the headhunting company! Try to touch it ...”

Now, paradise Corporation was no longer the ignorant fool from before. Through the Jade skin cream, truffles, and abalone auctions, more and more people had learned about the development potential of paradise Corporation. Therefore, the dilemma of high – end talents not being willing to come at the beginning of the company’s establishment no longer existed.

The company’s HR department often received resumes that recommended themselves.

However, Xia ruofei also hoped that the company’s senior management would be excellent, so he was very careful when recruiting directors. Ordinary people would not catch his eye.

“That’s right!” Xia ruofei said,”didn’t I ask you to look for a candidate for the Vice President? Our company’s value is over one billion, how can we not have a few vice presidents? You’re basically the only one busy with the company’s matters, big and small. Your body won’t be able to take it in the long run. ”

Feng Rao felt warm inside. She smiled and said, “I’m looking for one! But you also said that it’s better to have less than enough than to have too much! How can it be so easy to find a real talent?”

Feng Jing smiled and said,””Moreover, if we can get Dong Yun to join us, she would be the best candidate for the company’s vice president!”
