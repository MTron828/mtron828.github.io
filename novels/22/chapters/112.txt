When Xia ruofei arrived at the guest room on the first floor, ye Lingyun had already finished bathing. When he saw Xia ruofei, he quickly stood up and called out,””Brother Xia.” Xia ruofei smiled and handed the plastic bag to ye Lingyun.””Take it!” “What?” Ye Lingyun subconsciously took the plastic bag. When he saw the stacks of hundred – Yuan bills inside, he put the plastic bag down as if he had been electrocuted.”Brother Xia, why are you giving me so much money?” “Use this money to pay off your debt first.” Xia ruofei said. “No way!” Ye Lingyun quickly said,”brother Xia, I haven’t even done a day’s work! How can I take so much of your money? This is not appropriate!” “I didn’t give you this money for free!” Xia ruofei said,”I’ll take it as an advance payment.” “This ...” Ye Lingyun was troubled. “What’s this and that?” Xia ruofei said angrily,”what’s wrong with a soldier being so wishy – washy? I told you to take it, so just take it!” “Yes!” Ye Lingyun puffed out his chest and said,”then ... Thank you, brother Xia ...” Xia ruofei smiled and nodded,”yes, rest early!” Go pay the money back tomorrow, then come back and work in peace!” “Okay ...” Ye Lingyun said. He then asked,”brother Xia, what exactly do I do?” Xia ruofei laughed.”The company has just been established. Are you afraid that there’s no work?” “Hehe ... I’m getting such a high salary. I’ll feel bad if I don’t work ...” Ye Lingyun scratched his head. “Don’t worry! There’s a lot of things waiting for you to do!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”the first task is to set up the security system of the entire farm! I’ve made a list before and asked the construction company to help purchase the equipment. Your first task is to ensure the quality of the security equipment. The second is to supervise the installation and debugging process. There can’t be any problems!” “Don’t worry, brother Xia!” Ye linyun puffed out his chest and said,”I promise to complete the mission!” Ye Lingyun was definitely an expert in this job, so he was full of confidence, just like how he expressed his determination to his leader in the Army. Xia ruofei smiled and patted ye Lingyun’s shoulder.””Of course I’m not worried about you! Alright, let’s rest!” With that, Xia ruofei left ye Lingyun’s room and returned to his bedroom upstairs. The next morning, Xia ruofei passed the car keys to ye Lingyun and asked him to go to the bank in the city to return the money he owed. Meanwhile, Xia ruofei completed the transaction of the vegetables supplied to the two families and then went to the construction site for a round of inspection. The main project of the entire farm was basically completed. Now, the workers were mainly doing some equipment debugging of the greenhouse, the laying of road pipelines, the installation of the farm fence, the greenery of the field area, and other finishing work. As Xia ruofei patrolled, he was also calculating in his heart. Although it was a spur of the moment decision to recruit ye Lingyun yesterday, it also served as a reminder to Xia ruofei that it was time for him to recruit some people. The company’s structure wasn’t urgent, but the farm workers had become a priority. He couldn’t take care of such a big farm alone, could he? If that was the case, he might as well plant it in the spirit map space! The experimental planting of the cabbage in the backyard was very successful. After soaking it in the petal solution, the growth rate of the cabbage in the outside world was much faster than that of ordinary species. Moreover, the taste was similar to that of the ordinary space vegetables from before, completely meeting the requirements of mass production. Xia ruofei’s initial plan was to plant these common vegetables and fruits in the outside world. His main goal was to spread the brand ‘paradise’. The precious food, herbs, trees, flowers, and the like were mainly grown in the space. The rarer something was, the more expensive it would be. It was impossible to get a lot of these high – end species at one time. Even if they were planted in the space, it was relatively easy to cover up if they took out a small amount each time. Therefore, there was no need to plant these things in the outside world. Planting them in the realm would undoubtedly increase the efficiency and quality. In fact, Xia ruofei’s spirit map space already had a lot of precious crops. The Phoebe zhennan, the ginseng from the Changbai Mountains, and the pair of Red Arowana would all bring him great benefits in the future. Xia ruofei did not want to delay the recruitment any longer. After ye Lingyun completed the transaction, Xia ruofei brought him to manager li, who was supervising the construction site. He introduced ye Lingyun to him and asked ye Lingyun to check the security system, install, and test it. Then, Xia ruofei drove the pickup truck away from the farm. On the way, he gave the Secretary of the Dongkeng village, ruan Fugui, a call and explained that he was looking for people. He also said that if there were suitable candidates in the village, he would give priority to the recruitment. Ruan Fugui was overjoyed when he heard that. He quickly said that there must be villagers who met the requirements. In this small coastal fishing village, many young people had gone out to do business or work, while many of the older generation lived in the village. Many of them were old and could no longer go out to sea to fish, so they could only idle at home. These people were actually not too old, so they would have no problem working on the farm. Not only were these people fishermen, but many of them were also experienced farmers. Hearing this, Xia ruofei immediately expressed that he would rush over immediately and asked ruan Fugui to inform the villagers that those who were interested could go to the village council. When Xia ruofei drove to the village committee of Dongkeng, ruan Fugui had already gathered many villagers to wait. The moment Xia ruofei got out of the car, he released a puff of smoke and instantly won the villagers ‘favor. Ruan Fugui lit up the Zhonghua cigarette that Xia ruofei had given him and took a deep breath before saying,””Boss Xia is here to hire workers today. Let’s welcome boss Xia’s speech!” The villagers applauded. Xia ruofei smiled and pressed his hands down.””Everyone, I’m sure you already know that I rented a piece of collective land in our village to open a farm, so we’re considered to be from the same village!” The villagers immediately laughed out loud. They felt that this boss was quite good and didn’t put on any airs. Xia ruofei continued,”since we’re family, I won’t beat around the bush. I’ll get straight to the point.” For the first batch, I’m going to recruit 15 workers. The main work will be in the field, such as planting vegetables, fertilizing, raising fish, and so on. My requirements are that they are hardworking, honest, and have farming experience. If you have any questions, you can ask me now!” “Boss Xia!” An old farmer in his 50s raised his hand like a primary school student and asked,”how much are you paying?” Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”a normal worker’s monthly salary is 5000 Yuan. There are five insurances and one housing Fund. In the future, it can be increased according to the farm’s performance and personal performance. In addition, there will be bonuses during the holidays.” The moment they heard that the salary was raised to 5000, the villagers became even more interested. One of them immediately asked,””There are five insurances and one fund? Wouldn’t that be the same as the White – collared workers in the city? Boss Xia, is your bag full of food and accommodation?” Xia ruofei smiled.”Lunch is provided on the farm. We have an eight – hour working system. Everyone works during the day and can go home at night. If they had to live on the farm, it was fine. I’ll just ask them to build a staff dormitory later. But don’t you want to go home and hug your wives?” Xia ruofei’s words immediately attracted a burst of laughter. Everyone’s impression of this young boss Xia became even better. Then, more people asked a lot of questions, and Xia ruofei answered them patiently. When he saw that everyone had understood, he smiled and said,””Alright, those who are interested in the job can go to uncle ruan to sign up! If you have any specialties, you must write them down! I’ll give you priority!” As soon as Xia ruofei finished speaking, the villagers immediately surrounded ruan Fugui and his wife. Most of the villagers were idle at home. Now, they could earn 5000 a month by working on the farm, and they only had to work during the day. The various benefits that Xia ruofei had promised were also very good. These conditions were too tempting. Who would not want to do it? “Fugui, register mine first! I know how to rear abalones!” “There’s me, there’s me! I’ve been farming for more than ten years, how can you people who go out to fish every day compare to me?” “Fugui, remember me!” The villagers didn’t know how to line up, so they just swarmed up, making ruan Fugui flustered and constantly shouting to maintain order. Xia ruofei looked at the heated scene in front of him and smiled. He walked to the side, lit a cigarette, and started smoking leisurely.
