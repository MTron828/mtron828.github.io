1985 Monica’s news (2)

Xia ruofei would not be against money. Furthermore, for a top – grade ingredient like the Taoyuan truffle, there was no clear market price. The price was completely dependent on the buyer’s judgment of the truffle’s value and his financial strength.

Even if he sold it at this price, it would be much lower than the price he set at the auction. Besides, old Blake wouldn’t do business at a loss. If he dared to buy it at this price, he must be confident that he could sell it at a higher price.

Old Blake directly took out the contract that he had prepared long ago and claimed that he was the patriarch of the Blake family. He could directly make the decision for such an acquisition, and he didn’t need to be as indecisive as Bastian.

After signing the contract, old Blake immediately called the family’s finance staff to transfer the money.

In a short while, Xia ruofei’s account had an additional 500000 euros. The total amount of the transaction was 1.5 million euros. However, Xia ruofei had already received a deposit of 1 million euros. The 500000 euros that had been transferred today was the rest of the payment.

“Mr. Xia, thank you very much!” Old Blake said excitedly,”I hope we can still maintain a good working relationship in the future! The black family will always be your loyal friend!”

“It’s a pleasure working with you!”Xia ruofei nodded.

Then, Xia ruofei pressed the bell to summon the Butler, Tony.

“Tony, prepare a luggage cart and help Mr. Blake to bring this box back to his room!” Xia ruofei said.

The truffles and the box weighed at least 80 kilograms. Old Blake was not young, so it was a bit difficult for him to carry the box back.

“Alright!” Tony bowed slightly and said,”please wait a moment ...”

Tony turned around to look for a luggage cart. Old Blake expressed his gratitude to Xia ruofei again and said,””Mr. Xia, I would like to treat you to lunch to express my gratitude. I’ll be bringing the truffles back in the afternoon, so please do come!”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and nodded.””Good! Thank you for your kind invitation!”

” 12:30, Jiahua Western restaurant on the third floor of the hotel, see you there!” Old Blake was overjoyed.

“I won’t leave until we meet!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

He knew that old Blake must have frozen the truffles first, or he would invite him to a Western restaurant instead of 12:30. After all, it was almost time for lunch.

Tony quickly found a cart and helped old Blake to carry the heavy box back to his room.

Xia ruofei continued to watch the movie. When it was almost time, he walked out of the Presidential Suite and took the special elevator to the Jiahua Western restaurant on the third floor.

The waiter brought Xia ruofei to a private room by the glass window. Old Blake had already arrived at the restaurant. He stood up to welcome Xia ruofei warmly.

The two of them sat down after exchanging a few words.

This was a very good seat with a wide view. Although it was only on the third floor of the hotel, there were no other tall buildings blocking this side of the hotel, and one could see Victoria Bay in the distance.

The two of them ordered a few dishes, but neither of them chose foie gras. Old Blake had already formed a habit, but Xia ruofei was still traumatized.

The two of them chatted as they ate, occasionally taking a few sips of red wine. The atmosphere was very harmonious.

While they were chatting, Xia ruofei suddenly had an idea. He asked,””Mr. Blake, there’s something that I’ve always been puzzled about. I remember that we invited the Grasso family, but I didn’t see anyone from the Grasso family at this auction. Do you know the reason behind this?” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Mr. Xia, you’re asking about Monica, right?” old Blake smiled.

Old Blake had already investigated the reason behind the conflict between his grandson, George Blake, and Xia ruofei. He knew that the two of them had quarreled because of Monica in Shen Cheng city. George Blake, who was always vengeful, had been holding a grudge, which led to the subsequent events.

Therefore, old Blake also guessed that Xia ruofei and Monica’s relationship was not ordinary.

“Monica and I are pretty good friends.” Xia ruofei said indifferently.

Old Blake nodded and said,”Xia, your friend might be in a little trouble recently ... To be exact, the Grasso family is in trouble.”

“Oh? What was going on? Mr. Blake, can you tell me about it?” Xia ruofei asked, frowning.

“Of course, no problem!” Old Blake said,”as far as I know, the Grao family was involved in the dispute between the Italy mafia families. Unfortunately, the small Mafia family they supported lost in the battle, so ...”

At this point, old Blake shrugged his shoulders and said with a trace of regret,””They’re not having a good time now! The Mafia family they supported had already fallen apart and was unable to provide them with the protection they deserved. “The Mafia family that controls that area will naturally not be polite to the Grao family that supports them. Now that the Grao family’s business has taken a nosedive, many of their original business partners have chosen to leave ...”

Xia ruofei frowned. He had not contacted Monica for a long time. He did not expect the situation of the Grasso family, where Monica was, to be so bad.

He knew that in many parts of Italy, the power of the Mafia families could be said to be overwhelming, and even the government could not do anything to the Mafia Godfather.

In fact, the Mafia and the Italy government were inextricably linked. There were many high – Level mafia families in politics. They were not only the underground rulers of their respective areas, but also had a great influence on the official level.

According to old Blake’s description, the Grasso family had probably become the victim of the competition between the Mafia.

It seemed like Monica’s days weren’t going to be good!

Xia ruofei was a little worried.”Mr. Blake, the Grao family runs the truffle business. Why would they support the Mafia families and even get involved in the competition between the Mafia families?”

Old Blake shrugged and said,”the head of the Grao family is in his Prime. He is eager to make the Grao family more glorious under his leadership. That is why he chose to join the Moore family. Without the support of these ancient families in Italy, it is very difficult to expand the business.” “It’s just that his luck wasn’t too good, or perhaps it could be said that his vision wasn’t too good. The Moore family appeared strong on the outside but was actually weak on the inside. In just a few months, they were defeated by their competitors ...”

Old Blake paused, took a sip of red wine, and continued,””The Grao family’s financial support to the Moore family is huge. Otherwise, the Moore family wouldn’t even be able to last for a month before being devoured by their opponents. “It was because of their support that the Moore family was able to hold on for a few more months. It was also because of this that the Gelman family suppressed the Grasso family after they took control of the situation.”

“I see ...” Xia ruofei took a deep breath and said,”thank you for telling me this, Mr. Blake!”

“You’re welcome,” old Blake said with a smile.”It’s not a secret in Italy. It’s easy for you to get the information.”

Xia ruofei nodded. He was no longer in the mood to enjoy his meal. He just wanted to call Monica as soon as possible to ask about the situation over there and if he could help.

Old Blake could tell that Xia ruofei was in a bad mood, so he suggested to end the dinner after a while.

They walked to the entrance of the restaurant. When they were saying goodbye to each other, old Blake suddenly remembered something and said,””Oh right, Mr. Xia, I heard that Monica has gotten into some new trouble recently ...”
