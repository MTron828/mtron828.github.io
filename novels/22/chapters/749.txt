Chapter 750: Wailing ghosts and howling wolves (2)

Xue Fei had obviously checked out the location beforehand. There were already two female bullies waiting in the washroom on the right. They were the two women Xue Fei had met at the octagonal teahouse yesterday.

Xia ruofei used his spiritual power to control the Hornet after seeing Lin Qiao walk to the right. Other than the one that followed Lin Qiao, the other Hornet with the camera flew to the bathroom ahead of them.

Lin Qiao was dizzy and her steps were unsteady, so the bees quickly left her behind.

The leading Hornet had a super – miniature camera on its body. Xia ruofei was like a super – Drone controlling the Hornet to follow behind it.

The only difference was that Xia ruofei did not use radio waves to control it. Instead, he used his spiritual power.

Soon, the bee colony arrived at the bathroom.

Xia ruofei saw that the four cubicle doors were left ajar. It was obvious that no one was using the toilet. In fact, all the private rooms in the nightclub had bathrooms, and not many people were using the public ones.

However, there were two people in the bathroom.

Xia ruofei recognized them at a glance. They were the two women that Lei Hu and the others had taken pictures of at BA Fang teahouse. They were with Xue Fei and Hu Lili.

The two bullies with dyed hair were leaning against the sink and smoking. Since there was no one else in the bathroom, the two of them were chatting without restraint.

Xia ruofei directed the swarm of bees to the outermost cubicle and hid inside the water tank.

The Hornet with the Super – miniature camera flew to the corner and clutched the ceiling tightly. The camera was aimed at the two smoking hooligans.

One of them had dyed his hair yellow, while the other had dyed his hair green. They looked like parrots when they were put together.

......

Xia ruofei fiddled with the computer and adjusted the sound source to the camera.

The two’s conversation could be heard through the earpiece.

“Hong Mei, how much do you think brother Fei can give us?” The green – haired delinquent asked.

The yellow – haired young female delinquent named Hong Mei took a puff of her cigarette and said,”There must be at least a few thousand, right? Li Li said that this brother Fei is quite generous. ”

“Yup!” The green – haired delinquent said,”when Lili used to hang out with us, she was like a poor B * stard. I never saw her take the initiative to pay the bill when we went out to drink. Ever since she got together with brother Fei, look at her now, she was covered in branded goods! Even the way you speak is different!”

Hong Mei pouted and said,”Qiqi, you little hussy, are you also interested in that brother Fei?” You can go too! I don’t think you’re worse off than Lili. At least you have more capital here than Lili. Brother Fei almost drooled when he saw it yesterday ...”

After saying that, Hong Mei frivolously reached out and touched Qiqi’s chest, her smile very ambiguous.

Qiqi didn’t mind and laughed,””That makes sense. As long as the hoe is swung well, there is no corner that can not be dug down ...”

After the two of them teased each other, Hong Mei said,””Alright, stop fooling around. That girl is coming. Do you remember what she looks like? Don’t get the wrong person ...”

“Don’t worry! The picture Lili sent is in my phone. ” Qiqi said,”at most, we’ll just take them out and match them later!”

“En!” Hong Mei nodded. Don’t leave any marks when you do it. I heard from Lili that brother Fei wants to taste this girl’s body tonight!”

“F * ck! Li Li can tolerate this?” Qiqi said.

“Nonsense! So what if he couldn’t bear it? I heard that brother Fei’s father is a big leader in the city. He was just playing with Lili, who would take it seriously!” Hong Mei curled her lips and said,”you do it later. I’ll record it!” Also, it’s enough to just teach her a lesson. Our main task is to take her to the private room upstairs without attracting any attention!”

Qiqi nodded and threw the cigarette butt on the floor.

Seeing this, Xia ruofei’s chest was already burning with anger. He had basically understood Xue Fei’s vicious plan.

At this moment, Lin Qiao was only five or six meters away from the bathroom. Xia ruofei’s mind flickered, and the ten Hornets that were hiding in the toilet cubicle flew out.

The two bullies were still planning what to do when they suddenly heard a buzzing sound. They turned around subconsciously and saw more than ten Hornets pouncing toward them. They immediately turned pale and couldn’t help but scream.

Hong Mei’s reaction was fast. She subconsciously picked up her handbag and waved it.

However, how could these strong Hornets be hit by her random waving? In fact, after Xia ruofei had given the order to attack, he no longer needed to control the ten Hornets. He just quietly watched the images sent back by the camera on the last one.

In the blink of an eye, the hornet’s bees had already arrived in front of the two of them. Facing Hong Mei, who was waving her handbag, the hornet’s bees nimbly drew an arc and quickly approached from the side.

The next moment, the two bullies let out tragic wails. Ten Hornets were distributed equally, and each of them got five.

Now, each of them had five Hornets on their heads and faces. Their stingers quickly pierced into the skin of the two men, and the toxins in their bodies were immediately injected into their bodies.

Hornets were different from ordinary bees. Their stingers did not have backstingers.Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))
