3080 Wild tea on a Lone Peak (2)

The five flying swords that layman Yuntai had placed in the hidden space of the ring should be his proud works.

Xia ruofei gave the pair of flying swords, autumn water and Yiren, to Song Wei and Ling Qingxue respectively. He gave the black gold to Li Yifu.

This time, Xia ruofei took out the “blazing flame” that he had prepared for Tang Haoran.

Tang Haoran was too young, and Xia ruofei was not at ease to leave the flying sword in his hands. Hence, this “blazing” flying sword had always been in his spirit map space.

This sword was most suitable for Tang Haoran, who cultivated the Yang cultivation method.

However, it was not a problem for Xia ruofei to use it to control his sword.

The moment this blazing flying sword was revealed, Chen Xuan’s eyes lit up as he exclaimed,””Good sword! Brother Xia, this flying sword of yours is definitely a rare quality! It’s just that ... I’ve never heard of this sword in the world of cultivation!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”this was given to me by an elder.” It’s said that ... This flying sword came from an ancient cultivator’s ruin, so it shouldn’t have appeared in the modern cultivation world before. It’s normal that brother Chen hasn’t seen it before!”

Xia ruofei’s words were mostly true. To Chen Xuan, it was reasonable so he did not have any doubts.

“Brother Xia, may I know the name of this sword?” Chen Xuan asked.

One could tell that Chen Xuan was a sword fanatic as well. The moment the blazing flying sword appeared, his eyes were glued to it.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”this sword is called blazing flame. It’s most suitable for people with yang – Type physiques or people who cultivate yang – Type techniques. However, it was given to me by my elder. Although it’s not particularly compatible with me, I can only use it like this for now.”

“I believe your master has other intentions.” “Brother Xia,” Chen Xuan said immediately,”it’s never wrong to listen to your elders!”

“Hahaha! Brother Chen looks like the kind of person who’s always been an obedient baby!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”but brother Chen is right. We must listen to the elders when it comes to flying swords.”

“Brother Chen, can we go up now?” Xia ruofei asked. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Chen Xuan slapped his forehead and smiled bitterly.””Brother Xia, please forgive me. When I saw such a good sword like blazing flame, I almost forgot about my business!”

“If it’s not a gift from an elder, I don’t mind giving this sword to brother Chen!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“I can’t do that! I don’t dare to accept it!” Chen Xuan chuckled as well.”Brother Xia, let’s go!”

Xia ruofei nodded. Then, the two of them jumped onto their flying swords at the same time. They activated their sword techniques and stepped on their flying swords to soar into the sky.

Chen Xuan even took the time to observe. After all, he only knew that Xia ruofei was also in the early golden core stage. However, there was a huge difference between the early golden core stage cultivators. Some people could not even master Sword Kinesis flight, but they were both in the early golden core stage.

Therefore, Chen Xuan had intentionally slowed down his speed. He was worried that Xia ruofei had just entered the Golden core stage and was still not familiar with the control of the flying sword.

However, Chen Xuan soon realized that Xia ruofei was able to keep up with his rhythm easily. He was able to control the flying sword steadily and from his expression, he could tell that he still had some energy left!

Only then did Chen Xuan pick up his speed.

Then, he realized that no matter how he changed his speed, Xia ruofei could keep up with his rhythm and easily maintain a constant distance from him.

Chen Xuan gave Xia ruofei a thumbs up and said,””Brother Xia! The level of a Yuanying stage personal disciple is indeed worthy of its reputation!”

Xia ruofei smiled and did not deny Chen Xuan’s words. Of course, he would not admit it either.

Chen Xuan brought Xia ruofei around the lone Peak on his flying sword. They arrived at the back of the peak and continued to rise.

In fact, Xia ruofei had already seen the wild tea trees when he turned to this side.

Because the entire Lone Peak was almost barren, on the cliff wall near the peak, a tree suddenly appeared, naturally it was quite conspicuous.

On this Lone Peak, there seemed to be only one remaining plant, so Xia ruofei was very sure that it was a wild tea tree, even though this tree was different from the “tea tree” that Xia ruofei was used to knowing.

The wild tea tree was bigger than Xia ruofei had expected.

Most tea trees were small, but the one in front of Xia ruofei was more than 20 meters tall. Its trunk was at least as thick as three people hugging it.

This was already a “big tree” in the true sense of the word.

This feeling was especially obvious when the two of them flew closer and closer, and when the huge tea trees hit their faces.

Xia ruofei had never seen a tea tree that could grow so big. This had completely subverted his understanding.

This tea tree grew on the precipice, and there was no path on the cliff at all. Ordinary people would not be able to come up even if they were not blocked by the array outside. No wonder Chen Xuan had previously told Xia ruofei that the person in charge of the maintenance of the wild tea trees was a golden core elder. An ordinary Qi refining disciple like Tao Wu could not do the job! It was difficult to even get close to the wild tea trees.

Xia ruofei finally understood why Chen Nanfeng and Chen Xuan were so generous, especially Chen Xuan. He was so straightforward on the airboat! He agreed to give Xia ruofei two branches without thinking and directly went to the scene to pick!

This wild tea tree was so huge and had many leaves. Taking one or two branches was no doubt a drop in the ocean.

Very quickly, Chen Xuan and Xia ruofei were standing on their flying swords and stopped in front of the wild tea tree.

Chen Xuan smiled and said,”brother Xia, you can choose!” As long as you don’t cut down this tea tree and take it away, it’s fine!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.””This is your first heaven society. If I really dare to do that, won’t you just skin me alive?”

As Xia ruofei spoke, he had already released his spiritual power.

Under the investigation of his mental energy, this wild tea tree could basically be said to have nowhere to hide.

All the details were under control.

Xia ruofei could clearly feel that this tea tree was full of vitality. It even surpassed some of the plants he had planted in the spirit map space.
