Chapter 1638: The power of the array (1)

Xia ruofei laughed,”brother Zhao, don’t you worry!” Since I can activate the formation, I can naturally dispel it. As for the negative effects you mentioned, facts speak louder than words. They’re nothing to be worried about!”

What Xia ruofei didn’t say was that not only could he dissolve the formation, but he could also turn the yin formation into a yang formation. The entire plot of land would be covered in a natural formation. By then, not only would there be no negative effects, but it would also make those who were trapped in the formation feel inexplicably happy, as if they were bathing in a spring breeze.

At that time, people would subconsciously want to visit the club again, and it would be difficult for the club’s business to not be good. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Of course, if they stayed in the club for a long time, it would be good for their health.

For cultivators like Xia ruofei, it was even easier to cultivate in the array.

Of course, Xia ruofei didn’t need to explain it. He could just use the facts to explain.

Zhao Yongjun trusted Xia ruofei a lot and was no longer worried.

Everyone talked about the strange situation when the formation was activated. Zhao Yongjun couldn’t help but be amazed. He couldn’t help but ask song Rui what it felt like to be inside the formation.

Song Rui couldn’t help but shiver. He didn’t want to continue this topic.

Zhao Yongjun thought it was strange, but song Rui refused to say. Xia ruofei just laughed and changed the topic, so he didn’t ask further.

It was already four or FiveO’ clock in the morning when he returned to the courtyard house in liuhai Lane.

Zhao Yongjun got out of the car and yawned,””I’m going to catch up on sleep! Ruofei, don’t make me eat breakfast! I’m going to sleep until noon!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”brother Zhao, Wu Qiang, you guys should go and rest! Song Rui, come with me, I need to talk to you about something!”

Song Rui was already in a dilemma. He was really scared out of his wits. Even if they were in Xia ruofei’s courtyard house, he did not dare to stay in a room alone.

But he couldn’t say who he was going to stay in the same room with.

There were so many rooms here, how comfortable would it be for one person to live in one room? If song Rui were to make such a request, people might even suspect that he had a sexual orientation problem.

Therefore, after hearing Xia ruofei’s words, song Rui was more than happy to do so and quickly nodded in agreement.

After sending Zhao Yongjun and Wu Qiang back to their rooms, Xia ruofei brought song Rui to the second courtyard.

He didn’t enter the house directly, but looked at song Rui with a smile and said,””I didn’t think this through ... I didn’t expect that the moment the array was activated, there would be such a powerful mental attack. If I knew this would happen, I would’ve done it myself!”

Xia ruofei did not lie. He had only wanted to tease song Rui. He did not expect to play with Dafa, which left a huge psychological shadow in song Rui’s heart.

Of course, this also had to do with song Rui’s poor physique. If it was Wu Qiang or even Zhao Yongjun, they might not be so unbearable.

Song Rui said dejectedly,”you’re so bad!” Every time I close my eyes, I’ll see those terrifying scenes. I don’t even dare to sleep alone ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”it’s not that serious. It’ll be fine after a while!” Wasn’t it the same when they watched horror movies when they were young? At most, I’ll be afraid for a few days, and I’ll be fine slowly ...”

“I hope so!” Song Rui said dejectedly.

“Song Rui!” Xia ruofei suddenly called out.

Song Rui raised his head subconsciously and said,””Ah?”

When his eyes met Xia ruofei ‘s, he suddenly lost his focus.

It was as if Xia ruofei’s eyes had turned into a deep lake. His mind was trapped in it and he could not break free.

Then, song Rui seemed to have lost his self – consciousness and just stood there blankly.

Xia ruofei continued to use his spiritual power, and his voice seemed to have a trace of magic.””Everything you saw tonight was an illusion. It was just your inner demon. Now, your inner demon has been eliminated, all eliminated ...”

Song Rui nodded unconsciously and said mechanically,””The inner demon has been destroyed ...”

This was a relatively simple application of mental power. It could implant such an obsession in the depths of song Rui’s consciousness and eliminate the mental trauma to the maximum extent.

In fact, this was very similar to hypnosis, but after using mental power, the effect was many times better than most hypnosis.

Xia ruofei kept instilling positive and positive emotions into song Rui. Finally, he snapped his fingers in front of song Rui and shouted,””Wake up!”

Xia ruofei’s voice had a strong penetrating power. Song Rui’s body trembled slightly, and his eyes quickly regained their clarity.

He couldn’t remember what had happened in the past one or two minutes. He didn’t even realize that he had been deeply hypnotized.

Therefore, song Rui’s consciousness was still stuck before he entered the deep hypnosis state. He asked,””RUO Fei, why did you call me?”

“Oh, it’s nothing,” Xia ruofei said,”I just wanted to remind you that you must keep today’s matter a secret. Don’t accidentally leak it out!”

“Don’t worry! I can still distinguish the severity of this!” Song Rui said.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””That’s good! You’ve been tired for the middle of the night, so you should quickly find a room to rest! Let’s all sleep in tomorrow!”

“Alright!” Song Rui said casually.
