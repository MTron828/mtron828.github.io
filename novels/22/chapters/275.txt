Chapter 276: An expert makes a move (1)

The next morning, Xia ruofei, song Rui, and manager Lu accompanied elder song for breakfast. Then, the group of people got ready to set off. Manager Lu’s ticket for the high – speed rail was at around 9 am. It would take at least 40 to 50 minutes to get to the North train station in the city. Manager Lu arranged for a modified bullet – proof GMC RV. Manager Lu followed elder song into the car. Just as Xia ruofei was about to get into the car, he saw song Rui get into the RV with a bag. “Song Rui, you are also going to Wu Yi mountain?” Xia ruofei asked in surprise. “What are you saying? my mission is to accompany Grandpa!” Song Rui smiled and said,”grandfather is going to Wuyi Mountain. Of course, I have to follow him.” “What’s the matter?”song Rui asked. “It’s nothing,” Xia ruofei said indifferently.”You’re just adding on to my workload!” “Tsk! It’s obviously to reduce your workload, okay? This young master is highly skilled in martial arts. Not only can I take care of myself, but I can also protect my grandfather!” Song Rui scoffed at Xia ruofei’s contempt. Xia ruofei and Xu Wu looked at each other and rolled their eyes at the same time. Song Rui was not convinced and said,””Don’t doubt me! I have a few good friends there. When Grandpa went to Mount Wu Yi this time, I coordinated and arranged a lot of the local schedule!” “Hehe!” Xia ruofei said. “Let me tell you, with me around, you don’t need to worry so much. Do you know how powerful my friend is in the local area?” “Hehe!” “Hehe, your sister! Can’t you change the words?” “Ha!” Song Rui was so angry that he wanted to fight with Xia ruofei. At this time, elder song, who was sitting in the car, said calmly,””Xiao Rui, are you getting in the car? Don’t block the door if you’re not getting in, Xiao Xia and Xiao Xu still want to get in!” “I’m coming, I’m coming ...” Song Rui quickly responded. Then, he bared his teeth at Xia ruofei and quickly got into the car. Xia ruofei and Xu Wu looked at each other, shook their heads, and smiled. They also got into the car. The bullet – proof RV started steadily and drove out of guling courtyard. It drove down the steep mountain road and then entered the city through the exit near the North train station on the winding express. They arrived at the North train station and got off the train. Xia ruofei’s mission had officially begun. The bus that sent them to the station returned, and the five of them went straight to the station. Other than elder song and song Rui, manager Lu was in charge of all the arrangements and coordination of the trip. Xu Wu was in charge of security. Xia ruofei was in charge of security and was also elder song’s doctor. Although the market took public transport, manager Lu had booked business class seats, so they went straight to the VIP waiting room at the station after they got off. Xu Wu was very nervous when he got off the car. Because the square in front of the station was full of people from all walks of life, it was too much pressure to protect the Bureau chief’s safety in such a complicated environment. However, he soon realized that Xia ruofei was still very calm. Xu Wu also noticed that Xia ruofei’s positioning was very particular. Although he was not very close to elder song, he could tell that Xia ruofei always stood in the most suitable position. Xu Wu was an expert himself, so he naturally had this insight. Xia ruofei had chosen the best position to deal with emergencies. For example, there was a high point behind him when he got off the car. Xia ruofei’s position was just enough to block elder song’s back. Even if there was a sniper on the roof, he would not be able to lock on to the target. Elder song’s position was constantly changing, and Xia ruofei could also make adjustments at the right time. When they were walking up the steps of the square, a naughty child rushed over from the side and almost hit elder song. Xia ruofei was the first to step forward and held the child back. Xia ruofei smiled and reminded the child to be careful. He then handed him over to his parents. Even during this process, Xia ruofei still maintained a very good position. If there were any other situations, he could still handle them with ease. Xu Wu, who had been silently observing, couldn’t help but feel a bit of admiration. Lone Wolf’s elite team members really lived up to their reputation! Xu Wu thought to himself. Seeing Xia ruofei’s calm and composed performance, Xu Wu’s slightly nervous mood quickly eased. The group of people successfully entered the VIP waiting room. Xu Wu’s hanging heart was also half relieved. He took a look at the terrain and personnel situation here. It was much simpler than the square before the station. Soon, it was time to check the tickets and board the train. The price of a high – speed rail business class ticket was even higher than an air ticket, so there were generally not many passengers who would buy business class tickets, and business class passengers also had their tickets checked in advance. Therefore, the whole process of entering the station was quite smooth, and the group quickly got on the harmony train. The business class coach was very spacious. There were a total of eight rows, and each row only had three seats. Each seat was a sofa – Type, very soft, and the seats could be rotated. There were special buttons on the seats that could adjust the inclination of the seats and could be stretched to become a recliner. Manager Lu had reserved seats in the first and second rows. There was a glass partition in front of the first row. After it was powered on, it became transparent, allowing one to clearly see the situation in the cockpit. According to Xu Wu’s plan, elder song naturally couldn’t sit by the window for safety reasons. Hence, Xia ruofei sat in the first row by the window, while elder song sat beside him. In the same row, there was an individual seat across the aisle, and Xu Wu sat there. Manager Lu and song Rui were seated in the second row. Such an arrangement would ensure safety to the greatest extent. Soon, the train slowly left the North train station of Sanshan city and headed north. In contrast to Xu Wu’s nervousness, elder song had been very calm. It had been a long time since he had experienced such “freedom.” Every time he went out, he would be surrounded by security and people. After a long time, he felt that he had lost all freedom. This trip was also a very special experience for elder song. From the moment he got on the car, he touched and looked around with interest, feeling that everything was new and fresh. Xia ruofei, who was sitting beside elder song, kept observing the situation around him. He only relaxed a little when the train picked up speed. On the high – speed train that was traveling at three to four hundred kilometers per hour, the external threats were almost negligible. He only needed to pay attention to the situation inside the train. The business class was isolated from the other cars, and there were only a few passengers in this car, so the security pressure was relatively low. It was obvious that elder song was in a good mood and was even a little excited. He was very talkative along the way and talked about the local customs of Wuyi Mountain. Xia ruofei guessed that elder song must have a deep relationship with Wuyi Mountain. A short while after the train set off, a beautiful and tall female attendant came to the first row. Xu Wu subconsciously sat up straight and looked alert. This was his professional habit. Almost reflexively, as long as a stranger approached the target to protect him, he would first assume that the person was a threat to the target and had to react at any time. Since they were travelling in civilian clothes, it was naturally impossible to review the train attendants in advance, let alone arrange for reliable service personnel in advance. All of this could only be judged by Xu Wu and Xia ruofei’s risk prediction. Although Xia ruofei did not seem to move, he reacted even earlier than Xu Wu. He tensed up his muscles immediately. The flight attendant naturally didn’t know that if she showed any signs of being disadvantageous to the old man in front of her, the two masters would both attack her. She squatted down slightly to keep her height at the same level as elder song and Xia ruofei. She smiled and asked,””Gentlemen, what kind of drinks and snacks would you like? Also, what set meal would you like for lunch and what time would you like to have it?”DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎
