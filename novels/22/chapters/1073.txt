Translator: 549690339

This time, Ma Zhiming came alone. After all, this kind of thing was a little hard to say, and Tian Huixin would also feel a little embarrassed.

Xia ruofei warmly welcomed Ma Zhiming into his small villa.

After a brief introduction to Hu Zi’s mother and Lin Qiao, Xia ruofei brought Ma Zhiming upstairs.

“Mr. MA, it’s not a big problem. It’s similar to my judgment.” After Xia ruofei took Ma Zhiming’s pulse seriously, he smiled and said,”don’t feel any psychological pressure. You should be able to recover after taking the energy gathering pill for two weeks.”

“Elemental gathering pill?” Ma Zhiming asked.

Xia ruofei smiled as he took out a porcelain bottle and handed it to Ma Zhiming. He said,”This is a Traditional Chinese Medicine honey pill that I secretly made. It’s more effective in treating your illness.”

Ma Zhiming quickly and carefully put away the porcelain bottle. He had no doubt about Xia ruofei’s words.

“Xia Sheng, are there any precautions to take when taking this energy gathering pill?” Ma Zhiming asked with concern.

“Three pills a day,” Xia ruofei said,”take it with warm water after dinner.” Things to take note of ... Nothing else, but it’s best not to have sex during the treatment. Er ... I suggest that you and aunt Huixin sleep in separate rooms for the next two weeks. ”

Xia ruofei was very clear that after taking the energy gathering pill, it would stimulate one’s physiological functions. The desire in that area would be stronger than usual. During the treatment, it was best not to have any sexual activities, or it would affect the effect.

So, this could be considered a side effect that was neither big nor small!

Although Ma Zhiming was a little embarrassed after hearing that, he still kept it in mind. He nodded and said,”Alright, I got it.”

To be honest, Xia ruofei still felt weird about treating an elder in this aspect. After he had explained everything, he felt much more relaxed.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”that’s all. Under normal circumstances, your body will recover completely after this treatment. If you have any more problems, just give me a call.”

“Thank you, Xia Sheng!” Ma Zhiming said sincerely.

Then, he hurriedly took out a check and handed it to Xia ruofei with both hands. He said,””Xia Sheng, this is the consultation fee I prepared. It’s also a small token from Huixin and me ...”

Xia ruofei pushed the check back and said seriously,””Mr. MA, I’ve said that these pills are my gift to you. I can’t take the money.”

“How can we do that?” Ma Zhiming said anxiously. Even the most famous Urology expert in Hong Kong couldn’t find a problem with this disease. If it wasn’t for Xia Sheng’s kind heart, I ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Mr. MA, why are you treating me like an outsider again?” If that’s the case, what about our company’s auction last time? What about the Presidential Suite that I stayed in with CEO Feng in Hong Kong?”

“This ...”

“Mr. MA, this is my gift for our first meeting.” Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”it’s the same as the tea leaves I gave to old master Ma, the Jade skin cream from aunt Huixin, and the jade pendant from Huanhuan. It’s all a token of my appreciation. Do you think I can accept your money?”

Seeing that Xia ruofei had put it this way, Ma Zhiming knew that if he insisted on paying, it would hurt their relationship.

He helplessly put away the check and said, touched,””Xia Sheng, since you’ve said so, I won’t regard you as an outsider anymore ... In the future, if there’s anything that you need me or the MA family to do for you, please don’t stand on ceremony with us!”

“Hahaha! Definitely, definitely!” Xia ruofei said,”we’ll be working together in many areas in the future!”

Xia ruofei had wanted to have Ma Zhiming stay for dinner, but it was obvious that he was in a hurry to return to Hong Kong to take his medicine. Hence, he took the energy gathering pill and left.

Ma Zhiming didn’t even go to the city to visit his old father – in – Law, professor Tian. Instead, he went directly to the airport from Taoyuan farm and then flew back to Hong Kong.

It could really be said that he came and left in a hurry.

He had used his private jet and applied for a flight route at the last minute just so he could come to San Shan in person and ask Xia ruofei to check for him. In less than half a day, he had flown between Hong Kong and San Shan. One could only say that rich people were capricious!

......

The next day, Xia ruofei drove to Egret Island with Hu Zi’s mother and Lin Qiao.

The high speed rail between Sanshan and Egret Island was very convenient. Initially, Hu Zi’s mother wanted to take the high speed rail there. However, Xia ruofei considered that it would be more convenient to have a car on Egret Island. Moreover, Lin Qiao had a lot of luggage. It would be troublesome to go in and out of the station by gaotte, so he decided to drive there.

Considering that Heron Island was a tourist city and that hotels were rather tight at the start of the school season, Xia ruofei had already booked a room at a hotel near Heron Island University a few days in advance.

After they arrived at Egret Island, Xia ruofei and the rest settled down in the hotel before he brought Lin Qiao to the school to register.

They took a taxi there, leaving the Knight XV in the hotel parking lot.

After all, it would be too ostentatious to drive this car on campus.

As soon as the young and beautiful Lin Qiao arrived at the registration point of the advertising college, she was immediately surrounded by enthusiastic senior brothers. Soon, the registration procedures were completed smoothly. Then, someone took her to her dormitory.

After settling down in the dormitory, Xia ruofei took Lin Qiao to the canteen to apply for a meal card and topped up a few thousand Yuan into it. He also told her not to be too frugal since she was going to school alone on Egret Island. She had to spend the money she needed and ask him for more if it was not enough.

Lin Qiao also enjoyed the feeling of being pampered by Xia ruofei, so she nodded obediently.

For the past two days, it was the new students who came to register. Lin Qiao had nothing else to do after finishing the procedures, so she followed Xia ruofei back to the hotel.

On the way, Lin Qiao’s counselor called to inform her that she would have a class meeting the day after tomorrow. After that, she would officially start her college career.

There was still more than a day left, and Lin Qiao didn’t want to go back to school. Hence, Xia ruofei decided to take Hu Zi’s mother and Lin Qiao on a tour of Egret Island.

The Fort at huli mountain, the beach of Heron Island University, Zeng Zhenzhen ... In the end, they even took a boat to Gulangyu and stayed on this beautiful island for half a day. Then, they took the last ferry back to Heron Island.

On the third day, Lin Qiao reluctantly said goodbye to her mother and Xia ruofei and returned to school.

Xia ruofei didn’t give her a Kasaya on purpose. After all, Lin Qiao would be living in this city for at least four years. It was time for her to cultivate her independence.

Xia ruofei and Hu Zi’s mother stood at the entrance of the hotel, watching Lin Qiao’s taxi gradually disappear into the distance. Hu Zi’s mother’s eyes were also a little red. This was the first time her daughter had left her side, and her heart was full of reluctance and worry.

Xia ruofei smiled.”Godmother, don’t worry. Qiao’ er has grown up. She will take care of herself!”

Hu ‘er’s mother nodded and said,”yes, this child has been sensible since young ...”

Godmother, do you want to stay on Egret Island for a few more days or go back to the three mountains directly?” Xia ruofei asked.

“Let’s go back!” Hu Zi’s mother said,”the forestry Bureau’s residence has not been occupied for a long time. We need to clean it up. In two days, the primary school will start again. I still have to help Yue ‘e pick up Nan Nan!”

Previously, Xia ruofei had looked for the municipal government’s Secretary, song Qiming, to help Lin Yue ‘E’s child, Nan Nan, get admitted to the school. In the end, he arranged for her to stay at the No. 2 primary school in the clock tower. Hu Zi’s mother had also taken the initiative to take care of the child.

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said,”then please rest in the lobby. I’ll go check out!” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Very quickly, Xia ruofei completed the procedures and drove away from Heron Island with Hu’s mother.

As the car crossed the sea bridge, Xia ruofei’s phone vibrated.

He took a look at the LCD screen in the car. It was already connected to the phone via Bluetooth, and the screen showed that the caller was the big boss of the Australian retail industry, Tang Yitian.

Xia ruofei gently pressed the green answer button on the LCD screen and said with a smile,””Hello, big brother Tang!”
