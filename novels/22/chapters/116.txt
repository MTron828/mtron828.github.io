The plane quickly left the runway and glided along the runway to Xia ruofei and the others. As soon as the plane stopped, a flight attendant immediately opened the cabin door and lowered the accommodation ladder. Then, he quickly walked down and stood respectfully beside the plane. As time was of the essence, the beautiful flight attendant immediately closed the cabin door after Xia ruofei and the rest boarded the plane. As soon as everyone sat down and fastened their seat belts, the captain’s voice came through the radio, telling everyone that the plane was about to slide to the runway again. From the moment they landed to the time they got on their computers and slid out again, not a single minute was wasted. The Gulfstream business jet waited at the runway for two to three minutes before it was granted permission to take off. The plane slowly turned and began to add take – off thrust after it was aligned with the runway. Xia ruofei suddenly felt a push on his back. The scenery outside the porthole was rapidly passing by, and the plane was rapidly increasing its speed. Soon, Xia ruofei felt the plane’s body shake slightly. The plane jumped up lightly and flew into the sky. When Xia ruofei was in the Army, he had taken military transport planes and attack helicopters. However, this was his first time taking such a high – end business plane. He could not help but look around curiously. This Gulfstream G660 was also a high – end product among the private planes. The cabin was decorated extremely luxuriously, with full – wrapped leather seats, spacious sitting space, and dazzling multimedia facilities ... Everything was beyond the reach of ordinary Civil Aviation first – Class cabins. This was the life of the rich! It was convenient, fast, and traveling was more of an enjoyment. Xia ruofei said in his heart,”One day, I will buy a plane like this! He had been in the Army for seven years and had risked his life for the country. It was time to enjoy life after he retired. Ma Zhiming and his wife were both worried. Only Huan Huan, who was still young, seemed very happy because Xia ruofei was also on the plane. The Gulfstream plane’s cruising altitude was 40000 feet, which was 30000 feet higher than the general civil aircraft. Cruising in the stable stratosphere, the plane naturally did not have any bumps. About an hour later, the plane began to descend slowly and soon landed at Hong Kong International Airport. The plane taxied to the parking lot, and a luxurious Toyota nanny car was already waiting there. The MA family even coordinated with the immigration officers to quickly handle the entry procedures for Xia ruofei on the tarmac. Then, the group got into the Toyota. Xia ruofei thought that the car was heading straight for the hospital. Unexpectedly, the car did not leave the airport. Instead, it was led by the guide car to the helipad on the other side of the airport. The private helicopter arranged by the MA family had already started its engine, and the group got on the helicopter again. The helicopter quickly took off and flew toward the southwest of Hong Kong. On the plane, Ma Zhiming explained a little. Xia ruofei then realized that they had arranged this to avoid the traffic during the peak hour and to reach the hospital faster. Looking out the window at Hong Kong’s bright lights and listening to the roaring helicopter engine, Xia ruofei could not help but sigh with emotion about the life of the rich. Soon, the plane landed on the tarmac on the roof of a hospital building. The hospital was owned by the MA family’s Hengfeng group and was one of the most high – end private hospitals in Hong Kong. It had the best medical conditions in Asia. Xia ruofei and the others got off the helicopter. The MA family members were already waiting on the tarmac. He led them directly to the elevator on the eighth floor, to the TICU. Hengfeng hospital’s director and other people were gathered outside the ICU. The big boss of Qin Zhuan group was on the verge of death. They were naturally very nervous. Other than a group of doctors in white coats, there was also a group of people who were dressed in a way that showed that they were either rich or powerful. They gathered outside the ICU and waited. These people had different expressions on their faces. Some were anxious, some were looking forward to it, and some were even gloating over his misfortune. As soon as Ma Zhiming’s group appeared, the people who were gathered at the entrance of the ICU all went up to them. Hengfeng hospital’s director was an old man with white hair. Before he could say anything, Ma Zhiming asked anxiously,””Dean Qin, how’s my dad doing?” Dean Qin frowned and said,”young master Ming, Mr. Ma’s condition doesn’t look good!” He’s in a deep coma now and has lost a lot of blood. He has symptoms of intracranial hypertension and his cornea reflex has almost disappeared ... You ... You have to be mentally prepared ...” The two of them conversed in Cantonese. As it involved the patient’s condition, Tian Huixin quietly translated it for Xia ruofei to speak Mandarin. Ma Zhiming’s eyes suddenly turned red. He asked,”Dean Qin, is there really no other way?” Dean Qin shook his head and said,””Mr. MA is already so old, and his cerebral herniation has been here for a long time, so he’s no longer in the condition for surgery. Conservative treatment is basically useless for such a serious condition ...” Ma Zhiming’s body swayed, and he almost fainted. He reached out to hold the wall and took a few deep breaths before he recovered. “Young Ming, you have to hang in there!” “Uncle is blessed by the heavens, he’ll definitely be fine.” “Second uncle is sick now. Hengfeng still needs you to support it!” …… The relatives next to him all tried to comfort Ma Zhiming. Although MA Xiong only had one son, Ma Zhiming, his family was still very big. MA Xiong had a total of six siblings, and most of the people present today were Ma Zhiming’s cousins. However, even though these people were saying words of comfort, they did not have too much sadness on their faces. This was how rich families were like. Hengfeng group was founded by MA Xiong, but most of his relatives held important positions in the group. Many of them even controlled some of the high – Quality assets of Hengfeng. Now that the Hengfeng group’s head, MA Xiong, was about to die, many people’s thoughts had already turned to how to split the family property. Ma Zhiming turned his head abruptly and looked at Xia ruofei with hope. He asked,”Xia Sheng, you must have a way to save my daddy, right?” “Mr. MA, I can give it a try, but I can’t guarantee the result ...” Xia ruofei said calmly. “Thank you! Thank you!” Ma Zhiming quickly said,”Mr. Xia, I’ll leave it to you! No matter what the result is, I will thank you properly!” Xia ruofei nodded and said,””There’s no time to lose, Mr. MA. I need to prepare some Chinese medicine immediately. Please send me to the nearest Chinese medicine shop!” “Our Hengfeng hospital has a Chinese medicine room!” Ma Zhiming quickly said. Dean Qin, take Xia Sheng to the Chinese medicine room immediately. No matter what herbs he needs, you must prepare them immediately!” At this moment, an elegant middle – aged lady looked at Xia ruofei suspiciously and asked with a frown,””Ming, who is he?”
