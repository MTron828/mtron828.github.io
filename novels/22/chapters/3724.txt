Chapter 3725: Another battle with the spirit body (1)

Translator: 549690339

The space and time formations had always been the most complicated formations.

This Space Array was the same. The seemingly simple array pattern actually contained countless changes.

The minute difference in each arc could lead to a completely different result.

The so – called “great Dao is simple” was roughly this principle.

Even with Xia ruofei’s array Dao level, it would still be very difficult for him to completely understand such an array technique.

Fortunately, Xia ruofei was not here to learn about arrays. He did not need to understand the most basic principles. It was enough for him to understand the different possibilities brought about by the changes in the array.

In this place, he only needed to “know how it is”, and not “know why it is.”

Formations served specific purposes, and the main function of this formation was transportation.

Xia ruofei started his analysis from the teleportation function.

He analyzed the different teleportation effects that different array patterns would bring.

This was especially so for the realm stone in the center of the formation. How would the formation be activated upon contact? this was the core of the formation’s function and was also the main point of Xia ruofei’s analysis.

Xia ruofei simulated in his mind again and again how the other array patterns would operate once he touched the realm stone. He also simulated how the teleportation destination would change under the effect of the entire array.

In fact, the amount of calculation required was not low. However, with Xia ruofei’s current array Dao level, he could still manage it.

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue stood beside Xia ruofei. Seeing that he was staring at the formation without moving, they did not dare to disturb him. They just stood there quietly.

As time passed, Xia ruofei did not seem to have any intention of taking any further action. Song Wei and Ling Qingxue were not impatient either. They knew that Xia ruofei must be analyzing the array, so they waited patiently at the side.

After a long time, Xia ruofei finally heaved a long sigh of relief and said,””This formation is really exquisite! From the scale of this underground Palace and the design of this formation, it can be seen that the senior who set up this underground Palace had a skill in the Dao of formations that people could only look up to.”

Xia ruofei’s array skills were already enough to make song Wei and Ling Qingxue look up to him. Even in the entire cultivation world today, his array skills could be said to be superior to everyone else.

Even Xia ruofei was full of praise for this formation. It was clear that this was indeed a very exquisite formation.

Song Wei turned to look at Xia ruofei and asked,””RUO Fei, does this mean that … You’ve already seen through the pattern of this formation?”

Xia ruofei smiled.”! have a certain judgment. However … Whether it’s correct or not, it needs to be tested.”

“You’re going to test the array?” Ling Qingxue could not help but ask.

“Of course, time is the only standard to test the truth!” Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”if you don’t try it yourself, it’ll always be empty talk.”

“That makes sense!” Ling Qingxue laughed and said,”true knowledge comes from practice!”

Song Wei was a little anxious. She quickly said,”Since we’re going to test the array, then the three of us will do it together!”

Last time, she had been separated from Xia ruofei here, so she had been traumatized.

Now that Xia ruofei wanted to test the array again, Song Wei was reminded of the situation back then. The helpless situation back then had left an indelible shadow in her heart.

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,””Wei Wei, there’s no need for that. Although I’m just testing out the function of the formation, I’m actually quite confident in it. There’s no need to be so nervous.”

“But…” Song Wei said anxiously.

“Let me finish.” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”even if my judgment is wrong, I’m confident that I can minimize the danger and return to this jade stone platform without any problems!”

Song Wei secretly sighed and said,””Alright! You’re an expert in formations, I trust your judgment!”

Xia ruofei gently pinched Song Wei’s soft hand and smiled.””Don’t be too nervous. I’m just doing a simple experiment to confirm my judgment. Remember, after I’m teleported away, don’t move and don’t touch the core of the formation. Do you understand?”

Xia ruofei was very serious. Song Wei and Ling Qingxue both nodded in agreement. This was not a joke. If they touched the core of the array, they might really die.

Xia ruofei and Song Wei were lucky that they were not teleported to a dangerous place. Otherwise, they would have died in the underground palace.

This could be considered as the ignorant being fearless! DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

After Xia ruofei had instructed Song Wei and Ling Qingxue, he slowly walked to the center of the Jade stone platform. At the core of the array, the realm stone was placed there quietly. It was exactly the same as when they had first entered.

However, in Xia ruofei’s eyes, this seemingly calm Jade stage was actually filled with all sorts of array patterns. Each array pattern contained several changes and when combined together, there were countless possibilities.

However, Xia ruofei had already done a thorough analysis of the teleportation array’s functions. Hence, the array patterns had evolved into various possibilities in Xia ruofei’s eyes.

He steadily walked to the world stone in the center of the Jade stone platform.

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue held their breaths and stared at Xia ruofei without moving..
