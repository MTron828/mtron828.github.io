Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei’s face turned cold. He glanced at Shen Hu who was beside him.

Shen Hu immediately felt a bone – chilling cold run through his body from head to toe. He hurriedly pushed open the door.

In the room, a female cultivator in a light yellow outfit stared at Lu You coldly. This female cultivator had delicate features, but she only had a good appearance. From what he had heard just now, he knew how mean she was.

“Who’s so unruly!”The female cultivator surnamed Lu shouted.

Then, she turned around and saw Shen Hu and Xia ruofei standing at the door. She frowned and said in a gentler tone,””So it’s sect Master Shen!”

“Junior – martial nephew Lu, how has my disciple offended you? why are you speaking so vulgarly?” Shen Hu could not help but ask coldly.

Just now, he had clearly felt Xia ruofei’s cold killing intent and could not help but shiver. He was very clear that he had to seek justice for Lu You immediately. Otherwise, he would have completely offended Xia ruofei.

At this moment, Shen Hu’s intestines were about to turn green with regret. If he had known that so many things would happen, he would not have brought Lu You to attend this ceremony even if he was beaten to death.

The female cultivator’s name was Lu Yuqing, and she was the most favored direct disciple of the luoshen sect’s sect master. Her cultivation level was only at refined Qi Level 5, but she was used to being arrogant and despotic.

Although the luoshen sect’s sect leader Chi Qingqing was also at the ninth Qi layer, she was very close to breaking through to the Golden core stage. If it wasn’t for the increasingly harsh cultivation environment on earth, she would have broken through long ago.

Even though the cultivation environment was getting worse by the day, Chi Qingqing was still the cultivator with the highest chance of breaking through to the 9th Qi layer. Moreover, everyone believed that it was only a matter of time before she broke through, so she could be considered a “quasi – Golden core cultivator”.

It was precisely because of this that although Chi Qingqing didn’t enjoy the treatment of having her own courtyard, her treatment was still a little better than Shen Hu of the water element sect and Ouyang Zhongsheng of the golden sword sect. The only suite in this courtyard had been assigned to her.

Logically speaking, as Chi Qingqing’s personal disciple, Lu Yuqing’s status should also rise with the tide. However, there were a total of five rooms in this courtyard. The three sect Masters each occupied one room, and the remaining three disciples were Lu You, Lu Yuqing, and elder Liu from the golden sword sect. There were differences between men and women. Lu You and elder Liu couldn’t share a room, so there were no other arrangements. Lu You and Lu Yuqing could only share a room.

Because of this arrangement, Lu Yuqing was also very unhappy and picked on Lu You. However, Lu You came from a small sect and her cultivation was low, so she could only swallow her anger.

Just now, she was in a hurry to get Xia ruofei the prosperous pill. She knocked on the door and pushed it open without waiting for Lu Yuqing’s reply. As a result, she was scolded by Lu Yuqing.

When she saw Xia ruofei and Shen Hu walk in, especially when Shen Hu directly reprimanded Lu Yuqing, Lu You felt a lump in her throat, and her tears of grievance flowed out uncontrollably.

Lu Yuqing raised her eyebrows and said sarcastically,””Sect Master Shen, what do you mean by this? It’s clearly your disciple who didn’t know the rules and barged into my room when I was cultivating, how did it become my fault?” “This room is for the two of you. Does she need your permission to enter the room? What kind of logic is that?” Xia ruofei asked, frowning.

“Who are you?” Lu Yuqing looked at Xia ruofei with disdain and said,”you’re just an ordinary person from the secular world. How dare you interfere with the affairs of cultivators? I think you’re tired of living!” You don’t know the immensity of heaven and earth! Get out! You have no right to speak here!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be stunned. This was the first time he had been reprimanded by a Qi Level 5 cultivator!

Shen Hu was so scared that he almost died on the spot. He trembled as he stepped forward and pointed at Lu Yuqing,””How audacious! How dare you be so rude to Mr. Xia! Is this how the Luo God sect is taught?”

“What’s wrong with the upbringing of our luoshen sect?” A cold voice came from outside the door.

Everyone looked up and saw a female cultivator in her forties walk in with a frosty expression. She was staring coldly at Shen Hu.

Xia ruofei used his spiritual power to scan the area and couldn’t help but pout. He was just a level 9 cultivator, yet he made such a big scene. Those who didn’t know would think that he was a nascent Soul Master!

Shen Hu’s expression changed slightly. He said,”So it’s sect leader Chi.” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Hmph! If I didn’t come, my good – for – nothing disciple would have been scolded to tears by you!” Chi Qingqing said coldly,”sect Master Shen is so fierce to a junior. Is this the upbringing of your water element sect?”

“Sect leader Chi, the ins and outs of this matter are very clear.” Shen Hu bit the bullet and said,”my disciple was just returning to his room, but he was scolded by your disciple. We’re all under the same roof, isn’t this a bit too much?”

“I don’t know if it’s too much or not, nor do I know what happened just now. I only know that…” Chi Qingqing stared into Shen Hu’s eyes and said,”I haven’t even reached the door when I heard sect Master Shen questioning the upbringing of our luoshen sect. Sect Master Shen, what right do you have to criticize our luoshen sect?” What gave you such courage? Could it be that you’ve already broken through to the Golden core stage after not seeing you for a day?”

Shen Hu’s face turned green with anger. Everyone lived in the same courtyard, and Chi Qingqing was a ninth – tier aura refining cultivator. She should have heard Lu Yuqing’s scolding clearly even from her room.. How could she not have heard anything that happened earlier?
