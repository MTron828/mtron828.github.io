In the courtyard where Lu You lived, Chi Qingqing brought Lu Yuqing back to the only suite.

Shen Hu was also worried about leaving Lu You alone in the room, so he brought her back to the room he was staying in.

“Teacher, I’m sorry…” Lu You said with a worried expression.

Shen Hu sighed and said,”it’s not your fault. Lu Yuqing was too domineering!” Lu You! You don’t have to worry too much. Chi Qingqing and her disciple won’t be able to cause any big waves!”

“Master, you told me yesterday that Lu Yuqing might become the daughter – in

– Law of elder Zhou of the first heaven society, and you asked me to be more tolerant of her!” Lu You asked in puzzlement,”we’ve offended her to the core today. They will definitely complain to elder Zhou!”

There were some other things that Lu You didn’t continue to say. Otherwise, it would hurt her self – esteem.

However, her meaning was already very clear. Let alone elder Zhou, even a Qi condensation disciple with a slightly higher status in the first heaven society would be able to make the water Yuan sect suffer.

“Elder Zhou is naturally someone we need to look up to, but we don’t need to undervalue ourselves.” Shen Hu smiled. Actually… There’s something I’ve been wanting to tell you for a long time, but I didn’t find a good opportunity…” “Teacher, what’s the matter?” Lu You asked curiously.

She thought to herself,”don’t tell me that teacher also has a powerful background that no one else knows about?” But why was he so patient usually?

“Your friend, Mr. Xia, is also a cultivator. That’s why he’s in the first heaven society,” Shen Hu said.

Lu You’s eyes widened when she heard that. Her face was filled with disbelief. After a long while, she said,””You said that RUG Fei is a cultivator? How was that possible? I… I’ve never heard of it!”

“Your cultivation level is still relatively low. Even if a cultivator were to stand in front of you, you wouldn’t be able to tell!” Shen Hu said with a smile.

“So, RUG Fei’s cultivation is very high?” Lu You was still in a daze.

“At least higher than you!” Shen Hu smiled.

“Then how does it compare to you, teacher?” Lu You continued to ask.

Shen Hu was stunned for a moment. He quickly thought of something. Xia ruofei didn’t want Lu You to know that he was an Aurous core stage cultivator. He didn’t want Lu You to know that he was the one who gave him the technique and the spirit crystal. Hence, he could only say that he was a Qi refinement stage cultivator.

Shen Hu himself was at lianqi level 9, and there weren’t many cultivators with a higher cultivation than him.

Thus, Shen Hu only hesitated for a moment before saying, “He’s still not as good as me. He’s still so young, after all!”

Lu You nodded and said,”this is unbelievable!” I couldn’t tell at all that he was a cultivator … Teacher, you’re not lying to me, are you?”

These words to a sect leader were somewhat offensive.

However, female disciples had an innate advantage. Moreover, Lu You’s status was special and she was Xia ruofei’s friend. Hence, Shen Hu would not be angry. He only smiled bitterly and said,”Why Would 1 Lie to You about this? Don’t tell me it’s going to benefit me in any way?”

“I’m sorry, teacher, 1 didn’t mean it that way!” Lu You quickly realized that her words were inappropriate and quickly apologized.

Shen Hu waved his hand and said with a smile,”no problem!” No harm! Lu You! Although your friend, Mr. Xia, doesn’t have a high cultivation, his status is not ordinary! Otherwise, why would a Qi condensation cultivator like him be invited by the first heaven sect to attend the ceremony?”

“What’s his identity?” Lu You couldn’t help but ask,”could it be … That he’s also a sect leader?” This … This is even more impossible!”

Shen Hu shook his head with a smile and said,”Daoist Xia should be a loose cultivator. Even if he has his own sect, it’s only in name.” When I said “special,” I meant that his friends were very amazing! Mr. Xia and the young sect leader of the first heaven sect, elder Chen Xuan, are very close friends. It’s also because of this that the young sect leader personally invited him to attend the ceremony.”

“Ruofei actually knows sect leader Chen?” Lu You felt even more incredulous.

In the courtyard where Lu You lived, Chi Qingqing brought Lu Yuqing back to the only suite.

Shen Hu was also worried about leaving Lu You alone in the room, so he brought her back to the room he was staying in.
