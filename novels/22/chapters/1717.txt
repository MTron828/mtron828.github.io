Chapter 1718: Qiuhang’s reward (2)

Tony quickly said,”Mr. Xia, you’re being too serious. Your heroic act not only saved our company from huge financial losses, but more importantly, you protected our company’s reputation. No reward is too much!”

Just then, Tony’s Secretary, Ivy, knocked on the door gently and walked in with a document.

Since he knocked on the door when his boss was meeting with an important guest, the document must be very important, so Tony immediately excused himself and got up to walk to his desk.

While Tony was dealing with the documents, Tang Yitian said in Chinese,””Ruofei, A.I. Is too stingy! Two million Australian dollars and you’re dismissed?”

Li Yifu felt like he had been humiliated and his subjects had died. He also said indignantly,””Martial granduncle! A.k.a. Is not putting you in their eyes! Do you want me to teach them a lesson?”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”you two, stop causing trouble!” How much is more? Do I lack this money? Besides, I was trying to save myself and the passengers on the plane. I wasn’t there for the reward!”

“But ...” Li Yifu said.

“Alright! I think he’s quite sincere. ” Xia ruofei interrupted Li Yifu’s words and said with a smile,”you’ll know if you check the rewards for similar incidents in the world. They really didn’t deduct it! That’s quite generous! Besides, didn’t Tony say there was a surprise?”

Xia ruofei finally managed to appease the two’ angry youths ‘. However, when Tony came back after he finished handling the documents, the two of them did not look happy at all. This made Tony feel a little uneasy. He did not know what he had done wrong to offend these two.

After he sat down again, Tony calmed himself down and said to Xia ruofei,””Mr. Xia, there’s one more thing. It’s about the press conference that’s about to be held. The news industry is very interested in your Affairs, and there may be a lot of questions thrown at you. You can choose to answer them, but you can completely refuse to answer those questions that make you feel uncomfortable. ”

Xia ruofei knew what Tony meant. He smiled and nodded.”I understand. The details of this incident will still be based on what you’ve announced.”

In fact, Xia ruofei did not like to show his face in public. However, considering that this matter had been exposed in the country, there was no point in hiding it.

Besides, this was Australia. As a Chinese, Xia ruofei had become a hero pursued by the media and raised the country’s prestige. That was why Xia ruofei agreed to attend the press conference.

Tony was overjoyed to hear this. It was so easy to talk to smart people!

After the two matters were discussed, the next thing to do was to wait for the press conference. Tony also began to find topics to chat with Tang Yitian and Li Yifu.

It was just that the two of them were a little indifferent to Tony, and the atmosphere was a little awkward.

Fortunately, it didn’t take long. Soon, Ivy knocked on the door and came in, saying,”Mr. Tony, it’s almost time. Everything is ready at the scene and the reporters have already entered.”

Tony stood up and said,””Mr. Xia, Mr. Tang, Mr. Li, let’s go!”

Tony personally led the way and led the three of them to the elevator. They arrived at the floor where the press conference hall was located.

The group of people entered the press conference hall from the side door. It was a waiting room that was similar to the backstage. From here, they could see part of the situation in the press conference hall from the side of the stage. Li Yifu and Tang Yitian stayed there.

Tang Yitian was a famous person in Australia. If he went out, he would definitely be recognized by the reporters. It was impossible for him to blend in with the reporters.

To Xia ruofei’s surprise, the chief flight attendant and air traffic police from the previous flight would be attending the press conference as well. Both of them were already waiting here.

Everyone had gone through thick and thin together, so they felt very close to each other when they met. They couldn’t help but chat until the clock struck 9:30, and everyone walked out together.

After Xia ruofei and the rest came out, the noisy press conference hall suddenly became quiet.

Then, the camera flashes continued to light up. Xia ruofei felt that he could barely open his eyes. Most of the cameras were aimed at him.

A lone hero from the mysterious East. There were too many breaking news about this. Xia ruofei was definitely the media’s favorite now.

Everyone found their name tags and took their seats. Xia ruofei’s seat was in the middle, right next to Tony. Beside them were the chief flight attendant, the air traffic police, and the host of the press conference, who sat at the side.

“Everyone, please be quiet!” The host turned on the microphone in front of him and said,”thank you, media friends, for being here. Today, we are very honored to have invited Mr. Tony, the Senior Vice President of Air Australia, Mr. Xia ruofei, who helped Air Australia’s QF108 flight to land, and ...”

The host first introduced the few people who attended the press conference today, then said,””Next, Mr. Tony, please make an announcement. There will be a Q & A session later!”

After saying that, the host gestured to Tony and closed the microphone in front of him.

A smile appeared on Tony’s face. He tested the microphone and said,””Welcome, media friends. First of all, I would like to announce the preliminary investigation results of this incident! A few days ago, there was an emergency on flight QF108 from the capital of China to sithiny, Australia. The plane finally landed successfully in Saipan without any casualties. The incident caused two crew members to die and one crew member to be injured. Our preliminary investigation included questioning the parties involved, retrieving the cabin Sound Records and flight data, and a comprehensive inspection of the plane ...”

The Australian Airlines side had already prepared a draft, and Tony was also very cautious. He directly read the draft word by word.

Finally, he said,”after the preliminary investigation, we have come to the basic conclusion: This is a long – planned hijacking, and the co – Pilot on duty, Wilkinson, is a major suspect. The police have applied for a search order to search Wilkinson’s residence, and sealed his computer, tablet, and other physical evidence. We will inform the media as soon as we have any further information!”

Tony paused and looked at Xia ruofei.””Here, I would like to express my sincerest thanks to Mr. Xia ruofei from China on behalf of qiuhang. If it weren’t for Mr. Xia’s decisive action at the critical moment and the courage to fly the plane to force the surrender of Saipan when all the pilots were disabled, this incident would have led to extremely painful consequences! Mr. Xia, thank you!”

Tony stood up and bowed deeply to Xia ruofei. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

The reporters in the audience were also in an uproar. Although everyone had inquired about the incident through various channels, and the details of the incident were clearly stated in the online media and some tabloids, this was the first time the Australian Airlines officials had personally admitted that this was a hijacking planned by the co – Pilot for a long time. This had an extraordinary significance.

Many reporters couldn’t wait to raise their hands and ask questions.

Tony smiled.”Everyone, please be patient. I still have some information to release. There will be a Q & A session later. We have left enough time for everyone to ask questions!”

The reporters only sat back in their seats after hearing this.

“The second piece of news I’m going to announce is that qplease airlines will reward those who have successfully handled this special case ...” Tony continued.

Following that, Tony announced the reward plan according to the script.

This included Captain Brook, Purser, flight attendants, air traffic police, and others. They all received cash rewards as well as an internal honor of quodan.

Of course, Xia ruofei’s two million Australian dollars was the highest cash reward. Other than that, there was Captain Brook’s 1.5 million Australian dollars, the chief stewardess and the air traffic police’s 500000 Australian dollars, and the rest of the crew shared the one million Australian dollars.

Xia ruofei was not an internal staff of qiuhang, so he did not receive any additional honor. However, he received the title of ‘honored passenger’, which was more practical.

Tony also emphasized that Captain Johannson, who died in the line of duty, would be compensated according to the standard of death in the line of duty. At the same time, the Australian Trade union would also provide an additional bonus. All passengers would receive a certain amount of compensation. These were not included in the reward plan and would be announced in the near future.

Finally, Tony smiled and looked at Xia ruofei.””In recognition of Mr. Xia ruofei’s heroic act, we’ve decided to name the Airbus A350 that day ‘ruofei’, and ...”

At this point, Tony deliberately paused for a few seconds to keep them in suspense and successfully piqued the interest of the reporters.
