Chapter 777: Heading straight for the target (3)

In addition, there were so many abandoned brick kilns, and the brick factories were usually deserted. Even if there were ten times more people hiding inside, they would not be discovered.

Hence, this brick factory was listed as one of the most suspicious areas. Xia ruofei’s first investigation Target today was this abandoned brick factory.

He strolled forward with Blackie, and a few minutes later, he saw the road of farming in the distance.

It hadn’t rained for the past two days, so there were no traces of car tracks.

Xia ruofei was getting closer and closer to the road that led to the Brickyard. Just then, a person appeared at the corner of the road and was walking towards the intersection.

Xia ruofei jumped in shock and subconsciously glanced at the man. The person did not seem to expect to see someone on the road as soon as he turned the corner. He was very surprised and wanted to hide. However, Xia ruofei had already looked over and he changed his mind at the last minute. He glanced at Xia ruofei coldly and continued to walk.

Xia ruofei’s expression was still calm. He even looked at the man curiously a few times before crossing the intersection of the road and continuing to walk into the village.

In fact, Xia ruofei was extremely excited because he recognized the person at a glance. It was kappei Yamai, who was sitting in the front passenger seat and was captured by the surveillance camera yesterday! Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

It was almost certain that the Japanese were hiding in the abandoned brick factory!

Xia ruofei didn’t expect to find the right place on the first try. He felt that he was quite lucky.

He was dressed in casual clothes, with a Black Dog following him. He was no different from the other young people in the village, and he walked slowly into the village.

However, Xia ruofei had only taken three or four steps when he suddenly felt an extreme sense of danger. It was an instinct formed by years of living in the Special Forces.

He did not hesitate to make a dodging action, and with a little force under his feet, his whole body moved half a meter away.

......

Xia ruofei felt a cold glint pass by his ribs and realized that it was a dart.

He didn’t have time to think much. He turned around and saw that kappei Shani was still holding a dart in his hand. The blue on it was obviously poisoned.

Seeing that Xia ruofei had actually dodged the sneak attack without warning, kappei Shani’s face showed a trace of surprise. At the same time, his expression immediately became ferocious and the DART in his hand quickly shot out.

Xia ruofei was already on guard, so how could he let Shani kappei succeed?

Kappei Shani only felt a blur in front of his eyes. Xia ruofei, who was originally five or six meters away from him, suddenly appeared in front of him. Then, he received a heavy punch in the abdomen. His stomach was in turmoil, and he vomited on the spot.

An elite agent who had received strict training was actually so easily defeated by the other side in a sneak attack. If his instructor in the Wei nation knew about this, his jaw would definitely drop.

Even if Guo Zhan were to see this scene, he would definitely be dumbfounded. Xia ruofei’s strength and speed had already exceeded the limits of the human body.

Xia ruofei looked coldly at kappei Shani, who had completely lost his fighting power and was now curled up on the ground like a shrimp.

There was no emotion in Xia ruofei’s eyes, only cold killing intent.

With a thought, the military dagger that had been with him for many years appeared in his hand out of thin air.

Xia ruofei brandished his knife and muttered to himself,””Old friend, you can finally do what you should do. Let’s go to the battlefield and kill the enemy!”
