Just as Xia ruofei was about to hang up, Liang Qichao suddenly asked,””Oh right! Ruofei, where are you going to get a visa?”

There were three places in China where one could apply for an Australian visa. One was the Embassy in Beijing, and the other was the consulate – General in Shen Cheng and Yang Cheng. That was why Liang Qichao asked.

Xia ruofei said,”I haven’t decided yet. I guess it’ll be either shencheng or Guangzhou!” The capital was too far away! Qiao’ er didn’t even have a passport now! I have to get my passport first ...” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Liang Qichao said,”then I suggest you go to Shen Cheng city!” The old man’s shengbang group has an office in Shen Cheng, so it’s more efficient to let them handle these things, and it’s less likely for accidents like refusing to sign. ”

The old man Liang Qichao was talking about was none other than the head of shengbang group, the world – Class rich man, Tang He.

Shengbang group was a world – famous big consortium with branches or offices in various large cities around the world. The office in Shen Cheng city was mainly responsible for coordinating various relationships. It had a wide network and was backed by a big tree like shengbang group. Even the Shen Cheng consulate – General in Australia had to give them some face.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”okay!” Then he would go to Shen Cheng city to handle it! But wouldn’t it be too troublesome for the office of shengbang to handle this?”

“Hey! This little thing is nothing!” Liang Qichao said,”our old master appreciates you so much. Isn’t this a simple matter? I don’t even need to look for my cousin – grandfather, I can just tell his Office Director! You don’t have to worry about this, leave it to me!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”sure!” Then I won’t bother you two for the same matter! You’ve worked hard, brother Liang!”

“Are you treating me as an outsider again?” Liang Qichao said,”alright, I’ll stop talking to you. I have things to do here. Don’t worry about the visa!”

After hanging up the phone, Xia ruofei sent his and Lin Qiao’s identity information to Liang Qichao through WeChat and walked to the general office building.

He lit a cigarette and walked leisurely while smoking. When he reached his office in the office building, he saw a piece of paper being spat out from the fax machine. It seemed that the fax machine in his office received the message automatically.

Xia ruofei picked it up and saw that it was the invitation letter that Liang Qichao had faxed over.

With this invitation, he could apply for a visa under the name of a business inspection.

In the past, many companies used to treat overseas research as a benefit, and many travel companies could easily get their hands on such invitations. In fact, when they went abroad, they would arrange trips to famous tourist attractions.

Of course, now that all aspects of management were much more formal, the entire atmosphere of the officialdom from top to bottom had taken a new look, and this strange situation was much less.

At noon, Lei Hu drove Lin Qiao back to the farm.

After lunch, Xia ruofei told Lin Qiao,””Qiao’ er, find your identity card and household register. I’ll take you to apply for a passport. ”

Lin Qiao smiled and said,”brother ruofei, I haven’t received the letter of admission yet!” You’re ready to fulfill your promise in advance?”

Xia ruofei gently rubbed Lin Qiao’s hair and said,””It’ll take 14 working days to get a passport! After that, you still have to apply for a visa. Do you think it’s so easy to go abroad? do you think you can leave with your bag? If you don’t settle these procedures first, you might not even be able to make it when school starts!”

Then, Xia ruofei looked at Lin Qiao and said,”Besides, with your grades, isn’t it almost certain that you’ll be able to get into Heron Island University?”

Lin Qiao smiled proudly and said,”that makes sense!” Brother ruofei, give me a moment, I’ll go get my identity card and household register!”

The passport could be handled at the exit – Entry Administration Department of the municipal Public Security Bureau where the residence was located. If Xia ruofei had asked Wu Liqian, it would have been settled on a special occasion. It would not have taken as long as 14 working days.

However, Xia ruofei felt that there was no rush to leave the country. After all, if they followed the normal procedures, they would be able to get their passports in less than 20 days.

At that time, Lin Qiao probably hadn’t received the admission Notice yet!

As for applying for a visa, the time required was even shorter. It could basically be done within three working days. Moreover, it only cost 50 yuan, and the consulate would provide mail service. So, after going through the procedures, one could go home directly. It was very convenient.

Lin Qiao’s household register was in Changping County. Xia ruofei drove her to the Public Security Bureau in Changping County. She filled in the application form according to the normal procedure and provided all kinds of materials. The rest was to wait at home.

In the next few days, Xia ruofei’s life returned to normal.

Other than dealing with the daily affairs of the company, he would go on dates with Ling Qingxue every other day. Ling Qingxue had already met Hu Zi’s mother the last time, so she would come to the farm occasionally. However, she would not spend the night there. After all, girls were thin – skinned. It would be fine if there was no one at Xia ruofei’s house, but it would be embarrassing if she stayed.

Lin Yue ‘e had also gotten used to the work on the farm.

The harvest of the orchard this year had been completed, and the main task was to maintain it. She and a few workers had taken care of it well.

However, as time passed, Xia ruofei had to seriously consider the matter of Nan Nan’s admission.

It was not difficult to register Nan Nan. What troubled Xia ruofei was the problem of transportation.
