“We have our own car. You don’t need to worry about it!” Tang Yitian said with a smile.

“Yongjun, my car’s here too, why don’t you drive it away?” Wu shuheng smiled. This will definitely be enough for the car!”

Song Rui said happily,”then it’s decided!” Yiyi, let’s go first!”

Then, he took the car keys from Zhao Yongjun’s hand.

After song Rui took the car keys, he brought Zhuo Yiyi to the car Zhao Yongjun had parked in the courtyard.

Zhuo Yiyi’s reaction was indeed a little slow. She did not notice the subtle relationship between these people, nor did she feel that song Rui’s concern for her had long gone beyond the scope of friends. 1

She bade Xia ruofei and the others goodbye, then got into the car and left.

After song Rui’s car drove out of the courtyard, Zhao Yongjun thought about it and smiled.””Ruofei, I’ll stay at Hilton tonight too. I still have to do the handover and transfer with you tomorrow!”

He paused for a moment and continued,””Why don’t you ... Send Lu You off? I’ll go back to the hotel with CEO Feng’s car. How about this arrangement?”

Xia ruofei’s expression froze. Zhao Yongjun’s arrangement was more reasonable. After all, Xia ruofei and Lu You were the most familiar with each other.

However, Zhao Yongjun had also attended elder song’s birthday banquet. He was naturally aware of the ambiguous relationship between Xia ruofei and Lu You. Hence, his arrangements were more or less with the intention of stirring up trouble.

Of course, if it was before tonight, it was fine to send Lu You off. However, Lu You had just confessed to Xia ruofei very formally. Xia ruofei felt rather conflicted to let him spend time with her alone.

This was because Xia ruofei had not been able to face his heart and could not make a choice.

Lu You seemed to have noticed Xia ruofei’s dilemma and glanced at him with a half – Smile.

Xia ruofei gave her a pleading look.

Lu You sighed in her heart. She knew that she could not rush things like this. However, when she saw Xia ruofei’s unwilling look, she felt a little embarrassed and angry. She simply smiled at Xia ruofei and did not say anything to help him out.

Xia ruofei closed his eyes and made up his mind. ‘I’ll give it to her, but she won’t eat me up,’ he thought.

Just as Xia ruofei was about to agree, Lu You said unhurriedly,””Big brother Zhao, my home is on the same way as your hotel. I’ll take Sister Feng’s car. Let Xia ruofei be in the same car as you! He drank quite a bit, it’s not safe to drive. ”

Xia ruofei instantly heaved a long sigh of relief and couldn’t help but look at Lu You with gratitude.

Lu You glanced at Xia ruofei resentfully before following Feng Jing, da Fu, and the rest out of the courtyard house. Tang Yitian and Feng Jing’s cars were parked at the entrance of the alley.

Zhao Yongjun and Xia ruofei also said goodbye to Wu shuheng, then drove Wu shuheng’s Mercedes – Benz away from the siheyuan.

On the way, Zhao Yongjun said with a smile,””Ruofei, you’re too pretentious. I’ve created such a good opportunity for you, but you didn’t seize it!”

Xia ruofei cursed in his heart,’chance your head! I was almost toyed to death ...

However, he definitely couldn’t say that Lu You had confessed to him. How much courage did she need to take the initiative to confess? If he were to casually say such things, would he still be human?

Hence, Xia ruofei could only pretend to be tired and said,””Brother Zhao, I drank too much tonight. I’m really too tired ...”

Zhao Yongjun didn’t doubt him and shook his head.””You! Let’s rest for a while! We’ll be at the hotel soon ...” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Okay, drive slowly ...” Xia ruofei lowered the seat and leaned back. He closed his eyes to rest.

The thought of having to take a plane back to the three mountains with Lu You made Xia ruofei’s head hurt. He didn’t hate Lu You. In fact, he didn’t have no feelings for her at all. However, under the current circumstances, he was really a little afraid to be alone with Lu You.

No one had done anything wrong in this matter. Perhaps the only thing wrong was the timing ... Xia ruofei sighed in his heart.

......

After they returned to the hotel, Xia ruofei and Zhao Yongjun went back to their rooms to rest.

The next morning, Xia ruofei woke up on time. After a simple wash, he sat cross – legged on the bed and prepared to cultivate.

Just then, his phone vibrated, and the screen lit up.

Xia ruofei waved his hand and the phone on the bedside table flew into his hand.

He opened it and saw that it was a new WeChat message from Lu You.

“Xia ruofei, I know you’re a little afraid of seeing me now, so I’ve decided to go back to the three mountains alone. I’m already at the airport now! But I won’t give up! We’ll meet at the three mountains!”

At the end of the message, Lu You even added a mischievous smile.

Xia ruofei held the phone in a daze. He felt a little relieved, but he was more conflicted. No matter how capable he was, he had no idea how to deal with this kind of situation.

Xia ruofei was absent – minded for the rest of the day. He decided not to cultivate and leaned against the headboard, staring blankly at the ceiling.

After a long time, Xia ruofei got off the bed and mumbled to himself,””I can’t care that much! It’s better to take one step at a time and do as you please!”

He let out a heavy breath, as if he wanted to spit out all the frustration in his heart.
