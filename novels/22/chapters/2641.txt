2642 Fulfilling the promise (2)

There was no doubt that the medicinal ingredients that Xia ruofei had provided were all genuine.

In other words, the Liu family could not even find one of the ingredients. It was not because Xia ruofei had made it up but because it was too precious and rare.

Xia ruofei smiled and explained,””These spirit herbs need fresh leaves or branches. Once they wither, they will lose their medicinal value, so I thought of many ways to transport them to the capital and keep them in this state. However, spirit herbs have to be planted in the medicine garden, and now is also a temporary measure. Over time, the medicinal properties will still be lost, so ... I plan to immediately make pills!”

Liu Qunfeng quickly took two steps back and said,””Mr. Xia, that’s better as soon as possible! Thank you for your trouble, you can start refining now! Please don’t waste the precious spirit herbs!”

Xia ruofei nodded, then smiled at Liu Qunfeng and Liu Chongli.

Liu Qunfeng was stunned for a moment, but he quickly reacted and said,”Then we won’t disturb you any longer! Mr. Xia, you can go back to your work!”

Then, he and Liu Chongli bowed slightly to Xia ruofei and said,””Please!”

Then, the two of them quickly left the room, afraid that if they were a little slower, the medicinal properties of the spirit herbs would be lost by quite a bit.

After he left, Liu Qunfeng immediately ordered twenty Men in Black to guard both ends of the corridor. No one was allowed to approach Xia ruofei’s room, including these men. They were stationed far away from Xia ruofei’s room.

Liu Qunfeng was trying to avoid suspicion.

He had even taken out a part of the prescription. If he still wanted to spy on him while he was refining the pill, it really didn’t make sense.

After arranging the guards, Liu Qunfeng immediately went to elder Liu’s room.

Soon, Liu Kuan walked out of the room and led Liu Qunfeng in.

Old man Liu had already heard the news from Liu Kuan, and he was in high spirits.

He looked at Liu Qunfeng with a smile and asked,””QUN FENG, did you see those herbs?”

Liu Qunfeng was also very happy. He nodded and said,””Yes! Mr. Xia was open and honest, showing us all the herbs! Among them is the purple crystal blood radish. There are more than a dozen precious spiritual herbs, and they are exactly the same as the ones in the illustrations he provided. Furthermore, one look and you can tell that they are not ordinary medicinal herbs. Just observing them up close is enough to make one feel refreshed!” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Little Xia probably won’t lie about the medicinal herbs.” Old man Liu said,”but ... We’ve just reached a verbal agreement on the medical fees, and the medicinal herbs will be collected soon. This is indeed a bit too coincidental.”

“I think he’s already collected them and planted them in a secret place!” Liu Qunfeng nodded.

Old man Liu waved his hand and said with a smile,””Let’s not delve into these questions. Besides ... There’s no need to doubt the preciousness of these medicinal herbs. If it were us, we probably wouldn’t be able to take out so many priceless medicinal herbs without even negotiating the treatment fee!”

“Yes, no matter what, I’m still very grateful to Mr. Xia!” “As long as he can cure you, he’ll be my Savior,” Liu Qunfeng said.

Liu Qunfeng said “I” instead of “our family” to show his attitude. Perhaps the Liu family would only treat this treatment as an equal deal. After all, they were on different sides. But as a son, Liu Qunfeng was grateful to Xia ruofei, who had cured his father.

Hearing this, elder Liu’s heart warmed. He looked at Liu Qunfeng with a gentler gaze. He smiled and said,””Qunfeng, even if you’re lucky enough to be cured this time, you can’t go against the laws of nature. In the end, you’ll have to face all the pressure alone and bear the burden on the shoulders of the Liu family.”

Liu Qunfeng’s face revealed a trace of fear as he said,””Dad! As the saying goes, there’s always good fortune after surviving a great disaster. If you can recover successfully this time, you’ll definitely be healthy in the future, so please don’t say anything unlucky!”

Old man Liu laughed and did not continue the topic. Instead, he instructed,””Qunfeng, little Xia’s prescription must be priceless. You can’t reveal the complete list! In addition ... The pills he made must also be closely watched, and he must not try to restore them. Since they treat us with sincerity, we must have the most basic bottom line. ”

“Don’t worry!” “I definitely wouldn’t do that,” Liu Qunfeng said.

……

While the father and son of the Liu family were chatting in a good mood, Xia ruofei had already started to get busy in the room next door.

After Liu Qunfeng and Liu Chongli left, the first thing Xia ruofei did was to lock all the doors and windows. Then, he released his mental power to check every inch of the room.

In fact, Xia ruofei had checked the room carefully when he moved in. He would check it again every day when he returned to the room, but this time, he was more detailed and thorough. His mental power was like mercury flowing on the floor, leaving no blind spots in the room.

Of course, he also checked the situation outside the house.

Xia ruofei could sense that Liu Qunfeng had arranged for a large number of guards to guard his room. At the same time, he had restricted the range of their security and did not allow the Men in Black to approach his room. He could not help but nod.

Xia ruofei was satisfied with the results of his spiritual power. The Liu family did not do anything to the room. They did not arrange for people to eavesdrop or install special tools to eavesdrop on the conversation through the wall.

The reason why Xia ruofei was so cautious was that he was going to take out the spirit map scroll here and enter the space to do so in someone else’s territory. This was the first time Xia ruofei had done this.

After the inspection, Xia ruofei set up several layers of alarm and defense arrays in the room. He was much more cautious than when he was in his courtyard house.

In addition to the alert array, there were also two shielding arrays, which could effectively prevent eavesdropping from the outside. At the same time, even if there were hidden cameras that he had overlooked, after the shielding array took effect, the images within the range of the array would appear to be partly hidden and partly visible, as if they were shrouded in fog.

After checking the formation, Xia ruofei summoned the spirit map scroll from his palm.

He disguised the blanket on the bed as if someone was sleeping with their head covered, and then stuffed the spirit map scroll under the blanket.

Then, he put the huge plastic box into his Origin space.

Xia ruofei then entered the spirit map space.

The first thing Xia ruofei did after entering the space was to replant those spiritual herbs in the herb garden on the realm Heart Island.

In order to make it look real, he had entered the medium yesterday and dug up the dozen or so spiritual herbs along with their roots, temporarily cultivating them in flower pots.

The soil used for the flower pot was the same soil used in the realm Heart island’s medicine garden. At the same time, it was also watered with the water from the spirit pond.

Xia ruofei did not immediately bring these spiritual herbs to the outside world yesterday. Instead, he placed them in the medicinal garden on the realm Heart Island, trying his best to maintain the same living environment for them.

In fact, Xia ruofei had only taken out the spiritual herbs from the medium and placed them in a large plastic box when he was about to reach the Liu family’s residence.

Now that these spirit herbs had completed their mission, they naturally needed to be planted as soon as possible. These were precious spirit herbs that could only be encountered but not sought in the current cultivation world on earth.

Xia ruofei personally planted all the spiritual herbs, but he left the flower pots and the soil inside.

When he returned to the outside world, he took these flower pots and soil out and piled them in a corner of the room.

Then, Xia ruofei skillfully picked out a few useful Chinese herbs from the other half of the plastic box and poured them into the clay pot. He was ready to make the life – saving pill for elder Liu.
