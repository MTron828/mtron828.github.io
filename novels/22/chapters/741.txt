Chapter 742: Chapter 502 – escort_1

Although he had warned Xue Fei last time and the college entrance examination was over, everyone would be going their separate ways soon. It was normal to organize a class gathering at this time, but Xia ruofei was still worried.

He could not place Lin Hu’s last words on probability. Even if there was a slight risk, Xia ruofei had to nip it in the bud.

However, Xia ruofei did not show this worry on his face. He only smiled and asked,””What time do you need to arrive tomorrow?”

“Sixo’ clock!” Lin Qiao looked at her phone and said,”I’m at the pavilion on yingfei road.”

“Alright! We’ll set off at 5: 20. ” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”remember to remind me!”

“Alright!” Lin Qiao smiled and said,”thank you, brother ruofei!”

Xia ruofei smiled at Lin Qiao. At this time, someone came over to propose a toast, so Xia ruofei did not continue to talk to Lin Qiao about the class reunion. He stood up with a smile and clinked his glass with the employee.

Everyone left the luncheon happily. After Xia ruofei saw Liang Weimin, Wu Gang, and the others off in their cars, he did not return to the villa with Hu Zi’s mother and Lin Qiao. Instead, he returned to his office in the mixed – use building alone.

Xia ruofei walked to the safe in the corner, entered the password, and used his fingerprint to open the safe. He took out a brown paper file and sat behind the desk.

Xia ruofei opened the folder with a serious expression and took out a stack of documents and photos.

If Lin Qiao was here, she would be surprised.

This was because the information and photos were all about her classmate, Xue Fei.

Xia ruofei didn’t let his guard down just because he warned Xue Fei after their encounter at the electronics mall. On the contrary, he was very concerned about Lin Qiao’s safety and had been doing a lot of work silently.

......

The information was quite complete. It listed Xue Fei’s resume since he was young, some of his frequent friends, the entertainment places he often went to, and so on.

According to the information, Xue Fei was the only son of Xue Zhengbang, the fifth – ranked Deputy Mayor of Sanshan city. Xue Zhengbang was the Deputy Mayor in charge of science, education, Culture, and health. He was in charge of the education system, so Xue Fei had naturally attended the best school in Sanshan city since he was young.

In fact, Xue Zhengbang had been promoted all the way in the education system. At first, he was only a high school teacher. Because he was good at currying favor, he quickly became the principal and then entered the education Bureau.

After that, with the help of a noble, he was transferred from the position of the Deputy Director of the city’s education Bureau to the office of the municipal government. After many years of operation in the municipal government, he finally became the Deputy Mayor in charge of science, education, Culture, and health.

Xue Zhengbang, who was 56 years old, had a son at his old age. Xue Fei was born in the year he became the Deputy Director of the education Bureau. Xue Zhengbang was already 39 years old that year, so he doted on his son very much, especially for a Deputy Mayor who was about to retire from the second – tier at his age. He had less scruples most of the time, and would use the power in his hands to satisfy his son’s unreasonable requests.

As the saying goes, a loving mother will spoil her child. However, if a father pampered his child, the negative impact on his child’s growth would undoubtedly be greater.

Xue Fei had always been a problematic student since he was young. No matter which school he went to, he was always the devil’s incarnate that gave the teachers a headache. Unfortunately, his father was the leader of the education system, so no one dared to do anything to Xue Fei. They could only pamper him and worship him.

This further caused Xue Fei’s arrogant and domineering personality.

The swelling of one’s heart was very terrifying. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

In fact, a Deputy – Mayor ranked at the bottom was nothing. A Deputy – Level cadre like him probably wouldn’t even be ranked in Sanshan city. Even the more powerful leaders of the municipal Committee didn’t take a Deputy – Mayor seriously, let alone the Standing Committee of the municipal Party Committee or the Deputy leaders of the government who ranked higher than him.

However, Xue Fei spent most of his time on campus, in the territory under his father’s jurisdiction. Naturally, he could do whatever he wanted, which gave him the illusion that no one dared to mess with him because of his father’s power.

This Xue Fei dared to flirt with the girls in his class when he was only in grade one. It was clear to see how much the education he received had failed!

Xia ruofei calmly browsed through the information. At the end of the information, there was information on Xue Fei’s main friends, his social relations, and the entertainment places he frequented.

At this moment, there was a knock on the office door.

Xia ruofei gathered the documents and photos and put them in his desk drawer. Then, he shouted,””Please enter!”

The office door was pushed open, and Lei Hu walked in.

“Brother Xia!” Lei Hu shouted.

“Sit down!”

After Lei Hu sat down, he lowered his voice and said,”Brother Xia, the person you asked us to keep an eye on seems to be making some moves today.”

Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows and said,””Tell me!”

In fact, when he heard the conversation between Xue Fei and his classmate Xia Ming outside the exam hall that day, Xia ruofei had already arranged for Lei Hu to keep an eye on Xue Fei.

This information on Xue Fei had been secretly collected and organized by Lei Hu’s men.

Tracking down a high school student was a piece of cake for the Veterans of the Special Forces. Xue Fei had not noticed anything for so many days.

Xia ruofei had a premonition that Xue Fei might have been frightened by him that day, but he might not be willing to give up after he came back to his senses. He might even cause trouble.

When he heard Lin Qiao mention the class reunion today, Xia ruofei had a premonition. That was why he returned to the office after dinner. If Lei Hu did not come to find him, he would have called him over to ask about the details of the following these few days.
