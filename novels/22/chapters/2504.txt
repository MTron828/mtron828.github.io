2505 New shareholders, new atmosphere (2)

Xia ruofei looked at the bronze statue of Dani Halk and nodded.””I heard that the fans still maintain the tradition of applauding in the 21st minute of the game, just to commemorate the legendary Captain?”

“Yup! Dani Halk wore the number 21 Jersey when he was in Espanyol. ” Wu Lei said,”CEO Xia, the football atmosphere here is really great! I like to play football here!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Then train hard. I hope you can be a main player soon!”

“Mm! I’ll take your blessings!” Wu Lei said.

The car drove into the training base. Xia ruofei sat in the car and looked around. He realized that the Dani halke base was a little small. Although the facilities were more professional, it was a little small for a top league team.

Wu Lei had strength training in the morning, so he got out of the car when they arrived at the training room. Xia ruofei sat in front of a small building and took a look at the Espanyol club’s office building.

Zhou leiyun was already waiting in front of the building. There was a man in his 30s standing beside him. This was Zhou leiyun’s spokesperson in the Spanish club, Jiang Xiaochen.

In addition to Zhou leiyun and Jiang Xiaochen, the Spanish club’s management also came to welcome them.

These managers and directors had received Zhou leiyun’s notice yesterday and knew that some of Zhou leiyun’s shares had been transferred to a boss who also came from China. They were a little nervous. After all, RCD Espanyol was a team that had been hovering near the relegation line for a long time. Zhou leiyun had suddenly reduced his shares. They did not know if there would be any changes in the club’s future business thinking.

The LA Liga rankings were very chaotic this season. Although RCD Espanyol was currently in the middle, they were not far from the European zone. At the same time, they were not far from the relegation zone. A slight mistake could lead to a relegation was not impossible. If the boss reduced his investment and caused people to be tempted, the team might collapse at the end of the season.

...

When the club management saw the young Xia ruofei get out of the car alone, they were still thinking about the transfer of shares worth tens of millions of euros. This new shareholder of the club did not even bring a legal counsel ...

However, while they were still in a daze, Zhou leiyun had already walked up to them and greeted them with great enthusiasm.

When the management saw that this rich Chinese boss’s attitude was so polite, they naturally didn’t dare to neglect and also went forward to welcome him.

After Zhou leiyun exchanged a few pleasantries with Xia ruofei, he introduced him to the management of the Espanyol club, while Jiang Xiaochen personally acted as a translator.

Jiang Xiaochen had studied in Spain in his early years and obtained a master’s degree in sports management. He had worked in many Spanish clubs before. It was only after Zhou leiyun acquired the Spanish club that he recruited Jiang Xiaochen through a headhunting company.

Jiang Xiaochen had another advantage working here. He had studied in Catalonia in Spain, so he had no problem in listening, speaking, reading, and writing Catalan.

Catalan was also the official language of Spain. Compared to standard Spanish, it was like Chinese and Cantonese. People who only knew Spanish could understand some of the meaning of Catalan, but there were still some obstacles in normal communication.

The Spanish club was a long – standing club in Catalonia. Many of its staff, including many players, were actually from Catalonia, and the language they communicated with was Catalonian.

Jiang Xiaochen’s ability to use Catalan was naturally of great help to his work.

Xia ruofei had a polite and reserved smile on his face. He shook hands with the management of the clubs one by one, then walked into the office with Zhou leiyun.

The club’s management had all returned to their respective positions and only participated in the welcome to show the importance of the club.

...

Zhou leiyun and Jiang Xiaochen accompanied Xia ruofei to an office. The legal advisor had already prepared all the documents that needed to be signed. He had also made a few copies of Xia ruofei’s passport.

After Xia ruofei signed the document, he handed it to the legal counsel along with a copy of his passport. He did not need to attend to the rest of the matters personally. The professionals would go to the officials to register and file the records. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Espanyol clubs were not listed, so the transfer of shares was relatively simple. However, with the efficiency of work in Europe, it was estimated that it would take at least five days to a week.

But in reality, Xia ruofei was now a shareholder of the Espanyol club. As the person who transferred the shares to him was Zhou leiyun, there could not be any changes in the whole process.

Then, Zhou leiyun asked Jiang Xiaochen to gather the club’s shareholders and management in the meeting room, including the first team’s head coach, Ruby. Ruby was also a very important part of the club. He naturally could not be absent from such a big event as the change in the club’s shares.

After everyone had arrived, Zhou leiyun accompanied Xia ruofei into the meeting room.

Xia ruofei had a faint smile on his face. He looked around and felt that everyone’s expressions were different. They were probably nervous.

After the two of them sat down, Zhou leiyun said,””I believe everyone knows that I’ve transferred about half of my shares to Mr. Xia ruofei. From today on, Mr. Xia ruofei will become a shareholder of the real Espanyol club and hold 25% of the club’s shares! Next, let’s invite President Xia to speak!”

After Jiang Xiaochen translated Zhou leiyun’s words, there was a rather warm round of applause in the meeting room. Everyone looked at the young new shareholder of the club.

Xia ruofei waited for the applause to die down before he smiled and said,””Thank you for your enthusiasm! I need to make it clear that this is only one of my many investments, and I don’t have much energy to pay attention to the daily operation of the club. Therefore, when I transferred the shares, I also signed a collaborative action agreement with general manager Zhou and gave him full voting rights to my shares. ”

Xia ruofei paused for a moment and waited for Jiang Xiaochen to finish translating his words before he continued,””So, Mr. Zhou leiyun will still be the chairman of the real Espanyol club. The club’s daily operations will continue as usual, and you don’t have to worry about any major changes.”

...

The shareholders, management, and head coach Ruby in the meeting room were relieved after hearing Xia ruofei’s words. They were worried that the club would undergo drastic changes. If it led to the team’s relegation, it would be a disaster. The number of Barcelona fans was not as many as Barcelona ‘s. If they were demoted to La Liga, it would be worse.

Xia ruofei continued,”before I came, I learned about the situation of the Spanish clubs and also paid attention to this season’s points ranking. They are currently ranked 15th, 11 points more than the relegation zone, but only 12 points away from the European region. It can be said that one step to heaven, one step to hell.”

However, the following schedule is still more advantageous for us. We haven’t encountered too many strong teams. If they performed well, it would be impossible for them to charge into the European battle zone. This would require the joint efforts of everyone present! What we can do is to do our best to guarantee everyone’s safety!

President Zhou and I have a consensus, and that is to hope that the real Espanyol club will return to the European tournament as soon as possible. I think there is hope this season! If the team can make it into the UEFA Europa League this season, even if it’s only the qualifiers, the bonus will definitely satisfy everyone. We’ll also increase our signing efforts next season to keep the team competitive!”

After Xia ruofei’s words were translated by Jiang Xiaochen, everyone in the meeting room had a strange look on their faces. Even Zhou leiyun looked at Xia ruofei in surprise.
