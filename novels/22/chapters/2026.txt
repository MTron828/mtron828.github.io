2027 Burning Jade and stone together (1)

As soon as old Gelman finished speaking, a figure appeared in the room strangely. It was a young Chinese man wearing a black trench coat and a faint smile on his face.

No one noticed how this young man had entered.

The manor was heavily guarded, and there were no warnings. It was as if he had appeared out of thin air.

This young man was Xia ruofei. He did not even change his appearance. He had the same face as when he had killed the core members of the Gelman family.

Of course, this face was different from the one on his passport under the name Xia Tian. It was even more impossible for it to be the same as his original appearance.

Old Gelman’s bodyguards hurriedly pulled out their guns and surrounded him.

Xia ruofei’s body swayed slightly and everyone felt their vision blur. Then, the bodyguards were shocked to find that all their guns were in Xia ruofei’s hands.

With a twist of his hand, Xia ruofei turned all the guns into twisted pieces of scrap metal.

He casually threw the scrap metal on the ground and looked at old Gelman with a smile.

Old Gehrman waved his hand to stop the bodyguards who wanted to rush up empty – handed. He knew that it was a meaningless act. Xia ruofei’s performance tonight was enough to prove his strength.

At this moment, a guard rushed in in a panic and said,Mr. Gelman, many Chinese people are attacking! Everyone can’t resist ... Ah!

He was in the middle of his sentence when he realized that Xia ruofei was standing in the middle of the room and was shocked.

Old Gelman frowned and chided,Get down! Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

The guard retreated as if he had been pardoned. Before he left, he could not help but glance at Xia ruofei. He had been standing guard not far from the door just now and had no idea how this Chinese man had gotten in.

Old Gelman did not seem to care that the manor was about to be breached. He clenched the dagger in his hand and slowly said in his English with a strong Italy accent,Young man, how about we make a deal

Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows and shrugged his shoulders. He asked with a faint smile,Mr. Gelman, what bargaining chip do you think you have to make a deal with me now

Old Gehrman pouted at the beaten – up Caras and said,Do you know who this person is He was the head of the Grao family, karlas! Using his life to exchange for mine, this is not a bad deal!

Xia ruofei looked at the ‘pig head’ on the ground and didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.What does this person have to do with me Using him to exchange for your life, is there something wrong with your brain or my brain

Old Gelman’s expression changed slightly as he said,Young man, didn’t you kill the Gelman family because of that Monica

Although Xia ruofei had changed his appearance when he was trying to assassinate Toles, it was not hard for old Gehrman to guess who he was as long as he was not too slow – witted. Hence, Xia ruofei was not surprised.

So he asked, shrugging.

Karlas is the patriarch of the Grasso family! He’s the most important person in the Grao family! I’m not asking for much, old Gelman said hopefully.I just want you to let me live. There’s no more hope for my family. I just want to find a safe place to live the rest of my life. This is a very simple matter for you.

On the ground, Calas’s mind had also cleared up a little. He seemed to have seen a glimmer of hope for survival, and quickly said in a muffled voice,Sir, I ... I’m Monica’s uncle. Please ... Save me ... Our Grao family will always remember your kindness!

All the teeth in Carras ‘mouth had been knocked out, and there was a slight leak in his speech. In addition, his English had a heavy Italy accent. Xia ruofei had a hard time listening to him, but at least he understood.

He had long known about the people of the Grasso family from Monica, especially the things that this patriarch, Caras, usually did to Monica and her brother. Therefore, he did not have a good impression of the Grasso family at all. He was even filled with disgust towards Caras.

Xia ruofei frowned and said,shut up! Do you have the right to speak here

Then, Xia ruofei looked at old Gelman with a faint smile on his face and said,Mr. Gelman, I’m a very timid person. I’ve already killed almost all the core members of your Gelman family, and I’ve also destroyed the foundation that you’ve built for so many years. It’s just that the difference in strength is too great, so you chose to endure, am I right

Old grimman’s expression changed again and again, but he did not say anything.

He did hate Xia ruofei because not only had Xia ruofei destroyed the German family’s business, but he had also killed his most valued grandson, which was equivalent to destroying the hope of the German family.

Even if he could revive the Gehrman family with his own power, he was already in his dying years. Even if he could create another family business, what was the point if no one inherited it

The only thing that kept old Gelman going was hatred.

He only hoped to survive, find the big boss of the glory society, and try his best to avenge his grandson and the other core members of the family.
