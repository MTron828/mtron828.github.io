Translator: 549690339

“A female celebrity?” Xia ruofei could not help but look at Jennifer and said with a bitter smile,”I really don’t watch entertainment news ...”

At this time, Tang Yitian said with a smile,””Little girl, it seems that your eyes are quite sharp!”

Jennifer, who was next to Tang Yitian, also took off her big sunglasses and smiled at Lin Qiao.

Lin Qiao couldn’t help but cover her mouth and cry out in surprise,””You really are Jennifer! Oh my God ...”

“Qiao’ er, lower your voice ...”Xia ruofei quickly said.

This was because Xia ruofei had already noticed that a few passengers were also looking at them.

He smiled apologetically to Tang Yitian and his wife,””I’m sorry! My sister is too excited ... Ms. Annie, please put on your sunglasses. I know it’s inconvenient for you public figures to come out. ”

Jennifer smiled and said in half – baked Chinese,””Thank you for your understanding ...”

With that, Jennifer put on her sunglasses again.

“I’m sorry ...”Lin Qiao stuck out her tongue.

“I’m fine ...” Tang Yitian said with a smile.

With a superstar as his wife, Tang Yitian was used to his fans ‘excitement.

“It’s okay,” Jennifer said with a smile.”I didn’t expect that I would still have fans in the distant China after so many years.”

Lin Qiao immediately said,”Jennifer, I really like you!” I’ve watched all the movies you’ve acted in, and I like the female hunter you played in Forest Mist the most! And the songs you sang, I’ve heard every single one of them countless times! But ... How come I haven’t seen you release any new works in the past few years?”

Xia ruofei was speechless at the side. Seeing that his godsister had suddenly become like a crazy fan, he could not help but touch his nose awkwardly.

At the same time, Xia ruofei was also a little surprised. After hearing what Lin Qiao said, it turned out that this Jennifer was also a star in film, television, and singing! However, he rarely paid attention to the entertainment industry, so he was a little ignorant.

Jennifer looked at her husband and son with a hint of tenderness and said,””After I married Isaac, I quit the entertainment industry. In your Chinese words, I’m focused on ...

Tang Yitian smiled and reminded her,””Assist the husband and teach the child!”

“Yes, yes, yes, I’ll help my husband and teach my children!” Jennifer said,”your Chinese language is too difficult. I’ve been studying very hard, but I’m still not very proficient ...”

“You’ve already said it very well!” Lin Qiao said. Then, she subconsciously looked at Tang Yitian and said,”so, you ... You’re the chairman of the Maya Group in Australia?”

Tang Yitian chuckled and nodded,””Looks like you’re really a die – hard fan of Jennifer! You’re very familiar with her situation. ”

“Qiao’ er, that’s enough ... Don’t disturb Mr. Tang and Ms. Annie ...”Xia ruofei quickly said.

Then, Xia ruofei said,”I’m so sorry!” My sister is a little excited to see her idol ...”

“It doesn’t matter!” Jennifer smiled and said,”Lin, do you want to take a picture together?”

“Really?” Lin Qiao asked excitedly.

“Of course!” Jennifer shrugged and said,”come on! Xia, please help us take a picture, thank you!”

“Use my phone!” Lin Qiao quickly stuffed her iPhone into Xia ruofei’s hands.

Then she walked to Jennifer’s side in two steps, a little reserved, but at the same time her face was filled with excitement and happiness of being able to take a photo with her idol.

Jennifer smiled, took off her sunglasses, and handed them to her husband. Then, she took Lin Qiao’s hand and smiled at the camera.

Xia ruofei took a few pictures and then made an ‘OK’ gesture.

“Thank you, Jennifer!” Lin Qiao said happily,”then I won’t disturb you ...”

Lin Qiao was a very sensible girl. Although she was very excited to see her idol, she knew when to stop and would not disturb him.

Xia ruofei also smiled and expressed his gratitude to Tang Yitian and his wife.

Then, the couple brought little Haoran back to their seats. Lin Qiao took the phone from Xia ruofei’s hand and said,””Let’s see how it’s done ...”

“What if I accidentally miss it?” Xia ruofei asked jokingly.

“Then I’ll bite you to death ...” Lin Qiao grimaced.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh when he saw her funny look.

Lin Qiao looked at the photos. The iPhone’s imaging effect was very good. In addition, both of them were beautiful women, so the photos were naturally very beautiful.

Lin Qiao read it repeatedly for a while and then muttered to herself,”It was like a dream today. I actually saw Jennifer in person and even took a picture with her! No, no, I have to post it on my moments. Jing, Juanjuan, and the others will be so envious ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you ... I really don’t understand the world of you little fangirls ...””

Lin Qiao looked at Xia ruofei with disdain and said,””Brother ruofei, you can’t just focus on making money all day. It’ll be so boring!”

“Oh, so it’s boring if you don’t care about entertainment news?” Xia ruofei laughed.”Then there are many boring people in this world!”

“I’m too lazy to talk to a stubborn person like you ...” Lin Qiao smiled and said,”let me see ... Wow! I’ve just posted it and my moments are about to explode! So many of my friends left me messages ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”let’s not bother about the comments. Tell me about this Jennifer and her husband.” They seem to be very famous?”

Lin Qiao put away her phone and turned to Xia ruofei.”Brother ruofei, I’ll give you an entertainment science class! Jennifer used to be the most popular female star in Australia. She has acted in many classic Movies and released eight solo albums. She was the double Best Actress at the Oscars and Cannes. If she hadn’t suddenly retired from the entertainment industry six or seven years ago, she would still be very popular now ...”

“Wait, she retired six or seven years ago. You were still young then, right?” Xia ruofei asked.

“Jennifer had already retired from the entertainment industry when I started liking her!” Lin Qiao said matter – of – factly,”I fell in love with Jennifer when I first saw her in ‘Sydney songstress’ at my classmate’s house in middle school. Later on, I went to look for all the movies and songs about her. In short, she is my only idol!”

“Alright, alright ...” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Lin Qiao continued,”in fact, Mr. Tang is even more powerful!” He’s Jennifer’s husband. ”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but glance at Tang Yitian in the distance and asked,””How is Mr. Tang powerful?”

“I also saw it in the entertainment news. It said that after Jennifer married a Chinese Super – rich man in Australia, she announced her withdrawal from the entertainment industry.” Lin Qiao said,”later, I did a search on the internet and found out that the Maya Group under Jennifer’s husband, Mr. Tang, is one of the top ten largest financial groups in Australia. They almost dominate the entire retail industry in Australia and have a large investment in the cultural and entertainment industry. It is said that the Maya Group’s assets exceed 10 billion Australian dollars and its annual revenue exceeds 30 billion Australian dollars. Isn’t it amazing ...”

Xia ruofei calculated silently and said,””That’s equivalent to having over 50 billion Chinese dollars in assets. That’s pretty impressive ...”

“Brother ruofei, although you’re rich, you’re still far from Mr. Tang. You still need to work hard!” Lin Qiao said with a smile.

“You dare to look down on your brother!” Xia ruofei glared at him and said,”do you believe that I won’t bring you to Australia?”

“You won ‘t!” Lin Qiao chuckled,”besides, I’ve already bought the plane tickets. That’s 40000 Yuan!” Don’t you feel bad ...”

“You little girl ...”

The two of them chatted and laughed, and time passed very quickly. At 9:10 P. M., The waiter in the VIP lounge came over and reminded them softly that they could board the plane.

Hence, Xia ruofei stood up and picked up his small luggage.

As for Lin Qiao, her extra – large suitcase had already been checked in, so she only needed to carry a backpack.

Tang Yitian’s family also stood up. Everyone smiled and nodded to each other, then they walked to the boarding gate under the guidance of the waiter.

A large Boeing 787 was parked quietly in the parking lot in front of the terminal. Xia ruofei and the others boarded the plane through the covered bridge.

The chief Steward was at the cabin door, smiling as he welcomed the first – Class passengers who had the priority to board the plane.

Everyone quickly found their seats under the guidance of a beautiful first – Class flight attendant. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

After boarding the plane, Xia ruofei found out that Tang Yitian was in business class.

The first – Class cabin had a total of four seats, two by the porthole and the other two in the middle. They were separated from the two porthole seats by an aisle.

Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao had booked first class, so there were only two seats left in the first class. Tang Yitian left these two seats for his wife and child, while he chose business class.

Xia ruofei guessed that Tang Yitian’s family must be in a hurry to get back to Australia, so they had booked the tickets at the last minute. They must have booked the tickets after him, otherwise Tang Yitian would have booked three first – Class seats.

Moreover, a rich man like Tang Yitian must have a private jet. If he wasn’t in a hurry, he wouldn’t take a civil flight. If he flew a private jet from Australia and then returned, the whole process would definitely take more time than a direct flight.

Of course, the business class seats could also be laid flat, and the rest would not be affected. The only difference was that the space layout was not as spacious as the first class seats.

Little Haoran sat by the window, while Jennifer sat in the middle seat across the aisle from little Haoran.

Lin Qiao naturally chose the seat next to Jennifer on the other side and pushed Xia ruofei to the seat by the porthole.

The facilities in the first – Class cabin were very advanced. The seats were made of pure leather and could be completely reclined to become a soft and comfortable single bed. For a long – distance night flight like this, the comfort level of the economy cabin was a world of difference compared to the economy cabin.

After waiting for a while on the plane, the cabin door closed, and the plane began to be pushed out, slowly gliding on the runway.

In a short while, the Boeing 787 giant arrived at the end of the runway. After receiving instructions from the control tower, the plane quickly accelerated on the runway and finally leaped into the dark night sky ...

After the plane was at a level, Xia ruofei unbuckled his seat belt and put on his headphones. He leaned back in the spacious and comfortable first – Class seat and closed his eyes to rest.

After about half an hour, Xia ruofei felt a little sleepy. Just as he was about to get up and ask the flight attendant to come over and put his seat back to normal, he suddenly heard Jennifer’s panicked voice,””Allan! Allan! Allen’s sick again ...”
