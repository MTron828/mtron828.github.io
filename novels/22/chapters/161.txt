Chapter 162: It’s actually her (1)

Xia ruofei took the special elevator to the third floor. Tonight, the Grao family’s truffle auction would be held in the grand banquet hall on the third floor of the hotel. The elevator reached the third floor and Xia ruofei strode towards the banquet hall. Along the way, the decorations were magnificent, and precious works of art could be seen inadvertently. The crystal lamps everywhere were all custom – made from Czech Republic, and only Hengfeng Jiahua Hotel had them in the world. Xia ruofei had stayed there for more than a day and was already immune to the luxury that was everywhere. He did not stop along the way. Xia ruofei walked along the corridor paved with Jade and colored glass. After turning a corner, he saw a huge Hall. The auction hadn’t started yet, but the well – dressed guests were standing in the hall and talking. “Brother RUO Fei!” Xia ruofei heard a clear child’s voice. He looked in the direction of the voice and saw Huanhuan waving at him with a happy face. Huan Huan was wearing a custom – made cheongsam with a blue and white porcelain pattern on it. Tian Huixin, who was beside her, was also wearing a cheongsam of the same style. It was obvious that they were wearing a mother – and – daughter outfit. When the two of them stood together, they immediately exuded a strong Chinese style. Lu You was also with Tian Huixin and her daughter. Tonight, she was wearing a black off – Shoulder evening dress. Her beautiful collarbones were faintly visible, and a pure – colored Emerald on her white chest exuded a charming Halo. Her tall black hair was in a perfect match with her beautiful Swan – like neck. Her slender waist was tightly wrapped in the fitting long dress, outlining an alluring curve. It was Xia ruofei’s first time seeing Lu You in a formal suit. This kind of noble and cold temperament made him take a deep breath and take a second look. Lu You also felt Xia ruofei’s gaze and turned to look at him. Xia ruofei quickly looked away and subconsciously tidied his clothes to hide his embarrassment. Lu You saw Xia ruofei’s actions, and her lips curled up into a beautiful smile. Xia ruofei took a deep breath and adjusted his emotions. Then, he walked towards Huanhuan with a smile on his face. “Huanhuan, you’re so beautiful today!” Xia ruofei said with a smile. “Thank you, brother ruofei!” Huan Huan said happily. Then, she asked,”brother ruofei, who do you think is more beautiful, sister Youyou or Huan Huan?” A few uncles came over to talk to Sister Youyou just now and praised her for her beauty!” “Uh ...” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be stunned. Tian Huixin chuckled as she watched the show from the side. Lu You also revealed a half – Smile as she glanced at Xia ruofei. “You two are both beautiful!” Xia ruofei had no other choice but to give a mediocre answer. “Sister Youyou is a great beauty, and Huanhuan is a little beauty. When Huanhuan grows up, she will become a great beauty!” He added. Lu You’s pretty face couldn’t help but blush slightly as she spat. “Really?” Huan Huan asked happily. “Of course! When has brother ruofei ever lied to you?” Xia ruofei said with a smile. “En!” Huan Huan nodded heavily. “Xia Sheng!” Not far away, MA Xiong waved at Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei greeted Tian Huixin and Lu You and walked towards MA Xiong. MA Xiong even walked up to them personally and introduced Xia ruofei to his business friends. Anyone who could stand beside MA Xiong and Exchange pleasantries with him was no ordinary person. Anyone here was worth billions. Since MA Xiong valued Xia ruofei so much, these people would not neglect him. They all smiled and greeted Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei did not have stage fright and responded to them in a neither humble nor arrogant manner. These people were all curious about Xia ruofei because it was rare for MA Xiong to pay so much attention to a young man. However, MA Xiong had only introduced Xia ruofei as a friend from the mainland. He did not go into details, so it was not convenient for them to ask. After some small talk in the hall, it was almost time to enter. Everyone walked into the largest banquet hall of the Jiahua Hotel. The banquet hall was about 700 square meters in area and had a column – less design. Anyone in the hall could see the main stage in front of them. The banquet hall was eight meters high and had a 180 – degree river view. At the front, it was equipped with an 82 – Square – meter super high – definition LED screen and a high – end B& & Q Sound system. The giant crystal lamp on the ceiling was also a custom – made product from Czech Republic. As the owner of Hengfeng Jiahua and one of the biggest buyers of the past truffle auctions, MA Xiong naturally had the best seats. The five seats in the middle of the front row were reserved for MA Xiong and his team. Xia ruofei followed MA Xiong and everyone sat down. MA Xiong sat in the middle while Ma Zhiming and Xia ruofei sat on either side of him. Tian Huixin carried Huan Huan and sat beside Ma Zhiming while Lu You sat beside Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei could feel a faint fragrance entering his nose. He felt his body stiffen and he couldn’t help but look straight ahead. Xia ruofei, who could joke around with billionaires like MA Xiong, now felt a little nervous. Fortunately, the large LED screen in front of them began to play the promotional video of the truffle auction. The truffle hunter and the truffle dogs stepped on the morning dew and walked into the oak Forest. Pieces of truffles with the fragrance of the earth were dug out from the ground. Then, the image flashed, and the truffles appeared on the table, along with the intoxicated faces of the guests ... Xia ruofei gradually relaxed and focused on the promotional video. After a very well – shot promotional video, the host in a formal suit came on stage. “Welcome, distinguished guests, to the Grao family’s truffle auction! I’m your host, Johnson!” The host was also speaking in English, but each seat was equipped with a simultaneous interpretation headset, which could be used to choose different languages through the multi – function button on the armrest. Xia ruofei was not using his headphones. He realized that Lu You, who was beside him, was not wearing headphones either. It seemed that her English listening and speaking skills were not weak either. After a simple self – introduction, the host said in an infectious voice,””Next, let us welcome the third in line successor of the Grasso family, the Senior Vice President of the Grasso group, Ms. Monica Grasso, to the stage for her speech!” In the midst of everyone’s applause, the spotlight shone at the entrance of the stage, and a slim figure appeared. She was wearing a sapphire blue evening dress inlaid with crystals, and her white and slender feet looked as gentle as Jade under the contrast of the black string high heels. Monica grazso walked up the stage leisurely. Her dress glowed brightly under the spotlight. Every step she took had a kind of swaying beauty, and her white and charming legs seemed to bloom with silent temptation. When Xia ruofei saw the successor of the Grasso family, he opened his mouth wide in shock and almost stood up from his seat. It was her ...
