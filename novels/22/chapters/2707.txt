2708 Let’s start then (2)

Of course, even if they didn’t make any adjustments, it wouldn’t affect the operation of the entire formation. It might be slightly delayed at some nodes, but the overall power wouldn’t be reduced by much.

However, since Xia ruofei had discovered it, he would have to adjust it. After all, no one would complain about the power of their formation. Not to mention that the array would soon welcome a wave of tests. The closer the array was to perfection, the more capital he had.

Hence, Xia ruofei silently noted down the few areas that needed to be modified. Then, his figure flashed and he flew towards the cement room where the core array disc was placed.

Li Yifu was still sitting cross – legged on the ground, completely immersed in his cultivation state.

Even though Xia ruofei did not want to disturb Li Yifu’s cultivation, he only hesitated for a moment before he shot a wisp of spiritual energy into the core array board and stopped the operation of the array immediately.

After the Taixu xuanqing formation stopped, the surrounding spiritual energy lost the support and supplement of the formation, and the concentration of spiritual energy naturally dropped rapidly.

Li Yifu soon felt that his spiritual energy had become impure, and he naturally left his cultivation state.

When he opened his eyes, he saw that Xia ruofei had already taken out the core array disc and the three crystals.

Li Yifu quickly stood up and bowed to Xia ruofei.””Senior granduncle, you’re back!”

Xia ruofei nodded.”Adopted husband, in order to prevent the star Seizer sect from sending people to spy on us from the outside, the Taixu xuanqing formation can not be used for long periods of time. I stopped the formation.”

“I’m fine! I’m fine!” Li Yifu quickly said,”I also think that it’ll be a waste if I don’t cultivate with such a high concentration of spirit Qi ...” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Mm! After getting rid of the hidden danger of the star Seizer sect, I can cultivate at any time and place in the future!” Xia ruofei said,”that’s why we’re not in a hurry.”

“I understand, martial granduncle!” Li Yifu said. Then, he quickly asked,”by the way, senior granduncle, you’ve checked the array just now. Is there any problem with it?”

Xia ruofei said,”overall, the effect is better than I expected.” A formation at the level of the Taixu xuanqing formation was indeed worthy of its reputation! However, I’ve also discovered that there are a few areas that need to be adjusted. Let’s go back first, and I’ll immediately list out the details of the adjustments for you. Tomorrow morning, you can arrange for the brothers of the Hong sect to complete it. ”

“Alright, martial granduncle!” Li Yifu replied without hesitation.

“The adjustments aren’t big. It should be completed soon.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”after the adjustment, the power of the formation can be increased by at least five to ten percent! I’ve personally gone to test the various changes of the formation. Even an Aurous core stage cultivator would find it difficult to escape, unless he has some life – saving means!”

“That’s great! Senior granduncle!” Li Yifu said excitedly,”this way, the star Seizer sect can’t do anything to us!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”I didn’t see the star Seizer sect as a big threat to begin with. Actually, I’m more worried about this news. If it’s leaked and spread to the cultivation world, we’ll be in deep trouble.” If one or two nascent soul eccentrics are drawn out, the current strength of the formation may not be able to stop them ...”

“Yup!” Li Yifu had lived for almost ninety years. Naturally, it was easy for him to figure out the key to the problem.”However, the issue is beyond our control. I hope that the star Seizer sect will keep the news to a relatively small extent for their own interests!”

“We can only bet like this now.” Xia ruofei said calmly,”regardless of whether this news has been leaked or not, the star Seizer sect is still a problem that must be resolved! Let’s go back first! Adjust the formation to its best condition tomorrow and welcome our ‘guest’!”

“Yes! Senior granduncle!” Li Yifu said.

The two of them quickly returned to the warehouse in the airport without anyone noticing. Although it was already the second half of the night, the two of them were not sleepy at all.

They sat under the table lamp. Xia ruofei held the original construction plan and used a red pen to mark the positions that needed to be changed as he explained to Li Yifu. Li Yifu listened attentively and nodded from time to time to show that he understood.

There were a total of five areas that needed to be adjusted, and the changes weren’t very big. Some were to increase the depth of the materials by ten centimeters, some were to adjust the position by one or two degrees, and some were to add one or two materials. In short, they were all relatively simple to operate.

After listening to the story, Li Yifu said without hesitation,””Senior granduncle, we’ll definitely be able to finish adjusting it within half a day!”

“Good! I’ll leave it to you guys!” Xia ruofei said,”tomorrow, I will personally check the position of each adjustment! Go and rest first. Only by recuperating will you be able to better deal with the incoming enemies!”

“Yes! Senior granduncle!” Li Yifu put away the construction plan, walked to the other side, and lay down to sleep.

Xia ruofei also fell asleep on the military bed and soon fell asleep.

The next day, after breakfast, Li Yifu led his brothers to the few points that needed to be adjusted and made changes.

Xia ruofei sat in the warehouse, going through the entire plan in his mind several times to make sure that there were no obvious flaws.

At around 10 am, Li Yifu came to the warehouse in high spirits and reported to Xia ruofei that the five areas that needed to be adjusted had been completed.

Xia ruofei personally went to the Five Points to make sure that there were no mistakes in the adjustments. If there were any mistakes during the adjustments, it might affect the formation greatly. It would be better if they did not make any adjustments. In serious cases, the formation might not even be able to be activated. Hence, Xia ruofei did not dare to be careless.

After confirming, Xia ruofei finally revealed a satisfied smile.

This time, there was no need to activate the formation to test it. Xia ruofei was 100% sure that the formation would be activated after the adjustment and its power would increase by a lot.

After returning to the warehouse, Xia ruofei called Li Yifu and benilatti over and said with bright eyes,””Now, everything is ready, but we’re just short of the crucial wind! It’s time to start our plan!”

Li Yifu and benilatti both looked excited. They had prepared for so long just for this day.

Xia ruofei looked at Li Yifu and said,””Foster husband, you’re in charge of the personnel. This time, whether it’s the employees of Paradise Island or the brothers of the Hong sect, all of you are to go to the shelter at Qingyun mountain. No one is allowed to leave without orders.”

Back then, the Liu family had used the green cloud Island as the family’s last barrier, so not only had they equipped the island with advanced weapons and equipment, but they had also dug out the inside of the only small hill on the island and built a solid shelter.

The construction standards of this Fallout Shelter were quite high, and it could even be preserved in a nuclear attack and isolate radiation.

The space in the shelter was enough to accommodate the members of the Hong sect and the employees of Paradise Island. There was also sufficient food, drinking water, and other supplies. The shelter was originally built to avoid the disaster, so it was natural that these supplies were fully prepared.

Although this was a bit of a restriction on personal freedom, there was Tang Hu in the Hong sect and Liu Qingfeng in the Liu family’s staff. Xia ruofei felt that even if there were some complaints, there should be no problem.

As for the mercenaries stationed on Peach Blossom Island, he naturally called them and told them to stay in the camp for the next two days. Otherwise, they would bear the consequences if anything happened.

“No problem!” Li Yifu replied,”I’ll make the arrangements now!”

Xia ruofei waved his hand.”There’s no hurry. We’ll organize our men to enter the shelter after dinner. There’s still time!”

“Alright, martial granduncle!” Li Yifu replied.

Then, Xia ruofei looked at bainilatti and asked,””The most important call is about to be made. Are you sure you remember every word I said?”

“Yes, Mr. Xia!” “I promise there won’t be any problems!” Benilatti said with certainty.

“Very good!” Xia ruofei said.

After he finished speaking, he didn’t let bynilati make the call. Instead, he took out his phone, found Wang Boshan’s number, and dialed it.
