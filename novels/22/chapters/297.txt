Chapter 298: Chapter 294 – eager to return (1)

Down the rock wall, Xia ruofei saw elder song and the others sitting in the pavilion called Jiulong teahouse, making tea and talking. He walked straight over. They were all sitting around the antique tea table. A young woman in a cheongsam with a blue and white porcelain pattern was making tea for everyone. Her green and Jade fingers were holding the tea set, and her movements were smooth and natural. It looked very pleasing to the eye. There were a few brown herbal tea eggs on the coffee table. They must be the ‘number one egg in the world’ that song Rui bought. Master Song saw Xia ruofei and asked with a smile,””Little Xia, how do you feel after seeing the Da Hong Pao parent trees?” “Bureau chief, how can a layman like me see anything?” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I feel that they are similar to the tea trees in the tea garden, but they are a little older.” “There’s a need to pay attention to this,”said eccentric song with a laugh. “I’m definitely particular about it, but I’m an amateur! “It’s just something new ...”Xia ruofei said as he sat down. The pretty lady who was brewing the tea immediately handed Xia ruofei a cup of tea. “Thank you!” Xia ruofei said. He picked up the teacup and took a sip, then asked,””Bureau chief, how do you feel after walking all the way?” “Guilin’s mountains and rivers are the best in the world, not as good as a small hill in Wuyi. This is not an exaggeration!” Although it was just a cursory view this time, one can see the whole picture with just a glimpse. The Wu Yi Mountains and rivers are truly beautiful and fragrant!” It was obvious that elder song was in a good mood today. Du Xiaohai was naturally very happy. He struck while the iron was hot and asked,””Bureau chief, why don’t we ... Sit on some bamboo skewers next? If you go down the nine winding stream, you can basically see most of the scenic spots on Mount Wu Yi. ” Elder song was a little tempted, but before he could say anything, song Rui’s phone rang. Song Rui answered the call and said a few words before handing the phone to elder song.””Grandpa, it’s Uncle Lu.” Elder song raised his eyebrows and took the phone.”Hello, Xiao Lu ...” Manager Lu said something on the other end of the phone, but Dr. Song’s face changed slightly. He stood up and slowly walked out of the tea room.”Is the situation serious?” Du Xiaohai looked at elder song nervously, his heart beating like a drum. He didn’t know if there was another problem in the city. After listening for a while, elder song said,””Xiao Lu, contact the relevant comrades in the southeast province and arrange for a better hospital in Sanshan city. Also, get a few experts to do a consultation for brother Fu.” Soon, elder song finished the call and exchanged the phone with song Rui. “Secretary du, thank you for your kind invitation!” He said to du Xiaohai. But I won’t be sitting on the bamboo raft this time. Li Zhifu has a small health problem, so I want to go back and see him. ” “Alright, this way please, chief.” Du Xiaohai quickly said. He heaved a sigh of relief in his heart. Fortunately, there wasn’t any problem in the city. They walked out of the scenic Area. Xia ruofei walked beside elder song and asked in a low voice,””Chief, is old Mr. Li’s condition very serious?” “The doctor said that it might be a kidney stone that caused the abdominal pain,” said elder song.”It shouldn’t be life – threatening, but I think it’s better to arrange a hospital for brother Fu in San Shan for treatment. After all, the medical conditions and experts in the provincial capital are better than here.” “Okay, let’s go to the three mountains for treatment!” Xia ruofei nodded. Soon, everyone arrived at the entrance of the Da Hong Pao attraction. The group got on the car and left. Du Xiaohai was tactful and did not follow them into the car. Instead, he waved goodbye to elder song and the others at the entrance of the attraction. After getting in the car, elder song told the driver to drive to yangdun town because li Zhifu had already returned home. When they arrived at the Yusheng electrical appliance repair shop in yangdun town, Niu Yusheng was fiddling with a broken TV. When he saw elder song and the others, Niu Yusheng quickly stood up and greeted,””Chief, you’re here ...” “Yusheng, where’s brother Fu?” Elder song asked kindly. “Dad is upstairs!” Niu Yusheng said,”this way, please ...” Elder song and the other two followed Niu Yusheng upstairs. Li Zhifu was sitting in the living room, making tea and talking with manager Lu. “Dad, the chief is here to see you!” Niu Yusheng said. “Little song, you’re here!” Li Zhifu seemed to be in good spirits.”Come and have some tea!” Manager Lu also quickly stood up and greeted elder song. Elder song walked over and sat down beside li Zhifu.””Brother Fu, I heard from Xiao Lu that you found kidney stones? Come back to the three mountains with me! I’ve asked Xiao Lu to contact a hospital in Sanshan city. ” “Song, there’s no need to go through so much trouble. It’s not a big problem ... The hospital here can treat it all the same!” Li Zhifu said. “The conditions here aren’t good!” Elder song said,”brother Fu, you should come back with me!” Niu Yusheng also advised,”father, since the chief has said so, you should go to San Shan for treatment!” The hospital in the provincial city has better facilities and the doctors are highly skilled. It’s much better than this small place. ” “I’m not going! “There’s nothing wrong with it ...”Li Zhifu said stubbornly. “Brother Fu, I’ve arranged a good job for you, but if you don’t come back with me for treatment, I’ll have to cancel it,” elder song said after some thought. Li Zhifu looked at elder song and asked, “You’re giving me an assignment?” “That’s right!”Elder song laughed. Haven’t you always been worried that your tea – making skills would be lost in your hands? “Today, I’ve spoken to the leaders of your local government to invite you to the vocational College’s tea – making major to give lessons to the students. In addition, you can also find a few excellent students to take in as your disciples and let them follow you to learn tea – making skills ...” Li Zhifu’s eyes lit up when he heard that. Elder song also smiled. He knew that although li Zhifu had announced his “retirement” for more than ten years, his love for this industry had not diminished. He had always hoped that someone could pass on his tea – making skills. Thus, he struck while the iron was hot and said,”brother Fu, it’s not easy to preach and teach!” It was not good to be in poor health. And school has already started. The faster you recover, the earlier you can go to school, right?” “You little song!” Li Zhifu said with a bitter smile. He has grasped my pulse! It seems like I have to go back with you ...” Elder song laughed and said,”Yusheng, pack up brother Fu’s things. We’ll go back to San Shan after having lunch here!” “Good! Thank you, chief!” Niu Yusheng said hurriedly. Everyone had lunch together at li Zhifu’s house. After that, Niu Yusheng and Li Guizhi sent li Zhifu to the car. Li Zhifu even brought along his precious tea leaves, saying that they were for elder song. Since he wanted to treat li Zhifu’s illness, elder song decided to take a taxi on the way back. The Wuyishan North Station, which was the closest to the city, had very few trains, and the Wuyi SD station was far away. It would be faster to drive back to Sanshan. The Mercedes – Benz MPV met up with the two Mercedes – Benz sedans led by Huang Fang at the intersection. The three cars formed a small fleet and went directly onto the highway from outside the city, heading in the direction of Sanshan city. Xia ruofei, who was sitting in the passenger seat of the business car, was also eager to go home. He wanted to go home as soon as possible and then cut the branches of the Da Hong Pao parent trees in the medium. Three hours later, the car exited the highway at the East exit of Sanshan city. Just then, Xia ruofei’s phone rang. He took it out and saw that it was Liang Qichao calling. He could guess the purpose of the call. Xia ruofei answered the call with a hint of excitement.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com
