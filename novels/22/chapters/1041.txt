Chapter 1042: Top – Level insurance (1)

Translator: 549690339

When Xia ruofei arrived at the courtyard with a large thermal container, a black Mercedes – Benz had just arrived at the entrance of the villa.

A middle – aged man in a navy blue suit and tie quickly got out of the car from the passenger seat and jogged to Xia ruofei.

“Hello, Mr. Xia. I’m Xue Ming, who just contacted you!” The middle – aged man said respectfully,”the private jet sent by Chairman MA has landed at Sanshan International Airport. The flight crew has sent a message that their application to take off in an hour to return to Hong Kong has been approved.”

Xue Ming was the newly appointed Hengfeng group’s San Shan office manager. Although the office was only a liaison agency responsible for coordination, security, and other work, he still had a lot of power as a manager and had a small influence within the entire group.

Because San Shan was a special place, Xue Ming knew very well that the Father – in – Law of the General Manager, Ma Zhiming, was in San Shan. The family of Ma Zhiming’s father – in – Law was very influential in the mainland’s political scene. Ma Zhiming’s sister – in – Law, Ms. Tian Huilan, had even reached a high position at the official level.

In addition to MA Xiong’s growing age, Ma Zhiming was now more and more in charge of the company’s business, and it was only a matter of time before he took over.

Therefore, the manager of the Sanshan office must be someone the MA family trusted very much. The previous two office managers were both put in important positions after they were transferred back to the company’s headquarters.

Even so, Xue Ming still did not dare to show the slightest neglect when facing this young Mr. Xia.

This was because the previous office manager had told him during the handover that in addition to handling the daily business of the company, he had to pay attention to befriending two people when working in San Shan. One was naturally Boss Ma’s father – in – Law, professor Tian, and the other was this CEO Xia of paradise Corporation.

And this time, Chairman MA Xiong had sent a special plane to San Shan to pick up Mr. Xia, which showed how deep the relationship between Mr. Xia and the MA family was.

In the face of such a person, how could Xue Ming dare to show the slightest disrespect?

After he finished speaking, he immediately reached out and took the large thermal container from Xia ruofei’s hands. His actions were very natural.

“Thank you for your hard work, manager Xue!” Xia ruofei smiled.

“I wouldn’t dare!” Xue Ming quickly said.

When he opened the trunk, he found that the spacious trunk had been modified in advance. There was a small refrigerator in it. Since the refrigerator that came with the Mercedes – Benz was not big enough to hold more than 20 big abalones, MA Xiong had personally asked the San Shan office to modify the trunk overnight.

The small refrigerator was not standard in the car, so it was also installed with a transformer to supply power from the car.

It was only about half an hour’s drive from Taoyuan farm to the airport, but he had already gone through so much trouble. It was clear how much importance MA Xiong placed on these abalones.

Xia ruofei followed Xue Ming to the back of the car. He personally entered the password to open the thermal box. Then, he and Xue Ming put the abalones into the refrigerator one by one.

In the morning, Xia ruofei had specially put these abalones in the refrigerator for a while, so they were still cold in his hands.

After the abalone was packed, Xue Ming quickly opened the back door for Xia ruofei. He respectfully invited Xia ruofei into the car before he sat in the front passenger seat.

The Mercedes – Benz started steadily, left Taoyuan farm, and drove toward Sanshan airport, which was not far from the farm.

There was a small building next to the airport terminal, which was the entrance and exit passage for private planes and public planes.

After the Mercedes – Benz was parked, Xue Ming quickly took out the abalone from the refrigerator and carefully put it into the thermal container. Then, he personally carried the thermal container and walked into the small building with Xia ruofei.

One of the benefits of taking a private plane was that the security checks were relatively loose. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

At the entrance of the passage, a security personnel checked Xia ruofei’s Hong Kong and Macau Pass and Xue Ming’s temporary pass to enter and exit the airport’s restricted area. Then, he did a simple check on the abalone in the thermal box and let them in.

Xue Ming carried the thermal lunch box and led Xia ruofei through the tunnel. They arrived at the tarmac in no time.

This place was a few hundred meters away from the terminal, and it was specially used to Park small planes and business jets.

A Gulfstream 650 plane was already quietly parked there. The captain, the co – Pilot, and two flight attendants were waiting quietly beside the plane.

This was not the first time Xia ruofei had taken this luxurious public jet.

The first time was when MA Xiong had a sudden cerebral hemorrhage in Hong Kong. Xia ruofei and Ma Zhiming’s family had rushed to Hong Kong and successfully saved MA Xiong from the brink of death.

The second time was when he went to Shen Cheng city with MA Xiong to attend the truffle auction.

Hence, Xia ruofei was even more familiar with the captain.

He greeted the flight crew with a smile while Xue Ming handed the insulated box to a flight attendant with a slim figure and a pretty face. He then said goodbye to Xia ruofei very politely and left the tarmac.

Xia ruofei got on the plane with the crowd. The flight attendant had already received instructions to store the precious abalone in the plane’s refrigerator.

The flight crew had already turned on their APUs, so even though the plane was parked on the ground, the power supply in the cabin was not affected.

Xia ruofei boarded the plane and the door closed quickly.

There were still about 20 minutes before the scheduled take – off time. The captain and co – Pilot went into the cockpit to prepare for the flight. Xia ruofei leaned back in the soft and wide leather seat and browsed the news on his iPad.
