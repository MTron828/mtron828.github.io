2041 A confused look (3)

He took a deep breath and said,”yes!” It’ll take some time to get the visa, so I’ll come over as soon as possible!”

“I’ll wait for you!” Monica said, and then gave him a kiss over the phone.”Yeah!”

……

After Xia ruofei hung up the phone, he hailed a taxi and headed to the courtyard in liuhai Lane.

In the car, Xia ruofei gave Zhao Yongjun a call.

“Brother Zhao, I’m back!” Xia ruofei said.

“It’s good that you’re back! It’s good that you’re back!” Zhao Yongjun let out a sigh of relief.”You don’t know how worried I was when you were out! If anything were to happen to you, I’d feel guilty for the rest of my life ...”

“Is it that serious?” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I haven’t seen you for a few days and you’ve learned how to be emotional?”

“Get lost! Am I stirring up emotions? It’s clearly a deep brotherly love, alright?” Zhao Yongjun laughed and scolded,”ruofei, since you’re back, I’ll call song Rui, Hou Liang, and the others tonight. I’m here to prepare for a game! Speaking of which, you haven’t seen them for a long time!”

“Let’s not rush into this first!” Xia ruofei said,”I’ll be staying in Beijing for a few days. There will be plenty of opportunities to drink and chat! Big brother Zhao, I have something I need to trouble you with!”

“Yo, yo, yo! And you’re being so polite with me!” Zhao Yongjun said,”if you have anything to say, just say it! How come you’ve learned to dawdle?”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.”I want to go to Italy. About the visa ...”

“Wait! What did you just say?” Zhao Yongjun interrupted Xia ruofei.”Is there something wrong with my ears, or did I just transmigrate?”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry,”you didn’t hear wrong. Xia ruofei! I want to go to Italy!”

Since they were in a taxi, Xia ruofei couldn’t explain it too clearly, but how could Zhao Yongjun not react to it?

“RUO Fei! What’s going on with you?” Zhao Yongjun smiled bitterly and said,”so you’re going against Italy? I’ll go out with a different identity, then another identity, and then another trip ...”

“It’s a special case ...” Xia ruofei said.”And it’s a safe trip. There won’t be any problems!” It’s just that I’m in a hurry, so I’ll need you to help me find someone for the visa. Hurry up!”

A few days ago, Zhao Yongjun had helped him with the same thing. Xia ruofei naturally knew that Zhao Yongjun had this channel, so he didn’t stand on ceremony with him.

“Alright! I’ll go and say hello!” Zhao Yongjun said,”brother, if you come here a few more times, the guy at the Italy Embassy will definitely suspect that I’m a professional in getting visas. Why does this happen every two or three days?”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.””Then I’ll leave this matter to you! I’m a little tired after flying for more than ten hours. Let’s not get together today, tomorrow! I’ll treat all the brothers to a big meal in the courtyard house!”

“You said it!” Zhao Yongjun said.

“I said it! When the time comes, I’ll personally cook, and you’ll have enough good wine and good food!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”let’s drink till we’re drunk! No one is allowed to leave early tomorrow. If you’re drunk, just sleep in the guest room. I have a lot of rooms over there anyway!”

Xia ruofei’s words fell into the taxi driver’s ears, and he could not help but glance at Xia ruofei through the rearview mirror.

It was mainly because Xia ruofei’s tone was too arrogant. In a place like the capital, saying that he had more rooms was definitely showing off his wealth!

“Alright!” Zhao Yongjun replied happily.

After hanging up, Xia ruofei was about to keep his phone when he received a new email notification ...Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))
