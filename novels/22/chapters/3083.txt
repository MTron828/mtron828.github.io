3084 Investigation (1)

Xia ruofei had been cultivating on Peach Blossom Island for the past few days.

Under the effect of the time flow difference of 1800 times, he could see the two wild tea trees growing a little every day.

He also used these few days to sort out some of the techniques he had mastered and finally picked out a technique that was more suitable for Song Wei and Ling Qingxue to practice alone.

This cultivation technique was called the “nichang Heart Sutra.” It was especially suitable for the two of them. Moreover, it was also a cultivation technique specially made for female cultivators.

In addition, the “nichang Heart Sutra” not only had cultivation methods, but it also had a set of moves. When these moves were used together with the cultivation method, not only was it very powerful, but more importantly, it was very beautiful. It was as if one was wearing a rainbow feather dress and dancing. In the beautiful dance, there was a fatal killing intent hidden.

In addition, the “nichang Heart Sutra” also recorded a secret skill of sound wave attack. However, it needed to be used with the zither, and it had a high requirement on mental power and true Qi.

Xia ruofei didn’t know if Song Wei and Ling Qingxue could master the secret skill of sound wave attack. However, even if they didn’t have this secret skill, the “nichang Heart Sutra” was very suitable for the two of them to cultivate. It was as if it was tailor – made.

After Xia ruofei went through all the techniques he had learned, he decided on this technique without much hesitation.

He decided that the next time he returned to China, he would teach this technique to Song Wei and Ling Qingxue. That way, they would be able to cultivate on their own.

Xia ruofei had been on the Peach Blossom Island for the past few days. He had even gone to the guard station to drink and chat with his old comrades. At the same time, he had also understood their current situation.

All in all, the ex – soldiers were very satisfied with their life on the Paradise Island.

Although the guards ‘responsibilities were not light, it was nothing to the Veterans who had been in the Army for so many years.

Xia ruofei gave them a high salary and better food than when they were in China. Other than being a little far from home, there really wasn’t any other shortcomings.

The ordinary staff might still feel that the island was isolated and that life on the island was far away from civilization. They would feel lonely.

However, for these old soldiers who had been accompanied by the Cold Moon at the border all year round and could only see their families a few times a year, there was basically no difference between life on the Peach Blossom Island and life in the military camp.

What’s more, it was more humane here. They could take turns to leave the island every year, and the company would reimburse the travel expenses so that they could go home and reunite with their families.

In addition, family members who met the requirements and there were suitable positions here could be recruited to work on the island first and reunite overseas.

The ex – soldiers were all very satisfied.

What made Xia ruofei even happier was that more than one veteran told him that living on Paradise Island was particularly comfortable and that his body was getting better and better. Not only did he not feel uncomfortable on the island, but he also did not have a cold or fever. In fact, everyone was the same.

Some of the occupational habits that everyone had in the Army even began to slowly improve.

Xia ruofei knew that this was the work of the Taixu xuanqing formation. The Veterans had been living in an environment rich in spiritual Qi for a long time. Although they would not evolve into cultivators, their bodies would definitely be very healthy. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

It was no exaggeration to say that living in the Taixu xuanqing formation all year round would at least allow one to live a long life without illness or disaster.

Every day that passed in the outside world was equivalent to five years of growth for the wild tea trees in the spirit map space.

In fact, the wild tea tree already had a lot of leaves, but Xia ruofei did not plan to pick the tea leaves for the time being. He wanted to let the wild tea tree grow for a few more days.

In just a few days, the wild tea tree had grown for almost twenty to thirty years.

However, the trunk was only 20 to 30 centimeters thick, which was nothing compared to the wild tea tree on the cliff of the heavenly sect.

Xia ruofei wasn’t afraid that the wild tea would have no effect after being picked, nor was he worried that the wild tea would hurt his Foundation. What he was afraid of was that the current tea leaves were semi – finished and had a certain effect on cultivation, but they couldn’t achieve the same effect as the wild tea of the first heaven sect.

Wild tea could only be consumed once. It would not have the effect of promoting cultivation a second time.

If he wanted to test the effects of the wild tea, he could only test it on the disciples of the star Seizer sect. Furthermore, he had to let Luo Qingfeng choose the most reliable and talented disciple.

Xia ruofei would feel bad if the disciples who tried the wild tea did not make much progress in their cultivation and could not consume wild tea again in the future because of the age.

Although he would definitely use the star Seizer sect’s disciples to test the effects of the wild tea in the future, Xia ruofei would rather wait a little longer to be on the safe side.

……

Just as Xia ruofei was cultivating on the Peach Blossom Island every day and paying attention to the growth of the wild tea trees, thousands of miles away in the depths of Mount Tai, China, a black shadow appeared in the study of Chen Nanfeng’s residence on Yun Xiao peak in the dark of the first heaven society, which was shrouded in layers of formations.

Chen Nanfeng was reading a thread – bound book with great interest under the light. When the black figure entered the study, he didn’t even look up and asked indifferently,””What did you find?”

The black figure took a step forward and walked into the range of the light.

He was dressed in black, and his entire head was covered by a black hood, only revealing a pair of bright eyes.

The black – robed man cupped his fists at Chen Nanfeng and said respectfully,””Reporting to sect leader, after a few days in the teahouse, I’ve basically figured out Xia Tian’s situation! His real name is Xia ruofei in the secular world and he’s quite famous, so it’s easy to find his information ...”

After he finished speaking, the black – clothed man flipped his hand, and a stack of papers appeared in his hand.

Clearly, he also had a storage treasure.

The Man in Black handed the stack of papers to Chen Nanfeng respectfully and said,””This is all the information your subordinate has gathered.”

Chen Nanfeng took the stack of papers, but he didn’t flip through them. Instead, he calmly said,””I want to hear you out first. It’s more direct this way.”

“Yes! Sect leader!” The Man in Black lowered his head slightly and said,”Xia ruofei, male, 26 years old, from Sanshan city, Southeast province of Huaxia ...”

If Xia ruofei were here, he would be drenched in cold sweat. This Man in Black had a clear grasp of his situation since he was born. There were some things that he might not even remember, such as the three model students Award he had won in primary school ...

Chen Nanfeng quietly listened to the black – shirted man’s introduction, then opened the stack of papers and read.

Most of the information was downloaded from the public, including Xia ruofei’s own Weibo.

Chen Nanfeng flipped through the book very quickly and finished reading it in a short while.

Then, he placed the stack of papers on the desk, raised his head, and said thoughtfully,””It seems that there was nothing special about his previous life! Even his experience of serving in the lone wolf unit is not beyond the scope of ordinary people ... The only thing that can be considered a cultivator’s means is the Paradise company he set up more than three years ago, which seems a bit like a cultivator’s means ...”

The Man in Black didn’t say anything. He just stood in front of Chen Nanfeng’s desk.

He knew that Chen Nanfeng wasn’t conversing with him, but more like he was talking to himself.

This was just a habit of Chen Nanfeng’s when he was thinking.

However, Chen Nanfeng turned his gaze to the Man in Black and smiled.””Ning, tell me your thoughts.”

The Man in Black, who Chen Nanfeng called “ah ning,” had said so much just now. It was all the results of the investigation. He was only describing it objectively and did not mix in his own judgment.

Now that Chen Nanfeng wanted him to share his opinion, he pondered for a moment and said,””Sect leader, I feel that ... This Xia ruofei doesn’t seem like a hidden nascent soul cultivator’s direct disciple. His life experience is very clear and he didn’t disappear from people’s sight at any time.”

Chen Nanfeng smiled and asked,””You’re saying that he might’ve had some fortuitous encounter three years ago, and that’s why he entered the world of cultivation?”

...

“This subordinate thinks that the possibility of this is still relatively high.” The black – robed man said.

“But he’s already an Aurous core stage cultivator!” Chen Nanfeng said,”according to this judgment, he only started cultivating more than three years ago. I’m afraid that no matter how lucky he is, he wouldn’t be able to reach the Golden core stage in such a short time, right?”

The Man in Black was at a loss for words, but he still frowned and said,””Sect leader, this subordinate is slow – witted and truly can’t think of anything. Because no matter which possibility it is, there are contradictions.”

“I’m more inclined to believe that he has a very powerful teacher behind him,”Chen Nanfeng said with a smile. Although his childhood experience was very clear and he had never left the secular world, but ... Why did the so – called great hidden in the city, Yuanying stage or even stronger cultivators, have to live in the deep mountains and forests where few people tread? Perhaps Xia ruofei has been under the guidance of such a master since he was young and has become a cultivator. However, this senior did not want the people in the cultivation world to know of his existence, so no one has ever discovered him ...”

At this point, Chen Nanfeng paused for a moment and then continued,””I’d rather believe in this possibility, because it’s more reasonable than a person who has passed the best age for cultivation to use a short three years or even less to break through to the early jiedan stage!”

In fact, the second possibility that Chen Nanfeng had mentioned was closer to Xia ruofei’s actual situation.

The reason why it was said to be close and not completely in line was that Xia ruofei’s actual time in contact with cultivation was even shorter. This was because he had established the Paradise Corporation not long after he had obtained the spirit map space. At that time, he had no chance to come into contact with cultivation.

Therefore, the actual time he spent cultivating was even shorter.

If Chen Nanfeng knew the truth, he would probably be even more shocked.

After hearing Chen Nanfeng’s words, the Man in Black nodded slightly and said,””By the way, sect leader, I have another situation to report to you. It’s also related to this Xia ruofei!”
