Chapter 108: A bodyguard with a personality (1)

The man in white was called Deng Ming. He was the son of a Deputy Mayor of Sanshan city. Although Deputy Mayor Deng was not a regular person and his ranking in the government was relatively low, he was still a Big Shot in Sanshan city. Relying on his father’s connections, Childe Deng opened a consulting company in Sanshan city and became the boss behind the scenes. The so – called consulting company, to put it bluntly, was to help some people settle bidding, approval, and other things that ordinary people would find difficult to do, but he could do it easily. He made money quite quickly. Today, Deng Ming was singing in a private room with a few friends, and his evil fire was aroused by the private room Princess beside him. He was about to bring her upstairs to vent his fire, but he didn’t expect to bump into pang Hao as soon as he went out. Moreover, his expensive Zilli suit was stained with a large wine stain. It was basically useless now. How could Deng Ming not be angry? Pang Hao, who was the one who was knocked down, naturally couldn’t hold back his anger when he heard Deng Ming’s unpleasant words. He stood up and said,””How can you be so unreasonable? You were the ones who bumped into me, so how is it my fault now?” “Bullshit!” Deng Ming was furious.”Am I as blind as you? You’re such a big fat man standing here, how can I not see you crash into me?” “You ...” Pang Hao was so angry that he couldn’t speak. He had never seen such an unreasonable person before. He had clearly knocked into someone, but not only did he not apologize, he even made a false accusation against the other party. “You what? Do you know how much my suit costs?” Deng Ming looked at pang Hao contemptuously and said,”eight thousand dollars! Now that the clothes are ruined, you better compensate me!” “You’ve gone crazy thinking about money!” Pang Hao was so angry that he laughed.”You want me to compensate you? You should count yourself lucky that I didn’t ask you for compensation!” “Damn fatty, are you trying to cheat?” The flirtatious private room Princess immediately said,”why don’t you find out who young master Deng is? You want to leave without paying for dirtying his clothes?” The glass of red wine had spilled on Deng Ming’s body from her hands. If she did not catch pang Hao, Deng Ming would probably take his anger out on her later, so she spared no effort to help him. “You’re simply unreasonable!” Pang Hao said angrily. Then, he turned around and was about to leave. He didn’t want to continue pestering such rude and unreasonable people. It was better to leave immediately. He knew that these two people would never apologize even if he continued to pester them. And how could Deng Ming let pang Hao go so easily? He grabbed pang Hao’s clothes and said,””Motherf * cker! You still dare to run? If you don’t pay up today, don’t even think about going anywhere!” Even if pang Hao was a clay Bodhisattva, he would still be a little angry. He flung Deng Ming’s hand away and glared at him. “What’s wrong? He wanted to fight! Come on! Who’s afraid of who?” Although pang Hao was fat, he was tall and big. Deng Ming’s small body, which had been hollowed out by wine and women, was naturally not his opponent. Deng Ming took a step back and shouted toward the private room,””Ye linyun, are you dead? Hurry up and come out!” The door of the private room opened, and a young man in a black suit with a cold face walked out. At the same time, a few men with disheveled clothes and reeking of alcohol also came out. They were all Deng Ming’s scoundrels. The young man in the black suit had no expression on his well – defined face. He stood straight like a javelin and exuded a cold aura. He was obviously someone who had experienced life – and – Death battles and had seen blood. He walked to Deng Ming’s side and asked,”Boss, what’s your order?” Deng Ming stretched out his hand and pointed at pang Hao. He gritted his teeth and shouted,””Go! Beat him up! Beat him up so badly that even his mother won’t be able to recognize him!” Ye linyun didn’t move. He calmly said,””Boss, my duty is to protect your safety, not to act as a fighter. I can’t do anything illegal.” When Deng Ming heard this, he was even more furious. He turned his head and cursed,””Ye linyun, is your brain damaged? You’re my bodyguard, and I’m the one paying your salary! Now that I’m being bullied, what’s wrong with letting you go and teach him a lesson?” “Sorry, boss. If this person threatens your personal safety, I’ll definitely take action. ” Ye Lingyun replied neither obsequiously nor haughtily,”but you want me to beat up an ordinary person. This is an order outside the scope of the contract. I refuse to execute it.” Deng Ming squinted his eyes and looked at ye Lingyun for a few seconds. Ye Lingyun’s expression did not change. He stood upright beside him and did not avoid his murderous gaze. “I don’t want to waste my breath on you!” Deng Ming said coldly,”I’ll give you two choices. First, go and cripple that damn fatty immediately. I’ll take responsibility if anything happens. Second, get the F * ck out of my sight right now!” Ye linyun was also very straightforward. He took two steps back and said,”I can’t go against my own principles. I choose the second option.” A few of Deng Ming’s scoundrels immediately burst into laughter, and someone even whistled. “Young master Deng, your bodyguard has quite the personality!” “Haha, this kid is a bit of a Tiger! You can’t even tell who the boss is ...” “Young master Deng, I’ll introduce you to a few bodyguards later. They’ll definitely be much more obedient than this bejeweled weapon!” Deng Ming was so angry that he laughed out loud. He nodded and said,””Alright, ye Lingyun, you’re fired! You can get lost now ... Also, I’ll tell my friends that in the future, even if you can get a job as a security guard in Sanshan city, I’ll take your last name, let alone be a bodyguard!” The vengeful Deng Ming was disobeyed by his bodyguard in front of so many friends. Naturally, he hated ye Lingyun to the extreme. Ye linyun remained expressionless and said calmly,””Mr. Deng, it’s not a problem to fire me. It’s your business how you want to shut me out, but I’ve worked for you for seven days. According to the contract, my monthly salary is 20000 Yuan. You have to pay me 5000 Yuan. If you pay me, I’ll leave.” “You still dare to ask me for money?” Deng Ming was so angry that he laughed.”Are you out of your mind?” Ye Lingyun’s expression turned cold as he exuded a chilly aura. He took a step forward and stared into Deng Ming’s eyes as he spoke word by word,”Are you sure you want to renege on your debt?” Deng Ming’s heart tightened for no reason. He recalled the scene when ye Lingyun easily knocked down more than a dozen burly men when he was applying for the job. He knew that his small body was not even enough to deal with ye Lingyun’s finger. Moreover, after six or seven days of contact with ye Lingyun, Deng Ming knew that ye Lingyun was a man of few words, but he had definitely seen blood and was the kind of person who was ruthless. When such a person pushed him into a corner, he would do anything. He was a person of status, and there was no need to compete with such a Desperado. At the thought of this, Deng Ming pretended to be magnanimous and waved his hand.””Forget it, it’s just five thousand Yuan. I’ll give it to you, just treat it as a beggar ...” “Hey, you guys, stop watching. Who brought cash? give me 5000 Yuan first!” Deng Ming said to a few of his scoundrels. Although these people used their cards most of the time when they came out to play, they would more or less bring some cash with them. Very quickly, they had gathered 5000 Yuan. Deng Ming passed the five thousand Yuan to ye Lingyun and said in disgust,””I’ll give you the money, so don’t bother me anymore! Get lost ...” Ye Lingyun took the money and meticulously counted it twice. After confirming that there was no mistake, he put it in his pocket and turned to walk out of the club without any unnecessary words. At this moment, a voice rang out,””How lively! Did I miss something good?” When pang Hao heard this voice, his uneasy heart immediately settled down. Ye Lingyun, who was walking out, heard the familiar voice. He trembled and turned around. He saw a smile in Xia ruofei’s eyes as he looked back at him. Ye Lingyun’s cold face was filled with excitement. With a look of disbelief, he shouted,””Instructor Xia!”
