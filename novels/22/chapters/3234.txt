The group passed through a stone corridor and came to a room at the East End.

Elon Musk pushed the door open and entered. Xia ruofei and the rest followed closely behind.

Xia ruofei saw a young female nurse in a white coat and a middle – aged woman in her forties in the room. They looked like nannies who were in charge of taking care of the children.

She was probably one of those confinement ladies in China. However, foreigners did not pay attention to confinement, so naturally, there was no such thing as “confinement lady”.

When the young nurse saw Elon Musk and his group walk in, she quickly made a shushing gesture and said softly,””Mr. Masker, the child has just fallen asleep. Please keep quiet!”

Elon Musk looked at Xia ruofei, his eyes asking for her opinion.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,””It doesn’t matter if you’re asleep ...”

After that, he walked to the modified crib and leaned in to observe.

Little X was still a newborn, and his hair was a little sparse. The skin on his face had not become completely smooth, and there were some parts of his face that were peeling off. He did not look cute at all.

Although he was asleep, his brows were slightly furrowed, clearly not very comfortable.

On the child’s neck, there was an obvious red and swollen area, and even his face was slightly deformed.

There was a rack beside the crib, and on it was an infusion bag. Little X was still receiving an infusion, but the child’s blood vessels were too thin. Only the blood vessels in the temples were barely enough for the infusion, so the infusion needle was inserted into his forehead. It was a shocking sight.

Xia ruofei reached out and carefully avoided the needle. He gently touched little X’s forehead.

The nurse’s expression changed slightly, and she couldn’t help but call out softly,””This gentleman ...”

“Stop!” Elon Mask waved his hand to stop the nurse.

The nurse stopped in her tracks, but her face still had a trace of displeasure.

Xia ruofei’s hand moved away from the baby’s forehead. Other than Li Yifu, no one else could tell that Xia ruofei had actually used a small wisp of spiritual power to put the baby into a deeper sleep.

In fact, the child’s brows had already slowly relaxed after the spiritual power took effect. This was because he could not feel any pain in his body in deep sleep.

Xia ruofei reached out and gently opened the child’s eyelids to take a look. Then, he gently pried open the child’s mouth to observe the tongue. Finally, he pulled a stool over and sat by the crib. He placed his fingers on the child’s wrist and took his pulse.

A child’s pulse was much weaker than an adult ‘s. Without a certain level of martial arts, it was not easy to check the pulse. However, this was not a problem for Xia ruofei.

After a while, Xia ruofei stood up.

When he was taking the pulse, he had also used his mental power to do a thorough examination of the child, so he already had an idea of what was going on.

He nodded lightly at elonmask and took the lead to walk out of the room.

Elon Musk and the others quickly followed, leaving the young female nurse and the nanny looking at each other in confusion.

They didn’t know what the Asian that their boss had brought in was doing. He didn’t say anything when he came in. He rolled his eyes and pinched the child’s mouth. In the end, he even touched his wrist and closed his eyes in deep thought. After a series of operations, he got up and left without saying anything.

The nurse thought for a moment, then walked to the corner of the room, took out her phone, and called the personal doctor of Elon Musk, Mannu, and reported the situation to him.

Mannu and his medical team lived in this mansion, including this nurse. Strictly speaking, they were all members of Mannu’s medical team, so to be precise, Mannu was her boss.

She had to be responsible for her direct boss.

In fact, providing medical services in this mansion was also a temporary measure. Once the treatment plan was determined, they would definitely have to go to a professional medical institution for surgery and follow – up treatment.

It was just that the rich could choose the best private medical institutions and receive better treatment than public hospitals.

After leaving the room, Elon Musk led Xia ruofei to the room next door and asked impatiently,””Doctor Xia, how’s the situation?”

Xia ruofei pondered for a moment and said,”it’s indeed a Strigoi.” The primary lesion should be in the neck, but the course of the disease is progressing very quickly. It has begun to spread to the brain, and there are already tumor cells in the eye sockets. In addition, there are early lymph node metastasis and blood transmission, and there are also signs of infection in the lungs. ”

Elon Musk and grumus looked at each other and were shocked. Xia ruofei’s judgment was almost exactly the same as the medical team’s examination results yesterday. That was the examination result of Dr. Mannu and the rest using a lot of top medical equipment! Xia ruofei only needed to look at her eyes, tongue, and pulse to make such an accurate judgment. It was simply unbelievable.

The reason why it was said to be “almost” exactly the same was that the medical team did not find any transfer of the eye socket during the examination.

However, Elon Musk and gramus already had complete trust in Xia ruofei’s medical skills. At least, the examination method had convinced them. So, they would rather believe that the medical team’s examination was not thorough enough and not that Xia ruofei’s judgment was wrong.

Elonmask was somewhat dumbfounded and could not help but ask,””Dr ... Dr. Xia, How did you come up with such a detailed conclusion?”

In the field of Western medicine, Xia ruofei’s method of examination was the simplest physical examination. It could only make a basic judgment and could not be so accurate. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Elon Musk had seen Xia ruofei’s simple inspection technique with his own eyes. He even had an illusion that if he learned a few moves, he would be as good as Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei hesitated for a moment and said slowly,””After the preliminary examination, the child’s tongue is light, fat, white, and slightly greasy, and her pulse is deep and smooth. According to the symptoms of the disease and the child’s physique, it can be judged that the phlegm and heat are combined, and the blockage will transform into heat, so the affected area will be in pain and red. The child’s vital energy has been damaged, so he can’t fight against the disease ...”

It was indeed difficult to express Chinese Medicine’s dialectical theory in English. Xia ruofei had to rack his brains before he could barely translate it, and some words did not even reach the meaning.

As for elonmask and gramus, they were even more confused. They had no idea what Xia ruofei was talking about, but it sounded magical ...

“Mr. Masker, doctor Xia’s medical skills are second to none in China,” said Li Yifu with a smile. A friendly reminder, not all Chinese medicine doctors can make such an accurate judgment in a short time. Also, Chinese medicine generally focuses on treating both the root and the root of the problem. The treatment process is often longer than Western medicine, and the effect is not as fast. So, you must not blindly believe in Chinese medicine. ”

Li Yifu also reminded him out of good intentions, in case Elon Musk became a fanatic fan of Chinese medicine in the future and wanted to invite Chinese medicine doctors to take a look at any illness. If there was a serious illness, it would be easy to be delayed, and the probability of encountering scammers was not low.

Li Yifu continued,”of course, Dr. Xia’s traditional Chinese medicine treatment is different from other people ‘s. Generally speaking, the effect is very fast, even faster than Western medicine treatment. It also has an advantage that Western medicine can’t compare with. That is, most situations don’t require surgery treatment, so it won’t hurt the patient’s vitality.”

Elon Musk nodded and said,””Thank you for your reminder and explanation, Mr. Li! Thank you!”

Li Yifu smiled and nodded.

Elon Musk immediately looked at Xia ruofei and asked eagerly,””Doctor Xia, you’ve already understood little X’s condition. Can we use Chinese medicine to treat him?”

Xia ruofei smiled and looked at the eager gazes of elonmask and gramus. He nodded with certainty and said,””I’ve treated a malignant tumor that’s much more serious than this. The patient has now fully recovered. Although little X’s condition is a little serious, because it was discovered in time, it’s not a big problem to completely cure him.”
