Chapter 768: Xiao hei’s Meritorious Service (3)

They didn’t even use their flashlights. They just stuck a small fluorescent sticker on Xia ruofei’s back and pushed forward one by one.

Xia ruofei’s eyesight was very good, and he quickly adapted to the sewer environment, so he could easily keep up with Blackie without the need for light. This made Guo Zhan and Tian Feilong secretly amazed. They felt that Xia ruofei’s abilities in all aspects seemed to have become stronger after he left the Army.

Blackie walked and stopped. When it was uncertain, it would return for a while to the fork to determine the direction again.

The three of them made many turns in the sewer and advanced for about seven to eight hundred meters.

The Special Forces were usually very sensitive to directions. Although they had turned around a few times in the dark, they could still roughly tell that they were about 500 meters Southwest of the laboratory building.

Finally, Blackie came to a stop and whimpered a few times at Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei could see at a glance that there was a vertical passage at the spot where Blackie had stopped. There was a ladder on the inner wall. It was obviously a sewer.

“Blackie, you mean ... Those people went up from this well?” Xia ruofei asked softly.

Blackie immediately nodded.

Guo Zhan and Tian Feilong quickly caught up. Now that they had basically confirmed that the group of people were not hiding in the sewer, Tian Feilong immediately turned on his flashlight and checked the area near the exit.

Soon, Tian Feilong called out,”Captain, squad leader Xia, little Black’s judgment should be correct. There are footsteps on the inner wall here. Moreover, it should have been left here recently.”

Xia ruofei also went over to take a look. He nodded and said,””If I’m not wrong, it should be professor Liang who intentionally left it behind.”

Guo Zhan and Tian Feilong nodded in agreement at the same time. They must be the top special Forces in their country to be able to sneak into Huaxia and kidnap Liang Qiming under lone Wolf’s nose. They couldn’t have left such obvious marks on the inner wall just by climbing up the ladder.

......

The only possibility was that professor Liang Qiming took advantage of the dark environment and pretended to miss his step when they weren’t paying attention, leaving this half footprint on the inner wall.

“Let’s go up!” Guo Zhan said.

Then, he took the lead and stepped onto the ladder. He didn’t need Blackie to lead the way now, and he didn’t know if there were unknown dangers outside, so he took the lead. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei didn’t fight with him and waited at the bottom of the well with Tian Feilong.

After Guo Zhan climbed up, he pushed the manhole cover open with force and carefully observed it. Then, he pushed the manhole cover open and quickly climbed up.

After a while, Guo Zhan poked his head in and made a gesture to Xia ruofei and Tian Feilong, indicating that it was safe.

Xia ruofei immediately carried Blackie up the ladder, and Tian Feilong followed closely behind.

Soon, the three of them were on the ground. Xia ruofei quickly observed the surrounding environment.

The sewer was located on a quiet path by the forest, far from the teaching buildings and laboratories. There were not many people who passed by this place.

Xia ruofei patted Blackie’s head and asked,””Xiao hei, can you still track that smell?”

Blackie sniffed carefully, barked at Xia ruofei, and continued to run into the woods.

There’s hope! Xia ruofei’s eyes brightened. He, Guo Zhan, and Tian Feilong quickly followed.

The forest was not big, so Blackie passed through it quickly. As soon as Xia ruofei and the other two came out, they saw a building in front of them.

“Canteen?” Tian Feilong couldn’t help but Mutter to himself.

It turned out that after coming up from the sewer and passing through the small forest, one would arrive at the second cafeteria of the old campus of Sanshan University.

Blackie’s tracking stopped at an open space on the side of the second canteen, and then it completely lost its scent. No matter how hard it tried, it couldn’t find the direction.

Was the lead broken again? Xia ruofei furrowed his brows in deep thought.

Suddenly, Xia ruofei’s eyes brightened and he shouted,””I know! I know how these people escaped! Hahaha! Little black, you’ve done a great job!”
