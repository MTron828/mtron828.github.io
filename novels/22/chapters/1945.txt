“The treatment is indeed different!” Shi Qingyuan thought to himself, let’s get straight to the point. It seems like there’s a high chance of winning this project!

Wu Liqian opened the folder and said,””President Xia, after our Standing committee’s discussion, if the Paradise Corporation chooses to invest in Changping, we will provide preferential policies in land acquisition, tax collection, and many other aspects. As far as I know, these preferential policies are already quite large, and are rarely seen in recent investment projects!”

After that, Wu Liqian turned her eyes to the folder in front of her and said,””To be specific, it’s like this! “Regarding land acquisition, we can fully cooperate with the Paradise Corporation. We will be in charge of coordination regarding the collective land. The entire land will be transferred to the Paradise Corporation as industrial land, and the transfer fee will be 30% off this year’s base price. In terms of tax, the first three years of enterprise income tax and value added tax were exempted, and the second two years 60%; As for the basic facilities and supporting construction, including the construction of power supply lines, road construction, water supply network, etc., The cost will be borne by the Changping County government. Of course, this part of the cost will need to be funded by your company and then deducted from the land transfer fee!”

Wu Liqian briefly explained the preferential measures that the Standing Committee had decided on the last time. Then, she looked up at Xia ruofei and said,””President Xia, our Changping County is very sincere! These preferential measures are basically the highest authority of the county level. As for the basic facilities and land transfer fees, we still need to ask the higher – ups, but this shouldn’t be a big problem. ”

Xia ruofei tapped his fingers on the table and said noncommittally,””County Head Wu, our company has been inspecting several nearby districts and counties during this period of time. Everyone can see that the Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory project is a super high – Quality project. It will have a very obvious pulling effect on the local economy, so the districts and counties we inspected are all welcoming this project with both hands. In terms of preferential policies, the plan provided by Changping County doesn’t have much competition!”

Hearing this, Shi Qingyuan could not help but look at Xia ruofei deeply.

He had thought that the negotiation would go smoothly with Wu Liqian’s help. At the beginning, Xia ruofei had given off the same feeling. He had personally come downstairs to welcome them with a kind attitude. However, when they got to the main point, Xia ruofei did not speak so easily.

Business was business, and no one could find fault with Xia ruofei’s actions.

Wu Liqian’s expression didn’t change. She smiled and said,””Director Xia, what about the preferential policies that the other districts have given?”

Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”I don’t think it’s convenient to disclose this.” This is also considered a trade secret. If I say it directly, won’t the leaders of the other districts and counties blame me?”

Feng Rao, Xue Jinshan, and the others could not help but laugh in their hearts.

In fact, the offers given by everyone were more or less the same. Most of the places they inspected were the districts in the outskirts of the three mountains. These places had the same authority as Changping County. If Changping County couldn’t give them any offers, these places couldn’t make their own decisions.

However, Xia ruofei’s current situation was just right. Furthermore, it was the Chang Ping County that needed the peach blossom company’s help. Even if Chang Ping County asked other districts about the specific preferential measures, let’s not talk about whether these competing districts and counties would be willing to tell them. Even if they took ten thousand steps back and asked, what could they do even if they found out? All of these were just verbal promises, and they had not been carried out on paper.

However, it was very useful as a negotiation strategy.

Wu Liqian smiled and said,”director Xia, we very much welcome peach blossom company’s investment in Changping. We’re also very sincere about the relevant preferential policies. It’s basically the biggest discount we can offer within our authority.” “Of course, for a high – Quality company like paradise Corporation, we can still give more support, but we need to ask the higher – ups for instructions ...”

“No problem,” Xia ruofei nodded,”we’re very patient. I hope that this investment is a win – win cooperation, and this cooperation plan has to satisfy both of us!”

“Alright!” Wu Liqian nodded. President Xia, let’s stop here for today. I still need to report to County Head Zhu and Secretary Zeng. There are some questions that I need to ask the city. ”

“County Head Wu, stay for lunch!” He said. Xia ruofei immediately replied,”I’ve already made a reservation. The ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ from Ling Ji’s private kitchen is still very special!”

Wu Liqian immediately recalled the scene where Xia ruofei treated her to Ling Ji’s private restaurant ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ and her heart warmed.

She smiled and said,”let’s wait until we reach an agreement next time!” I still have to report to my leader today, so I won’t bother you anymore, President Xia!”

Shi Qingyuan and the others could not help but shout in their hearts,”It wouldn’t be too late to go back after eating! What did it matter if he reported a few hours earlier or later? Ling Ji’s private kitchen ‘s’ Buddha Jumps Over the Wall ‘was something that one couldn’t get to eat normally even if they had money!

Of course, no one would be willing to spend half a month’s salary on a ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ with the normal income of the system.

However, Wu Liqian, the leader, had already stood up. Even if Shi Qingyuan and the others were reluctant to leave, they had to stand up as well.Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎
