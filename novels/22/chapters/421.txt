Chapter 422: Chapter 372 – letting go of past enmity (2)

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,””Forget it, it’s fine. Remember not to drink so much next time ...” He said. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Oh ... I know.” Lu You said. Then, she immediately thought of the clothes and asked,”then, my clothes ...”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but sigh. This girl was really stubborn ...

“Your clothes are covered in what you vomited,” he said helplessly.”You can’t wear them anymore. There’s no one else in my villa at night, so ...”

Lu You looked at Xia ruofei and asked,”you ... You helped me change?”

Xia ruofei nodded silently and immediately explained,””But I was helping you change behind you, I really didn’t mess around ...”

“Don’t say anymore ...” Lu You’s ears turned red. She said hurriedly,”go and help me make some hangover soup!”

“Oh!” Xia ruofei immediately opened the door and left the room as if he was escaping.

Lu You was wearing Xia ruofei’s thermal underwear as she sat on the bed. Her face felt hot. She lifted the blanket and realized that she was still wearing the pair of jeans. Luckily, he only changed his clothes and not his pants ...

When she thought of this, Lu You could not help but cover her face again. It was already too much for her to change her clothes. She could clearly feel that she was empty inside. This meant that Xia ruofei had even taken off her bra ...

That guy said he didn’t look around, who knows ... Lu You thought shyly.

At this moment, she looked up and saw her clothes hanging on the balcony.

So, he had already washed my clothes last night ... Lu You couldn’t help but feel warm in her heart.

Then, she saw the black lace bra hanging on the hanger. She couldn’t help but imagine Xia ruofei sitting behind her last night and taking off her clothes one by one. In the end, she even took off her bra. She couldn’t help but blush.

This time, I really don’t have the face to see anyone ... Lu You wailed in her heart.

After a while, there was a soft knock on the door, followed by Xia ruofei’s voice.””Lu You, can I come in?”

Lu You subconsciously clutched the blanket tightly before saying,””Come in!”

Xia ruofei pushed open the door and entered the room with a bowl of hot sour and spicy soup. He did not know how effective this soup was, so he had added some spirit Heart Flower petal solution in it.

Lu You heard Xia ruofei’s footsteps and quickly lowered her head, not daring to look at Xia ruofei.

“Drink it while it’s hot!” Xia ruofei said gently,”it should help relieve your headache.”

Lu You nodded and said in a mosquito – like voice,””Thank you ...”

Then, she reached out and took the bowl from Xia ruofei’s hands. Throughout the entire process, she did not dare to look at Xia ruofei, and her face was red and hot.

It was also Xia ruofei’s first time seeing Lu You acting like a little wife. He couldn’t help but find it funny. However, he naturally knew why Lu You was so embarrassed, so he didn’t want to provoke her and deliberately bring up the topic of changing clothes.

After Lu You vomited last night, her stomach was empty. When she smelled the sour and spicy soup, her appetite was aroused. Very quickly, she finished the entire bowl of soup in big gulps.

Not long after she finished the soup, she felt her headache getting better. She looked up at Xia ruofei and said gratefully,””Thank you ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and sat down on a stool by the bed. He asked,””How do you feel now?”

“Much better ...” Lu You lowered her head and said softly,”Xia ruofei, thank you.”

“You’ve already said thank you. ” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it’s just a bowl of hangover soup. It’s not that big of a deal.”

“I’m not talking about The Hangover soup. ” Lu You raised her head and looked at Xia ruofei. She said seriously,”I’m saying that I’m really grateful for what happened last night ...”

Xia ruofei nodded silently. After a while, he said,””Don’t do this again. That kind of bar is full of people from all walks of life. It’s not suitable for a girl like you. ”

“I know ...” Lu You said softly.”I wasn’t in a good mood yesterday, so I didn’t think too much ...”

Actually, Xia ruofei had already guessed the reason why Lu You went to drink, so he did not continue the conversation. He only said indifferently,””Well, a fall into a pit, a gain in your wit. Just pay more attention next time.”

Xia ruofei stood up and picked up the empty bowl on the bedside table.””You can sleep for a while longer. I’ll go downstairs and cook you some porridge. You were very drunk last night, so it’s better for your stomach to eat something light in the morning.”

With that, Xia ruofei walked out of the door.

Lu You’s white teeth bit her cherry lips lightly. She raised her head and called out,””Xia ruofei, wait a moment.”

Xia ruofei stopped in his tracks, turned around and asked with a smile,””What’s wrong? Is there anything else?”

Lu You blushed and hesitated for a while before saying,””I want to explain what happened yesterday ... I ... I know you’re close to the song family, and I heard from my mother that you cured elder song’s terminal illness. You’re also good friends with song Rui, so ... I thought that asking you to help would make song Rui give up on the marriage. I really didn’t think that much, and I didn’t mean to use you ...”

With Lu You’s Princess – like temper, even if she was wronged, she would not explain anything to Xia ruofei. Yesterday afternoon, she sat by the river in a daze and did not take the initiative to look for Xia ruofei. However, after the bar incident, her attitude seemed to have changed a lot.
