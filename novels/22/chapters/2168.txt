2169 Leaving without saying goodbye (1)

“Okay, great immortal ...” Puyol said, then asked nervously,”you ... Didn’t you say there was a satellite phone?”

Xia ruofei said nonchalantly,”there’s a problem with the satellite phone’s solar battery. I didn’t charge it today. I’ll try again tomorrow after the sun comes out.” Tonight, we’ll use this distress flare first. Maybe ships passing by in the nearby waters will see it ...”

“Okay, okay, I understand ...” Puyol said hurriedly.

“Alright, go and see John Junior!” Xia ruofei said,”everyone should take the time to rest tonight. Just arrange for one person to take turns to stand guard.”

“Yes!” Puyol said.

He quickly arranged for everyone to take turns to be on duty. Even if he and the three survivors were to take three hours each, he would not dare to arrange Xia ruofei to be on duty.

After the arrangements were made, Puyol said,””Daoist immortal, please rest in the tent! We will be on duty tonight ...”

Xia ruofei shook his head and said,”John Junior is a little shy. You can sleep in the tent with him.” I don’t need ...”

After he finished speaking, he walked directly to the front of the raft and sat down casually.

Seeing this, Puyol didn’t dare to persuade them. He sent the signal flare to each of the three survivors and asked them to fire a flare signal for each shift when they were on night shift.

Then he put the remaining two into the tent and went in himself.

As the leader of the survivors, Puyol naturally had some special treatment. He arranged for himself to be in the last class, so he could still have a good sleep when he lay down.

In the same way, the first class had a good night’s sleep, which was why Dave was the weakest one in the class.

The remaining two survivors also found a relatively dry place at the end of the raft to lie down and rest.

The raft was five to six meters wide, so it was relatively loose for the few of them.

Dave sat in the middle of the raft and started the first shift.

In fact, the main reason for arranging for people to be on duty was to be afraid of extreme bad weather or sharks. If everyone fell asleep, they were likely to die in their daze. Although it was difficult to escape in the vast sea, at least having someone on duty would allow them to detect danger immediately. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Xia ruofei saw that David was the first to pull out the distress signal. Three red flares whistled into the sky and brightened the night sky.

There was nothing to hide on the ocean, and such flares could be seen from far away. They were basically distress signals. If ships saw them, they would definitely come over to check.

After the signal flare was fired, the flames were still spewing white sparks. If it were during the day, a large amount of orange – Red smoke could be seen. If a helicopter came over to check, it would be able to find the target immediately.

In fact, this kind of fireworks for help was similar to the fireworks during the spring Festival, but it was better – made and of better quality. It also took a longer time to set off than the average fireworks, especially the smoke, which could last for a long time.

Xia ruofei lay down at the front of the raft with the backpack on his head. He looked at the stars in the sky and felt the rhythm of the raft swaying with the waves. Slowly, he fell asleep.

That night, everyone on duty would fire a distress flare, so it would ring every three to four hours. Xia ruofei did not sleep well.

After Puyol took over and set off the fireworks for help, Xia ruofei saw that the sky was about to brighten and sat up.

He sat on the simple deck and muttered to himself. He had been firing flares for help the entire night, but no ship had appeared.

It was true that this place was close to the traditional sea route, but the sea was too wide. Ships that traveled by sea all year round might not be able to see other ships on the sea every day. It was normal for no ships to pass by this area for several days.

If no ship found him, he could only use the satellite phone to ask for help.

Although he still had a lot of these flames in his boundless space, he couldn’t always take them out from his backpack! The backpack was huge, but it couldn’t possibly have an infinite capacity!

Xia ruofei decided to observe the situation for another day. If there was no other way, he would use the satellite to get online for help.

At this moment, Xia ruofei seemed to hear a “tu tu tu” sound from afar.

The sound was very weak, and there was also the sound of waves nearby, so it was a little vague and not very clear.

He turned his head and saw that the three survivors were all sleeping. Puyol was sitting next to the tent doing nothing. Obviously, they did not hear the sound.

Xia ruofei also quickly realized that his hearing was much better than ordinary people – s. Now that the sounds he heard were faint – Puyol and the others must not have heard anything.

Xia ruofei listened carefully and realized that the sound was coming from the southeast. It seemed to be getting closer.

He listened carefully for a while.

It was the sound of a helicopter engine!

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but stand up and shout,””Puyol! Hurry up! Signal flare! Immediately release another one!”

“What?” Puyol was confused.”Lord deity, I just finished playing for a while!”
