In a short while, Xia ruofei had completed the task and translated pabulo’s posts.

Then, Xia ruofei stopped and turned to ask,””Do you guys think ... I should use my own Weibo account to post it, or find someone else to post it?”

Song Wei pondered for a while and said,”with your current attention and traffic, the effect will be most obvious if you use your own account!” However, this means that you’ll have to personally deal with Pablo. So ... I suggest that you don’t use your own account! Your account should remain silent at this time. ”

“I think the same!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”if that’s the case ... Then I’ll use my alternate account to post it on Weibo and Tieba!”

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue nodded at the same time.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and opened a Word document. He personally wrote a script, compressed it together with the processed pictures, and sent it to Qin Yanan, who was staying at San Shan.

Then, he called Qin Yanan and briefly explained the situation to her. He told her to post it on Weibo, in the headlines, and in various forums. If it didn’t become a hot topic of public opinion, he also authorized Qin Yanan to hire an appropriate “Internet Water Army” to create momentum.

Qin Yanan, he Yu, and the others were not with Xia ruofei during this period of time, so there were very few tasks. Now that Xia ruofei personally assigned tasks, she was naturally very happy to accept them.

Xia ruofei did not need to worry about the rest. Qin Yanan had brought a team of people to serve him, so he could handle it.

After the call, Xia ruofei smiled and said,””Wei Wei really does have the feeling of a son and daughter! In the midst of stratagems, victory will be decided from a thousand li away!”

Ling Qingxue also smiled and said,”I usually think that I’m quite smart!” But I can’t catch up to Wei Wei in this kind of scheming!”

“What’s the meaning of you two singing the same tune?”Song Wei asked. You’re saying that I’m good at scheming!”

Ling Qingxue wasn’t an idiot, either. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have taken up such an important position in the lingji F & B group and prepared to take over Ling Xiaotian’s position. However, she and Song Wei grew up in different environments. Song Wei grew up in a family of government officials, so she was naturally more aware of these things than Ling Qingxue. Her thoughts were also clearer.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”we’re complimenting you!” I think it would be perfect if Weiwei could be my Assistant to the Chairman after graduation! I don’t have to worry about anything in the future!”

“Don’t even think about it!” Song Wei replied,”I study archeology. Why would I be the Chairman’s assistant?”

“Wei Wei! Wasn’t it normal to not be in the same field? You’re a girl, and you’re going to be digging in the wilderness all day long?” Ling Qingxue smiled and said,”even if you’re willing, RUO Fei can’t agree to it, right?”

“I’m fine!” Xia ruofei shrugged his shoulders and said,”as long as Weiwei likes it, she can work in archeology in the future. It’s fine! Although this profession is very tough and physically exhausting, Wei Wei is a cultivator. Her body is stronger than most boys, so she’ll definitely be fine!” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“That’s true ...” Ling Qingxue said.

The three of them did not have much to do in the afternoon, so they stayed in Xia ruofei’s room and chatted while making tea.

Meanwhile, in China, Qin Yanan and her team had already started to move.

They first bought a new SIM card, then registered a few Weibo accounts, headline accounts, as well as forum accounts such as Tianya and Mao PU. Then, they began to post.

Xia ruofei had finished writing the proposal and the pictures were processed. They just needed to use the ready – made ones, so the posting work was not complicated. Basically, it was just a copy and paste.

Soon, the Chinese fans found that related posts had appeared on all major platforms. Everyone knew that there was a daily sports newspaper in Barcelona. There was a reporter named Pablo who was full of hostility against the Spanish team. He also disdained Xia ruofei and Wu Lei’s wonderful performances and even made a lot of remarks that distorted black and white.

How could this be?

The netizens expressed their strong dissatisfaction.

Bar?a had a huge fan base in China. However, in this incident, many of them were on Xia ruofei’s side.

In the words of a bar?a fan, it was: I’m a Chinese fan first, then a bar?a fan. I will not allow anyone to slander our Chinese players, not even bar?a, let alone a small reporter in a newspaper that is close to bar?a.

At first, everyone only left excited messages on Weibo, Tieba, and forums, but soon, some netizens began to climb over the wall and leave stern reprimands on Pablo’s Facebook.

This was just the spontaneous action of the netizens. Soon, the Spanish and Xia ruofei’s Tieba forums began to call for the netizens to go to Facebook.

You don’t understand Spanish? It didn’t matter. Translation software was very convenient to use now.

She didn’t know how to write a proposal and didn’t know how to express her resentment? It didn’t matter. There were already articles written by the netizens on the Tieba, and they had been translated into Spanish, so they could just copy and paste it.

There were even netizens who came up with a guide to guide everyone step by step into the outer net, register an account, and leave a message ...

There were also netizens who created all kinds of emojis, and naturally, there were all kinds of Spanish words in the script, which were available to the forum users.

Although these Tieba forums were not as influential as Emperor bar, there were still many Chinese fans. Many non – fans were mainly Xia ruofei’s fans and were usually very active in Xia ruofei’s Tieba. Everyone responded and left comments on Pablo’s Facebook.

……

In Barcelona, Spain, The Sports Daily newspaper.

Pablo was in a very good mood. He returned to his desk with a cup of freshly brewed coffee and leaned back comfortably in his computer chair. After taking a sip of coffee, he grabbed the mouse and got ready to start working.

Before he started writing, he opened his own Facebook page out of habit to see if there were any new comments.

After he returned from the press conference yesterday, he wrote the press release for the newspaper overnight and posted several posts on his Facebook.

The reason why he was in such a good mood today was that a few Spanish fans left comments on his Facebook page, calling him shameless and saying that he was twisting the truth. Without waiting for him to make a move, a large number of bar?a fans in the comment area retorted immediately. These Spanish fans were alone and could not win against so many bar?a fans.

Seeing the fans of both sides start a war of words on their faces, Pablo’s heart was filled with joy!

After he became the chief editor of the program, his development had been lukewarm. His influence on social media was also far from that of those famous reporters.

However, after the few posts were posted yesterday, the number of his fans immediately rose, and many bar?a fans left him messages to express their gratitude. There was even a bar?a first team player who gave him a like.

Pablo could clearly feel that his influence had increased a lot, and he had gained a great deal of affection from the bar?a fans.

The number of fans he gained today was more than what he had gained in the past month.

Pablo couldn’t help but secretly sigh,”as expected, I still have to” freeload “!”

After opening his own Facebook page, Pablo first looked at the latest post. He mainly paid attention to the comments section, wanting to see if there were any new comments. At the same time, he decided to pick out a few to personally reply to.

I’m sure those bar?a fans will be very excited to see my personal reply! Pablo’s mind was running wild.

Pablo’s eyes widened as he scanned through the comments section. His mouth was so wide that a duck’s egg could be stuffed in.

He stared at the number of readers and comments on the page with a look of disbelief ...
