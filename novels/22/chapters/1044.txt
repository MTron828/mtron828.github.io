Chapter 1045: Chapter 665 – hands – off shopkeeper, who’s the best?(2)

Translator: 549690339

Naturally, Xia ruofei would not reject such a small request. Besides, the abalones would be auctioned tomorrow.

He opened the thermal box with a smile.

Although they had seen photos and videos of these high – Quality one – headed abalones, they still couldn’t help but gasp when they saw 20 to 30 huge abalones stacked on the coffee table.

It was also Feng Rao’s first time seeing the top – grade one – headed abalone, so she was just as shocked as MA Xiong and his son.

MA Xiong’s hands were trembling as he mumbled,”One – headed abalone ... Top – Quality one – headed abalones ... I never dreamed that I would see so many top – Quality one – headed abalones one day ...”

As a native of Hong Kong, MA Xiong’s love for seafood was ingrained in his bones. Even though he was already a billionaire, he couldn’t help but lose his composure when he saw so many one – headed abalones that he couldn’t even buy with money before.

Xia ruofei smiled and accurately picked out a few Pixiu from the pile of abalones. In fact, the abalones were labeled on the outer packaging and their weight was also accurately measured. With Xia ruofei’s memory, he could naturally distinguish them with a glance.

The abalones that Xia ruofei had picked out were all slightly lighter. Strictly speaking, they were not even the standard of a one – Head abalone. The other three were the heaviest and would be the final items of the auction.

Putting the abalones aside, Xia ruofei laughed and said,””Mr. MA, according to our previous agreement, you can choose two one – headed abalones from here.”

In addition to the three heaviest ones and the two that Tang He had bought in advance, there were a total of 20 top – Quality one – Head abalones.

Ma Zhiming didn’t know that his father had such an agreement with Xia ruofei. He couldn’t help but look surprised when he heard this. Feng Jing’s mouth moved slightly. She felt a little distressed, but Xia ruofei had already made his decision. She knew her limits, so she didn’t say anything.

“Alright, alright ...” MA Xiong nodded excitedly.

He came to the 20 one – headed abalones, picked one up, looked at it for a while, then put it down and picked up another one.

The abalones that grew up in the spirit map space were of very high quality, and MA Xiong liked every one he saw.

This super – rich man, who was decisive in the business world, began to hesitate in the face of twenty abalones.

But in the end, he still chose two abalones to hold in his hands. Then, he looked at the remaining 18 with some reluctance and said,””Xia Sheng, just these two!”

“No problem!” Xia ruofei said with a smile. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

He could clearly see that MA Xiong didn’t pick the two heaviest one – headed abalones among the 20 one – headed abalones. Instead, he chose the two that were of medium weight.

The old man was quite kind. He didn’t take more abalones just because Xia ruofei asked him to. He knew that these abalones were going to be auctioned tomorrow. Xia ruofei was already kind enough to let him choose two before the auction.

Xia ruofei gathered the rest of the abalones together and placed them in a thermal container. He then walked to the huge double – door refrigerator and arranged them one by one.

On the other side, MA Xiong was holding two one – headed abalones fondly and said with a smile,”Xia Sheng, I don’t know what the price will be at tomorrow’s auction. I think ... Why don’t we wait until the auction is over and I’ll pay you according to the average price of the auction?”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”no need, no need. Old Mr. MA, just give it to me as you see fit.” With our friendship, how can I sell it to you at the auction price?”

“That’s embarrassing. “MA Xiong chuckled. You’re already giving me face by letting me choose the abalones first. How can I let you lose more money?”

Ma Zhiming also chimed in,”that’s right, Xia Sheng!” My daddy is right, let’s settle the price according to the average auction price! We can’t let you suffer any losses ...”

“Are you two looking down on me?” Xia ruofei said angrily. Old Mr. MA, if I only want to make money, wouldn’t it be better if I put all the abalones on auction? I believe that with your wealth, it’s impossible that you can’t even bid for two abalones, right?”

MA Xiong was stunned for a moment, then he smiled and said,”Xia Sheng, you’re treating us like outsiders ... Alright! We’ll do as you say!”

He pondered for a moment and said,””Then ... I think four million for an abalone should be a reasonable price ...”

Ma Zhiming didn’t even blink when he heard the price. To him, this amount of money was indeed not even a drop in the ocean. It was hard to buy a good heart with money! Her father loved abalones so much that it was worth it to spend eight million on two one – headed abalones.

On the other hand, Feng Rao sucked in a deep breath of cold air after hearing MA Xiong’s bid. She felt that it was too easy to earn money. One abalone was already four million ...

Although one – headed abalones were rare, rich people were not stupid. The auction price was not sky – High, so they could still estimate the price. Although MA Xiong owed Xia ruofei a favor, the price he said was basically the auction price he had predicted.

In the end, he still did not want to treat Xia ruofei unfairly in terms of money.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”old Mr. MA, I’ll be honest with you.” Grandpa Tang United States from shengbang also bought two one – headed abalones from me. They weighed about the same as the two you chose, and I charged him six million Yuan. So ... You can’t exceed this standard at most. I can’t favor one over the other!”
