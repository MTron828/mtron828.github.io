Chapter 889: A small harvest of wormgrass (2)

Translator: 549690339

He Feng and Guangzhi both had chauffeurs, and they also enthusiastically offered to send Xia ruoxin back to the farm. Ran ran had drunk so much in the afternoon that she definitely couldn’t drive.

However, Xia ruofei did not want to leave his car in the club as he had to go to song Qiming’s house to treat Song Wei the next morning. Hence, he politely declined their offer.

Xia ruofei asked President Zheng to prepare a guest room for him in the club. After sending he Feng and Cao Guangzhi off, he went back to the guest room to rest.

In fact, with Xia ruofei’s current alcohol tolerance, it was not a problem for him to drink so little and drive in the afternoon. However, he did not want to cause trouble for no reason. After all, if he was caught in a drunk-driving inspection, the alcohol content in his breath would definitely exceed the limit.

However, his physique was far better than the average person’s, so this little amount of alcohol couldn’t affect his mind at all.

President Zheng had even asked the servants to prepare some tea for him to sober up. Xia ruofei went back to his room and drank the tea before going to the bathroom to take a shower.

Now, Sanshan city had become a new furnace city. Furthermore, the weather in Sanshan was humid and hot, different from the dry and hot weather in the North. One would definitely be covered in sweat if they moved a little.

It was normal to shower three or four times a day in the summer.

The room was using central air conditioning and was always maintained at a constant temperature of 24 degrees. After Xia ruofei took a shower, he lay down and soon fell asleep.

Xia ruofei woke up at about five o’ clock in the afternoon. President Zheng warmly invited Xia ruofei to have dinner and wait for the weather to cool down before going back. However, Xia ruofei still politely declined. After saying goodbye to President Zheng, he went out to drive the Knight XV and left the clubhouse.

This was because when Xia ruofei woke up, Xia Qing, who was in the spirit map space, told him through spiritual will that the Cordyceps in the Archean realm had already grown purplish-red grass heads.

Hence, Xia ruofei was also anxious to return home. How could he be in the mood to stay for dinner?

Xia ruofei drove at the speed limit and reached the farm in half an hour.

After parking the car in the courtyard, Xia ruofei was not in the mood to play with lightning and Blackie. He quickly walked into the house.

Hu’ Zi’s mother, who was preparing dinner, heard the noise and peeked out from the open kitchen. Seeing that Xia ruofei had returned, she quickly asked, ” “RUO Fei is back? How’s the matter of Nan Nan’s admission? ”

Xia ruofei walked up the stairs with his eyes wide open as he said, ” “The procedures are all done! You can just report to school on the first day!”

Hu Zi’s mother shouted again,” ruofei!” Dinner will be ready in ten minutes, remember to come down for dinner!”

“I know, godmother!”

When Xia ruofei said this, he was already upstairs. Hu Zi’s mother couldn’t help but shake her head and smile. ” “This child! You’re usually quite steady, why are you so energetic today ...”

After Xia ruofei returned to his room, he immediately locked the doors and windows, pulled up the curtains, and then summoned the spirit map scroll from his palm. With a thought, he entered the medium.

“Master!” Xia Qing was waiting in the Archean realm. When she saw Xia ruofei, she hurriedly and respectfully asked.

“How are the wormgrass? “Xia ruofei nodded.

“The quality should be very high!” Xia Qing said, ” but you didn’t come back, so I didn’t go to dig ...”

” Let’s go and take a look ...” Xia ruofei said.

The two of them came to the spatial spirit pond. There were two plastic boxes here, one big and one small. The orange one was used to cultivate reticulated abalone, while the smaller one was used for the cultivation of wormgrass.

It was small compared to the plastic box used to store abalones. In fact, this one was quite big. It was the largest plastic box in the space. It was 1.5 meters long, one meter wide, and one meter deep.

There was a layer of mesh covering the top of the plastic container. Xia ruofei could see through the mesh that the surface of the container was covered with dense purplish-red grass. It looked like a purple carpet.

During this period of time, Xia ruofei had learned a lot about aweto. He knew that under every blade of grass was another aweto.

In this small area, a conservative estimate would be that there were hundreds of them.

The density was quite scary. If the Gesang father and son had seen it, they would have thought it was a miracle.

The traditional herbalists of Naqu would take a long time to find one wormgrass on a Hill that was four or five thousand meters above sea level. They would be considered lucky if they could find a second one within a few meters.

For hundreds of them to grow in such a small area was something that he didn’t even dare to dream of.

Not all the bat moth larvae were infected with the wormgrass fungus. Some lucky larvae had grown up healthy and turned into bat moths. They were all attached to the mesh or stopped between the grass.

Xia ruofei asked Xia Qing to find an empty plastic sorting box. Then, the two of them carefully opened the gauze net and transferred the bats and moths on the gauze net and in the sorting box into the sorting box. They covered them with the same gauze net.

In the mountain and sea realm, Xia ruofei had cordoned off another two mu of land to specially cultivate the wormgrass. However, without the acceleration of time, the effects of the cultivation there were still not apparent.

These bats and moths could still be placed in the mountain and sea realm.

Of course, this was only one of the reasons. More importantly, it wouldn’t be a problem if they were allowed to fly around freely in the Archean realm. Furthermore, the environment in this space was unique, so they would definitely reproduce very quickly. It would be a small problem if they were to flood the place.
