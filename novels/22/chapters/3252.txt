“Yeah!” Yu Xin ‘er also smiled. We’ve all heard from fellow Daoist li that it’s all thanks to brother Xia that we were able to successfully buy the equipment we wanted this time!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”you’re welcome. We’re a team!” Besides, I’m the first one who doesn’t advocate the use of force easily. Since my medical skills can be used and can allow us to get what we want through relatively peaceful means, I’m bound to do my best. ”

“Oh,” Xia ruofei added,”we had agreed to return to China first, but there’s a change in plans.”

“Oh? Did the American go back on his word?” Chen Xuan said with a frown.

“How is that possible?” Xia ruofei laughed.”It would take about a month to get all the spacesuits ready, so I didn’t want to wait in the United States. I told them that I’d return home after the treatment. However, it’s different now. We only need to wait for another week and we’ll get five spacesuits and a few hundred oxygen supply modules! “Of course, the most important thing is that Elon Musk promised to give us a spaceship for free. He even took the initiative to add a few expansion cabins to the spaceship. This way, it is more than enough to accommodate the nine of us! The modified spaceship and the expansion cabin will be delivered in a week, so ... I think we should just wait in the United States! Anyway, I don’t have anything important to deal with back in the country, so I’ll just take it as a vacation and relax!”

Xia ruofei did not tell Chen Xuan and the rest about the details of the second discussion with Elon Musk.

On one hand, he wanted to give everyone a surprise. On the other hand, Xia ruofei did not want to talk about these things over the phone because he had considered the surveillance of the United States intelligence Department. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Therefore, everyone knew that things had gone much smoother than they had expected.

“That means you won’t have to wear a bulky spacesuit and drift in space for a month or two?” Song Wei asked in surprise.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””Relatively speaking, with such a spaceship, everyone’s journey will be much more comfortable. However, an EVA suit was still a must, and he had to prepare as many as possible! After all, we don’t know when we’ll be able to use it. It’ll be a life – saving weapon in space!”

“It seems like brother Xia’s medical skills have completely convinced this American!” Chen Xuan laughed. This was a good thing! Let’s quickly send this good news back and let the seniors be happy!”

Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand,”let’s wait!” We’ll take the spaceship and spacesuits and go back to our country directly. Besides, we’re in the United States. Even if we use a satellite phone, I’m afraid we can’t rule out the possibility of being monitored, so it’s better not to talk about these details over the phone!”

“That’s true ...” Chen Xuan muttered.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”originally, the spacesuits were only assembled after the spare parts were produced. I asked masker to adjust the process and give us five sets to be delivered together with the spacecraft. This is so that we can try out our design first and see if it’s feasible. At the same time, we can test whether the spacecraft is reliable in orbit. Let’s treat it as a rehearsal before the official moon landing!”
