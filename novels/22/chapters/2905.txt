2906 Mexico Freemasonry (1)

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””It’s me!”

He and Luo Qingfeng were both Chinese, and Luo Qingfeng’s long robe was so eye – catching, so it was impossible for the other party to have mistaken him for someone else.

Xia ruofei could tell that the young man’s voice was different from Zhang Chao ‘s, which meant that it was not Zhang Chao. Xia ruofei asked again,””Brother, what’s your name?”

The young man quickly replied,”Mr. Xia, you’re too polite!” My name is Lu Chunfeng, you can just call me Xiao Lu! It’s brother Chao who asked me to come and pick you up!”

“Mr. Lu, thank you for your hard work!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Where? We’re all brothers, and Mr. Xia is also adopted uncle’s special envoy, so you don’t have to be so polite!” Lu Chunfeng quickly said,”please get in the car!”

After Xia ruofei and Luo Qingfeng got into the business car, the car turned around and drove out of the port.

Lu Chunfeng, who was sitting in the co – Pilot seat, turned around and explained,””Mr. Xia, brother Chao lives quite far away. He was afraid that you would wait for a long time, so he asked me to come and pick you up first. Please forgive me for my negligence!”

“What are you saying! I’ve already troubled you a lot!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Kuachaquarkos port was very large. The car drove for about ten minutes to reach their destination, but they were still in the port area.

Xia ruofei saw that it was a five – story building. The signboard read “Huafeng shipping company” in traditional Chinese. Behind the building, there was a huge warehouse connected to it. It should be the shipping company’s warehouse.

The car drove directly into the yard of the shipping company and stopped. Lu Chunfeng quickly got off and led Xia ruofei and Luo Qingfeng into the shipping company. He took them to a reception room on the first floor, asked someone to serve hot tea, and then said,””Mr. Xia, brother Chao is on his way from home. You may have to wait for a moment.”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it’s okay, go do your thing!” We’ll be fine after resting here for a while!”

Lu Chunfeng scratched his head and said with a smile,””I’m fine! Before brother Chao comes, my mission is to receive the two of you! Mr. Xia, you ... Are you from the United States?”

The United States bordered Mexico. According to Zhang Chao, Xia ruofei was helping Li Yifu this time. Most of Li Yifu’s assets were in the United States, and the company’s headquarters was in Los Angeles so Lu Chunfeng thought that Xia ruofei must have come from the United States.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”this might not be convenient ...”

“I understand!” Lu Chunfeng quickly said. I understand! Mr. Xia, it’s all my fault for being a busybody, please don’t take offense ...”

“I won ‘t, I won’ t!” Xia ruofei said,”it’s just that the matter we’re going to do this time is a little sensitive, so it’s not convenient for us to reveal too much.”

“Yes, yes, yes!” Lu Chunfeng quickly said,”please have some tea! Please have some tea! I know the rules ... It was all my fault for talking too much just now ...”

At this moment, a voice came from outside the door,””Feng! Are you asking all sorts of questions again?”

Lu Chunfeng was so scared that he trembled and quickly retreated to the side.

Xia ruofei heard the voice and immediately stood up with a smile.””This must be Mr. Zhang Chao!”

For a practitioner, they would never forget a voice that they had heard once. Although Zhang Chao had said something, Xia ruofei knew that it was the same person who had answered the phone.

The man was naturally Zhang Chao. He strode in and said with a smile,””Mr. Xia, I rushed here after receiving your call. I didn’t expect to be one step late and neglect our honored guest. I’m so sorry!”

Lu Chunfeng, who was on the side, could not help but secretly click his tongue. He knew that Zhang Chao’s place was at least a 40 – minute drive from here. When they received Zhang Chao’s call, they rushed directly to the place where Xia ruofei had been waiting for the car. After picking up Xia ruofei, they did not delay and returned immediately. The round trip time was only about 20 minutes.

Even if Zhang Chao had rushed to the shipping company immediately after putting down the phone, it was only possible for him to arrive so quickly because he had been speeding all the way. After Xia ruofei and Luo Qingfeng entered the house, they had just drunk a few mouthfuls of water and chatted with Lu Chunfeng for a while. Zhang Chao had already arrived. This was basically just a matter of time.

Although Lu Chunfeng already knew that the two people in front of him were “sent” by Li Yifu, he did not know more inside information.

In fact, when Li Yifu called Zhang Chao, he had specifically and formally instructed Zhang Chao to be polite to Xia ruofei and not neglect him. His tone was full of admiration and even a trace of respect for Xia ruofei.

Li Yifu was an elder of the Hong sect, and he had super financial resources. His position in the Hong sect was very high. Zhang Chao was only a small person in charge of the Hong sect’s branch in Mexico. The difference between the two could be said to be like the difference between heaven and earth. How could he dare to slack off when Li Yifu had entrusted this matter to him seriously?

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”what are you saying?” We’ve caused trouble for Mr. Zhang!”

Zhang Chao quickly said,”Mr. Xia, please don’t say that!” The world’s Hong sect was one big family! Furthermore, uncle Yi is an elder of the Hong sect, a senior that everyone respects. His matters are our matters! How can you say that you’re causing trouble!”

Zhang Chao looked at Lu Chunfeng and said,””Mr. Xia, this kid ah Feng is good at everything else, but he can’t control his mouth. And whether he should know or not, he likes to ask around! If he has offended you in any way, please be magnanimous and don’t stoop to his level!”
