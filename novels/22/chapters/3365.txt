3366 Camel’s thorn ring (3)

At the same time, Xia ruofei flicked his hand and threw the spirit map into the space accurately. Then, with a thought, he directly hid in the space of the spirit map.

All of this happened in a short moment. Xia ruofei did not have the time to think too much. However, at least he knew that he had entered the Archean realm.

Time here flowed 30 times faster than the outside world. Hence, looking at the outside world from the Archean realm was like slow – Motion.

At the same time, Xia ruofei tried his best to control the blue travel immortal sword and the qushuang flying sword to resist the attack of the thorns.

Of course, this process was very short. It could be in the blink of an eye.

Xia ruofei’s spiritual energy detected that the jujube thorn covered the place where he had just disappeared at a thirty times slower speed. Although he could control the blue immortal sword and the qushuang flying sword to block it, it would not increase the speed of the flying sword because of the change in the flow of time. This was because his spiritual energy was not enough.

Therefore, even though the qushuang flying sword and the blue immortal sword had blocked many thorns, a large number of them still flew past the flying sword’s protective line.

The target of the spirit painting was smaller but two thorns still hit it. Xia ruofei’s heart could not help but tremble.

If the spirit painting was damaged, the consequences would be extremely serious.

Xia ruofei’s origin was this spirit map. His entire fortune was in this spirit map space. Once the spirit map was destroyed, he would be completely broke.

This wasn’t the most serious thing. The important thing was that he was now inside the spirit map space. Once the space collapsed, he would also fall into the spatial turbulence and might be lost forever.

Fortunately, the spirit painting was not so easily destroyed. The two thorns did not leave any marks on the spirit painting. Xia ruofei, who was in the spirit painting space, did not feel any vibration in the space.

His anxious heart was finally at ease.

In fact, in a split second, Xia ruofei chose to use the spirit map scroll to Dodge. He had already foreseen that it was impossible for him to block all the attacks with the blue immortal sword and the qushuang flying sword. Therefore, he was mentally prepared for the spirit map scroll to be attacked.

He was still confident in the spirit map. However, when the thorn attack really landed on the spirit map, he couldn’t help but tremble.

Those thorns, whether it was the ones that missed, the two that hit the spirit map scroll, or the ones that were blocked by the blue immortal sword and the qushuang flying sword, all flew up from the dust after this wave of attack and flew towards the camel thorn.

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry as he watched the thorns return to the mother plant at a speed 30 times slower. He knew that his attempt had failed. So these thorns could be retrieved. It was impossible to exhaust all the thorns of camel’s thorn by continuously testing them.

When Xia ruofei saw that the thorns had started to withdraw, he left the spirit map space with a thought.

Although Xia ruofei had stayed in the spirit map space for a few minutes, it was only the blink of an eye in the outside world. To Ling Qingxue, the thorns basically covered the sky and covered the earth as they enveloped Xia ruofei. Seeing that Xia ruofei could not avoid them, his figure suddenly disappeared. Immediately after, the thorns retracted and Xia ruofei’s figure flashed and reappeared on the spot.

If one did not stare intently, one would not even notice that Xia ruofei had disappeared.

After Xia ruofei left the spirit map space, the first thing he did was to look at the spirit map. Although he had already checked it with his spiritual power, he was still worried. He had to see it for himself.

When he saw that there wasn’t a single mark on the painting, he was completely relieved. At the same time, he put the painting back into his palm.

At this moment, Ling Qingxue finally reacted. She sobbed and shouted,””Ruofei, are you alright?”

Ling Qingxue ran towards Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei quickly waved his hand and said,”Qingxue!” Don’t come over! This place is not safe! I’m fine, I’m fine!”

“You’re really fine?” Ling Qingxue stopped obediently and asked worriedly.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’m really fine!” I have a lot of defensive magic treasures on me! The attack of mere thorns can’t do anything to me! Don’t worry!”

“Oh! Then you have to be careful!” Ling Qingxue said.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I know!” You stand there and don’t come over!”

With that, Xia ruofei turned around and looked at the ring formed by the densely packed camel thorns. He felt a little helpless.

This camel’s back could actually retrieve the thorns that were shot out, which was a little tricky.

In the field of vision of the perceptual mirror, the spot of light was in the center of the ring.

As the distance was very close, Xia ruofei could see the ring formed by the entire camel’s thorn through the map of the perceptual mirror. It could be said to be airtight. In addition, the attack range of the camel’s thorn was up to 10 to 20 meters. It was completely impossible to bypass the camel’s thorn and sneak into the area where the light spot was.

Xia ruofei took out a picnic chair from the spirit map space and sat down on it, staring at the camel’s thorn bushes in a daze.

If he couldn’t use trickery, he could only attack.

Xia ruofei sat on the chair, took out the qushuang flying sword and the blue immortal sword, and slashed at the nearest camel thorn.

The range of Xia ruofei’s flying sword was more than 20 meters, so he could attack the camel’s thorn from a safe position.

Of course, this kind of attack was also a probing attack. He did not expect to use such a simple method to break the circular defensive zone formed by the camel’s thorns.

Sure enough, when the flying sword and the blue immortal sword hit the camel’s thorn, they were bounced off without even leaving a trace. However, the camel’s thorn’s counterattack made the flying sword and the blue immortal sword crooked and almost fell to the ground.
