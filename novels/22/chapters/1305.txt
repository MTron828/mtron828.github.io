Chapter 1306: Someone from the headquarters (1)

Translator: 549690339

President Lin excitedly took his phone to the villa’s yard to make a call, while Dr. Huang and President Lin’s other subordinates tidied up and packed all the Cordyceps.

After a while, President Lin walked back to the living room with a depressed expression.

Xia ruofei was stunned and asked,””President Lin, what’s wrong? Things aren’t going well?”

President Lin quickly forced a smile and said,””No, no! However, brother Xia, our deal may have to be delayed for another day. The headquarters will send someone to follow up in person!”

President Lin was also quite depressed. The headquarters said that they had to show that they valued such a big deal, so they had specially appointed a manager to fly to the three mountains today. In fact, President Lin knew that they might be trying to take the fruits of their labor.

This deal was made completely based on his own connections. If he didn’t have a good personal relationship with Xia ruofei, he wouldn’t have to worry about not having a market for such high – Quality Cordyceps.

This performance was too eye – catching, so much so that it made people envious. Even with President Lin’s current Foundation, he was still a little reluctant.

“What’s the situation?” Xia ruofei frowned.

President Lin sighed and said,”brother Xia, the headquarters also values this deal, so they sent people over.”

President Lin was embarrassed to mention the company’s internal affairs in front of Xia ruofei. After all, dirty laundry should not be aired in public.

However, Xia ruofei was no longer a greenhorn. His ability to read people’s expressions had improved greatly in the past year. When he saw that President Lin was like a frosted eggplant, how could he not guess the secret behind this?

Xia ruofei thought for a while and smiled.”President Lin, then you can rest at ease here for a day! We’re old friends, so just treat this as your home!”

He then turned to Feng Rao and said,””Director Feng, get the administration department to prepare the guest house rooms. Director Lin and the others will be staying over at the farm today!”

“Brother Xia, there’s no need to go through so much trouble ...” President Lin quickly said.”We can just go to the city and stay in a hotel!”

“It’s an hour’s drive back and forth! What’s the point of this?” Xia ruofei said,”let’s live on the farm!” The environment here is much better than the city!”

President Lin’s heart also felt a little warm as he said,””Alright, I’ll listen to you ...”

“Then you guys should go and rest in the afternoon! The flight was already tiring, and then they rushed to the farm to work, they must be exhausted!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Alright, thank you, brother Xia!” President Lin said,”then you should rest for a while. We won’t disturb you any longer ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.

Mr. Lin looked at the three big boxes of quality Cordyceps on the coffee table unwillingly, then turned around and walked out of the villa.

Xia ruofei personally sent them to the courtyard entrance. After President Lin and the rest had left, he turned around and walked back to the villa.

Xia ruofei kept the aweto back into the spirit map space and shook his head with a helpless smile.

This could be considered as a good thing with many setbacks!

However, Xia ruofei was not worried. He did not have to worry about not being able to sell such good wormgrass. Even if there were no buyers who could buy all of them, they could still sell them slowly.

If he really couldn’t gather enough money for the acquisition, he could just transfer the money from his overseas account. As long as he did it one day in advance, the money would be transferred to his account very quickly.

Xia ruofei did not go to the office in the afternoon. After taking a short nap, he got up and went downstairs. He sat on the recliner in the yard, held a book, made a pot of tea, and leisurely spent time under the winter sun. Blackie and the rest were also playing happily by Xia ruofei’s feet. The scene was very harmonious and warm.

When it was almost 5 pm, Xia ruofei received a call from Liu Qian.

As Xia ruofei did not work in the company often, he rejected the administrative team’s offers to assign him an assistant. Usually, Liu Qian would be in charge of ensuring that everything went well. It was equivalent to him sharing an assistant with Feng Jing. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Chairman, the people from Tongren Hall’s headquarters have arrived.” Liu Qian said,”they came straight to the farm after they got off the plane ...”

Xia ruofei was not familiar with the people in the headquarters of Tongren Hall. He was also a little unhappy that a good deal was suspended. Xia ruofei would not believe the so – called “valued” excuse. So, he pretended to be confused and did not arrange for anyone to pick him up.

Xia ruofei thought,”he’s quite impatient ...”

He asked indifferently,”what are they doing here so late at night?” It’s almost time to get off work, right?”

“They want to talk to you about the acquisition of aweto as soon as possible,” Liu Qian said.

“Just tell them that I’m not at the farm. Besides, the company is closing soon. If there’s anything, we can talk about it tomorrow!” Xia ruofei said with a frown.

“Alright!” Liu Qian hesitated again and asked,”then, about the food and accommodation of these two people ...”

“Are there any empty rooms in the company’s guest house?” Xia ruofei asked.

“No more!” Liu Qian said,”President Lin, there are six people here this time. Our guest house doesn’t have many rooms to begin with ...”

“Then isn’t it settled?” Xia ruofei said,”you don’t have to take the initiative to arrange for them. Tongren Hall is such a big family business. Can’t they afford a few travel expenses?”

“Understood!” Liu Qian quickly said.

After hanging up the phone, Xia ruofei didn’t pay much attention to it. He placed his phone on the stone table and picked up his book.
