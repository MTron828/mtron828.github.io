Translator: 549690339

The first impression Gulangyu gave people was that it was a carefree place. There were many small shops that were romantic and full of artistic atmosphere. There were also no noisy carriages on the island. Everywhere was filled with the chirping of birds and the fragrance of flowers. After arriving here, the pace would involuntarily slow down.

Of course, with the development of tourism, more and more tourists came to the island. Fortunately, it was not a holiday, so at least there were no signs of crowds.

Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao strolled aimlessly on the island. They did not go to the tourist spots. Instead, they preferred to go to the original alleys.

These alleys were all very classical. Xia ruofei also realized that Gulangyu had preserved many buildings with various Chinese and foreign styles. There were traditional Chinese temples with upturned eaves, small and exquisite Wei nation houses, and the 19th – century European style original Western Embassy.

Different cultures were intertwined here, but there was nothing out of place. On the contrary, Gulangyu gained the reputation of the world Expo.

Xia ruofei admired the historical buildings with great interest and took photos with his camera from time to time. The scenery of Gulangyu was beautiful, and the photos he took were beautiful.

With Xia ruofei’s company, Lin Qiao was happy from the bottom of her heart. Like a happy bird, she brought Xia ruofei to many small shops with fresh and artistic styles to taste the pies and milk tea here.

They strolled along the small path, tasted the local snacks, and walked and stopped at will. Everything was so simple and natural. Xia ruofei liked this feeling of a slow pace because he was a lazy person who liked to be relaxed ...

The two strolled for two or three hours, but Lin Qiao wasn’t tired at all. She was still in high spirits, and they unknowingly walked to the vicinity of the hotel.

Xia ruofei was worried that Lin Qiao was working too hard and was about to suggest that they go back to the hotel to rest when Lin Qiao excitedly pointed to an inconspicuous coffee shop by the road and said,”Brother ruofei! I want to go to that shop!”

Xia ruofei took a look and said,”didn’t we have coffee half an hour ago?” You’re still drinking?”

“This one is different!” Lin Qiao grabbed Xia ruofei’s arm and shook it as she said,”brother ruofei, I want to drink ...”

Xia ruofei had no choice but to nod and say,””Alright! We can go in if you want to drink, but you have to tell me what’s different about this coffee shop. You can’t not say it!”

“No problem!” Lin Qiao said happily. But let’s go in first, and I’ll tell you slowly!”

Xia ruofei looked at Lin Qiao with affection and said,””Alright then!”

Lin Qiao pulled Xia ruofei into the coffee shop called “monkey year horse month”. The shop was very small, and the corridor – style storefront was a little slender. It had a feeling of a winding path leading to a quiet place, which was very unique. The walls were hung with various abstract oil paintings and some carefully decorated decorations, which made it very emotional.

The two of them went to the guest Pavilion and found an empty seat.

There were many books in the room, all from the 1990s. There was a faint music in his ears, and the air was filled with the strong smell of coffee.

After Lin Qiao ordered two cups of coffee, Xia ruofei asked,””Qiao’ er, tell me! What’s so special about this shop?”

Lin Qiao pointed at the girl who came to order for them and said,””That was the lady boss of this shop, her surname is MA.”

Xia ruofei rolled his eyes and smiled.””So the boss’s surname must be hou?”

Lin Qiao clapped her hands and said,”Amazing! Brother ruofei, your brain works really fast! I guessed it right away!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”God knows when!” It’s not hard to guess!”

Lin Qiao smiled and said,”but you don’t know. Many years ago, this place wasn’t a coffee shop. It was an Art Gallery. The owner of the gallery is the owner of the coffee shop now. The paintings on the wall just now were drawn by the owner ...”

At this time, the lady boss who had just ordered for them came over with two cups of coffee. The freshly ground coffee was still steaming and filled with the rich aroma of coffee. She put the coffee down with a smile and said,””Please enjoy your meal!”

Lin Qiao was just telling their story when the main character came. She suddenly felt embarrassed.

On the other hand, the lady boss was generous. She looked at Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao with a smile before she turned around and left.

Lin Qiao smiled at Xia ruofei in embarrassment and continued,””At that time, the boss’s wife was still very young. She came to Egret Island for a tour alone and strolled around Gulangyu. She came to this Art Gallery and chatted with the boss, then ...”

“And then they fell in love!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Mm! After that, the lady boss stayed. In order to commemorate the time when they met, the boss changed the gallery into a coffee shop and changed the name to’ monkey year and horse month ‘. The two spent their time in this small coffee shop every day ...”Lin Qiao’s face showed a trace of yearning and continued,” so this is the place where their romantic love will sprout, and this shop is their witness! Brother ruofei, I said this café is special, right?”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded,”it sounds like a beautiful story!”

“Of course!” Lin Qiao said,”every time my roommates come to Gulangyu, we would come here to have a cup of coffee. We hope that we can also have a chance encounter with our beautiful love!”
