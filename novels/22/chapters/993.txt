How would the directors dare to check again? They didn’t even dare to look at the tickets, and even kept reflecting on themselves. Each of their attitudes were very fearful and reverent, as if they had made a huge mistake.

In fact, the directors all knew what these fines were.

Just now, Tian Mingyi didn’t dare to hide anything and told him everything.

As for Tian Mingyi, inspector Wu, and the others, they were like frost – beaten eggplants. They all lowered their heads and didn’t even dare to breathe. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Manager Lu, who was standing outside the door, felt an indescribable pleasure when he saw this group of people, who had been arrogant before, become like this.

Manager Lu had been working in the service industry for so many years and had suffered many similar vexations. Basically, as long as the government was in front of them, they were all big bosses. Today, manager Lu really had a feeling of being able to hold his head high. This was the first time in his life that he had experienced this feeling.

“Investigate this matter thoroughly!” Song Qiming said calmly. Give me your decision on how to deal with it tomorrow!”

“Yes, Secretary song!” The directors responded one after another.

They heaved a sigh of relief. At least, Secretary song had no intention of holding them responsible.

As for the life and death of director Wu and the others, these directors didn’t care at all.

They had long hated this group of people in their hearts. Not to mention, after such a thing had happened, their political lives were long over. Who would care about them?

Secretary song was going to deal with the results tomorrow, and it had to be very strict. Otherwise, if the Secretary was not satisfied, the bureau chiefs would have to bear the consequences.

Not to mention that a few of them were contract workers, even if they were official civil servants, it was not a big deal to be fired.

They could only blame this group of people for being blind. They were used to being arrogant and domineering and had encountered many ghosts at night. This time, they had kicked an iron plate, no, it was simply a red – hot iron plate!

Therefore, the next day, the opinions on the handling of the personnel involved were quickly issued by each unit, and it was unprecedentedly strict.

All the contract – based employees were dismissed, and the public officials were also given various disciplinary actions according to the severity of the matter, such as being transferred from the city, etc. Tian Mingyi and director Wu were directly dismissed from public office.

After dealing with this group of people, the directors also secretly heaved sighs of relief.

However, what happened next proved that these bureau chiefs were happy too early.

The next day, song Qiming talked to the mayor, the Deputy Secretary, and a few other key members of the Standing Committee. Soon, a big rectification to strengthen the work style was carried out in full swing in the city.

The reorganization this time was mainly aimed at the bureaucratic style of some departments, which was “difficult to enter, ugly, and difficult to handle”, as well as the abuse of power by a few units and public officials.

The reorganization of the staff was the first fire that song Qiming started after he took office. This fire hurt many people. Many units and departments were used to doing this, but it had now become a work style problem.

The municipal Party Committee had sent many supervision teams to investigate the matter. Almost every day, a group of negative examples that violated the municipal Party committee’s style and rectification spirit would be publicized. Almost all the civil servants in Sanshan city were on tenterhooks, afraid that the sharp sword hanging over their heads would fall.

Many of the working units in Sanshan city were in high spirits. The citizens ‘reactions were also quite excited. The public could feel the simplification of procedures and the strengthening of service awareness. Therefore, there were more and more praises for song Qiming, the new Secretary, on the local forums.

At the same time, under song Qiming’s instructions, the Sanshan City Commission for Discipline Inspection and the Procuratorate’s Anti – Corruption Bureau cooperated to carry out a series of secret investigations.

Just a week after the reorganization, the website of the municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection suddenly announced the news of many division – Level cadres being investigated for being suspected of breaking the law.

Among them were Tian Feilong, the Deputy Director of the health Bureau, and two other directors. Their people had also participated in the joint inspection team that day.

Director sun of the health Bureau was quite lucky. He was not found to have violated any discipline or law. However, his management of the unit was seriously inadequate, and the construction of the unit was in a mess. There was also a corrupt person like Tian Feilong. As the director, he could not absolve himself from the blame.

Soon, director sun was dismissed and transferred to the City Association of Science and Technology to serve as a Deputy Director who enjoyed the treatment of a director. This had already announced the end of his political life in advance. A director was the highest level he could reach in his life.

The only thing he could do now was to wait for his retirement at the Qingshui Yamen.

Of course, this was all a story for later.

Back to the night of the incident, song Qiming left the room after saying that.

After song Qiming left, the directors quickly led their subordinates out of Ling Ji’s private kitchen.

They were secretly in awe of this newly opened restaurant and decided to remind their subordinates not to come and provoke this restaurant and cause trouble for themselves.

Flying Snow Pavilion.

Ling Xiaotian said to song Qiming gratefully,””Secretary song, thank you so much for today!”

Song Qiming smiled.”Chairman Ling, this incident was caused by an official’s abuse of power. Strictly speaking, as the Secretary, I have to reflect on my actions!”

“Secretary song, you’re being too serious ...” Ling Xiaotian said hurriedly.”We’ve seen a lot of things like this in our line of work, but not many of them are as reckless as today ...”

Song Qiming said sternly,”there will be fewer and fewer of these things in the future!” I’ve decided to carry out a major reorganization of the administration in Sanshan city, especially in some of the more influential units. I hope that Chairman Ling can keep an eye on our work!”

“Definitely, definitely ...” Ling Xiaotian said.

It was almost Teno’ clock at night. Song Qiming and his family got up and prepared to leave.

At this moment, Xia ruofei took out the pills that he had prepared earlier and smiled.””Secretary song, this is the medicine for a course of treatment. I estimate that after this course of treatment, the toxins in the body should be cleared. After another course of treatment, it will be safe!”

Song Qiming quickly gestured for Fang Liyun to take the wrapped pills. He held Xia ruofei’s hand tightly and said with gratitude,””RUO Fei, Wei Wei really has you to thank this time! No words can express my gratitude for your great kindness! I won’t say any more!”

Song Qiming patted Xia ruofei’s shoulder. He did not need to say anything.

Xia ruofei and the rest sent song Qiming and his family to the door and then returned to flying Snow Pavilion.

“Ruofei, you called us back ... Is there anything else?” Ling Xiaotian asked.

Xia ruofei chuckled as he took out the ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ secret recipe that he had copied down and passed it to Ling Xiaotian. Then, he smiled without saying a word.

Ling Xiaotian was confused. He took it and looked at it. His body trembled and he looked up at Xia ruofei.”RUO Fei, this ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”uncle Ling, it’s the first opening of Ling Ji’s private kitchen. I can’t really cook a dish as a gift!” This is the real congratulatory gift!”

Ling Xiaotian held the recipe as if he had obtained a treasure and said excitedly,””Ruofei, this gift is too precious! Uncle thanks you!”

Ling Xiaotian had long treated Xia ruofei as his son – in – Law, so he did not reject him politely.

Ling Qingxue’s beautiful eyes also revealed a trace of splendor. She glanced at Xia ruofei flirtatiously. Xia ruofei also blinked at Ling Qingxue, as if asking her: Wife, my performance is passable, right?

Seeing Xia ruofei’s funny expression, Ling Qingxue could not help but cover her mouth and laugh.

Ling Xiaotian’s attention was focused on the recipe, and he did not notice the young couple’s affectionate looks.

He said rather excitedly,”it turns out that it’s just some minor adjustments in the process. In addition, a few Chinese medicines were added. It can actually improve the taste by a large margin!” And I didn’t taste any Chinese medicine at all, this is amazing!”

“Uncle Ling, this ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ can be the main signature dish of the Ling’s private kitchen!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“That’s for sure!” Ling Xiaotian said,”I believe that with this dish, our Ling Ji’s private kitchen’s brand will be famous very soon! In the future, we’ll have a place in the high – end F & B industry! RUO Fei! You’re really sending charcoal in the snow!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”I got this recipe by chance. It won’t be of any use to me. I thought it might be useful to uncle Ling, so ...”

“It’s simply too useful!” Ling Xiaotian said happily.

“Uncle Ling, you have to think about keeping the recipe a secret!” Xia ruofei reminded him.

“I know that,” Ling Xiaotian replied calmly. I definitely can’t go to the kitchen to do specific things. I don’t have the time! My apprentices are quite reliable, especially the head chef of Ling’s private kitchen. He’s my eldest apprentice and has been with me for more than twenty years. ”

Xia ruofei nodded.”Since we’re going to launch this dish at Ling Ji private kitchen, the head chef here must learn how to cook it. As long as you trust him, there’s no problem.”

“Ruofei, this is what I’m thinking.” Ling Xiaotian said,”there is definitely no problem with my eldest disciple. He has been learning from me since he was young and has been working for me since I opened the small restaurant. After we set up the company, I also gave him some shares, so I have decided to pass this recipe to him first.”

Ling Xiaotian paused for a moment before continuing,””After the Ling’s private kitchen opens a branch in the future, I think we can select trustworthy chefs and learn the skills of pre – processing ingredients. The most important part, the Chinese medicine, will be supplied by this flagship store. This will minimize the possibility of leaking secrets.”

“I think it’s a good idea,” Xia ruofei nodded. Uncle Ling, in the next few days, you can try out this secret recipe’s cooking method with your eldest disciple. The main thing is to try to mix the medicinal herbs in the Chinese medicine packet, grind them into powder, and mix them together to see if it will affect the final taste. If it doesn’t affect the final taste at all, it will be even less likely to leak out!”

If it was just a Chinese medicine packet, someone could roughly deduce the formula after opening it and analyzing it a little. However, if it was all ground into powder and mixed together, it would be difficult to completely crack it even with the use of equipment analysis.

After all, the composition of Chinese medicine was very complicated, and it wasn’t purely medicinal.

“That’s a good idea!” Ling Xiaotian slapped his thigh and said with a smile,”ruofei, you’re really smart! I’ll ask ah Ming to start preparing the ingredients tonight. Our main task for the next two days will be to try to cook ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’!”

……

In the Qingjiang villa district.

In Ling Qingxue’s boudoir in Ling Xiaotian’s huge Riverside Villa.

The moment Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue entered the house, they hugged each other tightly.

It was unknown if it was to give the two of them some space to be alone, but Ling Xiaotian did not return to the villa tonight. According to him, he had to process the ingredients together with his eldest disciple overnight to prepare the ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ dish the next day.

There were also a few resting rooms in the Ling’s private kitchen, and Ling Xiaotian had said that he would be staying there for the night.

Xia ruofei was more than happy to hear that.

He had been in Australia for more than 20 days, and he had already tasted the taste of it. Now that his future father – in – Law had taken the initiative to create an opportunity for him, how could he let it go?

Hence, Xia ruofei immediately brought Ling Qingxue back to the mansion by the river.

The villa’s central air – conditioning maintained the comfortable temperature of 26 degrees, but the two of them felt their body temperature constantly rising.

Suddenly, the warmth of spring filled the room ...
