2575 Visiting (1)

Feng Jing’s voice came from the infrared camera at the door,””Who is it?”

Before Xia ruofei could say anything, Feng Jing’s exclamation came from the intercom. Xia ruofei even heard the sound of her kicking something.

“Sister ran, are you alright?” Xia ruofei asked hurriedly.

“I’m fine! I’m fine!” Feng Jing said from inside the house,”wait a minute!”

“Oh! “It’s okay, there’s no rush ...”Xia ruofei said, somewhat baffled.

Didn’t she just come to visit? Why are you so surprised?

Xia ruofei suddenly thought of a possibility. Could there be someone else at sister ran’s house? Boyfriend? If that was the case, then he had really sinned ...

He waited for seven to eight minutes before he heard the door open. Feng Rao pushed the door open and looked at him.”Come in!”

After Xia ruofei entered the house, he changed his shoes and looked around.

“What are you looking for?” Feng Rao couldn’t help asking.

Xia ruofei hesitated and asked,””Sister ran, are you home alone?”

Feng Rao couldn’t help but laugh.”Nonsense! My family didn’t come to live with me. If I’m not alone, how many people can I have?”

“Oh ...” Xia ruofei secretly heaved a sigh of relief.

“Why are you acting so weird?” Feng Rao chuckled.

“Oh! It’s fine, it’s fine!” Xia ruofei quickly said,”Oh right, this is for you. I bought it in Spain as a gift!”

Feng Rao received the gift box and smiled.”At least you still have some conscience!”

Feng Jing opened the gift box and exclaimed in surprise,””What a beautiful brooch! Thank you!”

“I’m glad you like it!”Xia ruofei smiled.

“This brooch isn’t cheap, right?” Feng Rao asked.

Xia ruofei laughed.”You’re an elite with financial freedom. Why do you care about the price?”

Feng Rao glared at Xia ruofei and said, “You’re the one with financial freedom, okay? I’m just a higher – Class worker!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”alright!” Let me put it another way. Since it’s a gift from an elite with financial freedom, why do you still care about the price? It’s just a small amount of money to me!”

“Alright, alright!” Feng Rao didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. You’re right ...”

“Do you want to try?” Xia ruofei said,”Speaking of which ... Your clothes go well with this brooch! The effect should be pretty good! But ... Why are you wearing such formal clothes at home?”

Feng Rao’s face turned red and she glared at Xia ruofei.

Wasn’t it you? You didn’t even say hello before coming to visit. Do you think he’s going to welcome you in his home clothes?

When Feng Jing saw that it was Xia ruofei standing at the door through the video intercom screen, she was overjoyed. At the same time, her first thought was to quickly change out of her loose home clothes. Her closet was set next to her bedroom on the second floor, so she ran upstairs as fast as she could to change and tidy up her hair.

Speaking of which, it only took seven to eight minutes to complete all of this. This speed was already a miracle.

Feng Jing did not answer Xia ruofei’s question, nor did she try the brooch on the spot. She closed the gift box and said,””Come over and sit! By the way, what would you like to drink? I have black tea, green tea, and coffee, but they’re instant. ”

“I’ll just have a glass of water! I just finished dinner. ” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

The two of them walked into the living room. Feng Jing brought Xia ruofei a glass of warm water and sat down on the sofa. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Xia ruofei looked around and said with a smile,””I haven’t been here since your house was renovated!”

“Now you know how improper you are?” Feng Rao said,”I’m afraid you haven’t spent more than 20 days in the three mountains in the past few months!”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”It’s a little ... But it’s mainly because my CEO sister is too capable. I don’t need to worry about the company at all!”

“It’s my fault!” Feng Rao rolled her eyes in annoyance.

“I’m complimenting you!” Xia ruofei said,”why would I blame you?”

Feng Jing was actually enjoying her current job. However, after seeing Xia ruofei, she couldn’t help but complain. This was already a daily routine for them.

Soon, the two of them started talking about the company.

“RUO Fei, you won’t leave immediately after coming back, right?” Feng Jing asked,”if you’re free, you should visit the company more often. Some new employees might not even know what the chairman looks like!”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”if there’s nothing urgent, I’ll stay at the three mountains for a while.” Don’t worry, I’ll start working at the company tomorrow! I promise I won’t be late and leave early!”

Xia ruofei realized that he did not have anything urgent to attend to recently. He did not need to worry about the peach blossom society in the capital. Zhao Yongjun, song Rui, and the others were all taking care of things well. Even if he went, he would be slacking off. It was also impossible for the spirit map space to upgrade in a short period of time, mainly because there was no pattern to the world stone, and it was basically the kind of fate that could find it. As for the Spanish clubs, he did not intend to participate in any games unless they were particularly important.
