Chapter 1356: Chapter 807 – losing the wife and the Army (2)

Translator: 549690339

Tian Xiaojun put on a pitiful expression and said,”Young master Xia, we really didn’t mean to offend you. We really didn’t recognize you ... But we did offend you, so we should apologize ...”

Zhao Yong Jun’s eyes widened, Tian Xiao Jun was scared and quickly said: “Compensate me! We’ll pay!”

“Speak clearly! How much should he pay? How do you want to compensate?” Zhao Yongjun said impatiently.

“Twenty ... No! Three hundred thousand!” Tian Xiaojun said with a pained expression.

This time, he had really suffered a double loss. Not only did he not get any benefits, but he also got himself into trouble and lost a sum of money for no reason. He was really unlucky.

Tian Xiaojun and the other two weren’t the children of rich and powerful families, otherwise, they wouldn’t have been so embarrassed about the peach blossom company’s business.

Besides, even if their father’s generation had a lot of property of unknown origin, they didn’t dare to spend it!

Therefore, 300,000 Yuan was not a small amount to Tian Xiaojun and the others.

When Zhong Zixin heard this from the side, she couldn’t help but feel so distressed that the corner of her mouth twitched.

This money was definitely going to be split among the three of them, and she and Xia Ling might even have to pay more. She knew Tian Xiaojun’s character the best.

When Hou Liang heard this, he could not help but berate,”Tian Xiaojun, are you trying to get rid of a beggar?”

” 300000 ... You really have the nerve to say that!” Xu Zi Xuan also said with disdain. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

If they were to count the Drunken Eight Immortals liquor, their dinner tonight would have cost more than a hundred thousand Yuan. However, Tian Xiaojun had only paid three hundred thousand Yuan for such a huge mistake. This made Hou Liang and the others feel like they had been humiliated.

Could it be that this was the only effect they could achieve when they came forward together?

Zhao Yong Jun also said coldly,”Tian Xiao Jun, you mean ... Me, song Rui, Liu Jian, Hou Liang, Xu Zi Xuan, Wei Jun, and my brother RUO Fei, all of our faces added together, are only worth a mere 300000?.”

Every time Zhao Yong Jun reported a name, Tian Xiao Jun couldn’t help but shiver.

Among these names, other than Wei Jun and Xia ruofei, he could not afford to offend any of them. In fact, in Tian Xiaojun’s heart, Xia ruofei was the most terrifying one.

It was because the people above that he could not afford to offend were all on good terms with Xia ruofei and even treated him as the center of attention.

“Young master Zhao! Young master Xia! We really don’t have any money!” Tian Xiaojun said with a sad face.

“If you don’t have money, why did you learn to invest?” Zhao Yongjun said mercilessly,”if you don’t have money, why did you swagger to Sanshan?”

“Let’s ... Let’s pool our money together. At most ... At most, we can take out 40...450000!” Tian Xiaojun gritted his teeth and said,”young master Zhao, this is really the limit of our abilities ...”

In fact, if he asked his family, he could even get four million Yuan, let alone four hundred thousand Yuan. But how would Tian Xiaojun dare to do that?

If he couldn’t settle this matter today, he would be beaten to death by his father when he returned!

No matter how rich his family was, he didn’t dare to reveal any of it tonight!

The 450,000 Yuan He mentioned was all legitimate income with evidence. As for the gray income in their family, if any bit of it were to be leaked tonight, it could be a big disaster.

Because Tian Xiaojun couldn’t confirm Zhao Yongjun’s true purpose, what if they wanted to kill him? Then wouldn’t this money be the evidence that came to his door?

Xia ruofei didn’t care about the money at all. Three hundred thousand, four hundred thousand, or even five million were just a string of numbers to him. After a few ten – million – dollar auctions and the limited purchase of the jaded skin cream that had a revenue of over a hundred million, Xia ruofei wouldn’t even bat an eye when this little money was placed in front of him.

However, he was the same as Zhao Yong Jun and the others, he didn’t want to let Tian Xiao Jun and the others off so easily.

Xia ruofei thought for a moment and asked,””Deputy Director Tian, aren’t you being a little insincere? In the private room this evening, you guys claimed that you would take out a million to invest in our paradise Corporation!”

Tian Xiaojun’s face turned bitter.

If he could really get 51% of the shares of paradise Corporation, he would naturally have a million Yuan, but he would definitely have to scrape it together or ask his family for help.

But this was not the time to buy shares! This was compensation!

Was he going to owe a huge debt because of this?

Zhao Yongjun’s eyes widened.””That’s right! Don’t tell me you didn’t even want to give me this one million Yuan at that time, and just wanted to eat the shares of the Paradise company?”

“No, no!” Tian Xiaojun quickly said,”we definitely have to give it to him ... But ... If we reach an agreement, we ... We have to go and borrow money ...”

“Then go and borrow it!” Xia ruofei said without hesitation.

He coldly glanced at Tian Xiaojun and said,””Since you dare to use one million to eat up 51% of my shares, then you should be prepared to lose this one million!”

“One million and you’ll let them go?” Zhao Yongjun looked at Xia ruofei and said,”isn’t this letting them off too easily?”

Tian Xiaojun wailed in his heart, this is cheap? One million Yuan was enough for him to live a year of leisure!

Xia ruofei smiled.”Brother Zhao, please leave them a way out. There’s no need to force them into a dead end.”

Tian Xiaojun and the other two wanted to cry but had no tears. They asked for a million Yuan, and they still wanted to leave a way out? What if he left no room for negotiation? Would the three of them be bankrupt?

Zhao Yongjun shrugged.”Don’t explain ... You’re just too soft – hearted!”

Xia ruofei laughed and looked at Tian Xiaojun, saying,”Deputy Director Tian, have you made up your mind? Let’s use a million to settle this matter, or let big brother Zhao and the others use our own methods to solve it?”

Tian Xiaojun couldn’t help but shiver. He didn’t even discuss it with Zhong Zixin and Xia Ling and quickly said, “Good! A million it is! Just take it as our apology to young master Xia!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said, ” I don’t want this one million either. Our paradise Corporation has a Charity Foundation. I’ll give you three days to donate this money anonymously to our Charity Foundation. You must also ensure that the money comes from a clean source! Can you do it? ”

Of course, Xia ruofei wouldn’t let people talk about him for a million dollars. Previously, in order to thank Xia ruofei for curing Tang Haoran, Australia’s Tang Yitian had donated ten million dollars to set up a charity fund in paradise Corporation. Now that he had received the one million dollars in the name of the charity fund, there was no problem at all.

Moreover, the accounts of the charity fund were public. In addition to the normal operating costs, most of the charity funds would be used for charity. It could be considered as washing away some of the sins of Tian Xiaojun and his group!

Tian Xiaojun felt as if all the bones in his body had been pulled out. His heart ached so much that he clenched his teeth. However, Tian Xiaojun did not dare to disobey Xia ruofei’s question and quickly replied, “No problem! No problem! We’ll raise the money tomorrow! I’ll definitely pay you on time!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,” alright, that’s my first condition!” The second ...”

Tian Xiaojun’s face turned pale. He had thought that one million Yuan would be enough to buy peace. He did not expect that this was only the first condition. What about the other conditions? Do you still want me to live?

Xia ruofei smiled. ” Don’t worry. I only have two conditions. The second one shouldn’t be too difficult for you. ”

Tian Xiaojun let out a sigh of relief in his heart. He said somewhat awkwardly,”Young master Xia, please speak!”

Xia ruofei said calmly,”the second condition is ... After you go back, spread what happened today in the circle. I don’t want any flies or mosquitoes to come after the smell of money.”

In front of Tian Xiaojun and the other two, he had clearly said that they were disgusting flies and mosquitoes, but Tian Xiaojun and the others had to listen obediently. This was true strength.

After hearing Xia ruofei’s condition, Tian Xiaojun and the other two’s faces turned pale. The three of them looked at each other with a troubled expression.
