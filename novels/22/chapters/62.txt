Chapter 63: Bottom line of principles (1)

The dejected he Dong exploded when he heard this. He shouted at Xia ruofei in exasperation,” “What? You wish! Who Do You Think You Are? What right do you have to fire me?” He then turned to Ling Xiaotian and said,” “Uncle Ling, you must not listen to him! Even though his paradise vegetables is praised so highly, it’s just a rumor. We’ve never seen it in real life. Moreover, he just admitted that there’s no authoritative test report or planting base!” Ling Qingxue looked at he Dong in disgust and said sarcastically,” “During the company meeting just now, I think you were the one who praised Taoyuan vegetables to the heavens, right? We didn’t say anything!” “I ...” He Dong was instantly at a loss for words. He could only hope that Ling Xiaotian would be considerate of their past relationship. He knew that if it was anyone else, Ling Xiaotian would definitely agree to Xia ruofei’s conditions without hesitation. However, he Dong was the son of Ling Xiaotian’s old comrade. Moreover, he was the son of his former class monitor, who had saved his life. That was a different story. As expected, Ling Xiaotian said to Xia ruofei with a troubled expression,” “Xiao Xia, I know that he Dong is in the wrong regarding this matter. I’ve already severely criticized him in the meeting just now. I can ask him to apologize to you sincerely. Firing him ... Isn’t that a little too serious?” Xia ruofei revealed a faint smile and said,” “Uncle Ling, an apology doesn’t always work. At least this time, I hope to see the sincerity of Ling Ji restaurant.” Xia ruofei paused for a moment before he continued,” “And ... I don’t think firing him is a serious matter. The incident this time has already made it clear that he doesn’t care about your company’s interests at all. He’s acting recklessly for his own selfish reasons and has set up obstacles for this cooperation. I don’t think any company will be able to accept such a person. ” Ling Xiaotian smiled bitterly and said,” “Little Xia, he Dong was just being silly ... Can you be the bigger person and forgive him this once? Or can you change to another condition?” Ling Qingxue saw that her father was pleading with Xia ruofei and could not help but frown.” “Dad, ruofei is right. The company has its own rules. Based on what he Dong did, he should have been fired long ago!” He Dong also became anxious when he heard that and called out,” “Ling Qingxue, what do you mean by this? When did I break the company’s rules? In that situation, he didn’t have a test report and didn’t have his own vegetable base. I asked a few questions and even hit him. How could I agree to sign this contract?” Ling Qingxue pouted and said,” “Don’t say those Grand words. You know what you’re thinking!” “Qingxue, can you just stop talking ...” Ling Xiaotian said helplessly. At first, he had wanted to match Ling Qingxue with he Dong, but now he saw that he Dong seemed like a piece of mud that couldn’t be supported on a wall. Moreover, Ling Qingxue and he were like fire and water. Ling Xiaotian’s little thoughts had long faded. However, he Dong was the only son of the former class monitor, so he definitely wouldn’t kick him out of the class. Thus, he muttered to himself for a while before saying,” “Xiao Xia, can you just do this for uncle Ling’s sake? He Dong, he ...” “Uncle Ling, Qingxue has told me about the relationship between he Dong and your family.” Xia ruofei said calmly,”but I’ll still say the same thing. We’re all adults. We should be prepared to bear the consequences of our actions.” Xia ruofei glanced at he Dong and ignored his venomous gaze. He then said to Ling Xiaotian,” “Besides, we’re already giving uncle Ling face by sitting down and talking today. If I didn’t give him face, my partner would not be Xi Jiang Yue club but Ming Hao restaurant! At that time, I had enough reason to do so, and I believe that the Ming Hao restaurant would be very willing to cooperate with me!” Ling Xiaotian’s expression changed slightly. He knew very well what it would mean for Ling Ji restaurant if Xia ruofei and Ming Hao restaurant were to work together. Xia ruofei stood up and said,” “Uncle Ling, please wait a moment. I have something to show you ...” Xia ruofei then walked up the stairs. Ling Qingxue looked at Xia ruofei’s back, her eyes filled with tenderness. After this reunion after so many years, she realized that the image of Xia ruofei in her heart had not faded at all. On the contrary, her girlish feelings seemed to have been elevated again. It was no longer a hazy love. In comparison, in Ling Qingxue’s mind, the ugly he Dong was not even worth a piece of *** when compared to Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei quickly returned with a document and handed it to Ling Xiaotian.” “Uncle Ling, you can open it and take a look.” Ling Xiaotian asked in confusion,” “What is this?” Xia ruofei smiled and said,” “I signed a cooperation agreement with West River Moon Club, but because my company is still registered, this is only a draft agreement. It will take some time for the official contract to be signed.” “This ... I don’t think it’s appropriate?” Ling Xiaotian said hesitantly. “It’s fine. ” Xia ruofei said with a smile. Then, he opened the document and took out the agreement. He flipped through two pages and passed it to Ling Xiaotian. He pointed at one of the terms and said,” “I asked President Zheng of West River moon to add this. Do you still think I didn’t give you face?” Ling Xiaotian’s eyes narrowed, because he saw an exclusion clause on it, which was that the Taoyuan vegetables, which was the agent of the West River Moon Club, could not have any form of cooperation with the Minghao restaurant and its associated companies. Looking at this clause, Ling Xiaotian couldn’t help but be slightly moved. That’s right! The other party was definitely full of sincerity. He had already done it to this extent, yet he still dared to say that he was not giving him face? Although Ling Xiaotian knew that this was mostly for Ling Qingxue, Ling Qingxue represented Ling Ji F & B! Ling Xiaotian said with emotion,” “Little Xia, I didn’t expect you to be so broad – minded! On behalf of Ling Ji F & B, I thank you ...” Ling Qingxue, who was standing at the side, also saw this clause. She knew that Xia ruofei had added this clause for her sake. She could not help but feel sweet in her heart. Xia ruofei smiled but did not say anything. Ling Xiaotian knew what Xia ruofei meant. He sighed and said,” “Xiao Xia, let me go back and consider this matter ...” Ling Xiaotian obviously knew that Xia ruofei would not give in, so he did not plead for he Dong. However, he couldn’t make up his mind, so he could only put the negotiations on hold. Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.” “Sure, as long as you agree to my only condition, all the cooperation can start immediately, and it will be according to the plan that I have discussed with Qingxue before!” He Dong saw that Xia ruofei refused to give in and wanted to kick him out of Ling Ji restaurant. The resentment in his heart grew. He glared at Xia ruofei with red eyes as if he wanted to eat him up. However, Xia ruofei ignored him and took a sip of the tea. Ling Xiaotian sighed to himself and stood up,” “Little Xia, we’ll go back first then ...” “Alright, I’ll send you guys off!” Xia ruofei said with a warm smile. Ling Qingxue wanted to stay for dinner, but she couldn’t bring herself to say it. Since Ling Xiaotian was here, Xia ruofei naturally could not brazenly invite Ling Qingxue for dinner. So, everyone left the house with their own thoughts and came to the villa’s courtyard. Before Ling Xiaotian got into the car, Xia ruofei said meaningfully,” “Uncle Ling, I personally think ... You can report this matter to your former squad leader. I believe that a veteran who is willing to sacrifice his own life for his comrades must have his own principles and bottom line in his heart!” He Dong’s heart trembled when he heard Xia ruofei’s words. His face was ashen. He knew his father too well ... Ling Xiaotian also nodded his head thoughtfully and said,” “I understand. Thank you, little Xia!” Ling Qingxue turned back to look at Xia ruofei reluctantly before she got into the Mercedes – Benz. Xia ruofei waved at the car and watched them leave.
