Chapter 931: Meeting an “old friend” in a foreign land (1)

Translator: 549690339

Tan Lili emphasized the word “vacation” with a sense of superiority on her face. It seemed that “vacation” in Australia was much more advanced than “vacation” in Australia.

When tan Lili’s boyfriend, Zheng Peng, saw Lin Qiao for the first time, he couldn’t help but be amazed.

In all fairness, tan Lili’s appearance was above average. Compared to girls her age, her body was clearly more mature. Her curvy figure was enough to make many men fascinated.

However, she was not as good as Lin Qiao.

Although Lin Qiao didn’t put on any makeup, her natural beauty and well – proportioned figure were much more charming than tan Lili ‘s. In particular, her elegant and refined temperament made tan Lili, who had heavy makeup on, pale in comparison.

Zheng Peng’s eyes were a little hot, and he said enthusiastically,””Hello, beauty! Welcome to Australia! I’m very familiar with the Hunter Valley. If you don’t mind, we can play together!”

Tan Lili was a little dissatisfied with her boyfriend’s behavior. She gave Zheng Peng a sideways glance and said,””You damn ghost! I’m not enough! You still want to get Lin Qiao?”

Zheng Peng suddenly showed an embarrassed look and laughed,””Lili, what are you thinking? Isn’t Lin Qiao your classmate? I’m considered half a host in the Hunter Valley, what’s wrong with entertaining your classmates?”

Lin Qiao looked at Xia ruofei uneasily. She was afraid that Xia ruofei would be unhappy. Seeing that Xia ruofei was standing at the side with no expression, she quickly said, “It’s fine, it’s fine. We’ll be leaving the Hunter Valley tomorrow.” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei looked on coldly from the side and could not help but frown. This couple was really weird. The woman’s vanity was written all over her face, and the man’s behavior when he saw a beautiful woman was even worse. He did not even bother to hide his girlfriend beside him.

It’s really ‘if we’re not family, we won’t enter the same door’!

Just as Xia ruofei was about to leave with Lin Qiao, tan Lili looked at Xia ruofei again and asked with a smile,””Lin Qiao, you haven’t introduced me to your boyfriend yet! What does this handsome guy do?”

Before Lin Qiao could say anything, Xia ruofei smiled and said,””Hello tan Lili, my name is Xia ruofei. I have a small company in China.”

Tan Lili was not surprised when Xia ruofei said that he had a company in China.

After all, those who could travel abroad must have some money. They couldn’t be ordinary workers, right? After all, the cheapest discounted ticket for the two of them would cost more than ten to twenty thousand Yuan.

Of course, tan Lili’s judgment was that Xia ruofei’s company must be a small one. Although she had just graduated from high school, she was used to judging people by their clothing brands. Xia ruofei, who was worth less than a thousand Yuan in total, did not look like a rich man.

Therefore, tan Lili thought that Xia ruofei was just pretending to be strong. In order to make his girlfriend happy, he took Lin Qiao on an overseas trip.

Zheng Peng, who was beside tan Lili, saw Lin Qiao snuggling up to Xia ruofei like a little bird and felt a burst of jealousy.

“Xiao Xia, what business does your company in China do?” he asked with a smile.

Zheng Peng was only two years older than Xia ruofei. He was an old cow that was eating young grass when he was with tan Lili. However, he called Xia ruofei “little Xia” casually to show that he was superior to others.

Xia ruofei’s mind was very calm now. He didn’t want to deal with this pair of weirdos at first, but considering that tan Lili was Lin Qiao’s classmate, Xia ruofei felt that he might put Lin Qiao in a difficult position if he just left.

Xia ruofei looked at Zheng Peng and said,””My company deals with agricultural products.”

Zheng Peng’s eyes flashed with a trace of contempt. In his eyes, this was obviously a very “low – end” business. He even secretly speculated that the company Xia ruofei was talking about was not a retail department that sold grain oil, right?

Zheng Peng felt that the possibility was very high. It was easy to register a company now. It was said that even the registered capital in China could be abandoned. It was a pure leather Company, and the application was applied for in a few days.

Thinking of this, Zheng Peng said,””It’s not easy to do domestic agricultural products! It’s not like Australia, which has modern agriculture. ”

Xia ruofei smiled and ignored Zheng Peng.

Unexpectedly, Zheng Peng became more and more enthusiastic. He glanced at Lin Qiao and said with a smile,””Speaking of which, we can be considered half peers! Our family owns a winery in Hunter Valley, and we specialize in wine! However, this winery was also bought by my dad for fun. It’s mainly for business friends who want to drink more conveniently. Our family winery produces wine. ”

At this moment, tan Lili seemed to have forgotten her boyfriend’s coveting of Lin Qiao. She said in a sweet voice,””Zheng Peng, our dad is really generous! A few million Australian dollars just for fun? I heard that our winery is about to cooperate with the largest Golden Oak winery in the Hunter Valley area. I’m sure our future development prospects will be good, right?”

Zheng Peng couldn’t help but show a smug look, but he also secretly complained that he had only hooked up with tan Lili two months ago. In fact, he was just playing with her. Now, tan Lili was “our Father” and “our winery”, as if she was the young lady. Zheng Peng couldn’t help but roll his eyes.

In fact, Zheng Peng was a little tired of playing with tan Lili. After returning to Australia, he rarely contacted her. However, after tan Lili filled in her college application, she contacted him many times, saying that she wanted to come to Australia to see him.

Zheng Peng hadn’t had a girlfriend for a while, and since tan Lili was willing to send him that thing from a thousand miles away, he agreed to it. It was only ten to twenty thousand Yuan for the plane ticket.

After tan Lili came to Australia, Zheng Peng didn’t dare to bring her home. He directly arranged for her to stay in a hotel in a nearby town. During the few days that tan Lili was in Australia, she mainly accompanied Zheng Peng to do those things in the hotel. Occasionally, she would pester Zheng Peng to accompany her for a tour.

Of course, the vain tan Lili would never mention this in front of her classmates.

Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao looked at each other and couldn’t help but smile.

At Xia ruofei’s level, he did not even bother to compete with others in terms of wealth, let alone the fact that the other party was just a short – sighted rich second generation.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”then I wish President Zheng a good fortune!” Tan Lili, we still have something to do, so we’ll be leaving first! You guys take your time ...”

Lin Qiao also waved at tan Lili with a smile. Then, the two of them turned around and prepared to leave.

“Wait!” Zheng Peng said quickly.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but frown. This guy was too insensible, which made him very unhappy.

Zheng Peng seemed to ignore Xia ruofei, the “little boss.” He said to Lin Qiao with a confident smile on his face,”Lin Qiao, you and Lili are classmates, so you also took the college entrance examination this year? Are you interested in studying in Australia? I still have quite a few connections here ...”

Zheng Peng stared at Lin Qiao after he finished speaking. He was secretly proud of himself. I don’t believe you won’t be moved!

In Zheng Peng’s opinion, once the girls in China heard that there was an opportunity to study abroad or immigrate, all the reserved pretense would be removed and they would become very enthusiastic. As long as he used some tricks later on, supplemented by money, it would be easy to get into bed with her.

He had used this trick many times, and it worked every time.

Tan Lili’s eyes flashed with jealousy. Her academic performance was poor, and she didn’t even pass the college entrance examination. After coming to Australia, she had mentioned to Zheng Peng several times that she wanted to study in Australia, but Zheng Peng had always avoided her.

She didn’t expect that Zheng Peng would be in a hurry to help Lin Qiao study abroad today. How could she not be jealous?

“Thank you, President Zheng, but I don’t have such plans for the time being,” said Lin Qiao.

Then, Lin Qiao pulled Xia ruofei’s arm and the two of them walked out of the attraction.

Zheng Peng didn’t give up. He even left tan Lili and caught up with her. He smiled and said,””Lin Qiao, don’t be in a hurry to refuse! The opportunity to study in Australia ...”

“I say, how can you be like this?” Xia ruofei finally couldn’t hold it in anymore.”Qiao’ er already said that she’s not interested! The opportunity to study in Australia is so good, you can give it to whoever you want!”

“Little Xia, how can you say that!” Zheng Peng’s face darkened as he said,”how can you be so selfish? Lin Qiao is still young and doesn’t know how precious the opportunity to study abroad is. Don’t you know it too? I think you’re afraid that Lin Qiao will break up with you after she studies abroad, so you didn’t let me continue!”

Xia ruofei was so angry that he laughed. He did not know what to say to this weirdo.

Seeing Xia ruofei’s stunned look, Zheng Peng thought that Xia ruofei was rendered speechless by his rebuttal. He couldn’t help but show a trace of pride and continued to say to Lin Qiao,””Lin Qiao, the university education in Australia is much better than that in China. In the future, you will have the opportunity to obtain permanent residence rights or even citizenship. If you can stay, the social welfare protection here is much better than that in China! I think you should think about it carefully. Don’t miss such a rare opportunity!”

Lin Qiao frowned when Zheng Peng was scolding Xia ruofei. She looked at Zheng Peng coldly and said,””Are you done? I’ll go and accompany tan Lili after I’m done! Goodbye, President Zheng!”

“AI! Lin Qiao, think about it ...”

As Zheng Peng spoke, he reached out his hand to pull Lin Qiao. At this time, a hand reached out from the side and grabbed his wrist tightly like an iron hoop. He immediately cried out in pain.

At this moment, Zheng Peng saw that it was Xia ruofei who had grabbed him. He immediately shouted,””It hurts! Let me go!”

Xia ruofei stared into Zheng Peng’s eyes coldly and said,””I’m warning you, don’t pester Qiao’ er anymore, or I won’t let you off so easily next time!”

After that, Xia ruofei gently pushed and then let go of his hand. Xia ruofei’s light push made Zheng Peng feel as if a car was pulling him. He suddenly took a few steps back and almost fell on his butt.

He looked at his wrist again, and a red handprint was clearly visible.
