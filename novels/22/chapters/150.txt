“Sis Wu, there’s one more thing I need your help with ...” Xia ruofei said.”It’s the villa that I’m renting now. You know that the entire farm is surrounded by it, so I want to buy it. Can you help me ask your relatives when you’re free?” When Wu Liqian’s relatives had first migrated overseas, they had been planning to sell the villa. It was only after Wu Liqian had spoken to them that they had rented it to Xia ruofei. Wu Liqian laughed and said,”you’re going to run out of villas so soon?” It seems that business has been good recently ...” Xia ruofei chuckled in embarrassment. “No problem! When I’m done in the morning, I’ll call and ask when I get home in the afternoon. It shouldn’t be a big problem. ” Wu Liqian said. “Alright! Then I’ll thank sis Wu in advance!” Xia ruofei grinned. After sending Wu Liqian to the hospital, Xia ruofei returned to the ward. Cao tieshu and his wife naturally said many words of thanks, especially Cao tieshu, who expressed that he would definitely work hard on the farm and not let Xia ruofei down. Xia ruofei stayed for a while before leaving the hospital. Before he left, he told Cao tieshu to take care of his wife and to call him if anything happened. After leaving the hospital, Xia ruofei drove back to the pharmacy where he had bought the nutritional supplements. He decided to help Cao tieshu’s wife by telling her that she had injured her bones. As the saying goes, it takes a hundred days for a bone to be injured. In addition, their son was studying at a University in another city. He would probably leave in a dozen days. At that time, it would definitely affect Cao tieshu’s work. When they were buying nutritional products, Xia ruofei saw that this pharmacy sold a kind of ointment for bruises and injuries. It was not a regular ointment, but a paste – like ointment. He was planning to buy some, and then mix in a very small amount of petal solution, which would presumably be of great help to the recovery of his injuries. Xia ruofei would provide ginseng, Phoebe zhennan, and the red Arowana fish pond with a small amount of petal solution every once in a while. As long as he left a little of the petal solution and added it to the ointment, he would not waste the petals of the exotic flower. Moreover, this would only help with the recovery of broken bones. It would also reduce the recovery time appropriately and not easily arouse suspicion. After buying the ointment, Xia ruofei drove back to the farm. It was almost noon and Lin Qiao was already up. She had heard from Hu Zi’s mother that Xia ruofei had gone to the temple fair. Hence, when she saw Xia ruofei, Lin Qiao complained,””Brother ruofei, why didn’t you bring me along when you went to the temple fair ...” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”who asked you to be so lazy?” It’s already late in the morning and you’re still not up!” “I don’t care! You can take me there in the afternoon!” Lin Qiao pouted and said. “Alright, alright, alright! “I’ll go again in the afternoon ...”Xia ruofei said affectionately. Then, he gave Lin Qiao some trinkets that he bought from the temple fair and went upstairs with the ointment for bruises and injuries that he bought from the pharmacy. After returning to his room, Xia ruofei carefully locked the door and summoned the spirit map scroll from his palm. He brought the ointment into the spirit map space. He poured about a spoonful of the flower petal solution into the ointment for bruises and injuries. After stirring it well, he placed the ointment in the space. Then, he took a wooden bucket and a few bowls from the original space, along with a few bags of milk powder that he had bought in the morning, and entered the new space from the original space. The puppies were still obediently staying in the basket, their spirits looking very good. Obviously, the environment with rich spiritual energy in the space made them very comfortable. The black puppy that was left alone outside was originally sickly and on the verge of dying, but now it was much more energetic and could even stand up, stumbling around in the medium. When Xia ruofei saw the group of puppies, he suddenly remembered something. When he was buying the dogs, the owner said that these puppies were born from the mating of boss Chen’s Wolf dog and his mother dog. Didn’t that mean that the wolfdog that bit Cao tieshu’s wife and was killed by the villagers, and the main culprit that caused the series of events after that, was the Father of these little guys? Xia ruofei was also a little shocked. There were really no stories without coincidences in this world! After sighing a little, Xia ruofei took half a bucket of water from the spatial spirit pool from the stream and poured in the milk powder. Then, Xia ruofei dropped a few drops of the flower petal solution in and mixed them well. Since the things in the interspace would not go bad, Xia ruofei decided to make a big bucket of milk powder. Then, he scooped a few bowls of milk and placed them on the ground. He waved at the black puppy. The puppy was probably hungry as well. As soon as it smelled the milk, it immediately ran over and gulped down the milk. Xia ruofei carried the puppies out of the basket one by one. They also rushed to the bowls of milk. They looked much stronger than the little black dog. The little black dog, who was drinking milk in big gulps, saw the puppies running over and immediately barked at them. Xia ruofei was happy when he saw it. This little guy was the weakest, but he still wanted to protect his food. He looked quite fierce. The puppies hesitated for a moment, but the aroma of the milk was obviously very tempting to them, so they immediately rushed forward together. The little black dog was not afraid of the six dogs that were much stronger than it. It immediately barked and rushed over. “Hey, hey, hey, harmony is the most important thing, harmony is the most important thing ...” Xia ruofei quickly called out as he carried the little black dog. Then, he scooped up a big bowl of milk and walked far away with the black puppy in his arms. He placed the bowl of milk on the ground and put the black puppy down. Xia ruofei said,”little guy, you’re full of fighting spirit!” But a wise man knows when to retreat. You can’t beat them now ... Drink up, drink up. This is special treatment. Only the sick and wounded can enjoy this in the Army!” Naturally, the black puppy did not understand Xia ruofei’s words. However, it was now far away from the other puppies and there was a big bowl of milk here. It shook its head and lowered its head to drink big mouthfuls. Xia ruofei looked at the little black dog with interest. At first, he had listened to the shop owner and thought that the little dog had been bullied because it was weak since it was young. However, after seeing the scene just now, he felt that it was the exact opposite. The little black dog was full of fighting spirit and charged forward fearlessly even when it was obviously at a disadvantage. Perhaps it was because of this that it was repeatedly bullied ... Xia ruofei suddenly had a wicked idea. If he put the black puppy in the original space, the six puppies here would only grow for a few days, while the black puppy would grow for a few months. He wondered if it would be interesting to put it back in the original space. Xia ruofei quickly decided to put this idea into practice. Among the seven puppies, Xia ruofei had a preference for black puppy. Although it was so sick that it could not even walk steadily, Xia ruofei liked its stubborn eyes and unyielding spirit. Black puppy was still happily drinking the milk in its bowl, not knowing that it had become Xia ruofei’s main training target.
