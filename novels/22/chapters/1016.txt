Chapter 1017: A one – headed abalone’s stunning appearance (1)

Translator: 549690339

Hengfeng group’s headquarters was in Hong Kong. In the early years, seafood trading was one of its main businesses. Today, the seafood trading company under Hengfeng group was still one of the Giants in the high – end seafood field in Hong Kong. It had a flagship store in the famous Defu daoxi.

Guo Song was the flagship store manager of Hengfeng seafood in Defu daoxi. He had nearly 20 years of experience in the sea products industry and was definitely an expert in the identification of high – end seafood. That was why MA Xiong had sent him to the three mountains.

Of course, Guo Song was accompanied by an employee of the Hengfeng auction house who was in charge of publicity.

MA Xiong had told Guo Song before they left, so he was very polite.”Mr. Xia, you go ahead! Give me a call whenever you’re free, I’ll be waiting in the hotel. ”

“Okay, Mr. Guo, let’s talk when we meet!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

After Xia ruofei hung up, Tang He asked with a smile,””RUO Fei, what’s the matter? Then you can go! You don’t need to worry about me. ”

Xia ruofei smiled.”It’s nothing urgent. Our company just launched a batch of dried abalones and we want to entrust Hong Kong’s Hengfeng auction house to help us auction them. So ... Their staff is here to do some preliminary work. Mr. Tang, let me send you back to the hotel first! There’s still time there!”

Tang He showed a surprised look and asked,””Dry abalone auction? Doesn’t the Hengfeng auction house specialize in antique calligraphy and paintings?”

Xia ruofei smiled.”I have a personal relationship with Chairman MA of the Hengfeng group. I’m just helping out as a friend.”

“MA Xiong?” he asked. Tang He was even more surprised.”I didn’t expect you to be friends with Chairman MA!” I even attended a salon with him in Hong Kong!” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei smiled.”It’s a long story. It’s a coincidence that I met Chairman MA.”

“Even if you have a personal relationship with Chairman MA, the dried abalones that can be auctioned at Hengfeng auction house should be of very high quality, right?” Tang He said with a smile.

Tang He could guess that Xia ruofei wanted to sell this batch of dried abalones through the auction. He must be hoping to use this opportunity to expand the brand influence of paradise Corporation. However, if the product was not up to standard, it would often backfire.

Moreover, the Paradise company had always been a high – Quality company, which could be seen from the Paradise brand vegetable series, so Tang He was also very interested in it.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”that’s true. Most of my dried abalone can reach the standard of a one – Head abalone. Why?” Are you also interested in abalone, Mr. Tang?”

It was as if Tang He didn’t hear Xia ruofei’s words. His entire person became a little sluggish.

After a long while, he asked in shock,”a one – headed abalone?” Or a batch of one – headed abalones? RUO Fei, is there something wrong with my ears?”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.”Mr. Tang, you’re so healthy. Why would your ears have problems?” he asked. You didn’t hear wrong, it’s indeed a one – headed abalone!”

“Let’s go!” Tang He immediately said,”I’ll go with you to the farm and see your one – headed abalone!”

As the saying goes, it is difficult to buy a two – headed abalone with a thousand gold coins. Two – headed abalones are already so precious, let alone one – headed abalones.

Like MA Xiong, although Tang He was a billionaire, one – Head abalone was a treasure that could not be enjoyed even if one had the money. Tang He happened to be a glutton, so he couldn’t help but be tempted when he heard that.

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment, then immediately said,””Alright! Then we welcome you to the farm as a guest!”

“Let’s go now!” Tang He said.

Many people would return to their true nature and become more and more like children as they grew older.

Tang He was like a child who couldn’t wait to get his toy.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.”Alright, I’ll call the Hengfeng group. Let’s go back to the farm now!”

Xia ruofei drove the Knight XV off – Road vehicle and led the way. Tang He followed closely in a Bentley. There was also a black Mercedes – Benz with Tang He’s personal bodyguards in it.

The three cars drove in a single file, speeding in the direction of Taoyuan farm.

On the way, Xia ruofei gave Guo Song a call and told him to head to the farm immediately. He even told him the exact address of the farm.

Tao Yuan farm’s reputation in the southeast province, especially in Sanshan city, was growing. Various regularly updated mapping software and navigation software had already marked the exact location of Tao Yuan farm. Guo Song and the others took the car from Hengfeng group’s Sanshan office and could easily find Tao Yuan farm by using the car navigation.

After calling Guo Song, Xia ruofei muttered to himself as he drove. He thought that the precious one – headed abalone must have been carefully frozen, otherwise it would not make sense.

After the abalones were sealed and packed, they had always been stored in the spirit map space. It was not difficult to take them out of the refrigerator secretly, but when the abalones were in a room temperature state, it would be easy to arouse suspicion.

Fortunately, there was a large refrigerator in the Knight XV off – Road vehicle.

Xia ruofei did not stop the car. He used his mental power to open the door of the car refrigerator in the back and turned the power of the refrigerator to the maximum so that the temperature could be reduced in the shortest time.

With Xia ruofei’s current spiritual power, it was not a problem for him to retrieve an object of average weight from a short distance. Therefore, it was not difficult for him to do this.
