Chapter 1029: Jaded skin cream mass production test (2)

Translator: 549690339

While Xia Qing was processing the medicinal ingredients, Xia ruofei found a timer, a thermometer, and other necessary tools.

Xia Qing gave Xia ruofei a questioning look. Xia ruofei nodded and said,””Let’s start!”

Xia Qing immediately put the required herbs into the claypot and poured in the spatial spirit pond water.

The spatial spirit pool water used to brew the ointment was stored in a measuring cylinder with scales carved on it. All the steps of brewing the medicine were completed by Xia Qing while Xia ruofei meticulously recorded the data.

” 60 grams of honeysuckle, 30 grams of pearl powder, 40 grams of white Poria Cocos ...”

“Add 1 liter of water ...”

Xia ruofei paid close attention to the process of Xia Qing brewing the medicine while his fingers flew on the keyboard of his laptop, recording every single process.

In order to achieve mass production, the first step was to record the entire process of brewing the medicine, every step, every dose, and other details. Then, they would analyze how to achieve automatic production through a computer – controlled production line.

This was what Xia ruofei was doing now.

The jaded skin ointment did not use many types of medicinal herbs, but the process of decocting was very particular, including the order of adding the medicinal herbs, timing, and so on. If one of the steps went wrong, there would be no way to decoct the real jaded skin ointment in the end.

Therefore, when Xia Qing was boiling the medicine, Xia ruofei was also very busy. Whenever Xia Qing didn’t put in any medicinal material, Xia ruofei would record the time and use a thermometer to measure the temperature.

This was because a computer could not control the heat like a human. It could only control it through some fixed parameters.

The Jade skin cream was roughly divided into three steps.

The first step was to mix some of the herbs with the spirit pool water and boil it. During this period, a few other herbs would be gradually added. At the same time, after the spirit pool water gradually evaporated, water would be added. This process would require adding water about three times.

The second step was to take out the medicinal soup, throw away the dregs, pour the medicinal soup back into the clay pot, and continue to heat it. During this process, there were still the last two medicinal herbs that had been ground into powder to be added. While adding, they also needed to stir at the same time, and the medicinal soup would become more and more viscous.

The third step was to stir it while using fire to boil it. The water would continue to evaporate, and the final product would be a brown paste with a unique fragrance.

If these three steps were controlled by humans, it wouldn’t be difficult to cook one portion as long as they didn’t get distracted and controlled the fire properly.

However, it would be much more complicated if it was done using a computer.

It was like a simple table in a web page. If it was drawn by hand, it might only take one or two minutes. However, if it was implemented with code, it would take dozens of lines, and the structure was very complicated.

However, it might be faster to draw a single table manually, but it would definitely be faster to draw ten or a hundred tables using a computer. This was because the same code could be copied and pasted, and it was completely a batch operation.

This was also the logic behind the assembly line.

If humans were to simmer it slowly, it might take far less time to brew one or two portions than to research and mass produce it. However, once hundreds or thousands of portions were produced, even if people were exhausted to death, it would be impossible to be faster than machines.

As long as the program was well – tuned, except for a few steps that required human intervention, the rest of the procedures would be completed by the computer in an orderly manner as long as the buttons were pressed. There would be no mistakes or distractions.

If these three steps of decocting the jaded skin ointment were to be subdivided, there were twenty to thirty steps, including each addition of materials, adding water, stirring ... Each step required time, temperature, and other parameters to control the heat, which was naturally quite complicated.

As time passed, Xia Qing was very focused on controlling the fire. Slowly, a sweet fragrance began to spread. Xia Qing stared at the ointment at the bottom of the earthenware pot. Finally, he put on the heat – resistant gloves provided by Xia ruofei and took the earthenware pot off the charcoal stove.

“Master, the first batch of jaded skin ointment has been made!” Xia Qing said respectfully.

Xia ruofei nodded and recorded the temperature he had just measured with a thermometer on the computer. Then he said,””Check the quality!”

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing immediately responded.

After Xia Qing carefully examined the Jade skin cream, she raised her head and said,””Master, this Jade skin cream should be of high grade. It should be at least of middle to high grade!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”very good, continue to make the next portion!”

Since it was data recording, it could not be done only once. It needed to be compared with different data to minimize the probability of error.

Xia Qing was only a spirit puppet, so she didn’t feel tired. Xia ruofei, on the other hand, was as strong as an ox. He was only recording the data and parameters at the side, so naturally, he was not tired. Thus, the master and servant began the second experiment without stopping.

Of course, Xia Qing’s jaded skin ointment couldn’t be wasted. Xia ruofei asked Xia Qing to scrape it all off and store it in a clean small porcelain bottle.

After washing the claypot, Xia Qing immediately followed Xia ruofei’s instructions and repeated the process of decocting the jaded skin ointment. Xia ruofei naturally recorded all the data during the whole process.

Time flowed 30 times slower in the Archean realm than the outside world. Hence, Xia ruofei had enough time to do this.

He and Xia Qing had done a total of ten sets of experiments, and the data of each set had been recorded in detail.

Xia Qing was more skilled in brewing the jaded skin ointment than Xia ruofei, so she was naturally successful in all ten attempts. Three of them produced the best quality, and the other seven were basically of superior quality. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Xia ruofei noted down the quality of the finished product after each set of data.

After completing 10 sets of experiments, Xia ruofei closed his laptop and patted Xia Qing’s shoulder with a smile.””That’s all for today! You’ve worked hard ...”

“Master, you’re too polite ...” Xia Qing bowed slightly.

“You can continue with your work!” Xia ruofei said,”I’ll follow up on the mass production of the jaded skin cream. You don’t have to worry about it!”

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing said.

Xia Qing returned to the mountain and sea realm to continue cutting succulent plants, while Xia ruofei brought his laptop back to his room in the outside world.

He walked to the computer desk and plugged in the laptop’s power. After working in the Archean realm for so long, the laptop’s battery was almost out.

Xia ruofei noticed another detail.”In the Archean realm, laptops operated according to the time in the space. Hence, half a day had already passed in the system while only a few minutes had passed in the outside world.

Of course, after the laptop was connected to the room’s WiFi, it quickly connected to the internet to check the time.

Xia ruofei sat down, turned on his computer, and lit a cigarette. After taking a deep puff, he blew out a smoke ring and started to analyze the data he had recorded today.

It was naturally impossible for the data parameters of ten sets of experiments to be exactly the same. After all, the control of the fire was more of a feeling. Moreover, the fire power of the furnace could not be completely balanced, and the heating speed and so on were also different.

Xia ruofei re – established a table and entered ten sets of data for comparison. With the three sets of experimental data that made the best jaded skin cream as the basis, he also referred to the other sets of experimental data and analyzed a set of parameters that he thought was the most reasonable.

Then, Xia ruofei’s brain worked quickly. In his mind, the steps of making the jaded skin ointment were constantly broken up and combined. He analyzed which steps should be the most optimal for mass production.

As he thought, he typed quickly on the laptop’s keyboard.

Time passed by unknowingly. When Xia ruofei heard Hu Zi’s mother calling him for dinner, he realized that he had already constructed half of the entire production process.

“Godma, I understand. I’ll be right down!” Xia ruofei replied loudly.

Then, he rubbed his sore temples and revealed a satisfied smile. He muttered to himself,””It seems that if I work overtime at night, I will at least be able to prepare the theory. As for whether it will succeed or not, I will have to go to the pharmaceutical factory to test it out!”

Xia ruofei saved the document, closed his laptop, and went downstairs for dinner.
