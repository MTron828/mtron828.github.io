Chapter 665: Tian Huilan’s support (2)

Then, she realized that she had not poured Xia ruofei any tea. She stuck out her tongue and hurriedly took out a blanket and tea leaves from the cabinet.

At this time, Xiao Mei had completely lost the steadiness of a staff member beside the provincial Party leader, which showed how attractive the jaded skin cream was to women!

Tian Huilan’s office.

When she saw Xia ruofei enter, Tian Huilan put down the documents that she was signing and stood up with a smile.””Little Xia is here! Come sit down and talk!”

“Good day, Secretary Tian!” Xia ruofei bowed and greeted her. Then, he followed Tian Huilan to the sofa in the guest area and sat down.

At this moment, Xiao Mei knocked on the door with a cup of hot tea. She had returned to her normal calm expression and said to Xia ruofei in a low voice,””President Xia, please have some tea!”

Then, she walked over to Tian Huilan’s desk and took her teacup. After filling it with hot water, she brought it to the reception area and gently placed it on the coffee table before quietly leaving the office.

After Xiao Mei left, Xia ruofei took out the gifts he had prepared for Tian Huilan, including three portions of jaded skin cream and two taels of top – grade Da Hong Pao.

Ever since he found out that Xia Qing could also make Da Hong Pao, Xia ruofei did not treasure the few tea leaves he had left. This time, he also generously took out two taels.

Xia ruofei believed that with Xia Qing’s ability, and the tea trees that he had taken care of for so long, the Da Hong Pao he made would not be any worse than li Zhifu ‘s.

“Secretary Tian, this is a small gift for you.” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“You little summer!” Tian Huilan smiled and said,”I’ve never accepted other people’s gifts, but I can’t reject yours! Thank you! You’re so thoughtful ...”

......

Tian Huilan was very fond of the jaded skin ointment. Whether it was for her own use or for giving it away, it was quite good. The jaded skin ointment, which couldn’t be bought with money, had become a hot cake in the upper – Class women’s circle. Many people couldn’t even get a portion of it no matter how hard they tried!

Tian Huilan very naturally kept Xia ruofei’s gift under the coffee table, then revealed a kind smile and said,””Little Xia, Huixin has mentioned your matter to me before. This is a great thing that benefits the country and the people. I support you unconditionally!”

“Thank you, Secretary Tian!” Xia ruofei said happily.

Yesterday, when he had called Tian Huilan, he had roughly explained the situation. He didn’t expect Tian Huilan to directly express her support.

Officials at Tian Huilan’s level were usually very particular about changing the subject, and wouldn’t make a dead end.

From this, it could be seen that Tian Huilan had a different opinion of Xia ruofei.

Following that, Xia ruofei reported the situation of the heart – nourishing soup, as well as the peach blossom company’s establishment of the pharmaceutical company and the preliminary drug testing to Tian Huilan.

Finally, Xia ruofei said,”Secretary Tian, the person in charge of our pharmaceutical research Institute has brought the report to the capital city to apply for the approval of the new drug. According to the regulations, our Chinese medicine preparation can be directly submitted to the State Drug Administration for approval. However, under normal circumstances, the first review work will still be completed by the provincial Drug Administration, so we still need your strong support!” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Tian Huilan smiled.”Little Xia, I’ve already spoken to Deputy Chief he kun from the provincial Food and Drug Administration, who is in charge of the drug approval work. Within the scope of the rules, Deputy Chief he will give you the care you deserve.”

“I’m really grateful!” Xia ruofei said happily.

Tian Huilan smiled and said,”comrade he kun is the director of the Sanshan Food and Drug Administration. He can be considered my old subordinate. He was just promoted to the Deputy Director of the provincial Food and Drug Administration last year. He’s in charge of drug approval, so you can look for him directly.”

“I understand,” Xia ruofei said.”Thank you, Secretary Tian.”

Tian Huilan passed a piece of paper that she had written beforehand to Xia ruofei and said,””This is bureau chief he’s contact information. You should find him as soon as possible and discuss some specific things with him! By the way, old he has been working in the Food and Drug Administration for many years, and he’s familiar with the people in the State Food and Drug Administration. You can ask him to help coordinate with the higher – ups, so that the progress can be accelerated and we can enter the preliminary review process as soon as possible. ”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei carefully kept the note.

After they finished talking, Xia ruofei was about to leave when Tian Huilan suddenly started to talk about private matters.

“Xiao Xia, have you been in contact with Youyou recently?” Tian Huilan asked in a seemingly casual manner.

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment before he said,”the last time aunt Huixin brought Huanhuan over, I met Lu You twice.” What’s wrong, Secretary Tian?”

“I feel that she has been a little depressed recently. I don’t know if it’s just my imagination ...” Tian Huilan frowned and said,”let’s not talk about this. Xiao Xia, if you have time, contact Youyou more often. You young people have more common topics to talk about.” This daughter of mine ... She’s always been hiding her thoughts and won’t say them out loud. Sigh ...”

“Sure, I will,” Xia ruofei nodded.

He did not know why, but the image of the perfect body he saw when he was cleaning Lu You’s vomit after he had rescued her back to the farm appeared in his mind ...

The person in front of him was not only the leader of the Provincial Party Committee, but also Lu You’s mother! Xia ruofei suddenly felt a sense of guilt. He quickly stood up and said,””Secretary Tian, I won’t bother you anymore. I’ll take my leave!”
