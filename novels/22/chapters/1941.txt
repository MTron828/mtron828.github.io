“Is that so?” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I heard that sister Qian’s work in Changping didn’t seem to be going well ...”

“Mr. Xia, at the end of the day, it’s all because I didn’t stick to my principles as the Vice class monitor,” Zhu zhihang said sincerely.”That’s why Wu Liqian’s enthusiasm for work has been dampened. Of course, Secretary Zeng has his own difficulties. Sometimes, we don’t have a choice!”

Xia ruofei had a faint smile on his face and did not say anything.

Zhu zhihang continued.”President Xia, actually, County Head Wu also places a lot of importance on the pharmaceutical factory project. She didn’t care about personal gains and losses. After she found out that she was no longer in charge of the specific work of this project, she still wanted to make this project come to our Changping ...”

“Yup! “She’s a fool ...”Xia ruofei sighed.

To Zhu zhihang and the others, Xia ruofei’s words did not sound like he was mocking Wu Liqian. Instead, they felt that Xia ruofei and Wu Liqian were close.

Zhu zhihang also said with some emotion,””County Head Wu’s awareness is really high! Ever since she took office, she had put all her heart and soul into the work of Changping County. She’s been having some problems at work recently, and I’m worried about her, but her ability is limited ... This time, she’s able to get a chance to go to the capital for training through her own efforts. We’re really happy for her!”

Xia ruofei saw that Zhu zhihang was not pretending to be scared. In fact, in front of a cultivator with strong spiritual power like Xia ruofei, if an ordinary person lied, his subtle expressions would not escape his eyes.

He had already done what he needed to do. Changping County had already lowered their stance. Besides, Xia ruofei had no intention of choosing another place to build the factory. The most suitable place was still Changping County.

However, he naturally couldn’t let it go so easily. It should be Wu Liqian’s political achievement. Even if the Emperor came, it wouldn’t work. In the end, it had to be given to Wu Liqian.

Xia ruofei deliberately pondered for a while before saying,””County Head Zhu, I can see that Changping is very sincere. The development of an enterprise can not be separated from the support of the local government. I believe that if the Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory’s project is really set up in Changping, you will also receive full support from the county Head!”

Zhu zhihang looked happy and quickly said,””That’s for sure! A high – Quality enterprise like the peach blossom company must be on our county government’s priority list of support!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”County Head Zhu, how about this?” The location of the Paradise pharmaceutical factory hasn’t been completely decided yet. Since your Changping County also has this intention, you can send a team to connect with our pharmaceutical factory and discuss some specific problems with the project. When necessary, we will also go to the site to inspect it!”

“Alright! Alright!” Zhu zhihang was overjoyed and said,”Mr. Xia, we’ll set up a Working Group today to be in charge of contacting your company about the pharmaceutical factory project!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said casually,””County Head Zhu, County Head Wu has always been in charge of the Tao Yuan pharmaceutical factory project, so she’s more familiar with the situation. Do you think ... We should let County Head Wu take charge of this Task Force this time?”

Zhu zhihang was stunned for a moment and said in his heart,”I knew there was no such thing as a free lunch. I was just wondering why President Xia was so easy to talk to all of a sudden! It turned out that he was still trying to give Wu Liqian an achievement! Now, she had changed from sister Qian to County Head Wu ...

Although he thought so in his heart, Zhu zhihang naturally did not show any dissatisfaction on his face.

Besides, he had no intention of stealing Wu Liqian’s political achievements. People in the officialdom were more or less superstitious, or rather, it was a psychological suggestion! The last person who wanted to steal Wu Liqian’s political achievements had now packed up and left. Furthermore, he had directly resigned and was put out of the system.

Although Zhu zhihang also knew that Wu Liqian, who was far away in Beijing for training, certainly did not have the ability to make Liu haojun so miserable. Liu haojun’s incident this time was also his own doing. It probably had nothing to do with him pestering Wu Liqian and seizing Wu Liqian’s political achievements. However, this still made Zhu zhihang feel that this project was a bit strange. He had never wanted to touch it.

However, it was not a matter of whether Zhu zhihang wanted to snatch this political achievement or not, but the problem of Wu Liqian not being able to come back at all!

“President Xia, by right, County Head Wu is the most suitable candidate. I think Secretary Zeng will definitely support him!” Zhu zhihang said with a troubled expression. But ... As you know, County Head Wu is currently in the capital for training, and it will take two months! Besides, the standards of the training course in the Ministry of State affairs in Beijing are very high. I’m afraid he won’t be able to come back to take charge of the task force during this period of time!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”County Head Zhu, as long as sister Qian wants to come back, it’s not a problem to take a few days off.” And there’s no need for the county to show up ...”

Xia ruofei added in his heart,”Even if the county came forward, it would be useless. How could the training classes of the Ministry let people go just because of the words of the county Leader?

Zhu zhihang heard this and pondered for a while. He looked up and said,””Alright! Since President Xia has said so, I personally agree! Of course, we have to report to Secretary Zeng when we get back. I don’t think Secretary Zeng will object!”
