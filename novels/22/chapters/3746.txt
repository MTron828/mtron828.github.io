Xia ruofei also found a spare spacesuit from the spirit map space and quickly put it on.

In a short while, the three of them had put on their spacesuits and adjusted the walkie talkie function.

Xia ruofei closed the spacesuits visor and spoke through the intercom,Qingxue, Weiwei, you two stay here and dont move. Ill go and check out the situation!

Alright! Ling Qingxue replied. However, ruofei, you must be careful! Safety first!

Xia ruofei smiled and said,dont worry! I have many ways to save my life, and 1 will definitely put safety first! There shouldnt be any danger here, but you cant let your guard down. Also, you must always pay attention to the oxygen level and change the oxygen supply module in advance!

When they went to the moon for an expedition, each of them had prepared two spacesuits and a lot of oxygen supply modules. Some of them had been used on the way back to the moon, but there were still a lot of them left. Because everyone had a storage artifact, these things had been piled up in the storage artifact. They didnt expect to come in handy today.

Ling Qingxue said,dont worry about this! Well take care of ourselves, just pay attention to your safety!

Xia ruofei nodded and said,yes! Now that weve been teleported to this middle section, even if we have to give up the opportunity here, we must find a safe way out. Otherwise, well be trapped here to death.

Xia ruofei turned to look at the two passages and said,Moreover, the senior in the bronze coffin definitely wouldnt speak without thinking. Since he guided us here, it means that there must be some kind of opportunity here. 1 wont be satisfied if 1 dont explore it before leaving!

With that, Xia ruofei had Song Wei and Ling Qingxue come to a corner of the tunnel and marked out a certain area for them. He said,You guys stay in this area. If theres any situation, inform me immediately through the walkie talkie. Especially if theres any danger, dont take it head on. You must tell me immediately!

We will. Dont worry and go Scout the way! Song Wei said,you dont have to worry about this!
