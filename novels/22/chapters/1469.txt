Chapter 1470: Caught on the spot (2)

Translator: 549690339

In front of Xia ruofei and Song Wei, song Zhengping was like an ordinary, honest elder. He did not put on any airs and just laughed and chatted with them.

As they spoke, the topic shifted to song Rui.

This was normal. One of them was song Rui’s father, and the other was song Rui’s best brother. This was naturally a topic that could not be avoided.

“Have you been in contact with song Rui recently?” Song Zhengping smiled and asked,”I heard that he’s been lingering around Beijing and rarely goes to the three mountains.”

“We haven’t seen each other much these days, but we still keep in touch.” Xia ruofei said.

He was secretly amused. If song Zhengping knew that song Rui was staying in the capital to chase a girl, he would probably be furious.

“Mm! That kid’s too playful, you should talk to him more often. ” Song Zhengping said,”although you’re younger than him, he’ll still listen to you.”

“Song Rui is actually very ambitious. He’s just a little more active when he’s young. Uncle song, you don’t have to worry too much.” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“If he was half as steady as you, I wouldn’t have to worry about him ...” Song Zhengping said emotionally.

Xia ruofei accepted such praise, especially when he was compared to song Rui. He was even happier. It was a pity that song Rui was not present. Otherwise, he would have felt even better.

Xia ruofei was secretly happy, but he said humbly,””Uncle song, you’re too kind. I’m a poor kid, and I’m taking care of things early! I’ve experienced slightly more than song Rui ...” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Xia ruofei continued,”actually, a few of our good friends are planning to do something together. Song Rui is also actively participating.”

“Is that so?” Song Zhengping was a little surprised.”He’s never mentioned it to me!”

“Maybe it’s because he hasn’t succeeded yet, so he doesn’t want you to know too early!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”maybe he wanted to give you a surprise!”

“I’m already praying to the heavens that he’s content with his lot!” Song Zhengping said. Then, he looked at Xia ruofei with admiration and continued,”but it’ll be great if he can do something with you! RUO Fei, please guide him!”

“Don’t worry! I will, uncle song!” Xia ruofei smiled.

Song Zhengping chatted with Xia ruofei and did not leave Song Wei out. He would also chat with Song Wei from time to time.

After a while, the car drove into the villa area of the Provincial Party Committee.

The drivers, security guards, and other vehicles that were meant to pick them up all stopped at the entrance of the villa area and turned around to return to the heavily guarded villa area. There was no problem with their safety.

Furthermore, song Zhengping’s Secretary knew that the two young men he had met at the airport were very close to Secretary song. They were about to host them with a family dinner, so he arranged for everyone to leave and not disturb song Zhengping’s private time.

Even though he had been promoted to the position of head, song Zhengping still lived in his old mansion number two.

In fact, the building number did not mean anything. He was the highest – ranking official in xiangnan province. Wherever he lived, it would naturally be villa number one.

Song Zhengping’s wife had also followed him to xiangnan to take care of song Zhengping’s life.

When she saw Xia ruofei and Song Wei, she was naturally very surprised. She quickly called them in.

Song Zhengping only told Madam that Xia ruofei and Song Wei were on a trip to Xiang Nan Province. He did not tell her that he had ‘caught’ them at the airport.

As song Zhengping’s Secretary had made a call in advance, song Zhengping’s housekeeper, aunt Huang, had already prepared a sumptuous lunch in advance. After exchanging a few pleasantries, everyone headed to the restaurant for lunch.

Song Zhengping and his wife did not put on any airs in front of Xia ruofei and Song Wei. They were just ordinary elders today, so the atmosphere of the lunch was very warm.

If not for song Zhengping and his wife’s meaningful gazes, as well as Mrs. Song’s indirect questions, it would have been perfect.

Obviously, both of them had misunderstood. After all, a man and a woman were on a trip together. Everyone knew what this meant. However, Xia ruofei could not explain it and could only smile bitterly in his heart.

After the meal, Mrs. Song wanted Xia ruofei and Song Wei to stay. Xia ruofei quickly said,””Uncle song, Auntie song, we’ve already booked a hotel before we came ...”

Song Zhengping immediately revealed a knowing smile. He gave his wife a look and said,””Since you’ve already booked the hotel, we won’t keep you ...”

Mrs. Song also came back to her senses and said,””Oh ... Right, right, right, then you guys should stay in the hotel!”

Xia ruofei looked at Song Wei and smiled bitterly. This time, the misunderstanding had deepened.

Song Wei’s face was slightly red, but the corners of her mouth curved up into a beautiful arc. She glanced at Xia ruofei with a faint smile but did not say anything.

After dinner, everyone made tea and chatted in the living room. After sitting for a while, Xia ruofei bid farewell.

Song Zhengping and his wife personally sent them to the door and arranged for a chauffeur to send them to the hotel.

At the entrance of the villa, song Zhengping handed Xia ruofei a piece of paper with a phone number written on it. He smiled and said,””Ruofei, this is the number of my Secretary, Xiao Cao. If you need anything in xiangnan, you can look for him and ask him to run errands for you. Of course, you can also call me directly. You have my number.”

Xia ruofei took the phone number and put it in his pocket.””Okay, thank you, uncle song!”

“You’re still so polite to me?” Song Zhengping said,”Oh right, if you need a tour guide during your stay in xiangnan, get Xiao Cao to arrange one for you. Don’t stand on ceremony with me!”

“I’ll call Secretary Cao if I need anything. Uncle song, we’ll be taking our leave now!” Xia ruofei said.

“Uncle song, Auntie song, goodbye!” Song Wei said.

“Goodbye!” Song Zhengping and his wife waved goodbye to the two of them. Song Zhengping did not forget to remind them,”if you have the time, come over to our house for a visit. Without song Rui by our side, the two of us are quite lonely!”

“Alright!”

The two of them got into song Zhengping’s Red flag sedan. The driver started the car steadily and drove away from the villa district.

As song Zhengping’s chauffeur was in the car, the two of them did not talk about the day’s events on the way. Very quickly, the car arrived at the Kempinski Hotel that Xia ruofei had booked in advance at San Shan.

After Xia ruofei got out of the car, he politely declined the chauffeur’s help to carry his luggage. Instead, he took out a pack of specially – made cigarettes without any labels and stuffed it into the chauffeur’s hands.

“Master, thank you for your hard work!” Xia ruofei smiled.

The chauffeur was song Zhengping’s driver, so he had a sharp eye. His eyes lit up when he saw the packaging.

However, he still declined.”It’s what I should do. I can’t accept this!”

Xia ruofei stuffed the cigarette into the driver’s hand and smiled gently.””It’s just a small gift, don’t reject it! We’re going in now, drive slowly!”

“AI! Thank you so much!” The driver chuckled and put the cigarette into his pocket.

As he watched Xia ruofei and Song Wei walk into the hotel through the rotating door, the driver could not help but take out the pack of cigarettes and looked at it for a long time. Then, he muttered to himself,”A special supply of cigarettes! This was rare ... It seemed that the identities of these two were not simple! But their attitude is really kind. The people from big families have good manners!”

After saying that, the driver carefully put the cigarette into his pocket, turned around, got into the car, and left.

Song Wei couldn’t help but burst out laughing when Xia ruofei and her entered the hotel.

“You can still laugh?” Xia ruofei said helplessly,”if your father hears about this, will he cut me into eight pieces?”

“What do you think?” Song Wei said with a smile.

“It should be ... Possible ... Maybe ... No!” Xia ruofei did not have much confidence.

He then puffed out his chest to boost his courage,””I didn’t do anything wrong, so I’m not afraid!”

Song Wei was amused by Xia ruofei and laughed.”Alright! Let’s go check in first!”

The two of them chatted as they walked to the front desk of the hotel.
