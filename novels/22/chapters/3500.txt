Only then did Ling Qingxue react. She couldn’t help but stick out her tongue and say, a little embarrassed,””Oh, right! I’m so happy that 1 can’t think of home…”

Song Wei also smiled and said,”then i’ll go back to the University to deal with some trivial matters and finish the research topic. This way, I’ll have nothing to do this semester and can go back to school after the winter vacation. Besides, 1’11 mainly prepare my graduation thesis next semester. I have more free time, so I should have a lot of time to cultivate on peach source Island!” “Then 1’11 have to have a good talk with my dad when 1 get back,” Ling Qingxue said hurriedly.”! want to gradually pull myself away from some company affairs. I don’t want to be entangled in worldly affairs all day long…”

Ling Qingxue naturally wanted to stay on Peach Blossom Island to cultivate for a long time. If Song Wei could spend a long time on Peach Blossom Island, she would have to hand over the work at Ling Ji’s food and beverage department as soon as possible. Otherwise, it would be easy for her to fall behind Song Wei in terms of cultivation.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”then let’s go back together!” 1’11 send Weiwei to the capital first, then Qingxue and I will go back to the three mountains!”

Xia ruofei’s focus had now shifted to cultivation, but he still had to ask about the company’s Affairs. He had disappeared for such a long time, so there must be a lot of things.

In addition, Xia ruofei had always had a plan in his heart, which was to gradually and completely separate himself from the management of paradise Corporation. In fact, the daily management of the company was handled by Feng Jing and her team, but many aspects could not be separated from Xia ruofei’s “core technology”. This time, he had returned to solve this problem.

In fact, with Xia ruofei’s current cultivation and status, money and wealth in the secular world no longer meant much to him. However, the purpose of paradise corporation’s existence was not only to make money for Xia ruofei, but also for the livelihood of thousands of employees. Even if he wanted to leave the company’s management, he couldn’t just simply leave. That would be too irresponsible.

Since they had made up their mind to return to Huaxia, Xia ruofei and the other two would not delay any further. However, before he left, he still had to say a few words to Li Yifu.

As for Luo Qingfeng, he had completely entered a state of seclusion. Xia ruofei would not disturb him easily.

Xia ruofei sent a voice transmission to Li Yifu to inform him. Soon, Li Yifu arrived at the top floor, knocked on the door, and called out respectfully,””Senior granduncle!”

Xia ruofei and the other two had basically stayed in their rooms for the entire week. Everyone was engrossed in their cultivation. Li Yifu was also very tactful and basically did not come over to disturb them. Now that Xia ruofei had suddenly called for him, he quickly ran upstairs to listen to his instructions. “Come in!” Xia ruofei said.

Li Yifu immediately greeted the three of them respectfully after entering the room. He then bowed slightly and asked,””Martial granduncle, what instructions do you have for this disciple?”

Xia ruofei smiled.”The three of us are preparing to return to Huaxia. Qingfeng is also in seclusion now. I’ll have to trouble you to take care of some matters on the island.”

“Yes! This disciple will definitely do his best. Please rest assured, martial granduncle!” Li Yifu quickly said,”but… Senior granduncle, aren’t you going to stay for a while longer?”

Xia ruofei smiled.”! still have some things to deal with when 1 get back. However, 1 won’t be back for long. 1’11 be back soon!”

“That’s good,” Li Yifu quickly said.”I’ll only be at ease if you’re on the island!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”with the Taixu xuanqing formation, what do you have to worry about?” Even if Chen Nanfeng were to come here personally, he wouldn’t be able to break into the formation so easily!”

After Xia ruofei finished speaking, he took out ten crystals and handed them to Li Yifu.

“No!” Li Yifu hurriedly declined upon seeing this.”Senior granduncle, the origin crystals you gave this disciple haven’t been used up yet… 1 really don’t need so many!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”this is not for you!” This was prepared for the allheaven formation outside! I’ve just changed the origin crystals last night, so they should be able to keep the formation running for at least a month. Under normal circumstances, I shouldn’t need to change the origin crystals before I come back. I’m leaving you ten origin crystals just in case. The method of changing origin crystals is also very simple, stop the highest heaven formation, and then change origin crystals according to the blueprint. I’ve written down the specific method of controlling the formation on the paper, and with your current spiritual power, you should be able to easily complete the operation.”

With that, Xia ruofei handed the crystal and the paper with the control method of the highest heaven formation to Li Yifu.

Li Yifu finally understood what was going on. He quickly took it with both hands and said,””Yes! Martial granduncle, this disciple will keep it for now. If there is a need to change it, this disciple will definitely be careful.”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”if 1 really don’t come back for a long time and the origin crystals of the highest heaven formation are used up, you can replace them when you need to. Don’t worry about saving resources.” This level of consumption is nothing at all. In comparison, the most important thing is the increase in efficiency and time saved in exchange for the assistance of formations in cultivation!”

Li Yifu was touched. Of course, he knew that Xia ruofei was doing this for his sake. After all, he was old and time was precious to him. If he could not break through to the Golden core stage, he would have to face the problem of his lifespan running out..
