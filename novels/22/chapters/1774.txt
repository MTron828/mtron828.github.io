Chapter 1775: The problem of candidates (3)

“It’s still not?” Xia ruofei said,”I might return to the three mountains the day after tomorrow. Do you want me to wait for another day?”

“No, no!” Wu Qiang quickly said,”director Xia, I’ll get sister – in – Law and the rest to buy their own plane tickets. Don’t let the company spend any money.”

“I already said that I’ll reimburse the road expenses! Don’t waste time! This matter is settled!” Xia ruofei said,”hurry up and make a call. Also, send your ID number to me on WeChat!” By the way, tell them to keep their bus tickets as well. The company will reimburse them as well!”

Seeing Xia ruofei’s firm attitude, Wu Qiang could only nod and say,””Okay, thank you, President Xia!”

“That’s the way!” Xia ruofei said with satisfaction,”Oh right, I don’t think they’ve ever taken a plane before, right? You have to tell them some things to take note of over the phone, such as making sure to bring your ID card, and also some items that are not allowed to be brought along. Try to bring as little luggage as possible! I’ll buy whatever I lack in Beijing! It’s best to get someone with experience to accompany them to the provincial capital and send them to the airport before going back. ” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Seeing that Xia ruofei had thought about it so carefully, Wu Qiang was even more touched and his voice became a little choked.””Yes! I know, President Xia!”

Xia ruofei patted Wu Qiang’s shoulder and returned to his own courtyard.

Wu Qiang, who had been in the Army before, was also very decisive. Since he had already made an agreement with Xia ruofei, he did not hesitate any longer. He quickly contacted his sister – in – Law and the lady and instructed them to rush to the provincial capital the next morning.

As for the things that Xia ruofei had mentioned, Wu Qiang had also reminded him several times over the phone.

The younger brother of his blind date happened to be studying in the provincial city. Therefore, Wu Qiang specifically asked the lady to ask her brother to take a half – day leave tomorrow to pick them up at the bus station and send them to the airport.

Wu Qiang’s sister – in – Law and the lady had never been on a plane before. They were both excited and nervous. They even asked Wu Qiang how he could take a plane if he did not have one. Wu Qiang could only explain patiently, telling them that they could book a ticket online with their ID number and then go to the airport to change their boarding pass.

After the call, Wu Qiang immediately sent the ID number he had just received to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei immediately contacted Liu Qian and forwarded her his ID number. He asked her to book two tickets from Wu Qiang’s hometown, the provincial capital, to the capital.

Xia ruofei didn’t have a full – time assistant. If there were any matters, he would usually contact Feng Jing’s assistant, Liu Qian, to handle them.

Naturally, Liu Qian had booked two tickets at 1 p.m. The next day at the fastest speed according to Xia ruofei’s request.

Xia ruofei forwarded the flight details to Wu Qiang before taking a shower and resting.

Before going to bed, Xia ruofei took out the spiritual crystals as usual to prepare for cultivation. He was very close to a breakthrough recently, so unless there were special circumstances, he would not slack off in his daily cultivation.

As he sat down, Xia ruofei thought of Song Wei.

He thought for a while and took out his phone to send Song Wei a WeChat message. He felt that he would be leaving the capital in two days, so he had to let Song Wei know. It would be best if the two of them could practice together again.

Of course, he knew that Song Wei had been avoiding him for the past few days. Xia ruofei was well aware of the reason, but it would be bad for both parties if he made it clear.

After Xia ruofei sent the message, he put his phone aside and prepared to start cultivating.

Unexpectedly, as soon as he put down his phone, he heard a WeChat notification ...
