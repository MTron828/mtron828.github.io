Chapter 527: Three days of leisure (2)

From the sky, he could see the fertile green land of the Hunter Valley. He could also see kangaroos jumping on the green carpet. The short one – hour flight had left an indelible impression in Xia ruofei’s mind.

Ever since Xia ruofei retired from the Army, he had been busy.

After solving the problem of survival, he had been developing his career around the spirit maps and paintings. This was the first time he had completely relaxed his body and mind.

Xia ruofei had stayed in the Hunter Valley for four days.

He was ready to return to China the next day. However, Tang He’s private plane had already been at the Sydney Airport for three days. Xia ruofei would be a little embarrassed if he continued to play.

Today, Liang Qichao only arranged one event, which was to visit the West Winery in Hunter Valley.

West Winery was next to Paradise Farm. Xia ruofei’s purpose for this trip was to visit his neighbors and also to experience Australia’s wine culture.

Hunter Valley was the origin of wine in Australia. It was also a world – renowned wine – producing area. The production of grape wine here was less than 2% of the total production in Australia, but it was quite famous.

Xia ruofei and Liang Qichao drove the open – Top off – Road vehicle to West Winery. The winery looked ordinary from the outside, like a simple warehouse, but Xia ruofei did not dare to underestimate it.

Liang Qichao had introduced the winery to Xia ruofei along the way.

The West Winery was founded in 1866. It was a family – style winery with more than 150 years of history. Its Semillon wine was also well – known.

The current owner of West Winery was called Carter. West was an old man in his 50s. He was standing at the entrance of the winery to welcome his neighbor.

Carter had the enthusiasm of a Westerner. Before the car had even stabilized, he had already come up to greet him with a smile. The moment Liang Qichao got out of the car, he gave him a warm hug and said,””Liang! Welcome to my winery!”

“Thank you!” Liang Qichao smiled and said,”Mr. West, let me introduce you. This is my friend, Xia ruofei. He’s also a major shareholder of Paradise Farm.”

Carter was surprised and exclaimed,””Wow! Mr. Xia, you’re so young, but you already own a high – Quality farm. I’m really envious!”

Over the years, Carter had heard a lot of rumors about the Chinese being rich. Today, he saw with his own eyes that Xia ruofei owned a farm worth tens of millions of us dollars at such a young age. He suddenly had a feeling that it was true.

Xia ruofei was also sizing up Carter. This old man was not tall, but he was very well – built. He wore a red and black plaid shirt with a pair of matching jeans and a leather apron. His hair was a mess, and his big nose was a little red. He did not look like the owner of a winery at all. He looked more like a slaughterhouse worker.

“Mr. Carter, nice to meet you!” Xia ruofei replied in fluent English,”I only have a certain share of the farm. Your winery, on the other hand, has a long history and rich accumulation!”

“Hahaha! Xia, I like what you’re saying!” Carter laughed happily.”The West Winery was built by my grandfather’s grandfather, and it has been passed down for six generations! Come, come, come, please come in! I’ll show you around ...”

“Thank you!”

Carter led Liang Qichao and Xia ruofei into the winery.

From the outside, it looked like a winery with a large warehouse, but the inside was really a whole new world.

The burning fireplace, the beautiful glass wall paintings, and the large space that could accommodate 300 people at a time gave off a warm and ancient feeling.

There were floor – to – Ceiling wine cabinets on several walls, filled with all kinds of fine wine, and the wine – tasting area was also very luxurious. It had to be said that wine lovers would feel like they were in heaven. The deep and alluring wine fragrance, the stronger wine, and the faint smell of alcohol from before were fermenting here bit by bit. Their mood was great!

There was also a Wine Museum in the winery, which displayed wine – making equipment from more than a hundred years ago and clearly described the history of the winery. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Every day, tourists from all over the world would come to the Hunter Valley. Wine tasting in the winery was a must for everyone, so most wineries were open to tourists.

The West Winery was no exception.

There were many tourists here who visited the winery and tasted wine at the same time.

Carter first brought Xia ruofei and Liang Qichao to visit his vineyard.

West winery’s vineyard was built on a few undulating hills. Looking from a high place, the mountains were continuous, and the vineyard plots were well – arranged. The grape leaves were lush and woven into dark green and light green color blocks. There were beautiful blue flowers and roses around, and wild kangaroos were jumping between the grape trenches, looking very lively.

Carter gave a brief introduction to the vineyard and then said proudly,””Xia, high – Quality vineyard are usually set up on the hill, which is convenient for drainage after rain; If the soil drainage was not good for a vineyard planted on flat land, in the event of heavy rain, the rain could not be eliminated, and the grape juice would dilute, and the quality of the wine produced would not be very good. That’s why the wine produced by our West Winery is of the highest quality!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Mr. West, this trip was worth it. I didn’t know there’s so much knowledge in wine. I’ve really learned a lot!”
