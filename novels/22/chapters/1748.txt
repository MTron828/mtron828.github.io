Chapter 1749: New wine revealed (1)

“Oh?” Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows and asked,”what’s his idea?”

Zhao Yongjun laughed and said,”aren’t reality shows very popular now?” “Furthermore, there are many reality shows this year that are returning to rural life. That kid Hou Liang has a lot of connections at the SARFT, so he wants to bring in such a show. It just so happens that xiangnan TV’s life I’m looking forward to is preparing to shoot the second season in a few months, so Hou Liang is confident that he can pull them in.”

Zhao Yongjun took a sip of tea to moisten his throat and continued,””It’s not realistic for us to complete all the construction in a few months, but it’s not a problem for us to rush the work and meet the shooting needs of the festival team. After all, the show only needs a mushroom house and a work room. We can also open up some vegetable fields and ponds. It won’t be long.”

Xia ruofei had heard of this show before. It was actually a group of celebrities living in a house they called the mushroom house and experiencing village life together. There were a few regular guests and different guests would be invited every episode.

Xia ruofei had watched one or two episodes in his spare time and found them interesting. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

In fact, the idea of this show was not unusual, but the pace of city life was getting faster and faster, and people were getting more and more stressed. This kind of show just happened to meet the inner aspirations of many people. The selling point was that they could relax and empty their minds.

Xia ruofei nodded.”Yes, this show is quite popular and has a good demonstration effect. Even the celebrities are staying here overnight. Those so – called haunted rumors are naturally dispelled on their own!”

“Yeah!” Zhao Yongjun nodded. “That’s why I said that this kid Hou Liang’s idea is quite reliable!”

Xia ruofei lowered his head and thought for a while before saying,””Big brother Zhao, I still feel that something is not right ...”

“What’s wrong?” Zhao Yongjun asked curiously.

“Think about it ... Our Conference Center is targeted at the upper class, and we have a membership system.” Xia ruofei said,”it’s true that bringing in a reality show can spread the news to us and it’s not difficult to crush the rumors. But you didn’t target the audience, right? It didn’t matter whether the vast audience believed these rumors or not! The important thing is our potential customers ...”

Zhao Yongjun pursed his lips and said,”now that you put it that way ... It does seem like it!”

Xia ruofei continued,”there’s another point. Reality shows like this have a strong advertising effect. However, for a club like ours that emphasizes privacy, will it have the opposite effect?” Think about it, if someone comes to visit the show’s filming location every few days ...”

Zhao Yongjun smiled.”That’s not a problem. After our club officially opens, the security will definitely be very good. Protecting the members ‘privacy is our top priority! You won’t be able to enter without a membership card. ”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”if that’s the case ... Then let’s make it a backup plan!” After all, a few months is too long. We have to find a solution to the problem in the short term. ”

Zhao Yongjun thought for a while.”Ruofei, why don’t we find a water Army? we have the confidence anyway. We’re not lying through our teeth.”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”it’s a bad idea to find a water Army, brother Zhao!” It’s impossible not to leave any traces. If we’re targeted by someone with ill intentions, it’ll be more or less troublesome ...”

After Xia ruofei finished, he pondered for a while and said,””How about this? We’ll hold a groundbreaking ceremony in the next few days!”

Zhao Yongjun’s eyes lit up,”that’s a good idea!” When the time comes, we’ll invite more famous guests ...”

Xia ruofei added,”it’s best to invite some people from the field of metaphysics and find some media to report about it!”

Zhao Yongjun laughed,”not bad, not bad!” It was better to find the proper media than the Internet Water Army! However, the media might not be able to cover anything related to metaphysics ...”

“That doesn’t matter!” Xia ruofei said,”our potential customers should be the guests we invited that day! As long as an authoritative figure in the field of metaphysics vouched for us, we can dispel everyone’s doubts! As for the media reports, they were just in passing! If we want to completely eliminate these rumors, we can just activate Hou Liang’s backup plan. ”

Zhao Yongjun thought for a while, then slapped his thigh and said,””Alright! It’s decided! I’ll look for a few brothers to discuss this later! Assign the specific tasks for the groundbreaking ceremony!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”let’s hurry up with this!” I’ve been out for a little too long this time. It’s about time I return to the three mountains!”

“What’s wrong?”Zhao Yongjun asked with a smile. Does sister – in – Law have any objections?”

“No, I didn ‘t!” Xia ruofei said,”but my company is still in the three mountains! Besides, we’re planning to move the company’s headquarters to the city, so there are a lot of things to do. I can’t stay in Beijing all the time. ”

Zhao Yongjun laughed,”you’re so stubborn!.”

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”I’m not song Rui!” That kid looks like a wife – slave, so even if he’s with Zhuo Yiyi in the future, he’ll definitely be under her thumb!”

Zhao Yongjun couldn’t help but laugh.

“By the way, should we wait for Xiao Rui to come back for dinner?” he asked.
