Chapter 148: Chapter 145 – furious rebuking in person (1)

When the accompanying director of the Public Security Bureau, Xu Jianbo, saw the scene before him, his heart could not help but skip a beat. Just now, he had felt that Wu Liqian’s behavior was a little strange. Qianqian’s next stop was the Public Security Bureau, but she changed her schedule at the last minute. She didn’t even go to the health Bureau, but came directly to the county hospital. When she arrived at the county hospital, she didn’t even greet the hospital leaders. Instead, she walked straight to the inpatient department building. Now that he saw the scene in the ward, even if Xu Jianbo was slow to realize it, he already knew that Wu Liqian must have received the news in advance, which was why she had rushed over without stopping. Now, Xu Jianbo could only hope that there were no problems with the procedures of these police officers. Otherwise, with Wu Liqian’s attitude, a beating today would be inevitable. Wu Liqian did not even have the time to think about the politics of the government. The handcuff on Xia ruofei’s wrist was so glaring that it made her angry. The tall and thin police officer saw a group of leaders suddenly appearing at the door of the ward and panicked. The people in the system naturally knew the newly appointed beautiful Deputy County Head. Xu Jianbo, who was next to Wu Liqian, was their direct superior and the boss of the Bureau. The tall and thin police officer forced himself to remain calm and saluted the leaders.”Reporting to County Head Wu, the county Public Security Bureau’s Criminal Police department’s police officer Chen tie is currently on an arrest mission.” Wu Liqian looked at Chen tie coldly and pointed at Xia ruofei,””This is the target you want to capture? Xiao Xia is a private entrepreneur that I personally introduced to Changping County. At the same time, he’s also a retired soldier with outstanding military achievements. May I ask what heinous crime he has committed? Do you need to point your guns at him and handcuff him?” Both Xu Jianbo and Chen tie’s faces turned pale at the same time. Their hearts also thumped, knowing that this was bad. Xu Jianbo saw that Chen tie was so scared that he stammered for a long time and could not come up with a reason. He could not help but frown and said,”Little Chen, what’s the situation? just report it to County Head Wu as it is! County Head Wu has always been impartial and would never side with anyone. ” When Chen tie heard Xu Jianbo’s words, he suddenly had an idea and quickly said,””Yes! Chief!” “Mayor Wu,” he said to Wu Liqian,”this is the situation. We were on duty at the criminal Police unit today and received a call from Chengxi police station. They said that one of their policemen was injured during law enforcement and asked for our help. We followed the comrades of the West City Institute to the county hospital. After the identification of the comrades of the West City Institute, the person suspected of injuring the police is this Mr. Xia, so I summoned him according to the law and asked him to go to the brigade for interrogation. However, this gentleman wasn’t very cooperative and injured our brigade’s police officer, Wu Liben. We had no choice but to use firearms and take coercive measures against him!” Chen tie’s words were very clever. He avoided the important points and shifted the focus to Xia ruofei’s assault, police assault, and non – cooperation. If Wu Liqian did not know Xia ruofei and did not receive his call beforehand, she might have been able to get away with this. When Xu Jianbo heard this, his heart immediately relaxed. He thought to himself,”so that kid attacked a police officer, then things will be easy.” With this in mind, Xu Jianbo cleared his throat and said,””Little Chen, although the situation is special, you can’t use firearms at will! Especially in the hospital. The process of law enforcement still had to pay attention to the methods! Hurry up and uncuff me!” Hearing this, Chen tie was delighted and quickly said,”Yes! Director, I’ll definitely reflect on this when I get back!” Then, he quickly went forward to unlock Xia ruofei’s handcuffs. Xu Jianbo nodded in satisfaction, then turned to Wu Liqian and said politely,””County Head Wu, I think this is most likely a misunderstanding. The few comrades from the West City Police station are not seriously injured, and this Mr. Xia is an investor in our County. Why don’t we just let this matter go? the criminal Police force will not file a case. What do you think?” He felt that Wu Liqian should stop while she could. After all, Xia ruofei was the one who was in the wrong. He didn’t expect Wu Liqian to just look at him indifferently and say to Xia ruofei,””Little Xia, tell me about the situation! I won’t listen to one side of the story. ” A trace of darkness flashed in Xu Jianbo’s eyes. He had not expected Wu Liqian to be so disrespectful in public. He had clearly given her a way out, but she still refused to give in. Xia ruofei looked at Public Security Bureau Director Xu Jianbo thoughtfully before he said,””County Head Wu, it’s a long story. I’ll first report to you what happened near the Chengxi police station this morning! Chen Gang, the auxiliary police officer of Chengxi police station ...” At this point, Xia ruofei suddenly stopped and looked at Chen Gang and Chen tie. He smiled meaningfully and said,””Chen Gang, Chen tie ... Are you two brothers?” Chen tie’s face turned red and white. He quickly glanced at Wu Liqian and said,””Mr. Xia, this has nothing to do with the case ...” Xu Jianbo also had a bad feeling. He was very clear that Chen Gang and Chen tie were cousins. He had also heard that Chen Gang from the West City Institute had always caused trouble because of his father’s power. However, those were all minor mistakes that did not matter much. He would not offend Chen Jinbo for this. Now that Xia ruofei was suddenly hinting at something, Xu Jianbo felt that this matter might not be as simple as it seemed on the surface. If he did not handle it well, he might suffer a loss in the dark. Xia ruofei didn’t press on with the issue of their relationship. He continued,””Chen Gang, the assistant police officer of the West City Police station, brought the Wolfhound to the station for duty. He did not fulfill his duty of watching over it, causing the dog to run out and hurt people. This is the injured person at the time.” Xia ruofei pointed at Cao tieshu’s wife who was lying on the bed. When Cao tieshu’s wife saw so many leaders, she was so nervous that she couldn’t speak. Xia ruofei continued.”At that time, in order to save the injured person, the villagers had no choice but to accidentally kill the dog. They didn’t even have time to ask the dog’s owner for compensation. They just sent the injured person to the hospital for emergency treatment.” Xia ruofei paused and looked at Chen Gang coldly.””Then, the auxiliary police officer quickly found the hospital. As the owner of the dog, not only did he not apologize or compensate for the medical and nutrition expenses, but he also made a false accusation and asked for fifty thousand Yuan! And he even threatened to take him to the police station. This is what the police officer just said!” “I can’t help but ask, for your family’s personal matters, you brought a few Auxiliary Police officers, wore police uniforms to the hospital to threaten the victims, and extorted a huge amount of compensation. Is this your official duty?” Xia ruofei raised his voice and said,”the auxiliary Police don’t have independent law enforcement power. The few of you keep saying that you want to handcuff this one and arrest that one. Who gave you the confidence to do so?” [PS] the ranking on the monthly rankings has been sliding down.
