Translator: 549690339

Lei Hu briefly introduced the four veterans to Xia ruofei. Two of them had retired last year, while the other two had just retired. They had been in the same combat unit when they were in the Army, and there was no problem with their tacit understanding.

The most important thing was that they were comrades in the same company as Lei Hu. Lei Hu knew them well and could guarantee their reliability.

After introducing the situation, Lei Hu lowered his voice and said,”Brother Xia, there are actually quite a few suitable candidates for this batch of newly recruited veterans. The reason why I chose the four of them, apart from their tacit cooperation, is for another more important reason.”

“Oh? Tell me about it. ” Xia ruofei said with great interest.

“Their family situation is relatively more difficult,” Lei Hu said. “Xu Yougang’s father and mother are like medicine bottles, and his wife’s health isn’t too good. The whole family depends on him to earn money to support the family.”Zeng Liang was scammed when he started his business after he retired from the military. Not only did he pay his retirement fees, but he also owed a debt of more than 200000 Yuan. The other two were in similar situations ...”

“I just think that their family’s situation is very difficult in reality. Since you’re willing to pay such a high reward, even if there’s an accident, they definitely won’t betray you for the money!” Lei Hu said.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”not bad, you’re very thoughtful!” Hu, I can’t tell! You’re also good at management! It seems that it’s a waste of talent to be in charge of security!”

Lei Hu quickly waved his hand and said,”brother Xia, don’t make fun of me!” My highest rank in the Army is the squad leader. Now, I’m in charge of dozens of people, and I’m already a company commander! How would I dare to say that it’s a waste of talent!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.”How can this be compared to the Army! Hu Zi, do your best! “In the future, even if we’re only in charge of security, our team will grow bigger and bigger. Now that I have quite a few businesses overseas, it’s even possible for me to stay abroad permanently. However, you should learn more when you have time. It’s not just in management, but also in foreign languages and so on. They’ll all be necessary skills in the future!”

“I know, brother Xia!” Lei Hu said. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Then I’ll call them in!” He asked.

Xia ruofei nodded.

Soon, Xu Yougang and the other veterans returned to Xia ruofei’s office, looking slightly reserved.

Lei Hu then formally introduced them to Xia ruofei.

When Xu You had just joined the Army, he had been their squad leader. He and Zeng Liang had retired last year. The other two were Wang Chong and Zhang Aijun. They had also been good soldiers in the Army. However, due to the limited number of senior non – commissioned officers, they could only regretfully retire after serving a certain number of years.

Xia ruofei nodded kindly and smiled.””Sit down!” He said.

Lei Hu said to Xia ruofei,”CEO Xia, if there’s nothing else, I’ll go back first!” If you have any missions, just tell the four of them!”

Xia ruofei knew that Lei Hu was trying to avoid suspicion. Since he was not prepared to participate in this matter, he might as well not listen. This was also a very cautious approach, which made Xia ruofei’s impression of him better.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””Good! Hu, you’ve worked hard ...”

Before Lei Hu left, he looked at the four veterans and said seriously,””Old Xu, Zeng Liang, Wang Chong, Aijun, we were all good comrades and brothers back in the company. But now that we’re all retired, and the situation this time is rather special, there might be some things that might not sound nice, but I still have to make things clear ...”

“Squad leader Lei, please speak!” Xu Yougang looked at Lei Hu and said.

Lei Hu’s eyes were sharp as he said,”I’m indebted to general manager Xia for his knowledge and guidance. He also paid such a high reward for this matter. I recommended you guys, so I have to be responsible for my own recommendation.” “I’ll say the ugly things first. If we fail this time, I hope that everyone can be more manly. President Xia has also said that even if anyone is trapped in the office, he will not let you have any worries. If anyone cowards and bites President Xia out, then don’t blame me, Lei Hu, for not considering our friendship as comrades. Even if you run to the ends of the earth, I will definitely chase you down and cripple you!”

Xu Yougang frowned.”Squad leader Lei, it’s not like you don’t know what kind of person I am. And liangzi and the others. Is one of them a Sharkman?” There’s no need for you to say such harsh words!”

Lei Hu snorted coldly and said,”you can understand or blame me, but I have to give you a warning!” As long as you do your best for President Xia, he will definitely not treat you badly! Look at my comrades who joined the company with me, they’re all doing well now. If this matter is handled well, you guys won’t be worse than them!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”Hu, we’re all comrades. Why are you saying such hurtful words?” Alright, alright, you can go if you have things to do!”

“Yes, President Xia!” Lei Hu replied immediately.

After Lei Hu left the office, Xia ruofei smiled and said,””Lei Hu’s words are not very pleasant to hear, don’t take it to heart!”

Xu Yougang quickly said,”President Xia, we’ve been in the same company as squad leader Lei for many years. We know each other very well. He’s doing this out of his loyalty to you. We understand it very well!”
