  "Not bad, not bad!" Xia ruofei nodded and said,"give me a copy of all the information on this project later. I want to take a good look at it!"

  Xia ruofei's interest had been piqued, so he naturally wanted to study the project information to prevent any mistakes.

  "No problem!" Feng Jing nodded and said,"by the way, Chairman, the Sanshan city government is really sincere this time. Not only did they not give any discount, but they even symbolically charged the land at 1 Chinese yuan per mu. In fact, they're giving it away for free! It's also because I didn't spend any money on the land that I dared to put so many projects into the first phase of the project in one go. "

  "The Sanshan city government sure is generous!" Xia ruofei said in surprise,"if I didn't know you well, I would even suspect that you've gone to work as a leader!"

  Feng Jing smiled."I definitely won't do anything illegal. The municipal government did give a lot of support to a few companies with more potential, including our company. We took the opportunity to make some requests. We just didn't expect it to go so smoothly ..."

  Feng Jing added,"actually, this is also because we started to focus on internet marketing!" "At that time, our management had already formed a consensus to vigorously develop our own marketing platform and even build our own data center. This was also written in our application report as a key development point. On the other hand, Sanshan has also been committed to building an Internet industry cluster. A few years ago, they began to promote some Internet projects, including digital town, so when our report was submitted, the leader was also very optimistic about it."

  Xia ruofei couldn't help but chuckle and said,""This can be considered the right time, place, and people. No wonder things are so smooth." RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

  The three of them talked as they walked. After Xia ruofei said this, he looked up and saw a new sign,"Development Department."

  "Let's go and take a look together!" Xia ruofei said.

  Then, he took the lead and walked into the R & D department. Xia ruofei couldn't help but chuckle and said,""This can be considered the right time, place, and people. No wonder things are so smooth."

  The three of them talked as they walked. After Xia ruofei said this, he looked up and saw a new sign,"Development Department."

  Feng Jing also said,"the development Department has been doing well recently!" The progress of our own online marketing platform in Paradise Mall is very fast. If there are no accidents, the internal version should be developed in advance!"

  He laughed and said,"this is the newly established Development Department, right?" The main force of our own online marketing platform?"

  "It will also be the main force in building the data center in the future!" Dong Yun smiled and said,"we've been hiring a lot of people in internet technology and marketing. There are new people coming in almost every day!"

  "Yang Xincheng!" Feng Jing said,"I used to be the head of the technical support department. I'm an expert in technical matters."

  Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,"I think I have some impression of this person. He joined the company quite early. I think he was personally poached by CEO Feng?" Xia ruofei couldn't help but chuckle and said,""This can be considered the right time, place, and people. No wonder things are so smooth."

  Xia ruofei laughed and said,"then I'll have to take a good look!" Oh right, who's in charge of the research department? Do I know him?"

  "That's right!" Feng Jing laughed."Back then, all of this was my problem. I personally interviewed most of the employees back then!"

  "Let's go and take a look together!" Xia ruofei said.

  Then, he took the lead and walked into the R & D department.
