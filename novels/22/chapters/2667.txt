Xia ruofei was very clear that in the world of cultivation, it was useless for him to deal with his forces in the secular world alone.

He was a level 9 “rogue cultivator.” Under normal circumstances, he wouldn’t have any chance of winning against a cultivation sect with a golden core cultivator and 20 to 30 cultivators above level 7.

The people of the star Seizer sect definitely didn’t know his identity as a cultivator yet, so they wanted to get in touch with him according to the rules of the secular world.

Xia ruofei did not even need to think to know that Wang Boshan wanted to meet him to buy Peach Blossom Island. That was why he said it was a business worth billions of US dollars.

If there were no accidents, the price offered by Wang Boshan should be a high price that no one could refuse under normal circumstances. If he refused it in person, the other party would definitely be suspicious. Even if they were not suspicious, once they lost their patience, they were likely to give up using the rules of the secular world to do things and switch to the methods of the cultivation world.

With Xia ruofei’s current strength, he would not be able to withstand the power of the entire sect.

Hence, Xia ruofei felt that the best choice now was not to meet with Wang Boshan and the others.

Besides, in this battle of Peach Blossom Island, Xia ruofei’s only chance of winning was that the strength of the island itself was not comparable to his own. Naturally, he could only rely on the power of the formation.

Once Xia ruofei activated the natural formation, the Taixu xuanqing formation, it would be difficult for an ordinary Aurous core stage cultivator to break through it. Or perhaps, they were extremely proficient in array Dao.

The cultivation world on earth had declined so much that Xia ruofei guessed that not many inheritances of the array Dao could be left behind. In addition, the intelligence showed that the sect leader of the star Seizer sect, Luo Qingfeng, had only broken through to the Golden core stage in recent years. It could be seen that this person’s cultivation talent was not bad. However, according to the current cultivation environment on earth, Luo Qingfeng was likely to be stuck in the early stage of the Golden core stage.

If that was the case, the possibility of Luo Qingfeng breaking the Taixu xuanqing formation was not high.

In this case, Xia ruofei’s top priority was to set up the array on the Peach Blossom Island.

His original plan was to take it step by step. First, he would train the guards to replace the International mercenaries on the island. On the basis of actual control of the island’s defense, he would withdraw the Liu family’s people and replace them with people he trusted in every post.

After all of this was done, the final step was to set up and activate the formation.

This way, he could minimize the risk of leaking the secret.

However, there was no time now. Xia ruofei could only put the matter of setting up the formation at the forefront.

Setting up a formation at the level of the Taixu xuanqing formation was not as simple as a small spirit gathering formation, which could be done by carving the formation patterns on a few pieces of jade. Even though the Peach Blossom Island itself had already formed the key node of the natural formation, it still took a lot of effort to activate such a large formation.

This was also one of the reasons why Xia ruofei did not put setting up and activating the formation first.

Naturally, there was no time for Xia ruofei to play it safe.

After reading the information provided by Liu chengfeng, he let out a long breath and closed his eyes to think for a long time. Then he stood up, took out his phone, and dialed Li Yifu’s number.

It was 10 p.m. In Huaxia, and it was morning in the United States so when Xia ruofei called, Li Yifu picked up immediately.

“Senior granduncle!” Li Yifu greeted him respectfully.

Although Li Yifu was older than Xia ruofei’s grandfather, he had always been extremely respectful in front of Xia ruofei and put himself in a very proper position as his Grand – disciple. In fact, when he saw the caller ID, even if Xia ruofei was not in front of him, he would still stand up respectfully to answer the call.

“Foster husband, there’s something I need you to help me with!” Xia ruofei said directly.

“Martial granduncle, please give me your orders!” Li Yifu said respectfully.

“Help me purchase a batch of materials for the formation immediately. I’ll send you the list later!” Xia ruofei said,”most of these materials should be available on the market. If you can’t find any, report to me immediately!”

“Yes!” Li Yifu didn’t even ask what materials he wanted to buy, and he agreed without hesitation.

“Some of the materials may be more expensive. Do you have enough cash flow? I’ll transfer some money over?” Xia ruofei asked.

Although Li Yifu’s assets were much more than Xia ruofei ‘s, assets did not mean cash. In fact, a large company did not mean that it had abundant cash flow. That was why Xia ruofei asked.

“No need, no need. I have money.” Li Yifu said. He was afraid that Xia ruofei would not believe him, so he added,”there’s no problem with the three billion USD. You can withdraw it at any time.”

Hearing this, Xia ruofei was relieved. No matter how expensive the materials for Xuanji’s formation were, it would not cost as much as three billion US dollars. In fact, some materials were expensive mainly because they were precious metals. Their market price was relatively high, but it did not mean that they were precious in the world of cultivation. Otherwise, they could not be bought with money.

If these array materials were not handled by an array Dao expert, they would be worthless in the eyes of cultivators.

In fact, the most valuable thing was the knowledge of array Dao that array Dao experts had.

“Alright then! I won’t send you any money. ” Xia ruofei said.

It was not that he wanted to take advantage of his Grand – disciple, but compared to the value of the Taixu xuanqing formation, a little money from the secular world was nothing. If he were to tell Luo Qingfeng now that the natural array on the Paradise Island was the Taixu xuanqing array and that he was to exchange it for the star Seizer sect’s sect – protecting array, Luo Qingfeng would definitely agree without hesitation.

Once the formation was set up, Xia ruofei was prepared to let Li Yifu stay on the island to cultivate and help guard the place. If Li Yifu knew about this news, he would definitely be ecstatic. In comparison, what were tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars? Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Then, Xia ruofei said,”adopted husband, after you’ve purchased the materials, use the transport aircraft to transport them to an Island in the South Pacific Ocean. I’ll send you the coordinates and the map later. This time, you have to escort them personally. There must be no problems!”

Li Yifu also realized the importance of this matter, so he quickly said,””Yes! Don’t worry, senior granduncle! This disciple will definitely handle this matter beautifully!”

“Mm! I’ll have to trouble you this time!” Xia ruofei said,”I’ll be going to that Island too. If everything goes well, I’ll probably arrive earlier than you. Remember, you must keep this matter a secret. The purchases must be done in secret. It’s best to buy separately, and don’t let people trace it back to you. Also, during the transportation process, the scope of knowledge must be reduced as much as possible, and no one can know what the specific goods are. ”

“I understand! Martial granduncle, I will definitely be extremely careful!” Li Yifu replied excitedly.

He had always been the one receiving Xia ruofei’s favor. He was not capable enough and had no way to repay him. Today, he finally had the chance to help his senior granduncle with something. Furthermore, it was an extremely important matter. Li Yifu was naturally very excited. He was already so old that he even felt his blood boiling. He had the high – spirited spirit he had when he was young.

Xia ruofei said a few more words and then hung up.
