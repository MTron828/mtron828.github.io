2345 Strike_Most importantly, Mr. Liu’s condition was very critical. Before Xia ruofei’s intervention, his condition had been rapidly deteriorating. Now, not only did his condition not worsen, but it had improved to a certain extent. From the examination results, the tumor had even shrunk a little. This was undoubtedly a huge hope for the Liu family.

Elder Liu’s medicine was almost finished. If Xia ruofei delayed it for a few more days and stopped taking the medicine, no one could guarantee that his condition would not worsen again.

Liu Qunfeng wanted to worship Xia ruofei, so he could not understand why Liu Lifang would do something so stupid.

Liu Qunfeng thought for a moment and said,”it’s better to explain these things clearly, in case Mr. Xia has any misunderstandings about us.” Also ... My father misses you very much, Mr. Xia, and has mentioned you to me many times ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’m just a kid. What can I do?” Chief Liu, how about this! I still have some personal matters to deal with, and there are some things I have to personally take care of. I’ll take some time to visit elder Liu tomorrow or the day after. He really needs a follow – up. ”

Liu Qunfeng let out a sigh of relief and said,””Thank you, Mr. Xia! I won’t disturb you any longer! Let’s talk when we meet. ”

“Goodbye, chief Liu!” Xia ruofei said indifferently.

After Xia ruofei hung up the phone, he closed his eyes and sat in deep thought for a while. Then, he stood up and walked to his computer to open his email. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Xia ruofei did have some things to deal with these few days. Before he returned to the capital, he had rented a large warehouse in a secluded area in the suburbs through Zhao Yongjun. In addition, he had ordered a batch of supplies through the internet, which would arrive in a few days.

These resources included 30 mobile houses, a large number of labor tools, living supplies, and small construction equipment.

He was making preparations for the spirit map space to increase manpower in the future.

The reason why he rented a warehouse in the capital was that it was more convenient to transfer goods and place orders quickly. In addition, he might live here often in the future, so it would be much more convenient to have a warehouse with a transit function in the capital.

Zhao Yongjun had rented a bigger warehouse for him, and it was no problem to put all the supplies in.

Xia ruofei also asked him to send a reliable subordinate to guard the place and send a list of supplies to the man who was in charge of receiving the supplies.

When all the supplies had arrived, Xia ruofei would go over and put them all in the medium.

Of course, even though these things were complicated, Xia ruofei didn’t have to do much and it didn’t affect him from doing the follow – up for elder Liu.

However, he had heard from Dong Yun that things didn’t seem to be going well for the past few days. Although there wasn’t much resistance, there were always small problems.

Xia ruofei guessed that someone in the Liu family was stirring up trouble, so he took this opportunity to knock some sense into them. When he talked to Liu Qunfeng, he seemed to have casually mentioned taking over the pharmaceutical Group. He just wanted to see if Liu Qunfeng understood the hidden meaning.

If Liu Qunfeng made a move, the resistance would disappear, and everything would be fine.

If the situation at the pharmaceutical Group was still the same, then I’m sorry. A visit tomorrow and a visit the day after would still be a visit. Besides, Xia ruofei could really just visit the old man. After all, he didn’t say that he was going for a follow – up examination.
