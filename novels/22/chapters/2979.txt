2980 On – the – spot appraisal (1)

After more than ten minutes of fighting, the ownership of the two handwritten copies of the ‘the truth of glittering jewels’ that Xia ruofei had taken out on the spur of the moment was finally decided.

In the end, Hao Qingsong announced that the final price was 73500 spirit stones, setting a new high for the final price since the start of the auction.

And the person who won this item that made many golden core stage cultivators “hearts skip a beat was the cultivator from the sixth box’s flying flower Valley.

When Hao Qingsong announced the deal, Yang Liu, who had been clenching her fists the entire time, couldn’t help but cry out in excitement.

“I got it!” She said excitedly. Senior Sister! We’ve taken it! Perhaps the opportunity for Senior Sister to break through to the late – Stage of the Golden core realm lies in these two hand – written copies!”

Liu Mansha looked at the Willow, feeling touched. She said softly,””Thank you!”

Even though it was just two simple words, it contained too much gratitude.

“Don’t mention it, Senior Sister!”Yang Liu waved her hand. These two cultivation methods are not only beneficial to Senior sister’s cultivation, but also to all the cultivators of our flying flower Valley in the future. In terms of mental power cultivation, they will be on the fast track. Spending more than seventy thousand spirit stones to get them is very worth it!”

Yang Liu had already made it clear that she had a total of 50000 spirit stones in her private stash, and she would also contribute them to purchase these two hand – written copies. If Qianqian didn’t do this, then the soaring Flower Valley would have used up more than half of the 100000 spirit stones that they had prepared beforehand. The remaining 20000 spirit stones would mean that they had completely announced their withdrawal from the competition for that treasure. It was estimated that even the starting bid would be more than this.

If Yang Liu took out her own spirit stones, then there would be more than 70000 spirit stones left in the soaring Flower Valley. Although the competition would be much weaker, Liu Mansha herself also had many valuable treasures. If it really didn’t work, she could continue to participate in the auction by adding spirit stones and treasures. If she was lucky, the treasure she took out happened to be urgently needed by the person who entrusted it to the auction. Even if the spirit stones were a little less, the other party might still choose their soaring Flower Valley.

Liu Mansha smiled.”Junior Sister yang, let’s not celebrate too early. What if the ‘glittering jewel Wonderland’ is not real?”

“That means we’ve earned more than 700000 spiritual stones!” Yang Liu chuckled. This was a huge sum of money! I wonder if the star Seizer sect would be worth that many spirit stones if I sold it off ...”

“Since that young man dared to make such a bet, he must be confident!” Liu Mansha took a deep breath and said,”if I had a choice, I would rather not have 700000 spirit stones. I would also hope that their two handwritten copies of the ‘the true understanding of glittering jewels’ would be as good as the introduction just now.”

“Yup!” Willow also sighed with emotion.

Liu Mansha stood up and said with a smile, “Let’s go! The show is just beginning!”

In the eyes of all the cultivators who were participating in the auction, the bidding for the star Seizer sect’s two hand – held manuscripts had just ended. It was just the beginning, and the real highlight was yet to come.

Everyone was rather interested in the bet between the star Seizer sect and the spirit Vulture mountain.

It was a pity that because the cultivation technique transcript was very sensitive, it was impossible to verify it in front of everyone. Everyone was destined to wait for the final result.

The relevant personnel, including the cultivators of the spirit Vulture mountain and the cultivators of the flying flower Valley who had won the two hand – written manuscripts, all left their private rooms according to the agreement they had made in advance and headed towards room 20, where the star Seizer sect was located.

Xia ruofei and Luo Qingfeng were sitting on the fishing platform, calculating their gains while waiting for the arrival of Liu Mansha and the others.

The Three Treasures that were auctioned earlier had earned him a total of 39000 spiritual stones. However, Xia ruofei had spent another 6010 spiritual stones to bid for the mysterious ore, so he was left with about 33000 spiritual stones.

Since Xia ruofei had agreed to let the fallen leaves sect read the contents of the first volume for an hour, Shao Qingyang had generously expressed that he would no longer take a Commission for the sale of the two hand – held manuscripts. In this way, the 73500 spirit stones would be the pure profit.

In this way, Xia ruofei had around 106500 spiritual stones at his disposal.

In addition, after the bet, the spirit Vulture mountain had lost 50000 spiritual stones to them. In other words, Xia ruofei had more than 150000 spiritual stones at his disposal, which was more than the spiritual stones that many top sects had brought.

No matter what, there was no problem in competing for the storage ring.

Everyone was concerned about the final result of the bet between the spirit Vulture mountain and the star Seizer sect, so even the auction was temporarily suspended.

The host, the falling leaves sect’s sect leader Shao Qingyang, acted as a witness and personally brought the cultivators of the spirit Vulture mountain and the flying flower Valley to room number 20.

Liu Mansha and Yang Liu were the only ones from the soaring Flower Valley. They had met Xia ruofei once in the elevator. On the other hand, Luo Feng and Wu Ming were on the other side of the spirit Vulture mountain. This was the first time Xia ruofei had seen their true faces.

Luo Feng looked like a skinny old man in his sixties. He was dressed in a dark blue Daoist robe and his hair was a little white. However, his eyes were very sharp. As soon as he entered the room, he glanced at Xia ruofei. As the sect master of the star Seizer sect, Luo Qingfeng had naturally met Xia ruofei before. Hence, there was no need for an introduction. Luo Feng knew that the young man in front of him was ‘Xia Tian’ from the star Seizer sect.

Similarly, Wu Ming also glared at Xia ruofei fiercely. His eyes were about to spit fire.

However, Luo Feng must have warned him in advance, so even though they seemed to be at daggers drawn, there was no conflict between the two sides.

In the soaring Flower Valley, Liu Mansha glanced at Xia ruofei meaningfully the moment she entered the room. She had also noticed that there was one less person in the star Seizer sect’s private room. The oldest cultivator with the lowest cultivation level was gone.

Liu Mansha thought to herself,”could it be that they felt that they were in the limelight this time and let the low – Level cultivator leave first for safety?” This was a rather wise choice ...

Shao Qingyang chuckled as he made a brief introduction to both parties, then said,””Because of the bet between the star Seizer sect and the spirit Vulture mountain, and also to protect the interests of the fellow Daoist from the flying flower Valley, we now have to appraise the handwritten copy of the” true understanding of the glittering jewel. As the middleman, I still need to confirm the bet with both sides before we start. ”

Then, Shao Qingyang looked at Xia ruofei, Luo Feng, and the others and continued,””We’ll make a comparison according to the agreed method. If the final result is that the star Seizer sect’s handwritten copy is real, then the spirit Vulture mountain’s handwritten copy will be withdrawn from the auction and you’ll have to pay the star Seizer sect fifty thousand spirit stones. On the other hand, the deal between the star Seizer sect and the flying flower Valley would be nullified, and the star Seizer sect would have to compensate the flying flower Valley with 735000 spiritual stones. At the same time, they would have to hand over the formula for the gathering Qi pill to the spirit Vulture mountain. Are you all sure about this bet? Is there anything else you want to add?”

“No problem!” Xia ruofei nodded.

Liu Mansha smiled and said,”it seems that no matter what the outcome is, we’ll be standing on an undefeatable ground!” Our flying flower Valley will also have no problem!”

On the Ling Jue mountain’s side, Wu Ming’s eyes turned and he said,””I have something to add!”

Shao Qingyang’s brows twitched as he looked at Wu Ming and said in a friendly manner,””Please speak, sect leader Wu!”

Wu Ming looked at Xia ruofei proudly and said,””If the star Seizer sect loses, the formula they give us must be genuine and not tampered with in the slightest. Otherwise, if we bring back the wrong formula, it’ll be equivalent to a piece of waste paper!”

Xia ruofei replied without hesitation,”of course, we can guarantee that.” I can demonstrate to you once according to the formula and make the Qi gathering pills on the spot. I can guarantee that the average effect will be the same as the batch of Qi gathering pills at the opening auction. If you can’t even make it like this, then it’s a problem of skill, and it has nothing to do with my prescription!”

“Very good!” Luo Feng didn’t wait for Wu Ming to speak and said directly,”fellow Daoist Xia, you’re quite open and generous this time. Let’s do it this way!”

Xia ruofei smiled nonchalantly and thought,”It’s impossible for you to get that prescription, and everything you’ve said is just an illusion. What’s the harm in being generous?

“Do you have any other questions?” Shao Qingyang asked.

Luo Feng shook his head and said,”there’s no more. I have officially confirmed the bet on behalf of the Ling Jue mountain. We can begin the verification process now!”

Even though Liu Mansha and Yang Liu were veteran golden core cultivators, they couldn’t help but feel a little nervous at this time.

They were mainly worried about the personal gains and losses. They had very high hopes for these two handwritten copies. Just as Liu Mansha had said, they would rather not have 700000 spirit stones, because that would mean that the star picking sect ‘s’ true understanding of glittering jewels ‘was real.

“Now that the three parties have confirmed it, let’s begin the verification process!” Said Shao Qingyang. Because it involves the secret of my cultivation technique, I’ll take my leave first ...”

Xia ruofei waved his hand.”It’s fine. Sect leader Shao, please be a witness!”

Wu Ming objected the moment he heard this. He said loudly,””How can we do that? Our “the glittering jewel Wonderland” is a secret that can not be passed on!”

Xia ruofei smiled and took out a set of talismans from the space. He waved his hand and scattered them. He immediately set up a barrier that covered everyone.

“Elder Luo,” Xia ruofei said,”you can go outside the boundary and try to see if your spiritual power can spy on the situation inside the boundary.”

Luo Feng walked out doubtfully and released his spiritual force to probe. He realized that the barrier that Xia ruofei had casually set up was extremely tough. It seemed to have formed a naturally balanced field without any weak points. It could be said that the barrier against spiritual force had been done to the extreme.

Luo Feng immediately understood Xia ruofei’s intention to ask Shao Qingyang to be a witness. Standing outside the boundary, he could see the situation inside the boundary with his naked eyes, but he could not use his spiritual power to spy on the contents of the handwritten book.

...

This barrier was so tough that even an Aurous core stage cultivator would find it difficult to break through it.

Moreover, if Shao Qingyang were to forcefully use his mental power to destroy the wizardry barrier, everyone would naturally be able to discover it.

In this way, it was indeed possible to have Shao Qingyang as a witness without leaking the secret.

Luo Feng couldn’t help but look at Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei was so confident. Could he really guarantee that he would win? Furthermore ... This kid was so young, but his attainments in the array Dao were really not bad! The array talismans used to set up the barrier might have been given by the elders in the sect, but the technique of setting up the array could not be given by the elders in the sect. Xia ruofei set up the array with a wave of his hand, and it was obvious that he was very familiar with it.

Luo Feng’s heart couldn’t help but beat like a drum, and the confidence he had in the beginning also began to waver ...
