Chapter 1796: At all costs (2)

Then, he returned to the small villa.

Feng Jing and the others felt that it was strange. Xia ruofei had always given them the impression that he was full of energy, which was rare. Of course, as the boss, Xia ruofei gave himself a half – day break after a long – distance flight. No one would say anything, and no one would come to the small villa to disturb him.

The villa’s cleaning company would arrange for people to clean it regularly, including the Veterans from the security Department who would feed Blackie and the red Arowana in the house. Hence, the place was no different from when Xia ruofei had left a month ago.

Xia ruofei was not in the mood to play with Blackie and the rest who were happily circling around him. He patted their heads and walked straight into the villa.

He quickly went upstairs with a sullen face and locked himself in his room. He took out the spirit map scroll and entered the medium.

“Master!” Xia Qing called out respectfully.

“En!” Xia ruofei nodded and went straight to the point.”You know about Qingxue’s condition. Is there any way to change her Constitution so that she can cultivate?”

When Xia ruofei was examining Ling Qingxue at the beach, he had specially communicated with Xia Qing using his divine thoughts. Hence, Xia Qing was also aware of Ling Qingxue’s condition.

Xia Qing said,”master, it’s more complicated to change one’s Constitution ... Everyone’s Constitution is different. Some people’s meridians are naturally stronger, some are weaker, and some people are even born with blocked meridians. Of course, if their meridians are blocked, they’re basically useless people, and it’s impossible for them to cultivate.”

Xia ruofei nodded and quietly waited for Xia Qing to continue.

He had examined Ling Qingxue’s condition. Although her physique was not suitable for cultivation, it was not to the extent that her meridians were blocked. In fact, if her meridians were really blocked, such a person would have died early.

Xia Qing continued,”actually, the problem with her meridians is not the main issue. The effect of the acquired improvement is still very significant. Although miss Ling’s meridians are not very strong, they have reached an above average level ...”

“En!” Xia ruofei nodded.

He knew very well that Ling Qingxue’s main problem wasn’t her meridians.

Xia Qing said,”in fact, the most important factor that determines whether a person has the talent for cultivation is still the soul. Some people are born with a strong affinity with spiritual energy, so their cultivation will naturally be twice as effective with half the effort. And some people, even if they try their best, can’t sense the existence of spiritual energy, so they naturally can’t cultivate. And what determines the affinity with spiritual energy is a person’s soul.”

Speaking of this, Xia Qing paused and said,””But it’s quite difficult to change the nature of the soul ...”

Xia ruofei frowned and asked,”even the heart – concentrating grass won’t work?”

The reason why Song Wei’s cultivation speed was so fast was not only because of her talent, but also because Xia ruofei had used a precious heart – concentrating herb to save her. This had greatly improved her cultivation talent.

Xia Qing said,”the heart – concentrating grass can naturally have a certain effect on improving one’s cultivation talent. It’s just that I don’t know to what extent this effect will reach. On the other hand ... Master, we no longer have the heart – concentrating grass in our spirit map world ...”

Xia ruofei’s expression darkened. In order to save song Wei, he had upgraded the spirit map space by two levels at all costs. A small island had appeared in the mountain and sea realm, and the only heart concentrating grass had been picked from that small island.

“Wait!” Xia ruofei called out,”Xia Qing, the heart concentrating grass has only been picked for use. I remember you saying that as long as there is enough time, it can still grow back! Is that so?”

Xia ruofei remembered that he had described it as harvesting leeks.

“You’re right,” Xia Qing nodded.”But the heart – concentrating grass takes more than ten years to mature. Master obviously can’t wait that long.”

Xia ruofei asked urgently,”don’t we have time acceleration?” If we transplant the heart condensing grass to the Archean realm and stack the time array flags, it will only take two to three days to complete a dozen years!”

After Xia ruofei finished speaking, he saw Xia Qing’s strange expression and couldn’t help but ask,””Right, I’ve always wanted to ask you! Why were those spirit herbs and herbs planted on small islands in the mountain sea realm and not in the Archean realm? There’s a time acceleration of thirty times there!”

Xia Qing forced a smile and said,”master, there must be a reason for this!” If it was possible to simply use the time – accelerating formation to plant large amounts of aged spiritual herbs, my previous master, immortal mountain river, would have done so long ago ...”

“What’s the problem?”Xia ruofei asked, frowning.

Ordinary crops, including agarwood and ginseng, could be planted in the Archean realm to enjoy the benefits of time acceleration. Why couldn’t those spiritual herbs and herbs be planted? Xia ruofei could not understand.

“Spiritual Qi!” Xia Qing said. It was mainly because of the spiritual energy! For these spirit herbs and grass to grow, the amount of spirit Qi they require far exceeds that of ordinary crops. The reason why they can only be planted in the mountain and sea realm is because the spirit map world can recover on its own at this level of consumption of spirit Qi. However, if they are planted in the Archean realm, the total amount of spirit Qi required for the growth of the spirit herbs will remain the same, but the rate of consumption will increase by thirty times. The spirit map world will not be able to absorb and transform enough spirit Qi to support the growth of the spirit herbs, and it will definitely damage its Foundation!”

Xia Qing paused and looked at Xia ruofei,””Master, it’s the same principle as when I reminded you not to cultivate in the spirit map world for long periods of time. If we do as you say and add the time array flags, it’ll be equivalent to consuming more than ten years “worth of spirit Qi in these three or four days. The spirit map world definitely can’t replenish it in time. Such a large amount of spirit Qi will be consumed so quickly that it may even cause the entire spirit map world to collapse!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be in a daze. So this was the reason.

In the past, no matter if it was his cultivation or planting other crops, the amount of spiritual energy he consumed was nothing compared to the spiritual energy needed for a spiritual herb like the heart concentrating grass to mature. So as long as he did not cultivate in the space without restraint, there would be no problem no matter what he did.

However, if he rashly transplanted the heart condensing grass into an Archean realm expert, there would be a huge problem!

“Is there no other way?” Xia ruofei’s expression turned ugly.

He had already found out that Ling Qingxue’s affinity with spirit Qi was very low. If he wanted to forcefully change her Constitution and let her embark on the path of cultivation, the heart concentrating grass was a must.

Was he going to make Ling Qingxue wait for more than ten years? This was definitely not realistic.

“Master, if you don’t mind the price, it’s not impossible to accelerate the ripening of the heart – concentrating grass with time ...” Xia Qing said after hesitating for a moment.

“What is the price?” Xia ruofei quickly asked.

“Spirit crystals!” Xia Qing said,”the only way is to set up a spirit gathering array and consume the spiritual Qi of the spirit crystals for the heart concentrating grass. This way, the spiritual Qi in the spirit map world will not be affected.”

“Yeah!” Xia ruofei’s eyes brightened and he said,”can’t we just use spiritual crystals? Xia Qing, it’s not a good habit of yours to speak halfway! He had to change it in the future! Why are you hiding such a good idea? you should have said it from the start ...”

Seeing Xia Qing’s strange expression, Xia ruofei’s excited expression also froze. He asked weakly,””Did it consume a lot of energy?”

“That’s right.” Xia Qing nodded and said,”it takes all the spiritual Qi contained in at least five spiritual crystals for a heart concentrating grass to ripen ...”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but take a deep breath. The amount of spiritual Qi in a spiritual crystal was quite terrifying. Basically, the spiritual Qi in a spiritual crystal was equivalent to the total amount of spiritual Qi in the entire spirit map space.

He only had a little over 100 spiritual crystals in total!

A hundred crystals might seem like a lot, but it would be consumed very quickly. Xia ruofei was not cultivating alone. He had given one to Tang Haoran, one to Song Wei, and half of the last one to himself. In the future, if Ling Qingxue were to cultivate, he would at least give her some crystals. He might even give his Grand – disciple Li Yifu from the United States some crystals in the future.

How long could 100 spiritual crystals last for so many people? RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Xia ruofei had been cultivating for so long and had not even used up a single spiritual crystal, but it actually took him five spiritual crystals to grow a small plant! It was no wonder that perfected mountain river did not dare to plant those spirit herbs in the Archean realm ...

However, Xia ruofei did not hesitate and said,””Five then! Xia Qing, immediately set up a spirit gathering array and then move the heart condensing grass to the Archean realm! I want to see a mature heart condensing grass in a few days!”
