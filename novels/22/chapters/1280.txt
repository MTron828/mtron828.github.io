Translator: 549690339

“Director Guo, thank you for your kindness, but I really appreciate it ...” Xia ruofei said with a bitter smile.

Guo Hongjiang opened his mouth, but Xia ruofei stopped him and continued,””Director Guo, I don’t know anything about horse racing. If you give me the ‘star of Hong Kong,’ that’s what I call a Pearl casting into the dark! In addition, the horses have to be transported back to the mainland, and all kinds of customs procedures are very troublesome. Moreover ... I heard that the daily cost of raising a horse is sky – High, I can’t afford it!”

Then, Xia ruofei chuckled and said,””So, you should keep such a good horse for yourself! I don’t have the Fortune to enjoy it!”

“Mr. Xia, this is not a difficult thing to do. After the star of Hong Kong is transferred to you, you can continue to live in my horse training base and all the expenses will be on me!” Said Guo Hongjiang. And it can continue to compete in the future. Such a good horse will definitely earn you a lot of medals!”

“Don ‘t!” Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”director Guo, I know that the ‘star of Hong Kong’ is your favorite. A gentleman should not take someone else’s love! No matter what you say, I will never accept this horse!”

MA Xiong admired Guo Hongjiang’s courage. He could guess that Guo Hongjiang had intentionally befriended Xia ruofei after witnessing his miraculous skills.

Even so, it had to be said that Guo Hongjiang was quite generous to be able to give away a high – Quality horse that was worth at least tens of millions of Hong Kong.

“Director Guo,” MA Xiong chuckled.”Since Xia Sheng has put it this way, I don’t think you’ll be able to give your horse away today!”

Guo Hongjiang looked at MA Xiong and smiled bitterly.”Chairman MA, why do I feel like you’re gloating over my misfortune?”

“Did I?” MA Xiong turned to Xia ruofei and asked with a smile,”is it really that obvious?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said nothing, while Guo Hongjiang said in a bad mood,””It’s quite obvious!”

MA Xiong couldn’t help but burst out laughing.

Xia ruofei was determined not to accept it, so Guo Hongjiang had no choice but to take the document back.

However, he had already expected this situation, so he had already prepared a backup plan.

The Butler, who had been waiting on them, immediately came forward and handed over another folder. At the same time, he took back the horse transfer document.

“Mr. Xia, since you don’t want the ‘star of Hong Kong’, you can’t reject my gift anymore!” Guo Hongjiang passed the folder to Xia ruofei and said with a smile,”Mr. Xia, you still have to give me a chance to express my gratitude!”

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly. These rich people were really generous! He gave away a high – Quality horse that was worth tens of millions without even blinking. Xia ruofei was shocked when he saw the transfer of ownership.

And in all fairness, he did have a moment of impulse.

However, he also knew that it was not appropriate for him to accept the “star of Hong Kong”.

This was like an expensive sports car breaking down, and an experienced mechanic just happened to repair the sports car successfully, and then the owner of the sports car gave the car to the mechanic as a gift of thanks. No matter how you thought about it, it was a bit ridiculous.

No matter how great the favor of curing the star of Hong Kong was, could it be more valuable than the star of Hong Kong himself?

If there was, then there must be something else in the favor, which Xia ruofei was not willing to accept.

Hence, when Xia ruofei rejected her, his attitude was very firm.

Xia ruofei was curious about Guo Hongjiang’s gift, so he quickly reached out and took the folder.

He flipped it open and saw that it was also a transfer agreement.

This time, it was no longer the “star of Hong Kong”, but a penthouse apartment located on Repulse Bay Road.

Xia ruofei took a quick look at the information and was shocked.

It was written that the building area was 1788 square feet. Xia ruofei quickly said,””Director Guo, stop joking. How can I accept such an expensive gift?”

MA Xiong’s gossiping heart was burning as he asked curiously,”Xia Sheng, what did director Guo give you this time? Quickly tell me!”

Xia ruofei said,”see for yourself!” I really can’t accept it, it’s too expensive ...” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

MA Xiong opened the document and glanced at it. He laughed and said,”It seems like director Guo is very sincere today!”

“Mr. Xia, I don’t have any other intentions. I just want to thank you for saving the life of the ‘star of Hong Kong’. I, Guo Hongjiang, would like to be your friend!” I’ve left this house unused all this time, so giving it to Mr. Xia would be making the best use of it!”

Xia ruofei said,”director Guo, if you really want to thank me, change it to a gift of a reasonable value!” How would I dare to accept such a luxurious mansion?”

“Xia Sheng, I think you should accept it!” MA Xiong chuckled.

“Mr. Xia, even Chairman MA has said so, you should just accept it! This is just a small token of my appreciation, nothing else!” Guo Hongjiang said.

“Chairman MA, you’ve finally said something fair today. You didn’t add insult to injury. Not bad!” He turned to MA Xiong.

Xia ruofei ignored the banter between his two old friends. He shook his head at MA Xiong and said,””Old Mr. MA, don’t join in the jeering! You’ve seen the document, it’s a mansion that’s close to 2000 square meters!”

“A mansion?” MA Xiong was stunned for a moment. This ... It’s definitely considered a mansion for ordinary people, but it’s just average for director Guo’s property!”

Guo Hongjiang also nodded his head repeatedly, promptly expressing that he did not like this house.

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly.”It’s nothing compared to director Guo’s Manor, of course. But you’ve seen the document. It’s a house of nearly 2000 square meters!” The house price in Hong Kong was so high, and it was in the qianshui Bay where every inch of land was worth its weight in gold. This ... The value of this house was probably enough to buy a few ‘stars of Hong Kong’! How can I accept it?”

MA Xiong and Guo Hongjiang were both stunned. Then, they looked at each other and could not help but laugh.

Xia ruofei was confused and couldn’t help but ask,””What’s going on? Both of you are highly respected Hong Kong celebrities, don’t keep me in suspense!”

MA Xiong chuckled and said,”Xia Sheng, you might have misunderstood. The area of this house is 1788 square feet. Note that it’s a square foot, not the ‘square meter’ that you people in the mainland use. There’s a big difference!”

Xia ruofei was stunned as well. He flipped open the document and saw that it was indeed written in square feet. As the document used traditional Chinese characters and Xia ruofei lived in the mainland all year round, he subconsciously thought that the unit of measurement for the area was square feet.

“Then ... How many square meters is this?” Xia ruofei asked awkwardly.

As a real estate tycoon, Guo Hongjiang’s real estate Group had developed many projects in the mainland, so he was quite familiar with the conversion between the two units.

“Mr. Xia, it’s actually about 167 square meters. It’s a very small house!” He quickly gave an answer.

Xia ruofei looked at Guo Hongjiang suspiciously. He felt that Guo Hongjiang’s words might not be reliable, so he took out his mobile phone and searched online.

It turned out that it was true. A square foot was just a square foot, and the unit of foot was based on King John’s footprints, which was about 30 centimeters. One square meter was equivalent to 10.7 square feet.

After some conversion, this 1788 square feet house was about 167 square meters.

What was more interesting was that the so – called ” 1000 – foot mansion” often seen in Hong Kong TV series was actually only about 100 square meters, which was a small apartment in the mainland.

In Hong Kong, where every inch of land was worth its weight in gold, housing prices were the most expensive in the world, even higher than in New York, United States

Most people couldn’t afford to live in such a “thousand – foot mansion.”

Guo Hongjiang was not in a hurry. After Xia ruofei was done with the investigation, he laughed and asked,””Mr. Xia, I didn’t lie to you, did I? It’s really just a small house. It’s just a little token of my appreciation, please accept it!”
