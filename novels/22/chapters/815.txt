The Mercedes – Benz slowly slid to a stop in front of Xia ruofei. President Lin took the initiative to open the door and extended his hand to Xia ruofei enthusiastically.”President Xia!”

Xia ruofei shook hands with President Lin and smiled.””President Lin, you’ve had a long journey!”

An old man with white hair got out of the car from the other side. Xia ruofei was no stranger to him. He was old Chinese medicine doctor Huang from Qiantang Tongren Hall. He was in charge of the appraisal of the wild ginseng that Xia ruofei sold to Tongren Hall. It was obvious why CEO Lin had brought him along.

President Lin had also arranged for a few employees to come over to receive the iron – skinned Dendrobium, but he had taken the plane here with Dr. Huang first. The employees had driven a small truck and would probably only arrive in the evening.

“Mr. Xia, how are you?” Dr. Huang also greeted Xia ruofei with enthusiasm.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded at the two of them.””President Lin, our iron – Skin maple bucket is just ready. Do you think ...”

“President Xia, there’s no rush for the iron Kaede fight.” Mr. Lin said impatiently,”we ... Would like to take a look at the wild ginseng you have.”

As for the tin can, both parties had signed a supply agreement. Besides, the quality of the tin can provided by Xia ruofei had always been the best, so he didn’t care about the tin can at all. All he could think about was the wild ginseng.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””That’s fine, follow me then!”

Xia ruofei gestured for Qin Xiaojun and the rest to store the metal bucket safely. Then, he led President Lin and doctor Huang to the general office building.

When the three of them arrived at Xia ruofei’s office, Xia ruofei took out two long paper boxes from the safe at the corner behind his desk. The boxes contained the wild ginseng that he had dug out from the origin space.

It was only after Xia ruofei had dealt with the wild ginseng yesterday that Jian Jia, who had put it in the safe, seemed to care about it. At the same time, it was a normal behavior! Otherwise, it would be too abnormal for a million – Yuan rare wild ginseng to be placed in an unlocked drawer.

When CEO Lin saw the paper box, he was like a cat that smelled fish. His eyes lit up. Xia ruofei smiled and placed the paper box on the coffee table. CEO Lin couldn’t wait to open one of them. Dr. Huang naturally picked up the other one.

Xia ruofei sat on his office chair, calm and unruffled. He was very confident in his product.

President Lin and Dr. Huang looked at each other for a while, and then they whispered to each other.

Finally, President Lin smiled at Xia ruofei and said,””Brother Xia, the quality of these two old ginsengs is as good as ever! Our Tongren Hall is very sincere in purchasing. What do you think ... We can sell two wild ginsengs together for a total of 5.8 million?”

This price was more than one million Yuan higher than Xia ruofei’s first sale price. However, this was normal. After all, the first time Xia ruofei took the initiative to sell the wild ginseng to Tongren Hall, CEO Lin must have considered the profits of the party more. Now, under the situation of ensuring a certain amount of profit, he had to curry favor with Xia ruofei as much as possible. Naturally, the strategy of bidding was different.

At the same time, the ginsengs in the interspace had reproduced for many generations. The largest one would definitely reach the level of a shocking ginseng King. The two ginsengs that Xia ruofei randomly chose were bigger than the two he sold to Tongren Hall.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””This price is quite fair. Let’s do as you say, President Lin!” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

President Lin was overjoyed. He held Xia ruofei’s hand tightly and said excitedly,””Thank you! Thank you! Thank you, brother Xia!”

President Lin immediately took out the contract that he had prepared in advance from his briefcase, then filled in the amount written in capital. For such a large transaction, a transfer agreement had to be signed every time.

After both parties signed, CEO Lin immediately called the financial Officer at Qian Tang and told him to transfer 5.8 million Yuan to Xia ruofei’s personal account immediately. Xia ruofei did not plan to use the company’s account for the wild ginseng transaction as he needed to keep some money in his personal account in case of emergencies. As for the company’s current financial situation, it was very healthy. If there was a temporary shortage of funds, Xia ruofei would just inject it in at the last minute.

Normally, President Lin would not be able to transfer such a huge amount of money with just a phone call. However, Xia ruofei was an important partner of Tongren Hall and President Lin’s status in the head office had also risen. Hence, no one could say anything.

It would take some time for the finance department to transfer the money to the bank, so Xia ruofei invited Mr. Lin and Dr. Huang to sit down at the coffee table. He took out his precious Da Hong Pao tea leaves and started to make tea personally.

Now, Xia ruofei was no longer the newbie who knew nothing about the Way of Tea. His movements were skillful and smooth, and soon the office was filled with the tempting fragrance of tea.

President Lin and Dr. Huang couldn’t help but take a deep breath. When they had a taste of the top – grade Da Hong Pao, they couldn’t help but praise it.

President Lin had tried many good teas, but they were nothing compared to Xia ruofei’s Da Hong Pao.

President Lin couldn’t help but sigh,”President Xia, I only realized after drinking your tea that the tea I drank in the past can’t be called tea.” They’re just rotten leaves!”

Xia ruofei smiled faintly.”If you like it, you can bring some back. However, the production of these tea leaves is very small. I can only give you a little to try. I can’t take out more.”
