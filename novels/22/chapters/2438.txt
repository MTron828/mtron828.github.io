2439 The heaven jade talisman (2)

So, he strolled to the backyard, ready to find something to eat in the kitchen.

However, he was discovered by Wu Qiang as soon as he appeared in the backyard. When he found out that Xia ruofei was looking for food, Wu Qiang quickly called his sister – in – Law, Wu Xiujuan, out.

Wu Xiujuan immediately went to the kitchen to prepare food for Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei didn’t want to trouble everyone, but he couldn’t help but smile bitterly at the scene. Fortunately, it wasn’t too late. Wu Qiang and the others hadn’t rested yet, so it wasn’t too much trouble.

Xia ruofei asked Wu Xiujuan to prepare some light side dishes and some plain porridge.

After slurping down two bowls of hot porridge, Xia ruofei felt much better.

He bade Wu Qiang and the others farewell and returned to his courtyard.

Although he had taken a shower before entering the medium, the clothes he had just changed into were drenched in sweat when he unlocked the heaven jade talisman. At this moment, his body was also sticky.

Hence, Xia ruofei immediately went to take a shower before returning to the bedroom. He laid on the bed and studied the heaven jade talisman, carefully studying the formation patterns on it.

However, Xia ruofei did not try to carve it immediately. He only studied it for a while and had a general understanding of the array pattern on the Jade talisman. He also had a direct understanding of the difficulty of carving it. Then, he put the heaven jade talisman into the spirit map space and lay down to have a good sleep.

The next day, Xia ruofei had planned to start trying to carve the array pattern of the “heaven” jade talisman at home. However, he received a call from manager Lu early in the morning, saying that elder song wanted to see him.

Xia ruofei guessed that it was about Liu haojun, so he immediately agreed.

He didn’t let Wu Qiang drive, but drove the Land Rover to the song family’s old house.

Although Xia ruofei’s car often entered and left the song family’s house, he was stopped twice by the security guards for inspection and verification. He was only allowed to pass after confirming his identity.

Furthermore, Xia ruofei could clearly feel that the security around the song family’s residence had increased. He knew that this might be a chain reaction caused by song Qiming’s assassination. Especially when he knew that the mastermind behind this was a direct descendant of the Liu family, elder song would naturally be more alert and arrange for more people to protect him.

Soon, Xia ruofei saw elder song in the dining room of the song family’s old residence.

The old man was used to waking up early, but he would always arrange a certain morning exercise program. After the morning exercise, he would take a break to read the latest newspapers and documents before having breakfast.

Elder song saw Xia ruofei and asked with a smile,””Ruofei, have you had breakfast?”

Xia ruofei grinned and said,”I was just about to get up and eat!” Manager Lu called me ...”

Manager Lu couldn’t help but laugh when he saw this. He personally got up and took a set of cutlery from the side and said,””Then come over and eat! Wouldn’t it be better to have Breakfast with the Chief?”

Xia ruofei didn’t pretend to be polite. He sat on the seat to the left of elder song and took a sip of milk. Then, he grabbed two pieces of bread, added bacon to it, and started eating.

Elder song was happy that Xia ruofei did not regard him as an outsider.

He was almost done eating but he was not in a hurry to get up. Instead, he smiled as he watched Xia ruofei eat.

Of course, Xia ruofei did not treat this place as his own home. He ate his breakfast slowly. He quickly ate some bread and drank a glass of milk. Then, he used a napkin to wipe his mouth and said,”Grandpa song, I’m done!”

Elder song nodded, and manager Lu immediately motioned for the service staff to come and clean up the dishes.

Xia ruofei and elder song sat at the table and chatted. Manager Lu, after instructing the service staff to clean the table, found an excuse to leave. The others naturally left as well.

“You should’ve heard the news, right?” elder song asked. Liu haojun is dead. ”

Xia ruofei nodded calmly and said,””The news spread all over the capital yesterday. If he died, then he died! He’s asking for it, and he deserves it!”

Eccentric song nodded. He naturally wouldn’t care much about the life and death of a junior from an opposing family.

Eccentric song revealed a profound smile.”The Liu family is making an announcement to the world ...”

Elder song then looked at Xia ruofei and asked,””Ruofei, you’ve been in contact with old Liu many times. What do you think of him? What do you think of him?”

Xia ruofei replied without thinking,”a formidable person!”

“You’re quite direct!”Eccentric song laughed. How do you know?”

“That person from the Liu family is able to reach such a high position, so he naturally has very strong abilities.” Xia ruofei said,”and his style of doing things is very distinctive. Everything he does is for his family’s benefit.”

At this point, Xia ruofei revealed a strange expression and said,””But ... I think this kind of person is quite scary! In the face of the family’s interests, he could sacrifice anything. In his eyes, it might only be the size of the interests. There was nothing that could not be sacrificed. If there was, it was because the benefits that could bring him were not enough. Besides, if even family ties are gone, then what’s the point of living?” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Your evaluation of old Liu is quite accurate, ruofei,” laughed elder song. We’ve known each other since we were young, so I know him quite well. He’s been like this since he was young. ”

Speaking of this, eccentric song couldn’t help but reveal a trace of nostalgia, sighing,”However, this characteristic of his was actually quite good in that era, especially when he worked in the Army. In the face of the ever – changing battlefield environment, he needed to quickly make the most favorable judgment for his side. There are very few people who can be as calm as him and directly sacrifice the soldiers he has led for many years. Thus, he also had outstanding military achievements at that time!”

Xia ruofei nodded in agreement and continued,””Maybe ... But at least in this era, such a person is a little scary ... The day you went to the Liu family, I talked to the old man ... He’s really ... Terrifyingly calm!”

“Let’s not talk about this!”Elder song laughed. Ruofei, I called you here because of Liu haojun. After all, the news you got was only hearsay, while my source is more reliable, so I can confirm for you that Liu haojun is indeed dead. ”

Xia ruofei nodded and waited for elder song to continue.

“There’s one more thing,”elder song continued,” about the treatment you gave old Liu ... I know you’ve been controlling his recovery speed. Otherwise, with your abilities, he would have been alive and kicking by now! When I saw him at the Liu family’s house that day, he still looked sickly. I knew ...”

“Grandpa song, I don’t have that kind of ability.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it’s mainly because old master Liu’s condition is very complicated and it’s a dangerous pancreatic tumor. Naturally, he won’t recover so quickly.”

Elder song smiled and said,”actually, I just wanted to remind you that it’s okay to delay the treatment process a little, but don’t make it too obvious. Otherwise, not only will the Liu family not be grateful, but they might even hate you. And in the end, you still have to cure him. When that time comes ...”

Elder song knew that Xia ruofei had been delaying the treatment to fight for the song family’s interests.

This time, the Liu family was caught off guard by the Liu haojun incident. The song family had already gained a lot from this incident, but the Liu family had suffered heavy losses and even lost a direct descendant like Liu haojun. The Liu family would definitely not be in a good mood. They might not bite anyone, but it was very likely that they would vent their anger on Xia ruofei.

Therefore, elder song felt that he needed to let Xia ruofei know so that he wouldn’t be treated badly.
