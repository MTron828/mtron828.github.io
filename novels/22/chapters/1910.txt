Chapter 1911 Solid proof (3)

Xia ruofei nodded.”If we’re dealing with an average person, this move would be enough. But our target is Liu haojun. I’m afraid this won’t hurt him much!”

“Yeah!” Xu Yougang nodded. “If you have enough connections in the publicity system, it’s not difficult to block the information on the internet. The internet Control is very mature now, and the official technology is very advanced. As long as the higher – ups pay attention, it’s not difficult to clean up the entire internet ...”

“Yes, that’s a very important reason.” Xia ruofei said,”there’s one more thing. These videos have seriously crossed the line of the law. If they are not dealt with and are put on the internet, it is illegal in itself. If we do something about it, the exposé will not achieve the effect we want ...”

“Yup!” Xu Yougang said,”boss, can we send this information to the relevant departments in the city and province through the official reporting channel?”

Xia ruofei shook his head and said,”it’s not that I don’t have confidence in our party Committee and government. From an official point of view, they definitely don’t want things to get out of hand. Even if they want to deal with it, it’ll be done internally. With the Liu family’s power, this kind of style problem will probably be reduced to a small one.” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Do you have any better ideas, boss?” Xu Yougang asked. He felt that he was at his wit’s end. He had no problem in fighting and killing, but he felt that his brain was not enough to use to trick people.

Xia ruofei furrowed his brows and thought for a long time before asking,””Regarding Fang Chenchen’s situation, have you done any relevant investigations? Especially about her family. ”

Xu Yougang immediately said,”we’ve done some investigations. The current situation is like this. Her husband’s name is Liu Dong. He’s an engineer in the Environmental Protection Bureau of the Bell Tower District. He’s a technical staff and a career editor.” “They have a four – year – old daughter who is in a small class at beilei kindergarten in the Bell Tower District. Most of the time, Fang Chenchen’s mother – in – Law is taking care of the child. However, her mother-in-law’s heart hasn’t been in good condition recently and she’s recuperating at home, so Liu Dong is the one who takes her to and from school ...”

“How much do you know about Liu Dong?” Xia ruofei nodded and asked.

Xu Yougang was a little embarrassed and said,””Boss, due to our limited manpower, we’ve only been working with Liu haojun and Fang Chenchen. As for Liu Dong, we’ve only gotten some surface information. He seems honest, but we don’t have any more detailed information on his personality and social relations ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”that’s normal. There are only four of you in total. Moreover, the time is so short. How about this?” I need detailed information on him. I feel that if we want to make this matter influential enough, this Liu Dong should be the key!”

“Yes!” Xu Yougang stood up and said, just like how he did when he received a mission in the Army.

Xia ruofei smiled and pressed his hand down.””Sit, sit, sit! Now that we’re done with business, let’s sit down and have some tea! In addition, I’ve also said last time that in addition to the remuneration I promised you, I’ll treat you to a vacation after this matter is over! He could choose any location in the country! All the expenses will be covered by the company! When you have free time these few days, you can also discuss and see where you want to go ...”
