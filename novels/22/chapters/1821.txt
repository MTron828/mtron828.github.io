Naturally, Xia ruofei did not mind that it was only half a day. He reminded Ling Qingxue over the phone to be careful not to overwork herself. The two of them chatted sweetly for a while before hanging up.

At noon, Xia ruofei had a meal in the canteen.

After returning to the villa, Xia ruofei took out a lot of Taoyuan vegetables and other ingredients from the space and put them in the refrigerator.

He would have to live with Ling Qingxue for the next few days, so he definitely couldn’t bring Ling Qingxue to eat in the cafeteria! Since he was going to cook, Xia ruofei might as well prepare the ingredients in advance. Otherwise, it would be inconvenient for him to take things out of the interspace when Ling Qingxue arrived.

In the afternoon, he stayed in the office for a while more. When it was almost time to get off work, Xia ruofei received a call from Ling Qingxue. She had already set off from the city to Taoyuan farm.

Hence, Xia ruofei also packed his things and got up. He first went to Feng Jing’s office and greeted her. He told her that Ling Qingxue would be coming over to stay at the farm for a few days and that he would not be coming to the company for the next few days if he had nothing to do. He would only appear on the day of the relocation. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

When she heard that Ling Qingxue was coming to spend the night with Xia ruofei, Feng Rao could not help but feel a little disappointed. However, she concealed her emotions very well and even half – jokingly blamed Xia ruofei for not working for two days and starting to be a shirking boss again.

Xia ruofei chatted with Feng Jing for a while. It was time to get off work, so the two of them went downstairs.

Feng Rao went to the company’s cafeteria to eat while Xia ruofei went back to the villa to prepare dinner.

Ling Qingxue drove to Taoyuan farm. The old soldier on duty at the gate recognized the car, so he let her in. She drove into the villa’s yard without any obstructions.

When Ling Qingxue entered the villa, Xia ruofei, who was wearing an apron, was carrying a dish out of the kitchen.

After seeing Ling Qingxue, Xia ruofei smiled and said,””You’re quite fast! I’ll put the things aside for a while before tidying up. I’ll wash my hands first! There’s also soup, and dinner is ready!”

Ling Qingxue looked at Xia ruofei and the steaming hot food on the dining table. A sense of family warmth arose spontaneously. She placed her luggage in the corner of the living room and rolled up her sleeves as she said with a smile,””RUO Fei, I’ll help you!”

Xia ruofei quickly placed the plate of steamed beluga on the table and said,””You’d better not interfere, or you’ll be scalded! Go wash your hands and watch TV for a while! There was only the fish head tofu soup left in the pot, which would be ready to eat very soon! I don’t need your help with anything!”

Ling Qingxue wrinkled her nose and said,””I want to cook with you! Don’t tell me you don’t trust my cooking skills? We’re a family of chefs, okay?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”of course not!” Dinner is almost done! You’re still afraid that you won’t have a chance to cook with me? You can even personally cook for the next few days! I’ll be your assistant!”

Ling Qingxue then revealed a cute smile and said,””You’re the head chef! I ... I didn’t get my father’s true teachings ...”

Xia ruofei almost laughed out loud. He knew about Ling Qingxue’s culinary skills. Even though Ling Xiaotian’s culinary skills were exceptional, Ling Qingxue clearly did not inherit this talent. Furthermore, the Ling family was also a wealthy family. They had no worries about food and clothing since they were young. The daughter had only inherited her father’s business when it came to company management. As for culinary skills, Ling Xiaotian had not really given Ling Qingxue much guidance.

However, Xia ruofei knew that he could not laugh. Otherwise, Ling Qingxue would fly into a rage.

He nodded and said in all seriousness,”alright, I’ll listen to you!” You should wash your hands first!”

“En!” Ling Qingxue nodded her head and obediently went to wash her hands.

Xia ruofei finally heaved a sigh of relief and turned to walk into the kitchen.
