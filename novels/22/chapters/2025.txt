2026 Dead end (3)

Calas, tell me ... How should I thank you old Gelman grinned hideously.

Old Gehrman emphasized the word thank you, almost gnashing his teeth in anger, causing klass to shiver.

He quickly said,Mr. Gelman, we ... We really didn’t know anything! How dare we ... How dare we attack the Gelman family The entire Grao family is a dutiful businessman ...

Hmph! You wouldn’t dare! But that Monica from your family dares to! Old Gelman’s face was as still as water as he said,if she didn’t bring those damn Chinese people here, would our family end up in this state today

As if struck by lightning, klass muttered with a pale face,Monica ... Monica again ... She’s a jinx! I should have kicked her out of the family long ago ... It’s over ... It’s over ... It’s all over now ...

Old Gelman said coldly,enough! Stop acting! Are you secretly happy to see our family in such a miserable state

I don’t dare! He didn’t dare! Mr. Gelman, Monica has been disobeying my orders. This matter was her own doing, and it has nothing to do with our Grao family! Klass hurriedly said.

His life was in old Gelman’s hands! Even if he was secretly happy, how would he dare to show it Furthermore, after hearing that everything was caused by Monica, he did not feel happy at all. When Monica was in the family, they treated her very badly. Now that Monica had such a great help, it was not a good thing for the Grasso family.

Old Gehrman sneered and glanced at the pale and trembling Calas. He said indifferently,Paul, help me thank Mr. Calas ... Remember, don’t kill him! This man is still useful to us!

Yes, sir! Paul said politely as he bowed.

Klass’s expression changed greatly as he repeatedly begged,Mr. Gelman, please don’t ...

Naturally, Paul ignored Calas’s pleas. He gestured to a few burly men beside him, who immediately came forward to lift Calas up and drag him outside.

Old Gelman said coldly,greet him here! I want to take a good look ...

Yes! The burly men replied in unison.

No... Calas shouted in fear.

Then, a series of shrill screams rang out. Old Gehrman had only told him to keep his life, and there was no need to worry about anything else. The burly men were also very heavy – handed.

In a short while, klass was on the verge of death, lying limply on the ground. His hands and feet were twisted in an irregular manner, obviously broken. His face was as swollen as a pig’s head, and probably even his closest family members might not recognize him.

Seeing that Calas had already fainted, old Gehrman suddenly felt a little dispirited. He said indifferently,Get a basin of water and wake him up!

Yes!

At this moment, a young voice lazily spoke in English,The Moore Manor is quite lively tonight!

Other than a trace of mockery, there was no killing intent in his voice. His aura was not strong, but in the ears of old Gehrman and the others, it was no different from a clap of thunder.

Who’s there Come out! Butler Paul shouted.

The big men in charge of protecting old Gelman also acted as if they were facing a great enemy and surrounded him. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Old Gelman, on the other hand, was very calm. He pushed away the burly man who was protecting him and quickly walked to the side of the limp Caras on the ground. He took out a dagger and pressed it against Caras ‘neck.

Then, old Gelman said,Chinese, stop hiding! Come out!
