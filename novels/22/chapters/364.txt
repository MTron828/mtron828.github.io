Chapter 365: A showdown (3)

There were originally 10 judges today, but professor Tian arrived later, so there were 11 judges in total, which was an odd number.

If there was a secret vote, the result would definitely be decided.

Chen dongbai looked at Xia ruofei and the others and asked,””Everyone has heard professor Tian’s suggestion. What do you all think?”

Xia ruofei replied without hesitation,”no problem!” We agree to ...”

Chen dongbai nodded and turned his gaze to Meng Zhou and the others.

Meng Zhou and the others didn’t look too good, but now they had been forced into a corner, and everyone was waiting for his answer.

In the end, Meng Zhou could only reluctantly nod his head in agreement.

“Don’t worry, President Meng,”whispered Chen Song beside him,” the quality of our Yang’s suhe is so good. How can it not be better than a jade lion?” The way I see it, they’re probably giving professor Tian face by holding a tie for the gold medal ... If it’s a secret vote, then the situation would be different!”

Meng Zhou nodded with a bitter smile and said,”I guess that’s the only way ... Chen Song, why did you make a bet with them?” If we were to lose ... Our losses would be huge. ”

Originally, the gold Prize was supposed to be shared by both parties, which led to a huge drop in the value of the gold Prize. Now, it was also involved in a strange bet that insisted on a higher winner. If yang suhe was really considered by the judges to be inferior to the Jade lion, then this tied Gold Prize would be a joke.

The last thing everyone would remember would definitely be the pot of flowers that won first place.

“Since both sides have agreed, then it’s decided!” Chen dongbai said.

Very quickly, the other flowers and plants that had won the shortlisted, bronze, and silver Awards were all picked up by the people from their respective units.

Only the Jade lion and yang suhe were left on the platform.

Everyone took the initiative to step back, leaving a very large space in front of them. This was to not interfere with the judges ‘judgment, and at the same time, give them some private space. After all, this was an anonymous voting!

Professor Tian didn’t avoid the topic. He participated in the evaluation and voting of the new round.

Since Agricultural University also had a teacher on the judging panel, professor Tian and the teacher both participated in the evaluation, so there was no problem of who took advantage of the other.

The judges all walked up to the stage and carefully observed the two pots of flowers from all angles.

In fact, the judges themselves were indecisive, which was why they spent so much time in a meeting to discuss.

Therefore, they had to re – evaluate the situation.

The teachers and students from the various universities also stood quietly on the periphery. No one disturbed the judges ‘work, nor did they show any impatience.

The judges watched for more than ten minutes before finally returning to their seats one after another.

The staff gave each judge a piece of white paper and a pen. After the judges wrote down their choices, they carefully folded them and personally placed them on the table on the podium.

It was impossible to play any tricks under the watchful eyes of the public, and this was a temporary addition, so there was no voting box or anything like that.

Soon, every judge, including Chen dongbai and professor Tian, had finished voting. There were eleven folded pieces of white paper on the table on the podium. The answers on these pieces of white paper would determine who the well – deserved first place would go to.

The teachers and students of Sanshan University and the Agriculture and Forestry University began to feel nervous, but at the same time, they were also looking forward to it.

Even though the teachers and students from other universities were just watching the show, they were also full of anticipation as they waited for the final answer.

Chen dongbai walked onto the stage, but he didn’t count the votes directly. Instead, he picked up the microphone and said,”In order to ensure the fairness of this voting, we would like to invite three teachers or students to come on stage to count the votes. We would like everyone to supervise the voting.”

Soon, they recommended three leading teachers from other universities.

The three of them did a simple self – introduction on stage and then began to count the votes.

“Yang suhe!” A teacher opened the first piece of white paper and glanced at it with the other teacher beside him.

The staff had found a white board with “jade lion” and “yang suhe” written on it. After the last teacher in charge of counting the votes heard the counting, he drew a horizontal line under yang suhe.

The two teachers in charge of counting the votes then opened the second piece of paper. After taking a look, one of the teachers said loudly,””Yang suhe!”

The counting teacher immediately drew a vertical line below yang suhe’s horizontal line.

Two consecutive votes were cast for yang suhe. The teachers and students of the agricultural University were overjoyed, while the people of the Sanshan University looked solemn.

“Yang suhe!”

The third vote still went to yang suhe.

On the agricultural University’s side, Meng Zhou and Chen song’s expressions became very relaxed. Chen Song even waved his fist in a show of force and then glanced at Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei’s expression did not change much, but Lu You and Jiang Yue were obviously very nervous. The two beautiful ladies could not help but clench their fists.

Just when everyone thought that Sanshan University’s power was gone, things took a turn.

“Jade lion!”

“Jade lion!”

“Jade lion!”

Three consecutive votes were all Jade Lions. Yang suhe, who had originally been in the lead by a large margin, suddenly lost her lead. Both sides were back at the same starting line.

There were only 11 judges in total, and six votes had already been given out. In other words, the results would be revealed soon.

The seventh ticket was still the Jade lion.

The side of the three mountains University cheered. This was the first time that the Jade lion had managed to reverse the situation.

For the eighth vote, the judges gave yang suhe their vote.

The two sides were tied again. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Following that, the ninth and tenth votes were still equally matched. This way, out of the ten votes that were opened, the Jade lion King and yang suhe each won five.

The competition was extremely cruel and intense.

There was only one vote left on the table, and this vote would determine who the first place belonged to.

Everyone couldn’t help but hold their breath, and the atmosphere became more and more tense.

Even the two teachers who were voting were affected by this emotion, and their hands trembled slightly as they took the votes.

The teacher finally opened the vote, and both of them looked at it at the same time.

Then, the teacher in charge of counting the votes opened his mouth ...
