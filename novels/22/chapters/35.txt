Chapter 36: Sold Out Instantly

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Liang Qichao was so excited that he was almost incoherent.

Xia Ruofei laughed and asked.

“So? Are you interested, Brother Liang?”

“Yes! It’s simply too interesting!” Liang Qichao said loudly. “I’ll place an order immediately. I want all these succulent seedlings!”

Xia Ruofei was stunned for a moment, then he could not help but smile bitterly. He had guessed the process correctly, but not the ending.

Liang Qichao did have a lot of connections in the succulents circle, but he was also a rich second-generation heir who spent money like water!

These succulent seedlings were expensive to ordinary people, but the total price of more than a hundred seedlings was only about 100,000 yuan. To Liang Qichao, this bit of money was nothing. It was not easy for him to come across such rare species, so how could Liang Qichao let it go?

“Brother Liang, wait!” Xia Ruofei quickly said.

“What is it?” Brother Liang asked, puzzled.

“It’s like this… My friend is intending for me ask you to help promote his new store. He wants to attract more customers,” Xia Ruofei said in embarrassment. “If you buy all of them…”

Liang Qichao’s family ran a big business. He had been influenced since he was young, so he immediately understood what Xia Ruofei meant.

“I understand!” Liang said. “But… those succulent seedlings are too… hehe!”

This guy still couldn’t bear to let go of something good!

Xia Ruofei hurriedly said.

“Brother Liang, don’t worry. You can also buy some in appropriate quantity this time. Moreover, there will be more and better succulents on sale in the future. Don’t be afraid that you won’t be able to buy them.” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

At this point, Xia Ruofei pondered for a moment and added.

“Also, I heard that my friend has a pot of mature supreme-grade White-skinned Moon Realm that he’s also interested in selling. The quality is not lower than the previous pot of Ice Lantern. If you help him this time, he’ll definitely prioritize you when he wants to sell it in future.”

Liang Qichao was immediately interested and quickly asked.

“Is the quality really no lower than the supreme-grade Ice Lantern last time?”

Xia Ruofei said firmly.

“Of course!”

Then he lowered his voice a little and said.

“Actually, it’s the mature plant of the White-skinned Moon Realm seedlings sold on his online store. Do you think the quality can be bad?”

Of course, it was impossible for Xia Ruofei to sell the mature plant. However, after he cut and reproduced it this time, he chose two or three pots of the best quality from each of the succulent seedlings and kept them. He was prepared to nurture them into mature plants for the next reproduction to increase the production as soon as possible.

In a month or so, he would just choose one of these two or three White-skinned Moon Realm and sell it to Liang Qichao.

After growing in the Spiritual Map Space for two to three months, the quality of the newly cultivated mature White-skinned Moon Realm would definitely far exceed the pot that Xia Ruofei had bought online.

Upon hearing that it was actually the mature plant of those White-Skinned Moon Realm seedlings, Liang Qichao’s doubts immediately disappeared.

“The quality will definitely not be bad! Ruofei, you must help me talk to your friend and ask him to reserve that pot of White-skinned Moon Realm to me! Don’t worry, I’ll immediately contact some friends in the circle and guarantee that your friend’s online shop will make a name for itself in the circle in the shortest time possible!”

Xia Ruofei was overjoyed.

“Thank you, Brother Liang!”

Liang Qichao repeatedly reminded Xia Ruofei not to forget about the White-Skinned Moon Realm. Xia Ruofei naturally agreed.

After hanging up, Xia Ruofei snapped his fingers and waved his fist happily.

Two minutes later, Xia Ruofei saw that someone had placed an order for two pots of each type of succulent.

Just as Xia Ruofei was marveling at Liang Qichao’s efficiency, he couldn’t help but laugh when he saw the buyer’s information. The delivery address was the Immortal Succulent Store and the recipient was Liang Qichao himself.

Xia Ruofei understood after some thought. Liang Qichao was still worried that he would not be able to snatch it after introducing his friends to buy it, so he must have made the first move after hanging up.

He was probably just starting to promote the store to his friends in the succulent circle!

Fortunately, Liang Qichao was quite kind. He only bought two pots for each type of succulent.

After another ten minutes, Xia Ruofei began to see new orders on Taobao.

This time, it was not Liang Qichao, but a real succulent customer.

For half an hour after that, new orders kept appearing. Some ordered three pots, and others five. More than a hundred pots of succulent seedlings were snapped up in half an hour. Most of these orders had the words “recommended by Director Liang of the Immortal Succulent Store” written in the remarks.

Xia Ruofei looked at the sales statistics. After all these transactions were completed, he would have earned more than 110,000 yuan.

In the Spiritual Map Space, it would take at most a few months for the mature plant to recover and grow.

Moreover, this was the first time. Later on, with the increase in the number of mature plant, there would be more seedlings that could be cultivated with each cuttage.

In other words, in the future, Xia Ruofei would be able to earn at least 100,000 yuan a month from the succulents, and it would be almost at zero cost.

This was something Xia Ruofei would never have dared to think about in the past.

With the Spiritual Map Space, it became so easy to earn money.

Moreover, this was only one of the many functions of the Spiritual Map Space. There were also the super vegetables, the magical tricolored petals, and other possible functions that had yet to be discovered…

The value of this Spiritual Map Space was really immeasurable!

Xia Ruofei calmed himself down and began to make plans for the next step.

First of all, the most important thing now was to find another place to live. Be it super vegetables or succulent seedlings, the current rental house was obviously no longer suitable. There were too many people!

Thinking of this, Xia Ruofei first put up an announcement on the website’s home page.

It read: Thank you for everyone’s support. The first batch of high-quality succulents in our shop has been sold out. We will be shipping them one after another within three days. Those who did not manage to buy them, please wait patiently. Within a month, there will be more rare and precious succulents for sale in our shop. Everyone is welcome to purchase them when the time comes!

After hanging up the announcement, Xia Ruofei packed his things, hid the Spiritual Map, and prepared to go out to look for a house.

Xia Ruofei had just reached the alley of the shanty town when his phone rang.

This was a call from Tian Huilan’s secretary, Wu Liqian. It turned out that she had already coordinated with the city’s Education Bureau to settle Lin Qiao’s school transfer.

The school was set at the No. 8 High School in Sanshan City. It was a reputable high school in the province. Moreover, the third-year class of this school was the best among all the other schools. In the past five years, three of the provincial top scorers in humanities had come from this class of the No. 8 High School.

Lin Qiao was an arts student.

Xia Ruofei quickly thanked her.

Wu Liqian told him that she would personally send Lin Qiao to No. 8 High School in the afternoon.

Since the mayor’s secretary was going to be involved personally, Xia Ruofei naturally could not be absent. Hence, he could only put aside the matter of finding a house and meet Wu Liqian at the city government guest house at two in the afternoon.

After hanging up the phone, Xia Ruofei looked at the time and saw that it was almost 1:30p.m., so he called Lin Qiao directly and told her about the new school. He told her to leave at two o’clock and report directly at No. 8 High School.

Then, Xia Ruofei took a taxi straight to the city government’s guest house.
