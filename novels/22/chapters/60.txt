Chapter 61: Super reversal (1)

He Dong revealed a fake smile and said,” “Qingxue, I understand that you want to help your classmate. I’m also very willing to do something for your classmate without affecting the overall situation. “However, food safety is our company’s Red line. Especially since there was a suspected food poisoning incident some time ago, we can’t be muddleheaded on this red line ...” He Dong nagged on and on, not directly answering Ling Qingxue’s question. However, Ling Qingxue didn’t get impatient, which was a rare sight. Instead, she revealed a meaningful smile and quietly watched he Dong’s performance with an expression as if she was watching a good show. When Ling Xiaotian and the other company executives heard he Dong’s “nonsense,” they nodded their heads repeatedly. Ling Xiaotian, in particular, approved of he Dong even more in his heart, thinking that he knew the big picture. After beating around the bush for a long time, he Dong finally returned to Ling Qingxue’s question. He continued,” “Qingxue, I know you might not be happy, but the truth is that the Tao Yuan brand organic vegetables are worthy of being called super high – Quality ingredients. They are also the key to turning the lingji F & And your classmate is just a vegetable seller trying to get close to our company and earn a little money by reselling vegetables. The two are not on the same level at all, there’s no way to compare!” After he finished speaking, he Dong looked at Ling Qingxue with a wide smile, a smug expression on his face. Ling Qingxue’s mocking expression became even more obvious. She said indifferently,” “It seems that manager he is very impressed with this paradise brand vegetable!” “I’m not just talking without thinking!” He Dong laughed.”Although the Taoyuan brand vegetables have only appeared in everyone’s eyes for two days, the appraisal and auction held by the West River Moon Club are so Grand that everyone who has attended the appraisal can’t stop praising Taoyuan vegetables. These people are all famous people in Sanshan city. It can’t be that they were hired by them, right?” Ling Xiaotian also furrowed his brows and said,” “Qingxue, what are you trying to say? We’re discussing serious matters now, so don’t throw a tantrum!” Ling Qingxue stood up and looked around at the company’s top executives. Finally, her gaze stopped on he Dong and she said sarcastically,” “Manager he, you’ve just said so many good things about paradise vegetables. I’ll thank you on behalf of ruofei!” When Ling Qingxue said this, he Dong couldn’t help but be stunned for a moment. He then asked,” “You ... What do you mean by this?” Ling Qingxue chuckled and turned to Ling Xiaotian.” “Dad, I just received a call. The Paradise vegetables that manager he was praising about were cultivated by my classmate, Xia ruofei. It’s also the vegetable that I strongly recommended to you a few days ago. The Paradise company that is currently being registered is also solely owned by Xia ruofei.” Ling Qingxue’s words were like a stone that caused a thousand ripples. The conference room immediately buzzed with discussion. As for he Dong, he sat on the chair in a daze as if he had been petrified. The expression on his face was extremely interesting. Ling Xiaotian revealed a shocked expression and asked,” “Qingxue, is the information confirmed?” “RUO Fei told me personally, how could I be wrong?” Ling Qingxue said. He Dong had only just recovered from his shock. Hearing Ling Qingxue’s words was like grasping at a life – saving straw, and he immediately said loudly,” “He’s definitely lying! He got in touch with Qingxue before because he wanted to use Qingxue to cheat our company’s money. He must have come up with another trick after I saw through him. It just so happens that Taoyuan vegetables ‘reputation has been in the limelight for the past two days, so he continued to use Taoyuan vegetables’ name to cheat people! It must be like this!” Ling Qingxue looked at he Dong coldly, not bothering to explain anything to him. She only said to Ling Xiaotian, who had an uncertain look in his eyes,” “Father, RUO Fei said that you can call President Zheng of the West River Moon Club to confirm this matter. As long as you mention his name, President Zheng will naturally tell you the truth. By the way, you should have President Zheng’s phone number, right?” Ling Xiaotian nodded his head slightly and took out his phone doubtfully. At this time, he Dong suddenly said,” “Chairman, you can’t make this call! The source of Taoyuan vegetables must be the core secret of the West River Moon Club. If he rashly called President Zheng to ask about this matter, not only would he not get any information, but he would also offend him. The cooperation in the future would definitely be impossible! This Xia ruofei has evil intentions. He’s trying to make Ling Ji restaurant and Xijiang Moon Club become enemies!” Ling Qingxue finally couldn’t help but change her expression and coldly said,” “Enough! He Dong, if it wasn’t for you deliberately making things difficult for us, Ling Ji F & B would be the one cooperating with paradise Corporation right now, and the one in the limelight in the entire Sanshan food industry would also be Ling Ji F & B! It’s because of your stupidity and selfishness that RUO Fei had no choice but to choose the West River Moon Club as his business partner. Our company has not been able to get out of this predicament, all because of you! You’re still stopping my father from investigating this matter. What are your intentions? At this time, he still accused RUO Fei of being evil! I think you’re the one who’s feeling guilty!” “I didn’t ...” He Dong explained with a pale face. Ling Xiaotian looked at he Dong with a complicated expression, then started to look for a phone number on his phone. He quickly found President Zheng’s number and dialed it. Ling Xiaotian took his phone and stood up to walk out of the conference room. Before he even walked out of the conference room, everyone heard Ling Xiaotian say enthusiastically,” “President Zheng? I’m Ling Xiaotian from Ling Ji F & B ... I have something to ask you ...” Then, the thick door of the conference room was closed, blocking Ling Xiaotian’s voice. No one could hear what Ling Xiaotian and President Zheng were talking about on the phone outside the conference room. These high – ranking officials all looked at he Dong with complicated gazes. There was pity, gloating, and also indifference ... Meanwhile, Ling Qingxue sat quietly in her seat, looking at he Dong’s pale face and dejected appearance. Her heart was filled with joy. After watching this despicable person act so arrogantly for so many days, Ling Qingxue felt as disgusted as if she had eaten a fly every time she saw him. Today, she had finally vented her anger! If it was anyone else who dared to talk back to Ling Qingxue like this, they would have been kicked out of the company a long time ago. He Dong only dared to be so impudent because his father had saved Ling Xiaotian’s life. It was also because of this that Ling Qingxue especially hated him. Very quickly, the meeting room’s door opened once more. Ling Xiaotian walked back with a somewhat unsightly expression. Everyone’s eyes were focused on him, but no one dared to ask. Ling Qingxue was the only one who smiled confidently and asked,” “Dad, how’s the questioning?” Ling Xiaotian’s expression became a little awkward, not knowing how to answer Ling Qingxue. After a long while, Ling Xiaotian furrowed his brows and looked at he Dong, asking in a deep voice,” “Little he, what’s wrong with you? We’re all trying to curry favor with such a high – Quality supplier like Xia ruofei, why are you still pushing him away? Also, Qingxue said that you deliberately made things difficult for her and forcibly ruined the cooperation that had already been drafted. Is that true? It was all good now! Old Zheng from West River moon had gotten a great deal! What do you want to do? Ah?” He Dong’s face instantly paled when he heard this, and the last bit of hope in his heart also vanished. He slumped into his chair, completely not knowing how to deal with this kind of situation ...𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m
