Chapter 301: The concubine’s smile (1)

Xia ruofei first drove to the warehouse that he had rented. The barbed wire fence with metal curtains that he ordered from the factory last time was already ready. When Xia ruofei returned, he had informed the factory to send the goods to the warehouse. This was to build a living area for the Hornet. The iron cage was too narrow now, so it could only be used temporarily. Not long after Xia ruofei arrived at the warehouse, the goods from the factory arrived. It took the three workers a while to unload the whole truck. Xia ruofei checked the number according to the order and paid the rest in cash. After the workers left, Xia ruofei locked the warehouse door and kept all the barbed wire fences in his interspace. Xia ruofei was very careful when he was collecting them. He controlled the barbed wire fence and stacked it neatly on the open land in the new space to avoid hurting xiaohei and the others. After keeping it, Xia ruofei did not have the time to enter the medium to build a fence. The time flow in the new space was the same as the outside world. He would need a lot of time to build a fence. He could only wait until night time. After he left the warehouse, he drove to the seed company. According to the dozens of seeds he bought last time, he bought 20 kilograms of each. The 200 to 300 kilograms of seeds were all loaded into the back of the pickup truck. These seeds should be enough to last for a long time. Xia ruofei returned to the warehouse and drove the pickup truck there. Then, he stored the seeds in the medium. As for the work of soaking the seeds, he could only wait until he got home. Then, Xia ruofei drove to the Anhua District on the outskirts of the city. Xia ruofei was familiar with this area because Liang Qichao ‘s’ succulent food stall ‘was also located in this area. There were many nursery bases in this area. Xia ruofei’s trip this time was to settle the matter of fruit tree seedlings. To be more precise, he wanted to buy the lychee sapling. After careful consideration, Xia ruofei decided to plant two types of fruit trees, lychee and cherry, in the 15 mu of land behind the mountain. There were more lychee trees in the southeast province, and there were many high – Quality varieties. They could be bought directly from the local area. As for the cherry trees, Xia ruofei wanted to plant the large, SD – Type cherries. This type of cherry tree was not suitable to be planted in the southeast province, so the corresponding saplings could not be bought under normal circumstances. However, e – commerce was very convenient now. You could contact the SD seller directly on the internet. As long as you were willing to pay, you could naturally buy it. Xia ruofei had come here to buy the lychee sapling. He drove around a few times and finally chose a nursery base called “verdant fields”. The nursery base looked pretty good in scale. From the outside, the rows of Nursery Gardens were well – arranged and looked very refreshing. This gave Xia ruofei a good first impression. Xia ruofei drove to the entrance and told the old man that he was here to buy saplings. The old man picked up the phone and informed the people inside. Soon, a young man in his late twenties walked out quickly. The young man was wearing a brown casual suit and had a crew cut. He looked very energetic. “Boss, thank you for choosing our wild seedling base!” The young man said very enthusiastically,”my name is Lu Bo, the boss of this seedling base! May I know your name, boss?” “Hello, boss Lu, my surname is Xia.” Xia ruofei said with a smile. “Boss Xia, it’s a pleasure to meet you!” Lu Bo handed him a business card and asked,”what kind of sapling do you want to buy, Mr. Xia?” “Do you have lychee seedlings, boss Lu?” Xia ruofei asked directly. “Of course! The sapling base in the southeast province rarely doesn’t have lychee seedlings!” Lu Bo smiled and said,”boss Xia, please come in!” We’ll talk while we watch!” “Alright, boss Lu, get in my car!” Xia ruofei said,”I can’t just block your door with my car!” Lu Bo laughed and got into Xia ruofei’s car. Under Lu Bo’s guidance, Xia ruofei drove to a small building and stopped. “Boss Xia, come in and have a cup of tea!” Lu Bo said after getting off the car. “There’s no need for tea,” Xia ruofei said with a smile.”Boss Lu, just take me to see the saplings!” “That works too!” “This way, boss Xia,” Lu Bo said readily. Lu Bo brought Xia ruofei to the nursery that was specially used to cultivate lychee seedlings and introduced,””Boss Xia, we have several varieties of lychee seedlings here. Which one do you need?” “Boss Lu, please recommend one! I want something of good quality. ” Xia ruofei said with a smile. “Then let’s come over here!” Lu Bo said after some thought. Lu Bo led Xia ruofei to a nursery not far away. He pointed at the lychee seedlings and said,””Boss Xia, this is the feizixiao variety that we introduced from Guangdong this year. Compared with the local variety in southeast China, this variety of lychees has big fruits, thick meat, beautiful color, small pits, sweet taste, and other characteristics. Its quality and taste are excellent, and it is one of the high – Quality breeds of lychees that mature early in the middle of the Guangdong Province.” “Riding on red dust, the concubine laughs. No one knows it’s lychee!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”that’s a good name!” “You’re a gentleman, boss Xia!”Lu Bo laughed and said. This species of lychees got its name from this ancient poem! It’s also a very famous breed in Guangdong Province. ” In fact, Xia ruofei had searched for relevant information on the internet and knew that the breed of feizixiao was very good. However, it was mainly grown in Guangdong Province and was relatively rare in the southeast province, so he had not considered it at the beginning. Since Fei Zixiao’s lychee seedlings were for sale at Lu Bo’s seedling base, Xia ruofei quickly decided to use it! Hence, he said,”boss Lu, I’ll take this one!” My Orchard isn’t big, and the area for planting lychees is about 8 mu. It’s mountainous, so can you help me calculate how many I need?” Lu Bo said without hesitation,”in general, the distance between the trees in the mountain is 6×5 meters, and 30 plants per mu is more suitable. If Mr. Xia’s land is eight mu, 240 plants will be enough.” Of course, if you want dense planting, you can plant up to sixty to seventy per mu!” Xia ruofei said,”if you don’t need dense planting, then let’s set it as 30 per mu!” Boss Lu, I’ll buy 260 of them and keep the remaining 20 for my own use. ” “That’s indeed enough!” Lu Bo nodded. Then, he took the initiative to say,”boss Xia, we sell the feizixiao lychee seedlings at 20 yuan each. I see that you are a forthright person. I’ll give you the real price!” How about 18 Yuan each?” “Alright!” Xia ruofei said readily,”boss Lu, please prepare the saplings for me now!” I want to ship it back today. ” Lu Bo was stunned and asked in surprise,””You’re shipping it back today? Boss Xia, although we don’t have strict requirements on the planting time of lychees, the weather is still quite cold now. If you plant them now, the survival rate will be lower. I suggest you wait for about half a month and wait for the weather to get warmer before you plant them!” “Mr. Xia, even if we can provide the saplings in half a month, our price will not change!” Lu Bo quickly added. It’s the same as having these saplings in our seedling base for half a month. You don’t need to pay a single cent!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,””Boss Lu, thank you for your kindness, but I still have to bring the saplings back today. As for the survival rate, you don’t have to worry about it, boss Lu. Even if these saplings don’t grow well, I won’t come to you for trouble!” “This ...” Lu Bo felt somewhat helpless. He had always been very particular about his business and was very considerate of his customers. If it had been an ordinary boss, he might not have even mentioned it and would have just followed whatever the customer said. However, he had already tried to persuade Xia ruofei. He had no choice if Xia ruofei did not listen to him. “Alright then! Boss Xia, I’ll get the workers to prepare the saplings. ” Lu Bo said helplessly,”I’ll ask them to choose the thicker saplings! Sigh ... I hope the survival rate is relatively high. ” “Thank you, boss Lu!” Xia ruofei said with a smile. “By the way, boss Lu, can you help me deliver the goods?” Xia ruofei asked again. “Boss Xia,” Lu Bo said with some difficulty,”we’re running a small business. Besides, there’s no special Delivery vehicle at the Miaomiao base, so we don’t provide delivery services.” However, there’s a small truck nearby that’s waiting for work. I can help you contact it, and the price won’t be very high. ” “Alright then!” Xia ruofei said,”then please help me call a taxi!” A trip from the city to Changping would cost at most a few hundred Yuan. Xia ruofei didn’t want to haggle over this issue. “Alright!” Lu Bo called some workers over to prepare the saplings. He even specifically asked the workers to pick the thicker saplings. Then, he called Xia ruofei to call a car. Xia ruofei walked to the side, picked up a small bucket, and filled it with water from the tap. Then, he used his body to block the view of Lu Bo and the others. Then, a small bottle appeared in his palm. Xia ruofei quickly poured the flower petal solution into the bucket and kept the bottle back in the medium. He carried the bucket and walked towards the lychee saplings that the workers had dug up.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels
