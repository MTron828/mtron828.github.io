Xia ruofei nodded and said,”don’t forget the purpose of our paradise company. We must go for the high – Quality route. It’s the same for our self – employed stores. Since we’re going to do it, we must do the best. Don’t save money in this aspect!” Otherwise, he might as well not do it! Of course, this doesn’t mean that we have to be a spendthrift. Store leasing, renovation, there are many tricks behind this! It’s best to find someone who knows the industry to help check!”

“I understand, Chairman!” Xiao Qiang replied respectfully.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”don’t be afraid of spending money. You can earn more money after you’ve spent it!” Besides, our company’s ability to make money is very strong. In the future, I will develop more money – making projects, even projects that are not worse than jaded skin ointment. As long as everyone works together and put in effort in one place, the company will definitely not treat everyone badly in the future!”

Xia ruofei’s words made all the high – ranking officials in the meeting room excited.

The director of the pharmaceutical factory, Xue Jinshan, saw that everyone was speaking freely and he couldn’t sit still anymore. Taking advantage of the fact that Xia ruofei had just finished speaking, he quickly said,””Chairman, the pharmaceutical factory also has something to report to you!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”Oh? Tell me about it!”

“Chairman, the two projects of the Jushi cream and the heart – nourishing soup are undoubtedly golden projects,” said Xue Jinshan.”It’s just that the production capacity of our pharmaceutical factory is limited, and the potential of these two projects is far from being fully explored! Chairman, I think expanding production is an urgent matter! Every day, looking at those distributors waving their checks for quotas, it’s like seeing silver in front of me, but I can’t pick it up. It’s so uncomfortable!”

Xue Jinshan’s words made everyone laugh.

In fact, it wasn’t just the pharmaceutical factory. The farm was also the same, including products such as iron maple and Cordyceps, the market was far from saturated. In the end, it was still limited production, so money couldn’t be earned.

It was just that the jaded skin cream and heart – nourishing soup from the manufacturing factory, one of which was extremely profitable, and the other had excellent social benefits, so the production problem was more prominent.

Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”the pharmaceutical factory just increased the production line. Now they want to increase production again?” Could the talent reserve keep up? Would there be chaos in the management? If the quality of the product is flawed because of these problems, then the loss outweighs the gain. You must know that the brand of our tuan Tao Yuan company is the real priceless treasure!”

“I don’t think there’s a big problem with the manpower,” Xue Jinshan said.”Ordinary workers don’t have much technical content. After recruiting them and training them for a period of time, and then teaching the new with the old, they’re completely capable of doing the job!”

At this point, Xue Jinshan hesitated for a moment before he continued,”As for the management, it might be a little tense in the short term, but we can totally poach people! There were quite a few capable people in those big pharmaceutical factories! Now, because of the Jade skin cream and heart – nourishing soup, our pharmaceutical factory is very famous in the industry. As long as we reveal the news that we are recruiting, I believe that there will be a lot of people interested! Our company has a lot of room for improvement, and the pay is definitely top notch in the industry. The success rate of poaching is very high!”

“As for the management ...” Xue Jinshan pondered for a moment before saying,”actually, after director Dong joined us, he gave a lot of good suggestions for the standardized management of our pharmaceutical factory. If we follow director Dong’s standardized management concept, I think that even if the early stages will be a little messy, there will definitely not be any serious mistakes!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”I agree ... In principle!”

The most profitable project now was the jaded skin cream, so Xia ruofei naturally wouldn’t be stingy with money.

Then, Xia ruofei changed the topic and said,””Factory manager Xue, do you have any specific ideas?”

Xue Jinshan had clearly considered this question seriously. He immediately replied,”As the factory area is limited, it’s not feasible to continue increasing production lines. Besides, the factory area is surrounded by Laocheng District, and the land price is not cheap, so ... I suggest building a sub – Factory!”

“A branch factory?” Xia ruofei had not thought of this.

Xue Jinshan nodded and said,”the current pharmaceutical factory has already been purchased. All the facilities are a little old. The cost of renovation is not small. My opinion is to find a place to get the government to approve a piece of land. We can plan from the beginning and build a pharmaceutical factory that meets international standards!”

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly.”You’re really big – hearted!”

Buying land was not a big problem. The government was still quite supportive of this kind of industrial investment.

And now, the assets of the Paradise company had reached more than one billion Yuan. Although it couldn’t be said to be ranked among the top in San Shan, it at least had a certain amount of weight.

In addition, Xia ruofei was quite influential. He did not even need to look for song Qiming. It would not be too difficult for him to make a request to the government through formal channels. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The problem was that investing in a new pharmaceutical factory would cost a lot of money. Peach blossom company only had 90 million Yuan in liquid capital at the moment, which was undoubtedly a drop in the bucket for the pharmaceutical factory, which had a construction cost of hundreds of millions.

Xue Jinshan clearly understood Xia ruofei’s concerns and immediately said,”Chairman, if we can get the suburbs industrial land, it won’t cost too much. For example, the base price of the primary industrial land around the farm is about 350000 Yuan per mu. 1000 mu of new plant will be enough, which is only 350 million Yuan!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh,”only 350 million?” I say, old Xue, you’re really rich now! Could it be that the sales of the jaded skin cream gave you an illusion? 300 million! Where am I supposed to make it appear for you?”

When he heard that the company had 90 million Yuan in liquid funds, Xia ruofei thought it was a lot. Now, it seemed that 90 million Yuan was not even money. Xue Jinshan was already thinking of starting a billion – dollar project, how could this amount of money be enough!

This money really can’t be spent!

Xue Jinshan’s face reddened as he explained,”Chairman, the government won’t ask us to pay in one go for the land we’re transferring. I think we just need to do some work and get a 20% bonus! That’s only 70 million! With the money – making abilities of the jadeshi cream and heart – nourishing soup, it’s definitely not a problem to pay more than 200 million!”

Zhao Yongjun and the others had already taught Xia ruofei a lesson about real estate development in the capital, so he was not completely clueless.

He said,”even if there’s no problem with the money for the land, what about the construction?” You just said that it would be built according to international standards. Also, the cost of the production line alone would be an astronomical figure for a 1000 mu pharmaceutical factory Park! Have you calculated it?”

Xue Jinshan had really calculated it before. He had been thinking about opening a branch factory for a long time. He was really tempted when he saw so much money in front of him but couldn’t earn it.

So, he immediately said,”Chairman, I’ve roughly estimated that the construction of the entire pharmaceutical factory might cost about 1.5 billion. Of course, we only need 500 million in the early stage to start the construction!”

When Xue Jinshan said this, he didn’t wait for Xia ruofei to rebut. He sped up his speech,”Chairman, 1.5 billion is really not much! Overseas production lines were very expensive, and standardized factories were also very expensive! However, as long as the new factory was completed, the increased production of the jaded skin ointment alone would bring immeasurable benefits! My conservative estimate is that in one to one and a half years, all the investment will be worth it! He had earned more than one or two billion in a year! Where else can you find such a good thing?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”Okay, okay!” Old Xue, don’t give me that. I’ll just ask you this: Where did the money come from? Don’t expect me to continue injecting capital! I can think of a way to get tens of millions or even one or two hundred million. Your factory is standardized, and you have a 1000 – mu Park area. I don’t run a money – printing factory, so Where Can I Get that much money?”

At this moment, Dong Yun and Feng Jing looked at each other and said,””Chairman, you seem to have forgotten something ...”

Xia ruofei was stunned and asked,”did you forget something?” What do you mean, director Dong?”

Dong Yun’s expression was a bit strange as she said,”Have you forgotten that there are still banks in this world? We’re in zero debt now. For such a large company to have a debt ratio of zero, this is really unbelievable! If we really want to start the pharmaceutical factory construction project, we can definitely get a loan from the bank!”
