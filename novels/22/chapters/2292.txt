2293 Critical condition (1)

As soon as the car drove out of the airport, the police siren was sounded and the car sped all the way.

Xia ruofei and Song Wei sat in the back seat. Song Wei was trembling because of nervousness. Xia ruofei held her hand tightly and asked,””Lieutenant Colonel, how may I address you?”

“Mr. Xia, my name is Liu Tie. I’m the combat staff officer of the staff officer Department of the Air Force’s three mountains command center!” The Air Force Lieutenant Colonel replied.

“Staff officer Liu, how are you?” Xia ruofei asked,”may I ask ... How is uncle song’s condition now?”

Liu Tie hesitated for a moment. He looked at Song Wei from the rearview mirror and said cautiously,”The order I received was to send both of you to the military general Hospital as fast as possible. I don’t know much about the other conditions.”

Xia ruofei looked at Liu Tie thoughtfully, then nodded.

Xia ruofei would definitely not believe that Liu Tie did not understand the situation at all. However, he was also carrying out a mission. It was not appropriate for Xia ruofei to ask about things that were not related to the mission.

He was certain that song Qiming’s condition was not looking good. Otherwise, Liu Tie would not have hesitated because he was worried about Song Wei.

Of course, one more thing was certain. At least before Liu Tie set off, song Qiming was still alive. Otherwise, everything they were doing now would be meaningless, and they would not have to risk their lives and speed on the highway.

Xia ruofei patted Song Wei’s hand and said in a low voice,””Weiwei, don’t worry. Uncle song will be fine. Trust me!”

“Mm! RUO Fei, you must save my father!” Song Wei said.

“Of course! He’s your father!” Xia ruofei said,”don’t worry! We’ll be at the hospital soon ...”

Xia ruofei’s words gave Song Wei a pillar of support. She subconsciously snuggled up to Xia ruofei as if this was the only way she could support herself.

Xia ruofei sighed to himself. He had comforted Song Wei, but he was not confident at all. He was really afraid that when they arrived at the hospital, they would be facing a cold body.

Xia ruofei did not dare to imagine what would happen to Song Wei if such a situation really happened. She would definitely have an emotional breakdown, right?

Even though he was anxious, Xia ruofei did not show it. Instead, he looked calm and this made Song Wei feel more at ease.

The sergeant squad leader had shortened the journey, which would normally take about 50 minutes to an hour, to about 35 minutes.

In the building of the General Hospital of the military Region, a sharp braking sound was heard. The mengshi SUV left two deep black braking marks.

Xia ruofei hurriedly thanked Liu Tie and the sergeant squad leader, then pushed the door open and got out of the car.

A familiar figure was standing at the entrance of the hospital building with an anxious look. It was song Qiming’s Secretary, Guangzhi Cao. His head was also wrapped in bandages, and blood was still seeping out.

“Director Xia, Song Wei, this way!” Guangzhi Cao said as soon as he saw the two.

Xia ruofei pulled Song Wei along and caught up with Guangzhi Cao.””Brother Cao, how’s uncle song?”

This was the question that he was most concerned about at the moment, and it was also a big stone that had been hanging in his heart.

Guangzhi Cao’s footsteps were hurried, and he was slightly out of breath. As he walked forward, he said,”The doctors are still trying to save him, but ...”

Guangzhi Cao looked at Song Wei and gritted his teeth,”A professor – Level expert from the neurosurgery department of the General Hospital said that it would be difficult for the Secretary to make it through if the family members were to be mentally prepared ...”

Song Wei’s face turned pale. She swayed and almost fainted.

Xia ruofei quickly held Song Wei and said,””Don’t worry ... As long as uncle song is still alive, I’ll do everything I can to save him. ”

Song Wei suddenly came to her senses. There was still Xia ruofei! The most important thing now was to get Xia ruofei to treat her father.

Song Wei had a blind trust in Xia ruofei. She believed that as long as her father was alive, Xia ruofei would have a solution. She was very persistent in her belief.

“Yes, brother Cao, let’s go faster!” Song Wei said.

There was a staff member from Municipal Party Committee standing guard at the elevator. He saw Guangzhi Cao walking over with Xia ruofei from a distance, so he quickly pressed the elevator button.

When the three of them arrived at the elevator, the elevator had also arrived. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Without a word, everyone quickly walked into the elevator. Guangzhi Cao quickly pressed the button for the 15th floor, which was the floor where the operating room was located.

Xia ruofei watched anxiously as the numbers on the elevator rose one by one. This was the first time he felt that the elevator was moving so slowly ...

Finally, the elevator stopped on the 15th floor with a ding.

The elevator door opened slowly and Xia ruofei and his team walked out quickly. Song Wei saw her mother standing at the door of the operating room. A female worker from the municipal Party Committee was helping her.

“Mom ...” Song Wei called out in a trembling voice.

Song Qiming’s wife, Fang Liyun, turned around when she heard her daughter’s voice.

Song Wei rushed over and hugged Fang Liyun tightly.

“Weiwei, your father ... He might not make it ...” Fang Liyun said sadly.

“No... No... Dad is so young and healthy. Even if he’s just a little injured, he’ll be able to get through it ...” Song Wei said, trembling.

Fang Liyun shook her head with a bitter smile and said,””Professor Chen said ... When your father was sent to the hospital, his brain was severely injured and he had multiple fractures ... There’s no need for surgery anymore ... However, Secretary Lin of the Provincial Party Committee personally ordered that your father’s life must be saved at all costs, so the hospital decided to perform an open surgery. However, professor Chen said ... We should be mentally prepared and not have too much hope ...”
