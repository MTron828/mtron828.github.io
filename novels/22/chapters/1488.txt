Chapter 1489: The ancient tomb of Mount Yu (1)

Translator: 549690339

With the Jade Leaf sensing something, he could confirm that there was indeed a world stone here.

Xia ruofei’s original guess was now supported by strong evidence. He couldn’t help but reveal a trace of joy.

Song Wei felt it too. She smiled and asked,””Did you find anything?”

“Not yet,” Xia ruofei said,”but I have a feeling that we will definitely gain something from this trip!”

“Don’t they say that women have the strongest sixth sense?”Song Wei laughed. I didn’t even sense it, but you did?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”what does this mean?” You’re a tough woman?”

“You’re looking for a beating!” Song Wei glared at Xia ruofei. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

The two of them chatted and laughed as they walked to King Yu’s temple. They were no different from ordinary tourists.

However, they didn’t enter the temple. Instead, they strolled around, as if they were very interested in the nearby scenery.

King Yu’s temple was only a small local scenic spot. Not many people usually came, so the two of them went around to the side of the temple without anyone knowing.

There was a small path overgrown with weeds that meandered into the mountain.

“This is the path!” Song Wei said,”we used this road to visit King Yu’s temple from the base camp at the entrance of the tomb.”

“Let’s go!” Xia ruofei said immediately when he saw that no one was around.

The two of them stepped into the path and walked through the weeds.

Xia ruofei took out his walking stick and started to clear the path. The path seemed to have been abandoned for a long time. The weeds on both sides were very tall and almost covered the road. There were also brambles that blocked the way from time to time.

Fortunately, Xia ruofei was strong. He waved his walking stick and opened a path. The two of them were not slow.

Song Wei was traveling light and Xia ruofei was full of energy. Hence, the two of them were walking briskly on the small path. They turned around a Mountain Valley very quickly and the temple of King Yu behind them disappeared from their sight.

While they were moving, Xia ruofei was also paying attention to the Jade Leaf’s condition.

The Jade Leaf was indeed getting hotter and hotter. When they were in King Yu’s temple, it was only a little warm. If Xia ruofei had not been sensitive, he might not have noticed it. Now, the temperature had obviously increased.

This meant that he was getting closer and closer to the world stone.

The two of them walked for more than half an hour before they arrived at the other side of Yu mountain.

Xia ruofei had already memorized the two maps that Song Wei had drawn. When he reached a place, he naturally matched it with the map.

“Not far ahead is our old archeological base ...” Song Wei said.

“Mm! Dongting Lake should be at nineo’ clock, and your base camp was at twoo’ clock. The entrance to the tomb was at twelveo’ clock. ” Xia ruofei said.

“How did you know?” Song Wei was stunned.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”if your drawing is accurate enough, then I’m not wrong.” There are a lot of references here, and marking the location according to the map and the references is the basic skill of a Scout!”

“Okay ...” Song Wei said, embarrassed,”actually, I don’t really remember ...”

After all, she had only stayed there for a few days, and she had never been to Mount Yu before. To be able to draw that map, her memory was already very good.

The two of them continued forward. Knowing that there might be guards here, Xia ruofei remained vigilant and paid close attention to the surrounding situation.

This place was overgrown with wild grass. If the two of them were discovered now, it would be difficult to explain.

After all, this place didn’t have much scenery, and even foreign tourists wouldn’t set foot here.

Xia ruofei was still leading the way, and Song Wei followed him closely.

Suddenly, Xia ruofei’s eyes narrowed. He subconsciously raised his right hand and gestured for them to stop and hide. At the same time, he squatted down.

However, he had forgotten that Song Wei had never received military sign language training. Naturally, she was not as alert as he was.

Therefore, Song Wei had no idea what Xia ruofei’s movement meant. It was so sudden that she did not have time to react. She followed him closely and bumped into Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei had already squatted down and only his right hand was raised. Hence, the peaks on Song Wei’s chest collided with Xia ruofei’s hand and immediately, there was an obvious deformation.

Song Wei was also stunned, and her face turned red instantly.

Xia ruofei was initially looking ahead with keen eyes. He did not expect to feel a soft and ecstatic touch on his arm and palm. He could not help but be stunned.

Xia ruofei turned around and saw Song Wei blushing. She was about to scream.

How could Xia ruofei be bothered to reminisce about the wonderful taste? He quickly wrapped his hand around Song Wei’s neck and covered her mouth. At the same time, he brought her to squat down.

“Don’t make a sound. There’s someone ...” Xia ruofei whispered in Song Wei’s ear.

Song Wei’s ears were already red. Being hugged by Xia ruofei in such a position, the strong masculine scent hit her face and she felt weak all over.

Song Wei looked at Xia ruofei with her watery eyes and nodded.

Xia ruofei let go of her hand. Song Wei squatted beside Xia ruofei and looked in the direction of his gaze. She could vaguely see two people patrolling back and forth about a hundred meters away. That was the base camp of the archeologists. Not far ahead was the entrance of the tomb that was opened.
