2202 Entering the sea of consciousness (2)

Perhaps it was because the harsher the outside environment, the more precious the comfort of one’s own home was.

It was the same on the yacht. Outside was the terrifying sea shrouded in darkness, but here, there were warm lights, soft beds, and comfortable living facilities ...

Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue went to take a shower separately. They had barbecued meat and drank beer. Both of them reeked of charcoal and alcohol.

Xia ruofei really wanted to take a couple’s bath with Ling Qingxue. The bathroom on the yacht was very big and even had a Jacuzzi. Unfortunately, Ling Qingxue was still cheeky and stopped Xia ruofei outside, quickly locking the door. Xia ruofei ‘s’ scheme ‘would not succeed.

However, when Xia ruofei came out of the shower, the two of them first hugged and kissed passionately, then quickly fell onto the soft bed. A new battle began ...

Tonight, the moon was bright and the stars were few. In the vast sea, it was dark all around. A brightly lit yacht was moving up and down rhythmically. It was unknown if it was because of the waves and waves on the sea.

Perhaps the moon was also shy, she sneaked behind a cloud and only revealed a small part.

After an unknown period of time, the “war” on the yacht finally ceased, and the swaying of the yacht seemed to have reduced a lot.

The two of them were very open in such an environment. Xia ruofei let loose of his abundant energy to his heart’s content. Ling Qingxue did not have as many concerns as she did on land. In the depths of their love, she even let out a hysterical cry. When the two of them called for a retreat, her voice was a little hoarse.

Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue took a quick shower and then fell asleep in each other’s arms on the large bed in the yacht’s master bedroom.

The yacht swayed gently like a cradle, allowing Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue to sleep soundly.

Even when the sun shone through the window, the two were still in deep sleep. Ling Qingxue was lying on Xia ruofei’s arm, her delicate body pressed tightly against Xia ruofei ‘s. There was a satisfied smile on her face, and it was unclear if she was dreaming about last night’s intimate scene ...

Xia ruofei opened his eyes first. Last night’s absurdity did not make his back ache. On the contrary, he felt refreshed after waking up.

He was worried that he would wake Ling Qingxue up, so he didn’t move after he woke up. Instead, he maintained his original position and gently hugged Ling Qingxue.

After a while, Ling Qingxue’s long eyelashes moved slightly, and she slowly opened her eyes.

The moment she opened her eyes, she saw Xia ruofei looking at her with a smile. Thinking of the crazy time they had last night, her face heated up and she snuggled into Xia ruofei’s arms again.

Xia ruofei laughed,”lazy cat, if you’re awake, then get up!” It’s already late in the morning!”

Ling Qingxue moaned and pouted,””Let me lie down for a while longer ... I feel so weak that my bones are about to fall apart ...”

Although Xia ruofei knew that a cultivator at the third level of the aura refining realm would not be unable to get out of bed just because of a night of nonsense, Ling Qingxue’s words still gave him a great sense of achievement.

He laughed and patted Ling Qingxue’s shoulder.”Then lie down for a while. I’ll go prepare breakfast!”

Ling Qingxue smiled sweetly and nodded.””Mm! I know you’re the best ...”

Xia ruofei shook his head helplessly and said,””Don’t stay in bed for too long! I still want to cultivate with you for a while after breakfast ...”

“Ah?” Ling Qingxue cried out. Still cultivating? It’s not easy for us to go out to sea for two days. Why don’t we cultivate after we go back ...”

Xia ruofei laughed.”This cultivation is different from the past. I’m sure you’ll like it!” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“What’s the difference in cultivation?” Ling Qingxue asked in confusion.

Xia ruofei smiled mysteriously and said,”you’ll know soon!” You can get up and wash up after you lie down for a while!”

“You’re still keeping me in suspense ...” Ling Qingxue muttered.

However, Xia ruofei’s words had piqued her curiosity. She was not in the mood to stay in bed anymore, so she got up and put on her clothes.

Ling Qingxue first tidied up the messy bed, then went to the bathroom to wash up.

Girls always took a longer time to dress up. By the time she was done, Xia ruofei had already finished preparing breakfast.

Of course, he didn’t make a sumptuous meal like he did on land. He used ready – made ingredients. He baked a few pieces of bread, heated two glasses of milk, and fried bacon and eggs. It was simple and fast, but also guaranteed nutrition.

The two of them quickly finished their breakfast.

Their minds were not on breakfast. Xia ruofei was a little distracted, thinking about how to explain Song Wei’s matter to Ling Qingxue. On the other hand, Ling Qingxue kept thinking about the different cultivation method that Xia ruofei had mentioned.

After packing up, Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but ask,””RUO Fei, how do you want to cultivate? Are you going to teach me a new technique? Isn’t the “Taichu Heart Sutra” good?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”it’s not a new technique, but it’s more advanced than the previous one!” You’ll know in a while, let’s go! I’ll go set up the formation first!”

Xia ruofei took out the time formation flag from the cabin and brought Ling Qingxue to the top deck of the flying bridge. She started to set up the time formation.

The reason why he insisted on cultivating inside the formation was to save time. More importantly, due to the difference in the flow of time inside and outside the formation, Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue, who were inside the formation, would have more time to react if there were any sudden changes outside the formation. They could calmly end their cultivation and leave the formation to deal with the danger.

It was a very important guarantee for his cultivation on the sea where the weather was unpredictable.

The two of them held hands as they walked into the formation. Xia ruofei held the origin crystal in his hand and sat down cross – legged with Ling Qingxue.

“What do we do next?” Ling Qingxue asked.

“Just listen to my instructions,”Xia ruofei said.”Just start like how we usually cultivate.”

“Understood!” Ling Qingxue said.

Although she did not know what kind of wonderful situation she was about to encounter, she could not help but feel a little nervous when she saw Xia ruofei’s serious expression.

Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue pressed their palms against each other and started to merge their genuine Qi according to the cultivation method of the ” Scripture of the primordium origin “.

The two of them were already very familiar with the practice of the ” absolute beginning Heart Sutra “. The true energy fusion, which was more dangerous at the initial stage, was not too difficult for the two of them.

Soon, the two wisps of true Qi gradually merged together, forming a situation where you were in me, and I was in you. The two of them took turns to control the merged true Qi and began to operate it according to the ” primordial heart Sutra “.

After a few cycles, the two souls’ frequencies gradually synchronized.

One round, two rounds ...

Finally, the fusion of true energy almost reached the extreme, and the soul Frequency of the two had basically reached the degree of complete synchronization.

This was much easier than when Xia ruofei and Song Wei were cultivating. This was mainly due to the improvement of Xia ruofei’s cultivation. His control of spiritual power was much stronger than before.

This was the time! Xia ruofei thought to himself,

He said in a deep voice, ” Qingxue, I’ll take full control of what’s going on down there. Don’t try to control your vital energy. At the same time, let down all your defenses. My spiritual power is going to enter your sea of consciousness! ”

If it was another cultivator, they would definitely be suspicious of Xia ruofei’s request. However, Ling Qingxue had absolute trust in Xia ruofei. Without hesitation, she nodded and said, ” “Understood.”

At this moment, the essential Qi was still under Xia ruofei’s control. When the essential Qi was transferred into Ling Qingxue’s body, it should have been Ling Qingxue’s turn to take control. However, Xia ruofei continued to control the essential Qi. With his strong spiritual power, he guided the essential Qi along the correct path without any mistakes.

His spiritual power weaved into an impenetrable invisible net, completely wrapping that ball of true Qi.

His essential Qi traveled upwards. Suddenly, Xia ruofei felt that his spiritual energy had been sent to a vast and empty world.

With the experience of co – cultivating with Song Wei, Xia ruofei knew that this was Ling Qingxue’s consciousness ...
