Chapter 1940 Sitting steadily on the fishing platform (1)

Although Zhu zhihang and Xia ruofei had never met face to face, Xia ruofei was an internet celebrity. Zhu zhihang was no stranger to Xia ruofei and often saw his photos and news on the internet.

Even so, when Zhu zhihang saw Xia ruofei in person, he was still secretly surprised by his young age.

Zhu zhihang felt that Xia ruofei was about the same age as his son, who had just graduated from college. He was only a few years older than Xia ruofei, but his son was living off of his parents and did not even have a proper job. On the other hand, Xia ruofei already had such a big business and his social influence was growing day by day.

It was really infuriating to compare people! Zhu zhihang muttered in his heart.

“No, no, no!” Zhu zhihang said with a smile,”President Xia is so busy. It’s a little rude of us to come uninvited ...”

“You’re too kind, County Head Zhu. You’re an important guest!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”come, come, come, this way please ...”

Xia ruofei led Zhu zhihang to the reception room next door and said to Zhou Yu,””Go and make a few cups of tea. Use my precious Da Hong Pao.”

“Yes, Chairman!” Zhou Yu immediately responded.

Of course, Xia ruofei had his treasured Da Hong Pao tea leaves, but they were all stored in the spirit map space. The Da Hong Pao tea leaves in his office were only used for guests. In fact, they were the same kind sold in the flagship store of paradise corporation’s heavenly cat. Although the price and quality were very high, no matter who came to visit, the tea served was the same.

Of course, Zhou Yu would not be stupid enough to expose him. After responding, she quickly went to make tea.

Zhu zhihang naturally didn’t know about this and quickly said,””You’re too kind, President Xia ...”

“County Head Zhu is an honored guest!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”come, this way please!”

Xia ruofei led Zhu zhihang and the others through the big office. After pushing open a door on the side, it was a different world. It was a reception room of more than 100 square meters.

The reception room was covered with soft wool carpet and was surrounded by a circle of wide, soft leather sofas. Calligraphy and paintings hung on three walls, and the entire side was a glass wall. The height of the top floor made the view of the reception room excellent. The entire reception room was very high – end in both decoration and style.

Zhu zhihang looked at it and sighed again.

This reception room was much better than the reception room in the county government. Moreover, this was only a small part of the chairman’s office. It was still the same saying,”it’s infuriating to compare people!”

Xia ruofei went straight to the side facing the door and against the wall. There were two sofas in the middle of this side, while the other sofas were on both sides in the shape of stars surrounding the moon, highlighting this position.

Xia ruofei and Zhu zhihang took their seats respectively. Zhu zhihang’s entourage also naturally found their seats on both sides according to their positions.

Zhou Yu quickly carried a tea tray and served everyone a cup of hot tea.

Zhu zhihang took a sip of the tea and smiled.””It’s really good tea! President Xia, I can only drink such authentic Da Hong Pao at your place. ”

Xia ruofei smiled.”You’re too kind, County Head Zhu. It’s our family’s tea. It’s not a precious variety.”

“No, no, no!” Zhu zhihang said,”although the production of Taoyuan Dahongpao is not high, it has a good reputation. It is definitely a treasure among the high – end tea leaves! Not to mention, this is President Xia’s private collection!”

Xia ruofei saw that Zhu zhihang was making small talk, but he was not in a hurry. He smiled and accompanied Zhu zhihang in circles.

Zhu zhihang was actually quite anxious, but he hoped to find a more natural entry point, or Xia ruofei could just ask. This way, he could smoothly lead the topic to the Tao Yuan pharmaceutical factory project.

However, Xia ruofei was not in a hurry at all and had no intention of taking the initiative to ask. Seeing that a few minutes had passed, Zhu zhihang finally could not hold it in.

He cleared his throat and said,””President Xia, I’ve come here to discuss something with you,” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Oh? Please go ahead, County Head Zhu. ” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“I heard that your company is preparing to build a new pharmaceutical factory,” Zhu zhihang went straight to the point.”I wonder how far this project has progressed?”

Xia ruofei had already expected what Zhu zhihang would ask. He smiled and said,””It seems that county Head Zhu is quite concerned about our company’s development! On behalf of the company, I thank you first!”

Zhu zhihang thought to himself,”although Xia ruofei is young, he’s obviously a cunning one!” How could he not know that our Changping County has always wanted to introduce this project? He was afraid that county Head Wu had already told him about the preferential conditions! Now, he was actually pretending to be confused.

However, Zhu zhihang did not say anything and did not show any displeasure. He just smiled at Xia ruofei and waited for him to continue.

“Our company is preparing to expand the scale of Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory in the near future.” Xia ruofei nodded and said,”we’re building a new branch. This project is progressing in an orderly manner, and it’s going very smoothly so far. I think it shouldn’t be long before we can start construction!”

Zhu zhihang’s heart trembled – start the construction! Could it be that they had a meeting just now and had already decided on the location of the pharmaceutical factory? In that case, there was no more hope for Changping?

For a moment, Zhu zhihang could not help but feel confused.

Shi Qingyuan, the director of the government office, saw that Zhu zhihang was distracted at the critical moment and could not help but feel anxious. He could not help but ask,””President Xia, may I ask where you plan to build the pharmaceutical factory?”
