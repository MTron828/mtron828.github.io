Chapter 677: Chapter 476_1

Very quickly, a quiet tea room was prepared.

Song Rui asked the waiter to leave and closed the door. Then, he turned around and walked back.

Xia ruofei asked,”song Rui, what’s going on?” He was so mysterious! Is there anything that needs to be so secretive?”

“It’s not a big deal, but it’s not convenient to talk about it in front of those people,” song Rui said seriously.”Let’s find a quiet place.”

Xia ruofei laughed as he leaned back in his chair.””Then tell me! What’s the matter?”

“Ruofei,” song Rui asked,”I’d like to ask you first. Do you have any good solutions for diabetes?”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment, then he smiled and asked,””Why are you suddenly asking about this? diabetes is scary, but it’s not usually fatal, right? It’s just that the patient needs to take the medicine for life. If it’s serious, she might need to be injected with insulin. If it’s well controlled, long – term survival is not a problem. ”

“Of course I know that.” Song Rui said,”I’m looking for you because I’m not satisfied with such conventional control! I’d like to know if you have any way to completely cure diabetes through Traditional Chinese Medicine?”

“You’re so young, you can’t possibly have diabetes, right?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

“Nonsense, of course it’s not me!” “You don’t have to be embarrassed,” song Rui scolded him with a smile.”Just tell me if you have a way. If you have a way, I’ll continue. If you don’t have a way, then we’ll stop talking about this. Just pretend I never mentioned it.”

Xia ruofei was silent for a moment before he slowly nodded and said, “There’s still a way, but ...”

“I know. It must be kept strictly confidential, right?” Song Rui immediately replied.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.

......

The rate of diabetes had been on the rise in recent years, especially in China.

According to statistics, there were as many as 114 million diabetic patients in China, which was equivalent to one in every ten adults.

Diabetes was an incurable disease. It could only be delayed by medication to prevent complications such as heart disease, kidney failure, and blindness.

Therefore, if the treatment of diabetes was made public, all kinds of trouble would come, and he would not be able to avoid it.

After all, many senior leaders were diagnosed with diabetes.

Song Rui said happily,”it’s good that there’s a way. Let’s continue on this topic.” As for keeping it a secret, you don’t have to worry at all. I, song Rui, have never cheated my brothers!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”of course I trust you!” Speak! What’s your relationship with the patient?” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“You should know about general Zhao Cheng, right?” song Rui asked.

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment, then shook his head in confusion.

Song Rui’s face was full of contempt as he said,””And you’re a soldier! You don’t even have a basic understanding of the high – ranking officers in the Army?”

Xia ruofei pouted and said,”aren’t you talking nonsense?” I’m just a soldier! It’s enough to know who our class monitor is!”

“Didn’t you become the class monitor a long time ago?”

“Do you understand what an analogy is?” Xia ruofei rolled his eyes and said,”what I mean is that not many ordinary soldiers would know the names of the commanders and commanders!”

Then, Xia ruofei said impatiently,””Just say it, kid! Who is this general Zhao?”

“The Chief of Staff of the Beijing military!” Song Rui said,”Lieutenant General.”

“Oh!” Xia ruofei nodded.”And then?”

“Chief of staff Zhao can be considered my grandfather’s old subordinate. He has always followed our family’s footsteps in politics. You know ...” Song Rui squinted his eyes and smiled.

“I understand, I understand. Please continue.”

“In fact, in the military, chief of staff Zhao is considered a high – ranking general in both his rank and position. The key is that he has the advantage of age, so my grandfather has always thought highly of him.” Song Rui said,”I only found out when I returned to Beijing this time that he was diagnosed with diabetes during his previous routine physical examination. It was already quite serious when it was discovered. Drug Control may not be effective. He might even need insulin ...”

“How could this be? All senior leaders have regular physical examinations, right?” Xia ruofei felt strange.

“My uncle Zhao is a bit secretive about his illness ...” Song Rui said with a bitter smile.”There is a physical examination every year, but he always says that there is no problem with this and that. Then, he doesn’t do many things. He’s such a big leader, the military hospital wouldn’t dare to force him to do it!”

“Woof! There’s such a thing ...”

“Isn’t that so?” Song Rui said,”I heard that he hasn’t done a sugar sieve for three years. This time, he found out that his diabetes is very serious. He was dumbfounded himself ...”

Xia ruofei laughed.”Song Rui,” he said,”with general Zhao’s behavior, even if I go and treat him, he won’t cooperate with the treatment!”

“He doesn’t dare to disobey the words of others, but he doesn’t dare to disobey my grandfather!” Song Rui said.

Song Rui continued,”but I’m just giving you a preliminary tip today. I’ll have to report it to the old man later!” It was just a spur of the moment idea. I didn’t expect to see you in Beijing!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”sure!” For your sake, I’ll take this job! Call me if you need anything ... Oh! But you’d better hurry! I’ve already finished my business in Beijing, so I want to return to San Shan as soon as possible!”
