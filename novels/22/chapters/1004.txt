Translator: 549690339

Song Rui took a few deep breaths before he managed to suppress his urge to go berserk.

He glared at Zhuo Yiyi, who was right in front of him, and waved his hand forcefully.

“Argh! Who is it!” Zhuo Yiyi jumped in shock and hurriedly took a step back. She looked at song Rui with a sullen expression.

Zhuo Yiyi’s face revealed a hint of doubt. She rubbed her eyes and sized song Rui up, causing him to feel goosebumps all over his body.

At this moment, Zhuo Yiyi asked uncertainly,””You are ... Uncle?”

Song Rui almost burst into tears. He roared in his heart,”My great aunt, you finally recognized me! Was this bro’s presence really that low? He was actually invisible in front of you ...

Although song Rui’s mind was full of thoughts, he was still very calm on the surface. He only nodded slightly and asked while suppressing his hidden bitterness,””Is there really nothing wrong with your eyesight?”

Zhuo Yiyi asked in surprise,”is he really an uncle?” You ... Why ... Have you ... Changed so much?”

Song Rui almost fainted. He shouted,””You’re the one who ‘s’ shit – like ‘!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t hold it in anymore and burst out laughing. Song Wei, who was trying to hold it in, burst out laughing when she heard Xia ruofei’s words.

However, Song Wei quickly stopped smiling and said to song Rui apologetically,””Uncle song Rui, Yiyi ... She has always been a Little Blind to faces. When it comes to recognizing people ... Hehe, please forgive her!”

Zhuo Yiyi sized song Rui up, then said seriously,””So you really are an uncle ...”

Xia ruofei laughed.”That’s enough. Stop fooling around. Get in the car!”

“Oh ...” Zhuo Yiyi nodded and looked at song Rui curiously, as if she couldn’t understand why he had changed so much in such a short time.

“Oh right, Song Wei, don’t you have motion sickness? You can sit in front!” Xia ruofei said.

Song Wei was stunned for a moment. When did I get carsick? However, her mind was very clever. When she heard this, she only nodded and said,””Alright!”

Zhuo Yiyi had originally wanted to sit in the front passenger seat, but after hearing Xia ruofei’s words, she went straight to the back seat.

After everyone got into the car, Xia ruofei started the engine and asked with a smile,””Song Wei, Zhuo Yiyi, where do you guys want to go?”

“I’ll listen to Yiyi!”Song Wei shrugged. Didn’t you say she would arrange it?”

Zhuo Yiyi sat in the back seat, and as she fastened her seatbelt, she tilted her head and thought for a moment before saying,””I remember the airport is by the sea, right? Why don’t we go to the beach? I’ll treat you guys to seafood tonight!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei nodded and stepped on the accelerator.

Xia ruofei was very familiar with the road from the city to the seaside because Taoyuan farm was located by the sea. He had gone back and forth countless times in the past year.

The car sped along the Second Ring Road. Zhuo Yiyi was still looking around like a curious baby, while song Rui, who was usually talkative, seemed to have become a little reserved. He sat upright and still beside Zhuo Yiyi.

Zhuo Yiyi stuck her head out and asked,”Oh right, brother ruofei, what do you do?” There were not many people in the country who could drive a Knight XV! You must be the big boss, right?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”then you’re wrong!” I’m just running a small business to support my family ...”

“A small business owner can drive a luxury car that’s worth tens of millions?” Disbelief was written all over Zhuo Yiyi’s face.”You’re not being so humble because you’re afraid that I’ll pester you, are you? Don’t worry! We only like cars, not gold – diggers!”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. This girl was too bold! He really didn’t have a filter on his words! T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Song Wei was both angry and amused. She turned around and glared at Zhuo Yiyi,””Woman, can’t you be a little more reserved? Can’t you be more ladylike?”

“It’s not like I want to hit on brother ruofei,” Zhuo Yiyi said nonchalantly.”Why do I need to act like a lady?!”

After song Rui heard this, he couldn’t help but touch his forehead. He felt that this woman was really hopeless. She dared to say anything! However, he did not know why, but after hearing this, he felt a little relieved.

“You want to hit on ... Bah bah bah, even if you want to pursue him, there’s no chance!” Song Wei said unhappily. Ruofei has a girlfriend! And she’s pretty and rich ...”

“Your girlfriend is rich?” The fire of gossip in Zhuo Yiyi’s eyes was instantly ignited. She could not help but look at Xia ruofei with a half – Smile and asked,””Could it be that brother ruofei is living off a woman ...”

“Hey!” Xia ruofei immediately protested.

Song Wei also said nervously at the same time,””Yiyi, don’t talk nonsense! RUO Fei’s own business is very big, and he’s very capable. Even my father has high praises for him!”

When Zhuo Yiyi heard this, she immediately gave Song Wei a meaningful look and said,””Even your father sees brother ruofei in a different light? Wei Wei, could it be that ... There’s something going on between you two?”

The speed of his attention shifting was comparable to the speed of light! This lady’s brain was definitely not the same as a normal person ‘S. Xia ruofei was speechless.

Song Wei’s face was also red. She could not help but say,”What nonsense are you talking about? Didn’t I tell you that RUO Fei already has a girlfriend?”
