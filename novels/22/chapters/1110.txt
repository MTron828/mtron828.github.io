Translator: 549690339

Elder song was stunned. After a while, he pointed at Xia ruofei and said with a bitter smile,””You little Xia ... You’re really multi – talented! I think even if you don’t own a company, you can live a very comfortable life with this unique skill of carving Jade ...”

Song Zhilan and song Rui also found it unbelievable, especially song Zhilan. After listening to the conversation between elder song and Xia ruofei, she noticed the carving of the Jade Guanyin and couldn’t help but take a few more looks.

She was also a well – informed lady from a wealthy family. Naturally, she had a lot of precious jewelry at home. However, the more she looked at this Jade Guanyin, the more she felt that it was not simple. It seemed to be without the slightest bit of smoke or fire. After looking at it a few more times, she actually felt a sense of immersion.

Elder song said as he took the Jade Guanyin out of the box and played with it in his hand.

As soon as the Jade Guanyin entered his hand, elder song couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows and said,””What?”

After all, elder song was an old man. Today was his birthday and he had spoken a lot. He even drank a few glasses of white wine. In fact, he was a little tired now. However, when he picked up the Jade Guanyin, he immediately felt a trace of coolness, and then his entire person became much more energetic.

“Little Xia, this Jade Guanyin ...” Despite elder song’s vast knowledge, he couldn’t help but reveal a shocked expression.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”chief, this jade pendant can clear your mind and focus your mind. It’s good for your health if you wear it for a long time.” And ...”

Xia ruofei hesitated for a moment before he continued,””If you drop a drop of your blood on it, the effect will be even more obvious!”

This spirit – gathering Jade Guanyin was the same as a protective jade talisman. It also needed to be bound by blood to unleash its full power.

With Xia ruofei’s current cultivation, he could secretly take a drop of elder song’s blood and drip it on the blood. He was confident that elder song would not notice.

However, after a moment of hesitation, he decided to tell the truth.

After all, elder song’s status was extraordinary, and this was the most basic form of respect. Of course, Xia ruofei had his own motives. Since Jian Jia had already given elder song such a big gift, how could she do it secretly? You should at least let him know so that he’ll accept your favor, right?

After elder song heard Xia ruofei’s words, his body could not help but tremble. He almost lost his grip on the spirit – gathering Jade Guanyin.

His eyes were filled with shock, and even his voice trembled slightly.””Little Xia, could it be ... Could it be that this Jade Guanyin ... Is a magical weapon?”

Xia ruofei was stunned. In his knowledge of cultivation, there was no such thing as a ‘magical weapon’. However, he could roughly understand that elder song’s so – called ‘magical weapon’ should be something with special effects that science could not explain. From this perspective, it was not impossible to say that the spirit gathering Jade Guanyin was a magical weapon.

Before Xia ruofei could speak, song Zhilan couldn’t help but say,””Dad! What kind of magic tool is this? You don’t really believe in those feudal superstitions, do you? And little Xia, isn’t this a little too ridiculous?”

Although song Zhilan had a good impression of Xia ruofei, there was a hint of blame in her tone. Xia ruofei had just “bewitched” elder song and even wanted elder song to drip his blood on the Jade Guanyin. In her eyes, this was simply too crazy.

Elder song was a Man of Gold! And how noble was his status? How could he do such a childish thing? If this were to spread out, wouldn’t he be laughed at?

Eccentric song’s face darkened. He snorted and said,”Zhilan, don’t make any comments about things you don’t understand! Just because you don’t understand it doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist!”

Elder song had once been one of the most powerful figures in the central administration, so he naturally had access to some secret information that ordinary people couldn’t access. He knew that there were some hidden experts in this world, as well as some special “magical artifacts.” These things couldn’t be explained by science, but they really existed.

As for the magical artifacts that eccentric song had learned, they were very magical. Some had great offensive power, some could nourish the body, change the aura, some could protect the body from evil, and so on.

Elder song had even seen a magic weapon with his own eyes. It was an ancient bracelet. The owner of this bracelet had a higher status than elder song at that time. During an inspection, he had encountered an accident and his car had been hit beyond recognition.

At that time, elder song was in the car behind them and saw the tragic impact with his own eyes. He thought that the leader would not survive, but he was unscathed, not even a hair was hurt. The guards and the driver in the car were all dead.

It was only after elder song became the central authority that he found out that the leader’s bracelet was a protective magic artifact.

That personal experience had left a deep impression on elder song of the magic tools.

Hence, when he heard that Xia ruofei needed to drip blood, the first thing he thought of was a magical weapon.

Song Zhilan didn’t expect her father to criticize her so severely. She felt very wronged and didn’t dare to say anything more. However, her gaze towards Xia ruofei was filled with blame.

Seeing that his grandfather was angry, song Rui was so scared that he didn’t even dare to breathe. He stood at the side and didn’t dare to make a sound.

After elder song reprimanded song Zhilan, he looked at Xia ruofei with a trace of eagerness.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”chief, I don’t know what magical weapon you’re talking about, but this jade pendant can only unleash its full effect after it recognizes its owner by blood. Its main function is to change one’s aura and gather the aura that’s good for the body. If one wears it for a long time, one’s body will be nourished unknowingly. It’s especially suitable for the elderly!”

“Then it must be a magic tool!” Eccentric song said excitedly. Little Xia, did you just say that you wanted to bind it with blood? How ... How do I do it?”

Elder song’s composure had already reached the peak of perfection, but he still couldn’t suppress his excitement. This was a magic tool! He would soon have a magic tool ...

Xia ruofei smiled.”It’s simple. You just need to drip your blood on the Jade. One drop is enough.”

“Good! I’ll try it now!” Elder song said impatiently.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but find it funny and said,””I’ll go! I’m a doctor after all!” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Then, Xia ruofei took out a small box from his bag and took out a silver needle for acupuncture. He gestured for elder song to give him his hand.

He lightly pricked eccentric song’s finger and then injected a small stream of zhenqi into it. A drop of blood immediately appeared on eccentric song’s fingertip.

As the blood dripped, Xia ruofei caught it with the Jade Guanyin.

Song Zhilan and song Rui also couldn’t help but stare at the Jade Guanyin.

Song Zhilan wanted to see Xia ruofei make a fool of himself. If the tadpole’s blood dripped on the smooth Jade, it would definitely flow away. Could it really make the Jade recognize its owner?

From the bottom of her heart, song Zhilan didn’t believe in things that went against the laws of science.

However, the reality made song Zhilan’s brain almost stop working. After the drop of blood fell on the Jade Guanyin, it was immediately absorbed by it. From the outside, no blood could be seen.

Moreover, the Jade Guanyin was made of a transparent, glass – Type, colorless Jade. Even if blood seeped in, it should be visible. After all, the Jade was almost transparent.

However, the drop of blood seemed to have evaporated. The entire jade pendant remained transparent and colorless, and there was no trace of blood inside.

When Xia ruofei saw song Zhilan’s expression as if she had seen a ghost, he couldn’t help but find it funny.

He handed the Jade Guanyin to elder song and said with a smile,”Chief, hold it in your hand and feel it.”

After elder song took the Jade Guanyin, Xia ruofei took two steps back and watched from the side with a confident smile.

The moment the Jade Guanyin entered his hand, elder song’s eyes immediately widened ...
