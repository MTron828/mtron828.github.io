2971 Getting your wish (3)

This wasn’t even a hint, it was an indication.

Hearing this, Wu Ming only laughed strangely and didn’t continue the conversation.

Anyway, no matter how Xia ruofei responded, the ore was in his hands.

As long as someone believed Wu Ming’s words, he would have profited. No one cared about what he said, and he didn’t lose anything.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel a little angry. This was the first time he felt disgusted by Wu Ming. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

However, when he thought about how the ore would soon belong to him, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be filled with anticipation.

Especially when he looked through the floor – to – Ceiling glass of the box and saw the fallen leaves sect disciple go up the stage to get the ore, and then go straight to the number 20 box. He couldn’t help but feel a burst of excitement in his heart.

Perhaps it could feel Xia ruofei’s mood, or perhaps it was because the ore was getting closer and closer to the private room, the spirit painting scroll in Xia ruofei’s palm was shaking more and more violently. Xia ruofei could not even suppress the shaking. He could only clench his fists so that Li Yifu and Luo Qingfeng would not notice anything unusual.

Fortunately, Xia ruofei’s control over the spirit map was no longer comparable to the past. Although the ore was following the fallen leaves sect disciples step by step towards room 20, after his active intervention, he had successfully restricted the spirit map and suppressed it.

Very quickly, there was a knock on the door. A disciple of the fallen leaves sect respectfully said,”Senior, this disciple has brought the item you won.”

Xia ruofei nodded at Li Yifu. Li Yifu immediately stood up and opened the door.

A fallen leaves sect disciple walked in with a tray in his hands. Just like when the item had first appeared, the tray was covered with a red silk cloth. However, Xia ruofei didn’t even need to lift the silk cloth to know that the ore was in the tray and it had not been swapped. This was because even though he had firmly suppressed the spirit painting, he could still feel the throbbing and jubilant emotions of the spirit painting. Especially after the fallen leaf sect disciple had entered, the throbbing of the spirit painting had reached its peak.

“Senior, please inspect the item!” The fallen leaf sect disciple said respectfully.

“No need.” Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”that’s 6010 spirit stones in total, right? You can count it. ”

As he spoke, he took out the spiritual stones from the spirit map space. There were exactly 6010 spiritual stones.

Naturally, the tray would not be able to fit so many spiritual stones. Hence, Xia ruofei used a cloth bag to store the spiritual stones. In fact, this cloth bag was also used to store the spiritual stones when the disciples of the fallen leaves sect delivered them.

The fallen leaf sect disciple clearly also had a certain level of spiritual power cultivation. He didn’t really use his hand to point at it, but rather held the cloth bag in his hand. After standing still for a while, he immediately said,”Senior! The number is correct, it’s exactly 6010 spirit stones!”

Xia ruofei nodded with a smile and said,””Since that’s the case, then we’ll settle the goods and money! You’ve worked hard!”

With that, Xia ruofei raised his hand and sucked the ore from the tray. He did not even look at it carefully and just kept it in the spirit map space. Of course, to Luo Qingfeng, Li Yifu, and the fallen leaf sect disciple, Xia ruofei had kept the ore in his storage treasure.

The falling leaf sect disciple was stunned for a moment and felt somewhat disappointed, but he still respectfully said,”This disciple will take his leave!”
