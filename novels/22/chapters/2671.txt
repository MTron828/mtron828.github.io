2672 Using the soul seal (1)

Although Liu Qingfeng felt that Xia ruofei was a little too anxious, he did not dare to say much and could only nod in agreement.

He felt that he was only here to clean up the mess. Since Xia ruofei, the “Island owner”, wanted to get rid of the “outsiders” as soon as possible, he was happy to “get out of this misery” as soon as possible.

After Xia ruofei gave his orders, he said indifferently,””Alright, I’m a little tired after being busy for half a day. Find me a place to rest for a while. Let me know when the transport plane is about to arrive.”

“Mr. Xia, then ... Then what about bainilatti?” Liu Qingfeng quickly asked.

“I left him in the lounge next door. Get a few people to keep an eye on him. We’ll talk about how to deal with him tomorrow!” Xia ruofei said.

“Alright!” Liu Qingfeng responded and quickly called two strong guards over. They went to the lounge and carried out benilatti, who was tied up like a dumpling.

Benilatti’s mouth was blocked, and he kept whimpering. He looked at Liu Qingfeng with eyes full of desire.

Liu Qingfeng turned his face and waved his hand, and two strong men directly carried benilatti away.

Xia ruofei ordered,”don’t let him have any contact with the outside world. Don’t hurt him either. I still have use for this person.”

“Yes, Mr. Xia!” Liu Qingfeng didn’t dare to delay and quickly agreed.

Then, Liu Qingfeng brought Xia ruofei to a luxurious suite upstairs to rest. After he personally sent Xia ruofei to his room, he tactfully took his leave.

Xia ruofei locked the doors and windows of the room and drew the curtains tightly. Then, he carefully scanned the entire room with his mental power to make sure that no one had installed any eavesdropping or recording devices.

The batch of materials that Li Yifu was personally escorting would be landing on Peach Blossom Island in a few hours. Xia ruofei asked Liu Qingfeng to arrange a room for him at this time. Naturally, he was not so tired that he wanted to sleep for a while.

He just needed an environment where he wouldn’t be disturbed, because he needed to devote himself to one thing and condense his soul seal. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

To be more precise, it was the child seal of the soul seal.

This was because he had already completed the condensation of the mother seal, and it was quietly staying in his sea of consciousness.

With Xia ruofei’s current cultivation, the mother seal in his sea of consciousness could control five child seals at the same time. In other words, he could have five soul slaves at most. And now, only one of the five spots had been used on Liu chengfeng, leaving four empty spots.

Today, he was prepared to use one of the slots on bainilatti.

Although benilatti was only an ordinary person and not a cultivator, it seemed a bit of a waste to use the soul seal on him. However, this person was very important at this stage. Compared to the overall strategy of the entire Paradise Island, it was worth it.

One must know that benilatti could directly contact Wang Boshan and the others. Through their cooperation for the past six months, benilatti had frequently transmitted key information to Wang Boshan. It should be said that he had already gained Wang Boshan’s trust. In Wang Boshan’s eyes, as long as he gave enough money, benilatti would definitely be a loyal dog.

This point was too important.

Other than taking in bainilatti as his soul slave, Xia ruofei could not guarantee that nothing would go wrong. If bainilatti spread the news, he would be in great danger unless he killed bainilatti.

Speaking of which, bainilatti’s crime did not warrant death, not to mention that he was still of great use.

At such a time, sending some information to Wang Boshan through benilatti would be very useful. At the very least, it would be very useful in delaying time.

This point alone was enough for Xia ruofei to use up one of the soul seal’s slots.

Furthermore, after using the soul seal, it was not the easiest way to get rid of it. If he killed bainilatti, the slot would naturally be empty. In addition, he could still strip away the child seal, so that the seal in the mother seal would naturally dissipate. There was a certain risk in removing the ion seal, but this risk was only for benilati. To Xia ruofei, there was no danger at all.

Hence, after some consideration, Xia ruofei made this decision.

After he locked the door and windows, he went straight to the bed in the bedroom and sat down cross – legged, then began to condense the child seal of the soul seal.

Before subduing Liu chengfeng, Xia ruofei had spent a lot of time and effort to form the soul seal. However, his main focus was on forming the mother seal. The child seal was much less complicated than the mother seal, so it was much easier to form. Besides, Xia ruofei already had experience, so he was more familiar with the process this time.

After a few tries and getting the feeling back, he closed his eyes and started to draw the soul seal.

After about half an hour, Xia ruofei had successfully condensed a brand new child seal.

He put the child seal into his spiritual ocean, and the child seal immediately began to slowly spin around the mother seal, like a satellite accompanying it.

Xia ruofei stood up and went to the bathroom to wash his face. He felt as if his entire spirit had been lifted.

He walked out of the room and said to the waiter who was waiting near the room,””You can ask where Liu Qingfeng is, I have something to talk to him about.”

“Alright! Please wait a moment!” The waiter quickly said.

He contacted them through the walkie – talkie and then said respectfully,””Mr. Xia, President Liu is in his office. He’ll be right up.”
