Xia ruofei also told Li Yifu that he would rush back as soon as possible after he finished his business here.

If the threat came from the first heaven society, Xia ruofei would not dare to take it lightly. No matter how careful he was, he would never be too careful.

After settling the affairs on the Peach Blossom Island, Xia ruofei took a few deep breaths to calm himself down.

Then, he gave Feng Jing a call and prepared to use the free time before he got off work to listen to her report.

Soon, Feng Jing came to Xia ruofei’s office with a huge stack of data and reports. She started to report to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei was more or less absent – minded, but in general, he was listening more seriously.

He also expressed his approval of some of Feng Jing’s decisions during his absence and gave her a lot of praise.

Unknowingly, it was already close to the end of the day.

Feng Jing’s report was also coming to an end.

In the end, Feng Jing said,”ruofei, that’s about all the work you’ve been doing for the past few days.” Now that the company’s cash flow is sufficient, I dare to start the park project. Since you support my approach, I can rest assured!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””Sister ran, you can do whatever you want! In the future, you’ll be in charge of the company’s decisions, big and small! Unless you think it’s related to the company’s life and death, you can call or send me an email to ask for my opinion. As for other things, you don’t have to ask for my opinion. ”

“It seems like you’ve made up your mind to be a hands – off shopkeeper ...” Feng Rao sighed.

“Chairman, I’ll still hang it. That’s no problem.” Xia ruofei said,”however, I will gradually let go of the company’s specific Affairs. I believe that this will not be a problem for you and the other members of the team. Moreover, from the long – term development of the company, this should be a good thing!”

“Alright then!” Feng Jing said,”paradise Corporation was developed by us. You have your own big things to do, so I can’t keep asking you to be tied to the company’s matters. Don’t worry, RUO Fei. As long as you don’t chase me away, I’ll definitely help you guard the foundation of the Paradise Corporation! And we’ll work hard to make it grow and become a great company!”

“Sister ran, I’m going to give you some more shares ...” Xia ruofei was slightly moved.

He saw that Feng Rao was about to reject him, so he immediately said,””Don’t be in a hurry to decline! I’ve already decided on this. You have a single – digit share now, but you have to worry about the company’s Affairs, big and small. This is not fair!”

“RUO Fei, I ...”

“Sister ran, let me finish! I’m going to give you 10% of the shares! In addition, he would take out 10% of the shares as an incentive for the senior executives, and another 10% as an option pool for the employee’s benefit. Of course, the so – called “everyone” was by no means equal! Employees had to reach a certain level before they had the chance to receive the option. In addition, they had to serve a certain number of years before they were allowed to cash out the option. Furthermore, the company had to buy it back and was not allowed to sell it to others! You’re more familiar with the operation of these shares than I am, so I won’t go into detail. ” Xia ruofei said.

Feng Jing’s eyes widened as she said,”ruofei, the company’s market value is in the billions!” It’s a huge loss for you to take out so many shares at once!” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Xia ruofei smiled nonchalantly and said,””I still own 70% of the shares, which is more than enough. Sister ran, do you think there’s any meaning to having so much money? It was just a set of numbers! I don’t mind if this set of numbers is a little more or less. But if I take out a part of it, it can make the company more ambitious, can make the senior management more stable, and can let more employees achieve financial freedom! Isn’t that good?”

Xia ruofei paused and continued,””Also, I’ll entrust you with my voting rights to ensure that you have absolute authority in the company!”

Feng Rao was dumbfounded. Xia ruofei had basically handed over all his power.

“Ruofei, that’s not right ...” Feng Jing quickly said after she regained her senses.”This is your company! You created it yourself!”

“But it was built by you and the other employees, brick by brick.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”sister che, although I’ve entrusted you with the right to vote, I still have the final say and one veto vote, so I’m not giving the company to you. It’s just that it’s more convenient for you to manage the company this way. You can make many decisions, and it’ll be legitimate!”

Xia ruofei didn’t wait for Feng Rao to say anything. He looked at his watch and said, “It’s almost time, I still have to go pick up Qingxue! Sister ran, that’s all for today! I’ll have to trouble you to come up with the specific plan in two days according to the procedure I just mentioned. I also hope that the share transfer can be completed in two days! You’ll be in charge of the specific work, I’ll just be in charge of signing!”

With that, Xia ruofei smiled and stood up. He picked up his handbag from the desk and walked out.

By the time Feng Jing came back to her senses, Xia ruofei had already left the office.

Feng Jing called out twice, but Xia ruofei pretended not to hear her. Instead, he walked even faster and soon disappeared from the door. He took the elevator to the underground parking lot.

Feng Jing stood in Xia ruofei’s office with a complicated expression on her face.

After a long while, she stomped her feet and muttered to herself,””What? He threw a bunch of things to me and then ran away! The matter of the equity structure is so important, but you decided it with just a few words and threw it all to me ... Seriously!”

……

Of course, Xia ruofei did not care about Feng Jing’s complaints. He was already standing in the elevator with a relaxed smile.

Xia ruofei had already considered giving a portion of the company’s shares to motivate the executives and employees, especially Feng Jing. He had thought about it carefully.

The wealth of the secular world no longer held much meaning to him.

However, the Paradise Corporation could not stop its development. The employees also needed this platform to display their talents and earn enough money to live a decent life.

It could be said that paradise Corporation was not just Xia ruofei’s company. It involved hundreds and thousands of employees, and behind them were hundreds and thousands of families.

Hence, Xia ruofei had to deal with everything related to paradise Corporation carefully.

Taking out less than 30% of the shares could produce an immediate incentive effect. In the long run, it was even more beneficial to the company’s healthy development. Why wouldn’t Xia ruofei do it?

After leaving everything to Feng Jing, he hummed as he walked out of the elevator. After he found his Knight XV, he drove straight to the headquarters of Ling Ji.

After picking up Ling Qingxue, he drove the Knight XV SUV and headed straight to the Provincial Party Committee’s courtyard.

Xia ruofei’s off – Road vehicle was too eye – catching. Song Qiming had already reported Xia ruofei’s car plate number at the gate. Hence, the armed police at the entrance of the courtyard only did a simple check and let them pass.

Xia ruofei drove skillfully through the roads in the courtyard and soon arrived at the small building hidden by the green trees.

This was song Qiming’s family’s residence in San Shan. It was a small Western – style house that had a very old sense of age.

Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue got out of the car together. Xia ruofei was about to ring the doorbell when Ling Qingxue stopped him and said,””RUO Fei, are we just going to come here empty – handed? Isn’t that a little rude?”

“I didn’t have time to prepare anything!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”besides, isn’t wild tea the best gift?”

“But we can’t just go in empty – handed!” Ling Qingxue said,”I’m prepared!”

Ling Qingxue then took out two fruit baskets and two bottles of beautifully packaged red wine from her storage ring. She then smiled and said,””Let’s go! I can do it now!”
