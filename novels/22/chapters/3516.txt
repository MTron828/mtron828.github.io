Chapter 3517: An unexpected reunion (2)

Translator: 549690339

In fact, everyone knew that Xia ruofei did not have a strong background. Once he became enemies with the song family, his career might take a heavy blow.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I know, don’t worry, brother Zhao!” I won’t act rashly.”

Xia ruofei knew that Zhao Yongjun was concerned about him, but he and the others didn’t know that the song family valued Xia ruofei far more than they had imagined. Besides, with Xia ruofei’s current cultivation and vision, he wouldn’t feel any pressure even if he fell out with the song family.

Of course, elder song was a senior that Xia ruofei respected very much. Besides, the song family treated Xia ruofei very well, so he would not easily break this relationship.

“As long as you know what you’re doing,” Zhao Yongjun said, smiling.

Then, Zhao Yongjun patted song Rui’s shoulder and said,””Xiao Rui, don’t blame big brother Zhao for speaking out of turn. If ruofei rashly spoke up for you, it might have the opposite effect. We still need to be careful with our strategy.”

“I know,” song Rui grinned.”Brother Zhao, you’re doing this for my own good. How can 1 blame you?”

Xia ruofei then greeted the others and walked into the main building of the clubhouse.

As for his car that was parked at the entrance, the staff would naturally Park it in the VIP parking space.

Everyone went to the reserved luxury private room, sat around the coffee table, and began to make tea and chat.

Naturally, Xia ruofei also learned about the club’s operations from everyone.

Xia ruofei was one of the shareholders of the club! However, he wasn’t involved in the club’s daily operations and he didn’t lack money, so he didn’t care about the club and left it to Zhao Yongjun and the others to manage.

Of course, Zhao Yongjun and the others wouldn’t lock themselves up in the club. They had a wide circle of friends and had other businesses, so they had hired a professional team to manage the club. However, the decisions that needed to be made in the operation were all discussed and done by Zhao Yongjun and the others.

Their fathers had a very good relationship with each other, and their political ideals were very similar. Therefore, as juniors, they were very close to each other. Running this club together was also a very strong bond, which made everyone even closer.

The club’s business was booming. The high – end route and the tiered membership system that everyone had initially set up were now effective. Just the membership fees and pre – charge funds brought a large amount of cash flow to the club.

Not only was this place an excellent place for people in the circle to interact, but the environment was also very good. The environment around Beijing was similar to this place, and there were a few clubs that were even better than this place. However, everyone felt comfortable staying in Paradise Club. They felt refreshed, as if the atmosphere was particularly compatible.

This was the effect of the array. Zhao Yongjun and the others attributed it to Feng Shui. After all, Xia ruofei had personally reversed the Feng Shui and even invited a Feng Shui Master to take a look, so they believed it without a doubt.

As for the inside story, only Xia ruofei knew.

It was precisely because of this combination of auras under the effect of the formation that the wastrels of the capital’s upper – Class circle liked to go to the Paradise Club when they had nothing to do. This naturally led to the business of the Paradise Club becoming more and more popular.

Even the sales of Ling Ji’s private kitchen had reached new heights, especially the secret Buddha Jumps Over the Wall, which was in short supply every day.

Xia ruofei, Zhao Yongjun, and the others sipped their tea and chatted about their recent situation. The sky outside was gradually getting dark and they were almost done with their tea. Thus, everyone got up and went to the large dining table in the private room, taking their respective seats.

Xia ruofei smiled.”Xiao Rui, 1 forgot to tell you. 1 brought two boxes of wine. They’re in the trunk of my car. Arrange for someone to bring them over!”

The two boxes were filled with Drunken Eight Immortals, and there were a total of twelve bottles. It should be enough for everyone to drink tonight.

“Alright!” Song Rui responded and called the waiter over to give him some instructions. The waiter quickly nodded and left the room.

After a while, the waiter brought the two security guards back to the room. The two security guards each carried a box of wine.

Song Rui looked at the packaging and said with a smile,””It seems like we’re in for a treat today! Ruofei’s Drunken Eight Immortals is a limited edition that can’t be bought in the market!”

“Yup! That’s a good wine that can’t be bought with money!”

“It’s not just money that can’t buy it! Even if you have connections, you might not be able to buy it!”

“I’m craving for this! The taste of the Drunken Eight Immortals is even better than the Maotai Wuliangye …”

Everyone was talking about it.

At this moment, Zhao Yongjun’s phone rang. He smiled and said,””Brothers, let’s open the wine and drink! I’m going to take a call!”

Zhao Yongjun took his phone and left the room. Song Rui asked the waiter to open the wine and pour it into a few wine scoopers. Then, he poured the fragrant Drunken Eight Immortals white wine into everyone’s glasses.

At this time, a few cold dishes and a platter had just been served. In addition, Zhao Yongjun had gone out to take a call, so everyone didn’t touch their chopsticks. They chatted while waiting.

After a while, Zhao Yongjun pushed open the door and walked in. He smiled and said,””Brothers, we have another customer today. 1 added him at the last minute!”

Song Rui couldn’t help but ask,”brother Jun, could it be some sister – in – Law?” You can’t do this! We said we wouldn’t bring any family members today, and our Yiyi isn’t here either!”

“Xiao Rui, don’t talk nonsense!” Zhao Yongjun quickly waved his hand.”If this gets out, I’ll be in serious trouble!”

Hearing this, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be curious.””Big brother Zhao, who is he? Even you are so afraid …”

“Hehe! I’m not afraid of him, but his identity is a little special!” Zhao Yongjun smiled and said,”you all know this person. Alright, I won’t talk to you anymore! His car has already entered the courtyard, I’ll go out to welcome him! You guys can wait in the private room! It’s not good to make it too Grand, I’m afraid people won’t be used to it!”

Then, Zhao Yongjun quickly walked out of the room with his phone.

Everyone looked at each other and song Rui couldn’t help but say,””Big brother Zhao, you’re still keeping us in suspense. Who is this Big Shot? Even he has to personally welcome them.”

“Maybe he’s not a Big Shot…” Xia ruofei said with a smile.”Alright, alright. Stop guessing. We’ll see him when he comes, right?”

“I’m just curious, brother Zhao!” Song Rui picked up a piece of braised meat and put it in his mouth. He muttered as he chewed.

Actually, Xia ruofei was also curious. However, he did not release his spiritual power to check. Firstly, it was impolite. Secondly, he wanted to leave some suspense.

Sometimes, having foresight wasn’t always a good thing. It was quite good to retain some of the fun of ordinary people. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

They didn’t have to wait for long. After about three to five minutes, the door to the private room was pushed open.

Everyone looked up at the door in unison.

He saw a beautiful woman with bright eyes standing beside Zhao Yongjun, who was also looking at everyone.

Everyone was surprised. Song Rui couldn’t help but shout,””Lu You? When did you return to the country?”

No one expected Zhao Yongjun to bring back this miss Lu after keeping them in suspense for so long.

No wonder when song Rui joked, Zhao Yongjun immediately denied it. If there were any rumors, Zhao Yongjun wouldn’t be able to take it! Lu You was almost engaged to song Rui in the past. Everyone could tell that she seemed to have feelings for Xia ruofei.

However, for some unknown reason, she went abroad to study. She didn’t expect to come back before the Spring Festival.

When Lu You’s gaze landed on Xia ruofei, it was obvious that she was shocked. At the same time, a hint of panic flashed in her eyes.

Xia ruofei was also very surprised.

However, what surprised him even more was that…. He actually felt a faint spiritual energy fluctuation from Lu You!
