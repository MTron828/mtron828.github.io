Chapter 1287: The shares (1)

Feng Jing looked at Xia ruofei and nodded.””I agree! It’s also a reflection of our strength that our company is able to take down an entire office building in the city center. Moreover, the company is developing so fast now, and the office space will definitely need to be expanded in the future. If we can take down the performance in one go, it will also be beneficial for our future development!”

“Then let’s try to touch it!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”but we don’t have to take the initiative. Bojun’s side wants to cash out, so they must be short of funds. They’re the ones who are anxious. They can still lower the price if we give them the cold shoulder.”

This transaction was not a small sum. Not long ago, the peach blossom company bought the assets of the electricity Construction Group. They had six floors in total from 10 to 15 floors, and the transaction price reached 270 million Yuan. On the other hand, bojun real estate had nine floors from 1 to 9, and the market price was close to 400 million Yuan. It was a large sum of money even if the price was slightly lowered.

“I understand,” Feng Jing nodded.”Chairman, I still have some concerns ...”

“Go ahead,”

“Since there’s a problem with bojun real estate’s capital chain, they’ll definitely request for the full payment and the payment time to be as soon as possible. I don’t think they’ll accept the installment payment plan.” Feng ke said.

As the company’s general manager, Feng Jing was well aware of the company’s cash flow.

After the sales of the Jade skin cream, the money on the account of the Paradise company increased a lot, but in fact, the expenses were also quite high.

Paradise corporation’s employees generally had higher salaries than other companies in similar industries. Recently, they had been frequently recruiting new people, and their current employee team had already exceeded 300 people. Their monthly salary expenditure was in the millions.

In addition, he had also paid the down payment of 100 million for the purchase of the building not long ago. Most of the cash flow from the sale of the jaded skin cream had been spent, and the remaining 170 million had to be paid within three months.

If they didn’t consider the nine – story building of bojun real estate, the Paradise Corporation still had plenty of funds. But if they really wanted to buy the remaining floors, even if the Jade skin cream was sold two more times in such a short period of time, and even if those cooperating channels returned the money as quickly as possible, it would still be impossible to reach 400 million.

Xia ruofei nodded.”We won’t consider the installment plan. They definitely won’t accept it. Otherwise, there’s no need to sell such a good location.”

“Understood!” Feng Rao said. Chairman, I’ll contact the bank in the next few days. ”

“Contact the bank?” Xia ruofei asked curiously,”why?”

“I’m applying for a loan!” Feng Rao said matter – of – factly,”our company has a lot of high – Quality assets, especially the pharmaceutical factory. It’s like a hen that lays golden eggs. With the pharmaceutical factory as collateral, it’s not a problem to take out a loan of one or two hundred million. With the return from the sales of the Yushi cream, it’ll be enough to pay for the bojun real estate project!”

“A loan from the bank?” Xia ruofei thought for a moment and said,”forget it! I can solve the funding problem. ”

Feng Jing didn’t know whether to laugh or cry,”Chairman, don’t tell me you’re never going to get a loan from the bank?” Which business didn’t have debts? Our company’s debt – to – debt ratio has always been zero, this is simply a miracle in the industry ... Even with a loan of one or two hundred million, our company’s debt – to – debt ratio is still very low. Our financial situation is also very healthy, so there’s no need to worry at all. ”

If a professional organization was asked to estimate the value of the Paradise company, the company’s market value should not be less than 1 billion with the addition of the Paradise Farm, the Paradise manufacturing factory, and half of the shares of Australia’s Paradise Farm.

The main reason was that the value of Paradise Farm was very high. In addition, the sudden rise of the jaded skin cream would also directly pull up the value of the entire pharmaceutical factory.

In this way, the debt rate of a loan of one or two hundred million was only a little more than ten percent, which was already very low.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”CEO Feng, our company’s business model has decided that we don’t need large – scale expansion or large – scale expansion of stores. Moreover, our core competitiveness is still technology. Therefore, it’s normal to operate with zero – debt!”

“Of course I know that. That’s why I never said anything about taking a loan from the bank!” Feng Jing laughed bitterly. Wasn’t he lacking funds to buy a building? All the problems would be solved if he took out a loan. With the speed of our company’s development and the money – making ability of the jaded skin cream, a debt of one or two hundred million Yuan is not a problem at all. ”

“I’ll take care of the funding problem. ” Xia ruofei smiled.”If you really can’t gather enough, we’ll apply for a loan. We’ll prepare 400 million Yuan. You can transfer as much money as you can. Give me a figure when the time comes and I’ll think of a way.”

Xia ruofei then said half – jokingly,””The interest rate of bank loans is not low. I don’t want them to earn this money.”

“Stingy!” Feng Rao laughed. How much is the interest? Who knew how many companies would want to take a loan from the bank! They dared to take whatever the bank approved, so who would care about the interest? Sometimes, when you’re in trouble with funds, you’ll borrow from usury in a short term!”

“I was just joking!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”by the way, I have some ideas about the company’s human resource structure.”

Once Xia ruofei started talking about business, Feng Jing immediately sat up straight and listened.
