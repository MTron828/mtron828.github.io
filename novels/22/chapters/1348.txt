Chapter 1349: Completely ignoring_1

Translator: 549690339

Liu Zhe raised his head awkwardly and looked at Xia ruofei. He squeezed out a smile that was uglier than a crying face.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.”Quickly get up, quickly get up!”

“Liangzi, what’s the situation?” he asked Hou Liang. Liu Zhe is my friend. How did he end up squatting there?”

“Ah!” Hou Liang exclaimed and quickly walked over.

Liu Zhe was still crouching there, his face covered in dust and dirt, not daring to move. He was considered a prominent figure in the three mountains, but this was the first time he had been reduced to such a sorry state.

Hou Liang quickly helped Liu Zhe up and said,””Brother, it’s a misunderstanding, a misunderstanding, a misunderstanding ... I really didn’t know you were RUO Fei’s friend! Why didn’t you explain? I just saw you with these idiots, so ... Sigh! Wasn’t this the same as flooding the temple of the Dragon King? It’s all my brother’s fault! Blame me, blame me ...”

“Young master hou, I ... I did come here with tianchu and the others ...” Liu Zhe said hurriedly.

Hou Liang couldn’t help but reveal a hint of bewilderment.

At this moment, Xia ruofei walked over and said,””Liu Zhe, why are you saying this? You are you, Tian Xiaojun is Tian Xiaojun, do I have to be so unreasonable?”

Hou Liang immediately came back to his senses and said,”Yes, yes, yes! Brother, it’s all my fault for letting you suffer! How about this, I’ll arrange a banquet to apologize to you today!” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“No need, no need ...” Liu Zhe hurriedly said.

He was flattered. At the same time, he had a new understanding of Xia ruofei’s power. Tian Xiaojun, who was so powerful in his eyes, did not even dare to breathe loudly when he met Hou Liang. Hou Liang did not even look at Tian Xiaojun. However, because of Xia ruofei’s words, Hou Liang’s attitude immediately changed 180 degrees. He was even more intimate than a real brother. This explained the problem.

In the past, Liu Zhe only thought that Xia ruofei was close to Song Wei and even the song family. He was also more straightforward, so he was willing to be friends with Xia ruofei. However, he still thought that Xia ruofei was just taking advantage of Song Wei.

After today’s events, Liu Zhe finally realized that Xia ruofei did not need to bask in Song Wei’s glory. He was completely qualified to be on equal terms with Song Wei. Perhaps even song Wei’s influence was not as great as Xia ruofei ‘s.

At least Liu Zhe knew that Song Wei’s status wasn’t enough for these rich Playboys in the capital to treat her like this.

“I must apologize!” Hou Liang said with a serious expression. You have to admit your mistakes! “I, Hou Liang, am not an unreasonable person ...”

“This ...” Liu Zhe’s expression was troubled.

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Liu Zhe, liangzi, let me say something. There’s no need for such a formal apology. We’re all friends, so Liu Zhe should go in as well. Liangzi can just give Liu Zhe a toast.”

“I think it’s fine! Let’s do this!” Hou Liang chuckled.

Liu Zhe’s head was spinning. He did not dare to imagine that he would actually have the opportunity to drink and have fun with these top – notch nouveau riches of the capital. He had even been called “brother” by Hou Liang.

One must know that this wasn’t just a qualification that could be used to show off, but also a real benefit. Not only for him, but also for his father, it was a rare opportunity.

Liu Zhe felt like he was in a dream. Xia ruofei patted Liu Zhe’s shoulder and asked,””Why are you in a daze? I’m asking you a question. ”

“Ah?” Liu Zhe snapped out of his daze and asked in embarrassment,”did I disturb you guys too much ...”

“What are you saying?” Xia ruofei said angrily,”it’s just a small gathering for friends. My brothers from Beijing came to San Shan to play. I didn’t want to invite anyone else, but since you’re here today, we’re all my friends. What’s the matter with having a meal together?”

Liu Zhe knew that Xia ruofei was trying to help him.

He was also very touched. After all, he was the reason why Tian Xiaojun could find Xia ruofei so quickly.

Although he was unwilling and had no other choice, and he had informed Xia ruofei in advance, he still played the role of an accomplice.

Not only did Xia ruofei not blame him, but he even helped him. Liu Zhe was convinced by Xia ruofei’s generosity.

Liu Zhe was now aware of Xia ruofei’s capabilities. He had only contributed a little when he bought the Heng Li building at the peach blossom company. How could he not be touched when Xia ruofei returned the favor?

Liu Zhe looked deeply at Xia ruofei and nodded his head.””Alright, brother Xia, I’ll do as you say!”

“That’s right!”Hou Liang said with a smile.

Xu Zixuan and Wei Jun also returned Liu Zhe’s friendly smile. Compared to the treatment Tian Xiaojun had just received, this was like heaven and hell.

“It’s cold outside, let’s go in!” Xia ruofei said.

At this moment, Zhao Yongjun’s hearty laughter came from not far away,””Why is it so lively? Are you guys waiting for me?”

Xia ruofei was already walking towards the courtyard, but when he heard Zhao Yongjun’s voice, he turned around and smiled.

“Big brother Zhao! You’re late!” Xia ruofei said,”be more conscious of your punishment later!”

“No problem!” Zhao Yong Jun said heroically,”your Drunken Eight Immortals is a good wine! I’ll take this opportunity to drink a few more cups, haha!”
