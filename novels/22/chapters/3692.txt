Chapter 3693: RUO Fei’s banquet (2)

“Sect leader mu, you must be joking. Where do I get the strength to take care of her?” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”alright, it’s late. I’ll go to the kitchen first!” Please feel free to take a seat. Brother Chen, I’ll have to trouble you to take care of senior mu and the others!” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“No problem! I’ll make some tea!” Chen Xuan chuckled.

Xia ruofei then said to Lu You and Yu xiner,””The two of you should also accompany the two seniors, brother Chen, and brother Jian Fei for a chat! I’ll be fine by myself, I don’t need your help.”

He wasn’t sure about Yu Xin ‘er’s cooking skills, but he knew Lu You’s cooking skills.

If she went to the kitchen to help, she would only be able to help more and more.

Furthermore, he had to take out ingredients from the spirit map space to prepare dinner. If he took out all the lively fish, lobsters, and abalones, wouldn’t yu Xin ‘er and Lu You be shocked?

After all, ordinary Storage Treasures could not store living things. If Xia ruofei could take out so many living things, he must have a more advanced method.

The secret of the spirit map space might be leaked.

Hence, Xia ruofei naturally did not need any help.

“Xiner, since fellow Daoist Xia has said so, then you should stay here!” Liu Mansha said with a smile.

“Yes! Master!” Yu Xin ‘er replied respectfully, but she felt a little disappointed.

These courtyards were all equipped with kitchens. Although they did not have modern kitchen appliances, they still had all the kitchenware needed for cooking.

Xia ruofei had casually set up a shielding talisman to prevent Chen Xuan and Mu Sheng from spying on him while he was cooking. This was just a normal precaution.

Then, Xia ruofei took out a large amount of ingredients from the spirit map space.

Even the blue lobsters in the space ocean had multiplied by quite a bit. Xia ruofei had specially picked a big one and extracted it.

There were also abalones, tuna, and large crabs …

Xia ruofei even took out a few sea urchins and prepared to make sea urchin egg stew.

This meal was mainly seafood, so there were not many complicated cooking procedures. Although it was not as convenient as a modern kitchen, Xia ruofei still easily made a big meal.

Xia ruofei poked his head out of the kitchen and smiled.””Come on! Young people, come over and help serve the dishes!”

Lu You, Yu Xin ‘er, and mu Jianfei quickly ran over.

When Lu You saw the dazzling array of delicacies, she couldn’t help but smile and say,””You’re too amazing! There’s even a giant lobster … Ruofei, why are these lobsters blue?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I guess it’s mutated!” But don’t worry, there’s definitely no poison!”

Then, Xia ruofei said,”come, come, come!” Everyone, please take it out! Today’s main course was noodles! I’ll drink it when I’m done!”

Xia ruofei also personally carried a dish and walked out with Lu You and the rest.

Mu Sheng looked at the table that was filled with delicious food and felt a little embarrassed. He smiled and said,””Little brother Xia, I was just joking. 1 didn’t expect you to really cook so many dishes. This is …”

Mu Sheng originally thought that if Xia ruofei cooked personally, he would only make one or two dishes for show and let the disciples of the first heaven society prepare the rest. He didn’t expect Xia ruofei to be so serious and prepare a seafood feast by himself.

Xia ruofei laughed and took out a wine jar from the spirit map space.”Since it’s a thank you, you must be sincere! Please take a seat, everyone!”

After everyone had taken their seats, Xia ruofei opened the clay seal of the wine jar and said with a smile,””This wine was just given to me by brother Chen, so I’m offering it to Buddha with borrowed flowers! Seniors and fellow Daoists, please fill it up!”

Everyone poured their wine. Xia ruofei picked up his bowl and smiled.””Let’s drink the first bowl of wine together!”

After everyone had finished a bowl of wine, Xia ruofei said,””Come on! Try my cooking!”

The ingredients produced by the spirit map space were all first – Class, and Xia ruofei’s cooking skills had been improving all this time. Therefore, even the cultivators who had eaten and seen the food couldn’t help but give a thumbs – up to the food Xia ruofei had prepared.

After Mu Sheng toasted Xia ruofei alone, he wiped his mouth and said with a smile,””Little brother Xia, you must have gained a lot today! Especially after he entered the state of cultivation, his improvement must have been significant!” Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””! have indeed made some progress. I have to thank sect leader Chen for sharing it selflessly!”

Xia ruofei had been cultivating for a few hours and his cultivation had indeed improved a lot.

Although he was cultivating with crystals in his hands, and he was cultivating in the back mountain of the first heaven society, the effect of his cultivation was even better than when he was cultivating in the environment of the fiery Emperor building on Peach Blossom Island, which was supported by double arrays, and with the more precious purple essence crystals.

In just a few hours of cultivation, Xia ruofei could clearly feel the bottleneck of the advanced stage of the Golden elixir realm.

If he had only seen the hope of breaking through to the late – Stage of the Golden elixir realm before, he had now truly touched the bottleneck.

Chen Nanfeng’s lecture had enlightened Xia ruofei, and he had to accept this favor.

Mu Sheng and the others naturally did not probe Xia ruofei’s cultivation level as it was taboo. Hence, they just skipped the topic.

In comparison, they were more interested in the opportunity that Chen Nanfeng had said was a gift for everyone.

Therefore, Mu Sheng, who had the most forthright character, couldn’t help but ask,””Nephew Chen, what is the opportunity that brother Nanfeng was talking about? There are no outsiders here, so just tell us in advance!”

“Sect leader mu, you should be able to guess it!” Chen Xuan chuckled. The first heaven society can be said to be poor now, and this is the only gift we can give as a token of thanks …”

Mu Sheng’s eyes lit up and he asked tentatively,””Is it really that treasure? Brother Nanfeng is actually willing to take it out for everyone to use?”

Mu Sheng and Chen Nanfeng had a good personal relationship, so he knew about the seven Star Pavilion and even had some understanding of its functions.

However, a treasure like the seven Star Pavilion was too precious. Even if 30% of the cultivators could improve their talent, it was still quite an amazing thing. Therefore, although he had some speculations, he did not dare to think in this direction.

Hearing this, Chen Xuan nodded his head and replied,””Lord father is sincerely thanking everyone this time. Naturally, he has to bring out the best things!”

Liu Mansha couldn’t help but say,””I say… Since we’ve already said this much, stop playing riddles and tell us!”

The other younger members of the family, including Shen Hu and Lu You, could not help but prick up their ears.

In truth, these Qi condensation cultivators were the ones who were most concerned about this opportunity.

In comparison, Aurous core stage cultivators didn’t have much hope. After all, at their level of cultivation, they would need to pay a lot of resources to improve even further.

Lu You had heard about it from Xia ruofei yesterday. Even Xia ruofei felt that it was a pretty good opportunity. Naturally, she was itching to know what it was.

“Valley Head Liu,” Chen Xuan said with a smile,”everyone will find out tomorrow. But since you’ve asked, there’s no harm in telling you in advance.”

With that said, Chen Xuan did not beat around the bush and went straight to the point, explaining the situation of the seven Star Pavilion to everyone.

Other than Xia ruofei and Mu Sheng, the others were all surprised.

If it was to increase cultivation or spiritual power, it would not have such an effect. But to increase cultivation talent, this was really a bit heaven – defying.

Even though Chen Xuan had already mentioned that the probability of this happening wasn’t very high, no one would think that they were inferior to others. Even if the probability was low, they would still feel that they would be one of the people who would be able to successfully raise their talent.

“Young leader Chen, can golden core cultivators also increase their cultivation talent?” Liu Mansha asked with some excitement..
