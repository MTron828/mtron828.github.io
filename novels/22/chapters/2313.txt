Xia ruofei nodded. With a wave of his hand, the time array flags were set up around the array and the spirit gathering array was activated.

In the spirit map space, Xia ruofei could do anything with ease. Moreover, with the upgrade of the space, his control of the space had also become more and more comfortable.

Xia ruofei was getting more and more access to the space.

For example, in the past, only Xia ruofei could enter the cave stone chamber in the mountain sea realm or the realm Heart island in the sea. After the spatial realm was upgraded, he could temporarily give Xia Qing the authority. This time, Xia Qing was the one who entered the realm Heart Island to transplant the heart concentrating grass.

Xia ruofei said to Xia Qing,”take good care of it. If it doesn’t have enough spiritual crystals, you have the right to use it directly. You don’t need to ask me.” In addition, you can directly collect the medicinal part after it matures and boil it into a spirit medicine, then inform me!”

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing said respectfully.

“Thank you!” Xia ruofei nodded.

Xia Qing had indeed suffered a lot. Xia ruofei had said this to Xia Qing countless times. If Xia Qing was not a spiritual puppet but a human being with flesh and blood, according to the intensity of his work, even if he did not die of exhaustion, he would probably have a mental breakdown. After all, no one could work endlessly without rest.

However, Xia ruofei’s current spiritual power cultivation was not enough, so he could not create new spiritual spirals to help Xia Qing. Everything in the space had to be taken care of by Xia Qing, which was something that could not be helped.

Xia Qing bowed to Xia ruofei and said,”master, you’re too polite!” This is your subordinate’s duty. ”

Xia ruofei nodded and gently patted Xia Qing’s shoulder. Then, he left the space.

The growth cycle of the heart – concentrating grass was as long as ten years. Even in a situation with abundant spiritual Qi, it was impossible to shorten the time by much.

Now, Xia ruofei was using the double effects of the Archean realm and the time array flag to allow the heart – concentrating grass to grow in an environment where time was accelerated by almost 2000 times. At the same time, he was using precious spirit crystals to provide the energy needed for the heart – concentrating grass to grow. Even so, it would still take two to three days for a stalk of heart concentrating grass to grow to a mature state.

Xia ruofei could not do anything for the next two to three days. However, he was still worried about song Qiming’s condition. Besides, there might be enemies hiding in the dark who would harm Song Wei and Fang Liyun. Therefore, he did not stay at home. He made a simple lunch at home, cleaned up after eating, and left for the hospital.

Because Xia ruofei had shamelessly taken Ling Qingxue’s car on their way here, he was now digging his own grave by forcing his car to be parked in the hospital’s parking lot. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Hence, he could only walk to the entrance of the community to hail a taxi.

Xia ruofei walked around the neighborhood for a while and unknowingly arrived at Feng Jing’s townhouse.

In fact, this was not the only way to the entrance of the community. It was just that Xia ruofei was thinking about something just now, so he habitually took this slightly longer route.

He looked up at Feng Jing’s townhouse and was slightly taken aback.

The decoration of this small terrace seemed to be almost complete. From the outside, one could see that the outer wall had been cleaned. On the terrace above, there were some green plants and grape racks made of anti – corrosion wood. The decoration garbage at the door had been cleaned up.

“The speed of the renovation is quite fast!” Xia ruofei muttered to himself.

As he continued to walk towards the entrance, he took out his phone and gave Feng Jing a call.

“Mr. Chairman, why didn’t you come to the company after coming back from Beijing?” “You’re getting lazier and lazier!” Feng Rao said in a daze.

Xia ruofei was stunned and said embarrassedly,””Sister che, how did you know I was back?”

“I’m a great fortune – teller!”Feng Jing chuckled.

“Woof! I didn’t expect our sister che to have such an ability!” Xia ruofei laughed.”Then can you tell me where I am now?”

“You’re always so elusive, how could I have predicted it?”Feng Rao pouted. I won’t tease you anymore! When I was returning to the community, I saw that your car was not in the courtyard. I knew that you must have been back!”

“Ah? You’re in the neighborhood?” Xia ruofei said,”I don’t think there’s anyone in your house!”

“I just came out!” Feng Jing replied,”the renovations over there have been completed. The house is now being ventilated!” The weather forecast said that it would rain in the afternoon, so I’ll go back in the afternoon and close the doors and windows!”

“Such a coincidence? Where are you now? Did you drive?” Xia ruofei quickly asked.

“Of course I’m driving!” Feng Jing replied,”I just left the neighborhood! Are you also in the neighborhood?”

“Isn’t that so? Sister ran, can you turn around and come back to pick me up?” Xia ruofei said.

“Alright!” “Where are you?” Feng Rao asked readily.

“I’m walking towards the entrance of the community! We just passed by your house. You’ll see me if you drive back along this road!” Xia ruofei said.

“Just wait!” Feng Jing hung up after saying that.

Xia ruofei kept his phone and continued to walk forward. Soon, he saw Feng Jing’s Orange Volkswagen Beetle driving over from the opposite side. He quickly waved at the car.

Feng Jing was now considered a rich lady. Although she could not cash out her shares of paradise Corporation, Xia ruofei was still giving her an annual salary of a million dollars. Furthermore, she was not used to using the company’s car everywhere she went, so she bought this car for her personal use.
