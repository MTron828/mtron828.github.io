Translator: 549690339

Yu mingdong’s face suddenly showed a hint of embarrassment. He said carefully,””Mr. Xia, it’s like this ... The public Jade bid in Ruizhou will officially begin this afternoon. This public Jade bid is more important to me ...”

Yu mingdong looked at Xia ruofei carefully and said quickly,””Mr. Xia, don’t worry. I’ve already contacted the supplier. You’ll get the goods by tomorrow morning at the latest! If everything goes well at the public Jade bid, we can even do it tonight!”

It was obvious that Ma Zhiming had a very important place in Yu mingdong’s heart. He even had some respect for Ma Zhiming. Therefore, Yu mingdong did not dare to neglect the task that Ma Zhiming had entrusted to him. He was also very careful when he spoke to Xia ruofei.

Although Xia ruofei was anxious, he didn’t want to force her. He nodded and said,””Yes, it’s more important for President Yu to do your own things well!”

“Thank you for your understanding, Mr. Xia!” Yu mingdong then explained,”in fact, the supplier also has to participate in the public Jade bid, so even if I don’t go to the public Jade bid this afternoon, we may not be able to buy the Jade material ...”

“President Yu, you don’t have to explain.” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I’ve already caused you a lot of trouble by coming over this time. How can I delay your important business?”

“You’re too kind, Mr. Xia. ” Yu mingdong heaved a sigh of relief and continued,”Mr. Xia, this must be your first time in Ruizhou! In fact, the public Jade bid is also very interesting. Mr. Xia, you may want to go and have a look in the afternoon. By the way, I’ve hired a very good stone gambling consultant this time. I’ll ask him for advice. Mr. Xia, you can also buy a few stones to play with! Just treat it as entertainment!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded,”sure!” Then I’ll go with President Yu to gain some experience!”

The car quickly drove from the airport to the Junhao hotel in Hongzhou city, which was also the most high – Class hotel in Hongzhou.

Because they had to rush to Ruizhou in the afternoon to participate in the public Jade bid, this was really a “casual meal”. Yu mingdong had already ordered a few local signature dishes in advance. As soon as everyone arrived, the dishes were served immediately. The three of them did not drink any alcohol. They quickly finished lunch and continued to drive on the road.

The distance from Hongzhou province to Ruizhou province was over 90 km. After more than an hour, the three people had arrived at Ruizhou province.

It was probably not Shi Lei’s first time accompanying Yu mingdong here. He was also very familiar with the roads of Ruizhou. He skillfully drove the Mercedes – Benz business car through the streets and alleys of Ruizhou and soon came to the end of a Street.

There was a large parking lot near the end of the street. After the car drove in, Xia ruofei saw that there were many luxury cars parked in the parking lot.

Yu mingdong said,”Mr. Xia, that’s the Jade Street in Ruizhou. The public Jade bid is in the middle and back of the street. We have to walk in.”

After Shi Lei parked the car, the three of them got off and walked into the jadeite Street of Rui Zhou.

This was a pedestrian street. The shops on both sides of the street were all selling Jade, and most of them were selling raw stones. Many shops had signs with the words “stone gambling” hanging outside.

Although stone gambling had the word “gambling,” it was actually legal. The essence of stone gambling was actually a transaction of raw jade stones.

As the surface of the Jade was covered by a layer of weathered skin, the inside of the Jade could not be seen, and no instrument could detect it.

Therefore, people could only infer that there was Supreme – grade Jade inside by the external characteristics of the shell. Most raw jadeite stones were traded in this way, which was commonly known as “stone gambling.”

Yu mingdong saw that Xia ruofei was quite interested in the raw stones displayed at the entrance of these shops and laughed.””Mr. Xia, these shops are all small and full of tricks. It’s okay to play with them occasionally, but there’s a public Jade bid these days, so there’s no need to waste time in these small shops.” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””It seems that the scale of this public bid is not small?”

Yu mingdong said,”the scale of the annual public Jade bid is naturally not small, but Jade is also a non – renewable resource!” In recent years, Jade has been quite hot, and Myanmar a little over – Mining. Both the scale and quality of the raw stones have declined a lot compared to previous years ...”

Yu mingdong sighed and said,””This year’s competition will definitely be very intense. I wonder how high the price will be! This line of work is getting more and more difficult ...”

Xia ruofei had seen Yu mingdong’s business card and knew that he was the boss of a Jade company. He could not help but smile and ask,””President Yu, isn’t the high price a good thing for you?”

Yu mingdong smiled bitterly and said,”in theory, if the price of raw stones is high, the price of jade products will also rise. But for a small company like us, the financial pressure is a bit big!” And if I’m wrong, I might lose everything ...”

“It seems that no industry is easy!” Xia ruofei exclaimed.

“Who said it wasn ‘t!” Yu mingdong looked at the shop next to him and said,”those who do raw stone transactions are more stable. As long as they have a channel to get the goods from Myanmar, they will definitely make a profit!”

The two of them chatted as they walked forward. Shi Lei followed behind them quietly and never interrupted them.

Soon, they arrived at the scene of the public Jade bid in Ruizhou.
