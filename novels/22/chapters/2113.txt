Mr. Gore is cooking!” Cheng Xiaoxiao exclaimed in a low voice, looking forward to the new dish she was going to taste today even more.

“Mr. Xia, the foie gras is ready.” Gore said with a smile.

There were four plates on the dining cart, all covered with lids.

Obviously, Gore had not only prepared Cheng Xiaoxiao’s share, but also for himself and Bastian. They were also looking forward to the extraordinary and perfect goose liver.

Gore opened the lid of the plate to the side. Cheng Xiaoxiao glanced at it and said,””Wow! It’s a classic French foie gras!”

“Xiaoxiao, it seems like you know a lot about foie gras!” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

Cheng Xiaoxiao smiled a little embarrassedly and said,””Working in a Western restaurant, I have to answer questions from customers sometimes, so I take the initiative to learn some French and Western food knowledge in my spare time.”

“Not bad, not bad. You’re quite motivated!” Xia ruofei said,”then why don’t you introduce me to this French foie gras?”

“Alright!” Cheng Xiaoxiao said readily,”foie Gras is a famous traditional dish in France. In French, it’s called ‘foieegras’. This ‘gram’ means top in French, so this dish has a very high status among French dishes! Some people say that foie gras is the most romantic dish in French cuisine and is the most suitable dish for women!”

Xia ruofei looked at Cheng Xiaoxiao, who was speaking with fervor and assurance. He knew that she definitely didn’t know the cruel process of producing foie gras using traditional methods. Otherwise, she would never show such a yearning expression. She might even vomit when she saw foie gras in the future.

Of course, Xia ruofei did not expose her. He just smiled and listened quietly.

Cheng Xiaoxiao continued to introduce the cooking method and characteristics of French foie gras. On the other side, Gore had also placed his plate on the table.

There were four seats in the card Bag. Xia ruofei and Cheng Xiaoxiao sat on one side, while Gore and Bastian naturally sat opposite.

After hearing Cheng Xiaoxiao’s introduction, Xia ruofei glanced at the plate in front of him.

There were three pieces of foie gras on the plate from left to right. It was probably because there were not many samples, so the amount was not as large as a standard serving of foie gras.

Gore didn’t use too many ingredients for this dish. In addition to a broccoli, he sprinkled some black pepper and rose Salt on the foie gras.

The foie gras seemed to be fried just right, and the outside was a little bit burnt.

Xia ruofei sniffed and smiled.””What a fragrant smell! Even if you’re not hungry, this aroma will still stimulate your appetite!”

“Mr. Xia,” Bastian said with a smile,”foie gras contains glucose, so it gives off an alluring fragrance after heating.”

Xia ruofei nodded and looked at the plate again. He smiled and said,”Mr. Gore, if I’m not wrong, these three pieces of foie gras should be from three different samples?”he asked.

“Of course!” Gore laughed. Moreover, the foie gras of each sample was placed in a fixed position. I won’t tell you which sample they are. After you taste them, you can write down the order in your mind from the highest to the lowest. How about it?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”that’s a good idea!” In that case ... Let’s ... Start eating!”

Gore and Bastian couldn’t wait any longer. They nodded after hearing Xia ruofei’s words.

Therefore, everyone picked up their knives and forks and aimed at the foie gras in front of them.

Xia ruofei cut a small piece of foie gras and put it in his mouth with a fork.

He chewed it gently. The goose liver, which was brown on the outside and fragrant, had a warm, smooth texture on the inside, which was quite delicate, just like butter.

Xia ruofei felt that his mouth was filled with fragrance, as if every taste bud cell was jumping for joy. He couldn’t help but cut another piece and put it in his mouth.

Bastian, Cheng Xiaoxiao, and Gore’s performance was similar to Xia ruofei ‘s. After the first bite, they couldn’t wait to cut the second piece, not even having time to speak.

Of course, the four of them did not completely forget their mission to taste the foie gras while they were tasting the delicious food. They were still trying to feel the subtle differences between each type of foie gras and then pick out the most delicious type of foie gras in their hearts.

Xia ruofei finished the three pieces of foie gras first, then smiled and said,””When I watched food shows in the past, I often heard the host say things like ‘fat but not greasy, it melts in the mouth’. I always felt that it had almost become the standard of food reviews! But today, I’ve truly experienced what it means to melt in the mouth!”

Cheng Xiaoxiao had also finished the third piece of foie gras. She chewed without caring about her image and said,””President Xia, the higher the fat content of the foie gras, the more obvious this feeling will be. Because fat is actually what we call oil! When it’s heated, it will start to melt, which is why it has the ‘melt in the mouth’ effect you mentioned! Therefore, I conclude that the three portions of foie gras today have a very high fat content!”

Xia ruofei looked at Cheng Xiaoxiao in surprise and said,””I can’t tell! Xiaoxiao, you’re pretty professional!”

It was actually quite impressive that she could come to such a conclusion without Bastian telling her anything in advance. At least it showed that she had put her heart into this job.

At this time, Bastian and Gore had also finished all the foie gras in front of them. They wanted to share three samples with the four people, but the amount was indeed a little small.
