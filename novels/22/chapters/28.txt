Chapter 29: The Chief’s Rage

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Okay, I’ll do it right away!” Wu Liqian replied.

Tian Huilan’s expression was very serious as she spoke. It was obvious that something big had happened. Furthermore, she had specially informed Commissar Wu of the garrison, which meant that this matter was very likely to involve the military. Wu Liqian naturally did not dare to delay and quickly returned to her office to make a call.

Ten minutes later, four cars drove out of the city government building and sped in the direction of Linhai Town in Changping County.

Two of the four cars had military plates, one had police plate, and the other was Tian Huilan’s Audi.

Among the two military vehicles, other than Commissar Wu’s from the garrison area, there was also a cadre who was in charge of dealing with special retired personnel.

…

While Tian Huilan was rushing towards Linhai Town with the relevant personnel, another large group of police officers arrived at the small Linhai Town police station.

These police officers were all armed with guns. They were police officers from the City Public Security Bureau’s Criminal Police Brigade.

The leader of the team was Deputy Director Zheng of the Municipal Public Security Bureau.

“Little Li, what’s wrong with you?! How did such a big mess happen?” Deputy Chief Zheng frowned and questioned as soon as he got out of the car.

Su Ruiwu and Li Zhengyi were already waiting in the courtyard. At this moment, Su Ruiwu looked down and clearly did not intend to make a move. Li Zhengyi had no choice but to bite the bullet and explain.

“Chief Zheng, I would like to reflect on this matter. We don’t know enough about the danger of this suspect, and we were careless during the escort…”

Deputy Chief Zheng waved his hand and interrupted Li Zhengyi.

“This is no time for pursuing responsibilities. The point is to solve the problem! Have you talked to the suspect?”

“We’ve made some efforts, but he won’t respond no matter what we say. He’s obviously prepared to put up a stiff resistance!” said Li Zhengyi.

Deputy Chief Zheng snorted and said.

“He’s simply lawless! He’s too arrogant! Let’s go! I’ll go meet him first! Little Ji, get your snipers in position!”

“Yes!” replied Captain Ji Hua.

The backup police officers had already surrounded the interrogation room. Under Deputy Chief Zheng’s orders, the two snipers quickly occupied the sniping position. Unfortunately, the interrogation room’s terrain was special. There was no way to find the suspect through the small visitation hole.

Deputy Chief Zheng came to the door of the interrogation room and said loudly.

“People inside, listen up! I’m the Deputy Director of the Changping County Public Security Bureau, Zheng Xiaodong! You’re already surrounded by the police! I advise you not to have any wishful thinking. Release the hostages immediately and we will give lenient charges!”

When Xia Ruofei heard Deputy Chief Zheng’s shout in the interrogation room, he pursed his lips in disdain and could not be bothered with him.

On the other hand, when Hu Zi’s mother heard that the leaders of the county’s Public Security Bureau were here, she knew that this matter had blown up. The worry on her face deepened. She looked at Xia Ruofei anxiously and said.

“Ruofei…”

“Auntie, don’t worry! Nothing will happen. I’ve already made arrangements,” Xia Ruofei said with a smile.

Deputy Chief Zheng was still shouting outside, but Xia Ruofei turned a deaf ear to him. Instead, he looked at Lin Qiao and said.

“By the way, Qiao’er, there’s something I’ve been meaning to ask you. It’s not the weekend. Why are you at home?”

“Huh?” Lin Qiao was stunned. She did not expect Xia Ruofei to be in the mood to care about such a small matter at a time like this.

It was Hu Zi’s mother who said with a sigh.

“Sigh… Isn’t this all because of me? Qiao’er hasn’t been to school for two weeks in order to take care of me… This wretched girl doesn’t listen to me at all. No matter how I persuade her, she’s unwilling to return to school. She said that she wants to drop out of school and go home to take care of me…”

Lin Qiao’s eyes turned red.

“Mom… you’re so sick. How can I leave you alone…”

Xia Ruofei had already guessed the answer, but after personally confirming it, he could not help but frown and say.

“Qiao’er, you should be in your third year of high school this year! The college entrance examination is next semester, so your studies can’t be delayed… There shouldn’t be any major problems with Auntie’s health now. She’ll recover soon. After this matter is resolved, go back to school and attend classes. Do you hear me?”

“I understand, Brother Ruofei…” Lin Qiao lowered her head and said, “But now…”

“I told you, nothing will happen!” Xia Ruofei smiled faintly. “You don’t trust Brother Ruofei?”

“I believe you!” Lin Qiao looked up at Xia Ruofei and said seriously.

Xia Ruofei smiled and nodded.

Deputy Chief Zheng, who was outside the door, spoke righteously, but did not receive any response. He could not help but fly into a rage out of humiliation and shout sternly.

“People inside, listen up! If you continue to resist, we’ll organize a strong attack immediately! I heard that you have an old woman and a girl with you. If the situation gets out of control and they get hurt…”

Xia Ruofei frowned and raised his voice.

“They’re innocent. They had nothing to do with this. They were illegally arrested by the police who abused their powers!”

“Hmph! Since it has nothing to do with them, let them out first!” Deputy Chief Zheng snorted.

“Bullsh*t!” Xia Ruofei said without thinking. “If they go out, you guys would arrest them, and I would be under threat. Do you think I’m stupid! Have you lived your life in vain?”

Just now, Deputy Chief Zheng had actually used Hu Zi’s mother and Lin Qiao’s safety to threaten Xia Ruofei. This made Xia Ruofei quite unhappy, so he naturally did not show any mercy.

“You…” Deputy Chief Zheng was so angry that he almost exploded.

“This kid is indeed stubborn!” Deputy Chief Zheng said to Ji Hua, the captain of the Criminal Police Force, who was beside him. “Inform Team One to prepare to attack! Ask the snipers to closely monitor the situation. If there’s an opportunity, they can directly kill the three suspects without asking for instructions!”

This included Lin Qiao and Hu Zi’s mother. When Xia Ruofei heard this in the interrogation room, a cold glint flashed across his eyes.

“Well…” Ji Hua hesitated. After all, there was an auxiliary police hostage inside. But when he saw Deputy Director Zheng’s stern gaze, he immediately said, “Yes!”

After another three to four minutes, Xia Ruofei heard Deputy Chief Zheng say fiercely. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Break the door down!”

Not good! Xia Ruofei knew that Deputy Chief Zheng was really prepared to take the risk and attack forcefully. Once they rushed in, he was confident that he could escape unscathed, but he would definitely not be able to protect Lin Qiao and Hu Zi’s mother.

Without hesitation, he struck the auxiliary police’s carotid artery with the flat of his hand. The man crumpled to the ground without even a grunt.

Xia Ruofei quickly rushed out.

At this moment, the police outside had already started banging on the door. Xia Ruofei hurriedly used his shoulder to block the metal door.

The police had brought specialized assault equipment, and the impact on the iron door was getting stronger. It almost broke open several times, but fortunately, Xia Ruofei gritted his teeth and held on.

Wolf King, are you reliable? I can’t hold on anymore… Xia Ruofei gritted his teeth and held on as he complained in his heart.

After they bang eight or nine times, Xia Ruofei felt like his bones were about to fall apart. He knew that with such strength, the iron door would be completely broken open in three more hits at most.

The situation was not good! Xia Ruofei could not help but frown.

At this moment, a female voice shouted authoritatively from outside.

“Stop right now! What are you doing?”
