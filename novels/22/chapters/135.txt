In the next few days, Xia ruofei did not go out. He stayed at home with Hu Zi’s mother and Lin Qiao. Lin Qiao even pestered Xia ruofei to go to the nearby beach. Seeing Lin Qiao cheering for the sea, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be speechless. Why was a girl who grew up by the sea so excited to see the sea? There was an elder at home, so everything was in good order. It was almost the new year, so Hu Zi’s mother asked ye Lingyun to drive her to the county. They bought a lot of fireworks, red lanterns, China knots, and so on. They decorated the small villa and even the entire Tao Yuan farm with a New Year’s atmosphere. Now, the trees on both sides of the farm path were hung with small lanterns and China knots. Hu Zi’s mother had even asked pang Hao to get someone to pull up a few light ribbons. At night, the light ribbons and lanterns on the farm path were lit up, and the atmosphere was very warm. Hu ‘Zi’s mother even personally cleaned up the villa, making sure that the windows were clean and bright. Xia ruofei could not persuade her. She had always said that she was in good health and that she would have no problem doing these small things. In the end, Xia ruofei could only let her be. Fortunately, Xia ruofei knew that Hu Zi’s mother was in good health. It was not a problem for her to move around. Three days passed by quickly. It was Chinese New Year’s Eve tomorrow. Xia ruofei gave the workers an early holiday. Before the holiday, Xia ruofei gave each worker a red packet of 1000 Yuan and transferred their salaries to their cards in advance. As the supervisor, Cao tieshu received a red packet of 3000 Yuan. These workers had only been on the job for a month or so, and everyone was already receiving red packets. They were all overjoyed. The vegetable seeds had also been sowed, so someone had to be on duty during the new year. Of course, the overtime pay would be tripled, and pang Hao would take care of the attendance records. The newly appointed Cao tieshu took the initiative to ask him to be on duty on New Year’s Eve and the first day of the new year. Xia ruofei trusted him more and agreed after some thought. However, Xia ruofei told him to come over when he was free. There was no need for him to stay in the farm all day for the new year. Everyone wanted to reunite. Pang Hao also packed his things and returned to spend the new year with his family. The farm, which had been very lively during this period of time, had become much quieter. Only Xia ruofei, ye Lingyun, Hu Zi’s mother, and Lin Qiao were left. Ye Lingyun’s parents were no longer around. Just like Xia ruofei, they were all alone, so everyone just happened to spend the new year together. That night, Xia ruofei immediately locked the door and windows, took out the spirit map, and entered the room. When Xia ruofei entered the medium yesterday, he saw young fish going in and out of the male fish’s mouth from time to time. He knew that the red Arowana’s hatching process was almost complete. Now that the flow of time inside and outside was thirty times different, three days was almost equivalent to three months in the space. As expected, when Xia ruofei entered the medium, he saw that other than the two big red Arowana, there were many young ones swimming happily in the pond. There were at least twenty of them. This was a little more than he had expected, but it was normal. If the number of young fish produced in the spirit map space was not as much as the outside world, that would be ridiculous! Each juvenile Red Arowana was more than 10 centimeters long. Their bodies were perfect, and their scales were tight and fine, giving off a faint metallic luster. Even though Xia ruofei did not know much about Red Arowana, he knew that these young red Arowana were of excellent quality. Then, he came to the large sorting box where most of the fish eggs were placed. This side was even more spectacular. More than 50 juvenile fish swam happily in the petal solution. Perhaps because of the petal solution, these juvenile fish that were hatched directly in the sorting box were much larger than those in the small pond and looked more energetic. Xia ruofei looked at the young fish with joy. Under normal circumstances, 80 to 90 fish eggs could hatch more than 10 or at most 20 young fish. Xia ruofei had caught more than 70 fish this time. It was a great harvest! Red Arowana were the most expensive ornamental fish out of all the ornamental fish in the world. A high – Quality blood – Red Arowana had once been sold for five to six million Yuan. Once these young fish grew up, he would definitely make a fortune. However, the small pond must be too cramped now. With so many fish in it, it would be very crowded. Xia ruofei thought for a while, picked up the Hoe and Shovel, and started digging again beside the pond. This time, he dug a 10 by 10 meter hole, which took him more than ten hours. Even though he had an amazing physical strength from constantly absorbing the petal solution, he had to rest two or three times in between. Next, Xia ruofei dug the channel and moved some mud, algae, plankton, small fish and shrimp from the grass carp pond into the new fish pond. Then, he dug the channel and led the water from the spatial spirit pond into the new pond. Xia ruofei returned to the outside world to stay for a while. When she returned to the medium, the new fish pond was already filled with water. Hence, Xia ruofei carefully placed the young red Dragon in the sorting box into the new pond. As for the young fish in the pond, Xia ruofei did not care about them for the time being. He let them live with their parents. Anyway, there was still enough space now. After a while, when the young fish grew bigger, he could move them over. Only a short while had passed in the outside world, but Xia ruofei was exhausted. He took a shower in the bathroom after leaving the medium and fell asleep. The next morning, Xia ruofei was still in a daze. In his daze, he felt someone pulling his ear. He opened his eyes drowsily and saw Lin Qiao standing at the head of his bed, looking at him with disdain. “Brother ruofei, it’s already so late and you’re still sleeping!” Lin Qiao said,”get up and put up the couplets!” Xia ruofei quickly wrapped the blanket around him tightly. He was used to wearing only his underwear when he slept. He did not expect this girl to barge into his room. Xia ruofei laughed bitterly in his heart. Peaceful days were really exhausting! When he was in the Army, he never slept like this. He was always on guard. Of course, this was also because he had been working for more than ten hours in the origin space yesterday. Besides, he was in his own home so Xia ruofei was not on guard. Basically, he would only lock the door and windows when he used the spirit map scroll. “You little girl! Why didn’t you knock before coming in?” Xia ruofei said to Lin Qiao helplessly. “I’ve been calling you for a long time. ” Lin Qiao said innocently,”you didn’t answer me. I didn’t lock the door, so I drove in ...” Xia ruofei rubbed his forehead and smiled bitterly.”Alright, alright, you can leave first! I’m going to put on my clothes ...” Lin Qiaoling’s eyes turned and she deliberately said,”Why do you want me to go out when you’re wearing your clothes?” “Nonsense! “Men and women shouldn’t be so close ...” Xia ruofei said angrily.”You brat, are you leaving or not?” Lin Qiao pursed her lips and smiled,”I’m not leaving!” I won’t leave!” “You’re not going out? Then don’t blame me for using my killing weapon!” Xia ruofei said in a deliberately fierce tone. With that, Xia ruofei pretended to pull the blanket away. Lin Qiao screamed and covered her eyes. She ran out of Xia ruofei’s room with a red face. [PS] hohoho ... Why are there so few cute monthly ticket fungi?
