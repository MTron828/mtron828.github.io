Song Rui almost fainted when he heard that. His face turned pale and he asked in a trembling voice,””Ruofei ... I’m really infected ... That ... How serious is it?”

Xia ruofei said seriously,”your condition is called a suspected illness in medicine. It’s a type of physical disorder. It mainly refers to the patient’s worry or belief that he has one or more serious physical diseases, accompanied by anxiety or depression.” Looking at your condition, it can be classified as aids, which is ...”

“Wait! Wait a minute!” “Are you saying that I don’t have AIDS?” song Rui shouted.

Xia ruofei was laughing in his heart, but he still looked serious. He shrugged and said,””When did I say that you’re infected with AIDS?”

“F * ck! Then why do you make it sound so serious and have such a pained expression!” Song Rui said unhappily,”brother, people can scare people to death, okay?”

Xia ruofei thought,”I just wanted to scare you!” Let’s see if you still dare to go out and have fun ...

Xia ruofei said seriously,”song Rui, don’t underestimate this suspicious illness. It’s a mental illness!” Some studies have shown that people with a serious fear of cancer have a higher chance of getting cancer than the average person!”

“Don’t try to educate me!” Song Rui said,”brother, this situation is different. If it wasn’t for this, I wouldn’t be so suspicious all day long!”

Xia ruofei looked at song Rui and said,””All diseases have triggers. The ‘thing’ you mentioned is the trigger!”

“Alright, alright!” Song Rui raised his hands to beg for mercy. Then, he said timidly,”ruofei, it’s not that I don’t believe you, but ... I really have symptoms. It’s not my imagination! I’ve been running a fever recently! My throat also hurts!”

Xia ruofei said indifferently,”you have a wind – Heat cold!” Go get some huoxiang dripping pills or yinqiao detoxification pills and eat them for a few days!”

“It’s ... It’s that simple?” Song Rui was dumbfounded.

“Don’t tell me you think you’re very serious?” Xia ruofei asked in amusement.

“No, no. I just can’t believe it ...” Song Rui smiled awkwardly.”But ... My appetite has been bad recently!”

“You’ve been imagining things all day long to the extent of being possessed. It would be strange if you still have the appetite to eat!”

“Then I’ve lost a lot of weight too! This was still objective data! I’m weighing myself every day!” Song Rui said.

Xia ruofei glanced at song Rui and said,””Nonsense! If I’m like you, not eating or drinking all day, and being suspicious like a bird startled by the mere twang of a bow, I’ll lose weight as well!”

“You mean to say ... I’m just scaring myself?” Song Rui muttered.

“It’s up to you to believe it or not!”Xia ruofei shrugged.

“I believe you!” Song Rui quickly put on a fawning smile and said,”you, miracle doctor Xia, have already diagnosed it. How can I not believe it?”

People were like this sometimes. When they suspected that they had some kind of illness, they would naturally be suspicious, especially now that the internet was so developed. Many people habitually went online to search for it, and in the end, they would find that all the symptoms listed on the internet seemed to match them.

They didn’t know that if they could rely on the internet for things like treating illnesses, what was the point of having doctors?

If diseases could be diagnosed by searching for clues, would there still be a need for the medical University to set up a five – year clinical course? If everyone was given a computer with internet access, they could go to the hospital. Why waste five years?

With Xia ruofei’s personal diagnosis, song Rui’s worries were gone. He looked sickly just now, but now he was full of energy.

He chuckled.”That ... Ruofei, the huoxiang dripping pill that you mentioned just now is too slow to take effect. Since you’ve diagnosed me, you should be responsible to the end!” Give me some medicine that takes effect quickly, I’m having a fever every day and it’s uncomfortable!”

Xia ruofei shook his head helplessly and said,””You brat ... You’re insatiable!”

“Hehe, we’re brothers for life, you won’t be so cruel, right?” Song Rui said shyly.

“Fine! I knew that there would be no good feast!” Xia ruofei said as he opened his bag and took out a small porcelain bottle.

There were more than ten pills left from the pill he made for Song Wei. Xia ruofei had just informed Xia Qing in the space with his spiritual sense to put three pills in this small porcelain bottle.

Due to the difference in the flow of time 30 times that of the outside world, although it had only been a few seconds, Xia Qing had already prepared the pill in the space.

Xia ruofei reaching into his bag was just a cover for song Rui to think that he was taking something out of his bag. In fact, he took it out from the medium with a thought.

“Take it after meals, one pill each time!” Xia ruofei replied,”I should be fine in a day.”

The pill contained the petals of the spirit Heart Flower. Even the strange poison in Song Wei’s body could be removed after taking it for ten to twenty days. Song Rui only had a common cold. Three pills would definitely cure him.

In fact, it was a waste to use such a pill to treat a cold. However, Xia ruofei knew that if he did not know about song Rui’s cold, he would be suspicious.
