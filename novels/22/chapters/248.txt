Chapter 249: Secretary Tian’s outburst (1)

“What are you guys doing here?” A stern voice came from the door. Tian Huilan strode into the office with a dark expression. Behind her was a group of bureau chiefs who didn’t know what was going on and were feeling uneasy. Of course, the Deputy Secretary of the municipal Party Committee, Lin Wanshui, was even more terrified. In fact, when Xiao Mei directed the driver to drive to the office building where the Ling Ji F & B headquarters was located, Lin Wanshui couldn’t help but break out in a cold sweat. Tian Huilan didn’t say a word to him the entire time. After getting out of the car, she still didn’t say a word. She took the elevator straight to the floor where the Ling Ji F & B headquarters was located. The directors in the elevator didn’t even dare to breathe loudly. After arriving at the headquarters of the Ling Ji F & B, Tian Huilan asked for the location of the staff Finance Office with a pleasant expression on her face. Then, she took the lead and directly walked over. It wasn’t until Tian Huilan berated him that Lin Wanshui finally squeezed into the office, sweating profusely. When he saw that his son, Lin Feng, was also at the scene, and that there were more than a dozen punks lying in the office, wailing and screaming, Lin Wanshui was even more dispirited. When Lin Feng saw this Tian Huilan, he couldn’t help but be stunned for a moment. After that, he saw Lin Wanshui and subconsciously called out,””Dad! What are you doing here?” At this moment, Lin Wanshui really wanted to stuff Lin Feng back into his mother’s stomach. He had never felt like this before, wishing that he never had a son like Lin Feng. This was simply a scam! He still dared to call him “dad” at this time. Wasn’t he just walking right into Secretary Tian’s gun? Tian Huilan naturally heard Lin Feng’s words, but she only frowned slightly and turned her head to look at Lin Wanshui with a meaningful look. Then, Tian Huilan quickly walked in front of Xia ruofei and asked with a trace of concern,””Xia, are you okay?” “Thank you for your concern, Secretary Tian. A few gangsters can’t hurt me.” Xia ruofei said with a smile. The words “Secretary Tian” were like a sudden clap of thunder, waking everyone up from their momentary daze. Wasn’t this the number one person in the municipal Party Committee, Secretary Tian? She was actually so concerned about that little Xia! The office was deathly silent. Even Scarface and the others were so scared that they shut their mouths tightly. There was only the sound of heavy breathing in the entire office. Little Shen and the others were stunned on the spot like clay sculptures. Lin Feng and Lin Wanshui glanced at each other, their faces ashen. Shocking! Fear! Despair! All kinds of complicated emotions rushed into his heart, and Lin Wanshui’s legs started to tremble uncontrollably. He realized that his political career might be completely over from today. Not only that, but he might also follow in Deputy Mayor Duan’s footsteps and begin a long prison life to reflect on what he had done over the years. He knew very well that if the organization took it seriously, he would definitely not be able to withstand an investigation. Ling Xiaotian also came back to his senses. He first looked at Xia ruofei with a complicated expression, then called out with a trace of respect,””Good day, Secretary Tian!” Tian Huilan smiled kindly.”You must be Chairman Ling? Hello, Xiao Xia has told me everything about today. I’m late and I’m sorry to have made you suffer ...” “I wouldn’t dare, I wouldn’t dare. Thank you, Secretary Tian!” Ling Xiaotian hurriedly said. Ling Qingxue looked at Xia ruofei in a daze. She could not believe what she was seeing. She had always thought that Xia ruofei was joking when he said that he would look for a Ministry official to help him. She did not expect that a Ministry official would really come. Tian Huilan was a member of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee and also the Secretary of the Sanshan municipal government, so wasn’t she a Deputy – Level cadre? Moreover, he was one of the high – ranking vice – ministers. If that was the case ... Then the national level cadre that RUO Fei mentioned ... Ling Qingxue didn’t dare to think further. At this time, Tian Huilan had already turned around and coldly looked at the silent crowd. She said indifferently,””Can you tell me what happened?” The few bureau chiefs who had followed Tian Huilan quickly ordered their subordinates. “Section Chief Yao, didn’t you hear Secretary Tian’s instructions? What’s going on?” “Little Liu, why are you all mute? Say something!” “Old Chen, you’re an old comrade. Tell me what’s going on.” The officers who had been arrogant just a moment ago were now crying. No one dared to say anything. Secretary Tian had already determined the matter the moment he came in. How could they still dare to argue? Not to mention, they were very clear about what was going on today. They couldn’t afford to be investigated. “Don’t you have anything to say?”Tian Huilan asked indifferently. Then, she turned around and coldly looked at Lin Wanshui. She pointed at Lin Feng and said,””Comrade Lin Wanshui, this is your child, right? What is he doing here?” At this moment, Lin Wanshui was already completely disheartened. Hearing Tian Huilan call out his name, he was so scared that he trembled and said in fear,””Secretary ... Secretary Tian ... I don’t ... Don’t understand the situation ...” Tian Huilan looked at Lin Wanshui with some disgust and then said,””Since you’re not going to tell me, I’ll tell you!” After she finished speaking, she looked around at the many executives in the office. No one dared to look her in the eye and they all lowered their heads guiltily. “Comrades!” Tian Huilan said. “Right now, from the central government to the local government, everyone is carrying out mass line education activities. We emphasize building our work style every day, emphasizing that the cadres should take the lead and set an example. But how do some of our cadres, even a few leading cadres, do it? The people didn’t give you power to do whatever you want and to fish for the lives of the people!” The entire office was dead silent, and the directors were all sweating. Lin Wanshui and the officers that Lin Feng had found were even more dejected. Tian Huilan pointed at Ling Xiaotian and the others and continued,””Ling Ji F & B can be said to be the star F & B enterprise in San Shan city, but some leaders, for their own benefit, actually ordered their children to contact their so – called brothers and friends to carry out a raid on Ling Ji F & B within half a day. They picked on everyone, and in the end, they even stormed into the company’s headquarters to seal the accounts! A good company was turned into a mess! He’s simply insane and lawless!” Speaking of this, Tian Huilan angrily slammed the table, and Lin Wanshui and the others couldn’t help but shiver. Then, Tian Huilan pointed at Dao BA and the others and coldly asked,””Also, what’s with these people? Can any of you explain it to me?” There was a dead silence. Everyone kept quiet out of fear. No one dared to speak at this moment. At this moment, a series of noisy footsteps came from the door again ...Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m
