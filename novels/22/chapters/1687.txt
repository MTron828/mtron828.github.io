Chapter 1688: Character collapse (1)

It turned out that the latest post on the official Weibo of Tao Yuan company was a photo taken by Xia ruofei at the airport. The caption was: “After several twists and turns, our President Xia has finally arrived in suttani. Follow and forward this Weibo post, and at the same two friends, and you’ll have the chance to get a sample of jadeshi cream! The winning fans would be randomly drawn by the Weibo lucky draw platform. There were a total of 10 prizes, so there were many chances! Put an end to the dirty dealings! “Also, those who wish for President Xia to open a personal Weibo account, please like it!”

In the photo, Xia ruofei had a bright smile on his face. The background was the busy Kingsford Smith Airport. The photo had been edited, and there was a caption: I’m finally here. I feel so cute!

Xia ruofei looked at the time of the post. It had only been ten minutes, but there were already thousands of shares. What made him not know whether to laugh or cry was that the number of likes had already exceeded ten thousand!

And cute ... Xia ruofei felt so tired. How did I end up with this group of scammers ... No! Where’s the employee who tricked his boss?

Needless to say, Feng Jing was the one who sent the photo back to the company. In fact, it was possible that Feng Jing was the one who had sent the photo to the company. No one else had the guts to do that.

Feng Jing had long noticed that Xia ruofei was looking at her phone, but she pretended to be admiring the scenery. It was only when Xia ruofei spoke that she could not help but burst into laughter.

Feng Jing looked at Xia ruofei’s phone screen and said,””I think it’s pretty good! The composition, lighting, and expressions were all on point! By the way, I’ve also helped you to beautify your face!”

“These ... These words were also written by you, right?” Xia ruofei said gloomily,”I was wondering why you were fiddling with your phone just now.”

“I’m just trying to keep you hot!”Feng Rao giggled. You’re so cute now!”

“Cute my a * s ...” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but say,”whoever likes cute is cute!” I’m clearly a bossy President, okay?”

“I think I’m the president of the company!” Feng Rao said casually. Could it be that boss Xia is planning to fire me?”

“I ... I’m the overbearing Chairman!” Xia ruofei straightened his neck and said,”I don’t want any cute character!”

“That’s not up to you to decide!” Feng Rao giggled and said,”who asked you to film such a cute video? The netizens were still falling for this! Can’t you see how fast our company’s Weibo fans are increasing?”

Xia ruofei felt that he couldn’t argue with Feng Jing anymore, so he put away his phone and closed his eyes to rest.

As for the various voices on the internet, they simply ignored them.

Feng Jing didn’t want to let Xia ruofei off so easily. She reached out and touched Xia ruofei’s arm.”AI! Ruofei, to be honest, I think you should open a personal Weibo account! The timing is pretty good!”

Xia ruofei opened his eyes and said,””I say, can you not ...”

“Let me finish first!” Feng Jing pouted and looked at Xia ruofei from the corner of her eyes.”Actually, Dong Yun and the rest did a good job this time. It’s the era of popularity and popularity. There’s a fan economy everywhere. At least for now, you’re the guarantee of popularity! In the past, it was your own business whether you opened Weibo or not, but it’s different now. This has obviously risen to the height of the company’s development!”

Seeing that Xia ruofei was about to speak, Feng Rao said,””Don’t interrupt ... Ruofei, you don’t have to manage your own Weibo account. The company will naturally arrange for someone to take care of it. Also, the character design problem you mentioned can be slowly reversed in the future! If you don’t open Weibo, how are you going to change your image?”

Feng Rao felt her mouth was a little dry, so she opened a bottle of mineral water and took a few sips. She then continued,””Look at the bosses of some internet companies, which one of them isn’t very popular on the internet? Chairman MA of the heavenly cat was also known as ‘father MA’ and had countless fans. President Liu of kyokuboku also showed off his love for his wife from time to time. Whenever there was an opportunity, he would promote their company’s employee welfare, corporate social responsibility, and other things. There was also President Chen, who’ spoke for himself ‘, who was an internet celebrity. Including the previous generation of internet people, which one of them didn’t have countless fans? In this aspect, you have to keep up with the times!”

“According to what you’re saying, if I don’t open this Weibo account, I’ll be unforgivable?” Xia ruofei said helplessly.

“Not really, but it’s a pity to miss this opportunity!” Feng Rao grinned. RUO Fei, you should consider it carefully!”

Xia ruofei wasn’t a stubborn person. He listened to Feng Jing’s reasoning, but he couldn’t let it go. However, he quickly adjusted his attitude. What was the point of putting on airs in front of his own people?

Xia ruofei only thought for a moment before saying,””If that’s the case, then open it! Get the public relations department to contact Weibo and set up a real – Name verified account!”

“That’s right!”Feng Rao said happily. I’ll send a WeChat message to Dong Yun and ask her to follow up personally!”

After speaking, Feng Jing really did pull out her phone and sent Dong Yun a WeChat message.

When they arrived at the entrance of Paradise Farm, it was already evening. Xia ruofei called Liang Qichao when they were about to reach the farm, so he waited at the entrance of the farm in advance. Liang Qichao walked up to them as soon as they got out of the car.

“President Xia, President Feng, welcome!” Liang Qichao said with a warm smile on his face.

Although he wasn’t an employee of paradise Corporation, strictly speaking, Liang Qichao was an employee of Tang He’s grandfather. He only helped to take care of the farm since Tang He also owned half of the farm shares. However, it was all thanks to Xia ruofei that Liang Qichao could have his current career and keep gaining points in Grandpa Tang He’s heart, so he was very enthusiastic.

“Brother Liang! You’ve worked hard!” Xia ruofei hugged Liang Qichao and smiled.”I don’t think I need to introduce you, President Feng!”

“No need, no need! Director Feng’s name is already as famous as Thunder!” Liang Qichao said with a laugh.

“Manager Liang,” Feng Jing said with a smile,”I’ve long heard that Paradise Farm is doing well under your management. I’ve always wanted to come and take a look. Now I finally have the chance!” I have to read more Scriptures! I want to learn from the advanced management experience here!”

“Where? Feng Jing has led paradise Corporation to record new records. I often see news about the company in Australia! I’m the one who’s learning from you!” Liang Qichao said.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”Okay, okay, let’s stop flattering each other, okay?” Can I go in first? I’m so hungry! I only had a little on the plane today ...”

“Let’s go! The feast has been prepared!” “Please get in the car, bosses!” Liang Qichao said.

Paradise Farm had a relatively large area, and the living area was deep inside the farm, so Liang Qichao drove a Mercedes – Benz to the entrance to pick them up. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

The Mercedes – Benz quietly drove on the clean asphalt road inside the farm. The two sides of the road were full of rich green. In the distance, there were rows of neat vegetable greenhouses, reflecting the light of the setting sun.

“The environment here is so beautiful!” Feng Jing couldn’t help but exclaim,”and it’s much bigger than the farms in our country ...”

Although Feng Jing also knew about Paradise Farm’s situation, it was only a number on paper. After she was in the real world, she intuitively felt the vastness of the farm.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”the living area in front is the best!” I guarantee that you won’t want to return to China after you’ve settled down ...”

Feng Rao rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei and said,””No matter how good the environment is, we can’t not go back! There are so many things to do at the company ...”

“No energy!” Xia ruofei pouted.

“Ah!” Feng Rao couldn’t help but scream again.

As it turned out, after the car drove past a small hill, they could already see the residential area in the distance. Feng Jing was indeed stunned by the beautiful scenery.

The artificial lake was sparkling under the setting sun, as if the water had been painted with a layer of gold. A few swans were swimming leisurely on the lake. By the lakeside, several houses were scattered around, and all kinds of flowers were planted around the houses, embellishing it like a paradise on earth.

“So beautiful ...” Feng Rao muttered.

“Sister ran, would you consider taking a vacation here?” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”by the way ... You haven’t had a day off in two years!”

Feng Rao was indeed tempted. She said,””We’ll talk about it later ... There’s still a lot of work to be done in the company!”

“How can things be finished?” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”now that the work has been settled, new things will appear. You’re too demanding on yourself. Just like this time when we went abroad, didn’t the company operate well?”

Liang Qichao, who was driving the car, also said,””Boss Feng, if you want to have an exclusive interview here, I’ll welcome you with open arms! Everything was good here except for the lack of popularity! If a beauty like you can live here, you’ll definitely add to the farm’s beauty!”

Xia ruofei teased,”doesn’t Paradise Farm already have a beauty like Daphne?” Do you still need my sister ran to keep up the act?”

Liang Qichao felt depressed and said,””Brother! I’ll call you brother, alright? Don’t you mention it!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.

He had long noticed that Liang Qichao and the deputy manager of Paradise Farm, Daphne, were making eyes at each other. Xia ruofei would never believe that there was nothing going on between the two.

The last time Liang Qichao and Xia ruofei talked about this over the phone, his father, Liang Weimin, happened to be having dinner with Xia ruofei. Before Xia ruofei could give him a hint, Liang Qichao, the big mouth, said a lot of things. In the end, the old – fashioned Liang Weimin flew into a rage and questioned him for a long time after the incident. He even warned him repeatedly.

If it weren’t for the fact that Australia was so far away, Liang Qichao and Daphne would have been separated.

So when this matter was brought up, Liang Qichao was naturally extremely depressed.

Everyone laughed and talked, and the car soon arrived at the small lakeside villa.

The moment Xia ruofei got out of the car, he heard a happy voice.”Xia! You’ve finally come! I’ve been looking forward to this for a few days!”
