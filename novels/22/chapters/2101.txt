2102 The delivery of the luxury yacht_2

Xia ruofei asked again,”then ... Will it be difficult to get a yacht driver’s license?” Is the examination process complicated?”

“Actually, it might be easier to get a yacht driver’s license than a car driver’s license. It’s just that the training fee is higher. It’s about 20000 to 30000 Yuan now!”

Liu Yi quickly realized that 20000 to 30000 Yuan of training fees was indeed expensive for an ordinary family. However, for a rich man like Xia ruofei, 20000 to 30000 Yuan was no different from two to three Yuan.

Therefore, he quickly changed the topic and continued,””The training period will take at least ten days. After that, you’ll pass a series of tests and you’ll be able to get a yacht driver’s license.”

Xia ruofei’s eyes brightened. He nodded and said,””I understand. Thank you, old Liu!”

Liu Yi secretly sighed and said,”Mr. Xia, you’re welcome.”

Liu Yi could tell that the young rich man in front of him seemed to be interested in a yacht driver’s license and wanted to take the test himself. He couldn’t help but sigh in his heart,”if all the rich people are like Mr. Xia, then I’m going to lose my job.” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

In fact, the idea of getting a yacht driver’s license came to Xia ruofei’s mind when he saw Liu Yi driving a yacht.

He had planned to use this yacht in the outside world. When the time came, he would definitely bring Ling Qingxue, other elders, and friends out to sea. If he had to rely on the Yacht Club’s pilot to drive the yacht, he would feel that it was a good idea.

Especially if he took Ling Qingxue out to sea, it would definitely be a time for the two of them alone. They would enjoy the boundless ocean and the feeling of freedom. If there were outsiders on the yacht at this time, their time together would definitely be greatly reduced.

Moreover, he wanted to drive the yacht around the open sea when he was free and let the white leopard sense if there were any hidden world stones in the nearby sea.

In such a situation, it was naturally even more inconvenient to bring the pilot along.

Therefore, the best solution was to get a yacht driver’s license, which would solve the problem once and for all.

Of course, Xia ruofei did not voice out his thoughts.

In fact, he knew how to drive a yacht. It was just that he had learned how to operate a yacht in the Army. Naturally, he was not as good as a professional yacht pilot like Liu Yi. However, his skills were definitely enough. Moreover, he had cultivation, and his mental power could completely make up for the lack of skills.

The only problem was that he didn’t have a yacht license.

Under such circumstances, Xia ruofei naturally did not want to go through the maritime department’s training and then take the exam.

Therefore, after he thought about it, he would find a way to find someone. Even if he couldn’t get a yacht license directly, it would be good to let him take the test directly. After all, he couldn’t do nothing for more than ten days and just attend training.

Xia ruofei did not plan to disclose this matter before he was done with it. After he got the information he wanted, he did not bring up this topic again. Instead, he started to chat casually with Liu Yi.

After a few rounds in the open sea, Xia ruofei asked Liu Yi to drive the yacht back.

After returning to the yacht dock, they took the battery – powered car to the Yacht Club.

Xia ruofei paid the rest of the payment happily. At the same time, he also chose a few pieces of equipment such as a Jacuzzi, top – tier music and video entertainment system, etc. These were also promised by Qin Lan when she was promoting the yacht. As long as the total price did not exceed 500000 Yuan, the Yacht Club would upgrade and transform the yacht for free.

Xia ruofei left the transfer and other procedures to Qin Lan. He then drove away from the Yacht Club with Ling Qingxue and headed straight for the lingji food and beverage headquarters.

After Ling Qingxue went back to work, Xia ruofei did not start the Knight XV SUV immediately. Instead, he sat in the car and lit a cigarette. After taking a deep puff, he began to think about who to look for to help with the yacht license.

After much thought, Xia ruofei decided to give Liu Zhe a call.

Liu Zhe was one of the few rich kids of Sanshan that Song Wei had introduced to him. His father was the leader of the southeast province’s state – owned assets Supervision and Administration Commission. He had many friends in Sanshan and was quite capable. Among those rich kids, Liu Zhe had the best relationship with Xia ruofei.

“Brother Xia!” Liu Zhe quickly picked up the phone and said with a smile,”you haven’t contacted me in a while!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Liu Zhe, I wasn’t at the three mountains for a while. How are you guys?”

“We’re all fine!” Liu Zhe said,”brother Xia, if you have time, let’s meet up! We haven’t had a drink together in a long time!”

Liu Zhe and the others had already taken Xia ruofei seriously when Song Wei personally supported him. That time, when the capital’s rich Playboy, Tian Xiaojun, tried to take over Xia ruofei’s paradise Corporation, he first contacted Xia ruofei through Liu Zhe. In the end, it just so happened that Zhao Yongjun and the other top rich Playboys had formed a group to look for Xia ruofei at the three mountains. Tian Xiaojun and the others had been humiliated.

Liu Zhe had personally witnessed Xia ruofei’s terrifying connections, so he paid more attention to Xia ruofei. Since Xia ruofei had called him, he naturally wanted to be on good terms with him.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”sure!” I’ll see when I’m free and I’ll arrange this! By the way, Liu Zhe, I’m looking for you today because I need your help ...”

“Brother Xia, please tell me!” Liu Zhe hurriedly said,”it’s your order. However difficult it may be, I will definitely help you accomplish it!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it’s not that serious ... Liu Zhe, I wanted to ask you if you know anyone in the maritime department.” It’s best if they have a certain rank and are able to help. ”

“The maritime department?” Liu Zhe thought for a while and said with a smile,”I do know someone who can do things! Brother Xia, you might have seen this person before. I remember that he was there when we were drinking. ”

“Oh? Which one?” Xia ruofei asked.

“His name is Shi Qiang, and his father is the leader of the southeast maritime Bureau.” Liu Zhe said,”as long as it’s not too difficult, he can handle it himself!”

“Is that so?” Xia ruofei was elated.”That’s great!”

Liu Zhe asked,”brother Xia, what do you want to do?” Tell me first! I’ll call Shi Qiang later!”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,””I can’t explain it clearly over the phone. Make an appointment with Shi Qiang and see if he’s free. If he’s free, let’s have dinner together tonight. I’ll arrange it!”

Liu Zhe smiled.”Brother Xia, you don’t have to be so polite. It’s our honor to be able to help you with something!”

Xia ruofei said,”let’s talk when we meet!” Please help me make an appointment with Shi Qiang and see if he’s free. ”

“Of course I’m free!” Liu Zhe said,”brother Xia’s matter, even if it’s a big deal, he has to put it aside first!”

Although Shi Qiang’s father and Liu Zhe’s father were at the same level, the power of the SASAC was much greater than that of the maritime department, so Shi Qiang had always followed Liu Zhe’s lead. This was also why Liu Zhe had agreed before contacting Shi Qiang.

Xia ruofei said,”in that case, let’s set it at 6:30 tonight!” Let’s go to Ling Ji’s private kitchen!”

“Alright!” Liu Zhe said,”brother Xia, I won’t leave until I see you!”

After Xia ruofei hung up the phone, he started the car and drove towards the direction of the Tao Yuan building. He had gone directly from Ling Xiaotian’s house to the yacht Pier in the morning and had not been to the company today!

Xia ruofei arrived at the peach blossom mansion and parked the car in the underground parking lot. Then, he took the elevator to the chairman’s office.

Xia ruofei had barely sat down when the phone on his desk vibrated. Xia ruofei saw that it was his future father – in – Law, Ling Xiaotian, and quickly answered the call.

As soon as the call connected, Ling Xiaotian’s forthright laughter immediately came from the other end of the phone,””Ruofei, do you have enough cash after buying the yacht? I have to prepare a sum of money in advance!”
