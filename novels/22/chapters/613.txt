Chapter 614: Crossing acraepoids, young master Song (1)

“Yup! Is there something wrong?” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”why are you so surprised?”

“What’s wrong with that?”song Rui said angrily. It was simply too inappropriate! Do you know how much my grandfather gave me after I begged him for so long and acted so cute?”

“How much?”

“You only gave me one packet!” Song Rui said in grief and indignation,”he ... He actually gave you two at once! Who’s his real grandson?”

Xia ruofei looked at song Rui with sympathy and said with a smirk,””You should be asking the provincial head judge, Song Jin, that question!”

“Get lost!” Song Rui shouted,”I don’t care! Where’s the cigarette? Hurry up and take it out! Whoever sees it will have a share, you give me one!”

“What do you mean by just one? Where was there only one? You’re here to Rob us!” Xia ruofei said,”I can only give you one pack at most!”

“Why are you so stingy?” Song Rui shouted,”you already have two and you’re giving me one? Aren’t we brothers? At least eight packets!”

“Two packs! I don’t have any more!”

“Six packets!”

“Three packets! It can’t be any more!”

“Five packets!”

“Four packets!”

......

“Four and a half packets!”

“Four packets and five sticks!” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Four packets and eight sticks!”

“Four packets and six sticks!”

“Four packets and seven sticks!”

“Four packets and six and a half sticks ...”

“You’re crazy!” Song Rui shouted,”I’m just asking you one question. Why did you give me half a stick?”

“I’ll light it first and I’ll give it to you when I draw the remaining half,”Xia ruofei said calmly.

“Woof! Even if you don’t find it dirty, I do!” Song Rui shouted.

They heard a loud thud outside the door. The two of them looked up and saw Feng Jing standing at the door, overjoyed.

Feng Jing heard Xia ruofei’s voice and walked over from the office next door. She had heard the entire process of Xia ruofei bargaining with song Rui.

When the two of them mentioned four packs of cigarettes, Feng Jing was already speechless. Yingying was just like a child who hadn’t grown up yet!

When Xia ruofei said to suck half of it before giving it to song Rui, Feng Jing couldn’t help but laugh.

“It’s President Feng ...” Xia ruofei said.”What’s the matter?”

“Oh ... Nothing much,” Feng Jing said, trying to hold back her laughter.”I just wanted to report to you about some daily work. Chairman, you can go and entertain your friend first!”

Feng Rao nodded at song Rui and left.

A burst of suppressed laughter could be heard faintly.

Xia ruofei said,”look, look ... You’re embarrassing yourself in front of a beauty!” The great song family’s eldest son is actually fighting for half a cigarette with his face red and neck thick ...”

“When did I say half a cigarette? It’s obviously you!” Song Rui said,”stop talking nonsense. Where are the cigarettes? Hurry up and take it out ...”

Then, song Rui reached out to Xia ruofei’s pocket.

Xia ruofei quickly dodged and said,”can you use your brain?” Have you ever seen anyone put an entire pack of cigarettes in their pocket? Do you think my pocket is A Doraemon version?”

Song Rui smiled awkwardly. Xia ruofei said unhappily,””I’ll keep my word, four packets and six and a half sticks ...”

“Don ‘t, don’ t, don ‘t. I don’t want half. Give me four packets of six cigarettes ...” Song Rui said quickly.

“Alright! I’ll get it for you before you leave!” Xia ruofei said,”I think this is all you’ve got!”

“You know nothing!” Song Rui said disdainfully,”this is a powerful weapon for acting tough! Who knew how much face he would gain if he took it out at a gathering! Do you understand?”

“I really don’t understand the world of you popinjays ...” Xia ruofei said with a speechless expression.

Song Rui took out another cigarette from Xia ruofei’s cigarette box and lit it up. He took a deep breath and exhaled the smoke. He mumbled,””It’s a waste to give you this cigarette ...”

Xia ruofei rolled his eyes and said,”if you have something to say, say it!” I’m busy!”

“Busy your head!” Song Rui pouted and said,”you only came to work at 10:30. Who would believe you if you said you were busy?”

Xia ruofei’s expression did not change.”Child, you don’t understand the world of the head of the company. You’ll understand when you become the president of your family business.”

“Hey! Don’t provoke me!” Song Rui said,”I’m moving towards that goal now!”

“Alright! “Stop joking ...” Xia ruofei laughed.”Are you okay or not?” Don’t tell me he’s here just to smoke?”

Song Rui said,”I really do have something to talk to you about!” I remember that you invested in that Dingfeng winery, right? It’s the one that gave birth to the Eight Immortals drunk. ”

“Yup! What’s wrong?”

“Get me fifty boxes of wine!” Song Rui said,”our company is going to organize a large – scale business dinner. We are going to use Drunken Eight Immortals as the white wine, but the people in the logistics department can’t get it. I have to do it myself!”

Xia ruofei laughed,”just this?” Can’t you just make a phone call? Was there a need to personally make a trip? I’ve lost a few packs of cigarettes for nothing!”

“I haven’t been to your place in a while, so I decided to drop by to take a look,” song Rui said unhappily. Why are you so stingy? You’re not even willing to take a few packs of your cigarettes!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”who asked you to come here and ask for help like you’re the king?” Alright, there’s no problem with that. I’ll make a phone call now, and you can ask someone to go directly to the factory to pick up the goods!”

After that, Xia ruofei took out his phone and called Li Jing, the sales manager of Ding Feng winery, to tell him about the matter.
