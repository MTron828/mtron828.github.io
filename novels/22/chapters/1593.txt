Translator: 549690339

As he thought, he drew on the paper and confirmed a few formation patterns.

As for which one or several he would choose, Xia ruofei would need to further deduce and experiment.

Naturally, these things could not be done in the office.

Xia ruofei looked at the time on the wall clock. It was 12 o’ clock. He packed his things, stood up, and walked out of the office.

Since he was alone, Xia ruofei did not bother to open the fire and ate his lunch in the canteen on the first floor.

Dong Yun, who had asked for a car in the morning, did not return to the farm in the afternoon.

Xia ruofei was still thinking about how to ask Dong Yun to stay and work. Now that Dong Yun was not back, Xia ruofei’s plans to bring up the topic were all in vain.

After lunch, Xia ruofei did not go back to the villa to rest. Instead, he drove the overbearing Knight XV off – Road vehicle out of the farm and headed straight to the city.

After dinner, he was scrolling through the news on his phone out of boredom when he happened to see a yacht exhibition being held at the Sanshan Convention and Exhibition Center. He immediately had the idea of going to take a look.

He mainly wanted to see if there were any suitable yachts or motorboats. He wanted to buy one and put it in the spirit map space.

The ocean in the mountain and sea realm was increasingly vast. Furthermore, the spirit Herb Island was protected by a barrier, making it impossible to directly teleport over. If one did not want to swim to the island every time, it was extremely necessary to purchase a suitable means of transportation on the sea.

Xia ruofei was the kind of person who would do what he said. Besides, he was not short of money now, so he drove directly to the seaside Strait Exhibition Center in the southern suburbs of Sanshan city.

After alighting from the airport Highway, the car went straight to the winding highway. They crossed Min River through Gushan bridge. Xia ruofei drove down the ramp skillfully and followed the jiangbin highway to the exhibition center on the side of Min River.

After all, yachts were relatively niche consumer goods. Therefore, the yacht exhibition was not as popular as the auto show. Xia ruofei did not encounter any traffic jams along the way and easily found a parking space in the exhibition center.

After he bought a ticket at the entrance, he entered the exhibition center.

The yacht exhibition was not in the traditional exhibition hall. Instead, it was in the water exhibition hall of the exhibition center. Xia ruofei followed the direction signs and arrived at the yacht exhibition site in a short while.

On the shore, colorful flags fluttered, and various brand posters and advertisements could be seen everywhere.

Not far away, dozens of yachts of various sizes were anchored. Some temporary passages were set up to allow visitors to admire these yachts at a closer distance.

Of course, if they encountered a yacht that they were interested in, they could also apply to board the yacht for a tour.

There were not many people at the yacht exhibition. Once Xia ruofei arrived, a staff member came to receive him.

“Sir, are you here to see the yacht?” A well – dressed young man came up and said,”our yacht in azmu Italy, is very popular with high – end users. Many world – Class rich people are our customers. Are you interested in learning more about it?” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Although Xia ruofei looked very young and was dressed very ordinarily, the staff did not judge a book by its cover and was very friendly.

Xia ruofei looked at the yacht not far away with interest and asked casually,””There’s quite a number of yachts here for the exhibition!”

The young man smiled and said,”there are about 40 brands participating in this yacht exhibition. There are more than a dozen world – Class brands like azmu. In addition, there are some well – known domestic brands, including those from taishen Bay.”

“If I order a yacht from the exhibition, can I get it in stock?” Xia ruofei asked again.

The young man was stunned. Although there were more and more rich people in the yacht exhibition, it was rare to see someone like Xia ruofei who did not understand the situation and only cared about whether there were any yachts in stock.

A yacht was not like a car. The cheaper ones were tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands. The more expensive ones were hundreds of thousands. One or two million was considered a luxury car.

These yachts cost tens of millions or even hundreds of millions.

Even the rich and powerful would have to understand the parameters in detail and compare them repeatedly before buying.

The young man gave Xia ruofei a strange look, but he still answered with all his heart,””Sir, the yacht is usually ordered. It’s very rare to have it in stock, but after the order is placed, the factory will speed up. You’ll only have to wait one or two months at most before you can see the yacht you like. Moreover, azmu also provides a custom service. We can arrange the configuration according to your personal preference.”

“Is that so ...” Xia ruofei thought for a moment, then pointed at the motorboats not far away and asked,”what about the motorboats?” You should have some in stock, right?”

The young man was even more dumbfounded. He thought to himself, why is this person kicking me in the sky and in the ground? Could a motorboat be compared to a yacht? The price was less than a fraction of the yacht, right? It seemed like this person didn’t really want to buy it ...

The young man was a little depressed, but he still said professionally,””There should be some motorboats in stock, but I don’t know much about them. Sir, you can ask their staff.”

“Okay, thank you!” Xia ruofei nodded.

He turned around after taking two steps and said,””Do you have a brochure on your yacht? If there is, give me a copy. I want to understand the situation!”

“There are! Please wait a moment!” The young man quickly handed a beautifully printed picture book to Xia ruofei.”My number is on this. If you need anything, you can contact me directly!”

He was just making a bet and did not expect Xia ruofei to really buy a yacht.

Xia ruofei smiled as he took the album and walked towards the motorboat.

There were about six or seven motorboat brands on display.

Compared to the luxury yachts, the motorboats were obviously more popular. After all, this was something that even civilians could afford. Although not many people would spend 100000 or 200000 Yuan on a motorboat to play with, unless they were rich.

When Xia ruofei arrived, many staff members came to receive him.

After briefly understanding the situation and confirming that there was stock in stock, he ordered pang Bo’s happiness GTR engine 230 without much comparison.

Pombardi was a brand under pombardi, the famous aircraft manufacturing company.

The motorboat had an Ergolock system and a new powerful pressurized 230 – horsepower Rotax engine. It was very well maneuvered.

It only took 5.29 seconds to accelerate from 0 to 60 mph (equivalent to 96.6 km/h).

After reading the introduction, Xia ruofei fell in love with this ferocious water beast. He did a quick search on the internet and found out that it was the top brand among the motorboats. Hence, he placed the order without hesitation.

Because the total price of this motorboat was only about 150000 Yuan, this amount of money was really small for Xia ruofei. He directly paid the full amount with his card on the spot.

The goods were already prepared at the exhibition hall, but they were not in the water exhibition hall.

After Xia ruofei had paid the money, pang Bo company would be responsible for transporting the motorboat to the designated location.

Naturally, Xia ruofei chose the warehouse in the city. However, he could not send it back to the farm. If it disappeared, he would not be able to explain it.

Pang Bo needed to transfer the goods to the land exhibition hall where they stored the physical stock. He also needed to transfer the transport vehicles, so it would take some time.

Xia ruofei was not in a hurry. While he was waiting, he flipped through the brochure that the saleswoman from azmu had given him.

In fact, Xia ruofei had heard of the azmu yacht. When he was in Hong Kong, the MA family had already ordered a super luxurious azmu yacht.

When Xia ruofei was experiencing the yacht, he had praised it and Ma Zhiming had almost given it to him without a word.

In Australia, Xia ruofei had also been on Tang Yitian’s yacht, which was also azmu ‘s.

This meant that the top rich people loved this brand.

Xia ruofei looked at the yachts in the beautiful picture book and suddenly had the idea of ordering one ...
