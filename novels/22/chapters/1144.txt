Translator: 549690339

Liuhai Lane was located near Shichahai in the center of the capital. It started from Pine Street in the East and reached Desheng Gate Street in the West. It was about 160 meters long and 4.5 meters wide. Cars could drive in directly.

Zhao Yongjun asked while driving,””Xiao Rui, ruofei, do you know why this alley was named liuhai alley?”

“How would I know?” Song Rui said,”could it be related to the girl’s bangs?”

Xia ruofei also said honestly,””I can’t think of anything. Brother Zhao, can you introduce us?”

Xia ruofei was not familiar with the capital. He would never comment on things he was not familiar with.

From this point, one could also see the difference in his character with song Rui ‘s.

Zhao Yongjun looked at song Rui with a smile and said,””I knew you would say that! In fact, this liuhai Lane has nothing to do with your bangs. It’s said that it was named by a man named Liu Han. At that time, it was called liuhan Lane. However, no one knew who this Liu Han of the Ming Dynasty was after a long time. In the year of Lord Qianlong, it was changed to liuhai Lane of xianyin. As for who this Liu Han was, no one would even think about it!”

“I see!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I always thought that the names of the alleys in the capital were strange. It seems that every alley has a story!”

“Yup! There are even ‘Wang Ba Hutong’,’GUI men Hutong’,’coffin Hutong’, and ‘dung beetle Hutong’!” Song Rui laughed and said,”I really can’t think of any words that people from Beijing can’t use in their Hutong names!”

The three of them couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

As they talked and laughed, the car arrived at the entrance of a courtyard house.

A man in his mid – thirties was standing at the entrance of the courtyard. He was dressed in a well – tailored suit and his leather shoes were shiny. He had a meticulous side – parted hair that would make a fly slip if it stood on it. With a pair of exquisite gold – rimmed glasses, he looked refined.

Standing in front of the Beijing – style courtyard house, he had the demeanor of an intellectual from the time of the People’s Republic of China.

He obviously recognized Zhao Yongjun’s car. From afar, he showed a warm smile and waved to Zhao Yongjun.

Zhao Yongjun’s car drove past, and he rolled down the window and stuck his head out. He smiled and said,””Brother Wu!”

Brother Wu also laughed and said,”the brave army is here!” Let’s park the car inside!”

After saying that, he turned around and opened the gate of the courtyard house.

The siheyuan had been renovated. The steps at the entrance had been replaced with a cement slope, and the threshold had been removed for the convenience of cars. After all, the alley was not very wide, and it was easy to cause traffic congestion if cars were parked outside.

Zhao Yongjun drove the car into the yard and the three of them got off separately.

Brother Wu also walked in. He turned around and closed the door, then quickly walked over and gave Zhao a warm hug.

“Yongjun, I haven’t seen you in a long time. You seem to have put on weight again!” Brother Wu patted Zhao’s shoulder and said.

“Brother Wu is still as elegant as ever! It seems like the US is also in a good place!” Zhao Yongjun laughed. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

After the two exchanged a few words, Zhao Yongjun said,””Brother Wu, let me introduce you to my two brothers. This is Xia ruofei. He has a big business in the southeast province. This is song Rui, he’s here to watch the show!”

Then, Zhao Yongjun turned to Xia ruofei and song Rui and said,””RUO Fei, Xiao Rui, this is my good friend, Wu shuheng. He has already migrated overseas. He came back this time mainly because he needs cash flow for his overseas business and is preparing to sell this house.”

“Hello, Mr. Wu!” Xia ruofei smiled.

Song Rui also smiled and nodded at Wu shuheng.

Wu shuheng smiled gently at Xia ruofei and said,””Hello! I’ll call you Ruo Fei, you can call me brother Wu like Yongjun!”

Wu shuheng looked gentlemanly, but he had a straightforward personality. No wonder he could be friends with Zhao Yongjun.

Xia ruofei naturally accepted his advice and said with a smile,””Alright, brother Wu, please introduce this house to us!”

Wu shuheng nodded and said,”I bought this house in the 1990s. I renovated it again five years ago, so it’s still quite new now. If you buy it, you can move in directly with your bag.”

Wu shuheng paused for a moment before continuing,”this house used to be the Beile mansion of the former Qing Dynasty. It was also the largest house in the entire alley. It has a total of three entrances. There are 16 North rooms, 5 East rooms, 4 West rooms, and 6 South rooms. The entire courtyard is very square, and it’s located in the center of the capital. It can be said to be a quiet place in the midst of chaos, very livable!”

While Wu shuheng was explaining, Xia ruofei listened and sized up the first courtyard.

The place where the car had just driven in should be a newly renovated door specially for vehicles to enter and exit. Standing in the courtyard, one could still see the main entrance of the courtyard house. It had an antique atmosphere. Behind the door, there was a traditional image wall. In order not to remove the image wall, a new garage door was opened next to it.

Wu shuheng saw Xia ruofei looking at the door and the screen wall, so he smiled and said,””Ruofei, this door and the image wall were repaired as they were. The design of the door is the wide and bright door, second only to the Wang Residence’s door. There is also a pair of drum – shaped door stools outside the door. In the Qing Dynasty, only officials of second rank and above were qualified to use them.”
