Chapter 1519: Chapter 888 – turn of events (2)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei’s face turned ugly. What he was most worried about had happened. Once the spirit body gave up on Song Wei’s body, he would have to be cautious. Moreover, the spirit body’s cultivation was much stronger than Xia ruofei ‘s. If it was not for the time formation, he would not be a match for it. The situation was even worse now.

After the spirit body finished speaking, it approached Xia ruofei with a murderous look.

Xia ruofei’s expression changed slightly. If the spirit charged at him, he would be in trouble. If he shot rashly, he might cause fatal damage to Song Wei’s body. Even if the spirit could not accurately hit the fatal spot, Xia ruofei could not guarantee that she would not be in danger if she dodged randomly.

If he didn’t shoot, Xia ruofei would have no way to resist the spirit body after it charged into the formation.

Xia ruofei’s mind was racing. He decisively waved his hand and kept the array flag. Then, he dashed towards the door of the stone room. Based on his previous experience, the spirit did not seem to dare to leave the stone room. In this situation, Xia ruofei could only ensure his own safety. Otherwise, he could not save song Wei.

The spirit body revealed a mocking smile and said,””Don’t you think it’s too late to leave now?”

With that, she moved in a flash and blocked Xia ruofei’s escape route with her absolute speed. She stood between Xia ruofei and the door of the stone room.

Xia ruofei could feel the undisguised killing intent from the spirit body. His heart sank. He could neither run away nor fight. He felt a deep sense of powerlessness.

The spirit body’s eyes shot out a cold glint as it slowly approached Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei secretly sighed. He frantically circulated the “great Dao technique” and was prepared to fight to the death.

At this moment, a heavy sigh suddenly sounded in the stone chamber.

The spirit body that was approaching Xia ruofei stopped in its tracks. Its expression changed and it turned its head to stare at a certain direction in the stone chamber.

Xia ruofei was stunned and followed the spirit body’s gaze.

The smooth stone wall actually slowly split apart, revealing a square cave that was about two meters wide and three to four meters deep.

There was a huge bronze coffin in the cave. There were complicated patterns and patterns carved on the coffin, which made people feel a chill.

“Old man! You’re not dead yet?” The spirit body said hatefully with a hint of fear in its voice.

“Even a scourge like you isn’t dead, so how can I die?!”

The voice seemed to come from all directions. Although it sounded old, it was sharp and caused Xia ruofei’s eardrums to hurt.

The spirit body snorted coldly and said,”so what if you’re not dead? Do you think you can stop me?”

The old voice calmly said,””After so many years, you still can’t let go of your obsession? Your physical body has already been destroyed, so why do you still insist on it?”

“It’s not your place to meddle in my Affairs!” The spirit body said sternly,”if it wasn’t for you, old fart, I wouldn’t have ended up in this state!”

“You should know that your soul is only able to survive until now because I’ve been merciful.” The old voice said.

The spirit body sneered and said,” If I remember correctly, you were also seriously injured at that time and couldn’t even leave that coffin. If you had the ability to kill me completely, would you have let me live for another two hundred years?”

The old voice sighed,””Leave the woman’s body and let the young man in front of you go. You can still keep your spirit body ...”

“Bullshit!” The spirit body cursed,”living like that is worse than death. It’s better to have your soul scattered! It wasn’t easy for me to find a suitable body, and you want me to give up with just a few words from an old man? Simply dreaming! And this brat, he’s ruined my plans time and time again. If I don’t kill him, how can I still have face?”

“You’re so stubborn!” The old voice said,”it seems that I can only help the heavens walk the path again ...”

As soon as the voice fell, the copper coffin began to creak. The sound was very horrifying, making people feel as if their teeth were aching.

Xia ruofei watched helplessly as the lid of the coffin was slowly pushed open. Then, a pale, bony hand reached out from the coffin. He could not help but feel a chill run down his spine.

Was this a human or a ghost?

Would a zombie appear later?

The spirit body’s expression also changed greatly. It subconsciously took two steps back and stared at the bronze coffin.””You ... Have you suppressed the injuries in your body?”

She knew how terrifying her opponent was. The reason why she was fearless just now was that she also knew that her opponent had been seriously injured in the great battle two hundred years ago and had to suppress his injuries in a place of extreme Yin. This stone room was originally a place where Yin Qi gathered, and the copper coffin was even more so arranged with a powerful Yin gathering formation.

If her opponent’s injuries had recovered and he could even leave the coffin, she might not be his match.

The old voice directly answered the spirit body’s words with action. The other hand also reached out of the coffin. Then, a person, or more accurately, a dried corpse, slowly emerged from the coffin.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but take a deep breath. Was this really the same person? The “dried corpse” in front of him was in tatters. It was the kind that was only skin and bones in the true sense. From a distance, it was basically no different from a skeleton.

If it were not for the deep eye sockets and the pair of cloudy eyes that occasionally showed a bit of life, Xia ruofei would really think that it was a skeleton.

He was shocked. From the conversation between the “dried corpse” and the spiritual body, the “dried corpse” must have been lying in the coffin for 200 years. To think that it was still alive after 200 years. Furthermore, it was 200 years without eating or drinking. Even though Xia ruofei had come into contact with cultivation, he still found it unbelievable.

Compared to Xia ruofei’s curiosity and surprise, the spirit body was even more shocked.

Her eyes revealed a trace of fear, and she subconsciously took a few steps back.

“I don’t believe you’ll dare to leave the coffin!” The spirit body said sternly,”do you not want to live anymore?”

The upper body of the “mummified corpse” had already peeked out of the coffin. He grinned, which looked rather terrifying to Xia ruofei.

“You know my strength,” the “mummified corpse” said indifferently.”I have no problem killing you before I die!”

The spirit body gritted its teeth and asked,”old man, what’s your relationship with these two people?” Is it worth your effort to protect it?”

The “mummified corpse” said,”no matter whose body you’ve taken, I won’t let you have your way. We’ve already wasted two hundred years. How can I watch you succeed in taking over the body and continue to wreak havoc in the world?”

“Don’t talk to me like that!” The spirit body said disdainfully,”I don’t believe that an old man like you would give up your life for the sake of so – called righteousness!”

The “dry corpse” looked at Xia ruofei meaningfully and said,””Why don’t you try and see if you believe me? I know you’re constantly eroding that woman’s soul, so don’t even think about stalling for time. I’ll give you ten breaths to consider. If you don’t leave that woman’s body after ten breaths, I’ll kill you even if I have to give up my old life!”

The spirit body trembled slightly and stared at the ‘dried corpse’.””Old man, you’re meddling too much! Even if I successfully possess this body, it’s impossible for me to leave this place. Your reason is not valid at all!”

“You have seven breaths to make a decision,” the “mummified corpse” said lightly.

“How about we make a deal?” The spirit body said,”if you don’t stop me from possessing you, I’ll tell you the whereabouts of that thing ...”

The “mummified corpse’s” expression changed. Xia ruofei, who was beside him, also looked nervous. He knew that this was a critical moment.

Xia ruofei didn’t know why the ‘dry corpse’ wanted to help him and Song Wei, but Xia ruofei was clear that the ‘dry corpse’ was tempted. If he didn’t care about this matter anymore, it would be difficult for him and Song Wei to escape. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Xia ruofei and the spirit body stared at the ‘dried corpse’ nervously. After a while, the ‘dried corpse’ finally spoke.
