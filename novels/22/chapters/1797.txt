Chapter 1798: Cultivating the heart - concentrating grass (2)

Translator: 549690339

When he had gone to the mountain and sea realm to retrieve the heart condensing grass, he had also seen a large oak Forest. This was the result of Xia Qing’s work these past few days.

As Australia would need a large number of high – Quality oak trees next year, Xia ruofei arranged for Xia Qing to start planting from Australia.

In order to ensure that these oak trees could be cut down next year, Xia Qing had to plant them in yuanchu. When the oak trees had grown to a certain extent, she would then transplant them one by one. One could imagine the amount of work required.

Xia ruofei said,”I’ve already gathered the materials from the outside world. Once I’ve gathered all the materials, I’ll try to make a puppet. Then, you won’t have to work so hard like you are now!”

“That’s great!”Xia Qing happily said. With a few helpers, my work efficiency will be even higher!”

When Xia Qing heard the news, the first thing she thought of wasn’t to rest. In fact, he didn’t need to rest. The first thing she thought of was to work more efficiently.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”then I’ll go out first!” That’s right, that realm Fox hasn’t been dishonest recently, right? You have to take good care of it!”

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing said,”little white won’t mess around now, and it seems to have some enlightenment. It hasn’t moved from its nest recently, and it has been cultivating every day.”

“He has a new comprehension so quickly!” Xia ruofei said,”as expected of the space pet! Forget it! He would let it cultivate and comprehend in peace during this time! When I have the time, I should ask it for some rent! You can’t just eat and not work!”

Xia ruofei ‘s’ rental fee ‘was naturally to make use of the White realmfox’s spatial talent and get it to help him find more realm stones.

Xia ruofei did a simple inspection of the space. After seeing that everything was normal, he did not stay any longer and returned to the outside world.

When he came back just now, he didn’t even pack his luggage and directly entered the spirit map space.

Of course, Xia ruofei’s luggage was all for show. His things were all stored in the spirit map space.

After returning to the bedroom, Xia ruofei went to take a shower and changed into a set of clean and comfortable clothes.

Then, he took out his phone and gave Song Wei a call.

“You’ve met sister Qingxue?” Song Wei asked with a smile as soon as she picked up the phone. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Yup!” Xia ruofei said,”I asked her to pick me up from the airport today!”

“How is it? Did you tell her about your cultivation?” Song Wei asked with concern.

“Yes, she didn’t believe it at first.” Xia ruofei said,”I had no choice but to show her my skills. That’s how I managed to subdue her!”

Song Wei laughed hysterically and said,”You can’t blame sister Qingxue for this! If you had told me a few months ago that there were still xiuzhenists in this world, I would have never believed you. ”

Then, Song Wei asked with concern,””Then have you checked sister Qingxue’s Constitution? Can she cultivate the “absolute beginning Heart Sutra”?”

Xia ruofei pretended to be relaxed and said,”don’t worry!” There’s no problem ...”

“That’s good ...” Song Wei heaved a sigh of relief, but at the same time, she felt a little disappointed.

Ling Qingxue was able to cultivate, which meant that in the near future, she would be able to experience the spirit body joint training. Song Wei believed that if Xia ruofei were to reveal everything to Ling Qingxue then, there was a high chance that Ling Qingxue would accept the fact that she was with Xia ruofei.

Did he really have to share his lover with others? Song Wei could not help but feel a little unwilling.

After all, Song Wei was a well – educated modern woman. It was impossible for her not to feel uncomfortable about sharing her lover with another woman.

However, she quickly pushed these thoughts out of her mind. She was the first to suggest this. When she thought of Xia ruofei and the wonderful feeling of the spirit body joint training, Song Wei felt that her unwillingness had disappeared.

Xia ruofei did not know that so many thoughts had flashed through song Wei’s mind in such a short time. He smiled and said, “Let’s not talk about Qingxue anymore. Weiwei, did you miss me?”

It was strange. Ever since the spiritual bodies of the two went through the joint training, Xia ruofei and Song Wei could say such sweet words without any obstacles in their hearts. It was as if the two of them were a couple who had been together for a long time.

It had to be said that the contact at the soul level was really too magical.

Song Wei’s face heated up slightly and she said in a low voice, “Don’t try to be glib with me, let’s settle sister Qingxue first! Otherwise, when sister Qingxue kicks you out, you won’t even have a place to cry!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”you’re looking down on me too much!” Wei Wei, just wait and see! It won’t be long before a female cultivator with the same cultivation level as you will appear!”

At this point, Xia ruofei’s tone turned gloomy. He said,””When the time comes, I’ll be honest with Qingxue. As for where she should go, it’s up to her to decide!”

Song Wei’s heart trembled and she said,”Ruofei, don’t think too much ... I think sister Qingxue will understand! If she really can’t accept it, you have to keep her. Just tell her that we’ve only practiced together once as spiritual bodies, and that we’re still innocent in real life ... At that time, I ... I can ... Leave you on my own ...”

Song Wei was a girl, so she had to endure a lot of shyness to say this. However, she still mustered up the courage to say it.

Xia ruofei’s heart felt warm as he said,”don’t let your thoughts run wild!” You’re destined to be my woman!”

Although Song Wei was very shy, she felt sweet in her heart.

Xia ruofei chatted with Song Wei for a while and said a lot of sweet nothings. It was about three in the afternoon when he hung up.

Now that Xia ruofei had nothing to do, he had to wait for two to three days for Xia Qing to cultivate the heart concentrating grass. Only then could he continue to worry about Ling Qingxue’s cultivation.

However, since he had already said that he was taking a break in the afternoon, Xia ruofei did not go to the office building. He went downstairs to play with Blackie and the rest for a while. At FiveO’ clock, he went to the kitchen to make some noodles.

At night, he continued to cultivate and consolidate his cultivation, then he went to bed early.

The next morning, Xia ruofei arrived at the staff canteen in the complex.

The cafeteria was quite popular. Many young employees lived in the company dormitory, so they were used to having breakfast in the cafeteria.

Hence, when Xia ruofei entered, everyone greeted him.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded at each of them. Then, he walked straight to Feng Jing’s table.

Although the cafeteria didn’t have a clear seating arrangement, everyone was used to having fixed seats. The table in the middle was usually for the company’s senior management.

Feng Jing was the only one at the table.

“Good Morning!” Xia ruofei greeted Feng Rao with a smile.

Feng Rao smiled at Xia ruofei and said,””Chairman, you look good! Did you rest well yesterday?”

“It’s alright!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

He saw that there were no other employees around, so he lowered his voice and said,””Sister ran, gather all the higher – ups above the director level this morning. I want to hear about everyone’s work during this period!”

“Don’t worry! I’ve already made the arrangements yesterday. ” Feng Jing said,”it’s 9 am in the company’s big meeting room. You’re okay with the time, right?”

“No problem!” Xia ruofei said.

The two of them chatted as they ate. When they were about to finish eating, Cao tieshu’s wife, who was working in the canteen, came out with a plate and said,”President Xia, President Feng, I just fried two Lotus – wrapped eggs. Try them!”

“I can’t eat anymore ...” Feng Jing laughed.”I’ll give it all to President Xia!”

Xia ruofei replied readily,”sure!” I have a good appetite! Digesting two more eggs would not be a problem! Thank you, Mrs. Cao!”

As Xia ruofei spoke, he picked up a poached egg and stuffed it into his mouth. After chewing for a while, he gave a thumbs up and said,””It’s still sweet, the heat is just right! Mrs. Cao’s cooking skills are getting better and better!”

Cao tieshu’s wife wiped her hands on her apron and said,””It’s good that you like it, President Xia. I’ll make you two a day later ...”

Following that, Cao tieshu’s wife hesitated for a moment before saying,”President Xia, there’s something ... I want ... To report to you ...”
