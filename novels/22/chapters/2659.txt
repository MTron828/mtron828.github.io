2660 The old company commander comes to seek shelter_2

Guo Zhan was silent for a moment before he said,”Ruofei, this time, the number of cadre positions has been reduced by a lot, and the number of leadership positions has been reduced even more. In addition, the unit has been downgraded, so Ma Jia might ...”

Xia ruofei fell silent. He had already guessed this outcome.

The lone wolf assault team, a regimental unit, became an assault Battalion under the Marine Brigade. The ones who were affected the most were the officers at ma SU’s level. After all, the section chiefs and old staff officers in the regimental office were all Deputy battalions. In addition, there were several Battalion Deputy battalion commanders and Deputy instructors ... After the transfer, the assault Battalion itself was only a Battalion – Level unit. How could they arrange so many people?

Ma SU’s body was still injured, so elimination was almost inevitable.

“Ma SU’s situation was considered by the organization, so he could choose to be diverted to other troops. To be honest, with ma SU’s military qualities, even if his ligaments were severed before, it would not be a problem for him to be the battalion commander of the Reconnaissance Battalion!”

“Yup! There’s no problem with the old company commander’s ability, and he has enough experience!” Xia ruofei said,”it’s not a bad choice to go to another unit!”

Guo Zhan glared at Ma Jia and said,””But this stubborn donkey firmly rejected the diversion plan!”

Speaking of this, Guo Zhan was also furious and said to ma su,”Kid, do you know how difficult it is to arrange for you to be promoted to a military commander in this situation? The group’s army chief ... Even the Army’s army chief spoke up for you personally, saying that you’re a second – Class hero who’s risked your life for the country and the Army, so you must be given special care! And you? He didn’t listen to anyone’s advice and let go of such a good opportunity! What are you planning?” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Wolf King,” ma su said with a smile,”this matter has already been settled. It’s no use for you to get angry ...”

“Isn’t this to make you angry? Whenever I think of this, I can’t help but get angry!” Guo Zhan said.

Guo Zhan was really nice to his subordinates, especially to people like Xia ruofei and ma su who had real skills. He was also good to them from the bottom of his heart. What he looked down on the most were those soldiers who were of poor quality and dawdled all day.

Of course, such soldiers basically didn’t exist in the lone wolf assault team.

The smile on Ma Jia’s face gradually disappeared. He said seriously,””Brigade leader, ruofei, I’m not as enlightened as everyone says ... Actually, my thoughts are very simple. I studied special combat in the military school and joined lone wolf not long after graduation. I’m already used to Being The Elite of the elite, the tip of the sharp knife! To be honest, I can’t get used to joining a normal Army!”

Speaking of this, Ma Jia picked up the cup in front of her, as if it was filled with fragrant wine, and drank it all in one gulp.

He continued,”since lone wolf doesn’t need me anymore, why should I force myself to stay in the Army?” If we were in another place, even if I’m wearing the same military uniform, even if there’s one more star on my qualification card, I wouldn’t be happy!”

“As for the second – Class hero that the Chiefs mentioned ...” Ma Jia said with a self – deprecating smile,”isn’t it normal for our lone Wolf’s soldiers to be rewarded for their contributions? After RUO Fei was discharged from the Army, he even made a second – Class merit! Our little contribution is nothing compared to the comrades who have sacrificed themselves! What right do I have to be a second – Class medal and be a battalion commander in another army?”

Xia ruofei, Guo Zhan, and the others were also moved.

Although ma SU’s words were simple and didn’t have much logic, they were very touching, especially those who had similar experiences. They had a strong sense of identity in their hearts.

Guo Zhan let out a sigh. He stood up and walked to Ma Jia’s side with a cup in his hand. He patted Ma Jia’s shoulder and said,”Good brother, I’ll toast to you alone!”

“Thank you, great captain!” Ma su quickly stood up and clinked his cup with Guo Zhan ‘s. After the two of them finished their drink, they couldn’t help but laugh.

After Guo Zhan returned to his seat, he turned to Xia ruofei and said,”RUO Fei, ma su, he ...”

“Great captain, let me say it myself!” Ma su interrupted Guo Zhan’s words.

Guo Zhan was stunned for a moment before he nodded silently.

“Ruofei, I heard from the brigade leader that your company needs talents with combat skills.” Ma Jia looked at Xia ruofei and said. If you don’t mind that one of my legs is already half – crippled, I plan to recommend myself!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but widen his eyes. In the afternoon, Guo Zhan had said that he wanted to arrange for officers to work for him. He was talking about Ma Jia!

“Old company commander, you have to consider this carefully!” Xia ruofei said,”you’ve made your choice, but there’s no medicine for regret. If you give up on the government’s resettlement work, it’s the same as giving up your position as a cadre and giving up the rest of your life!”

Ma Jia smiled and said,”it’s not as serious as you say. I’ve served in the Army for 18 years this year. According to the policy during the reform period, Deputy Battalion officers can also choose their own profession after 18 years. This can be considered as a special treatment for us who were eliminated ...”

Guo Zhan chuckled and said,”if you choose your own career, you’ll at least be able to get a retirement pension every month after you leave. Although the money will be less, at least you won’t starve to death.” If it wasn’t for this policy, I wouldn’t have agreed to let this little rascal leave! Of course, ruofei, you weren’t here yet at that time. Now, it seems that ma SU’s choice to help you out with his own career was not a bad one!”
