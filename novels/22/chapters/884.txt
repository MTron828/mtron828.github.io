Chapter 885: Drinking and chatting merrily (2)

Translator: 549690339

This meant that Guangzhi Cao and Xia ruofei were probably meeting for the first time today. In the past, they had only talked on the phone.

Guangzhi Cao was already so respectful when they first met, and when he thought about how he Feng, who had always been low – Key and cautious, actually had the confidence to fight him head – on, it already explained the problem.

The conclusion was that young master Xia was very likely to have a close relationship with the new Secretary.

This was the only reasonable explanation for Guangzhi Cao and he Feng’s attitude.

Thinking of this, yang Jianren couldn’t help but break out in a cold sweat.

The situation was worse than he had imagined ...

Yang Jianren sat on the sofa in a daze, staring at the crystal ashtray on the coffee table and not moving for a long time.

After a few minutes, yang Jianren finally stood up and quickly walked out of the villa. He drove back to the municipal Committee Family Hospital alone.

The more he thought about it, the more afraid he became. He felt that he had to report this to his father.

Although yang Jianren knew that he would be severely scolded by his father if he told him everything, he also knew that if he secretly hid it, it would cause his father to fall into a passive situation without knowing it, and the consequences would be more serious.

His father was an old official who had been through the ups and downs of the court for many years. He would definitely have a better idea than him.

Yang Jianren was even more concerned about his position than yang Jinsheng, because he knew that everything he had was brought about by his father’s official title. Without that black hat, he was nothing.

The car roared and rushed out of the villa. Yang Jianren, who was nervous, was ready to confess to his father.

……

At the West River Moon Club.

Xia ruofei and the other two were having a good time drinking. Three out of the six bottles of Drunken Eight Immortals had been opened, and there was only a little white wine left in the kettle on the table. On average, each of them had drunk about a pound.

Of course, President Zheng had also come over to propose a few toasts. There was still a little wine left on the table, so each of them had actually drunk about seven or eight taels.

Xia ruofei probably drank the most, because he Feng and Cao Guangzhi kept toasting to him.

However, Xia ruofei’s alcohol tolerance was good when he was in the Army. Now that he had been taking the body tempering soup regularly, his alcohol tolerance seemed to have increased as his physique improved. He only felt a little dizzy after drinking one pound of white wine.

On the other hand, he Feng and Guangzhi Cao were already red – faced from all the drinking. He Feng, who was the most enthusiastic in toasting, was even talking a bit too much.

“Brother ... Brother Xia, it’s so fun ... To drink with you!” He Feng chuckled and said,”come, let’s have another round!”

Xia ruofei smiled and raised his glass. He clinked his glass with he Feng’s and said,””Mayor he, please do as you wish.”

Xia ruofei finished the wine in his glass.

He Feng’s eyes were a little dazed as he smiled and said,””As you wish ... How ... How can I do that! Who would dare to drink casually with brother Xia? Chief Cao, do you dare to?”

After he finished speaking, he Feng also downed his glass without hesitation.

Guangzhi Cao’s condition was slightly better than he Feng ‘S. He smiled and said,”Of course I can’t be casual! Not only can’t I drink casually with brother Xia, I’ve also never drunk casually with District head he!”

He Feng gave Guangzhi Cao a thumbs up and said,”Director Cao, that’s interesting! If you have any requests in the future, I will not refuse!”

He Feng was using the alcohol as an excuse to show his loyalty. He wasn’t only showing his loyalty to Cao Guangzhi, but also to song Qiming, Secretary song, who Cao Guangzhi represented.

Guangzhi Cao was also secretly envious of he Feng’s good luck. He Feng was originally a Deputy Mayor ranked at the bottom, but because of this encounter, his future path of development might be much smoother.

Guangzhi Cao smiled as he raised his glass, “You’re too kind, Mayor he. Let’s get closer in the future. ”

He Feng was overjoyed. He quickly stood up and walked to Guangzhi Cao’s side. He clinked his cup with Guangzhi Cao’s and said,”Director Cao, I’ll drink first!”

With that, he Feng raised his head and finished the glass of white wine, then showed Guangzhi Cao the bottom of the glass.

Xia ruofei chuckled as he watched from the side. He knew a little about the politics of the government but he would not get involved.

Perhaps he Feng thought it was a rare opportunity to invite Xia ruofei and Guangzhi Cao, but in reality, Xia ruofei was just doing it casually. He always followed his heart.

He Feng had been very enthusiastic about Nan Nan’s admission. Objectively speaking, he had helped him, so he did not mind giving he Feng a hand.

After he Feng and Guangzhi finished their drinks, Guangzhi laughed and said,”Brother Xia, I went to the bathroom just now and yang Jianren called me again, but I didn’t answer it and hung up.”

Xia ruofei pursed his lips.”Don’t bother with this kind of person in the future. I think this guy is born to be a fraud. With a son like him, commander yang probably can’t even sleep well ...”

Guangzhi Cao and he Feng couldn’t help but burst out laughing, especially he Feng.

Guangzhi Cao continued,”brother Xia, I only found out today that the famous Peach Garden vegetables in the southeast is produced by your company. I still remember that a few months ago, when Peach Garden vegetables first appeared on the market, I brought my wife and child to eat it at Ling Ji restaurant once. After that, they couldn’t forget it. They wanted to eat it every few days! But Taoyuan vegetables are available every time we go there, and they’re also very expensive. If only I knew you earlier!”

After the meal, everyone knew each other’s situation very well. Guangzhi Cao also knew that Jianren yang was not wrong. Xia ruofei did start a company for agricultural products, but Jianren Yang’s words were too mean and annoying.

Guangzhi Cao also knew that Xia ruofei’s strength was not as simple as it seemed. Otherwise, how could a small business owner be valued by Secretary song? Guangzhi Cao didn’t look down on Xia ruofei at all. On the contrary, he was full of praise for Xia ruofei’s business.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”brother Cao, now that we’ve expanded our production, we should be able to sell them in the big supermarkets in the three mountains.” However, it was still a little difficult to achieve a sufficient supply, so the supermarkets were often out of stock. But if you want to eat, just give me a call and I’ll guarantee a sufficient supply!”

Guangzhi Cao laughed,”then I won’t be polite ...”

“Hey, there’s no need to be polite with a few catties of vegetables.” Xia ruofei said,”if you think it’s too much trouble, I’ll get you a Gold Card for Ling’s restaurant. You’ll get a 50% discount on everything you spend and you can eat Taoyuan vegetables at any time!”

“Brother Xia, it looks like the boss of Ling’s restaurant really values you as a business partner!” Guangzhi Cao said, a little surprised.

“Brother Cao, it’s not really related to the cooperation ... It’s mainly because ... My girlfriend is the daughter of the boss of Ling Ji ...” Xia ruofei chuckled.

Guangzhi Cao and he Feng were stunned for a moment, then burst into laughter.

Guangzhi Cao laughed as he pointed at Xia ruofei,””Brother Xia, brother Xia, you’re really something! It’s fine if you want to cooperate with them, but you actually took their daughter away. This is a little unkind ...”

“Then you’re wrong about me ...” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Qingxue and I were junior high school classmates. We’ve known each other since ten years ago! The reason I’m working with Ling Ji F & B is also because of Qingxue. Otherwise, with my Taoyuan vegetables, many F & B companies would be fighting to cooperate with me! Why did I only choose Ling Ji?”

“So they’re childhood sweethearts!” Guangzhi Cao and he Feng looked at each other and said with a smile,”no wonder ...”

As they were chatting, Xia ruofei’s phone on the table vibrated.

He picked up his phone and glanced at it, then made a gesture to he Feng and Guangzhi Cao to keep quiet and said,””It’s Secretary song,”

He Feng and Cao Guangzhi immediately shut their mouths. They put down their glasses and looked at Xia ruofei nervously.

Xia ruofei quickly picked up the call and smiled.””Hello, Secretary song. Do you have any instructions?”

Song Qiming’s hearty laughter could be heard from the phone. He asked,””RUO Fei! I’m fine, I’m just asking you how’s the enrollment of your comrade’s child going? Are there any other difficulties?”
