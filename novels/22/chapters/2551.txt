In fact, Neto’s move was not considered overconfident. After all, the second half of the game had just begun. Valencia’s tactic was to carry out a strangulation in the midfield, forcing the Espanyol to continuously pass the ball back. He did not expect the Espanyol’s second pass to accurately find Xia ruofei, and Xia ruofei easily dodged the interception that Valencia’s players were determined to get.

Also, Xia ruofei’s decisiveness was beyond Neto’s expectations. In fact, Xia ruofei did not even look in the direction of the goal. It was not until he lifted his foot that Neto realized that it was a hanging shot.

Neto’s eyes narrowed. He stared at the football as he quickly retreated.

At this time, Neto was not very flustered, because the position of Xia ruofei’s kick was too far from the goal. According to his judgment, even if the ball was shot within the goal range, he would have enough time to react.

However, Neto’s expression quickly changed. He found that the speed of Xia ruofei’s hanging goal was beyond his expectations. It was much faster than he had predicted. In the blink of an eye, the football had already flown into the penalty area.

Neto hurriedly accelerated his retreat, but it was too late. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The ball was already over his head, and he was still a few meters away from the goal.

Neto gritted his teeth and stomped his feet in the process of retreating. He pulled up in place, hoping to intercept the ball in the air.

However, Xia ruofei’s leg shot was executed perfectly.

Even if Neto jumped with all his might, he still could not touch the ball, not to mention that he jumped in the process of retreating, which made the height even less.

Neto could only watch the football fly past at least 20 to 30 centimeters from the highest point of his fingertips.

When he fell heavily to the ground, he could still see the football whizzing into the net from the corner of his eye. It bounced around inside the goal and finally stopped.

Even the referee was stunned for a moment. Then he whistled and pointed to the serve point in the center circle.

A lightning – fast goal!

Less than a minute into the second half, or 13 seconds to be precise, the Spanish team was equalized by number 25, Xia ruofei, with a shocking drop shot near the center circle!

The Valensia manager did not even have time to sit down in the technical area. He was dumbfounded as he looked at the football that was still spinning inside the goal. He could not believe his eyes.

On the other hand, the Spanish substitutes ‘bench was in an uproar. The substitutes and coaching staff all jumped out of their seats and hugged the people around them to celebrate the goal.

Even puado jumped out of his seat reflexively, but he immediately realized that the one in the limelight was the Chinese player he hated the most, so the smile on his face was retracted before it could bloom.

However, the substitute player beside him held him and shouted in his ear,””This goal was too cowardly! It’s so F * cking awesome, isn’t it?”

Puador forced out a smile and said,”Yes, yes ...”

The substitute did not notice puado’s perfunctory reply. In fact, he was already in an extremely excited state. After hugging puado, he immediately turned around to hug another teammate.

Espanyol’s head coach, Ruby, widened his eyes in disbelief. At the same time, he waved his hands as if to confirm that he was not dreaming.

Ruby’s action was also faithfully recorded by the camera and became a very interesting behind – the – scenes footage of this round of La Liga. The Chinese sports media, in particular, repeatedly played this scene in the next few days.

From the perspective of the Chinese media and Chinese fans, it was indeed a very satisfying thing for a Chinese player to successfully stun their own head coach with his amazing performance.

In the away team’s stands, the fans had long gone crazy. From falling behind 0 – 2 not long after the start of the first half to the equalizer at the start of the second half, the feeling of the roller coaster – like ups and downs was too exciting.

Moreover, Xia ruofei’s hanging shot was so wonderful that it could be said to be one of the top ten goals in this round. Even in the long season, such a goal would be often mentioned.

Valencia’s goalkeeper, Neto, had it tough. Every time the goal was replayed in the future, he would become the backdrop, showing his most embarrassing scene in front of everyone.

Xue Jinshan and the others were jumping and shouting in the stands, completely free. Some of the employees of paradise Corporation did not watch football much before this. In the first half, they were still a little embarrassed, but now it seemed that they had already become one with the pure Spanish fans, there was no difference at all.

Xue Jinshan jumped as he shouted,”What did I say? As long as the chairman wanted to score, no one could stop him! What was awesome? This is called awesome!”

After half of the match, Xue Jinshan’s voice had become hoarse. His voice sounded somewhat comical, but no one laughed at him because they were all in the same mood.

The moment Xia ruofei kicked, Shen fangjian said subconsciously,””Xia ruofei was a little too hasty with this shot! He had already dodged the other side’s rush, and his own players had not yet cut in. Such a Big Shot ... Wait! This was a hanging door! Valencia’s goalkeeper, Neto, was running back with all his might! He jumped up ... But did not touch the ball! The ball went in! The ball is in!”
