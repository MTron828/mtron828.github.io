2577 Ruoxu Heart Sutra (1)

Those martial arts were all stuffed into Xia ruofei’s mind from the Jade talisman of inheritance. Although every martial art seemed to be engraved in his mind and he would never forget it, and even some of his cultivation insights and experiences were ready – made, Xia ruofei would not study those martial arts that he had no use for.

It was a little difficult for him to choose the most suitable one for song Qiming.

Xia ruofei carefully looked through them. There were a few martial arts that were not bad, but he was not sure which one was the most suitable.

After much thought, Xia ruofei decided to consult Xia Qing.

If it wasn’t for those damn laws, Xia Qing’s knowledge in cultivation would definitely be much more profound than Xia ruofei ‘s. However, due to the restrictions of the laws, Xia Qing couldn’t reveal many things to Xia ruofei.

However, these cultivation techniques from the Jade talismans of inheritance were all unlocked by Xia ruofei himself. In theory, all the ownership belonged to Xia ruofei, so they shouldn’t conflict with Xia Qing’s rules.

At the thought of this, Xia ruofei immediately used his mind to contact Xia Qing, who was in the spirit map space.

“Xia Qing!”

“Master, your subordinate is here!” Xia Qing immediately replied to Xia ruofei’s summoning.

“There’s something I’m not sure about, and I’d like to ask for your opinion. ” Xia ruofei said,”I want to teach someone a cultivation technique but I don’t know which one is more suitable for him. This person’s physique is suitable for cultivation, but he’s a bit older, about 50 years old ...”

Xia ruofei told Xia Qing about song Qiming’s basic condition. When Xia ruofei treated song Qiming, especially after he used the medicine made from the heart – concentrating grass, he had done a comprehensive examination on song Qiming many times. Therefore, he was very familiar with song Qiming’s physical condition.

“I’ve obtained a lot of martial arts from the Jade talisman of inheritance. Can you help me analyze which one is the most suitable for this person?” Xia ruofei asked.

Xia Qing clearly knew the contents of every jade talisman of inheritance. After hearing Xia ruofei’s words, he didn’t ask any more questions. Instead, he muttered to himself for a while and said,””Master, if the person you’re talking about is already over 50 years old, and he’s only starting to cultivate now ... I’m afraid it’s already a bit too late. Even if he successfully steps onto the path of cultivation, his future achievements will probably be limited.”

“I know that.” Xia ruofei said,”you don’t have to worry about this. I just need to know which martial arts technique is most suitable for him and at the same time, it can offset the disadvantage of being older.”

“If that’s the case, I recommend the modest Heart Sutra.” Xia Qing said,”the author of this cultivation technique is the famous perfected RUO Xu. He was an expert who shattered the void back then, and the cultivation technique he created also pointed directly to the great Dao!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows as soon as Xia Qing mentioned “if modest Sutra”.

This cultivation method was also among the few cultivation methods he had just selected, but he was not particularly optimistic about it. Although it was difficult to choose, if he had to rank the cultivation methods he had just selected, he was afraid that the “modest Sutra” would be the last priority.

Of course, it wasn’t that this cultivation technique was bad. Just as Xia Qing had said, the creator of this cultivation technique, master RUO Xu, was an expert who could shatter the void. He created this cultivation technique, and it was even named after him. How could it be bad? RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

The only reason why Xia ruofei did not think highly of this technique was that it was incomplete.

To be more precise, in the inheritance he had obtained, this cultivation method only had about one – third of the contents of the first part.

The value of an incomplete cultivation technique was naturally greatly reduced.

Even Xia ruofei was a little confused. Every technique in the Jade talisman of inheritance had its own characteristics but the rest of the techniques were complete. Only this technique was only one – third complete, but it was still recorded in the Jade talisman of inheritance.

Xia ruofei frowned.”I know the ‘modest Sutra’. It’s a good technique. But ... It’s not complete!”

Xia Qing smiled and said,”master, if the” modest Heart Sutra “is complete, then its value is probably no less than that of the” great Dao formula.”It is precisely because it is incomplete that it is recorded in the” human “jade talisman.”

Speaking of this, Xia Qing paused for a moment and immediately continued,””Although the [modest Sutra] is not complete, the Jade talisman only taught you the first one – third of it. Even without the latter part, the first part can still be cultivated. And ... Even if it’s only one – third of the content, it’s enough for a cultivator to reach the nascent Soul Stage!”

Hearing this, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but take a deep breath and said,””It sounds very powerful ... But I think you didn’t choose this incomplete cultivation method just because of this, right?”

Even though song Qiming was still far from being able to learn any techniques after the nascent Soul Stage, Xia ruofei had many techniques that could help him reach the nascent Soul Stage.

Since that was the case, why would he choose an incomplete cultivation technique?

Xia Qing smiled and said,”master, there’s no comparison between a cultivation technique that can only reach the nascent Soul Stage after complete cultivation and a cultivation technique that can reach the nascent Soul Stage after cultivating one – third of its content.” In terms of potential, the “modest Heart Sutra” ‘s advantage was obvious. In addition ...”
