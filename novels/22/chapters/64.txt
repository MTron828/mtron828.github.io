Chapter 65: Red Arowana (1)

After parking his car near the seafood market in the county, Xia ruofei strolled into the bustling market alone. However, he was not in a hurry to buy it. Instead, he strolled around the market first. When he saw buyers and sellers chatting, he would go over and listen to them to understand the situation. After walking around for a while, Xia ruofei had a general understanding of the aquatic products market. Not only did they sell all kinds of ornamental fish and edible fish, but they also sold all kinds of young fish. There was a wide variety of species. Xia ruofei knew that he had come to the right place. He should be able to buy what he needed here. Xia ruofei found a shop that looked quite big and walked in. On both sides of the store were rows of large glass water tanks with all kinds of ornamental fish. A chubby man came up to them and asked enthusiastically,” “Boss, are you here to buy fish?” Xia ruofei looked around the shop and said,” “You sell ornamental fish? Looks like we’re in the wrong place, I’m here to buy some fish ...” Then, Xia ruofei turned around and prepared to walk out of the store. The fat boss quickly stopped him and said, “Boss, don’t be in such a hurry to leave! We also sell fish fry here, and they’re all very high quality ones that were bred in an environment that imitates the wild! What kind of fish do you need? How much do you want?” Xia ruofei said,” “Just grass carp, carp, and chubs, mainly grass carp. I don’t need too much if I don’t overdo it ...” When Xia ruofei was shopping at the seafood market, he used his mobile phone to do some research. He found out that these three were the most common edible fish and could be mixed. The space fish pond had just been opened, so it was the most suitable to raise these common fish. “Yes, yes, yes! We have these fish in stock!” “How much do you need?” the fat boss asked. Xia ruofei made a rough estimate based on the information he found and said,” “There are about 500 grass fry, and 100 of each of the other two types!” Generally speaking, a fish pond could store about 8000 to 12000 fish per mu. The fish pond in the interspace was only twenty to thirty square meters, so five to six hundred fish should be suitable. However, the space was different from the outside world. Perhaps the breeding density could be higher. If that was the case, he could just add some more in. The fat boss smiled and said,” “That’s not a lot indeed ... According to the rules, we need at least 5000 fish to be considered as wholesale. But since it’s fate that we met, I can give you the wholesale price, how about 1.50 yuan per fish? Our fish are all bred in an environment that imitates the wild environment!” This price was similar to the one Xia ruofei had just found out. Hence, he nodded and said,” “Alright! Let’s take a look at the baby fish first!” “Alright!” The fat boss led Xia ruofei to the inside of the shop and pointed to a row of large fish tanks.” “These were just transported from the seedling base today. A few hundred fish isn’t much, we can just take them from the store. ” Xia ruofei took a look. These fish were generally two to three centimeters long. They were arranged neatly and had the same color. The fish looked clean and shiny. He nodded. The fat boss wasn’t lying. The quality of the fish fry should be good. Xia ruofei reached out and stirred the fish in the fish tank. The fish swam away quickly after being disturbed, and their reaction was very fast. Xia ruofei had an idea and said,” “Boss, the fish fry are pretty good. I have a large plastic bucket in my car. Please wait a moment, I’ll drive the car over!” “Alright, alright!” The fat boss responded. Xia ruofei returned to the parking lot and drove the pickup truck back to the fish fry shop. He took out a few large plastic buckets from the truck and brought them into the shop. The fat boss had already found a worker to wait there. Xia ruofei started to fish for the baby fish as soon as he entered. 500 to 600 fish was not a lot, and they were all caught in no time. Xia ruofei paid the total of 900 Yuan in cash. Recently, the West River Moon Club had been paying him 6000 to 7000 Yuan a day, so Xia ruofei had plenty of cash. The fat boss enthusiastically helped Xia ruofei move the plastic bucket to the pickup truck. Just as Xia ruofei was about to get into the car and leave, the shop assistant rushed out and said to the fat boss,” “Boss, that Red Dragon seems to be in a worse condition. I’m afraid it can’t survive ...” The fat on the fat boss’s face couldn’t help but tremble a few times. He showed a pained expression and said,” “Motherf * cker! I’ve suffered a huge loss this time ...” Xia ruofei asked curiously,” “Boss, what happened?” The fat boss said dejectedly,” “Hey! Don’t mention it ... I bought a Red Arowana a a few days ago. I wanted to raise it for a while and sell it for a good price, but I didn’t expect it to get sick in just five or six days. Now ... I don’t think it will survive today! I have to hurry over and see if there’s any other way ...” Xia ruofei’s heart skipped a beat. He was not in a hurry to leave and followed the boss back into the shop. The red Arowana was kept in a separate fish tank and was about 25 centimeters long. It could no longer maintain its balance and floated in the fish tank on its last breath. The red surface of its body was slightly black and had no luster. The shop assistant said anxiously,” “Boss, it hasn’t eaten for two days. Salt and penicillin have no effect. What should we do?” The fat boss was in a bad mood and said,” “How would I know what to do? I’m not a God, how can I possibly save it?” Then, the fat boss waved his hand and said,” “Forget it, just admit that you’re unlucky! Let’s just treat it as that 8000 Yuan went down the drain!” Xia ruofei looked at the dying Red Arowana and suddenly said,” “Boss, how about ... You sell this Red Arowana to me?” The fat boss was stunned for a moment and said,” “This fish is dying, it’s useless even if you buy it ... I’m doing legitimate business, I can’t do things that cheat people!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,” “He’s not dead yet, is he? I can’t have it even if I die. To tell you the truth, boss, I heard that Red Arowana tastes good either steamed or fried. I’ve wanted to get one for a long time to try, but the price is too expensive. Now that your fish is dying, why don’t you sell it to me at a lower price? you can reduce your loss ...” The fat boss was speechless. Red Arowana was a high – end ornamental fish with auspicious meanings, especially favored by businessmen. In Hong Kong and Macau, a good Red Arowana could be sold for millions or even millions, and this man wanted to buy it and kill it to eat? However, the fat boss couldn’t care less. At least Xia ruofei was right. If he didn’t sell it, the red Arowana might die today. It would be worthless then. If he sold it to Xia ruofei, he could at least make up for the loss. As for what Xia ruofei bought it for, it had nothing to do with him. After careful consideration, the fat boss nodded and said,” “Little brother, I can sell it to you, but you’ve seen the situation of this fish. You can’t go back on your word after buying it!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,” “Of course! Boss, give me a price! Don’t set it too high, I can’t afford it if it’s too high. ” The fat boss pondered for a moment and tentatively said,” “How about two thousand? Little brother, I bought this fish for 8000 Yuan. ” Xia ruofei thought for a moment and was too lazy to bargain. The main thing was that the red Arowana was about to die, and bargaining would waste time. He nodded and said,” “Deal!” Xia ruofei took out two thousand Yuan and handed it to the fat boss. The fat boss also let out a long sigh of relief. Although he lost 6000 Yuan, he finally sent this God of plague away, and it wasn’t like he lost everything. He made up his mind to never enter the Arowana again. He was scared of her just once. The fat boss gave Xia ruofei a small plastic water tank and carefully transferred the red Arowana into the tank. Xia ruofei walked out of the store with the water tank and placed it on the mat of the front passenger seat of the pickup truck. Then, he said goodbye to the fat boss, got into the car, and left in a hurry. The fish could not hold on for much longer. Xia ruofei drove very fast. After leaving the county, he found a place where there was no one and parked the car. Then, he used his mind to enter the spirit map space and took out a mineral water bottle. The bag contained the flower petal solution that he had prepared. He had originally planned to send it to Hu Zi’s mother, but he had been busy for the past two days and had not had the time to go over. Now, it came in handy. Xia ruofei unscrewed the bottle cap and poured two spoons of the petal solution into the plastic water tank. Then, he stared at the red Arowana in the water tank, feeling a little nervous ...𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com
