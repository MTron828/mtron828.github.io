Chapter 310: Opening price of 10 million (1)

Elder Tang wasn’t angry. He only smiled and said,””Mr. Xia, I didn’t say I wasn’t buying! I’m the one who needs the Phoebe zhennan, so I should be the one making the decision, shouldn’t I? Besides ... Although I’m old, I’m not so old that I can’t see clearly. I can still tell if the material is real or fake. ” After speaking, elder Tang looked at Liang Weihua with a half – Smile. Liang Weihua broke out in a cold sweat and hurriedly said,””Uncle, I don’t doubt your judgment ...” Elder Tang waved his hand and said kindly,””Wei Hua, I know this.” Meanwhile, Liang Weimin’s heart was practically blooming with joy. He put on a humble expression and asked,”Uncle, tell us about this material! It’ll also broaden our horizons!” The Liang family’s relatives all agreed, each of them looking for knowledge. Liang Weimin looked at elder Tang with eager eyes. He naturally hoped that elder Tang would say as much as he could. He wanted to use elder Tang’s words to refute Liang Weihua, but he didn’t even dare to say a word. What could be more satisfying than this? Liang Weihua’s family of three, on the other hand, remained silent with dark expressions. “There’s no trace of artificial forging on this piece of wood,”elder Tang said with a smile.” Many details show that it’s a pure wild, top – grade Phoebe zhennan material. “For example, the golden threads that appear at the cut surface will appear different when observed from different angles. This kind of shifting effect is usually only seen on cut – Open jinsi nanmu wood. This is only a cut surface, but it has such an effect. This shows that the golden threads of this wood are very sufficient.” He paused and continued,”if it’s Huang Xinnan, it will have the same effect as the golden thread. But no matter from which angle, it’s the same. There’s basically no change, so it’s relatively easy to judge.” Liang Weimin looked like he had been lectured, and then he asked,”Uncle, what if the golden threads on this surface are all artificial? Wei Hua just said that the level of fraud by illegal businesses in the country is getting higher and higher, and almost all of them can pass off fake as real. ” After he finished speaking, Liang Weimin looked at Liang Weihua with a smile. These were almost all Liang Weihua’s original words, and now that Liang Weimin had said it like this, the sarcasm in his words was obvious. Liang Weihua snorted coldly, his face ashen, and he didn’t say anything. “It’s not easy to create the shapeshifting effect!”Elder Tang laughed. In addition to the Golden silk, there were many other ways to judge, such as the texture of the wood. The Golden silk nanmu was much finer than ordinary nanmu wood; In addition, the authentic Phoebe zhennan will exude a very pleasant fragrance, similar to the smell of medicine and fruit, but the smell of Xinan is completely different. It has a fishy smell and is quite unpleasant. ” Then, elder Tang pointed at the Golden Nannan material and said,””And look, I just counted. There are 37 bumps and many cracks on it. If it is cut out, it is likely to form a very good pattern. If we are lucky, it may even form water ripples, which will make the value even higher!” Liang Weimin said with admiration,”uncle, after your explanation, I finally realized that there are so many details to the Phoebe zhennan!” Your eyes are so sharp, you definitely won’t be wrong!” Elder Tang couldn’t be wrong. This meant that the Phoebe zhennan that Liang Weimin and his son had found this time was way better than the one that Liang Weihua and his son had. So, Liang Weimin naturally praised him. He was obviously complimenting himself, but he could still act so self – righteously. It was simply too satisfying! Elder Tang smiled at Xia ruofei and said,””Mr. Xia, I never doubted the authenticity of this Phoebe zhennan material from the beginning, and I’m very sincere in buying it. What do you think? State your price!” Xia ruofei smiled.”Elder Tang, to be honest, you know more about the Phoebe zhennan than I do. So, you can name the price.” Elder Tang gave Xia ruofei a meaningful look and said,””Since Mr. Xia has said so, then I’ll give you a price! If you think it’s too low, we can still discuss it!” Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. “Wei Hua’s piece was bought for eight million Yuan. Mr. Xia, your piece is better than the one I saw before. In terms of diameter, length, and quality, it’s better. I’ll pay ten million Yuan for it!” Elder Tang said after a moment of silence. What do you think of this price?” Liang Weihua’s face twitched when he heard this. The price he had just told the old man was just a fake price. In reality, he had only spent about six million Yuan. He didn’t expect the old man to use it as a reference price. The more valuable this piece of material was, the more credit Liang Weimin and his son would have earned. However, Liang Weihua definitely didn’t want to see this. However, this price was personally set by elder Tang, so he didn’t have the guts to refute it. Liang Weihua suddenly had an idea. Before Xia ruofei could agree, he quickly said,””Uncle, wait a moment!” Elder Tang furrowed his brows slightly as he looked at Liang Weihua and asked,””Wei Hua, are there any other questions?” He was already a little displeased when Liang Weihua had jumped out to question his judgment without any basis, but Liang Weihua had been at his beck and call ever since he had returned to the country. Furthermore, it had indeed taken him a lot of effort to find the Phoebe zhennan, so he did not hold it against Liang Weihua. However, old master Tang saw that he had already explained his reasoning in detail and had already started negotiating the price with Xia ruofei, yet Liang Weihua still came out to stop him. This made old master Tang feel that Liang Weihua was a little insensible. Even Liang Xiaojun looked at his father worriedly, thinking that he was a little reckless. Liang Weihua naturally knew that the old man wouldn’t like it, but he couldn’t care too much about it. He quickly said,””Uncle, I’m not questioning your previous judgment. It’s just that according to the usual practice in our country, the whole piece of Phoebe zhennan material is generally ‘opened’ for sampling when trading. There are so many bumps and cracks on this piece of material. Many bumps not only can not form ripples on the material, but will also destroy the harmony of the whole piece of material. Therefore, if he were to buy it based on his experience, the risk was still very high! If you spend ten million to buy a piece of junk, you’ll suffer a huge loss!” “Open window” was also a term in this industry. It was to use a machine to open a window on wood, and then apply some paint or water to make the pattern appear. In fact,”open the window” was a gamble on luck, mainly to see if there were any beautiful patterns in the raw materials, and whether the patterns could penetrate the wood in a large area. It was similar to stone gambling. Liang Qichao, who had been silent the whole time, couldn’t hold it in anymore when he heard Liang Weihua’s words. He couldn’t help but say sarcastically,”uncle Wei Hua, it seems that the material you bought didn’t have a” open window “either!” Why does RUO Fei have to have another set of standards?”
