“Oh? Please go ahead, old Mr. MA. ” Xia ruofei said with a smile. “Xia Sheng, I heard from Zhiming that ... Your farm has developed a variety of vegetables with very unique tastes and excellent appearances.” MA Xiong said,”we also have a few restaurants in Hong Kong, two of which are Michelin star restaurants. In addition, we have many five – Star hotels around the world, so we also hope that these high – Quality ingredients can appear on the tables of the restaurants and hotels under the Hengfeng group.” “So it’s this matter!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”old Mr. MA, you’re helping the younger generation and taking care of my business. I should be the one thanking you!” “Where? The supply of the best ingredients will definitely be in short supply. ” MA Xiong said seriously,”Zhiming’s eyes are very accurate. I believe that your ingredients will definitely shine in Hengfeng!” “Since old Mr. MA trusts our paradise Corporation so much, I naturally have no reason to reject you. I can agree to this matter right now!” Xia ruofei said with a smile. “That’s great!” MA Xiong said happily,”xiasheng, we’ll discuss the details on the plane to Shen Cheng city. We’re just visiting friends today, let’s not talk about business!” “Hahaha! “Good, good, good ...” Xia ruofei said.”Old master Ma, let’s all stay for lunch!” While you’re at it, you can also try my paradise vegetables!” Professor Tian smiled and said,”in – Law, we must stay!” Xiao Xia’s Peach Garden vegetables, only those who have tasted it know that it’s really indescribable!” “I wouldn’t dare to ask even if it was my wish! In – Law, we’ll stay and disturb Xia Sheng!” MA Xiong laughed and said,”by the way, on the way here, I noticed that xiasheng’s farm is very modern. It seems like you’re interested in making a big splash in this industry!” “It’s just a small matter, so it’s hard for you to take notice of it, old Sir!” Xia ruofei smiled. Everyone began to chat in the living room. In front of his Savior, MA Xiong didn’t put on airs at all. The atmosphere was very relaxed. Knowing that the guests would stay for dinner, Hu Zi’s mother also went to the kitchen early to prepare. Lin Qiao also went in to help sensibly. The ingredients were all ready – made. Xia ruofei would store the ingredients produced in the interspace into the double – door refrigerator in the kitchen from time to time. Hu Zi’s mother only needed to use them directly. Everyone chatted in the living room for a while before Tian Huixin suddenly asked,””Xia, there’s something I want to ask you ... Is it possible to mass – produce the Chinese medicine that you used to treat Huanhuan’s autism?” At this point, Tian Huixin quickly explained,””Don’t misunderstand! We’ve kept the fact that you’ve treated Huanhuan a secret, but I’ve brought her through so many years of suffering and have seen the pain of many families with autistic children. I thought that if this medicine could be mass – produced, it would definitely be a matter of boundless merit!” Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”it’s still difficult for now.” First of all, the cost of the medicine was very high, which was not something that ordinary families could afford. Secondly, one of the main ingredients is very rare, and you might not be able to find it even if you have the money. If you want to mass – produce it, you’ll need to find a substitute herb, which can’t be done in the short term ...” “Oh, I see ...” Tian Huixin was a little disappointed, but she quickly smiled and said,”I was just asking. I really can’t bear to see those autistic children ...” “I understand. In the future, if the conditions allow it, I will focus on the development of drugs to treat autism.” Xia ruofei said with a smile. MA Xiong said,”if you’re poor, you’ll be good to yourself. If you’re good, you’ll be good to the world. What Xia Sheng did was right. We have to be merciful, but we must also do what we can!” Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. He pondered for a moment and said to Tian Huixin,””Ms. Tian, if it’s not a large – scale production, it’s not a big problem to make one or two doses of that Chinese medicine occasionally. If you have a very good friend who needs it, you can come to me, but the quantity should not be too much, and it must be kept absolutely confidential!” Tian Huixin was overjoyed and quickly said,””Alright, alright! Xia, I met a good friend when I took Huanhuan to the rehabilitation training. Her child is also autistic and has epilepsy symptoms, much more serious than Huanhuan ‘s. She bails her face all day, and I feel bad seeing her ...” Xia ruofei said,”how about this?” After a while, you can ask her to bring the child to me. I’ll see how it goes!” “Okay, thank you, thank you!” Tian Huixin said excitedly,”I’ll thank you on behalf of my sister! Don’t worry, I’ll definitely tell her not to tell anyone about this. ” Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. Very soon, it was almost time for dinner. Lu You also brought Huanhuan into the villa. As soon as Huan Huan entered, she shouted happily,””Uncle Xia, uncle Xia ...” At this moment, Lu You gently nudged Huanhuan. Huanhuan turned around and glanced at Lu You. Then, she hesitantly changed her words and said,””Brother ... Xia ... Brother ...” He did not know what method Lu You used to successfully convince Huanhuan. Although she still looked a little reluctant, she had really changed the way she addressed him. Xia ruofei looked at Lu You, who had a smug look on his face, and said in a self – deprecating manner,””Well, after the new year, I’m still a generation younger ...” Professor Tian, MA Xiong, and the others couldn’t help but laugh. Tian Huixin also smiled and said,””Little Xia, why don’t we ... Let Huanhuan call you uncle?” “Little aunt! Why are you siding with an outsider!” Lu You immediately shouted in dissatisfaction. Xia ruofei was only a few years older than her. If he became her elder, she would not be able to accept it. The last time Huanhuan returned to the mainland, everyone was immersed in the ecstasy of hope that Huanhuan’s autism could be cured. Lu You did not realize this problem. It was Xia ruofei who reminded her today. Xia ruofei chuckled.”Okay, okay, okay. Huanhuan, you’ll be like that big sister from now on.” Xia ruofei pointed at Lin Qiao who was coming out of the kitchen with the dishes and said,”You can call me brother RUO Fei like she does!” “En!” Huan Huan nodded and said,”Hello, brother RUO Fei!” Then, Huanhuan took out the red packet that Xia ruofei had given her and said seriously,””Then, brother ruofei ... Should I return this red packet to you? You just said that only the elders give the younger generation New Year’s money ...” Huan Huan’s innocent words made everyone burst into laughter again, especially when she was still holding the red packet tightly. It was obvious that she was not willing to return the red packet that Xia ruofei had given her. Xia ruofei laughed.”No need, no need. An older brother can give his younger sister Red packet money too.” “That’s great! Thank you, brother ruofei!” Huan Huan kept the red packet happily and ran over. She stood on her tiptoes and kissed Xia ruofei on the cheek. Looking at the adorable Huanhuan, Xia ruofei felt as if his heart was about to melt. He also felt that his decision to save Huanhuan the last time was the right one. At this moment, Hu Zi’s mother walked out of the kitchen and said with a smile,””Everyone, come over and eat!” [PS] announcing the VIP Reader group number: 295848872, genuine readers are welcome to join the group (after joining the group, you need to verify the screenshot of the full subscription).
