Chapter 1517: Invulnerable (1)

Translator: 549690339

“Master, I don’t think miss song is being possessed!” Xia Qing said.

Xia ruofei felt as if he had found a life – saving straw and quickly asked,””Xia Qing, do you know what’s going on?”

“According to my judgment, there must be a spirit body that has entered miss song’s body and seized control of her body,” Xia Qing said after a moment of silence.

“Isn’t that a possession?” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but call out anxiously.

“It’s not that easy to take over someone’s body,” Xia Qing said calmly,”moreover, it is impossible for an external spirit body to be completely compatible with a body that doesn’t belong to him. This requires a very long process. From what I see, miss song’s situation is more like her soul is being suppressed.” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Then, Xia Qing changed the topic and said,”of course, the current situation is also very dangerous. We must get rid of that spirit body as soon as possible. Otherwise, miss song’s soul will die sooner or later ...”

Xia ruofei stared at Song Wei, who was lying on the stone bed quietly. He was filled with guilt.

The reason why Song Wei was in such a dangerous situation was because she wanted to accompany him to the underground palace. If he had been by her side to protect her, she might not have fallen into his trap.

He took a deep breath and walked towards the stone room with staggering steps.

The white fox rushed over and bit Xia ruofei’s pants, trying to stop him from moving forward.

Xia Qing also anxiously shouted,”master, you can’t go in!” What’s the difference between going in like this and seeking death?”

“Do you want me to watch Song Wei’s soul get devoured?” Xia ruofei roared.

“You ... You ... At least wait until your body recovers!” He said. Xia Qing sighed and said,”master, you are seriously injured now. Even if you go in, you can’t help miss song.”

Xia ruofei then realized that every inch of his skin was in extreme pain. Song Wei’s two merciless attacks had caused his internal organs to suffer from a violent shock. When he hit the mountain wall, a few of his bones were broken.

If someone else had suffered such a heavy injury, they might have fainted immediately. Only Xia ruofei’s body was as strong as an ox ‘s, so he could hold on.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and knew that Xia Qing’s words were not without reason. He was so weak now that he might not even be able to defeat an ordinary person. If he were to rush in like this, it would indeed be no different from courting death.

He nodded and took out the petals of the spirit Heart Flower from the spirit map space. The recovery speed of the diluted petal solution was too slow. Song Wei’s condition was so critical now, so Xia ruofei naturally would not care about a few petals.

One petal, two petals, three petals ... A total of five petals of the spirit Heart Flower were used.

Xia ruofei’s injuries were also recovering rapidly.

His broken bones were restored one by one, and his internal bleeding organs were also recovering quickly. Some of his other external injuries were also recovering at a speed that could be seen with the naked eye.

The White realmfox, who was watching from the side, was in a daze. It couldn’t help but come closer, its eyes very eager.

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”go, go, go!” You’re not even injured, why are you joining in the fun?”

The White realmfox immediately acted as if it was on the verge of death, as if it would die at any moment.

Xia ruofei was angry and amused at the same time. He was not in the mood to joke with the realm Fox, so he directly carried it up and put it aside. Then, he walked towards the stone room.

The white fox rolled up from the ground and wrinkled its nose at Xia ruofei. It had a look of dissatisfaction on its face, as if it was calling Xia ruofei a miser.

Xia ruofei ignored the Jie Li. He walked towards the stone room without hesitation and said to Xia Qing,””Xia Qing, do you have any suggestions to deal with this kind of spirit body that has taken over other people’s bodies?”

Xia Qing muttered,”master, I don’t have any good ideas. In theory, if you attack miss song’s body, you can also hurt the spirit body. When the body is injured to a certain extent, the spirit body might be forced out ...”

Xia ruofei immediately shook his head and said,”how can that be?” This is Song Wei’s body!”

“Now, miss song’s soul has been suppressed. The one controlling this body is that powerful spirit.” Xia Qing said,”there’s no other way. If your spiritual Power’s realm far exceeds this spirit body, you can directly attack it. But the current situation is that you can’t even break through its surface defense ...”

Xia ruofei nodded.”I understand. I’ll try!”

If he wanted to attack Song Wei’s body, he would have to use a gun. If he used other means, Xia ruofei would definitely not be her match.

Besides, Xia ruofei had a certain level of confidence in his control of the gun. He could basically shoot wherever he pointed to, causing serious damage but not fatal.

More importantly, Xia ruofei still had more than a hundred petals of the spirit Heart Flower. This gave him some confidence. Even if Song Wei was seriously injured, he was confident that he could save her as long as he could get rid of the spirit.

Xia ruofei took out the pistol from the spirit map space and loaded it into the fully loaded magazine. Then, he held it tightly in his hand and stepped into the stone room with gritted teeth.

As soon as Xia ruofei entered the stone room, Song Wei, who had been lying quietly on the stone bed, stood up.

He looked at Xia ruofei coldly, his eyes filled with killing intent.

Song Wei opened her mouth for the first time, and her tone was as cold as an Ice Mountain, “I’ve already let you off just now, and you still dare to come in? It seems like you’re tired of living!”

“The body you’re occupying belongs to my friend,” Xia ruofei grinned.

“So what?” Song Wei said coldly,”it’s her honor to be chosen by me!”

“Rong, your mother!” Xia ruofei suddenly cursed.

Then, he raised his hand without any hesitation and fired a shot without even aiming.

To be honest, Xia ruofei’s heart trembled when he fired the shot. After all, the person standing in front of him was Song Wei. Even though he knew that the soul of a thousand – year – old demon had occupied this body, he still felt weird.

Furthermore, if the shot was not accurate and hit the heart or any other fatal spot, Xia ruofei would not be able to save the situation no matter how capable he was.

This was equivalent to Xia ruofei killing Song Wei.

This kind of pressure could be said to be quite great.

Of course, Xia ruofei’s ability to withstand stress was also very strong. The training of the lone wolf assault team had given him a big heart. So even if he was a little flustered, his hands were still very steady when he fired.

Even though he didn’t aim, the bullet still accurately flew towards Song Wei’s abdomen.

The spirit that had taken over Song Wei’s body had never seen a gun before. She did not even try to Dodge and just looked at Xia ruofei quietly.

She even had some doubts in her heart. What was this person trying to do by holding this black piece of iron to her?

When firing at such a close distance, the bullet would reach the target almost instantly.

No matter how fast a person’s reaction was, it would be very difficult to avoid it, not to mention that this spirit body was still in a daze.

The bullet hit song Wei’s abdomen accurately.

Her body trembled as she revealed a look of disbelief. She stared at Xia ruofei and slowly reached out to cover her stomach.

Xia ruofei’s spirit was lifted. The moment he entered the stone room, the other party did not make a move, giving him the chance to shoot. He did not expect to injure the other party so easily.

However, a scene that made Xia ruofei’s jaw drop appeared.

The spirit that controlled Song Wei’s body slowly raised her hand. Her thumb and index finger held a bullet that was still stained with blood. She held it in front of her eyes and observed it.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be shocked. He knew very well that if anyone was shot at such a close distance, the bullet would definitely go into the abdomen. The high – speed rotating bullet would even cause great damage to the internal organs.

However, the scene in front of him clearly showed that the bullet had only penetrated the surface of his body before it was quickly stopped.

Could it be that this spirit body could block bullets with its physical body? Xia ruofei could not help but feel a sense of despair.

If a pistol was useless, then he had no way to deal with this powerful spirit body.

Ding! Ding! The spirit body threw the copper bullet on the ground and slowly turned its head to look at Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei noticed that the wound on her abdomen was very small and there was not much bleeding. It had completely stopped.

This meant that the shot just now did not cause her any substantial harm.

Xia ruofei looked at the spirit body alertly, wary of her sudden attack. At the same time, his mind was spinning quickly, trying to think of a solution.

Unless he shot her in the head, Xia ruofei would not dare to do so. Even if he could expel the spirit, Song Wei would be dead.

Just as Xia ruofei was thinking of a plan, the spirit body moved.

Xia ruofei felt a beam of white light shooting towards him. Without thinking, he quickly retreated. At the same time, he raised his hand and fired a shot in the direction of the white light.

The spirit body was prepared this time. It changed its direction easily. Song Wei’s body drew a beautiful arc and dodged the shot easily. She did not slow down and continued to pounce on Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei was in a hurry. He could only run the great Dao technique like crazy. Genuine Qi poured into his palm. He gritted his teeth and met the attack.

With a loud bang, Xia ruofei’s figure was sent flying. Just like before, he was sent flying and hit the stone wall again.

Xia ruofei vomited a mouthful of blood, and his spirit suddenly weakened.

Motherf * cker! A few more bones were broken! Xia ruofei cursed in his heart.

“Master! Quickly run!” Xia Qing madly roared.

“I can’t leave!” Xia ruofei gritted his teeth and stood up.”Song Wei will be finished if I leave!”

The spiritual body that was controlling Song Wei’s body did not attack immediately. She felt that Xia ruofei’s true Qi was a little strange and could not help but look at Xia ruofei deeply.

However, that little fear was quickly thrown to the back of her mind. Even if the cultivation technique seemed to be able to restrain her, Xia ruofei’s cultivation was too weak. This absolute difference in cultivation level could not be made up for.

Hence, she only hesitated for a moment before she flew towards Xia ruofei with a cold murderous intent.

Xia ruofei’s eyes were filled with madness. He used all his strength to run the great Dao technique. The genuine Qi in his body flowed rapidly in his meridians. The originally calm river suddenly became a Roaring River, and countless genuine Qi gushed through it.

At the same time, an idea came to Xia ruofei’s mind. He quickly gathered all the essential Qi in his body and kept the gun in the medium. At the same time, he took out the eight array flags that he had just obtained from the cave ...
