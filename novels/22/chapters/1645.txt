Chapter 1646: The netherworld’s treasured land (2)

Liu haofan couldn’t help but feel dejected.

Even the director of the Huaxia mystical society was helpless. No matter how powerful his background was or how wide his connections were, it would be difficult to find a Feng Shui Master better than Shen Zhongliang.

“Then what do we do?” Liu haofan muttered to himself.

Shen Zhongliang hesitated for a moment before saying,”Liu, this land is actually very suitable for building a Cemetery ...”

Zhou Tianyu immediately said,”that’s impossible. Cemeteries are planned and built by the government. The use of the land can’t be changed at will.” Even if all these can be coordinated, the resort Villas nearby won’t be willing to build a Cemetery here!”

Even if they had all the abilities in the world, it was impossible for them to settle so many things.

This piece of land was part of the construction plan of the whole town. Once it was turned into a Cemetery, the surrounding land could not be developed, and the hot spring resort not far away would definitely not accept it.

This would involve too many people.

Shen Zhongliang naturally didn’t know much about these things. After hearing Zhou Tianyu’s words, he smiled bitterly and said,””Then there’s only one way left. While the outside world is still unclear about the problem with this land, you can sell it as soon as possible and reduce some losses ...”

Actually, if this so – called “Yin gathering place” was not set up by Xia ruofei and could be reversed at any time, then Shen Zhongliang’s suggestion was a little unkind. To the person who would take over later on, this idea was too bad.

However, Shen Zhongliang had taken the remuneration from the company and had a relationship with Liu haofan. It was not wrong for him to make such a suggestion from the perspective of the company.

In fact, from the perspective of Liu haofan and the Tang real estate, this was the only way to reduce losses.

Zhou Tianyu thought about it and said,”young master Liu, since old Shen said so, then we have to seriously consider selling this land!”

Liu haofan nodded and said,”then find a way to get rid of it!” But before that, we have to calm the public opinion. Otherwise, even if someone is willing to take over, they will definitely lower the price!”

“Then I’ll have to trouble young master Liu to personally handle this matter!” Zhou Tianyu said,”I will also report to the company and try to come up with a Constitution that everyone can accept as soon as possible ...”

Zhou Tianyu’s words were more obscure, but what he meant was that if he wanted to sell the land at its original price, it would be a fool’s dream. After all, the price was already unreasonably high, and now there was negative news, so losses were inevitable. At first, this project was jointly funded by the two companies, and by right, if there were losses, the two families should bear it together. However, Zhou Tianyu’s words meant that the losses would be borne by Tang real estate, and Liu haofan didn’t need to pay for it.

Liu haofan was, after all, a child from a large family clan, so he naturally understood the meaning behind these words. He smiled and said,””Leave the crisis public relations to me!”

Although he didn’t pay much for the investment, he didn’t have much money to invest. The shares he owned were much higher than the investment ratio. Whether it was the shares or the investment ratio, it was all real money. It was naturally best if he didn’t lose anything.

As for selling his face and using his connections, Liu haofan didn’t care. After all, he relied on these to make a living!

There was nothing much to see on this piece of land, and it felt like staying in a Cemetery, which made people feel uncomfortable. So the group quickly got on the car and left.

Out of respect for the two Feng Shui masters, Liu haofan asked the driver to send the two elders to the Huaxia mystical society first. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

After the car stopped, Zhou Tianyu took out two checks from his pocket and handed them over. He said,””I’ll have to trouble the two masters today. This is a small gift from our company ...”

“CEO Zhou, we won’t take the money ...” Shen Zhongliang declined.

“How can we do that! If not for the two masters, we would still be in the dark!” Zhou Tianyu said,”you must accept this money!”

He had already hated the three cultural environment consultants in the company. When he had time, the first thing he would do was to kick them out of the company. However, a big company like Tang real estate had a lot of such talents. If the incident in Xiaotang town happened again, it would be a big loss. So, it was better to make friends with Feng Shui masters like Shen Zhongliang and du Qinghong, who had a certain status in the field of metaphysics.

Although it was a little difficult to hire Shen Zhongliang and du Qinghong directly, it would be good if they could introduce a few reliable Fengshui Masters to them.

Shen Zhongliang and du Qinghong declined it and accepted it.

On the other hand, Liu haofan started to use all his connections to clear the name of the haunted construction site in Xiaotang town. Zhou Tianyu also reported to the company’s higher – ups immediately.

Tang real estate soon unified their thinking. Even if it was a loss – making sale, they had to sell the land as soon as possible. As for the loss of money, it would be borne by the company.

This project was not big to begin with, and this small loss was nothing to the company.

Moreover, their cooperation with Liu haofan was also to get on the Liu family’s good side, so they naturally wouldn’t be calculative about money. Otherwise, if Liu haofan lost money and still held a grudge against the Tang real estate company, wouldn’t that be counterproductive?

The resourceful Zhao Yongjun also received the news.

Although he didn’t know the details, only Liu haofan, Zhou Tianyu, Shen Zhongliang, du Qinghong, and Zhou Tianyu’s trusted driver were present. Liu haofan had hired an expert from the Huaxia mystical society to break the situation, and Zhao Yongjun had found out immediately.

After Liu haofan and the others went to the construction site, they began to clean up the negative public opinion. Even Tang real estate began to spread the news that they intended to give up the land. How could Zhao Yongjun not understand?

Even the Masters of the Huaxia mystical society couldn’t solve this problem.

He gave Xia ruofei a call immediately.

“RUO Fei, you’re really a God!” Zhao Yongjun said excitedly as soon as the call connected,”now, the Tang side has the intention to transfer that land!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”brother Zhao, isn’t this expected?” Why are you so excited?”

“Hehe ...” Zhao Yongjun chuckled.”You don’t know how worried I was when Liu haofan asked a Feng Shui Master from the Huaxia mystical society to go over!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”brother Zhao, are you worried that my array will be broken by the Feng Shui Master?” Don’t you have too little confidence in me?”

Zhao Yongjun smiled awkwardly and said,””It’s big brother’s fault! I should have known. When has RUO Fei ever made a mistake? Today, Liu haofan and Zhou Tianyu took two Feng Shui masters to the construction site. After they came back, there was news that they were interested in giving up that piece of land!”

Xia ruofei knew that the two Feng Shui masters had no way to break the natural array, but he was also curious if people from the metaphysics world could see the existence of the natural array, so he couldn’t help but ask for the details. Unfortunately, Zhao Yongjun didn’t know much.

“Big brother Zhao, let’s not rush into contact with the Tang Empire.” Xia ruofei said,”we have the upper hand now!”

Zhao Yongjun hesitated and said,””Ruofei, after the great Tang released the news, there are still a few companies interested in this land. They might be trying to take advantage of it!”

Xia ruofei laughed.”These people are not stupid. Before they decide to make a move, they will definitely go to the land to inspect it. Liu haofan can’t just wash away the rumors of the haunting!”

Xia ruofei paused and continued,””Even if other companies get there before us, they won’t be able to keep the land. As long as the array is not cracked, the haunting will not end. By then, they’ll have to hand it over!”
