Chapter 1113: The magical jade pendant (2)

Translator: 549690339

As soon as song Rui finished speaking, elder song and song Zhilan immediately realized this problem. Their faces suddenly revealed an extremely surprised look.

Elder song and his daughter were so excited by the Jade Guanyin that they didn’t realize that Xia ruofei had made this special gift. However, song Rui, who was usually carefree, immediately found the key to the problem.

Xia ruofei saw the three of them looking at him eagerly, so he didn’t hide anything. He smiled and said,””I did have some special encounters. I made this Jade Guanyin by myself, but ... It takes a lot of effort to make this kind of magic artifact, so I can only make one or two occasionally.”

Since elder song and the others called the Jade Guanyin a magical weapon, Xia ruofei might as well call Qianqian that. If he were to talk about the spirit gathering talisman, elder song and the others would definitely be more confused.

Although they had already guessed it, they still couldn’t help but take a deep breath when they heard Xia ruofei’s confirmation.

“Ruofei,” song Rui cried out subconsciously,”you actually have such an ability ... No, no, you have to give me one too!”

As soon as song Rui finished speaking, elder song’s face darkened and he said,””Nonsense! Do you think magic tools are like cabbages? Didn’t you hear what RUO Fei said just now? making magic tools is very taxing on the mind!”

Song Rui shrank his neck in embarrassment and said,””Hehe ... I was just excited ... Just excited ...”

Seeing this, Xia ruofei smiled. He reached into his pocket and took out a Jade Leaf. Of course, he was actually taking it out from his space.

“I definitely don’t have any more of the Jade Guanyin that I gave to the chief.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you can play with this little thing!”

“Little Xia, you can’t do that!” Elder song hurriedly said,”this magical artifact is too valuable. I really need this Jade Guanyin, so I’ll be thick – skinned and accept it. We definitely can’t accept the rest ...”

Elder song was very clear about the rarity and value of magical weapons. Taking Xia ruofei’s Jade Guanyin was already too much for him. Why would he take this Jade Leaf?

Song Rui looked at the Jade Leaf in Xia ruofei’s hand with a fervent gaze. He wanted to take it immediately. However, elder song’s influence in the family had been cultivated all year round. He was a man of his word. Since he had said so, even if song Rui wanted it, he did not dare to give it to him.

Xia ruofei smiled.”Sir, song Rui and I are brothers. We’re good friends. It’s nothing to give him a small gift.”

Xia ruofei had sculpted seven pieces of jade leaves from the corners of the glass – Type jade. He had originally planned to give them to his close elders and friends. Song Rui was naturally one of the gifts.

Moreover, song Rui was the eldest son and grandson of the rich and powerful song family. His identity was very sensitive. Although the song family must have their own security measures, it was hard to guarantee that there would not be any loopholes. As the saying goes, one slip could make one mistake. If there was an accident, this protective jade talisman could ensure song Rui’s safety.

After Xia ruofei finished speaking, he stuffed the Jade amulet into song Rui’s hands and smiled.””Didn’t you make a lot of noise just now? Why don’t you dare to take it? Quickly take it!”

“Well ... Grandpa didn’t allow me to take it,” song Rui said with a chuckle.

“Since Xiao Xia gave it to you, just take it!” Elder song said, a little annoyed.

Although elder song’s tone was a little stiff, the joy in his eyes could not be concealed. The Jade Leaf was not as precious as the Jade Guanyin, but it was still a magic tool! It was such a great fortune for song Rui to obtain a magical weapon!

After all, many of the big shots didn’t even have magic weapons!

Song Rui was overjoyed. He quickly held the Jade Leaf tightly in his hand and asked impatiently,””RUO Fei, this ... Does it also need to be bound by blood?”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”drip your blood on it and wear it.” However, the effect of this Jade Leaf is different from the chief’s Jade Guanyin. It’s a protective jade talisman that can ensure your safety ...”

When song Rui heard that it was an amulet, he couldn’t help but feel a little disappointed. He thought that it was something that Daoist priests drew on amulet paper on TV. He felt that it was too idealistic. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

After all, the effect of elder song’s Jade Guanyin was obvious.

“It ... How can it be safe?” Song Rui asked.

“You’ll know when it’s used,” Xia ruofei said with a smile.”But ... I hope this jade amulet will never be used ...”

When Xia ruofei said that it was a protective jade talisman, elder song’s eyes could not help but shine. He suddenly thought of the incident he had experienced in his early years. In such a tragic car accident, the leader who was wearing a magical bracelet was unscathed.

Although the magic bracelet lost its luster and its effect after the incident, it was still extremely precious even if it was a one – time use.

Seeing that song Rui was still confused, elder song couldn’t help but Pat the back of his head and said,””Quickly thank little Xia! To be able to obtain such a precious protective magic tool, how great of an opportunity is that!”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”No need, no need. Song Rui and I are like brothers. You don’t have to be so polite!” Song Rui, you’d better hurry up and claim ownership with your blood! Remember to always wear it and never take it off!”

Elder song glared at song Rui and said,””You must remember what RUO Fei says, understand?”

“Yes, yes, yes ...” Song Rui quickly replied.

With Xia ruofei’s help, song Rui quickly performed the blood ownership claim on the Jade Leaf.

After recognizing him as its master, he immediately felt a connection with this Jade Leaf. At the same time, he also felt very close to it.

Song Rui knew that it must be something good. He grinned at Xia ruofei and said,””Good brother, you’re a good friend! Thanks!”

Song Zhilan found two red headbands and helped elder song and song Rui hang the two jade pendants, one big and one small, close to their bodies.

When song Zhilan was hanging the Jade Leaf for song Rui, her eyes revealed a deep envy.

Of course, she wanted this magical weapon, but she was not that close to Xia ruofei. Besides, she had doubted Xia ruofei before, so how could she ask for it now?

Moreover, Xia ruofei had already given the song family two magical weapons. Song Zhilan knew that if she really asked for it, her father would scold her before Xia ruofei could even say anything.

Of course, Xia ruofei saw song Zhilan’s eager eyes. He just pretended not to see Qianqian. He wasn’t a money – giving child. He would only give something as good as the Jade talisman to the people closest to him.

Elder song touched the Jade Guanyin on his body and looked at Xia ruofei. He said meaningfully,””Little Xia, it seems like you’ve had an extraordinary encounter ...”

Xia ruofei smiled.”I won’t hide it from you, chief. The inheritance of making magical weapons and my medical skills are all from the same family.”

Xia ruofei then said seriously,””Chief, no matter how capable I am, I’m still Xia ruofei, who was trained by the Chinese army. I won’t do anything that will harm the country and society!” 1

Elder song looked into Xia ruofei’s eyes, and Xia ruofei did not avoid his gaze at all. His eyes were clear and looked straight into elder song ‘s.

After a few seconds, a smile slowly appeared on eccentric song’s face. He nodded and said,”Very good, I’m relieved to hear you say that ...”

Then, elder song’s gaze turned to song Zhilan and song Rui. He said with a serious expression,””Zhilan, Xiao Rui, you must keep your mouth shut about what happened tonight. You can’t even reveal a word to the people closest to you! If I hear even the slightest bit of wind, I’ll hold you responsible! Do you understand?”

Eccentric song’s tone was very strict, and his eyes were also very stern. Song Zhilan and song Rui couldn’t help but feel a chill in their hearts. The two of them quickly and respectfully nodded and replied,”Yes!”
