Chapter 1118: A busy morning (1)

Translator: 549690339

At five in the morning, Xia ruofei woke up on time. He sat cross – legged in front of the window and began to cultivate.

It was FiveO’ clock in the morning and the city was slowly waking up. People selling breakfast, vegetables, and morning shifts were all on the streets. However, Xia ruofei’s room was on the top floor, so it was still very quiet.

He silently circulated the great Dao chant, and the natural energy that was much denser than before quickly gathered and entered his meridians through the Baihui point on the top of his head. After a full circulation, the genuine Qi in his body had also increased a little.

The “great Dao scroll” was already a top – tier technique. If there were other cultivators on earth, they would be extremely envious of Xia ruofei’s current cultivation speed.

However, in Xia ruofei’s eyes, this improvement was too slow.

However, he had no choice. If he cultivated in the spirit map space and absorbed a large amount of spiritual Qi for a long time, it would easily damage the foundation of the spirit map space. Xia ruofei would definitely not do such a thing that the gains did not make up for the losses.

He could only work hard to find more world stones. As long as the spirit map space evolved further and the spirit Qi became denser, the spirit Qi He needed at this stage would not damage the foundation of the space. This way, he could cultivate in the space for a longer time. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“It seems like I have to find time to contact Song Wei,” Xia ruofei thought.

He was still thinking about the ancient tomb that Song Wei and the others had excavated. If he was not wrong, there would definitely be a world stone inside.

This thought only flashed in his mind for a moment. Very quickly, Xia ruofei devoted himself to cultivation.

After about an hour of cultivation, Xia ruofei frowned and woke up from his meditative state.

This was because he had sensed someone knocking on the door with a trace of his spiritual will.

Xia ruofei used his spiritual power to look outside and found out that it was song Rui. He could not help but smile bitterly. It was only six in the morning and this guy with two panda eyes was already knocking on the door. Did he not need to sleep?

Xia ruofei shook his head helplessly as he got up to open the door.

He deliberately took his time to walk over. When he opened the door, he rubbed his eyes and asked with a dissatisfied look,””Kid, can’t you just let me sleep?”

“Ruofei, I couldn’t sleep the whole night. That ... Have you thought of a way?” song Rui said with a big smile.

Xia ruofei snorted.”I was about to figure it out. But you woke me up from my sleep. I forgot about it.”

“Do you think I’ll think of a way while you’re busy in your dream?” Song Rui blurted out.

“What?” Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows.

“No, no, no...” Song Rui quickly smiled apologetically.”You’re my brother, okay?!” It’s all my fault ... Then, what can I do for you to help me?”

Xia ruofei yawned and said,”we’ll have to see if I can get a good night’s sleep ...”

“Alright, alright ... You can continue to rest. I ... I’m going back to my room ...” Song Rui said with a bitter face.

Xia ruofei immediately took a step back and closed the door.

Song Rui stood outside the door and shouted,”Hey!” You’re really ... Forget it, I’ll bear with it! Who asked me to ask you for a favor?”

Song Rui muttered to himself as he walked back with a bitter expression.

After Xia ruofei’s cultivation was interrupted by song Rui, he saw that there was less than an hour left before Seveno’ clock. He decided to stop cultivating and really threw himself onto the bed to catch up on sleep.

A practitioner like Xia ruofei would not have mental problems. Furthermore, he had developed a habit after years in the Army. No matter what the environment was like, he could fall asleep as soon as possible. This was the only way to maintain his best condition in the harsh battlefield.

Hence, Xia ruofei fell into a deep sleep in no time.

However, this morning was destined to be a restless one. Xia ruofei felt that he had only fallen asleep for a short while before he was woken up by another knock on the door.

He rubbed his sleepy eyes and glanced at the clock on the wall. It was about Seveno’ clock, and he had only slept for about an hour.

“Who is it?” Xia ruofei couldn’t be bothered to use his spiritual power to check. He complained to himself as he walked to the door in his slippers.

Xia ruofei opened the door and saw song Rui’s face. He could not help but stare.

Before Xia ruofei could speak, song Rui waved his hand and said,””Ruofei, don’t be agitated, don’t be agitated ... I’m not the one looking for you ...”

Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows. He was still confused when he saw a person appear behind song Rui and look at him with a faint smile.

“Lu You?” Xia ruofei’s mouth was wide open.”Why did you come here so early in the morning?”

“It’s not easy to find a place where director Xia lives!” Lu You said with a faint smile on her face.

“Lu You called me to ask where you were staying, so I brought her here ...” Song Rui laughed dryly.

It turned out that Lu You did not know which hotel Xia ruofei was staying at. However, she knew that song Rui was most likely with Xia ruofei, so she gave song Rui a call directly. Then, song Rui brought Lu You to Xia ruofei’s room.

“Is there something you need?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

Lu You glanced at Xia ruofei and said,””Are we just going to talk in the corridor? Aren’t you going to invite me in?”

“Oh! Please come in, please come in!” Xia ruofei finally came back to his senses. He quickly stepped aside and made an inviting gesture.

Song Rui smiled.”Ruofei, I won’t disturb you anymore. Don’t forget about me!”
