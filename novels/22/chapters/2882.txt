2883 Night and Star Journey (1)

After the simple celebration, Xia ruofei asked everyone to go back to their rooms to rest. He was tired from his breakthrough today, so even though he had not slept with Song Wei or Ling Qingxue for a long time, he decided to wait until tomorrow to adjust his condition.

If he didn’t perform well in bed, it would be embarrassing. Although the possibility of such a situation happening was very low for a cultivator, Song Wei and Ling Qingxue were also cultivators! In terms of endurance, the two of them were naturally much stronger than ordinary girls.

The next morning, after eating Zheng Yongshou’s carefully prepared breakfast, Xia ruofei called Li Yifu to his room.

Ever since he met Li Yifu, Xia ruofei had been very satisfied with his performance. This old man respected him from the bottom of his heart and treated him as an elder of his sect. He had done everything he asked him to do beautifully and had never let Xia ruofei down.

Xia ruofei had no doubts about Li Yifu’s loyalty.

Besides, last night in the spirit map space, after that spiritual will of perfected mountain river personally confirmed that li beihuai was his in – Name disciple, Xia ruofei naturally felt closer to Li Yifu.

As soon as Li Yifu entered the door, he bowed respectfully to Xia ruofei and said,””Good Morning, senior granduncle!”

Xia ruofei smiled gently and pointed at the sofa beside him.””Adopted husband, come over and sit down to talk!”

“Thank you, grand uncle – Master!” Li Yifu said, then walked to the sofa next to Xia ruofei and sat down. Although he said he was sitting, he was actually sitting next to half of his butt. He kept his back straight in front of Xia ruofei. Whether there were outsiders or not, he would always maintain sufficient etiquette.

Xia ruofei glanced at Li Yifu and said helplessly,””Foster husband, relax! I’m asking you to sit, not do the horse stance!” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Yes!” Li Yifu adjusted his sitting position slightly, but he still maintained a straight posture.

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly and shook his head. He stopped correcting Li Yifu’s sitting posture and asked affectionately,””How’s the situation on the island? Tell me about it!”

“Yes! Senior granduncle!” “Yes,” Li Yifu said.”I’ve followed your instructions and set up all the locations where the arrays are placed as forbidden zones. I’ve also installed barbed wire fences and hung eye – catching warning signs. In addition, during the time when martial granduncle was away, everything was normal on the island. There were no accidents. ”

“That’s good. ” “Did you manage to contact the seller of the list of weapons and equipment that I sent you last time?” Xia ruofei continued.

After Xia ruofei and the old company commander confirmed the equipment of the guards, they sent the list to Li Yifu and asked him to purchase it.

Li Yifu quickly said,”grand uncle – Master, I’ve already made an order with the black – Market arms dealer in Mexico through the Hong sect. The list is all common American Standard equipment. It’s not difficult for big arms dealers to prepare. The goods should be ready soon.”

Xia ruofei asked curiously,”from Mexico?” I see that the list is full of U.S. Military equipment!”

Li Yifu smiled and said,”you may not know this, uncle – Master, but although the United States allows guns, its gun control is relatively strict. In addition, it’s more convenient to order such a large number of weapons and equipment Mexico. Although those black – Market arms dealers charge higher prices, they have their own channels to get bulk goods from the US military’s suppliers. Also, the United States and Mexico border, so it’s very convenient to smuggle arms. In addition, the demand in Mexico’s market is also relatively large! There are big and small drug lords there, and they are all important customers of these black market arms dealers, so it’s more convenient to get the goods from Mexico!”

“I understand,” Xia ruofei nodded.

“Also,” Li Yifu added,”according to their rules, they’re only responsible for transporting the arms to the ship in the Mexico of Mexico. They have nothing to do with the rest of the matter ...”

“Is it difficult for us to retrieve the goods?” Xia ruofei asked.

“The Hong sect also controls a shipping company in Mexico. It’s not a problem to board the ship from Mexico.” Li Yifu said,”now, we have to decide where to hand over the goods as soon as possible so that the freighter of the Hong sect can plan the route.”

Xia ruofei nodded. He knew that the Freemasonry’s shipping company would not just help them transport a batch of firearms. Xia ruofei had bought the firearms to equip about a hundred guards. They would not use an ocean – going cargo ship to transport the firearms over. Moreover, the cargo ship would definitely need to carry some goods to cover up their tracks. As long as they entered the International waters, there would be no problem.

“They’re probably looking for a freighter that will pass through the South Pacific Ocean to help us, right?” Xia ruofei asked.

“Yes, I am!” Li Yifu said,”the freighter has already docked. In fact, the goods have already been loaded and can set off at any time. We’re just waiting for the batch of arms we bought to board the ship. I just contacted him yesterday, and it should be within the next two days. ”

“Sailing from the Mexico of Mexico to here should take a long time, right?” Xia ruofei asked.

“If there’s no delay, it’ll take at least a month.” Li Yifu asked uneasily,”senior granduncle, are you a little delayed?”
