Chapter 1921 Remote command (1)

When the WeChat notification rang, Liu Dong quickly unlocked his phone and saw a message from justice is not absent. Destination: the West Lake Mansion. The security there is very tight. I hope you can find a way to enter the community before you arrive. Good luck!

“Da, he just sent the address over. It’s the West Lake Mansion!” Liu Dong said through gritted teeth.

Da Liu immediately said to his subordinate who was driving,””Go to the West Lake Mansion. Hurry up!”

“Yes! Da!”

Liu Dong handed the phone to Da Liu with a worried expression and said,””Xiao da, he said that the West Lake Mansion’s security is quite strict. How are we supposed to get in with so many people?”

“Let’s drive in!”Da Liu said casually. A few security guards wouldn’t dare to stop us!”

“Da, we can’t force our way in,” Liu Dong said.”If we make too much noise and alert Chen...Fang Chenchen and that man, we won’t be able to catch them in the act!”

Da Liu frowned and said,””I’ll think of a way ...”

Liu Dong nodded. Seeing that Da Liu was thinking about how to get into the community, he did not dare to disturb him.

After a long while, Da Liu slapped his thigh and said,””How could I have forgotten about him!”

“Have you thought of a solution?” Liu Dong asked quickly.

“En!” Da Liu nodded and said,”I’ll try to make a call first!”

After saying that, he took out his phone and searched through his address book for a while before he found a number and dialed it.

“Hello? Strong! I’m Da Liu!” Da Liu asked casually,”there’s something I want to ask you for help with!”

On the other end of the phone, a forthright male voice said,”Brother da, if you have something to say, say it!”

“Are you at home now?” Da Liu asked.

“He’s here!” Da Qiang replied,”I just came back from the company!”

“Is it the house at the West Lake Mansion?” Da Liu asked again.

Da Qiang couldn’t help but smile and said,”how many homes can I have?” Wasn’t that the West Lake Mansion? I say, brother da, don’t tell me you’re here to have a drink with your brother! No problem, I’m free today, let’s get drunk!”

Da Qiang opened a printing company in San Shan. The business wasn’t particularly big, but it was considered well – off. He was a forthright person by nature, and he met Da Liu at a dinner party. The two of them hit it off at first sight and had a good chat.

Later, da Qiang’s company was extorted by a few gangsters, and Da Liu helped to solve the problem. Therefore, he was very grateful to Da Liu.

Of course, one of them was a proper businessman, and the other was a gangster who wandered in the gray area. They were not the same side of the road, so they did not contact each other often. Occasionally, they would meet up for a drink, and it felt like they were friends of gentlemen.

Da Liu smiled and said,”I’m really not free today. I’ll treat you next time!” Da Qiang, I just want to ask you for a small favor ...”

“Just say it. As long as it’s within my means, I’ll definitely do it!” Da Qiang said straightforwardly.

Da Liu said,”I have to go to the West Lake Mansion to do something, but I heard that the security is quite strict there. I think ... I will tell the security guard at the door that I went to look for you. They will definitely call you to verify it. Then, you can help to verify it!”

“I see ...” Da Qiang pondered for a moment and said,”no problem!”

“Don’t worry,” Da Liu said again.”I’m not going into the community to kill or set fire. It’s just that one of my brothers encountered something, and he wants to find one of the owners here to judge!”

Da Qiang laughed and said,”even if you’re here to commit murder and arson, I’m not afraid of being implicated. Anyway, when they asked me, I’ll insist that you did tell me that you were here to drink with me. But you didn’t come after we entered the community. I can’t do anything about it!”

Da Liu couldn’t help but laugh when he heard this. “That’s right! You just said that! This has nothing to do with you!”

The two chatted for a while, and the gate of the West Lake Mansion was already in sight. Da Liu hung up the phone and turned to Liu Dong.”Done!”

In the rental house opposite the West Lake Mansion, Xu Yougang had been monitoring the situation on Liu Dong’s side. When he heard that Da Liu had successfully solved the problem of entering the community, he immediately picked up the walkie – talkie and said,””They’ll be back soon. Are you guys in position?”

“Cave four, in position!”

“Dong Liang, get into position!”

“Cave three, in position!”

The voices of Wang Chong’s group of three sounded from the walkie – talkie.

“Brothers!” Xu Yougang said into the walkie – talkie,”it’s time for the final battle. Whether you succeed or fail, it’s up to you!”

“Understood!” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Class monitor, don’t worry! Our tough Bones 3rd company’s soldiers never drop the ball at critical times!”

Xu Yougang smiled and said,””Everyone, maintain communication. Act according to the plan!”

……

The Jinbei car slowly stopped in front of the parking pole at the main entrance of the West Lake Mansion.

Seeing that it was not a car from the community, a security guard immediately walked over.

Da Liu stuck his head out of the window and said with a smile,””We’re looking for Chen Xinqiang, unit 1202, Block 1. ”

“Wait a moment!” The security guard said. Then, he picked up the walkie – talkie and said,”confirm with the owner of Room 1202 if there are any visitors. The car plate number is Triple A ...”

“Alright!” The security guard’s walkie – talkie rang and a voice came out.

Da Liu saw that another security guard in the security room at the door had picked up the phone and was contacting someone. He leaned back in his chair and waited quietly.

Liu Dong, on the other hand, had mixed feelings. On one hand, he was a little nervous as he did not know if they could successfully enter the community. On the other hand, there seemed to be a fire burning in his heart. As long as he thought of his wife having sex with another man in an apartment in this community, he had an impulse to destroy himself.
