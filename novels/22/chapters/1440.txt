Chapter 1441: What a coincidence (2)

Translator: 549690339

She felt a little regretful. Although the reporter of this report had captured the scene at that time, he had not been able to confirm the identity of the young man. At the end of the report, the reporter even asked the netizens, hoping that they would use their sharp eyes to find the young man and vigorously promote such positive energy.

Dong Yun scrolled to the end of the page and looked at the comments.

Most of the comments were full of praise. Some said that the young man was agile, some praised his subconscious reaction to see a good cause. In short, almost all of them were positive comments.

There were also a small number of netizens who questioned the management of the store. In fact, as long as the waiters and janitors cooperated with each other, the accident could have been completely avoided.

After all, the grilled fish in the stone pot was very hot, which meant that the restaurant didn’t emphasize too much on the staff’s sense of danger, and the waiters were a little clumsy.

While Dong Yun was browsing through the comments section in fear, a comment suddenly caught her attention.

“Why does this back look so familiar? Let’s compare the photos of the peach blossom company’s Annual Meeting that were circulated two days ago. Doesn’t he look like CEO Xia of the company?”

In this comment, there were also many netizens who expressed their opinions.

“It can’t be such a coincidence! Isn’t President Xia too much of a showstopper these few days?”

“I think so too. What do you think about the situation downstairs?”

“Upstairs, there must be something strange about this ...”

......

Dong Yun couldn’t find the exact answer in everyone’s comments, so she simply followed the clues and found the post about Tao Yuan company’s annual party that was very popular on Weibo and forums a few days ago.

The photo of Xia ruofei fishing for money was very eye – catching and had been mentioned many times. Dong Yun found the photo easily.

However, the photo taken at the annual meeting was taken from a glass room away and it was a side view of Xia ruofei.

Yuan Xin’s video was taken from behind. Other than the moment when Xia ruofei stepped out to catch the stone pot, the rest of the video was taken from behind the camera.

Dong Yun compared it for a while, but the video was not very clear, and the quality of the photos of the annual meeting was not very high. She felt that there was a little similarity, but like the netizens, she was not sure.

Dong Yun was full of questions. When it was time for dinner in the evening, she couldn’t help but ask Zheng Shuying,”Mom, do you know the name of the young man who saved you?”

Zheng Shuying said with a regretful expression,””I didn’t even have the time to ask for his name! I was scared at first, but I only came back to my senses after I applied the medicine. However, the two young men left very quickly ...”

“Oh ...” Dong Yun was a little disappointed.

“But I seem to remember that his female companion called him by his name. It’s ... Something Fei?” Zheng Shuying suddenly said.

“RUO Fei?” Dong Yun quickly asked. Xia ruofei?”

Zheng Shuying scratched her head and smiled bitterly.””My mind was in a mess back then, I really can’t remember anything ... Little Yun, why are you asking this?”

“I think ... Since he sacrificed himself to save others, we should at least express our gratitude!” Dong Yun said.

“That’s right!” Zheng Shuying immediately said,”then ... I’ll try to recall it?”

At this moment, an idea suddenly came to Dong Yun’s mind.

Compared to the netizens ‘various speculations and analysis, there was no need for her to give up what was near and seek what was far! The person involved was right in front of him! Why did he have to use that blurry Annual Meeting photo as a comparison?

At this thought, Dong Yun immediately took out her phone and searched for Xia ruofei’s photo on the internet.

One had to admit that the internet had greatly reduced the space for personal privacy, especially for Xia ruofei, who was considered half a public figure. Although he deliberately kept a low profile, there were still many photos circulating on the internet, including photos of him attending the press conference. Many of them were clear frontal photos from professional media reporters.

Dong Yun found a close – up photo and handed the phone to Zheng Shuying, asking,”Mom, take a good look. Is it him?”

Zheng Shuying only took a glance and immediately said,””That’s right! Little Yun, this is the young man who saved me today!”

“You ... Are you sure? Don’t you need to think about it?” Dong Yun asked,”didn’t you say that your mind was in a mess?”

“It can’t be wrong. This young man’s eyes are very special. It’s the kind of eyes that people can’t forget after one look.” Zheng Shuying said,”Xiao Yun, do you know who he is? We should go and express our gratitude ...”

Dong Yun was deep in thought, but she didn’t answer Zheng Shuying’s question. She just smiled and said,”Mom, leave this to me! I will go and thank him. ”

“Then I’ll have to come too! I’m the one they saved. If I don’t show up, won’t I be showing no sincerity?” Zheng Shuying asked, puzzled.

“I won ‘t!” Dong Yun smiled and said,”leave it to me! I promise I won’t neglect your benefactor!”

“This child, why are you still keeping me in suspense?” Zheng Shuying rebuked.

“Let’s eat, let’s eat!” Dong Yun changed the topic.”Mom, let me try the lychee meat you made. I haven’t had it in years ...”

“Yes, yes, yes! My lychee meat used to be your favorite!” Sure enough, Zheng Shuying’s attention was successfully diverted. She immediately picked up two large pieces of lychee meat and put them in Dong Yun’s bowl. She smiled and said,”try it. Has mom’s cooking skills deteriorated?”

......

Night fell on Peach Blossom Farm.

Xia ruofei drove back to his villa after spending the day with Ling Qingxue.

Although there was a small incident today, he was still very happy overall. It had been a long time since he had been shopping and chatting with his girlfriend.

The only downside was that Ling Qingxue insisted that he check out of the hotel room he had already booked because of his injured hand.

The two of them hadn’t been intimate for a long time, so they had already booked a hotel room. They were planning to hang out until dinner, and then go to the hotel to have a good time.

However, from Ling Qingxue’s point of view, Xia ruofei’s hand had been scalded so badly that it was obviously not suitable for vigorous exercise. So no matter how Xia ruofei begged, she firmly refused.

Xia ruofei could not use the magical spirit Heart Flower petal solution to completely cure Yingluo in front of Ling Qingxue. That would be too unrealistic and would scare Ling Qingxue.

In the end, he could only compromise helplessly.

Under Ling Qingxue’s repeated instructions, Xia ruofei drove straight back to the farm after dinner to check on Ling Qingxue. She was worried that it would be unsafe for him to drive since he could only use one hand.

In fact, on the way back to the farm, Xia ruofei had quickly found a quiet place to park the car. He took out a small bottle of higher concentration spirit Heart Flower petal solution from the spirit map space and completely cured his burns.

However, he still wrapped his hands with gauze and bandages. This was mainly to cover up his injuries. If Ling Qingxue came to the farm in the next two days and saw that his injuries were completely healed, it would be hard to explain.

Xia ruofei parked the car and played with Blackie, lightning, and the rest in the yard for a while. Then, they heard footsteps coming from the door.

“RUO Fei, you just came back?”

It was Feng Jing’s voice. She had nothing to do after dinner at the staff cafeteria and was taking a walk in the farm yard. She happened to see Xia ruofei’s car driving into the villa from afar and decided to walk over to tell him about the news of her failure in recruiting Dong Yun.

“Sister Che!” Xia ruofei said in surprise,”please come in!”

Blackie and the others were very familiar with Feng Rao, so they didn’t show any hostility toward her. Instead, they wagged their tails at her.

“You guys go play on your own!” Xia ruofei patted Lightning’s head and said.

“Sister Jing,” he said to Feng Jing,”I just came back from outside. Shall we go in and have some tea?”

At this moment, Feng Jing’s gaze fell on Xia ruofei’s bandaged hand. Her heart trembled as she asked,””What ... What happened to your hand?” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com
