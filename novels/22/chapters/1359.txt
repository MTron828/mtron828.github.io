Chapter 1360: Don’t let your own fertile water flow into others “fields (2)

Translator: 549690339

Hearing this, Xia ruofei was interested. He smiled and said,””Brother Zhao, your suggestion is quite interesting ...”

For Ling Xiaotian, his main base was in the southeast province, mainly in Sanshan city. At the moment, his main energy was still expanding in the province. If he could open a branch in Beijing to make a name for himself, it would naturally be very good. However, the biggest problem he faced was that he was not familiar with the people and the place.

If he cooperated with Zhao Yongjun’s Club, he would have no more worries. He just had to focus on running the private restaurant and constantly improving the quality of the dishes.

Moreover, the profit points of such high – end clubs were generally quite high. The most important thing was that the customers in the clubs were basically all upper – Class people. It was indeed a good choice for the brand plan of the lingji F & B group.

Zhao Yongjun smiled and said,”I was thinking about this on the way here. In order to deepen our cooperation, we can also use a share exchange method. The Ling’s private kitchen branch in Beijing will have a part of the club’s shares, and our club will also have a part of the shares of the branch in Beijing. Of course, it will only be for this branch. We will not involve the Ling’s F & B group ...”

“That’s not bad! In any case, don’t let your own fertile water flow into others “fields!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”as long as you’re not afraid that Qingxue and I will turn the club into a couple’s shop!”

“How could that be!” Zhao Yongjun laughed and said,”we can’t wait to cooperate with you, rich man! So this matter is temporarily settled like this? I’ll go back and talk to liangzi and the others, and try to get the plan started as soon as possible. We’ll settle the location problem first!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”sure!” I’ll talk to Qingxue about it as well. I believe my future father – in – Law will be very interested in it. ”

As the two of them chatted, the car unknowingly arrived at Taoyuan farm.

Xia ruofei rolled down the window and stuck his head out. He greeted the veteran at the gate and the three cars drove into the farm.

As it was getting late and Zhao Yongjun and the others had to fly for two to three hours, Xia ruofei did not invite them to visit his house. Instead, he drove the car directly to the complex.

Since everyone was going to stay in the southeast province for a few more days, it would not be too late to visit their home tomorrow.

The guest rooms in the complex had already been prepared and cleaned up. The beddings had been changed according to Xia ruofei’s request. Although they could not be compared to the star – rated hotels, they were clean and comfortable.

Xia ruofei personally sent Zhao Yongjun and the others to their rooms. Everyone gathered in Zhao Yongjun’s room and chatted for a while before returning to their rooms to rest. Xia ruofei also took a walk back to his small villa.

Back in the bedroom, Xia ruofei took out his phone, keys, wallet, and other things and placed them on the bedside table. Then, he prepared to take a shower.

Before he entered the bathroom, he lit up his phone out of habit and saw that Ling Qingxue and Song Wei had both sent him WeChat messages. The two girls had already arrived home safely.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and put his phone aside. Then, he picked up a set of clean coral fleece home clothes and went into the bathroom. After taking a shower and changing into comfortable home clothes, Xia ruofei dried his hair with a bath towel as he walked to the bed and sat down. He used his other hand to pick up his phone.

He replied to Song Wei’s WeChat message,’it’s good that you’re home safely. We’ve just arrived too. You should rest early!’ Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Then, Xia ruofei returned to his phone’s home page and opened the dialing app, ready to call Ling Qingxue. Ran ran’s suggestion on the way today had tempted Xia ruofei. He wanted to talk to Ling Qingxue as soon as possible and ask for Ling Xiaotian’s opinion.

If Ling Xiaotian agreed, then the specific investment amount, share structure, and so on could be discussed.

However, before Xia ruofei could get Ling Qingxue’s number, his phone rang with a WeChat notification.

It turned out that Song Wei was not resting either. She replied within seconds after she received Xia ruofei’s message.

Hence, Xia ruofei closed the dialing software and reopened WeChat.

Song Wei’s message was,”RUO Fei, you said you had something to tell me today. Is it convenient to tell me now?”

Xia ruofei suddenly remembered about the realm stone. He typed a few words in the WeChat input box and deleted it after some thought. Then, he found Song Wei’s number and called her.

“Ruofei!” Song Wei answered the call quickly.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it’s already so late and you’re still up?” It’s not good for girls to stay up late!”

Song Wei laughed in embarrassment and said, “I’m ready to sleep. I was lying on the bed and looking at my phone just now! You just sent me a WeChat message, so I just wanted to ask ... Oh right, what’s the matter?”

Xia ruofei thought for a moment and asked,””Song Wei, I remember that you were poisoned last time because you entered an ancient tomb of the Ming Dynasty, right?”

That experience was unforgettable for Song Wei. It was like she had a close brush with death. The other three archeologists were poisoned with more poison than she was and had passed away one after another. In fact, when Song Wei received treatment from Xia ruofei, the last archeologists were already in critical condition.

If she had not met Xia ruofei, Song Wei would have been dead by now.

Song Wei felt a sense of fear in her heart. She said,”Yup! It’s an ancient tomb from the Ming Dynasty in Hunan Province. ”

She was a little curious as to why Xia ruofei would suddenly ask about this, but she still told him the truth.

“Song Wei, I’m ... I’m interested in this tomb. I want to go in and take a look. I heard ...” Xia ruofei said.

“No! Absolutely not!” Song Wei said anxiously,”this is too dangerous! Ruofei, that kind of poison is invisible and odorless, so there’s no way to guard against it!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”To me, the poison is not a big deal. Even if I’m really infected, I have the ability to cure it, don’t I?”

Song Wei was stunned for a moment. She had not thought of this.

However, she quickly said,”that still won’t do!” The degree of my poisoning was very light, and ... And you can’t guarantee that ... If ... If you were poisoned, you would be able to cure it, right? This is a matter of life and death, we can’t take this risk!”

Xia ruofei said,”Song Wei, listen to me first ... First!” I already have some understanding of this poison. In fact, it’s not invisible or tasteless in my eyes. It can even be said that it has nowhere to hide!”

Song Wei did not say anything. She knew that Xia ruofei was not bragging. Back then, the poison in her body had been cleared by Xia ruofei. Perhaps Xia ruofei really had a way to detect the poison. Otherwise, how could he have treated it?

Xia ruofei paused and continued,””Secondly, the reason why I want to enter the ancient tomb is that there’s something inside that is very important to me!”

In fact, the country didn’t advocate archeology in ancient tombs like this.

Under normal circumstances, they would only be excavated by accident or by grave robbers. The relevant cultural relics Department would only carry out a rescue excavation. Otherwise, in principle, they would let them remain underground.

Even if it was an excavated tomb, everything inside would naturally belong to the country according to the law.

Hence, Xia ruofei’s words were in fact against the relevant regulations.

However, his relationship with Song Wei meant that he did not have to hide it. Moreover, according to his and Xia Qing’s analysis, even if there were world stones in the ancient tomb, it was very likely that they had existed from the beginning, and the ancient tomb just happened to be built there.

Hence, from this perspective, even if Xia ruofei found and took the world stone, it was not considered stealing the cultural relic.

Xia ruofei continued,”I heard that the tomb was sealed and filled up after the last incident. I don’t know the exact location. I need your help.”
