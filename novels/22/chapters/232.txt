Chapter 233: Chapter 229 – Gu Ling courtyard (1)

This time, Xia ruofei still used the Traditional Chinese Medicine prescription for liver cancer, but he had changed it to another one because it was cheap. When he was in Hongzhou, he didn’t need to worry about the cost of the herbs. Now that he was going to buy the herbs himself, there was no need to be so wasteful. Anyway, it was the petals of the exotic flowers that were effective. Xia ruofei bought a lot of herbs at the Chinese Medical Hall and kept them in her interspace. Then, he began to brew the medicine in the spirit map space. He still brewed six doses of Chinese medicine, enough for elder song to take for two days. This time, the concentration of the petal solution that Xia ruofei had added was very low. It was the kind that was used to mix a strange flower petal with a box of water in the spatial pool. Xia ruofei had planned to prolong the treatment. In total, elder song had used up almost two – thirds of the petals. There was no need for him to use a high – purity petal solution anymore. After preparing the Chinese medicine, Xia ruofei thought for a while and dug out a stick of wild ginseng. Firstly, elder song was recuperating in the three mountains, and it would not be good for him to come empty – handed on his first visit. Furthermore, Xia ruofei had always respected this legendary general from the bottom of his heart. Although wild ginseng was precious, it was nothing to Xia ruofei. It was just right to give one to elder song. Secondly, Xia ruofei also wanted to see how much the wild ginseng had grown in the medium. Hence, Xia ruofei had dug it out randomly. The result did not disappoint Xia ruofei. The main root of the ginseng was almost 16 centimeters long. It was very thick, as thick as two adult fingers. The tiny roots were even more luxuriant, reaching 30 to 40 centimeters. There were many protruding dots on the top of the roots, like small pearls decorating it. Compared to the three that he had dug out to sell last time, it had grown by a third. This speed was truly astonishing! Xia ruofei used a small brush to carefully remove the soil around the ginseng’s roots. Then, he left it to dry in the space. He left the outside world to surf the internet for a while. He went to the balcony to smoke a cigarette before returning to his room and re – entering the spirit map space. Because of the flow of time, the Chinese medicine in the medium had completely cooled down, and the wild ginseng had also dried naturally. Xia ruofei found a large paper box and wrapped the wild ginseng up. Then, he placed the concocted medicinal soup in a claypot and left the medium with the ginseng. Xia ruofei found a basket to put the clay pot in. After covering the lid, he found some foam to fill the space to prevent the Chinese medicine from spilling out on the road. Then, he bade farewell to ye Lingyun and pang Hao and drove the pickup truck out of Tao Yuan farm to visit elder song. Driving the Knight XV would be too ostentatious, so Xia ruofei felt that a pickup truck was more suitable. Elder song was staying in guling, which was in the southern suburbs of Sanshan city. Xia ruofei drove on the fast road for more than ten minutes before he reached the entrance to the mountain from the side road. He followed the steep winding mountain road up. The slope here was rather steep and many cycling enthusiasts liked to rush down the slope. Xia ruofei met several groups of people on the way. After driving for about five kilometers, a fork appeared in the road. The straight road led to the guling Scenic Area, while the right road led to Xia ruofei’s destination, a Training Center of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference in Xuanji province. Elder song had set the collapsed ground here for the sake of peace and quiet. Although it was on the edge of the scenic Area, the training center was far from the main road, and there was only one road leading there, so the security work was relatively less stressful. The mountain environment was pleasant and the air was fresh, which was more beneficial for the recovery of the elderly. Not long after they drove into the intersection and just turned a corner, Xia ruofei’s car was stopped by two soldiers with loaded guns. After checking the license plate and Xia ruofei’s documents, the soldier waved his hand and let them through. There were three sentries as they drove in. Although Xia ruofei’s license plate had already been reported to manager Lu, the Sentry still meticulously checked the situation inside the car and Xia ruofei’s identification before letting them through. The training center usually hosted some meetings, banquets, and other services, but it had been cleared out long ago. The huge Training Center had become a temporary courtyard for elder song. Only elder song, the staff around him, and the medical team were here. In addition, a side building of the training center had become the temporary station of the security force. Xia ruofei’s car was parked in front of the main building of the training center. Manager Lu, a leading figure, was personally waiting in front of the building. “Doctor Xia! “Thank you for your hard work ...” Manager Lu greeted him with a smile. Xia ruofei held the basket in one hand and the long paper box in the other. He smiled and said,””I’m not worthy of being welcomed by manager Lu personally!” “Let’s go!”Manager Lu laughed. The Bureau chief is waiting for you upstairs!” Xia ruofei followed manager Lu upstairs and met elder song in a luxurious suite. Song Zhengping and song Zhilan were also in the room. They were very enthusiastic when they saw Xia ruofei. After three days of not seeing him, elder song seemed to be in high spirits. He didn’t look like a cancer patient at all. Elder song was also very happy to see Xia ruofei and invited him to sit down. Xia ruofei handed the basket to manager Lu and said,””Manager Lu, this is the liver – nourishing Chinese medicine I just concocted. The medical group should have sealed bags, so let them divide it into six portions and store it in cold storage. After the chief has his lunch, let him take one first. ” “Alright, alright!” Manager Lu took the basket and said,”thank you, doctor Xia.” Manager Lu took the Chinese medicine and left. Xia ruofei placed the paper box on the coffee table and smiled.””Chief, this is a small gift from me. It’s for you to recuperate.” “Oh? Xia even gave me a present!” Elder song smiled and said,”I’ll have to take a good look then ...” Elder song said as he personally opened the box. Song Zhengping and song Zhilan also looked over curiously. The wild ginseng was exposed to everyone’s sight. Elder song couldn’t help but narrow his eyes. Song Zhengping’s eyes were filled with surprise.”Doctor Xia, is this wild ginseng?” Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. “Such a Big Wild ginseng, it’s at least a hundred years old ...” Song Zhilan couldn’t help but be a little speechless. She didn’t expect Xia ruofei to be so generous. She couldn’t help but look at Xia ruofei with a strange expression. Although this wild ginseng was only a third bigger than the last one, if Xia ruofei sold it at Tongren Hall, he could sell it for at least two million Chinese dollars, more than double the price. This was because the older the wild ginseng was, the more valuable it was. The price of two 50 – year – old and 100 – year – old ginseng could be several times higher. Of course, two million Yuan was nothing in the eyes of the song family, but the key was that this kind of hundred – year – old wild ginseng was priceless. Once it appeared on the market, it would be snapped up quickly. Nowadays, there were too many rich people. Who wouldn’t want to keep a stick of this kind of high – Quality ginseng at home? If there was any illness, this could save his life. Therefore, even if the song family wanted to get such a good wild ginseng, it would take a lot of effort. Elder song raised his head and looked at Xia ruofei. He smiled and said,”Xia, this gift is a little too expensive!”
