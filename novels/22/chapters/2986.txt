2987 The pair of phoenixes (3)

Naturally, Shao Qingyang would not casually reveal this cultivation method. Even within the fallen leaf sect, he would not easily impart it to others.

As the saying goes, the Dao can not be easily passed on. In this era, a good cultivation method was quite valuable, not to mention that the flying flower Valley had just spent a large sum of money to buy this cultivation method. If it were to be leaked from the fallen leaves sect, then they would not only offend the star Seizer sect, but also the flying flower Valley.

Xia ruofei nodded and looked at his watch. He said,””Please go ahead, sect master Shao!”

Shao Qingyang didn’t dare to waste any more time. He quickly sat down on the seat that Li Yifu had been sitting on earlier, picked up the manuscript, and read it carefully, memorizing it.

As long as Shao Qingyang did not take this book out of the private room and did not take a pen to copy it, Xia ruofei would naturally not care about him.

The auction for the pair of flying phoenixes had already started. Xia ruofei shot a look at Luo Qingfeng, asking him to keep an eye on Shao Qingyang. Then, she turned her attention to the auction.

The starting price of the flying Phoenix ring was 15000 spirit stones. As soon as Hao Qingsong announced the start of the auction, many cultivators joined in the bidding. The price on the big screen jumped up and down, soaring all the way.

Xia ruofei did not participate in the bidding at first. He just watched the price of the storage ring rise from 15000 spiritual stones to 25000 spiritual stones. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

The 10,000 spiritual stones increase took less than three minutes.

The enthusiasm of the cultivators was evident.

The price was still rising very quickly. Some cultivators who were not very rich had not been kicked out yet, so Xia ruofei was not in a hurry to join in. He held a glass of fruit juice and took a sip from time to time, looking very relaxed.

In Room 6, Willow saw this and couldn’t help but smile.””It’s a good thing I’m not going to participate in the auction. It looks like even 50000 spirit stones won’t be enough to win!”

As soon as Liu Mansha returned to the private room, she could not help but flip open the first volume of “the true understanding of Linlang” and read it with great interest. When she heard Yang Liu’s words, she shifted her gaze away from the handwritten book, raised her head, and said with a trace of guilt,”Junior Sister yang, this pair of rings has an extraordinary origin, and they’re even better than you expected ... It’s a pity to miss them! This time, it’s Senior Sister who has dragged you down ...”

“Senior Sister Liu, please don’t say that!” Yang Liu laughed. So what if the storage ring was good? It was nothing more than a storage device! However, this cultivation technique was different! It can increase the strength of our flying flower Valley by a large margin! Isn’t it obvious which one is more important?”

“The valley will definitely compensate you in the future. I’ll also try my best to find you a high – Quality storage ring as soon as possible ...” Liu Mansha nodded.

“Then I’ll thank you in advance, Valley master!” Willow said with a smile.

In contrast to the harmonious atmosphere in Room 6, the atmosphere in room 15, where the spirit Vulture mountain was located, was a little dull.

After Luo Feng and Wu Ming returned in defeat, they didn’t speak for a long time. Wu Ming was so angry that he couldn’t speak. Luo Feng, on the other hand, was secretly trying to figure out the new insights about the glittering jewel true understanding. According to the sentence breaking method in the star Seizer sect’s hand – copied copy, he found that some questions that had troubled him for a long time had actually been explained. Now was the time when he remembered them the most deeply, so he naturally hoped to digest these insights as soon as possible.

When the pair of rings was revealed, the hatred in Wu Ming’s eyes grew even more intense. If the star Seizer sect had not intervened and put the “glittering jewel true understanding” up for auction, the spirit Vulture mountain would have had an abundant reserve of funds this time. He would definitely have competed for this pair of storage rings.

However, now that he had lost the income from the auction of the cultivation technique and lost 50000 spirit stones, the remaining spirit stones were not enough to support him in competing for the treasure.

The more detailed Hao Qingsong’s explanation was, the uglier Wu Ming’s expression became.

When the bidding price reached 25000 spirit stones, Wu Ming couldn’t help but shout,””Uncle Feng! No! I’m definitely going to have this pair of storage rings!”

Luo Feng, who was trying his best to comprehend the glittering jewel true understanding, was shocked. He quickly turned his head to look at Wu Ming and said,””Young sect leader Wu, we don’t have enough spirit stones ...”

“Aren’t there 80000 spirit stones left?” Wu Ming said with a gloomy face.

The spirit Vulture mountain had prepared 130000 spirit stones this time. In addition, they were also preparing to auction the transcript of the “glittering jewel true understanding”. The plan was to invest at least 180000 spirit stones.

If he had so much money, it would be enough for Wu Ming to buy the storage ring and use the remaining spirit stones to fight for the treasure.

However, without the income from the ‘glittering jewel true Scripture’ and losing another 50000 spirit stones, he was left with only 80000 spirit stones. He was already stretched thin and had little hope of winning the bid for that treasure. How could he let Wu Ming compete for the storage ring?

Luo Feng couldn’t be bothered to comprehend the “glittering jewel true understanding” anymore. He quickly said,”Young sect leader, you can’t touch these 80000 spirit stones! Otherwise, we definitely won’t be able to compete with the other sects in the auction for that treasure later!”

“Even if we don’t use a single spirit stone, do you think 80000 spirit stones are enough for us to compete?” Wu Ming said in frustration. I think he’s most likely going to run with them! You might as well just buy me a Storage ring! This pair of rings was also given to his Dao companions by scholar Yuntai! It would be so meaningful if I bought it for Yiyi and Xiaoxiao!”

Yiyi and Xiaoxiao were a pair of twin female cultivators that Wu Ming had been pursuing. According to his experience, as long as he put in some effort, he should be able to get them very soon. If he had the pair of Flying Phoenix rings, he was absolutely confident that he could capture these two stunner girls easily.

Luo Feng didn’t know whether to laugh or cry,”the competition for that treasure was a big deal set by the sect leader!” Young sect leader, we can’t delay the important matters! Otherwise, we’ll all be dead when we go back!”
