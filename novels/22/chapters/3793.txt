Chapter 3794  The sound of shock (2)

  If the entire green Immortal Island could be moved into the spirit map space, the mountain sea realm would also have an ocean. Although the spirit map space had not yet evolved to its ultimate state, and the ocean was not as vast as the real ocean outside, it was more than enough to accommodate such a small island.

  Not to mention one, even eight or ten would be a cinch.

  In this case, it was equivalent to having such a beautiful immortal mansion in the spirit map space. The rich spirit Qi in the space could also accelerate the growth of spirit flowers and spirit herbs. If it was a particularly precious spirit herb, time array flags could be used to change the flow of time to achieve the effect of ripening.

  It was simply too perfect!

  Of course, Xia ruofei still needed to familiarize himself with the situation and figure out how to control the island through the mansion - guarding wooden token.

  According to bi youzi, as long as the mansion - guarding wooden token was refined, green Immortal Island could be taken directly. However, bi youzi did not go into details and Xia ruofei had to figure out the specifics himself.

  While Xia ruofei's mind was racing, Song Wei and Ling Qingxue had long been stunned by the beautiful garden in front of them.

  Speaking of which, the two of them were already golden core cultivators. Even if they were not very knowledgeable when they were with Xia ruofei, they had at least eaten and seen her before. They were not those poor rogue cultivators. However, coming to green touring immortal abode was still like entering the Grand View Garden.

  "RUO Fei, this ... This is such a beautiful immortal mansion. Will it be yours in the future?" Ling Qingxue said with a look of disbelief.

  Xia ruofei smiled."Theoretically, yes. But I still have to figure out how to take it away!"

  "Yes, yes, yes!" Ling Qingxue said,"and we still have to think about how to settle it! He couldn't bring such a Big Island back to Huaxia! Even if it was placed in the ocean near Paradise Island, it didn't seem appropriate ... If the satellite in the sky discovered that there was suddenly an Island in the ocean, wouldn't it cause a huge uproar? Besides, there are also some other islands near our Paradise Island, and there are also residents on them, right? There's no way we can keep this a secret!"

  Xia ruofei chuckled."You don't have to worry too much about this. The concealment array of green travel Immortal Island is quite advanced. Whether it's a satellite in the sky or a ship in the sea, as long as I don't want them to find me, they will definitely not be able to find me." Moreover, the amount of spiritual Qi required to maintain the concealment array isn't much, so it can be kept open 24 hours a day without a break. This shouldn't be a problem!"

  Xia ruofei continued,"also ... I may not necessarily place green travel Immortal Island near Paradise Island ..."

  "Ah?" Ling Qingxue couldn't help but ask,"then ... Then where do you want to put it?" Could it be hidden in the North Pole? It's too inconvenient to make a round trip!" Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

  "I haven't decided yet!" Xia ruofei smiled and said,"I'll familiarize myself with the control of the wooden token first."

  He didn't want Song Wei and Ling Qingxue to know about the spirit map space for the time being. He also had plans to place green Immortal Island in the spirit map space, so he could only be vague about it.

  Song Wei smiled and said,"Qingxue, you can't eat hot tofu in haste. Anyway, the control core of the entire immortal abode has been refined by RUO Fei. This immortal Island is already in RUO Fei's pocket. Let's just listen to RUO Fei!"

  "Alright then!" Ling Qingxue said. She looked at the ancient buildings and couldn't help but say,"the environment here is too beautiful! The only flaw is that the entire immortal estate is hidden underground, so it's more or less a bit depressing ..."

  Xia ruofei's heart skipped a beat.

  According to normal logic, cultivators generally wouldn't place their immortal's caves so deep underground. After all, people still wanted to be exposed to the sun. Living in such an environment all year round, even if those lighting magic weapons could completely light up the place, there would still be a difference from the ground.

  Bi youzi probably had some special considerations for hiding the immortal estate underground.

  Or perhaps ...

  Xia ruofei had some guesses in his heart but he did not say them out loud.

  "Let's continue walking! There's a big hall in front of us, that's what I call majestic!" Xia ruofei said with a smile.

  He led Song Wei and Ling Qingxue into the house.

  After a while, Xia ruofei and the other two arrived at the huge square paved with bluestone slabs. These bluestone slabs were polished to the point that they could reflect people, just like mirrors.

  In front of the bluestone square was the 30 - 40 meter tall Palace.

  This should be the core building of the entire immortal abode. Back then, Xia ruofei had obtained the three boxes left behind by bi youzi in this Palace, and among them were the residence - guarding wooden token.

  "It's too majestic!" Ling Qingxue sighed as she looked up at the palace that had no name carved on it.

  "Let's go! Let's go in and take a look!" Xia ruofei said with a smile.

  After passing through the bluestone square and climbing a total of ninety - nine steps, the three of them arrived at the entrance of the palace.

  Two three - meter - tall stone statues stood guard on both sides of the door. They looked like Guardian beasts. These Guardian beasts looked like dragons and Lions, but they were not at the same time Dragons and Lions. Although there was no life in them, just standing there, one could immediately feel a wave of pressure coming from them.

  As soon as this thought appeared in Xia ruofei's mind, his train of thought immediately dispersed.

  If the entire green Immortal Island could be moved into the spirit map space, the mountain sea realm would also have an ocean. Although the spirit map space had not yet evolved to its ultimate state, and the ocean was not as vast as the real ocean outside, it was more than enough to accommodate such a small island.

  "Ah?" Ling Qingxue couldn't help but ask,"then ... Then where do you want to put it?" Could it be hidden in the North Pole? It's too inconvenient to make a round trip!"
