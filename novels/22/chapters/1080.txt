Chapter 1081: Reunion of good friends (1)

Translator: 549690339

Feng Rao was pulled away from Dong Xinyu’s table by Xia ruofei until she heard Xia ruofei say to the waiter,””Please take us there!”

Feng Rao finally came back to her senses and realized that Xia ruofei had been holding her hand the whole time. Her face heated up slightly and she gently broke free.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel a little embarrassed. He didn’t have any bad intentions just now. He just didn’t want to be entangled with that small star anymore and wanted to pull Feng Jing away.

In order to resolve the awkward atmosphere, Xia ruofei laughed dryly and said,””President Feng, there’s nothing to talk about with them. Let’s find a new brand ambassador!”

Feng Rao sighed and said,””I’m just a little angry. It’s the first time I’ve seen such shameless people. They’re clearly the ones who went back on their words, but they’re still so righteous, as if we’re the ones in the wrong!”

Xia ruofei laughed as he looked at Feng Jing. “You’ve already made your decision, haven’t you?”

Feng Rao was stunned for a moment, then she nodded and said,”Yup! I chose Dong Xinyu back then because I fancied her pure and obedient image. I didn’t expect the contrast to be so great in reality ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”that’s why!” There’s nothing to be depressed about, we should be glad that we discovered it earlier! Otherwise, if we really sign her, she’ll cause a lot of negative news sooner or later, and our brand image will be damaged!”

“En!” Feng Rao nodded.

After hearing Xia ruofei’s words, she felt much better.

Feng Rao then said with some annoyance,”Our funds were also suppressed by 100000 Yuan! This Dong Xinyu is really not particular about the way she does things!”

“It’s only three to four days. They’ll return very soon,”Xia ruofei said indifferently.

“Chairman, you gave them three days. Can they really pay on time?” Feng Rao asked unconfidently.

Although 100,000 Yuan wasn’t a lot, Dong Xinyu and Fang Hongli’s faces were disgusting. The thought of the company’s funds being suppressed for another month made Feng Jing extremely unhappy.

Of course, Feng Jing thought that Xia ruofei was just saying it out of anger or that he was trying to save some face. She did not take it seriously.

“You’ll know in a few days,”Xia ruofei said with a faint smile.

Xia ruofei was no longer the ignorant fool he was before. He did not take the initiative to provoke others, but if someone provoked him, he would not be polite.

A small star like Dong Xinyu might seem very impressive to the average person, but in the eyes of those with real power, she was just an actress. With Xia ruofei’s strong network, it would be a matter of minutes if he wanted to deal with her.

Let’s see if they know what’s good for them.

Seeing that Xia ruofei did not want to say more, Feng Jing did not ask further. She took a deep breath and exhaled as if she wanted to get rid of all the gloominess she had today.

As they spoke, the two of them were led to a booth by a waiter.

Tang Yitian had personally reserved this table. This area was quieter than Dong Xinyu ‘s, and the seats were arranged in a well – arranged manner. There were some green plants in the middle that formed an ingenious barrier, making it quite private.

“Would you like to order now?” The waiter pulled out a chair for Feng Rao and asked respectfully.

Xia ruofei said,”let’s order when our friends arrive!” Please get us two glasses of lemon water!”

“Alright, please wait a moment!” The waiter bowed slightly and left. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

This booth was in the shape of a, and it could comfortably seat five people.

Considering that Tang Yitian and Jennifer would be coming over later, Xia ruofei and Feng Jing sat on the same side.

The waiter quickly brought two glasses of lemon water and then quietly left.

The environment of Zola’s restaurant was very good. Xia ruofei and Feng Jing chatted in low voices while listening to soothing piano music. They would occasionally take a sip of lemon water and felt very relaxed.

After a while, Xia ruofei heard a clear voice.””RUO Fei, so you’ve already arrived! I’m sorry, I’m sorry ...”

Xia ruofei and Feng Jing were sitting with their backs facing the crowd. When he heard Tang Yitian’s voice, he smiled and stood up with Feng Jing.

“Big brother Tang! Sister – in – Law!” Xia ruofei greeted him with a smile.

Tang Yitian and Jennifer greeted Xia ruofei with warm smiles. Tang Haoran was standing beside them. The little guy looked very calm, but the deep admiration in his eyes warmed Xia ruofei’s heart.

Tang Haoran shouted with a trace of excitement,””Master!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. He reached out and touched his head.”Haoran, did you miss your master?”

Tang Haoran nodded his head heavily.

At this time, Xia ruofei realized that Feng Rao was staring at Tang Yitian and Jennifer with a shocked expression.

Feng Jing knew that Xia ruofei had a good relationship with the Maya Group in Australia. After all, the application for the 10 million USD paradise charity fund was already in progress.

Lin Qiao was a tight – lipped girl. Although she was on good terms with Feng Jing, she didn’t spread the news about Xia ruofei in Australia. Hence, Feng Jing didn’t know much about Xia ruofei’s relationship with Tang Yitian’s family.
