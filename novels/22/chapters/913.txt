Hearing this, Jennifer quickly carried little Haoran to the seat beside Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei took the child from her hands and placed him on the aisle of the cabin, sitting cross – legged.

Xia ruofei sat down cross – legged behind little Haoran, his hands skillfully pressing on the Xinshu point on his back.

Xia ruofei’s spiritual energy seeped out of his body and entered little Haoran’s meridians through the Xinshu point. He quickly checked the meridians that had been cleared just now and found that they were indeed blocked again.

Xia ruofei didn’t dare to delay and quickly followed Xia Qing’s instructions. He didn’t forcefully clear his meridians, but instead controlled his spiritual power to wrap wisps of pure Yang Qi through the bladder meridian of the foot of the sun and finally transmitted it out from the Xinshu point.

Then, the pure Yang Qi entered Xia ruofei’s pericardium meridian through the laogong acupoint on his palm.

The moment the innate pure Yang Qi entered his body, Xia ruofei instantly felt a burning warm current. His heart trembled and he quickly focused his energy to guide the innate pure Yang Qi to circulate in his meridians.

Following the simple technique that Xia Qing had provided, the pure Yang Qi entered Xia ruofei’s dantian after passing through a few meridians.

Although Xia Qing’s magic art was simple and easy to understand, the effect was still very good.

Although the innate pure Yang Qi came from little Haoran’s body, after Xia ruofei’s meridians circulated it, the initial rejection had completely disappeared. It obediently stayed in Xia ruofei’s dantian.

Xia ruofei felt his lower abdomen warm up and his body seemed to be stronger than usual.

Xia ruofei had no time to care about the changes in his body. He gathered his spirit and once again sent his spiritual energy into little Haoran’s body. Then, he wrapped it around the innate pure Yang Qi and repeated the process.

Time passed by.

Xia ruofei’s forehead started to sweat again. His hair was almost drenched and steam was rising from it.

Tang Yitian, Jennifer, and Lin Qiao were so nervous that they didn’t even dare to breathe. They stared at Xia ruofei and little Haoran without blinking.

Xia ruofei was like a hardworking Porter, guiding the pure Yang Qi from little Haoran’s body into his own.

He was already fully focused and was almost completely unaware of the outside world. He didn’t even feel the occasional small bumps on the plane.

However, this kind of work was very exhausting. Xia ruofei’s spiritual power was being consumed rapidly as he guided the energy.

The amount of innate pure Yang Qi in his dantian was also increasing.

With this, the difficulty for Xia ruofei to guide the pure Yang Qi was gradually decreasing. However, the speed of spiritual energy consumption was still very fast.

When Xia ruofei had absorbed about a quarter of the pure Yang Qi in little Haoran’s body, he felt a dull pain in his head. He also felt that his spiritual power output was lacking.

He knew that the spiritual power in his sea of consciousness was about to be exhausted. If he continued to hold on, he would definitely damage his Foundation.

Hence, Xia ruofei slowly retracted his spiritual energy. However, he still maintained his original posture. After retracting his spiritual energy, Xia ruofei guided the innate pure Yang Qi that was absorbed into his body and circulated it a few times in his body according to the technique that Xia Qing had taught him.

After feeling that the pure yang genuine Qi could be used more freely, Xia ruofei sent it back to his dantian.

Then, Xia ruofei slowly opened his eyes.

Tang Yitian and Jennifer couldn’t help but become more nervous. They stared at Xia ruofei, hoping to find some clues from his expression. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Xia ruofei looked pale and tired, but he still smiled at the two of them and said,””Mr. Tang, Ms. Annie, little Haoran’s condition has greatly improved. He should wake up in a while.”

Tang Yitian was overjoyed and quickly said,””Mr. Xia, I don’t know how to thank you, I ...”

Tang Yitian started to choke up as he spoke. He was a Playboy when he was young and never had a family. Later, he met Jennifer, and his heart was finally settled. When he was 39 years old, little Haoran was born. Although he didn’t have a son at an old age, he really loved this only child to the bone.

Little Haoran’s health had always been poor, especially in the past few years. Tang Yitian had been very worried about him.

Never in his wildest dreams would he have thought that a young man he met by chance at the airport would actually save little Haoran from such a critical situation.

Could it be that this was destined?

Jennifer was so excited that her eyes were filled with tears. She held little Haoran tightly and said to Xia ruofei,””Mr. Xia, thank you ... Thank you. You’re so ... So kind to our family ...”

Tang Yitian tacitly reminded her,””This is the same as rebirth!”

“Yes, yes, yes! It’s the same as rebirth!” Jennifer said quickly, and then she said a little embarrassedly,”my Chinese is not very good and I don’t know how to express my gratitude to you.”

Lin Qiao, who was full of emotions, witnessed this touching scene from the side. Her eyes were red at first, but when she saw Jennifer’s expression, she could not help but burst out laughing.

The star idol that she had once admired so much, the God – like existence in her heart, this impression had gradually become a real person with blood, flesh, and feelings.

Xia ruofei smiled.”It’s fate that we met. Little Haoran and we are fated!”

“Yes, yes, yes, this must be fate!” Tang Yitian also said.

In the VIP room of the airport, Tang Yitian felt that Xia ruofei had a calmness that didn’t match his age. At the same time, his otherworldly temperament left a good impression on him.

That was why he chatted with Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao for a while and even gave Xia ruofei his name card.

In fact, Xia ruofei was the same.

He didn’t know that Tang Yitian was a super – rich man in Australia, nor did he know that Jennifer was a big star. Of course, even if he knew, he still had a very indifferent attitude when dealing with them.

However, unlike many people who wanted to show off their wealth after they had a little bit of money, Tang Yitian and his wife had always been friendly, which made Xia ruofei have a good impression of them. In addition, little Haoran was so cute, so Xia ruofei would do his best to help him.

“Mr. Tang, after the treatment just now, little Haoran shouldn’t act up in the short term, but the hidden dangers in his body haven’t been completely removed yet ...” Xia ruofei said to Tang Yitian.

Tang Yitian couldn’t help but worry.

Xia ruofei smiled. Without waiting for Tang Yitian to ask, he said,””It’s mainly because my strength is limited, so I can’t get rid of the hidden danger in one go. However, the crisis has passed. After the plane lands, I’ll be in my best condition. After treating little Haoran once or twice, he should be completely back to normal.”

“Okay, okay ... Mr. Xia, I’ll leave everything to you!” Tang Yitian quickly said. Oh, right ...”

After saying that, Tang Yitian quickly walked back to the business class to take his password – protected suitcase. He quickly opened it and took out a gold pen and a checkbook.

“Mr. Tang, what are you doing ...” Xia ruofei quickly said.

Before Xia ruofei could finish his words, Tang Yitian had already signed a check and handed it to Xia ruofei.

Tang Yitian said sincerely,”Mr. Xia, compared to your great kindness, I know it’s not very appropriate to talk about money. However, you almost collapsed because you worked so hard to treat Haoran’s illness. This is just a small token of my appreciation. You can take it and buy some supplements to nourish your body. I will thank you in the future!”

Xia ruofei didn’t reach out for the check. He just glanced at it and smiled.”Mr. Tang, this little thought of yours is a bit scary! What kind of supplement costs ten million US dollars?”

Lin Qiao couldn’t help but exclaim when she heard 10 million US dollars. Then, she quickly covered her mouth.

Although she, a qualified fan, knew that Jennifer’s husband was a super – rich man, it was only on the internet. When she saw Tang Yitian sign a check for ten million dollars to thank Xia ruofei, she was really shocked.

“Compared to Haoran’s life, let alone ten million US dollars, even a hundred million or a billion is nothing,” said Tang Yitian seriously. This little bit of money is really just a small gift from me. Mr. Xia, please accept it!”

“That’s right, Mr. Xia,” Jennifer said,”please give us a chance to express our gratitude!”

Xia ruofei also said seriously,”Mr. Tang, Ms. Annie, I’m not treating little Haoran for the consultation fee. Besides, you’re giving me too much money. A gentleman loves money and has his own way of getting it. I can’t accept this money.”

Xia ruofei was a man of principle. The last time he received the consultation fee from Hengfeng group’s MA Xiong, he had rejected it a few times and accepted it. However, this time, he was the one who took the initiative to treat little Haoran. On the other hand, he could also benefit greatly from the treatment.

Hence, under such circumstances, Xia ruofei would not accept the payment no matter what.

Xia ruofei’s words made Tang Yitian and Jennifer feel a deep sense of respect. Beside him, Lin Qiao’s beautiful eyes were also filled with a strange light. She couldn’t help but look at Xia ruofei, her eyes full of worship and a trace of a different kind of emotion.

“Mr. Xia,” Tang Yitian forced a smile,”I, Tang Yitian, have never taken back the things I’ve given. But you’re Haoran’s Savior ...”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Mr. Tang, why don’t you donate this money to charity? doing more good deeds is also good for little Haoran!”

“Good idea!” Tang Yitian’s eyes lit up. Mr. Xia, after we get off the plane, I’ll immediately donate this money to Chinese charity organizations in your name!”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment. He quickly waved his hand and said,””No, no, no. How can you use my name to pay for your money?”

“It’s the same, the same!” Tang Yitian said with a big smile,”this way, not only can I accumulate good karma for Haoran, but I can also accumulate good karma for you, Mr. Xia! It’s decided!”

“Good idea!” Jennifer also gave him a thumbs up with a smile.

Even Lin Qiao joined in and said,””Brother ruofei, it’s a donation anyway. Isn’t it the same whose name we use? Don’t decline!”

Xia ruofei nodded helplessly and said,””Where are you guys ...”

Tang Yitian saw that Xia ruofei didn’t object anymore, so he said happily,””Mr. Xia, why don’t we set up a charity fund under your name? this money can be used as the starting capital. In the future, the Meiya group will continue to invest more money in it every year. How about we call it ... The Xia ruofei fund?”

Xia ruofei quickly said,”don ‘t!” I don’t want to have to wear sunglasses when I go out ...”

“Hahaha ...” Tang Yitian couldn’t help but look at his wife and laughed. He continued,”but it’s such a big sum of money to donate to other charity organizations. There’s a problem with supervision!” I think it’s better to set up a separate charity fund. ”

Tang Yitian continued to explain,”first of all, I’m inclined to invest this sum of money in China. After all, my roots are there. However, the chaos in the domestic charity industry makes me feel uneasy, so I personally prefer to set up a foundation. This way, I can ensure that good things can be done with good intentions, and not let some people fill their own pockets.”

“I agree, but the name of the foundation can’t be ...” Xia ruofei nodded.

“Allan! Alan, you’re awake? How do you feel?”

Xia ruofei was interrupted by Jennifer’s excited voice.

Everyone quickly looked over and saw little Haoran’s eyelashes moving a few times. Then, he slowly opened his eyes and revealed a confused look ...
