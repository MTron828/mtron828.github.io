“I know ...” Zhou Yuan’s neck shrunk and he left the club as if he was flying, not even daring to look back.

It could be seen that Zhou Yuan was truly afraid of Zhou leiyun.

Zhou leiyun smiled bitterly and said to Xia ruofei,””President Xia, I’m really sorry ... My family is unfortunate! In Zhou Yuan’s generation, he was the only male in our family, but he was a hopeless case! My big brother and I have been so worried about this child! Please forgive me! Please bear with me ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Chairman Zhou, it’s really not that serious. It was just a few words. Why would I take it to heart?” They were all young people, so it was normal to have a bit of a temper! We’ll just educate them properly ...”

For Zhao Yongjun’s sake, Xia ruofei wouldn’t argue with Zhou leiyun over such a small matter. Besides, this had nothing to do with Zhou leiyun. As for Zhou Yuan, although Xia ruofei had put it nicely with Zhou leiyun, he actually understood that Zhou leiyun and Qianqian were born with a silver spoon in their mouths. They had never suffered much since they were young, which resulted in their low emotional intelligence.

“Yeah!” Zhou leiyun forced a smile. You are all young people, but Zhou Yuan, this child ... Sigh! If he’s half as good as President Xia, my brother and I will wake up laughing in our dreams!”

After sighing, Zhou leiyun said,””Let’s not talk about him! President Xia, thank you for your magnanimity for today! I’ll buy you a drink when I have the chance!”

“Then I’ll thank you in advance, Chairman Zhou!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“You’re welcome! You’re too polite!” Zhou leiyun said,”director Xia, I won’t disturb you and your friends anymore. I’ll go over there and take a look!”

“Please do as you wish, Chairman Zhou!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

After Zhou leiyun left, Xia ruofei saw that Ling Yun was still standing at the side. He couldn’t help but ask,””Young master Ling, is there anything else?”

Ling Yun was actually a little stunned when he saw how humble Zhou leiyun was in front of Xia ruofei.

Zhou leiyun’s business empire could be ranked at least in the top ten of China’s private enterprises. The influence of the head of such a giant company could not be underestimated. It could be said that although those second and third generation rich Playboys were all first and second to him, they still did not dare to act rashly in front of Zhou leiyun.

Even though Ling Yun had heard many legends about Xia ruofei, they were all hearsay. Today, he had witnessed this shocking scene with his own eyes. His heart was in turmoil.

Ling Yun only came back to his senses after Xia ruofei finished speaking.

“Oh ... I’m fine!” He quickly replied. He was fine! President Xia, I just wanted to explain the misunderstanding earlier ... Zhou Yuan wanted to get to know Wei Wei, so he insisted on me bringing him here ... I didn’t expect this guy ...”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”young master Ling, this matter is already in the past. I don’t take it to heart.” But ... Since you are Zhou Yuan’s friend, then you should go back and advise him to keep a low profile. If it wasn’t for me today, and it was a narrow – minded person, wouldn’t he be bringing hatred to his family for no reason? No matter how big glory world Corporation is, it’s still a private enterprise. Don’t cause trouble for glory world Corporation because of him. ”

“Well said, President Xia!” Ling Yun quickly replied,”this is simply bitter medicine! I will definitely pass on your words, and I believe that Zhou Yuan will definitely remember them. ”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I hope so too ...”

Seeing that Xia ruofei had no intention of talking to him, Ling Yun thought for a while and said,””President Xia, Weiwei, I have a friend who’s here too. I won’t disturb you guys then ...”

“Take care, young master Ling!” Xia ruofei said,”let’s have a good time here today. At the same time, I hope that you members can give us more valuable advice!”

“I will! I will!” Ling Yun said hurriedly.

Song Wei nodded her head slightly and did not say anything.

Ling Yun nodded at Xia ruofei and the rest in acknowledgment before walking towards the entrance of the banquet hall.

After Ling Yun returned to the capital, he had made quite a few friends. There were also many who came today. He went to the door to say hello, mainly to leave a good impression on Xia ruofei. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

After the outsiders had left, Zhuo Yiyi, who had been watching the show, came forward with a smile and said,””Wei Wei, you’re becoming more and more attractive! Even Zhou Yuan fell in love with you at first sight, hehe ...”

Song Wei playfully pinched the soft flesh on Zhuo Yiyi’s waist and said,””Wretched girl, I’ll let you gloat!”

Zhuo Yiyi was extremely ticklish, and she hurriedly waved her hands to beg for mercy.

Ling Qingxue glanced at Xia ruofei with a half – Smile, then asked with interest,””Yiyi, is this Zhou Yuan very famous?”

“It’s glory world Corporation, it’s very famous! A private group with a scale of hundreds of billions!” Zhuo Yiyi said,”didn’t that Chairman Zhou just say it? He’s the only male heir in their family, and he’s very likely to be the heir to glory world Corporation in the future!”

Ling Qingxue pouted and said,”that idiot?” If he really inherits glory world Corporation, he’ll lose everything in a few years!”

Ling Qingxue’s family also ran a business, and Ling Qingxue herself was also an elite in the business management. Towards a rich second generation like Zhou Yuan, who was ignorant and incompetent, she looked down on him from the bottom of her heart.

Although glory world Corporation was a giant on a large scale, if the helmsman did not deserve it, the possibility of this super – ship sinking was still very high. Moreover, if there was a crisis, the large glory world Corporation was like a piece of fat meat. Those who had their eyes on this fat meat would definitely rush forward and start a feast to divide the benefits.
