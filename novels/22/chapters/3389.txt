Xia ruofei’s eyes widened slightly and he said,””There’s internet signal here?”

Ling Qingxue rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei and said,”Uncle, there’s a function called cache, okay? Don’t tell me you don’t even know this?”

Xia ruofei patted his forehead and said,””I’m a little dizzy from all the work, the electricity…”

Just as he said that, Xia ruofei immediately waved his hand and said,”It must be a power bank, right?”

“You’re smart!” Ling Qingxue said.

“Alright then!” Xia ruofei said,”actually, I’m just curious. On our long journey to the moon, you still haven’t finished the drama series you saved. How much did you save?”

Ling Qingxue pouted and said,”none of your business!” Hurry up and go learn your array!”

With that, Ling Qingxue pushed Xia ruofei in the direction of the stone pillar array.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I’ll walk by myself!” I’ll walk on my own! Don’t push me…”

Xia ruofei directly stepped on the qushuang flying sword and flew into the stone pillar array. He found a place and sat down cross – legged, then released his spiritual power and began to slowly study this exquisite array.

Previously, due to the time limit of the mission, Xia ruofei could not study it in depth. He only had a superficial understanding of the array patterns on most of the stone pillars. After figuring out the general function, he immediately turned to study the other stone pillars.

Now that the mission was completed, Xia ruofei could study it slowly without any pressure. Naturally, this feeling was much better than before.

Xia ruofei calmed himself down and felt that the formation patterns on the stone pillars were extremely mysterious. He was beaming with joy and his hands couldn’t help but move around. His mind was spinning quickly as he compared the information contained in the formation patterns with the formation theories he had previously grasped. He instantly felt that he had benefited a lot.

As Xia ruofei studied the stone pillars one by one, the function of the stone pillar array became clearer.

It was because he had a deeper understanding of this formation that Xia ruofei felt its profoundness.

Xia ruofei, who was immersed in the study of formations, did not notice the passage of time. On the fifth floor of the trial Pagoda, there was no change in day and night. Even Ling Qingxue, who was sitting outside the formation and watching dramas out of boredom, did not know how long Xia ruofei had been inside.

The puzzle of the stone pillar formation in Xia ruofei’s mind was getting more complete, and his reading speed was getting faster.

Of course, this was also related to the fact that his array Dao level had been constantly improving during the research process.

Finally, Xia ruofei slowly stood up, his eyes shining with surprise.

The complexity of this stone pillar array was beyond his imagination. After understanding the principle and function of this array, he was also amazed.

This stone pillar array was actually an array that aided cultivation.

Xia ruofei couldn’t imagine that such a complicated formation was not used to kill or trap enemies, but to assist in cultivation.

The complexity of this stone pillar array was not an appropriate example. If the arrays that Xia ruofei had mastered in the past were a household computer, then this array was definitely a supercomputer. It was one of the world’s leading supercomputers.

It was too extravagant to use such a formation to aid his cultivation.

Xia ruofei was considered one of the richest people in the cultivation world. Some sects might not even have as many cultivation resources as Xia ruofei even after a hundred years of accumulation. However, when he saw this array, he could not help but be shocked.

Of course, the function of such a formation that assisted cultivation was naturally not just to simply gather spiritual Qi.

Xia ruofei had yet to fully understand the function and principle of the formation, but the parts that he could analyze had already made him secretly admire Qianqian. If his judgment was correct, when the formation was truly activated, not only would it gather a large amount of spiritual energy, it would also have many auxiliary functions. For example, it would automatically train the body of the cultivator within the formation. If one cultivated in the formation for a long time, one’s body would be unconsciously trained. In Xia ruofei’s eyes, this function was already quite heaven – defying.

In addition, from the current array patterns, this array could also nourish the spiritual body of the cultivator inside the array and play a role in promoting the growth of spiritual power. Take Xia ruofei, who was in the Golden core stage, as an example. When he cultivated in the formation, his spiritual power would grow several times faster than when he did not have the formation.

Although it wasn’t as fast, simple, and crude as directly absorbing the yellow jade essence, it won in the long run, and it didn’t need to consume any cultivation resources. It was enough to just activate the formation, so the consumption was naturally much less.

Other than tempering the physical body and nourishing the spirit body, this formation had many other auxiliary functions.

For example, the effect of calming one’s heart. In the array, the cultivator could focus his mind faster and greatly reduce the risk of heart demon invasion, which greatly reduced the probability of Qi deviation.

In addition, cultivators ‘thoughts would be more agile in the array. They might not be able to understand the content after reading it a few times, but they could quickly understand it in the array.

Xia ruofei looked at the stone pillar array, his heart full of admiration and envy. It seemed that before the deterioration of the environment, the cultivation world really had many resources that the current cultivators could not even imagine. If such an array was placed in a sect and maintained for a long time, it would be of great help to the sect’s disciples when they cultivated.

Xia ruofei admired the mysterious array for a while longer before he had an idea. He waved at Ling Qingxue and shouted,””Qingxue, come in for a moment!”

Hearing that, Ling Qingxue put the tablet and power bank into her storage ring, then walked straight into the stone pillar array.

“What’s wrong?” Ling Qingxue asked.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”come, come, come!” Sit down first! 1 called you over because 1 want you to experience this awesome formation up close.”

Ling Qingxue didn’t know whether to laugh or cry as she said,”but 1 don’t know anything about arrays!” No matter how close you are, you still can’t understand it.”

Xia ruofei smiled.’Tt doesn’t matter if you don’t understand it. You’ll use it, right?”

“Ah? What do you mean?” Ling Qingxue asked.

“You’ve guessed it, right?” Xia ruofei chuckled.’Tm almost done studying this array. It’s time for you to enjoy it…”

With that, Xia ruofei took out a handful of spiritual crystals from the spirit map space. With a wave of his hand, the spiritual crystals flew out and landed accurately in each groove that he had marked. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

As for the star Fern thorn soul essence that was embedded in the stone pillar, Xia ruofei did not understand what it was used for and what effect it would have if it was placed in an array. Hence, he decided to ignore it for the time being.

Xia ruofei briefly explained some of the characteristics of the formation to Ling Qingxue. After listening to it, Ling Qingxue was also secretly speechless. Xia ruofei took a deep breath, formed a hand seal, and waved his hand.

When the technique was inserted into the stone pillar at the core of the array, the stone pillar array began to glow. Xia ruofei could clearly feel that his mind was clearer. This was obviously the effect of the calming heart function.

Xia ruofei felt the operation of the formation for a while, then smiled and said,””Qingxue, sit down and cultivate for a while!”

He could feel that the spiritual Qi was also gathering towards the array, and this was only using the lowest level of spiritual crystals. This array could only be activated with spiritual crystals at the very least, and there were not enough spiritual stones at all. And using Origin crystals or even more precious concentrated energy, the effect of the formation would naturally be much better.

Ling Qingxue had always listened to Xia ruofei. She immediately sat down cross – legged and started to cultivate quietly in the stone pillar array.

Xia ruofei sat down as well. As he circulated the great Dao technique, he took out the energy storage Pearl and started to slowly pour in his energy..
