After Li Yifu heard this, he couldn’t help but ask,””Grand uncle – Master, if you ask him to increase the price of the information at this time, will Wang Boshan give up on this line? We’ll have to rely on this chess piece to set up a trap for Wang Boshan in the future. ”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Wang Boshan will only believe it even more!” Money was nothing to them. As long as the information was real and useful, they would agree to double the price without hesitation. “I let bynilati answer this way to better fit his character. After all, he’s a greedy person. Only then will Wang Boshan believe the information provided by bynilati without a doubt.”

“Yes! This disciple understands!” Li Yifu said.

He saw that Xia ruofei had thought it through, so he did not say anything more.

At first, Li Yifu was worried that Xia ruofei was still young and inexperienced, so he would make mistakes when planning. Now, it seemed that his worry was unnecessary. Xia ruofei seemed to have a plan in mind.

Xia ruofei turned to look at bainilatti and said,””Very good! It seems that you have really taken my words to heart! These two days, you have to constantly review and consolidate. No matter what questions Wang Boshan asks, you must be able to deal with them calmly. Also, once Wang Boshan really contacts you, you must not be nervous. Otherwise, no matter how strong it is usually, it’ll be a mess when it’s actually used. That’ll be a big problem!”

“Master, don’t worry! I’m just being myself, there won’t be any problems!” Benilatti smiled and said,”when dealing with Wang Boshan and the others, I have always been the one taking the initiative. I was the one who suggested increasing the price for the information a few times and they agreed to it in the end. I don’t think there will be any accidents this time.”

Xia ruofei thought to himself,”this person really loves money as much as his life!” In front of a cultivator, doing this was simply courting death! Fortunately, Wang Boshan and the rest really needed information on bainilatti, and there was no one who could replace bainilatti for the time being. Otherwise, this kid would have been killed by Wang Boshan and the rest.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”it’s good that you’re not nervous!” Alright, you can go!”

“Yes, Mr. Xia!” Bainilatti said respectfully.

Then, he obediently ran to the corner of the warehouse and sat down. This was the resting area that Xia ruofei had specially designated for him. When he had nothing to do during the day, he could only stay in that corner to avoid affecting the preparation work here.

Li Yifu looked at bainilatti and asked in a low voice,””Martial granduncle, is this person really reliable? After all, he had sold out information about you ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand.”Foster husband, don’t worry about this. I can guarantee that he’s 100% reliable!” You should have more confidence in me!”

“Senior granduncle, don’t misunderstand. I’m just worried ... Since you’ve said so, this disciple naturally believes you!” Li Yifu quickly said. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”anyway, you don’t have to worry about his loyalty. But you still can’t let him leave your sight. Even if you want to leave the warehouse, you have to take him with you. This is not to guard against him, but I’m worried that if Wang Boshan really contacts him, he will be a little guilty and nervous. If anything happens, you have to make up for it in time, understand?”

“Yes! Senior granduncle!” Li Yifu quickly replied, then said,”they’ve already sent breakfast over! Would you like to rest for a while or have a meal now?”

Li Yifu also saw that Xia ruofei had stayed up for two nights, so he wanted to let Xia ruofei sleep for a while.

Xia ruofei said,”it’s already dawn, why should I sleep?” Besides, there’s still a pile of things waiting for me! How can I sleep? Don’t worry! I’m already at refined Qi level 9, what’s the big deal with staying up a few nights?”

“Senior granduncle, you’ve worked hard!” Li Yifu said.

“Let’s go and eat something!” Xia ruofei said.

Li Yifu laid out the breakfast, and Xia ruofei called benilatti over for breakfast. However, how could benilatti dare to sit at the same table as the host? He came over and took two buns and a youtiao, then ran to the corner of the warehouse where his “exclusive area” was.

After Xia ruofei and Li Yifu finished their breakfast, Li Yifu cleaned up and said,””Martial granduncle, last night, I contacted a group of brothers from the Hong sect. Now, there are about 50 to 60 people who have started to gather in Australia. I asked Yi Tian to prepare a passenger charter flight for me. They will arrive at Paradise Island tonight at the earliest.”

“He’s fast!” Xia ruofei said happily,”adopted husband, you’ve done well!”

“Many thanks for the praise, senior granduncle!” Li Yifu said,”the first group is mainly the brothers from the Australian Hong sect. Yitian also helped me a lot in Australia. Some of the members in this group were also selected by him. Oh right, he said that you should know the person leading the group. It’s his nephew, ah Hu!”

“It’s Tang Hu!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I’ve dealt with him a few times! This kid’s skills are not bad, and he’s also very loyal, so it’s suitable for him to lead the team. ”

“You can rest assured about the people Yi Tian has arranged.” Li Yifu said,”great uncle – Master, the first batch of people has about 20 full – time security personnel. The other 30 people are experienced in construction, and more than 10 of them can operate all kinds of construction machinery. With this group of people, our modification project can start first!”

“Very good!” Xia ruofei said,”I’ve just finished the layout. I’ll tell you the construction drawings later!”

“Yes! Senior granduncle!” Li Yifu said,”I also recruited a group from the United States, about 50 people. They might arrive a day later.”

“Very good!” Xia ruofei said,”after these people arrive, I’ll go through a screening. If they don’t meet the requirements, it may not be that they are not loyal, but they may not meet our requirements in other aspects. In short, after screening, I will not keep any of them. ”

“Alright! Don’t worry, senior granduncle! They won’t have any complaints, whether they stay or leave!” Li Yifu said.

He was the elder leader of the Hong sect, and Tang Yitian had a very high position in the Hong sect, especially in the Australian Hong sect. If they came out personally, the loyalty of these brothers would not be a problem. Even if they didn’t meet the requirements, they wouldn’t have any complaints if they were asked to go back. Instead, they might blame themselves.

Xia ruofei then put the construction plan that he had spent an entire night drafting on the wooden box table and started to explain it to Li Yifu one by one.

As for the formation, Xia ruofei did not take it out.

With Li Yifu’s array formation skills, even if he took it out, he would not be able to understand it, especially some of the symbols on it that were created by Xia ruofei. If he did not explain, Li Yifu would not be able to understand.

Li Yifu listened very carefully. If there was anything he didn’t understand, he would immediately ask Yingluo. He knew that he was responsible for the follow – up construction. If he pretended to understand at this time, it would be a great sin if there were any problems during the construction.

Xia ruofei spent about an hour explaining the construction plan to Li Yifu in detail.

In fact, the difficulty of construction was not high, and it was not very complicated. The real difficulty in activating the array was in the array board, Jade pillars, and the confirmation of those positions. Except for the point on the cliff wall, the other places were not difficult to construct.

Xia ruofei did not plan to let Li Yifu’s construction team complete the reconstruction of the entire building at the point on the cliff and the point next to the mercenary group’s station. The workload might be a little heavy and they would have to rely on construction machinery. However, if it was just two points, Xia ruofei could easily complete them himself.

After explaining the construction plan, Xia ruofei went to the engineering department building without stopping to ask Liu Qingfeng to draw up the list of the second batch of people to return to China – the small number of people who were finally decided to stay would be screened by Xia ruofei today.
