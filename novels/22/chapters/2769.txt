2770 Company affairs (2)

After Feng Rao heard this, she waved her hand and said,”The shares you’ve given me are enough, and my salary is higher than many CEOs in the world’s top 500. I’m already taking too much.”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”compared to sister Che’s efforts, I think the company’s return is still not enough.” I have my own plans for this matter. I haven’t thought about how many shares I’ll give you yet, but you’re not allowed to refuse!”

Although Xia ruofei’s tone was gentle, Feng Jing could feel that there was no room for doubt. Even if she was a “Iron Lady” in the company, she couldn’t help but nod after hearing Xia ruofei’s words, even if it didn’t fit her values.

Xia ruofei immediately said,”since you’ve agreed, it’s settled. When I have time, I’ll get this done!”

Feng Jing snapped out of her daze. She didn’t know why she had agreed so readily. According to her temper, even if Xia ruofei was the boss, even if he was giving her money, as long as it didn’t match her value, she would firmly refuse. However, she seemed to be possessed today. It was too strange.

Xia ruofei chuckled to himself. In reality, he had done a little trick. It was just a small application of spiritual hypnosis. Feng Jing was just an ordinary person. Naturally, she had fallen into his trap without realizing it.

Words that had been spoken were like water that had been spilled. Feng Jing couldn’t immediately go back on her words, so she could only reply with a confused expression,””Then we’ll talk about it later ...”

Feng Jing decided not to think about it for the time being. After all, Xia ruofei wasn’t going to transfer the shares to her immediately.

She thought for a while and said,”ruofei, there are two more things that are related to you personally. That’s why I didn’t say it directly at the meeting today. If you have time now, I will report it to you.”

Xia ruofei looked at his watch and said,””There’s still a little time. Sister che, you can tell me!”

Xia ruofei’s main purpose today was to make a trip to his warehouse in the city. On one hand, he wanted to receive the wine from the winery, and at the same time, hand over the processed Drunken Eight Immortals wine to the winery. On the other hand, it was naturally to take out the raw materials from the space, so that Xue Jinshan’s pharmaceutical factory would have rice to put into the pot.

If he hadn’t made an appointment with the winery in advance, he would have plenty of time today. But now, he couldn ‘T. He had to get to the warehouse in advance and take the wine out of the space.

However, today’s meeting was very fast, so he should still have about half an hour.

Feng Rao nodded and said,””Then I’ll make it short. “The first thing is about the Spanish clubs. They hope to sign a strategic cooperation agreement with our company. The two sides will form a deep cooperation in brand promotion, product promotion, and other aspects. Considering the special relationship between you and this club, as well as their hopes of competing in the European arena next season, after our president’s office has studied it, we are inclined to agree to this proposal. Of course, this all depends on you to decide. ”

Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows and said,”European war?” Did Spain have a chance to enter the European tournament? I thought they weren’t leading by that much?”

The last time Xia ruofei helped Espanyol with Valencia, he scored three brilliant goals and helped Espanyol beat her by a narrow margin of four to three. After that, he left Spain and returned to China. He remembered that Espanyol’s situation at that time could only be said to be more optimistic about their chances of staying in the league. They were still quite far from the European region!

Feng Rao was speechless.””You are also one of the shareholders of Espanyol! How much do you not care about your team!”

Ever since Xia ruofei played in the match between Espanyol and Valencia, many people in paradise Corporation had become fans of Espanyol. The Spanish football Association was also very generous by adjusting the kick – off time for Espanyol’s subsequent matches. It was basically at noon local time, which was around 7 or 8 p.m. In China, and the latest was around 11 p.m. For those who watched the game, this was considered the prime time. Their viewership ratings in China naturally increased greatly, and their influence also increased greatly. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Therefore, many people in paradise Corporation knew about the current points, ranking, and future trends of the Spanish team like the back of their hands. Feng Jing did not expect Xia ruofei to not pay attention to the Spanish team’s situation at all, and she could not help but laugh.

Xia ruofei scratched his head and smiled awkwardly.””Didn’t I just say it? I’ve been really busy recently ...”

He had been busy with the construction of peach source Island, activating the Taixu xuanqing formation, and taking in Aurous core stage cultivators as his servants. In comparison, he naturally did not care about the results of the La Liga club that he had invested in out of interest.

Feng Rao shook her head.”With your help, they won against Valencia. The Spanish team’s momentum is like a rainbow. They won the next two rounds in a row. The rankings of the lower – tier teams in La Liga have always been in a stalemate, so they are only four points away from the European region. With seven rounds left in the league, the four – point gap is not that big. Of course, this is on the premise that bar?a has a high chance of winning the Kings ‘cup. As long as they catch up with this gap, they can get a place in the UEFA Europa League qualification. ”

Feng Rao was not a fan of Espanyol, but she knew so much about the situation of Espanyol. It was clear that she had done her homework after the Espanyol club had sent out their intention to cooperate.

She had to admit that Feng Jing was a very serious and responsible person at work.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”the owner of the Spanish team is a good person. He has a good eye and a good personality. Just based on this, we can deepen our cooperation with them. As for whether they can enter the European tournament next season, it doesn’t matter much.” I agree to it!”

Feng Jing had already guessed that Xia ruofei would give her this answer. She smiled and nodded.”In fact, the strategic cooperation is also very simple. The initial plan is that our company will launch a customized version of tea leaves, Cordyceps, and other products from the Spanish clubs, as well as the Jade skin cream that is very popular abroad. They hope to design a special version with the Spanish club’s badge. As for the Spanish clubs, they will hang our company’s LOGO on the home stadium, the peripheral product stores, and other occasions, and indicate our strategic partners. At the same time, they will also give us a certain refund discount for advertisements on the chest of their jerseys. ”

Xia ruofei nodded without hesitation.””No problem! It won’t cost much and it’s a win – win situation. Agree to them!”

“Alright!” Feng Ye paused and continued,”in addition, Spain also proposed that in order to increase the probability of the team entering the European zone, they hope that you ... Can represent the team as much as possible in the remaining rounds of the league tournament this season, if conditions allow.”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.””So you were waiting for me here! I was wondering why they suddenly wanted to work with us on some strategic collaboration!”

“Who asked you to be so eye – catching in that match?” Feng Rao pursed her lips and smiled. A lot of fans are protesting on RCD Espanyol’s official Weibo. Why did President Xia, who performed so well, not make it into the squad list for several games in a row?”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh,”it’s all my fault!” How about this ... You can reply to them directly. If I have time, I can play a few games on behalf of RCD Espanyol, but you have to contact me at least three days in advance. ”

“Alright!” Feng Rao nodded and said,”in fact, the domestic fans have high hopes for you! The second thing I want to say is also related to this. ”

“You’re not going to let me join the national team, are you?”Xia ruofei couldn’t help but ask.

Feng Rao laughed and said,”you’re right!” The fans spontaneously launched a vote on Weibo, hoping that the national team would draft you. Now, more than 80 million people have participated in the vote, and 99% of the participants have chosen to draft you!”
