Chapter 1124: Yingzi wooden incense cabinet (1)

Translator: 549690339

Pan family’s old goods market was one of the largest antique calligraphy and painting distribution centers in the capital. Every day, countless people went there to search for treasures, dreaming of picking up scraps and becoming rich overnight. Of course, there were also a large number of counterfeits, and even experienced collectors often fell for them.

Xia ruofei had been thinking of visiting the capital over the past few days when he had the time. Of course, he wasn’t trying to pick up any treasures, but he was thinking about whether he would be lucky enough to find world stones here.

The world stone, which was extremely precious to him, was just an ordinary black stone in the eyes of ordinary people.

The pan family home had all kinds of strange things every day. Perhaps some small vendors would receive world stones from outside and sell them on their stalls without knowing what they were used for.

Hence, Xia ruofei was still looking forward to it.

The three of them took two separate cars and went directly to pan Jiayuan’s old goods market.

Pan family’s old goods market was located near the South Road of the East Third Ring Road in the capital. It occupied a very large area and was said to have thousands of merchants. In addition, there was a large stall area.

As he walked out of the carpark, Xia ruofei felt a tinge of disappointment. The Jade talisman he was hanging on did not sense the existence of the realm stone. There was not even a trace of heat.

However, pan homeland occupied a large area, and the sensing range of the Jade talisman might not be able to cover the entire area. Besides, he just came here with the mentality of trying his luck. It would be best if he could get something. Even if he didn ‘t, he wouldn’t be too disappointed, and would just treat it as a pastime.

It happened to be the weekend, so the entire market was fully open. There were many people here, and it was as bustling as a temple fair.

After entering the door, the three of them walked all the way in. Xia ruofei also had an intuitive understanding of the mix of good and bad in pan Jiayuan.

In just a short distance of one to two hundred meters, Xia ruofei had the Fortune to see a few “Yuan blue and white porcelain”, as well as Xuande furnaces, chicken mugs, and many other things. There were also a large number of “authentic works” by Zheng Banqiao and Qi Baishi ...

As for the authenticity of these things, it was self – evident.

Along the way, he often heard the vendors telling all kinds of bizarre stories to the Taobao customers, such as Ci Xi’s personal eunuch secretly bringing her out of the palace, or relatives from the countryside who happened to dig up an ancient grave and find her. These vendors even deliberately lowered their voices, looking mysterious.

70% story 30% treasure. If an antique didn’t have a few twists and turns, it would be embarrassing to sell it.

There were also some relatively crude conspiracies, such as pretending to be a buyer and offering a high price to make them want to buy, or deliberately quarreling with the stall owner and “customers”, accidentally revealing the information of the treasure, and so on.

Zhao Yongjun was obviously a regular at pan garden. He was very familiar with these tricks to fool tourists. He explained to Xia ruofei as they walked.

Xia ruofei did not have the intention to take advantage of the situation, so he just laughed it off and treated it as a show.

Soon, the three of them passed through the street stall area and came to the commercial area. There were shops on both sides of the street, most of which were decorated in an ancient style, and their names were also quite ancient.

These shops also sold a variety of goods, such as the Four Treasures of the Study, ancient books, calligraphy and paintings, old books and magazines, antiques and Jade, bamboo bone carvings, religious tokens, and so on. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Although Xia ruofei did not enter the shop, he felt that it was an eye – opening experience to see the dazzling array of products.

After a while, Zhao Yongjun led Xia ruofei and song Rui to the entrance of an antique shop called Boya shop. Zhao Yongjun should be very familiar with this place. He greeted a young man at the door who was recruiting customers and led Xia ruofei and song Rui straight in.

Zhao Yongjun didn’t stop at the shop. He walked straight through the hall and went up to the second floor from the stairs at the back.

The second floor’s decorations were very ancient. There were all kinds of calligraphy and paintings, plaques, hanging screens, bonsai, porcelain, antiques, screens, antique shelves, and so on. It looked very elegant. A large number of mahogany materials were used in the decorations, and the colors were also full of nobility.

Zhao Yongjun was very familiar with this place. He shouted as soon as he went upstairs,””Qiang Zi! What good stuff did you find this time?”

On the second floor, there were two large windows facing the street. Several people were sitting around the root – carved teahouse next to the windows. They immediately turned their heads when they heard Zhao Yongjun’s voice.

One of the men in his early thirties immediately showed a warm smile when he saw Zhao Yongjun. He stood up and greeted him respectfully,””Brother Jun, you’re here!”

The others also greeted him.

Zhao Yongjun nodded his head and said,””Qiangzi, I’ve brought two good Brothers to join in the fun. This is Xia ruofei, and this is song Rui!”

Then, Zhao Yongjun turned to Xia ruofei and song Rui and said,””He’s the boss of Boya house, Xu Qiang. You can call him Qiang Zi.”

Xia ruofei smiled and said to Xu Qiang,””Boss Xu, nice to meet you!”

Song Rui also nodded lightly.

“I’m flattered. Young master Xia, young master Song, you can just call me Qiang Zi,”Xu Qiang quickly said.

Xu Qiang was in his early thirties and was older than Xia ruofei and song Rui. However, in front of them, Xu Qiang didn’t dare to show any neglect.

Although Zhao Yongjun was a forthright person and had many friends in the antique circle, he hardly called anyone his good brother. Xia ruofei and song Rui were obviously extraordinary, so Xu Qiang knew that they were most likely young masters in the upper – Class circle of the capital, just like Zhao Yongjun.
