Lu You and Jiang Yue couldn’t help but smile when they saw Xia ruofei’s Rascal – like behavior. Peng Hui and you Jun looked at Xia ruofei with strange expressions. They felt that this “expert Xia” was not reliable at all. Chen Song was so angry that his face and ears turned red. He coldly snorted and said,”I can’t be bothered to say so much to a layman like you!” After saying that, Chen Song looked at Lu You and said,””Junior, I know that this pot of orchids is yours and you have the right to make the decision. However, the Jade lion is very precious, so I hope that you can consider it carefully. Although my judgment just now may be wrong, I’m a major in this field. Give me some time and I’ll definitely find the real cause!” Lu You smiled faintly.”Thank you. However, since Xia ruofei said that he can cure this orchid, then he can definitely cure it. So, I won’t trouble you.” “You guys ...” Chen Song was speechless. In his opinion, this was simply child’s play! Chen song’s expression was also somewhat unhappy. He looked at Peng Hui and said: “Peng Hui, since they don’t need me here, then I’ll be going back!” “Senior brother Chen, please wait a moment ...” Peng Hui quickly said. Peng Hui then looked into Xia ruofei’s eyes and asked,””Mr. Xia, you promised me just now. I want to know what will happen if you can’t cure this jade lion?” “If it can’t be cured, then it can’t be cured!” Jiang Yue immediately rushed to say,”this pot of orchids belongs to Youyou and me. We don’t mind. What can you do about it?” Peng Hui’s expression froze while you Jun’s face turned ashen. Even a fool could tell that Jiang Yue’s heart was completely attached to Xia ruofei. No matter who it was, as long as they revealed any ill – intent towards Xia ruofei, she would immediately step out to defend them. Just as Peng Hui was about to use the name of the gardening club as an excuse, Xia ruofei had already smiled and waved at Jiang Yue, saying,””Jiang Yue, it’s alright. Since I’ve already said it, I’ll definitely cure this potted flower.” After that, Xia ruofei asked,””What time is the flower exhibition that you’re going to attend?” “Big brother Xia,” Jiang Yue immediately replied,”the exhibition will be held next Wednesday. According to the usual practice, we will send the flowers and plants for exhibition to the venue for decorations on Tuesday.” Xia ruofei calculated and said,””That means there are still six days. How about this, give me three days. Three days later, I’ll return you a pot of healthy Mo Lan.” “Mr. Xia, your arrogance ... Uh ... Sorry, it’s self – confidence ... We’ve all seen your self – confidence, but you haven’t told us what you’ll do if you can’t be cured?” Peng Hui said with a fake smile. Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”can’t be cured?” If you can’t cure it, I’ll compensate you with a pot of orchids, and its value will definitely not be lower than this pot of Jade Lions!” “Big words!” You Jun immediately shouted when he heard this. Do you know how much this pot of jade lion is worth? Even Peng Hui might not be able to afford it, and you’re saying that you’ll pay for it with a big grin, can you afford it?” Jiang Yue’s eyebrows shot up and she subconsciously prepared to refute you Jun. However, this time, Lu You spoke first. She said indifferently,””If Xia ruofei can’t afford it, then no one else in this house can!” When Lu You said this, Peng Hui and the other two took a deep breath at the same time. Then, they sized Xia ruofei up with a strange look. Xia ruofei did not have the hobby of pursuing luxury brands. He usually wore clothes that were comfortable, so he seemed ordinary to Peng Hui and the others. Especially when Peng Hui came from a well – to – do family and was covered in branded goods, he would naturally have a sense of superiority when he saw Xia ruofei. However, from what Lu You said, this ‘expert Xia’ seemed to be quite rich. In fact, he was even richer than Peng Hui. After Lu You finished speaking, she no longer paid attention to Peng Hui and the rest. She directly said,””It’s decided! Xia ruofei, I’ll leave this pot of orchid to you. I don’t care what method you use, just help me cure it. ” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”no problem!” I’ll bring it back first and send it back in three days. ” “Mm! “Thank you ...” Lu You nodded and said. Jiang Yue also smiled sweetly at Xia ruofei and said,””Thank you, brother Xia!” “You’re welcome,” Xia ruofei said with a smile. Peng Hui coldly snorted and said: “In that case, let’s wait for three days to witness master Xia’s miraculous skills! We’ll be coming over with the students from the Garden Club ...” Chen Song also stared at Xia ruofei and said with a fake smile,””I’m also very curious about master Xia’s methods. I’ll come and join in the fun three days later ...” After that, the three of them no longer asked for a rebuff and left the gardening club. After Peng Hui and the rest left, Jiang Yue asked worriedly,””Brother Xia, are you really confident? Didn’t you just say that you’ve never raised orchids before?” “I’ve never raised an orchid before!” “Then why did you ...” Jiang Yue could not help but ask anxiously. Lu You looked at Jiang Yue speechlessly and said,”Yueyue, why are you worried about him? He used to be a soldier and had never grown vegetables before! Didn’t you still grow the Paradise vegetables?” Xia ruofei replied innocently,”I don’t think so!” I’ve grown vegetables for two months in the new recruits ...” “I can’t be bothered with you!” Lu You rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei and said,”let’s go, let’s go ... Don’t forget to return us a pot of healthy Molan in three days!” I don’t want to see Peng Hui and the others “smug faces!” Xia ruofei grinned and said,”don’t worry!” It’s just a few wimpy kids, their expressions will be very interesting when the time comes. ” With that, Xia ruofei walked over and picked up the pot of orchid. He left the gardening club with Lu You and Jiang Yue. When they arrived at the parking lot downstairs, Xia ruofei placed Mo Lan on the mat of the front passenger seat of the pickup truck. Then, he closed the door and went around to the other side of the driver’s seat to get in. He rolled down the window and stuck his head out.”Lu You, Jiang Yue,” he said.”I’ll go back first then!” Lu You nodded, while Jiang Yue said gratefully,””Thank you, brother Xia!” Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand. Then, he started the car and stepped on the gas, leaving the old teaching building. He originally wanted to look for Ling Qingxue, but after thinking about it, he figured that Ling Qingxue was probably still sulking. If he were to visit her now, he would be asking for a snub, so he decided to drive straight back to Peach Blossom Farm. Xia ruofei had kept the orchid in the new space on the way. After returning to his room in the farm villa, he took out the Molan and took out a bottle of petal solution from his space. He watered a portion of the Molan’s roots and then put the rest of the petal solution into the watering can. He sprayed a lot of the petal solution on the Molan’s petals and mutated leaves. After that, Xia ruofei put Mo Lan into the original space where time was 30 times slower than the outside world and left her alone. …… In the blink of an eye, three days had passed. Xia ruofei drove to Sanshan University with the pot of orchid. When his car arrived in front of the old teaching building, he realized that other than Lu You and Jiang Yue, there were more than a dozen students waiting downstairs. Among them were Peng Hui, you Jun, and Chen Song, whom he had met three days ago. There were also eight or nine students he did not recognize. They were probably students from the gardening club. As soon as Xia ruofei’s car stopped, Jiang Yue quickly came forward and asked,””Brother Xia, how is it?”
