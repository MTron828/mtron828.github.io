Rapid progress

After song Qiming’s body had been transformed by the heart-concentrating grass, his talent in cultivation was indeed very good. It was even beyond Xia ruofei’s expectations.

After a short break, song Qiming could not wait to sit cross-legged on the yoga mat.

This time, Xia ruofei did not use hypnosis to guide song Qiming. In the end, song Qiming only took five minutes to enter a state of concentration and complete oblivion. He could also sense the spiritual Qi around his body.

Of course, after the first successful experience of sensing spiritual energy, the success rate of the second attempt would be much higher.

However, song Qiming’s high efficiency still surprised Xia ruofei.

Without much hesitation, he started guiding song Qiming to try and absorb the spiritual Qi.

In the beginning, the spiritual essence was like a naughty child, not listening to his command at all. However, after more than ten minutes of trying, song Qiming seemed to have gradually found the way. After the first wisp of spirit Qi was successfully absorbed into his body, everything after that became very smooth.

Xia ruofei did not use his genuine Qi to guide song Qiming. Instead, he chose to give him verbal guidance and let song Qiming try to control the spiritual Qi to flow in the correct Meridian route.

Of course, song Qiming had never come into contact with the knowledge of the human body’s meridians before. Therefore, it was not easy for him to make the spiritual Qi flow through the meridians accurately.

However, Xia ruofei was constantly using his spiritual power to sense the situation of the spiritual energy in song Qiming’s body. As long as there was a slight deviation, he would immediately give a warning.

Even though this method was a little inefficient, it would leave a deeper impression on song Qiming.

After a while, song Qiming finally controlled the wisp of spiritual Qi and followed Xia ruofei’s instructions to complete a full circulation in his body.

Because the amount of spiritual Qi absorbed was very little, and the process of circulation was not very coherent, so more than half of it dissipated during the circulation, and only a very small part successfully returned to the dantian. The true Qi produced in the end was almost unnoticeable.

Even song Qiming himself could not sense the extremely weak true Qi.

Of course, no matter how weak it was, it was genuine Qi and it could not escape Xia ruofei’s spiritual power.

He knew very well that this wisp of weak genuine Qi was like a spark. Song Qiming was on the right path. He believed that it would not take long for this seed of fire to evolve into a raging flame.

With Xia ruofei’s encouragement, song Qiming started the second and third round of attempts.

With each circulation, song Qiming was getting more and more familiar with the meridian route. After five or six circulations, he could control his genuine Qi to complete a full circulation without Xia ruofei’s reminder.

Even though there was still room for improvement in his proficiency, Xia ruofei was already overjoyed at the efficiency.

He had been prepared to come a few more times over the next few days. Now, it seemed like he could finish it in one go. In the future, song Qiming could slowly cultivate on his own.

By nineo’ clock in the evening, song Qiming had already mastered the first level of the modest Sutra without his knowledge.

As he familiarized himself with the route of the first level’s meridians, he also became more and more skilled in controlling spiritual energy. He could basically sense spiritual energy at any time and absorb it very smoothly.

Moreover, a wisp of genuine Qi had appeared in song Qiming’s dantian. It was the reward for completing dozens of Qi circulations that day.

This wisp of true Qi was formed by the weak true Qi that was produced after each Qi circulation. Even song Qiming could feel its existence. At the same time, he felt a warm feeling of expansion in his dantian.

Xia ruofei had a lot of Qi refining cultivation experience now. He immediately realized that song Qiming’s cultivation for the day should have ended.

Haste makes waste. This was an irrefutable truth that was also applicable to cultivation.

“Uncle song,” Xia ruofei said,”when you finish absorbing these nutrients, today’s practice will be over!” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Song Qiming still wanted more. Even though he did not know what cultivation was, the feeling of cultivation was addictive. This was also the reason why many beginners tended to overcultivate.

However, song Qiming believed Xia ruofei’s words. Even though he was a little reluctant, he stopped cultivating after he controlled the last wisp of spiritual energy to complete one circulation.

“RUO Fei, your method is really effective!” Song Qiming looked delighted.”I feel very energetic now. I feel like I have endless energy!” It’s like I’ve returned to my younger days!”

Xia ruofei knew what it felt like to cultivate for the first time. He smiled and said,”Uncle song, this is only the first time. If you keep practicing for one to two hours every day, the effect will be more obvious!”

“Don’t worry!”Song Qiming nodded. Even if you didn’t say it, I would have insisted!”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”I’m not worried that you’ll give up halfway. I’m just afraid that going too far is as bad as not enough.”

“Too much is as bad as not enough?” Song Qiming asked with a frown.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes!” Everything should be done in moderation, and this kind of health – Maintenance method was the same. You should have felt the warmth in your lower abdomen and a feeling of fullness, right?”
