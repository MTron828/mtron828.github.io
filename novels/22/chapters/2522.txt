2523 Reborn (3)

“I’m not a guest, you know!” Xia ruofei said half – jokingly.

“Yes, yes, yes! Look at my brain … You’re the second largest shareholder of the club!” Zhou leiyun quickly said,”then let’s go to the halke training base today and watch our first team’s training! I’ll come and pick you up later!”

“Alright! Then I’ll see you at the hotel!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Wu Lei came out of the shower quickly and said to Xia ruofei,””Brother Xia, I’ll go to the club now!”

Xia ruofei said,”director Zhou will come and pick me up later. I’ll go to the club in the morning to watch your training. Why don’t you come with us?”

Wu Lei shook his head with a smile.”I feel like I have endless energy. So I want to run today. It’s also a warm up.”

The distance from the Grand Central Hotel to the halke Sports City was about five or six kilometers. For any professional football player, such a running distance was naturally no problem. In a top league team, the average distance a player ran in a game was at least nine kilometers or ten kilometers, and the more he ran, the more he could run, the more he could even run eleven or twelve kilometers.Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

However, most people would not choose to run there.

Wu Lei usually took the bus, but today he felt that he could not use up all his energy, and he desperately wanted to run to vent it out.

In fact, this was the feeling of discomfort after a sudden increase in strength. Xia ruofei had experienced it before and naturally understood it. He smiled and said,”no problem!” However, you have to be careful! And … Do You Know the Way?”

Wu Lei showed his phone with a smile and said,””There’s navigation! No problem!”

“Alright! Then you can run!” Xia ruofei said,”remember to save some energy. Don’t wait until the training starts and you’ll be exhausted!”

“Brother Xia, don’t worry! I’ll make the coaching team look at me in a new light during today’s training!” Wu Lei said with confidence.

After Wu Lei had left, Xia ruofei had a buffet breakfast at the hotel restaurant. Then, she waited in the lobby on the first floor for a while before Zhou leiyun arrived at the hotel.

Xia ruofei sat in Zhou leiyun’s nanny van and the two of them arrived at the Halk training base.

The two of them did not let the club’s officials accompany them. They only brought Jiang Xiaochen along to ask him to be a translator when there was a need. The three of them walked from the parking lot to the first team’s training ground.

In addition to the regular training, the first team would also have an internal match in the morning. As the match had just ended yesterday, the training intensity today was not that high. The main focus was to recover. The match was also to let everyone maintain the feeling of a match.

As Zhou leiyun walked forward, he smiled and asked,””President Xia, why did you suddenly want to come and watch the training today?”

Xia ruofei looked at Wu Lei, who was training his passing skills, and said with a smile,””I’ve specially trained Wu Lei, so I’m here today to see how the training is going.”

Zhou leiyun was stunned for a moment before he smiled and said,””It’s only been a day, what can …”

At this point, Zhou leiyun paused. He could not help but look at Xia ruofei and said,””If it was someone else, it would be impossible to change anything in one day, but you, CEO Xia…That might not be the case! I don’t dare to make any promises!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.”Chief Zhou really thinks highly of me! Let’s go! Let’s go and take a look!”
