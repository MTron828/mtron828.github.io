As the car had to be left at the airport, Xia ruofei drove the pickup truck, the Knight of the XI Xi, which was too cool. He was a little worried about leaving it at the airport overnight. Taoyuan farm was about 20 to 30 minutes away from Changping airport by car. After Xia ruofei arrived at the airport, she parked her car in the overnight parking lot and walked to the harbor Hall with her suitcase. She took the escalator to the harbor Hall upstairs. Xia ruofei found a place to sit down in the main hall and took out his phone to call Tian Huilan. “Little Xia, have you arrived?” “Yes, Secretary Tian. I’m at the departure hall now.” Xia ruofei replied. “Okay, I need about 5 minutes. You can wait for me there!” After Xia ruofei hung up the phone, he couldn’t help but click his tongue. Normally, it would take about 40 minutes to get here from the city. As the leader of the Provincial Party Committee, Tian Huilan had to apply for leave from the organization. In other words, not only did she apply for leave in the first place, but she also made the driver race all the way. That was how they could arrive at the airport so quickly. Very quickly, Xia ruofei saw an Audi driving at high speed to the entrance of the departure hall. Tian Huilan did not wait for the Secretary to open the door and opened the door herself to get out. Her new female secretary quickly walked to the trunk and took out a small suitcase, then jogged all the way to catch up with Tian Huilan. Xia ruofei also stood up and went out to welcome him. “Xia, there’s not much time left. We’ll tell you in detail when we get on the plane.” Tian Huilan said directly. “Alright,” he said. A middle – aged man in a suit and leather shoes with a work pass also quickly came up and said,””Secretary Tian, please follow me!” Xia ruofei took note of his work pass. He was the Deputy General Manager of the airport Group. He had three boarding passes in his hand, which meant that he had prepared them in advance. The three of them followed the Vice President to a prepared passage and quickly passed through the security check. The Vice President also showed his work pass and followed them into the restricted area. Then, he quickly led the three people to a boarding gate. From the time Tian Huilan entered the airport to the time the three of them stepped on the boarding bridge, it took less than three minutes. It could be said that they were extremely efficient. Xia ruofei also took a look at the boarding gate and realized that there were only three minutes left before the departure time. Under normal circumstances, the plane should have stopped boarding more than 20 minutes ago. By now, the door should have been closed, or even slid to the runway to wait for departure. In other words, because of Tian Huilan, the flight had been delayed. This made Xia ruofei even more curious about the patient’s identity. Making the plane wait for ten to twenty minutes was an easy task for Tian Huilan. The key was that a high – ranking leader like her usually cherished her reputation very much. For Tian Huilan to do this for this patient, he must be an extremely important person to her. As Xia ruofei thought about this, he did not slow down at all. The three of them soon arrived at the cabin door. The purser personally welcomed them at the door and led the three to the first – Class cabin. After Tian Huilan’s Secretary had settled their luggage, she respectfully bade Tian Huilan and Xia ruofei farewell and left. Her seat was in Economy Class. The cabin door closed after the three of them boarded the plane. Then, just as Xia ruofei and Tian Huilan were putting on their seat belts, the plane trembled slightly and the tractor started to push the plane out. Immediately after, the plane came to the end of the runway through the runway. Without waiting for a second, it drove directly onto the runway. After the body of the plane was adjusted, it did not stop. It directly added the take – off thrust, and the Airbus A380 began to accelerate and take off. In other words, the airport control had also opened a green channel for this plane. As soon as Tian Huilan arrived, this plane was immediately added to the first flight of the take – off sequence. There was no need to wait, and it could fly as it came. After the plane took off, Tian Huilan turned to look at Xia ruofei and said gratefully,””Thank you, Xia!” “Don’t mention it, Secretary Tian. I don’t know if I can help!” Xia ruofei said with a smile. “No matter what, I’ll owe you this!” Tian Huilan said,”as for elder song’s condition, we can only say that we’ve done our best and leave it to fate!” “Is the patient’s surname song?” Xia ruofei asked subconsciously. His brain was spinning fast as he tried to think of the big shots with the surname song in Huaxia. However, Xia ruofei did not know much about Huaxia’s political scene. Unless it was someone with a very high position, Xia ruofei would not know. He did know of a Big Shot with the surname song, but his status was too high. Xia ruofei did not dare to think of him. And if that person’s illness was so serious, he should have been receiving treatment in the capital long ago. How could he be in Jiangnan Province? Just as Xia ruofei’s mind was racing, Tian Huilan smiled and said,””Xia, stop guessing. It’s the elder song you’re thinking of.” Xia ruofei’s jaw dropped.””You ... You’re saying the capital ...” At this point, Xia ruofei pointed up and continued,””That person?” “Haven’t you noticed that he hasn’t appeared on any news or screens in the past year?”Tian Huilan nodded. Xia ruofei laughed in embarrassment.”Secretary Tian, I don’t really pay attention to the news ...” Then, Xia ruofei asked in confusion,””But why is elder song in Jiangnan Province? Since he’s so seriously ill, shouldn’t he ...” “This is elder song’s own wish.” Tian Huilan said,”after he returned from his surgery Germany, he requested to return to Jiangnan Province to recuperate. He’s planning to return to his roots!” Xia ruofei also immediately realized the extraordinary significance of Jiangnan Province to elder song. Elder song was definitely a legendary figure. Xia ruofei, who was once an excellent soldier, knew about elder song’s situation because of his legendary experience. As elder song was once a general with outstanding military achievements, his legendary experience was closely related to Jiangnan Province. Elder song was not from Jiangnan, but he had fled to Jiangnan when he was young. At the age of 15, he had joined the People’s Army of Hua Xia who had passed by this place. He had followed the Army all the way South and liberated half of Hua Xia. Before the founding of the country, he had already grown into an excellent battalion commander before he was even 18 years old. After the founding of the People’s Republic of China, he had participated in two wars and made great military achievements. His position had also been promoted rapidly. His troops had been stationed in Jiangnan Province during peaceful times. Even more legendary was that in the 1990s, he, who was already a major General, responded to the call for disarmament and took the initiative to transfer to a local area. It was very rare for a general to change his career. Elder song, who set an example, was directly placed in a Deputy provincial leader position in Jiangnan Province. Elder song, who was working in a local area, was still full of vigor. He was quickly promoted to the head of Jiangnan Province. After nearly ten years of governing Jiangnan, he made great progress and was transferred to Beijing to serve as a core leader. Three years ago, the 80 – year – old elder song retired from his position as a leader. However, elder song’s influence was still unparalleled, be it in the local or the military. To this day, the legendary story of the regiment commander, elder song, personally entering the enemy camp on the battlefield of the southern border and “catching their tongues” was still circulating in the military. It could be said that elder song’s entire life was closely tied to Jiangnan Province, so it was reasonable for him to choose to stay in Jiangnan in the last days of his life. Xia ruofei felt like he was in a dream when he thought about how he was going to meet the idol of countless soldiers, the legend of legends, and how he was going to treat his cancer. Tian Huilan looked at Xia ruofei and said,””Xiao Xia, elder song and my family have a deep relationship, and I’m indebted to him for his knowledge and guidance. Please ...” “Secretary Tian, don’t worry!” Xia ruofei didn’t wait for Tian Huilan to finish her sentence and said,”I will do my best to save elder song’s life! Even if he couldn’t be completely cured, he would try his best to prolong his life! To ease his pain. ” Tian Huilan’s eyes revealed a trace of gratitude as she said,”Okay, thank you, Xia ...” Xia ruofei was in a state of excitement the entire journey. Soon, the plane began to slowly descend and finally landed smoothly on the runway of Hongzhou International Airport. Would he be able to see elder song soon? Xia ruofei felt an inexplicable sense of nervousness and excitement ... [PS] although it was still a little bit off, steel gun could already feel the enthusiasm of his brothers and sisters.
