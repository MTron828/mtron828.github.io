Xu Jiahui forced a smile and said,”you must be joking, President Xia. The price of 380 million is definitely a very low price. Companies with the ability to take over will definitely be tempted.”

Xia ruofei looked at Xu Jiahui and smiled without saying anything.

Xu Jiahui felt his hair stand on end under Xia ruofei’s gaze. He was also mumbling to himself.

There was no doubt that Xia ruofei was very familiar with their company’s current situation. However, Xu Jiahui did not know how much Xia ruofei knew. In other words, he did not know the opponent’s trump card at all, and he was almost forced into a corner.

It did not matter if Xia ruofei had said that without thinking, but that was the current situation of bojun real estate.

After the company’s higher – ups decided to cash out the assets in the Hengli building, bojun contacted many real estate companies to discuss the sale.

After all, it was the property of a whole nine floors and more than half a building. The most likely company to take over was the real estate company.

However, bojun real estate’s financial problems were not a secret in the industry. It was only a matter of how much they knew about it. Even if it was a groundless rumor, the news that bojun was selling a building in a prime location was confirmed.

The real estate industry was a cruel one. The nine – story building of bojun was worth at least 400 million Yuan according to the market price. However, once they found out that bojun had a serious cash flow problem, the value would immediately shrink.

Those real estate businessmen who usually called each other brothers at industry conferences or other occasions would never be polite at this time.

In the end, after looking around, none of the bids exceeded 300 million. It was obvious that they were taking advantage of the situation.

As for other powerful companies, if they didn’t have such needs, they wouldn’t have much interest in this kind of investment – type real estate.

After all, the transaction involved hundreds of millions of dollars, and bojun had a very tight deadline for the payment. It would be time – consuming and laborious to buy it and then resell it or rent it.

In the end, bojun real estate finally thought of paradise Corporation, which had just bought the other half of the building.

The explosive Jade skin cream had made paradise Corporation famous, especially in Sanshan city.

In just a few minutes, the sales of one to two hundred million Yuan was almost like a legend.

Bojun real estate’s decision – makers felt that paradise Corporation should not be lacking in cash flow. Furthermore, they had just bought the other half of the building. If they bought the other half, it would be quite beneficial for the integration of resources.

After much thought, the peach blossom company became the main focus of bojun real estate’s negotiations.

Seeing that Xia ruofei was unmoved, Xu Jiahui sighed and said,””President Xia, we came here with great sincerity to negotiate, so the 380 million offer is not the final offer. It’s not impossible to reduce it a little, but the 320 million that your company offered is too low. The higher – ups of the group can’t accept such a price ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”of course, we can feel your company’s sincerity. Moreover, you’re a guest. I can’t not give you some face. How about this?” 330 million is a lucky number that both sides can accept. How about it?”

The number ” 8″ was different in San Shan from many places in China. In local customs, the number ” 3″ was an auspicious number. Whether it was giving red packets, giving betrothal gifts, or choosing a date, they all liked to have the number ” 3″ in their hand.

Seeing Xia ruofei talking to himself, Xu Jiahui could not help but smile bitterly.

How could both sides accept it?

330 million wasn’t even the company’s bottom line, okay? You erased the difference of tens of millions with just an auspicious number. Is there such a good thing in the world?

However, Xu Jiahui knew very well that bojun real estate was at a disadvantage in this negotiation. Since Xia ruofei had taken the initiative to give in, he could not show his emotions on his face.

Xu Jiahui tried hard to adjust himself. He then squeezed out a smile and said,””President Xia, this price is too low ... We can give you another 10 million. 370 million is the lowest we can go. This is already a huge loss!”

Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”isn’t the loss too exaggerated?” The Hengli building had been developed for several years. The cost of building materials and labor was also much lower than now. I forgot that you guys got this land through a trade, so the cost will be even lower! I don’t think it’ll exceed 200 million!”

Xu Jiahui almost vomited blood.

Can debts be calculated like this?

In the past few years, property prices in San Shan had soared. Just this year alone, it had risen by a few thousand Yuan. How could it be calculated using the cost of that year? If that was the case, then all real estate businessmen would switch to doing charity.

“Mr. Xia, this ...” Xu Jiahui could only smile bitterly at Xia ruofei’s unreasonable calculation. He was speechless. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“CEO Feng,” Xia ruofei turned to ask Feng Jing,”have you calculated the office space we need after the headquarters move?”

“Chairman,” Feng Jing said,”we’ve done some detailed calculations. The six – story building we’ve taken down is enough for the company’s future development needs. There’s also quite a bit of redundancy!”

Xia ruofei then looked at Xu Jiahui, shrugged and said,””Boss Xu, you heard it? “Actually, our company doesn’t have an urgent need for the remaining nine floors. To be honest, I have so much cash, where can i not make money by investing it? “I’m only thinking of how bojun real estate is a local company, so I wanted to help you when you’re in trouble ...”
