2858 The tide of attacks (2)

The three of them made a bet before the game started. They were guessing when Xia ruofei’s first goal would come.

Zhou leiyun was more conservative and took fifteen minutes to guess. Ling Qingxue took 10 minutes while Song Wei, who had the most confidence in Xia ruofei, took 8 minutes.

The three of them did not expect Xia ruofei to score in just 15 seconds.

Of course, in theory, Song Wei’s answer was the closest to Yingluo ‘s, even if it was still far from it.

Song Wei was a little embarrassed and said,”I think it’s a draw! If I win, I’d feel bad ...”

Ling Qingxue thought for a moment and said,”Hey!” Why are we so conflicted about this? When the competition is over, let RUO Fei treat you! He’s in the limelight today, shouldn’t he treat us to a big meal?”

“That makes sense!” Song Wei agreed with a smile.

Zhou leiyun saw that Song Wei and Ling Qingxue had come to an agreement, so he naturally wouldn’t raise any objections. With their wealth, it didn’t matter who treated them. The most important thing was to be happy!

Although Xia ruofei’s goal did not break the LA Liga’s record for the fastest goal, it would definitely be the best goal of the week. Even if it was the first match of La Liga, there would be no suspense, unless Xia ruofei himself scored an even more exciting goal.

This had severely slapped the faces of several media outlets, led by The Sports Daily, that questioned the ability of Chinese players.

……

The Spanish players did not celebrate for too long and quickly returned to their own half of the game. The game had just begun, and they were not satisfied with winning a goal, so they could not delay time by celebrating a goal at this time.

The players of Herona wanted to cry but had no tears. It had only been a minute, and it was already the second time the ball had been kicked off in the center circle. This time, it was their turn to kick off, and the score on the scoreboard had become 1 – 0. As usual, the home team was in the lead.

Before the Spanish players kicked off, another six or seven players lined up in a row on the center line as if they were the ones behind. They could not wait to rush to the other half of the field.

The players of Herona all had the same thought in their hearts: What are you guys doing? Can’t we just have fun?

The Espanyol’s manager, Ruby, did not stand on the sidelines to give instructions. He sat in the technical area, leisurely crossing his legs and chatting with the assistant manager beside him.

Before the start of the match, this was what Ruby had arranged for the players. They were to attack at the start of the match. Even after they scored a goal, they could not retreat. At least for the first 15 minutes, the players only had one task, and that was to press forward and keep pressing.

When the other side took the ball, they had to press and snatch it on the spot, and they had to be surrounded by many people to ensure that their side had the advantage of numbers in the local area. When their team controlled the ball, they had to boldly plug in, and the full – back had to spare no effort to assist forward.

This was indeed very physically exhausting. The forward pressing tactic required every player to put in more energy than usual. Everyone ran more to further reduce the space of the other side.

The full-back’s frequent insertion was even more challenging. First of all, the full-back’s attack range was relatively far, and every time he sprinted up and down, it was a test of physical strength. Second, after the full – back plugged in, the space left behind would require other players to fill in the defense, which would further consume the physical strength of other players.

However, the Spanish players were very determined. Even if they took the lead from the start, they did not change their tactics.

After Herona kicked off, several Spanish players quickly surrounded him, and the other players quickly ran to further cut off the passing route of the opposing player who had the ball.

Under this kind of high – intensity rush, the players who had the ball would be very nervous, and the probability of making mistakes would increase correspondingly.

The firm implementation of the offensive tactics also quickly bore fruit.

In the eighth minute of the game, Xia ruofei’s extremely penetrative straight pass directly crossed two layers of Herona’s defense. Wu Lei, who had been roaming around the offside line, understood. After a reverse run, he accelerated again. With a perfect reverse offside operation, he formed a single – handed knife.

However, the moment Wu Lei dribbled the ball into the penalty area, the ball was a little too wide, and Herona’s goalkeeper had already struck decisively.

Although Wu Lei still managed to catch up with the football, Herona’s goalkeeper was already in front of him, almost completely blocking the angle of his shot.

Fortunately, Wu Lei was still very calm. From the corner of his eye, he saw someone quickly plug in in the middle of the penalty area, so he gave up on the shot. With a swing of his ankle, he flicked the ball past Herona’s goalkeeper and passed it to the middle.

The person who plugged in at a high speed was the center forward of Espanyol, iglasias. Wu Lei’s pass was much more accurate than the one he had passed to Xia ruofei before. When iglasias ran to his position, the football was just delivered, and the height was just right.

Iglesia did not even need to jump, he just lightly headed the ball on the spot and easily sent the ball into the unguarded goal. If he could not even head the ball in, he would really be ashamed to death.

After Wu Lei passed the ball, he was also tripped by Herona’s goalkeeper. He lost his balance and fell on the grass. After iglasias scored, he ran directly to Wu Lei and pounced on him.
