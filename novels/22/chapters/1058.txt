Chapter 1059: The final auction item (2)

Translator: 549690339

“Mr. Dong from Jialin industry bids 3.5 million!” Lu zhongguang said immediately.

As soon as Lu zhongguang finished speaking, a new bid was immediately refreshed.

“3.6 million Hong Kong dollars!”

“3.8 million!”

” 4 million Hong Kong dollars!”

After three consecutive bids, the price of the abalone soared to 4 million Hong Kong dollars in an instant.

This was actually very normal. Two of the abalones that had been auctioned earlier were more than 630 grams, and the final price was over 4 million Hong Kong dollars.

This was the final abalone that weighed almost 640 grams. Besides, there were a lot of rich people in the audience who didn’t lack money. These people were too lazy to raise the price by 100000 Yuan, because the final price would definitely not be lower than 4 million Yuan. Everyone knew this very well.

There was only one or two seconds of difference between the three bids, so Lu zhongguang only had time to make his last bid.””Mr. Li from Changjiang group has bid 4 million Hong Kong dollars! Are there any higher bids?”

The guests in the audience couldn’t help but look at Jian Jia. Even the son of Superman li couldn’t help but make a move. The charm of this abalone was really great!

However, even if he was the son of Superman li, it was impossible to stop the enthusiasm of others to bid. Which one of the guests in the VIP area was not in the billions?

Therefore, the price was refreshed very quickly.

“Hahaha! I bid 4.1 million Hong Kong dollars!” A rough – looking man in his thirties grinned and raised his sign.

“Alright, Mr. Zheng from Xinyu Group offers 4.1 million Hong Kong dollars!” Lu zhongguang said excitedly.

This Mr. Zheng’s name was Zheng zhilun, the nephew of Zheng qitong, the founder of Xinyu group. In terms of status, he was comparable to Li Kai, the son of Superman li, and Ma Zhiming. Whether it was in terms of wealth or influence, he was among the top of the second generation of rich people in Hong Kong.

“Then I’ll join in the fun!” A lazy voice rang out,”4.3 million Hong Kong dollars!” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

It was a mature woman in an expensive evening dress. The corners of her mouth curled up slightly, revealing a faint smile.

Seeing this, Lu zhongguang was even more delighted and quickly said,””Ms. He from the xinhao group has bid 4.3 million Hong Kong dollars! The competition for this abalone was very fierce! Guests who are interested in bidding, please hurry up and bid!”

This Ms. He’s full name was he Xinyi, and her father was the famous gambling king of Hong Kong.

Among the guests attending tonight’s auction, Li Kai, Zheng zhilun, and he Xinyi were undoubtedly the three with the highest net worth. Now that these three people could not help but participate in the bidding, it would be difficult for the price to drop.

When Zheng zhilun saw he Xinyi make a move, he immediately shrugged and said,””lady first! Since miss he likes it, I’ll give up. There should be more chances in the future ...”

He Xinyi immediately bowed slightly to Zheng zhilun and said,””Then I’ll have to thank you, young master Zheng!”

After she finished speaking, he Xinyi turned her gaze to Li Kai, who was also sitting in the first row.

“I really admire Mr. Zheng’s demeanor, but I think you’ve used it in the wrong way!” Li Kai smiled. Since everyone was here to bid, when they encountered something they liked, they naturally wouldn’t give in an inch! If everyone was like Mr. Zheng, I think the Hengfeng auction house would be very depressed ...”

Everyone burst out in laughter.

What Li Kai said was true. The auction house naturally hoped that the competition would be as intense as possible. If everyone was as flamboyant as Zheng zhilun, how could they be auctioned off at a high price?

Zheng zhilun was a little embarrassed, but he still maintained a good demeanor. He only smiled slightly, then spread his hands, and did not say anything to refute.

“4.5 million Hong Kong dollars!” Li Kai said indifferently.

He Xinyi’s eyes flashed with a hint of displeasure. She didn’t expect Li Kai to not give her any face at all. He even increased the price by 200000 in one go. It was obvious that he was determined to win.

The abalones that had been auctioned earlier were definitely considered high – Quality items under normal circumstances. However, with these three as the highlight of the auction, they were not worthy of he Xinyi’s attention.

That was why he Xinyi had not bid until the 638 – gram abalone was up for auction.

She knew that the competition for the last three abalones would be getting fiercer and fiercer. It would be best to get one as soon as possible, otherwise, she might really return empty – handed today.

Now, Li Kai clearly had the same thoughts.

There was no way to use any tricks, so he Xinyi was pretty free and easy. She only thought for a moment, then raised her board and said,””4.9 million! Mr. Lee, if you’re willing to pay more than 5 million Hong Kong dollars, then I’ll have to part with it ...”

The money of the rich did not come from the wind. On the contrary, the children of these business bigwigs had been in the business world for many years and had been exposed to such things since they were young. They had always maintained a rational attitude towards money. No matter how good the abalone was, they would not madly increase the price in a moment of impulse. Even if they increased the price by 10 million Hong Kong dollars, it would not hurt them. But they would not do that.

He Xinyi raised the bid by 400000 Hong Kong dollars in one go. Her attitude was quite clear. This was her last bid and the highest price she had in mind. If Li Kai continued to raise the bid, she would give up.

When Li Kai heard this, he smiled at he Xinyi and said,””Then I’ll thank you, miss he!”

Li Kai raised his board without hesitation and said loudly,”” 5 million Hong Kong dollars!”

This was the first time that the bid had exceeded the five million mark in today’s auction. The guests below the stage couldn’t help but discuss excitedly. The reporters were even more excited. Some were busy taking photos, while others were directly typing quickly on their laptops.
