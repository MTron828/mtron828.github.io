Chapter 1705: The seniority is in a mess (2)

Translator: 549690339

After a long while, Li Yifu did something that shocked everyone. He urged him to topple the Golden Mountain and topple the Jade pillar. He knelt respectfully in front of Xia ruofei and said in a trembling voice,””Unfilial disciple Li Yifu greets martial granduncle! Previously, I didn’t know the identity of martial granduncle, so I’ve offended you! I hope martial granduncle can forgive me!”

Xia ruofei quickly dodged to the side and said,”Senior Li, you ...”

“Senior granduncle, please don’t call me senior anymore. I can’t take the responsibility!” Li Yifu said in fear.

Xu Ziyuan and Tang Yitian were dumbfounded. What was going on? Their brains simply couldn’t keep up.

Xia ruofei said helplessly,”stand up first!” Tell me what happened!”

A white – haired old man was kneeling before him and calling him Grand – martial uncle. This made Xia ruofei feel a little too horrified and extremely uncomfortable.

“Yes, martial granduncle!” Li Yifu said respectfully, and then stood up from the ground obediently.

“Tell me, what’s going on?” Xia ruofei asked.

He didn’t dare to call Li Yifu ‘senior’ anymore. Otherwise, he was sure that Li Yifu would kneel down again.

“Martial granduncle! Martial ancestor li beihuai was the master of my late father, Li Jiu Zhou. ” Li Yifu said respectfully,”our family ‘s’ origin returning Scripture ‘was taught to us by Grandmaster li beihuai! You’re Grandmaster li beihuai’s junior Brother, so you’re naturally my Grandmaster! Our branch has never known where the inheritance came from, but now we have finally found a master. If my late father knew in the netherworld, he would definitely be very pleased ...”

As he spoke, Li Yifu couldn’t help but shed tears.

Xia ruofei quickly tried to persuade him. He was an old man, and the biggest taboo was to be in a mood of great sorrow or joy. If anything happened to him, he would be in big trouble.

Then, Li Yifu explained the origin in detail.

It turned out that if li beihuai had lived until now, he would have been at least three hundred years old. Back then, li Jiuzhou was taken in as a personal disciple by li beihuai, who was traveling around Yunan Province and called himself the Daoist of Xichuan. He even passed on the origin returning Scripture, which allowed li Jiuzhou to embark on the path of cultivation. Later, it was passed down to Li Yifu’s generation. Among the five siblings, only he had the cultivation physique and cultivated the origin returning Scripture.

Moreover, li beihuai had once mentioned to li Jiuzhou about the origins of his sect. Back then, li beihuai was still a Cowherd boy in the mountains of Xichuan. When he was Cowherd by the pond outside the village, he met an old Daoist with a Sage – like demeanor and passed him a cultivation technique.

The old Daoist said that his root bone was not bad, and asked if he was willing to cultivate immortal spells with him. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Li beihuai was an uncultured orphan back then, so he had no concept of cultivation at all. Naturally, he was overjoyed and expressed his willingness.

Therefore, the old Daoist stayed in the small mountain village for seven days and taught him an immortal method called the “origin returning Scripture”.

It was a pity that his ability to comprehend was limited, and in the end, he only remembered the incomplete cultivation technique and most of the palm technique.

It was obvious that immortal mountain river had no intention of taking him in as a true disciple. From the beginning to the end, he didn’t hold an apprenticeship ceremony. Moreover, once the seven days were up, he didn’t care how much li beihuai had learned and left.

Li beihuai had relied on this half of the origin returning true scroll to cultivate step by step to the ninth level of the Qi refining stage. He was only one step away from completing the foundation establishment stage.

Because he had not completely mastered the origin returning Scripture, li beihuai only dared to name his cultivation technique the origin returning Scripture to show his respect for this cultivation technique.

This was also the reason why Li Yifu was so excited when he heard the Guiyuan Scripture.

Those who knew about the Guiyuan Scripture must be the descendants of the Grand – Grandmaster, immortal Shanhe. However, he did not expect Xia ruofei to be the disciple of immortal Shanhe. His seniority was so high that it was scary.

Although li beihuai had not been able to become a disciple of immortal mountain river, he had long engraved the kindness of rebirth in his heart. He also regarded himself as an in – Name disciple of immortal mountain river. Therefore, he would tell each of his disciples that if they met the successor of immortal mountain river, they must treat him with the courtesy of a sect leader.

Hence, when Li Yifu heard that Xia ruofei was li beihuai’s junior Brother, he immediately knelt down and paid his respects without hesitation.

After Xia ruofei heard this, he felt that the origin was quite magical.

Xia ruofei did not find it strange that li beihuai had not mastered the entire content of the Guiyuan Scripture. After all, according to the records, the previous owner of the spirit map space had only taught li beihuai this technique casually.

He was very interested in the Daoist name ‘Daoist priest mountain river’. If he was not mistaken, this Daoist priest mountain river should be the previous owner of the spirit map space.

Mountain river, this Daoist name was very compatible with his most precious magical treasure, the realm of the Suan ni spirit map. A small space with mountains and rivers was simply a complete small world!

He couldn’t help but use his divine sense to contact Xia Qing, who was in the space.””Xia Qing, was your previous master’s Daoist name Daoist priest mountain river?”

Xia Qing was obviously stunned for a moment, then she asked,””Master, how did you know? The old master didn’t seem to have left behind any written records about himself!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,””It’s also a coincidence. I happened to meet the descendant of one of immortal mountain river’s in – Name disciples, and we talked about this. ”
