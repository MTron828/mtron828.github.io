2165 The gospel of the survivors (2)

After the raft was built, it was for Puyol and the others to use, so it naturally had to be as strong as possible.

Even if they were in danger at sea, Xia ruofei was confident that he could save them, but it was still troublesome, right?

Of course, if he were to encounter a Super Storm like the other day, even Xia ruofei would have no choice but to hide in the spirit map space.

If such an extreme situation really happened, Xia ruofei had no choice but to put Puyol and the rest into the medium.

In this way, to ensure that the secret of the spirit map space would not be leaked, Xia ruofei would not kill them, but he would definitely not let them leave the space. Unless his cultivation reached a certain level in the future and he learned some immortal techniques, he would not let these people leak this secret.

Xia ruofei would not consider such probability.

In fact, even if he told Puyol and the others about the risk of never being able to return to human society, they would choose to leave without hesitation. After all, the result would be the same if they stayed.

Rather than living here in pain, it was better to take a gamble.

When Xia ruofei returned to the cave, the other survivors had already returned from the campsite. They brought some tools such as saws and chopping knives. There were no smelting conditions on the island, so these were tools used on the lifeboats back then. They were already rusty. One could imagine the efficiency of working with these tools.

Perhaps it was because he had not taken any medicine since he was born, but John’s effect on Merlin was very good. He began to sweat after drinking it, and his fever went down.

Puyol shed tears of gratitude and kept thanking Xia ruofei.

However, Xia ruofei knew that the fever medicine could only treat the symptoms but not the root cause. It was useless to just lower the fever. If the inflammation was not eliminated, the fever would return after the medicine wore off.

Hence, he took out another box of lanqin oral solution from his “backpack” and asked Puyol to feed it to John according to the child’s dosage. Yingying was still so young. Xia ruofei felt that he should not use antibiotics if he could. It would not be too late to use it when the inflammation could not go down. Anyway, he had plenty of antibiotics such as cephaloid in his space.

“Alright, let’s rest for a day or two, then we’ll start building the raft!” Xia ruofei said,”I hope John can get better soon. Otherwise, he can’t go out to sea in this condition ...”

Puyol was afraid that Xia ruofei would leave his precious son behind, so he quickly said,””Great divine immortal, John’s body is very good. He hasn’t been sick since he was born! I’ll definitely get better soon!”

Xia ruofei nodded and took out a few bowls of noodles from his backpack. “Don’t go out to look for food these two days. My food storage is quite sufficient. You can rest here today! I’m going to walk around the island. ”

Of course, he didn’t want to eat instant noodles with pyol and the others. There was a lot of good food and wine in the origin space, but he couldn’t take them out in front of pyol and the others. Otherwise, his backpack would become ding-dong’s pocket. If he wanted to enjoy the food, he could only avoid them.

“Lord Divine immortal, let’s keep this food for now!” Puyol quickly said. Once we go out to sea, who knows how long we’ll drift! I need to prepare more food ...”

Xia ruofei said indifferently,”I still have a large amount of compressed biscuits in my bag. It’s enough for a month’s consumption for the few of us. These instant noodles are not easy to carry around. Let’s just use them on the island!”

“Yes, yes, yes!” Puyol and the others quickly responded, and one of the survivors couldn’t help but swallow his saliva.

The food from the civilized world, even if it was just ordinary instant noodles, was a rare delicacy in their eyes.

Xia ruofei looked around the cave. Other than the rusty tools, the survivors had also found some worn – out quilts to keep warm from the collapsed houses.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and threw a lighter to Puyol.””I won’t be coming back tonight. Pick up more firewood during the day and light a bonfire at night to keep warm and to keep out wild beasts.”

“Alright, Daoist immortal!” Puyol replied respectfully.

Xia ruofei thought that after the effects of the medicine wore off, John might have a fever again. Hence, he explained in detail to Puyol about the precautions for taking fever medicine and the eastern medicine, lanqin oral solution, before leaving the cave.

As soon as Xia ruofei left, the survivors immediately pounced on the instant noodles, bread, and other food.

Puyol’s prestige was still very high. He snorted softly, and the survivors quickly stopped. In the end, Puyol arranged for a survivor to go to the nearest water source to get water, while the others went to pick up dry wood to boil water and enjoy the “delicious food”.

Puyol and the rest were enjoying the food. So was Xia ruofei.

He decided to return to the array barrier by the pool because it was absolutely safe inside. He could enter the spirit map space without any worries.

The water in the pool had become clear again. If it weren’t for the weeds and shrubs that were swaying around the pool, there would be no trace of the battle in the morning. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Xia ruofei first looked at the tree above the pool. It was the fruit that had grown on this tree that had greatly increased Puyol’s strength.

Xia ruofei also ate a dark red fruit at the critical moment. However, for a cultivator of his level, the fruit’s effect was not that obvious.
