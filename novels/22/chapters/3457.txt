Chapter 3458: Spirit transformation realm, broken

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei could feel the pain in his body gradually numbing. In order to calm down his Yuan Qi that was on the verge of going berserk, he continued to use the “great Dao Sutra” with all his might. However, this was almost an instinctive action because his consciousness was gradually becoming blurry…

His spiritual force was about to be exhausted, but the spiritual force pressure produced by the Obsidian stairway did not reduce in the slightest.

Under such circumstances, Xia ruofei found it hard to hold on.

Was he going to be eliminated just like that?

This thought appeared in Xia ruofei’s mind. Then, images that were engraved in his bones and engraved in his heart appeared in his mind.

In the damp and cold tropical jungle, where snakes, insects, rats, and ants wreaked havoc, Lin Hu stared at him with blood – Red eyes and roared. His ears were buzzing, and he couldn’t hear what Lin Hu was shouting at all.

He could only hold the grass in front of him tightly with both hands, his body as close to the ground as possible, hiding in a dead corner and looking ahead with eyes that were about to pop out.

Then, the high – caliber sniper rifle bullets pierced into Lin Hu’s body again and again, splashing blood that he would never forget…

In order to lure more members of lone wolf, the other party had deliberately shot Lin Hu’s hands and feet. Lin Hu’s face was twisted in pain, but he still turned his head in Xia ruofei’s direction and shouted as hard as he could to prevent Xia ruofei from coming out to rescue him.

Finally, the enemy sniper lost his patience and ended Lin Hu’s life with a sniper bullet…

This was the most unforgettable scene in Xia ruofei’s life.

At this moment, as his consciousness gradually blurred, this scene played out in his mind over and over again.

Finally, his eyes, which had been slightly closed, suddenly opened. The blood – Red eyes spewed out flames of anger.

“All!” A roar that had been suppressed for a long time burst out from his throat.”You want to suppress me? I don’t believe in heresy!”

Xia ruofei clenched his fists and his eyes were about to pop out. Knowing that he could not hold on any longer, he steadied his feet and stood on the 451st step with his back straight.

And that mental power that was originally close to exhaustion, under the enormous mental power Pressure, actually miraculously rebounded strongly!

His mind power seemed to have broken through its shackles, and the sea of consciousness that had been compressed to the extreme by the pressure was suddenly filled up a lot. A strong force of mind power gushed out and pushed back the mind power Pressure.

Xia ruofei suddenly found the long – Lost refreshing feeling.

At this time, his head was no longer buzzing, and the hundreds of millions of steel needles that pierced his brain had disappeared without a trace. His consciousness suddenly became extremely clear.

At this moment, Xia ruofei was surprised to find that his spiritual power had a breakthrough under such extreme pressure!

His mental power had already reached the late – Stage of the spirit gathering realm and was extremely close to the spirit transformation realm. However, the spirit transformation realm was equivalent to the mental power of a nascent soul cultivator, so it was very difficult to break through.

Even if he absorbed the yellow jade essence, he would probably need a huge amount of it to have a slight chance of breaking through directly.

From the spirit gathering realm to the spirit transformation realm, it was a major breakthrough. The bottleneck was very stubborn, and it often required an opportunity.

Originally, if Xia ruofei had cultivated the “great Dao scroll” normally, he could have continued to Polish his spiritual power and eventually break through to the spiritualization realm.

However, if that was the case, it would take a long time. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

It could take three to five years, or eight to ten years, or even longer.

Xia ruofei was very clear about this, so he did not deliberately cultivate his spiritual power. He understood the principle that haste makes waste.

What he didn’t expect was that on this Obsidian stairway, it was always there, and the continuous increase of spiritual power Pressure had become the best helper to train his spiritual power. From the first step, he used his spiritual power to resist the pressure, which was actually already training his own spiritual power.

In this process, his mental strength was also constantly improving and strengthening, but the extent was not particularly obvious. In addition, he was also minding his own business, so he did not notice the subtle changes in his mental strength at all.

And on this four hundred fifty first step, his mental strength was already unable to support it. If he slightly let out that breath, it would be another result. He had a very high probability of being directly sent flying by the pressure.

However, he had never thought of giving up. Even when his sea of consciousness was in danger of collapsing, he still gritted his teeth and persevered, holding on bitterly with an obsession in his heart.

In the end, under the immense pressure of his spiritual power, his own spiritual power finally broke through the shackles of the life – and – Death crisis and successfully leaped into the spiritualization boundary.

Xia ruofei was overjoyed. Spiritualisation boundary! That was the legendary cultivation level of spiritual power that only nascent soul cultivators possessed. He had actually achieved it just like that.

In the entire cultivation world on earth, the one with the highest cultivation level was the Tianyi sect’s sect master, Chen Nanfeng. He was only at the late – Stage golden core realm.

He did not know if there were any hidden masters, but Xia ruofei had never seen one.

In other words, without considering the possible hidden masters, Xia ruofei’s current spiritual power would be the best in the world of cultivation on earth!

Xia ruofei soon experienced the benefits of a breakthrough in spiritual power.

First of all, the Obsidian stairway’s spiritual pressure was no longer a threat to him. The pressure that made him feel like dying just now was like a breeze blowing on his face.

The difference between the realms was indeed like a huge chasm.

Besides, after his spiritual power had broken through to the spiritualization realm, Xia ruofei’s brain had obviously evolved as well. Whether it was his thinking speed or his perception, it was a qualitative improvement.

It was the same invisible energy that disrupted one’s vital Qi. Now, when Xia ruofei circulated the “great Dao technique”, the efficiency was completely different from before. The vital Qi that was almost going berserk returned to its calm state after a few rounds.

After Xia ruofei’s spiritual power had broken through, it was much easier for him to deal with the huge external pressure.

Although his Yuan Qi had not changed much, his control over it had greatly changed. Even though he had the same amount of Yuan Qi all over his body, the defensive effect was different from before.

His vital Qi could offset more external pressure, so the pressure his body had to bear was naturally much smaller.

Xia ruofei did not stand on this step for a long time. Including the time before his spiritual power broke through, it was only three to five minutes.

At this time, he had already completely stood firm, and his body had also quickly adapted to the strength of this pressure.

Hence, Xia ruofei confidently walked up to the four hundred and fifty – second step.

In the hidden space enshrouded in purple mist, Taoist Qing Xuan was proudly saying to immortal mountain river,””Brother mountain river, do you see that? This was called facts speaking louder than words! Your disciple is indeed talented, but he’s at a disadvantage because his cultivation is a little low. He shouldn’t be able to advance any further now…”

As soon as Qing Xuan Taoist priest finished speaking, in the image displayed on the bronze mirror, Xia ruofei had quickly stabilized his body and stepped up the stairs without any adjustment.

Daoist Qing Xuan was stunned. His eyes were filled with disbelief as he stared at the copper mirror without blinking. He muttered,”How… How is this possible…”

Immortal mountain river was already sighing to himself, but the situation suddenly changed dramatically. He was stunned for a moment, and then he couldn’t help but burst into laughter,””Daoist Qing Xuan, facts speak louder than words! This sentence is absolutely right!”

Daoist Qing Xuan was dumbfounded. After a long while, he said,”Brother mountain river, is … Is the great Dao formula really that magical? This child was clearly unable to hold on any longer.. He was actually able to turn the situation around so quickly, as if he was a different person! If it wasn’t for the fact that I’ve been watching him the entire time, I would’ve thought that he cheated!”
