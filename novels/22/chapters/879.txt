Chapter 880: Division Chief Cao (1)

Translator: 549690339

He Feng and yang Jianren were both stunned for a moment, then immediately shouted in unison,”Director Cao!”

It turned out that the person who came was the newly appointed Secretary, Guangzhi Cao. If the political circle of Sanshan was compared to the entertainment circle, Guangzhi Cao was undoubtedly the hottest fried chicken in recent times.

Although Guangzhi Cao was still the head of the municipal Secretary Department, everyone in the government knew that the position of the Deputy Director or even the director of the Secretary Department was basically Guangzhi Cao ‘s.

The first Secretary Department served the Secretary, and it was common for the Secretary to be the director. Guangzhi Cao only lacked experience.

That was why he Feng and yang Jianren both called Cao Guangzhi “director Cao.”

He Feng didn’t expect that yang Jianren would invite Guangzhi Cao. His heart sank. However, he thought about it and realized that Guangzhi was just a new Secretary. Xia ruofei’s relationship with Secretary song was far more than that.

Moreover, Secretary song was the one who asked him to do the work for Xia ruofei, and it was Guangzhi who did the job. He gave Guangzhi his phone number and then gave it to Xia ruofei.

Thinking of this, he Feng’s heart gradually calmed down.

Yang Jianren, on the other hand, glanced at he Feng with ill intentions. He was planning to find an opportunity to make things difficult for he Feng in front of Guangzhi Cao. If the Secretary didn’t have a good impression of him, then his life as a low – ranking Deputy Mayor would be in trouble.

As long as Guangzhi Cao released a little bit of information, the leaders and officers of the Bell Tower District would definitely keep a respectful distance from he Feng. To put it more seriously, he Feng’s political career would basically come to an end.

Yang Jianren couldn’t help but feel a burst of pleasure as he imagined the predicament he Feng was about to face.

Guangzhi Cao was about thirty years old. He was thin and looked refined. He said with a smile,”Mayor he is here too! District head he, Jianren, don’t call me that. I’m not the division Chief. It wouldn’t be good if others heard you ...”

“Director Cao, isn’t this just a matter of time?” yang Jianren said in a flattering tone. With the Secretary’s concern and support, it would be hard for you not to improve! Don’t you guys agree?”

The people yang Jianren had brought, including he Dong, all nodded in agreement. Even he Feng had to smile and say a few words.

Guangzhi Cao’s arrival had brought peace to the tense scene.

Xia ruofei listened for a while and finally figured out Guangzhi Cao’s identity.

In fact, Xia ruofei felt that Guangzhi Cao’s voice was familiar when he heard it. However, they had never met before and the voice over the phone was a little distorted, so Xia ruofei did not remember it at once.

However, from their conversation, Xia ruofei knew that this was Guangzhi Cao, who he had talked to on the phone yesterday.

Guangzhi Cao didn’t explain too much to yang Jianren’s flattery and the others “agreement, because he knew that the current state of the officialdom was like this, and it didn’t matter what he said.

Taking ten thousand steps back, if he was still a Head of Department staff who stayed up all night writing materials, yang Jianren and he Feng probably wouldn’t even look at him in the eye. Why would they treat him as a guest like today?

Sometimes, people were just that realistic.

Guangzhi Cao laughed,”by the way, Jianren, what were you guys talking about?”

Guangzhi Cao was going to meet with yang Jianren today. Until now, he had thought that he Feng was also a guest invited by yang Jianren. After all, yang Jinsheng had been working in the Bell Tower District for many years, and he had many students and old friends. He Feng was also a local official of the bell tower District.

Yang Jianren looked at he Feng with a dark look and said,””Chief Cao, it’s nothing, just a small misunderstanding ... Didn’t I ask you to come to this moonlight lotus pond private room? However, Deputy Mayor he has already made a reservation. I was just discussing with him about changing rooms! Right, Deputy Mayor he?”

Although yang Jianren’s tone wasn’t very intense, the word “Deputy” was usually not used in official circles. He kept calling him “Deputy Mayor he,” which was already expressing his dissatisfaction.

Guangzhi Cao wasn’t a newbie in the civil service, so how could he not understand? However, he only smiled faintly and said,””Jianren! Everyone was just out for a simple meal, so which private room wasn’t the same? There’s no need to switch!”

Yang Jianren grinned and said,”director Cao is really broad – minded. You look like someone who will do great things!” Fortunately, you’re not the kind of person who is calculative. Otherwise, this little brother would have lost face this time. This little brother’s face is not big enough! Deputy Mayor he doesn’t really want to change rooms with me ...”

Guangzhi Cao smiled, but didn’t say anything. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

He had just become song Qiming’s Secretary, so he had accumulated connections in all aspects. At the same time, almost all the cadres in the city had their eyes on him, so it was time to be cautious and low – Key. Naturally, it was not good to show too much power.

Guangzhi Cao didn’t say it out loud, but he was still a little unhappy.

Yang Jianren was playing a trick. In fact, he didn’t tell he Feng that the person he was going to entertain was Cao Guangzhi, but he didn’t mention it at all, which made Cao Guangzhi feel like he Feng didn’t take him seriously.

He Feng quickly explained,”director Cao, I’m really sorry. First of all, I didn’t know that you were coming to the dinner tonight. Also, the guest I invited is Mr. Xia, so I wanted to try to have a better dining environment ...”
