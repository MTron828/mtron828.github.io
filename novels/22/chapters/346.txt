“Wife, do you think I’m that kind of person? I’m a good comrade who has been trained by the party and the Army for many years,” Xia ruofei said righteously. “I will.” Ling Qingxue nodded her head with certainty. “The weather seems pretty good today ...” Xia ruofei laughed. Ling Qingxue looked at Xia ruofei in disdain and said,””Can you not be so obvious when you want to change the topic? You’re underestimating my intelligence, okay?” Xia ruofei scratched his head.”Qingxue,” he said.”You’re such an intelligent woman. You must ...” “Pfft ... Alright, alright!” Ling Qingxue smiled and said,”I can’t be bothered with you! In any case, if you dare to treat me badly in the future, I’ll ... I’ll ...” Xia ruofei smiled as he looked at Ling Qingxue and asked,””You’ll what?” Ling Qingxue’s face turned slightly red. She gritted her teeth and said,””I won’t let you touch me!” Xia ruofei was shocked,”wife, you’re too cruel!” Can we change the punishment?” “No!” Ling Qingxue said with a mischievous smile. Xia ruofei chuckled.”I’ll definitely take pity on you. Whether it’s in your career, in your life, or in bed!” “You’re going to die!” Ling Qingxue pouted as she hit Xia ruofei.”How can you say such things? you’re really thick – skinned ...” Xia ruofei laughed and did not resist, allowing Ling Qingxue to vent her shyness. How could Ling Qingxue bear to use so much force? that force was more like a tickle for Xia ruofei. After laughing for a while, Ling Qingxue finally remembered what she had to do. She quickly took out the contract from her bag and said,””Ruofei, sign the winery contract! I need to go back and report this ...” Xia ruofei nodded. He took the contract from Ling Qingxue and sat down beside the small desk. Then, he took out a pen from the pen holder on the table, flipped to the last page of the contract, and signed his name. After signing all three copies of the contract, Xia ruofei stood up and returned the contract to Ling Qingxue. Ling Qingxue put the contract into her bag and asked with a smile,””You didn’t even look at the contract before signing it? Aren’t you afraid that there’s a trap inside?” “What’s there to be afraid of?” Xia ruofei said nonchalantly,”even you are mine. How could father – in – Law cheat me?” “Who’s your man? You don’t know shame!” Ling Qingxue blushed and said. Xia ruofei looked bewildered and said,””Eh? Could it be that everything that happened this afternoon was just a dream? Could it be that I’m still in a dream? Qingxue, pinch me and see if it hurts!” “Alright!” Ling Qingxue said with a sweet smile. Then, she walked towards Xia ruofei with an evil look on her face. Xia ruofei quickly took a big step back and said,””Don ‘t, don’ t, don ‘t. There’s no need to trouble my wife. I’ll do it myself!” After he finished speaking, Xia ruofei gently pinched himself and then screamed like a pig being slaughtered.””It hurts! It hurts! It seems like I’m not dreaming ...” Seeing Xia ruofei’s exaggerated performance, Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but glance at Xia ruofei. She pouted and said, “You’re a stinky Rascal ...” Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”let’s go!” My wife, let’s go out!” The two of them walked out of the private room. President Zheng was indeed a smart person. There was not a single waiter outside the private room. Even the private rooms next door were empty. It was to create an environment where Xia ruofei would not be disturbed. Xia ruofei didn’t greet President Zheng again. He sent him a text message on his phone, then held Ling Qingxue’s hand and walked out of the West River Moon Club. President Zheng naturally would not come out to see her off. He only sent Xia ruofei a very polite text message. The two of them did not Park their car in the Xijiang yueye clubhouse, which was located inside the scenic Area. Although the important guests of the clubhouse could drive in directly, it was still a little troublesome. Hence, Xia ruofei chose to Park his car in the parking lot outside the scenic Area. Therefore, after they left the clubhouse, Ling Qingxue naturally held Xia ruofei’s hand. The two of them snuggled up to each other as they walked out of the antique South back street to the parking lot. Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue first found her orange Porsche 911. “Qingxue, after you return the contract to the company, go to Taoyuan farm!” Xia ruofei held Ling Qingxue’s hand and said,”you haven’t spent the night at Taoyuan farm! “Let me tell you ... The night view of our farm is so beautiful. In the dead of night, you can even faintly hear the sound of the waves in the distant sea ...” Xia ruofei, who had just had a taste of her body, wished that he could hug Ling Qingxue’s soft and delicate body to sleep every night. As long as he thought of the scene of him holding that pair of shockingly elastic long legs, Xia ruofei could not help but feel a surge of evil fire. The absurdity of the entire afternoon did not seem to be completely “extinguished”. As long as there was the slightest movement, the fire would immediately set the Prairie on fire again. Ling Qingxue was actually similar to Xia ruofei. It was also her first time experiencing the extreme pleasure between a man and a woman. Xia ruofei’s suggestion naturally made her heart beat faster. However, she quickly showed an apologetic expression and said,””Ruofei, the company has been very busy recently. There’s the matter of the designated reception unit of the municipal Party Committee, the matters of the other branches in other cities, and recently, there’s also the matter of the winery, so ...” “It’s okay, I can understand!” Xia ruofei said with a smile. Ling Qingxue stood on her tiptoes and kissed Xia ruofei on the cheek. Then, she blushed and said,””Ruofei, you have more free time. You can come back to the city to see me often!” Xia ruofei smiled evilly and said,”sure!” I’ll call you in advance, so you can book a room at the hotel, wash up, and wait for me ...” “I don’t want to!” Ling Qingxue shyly rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei, then opened the door and got into the car. She started the engine of the sports car, rolled down the window, and stuck her head out.””Oh! I almost forgot, you seem to be quite busy recently!” “Yup!” Xia ruofei replied casually,”there’s actually a lot of things to do at the farm. There are many things that I have to do by myself.” “I’m not talking about the farm,”Ling Qingxue said with a smile. I’ve heard that you’ve successfully cured a pot of orchids that even the professionals were helpless against. It seems like you’re still not satisfied and took on a more difficult new task!” Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment and smiled bitterly.””How do you know everything?” Ling Qingxue proudly waved her phone and said,””Because I added Lu You and Jiang Yue’s WeChat! Don’t forget that I was the one who promised you to go to Sanshan University to help them!” “So?” “That’s why you have to work hard! Bring out your godly doctor’s demeanor and don’t embarrass me!” Ling Qingxue smiled sweetly, then waved at the dumbfounded Xia ruofei. She stepped on the gas and drove away from the parking lot. “What do you mean by that?” Xia ruofei muttered to himself as he watched the Porsche 911 disappear into the distance. In the beginning, Ling Qingxue was still slightly hostile towards Lu You and Jiang Yue, who had suddenly appeared. Later on, she had only returned to her room to “prepare” the medicine for a short while, so how did she become familiar with the two of them? Not only did he add her on WeChat, but he also sold himself to the two of them ... From Ling Qingxue’s perspective, shouldn’t she hope that she would stay as far away from them as possible? Why did she do the exact opposite? Xia ruofei racked his brains but could not think of a reason for Ling Qingxue’s actions. He also thought of everything that had happened when he was with Lu You and Jiang Yue. Ling Qingxue actually knew everything about it. He could not help but smile bitterly. A familiar voice seemed to ring in his ears. Don’t try to guess what a girl is thinking about a boy. Don’t guess, don’t guess. You won’t understand no matter how much you try to guess. I don’t understand ……
