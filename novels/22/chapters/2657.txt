2658 Revisiting an old place (2)

Although the entire camp was packing up, the honor room was still quiet and neat, no one came to disturb them.

Guo Zhan probably wanted to move this unit’s glorious history to the new camp area after they settled down!

In the most eye – catching position in the honor room, there was a photo of Xia ruofei. It was taken after he had been called back to participate in the 615 mission and achieved second – Class merit.

However, Xia ruofei did not stay in these places for long, including his own photos. He only glanced at them and went straight in.

Xia ruofei soon arrived in front of a wall. Unlike the other parts of the honor room, which were designed with a fiery red color tone, this wall was mainly black and white. There was a black flannel Flower in the middle of the wall, and two black ribbons extended from the Flannel Flower to both sides, giving off a solemn feeling.

Rows of black – and – White photos were neatly hung on the wall. It was a Wall of Heroes, with the portraits of all the martyrs who had sacrificed since the establishment of the lone wolf assault team.

The Wall of Heroes was silent.

Xia ruofei’s eyes scanned the young faces in the photos and finally stopped on the second to last photo, which was a familiar face.

Lin Hu was Xia ruofei’s good comrade and brother in the new recruit company. They had joined the Army together and then joined the lone wolf assault team together. In order to protect Xia ruofei, he had sacrificed himself in the forest.

Xia ruofei muttered,”Hu Zi, how are you doing over there?” I promised you that your mother will be my mother from now on, and now she’s my godmother ... Qiao’ er has already been admitted to a University, Heron Island University, and it’s one of the top advertising majors in the country. If you were this good at your studies, you wouldn’t have joined the Army ...”

Xia ruofei was chatting with Lin Hu as if he was a friend. As they talked, his eyes turned red ...

Then, Xia ruofei’s eyes fell on the last and latest photo.

In the photo, monitor old Luo’s lips were slightly pursed, his eyes were bright, and his face had begun to show the vicissitudes of time.

“Class monitor, I know that you are most worried about sister – in – Law and Nan Nan.” Xia ruofei said,”don’t worry. Sister – in – Law is working in my company now. Nan Nan has also been transferred to the best primary school in Sanshan. The elderly in your family are also being well taken care of. You don’t know ... Nan Nan is very smart! She couldn’t keep up with the progress when she first transferred, but her grades quickly shot up to the top of the class, and all the teachers praised her ...”

Xia ruofei felt that his vision was a little blurry. He rubbed his eyes and looked at Lin Hu and Luo Zhicheng on the Wall of Heroes. They seemed to have heard what Xia ruofei had said, and the smile on their faces grew wider.

……

The civil servant, little Zhao, jogged all the way to the cafeteria and conveyed Guo Zhan’s instructions to the purser. After leaving the few hundred Yuan, he ran to the honor room.

“Little Zhao!” The fat director shouted from behind him. You brat, make yourself clear! What kind of guests was Brigade leader Guo going to entertain? How many people are there?”

Without turning his head, little Zhao said loudly,””Class monitor, the chief only has one guest, but I don’t know how many people he’ll bring!”

“Who’s the guest?” The purser shouted,”I should at least understand his taste, right?”

“Class monitor Xia!” Xiao Zhao shouted,”you should know what flavor of dishes class monitor Xia likes, right?”

“Which class monitor Xia is it?” The purser was speechless.

Xiao Zhao had already run past the corner of the cafeteria, but his voice could still be heard faintly,””Which class monitor Xia can it be? Xia ruofei, class monitor Xia!”

After the Secretary heard this, he couldn’t help but feel a little dazed. Xia ruofei’s thin figure appeared in his mind. He scratched his head and grinned as he muttered to himself,””Little Xia, you’re back?”

The epaulet of the purser was a class four Sergeant Major with two thick crutches. Xia ruofei was really a new recruit in front of him.

The Secretary turned around and shouted towards the kitchen,””Boys! Everyone, raise your spirits! Help me prepare a table full of dishes!”

After saying that, the agile fat man quickly walked into the kitchen operation room and directed the Warriors of the cooking squad to get busy.

Xiao Zhao arrived at the entrance of the honor room but did not see Xia ruofei.

He peeked in and saw that Xia ruofei was still standing quietly in front of the Wall of Heroes. He heaved a sigh of relief. He held the door frame of the room of honor and took a few deep breaths. Then, he stood upright and waited outside.

However, after waiting for a long time, there was no movement from inside. Xiao Zhao could not help but look out again. When he saw that Xia ruofei was still standing in front of the Wall of Heroes, he immediately turned back and stood up straight again.

As time passed, little Zhao’s legs were numb from standing outside the honor room. He couldn’t help but stomp his feet secretly. He could no longer maintain the standard military posture. In fact, after standing there for so long, he was like a pancake. The soldiers passing by couldn’t help but take a few more glances at him. He also felt that he was a little silly.

Xiao Zhao had peeked into the honor room several times, but he only saw Xia ruofei standing quietly in front of the Wall of Heroes. He did not move at all. Every time he looked in, Xia ruofei’s position, posture, and even the angle of his head were almost exactly the same.

Xiao Zhao did not dare to disturb him and could only wait patiently outside.

When Xia ruofei finally walked out of the honor room, Xiao Zhao was on the verge of tears. Xia ruofei had been in there for the entire afternoon and the sky was starting to get dark.

Xia ruofei stayed there for the whole afternoon while Xiao Zhao stood at the entrance of the honor room for the whole afternoon. Now, his legs didn’t even seem to belong to him. However, Xia ruofei acted as if nothing had happened. Xiao Zhao clearly saw that Xia ruofei didn’t move at all the whole afternoon.

“I’m sorry! “Sorry to keep you waiting ...” Xia ruofei said with a gentle smile.

“I’m fine! I’m fine!” Xiao Zhao quickly said,”class monitor Xia, if you still don’t come out, I really have to go in and call you!”

“Don’t worry! I remember it’s mealtime. ” Xia ruofei smiled.”Besides, I wasn’t asleep. The call for the end of exercise was so loud. How could I not have heard it?”

Xiao Zhao chuckled and scratched his head. A God is a God! You can even reach such a level of military posture, we weaklings really can’t compare!

Xia ruofei and Xiao Zhao arrived at the canteen in no time.

Xia ruofei went straight to the second floor from the side stairs. He was too familiar with this place. He knew that there was a small private room on the second floor of the cafeteria. If Guo Zhan entertained guests, he could only do it here. There was no other choice.

In fact, the usage rate of this private room was extremely low. The Commando leadership, including Guo Zhan, usually ate with the soldiers in the large cafeteria. There was no special treatment at all.

It was only because Xia ruofei had come today that Guo Zhan made an exception.

Even so, Guo Zhan still paid out of his own pocket and did not encroach on the soldiers “interests.

Xiao Zhao followed behind Xia ruofei and walked up the stairs with heavy steps.

When they arrived at the door of the private room, Xiao Zhao quickly called out,””Report!” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“No need to report! Tell that kid to get the hell in here!” Guo Zhan’s voice came from the private room.

Xiao Zhao looked at Xia ruofei with a strange expression.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you can go!”

“Alright! Then I’ll go down to the kitchen and urge the Secretary to serve the dishes!” Xiao Zhao said quickly.

Xia ruofei nodded, pushed the door open, and entered the room.

As soon as he entered the door, Xia ruofei felt a strong wind behind his head. He smirked. His body didn’t move at all, but he moved half a meter away. Then, without looking back, his right hand passed under his left armpit and grabbed behind him, accurately catching a fist.

Xia ruofei squeezed it lightly, and a strange cry came from behind him ...

...
