2967 Who’s the fool (2)

However, Xia ruofei couldn’t explain it. He even felt that since Li Yifu and Luo Qingfeng misunderstood that he was deliberately raising the price to make Wu Ming consume more, he should just continue to misunderstand ...

He didn’t say anything, but focused on the big screen above the auction stage.

Originally, the other cultivators had no interest in this ore and had already turned on their spectator mode. Now that Wu Ming had made such an unreasonable bid, naturally, no one would respond.

As a result, Hao Qingsong began to perform his duty and asked if there were any cultivators who wanted to increase the price.

This time, Xia ruofei didn’t wait for Hao Qingsong to ask for the third time and directly pressed the button to increase the bid.

On the screen, the price was updated again. It was now 1510 spiritual stones. The bidder was naturally from room 20, where Xia ruofei was.

Li Yifu and Luo Qingfeng could not help but look at Xia ruofei with worry.

Li Yifu hesitated for a moment before saying,””Martial granduncle, why don’t you ... Quit while you’re ahead! What if the other party gives up ...”

Xia ruofei revealed an unfathomable smile and waved his hand.””It’s fine, I know what to do!”

Since Xia ruofei had said so, Li Yifu and Luo Qingfeng naturally could not say anything more. They just stared at the big screen with slight apprehension, hoping that the “fool” in room 15 would quickly bid.

Xia ruofei’s mood was the exact opposite of Li Yifu and Luo Qingfeng ‘s.

Of course, Xia ruofei also knew that it would not be easy to make Wu Ming give up so easily.

This kind of ‘rich second generation’ in the world of cultivation probably valued their face more. Rationality and such did not exist!

In fact, it was true.

In Box 15, Wu Ming was already flying into a rage.

He gritted his teeth and said,”uncle Feng!” This guy in room 20 is deliberately slapping my face! I’ll add 10 spirit stones each time!”

Luo Feng secretly sighed and said,”Young sect leader, it’s just a small dispute. We’ve already expressed our sincerity to the first heaven society ...”

Before Luo Feng could finish his words, Wu Ming glared at him and said,”I definitely won’t give up like this! It was only a few thousand spirit stones! I, Wu Ming, am not someone who can’t afford to play!”

After saying that, Wu Ming snorted coldly and directly entered the number 2000 spirit stones into the bidding machine. Then, he pressed the submit button without any hesitation.

Luo Feng’s eyes twitched as he watched from the side. His heart really ached for the spirit stones!

However, Luo Feng really couldn’t persuade his young sect master.

He was now highly suspicious that the other party was deliberately starting a fire and digging a hole for Wu Ming to jump into.

Moreover, it looked like the other party was certain that he had Wu Ming in the palm of his hand and would not stop so easily ...

As expected, the 2000 spirit stones bid only appeared on the big screen for a few seconds. Before Hao Qingsong could announce the latest bid, the cultivator in room 20 once again placed a bid, and the price on the big screen was immediately updated to 2010 spirit stones.

Wu Ming’s expression turned extremely unsightly. He stood up abruptly and removed the sound – proof barrier he had set up earlier. Then, he said sinisterly,”My friend in room 20, are you deliberately going against our spirit Vulture mountain?”

Xia ruofei didn’t hide this time. After a slight smile, he said directly,””Young sect leader Wu, why do you say that? The ore provided by elder Chen of the first heaven society is so mysterious. Can’t I be interested in it? The rule of the auction is nothing more than the one with the highest price will get it. If young master Wu really wants this ore, you don’t need to threaten me with words. As long as you bid higher than me, I can’t take this ore, right?”

“Very good!” Wu Ming gritted his teeth and said,”it seems that my reputation is really worthless! Then let’s see the price!”

Wu Ming had completely hated the person in room 20. He would definitely find out the identity of the cultivator in room 20 at all costs and then take revenge. But right now, he didn’t have the time to do this. The most important thing was naturally to win this auction and win back his face.

Therefore, since he had already said so much, Wu Ming simply quoted the price.

In the style of the young sect leader, he raised the price to 2500 spiritual stones.

In room 20, Xia ruofei did not hesitate to raise the bid. His bid was also very stable. It was only 10 spiritual stones, not a single more.

In Wu Ming’s eyes, this was a mockery of him.

Three thousand spirit stones! Wu Ming continued to raise the price in exasperation.

In room 20, Xia ruofei continued to follow up unhurriedly and updated the price to 3010 spiritual stones.

Beside him, Li Yifu and Luo Qingfeng watched with fear, afraid that it would fall into their hands.

Wu Ming increased the price without a care, raising it to 500 spirit stones each time.

Xia ruofei followed them calmly, paying no more or no less 10 spiritual stones each time.

After a few rounds, the final price had reached 6010 spirit stones, which was a small change of 10 spirit stones. Naturally, the bidder was from room 20.

Luo Feng finally came back to his senses when he saw that the price had already reached an unimaginable level.

He grabbed the hot – headed Wu Ming.

Wu Ming suddenly turned his head and glared at Luo Feng, fiercely shouting,””Uncle Feng! What are you doing? Do you want me to give in to that kid? I’m telling you! No way!”

“Young sect master, please calm down!” Luo Feng said earnestly. There’s something fishy about this!”

“The other party has already thrown my face to the ground and stepped on it. How can I calm down?” Wu Ming roared.Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎
