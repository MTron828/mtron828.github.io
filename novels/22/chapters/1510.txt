Chapter 1511: Giving a helping hand (3)

Translator: 549690339

Upon closer inspection, Xia ruofei realized that there were three deep claw marks on the little white beast’s hind leg. The base of its hind leg was already split open and blood was seeping out.

Xia ruofei comforted the little white beast with his words while using a clean bamboo piece to pick out some black ointment and carefully applied it on the little white beast’s wound.

The little white beast trembled a little, and then its vigilance disappeared completely. It showed a trace of comfort. The effect of the ointment added with the petals of the spirit Heart Flower was immediate. It could already feel that the pain in its wound had reduced a lot, and the blood was no longer flowing. It also felt very cool.

The little white beast had confirmed that Xia ruofei really had no ill intentions towards it. It looked at Xia ruofei more affectionately.

Xia ruofei smiled and carefully applied the ointment on the little white beast’s wound. Then, he took out medical gauze and tape from the medium and skillfully bandaged it.

Soon, Xia ruofei stood up and said in a relaxed tone,””Alright, little guy, your injuries should be fine in a while.”

“Ji ji ji ji ...” The little white beast barked at Xia ruofei, as if it was thanking him for his help.

Xia ruofei chuckled.”No need to thank me. It’s fate that brought us together. Besides, the enemy of my enemy is my friend!”

He had just seen the little white beast being chased by the puppet, and the wound on the little white beast had clearly been left behind by the puppet.

Xia ruofei did not know if the little white beast understood him, but it raised its two front legs and put them together. It bowed to Xia ruofei like a human bowing. Xia ruofei could not help but laugh.

He waved his hand and said,”I already said you don’t have to thank me. Little guy, you can go!” If you encounter those puppets again, you’d better be smart and run! You’re so fast, they shouldn’t be able to catch up to you!” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

With that, Xia ruofei kept the ointment, gauze, and other things back into the medium and was ready to leave.

He didn’t notice that when Xia ruofei kept the items, the little white beast seemed to have felt a spatial fluctuation and its eyes lit up.

Xia ruofei took two steps forward and realized that the little white beast had followed him. It bit his pants and pulled him in one direction.

“What’s going on?”Xia ruofei couldn’t help but ask.

“Master, it probably wants to take you somewhere.” Xia Qing said,”you might as well follow it and take a look. I don’t think it has any ill intentions.”

Xia ruofei nodded and smiled.””Alright, alright, stop pulling. I’ll go with you, alright?”

The little white beast was indeed very intelligent. After hearing Xia ruofei’s words, it let go of Xia ruofei’s pants and started to lead the way.

Soon, they passed through the straight passage. The path ahead was similar to the trap & kill array that Xia ruofei had used when he first entered. There were more forks in the path, and there was no pattern to it.

However, the little white beast seemed to be very familiar with the environment. It led Xia ruofei through many turns and walked for a full 20 minutes.

Along the way, they encountered many puppets, including the two puppets that were as powerful as the ones that had chased after the little white beast. Fortunately, Xia ruofei had a gun, which was a powerful weapon, so they were safe.

Finally, they arrived at a place.

It was a smooth stone wall, but there was a layer of colorful light on the surface. Xia ruofei used his spiritual power to sense it and cried out in surprise,””This is a formation!”
