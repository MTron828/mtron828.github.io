2419 Chapter 1335 – without anyone knowing (1)

Xia ruofei had been standing behind a pillar not far away. There was a trash can there. Many smokers who had been on the plane all the way could not wait to take out their cigarettes and smoke after leaving the No – smoking zone of the airport.

Xia ruofei had a cigarette in his hand as well. He looked no different from a regular smoker, but his spiritual power was constantly spreading in the direction of Liu haojun and Liu Feng, paying attention to their every move.

It was only after the two of them exchanged a few words and went to the parking lot to get their cars that Xia ruofei put out the cigarette in the trash can. Then, he walked to the side of the road and queued for a while before getting into a taxi.

“Where are we going?” The driver was a big man from the Northwest. He looked at Xia ruofei and asked.

“Drive towards the city.” Xia ruofei said indifferently.

The taxi driver glanced at Xia ruofei strangely. It was rare to see such a passenger. They did not even have a clear destination and just asked someone to drive them to the city ... However, as long as the other party paid, the driver did not want to ask too much. After all, they were all taking a taxi.

So he nodded, started the car, and slowly drove to the exit of the airport.

Xia ruofei’s mental power was constantly monitoring Liu haojun and Liu Feng. He knew that they were in a white Buick GL8 and had just left the airport.

After leaving the airport, Xia ruofei pointed to the car in front and said,””Sir, follow the car in front.”

The taxi driver finally couldn’t help but say,””Brother, where do you want to go? Let me make this clear first! We won’t do anything illegal!”

Xia ruofei replied indifferently,”don’t worry, I’m also a law – abiding citizen!” However, the person in the car in front of me owes me a large sum of money. I’ve chased him all the way here from another city, so I should at least know where he went, right?”

The taxi driver muttered in his heart,’could this guy be from a debt collection company? It didn’t look like it! How could he have any deterrent power with his soft skin and tender flesh?

In his impression, the people in debt collection companies were all fierce – looking and fierce. If a person like this passenger were to collect debts, those debtors would probably not be afraid at all!

Just as he was hesitating, Xia ruofei casually took out a stack of cash from his wallet and said indifferently,””Follow that car and this money is yours!”

The taxi driver quickly glanced at the stack of money. It was all red hundred – Yuan bills. From the thickness, he estimated that the stack of money was at least one or two thousand Yuan.

How much did the person in the car in front owe him? “So much money for just following him ...” The taxi driver muttered in his heart and couldn’t help but swallow his saliva.

“Sir, if we don’t make a decision now, we’re going to lose the car in front ...” Xia ruofei said.

The taxi driver came back to his senses and quickly stepped on the accelerator, speeding up the car.

He said righteously,”little brother!” I hate those who owe money and don’t pay it back! Don’t worry! I’ll definitely keep a close eye on that car ...” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei wanted to laugh. Money talks. If it was not for the stack of hundred – Yuan bills, the taxi driver would probably have a different story.

The driver sped up the car and the distance between the two cars quickly closed.

Xia ruofei immediately warned,”don’t get too close!” The other party will notice!”

“Yes, yes, yes! “I’m a little anxious ...”The taxi driver laughed dryly and slowed down slightly.

Xia ruofei’s feeling was very accurate. Since old master Liu could send Liu Feng to carry out such a mission, it showed that he had absolute trust in Liu Feng. On the other hand, it also showed that Liu Feng must be very capable.

In fact, when the taxi suddenly accelerated and quickly approached the Buick minivan, Liu Feng, who was sitting in the car, had already felt that something was wrong. He looked back twice. Although the taxi was still many cars away from them, he still felt that something was wrong.

This was an instinct.

Liu Feng frowned and said to the driver,”Increase the speed!”

Liu haojun asked curiously,””Brother Feng, what’s wrong? You’re in a hurry?”

“I suspect that someone is following us ...” Liu Feng said with a serious expression.

“F * ck! Who’s so bold!” Liu haojun immediately shouted.

“Maybe I’m wrong!” Liu Feng waved his hand. Anyway, there’s nothing wrong with being careful. Let’s speed up and see if the other party will catch up!”

“Lao Xu, speed up!” Liu haojun nodded and said.

Liu Feng added,”speed up a little more. If the distance between us is widened all of a sudden, the opponent will easily reveal his flaws!”

“Yes!” Old Xu nodded and said.

Then, he stepped on the gas pedal heavily. The engine of the Buick minivan roared, and the speed of the car suddenly increased.

In the car behind, the driver saw the Buick minivan suddenly accelerate and subconsciously wanted to speed up as well.

However, Xia ruofei shouted,”don’t accelerate!” The other party might have already noticed that something is wrong. Once you accelerate, they will immediately get an accurate judgment!”

The driver immediately retracted his foot that had already been stepped on. The engine of the taxi rumbled and the sound immediately became softer, but the speed of the car did not increase significantly.

The taxi driver looked at the Buick minivan in front of him, which was getting smaller and smaller, and said anxiously,””Little brother, if we don’t speed up, we won’t be able to see that car!”
