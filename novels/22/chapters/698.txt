Chapter 699: Trial mass production success (1)

After the medicinal ingredients entered the production line, Xue Jinshan was watching nervously from the side.

Even though the process of the herb’s brewing could not be seen from the outside, Xue Jinshan did not dare to take a single step away.

After a short while, the indicator light of the feed port lit up and made a beeping sound. The LED screen above the feed port began to roll out the medicinal materials that needed to be put in one minute.

Xue Jinshan hurriedly prepared the herbs according to the ratio and personally put them into the feeding mouth.

Xia ruofei had been watching the entire process from the control room.

An hour later, Xia ruofei and Xue Jinshan received a large jar of medicinal soup. As it was a trial production, Xia ruofei did not need to go through the filling process.

Xia ruofei carefully observed the color of the medicinal soup and even personally scooped a small spoonful and put it in his mouth to taste.

Xue Jinshan immediately took a test tube sample and handed the first trial production of the heart – nourishing soup to several undergraduate students.

They would test the various active ingredients in the soup and compare it with the data of Xia ruofei’s heart – nourishing soup.

Xia ruofei also filled a small bottle and put it in his bag after labeling it.

In reality, he had only done the action of putting the medicinal soup into his bag, but he had already sent the bottle of medicinal soup into the spirit map space.

Xia ruofei used his heart to inform Xia Qing and asked him to appraise this bottle of heart – nourishing soup.

From his previous inquiries, Xia ruofei knew that Xia Qing was very familiar with the unlocked formulas in the booklet, including heart – nourishing soup, spirit – nourishing soup, body – tempering soup, and so on.

......

In terms of understanding of medicinal herbs, even ten Xia ruofeis couldn’t compare to one Xia Qing.

Hence, Xia ruofei immediately asked Xia Qing to identify the heart – nourishing soup that was in trial production.

After Xia Qing received Xia ruofei’s orders in the space, she was very efficient. In a short while, she had sent back the feedback to Xia ruofei through telepathy.

Xia ruofei began to adjust the production process parameters in the computer according to Xia Qing’s feedback.

For example, if Xia Qing said that the heat of a certain medicine was not enough, Xia ruofei would increase the brewing time and raise the boiling temperature; Similarly, the amount of distilled water added, the timing of feeding, etc., Had all been adjusted to varying degrees.

Outside, Xue Jinshan had already called for workers to clean the production line. Before each trial production, the residue and medicinal liquid from the previous trial should be cleaned to avoid affecting the parameters of the test product.

After the production line was ready, Xia ruofei had finished the slight adjustments to the process parameters. They immediately started the second wave of trial production.

Similarly, Xue Jinshan had ordered someone to take a sample of the medicinal soup for testing, while Xia ruofei had taken the sealed bottle and labeled it before putting it into his bag. In reality, he had sent it into the spirit map space.

Xia Qing was like the God farmer who had tasted all kinds of herbs. She appraised the heart – nourishing soup that Xia ruofei had sent in and gave her feedback.

Xia ruofei continued to adjust the parameters according to Xia Qing’s feedback. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Xia ruofei spent the entire day in Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory, constantly adjusting the production process and parameters, and then carrying out trial production.

Xue Jinshan’s test results also showed that, with Xia ruofei’s constant adjustments, the data of the produced herbal soup was getting closer and closer to the data of the previously hand – brewed heart – nourishing soup.

After more than ten adjustments, they finally produced a heart – nourishing soup that met the standard.

Xia ruofei finally heaved a sigh of relief. This job was really tiring!

Xia ruofei immediately ordered Xue Jinshan to find someone to clean the production line thoroughly. At the same time, he sealed the entire production process parameters.

In the future, during production, he could only use this data package, but he would not be able to see the original data.

Moreover, this data package had a self – destruction program. If it was cracked by force, all the data would be deleted.

The control computer was isolated from the internet and only connected to the production line in the sterile workshop, so the possibility of a hacker stealing information remotely was almost zero.

Xia ruofei was also very concerned about keeping the recipe of the heart – nourishing soup a secret. He immediately called Lei Hu and informed him to send four old soldiers to the factory.

These veterans were not in charge of the specific security work. Their only task was to protect the computer. The four of them took turns to make sure that the control room was guarded 24 hours a day.

Even during the trial production in the future, the technicians who used the computer to transfer the program must be under the supervision of these veterans. Any other unnecessary operations would be immediately stopped.

Xia ruofei asked Xue Jinshan to prepare a dormitory for the four veterans in the pharmaceutical factory. At the same time, a small room was set up next to the control room for the four veterans to be on duty.

Xia ruofei waited for the ex – soldiers to arrive at the factory before he personally reminded them of the importance of the control computer. He then specifically told them their mission.

These veterans were Xia ruofei’s most trusted people. There was no doubt about their loyalty. Hence, whenever it came to such an important position, Xia ruofei would always think of them first.

After arranging everything, Xia ruofei left the pharmaceutical factory with Xue Jinshan.

The entire factory was temporarily in a state of shutdown. Xia ruofei let the newly hired Min Jiang pharmaceutical Deputy Director take charge of the factory temporarily and led the workers to clean up the factory’s environment.

This was because the pharmaceutical factory was about to start the trial production of the heart – nourishing soup, and at the same time, it would also welcome the first review by the provincial Drug Administration.
