Xia ruofei said calmly,”chief Liu, you’ve misunderstood. I’m only here to meet elder Liu. As for other things, it’s not too early to say. After all, elder Liu’s condition is very serious. No one can guarantee anything.”

Liu Qunfeng’s expression froze. He was just being polite, but Xia ruofei refused to budge. Although he felt a little unhappy, he did not dare to show it at this time.

Even though he was a Minister, he had no power in front of Xia ruofei.

This time, elder song had used his own car and even sent the head of security to protect Xia ruofei. This was already a very obvious gesture.

To put it bluntly, no matter how powerful Liu Qunfeng was or how powerful the Liu family was, they could not do much to Xia ruofei, who was under the protection of the song family. Besides, once old man Liu passed away, the Liu family would have no time to hide their wealth. How could they have the energy to stir up more trouble?

On the contrary, Xia ruofei had the capital to do so. There was no other reason other than the fact that there was no cure for elder Liu’s illness. Even the best specialist on the planet could not save his life. However, Xia ruofei might have the means to miraculously recover elder Liu.

The Liu family was quite confident in this judgment. After all, elder song’s condition was not much better than elder Liu ‘s. Even when elder song was on the verge of death, Xia ruofei pulled him back from the gates of hell. Not only that, but elder song was getting stronger and stronger. It seemed that he would have no problem living to a hundred years old.

This made the Liu family envious and jealous. They were even more enthusiastic about Xia ruofei’s matter.

Liu Qunfeng’s eyes flickered, and he smiled.””That’s true, that’s true ... In the face of such an illness, who would dare to guarantee anything? I just hope that Mr. Xia can do his best to help my father. This is also a plea as a son! I hope Mr. Xia won’t take offense. ”

Xia ruofei was unmoved by Liu qun’s emotional card. He just smiled and said,””Chief Liu, I think I’d better meet elder Liu first! We’ll talk about it after we meet!”

“Alright! My father just had an IV drip, and he’s still in good spirits. ” “Mr. Xia, this way please,” Liu Qunfeng said.

After that, Liu Qunfeng led Xia ruofei and Fang Zhongming into the building.

The building looked very ordinary from the outside, but the sentries around the building and the tight security line at the entrance had already shown that it was not ordinary.

This building was called the “South Building” in 301 Hospital. It was dedicated to receiving important patients, and there were many retired old Chiefs who recuperated here all year round.

Before retirement, elder Liu had been at the same level as elder song, so he naturally had the highest level of medical protection.

Elder Liu’s ward was located on the sixth floor of the South Building, in the northernmost suite. Other than the spacious Ward, there were also a few attached rooms. The staff and nurses could all stay in the suite so that it was convenient for them to serve the chief.

Liu Qunfeng took Xia ruofei and Fang Zhongming to the door of the ward on the sixth floor. Xia ruofei stopped and looked at Liu Qunfeng.””Chief Liu, I hope that no one will disturb my meeting with elder Liu. Is that okay?”

Liu Qunfeng hesitated, then said,””Mr. Xia, my father’s condition is quite serious. There’s usually a doctor on duty next to him to prevent any unexpected situations ...”

Xia ruofei rudely interrupted Liu Qunfeng and said,””With me here, there won’t be any unexpected situations. If you’re suspicious of even this, I think there’s no need for the Liu family to invite me here.”

The Liu family had invited him here to save their lives. If there was a sudden change in her condition during the conversation and Xia ruofei could not handle it, how could he overcome the illness?

The reason was simple, and Liu Qunfeng naturally understood. He pondered for a moment, then nodded and said,””I’ll have everyone withdraw. ”

Xia ruofei nodded.

“Mr. Xia, please wait for a moment. I’ll go check on my father,” Liu Qunfeng said.

Then, Liu Qunfeng nodded at Xia ruofei and Fang Zhongming, gently pushed the door open, and walked in.

After a while, Liu Qunfeng walked out of the ward with a few medical staff. He said to Xia ruofei,”Mr. Xia, please come in!”

Xia ruofei nodded slightly and looked at Fang Zhongming.

“Don’t worry, Mr. Xia,” Fang Zhongming said lightly.”I’ll keep guard at the door and not let any unrelated people get close.”

The muscles on Liu Qunfeng’s face twitched slightly. So, as elder Liu’s son, he had become an unrelated person?

Liu Qunfeng was a little upset, but his many years of experience in politics had made him calm. He acted as if he hadn’t heard anything. His expression didn’t change as he walked straight to the long chair and sat down.

Xia ruofei pushed the door open and walked in.

The ward was very heartwarming, and there was almost no disinfectant smell in the air, which was common in hospitals. The curtains were half – Open, and the afternoon sun shone on a pot of green plants on the window sill, making it look full of vitality.

On the bed, a Haggard old man was lying quietly.

The moment Xia ruofei entered the room, the old man’s gaze fell on him.
