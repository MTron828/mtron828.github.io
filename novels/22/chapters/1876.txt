“If you don’t have anything urgent to do, please come to my office.” Xia ruofei said indifferently.

“Alright, I’ll be right there!” Lei Hu said.

Now, the security of the new headquarters was mainly in the charge of Lei Hu. Ye Lingyun stayed at the farm more often. He was more interested in making tea, so the security matters were gradually handed over to Lei Hu.

Two minutes later, Lei Hu appeared in Xia ruofei’s office.

Xia ruofei motioned for Lei Hu to sit down and said,””Hu, there’s something that I need a few of our brothers to help with ...”

“Brother Xia, if there’s anything you need, just tell me!” Lei Hu grinned and said,”now that the security team has expanded a lot, our work is usually very easy. All of us feel that we are not worthy of the high salary given by the company!”

Xia ruofei said seriously,”this matter ... Has a certain risk, so it’s all voluntary.” No matter what the final result is, the brothers who participate will each receive 200000! In the worst case scenario, the arrested Brotherhood would get one million Yuan, and their family, children, and company would be in charge! Of course, the possibility of such a problem happening is not high. If there is, I can send my brothers to Australia to lie low. It just so happens that I need a few of my own people to help out with my business there ...”

When Lei Hu heard this, his heart trembled slightly.

He knew that what Xia ruofei wanted them to do was definitely not simple. It might even be illegal. Otherwise, he would not have taken it so seriously. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

A trace of hesitation flashed through Lei Hu’s heart, but he quickly said with determination,”Brother Xia, since the day we entered the company, we’ve entrusted our lives to you! Speak! What do you need us to do? We won’t frown even if we have to climb a mountain of daggers or plunge into a pot of boiling oil!”

Xia ruofei laughed and scolded,”why do you make it sound so tragic?” It’s not as dangerous as you think. I’m just preparing for a rainy day ...”

Lei Hu chuckled and said,”brother Xia, just assign the task!” In addition, you’re already paying our brothers a very high salary. Do you really need to pay so much extra for a small thing? You can just give the order directly!”

Xia ruofei said,”of course, you have to pay. After all, this is not a task within the scope of the job. You have to take some risks. You deserve it!”

Lei Hu grinned and did not say anything.

Although he looked like a rough person, he was actually very meticulous. He knew very well that the money that Xia ruofei had prepared was not only to pay them, but also to seal their mouths.

Taking this money was equivalent to agreeing to this matter, and no matter how things developed in the future, this matter would rot in his heart. Even if she was unfortunately caught, this matter had absolutely nothing to do with Xia ruofei and the Paradise Corporation.

Xia ruofei naturally knew that Lei Hu was a smart person and did not need to make things clear. A few words of advice would be enough.

He smiled and continued,”this matter requires three to five people. You’ll be one of them. The rest will be up to you. As I said before, everything is voluntary. The other people must be absolutely reliable!”

“Understood!” Lei Hu stood up and said,”I’ll go settle the personnel matters first, then I’ll come back to you to accept the mission!”

Xia ruofei looked at Lei Hu with admiration, then smiled and nodded,””Bring your team here to see me at 9 a.m. Tomorrow!” He said.
