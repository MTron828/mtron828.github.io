Chapter 1806: A coincidental encounter at the restaurant (2)

Translator: 549690339

“Let’s go to Ling Ji’s private kitchen!” Xia ruofei said to Xie Bing.

“Yes, President Xia!” Xie Bing replied as he drove.

“I knew it ... You didn’t even forget to take care of your girlfriend’s business!” Feng Jing said.

“Be content!” Xia ruofei said,”who was the one who couldn’t forget this dish after eating the ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ from Ling Ji’s private kitchen?”

Feng Rao blushed and said,””That dish is indeed delicious! Chairman, since we’re going to your girlfriend’s shop today, the Buddha Jumps Over the Wall soup is a must! Why don’t you call and inform them first, in case they’re all sold out? you’ll be the one losing face!”

Xia ruofei replied easily,”don’t worry!” If you follow me, you will definitely be able to eat the most authentic Buddha Jumps Over the Wall whenever you go!”

Xia ruofei was the one who had provided the recipe for the ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ to Ling Xiaotian. Now, it had become the Golden signboard of Ling Ji’s private kitchen and could only be obtained in advance.

Of course, the private restaurant would reserve a few servings every day in preparation for customers like Xia ruofei.

Very quickly, the car arrived at Ling Ji private kitchen.

The waiters at the entrance all knew who Xia ruofei was. Originally, the matter between Xia ruofei and the little princess of the Ling Ji food and beverage group had already been circulating within the Ling Ji group. A few days ago, Xia ruofei had even generously announced his relationship with Ling Qingxue on Weibo, and that made it even more well – known.

When the waiter saw Xia ruofei, he quickly greeted him.””Good afternoon, Mr. Xia!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””The flying Snow Pavilion is empty, right?” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Yes! Please follow me!” The waiter said immediately.

Although the flying Snow Pavilion was called a private room, it was actually a small independent courtyard. It was usually not open to me. It was only used when Ling Xiaotian and Ling Qingxue invited their friends. Of course, if Xia ruofei was here, he could use it too.

“You’ll see how rich our boss is soon enough. The entire courtyard is his private room ...”Feng Rao whispered to Dong Yun.

How sharp were Xia ruofei’s ears? He immediately turned around and said,””Boss Feng, you’re not allowed to frame me behind my back!”

“Yes, yes, yes, this is your own business!” Feng Rao immediately smiled. No matter how extravagant your spending is, you can’t be considered a local tyrant ...”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. Luckily, the manager of Ling’s private kitchen came over and helped him out of the situation.

“Hello, Mr. Xia!” The store manager greeted Xia ruofei respectfully.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”I’m bringing a few colleagues over for dinner. Tell the kitchen to prepare four small portions of ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’. Once they’re done, send them to flying Snow Pavilion immediately!” As for the other dishes, you can choose what you’re good at!”

“Alright!” The store manager quickly replied.

Xia ruofei saw that the store manager was still standing at the side after he had finished speaking. He asked curiously,””You still have something to do?”

“Mr. Xia, um ... The lady will be here soon. I’m waiting for her here ...” The store manager said quickly.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel a little embarrassed. So he was thinking too much ... Wait! Young miss? Then wouldn’t that be Ling Qingxue?

Even though the manager of Ling Ji’s private kitchen wasn’t Ling Xiaotian’s personal disciple, he was still a veteran employee who had served Ling Ji for many years. Only these people would address Ling Qingxue as “young miss.”

“Qingxue is coming?” Xia ruofei asked.

“Yes, the general manager’s office just informed us that the young miss has already set off from the company’s headquarters!” The store manager asked honestly.

He said in his heart, didn’t you guys make an appointment?

With that thought, the manager looked at Feng Rao and Dong Yun. Could it be that there was something going on between him and these two beauties, and the young miss came to catch them in the act?

However, he quickly dismissed this thought. He was afraid that Xia ruofei would not bring a woman who had an ambiguous relationship with him to Ling Ji dining hall. This was the Ling family’s business!

Xia ruofei must have a clear conscience if he dared to bring her here.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”what a coincidence!” President Feng, President Dong, please go to the private room and sit down first! My girlfriend will be here soon, I’ll wait for her here!”

“Then let’s just wait together!” Feng Rao said. He didn’t have anything to do anyway. President Dong doesn’t know the Chairman’s girlfriend yet, right? I’m telling you, she’s really pretty ...”

“Chairman, let’s wait here together!” Dong Yun said with a smile. You’re our leader, and your girlfriend is your leader! We can’t be impolite!”

“What nonsense is this?” Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.”You’re talking in a tongue twister!”

“You dare to say that Qingxue isn’t your superior?” Feng Rao giggled and asked,”why don’t you try saying that in front of her later?”

Xia ruofei sneered,” I’ll say that no matter where I go ...”

He was halfway through his sentence when he suddenly felt that the atmosphere was a little off. He became alert and quickly used his spiritual power.

Sure enough, Ling Qingxue had already walked in through the door. Ling Qingxue must have heard their conversation just now. As for the store manager, who was standing there with an unnatural expression, he was naturally stopped by Ling Qingxue’s gaze.

How fast was Xia ruofei’s brain working? “Qingxue is my superior!” He immediately changed his tone and said. In my family, I make the big decisions, and Qingxue makes the small decisions. As for the big or small matters, it’s Qingxue who decides them!”

Feng Rao burst out laughing and said,””How boring! I knew your ears were sharp, you must have heard the footsteps!”
