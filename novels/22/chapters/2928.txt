2929 Lowering your stance (2)

As for the big entrepreneurs in China, they were rich, but in terms of influence, none of them was more impressive than Charlie cohe.

The more Goodman was puzzled, the more terrified he became.

As he thought of this, he quickly said,”Mr. Ke he!” 100 million US dollars! As long as your Chinese friends are willing to understand, our Bay group is willing to pay 100 million US dollars in compensation! Also, I promise that from now on, there will be no racial discrimination against Chinese people in Mexico! We will publicly announce that any racial discrimination against China will be severely cracked Down by the Bay group!”

In just a few minutes, Goodman had doubled the compensation of 25 million. He was really shocked.

“It doesn’t matter if it’s 50 million or 100 million. Money is never the most important thing. My Chinese friends don’t care about this small amount of money, so you don’t have to keep raising the price.”

“No, no, no! Mr. Cohe, of course, I know that you and your friend are not short of money, but money is also a way to express an apology. The amount of compensation also, in a sense, represents the sincerity of our Bay group. ” Goodman quickly said,”I hope this 100 million US dollars can show our sincerity to our Chinese friends. Please help us convey the goodwill of the Gulf Group! Black sheep like ERAD are the minority, after all. Our Bay group has always been kind to our Chinese friends!”

Charlie Cole couldn’t help but find it a little funny when he heard that. A drug trafficking gang actually said such words and described ERAD as a black sheep. Could it be that the other members of the Bay group were all pure white lotus flowers? In the entire Bay group, apart from Goodman, who had not had blood on their hands? Didn’t Goodman know how every cent of their extravagant lives came about?

However, Charlie Koch was not the embodiment of justice, and he had never been interested in eliminating all evil and maintaining world peace. On the contrary, he was a fierce patriarch rarely seen in the Koch family for decades. As long as it was beneficial to the family, he would not care whether the means were black or white!

Hence, Charlie cohe only gave a faint smile and said,“OK! I’ll pass on your words!”

“Thank you! Thank you!” Goodman quickly said,”Oh right, Mr. Cohe, when we executed ERAD, we recorded a video. I also recorded a video myself ... I wanted to apologize in person, but I wasn’t sure if your Chinese friends would be willing to see me, so I recorded a short video first to express my apology and make some promises. If it’s convenient, I hope you can help me transfer it to them ...”

“No problem!” Charlie cohe readily said,”contact my assistant, Peter! He’ll give you his email address. ” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Alright! Alright!” Goodman quickly said,”thank you, Mr. Cohe. I won’t disturb you any further ...”

In fact, what happened today made Goodman break out in a cold sweat. At the same time, he was more or less looking forward to it. If he could use this opportunity to build a relationship with the Coch family, the Gulf Group would be able to have a smoother time in Mexico in the future.

Of course, he also knew that an old and powerful family like the cohe family would definitely not have any connections with the notorious drug trafficking gang on the surface. However, it was still possible for the two sides to cooperate in private. To put it bluntly, they were just taking what they needed.

If this matter could be handled well, perhaps the crisis could turn into an opportunity.

In comparison, the cost of paying 100 million US dollars in compensation for the death of ERAD, as well as saying a few words of goodwill without wasting any money, including the protection of The Chinese in Mexico was quite low. It was not worth mentioning at all in the eyes of Goodman.

After hanging up, Charlie cohe carefully dialed the number that Xia ruofei had given him using the satellite phone.

In these two hours, Xia ruofei had also stayed in iswaatlan.

Zhang Chao settled his brothers who had evacuated from Huafeng shipping in a safe place, and together with the Hong sect brothers from isvatlan, they came up with an evacuation plan. They were also prepared to see the situation first.

Huafeng shipping was definitely out of the picture. In Zhang Chao’s opinion, Huafeng shipping might have been razed to the ground by the Bay group.

They mainly wanted to see how serious the Gulf group’s pursuit of Huafeng shipping’s employees was. If they were really wanted all over Mexico, then they needed to find a safe way to leave the country directly.

Although most of these people had lived in Mexico for a long time, and the foundation of their careers was here, nothing was more important than their lives. If it really came to that, they would have to escape decisively.

Xia ruofei and Luo Qingfeng had been arranged to stay in the same room by Zhang Chao. The conditions here were limited, and they might be on the run again today, so naturally, there was no way to arrange a single room for them.

Compared to Zhang Chao’s anxiety, Xia ruofei was calmer.

After Charlie cohe patted his chest and promised, he was no longer worried. However, there was no further news from Charlie cohe, so he did not tell Zhang Chao.

Even if he did, Zhang Chao would not believe him.

After all, in the eyes of Zhang Chao and the others, a behemoth like the Bay group was simply impossible to defeat.

Although the conditions here were average, there was wifi in the room. Xia ruofei was bored so he took out a tablet from the space and started to browse the news and Weibo to kill time.

When Charlie cohe called, Xia ruofei was engrossed in the celebrity gossip on Weibo!

His phone rang. Xia ruofei glanced at the caller ID and put his tablet aside. He answered the call.”Charlie!”

“Mr. Xia!” “Yes.” Charlie Cole respectfully said,”as per your instructions, I have mobilized the power of the Cole family and expressed strong anger and criticism to the Bay group as soon as possible. They have also carried out an urgent investigation and preliminary treatment. Are you free to answer the call now? I’ll report the situation to you. ”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”of course!” All I have now is time ... My Chinese friends have already escaped to ishwaatlan with me. Before we are sure that it is safe, they won’t let us go anywhere. We can only hide in the house and prepare for the next step of our escape ...”

“I’m sorry, I’m not in the U.S., So I can only give orders through the phone. It’s a little inefficient,”said Charlie cohe quickly.

Xia ruofei laughed,”Charlie, I’m just joking!” You’re already very efficient. Alright, let’s talk about serious matters!”

“Yes! Mr. Xia!” Charlie cohe said,”I directly spoke to the leader of the Bay group, Goodman ...”

Then, Charlie gave a detailed report to Xia ruofei about how he had handled the situation, including the information that Goodman had given him.

When Xia ruofei heard that ERAD and Madel had already been internally cleaned up by the Bay group, he was actually pretty satisfied.

What he cared about was the personal safety of the Mexico Hong sect brothers. As long as Goodman wasn’t stupid, he wouldn’t make things difficult for the Chinese. The most unstable factor was ERAD. Even with Goodman’s restraint, it was hard to guarantee that he wouldn’t be blinded by hatred and do something to the death. Since ERAD had already gone to see Satan, there was no problem with his safety.

Charlie cohe then emphasized on Goodman’s friendly attitude towards the Chinese, including his protection of The Chinese in Mexico in the future, and the suppression of racial discrimination against the Chinese, as well as the 100 million US dollars compensation that Goodman offered.

After saying this, Charlie cohe carefully asked,”Mr. Xia, do you have any opinions on the Bay group’s solution? If there’s anything you’re not satisfied with, please let me know! I’ll make them change!”
