Chapter 444: Immortals from all walks of life (3)

Meanwhile, Ling Xiaotian and the others had already started to chat with Zhou Qing and Feng Yun. Even Wu Liqian was smiling warmly as she chatted with the two of them. These two were the middle and upper echelons of large financial groups. If they could pull in one or two investments for Changping County, it would be a resounding political achievement.

Of course, Wu Liqian didn’t realize at this time that there was actually a Peach Blossom Farm in the Changping County under her rule. Its future political achievements were already extremely brilliant.

Moreover, this Taoyuan farm was personally introduced by her, so others couldn’t snatch it away even if they wanted to.

About ten minutes before 9:38, another car drove into the small square.

After Xia ruofei received Lei Hu’s reminder, he could not help but smile bitterly.”What was going on today? It was just a small ceremony, so why were there so many uninvited guests? Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

I wonder who will return this time?

Xia ruofei stood up from his seat and walked towards the car.

It was a flashy Porsche Cayenne. Just as Xia ruofei was trying to guess which tycoon it was, he saw a thin figure jump out.

Isn’t that song Rui? Why did he come to join in the fun?

Song Rui was carrying a long paper box under his arm. He walked towards Xia ruofei with his signature wicked smile.

Xia ruofei simply stood still and waited for him to greet his brothers. He was too lazy to welcome them. The ceremony was about to start, and Xia ruofei had to go on stage to give a speech soon!

“Young master Song, what’s the situation?” Xia ruofei waited for song Rui to come before he asked,”why did you come here today?”

Song Rui grinned as he looked at Ling Qingxue, who was holding Xia ruofei’s arm tightly. He asked,””RUO Fei, this must be my sister – in – Law!”

Ling Qingxue’s face blushed slightly, but she was very happy in her heart.

Xia ruofei nodded his head casually and introduced her to Ling Qingxue,””Qingxue, this is my good brother, song Rui.”

“My girlfriend, Ling Qingxue,” he said to song Rui.

Song Rui immediately bowed slightly to Ling Qingxue and said,””Good day, sister – in – Law!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but criticize,”this kid is obviously a few years older than me, but he’s so thick – skinned and calls me sister – in – Law. He’s really good at acting young!”

“Nice to meet you, song Rui,” Ling Qingxue blushed and said.

“Sister – in – Law, ruofei and I are Good Brothers. You can just call me Xiao Rui!” Song Rui said enthusiastically.

Ling Qingxue had a good impression of song Rui, who kept calling her sister – in – Law and was rather friendly. She immediately smiled and said,””Alright, I’ll call you Xiao Rui then.”

When Wu Liqian saw that Xia ruofei, Ling Qingxue, and song Rui were chatting happily, she couldn’t help but look thoughtful. She had been working for Tian Huilan for many years. She had accompanied Tian Huilan to xiangnan province for an inspection and had seen song Zhengping, Wang sumei, and song Rui’s family.

Song Zhengping was a Governor and a relative of elder song, a legendary general and one of the core leaders of Huaxia. Wu Liqian naturally had a deep impression of this family, so she recognized song Rui as soon as he arrived.

Wu Liqian was talking to the people beside her, but her attention had already shifted to Xia ruofei.

Just then, Xia ruofei asked,”young master Song, why are you here?” Don’t tell me you’re here to freeload a meal?”

At this time, song Rui’s words made Wu Liqian couldn’t help but reveal a horrified expression. Song Rui smiled and said,””Don’t belittle me! Am I such a person with no class? I’m here with a mission today! My old man heard that you moved to a new office building and sent me here to congratulate you!”
