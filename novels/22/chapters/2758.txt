2759 In full swing (1)

Taoyuan farm was located within the borders of the Changping District of Sanshan city. It was not far from the airport, and Lei Hu’s Mercedes – Benz soon arrived at the farm’s entrance.

This car was under the name of the Paradise Corporation, and it often entered and exited the farm, so the guard directly raised the bar to let the car in.

However, from the corner of his eye, Xia ruofei caught a familiar figure. He was standing at the window of the guardhouse and registering. There was a large army green backpack by his feet.

“Hu, stop the car!” Xia ruofei called out.

Lei Hu did not know what was going on, but he still stepped on the brakes subconsciously. The car was not fast to begin with, so it stopped very quickly.

“Brother Xia, what’s the matter?” Lei Hu turned around and asked.

“Wait for me,” Xia ruofei said.

After that, he opened the door and stepped out of the car, walking towards the guardhouse.

At this moment, the familiar figure of Xia ruofei had just completed his registration. He gave a friendly smile to the people in the Guardsman’s room and bent down to pick up his backpack.

When he straightened his back, he saw a person standing in front of him. He was stunned for a moment, and then revealed an inexplicable look of surprise and called out,””Class monitor!” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Xia ruofei also smiled in surprise and said,””Hahaha! Deng Yujun! It really is you! I told you that your back looks a little familiar!”

Deng Yujun was Xia ruofei’s comrade in the same class when he was serving in the Army. Xia ruofei’s military service was two years older than him, and he had entered lone wolf two years earlier than him. Xia ruofei was already a class monitor when he retired from the Army. He took care of Deng Yujun when he was in the Army and the two of them had a good relationship.

Deng Yujun was very talented in sniping, but his physical fitness was relatively weak, especially in a unit like the lone wolf assault team. His physical shortcomings were even more obvious. He was also selected to enter the lone wolf because of his talent in sniping.

When he first joined the team, the harsh physical training made Deng Yujun complain endlessly, and he even wanted to retreat. At that time, Xia ruofei, who was still the Vice class monitor, took the initiative to talk to him and encourage him. At the same time, he used his spare time to give him special treatment based on his own experience in physical training. He focused on training his heart and lungs and core strength. In this way, Deng Yujun slowly adapted to the intensity of lone Wolf’s training.

Therefore, Deng Yujun had always been grateful to Xia ruofei.

“Class monitor!” Deng Yujun said excitedly. It was company commander MA who contacted me and said that your company needed to recruit a group of veterans to form the guard team, mainly to carry out missions overseas. I resigned without a second word!”

“That’s great!” Xia ruofei punched Deng Yujun’s chest and laughed.”We can get together again in the future!”

Then, Xia ruofei looked confused and said,””But ... Why did you retire? Didn’t you just get promoted to assistant class monitor when I left the Army?”

The lone wolf assault team’s mobility was relatively lower than that of ordinary troops because it took a longer period to train an excellent Special Forces soldier. Therefore, the lone wolf assault team was mainly made up of officers and sergeants. The number of middle and high – Level sergeants was also far higher than that of ordinary combat troops.

Looking at the time, Deng Yujun should have retired after becoming a Sergeant. Under normal circumstances, an excellent sniper had a long career. There would be no problem in choosing to be changed to a Sergeant. Even if he continued to be a Sergeant Major, the hope was still very high. Xia ruofei knew that some of the old squad leaders of the lone wolf assault team had already become class three Sergeant Major. There was even a class two Sergeant Major. Later, because he was too old, he was transferred to the training Brigade to be a shooting instructor. A class two Sergeant Major could already serve for longer periods of time and work until he retired.

It wasn’t easy for the military to train an excellent sniper. The number of bullets used was uncountable. No matter how good a sharpshooter was, he still needed to be fed with bullets. Only after countless live ammunition shots and countless repetitions could the technical movements be formed into muscle memory.

Deng Yujun revealed a bitter smile and said,”I retired at the end of last year. Class monitor, it’s a long story. I’ll tell you about it when I have the chance!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”sure!” Don’t think too much. Since you’ve already left the Army, you should just stay there and do well! Now that you’re here with me, I won’t mistreat you!”

“That’s for sure!”Deng Yujun grinned. I’m a soldier that you brought out!”

Xia ruofei patted Deng Yujun’s shoulder and said with a smile,”Go! Get in the car with me! I’ve just come back from another place. Let’s go and see what kind of brothers the wolf King has recruited for me!”

“Yes!” Deng Yujun said.

At this moment, Lei Hu had also gotten out of the car. He said very cleverly,”Class monitor, give me your backpack!”

“Thank you! “I’ll take it myself ...”Deng Yujun said with a friendly smile.

Lei Hu grabbed Deng Yujun’s backpack without a word and quickly walked to the car, putting the backpack in the trunk.

Deng Yujun and Xia ruofei sat in the back of the Mercedes – Benz. Lei Hu started the car and drove towards the staff dormitory.

When the car arrived at the office building, Xia ruofei saw that Ma Jia was actually organizing the Veterans for formation training.

More than 30 people were divided into four horizontal rows and were training in unison in the square in front of the complex. Each horizontal row was commanded by a squad leader, while Ma Jia stood on the side and kept an eye on everyone’s training.
