Chapter 220: Official Healing_1

Song Zhengping turned his head and glanced at song Rui. Then, he asked indifferently,””Who do you want to kill?” Song Rui, who was just rubbing his hands in anger, immediately cowered. He smiled embarrassedly and said,””No, no, no, I’m just joking ... You guys can talk, you guys can talk ...” It was obvious that song Zhengping was a strict father. When song Rui saw him, he was like a mouse seeing a cat. He didn’t have the aura of a rich third generation heir at all. Song Zhengping glared at song Rui, then turned to manager Lu and said,””Old Lu, I have to thank you this time! If it wasn’t for your persistence and decisiveness, I’m afraid I wouldn’t even be able to see my father one last time, not to mention that his condition might have taken a turn for the better. ” Song Zhengping was touched when he heard the entire process. Manager Lu and Tian Huilan had both taken a huge political risk to do this, especially when the person in charge of the medical group was a descendant of a family. It was a near – Death situation for the two of them, but they still did it without hesitation. He knew very well that when manager Lu made the decision, he had completely put his personal political life out of his mind. The only thing on his mind was elder song’s condition. The song family had to remember this favor. “Chief Judge song, it’s my job to do my best to provide the chief with all the services. You don’t have to be so polite.” Manager Lu was a little flattered. Song Zhengping smiled kindly. Manager Lu had been by his father’s side for more than ten years, so they were already half family. After this incident, manager Lu’s position in song Zhengping’s heart had clearly become even closer. Then, song Zhengping said to Tian Huilan and Xia ruofei,””Huilan, doctor Xia, it’s all thanks to you guys this time! Otherwise, I’m afraid I won’t even be able to see my father one last time. That will be my lifelong regret! No matter what the result of the treatment is, I have to thank you!” “Big brother song, you’re being too polite.” Tian Huilan smiled and said,”isn’t it my duty to do something for elder song’s health?” “Chief Judge song, I’ll do my best,” Xia ruofei said. The medicine used before was to ensure that the Bureau chief’s vital signs are stable. I’ve already listed a few prescriptions, and staff officer Xu is rushing to Hongzhou to buy Chinese medicine. When he comes back, I can start the official treatment. I believe it will be effective!” “Go to Hongzhou?” Song Zhengping looked at manager Lu in confusion. “Chief Judge song, I didn’t have time to report to you just now,” director Lu said awkwardly.”This ... Director Liang is in charge of the medical work. All the equipment and medicine were transported from Beijing with the medical team by air, so there is no reserve of Chinese medicinal herbs and related equipment ... But I have asked Xu Wu to coordinate with the land aviation side. He will take a helicopter to Hongzhou to buy medicine, and he should be back soon!” Song Zhengping’s expression turned even uglier.”This Xiao Liang, he’s really a failure! Later, I’ll ask the comrades in the central Health Bureau how they choose the medical team! This Liang is obviously not up to the task!” In fact, song Zhengping had said this out of anger. To be honest, Liang Haitao’s professional quality in Western medicine was definitely not a problem. He was completely qualified to be the leader of the medical team. To be honest, even if it was anyone else, they wouldn’t be able to save elder song. Liang Haitao’s mistake was that he was too headstrong, especially when he stopped Xia ruofei from making the last effort. This had already crossed the line with song Zhengping. From the family’s point of view, he was not taking the patient’s life seriously! He was not capable of treating the patient and had already given up. Yet, he refused to let others try and had to watch the patient die. How could he be qualified for such an important position as the leader of the medical team with such character? “Chief Judge song, what about director Liang ...” Director Lu gave song Zhengping a questioning look as he spoke. Song Zhengping waved his hand and said,”don’t worry about them. Just lock them up!” I’ll settle this with him later!” “Alright,” he said. Manager Lu nodded with a smile in his eyes. Manager Lu was relieved. Song Zhengping’s attitude was clear. Even if the effect of Xia ruofei’s treatment was average, at least he had taken control of the medical group and supported Xia ruofei. It was a very correct and decisive decision. He had not made any mistakes! After song Zhengping understood the situation, he expressed his gratitude to Xia ruofei. He had been traveling non – stop and was already exhausted, so manager Lu quickly arranged a room for the father and son to rest. Manager Lu had also arranged accommodations for Tian Huilan and her Secretary, Xiao, and told them to rest separately. Xia ruofei took the doctor’s resting room. There was a quiet inner room, an office and a guest area outside. It was the closest to elder song’s room. If anything happened, he would be able to deal with it immediately. They waited for about an hour before they finally heard the faint sound of a helicopter in the distance. However, it was impossible for the helicopter to land directly next to the small courtyard, so it would take more than ten minutes for Xu Wu to arrive. During this period, elder song’s vital signs had been quite stable. His various indicators had risen a little compared to the second time he had taken the petal solution. Manager Lu went in to check a few times and finally felt more at ease. Before Xu Wu could rush back, Xia ruofei came to elder song’s room again. He took his pulse and checked his health. Xia ruofei had to save the life of this legendary chief, but he did not want to expose his secret. Naturally, it would be more troublesome. Manager Lu looked at Xia ruofei nervously. After Xia ruofei finished the examination, he stood up and said,””I know what to do, manager Lu. Please ask someone to bring all the herbs and boiling equipment that Xu Wu bought to my room. I’m going to brew the first dose of Chinese medicine for the chief right away. This dose is very important and will affect the subsequent treatment. No one is allowed to disturb me during this period!” “Alright, alright!” Manager Lu said,”don’t worry, I’ll personally guard the door!” Soon, Xu Wu returned, covered in dust. A few soldiers carried a large box and quickly followed him. The box was carried to Xia ruofei’s room. There was a set of claypot, stove, and even a lot of charcoal. All the Chinese medicinal herbs were packed separately, and each packet had the name of the medicinal herb on it. Xia ruofei nodded in satisfaction. Seeing this, manager Lu immediately started to clear the area and asked everyone to leave immediately. He closed the door from the outside and then personally stood guard outside. Xia ruofei started to get busy. Thinking about how he was going to save the life of the idol of countless soldiers and a legendary general, he couldn’t help but feel excited. At this moment, he had completely thrown all the utilitarian thoughts he had before his departure to the back of his mind ... The first chapter was ... My brothers and sisters can join the group!
