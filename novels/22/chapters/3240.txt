Xia ruofei smiled and said,”this is a prescription. It’s all common Chinese medicine. You can send someone to Chinatown and find a Chinese medicine shop. It’ll be easy to get it.” In addition, I’ve also written the method of decocting the medicine on it. Nowadays, Chinese medicine shops all have decocting services on behalf of you, so you can just ask them to decoct the medicine for you. According to this prescription, take it three times a day after meals for seven days. Basically, the problem of tinnitus can be cured. ”

The formula for treating tinnitus was not considered precious to Xia ruofei, so he did not deliberately keep it a secret.

Of course, if the people in the Chinese medicine shop knew what was good, it would be quite valuable to record this prescription.

Elon Musk held the piece of paper in his hand as if he had found a treasure. He then called the Butler over and asked him to go to Chinatown to get the medicine as Xia ruofei had just said.

He didn’t even ask the housekeeper to take the prescription. Instead, he asked the housekeeper to take a picture of it with his phone while he carefully put the prescription away.

The Butler naturally didn’t dare to delay. After taking a picture of the prescription, he rushed to the nearby Chinatown to get the medicine.

Elonmask’s face was filled with gratitude as he said,””Doctor Xia, I’m really grateful to you this time! Please take care of little X’s subsequent treatment, doctor Xia!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you’re welcome.” There’s a saying in China’s Chinese medical field that doctors have the heart of a parent. We treat every patient like our own children and will do our best. ”

“Thank you! Thank you!” Elon Mask rubbed his hands and said,”I really don’t know how to thank you! I originally wanted to help you promote your medical skills, but you are not willing to publicize it ... How about this! Dr. Xia, no matter how effective little X’s treatment is, I will pay you a treatment fee that you will be absolutely satisfied with ...”

“No need,” Xia ruofei waved his hand. Li Yifu had already paid for the medical fees. I think ... Mr. Masker, you should be very clear about Mr. Li’s intention in doing this. ”

Elon Musk was stunned for a moment. He subconsciously looked at Li Yifu and then at Xia ruofei. He was not sure if Xia ruofei knew about the “big business” that Li Yifu had discussed with him.

Seeing this, Li Yifu smiled and said,””Mr. Masker, Dr. Xia is one of us. He knows more than you think. Let’s just be Frank. ”

When Elon Musk heard this, the hesitation on his face did not completely fade away. It was obvious that he still had some concerns.

Li Yifu chuckled and said,”Mr. Masker, Dr. Xia doesn’t have any official background in China. You can rest assured about this.” Also, our deal this time has nothing to do with the Chinese government!”

Elon Musk nodded and then whispered to grams,””My dear, go and check on little X next door!”

Grams knew that Elon Musk had something to discuss, and it was not convenient for her to be present, so she nodded and bowed slightly to Xia ruofei and Li Yifu before leaving the room.

Elon Musk asked all the unrelated people to leave the room, leaving only him, Xia ruofei, and Li Yifu.

Then, elonmask smiled bitterly and said,””Mr. Li, you’ve really given me a big problem! Aerospace technology is very sensitive, you should be very clear about that. ”

“Of course!” Li Yifu replied with a smile. However, the sensitivity of rocket technology is relatively high, while space survival equipment, including spaceships, is not so sensitive, right?” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Rocket technology involved military applications. Some long – range intercontinental missiles and launch vehicles were the same in principle.

In addition, the heavy Launch Vehicle Technology, especially the rocket engine technology, was only in the hands of a few countries. Such technology was definitely strictly blocked.

“It’s only relative,”said elonmask. NASA was very strict with their own things. Even small technology like space food had strict confidentiality procedures. SpaceX obtained some technology from NASA, but we have all signed confidentiality agreements. Once violated, my company will face very serious accusations, and I may even face prison ...”

Li Yifu opened his mouth, but was stopped by Xia ruofei’s eyes.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Mr. Masker, I’m sure you’re very clear. The equipment and equipment that Mr. Li wants to buy will not pose any threat to your national security.” And we can also guarantee that these things will not be transported out of the United States. With the strength of the United States intelligence Department, it’s impossible for us to transport such a large amount of things out of the country without anyone knowing, right?”

Xia ruofei looked at Elon Musk and continued,””Also, I think with Mr. Musk’s strength, he should be able to easily erase all traces. Even if we are seized by the FBA or CIB, your company won’t be implicated.”

Elonmask sighed and said,””Everything is hard to predict. SpaceX is at a critical stage. Once it succeeds, our market value may double several times. We can’t afford any mistakes! However, since things have come to this ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and interrupted masker,””Mr. Masker, let’s not talk about this for now. Let’s treat the child first! Nothing is more important than the child’s health now, right?”

Elon Musk was touched. He knew very well that although he would not go back on his word in the end, Li Yifu’s strength could not be underestimated. However, there was no doubt that this was the best time for Xia ruofei and the others to bargain.

Xia ruofei had already proven his medical skills and little X’s life was in danger. He was just waiting for Xia ruofei to save him.

However, Xia ruofei did not use this as a bargaining chip to negotiate the purchase of spacesuits and other equipment. Instead, he proposed to treat the child first, which made Elon Musk feel a trace of warmth.

Elon Musk subconsciously looked at Li Yifu. He had always thought that Li Yifu was the one who made the decision. Compared to Xia ruofei, who was too young and a doctor, he felt that Xia ruofei would not be too involved.

However, when elonmask saw that Li Yifu had already retreated to the side, he did not look displeased at all because of Xia ruofei’s “arbitrary decision”. On the contrary, Li Yifu’s expression was normal, as if it was only natural for Xia ruofei to make the decision.

Elon Musk’s observation skills were still very strong. He immediately realized that he should reevaluate this young doctor Xia.

“Mr. Masker!” Xia ruofei’s voice was heard again.”What do you think of my suggestion?”

“Ah?” Elon Musk came back to his senses and quickly said,”thank you for your generosity, Mr. Xia! Please rest assured, I will also come up with a safe and beneficial solution for Mr. Li’s matter as soon as possible. I will do my best to meet Mr. Li’s needs!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””Let’s go! Let’s go and see the patient!”

A heart for a heart. If you gave the other party enough kindness, the other party would naturally be able to feel it and also release kindness.

Sometimes, things in the world were like this. A little more warmth was not necessarily less effective than tough means.

Xia ruofei, Li Yifu, and Elon Musk went to the next room. Gramus was sitting next to the crib, staring blankly at little X, who was still sleeping.

“My dear!” Grams said softly,”little X seems to be sleeping very well today. He was often woken up by pain in his sleep a few days ago, and his little eyebrows were always furrowed. Today, they are relaxed, and there is a smile on his lips!”

When Elon Musk saw his son, his eyes softened. He leaned over and said happily,””It’s true!”

“Maybe he knows that he’ll be free from the pain soon, so he’s been smiling even in his sleep!” Xia ruofei laughed.
