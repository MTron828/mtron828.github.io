Each invitation only had three spots, and almost all of the people who came here were the leaders of their respective sects or forces. The most inferior ones were the more important disciples of their sects, so those relatively narrow single rooms and the standard rooms with worse conditions were naturally not used to receive guests.

The rooms that the fallen leaves sect had arranged for Xia ruofei and the others were on the 16th floor. Two of the rooms were at the end of the corridor, directly opposite each other. The last room was at the other end of the corridor.

It wasn’t that the organizers didn’t want to arrange them to stay together, but that was the design of the hotel. There were four rooms on both ends of each floor, and in the middle were single or standard rooms of different sizes.

The fallen leaves sect had naturally prepared the best room for Luo Qingfeng. The layout of the three rooms was almost the same, but the direction was slightly different. However, the lighting in Luo Qingfeng’s room was better, and it did not face the street, so it was relatively quiet.

The second room was the room opposite Qingfeng Luo’s because it was facing the street. However, it wasn’t that far off. After all, the 16th floor was already very quiet.

The room at the other end of the corridor was the worst. In addition to facing the street, it also faced the problem of the sun.

Hao Qingsong led the three of them to the floor where the rooms were located and personally distributed the room cards to the three of them. He then accompanied Luo Qingfeng to the door of the room and politely said,””Daoist Luo, it’s getting late. You’re all travel – worn, why don’t you rest earlier? How about we talk again tomorrow?”

Luo Qingfeng smiled and said,” Fellow Daoist Hao, you can go ahead with your work! You’re hosting an auction this year, and you’re one of the main pillars of your sect, so there’s bound to be a lot of things you need to do,”

“I hope fellow Daoists can forgive my poor hospitality!” Hao Qingsong smiled and said,”if there’s anything you need, you can call the front desk. Or, you can directly look for martial nephew Hong. That’s no problem!”

Hong Chunlei quickly handed his business card to the three of them and said,””Seniors, this disciple will be staying in this hotel and will be at your service at any time!”

Luo Qingfeng accepted Hong Chunlei’s business card with a smile and said,””It’s been hard on you, martial nephew Hong. ”

After Hao Qingsong bade Hong Chunlei farewell and went downstairs, Luo Qingfeng quickly invited Xia ruofei and Li Yifu into his room.

As soon as they entered the house, Xia ruofei and Luo Qingfeng used their spiritual energy to check.

There was nothing strange about the room. Whether it was the eavesdropping or recording equipment made by modern technology, or some small arrays used in the cultivation world for eavesdropping, none of them were discovered.

Of course, this was also the habit of the two out of caution. If the fallen leaves sect really dared to do anything in everyone’s room, they would have to be stupid.

It must be known that there were many golden core cultivators this time. It was almost impossible to hide from these Masters and secretly set up eavesdropping means in the room.

Moreover, the risk of doing so was too great. Once it was found out, the fallen leaves sect would become the target of the entire cultivation world.

Not finding anything out of the ordinary, the two of them also secretly heaved a sigh of relief.

However, Xia ruofei was still cautious and casually threw out a few talismans. In an instant, he had set up a sound – proof barrier. After all, the people staying in this hotel were all cultivators. Their hearing was quite heaven – defying, and they had to be careful of hearing at all times.

Seeing that Xia ruofei could set up a sound – proof barrier so easily, Luo Qingfeng could not help but feel speechless.

Xia ruofei would always reveal all kinds of tricks inadvertently. Every time Luo Qingfeng felt that he had a certain understanding of his master, he would immediately find that his master seemed to be even more mysterious.

As for Li Yifu, due to his lack of cultivation, especially in the field of array formation, he had only scratched the surface. Hence, he did not even know what the barrier Xia ruofei had set up was for.

After the sound – proof barrier was formed, Luo Qingfeng quickly said,””Master, let’s leave this room for you! This old servant will stay in the room at the end of the corridor. ”

In the eyes of outsiders, Luo Qingfeng was definitely the leader of Xia ruofei’s group of three, followed by Li Yifu. After all, although his cultivation was not very high, he was Luo Qingfeng’s senior brother. As for Xia ruofei, because he was too young, he could only be ranked third.

Thus, the people of the falling leaves sect arranged the rooms according to this. Luo Qingfeng stayed in the best room, Li Yifu stayed opposite him, and Xia ruofei was arranged to stay in a room facing the street at the end of the corridor.

Little did they know that the actual situation was the exact opposite of their judgment.

Xia ruofei was undoubtedly the core of the three, and as Xia ruofei’s martial nephew, Li Yifu’s status was even higher than Luo Qingfeng ‘s. Strictly speaking, Luo Qingfeng could only sit at the last seat.

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”there’s no need to go through so much trouble!” It’s just one or two nights, so it doesn’t matter where you stay. We’re all cultivators, how can we be so pampered?”

From Qingfeng Luo’s point of view, this was not a matter of being pampered. As a cultivator, even if he had to sleep in the wild, it would not be a problem. Moreover, the conditions of the three rooms were not very different. At least, the price of the rooms was the same.

However, this was a matter of status and treatment. Qingfeng Luo felt that it was simply overstepping his boundaries to stay in the best room while the master stayed in that room!

However, Xia ruofei’s words were like an imperial edict to him and he did not dare to refute them.

On the other hand, Li Yifu thought for a moment and said,”senior granduncle, why don’t we just exchange rooms?” Qingfeng is the sect leader, if he changes rooms, it will definitely arouse the curiosity of others. If I change rooms with you, it won’t be so conspicuous. ”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.”Don’t worry about the room. I’ll stay over there. It’s quiet!” All of you, stop talking!”

Qingfeng Luo and Yifu li looked at each other and then nodded helplessly.

Xia ruofei sat down on the sofa and said,””Qingfeng, I didn’t get to know the details of the auction before. You’ve been to this auction before, so tell me the general rules and regulations!”

“Yes!” Qingfeng Luo quickly nodded and said. Master!”

Then, he looked left and right, then quickly walked to the desk. He picked up an exquisite little booklet and handed it to Xia ruofei.”Master, this should be the specific arrangement of the auction. According to past practices, the organizer will prepare a manual in advance.”

Xia ruofei took it and casually flipped through it. He realized that the manual was beautifully printed. It was thick and the content was rich.

However, most of the pictures at the front were photos of the auction items, and about a quarter of the pictures at the end were the details of the auction.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”there should be this manual in every room!” I’ll take a closer look when I get back to my room! Tell me about the past practices first. ”

“Yes! Master!” Luo Qingfeng said respectfully,”first of all, these items were gathered by the fallen leaves sect after seeking the opinions of the various sects. They are all treasures that everyone is interested in auctioning. The fallen leaves sect also asked for our opinion, but this time we don’t have anything to offer for auction, so there are no items for auction. ”

“Can I add it temporarily?” Xia ruofei asked.

This was what he was more concerned about, because if he didn’t auction anything, he wouldn’t have the capital to bid for the item he wanted!

The auction used spiritual stones for transactions. Although Xia ruofei had more precious spiritual crystals or even origin crystals, they were strictly considered treasures and could not be used as currency.

Of course, if Xia ruofei was willing to take it out, many people would be willing to exchange for it with spiritual stones.

However, spiritual crystals and elemental crystals were non – renewable resources. Xia ruofei was not willing to use them unless he had no other choice.

Therefore, the best way was naturally to auction some other things and Exchange them for spiritual stones. After that, he could buy and buy according to his preferences.UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m
