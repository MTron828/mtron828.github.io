“Are you still nervous?” Xia ruofei looked at benilatti and asked.

Benilatti’s face turned red and said,””Mr. Xia, I’m actually not nervous ... I’m just a little breathless from running over ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you should sort out your thoughts now. Remember what I told you just now.” If Wang Boshan doesn’t call back, call him back in five minutes. You don’t need me to teach you how to say it, do you?”

“Just say that I didn’t have my phone with me just now.” Beniladi said without thinking.

Xia ruofei nodded and agreed.

Thus, bainilatti mumbled to himself and recalled all the possible problems that Xia ruofei had told him to deal with wangboshan.

In less than five minutes, bainilatti’s phone rang again, and it was still Wang Boshan. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“It looks like he’s in a hurry!” Xia ruofei smiled and said to benilatti,”don’t pick it up so quickly. Let the phone ring for a while ...”

Benilatti had already stretched out his hand, but after hearing Xia ruofei’s words, he pulled it back.

Xia ruofei waited for about ten seconds before nodding at bainilatti.

Benilatti quickly picked up the phone, swiped the answer button, and turned on the speaker.

Li Yifu, who was at the side, immediately revealed a nervous expression.

He already knew that Wang Boshan was from the star Seizer sect. The news of Paradise Island changing hands was also leaked to the star Seizer sect by bainilatti. Although Xia ruofei had already said that bainilatti was absolutely reliable, Li Yifu still did not dare to let his guard down. He focused all his attention on bainilatti. If bainilatti tried to inform Wang Boshan, he would immediately take action and cut off their communication.

A smile appeared on beniladi’s face as he said,””Mr. Wang! Hello ... I’m really sorry, I didn’t bring my phone with me just now and missed such an important call from you. I was just about to call you back!”

The phone was on speaker so Xia ruofei and Li Yifu could hear Wang Boshan’s voice clearly.

“Benilatti, I would like to ask you about some matters regarding the green cloud Island,” Wang Boshan said.

A smile appeared on benilatti’s face as he said,””Of course, no problem! You’re my old customer! The price is absolutely fair!”

Wang Boshan snorted and said,””Since you’re a regular customer, you’re asking me for money before I even ask? As long as the information you provide is valuable, when have I ever been stingy?”

“That’s right! That’s right!” Benilatti nodded and bowed.”Mr. Wang is the most generous!”

At this moment, Xia ruofei heard another voice from the other end of the phone.””Boshan, don’t waste your breath on him. Ask him quickly!”

Then, Wang Boshan’s voice was heard,””Yes! Junior uncle Zheng!”

These two sentences were said in Chinese, and the voice was very soft, especially the last sentence that Wang Boshan said. He was probably covering his phone.

However, Xia ruofei and Li Yifu were both cultivators, so their hearing was much better than ordinary people. Hence, they could hear the two sentences clearly.

Xia ruofei and Li Yifu looked at each other. This had revealed a very important piece of information. There was someone with a higher position than Wang Boshan. This person’s surname was Zheng and he was Wang Boshan’s uncle master.

Xia ruofei analyzed and felt that this person should be the one who came to find him with Wang Boshan at the liuhai Lane courtyard house in the capital that day. This martial uncle Zheng was most likely Zheng Yongshou.

However, since benilatti was currently dealing with Wang Boshan, Xia ruofei and Li Yifu only paid a little attention to this detail and immediately focused their attention on benilatti.

After that martial uncle Zheng finished speaking, Wang Boshan immediately said,””Benilatti, I want to ask you a few questions. If your answers are really useful to us, we will definitely not shortchange you!”

“Alright! Mr. Wang, feel free to ask!” Benilatti quickly said in a greedy tone,”as long as I know, I will definitely not hide anything from you!”

“Okay, the first question, has the new master of the blue cloud Island appeared on the island?” Wang Boshan asked.

“Mr. Wang, I must correct you. This Island is now called Paradise Island.” Benilati smiled and said,”I’ll give you this information for free!”

Wang Boshan said impatiently,””I know this! Isn’t this just a habit? Hurry up and get to business!”

“Alright!” Bainilatti pouted and said. It seems that Mr. Wang’s sense of humor needs to be improved ... I can tell you very clearly that the new owner of Peach Blossom Island, Mr. Xia ruofei, has not appeared on the island for the past few days. As for where he went, we have no idea. ”

“He didn’t appear on the island?” Wang Boshan muttered to himself,”then where could he have run to?”

Benilati looked at Xia ruofei, asking for his opinion.

Xia ruofei knew what bainilatti meant. He pondered for a while and nodded.

Therefore, benilatti took the initiative to say,””Mr. Wang, although Mr. Xia ruofei did not come to Paradise Island, the situation on the island has changed. I believe you will be interested in this news!”

As expected, Wang Boshan immediately asked,””What change?”

After hearing this, benilatti did not speak immediately. Instead, he smiled and remained silent.

Wang Boshan waited for a few seconds before he reacted. He said in a slightly unhappy tone,””I’ll give you $50000 for this piece of information. If we think it’s worth more, we’ll give you an additional bonus!”

“This is the market price for our previous transactions,” said beniladi slowly.”But ... The situation is different now. The information on peach source Island is more valuable now ...”

When Wang Boshan heard this, he secretly cursed ‘greedy B * stard’. However, he was not in the mood to bargain with benilatti and said without thinking,””Eighty thousand dollars! Beniladi, this price is already very high, I hope you won’t push your luck!”

“OK! Deal!” Benilati couldn’t help but whistle, clearly in a good mood.

“Alright, enough of your nonsense!” Wang Boshan said,”hurry up and tell me what the news is! If I don’t think it’s worth the price, I’ll still transfer the money to you, but this will be the last time!”

Benilatti said with confidence,””Mr. Wang, don’t worry! I promise that after today, you will continue to take the initiative to come to me for information transactions!”

After saying this, benilatti didn’t delay any further and said,””Although Mr. Xia didn’t come to Paradise Island, his subordinates did, and they should be here with his latest instructions!”

“His subordinates?” Wang Boshan could not help but frown and asked,”who is it? What is he going to Qing ... Peach Blossom Island for?”

“I don’t know his name, but I do know that his surname is Xu.” Benilatti said,”those Chinese people call him Commissioner Xu and say that he’s a human resources Commissioner sent by the Paradise company.”

Beniladi paused and continued to say what Xia ruofei had told him,””After Commissioner Xu came, he only did one thing, which was the interview! He had interviewed everyone on the island, and only about 50 people were left. The rest had been sent back to their countries. Those people who stayed behind are always mysterious. I don’t know what they are doing at all. It seems that the atmosphere on the island is getting weirder and weirder ...”

“You’re being marginalized!” Wang Boshan snorted and said.

“It’s just that the work we’re in charge of is different!” “If I’ve been marginalized, how can I get so much important information?”

“Alright! That’s good news, 80000 US dollars will be transferred to your account soon!” Wang Boshan said,”but you have to tell me, what’s wrong with the atmosphere? Any specific performance?”

Benilatti deliberately thought about it and said,””There are too many strange things. For example, they have surrounded the entire area next to the airport. I don’t know what they are hiding in there for ...”

Benilatti then pointed out a few more unusual points, which were all made up by Xia ruofei in advance, so all benilatti had to do was to follow the instructions.

Xia ruofei’s judgment was not wrong. Wang Boshan fell silent after hearing this. Then, he told benilati to contact him immediately if he found out such important information. Wang Boshan then hung up the phone.

...

Benilatti hung up the phone, let out a long sigh, and asked,””Mr. Xia, how was my performance just now?”
