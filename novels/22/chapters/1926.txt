Chapter 1927 Unusually smooth (2)

Rather than this, it would be better to just barge in! Even if she was interrogated by the security guards after the incident, she was not afraid that her identity as a reporter from the satellite channel would still be very useful.

Thus, the interview vehicle drove into the community area under the security guard’s command.

The security guard actually didn’t know what had happened. He thought that it was his colleague in the guardhouse who had pressed the lift button. When he came back to his senses, the two interview vehicles had already driven far away. He quickly called for people to chase after them.

“The third building is over there!” Liu Yuan pointed to the side and said,”let’s hurry up. Otherwise, the security guards might come up. Camera teacher, please prepare the necessary equipment first. We’ll head straight to the entrance of the unit after parking the car!”

“Alright!”

Soon, the interview vehicle arrived at the entrance of Building 3.

Liu Yuan, the cameraman, and the others quickly got out of the car, carried their filming equipment, and quickly walked to the main entrance of Building 3.

In fact, she and her colleague still had to face two “checkpoints”, but the “considerate” Xu Yougang had already helped her remember that what Gong Jie had taken from the security Captain wasn’t just the remote control, but also an elevator card.

Unlike the owner’s elevator card, which could only go to a specific floor, the elevator card used by the property management could be used to go to any floor.

And Zeng Liang had just passed the elevator card to Wang Chong.

At this moment, Wang Chong was at the entrance of Building 3. He had already used the password to open the door.

Just like that, Liu Yuan and the others walked directly into Building No. 3.

Under normal circumstances, it was impossible to catch up with a four – wheeled car on foot. Hence, the security guards were still quite a distance away from Building 3.

After Liu Yuan and the others entered, Wang Chong immediately stuffed the elevator card into the hands of the cameraman. After which, he whispered a few words into the cameraman’s ear before heading into the stairwell.

“Brother Xu, who is this? What did he give you?” Liu Yuan was a little baffled.

The cameraman, brother Xu, waved the card in his hand and said,””I don’t know him. He said this is the elevator card, and you can go up to the 19th floor with it!”

Liu Yuan raised her eyebrows and felt that there was something strange about today’s incident. First, when they entered the door, the bar rose by itself without waiting for them to waste their breath. Then, someone helped to open the unit door and even stuffed the elevator card in.

Liu Yuan felt as if someone was secretly helping them clear the obstacles, but wasn’t this service a little too thorough?

Through the glass of the unit door, she saw the security guards getting closer and closer. She didn’t have time to think and quickly said,””Go! Let’s enter the elevator!”

No matter what, it was definitely not wrong to complete the interview task first. At least up until now, the other party had been helping him and did not have any malicious intentions.

Just like that, Liu Yuan’s interview team successfully took the elevator to the 19th floor. After completing their mission, Wang Chong also rushed up the stairs to the 19th floor. When the security guards caught up to them, they could only see the elevator moving up.

The smart Liu Ying pressed a few more floors, which caused the security guards to see the elevator stop, go up, stop, and go up again on the first floor. They had no way to judge which floor the reporters went to. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Before they could get more information, they could only go to these floors to check one by one, which also gave Liu Yuan’s interview team more time.

……

In the chaotic Room 1902, Liu Yuan’s interview went very smoothly.

Before she came, she had already mentally prepared herself. Usually, both parties involved in this kind of thing would definitely not be willing to cooperate with the interview, so usually, they could only shoot some live videos and interview some neighbors and other people as a supplement.

In fact, as long as one could arrive at the scene in time and record videos of the two sides tearing at each other, it would be very eye – catching.

Liu Yuan didn’t expect the person involved to be so cooperative. He didn’t even need her to guide him, and Liu Da just said a lot.

In fact, Da Liu was just being impulsive. When he saw the media reporters, he wanted to use the sharp weapon of the media to completely ruin Fang Chenchen and the man who claimed to be the Deputy Secretary.

When he was almost done, he suddenly came to his senses. His expression changed slightly and he quickly said,””Okay, okay, don’t ask so many questions ... There’s nothing to shoot ...”

Liu Dong wanted to cry but had no tears. Wasn’t it too late to think about the consequences now?

Xu Yougang saw everything that happened in Room 1902 through the surveillance footage. He did not expect things to go so smoothly.

In fact, when Xia ruofei made the plan, he had considered all kinds of backup plans, including the media’s failure to arrive at the scene and the interview’s failure. Now, it seemed that these plans would not be needed for the time being.

Of course, in the end, it still depended on whether the interview could be broadcast smoothly.

When Liu Yuan’s interview came to an end, the security guard finally arrived at Room 1902.

They were shocked by the chaotic scene, especially the unconscious man. He was clearly the owner of this house!

The security Captain rushed in and shouted,””What are you guys doing here? He was simply too lawless! And those reporters, stop taking pictures! No filming is allowed here!”

Then, the security Captain turned around and said,””Xiao Cha, call the police immediately!”

One of the security guards quickly took out his phone and called the police.

Da Liu picked his ears and said,””What are you shouting for? I’m here to catch you in the act of adultery! This bastard slept with my brother’s wife! No matter how much you say, we’re still in the right!”

“Nonsense!” The head of security said sternly,”what you’re doing is illegal! I’m telling you, none of you can leave! We’ll talk when the police come!”

“You think you can stop me with just a few of you?” Da Liu sneered.

Da Liu’s underlings also burst into laughter. They patted the steel pipes in their hands and looked at the security guards with ill intentions.

The head of security subconsciously took a step back. The security force in the Qingqing community was not strong. There were only a dozen security guards at most, and only five or six people followed him here.

The few people in front of him looked fierce, and they were all holding weapons in their hands. They were not to be trifled with. Even if he called all the security guards over for reinforcements, they might not be their opponents!

More importantly, this was just their profession and their means of making a living. No one was really willing to risk their lives with these punks to help the owners.

“Uncle Dong, we’ve vented our anger, so let’s go back first!” Said Liu Da, curling his lips. Right, hurry up and divorce this woman! We’ve already taken a picture of the evidence. I heard that in this kind of cheating case, the judge will sentence the guilty party to leave the marriage with nothing!”

Fang Chenchen trembled when she heard that. She was not concerned about leaving the marriage with nothing, but whether Liu Dong would really divorce her.

Fang Chenchen finally remembered Liu Dong’s kindness. Back in the University, Liu Dong had waited for her outside her dormitory on a cold day just to give her breakfast. After graduation, the two of them studied together to prepare for the exams. Liu Dong made her delicious food every day. After they got married, Liu Dong gave in to her and doted on her. He did almost all the housework ...

The scenes from the past appeared in her mind.

Fang Chenchen felt that she had been possessed for a long time. She had actually become Liu haojun’s lover after a bit of rejection. She had to admit that after being with Liu haojun, she had gained a lot of benefits both in terms of material and career.

But now, in her opinion, these benefits were nothing compared to a considerate husband who loved her deeply.

However, there was no medicine for regret in this world.

Under Fang Chenchen’s remorseful gaze, Liu Dong’s expression became firm. He nodded and said,””Alright!”

Then, Liu Dong calmly said to Fang Chenchen,””I’ll prepare the divorce agreement. I’ll find time to settle the procedures! Don’t worry, I won’t let you leave the marriage with nothing, but Mengmeng must follow me! I don’t want my daughter to have a mother who doesn’t know shame!”
