If the spirit map space could really absorb these small black particles, the benefits would naturally be obvious.

However, Xia Qing shook her head and said,”master, there’s no problem with absorbing it, but the aura of the world stone contained in it is very weak. Moreover, they rely on absorbing the spiritual energy of the space to grow and reproduce. In addition, they also carry a cold and evil aura. When the spirit map world absorbs it, it also has to purify the aura. I’m afraid that under such a situation, not only will it not evolve, but it may even regress slightly.”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel a little disappointed, but he still sharply noticed the key point in Xia Qing’s words and immediately asked,””So ... If they’re in a place with poor spiritual energy outside, it’ll be difficult for them to reproduce and grow?”

Xia Qing nodded and said,”it should be. The essence of spiritual Qi is actually energy. The world stone also contains a large amount of pure energy. These black particles can continue to reproduce by absorbing energy. That’s why they can grow in the ancient tomb because the yin Qi is also a kind of energy. It’s also because of this that they have become like this.”

Xia ruofei was relieved to hear that.

Although Xia ruofei was a little disappointed that the spirit map space could not absorb them, at least a small amount of black particles would not be able to affect the environment.

Otherwise, this thing was colorless, odorless, and shapeless. If it was gathered in large numbers, it could even form a terrible plague.

Moreover, Xia Qing had also said that the spirit map space could still absorb these black particles. It was just that there were no benefits to absorbing them, and it might even cause minor damage.

Hence, Xia ruofei was even more at ease.

Even if the black particles scattered around the ancient tomb by chance absorbed the Reiki and became stronger, at least he could still absorb them through the Spirit map space and not cause a disaster.

“Master,” Xia Qing continued,”the reason why these small black particles attach themselves to a human’s body is actually to absorb the essence energy in the human body. This is also a type of energy.”

Xia ruofei nodded.”I’ve checked. The patient’s shaoyin heart has suffered the most serious corrosion. A large number of black particles are entrenched in this Meridian.”

“The heart meridian is the meridian with the most essence Qi in the human body, especially near the heart, where the essence Qi is the most vigorous. These black particles must be moving by instinct.” Xia Qing nodded her head and said,”master, you said that the person who was corroded fell unconscious. It must be because of the loss of a large amount of essence energy in his body, and the damage to his heart.”

Xia ruofei listened to Xia Qing’s analysis and felt that it was very reasonable. He nodded and said,””Yup! The more severe patients have been in a coma for a long time, and their vital signs have gradually weakened until they die. Obviously, it’s because too much of the essence in their bodies has been devoured, so they can’t stay awake. Moreover, the essence and blood in Chinese medicine can’t be detected by Western medicine, and there are no specific indicators. ”

“This kind of poison is extremely difficult to detect, even for a Chinese medicine practitioner with good medical skills.” Xia Qing smiled and said,”only a person with strong mental power like master would not miss the condition of the patient’s meridians.”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”I understand.” Xia Qing, you can continue with your work! I’m still a little worried, so I’m going to test if these black particles can multiply and grow in size in the outside world. ”

“Yes, master!”

With a thought, Xia ruofei kept the unnoticeable black dot in his hand and left the spirit map space in a flash.

After returning to his room, Xia ruofei released his spiritual force to wrap around the black dot.

As he had been practicing drawing runes with his mentality, Xia ruofei’s control of his mentality had improved. Although it was more difficult to control his mentality after it left his body, he could still do it easily.

Xia ruofei slowly loosened his restraints and separated about ten small particles from the black dot. Then, he completely let go of the suppression on them and only used his spiritual power to monitor their situation.

As for the remaining small particles, they were tightly wrapped by another strand of Xia ruofei’s spiritual power.

After the ten small particles regained their freedom, they started to dissipate in the air just like they did in the space.

However, Xia ruofei noticed that they did not exchange any energy with the outside world. In other words, these small particles could not absorb the spiritual Qi from the outside world to strengthen themselves.

Xia ruofei continued to observe for about half an hour and realized that there was basically no change in the black particles.

Only then did he release his mental force with relief and gather them all.

Since the black shard was not a threat, Xia ruofei was not worried anymore. He suddenly released his spiritual power and pressed it in.

These small black particles were actually quite fragile, so they were instantly annihilated under the sudden pressure.

Xia ruofei released his spiritual power to search and made sure that no one had escaped.

“Looks like I’ll have to find time to go to the tomb ...” Xia ruofei muttered to himself.

Since he knew that there was a high possibility of a world stone being there, Xia ruofei would definitely not let it go.

However, he was not in a hurry. After all, the ancient tomb of the Ming Dynasty had been sealed off by the local government. Ordinary people would not be able to enter at all. Moreover, the world stone might be in the main burial chamber deep inside. In addition, ordinary people would not be able to discover the uniqueness of the world stone, so there was no need to worry about others getting there before him.

Xia ruofei thought about it. If he wanted to enter the tomb, it would be best to use his connections with Song Wei. However, she was still recovering, so he should wait until she was completely recovered.

Xia ruofei tidied up the house, took a shower, and went back to his room to rest.

……

The next day, Xia ruofei received a phone call to inform him that the passport he had taken Lin Qiao to apply for last time was ready to be collected. So, he drove Lin Qiao to the exit – Entry Administration Department of the Changping County Public Security Bureau and collected the fresh dark red passport.

Xia ruofei bought two tickets to Shen Cheng city and took Lin Qiao to the Australian Embassy in Shen Cheng city to apply for a visa.

The director of the shencheng office of the United States shengbang group personally came to Hongqiao Airport to pick them up. As for their accommodation and other things, they had already been arranged in the five – Star shengbang hotel, which was shengbang group’s own global chain industry.

The director of shengbang group’s office in Shen Cheng was a Chinese man in his 30s named Lin zhenyi. He was a native of Shen Cheng, so he was naturally very familiar with it.

On the same day, Lin zhenyi personally brought Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao to the Australian Embassy in Shen Cheng to apply for a business visa for Lin Qiao.

Shengbang group had a great influence in the world. This time, Lin zhenyi came in person, and Lin Qiao also had a business inspection invitation letter issued by shengbang group, so the visa application was quite smooth.

Originally, it would have taken five to ten working days to get the visa signed, but the Australian Embassy made special arrangements and said that it would be accepted on the same day. They would be able to get their passports back by the third day at the latest, and the details would have to wait for a call from them.

Of course, one could also choose to pay the postage fee and have the consulate mail their passport.

However, Xia ruofei thought that it would only take two days, so he decided to wait in Shen Cheng city. He could take Lin Qiao around Shen Cheng city.

Lin Qiao naturally agreed happily.

After returning from the consulate, Lin zhenyi sent a Mercedes – Benz to Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao and arranged for two staff members to accompany them throughout the trip.

All the expenses were naturally covered by shengbang group.

Xia ruofei and elder Tang worked closely together, so he accepted the small amount of money.

In the next two days, Xia ruofei took Lin Qiao on a tour of shencheng. They left their mark on the Oriental Pearl Tower, shencheng Disney, the Bund, Chenghuang Temple, Nanjing Road, and many other places.

It was not until the third day that Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao received their passports from the Australian Embassy in Shen Cheng that they took a flight back to San Shan.

For Lin Qiao, this was just a warm – up. The real trip was to Australia. The thought of traveling with Xia ruofei in a foreign country made Lin Qiao very excited.

……

When Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao were on the plane back to the three mountains, the air in a high – end residence in the three mountains city seemed to be a little heavy. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

A middle – aged man in his forties was sitting on the sofa with a gloomy face. There were some broken pieces of teacups on the carpet in front of him, and the Italy wool carpet was stained with a lot of ugly tea stains.

The housekeeper stood in the distance, trembling with fear, not daring to come over and clean up.

Next to the middle – aged man was a young man who also looked nervous. He lowered his head and didn’t even dare to breathe.

If Xia ruofei was here, he would have recognized this young man as yang Jianren, the one he had a conflict with at the Xijiang Moon Club.

The fat middle – aged man with a balding head was yang Jianren’s father, yang Jinsheng, the executive Vice Minister of the organization Department of the Sanshan Municipal Party.

Today, he had just received news from a leader in the province that his promotion inspection had been suspended. In the morning, various inspection groups of the Provincial Party Committee organization Department had entered the units where the candidates were to be promoted, but the municipal Party Committee organization Department had not welcomed the provincial inspection group.

The organization’s inspection had been halted. What this meant was already very clear.

When yang Jinsheng heard this news, it was as if he had been struck by lightning. The first thing he did was to link this strange change to the matter that his son, yang Jianren, had timidly returned home to report to him a few days ago.

Yang Jinsheng also had the support of the leaders in the provincial team. The promotion this time was supposed to be a matter of course, but now there was an unexpected change. There must have been an accident in the middle.

The most likely accident was the mysterious Mr. Xia that yang Jianren had offended that day.

Therefore, yang Jinsheng immediately called yang Jianren back and gave him a scolding.

If he was not his biological son, yang Jinsheng would not have been able to do it, and he would have kicked him a few times.

After smashing a few teacups and cursing to his heart’s content, yang Jinsheng’s face darkened. He glared at yang Jianren and said,”Tell me what happened that day again. If you dare to hide anything, I’ll break your legs!”
