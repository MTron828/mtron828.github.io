Chapter 565: Chapter 433 – sending money to the door (2)

In addition, two large lamps were specially lit on the open space in front of the small building. Qian Lijun had probably been waiting for a while. He was smoking a cigarette in boredom. When the Knight XV’s lamp shone on him, his eyes lit up. He threw away the cigarette butt and quickly walked over.

When the car was under the light, Qian Lijun could finally see the big black thing that looked like a monster.

“Wow! Ruofei, your car is too exciting!” Qian Lijun’s eyes revealed an undisguisable look of envy.

Any man who had served in the military would have no resistance to this monster – Class SUV that was full of wildness.

Xia ruofei opened the car door and jumped out with a smile.””It’s exciting, right?”

“How exciting!” Qian Lijun said enviously,”ruofei, can you lend it to me for a few days?”

“No problem! I’m going to be in Anyue city these two days, so you can be the driver!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Good, good!” Qian Lijun said happily.

At this time, master Luo also got out of the car. Xia ruofei went over and said,””Master Luo, you’ve worked hard during this period of time. You should go back and rest! A few of my employees will be here tomorrow. I’ll have to trouble you to teach them!”

“Don’t worry, boss Xia! As long as they’re willing to learn, I won’t hide anything from them!” Master Luo said with a simple smile.

Then, he bade Xia ruofei and Qian Lijun goodbye and left.

Qian Lijun and Xia ruofei walked into the small building with their arms around each other’s shoulders. Qian Lijun immediately arranged for Xia ruofei to stay in the cultivating base of the Dendrobium candids. There was a guest room on the small building.

“Li Jun, have you contacted Pan Qiang and Wang Zhihai?” Xia ruofei asked.

“Don’t worry! We’re all waiting for you to come over!” Qian Lijun said as he walked,”just listen to my arrangements for the next few days! Tomorrow, we’ll gather our comrades in ou Yue together. The day after tomorrow, we’ll bring Pan Qiang and Wang Zhihai to Yandang mountain for a day. How about it?”

“Alright, I’ll follow your arrangements.” Xia ruofei said.

“By the way, how’s the production of those iron – skinned maples going?” Qian Lijun asked again.

“It went quite smoothly. I’ve already sold them all to Qiantang Tongren Hall. This time, it’s really all thanks to you!” Xia ruofei said,”from now on, my employees will be learning from you. Please help me take care of them!”

“Do I still need you to explain this?” Qian Lijun said,”just relax!”

As it was already very late, Qian Lijun went back to sleep after sending Xia ruofei to her room.

After Xia ruofei returned to his room, he washed up and went to bed.

The next morning, Xia ruofei slept until eighto’ clock before he woke up. He had driven a few hundred kilometers the day before and slept a little late. He took advantage of the fact that there were no special arrangements today to catch up on his sleep.

Qian Lijun had already prepared breakfast. When Xia ruofei saw boss Qian, he expressed his gratitude once again.

The gathering time was at night. Pan Qiang and Wang Zhihai were in the county below, so they would arrive at Qian Lijun’s place before noon.

Therefore, he had nothing to do in the morning.

Xia ruofei sent the location to Qin Xiaojun via WeChat and asked them to take a taxi.

After Qin Xiaojun and the others rushed to the iron – Skin Dendrobium cultivation base, Qian Lijun personally arranged their accommodation. At the same time, he also instructed master Luo to bring them around to familiarize themselves with the environment.

Master Luo and the others would naturally help arrange the rest of his studies, so Xia ruofei had nothing to do with it. He simply asked Qian Lijun to show him around the iron – Skin Dendrobium cultivation base.

Although Xia ruofei had planted tens of thousands of iron – Skin dendrobes in the spirit map space, the space was filled with rich spiritual Qi. The iron – Skin dendrobes did not need to be taken care of at all. He had only done some work during the cutting and harvesting.

Therefore, Xia ruofei had no idea about the cultivation of the iron – Skin Dendrobium. He asked Qian Lijun about it as he visited the place.

……

In the small building, boss Qian was leisurely holding a teapot and admiring the red Arowana in the big fish tank.

The first time Xia ruofei heard about the red Arowana was through Qian Lijun.

He wondered if the pair of Red Arowana in the fish tank was the same pair in the photo that Qian Lijun had shown Xia ruofei.

At that moment, a taxi stopped in front of the building.

A fat middle – aged man squeezed out of the taxi and said to the driver,””Master, wait for me here for a while. I have something to do and will be out soon.”

The middle – aged man had already paid the deposit, and he had also promised to pay an extra 50 yuan for the fare, so the taxi driver nodded happily and said,””Alright! Boss, please hurry up!”

“I know, I know. You can pull over first!” The fat middle – aged man waved his hand and said. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Then, he strode into the small building.

The fat middle – aged man was fat all over his body, and his body trembled as he walked. He had a greasy slicked – back hair, a thick gold chain around his neck, a jade ring on his thumb, and a large string of beeswax on his wrist. He looked exactly like a nouveau riche.

The fat middle – aged man climbed up a few steps and arrived at the entrance of the small building.

When he saw boss Qian in the living room, his eyes revealed some fear. He took a deep breath and shouted,””Old Qian ...”

The fat middle – aged man’s voice was full of flattery.

Boss Qian turned his head when he heard the voice. When he saw the middle – aged fatty, he couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows and glare at him. He shouted angrily,””Liu Jinsheng! You still have the face to see me?”
