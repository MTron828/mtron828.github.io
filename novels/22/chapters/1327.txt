Chapter 1328: Chapter 793-it’s too late to regret (2)

Translator: 549690339

Squad leader old Luo’s original words were,”we must abide by discipline when we go out. We can’t cause trouble for no reason. However, we don’t cause trouble, but we are not afraid of trouble!” Even if it’s a fight, as long as you’re in the right, I’ll take the blame for you! But there’s one thing, if you lose in a fight, don’t blame me for punishing you!”

Therefore, even though Xia ruofei was usually kind to everyone, he was never a kind person. If no one provoked him, he would naturally be humble. However, Xia ruofei would never be polite to anyone who was stupid enough to walk right into his trap.

Xia ruofei had only stepped on Chen shun in passing, but he had already caused Chen shun to be in trouble.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it’s just a small incident. It’s not that serious.” Besides ... Isn’t this guy no longer an employee of your company soon?”

Tang Wei Ran nodded with a smile and said,”we must get rid of these black sheep!” After Chairman Wei took office, he has been working hard to build up the internal atmosphere, hoping to create an internal atmosphere of peace and harmony. I think this incident can be used as a negative example and let the whole company take it as a warning!”

Unconsciously, Tang weiran’s impression of Chen shun had become more serious. If Chen shun knew about this, she wondered how he would feel.

However, based on the principle that the more lice there were, the less itchy it would be, it probably wouldn’t cause a greater psychological impact on Chen shun.

At this moment, Chen shun was like a dead man. He stood at the door and looked at the electric car that Xia ruofei and Tang weiran were on. The car drove further and further away until even the red tail lights disappeared.

The purchasing agent he brought with him stood to the side with some pity and did not say anything.

However, the taxi driver was a little impatient. He poked his head out of the car and asked in Mandarin with a heavy Sanshan accent,””Are you guys still going?”

They had already agreed to use his car to go back and forth, and he would not stop the clock.

Chen shun turned a deaf ear, as if external stimulation had no effect on him.

The purchasing Commissioner quickly said a few good words to the taxi driver and handed him a cigarette. Then, he walked to Chen shun and whispered,””Manager Chen ...”

The purchasing Commissioner called him a few times, but Chen shun didn’t respond. In the end, he patted him a few times before he came back to his senses.

“Manager Chen, it’s useless for us to waste our time here,” the purchasing Commissioner said in a low voice.”I think ... We should go back to Beijing as soon as possible and find President Chen to think of a way!”

It was like Chen shun had seen a ray of light in the dark night. He immediately regained his strength and said,”Yes, yes, yes! Let’s go back to the capital! Return to the capital immediately! Go online and check if there are any more flights to Beijing tonight. Book the tickets first and we’ll go to the airport directly!”

“Manager Chen, our luggage is still in the city!” The purchasing Commissioner said.

“Then book me a ticket first!” Chen shun said impatiently. After you send me to the airport, you can go back to the city. You can go back by yourself tomorrow morning!”

“Alright!” The purchasing Commissioner didn’t dare to say anything more and quickly agreed.

The two of them got into the taxi again. When the driver heard that they were going to the airport first before returning to the city, he didn’t say anything and started the car.

Anyway, they had to watch the entire journey, so they could go to as many places as they wanted. Besides, the airport was not far from here, so it was just a matter of taking a detour.

Chen shun took the red – Eye flight with his last trace of hope and finally set foot on the land of Beijing at oneo’ clock in the morning.

The nightmare – like business trip experience was unbearable for him.

Although it was already very late, Chen shun couldn’t wait to call Chen Weinan as soon as he got off the plane.

Chen Weinan also had a hard time sleeping. After he called Chen shun, he immediately began to contact all the leaders, classmates, and friends who might be able to help.

However, the more he called, the colder his heart became. Everyone avoided him like a snake or Scorpion. After a phone call, he didn’t get anything.

Then, Chen Weinan, who was like an ant on a hot pan, called Chen shun. In Chen Weinan’s heart, this was the last straw to save his life, although the hope was very slim.

However, Chen shun had just boarded the plane and his phone was turned off.

Just like that, Chen Weinan finally got a call from Chen shun. He couldn’t wait to answer the phone.

“Chen shun, how’s the situation?” Chen Weinan asked urgently.

“Second uncle, they won’t even let us in!” Chen shun said with a crying face.

Chen Weinan suddenly felt as if a bucket of cold water had been poured on him, and his hands and feet were a little stiff.

“Can’t you think of a way!” “What did I tell you before?” Chen Weinan said in anger and anxiety.

“I’ve already begged my grandfather and grandmother,”Chen Weinan said with a sobbing tone,”I’m just short of kneeling down to him, but it’s useless! Second uncle, President Tang is with the boss of the Paradise Corporation. President Tang scolded me and asked me to leave immediately and not disturb them ...”

“You ...” Chen Weinan felt as if all the strength in his body had been sucked out, and he finally asked weakly,”then why did you call me?”

“Second uncle, I’m already in Beijing, let’s think of a way together!” Said Chen Weinan.

Chen Weinan was so angry that smoke came out of his seven orifices,”what’s the use of you coming back?!” I can’t even protect myself now! What can I use to help you!”

Chen Weinan was completely speechless towards his stupid nephew.

If it was him, he would have stayed at the door no matter what Tang weiran said. If he really couldn’t do it, he could just kneel at the door for a night and throw away his face. What if the other party was moved by compassion?

Of the three brothers, two of them had daughters. Chen shun was the only male in the next generation, so they doted on him very much. However, most children who grew up in this environment were useless.

Now Chen Weinan regretted not helping his brother to discipline Chen shun. As a result, he had grown up to be such a scammer.

No, it was a “scammer”!

“Second uncle, you can’t just leave me alone!” “I ... If I lose my job, I won’t be able to find a wife anymore ...” Chen shun cried out.

Chen Weinan was annoyed and said,”I also have to manage it!” Alright, alright, you can go back first! We’ll talk about it tomorrow ...”

“Then, about my work ...”

“I’ll think of another way tomorrow!” Chen Weinan interrupted Chen shun and hung up the phone.

In fact, even Chen Weinan himself did not believe this, but Chen shun did.

He felt a little more at ease. He took a taxi home from the airport, washed his hair, and went to sleep.

Chen Weinan, on the other hand, had a sleepless night.

The next day, as soon as he arrived at the company, two middle – aged Men in Black jackets were already waiting at the door of his office.

“Are you comrade Chen Weinan?” One of them said expressionlessly,”we’re from the group’s Discipline Inspection team. We need to find you to understand the situation. Please come with us!”

Chen Weinan’s heart was like dead ashes. He had already had a bad feeling about the situation, but he didn’t expect this moment to come so soon.

Yesterday, Chen shun had only been at the three mountains for half a day and one night, but the discipline Inspection had already taken measures against him.

Chen Weinan didn’t know that it was because he had incited Chen shun to go to Tao Yuan farm to remedy the situation. This made Tang weiran realize that someone in the group had leaked the news. So, after he accompanied Xia ruofei to visit the farm, he called Wei Jianming overnight to report, which led to the sudden attack of the discipline Inspection team today.

Chen shun also arrived at the company on time. He rushed to Chen Weinan’s office as soon as he got to work. He didn’t expect to run into the discipline Inspection team and see Chen Weinan being held on both sides.

Chen shun was almost scared out of his wits. He subconsciously turned around and walked back.

However, they had already been discovered by a sharp – eyed disciplinary officer. One of them shouted in a dignified manner,””You must be Chen shun! Don’t go! Come back with us to be investigated!”

Under everyone’s gazes, Chen shun stopped. He slowly turned his head back with a pale face, his heart filled with despair ...
