2522 Reborn (2)

“I understand!” Wu Lei said with a serious face.

Then, Wu Lei picked up the bowl of medicine and tested the temperature with his lips. He felt that there was no problem. He raised his head to look at Xia ruofei and said,””Brother Xia, I’ll drink it!”

“Drink!” Xia ruofei nodded and said,”don’t worry. Even if you can’t take it, you won’t be seriously hurt with me around! But he had to do his best to persevere! I believe that with your willpower, you will definitely be able to do it!”

Wu Lei nodded heavily. Without any hesitation, he lifted the bowl of medicine and gulped down the entire bowl of body tempering soup without leaving a single drop.

When the body tempering soup entered Wu Lei’s stomach, he suddenly felt as if a pot of charcoal fire had started to burn in his stomach. At this time, he remembered Xia ruofei’s instructions and quickly put down the medicine bowl. He sat on the ground and started the first set of body – refining movements for the little golden man.

Xia ruofei glanced around and realized that Wu Lei’s movements were more accurate this time. There were a few missing parts.

Xia ruofei knew that time was of the essence. At this moment, Wu Lei must be suffering from the pain of the body tempering soup’s cleansing. Hence, without a second word, he quickly corrected a few parts of Wu Lei’s movements that were not quite up to standard.

When Wu Lei got into the correct body refining posture, the pain on his face suddenly reduced a lot. His face was originally red like he had a high fever, but now it had slowed down a little.

Wu Lei felt like he was in a furnace. He felt like he was being roasted by a raging fire. He could no longer feel the pain from the body – tempering movement. He was only using his willpower to maintain the movement.

Xia ruofei watched from the side and was slightly worried. However, he couldn’t help at this time and could only silently cheer for Wu Lei.

Wu Lei gritted his teeth and persevered. The medicinal properties of the body tempering soup were also being absorbed bit by bit, and the burning sensation was weakening bit by bit.

This process lasted for about ten minutes before Wu Lei finally felt that he had recovered a little. At the same time, he once again felt the pain caused by the body – refining movement.

The familiar pain made Wu Lei want to cry. Although it was still very painful, it was nothing compared to the burning pain caused by the body tempering soup.

Moreover, the pain from the body – tempering movement indicated that the medicinal properties of the body tempering soup had been mostly absorbed …

After 20 minutes, Wu Lei fell to the ground because he couldn’t bear the pain of the body refining movement and ended the practice.

Because of the body tempering soup, there was not much time for reference, but there was no doubt that Wu Lei’s physical fitness had once again improved by leaps and bounds.

Because at this time, Wu Lei’s bare skin was covered with a layer of black fat – like impurities that emitted an unpleasant smell. It was even more impurities than the first time he practiced the body refining movement yesterday.

Wu Lei also noticed this immediately. In fact, he didn’t even need to see these impurities to feel the huge changes in his body. His body still looked a little thin, but there seemed to be endless energy in his body. The majestic power made Wu Lei feel that he could kill a cow with one punch.

Of course, Wu Lei didn’t know if it was an illusion, but it was a fact that his body and strength had greatly improved.

He got up from the ground and said gratefully,””Brother Xia, I owe you more and more favors!”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said with a smile,””Since you call me big brother, you don’t have to be so formal. Go and wash up! It’s almost Seveno’ clock now. Don’t delay your morning training. ”

“Alright!” Wu Lei nodded and said.

He had come prepared today. He was wearing the training T – Shirt he had worn at the domestic club and the Spanish team training uniform he was going to wear in the morning. He had brought it in his bag.Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Wu Lei didn’t stand on ceremony with Xia ruofei anymore. He grabbed his bag and went into the bathroom.

While Wu Lei was taking a shower, Xia ruofei received a call from Zhou leiyun.

“Chief Zhou!” Xia ruofei answered the call with a smile.

“President Xia, do you have any plans today?” Zhou leiyun asked,”I’m almost done with my work here. I can accompany you around Barcelona!”

Dong Yun and her team had already returned to China on paradise yesterday. As Xia ruofei did not return with them, only one of them had to take a commercial flight.

Similarly, everyone in the group used red packets to draw this “unlucky person”. What was somewhat dramatic was that shi wen, who had managed to grab the smallest amount of red packets when she came, was actually the luckiest one this time and became the only person who needed to take a commercial flight back to China.

When Xia ruofei saw the results, he could not help but send three laughing emojis in the group.

After Paradise returned to China, it would soon carry the second batch of employees who were on vacation in Spain to Barcelona. Xia ruofei would also return to China with this batch of employees.

Hence, Xia ruofei still had more than a week left in Spain.

After hearing Zhou leiyun’s words, Xia ruofei pondered for a moment and said,””Director Zhou, I want to go to the club to watch the first team train today. Do you want to come?”

“You actually want to watch the training?” Zhou leiyun asked in surprise. No problem! The host will do as the guest wishes. I will make the arrangements as you wish. “
