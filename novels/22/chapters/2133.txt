2134 Surviving a great disaster (1)

In such a dangerous moment, Xia ruofei had no other choice. He only had one choice, and that was to hide in the spirit map space.

In fact, Xia ruofei was not confident at all. Once he entered the space, the spirit map would be exposed to the outside world. No one could say for sure if the spirit map would be damaged in the face of such a storm.

Once the painting was destroyed, Xia ruofei would lose all means of survival. If the painting was destroyed, the spirit map space would be destroyed as well. Even if Xia ruofei could survive the destruction of the space, everything in the space would be destroyed, including the two yachts, big and small, as well as a huge amount of living supplies. Without these things, how could Xia ruofei return to land?

Xia ruofei had already analyzed the worst case scenario when he was trying to drive the yacht out of the storm zone. However, he had no other choice now, and he had no time to think.

Before the huge wave hit him, Xia ruofei gritted his teeth and summoned the spirit map scroll from his palm. Then, with a single thought, he disappeared from the outside world and entered the spirit map space.

The ancient painting fell into the sea. The next moment, it was slammed by the waves and pressed into the sea.

After Xia ruofei entered the spatial zone, he immediately appeared at the entrance of the cave on the mountainside of the mountain in the mountain sea realm. His expression was grave as he observed the situation outside. Even when Xia Qing and the White realmfox came over, he didn’t have the mood to care.

To Xia ruofei’s relief, the spirit painting was not damaged even though it was rolling in the water.

In fact, when Xia ruofei first obtained the spirit painting, he had tried it out. He realized that the painting was unusually strong. No matter if it was soaked in water, burned by fire, or torn by force, it could not be damaged at all.

Moreover, the volume of the painting scroll was so small, and it was even in the shape of a cylinder. The impact of the waves should not be that great.

This gave Xia ruofei some confidence.

Of course, the most important thing was that he could faintly feel that the cultivator who could create such a vast dimensional space must have a terrifyingly high cultivation. The magic weapons made by such a person should be very strong.

Now, Xia ruofei could only comfort himself like this. The environment outside was extremely harsh. He would not be able to survive if he went out now. He could only pray that the spirit map scroll was powerful enough.

Although the spirit map scroll was constantly rolling up and down in the sea, the space could not feel it at all. It was completely the same as usual, without even a trace of vibration.

Xia ruofei guessed that the spirit map space was actually a separate space, and the scroll was just an entrance to it.

Only through the scroll could he connect the outside world and the spirit map space.

“Master ...” Xia Qing called out again.

Xia ruofei came back to his senses and said to Xia Qing,””I’m fine ... You can go back to your work!”

When he stopped the boat and slept, he had sealed off the spirit map space to sense the outside world. Therefore, neither Xia Qing nor the White realm Fox knew what was happening in the outside world.

However, they had all seen Xia ruofei storing the huge azmu yacht. The white fox knew that Xia ruofei had been driving the yacht on the sea for the past few days.

Xia Qing was absolutely obedient to her master’s orders. He immediately nodded and said,””Alright ...”

Just as Xia Qing was about to teleport back to the Archean realm to take care of the Strasburg geese, Xia ruofei suddenly called out to him.

“That’s right, Xia Qing!” Xia ruofei asked,”this spirit painting won’t be easily damaged, right?”

Xia Qing’s understanding of the spirit map space was definitely more than Xia ruofei ‘s, but due to the rules, she couldn’t tell Xia ruofei everything. Hence, Xia ruofei wanted to find some comfort from Xia Qing.

Xia Qing was stunned for a moment, and then said,”of course!” The materials used to create the scroll are very precious, otherwise, it would be impossible to maintain a stable spatial node ...”

Xia ruofei’s heart relaxed a little, but Xia Qing changed the topic and said,””But it’s not absolute. If it’s hit by a huge external force, the scroll might be damaged.”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but frown and asked,””Then what level of external force can damage the painting?” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Xia Qing forced a smile and said,”I’m not sure about this. Generally speaking, the attack of a master of the original infant stage can’t do anything to this painting. If the cultivation is higher ... I’ve never experienced it ...”

Xia ruofei was also helpless. He did not know how destructive a full – force attack from an original infant stage cultivator was. That level of cultivation was still too far away for him. Even if he knew, he could not directly convert it to the impact of the storm on the painting!

However, Xia Qing’s words still gave Xia ruofei some comfort. At least this painting was made of very precious materials, so it should not be a problem to soak in the sea for a while.

“Alright, you can go!” He nodded.

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing’s figure flickered, and she disappeared from the mountain sea realm.

Xia ruofei looked at the white fox and said,””Little fellow, you should also go and rest first! When the storm outside calms down, I’ll continue sailing!”

The White realmfox did not throw a tantrum, which was very rare. It nodded in a very human – like way. Then, a white light flashed past and left the platform on the mountainside.
