2447 You’ll have a bright future if you follow me (2)

In the past two months, although Xia ruofei did not deliberately cultivate in the spirit map space, his cultivation had improved to a certain extent due to the unique environment and the fact that he needed to cultivate to recover from his condition sometimes.

Now, Xia ruofei could clearly feel that he was about to break through the bottleneck of refined Qi level 9.

His experience told him that this was actually a sign of a breakthrough.

As for how long it would take, it was not easy to judge. It was possible that he would break through naturally in the next cultivation, but it was also possible that he would need to drag on for a period of time.

However, he was sure that he was not far from breaking through to refined Qi level 9.

Liu chengfeng felt that his knowledge system of cultivation that he had formed over the past few decades was about to collapse.

Qi level 8. Even if he was about to break through to the peak of Qi level 9, he was only one level higher than him. But in front of Xia ruofei, he had no power to resist.

So, Liu chengfeng couldn’t help but ask,””Master, if you’re only a Qi condensation cultivator, how did you ...”

Liu chengfeng suddenly realized something and quickly said,””I understand! Master, that’s because we’re in your spatial magic treasure!”

Liu chengfeng was initially confused as to why Xia ruofei, as a Qi refining cultivator, could have such an incredible ability like standing in the air and even teleporting. Then, he thought about it and realized that it was in Xia ruofei’s spatial Dharma Treasure. Although he did not know much about such a high – grade spatial Dharma Treasure, he could guess that the reason Xia ruofei was able to use a nascent soul cultivator’s divine power in here was most likely related to the spatial Dharma Treasure.

However, Liu chengfeng would not look down on Xia ruofei just because he was only in the Qi refining stage. Even without the soul seal, Xia ruofei could still crush him.

That day, his mental power was completely suppressed, and he was not in the spatial treasure.

Thinking of this, Liu chengfeng couldn’t help but ask curiously,””Master, if I may be so bold as to ask, your spiritual power cultivation ...”

“I’ve just broken through to the spirit gathering realm not long ago,”Xia ruofei said indifferently.

Liu chengfeng couldn’t help but shiver. He looked at Xia ruofei with respect and said,””Master’s spiritual power cultivation has already reached the spirit gathering realm! No wonder ...”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”the spirit gathering stage is nothing!” The Qi refining stage was just the beginning of cultivation. It wasn’t even enough to lay the foundation. As long as you work for me with all your heart, your future achievements will definitely not stop at the Qi refining stage!”

Liu chengfeng knelt down again in excitement and said,””It’s my great fortune to meet you, master! This subordinate’s life is yours, master. Even if I have to go through fire and water, as long as Master says the word, this subordinate will not hesitate to sacrifice my life!”

Xia ruofei said indifferently,”okay, I need you to return to the sect and gather all the information about the cultivation world. Other than that, you don’t need to do anything else. You don’t need to deliberately gather information either. You just need to note it down within the range that you can normally come into contact with. Don’t deliberately ask about it. Your safety is the most important. I will need you in the future.”

Xia ruofei was very clear about the power of the soul seal, so he had explained it clearly to Liu chengfeng to prevent him from working too hard and giving himself away.

“Thank you for your understanding, master!” Liu chengfeng said, touched. This subordinate will remember!”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and asked again,”by the way, you disappeared for a few days. Will the sect be suspicious?”

“No, I won ‘t!” Liu chengfeng quickly said. Every year, disciples above the fifth Qi layer have a month of vacation, and often have the opportunity to leave the sect to go out to do business. This subordinate used the vacation to come out this time. Generally speaking, unless something big happens in the sect, no one will come to find this subordinate during the vacation!”

The world of cultivation was not isolated from the world. They had never cut off contact with the secular world, so they used modern means of communication. Xia ruofei found a mobile phone in Liu chengfeng’s personal belongings, but he had casually thrown it into the warehouse where the spoils of war were kept. In the spirit map space, mobile phone signals could not penetrate in.

“Master,” Liu chengfeng added,”even if someone looks for me during this period, I can just find a reason to brush it off. It’s normal for cultivators to go into seclusion. Some people don’t even turn on their phones for the whole holiday. It’s fine as long as they return to the sect on time.”

Hearing this, Xia ruofei finally felt at ease. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“I’ll take you to a place!”He said after some thought.

With that, he teleported to the Archean realm with Liu chengfeng and appeared in the open space in front of the Linglong Pagoda.

“You can stay here and cultivate ... By the way, how much time do you have left for your holiday?” Xia ruofei said.

Liu chengfeng looked a little embarrassed and said,””When I met master in Pingan County that day, I had just started my vacation ... Counting the days, I should have about twenty days left on my vacation.”

Xia ruofei did some calculations. A year in the Archean realm was only about 12 days in the outside world. Hence, he said,””Liu chengfeng, you can cultivate here for a year first. Try to make a breakthrough in your cultivation!”

The soul seal could ensure Liu chengfeng’s loyalty. In addition, after the space was upgraded, it could exchange energy with the chaotic space. Liu chengfeng’s cultivation here would not affect the spiritual Qi in the space. Hence, Xia ruofei would not be stingy with his cultivation resources.

The stronger Liu chengfeng was, the more help he would be. Xia ruofei naturally understood this.

“One year?” Liu chengfeng asked in surprise. Master! Then ... What about the sect ...”

Xia ruofei said indifferently,”the time flow here is 30 times slower than the outside world. If you cultivate here for one year, only 12 or 13 days would have passed in the outside world. The remaining time is enough for you to return to the sect.”

After Liu chengfeng heard Xia ruofei’s words, he was stunned on the spot like a clay sculpture. He was so shocked by this news that he had lost his ability to think.

Time law! And it was a difference of 30 times in the flow of time! This spatial magic treasure was simply too heaven – defying ...

“Liu chengfeng!” Xia ruofei frowned and shouted.

Liu chengfeng came back to his senses and quickly bowed,””Thank you, master! This subordinate will definitely work hard to cultivate! He would strive to break through to refined Qi level 8 as soon as possible! In the future, I will be able to contribute more to master!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”you only have one mission here, and that is to improve your cultivation as much as possible.” Also, don’t touch anything here. I’ll have people prepare some living supplies for you. If you run out of supplies, just contact me through telepathy at any time!”

Xia ruofei was not worried that Liu chengfeng would lose control, but he still gave him some advice.

In fact, Xia ruofei had constructed a spatial barrier around some of the important resources and resources in the Archean realm as protection. For example, the spirit heart tree, spirit heart fruit, and spirit Heart Flower petals. Even if Liu chengfeng accidentally barged in, these strategic resources would not be damaged.

“Yes!” Liu chengfeng quickly replied. Master! This subordinate will definitely remember this in my heart!”

The thought of being able to cultivate in an environment where the spiritual Qi was so dense that it had turned into mist for a year made Liu chengfeng extremely excited. His respect and gratitude for Xia ruofei deepened.

Xia ruofei then called Xia Qing over and briefly told her about Liu chengfeng.

Xia Qing naturally knew that the “soul seal” was passed down from the heaven word jade talisman. Seeing that Xia ruofei had condensed a soul seal in such a short time and had even taken in a seventh Qi layer soul slave, she couldn’t help but congratulate Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei asked Xia Qing to move some compressed biscuits, instant noodles, bottled water, and other living supplies to the Linglong tower. She also brought a sleeping bag.

These were the living supplies for Liu chengfeng. As long as there was enough spiritual Qi, cultivators didn’t need too much food. Although Qi refining cultivators couldn’t completely abstain from eating, they didn’t need to be too particular about food. These supplies were basically enough for Liu chengfeng to support himself for a year.

Xia ruofei gave Liu chengfeng a few more instructions and left the spirit map space, satisfied.
