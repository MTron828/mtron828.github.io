Chapter 416: Chapter 369 – directly kick_1

“He’s on the second floor! The second room on the left was master Luo’s personal resting room! “The woman is inside ...” Brother Tiger quickly said.

His mental defense had been completely destroyed by Xia ruofei. The only thought in his mind was to get as far away from this demon as possible.

As soon as brother Tiger finished speaking, he felt his vision blur and Xia ruofei disappeared. In the next moment, Xia ruofei’s figure appeared at the entrance of the stairs leading to the second floor.

Brother Tiger panted heavily as he stared at Xia ruofei’s ghostly back, his eyes filled with fear.

He knew that he had kicked an iron plate today. Even master Luo would not be able to do much in front of this ruthless person.

Brother Hu’s only hope was that master Luo had not done anything to that girl yet. Otherwise, he could not imagine how he would face Xia ruofei’s anger.

……

Time went back to twenty minutes ago.

Lu You was forcefully dragged to Fang Luo’s exclusive lounge on the second floor by brother Tiger and his men. On the way, Lu You was struggling with all her might, but it was to no avail. She was a weak woman. How could she be a match for a few big men?

“Brother Hu, what do we do now?” One of the men asked.

Brother Tiger pointed to a bottle of wine on the bedside table and said,””Serve this lady until she’s finished.”

“Understood!”

The burly man grinned hideously as he walked over to open the wine bottle. The remaining few people grabbed Lu You’s arm tightly. No matter how hard Lu You struggled, it was to no avail.

“Let me go ... Let me go ... You bunch of animals ...”

Lu You shouted as she struggled. However, all of this was a futile effort. Very quickly, the burly man started to pour wine into Lu You’s mouth.

Lu You shook her head desperately, trying to avoid it. However, the burly man inserted the bottle into her mouth and started to pour the water in.

Lu You choked and coughed violently. A lot of the wine flowed out from the corners of her mouth and even her nostrils. The smell of wine filled the room, but most of the wine was forced into her stomach.

Lu You had already drunk quite a lot of strong rum, and after mixing it with so much foreign wine, she very quickly felt dizzy. After the alcohol hit her, her strength to struggle also disappeared, and her entire body slowly collapsed onto the bed.

“Xia ruofei ... Save me ...” Lu You, who had already lost her ability to move, mumbled as her chest heaved up and down.

Brother Tiger gestured for the few men to lay Lu You on the bed.

At this moment, the burly man who had poured the wine for Lu You looked at Lu You with a burning gaze. Then, he moved closer to brother Tiger and laughed.”Brother Hu, do you want to give this girl some aphrodisiac?”

The few underlings beside him also showed a smile of understanding.

Tonight’s beauty was really of the highest quality. Although these people could only look at her and not touch her, they were all tempted. Moreover, they were even fantasizing that after Fang Luo had used her, he would give her to them and his brothers! Even if Fang Luo had used it before, they would still drool over it.

Brother Tiger looked at the man coldly and asked,””How long have you been with master Luo?”

The burly man was stunned for a moment before he said weakly,””Three ... Three years ...” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“You’ve been with master Luo for three years. Haven’t you learned the basic rules?” Brother Tiger said coldly,”do you know the consequences of acting on your own?”

The burly man suddenly broke out in a cold sweat, and his face turned pale. He quickly said,””Brother Hu ... I ... I know I was wrong ...”

Brother Tiger snorted and said,””Don’t do it again. ”

“Yes, yes, yes ...”

Brother Tiger took a look at Lu You, who was on the bed. At this moment, Lu You had already fallen into a state of heavy drunkenness. Her body was slightly twisting on the bed. Any man who saw her would be unable to help but feel their hearts palpitate. However, brother Tiger’s eyes were as cold as ever, without the slightest ripple of emotion.

“Leave one person outside to keep watch,” brother Tiger said.”Unless there’s an emergency, no one is allowed to come in.”

“Yes! Brother Tiger!” Everyone responded in unison.

Brother Tiger left the room and went straight to the large private room next door.

In the private room, Fang Luo was leisurely sipping a glass of red wine. There were two gorgeously dressed girls beside him, and they slithered around him like water snakes. A few burly Men in Black stood guard at the door like iron towers.

Brother Tiger walked up to Fang Luo, bowed slightly, and leaned down to whisper into Fang Luo’s ear,””Lord Luo, everything has been arranged.”

Fang Luo’s ferocious triangular eyes suddenly lit up. He patted brother Tiger’s shoulder in satisfaction and said,””Tiger, thank you for your hard work.”

With that, Fang Luo stood up and walked out of the private room in big strides, leaving the two girls behind.

Although he had only seen a side profile photo, Fang Luo’s heart was already itching for a fight. He could feel his evil fire stirring, and he couldn’t wait to go back to his room and dote on that exquisite beauty.

Fang Luo had only taken two steps when his phone rang.

He immediately frowned. This was his personal phone, and not many people knew the number. The person who could make this call must be someone close to him.

Fang Luo gestured to brother Hu, who immediately strode over to the coffee table and picked up his phone. When he saw the caller ID, his expression froze. He quickly walked to Fang Luo with his phone and said in a low voice,””Master Luo, it’s young master Liang.”

Fang Luo immediately took the phone. Brother Hu waved his hand and led the Men in Black and the two girls out of the room.

Fang Luo’s success was not only due to his ruthlessness, but also due to the support of the rich. Otherwise, a gangster like him who only knew how to fight and be ruthless would have died many times over.

Fang Luo’s benefactor was the mysterious young master Liang.

Therefore, Fang Luo did not dare to neglect young master Liang’s call. No matter how anxious he was, he would not dare to reject the call. To put it bluntly, even if his father was dead and he had to go to the funeral soon, he would still have to answer the call first.

Brother Tiger waited outside the door for more than ten minutes before he saw Fang Luo walking out with a happy expression. He must have had a good chat with young master Liang. However, as a subordinate, brother Tiger should not be guessing what benefits young master Liang had offered him.

Brother Tiger was able to gain Fang Luo’s trust. Other than being skilled, his loyalty and loyalty were also extremely important reasons.

He did not say anything more. He made an inviting gesture at Fang Luo and led him to the room next door.

Fang Luo’s eyes were filled with unconcealed desire. After opening the door, he turned around and said,””Even if the sky falls, you’re not allowed to disturb me.”

“Yes, master Luo!”

Fang Luo walked into the room, and brother Hu and the others stood guard outside the door. The bedroom had been specially soundproofed, so even if the wall was smashed from the inside, no sound would be heard from the outside. After all, Fang Luo often spent the night with women here, and he did not have the habit of broadcasting his sexual activities to his subordinates.

Brother Tiger had only stood outside for two to three minutes when the sound of fighting came from the first floor. The screams of the lackeys were heart – wrenching. Brother Tiger ordered a few subordinates to guard the door and then went downstairs to check.

He used to be the king of underground fighting and had never met a worthy opponent in Sanshan city. He did not expect to be severely injured by Xia ruofei after going down and even be crippled by him.

……

When Xia ruofei rushed up to the second floor, there were five burly Men in Black suits standing guard at the door of Fang Luo’s bedroom. When they saw Xia ruofei, they were stunned for a moment before they quickly reacted. Without any hesitation, they pulled out the machetes hidden at their waists and rushed toward Xia ruofei.

Even brother Tiger couldn’t deal with the enemy, so these black – clothed men were naturally very cautious. They took out their weapons and attacked as a group, not daring to take it lightly.

Xia ruofei knew that every second was precious. He didn’t waste any more time. He stomped on the ground and turned into a shadow as he rushed into the crowd of Men in Black.

The knife flashed, but the Men in Black were shocked to find that they could not see Xia ruofei’s figure clearly. Xia ruofei’s thin body moved nimbly among the airtight knife lights. Soon, someone felt a pain in his wrist and let go of his knife. The knife fell to the ground. Then, a strong force hit his chest and abdomen. He flew up involuntarily and slammed heavily into the wall, unconscious.

Punches, kicks, kneecaps, elbows ... Xia ruofei used every part of his body to the extreme. He was originally from the Special Forces and was an expert in grappling in the Army. After being strengthened by the body tempering soup, his strength, speed, and reaction ability had all undergone a complete transformation. It was naturally extremely easy to deal with these knife – wielding big men.

In just three seconds, the machetes fell to the ground and the five Men in Black were lying on the ground. None of them made a sound because they had all fainted from Xia ruofei’s heavy blow.

From the moment Xia ruofei entered the room to the moment he took care of the guards on the second floor, it was only a short two to three minutes.

It could be said that he had already exerted his ability to the extreme.

Ever since he retired from the Army, especially after taking the body tempering soup, this was the first time Xia ruofei had fought with a real weapon. He realized that the fighting skills that he had learned before were now very smooth and flexible. His combat power had definitely increased by several times.

Xia ruofei’s eyes were filled with killing intent, and his entire body was exuding a strong murderous aura. He started to walk toward Fang Luo’s bedroom.

……

Five minutes ago.

After Fang Luo locked the door, his fiery gaze landed on Lu You who was on the bed. Lu You’s face was flushed red, and she was still calling Xia ruofei’s name unconsciously. Her body was twisting gently, and she looked extremely helpless.

Fang Luo’s eyes were turning red, and his breathing was getting heavier. He stuck out his tongue and licked his lips, chuckling.”My beauty, big brother is here ...”

Bang! Bang!

With a loud bang, the specially made heavy door of the bedroom flew up and smashed heavily on the thick carpet, making a dull sound.

Like a cat whose tail had been stepped on, Fang Luo sprang up without any hesitation and pounced toward the bedside table. Fang Luo had always prepared some life – saving measures in places where he often went and stayed, and there was a small and exquisite pistol in the bedside table.

Fang Luo’s first reaction was that his enemies had come. He had been in the underworld for more than ten years, and it could be said that he had countless enemies. Although he was now a famous boss, he would still be attacked several times every year. It was only because of the protection of brother Hu and other subordinates that he was able to escape from danger every time.

He was right beside the bed, less than a meter away from the bedside table. In addition to his quick reaction, he immediately rushed over as soon as he heard the door being kicked open. The whole process took at most one or two seconds.

Fang Luo pulled open the nightstand, and his other hand had already grabbed the pistol whose safety was always off. Just as a crazed look appeared on his face and he was about to turn around and shoot, there was a sudden whistling sound. He felt an intense pain, and he could not help but let out a heart – wrenching scream.

The next moment, Fang Luo was shocked to find that his hand that was holding the gun had been nailed to the drawer of the bedside table by a military dagger that glinted coldly.

The pain caused the muscles on his face to tremble. He raised his head and saw a thin, fair – skinned young man walking in step by step with a murderous look ...
