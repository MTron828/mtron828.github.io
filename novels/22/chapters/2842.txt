Wu Lei could not figure out what had happened that morning. He could not even remember what had happened. Xu Genbao did not explain it clearly, so he was confused.

Wu Lei quickly opened the next few WeChat messages.

The coaches, teammates, and even the national team leaders were basically talking about the same thing.

After reading a few messages, Wu Lei gradually came to his senses.”It seemed that he was on Weibo’s hot search, and it was related to the national flag.

Wu Lei had already registered a Weibo account many years ago, but he didn’t post on Weibo that often. After he came to La Liga, he posted more. He often shared some photos of his training, life, and mood on ins. He also posted the same content on the domestic Weibo platform.

As the country’s number one star, apart from Xia ruofei, who was not a typical professional player, Wu Lei received a lot of attention. Although he did not have as many fans on Weibo as the popular young people, he was not inferior to the first and second – tier stars.

Therefore, every time Wu Lei opened his Weibo, he would receive a bunch of notifications. Some of them tagged him, and some sent him private messages.

However, when he opened Weibo today, he found that there were more messages than usual.

The reason was simple. When Xia ruofei posted the video, he had also circled Wu Lei. After it became the most searched, Xia ruofei’s video was shared by a large number of verified accounts and ordinary netizens. The number of people tagging it was quite impressive.

There were also many people who sent private messages to Wu Lei after watching the video. Naturally, he received more messages from the back end than usual. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Wu Lei didn’t bother to check these back – end news. He directly clicked on the Weibo hot search list.

This time, he was really shocked that the topic #Wu Lei refused to sign on the national flag #was ranked third on the hot search.

At this moment, Wu Lei’s mind finally recalled the scene in the morning.

He thought to himself,”could it be that one of the International students in the morning took a video and posted it on Weibo?” But the speed of the news spreading was too fast! It had only been two to three hours!

In Wu Lei’s memory, he had only refused to sign on the national flag once this morning.

As for the surrounding Spain fans, even if they took a video, they would at most share it on Facebook, Twitter, ins, and other platforms. It was impossible to post it on Weibo.

Furthermore, they didn’t understand Chinese and weren’t Chinese, so how could they understand the flag?

Therefore, there was no doubt that the person who did this must be Chinese.

Wu Lei clicked on the topic with a trace of doubt.

The official Weibo account had taken over the title of the hot search, so Xia ruofei’s post was recommended to the top by the official Weibo account.

Naturally, Wu Lei saw it at a glance.

His eyes widened when he saw that Xia ruofei was the one who posted the first post.

Wu Lei clicked on the video that Xia ruofei had sent and saw that it was indeed about what had happened in the morning. From the angle of the video, it must have been recorded by Xia ruofei.

This was the root of it!

Wu Lei saw the shocking number of reposts and comments on Xia ruofei’s first Weibo post. He could not help but be shocked at Xia ruofei’s influence.

Other than Xia ruofei’s first Weibo post, the official Weibo platform had also recommended the Weibo posts reposted by official big V accounts such as Huaxia daily, national TV news, Tuan Tuan, and the short comments to be displayed at the top, right below Xia ruofei’s Weibo post.

Being praised by others was definitely something to be happy about, not to mention being praised by an official media outlet like Huaxia daily. Wu Lei looked at the comments of these verified accounts with a trace of joy. Then, he clicked on Xia ruofei’s Weibo to look at the comments from the netizens. He was even happier.

If the official media’s overall positive comments were more objective, then the netizens ‘comments were more exaggerated. Wu Lei saw the screen full of praise and felt a little embarrassed.

In his opinion, it was a very small thing, and it was what every Chinese citizen should do. He didn’t expect to receive such high praise from the netizens. He even felt a little ashamed.

At this moment, Wu Lei further realized how great a role model a public figure could have.

At this moment, Xia ruofei had just finished his shower and changed his clothes.

“Lei Zi, What are you looking at?” Xia ruofei walked to Wu Lei’s side and said with a smile,”you’re so engrossed!”

Wu Lei was indeed more focused. He did not even notice Xia ruofei when he was in front of him.

Hearing Xia ruofei’s voice, Wu Lei looked up and stood up immediately.””Brother Xia, you’re done?”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yeah!” What was he so happy about just now? I saw you giggling the moment I stepped out of the door!”

Wu Lei couldn’t help but look at Xia ruofei and said,””Brother Xia, the next time you make such a big move, can you let me know in advance? I’m a little caught off guard by what happened today!”

“What big move did I make?” Xia ruofei asked, confused.

“You don’t know?” Wu Lei retorted.

“You’re so mysterious, how would I know?” Xia ruofei said innocently,”I didn’t do anything today! I came over to train with you guys for half a day!”
