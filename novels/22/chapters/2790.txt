2791 Everyone’s attention (2)

Live streaming technology was very advanced now. Jia Tianning and Shen fangjian didn’t need the director’s reminder. They could see the real – time comments of the netizens on the screen in front of them. The two looked at each other and tacitly ended the topic.

……

At this time, the Camp Nou stadium was almost full. At least 90000 fans had poured into the stadium, which could accommodate 100000 people. They ridiculed the influence of the Cattleya Derby in the stadium, which was no less than the National Derby between Barcelona and real Madrid.

In the away team’s locker room, Ruby was using a passionate tone to boost everyone’s morale.

The tactical arrangements had already been laid out. What he had to do now was to eliminate everyone’s tension.

In fact, there was no need to mobilize the players at all in the game. Each of the players was full of fighting spirit.

Xia ruofei sat next to Wu Lei. His temporary translator, Richard Ruby, was trying to boost the morale of the team. He spoke very fast and his tone was very passionate. With Wu Lei’s current level of Spanish, it was difficult for him to understand.

The singing on the field outside could still be vaguely heard in the locker room. Although the game had not started yet, the bar?a fans had already begun to entertain themselves, especially in the North grandstand behind the northern goal area. This was the area where the bar?a fans gathered, and now they were singing and dancing.

At the front of the stadium, in the podium area, there was a box reserved for the visiting team’s top brass.

At this time, the chairman of the Spanish club, Zhou leiyun, was in this box.

Naturally, Song Wei and Ling Qingxue were also invited by Zhou leiyun to watch the battle.

Other than the three of them, there was a middle – aged Chinese man in a navy blue coat sitting beside Zhou leiyun.

At that moment, the camera happened to be focused on this room. Because Zhou leiyun was the owner of the Spanish team, and there were also two Oriental beauties, Ling Qingxue and Song Wei, in the room, the camera paused for a few seconds.

This scene immediately caught the attention of Shen fangjian and Jia Tianning, who were far away in China’s broadcasting studio. However, the first person they noticed wasn’t song Wei, Ling Qingxue, or Zhou leiyun. It was the middle – aged man in the long woolen coat.

Shen fangjian said in surprise,”we saw the Vice President of the Chinese Football Association, Mr. Zhao Zhenghao, in the box of the nokapu stand!” He’s sitting with the chairman of the Spanish club, Zhou leiyun. This is really an unexpected discovery!”

“We can make a bold guess. Could it be that Vice – President Zhao went to Spain specifically for Xia ruofei?” Jia Tianning said,”a few days ago, the netizens called for the Chinese Football Association to recruit Xia ruofei. The Chinese Football Association also showed a positive attitude, and Xia ruofei himself expressed his willingness to serve the country. It’s just that some details need to be discussed. Today, we saw Vice President Zhao appear in the nokapu stands. Could he have specially gone to Spain to meet Xia ruofei?”

“I think it’s more likely!” Shen fangjian said,”after all, the national team has no match at the moment and we haven’t heard any news of cooperation between the Chinese Football Association and Spain. Vice President Zhao might really be going to Spain for Xia ruofei!”

Shen fangjian sighed,”it seems that we can look forward to Xia ruofei wearing the national team’s uniform!” China’s football needs a hero who can lead us out of adversity! Would Xia ruofei and Wu Lei be the heroes? I think the possibility is very high!”

The fans in the comments section were also excited. Just a scene broadcasted before the game made the fans start to imagine how much the national team’s combat effectiveness would improve after Xia ruofei joined.

A fan listed the changes that Xia ruofei would bring if he joined the national team. Once Xia ruofei joined the national team, he would definitely be the first free kick player. Everyone had seen his performance in the last game. Moreover, in an interview with the media, Wu Lei revealed that Xia ruofei had used an accurate free kick during training and was unrivaled in the Spanish team. Everyone unanimously acknowledged Xia ruofei’s free kick skills.

Other than that, Xia ruofei could also take on the position of a striker. He was fast, had a strong ability to break through with the ball, had good aim when he shot, and had all the qualities of an excellent striker. The attacking midfielder did not seem to have any problems either. Xia ruofei had repeatedly shown that he did not look at anyone passing the ball as if he had eyes in the back of his head. This showed that he had a good vision and a strong sense of the overall situation.

In the end, everyone found that it seemed that he could play any position in the front field, except for his height, which was not particularly prominent and might not be suitable to play as a center forward. He was definitely stronger than the current players in the same position in the national football team.

As a result, the Chinese fans who were watching the game had already collectively become high before the game even started.

There were also fans who greedily said,””It would be great if there were five Xia ruofeis and one Wu Lei. The attacking power of the national football team’s front field would be heaven – defying!”

“Why don’t you just say that you’ll give us 11 Xia ruofeis?” one of the fans teased. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

The fan in front replied seriously,””I don’t think President Xia can be the goalkeeper. Besides, there’s no need to trouble President Xia with the dirty work! Although the national football team’s defense is also very bad, if there are five CEO Xia in the front field, one at the back, and CEO Xia scores two, it will be fine!”

“Hahaha! I feel that the OP’s words make a lot of sense!”

“I can’t even refute that!”

……

Nokapu Stadium.

The referee had already blown the whistle outside the locker room to signal the players to get ready to play.

Ruby finally stopped his spittle – flying speech and patted the shoulders of each starting player one by one.”Young lads! Let’s give Barca a profound lesson! I believe in you!”

With that, he put on his coat and took the lead to leave the locker room and head to the substitutes ‘bench on the sidelines.

Xia ruofei, Wu Lei, and the starting players of Espanyol also walked out of the locker room and headed for the players ‘passageway.

On the other side of the home team’s locker room, Barcelona’s starting players also came out. They would gather at the players ‘passageway and, after a short stop, they would play together under the leadership of the referee team.

Xia ruofei took a look and found that Barcelona had sent their strongest lineup without any suspense, including Messi, zuáres, Busquets, lakitic, cutinho, and so on. Each of them was a famous star player and could be said to be a star. The reputation of the universe team was well – deserved.

In particular, Messi was recognized as one of the two best players on the planet. The other was naturally CRO, but unfortunately, he had transferred to Juventus in Serie A this season.

Because the two teams were arch – enemies in the same city, the players on both sides did not like each other. Everyone did not greet the familiar players of the other team like in other games. Everyone stood in place with cold faces, waiting for the time to play.

In fact, everyone was making a living in LA Liga. There must be players on the two teams who were familiar with each other. Some of them were even teammates on the national team. However, at this time, they would definitely not exchange pleasantries with each other. There were also cameras in the player’s passageway. What happened here could be seen on the big screen of the stadium and on the television broadcast.

Whoever wanted to have an intimate conversation with the opposing players at this time would be drowned by the fans ‘saliva.

After a short wait, the four members of the referee team led the players from both teams out of the passage.

As soon as the starting players of both teams appeared, deafening applause suddenly rang out on the field. This applause was naturally for the home team, Barcelona.

The captains of both sides chose sides, exchanged team flags, and took photos with the referees.

Then, the starting lineups of the two teams were also taken together. Everyone returned to their respective positions, stretching their bodies while waiting for the referee to blow the opening whistle.

Xia ruofei’s position was behind the center, iglesias, and on both sides of him. On the left was No. 23 Granello, and on the right was No. 24, Wu Lei.

Wu Lei and Iglesia stood in front of the ball and looked at the first half, which was kicked off by Spain.

Wu Lei turned to look at Xia ruofei and saw that Xia ruofei had made a hidden hand gesture, indicating that he should pass the ball to him.

Wu Lei immediately nodded slightly to show that he understood.

At this time, the referee pressed the timer on his watch and blew the whistle to start the game.

The explosive Derby in Catalonia had officially begun!

Iglasias jabbed the ball and passed it to Wu Lei, then ran to the front field.

Wu Lei, on the other hand, did not hesitate at all. He used his foot bow to push the ball to Xia ruofei, who was not far behind him. Then, he followed Xia ruofei’s instructions before the game and rushed to the backfield of bar?a in big strides ...
