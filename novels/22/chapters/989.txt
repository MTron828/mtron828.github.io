When song Qiming and his wife saw Xia ruofei’s expression, they were already half relieved. When they heard Xia ruofei’s words, they heaved a long sigh of relief.

Xia ruofei smiled.”She’s doing very well. The poison in her body has been reduced by a lot. It seems like the first course of treatment was right!”

“Ruofei, your diagnosis is the same as the blood test results in Room 301!” The next treatment ...”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Aunty Fang, I’ve prepared the medicine for the next course of treatment. You can take it back later. Just take it according to the first course of treatment!”

Song Qiming laughed happily.”It seems that RUO Fei has already prepared for this! Otherwise, why would he have prepared the medicine in advance?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”confidence is one thing, but you still have to personally check it before you have the confidence!” Doctors had to be responsible for their patients! Moreover, Song Wei is the apple of your eye ...”

Song Wei blushed and said,””Ruofei, thank you so much for this!”

Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand.”You’re welcome. We’re all on the same side.”

Ling Qingxue, who was brewing tea, could not help but steal a glance at Xia ruofei. She thought to herself,”this guy always smiles when he sees a beautiful woman. His service attitude is so good. Could he be interested in Secretary song’s daughter?”

However, Ling Qingxue quickly realized that she was overthinking things. What kind of status did Secretary song have? Besides, their family already knew that Xia ruofei and she were a couple. Under such circumstances, how could Xia ruofei have any ideas about Song Wei?

Even though Ling Qingxue’s mind was running wild, her hands were still moving. Very quickly, a strong aroma of tea filled the room.

“Secretary song, Madam song, please have some tea!” Ling Qingxue placed the teacups in front of the two of them with a smile.

“Thank you!” Song Qiming and Fang Liyun knew that Ling Qingxue was Xia ruofei’s girlfriend, so they were very kind to her.

On the other hand, Song Wei did not wait for Ling Qingxue to get up. She took the initiative to bring a cup of tea over and said with a smile,””I’ll get it myself. Thank you, sister Qingxue!”

Song Qiming sniffed the fragrance of the tea and took a sip. He looked intoxicated. After a while, he praised,””Good tea! Miss Ling, I didn’t expect to be able to taste such good Da Hong Pao here ...”

“Secretary song, RUO Fei gave these tea leaves to my father,” Ling Qingxue said with a smile.

Song Qiming laughed and said,”so it’s RUO Fei’s gift to his father – in – Law!” Then he would definitely have to use the best tea leaves ... Eh? RUO Fei, why do I feel that the taste of this tea is a little familiar?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Secretary song, did you drink at elder song’s place?” I’ve also sent some of these tea leaves to the old chief. ”

Song Qiming immediately said,”now that you mention it, I remember it. It’s true!” I asked the old chief for some of these tea leaves, but he refused to give it to me!”

“If Secretary song likes it, I’ll send some over later,” Xia ruofei laughed.

“Then I’ll thank you in advance!” Song Qiming was overjoyed.

Fang Liyun looked at her husband in disdain and said,””Old song, we haven’t even thanked RUO Fei for treating Weiwei’s illness! Why are you still asking him for tea leaves!”

Song Qiming put on an innocent expression and said,””I didn’t ask for it from RUO Fei! He was the one who gave it to me ...”

Fang Liyun rolled her eyes at song Qiming.”Since you’ve already said that, can they not give it to you?”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.”Auntie Fang, it’s nothing ... These tea leaves were grown at home, so they’re not worth much.”

Ling Qingxue’s eyes lit up as she watched from the side. She could tell that Xia ruofei was very close to song Qiming’s family. Song Qiming did not put on any airs in front of Xia ruofei. He spoke to Xia ruofei as an equal.

Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but feel proud of herself.

Just as everyone was chatting happily, Ling Xiaotian had also put on his white chef’s uniform and was personally busy in the kitchen.

Tian Mingyi and the others still wanted to beg Ling Xiaotian for mercy, but Ling Xiaotian called for the security guards to rudely chase them out of the kitchen. Right now, Ling ran’s first priority was to prepare the next few dishes. He had long since loathed this group of people who used public tools for their own purposes and were unscrupulous to the extreme, so how could he be nice to them?

Ling Xiaotian was personally busy in the kitchen, and the restaurant’s chef, who was also his direct disciple, was assisting by the side.

Soon, a few dishes with the characteristics of the three mountains were cooked.

Lychee meat, stir – fried double crisps, clam soup, tofu, pork trotters with Taro ...

The traditional three mountain cuisines tended to be sweet. Considering that song Qiming’s family lived in the southwest region all year round, Ling Xiaotian thought that their taste might be a little spicier. Thus, he personally led the chef of Ling Ji private kitchen to make several traditional Sichuan cuisines such as fish with pickled vegetables and duck’s blood.

When Ling Xiaotian personally led the service staff to the flying Snow Pavilion with the food cart, they could hear the sound of laughter coming from inside. Ling Qingxue’s voice could be heard as well. They must be having a good chat! Ling Xiaotian was also extremely happy.

He knocked on the door and brought the waiter into the room. He smiled and said,””Secretary song, sorry to keep you waiting ...”

Song Qiming stood up personally and said with a gentle smile,””President Ling, thank you for your hard work! Come and sit down!”
