Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”very good. Thank you for your hard work.” Xia Qing, you have to take care of the two mu of land in the mountain sea realm as well. I hope that in a few months, we will be able to harvest a large amount of this grade of Cordyceps!”

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing said immediately.

Xia ruofei planned to contact Director Lin of Tongren Hall in the next two days and ask him to estimate the price of the worms. However, he had to go to song Qiming’s house to treat Song Wei the next day, so he decided to put this matter aside for the time being.

Xia ruofei asked Xia Qing to keep the 500 grams of worm grass first. He thought for a while and asked,””By the way, Xia Qing, help me make a batch of medicinal pills with the petals of the spirit Heart Flower!”

“Okay, master. Are there any other requirements besides the petals of the spirit Heart Flower?” Xia Qing asked.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”the main ingredients are the petal solution of the spirit Heart Flower and honey. Also, we can find a few of the Chinese medicines that are nourishing to a girl’s body. We can add them together.”

Xia ruofei prepared a batch of pills for Song Wei.

He considered that he used the same medicinal soup every time he treated people, and it was inevitable that some speculations would arise if he used it more often. So, he decided to change the form of pills this time.

Of course, it was actually a different soup and not a different medicine. The active ingredient was still the petals of the spirit Heart Flower.

“I understand, master,” Xia Qing said immediately.”How many do you need?”

Xia ruofei thought for a moment and said,”you can use two Spirit Heart Flower petals!” As for the rest of the honey and Chinese medicine, you can decide the ratio. In the end, you just need to make about 50 pills. ”

“Yes, master, I’ll start now!” Xia Qing said.

Xia ruofei nodded. He walked around the medium and left.

……

The next morning, Xia ruofei asked Lei Hu to prepare the company’s Mercedes – Benz in advance. He drove away from Taoyuan farm at around nineo’ clock.

He mainly considered the fact that he was going to the villa area of the municipal Committee. The Knight XV was too ostentatious, and the pickup truck was obviously not suitable, so he chose the Mercedes – Benz, which looked more stable.

Just as Xia ruofei’s Mercedes – Benz left Taoyuan farm, a black Audi A8 slowly drove out of the municipal council compound and headed towards the villa of the municipal council Standing Committee by the crescent Lake three kilometers away.

Song Qiming was supposed to go to Changping County for research this morning. However, he had an appointment with Xia ruofei to treat his daughter Song Wei at home today, so he postponed the trip and had a heart – to – Heart talk with the team members in the office.

Song Qiming ended the conversation at around 9:30 am and returned to the villa with his Secretary, Guangzhi Cao.

The car drove steadily towards the villa area. Song Qiming’s driver, old Zhang, was a Secretary he had brought over from the southwest. According to the rules, the Secretary could not be transferred with the leader, but the driver was an employee establishment. Moreover, the driver that the leader was used to would always be by his side.

Old Zhang was also a retired motorized infantry soldier. His driving skills were very solid. In addition, he came from Cangzhou, the hometown of martial arts. He had been practicing martial arts since he was young, so he could also work as song Qiming’s bodyguard. Song Qiming also regarded him highly.

In contrast, Guangzhi Cao, who was sitting in the front passenger seat, was a little excited and nervous.

It was not his first time going to song Qiming’s Villa. Ever since he was selected and transferred to be song Qiming’s Secretary, he had to send song Qiming home every day. On the day song Qiming’s wife and daughter came to San Shan, he had to go to the airport with them to pick them up. Also, that was the first time he had dinner at song Qiming’s house.

However, Guangzhi Cao was still nervous. He knew that Secretary song had come home for a private matter. Song Qiming still brought him along, which meant that the Secretary was gradually treating him as one of his own.

Perhaps it was because of what Xia ruofei had said on the phone yesterday, but Guangzhi Cao subconsciously felt that it had something to do with Xia ruofei, so he felt a little more grateful to Xia ruofei.

The villa area of the municipal Standing Committee was located by the crescent Lake, not far from the municipal compound. The car quickly drove into the villa area and slowly drove to the entrance of villa number one.

In fact, due to the urgency of the transfer order, and the fact that Tian Huilan had gone to the capital to take up her post without staying in San Shan, the villa she lived in had not been vacated in time.

The administrative Bureau had temporarily tidied up a vacant villa that was of the same specifications as Tian Huilan’s Villa. They had added furniture and appliances for song Qiming’s use.

However, song Qiming was now the Secretary, so the villa he was living in was naturally villa number one.

Guangzhi Cao put his thoughts aside and quickly got out of the car to open the door for song Qiming.

After song Qiming got out of the car, Guangzhi Cao followed him with his briefcase. Zhang, the driver, didn’t get out of the car. He parked the car in the parking lot and waited.

When they heard the sound of the car, the housekeeping staff arranged by the organization, Xiao Luo, had already opened the door. As soon as song Qiming entered, she immediately handed him a pair of slippers.

Song Qiming brought Guangzhi Cao into the house. A curvaceous and graceful woman was sitting on the sofa in the living room. Song Qiming asked as soon as he entered,””Liyun, where’s Wei Wei?”

The woman was song Qiming’s wife, Fang Liyun. She said,””He’s in the room upstairs!”
