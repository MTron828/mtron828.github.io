Chapter 1187: Feng Jing’s surprise (1)

Translator: 549690339

After saying that, Duff left the stage. Her words caused a heated discussion both online and offline. The entire venue buzzed with disbelief.

As an international a – list celebrity, Duff’s status was very high. She had taken time off from the production team to shoot a promotional video for paradise Corporation and had even taken leave from the production team to come to the press conference stage. For a big star, this was already a lot of energy.

And all of this was free, which was even more unbelievable.

Could it be that this jaded skin cream was really that good? He could actually get a celebrity of Duff’s status to endorse for free?

In fact, Duff was only talking about the fact that it was free of charge. She was a little cunning and deliberately didn’t say that the reason was that the boss of paradise Corporation was friends with her boss. This was to deliberately lead everyone to misunderstand.

Just as everyone was in a heated discussion, Feng Jing didn’t want to give them any time to rest. She had all her big news waiting for the finale!

After Duff left the stage, Feng Jing immediately smiled and said,””Our jaded skin cream is in the final stage of development. We’ve invited many people to try it out. I’d like to invite everyone to listen to what they have to say through a short video!”

After speaking, Feng Jing pressed the PowerPoint on the remote control, and the big screen started playing the video.

When Feng Jing walked to the side of the stage, she winked at Xia ruofei with a smile.

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment. At this time, the big screen had already started playing the video. The first person to come out was Tang Yitian’s wife, Jennifer.

Holding a trial bottle of jaded skin cream in her hand, Jennifer had a charming smile on her face as she said to the camera,””The jaded skin cream is the most magical skin care product I’ve ever used, there’s no other! The wonders of Chinese medicine have really opened my eyes ...”

Looking at Jennifer, who was praising the jaded skin cream on the screen, Xia ruofei was a little dazed. He really did not know that Feng Jing had arranged such a segment.

And Jennifer’s appearance almost made the online and offline audience boil with excitement.

Compared to Duff, the Starlight on Jennifer’s Body was obviously more dazzling, or perhaps the two were not on the same level at all.

Although Jennifer had faded out of the entertainment industry, her dazzling past had never disappeared. The trophies she won were like monuments and she had become a legend in the entertainment industry.

Moreover, she had not completely left the entertainment industry. She just stopped performing specific acting activities. The entertainment company she was in charge of was well – known around the world.

So, one could imagine Jennifer’s influence. She had countless fans in China, and even Lin Qiao, who used to live in a small fishing village, was her admirer.

What was commendable was that Jennifer spoke Chinese throughout the entire process. Although she still had a hint of a foreigner’s unique accent, it was already quite standard.

As always, she liked to use idioms. She used three or four idioms in a short speech, but fortunately, they were all quite appropriate.

The moment Jennifer appeared on the bullet screen website, all the bullet screens paused for a moment, but that was because everyone was so surprised that they had completely forgotten to type. So when the netizens came back to their senses, the bullet screen gushed out even more crazily.

“My God! The goddess Jennifer!”

“This company is too awesome! It was too awesome! He’s so, so, so awesome ...”

“Jennifer is at the platform! I’ll buy this product even if it’s just a pile of dog shit!”

“The one who said dog shit really has a weird taste! But I can tell that they must be Jennifer’s true fans!”

“The goddess is still as elegant as before! It’s even more flavorful now ...”

“I can’t take it anymore, I can’t take it anymore. My heart can’t take it anymore when I see the goddess!”

“Am I the only one who noticed that the goddess Jennifer was speaking Chinese?”

“The village’s network is connected! Jennifer’s husband was a Chinese. The news had reported that her Chinese was very good! But I’ve seen it for myself today. It’s really quite standard!”

“I think Jennifer is so cute when she speaks Chinese!”

......

The audience could not help but discuss among themselves. There was a burst of buzzing in the venue, and even what Jennifer said in the video could not be heard clearly. Fortunately, the video was accompanied by subtitles.

After Jennifer finished her words of praise, the image flashed and another person appeared.

The audience and netizens didn’t even have time to let out a long sigh before their attention was immediately attracted by the person in the video.

It was another a – list international actress, Angela. Graff.

After Angela, it was Natalie’s turn to be the winner of the Cannes Best Actress Award.

Then, Catherine, Juliana, Helena ... FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

One by one, they appeared. They were all internationally famous female stars and models. Everyone was almost numb to it. Many people even thought that they were dreaming because this was simply too unbelievable.

With so many international a – listers supporting a new product from an unknown company in China, it was completely beyond everyone’s imagination. This world was too crazy!

Even Liu Dong and the other e – commerce bigshots were shocked by Feng Jing’s arrangement.

Liu Dong’s jaw dropped as he watched the International female stars appear one after another on the screen. His face was filled with shock.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but look at Feng Jing.
