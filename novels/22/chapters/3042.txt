3043 Returning to peach source Island (1)

Translator: 5496903Li Yifu heard Xia ruofei’s voice and his tensed muscles immediately relaxed.

He looked at the black flying boat that was more than 20 meters long in front of him, and he was still a little dazed.

At this moment, Xia ruofei’s figure appeared on the deck of the swift Boat. He jumped down lightly.

Immediately after, under Li Yifu’s shocked gaze, the black flying ship rapidly shrank like a magic trick. In the blink of an eye, it was only an inch long.

Xia ruofei waved his hand and took the floating flying boat, then stored it in the spirit map space.

He laughed and said,”foster husband, stop looking. This isn’t some future technology. It’s a product of the cultivation world!” This is a flying magic weapon made by an expert of the ancient cultivation world!”

Li Yifu’s face was filled with disbelief as he said,””Flying Dharma Treasures are so high – tech! Senior granduncle, I thought it was an alien invasion!”

This black flying boat did not match the aerodynamic shape of an aircraft at all. It did not have wings, but it could easily float in the air and fly at such a high speed. It was indeed like a UFO. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”that’s why you shouldn’t look down on cultivators. They don’t just focus on cultivation and make their bodies very strong. There were many masters in the ancient cultivation world who had great achievements in refining weapons. Besides, you’ve seen the arrays in the cultivation world. In fact, these things are not inferior to the technology in the secular world!”

“Yes, yes, yes!” Li Yifu nodded and said,”Grand – martial uncle, I’ve heard about the ancient cultivation world several times during the auction that day. Many of the auction items were excavated from the ruins of ancient cultivators. Could it be that ... You bought this flying magic weapon at the auction after I left that day? That’s going to cost a lot of spirit stones, right?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it’s a long story. I’ll tell you later!” In short, I didn’t spend much spirit stones, so it’s basically a free gift!”

“How is this possible?” Li Yifu couldn’t help but be dumbfounded.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”anyway, we’ve gained a lot from this auction.” Let’s go! Let’s go downstairs first. ”

Li Yifu then realized that they were still standing on the rooftop. This was obviously not a suitable place to talk. He quickly stepped aside and let Xia ruofei walk in front. Then, the two of them walked to the exit of the rooftop one after another.

The two of them returned to the large suite on the top floor of the Yanhuang building that was specially reserved for Xia ruofei.

Li Yifu swiftly made a cup of tea for Xia ruofei and asked,””Martial granduncle, after this disciple left that day, did anything dangerous happen? This disciple was very worried about you along the way. If there was really an accident, this disciple would have become a deserter! If that’s the case, I’m afraid that even in the netherworld, my father will still teach him a lesson!”

After Xia ruofei arrived at the star Seizer sect, he contacted Li Yifu briefly to let him know that they were safe.

Therefore, Li Yifu didn’t understand the specific situation.

Xia ruofei laughed.”There was no danger. After the auction, Chen Xuan from the first heaven society was the one who auctioned the ore. He used a flying spiritual treasure to send Qingfeng and I back to the star Seizer sect. No one dared to do anything on the way.”

Li Yifu let out a sigh of relief and said,””That’s good! That’s good! By the way, the flying magic weapon that martial granduncle was talking about, could it be the one just now ...”

“The first heaven society also has a Swift Boat called the blue water Swift Boat. It’s different from the one I’m using.” Xia ruofei said,”to be exact, I didn’t even get this flying boat when the auction ended!”

Xia ruofei saw Li Yifu’s confused look and simply told him what had happened after Li Yifu left the auction.

Of course, he was also selective.

For example, this black flying boat. Xia ruofei only said that he found a nested space hidden in the storage ring that he had won. Then, he found a way to open this space and obtained a batch of cultivation resources, which included this flying boat.

However, Xia ruofei didn’t mention anything about the spiritual body of scholar Yuntai.

After all, a living ancient cultivator was of great significance to the current cultivation world. If they could have the help of a real ancient cultivator during the exploration of ancient ruins, it would be much more efficient and safer.

Li Yifu didn’t care about the information about master Yuntai. If Xia ruofei told him, no matter how loyal he was, there was still a possibility that he would leak the information. In that case, Xia ruofei might as well not tell him.

Xia ruofei did not tell Li Yifu about his research on the mysterious ore or how he had been trapped in the space of the ore for more than a thousand years.

Even so, after Li Yifu heard Xia ruofei’s story, his eyes were filled with splendor. He didn’t expect that he would miss so many interesting things by leaving early.

Besides, Xia ruofei had obtained so many cultivation resources. He was genuinely happy for Xia ruofei.

After Xia ruofei finished, he asked,””My foster husband, is everything alright on peach source Island? Have there been any unusual situations these days?”

Paradise Island was Xia ruofei’s future base. For a long time, it would be his most important base camp. Therefore, he placed great importance on the safety of Paradise Island.
