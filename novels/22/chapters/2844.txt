2845 Late arrival (1)

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue also participated in this small event with Xia ruofei. However, they did not know much about football and did not care much about Chinese football, so they did not have as many feelings as Xia ruofei.

Everyone arrived at the parking lot of the Dani Lake Training base. When Wu Lei found out that Xia ruofei and the other two had walked over, he suggested that he send them back to the hotel first.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and did not reject Wu Lei’s good intentions. He nodded in agreement.

After all, they treated it as a walk after eating in the morning. It was close to noon now, and the sun in Spain was very bright all year round. Moreover, the three of them were a little hungry. If they could take a car, they might as well.

Wu Lei’s translator and driver, Wu Junfeng, was still driving. Wu Lei sat in the front passenger seat while Xia ruofei and the other two squeezed into the back row.

Wu Lei’s car was just an ordinary family car, and it was a gift from Skoda, the club’s sponsor, after the transfer. The back seat was not particularly spacious, but there was enough space for Xia ruofei and the other two. Moreover, it was not long from the training base to the hotel, so they arrived in a short while.

After sending Xia ruofei and the other two to the hotel, Wu Lei went straight home. He had rented a house nearby. His wife and children had come to keep him company.

Xia ruofei brought Song Wei and Ling Qingxue to the hotel’s restaurant for lunch. Zhou leiyun had to attend a business event today and did not come to accompany them.

After the meal, everyone went back to their rooms to rest. Xia ruofei turned on his computer to browse the news and found that Barcelona still had not responded. He was really patient! Let’s see how long you can last then.

In fact, the storm of public opinion was still going on this morning, and the condemnation of The Sports Daily and Pablo was getting louder and louder. However, The Sports Daily had already set its tone and would naturally not say anything at this time. They would hold on to their attitude and wait for the storm of public opinion to subside. Pablo had already lost his job and was being scolded so badly by netizens, so he would not have the mood to say anything.

To the netizens ‘surprise, the two clubs involved in this storm did not make any statements. It was reasonable that bar?a did not want to respond to the negative news of the fountain. As the “victim,” the Spanish club had already occupied the moral high ground. Shouldn’t they come out and complain about their grievances? There was no movement at all. The netizens could not understand.

Xia ruofei looked at the domestic Weibo, forums, and Tieba. He realized that what happened in Spain had already spread to the country. Everyone was furious at the daily sports news’s statement. As for Pablo’s resignation, it made the Chinese netizens feel indignant. They felt that such a scum should be completely cleaned out of the news industry and not just resign.

Of course, Xia ruofei’s main focus was still on the Spain media. It had only been a morning and he had not seen any news that particularly interested him. He could not help but feel bored.

He stood up and went straight to the bedroom, ready to lie down and sleep for a while.

When Xia ruofei was in the Army, he had trained himself to be able to fall asleep anytime and anywhere. Soon, he began to snore softly.

At three in the afternoon, the phone on the bedside table vibrated. Xia ruofei opened his eyes and woke up.

He raised his hand to look at his watch, then reached out for his phone.

The call was from Zhou leiyun. Xia ruofei swiped his phone and answered the call.

“General manager Zhou.” Xia ruofei asked,”you’re done?”

“It’s just a business meeting. I’ll be back after lunch. ” Zhou leiyun said,”director Xia, there’s a piece of news that you’ll definitely be interested in. Barcelona has made a statement!”

“Oh?” Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows and asked,”I thought they were going to keep pretending! What did the statement say? Forget it, I’ll go and take a look myself!”

“Yes, yes, yes. It’s more intuitive if you see it for yourself.” Zhou leiyun said,”I don’t know Spanish either. All I know is what my assistant told me.”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei got off the bed and asked as he put on his slippers,”where’s that Mayers? Is there any news?”

“It seems that the media has also dug out information about him.” Zhou leiyun said,”I heard that this person is indeed an annual ticket member of Barcelona. He is also a die – hard fan and the backbone of the Barcelona fan organization. It was because of this news that bar?a could not withstand the pressure and quickly drafted a statement. ”

Xia ruofei nodded.”If that’s the case, then our club should hold a press conference. But let me see how things go first.” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Alright! I’ll let them prepare first!” Zhou leiyun said,”don’t inform the media yet. We’ll wait for you. Be careful.”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said,”then we’ll talk about it later!”

He had already come to the computer. He had not turned off the computer after watching the news at Noon, so he opened the browser directly and found the official website of Barcelona to have a look. Sure enough, he saw the statement.

The official website of Barcelona did not put the statement in a particularly eye – catching position, so it was naturally impossible for it to be the headline. They only hung the statement on the fourth post on the right side of the important news area. It was not very eye – catching, but Xia ruofei still noticed it at a glance and immediately clicked on it.
