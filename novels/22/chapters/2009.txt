2010 Checks and balances_2

Alright, tell him to come over tonight! Xia ruofei said,I’ll send you an email later. Check it!

Yes, martial granduncle! Li Yifu quickly said.

After Xia ruofei hung up, he opened Google Maps on his phone and turned to Monica.Monica, we need to wait here for an hour or two. I’ve asked a friend to come over, and I hope they can help!

Thank you, Mr. Xia! Monica said hurriedly.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,you and Rousey should rest at the back. This place is still very safe for the time being!

Alright!

Xia ruofei lowered his head and continued to work on his phone. He sent all the information about the location of the map, the identity he used in Turin, and the photos of his current appearance to Li Yifu.

Xia ruofei even emphasized in the email that he must not reveal his identity.

Li Yifu had been guarding his email after Xia ruofei’s call. As soon as he received Xia ruofei’s message, Li Yifu immediately replied,Grand uncle – Master, received! Don’t worry, your disciple will arrange everything!

Li Yifu also attached a photo of lui hai in the email, so that they could confirm his identity when they met.

The next thing Xia ruofei needed to do was wait. He leaned back in the driver’s seat and closed his eyes to rest. At this moment, Rousey, who was sitting in the back, suddenly asked in English,Mr. Xia, is the Hong sect a powerful organization Are they more powerful than the Mafia

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment. He turned to Luo Si and asked,You can understand Chinese

Rousey smiled shyly and said,I grew up in a wheelchair. I’m not like other children who have a happy childhood. So, reading has become my biggest hobby. I learned Chinese by myself, but this language is too difficult. I’ve been learning it for so long, but I only know a little.

At this point, Rousey stuttered in Chinese and said,In your words, I’ve only learned a little ...

Xia ruofei smiled.Not bad. Your pronunciation is quite accurate!

Although he acted as if nothing had happened, he was actually glad that he didn’t reveal his personal information when he called just now. Other than the Hong sect, there was nothing else sensitive. Otherwise, his hidden identity would have been exposed in a minute.

In fact, Xia ruofei was cautious out of habit. After all, there was a possibility of eavesdropping on such a wireless call. Moreover, Li Yifu was also a cultivator, so he should be familiar with the disguises of cultivators. After he received Xia ruofei’s email, he naturally understood what Xia ruofei meant. There was no need for him to make it clear over the phone or in the email.

He did not expect his habitual caution to help him avoid a problem. If Monica found out that he was Xia ruofei, he would not know how to explain himself.

Xia ruofei also reminded him to avoid Rousey when they talked with each other when lui hai arrived.

Monica smiled and said,Mr. Xia, Rossi is very talented in languages. He has mastered at least five languages by self – study. In addition to Italian, he is very good in English, German, French, and Portuguese. He can also understand some of your Chinese.

Amazing, amazing! Xia ruofei gave Rousey a big thumbs up.

Rousey smiled shyly and explained,Mr. Xia, I didn’t mean to eavesdrop on your phone call. It’s just that it’s rare to hear such fluent Chinese, so I couldn’t help but listen ...

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,it’s okay. It’s nothing to be ashamed of. By the way, the Hong sect that you just heard about, it’s an organization of us overseas Chinese, they’re very powerful, even the Mafia don’t dare to go against them. I’m contacting them in hopes that they can help you and your sister survive this crisis!

Mr. Xia, Monica said, very touched.I don’t know what to say ... I’m really grateful!

Xia ruofei smiled and said,you’re welcome. I’ve said it before. I believe in fate. You have a Chinese friend with the surname Xia. This is our fate. So, I’ll do my best to help you within my ability!

Monica nodded her head heavily. She was also very glad in her heart. She said to herself,Xia, I didn’t expect to get such great help from your fellow countrymen just by mentioning your name. It’s the greatest fortune in my life to know you!

Monica and Rousey were a little tired. The siblings were resting quietly in the back seat. Xia ruofei was also resting in his seat with his eyes closed.

Time passed by.

Xia ruofei suddenly opened his eyes and turned around.Monica, Rousey, stay in the car and don’t move. I’ll go down and take a look!

What happened Monica quickly asked.

I heard the sound of a car, but I’m not sure if it’s my friend. Xia ruofei said,to ensure safety, I need to confirm first!

The sound of a car Did you hear the sound of the car Monica looked at her brother and asked.

Rousey also shook his head in confusion. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Little did they know that Xia ruofei’s hearing was much sharper than theirs. He had already noticed the car when it was still very far away. Monica and Monica would have to wait at least one or two minutes to hear the engine sound.
