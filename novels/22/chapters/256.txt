Chapter 257: A hundred – year – old ginseng (1)

Xia ruofei was thinking about the wild ginseng in the medium. Ginseng was hermaphrodite. In the natural world, wild ginseng seeds were planted by birds and beasts. After birds and beasts ate ginseng seeds, because the ginseng seeds had a relatively hard shell, they were not easy to digest. Therefore, they would be excreted by the bird and beast’s feces. The relatively high temperature in the bird beast’s body would have a catalytic effect on the growth of the seed, so if the fruit fell in the right place, it would grow new teeth, and finally achieve the reproduction of ginseng. The environment in the spirit map space was blessed by the heavens with rich spirit Qi supporting it. Therefore, after these ginseng seeds fell off automatically, most of them would germinate and survive next to the mother plant. Now, the land where he had planted the ginseng was already densely covered with ginseng, and the ginseng that had been planted in the beginning had already grown very big. The last time Xia ruofei dug one out and gave it to elder song, even song Zhengping and song Zhilan, the descendants of the wealthy families, were shocked. It was obvious how precious it was. If Xia ruofei wanted to buy jades to complete this incomplete upgrade, he would have to prepare at least a few million Yuan worth of jades. Otherwise, he might not even have enough. After thinking about it, only this ginseng could be exchanged for so much money in such a short time. Hence, Xia ruofei randomly picked two ginseng and carefully dug them out. These two ginsengs were slightly bigger than the one he had given to elder song a few days ago. By industry standards, they were at least a hundred years old, and each could be sold for at least two million! Xia ruofei skillfully processed the ginseng, packed it in a paper box, and placed it in the medium. This time, he didn’t plan to go to the Tongren Hall in the San Shan city to sell it again. After all, he had already sold three sticks in one go. If he brought out two more old and better – looking wild mountain ginseng this time, it would inevitably attract the attention of people with ulterior motives. As for the other pharmacies in the city, Xia ruofei was not sure. After all, they did not have the century – old Foundation of Tongren Hall. He was not sure if they had the ability to buy two hundred – year – old ginsengs at one time and whether they could afford the ideal price in his mind. Hence, Xia ruofei decided not to sell the two wild ginsengs in Sanshan city. Elder song’s Chinese medicine had just been taken away today, and the next time would be three days later when Xu Wu would bring people to Tao Yuan farm to get it. Hence, Xia ruofei had plenty of time. He searched on the internet and quickly chose a place that was adjacent to the southeast province, the capital of Jiangsu and Zhejiang Province, Qiantang city. It only took about an hour to fly from Sanshan to Qiantang city, and there were many flights, so there was no problem even for a day round trip. Xia ruofei immediately booked a return ticket online. Considering that he had plenty of time, he booked the return ticket for the next day. At the same time, he searched on the map and found a five – Star hotel near the largest Tongren Tang pharmacy in Qiantang city. He booked a single room. Today’s flight to Qiantang city was at around oneo’ clock in the afternoon. After Xia ruofei had lunch in the villa, he informed ye Lingyun and pang Hao and drove the pickup truck straight to Changping International Airport. Xia ruofei arrived at Qiantang city a little after twoo’ clock. He didn’t bring much luggage with him, just a small travel bag with two paper boxes for wild ginseng, so he took a taxi at the airport and went straight to Tongren Tang pharmacy. The Tongren Tang branch in Qiantang city was bigger than the one in Sanshan city. The moment Xia ruofei entered, a shop assistant came over to ask about it. “Sir, do you need medical treatment or medicine?” The sales assistant revealed a professional smile and asked,”our Tongren Hall also has experienced Chinese medicine practitioners.” Xia ruofei looked around and said,””I have two old mountain ginsengs for sale. Do you accept wild ones?” The shop assistant was stunned for a moment before quickly saying,””If it’s old enough, good quality, and we’ve verified that it’s a wild old ginseng, we, Tongren Hall, will buy it!” “The ginseng is definitely not a problem.” Xia ruofei smiled confidently and said,”get someone to appraise it!” “Okay, please wait here for a moment, Sir.” The shop assistant nodded. Then, the shop assistant led Xia ruofei to a counter and quickly found an old Chinese doctor in a white coat. “Dr. Huang, this is the gentleman who said that he has wild ginseng for sale.” The sales assistant said respectfully. The old Chinese doctor was about 70 years old. His hair was all white and he was wearing a pair of reading glasses. He adjusted his glasses and sized Xia ruofei up.””Young man, we don’t accept ordinary ginseng here. It must be wild ginseng that is more than 20 years old.” Xia ruofei smiled and took out a paper box from his travel bag. He placed it on the counter and gently pushed it in front of Dr. Huang.”Please take a look first! If you don’t accept it, I’ll go ask someone else. ” Dr. Huang was stunned when she saw Xia ruofei take out such a long paper box. Was there a need for such a large paper box to store a wild ginseng? It was no wonder that Dr. Huang was so suspicious. Normally, wild ginseng wasn’t that big. Even a chopstick – sized authentic wild ginseng could be sold at a high price. Dr. Huang opened the box with a puzzled look. When he saw the thick wild ginseng, his pupils shrank and he took a deep breath. His breathing became rapid. He quickly bent down to examine it carefully. He carefully picked up the wild ginseng and examined it over and over again. Finally, he even took out a magnifying glass from his pocket to observe some details. Finally, Dr. Huang gently put the wild ginseng into the paper box and said to herself in a trembling voice,””The five forms and six bodies are perfect, and it’s definitely a wild ginseng that’s more than a hundred years old ... It’s so rare!” Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”Sir, do you accept this wild ginseng?” “Yes, yes, yes, yes!” Dr. Huang quickly said. If you don’t even accept this kind of top – grade ginseng, what other wild ginseng is worth collecting?” Xia ruofei had already expected Dr. Huang’s reaction. He gently closed the box and asked,””Then state your price! If the price is right, I’ll sell it to you ...” “This wild ginseng is too precious. I’ll have to ask the general manager. Young man, please wait a moment ...” Dr. Huang said after a moment of silence. After that, Dr. Huang quickly left the counter. Her steps were so vigorous that she didn’t look like a 70 – year – old man at all. Soon, a middle – aged man in a suit and leather shoes walked over with Dr. Huang. He extended his hand to Xia ruofei from afar and said,””Hello, Sir. I’m the General Manager of the Qiantang branch of Tongren Hall. My surname is Lin.” Xia ruofei shook his hand and said,””Nice to meet you, President Lin.” CEO Lin briefly examined the wild ginseng. Dr. Huang must have already reported to him, so he quickly said,””Sir, we are willing to buy this wild ginseng for 2.1 million Yuan. Are you satisfied with this price?”Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om
