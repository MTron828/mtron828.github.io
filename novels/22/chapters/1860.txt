Chapter 1861: Reaching an agreement (1)

Translator: 549690339

At around eighto’ clock in the evening, Xia ruofei and Wu Liqian, who were having a good conversation, walked out of the private room in the backyard. The driver, Xie Bing, had already driven the car to the back door of Ling’s private kitchen through a special passage in advance. No vehicles were allowed to pass through the front door.

Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”sister Qian, I’ll send you off first!” Where are you going?”

“Back to Changping!” Wu Liqian said without hesitation.

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment and said,”you’re going back to the county so late?” I thought you were staying in the city tonight. ”

Xia ruofei knew that Wu Liqian had a house in the city. He had heard Wu Liqian say that she had asked the driver to go back first, so he naturally thought that Wu Liqian would not be going back to Changping County tonight.

Wu Liqian ran her fingers through her hair and said with a smile,””I was going to stay in the city for a night, but with such a big satellite, how can I sleep at home? Let’s just go back to the county!”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry,”sister Qian, you don’t have to work so hard!” Although my project is to be as fast as possible, it’s not to the point where I can’t even wait for a night. You still have to pay attention to your rest!”

“Don’t worry!”Wu Liqian said with a smile. I know what I’m doing!”

Hearing Wu Liqian’s words, Xia ruofei did not try to persuade her anymore. Anyway, this matter could not be settled overnight. Moreover, Wu Liqian was going back at this time most probably because she wanted to coordinate the project as soon as possible the next day. She did not want to waste her daytime on the road.

Hence, Xia ruofei nodded and opened the door for Wu Liqian.

After the two of them got into the car, the car headed straight for Changping County. Xia ruofei only returned to the farm after sending Wu Liqian back to the county government compound.

It was almost nineo’ clock in the evening. Wu Liqian went straight to the office. She wanted to sort out her thoughts and plan how to proceed with this matter in the most efficient way.

In the past, Wu Liqian didn’t need to be so cautious. As the executive Deputy County Head, although she couldn’t make many decisions with one word, she still had a lot of say. However, things were different now. She had suffered defeat after defeat, and her prestige in the county had fallen. In addition, she was held back by Liu haojun, the sh * t – Stirrer. If she wanted to do Xia ruofei’s job well, she needed a strategy.

The best way was naturally to get the support of the first and second in command. Before Liu haojun could react, the matter would be passed in the Standing Committee and then the board would be set.

When she reached the office building, Wu Liqian looked up and was surprised that the county head’s office on the sixth floor was still lit up. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Wu Liqian’s heart skipped a beat, and she walked up the stairs.

After entering the elevator on the first floor of the office building, Wu Liqian pondered for a while and then pressed the button for the fifth floor.

Wu Liqian went back to her office. After she sat down and organized her words, she picked up the phone on her desk and made a call.

After the call was connected, Wu Liqian said,””Hello, County Head Zhu, I’m Wu Liqian.”

On the other end of the phone, the county Head, Zhu zhihang, was stunned for a moment. He laughed and said,””It’s County Head Wu! It’s so late and you’re still up?”

Wu Liqian smiled.”County Head, I just came back from the city and saw that your office was still lit. I have something to report to you. I wonder if you are free now?”

Zhu zhihang was slightly stunned. He knew about Wu Liqian’s recent situation, but their personal relationship was not that good. He naturally had no obligation to help Wu Liqian.

Of course, the most important thing was that helping Wu Liqian would not bring him any benefits. On the contrary, he would offend Liu haojun, who had a powerful background. When dealing with people, they were more concerned about their own interests. They would never do something that was strenuous and unrewarding.

Therefore, when Zhu zhihang received this call, he instinctively thought that Wu Liqian wanted to ask him for help. To be honest, he definitely did not want to get involved in this.

Zhu zhihang pondered for a while and said with a smile,””Mayor Wu, isn’t there a regular meeting tomorrow? And it’s too late today, why don’t we talk about work tomorrow at the office?”

Wu Liqian didn’t want this matter to be directly reported to the leaders of the county who were qualified to attend the county Head office. At least three or four of them were on Liu haojun’s side. If it was revealed at the office, Liu haojun would find out about it. She didn’t know what he would do to her!

“County Head, this is an urgent matter,” Wu Liqian said hurriedly.”I hope I can report to you in private first. It’s about attracting investment ...”

“Isn’t there no turning back for the Huanglong group?” Zhu zhihang’s tone was a little unhappy.”I heard that they have all withdrawn their people. Is there any point in reporting this?”

The Huanglong group investment project that Wu Liqian was in charge of had been aborted halfway, which was a blow to Zhu zhihang’s prestige. Although he vaguely knew that it was Liu haojun’s doing, Wu Liqian, who was responsible for it, also made Zhu zhihang feel a little uncomfortable.

Zhu zhihang knew that there was no hope in this matter, so he thought that Wu Liqian wanted to use this report to draw out Liu haojun’s tricks and then seek his political support.

Wu Liqian frowned and said,”County Head, it’s not a Huanglong group project. It’s a new project. Not only is the investment much larger than the Huanglong group’s project, but the prospects are also incomparable ... I can’t explain it clearly over the phone. If it’s convenient for you, I can come to your office to report it in person!”
