This time, the formation of the Taixu xuanqing formation required a large number of materials. Some of them even required Xia ruofei to carve the formation runes himself. Some of the materials did not require the formation runes, but they still needed to be processed. Xia ruofei had to complete all these tasks personally.

Moreover, he could only complete a portion of it today because Xia ruofei only had a preliminary plan for activating the formation. This plan still needed further refinement. After all, he had only observed it once from the sky when he first came to Paradise Island. Some details still needed further confirmation.

This plan had to be as perfect as possible because Xia ruofei did not have much time left. The star Seizer sect’s people’s patience would be worn out sooner or later.

Hence, Xia ruofei was racing against time. He did not plan to rest today. To a cultivator, staying up a few nights would not affect him. The only disadvantage was that it would consume a lot of mental power to prepare the materials. For this, Xia ruofei had prepared the spatial spirit pool water, the Jade futon, and even the petal solution of the spirit Heart Flower.

At this time, it was worth it to pay a price.

Xia ruofei and Li Yifu were both cultivators, so they were very efficient. In a short while, all the boxes were opened.

The two of them took out all the materials together and piled them up in the warehouse separately.

Xia ruofei let out a long sigh and said,””That’s enough, foster husband. Go stand guard outside the door now. Without my permission, no one is allowed to enter!”

“Yes! Senior granduncle!” Li Yifu replied respectfully.

Xia ruofei smiled.”Be prepared to pull an all – nighter. Can your body take it?”

“Of course, no problem!” Li Yifu said with great enthusiasm,”great uncle – Master, thank you for your hard work! Disciple will be leaving now!”

“En!” Xia ruofei nodded.

Li Yifu strode out of the warehouse while Xia ruofei walked through the materials. Soon, he found a set of 16 Jade pillars that were as thick as a child’s arm. These Jade pillars were made of natural jade. Although the quality of the Jade was not particularly high, it was enough.

Of course, the higher the quality of the Jade materials used to inscribe formation patterns, the better the effect of the formation.

However, due to the lack of time, Xia ruofei could not ask Li Yifu to find the best Jade. It was not realistic at all.

Therefore, he could only solve some of the problems first. If he could survive this crisis, he would slowly find better materials to replace them.

At that time, the power of the formation would be increased again. Even the Masters of the late jiedan stage would find it difficult to shake it. Even if the Yuanying stage old monster came over, it could also have the power to block.

In Xia ruofei’s plan, he needed a total of nine of these Jade pillars. However, when he gave Li Yifu the list, he had taken into account the fact that he would need more if he failed to draw or if the plan was adjusted at the last minute. Hence, he had asked for 12 of them. In the end, Li Yifu had prepared four more.

According to Xia ruofei’s plan, these nine Jade pillars were the most important parts, second only to the core array disc. They were very important in activating the Taixu xuanqing formation. Moreover, the formation patterns needed to be engraved on these nine Jade pillars were ready – made. They could be engraved according to the formation diagram of the Taixu xuanqing formation and would not change according to the plan.

Hence, Xia ruofei decided to prepare the nine Jade pillars.

Of course, he didn’t blindly inscribe array patterns on the Jade pillar.

After finding the Jade pillars, Xia ruofei put them aside and sat on the ground with his legs crossed. He started to practice with his spiritual power.

This was a good habit he had always maintained.

Time passed by. These nine array runes were not particularly complicated. Xia ruofei practiced for about half an hour and was able to master the key points of the first array rune.

Thus, he sat on the Jade futon and took a few large gulps of the spatial spirit pool water to slowly recover his mental power.

After another twenty minutes, Xia ruofei felt that he was in his best condition. He reached out and took a Jade pillar.

He first checked the size of the Jade pillar and made sure that Li Yifu had cut it according to the requirements. Then, he reached out and gently stroked the surface of the Jade pillar, feeling the details of the Jade with his heart. This was also very important for him to carve the array pattern. Only by understanding the materials as much as possible could he ensure that the probability of mistakes in the carving process was the lowest.

Finally, Xia ruofei felt that the time was right. He placed the Jade pillar horizontally on his lap and closed his eyes. A stream of spiritual energy shot out from his fingertips and penetrated deeply into the Jade pillar.

His finger moved slightly, and a mysterious arc that was invisible to the naked eye appeared inside the Jade pillar.

Xia ruofei didn’t stop at all. He continued to carve in one go. There was a special sense of rhythm in the process. It was as if his fingertips were playing a beautiful piece of music on the surface of the Jade pillar. If anyone were to see it, they would definitely be pleased.

In a short three minutes, Xia ruofei had finished inscribing the first array pattern.

He held the Jade pillar with both hands and carefully examined the array patterns inside the Jade pillar. Finally, he revealed a smile and nodded in satisfaction.

After a short break, Xia ruofei immediately started to practice the second array pattern.

……

Xia ruofei spent the entire night practicing, carving, and checking.

When he finally carved the 9th array pattern into the Jade pillar, he couldn’t help but let out a sigh of relief.

Staying up all night without sleep was nothing, but staying up all night would consume and replenish his spiritual power. He had wandered on the edge of spiritual power exhaustion many times, and this feeling was really as sour as it could get.

Although he was exhausted, Xia ruofei felt a sense of achievement when he saw the nine Jade pillars neatly placed at the side.

Other than the core array disc, the most important part of the entire Taixu xuanqing formation was these nine Jade pillars.

He still needed to wait for the details of the entire plan to be finalized before he could start carving the core array disc.

The core array disc of the Taixu xuanqing formation was not static. This was because the array disc controlled the entire formation. Therefore, some details were closely related to the implementation plan of the formation. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Now, other than the array disc that could not be made for the time being, the nine Jade pillars had been completed. All that was left was some more cumbersome work that did not require much energy. To Xia ruofei, these tasks were not difficult.

Xia ruofei stood up and stretched. The sky outside was already starting to light up.

Xia ruofei walked out of the warehouse and found Li Yifu still standing upright at the door of the warehouse. His sharp eyes were constantly scanning the surroundings.

Hearing Xia ruofei’s footsteps, Li Yifu quickly turned around.

As soon as he saw Xia ruofei, Li Yifu immediately greeted him with respect.””Senior granduncle!”

“You’ve worked hard last night!” Xia ruofei said with a pleasant expression.

“This disciple was only standing here to guard, while martial granduncle was busy the entire night!” Li Yifu said,”the one who has really worked hard is you, Grand – Master!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”let’s not be polite with each other.” Everyone has worked hard! Adopted husband, you can go in and rest for a while! You’ll have to stay in the warehouse for the next few days and won’t leave the materials for a moment. The conditions are a little rough, so you have to overcome it!”

“Yes! Grand Master!” Li Yifu said,”I think that the conditions are good enough! It’s disciple’s honor to be able to serve by martial granduncle’s side!”

“Okay, okay ...” Xia ruofei said helplessly,”go in and rest for a while. Just be alert. I’ll tell them not to come near here!” I still have something to do, so I’ll probably be back in the afternoon. Remember not to touch the materials, because I’ve already processed some of them. ”

“Alright, martial granduncle!” Li Yifu said.

After Xia ruofei left the warehouse, he went straight to Liu Qingfeng and asked him to restrain the guards and not go near the warehouse.

In addition, Xia ruofei asked Liu Qingfeng to arrange for the pilot to prepare the helicopter. He wanted to take a good look at the entire array structure of Peach Garden Island today. Now that Peach Garden Island belonged to him, he did not need to have any more concerns.
