Chapter 3583: Retribution (1)

Translator: 549690339

If it hadn’t happened to him, Jiang Hua would never have thought that he would experience such a nightmare after he left that day.

As long as he fell asleep, he would have endless nightmares.

The content of the dream was very simple. He was trapped in a dark room with no door, and there was only a dim yellow oil lamp. Then, two people with blood flowing from the corners of their mouths and pale faces stood in front of him, with a chilling smile on their lips. The two dead faces were just a few centimeters away from his face. No matter how he hid, the distance between the two faces would not change. Even if he closed his eyes, he could still feel the cold and close.

Moreover, he knew both of them. One of them was Jiang Cuihua’s husband, her Uncle Lin Shengming. The other was his cousin, Lin Hu.

Jiang Hua had scammed Jiang Cuihua’s money and was already feeling guilty. Now, seeing Jiang Cuihua’s two dead family members staring at him at such a close distance, how terrifying was that feeling?

Both Lin Shengming and Lin Hu did not say a word to Jiang Hua, but that made Jiang Hua even more afraid.

Moreover, once he fell asleep, he would not wake up easily.

He was screaming and shouting in his dream, and in reality, he was also lying in bed and screaming as if he had seen a ghost. In fact, he had seen a ghost. And no matter how his family pushed him, he couldn’t wake up. Every time, he had to struggle for an hour or two before he woke up, sweating profusely.

His neighbors couldn’t stand the disturbance and even advised his family to take him to the mental hospital for a check – up.

Some people said that Jiang Hua was possessed by an evil spirit, and it was best to find a skilled Taoist to exorcise it, otherwise, he might lose his life.

Only Jiang Hua himself knew that this was all the work of the seemingly weak Chairman of the peach blossom company, Xia ruofei.

It was already very strange that he had said what was on his mind in public the other day. When he left, Xia ruofei’s words were still ringing in his ears. Now that he thought about it, Xia ruofei was so confident that he was not afraid that he would not return the money. Didn’t that explain the problem?

In fact, this was all Xia ruofei’s doing.

It was too easy to deal with an ordinary person like Jiang Hua.

As long as Xia ruofei wanted to, he could even create an extremely realistic illusion. Even if Jiang Hua was awake, he would be trapped in the illusion all the time and would not be able to escape.

That would be much more painful than his current state.

Xia ruofei had never met Lin Hu’s father, Lin Shengming, and he did not need to know what Lin Shengming looked like. He only needed to plant the seed of fear in Jiang Hua’s weak consciousness, and Jiang Hua would naturally have the scariest nightmare. Jiang Hua knew Lin Shengming, so the image of Lin Shengming in his dream was actually an image that he had created himself. It was also the image that he feared the most in the depths of his heart. What Xia ruofei did was just to materialize this fear.

Jiang Hua had been holding on for two days, but he couldn’t hold on any longer.

Early this morning, he went to the ATM to withdraw 10000 Yuan and then stumbled to the Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory’s factory. Xia ruofei had told him to look for Xue Jinshan before he left that day. He didn’t take it seriously at that time, but he didn’t expect his face to be slapped so quickly.

Jiang Hua tried his best to control his sleepiness. He pinched his own thigh from time to time and even slapped his own face, afraid that he would accidentally fall asleep.

He was so tired, but he didn’t dare to sleep. This feeling was too painful.

It was precisely because of this that the waiting process seemed to be even more torturous and long.

After a long time, the door of the reception room finally opened. Jiang Hua saw Xue Jinshan walking in and quickly went up to him. He said in a trembling voice,”Factory manager Xue, what… What did President Xia say?”

Xue Jinshan didn’t know the whole story, but Xia ruofei had already given him clear instructions, so he didn’t need to know too much.

And from Xia ruofei’s words, Xue Jinshan knew that Jiang Hua must have offended Xia ruofei and was in a difficult situation.

Since that was the case, Xue Jinshan naturally did not need to be too polite to Jiang Hua.

“You said you’re here to return the money, where’s the money?” he asked coldly.

Jiang Hua quickly took out the 10000 Yuan and handed it to Xue Jinshan with both hands.””! owe President Xia’s godmother 9000 Yuan. Here’s 10000 Yuan. The remaining 1000 yuan can be considered as interest…”

If it hadn’t happened to him, Jiang Hua would never have thought that he would experience such a nightmare after he left that day.
