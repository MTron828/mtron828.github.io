Chapter 1421: The special prize (1)

Translator: 549690339

As soon as Xia ruofei finished speaking, the employees were all excited.

“The chairman is so cool!”

“What a good leader of China!”

“It’s bright!”

“I love you to death, Chairman ...”

Xia ruofei’s results were the best in this round. He had earned more than 30000 Yuan.

Now that he had drawn out an extra employee, it meant that he did not even need to participate in the game segment to get the highest bonus.

Was there anything more awesome than this?

Liu Qian came to Xia ruofei with the lucky draw box and asked pitifully,””Chairman, can those who have won the prize before still participate in your special lucky draw?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”you’re thinking too much, Liu Qian!” You’re going to conjure up a lottery ticket for me?”

The winning vouchers would not be put back into the lucky draw box, but would be handed over to the staff for safekeeping. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The staff in the audience also burst into laughter.

Liu Qian was actually just trying to lighten up the atmosphere. The annual meeting was meant to have fun, and she was not an insatiable person. She had already won the prize before, so why would she want to win another one?

Xia ruofei said,”I’m going to start the lottery!” To those who have not won the prize, please announce your numbers!”

“Number 77!”

“Number 307!”

“Number 285!”

The employees ‘voices rose and fell, one louder than the other. One of the young men even shouted until his voice cracked, which caused another round of laughter.

Xia ruofei reached into the lottery box and stirred it a few times before pulling out a lottery ticket.

In an instant, everyone’s eyes were focused on this small lottery ticket.

Xia ruofei laughed and held the lottery ticket tightly. Even the camera could not capture the close – up image.

Then, he carefully opened the corner of the ticket, took a quick look at it, and then immediately closed it.

The employees couldn’t help but laugh. It was rare for them to see Xia ruofei. Today, not only did they see him sing on stage, but they also saw him participate in the money – making game. Now, they saw Xia ruofei’s funny side. They suddenly felt that the image of the chairman was much more friendly.

“Do you want to know the winning number?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

“I want to!”

“Chairman, quickly announce it!”

“Don’t keep us in suspense!”

“Don’t learn from Liu Qian!”

Liu Qian, who was at the side, didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. This young lady had been shot while lying down!

“If you want to know the number, then let me hear your applause and cheers!” Xia ruofei said unhurriedly.

“Clap clap clap ...” A thunderous applause immediately rang out, mixed with all kinds of cheers of different heights. It was as if even the ceiling of the banquet hall was shaking.

Xia ruofei nodded in satisfaction and smiled.””Why don’t we ... Let Liu Qian announce this number?”

“No, no, no!” Liu Qian quickly waved her hand. I didn’t do anything, but I’m already the bad example. I don’t want to offend anyone again ...”

“Hahaha ...” The employees all laughed heartily, and the slightly tense atmosphere suddenly eased.

Xia ruofei did not keep her in suspense and said,””Let us congratulate ... No. 111!”

As he announced the winning number, he also showed the lottery ticket in his hand to the camera.

A close – up of the lottery ticket appeared on the big screen. It was indeed number 111, a very regular number.

“Where’s the employee holding lottery ticket No. 111?”Xia ruofei asked loudly.

Initially, Xia ruofei thought that there would be a happy response from the staff. Unexpectedly, the moment he finished speaking, the staff below the stage were also looking around, but no one stood up.

At this time, a staff member quickly flipped through the record book and then said a few words into the walkie – talkie.

Liu Qian held her headphones with one hand and listened carefully. She quickly nodded slightly and said to Xia ruofei,”Chairman, the staff confirmed that the owner of lottery ticket No. 111 is Geng bin from the security Department. He was on duty at the farm today and did not come to the scene.”

Xia ruofei was slightly stunned. He did not expect Geng bin, who was on duty at the farm, to win the prize instead of so many people.

However, he quickly revealed a smile and said,””That’s not bad either! I think it’s more meaningful for the brother who gave up today to win this special award! Don’t you guys agree?”

Although the staff felt a little regretful that they did not win the prize, they still responded to Xia ruofei’s words loudly.

“Yes!”

“The chairman is right!”

“Brothers from the security Department, you’ve worked hard! He should win this award!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said to Liu Qian,”Can you try to video call Geng bin?”

“Alright!” Liu Qian said, and then quickly went down the stage to make arrangements.

Originally, if the staff outside the venue won the prize, a few of them would be selected for the live connection.

Xia ruofei was the one who had contributed to the award and it just so happened that the staff from the security Department had won it. Naturally, they had to connect the two.

Liu Qian also knew that Xia ruofei had a good relationship with the Veterans of the security Department, so she didn’t dare to delay. She immediately used her phone to call the number of the farm’s Gate guard.

When Geng bin learned that he would be video – called at the annual meeting, he was also a little confused. After he came back to his senses, he quickly agreed.

After he added the WeChat account that the staff of the annual meeting had specially applied for, he soon received a video call request.
