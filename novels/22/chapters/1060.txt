Translator: 549690339

Lu zhongguang’s mood had also reached a peak. He looked at Feng Jing, who was standing at the side of the stage.

Naturally, Feng Rao was also very excited. The auction’s success had exceeded her expectations. She had expected the auction to go smoothly, but she had not expected to obtain such a dazzling result.

She nodded at Lu zhongguang, took a deep breath, and walked to the center of the stage.

“Ladies and gentlemen, we will be auctioning today’s last top – grade one – Head abalone!” Feng Rao said with a smile,”this abalone is the rarest one of all the items up for auction today. It weighs 653.2 grams, which is far beyond the standard of a one – headed abalone. It can even be considered a priceless treasure!”

Everyone below the stage held their breath.

Priceless treasure was naturally just a description. If the item was put up for auction, it would definitely have a final price.

However, no one thought that Feng Jing was exaggerating.

It was a super huge abalone that weighed 653.3 grams! Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Before today, 300 grams of abalone could already be considered the best. Even two – headed abalone was very rare.

However, at the auction today, the Paradise Corporation had taken out more than 20 abalones in one go, most of which were more than 600 grams. Everyone was more or less numb to this.

Even so, the 653.2 – gram super giant abalone still made everyone feel a sense of awe.

In a world where two – headed abalones were so rare, wasn’t such an extra – large one – headed abalone a priceless treasure?

“Let’s reveal the final Super One – headed abalone!”Feng Rao continued.

After she finished speaking, she walked to the table and gently pulled off the red silk.

A cameraman immediately went up to take a close – up shot, which was also transmitted to the big screen in the venue in real time.

Everyone’s eyes were glued to the screen as the HD video camera captured every detail of the abalone. From all angles, the abalone was so perfect that it made the gluttons who really liked the dish yearn for it!

Feng Rao had a confident smile on her face.”I believe everyone has already read the auction manual. For the last top – grade abalone, considering that some customers can’t come for various reasons, we will also accept long – distance bidding in addition to all the guests present.”

“Of course, there are certain requirements for remote auctions. We started accepting applications three days ago, and we also took the initiative to send out some invitations according to the situation. After the qualification review, there are a total of 15 customers who meet the requirements for remote auctions, and they are all online now!”

As soon as Feng Jing finished speaking, an interface appeared on the big screen to her right.

This was the Hengfeng auction house’s official website’s special page for the top – grade abalones auction. There was a sub – Page installed with the long – distance bidding system.

Everyone can clearly see that all 15 virtual avatars have been lit up, and each ID only has a number, which is 01 to 15.

Although they did not know who the owners of these 15 IDs were, everyone was very clear that their background was probably not any less than Li Kai, he Xinyi, Zheng zhilun, and the others present. Otherwise, they would not have been able to pass the Hengfeng auction house’s strict review.

After hearing Feng Rao’s introduction, Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment. Then, he secretly opened the auction manual in his hand and started to read. As expected, he found the information about how the last abalone would be auctioned in a remote auction.

He couldn’t help but blush at how incompetent he was as the chairman. Even ordinary guests knew about it, but he didn ‘t.

In fact, Feng Jing had taken the initiative to report the situation yesterday. However, Xia ruofei was afraid of trouble, so he pushed all the responsibility to Feng Jing and became the hands – off manager. After arriving at the auction house, he only casually flipped through the auction manual and did not study it as seriously as those who were interested in competing.

Xia ruofei looked at the stage guiltily and noticed that Feng Rao was also looking at him with a half – Smile. He couldn’t help but feel even more embarrassed. He gave Feng Rao a dry smile and sat up straight.

Feng Rao had indeed seen Xia ruofei secretly flipping through the auction manual. She knew that this boss Xia probably did not even know the auction process well, so she could not help but feel helpless.

She really did owe him in her past life ... Feng Jing sighed inwardly.

Of course, she was also someone who was used to big scenes, so although she was a little distracted, she still remained calm on the surface.

After the introduction, Feng Rao smiled and said,””I will now return the stage to Hengfeng’s chief auctioneer, Mr. Lu zhongguang! I wish everyone good luck!”

After speaking, Feng Jing bowed slightly and returned to the high stool at the side of the stage. Lu zhongguang walked up to the stage from the side.

This small segment gave Lu zhongguang, who had been in a high state of excitement, a short break. In addition, the auction of the last Super large one – headed abalone made him very excited, so he returned to the stage in high spirits.

“Ladies and gentlemen! The most exciting moment has finally arrived!” Lu zhongguang said in his unique magnetic voice,”I hereby announce that the last item of this auction, the 653.2 – gram Super One – headed abalone, will be auctioned! The starting price for this abalone was 0 Yuan! Each bid must be no less than 200000 Hong Kong dollars! Guests both online and offline can make a bid!”
