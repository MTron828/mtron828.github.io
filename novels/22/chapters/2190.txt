Xiao liuzi’s Short Video usually had cheerful background music, so Feng Jing was very close to him and did not hear the footsteps behind her. However, Xia ruofei’s hearing was so good that he noticed it immediately.

Only he and Ling Qingxue had the keys to the villa, so the only person who could have come in through the main door in the middle of the night was Ling Qingxue.

As expected, before Xia ruofei could stand up, Ling Qingxue opened the door and walked into the villa. She was holding a lunchbox in her hand.

When Ling Qingxue saw that Feng Jing was also in Xia ruofei’s house, and their heads were almost touching, she was stunned.

Xia ruofei heard the sound of footsteps and reacted immediately. He stood up and greeted her awkwardly,””Qingxue’s here!”

Only then did Feng Rao snap out of her daze. She turned around and saw Ling Qingxue standing by the button. She immediately stood up, and her face couldn’t help but blush.

Feng Jing could feel the complicated look in Ling Qingxue’s eyes. She felt a sudden sense of panic, like a child who had been caught doing something wrong.

Ling Qingxue’s face didn’t show any emotion, and she only said indifferently,””Sister ran is here too ... Ruofei, we made some dumplings tonight. My dad knows that you’re back, so he asked me to send some over!” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Ling Qingxue then placed the dumplings on the cabinet at the entrance. She didn’t even enter the house and said,””The dumplings are here. I’ll go back first ...”

“Don’t misunderstand, Qingxue!”Feng Rao quickly said. I came over to check on the progress of the renovation after work and happened to see that the lights in the Chairman’s house were on, so I came over to take a look ... Didn’t the chairman not return to the company for a while? That’s why I’m reporting to him about my work. ”

Ling Qingxue smiled and said,””Sister che, I didn’t misunderstand. You guys can continue! I’ll go home first ...”

Ling Qingxue had seen Xia ruofei and Feng Rao looking at their phones together and laughing. This did not look like a report.

However, Ling Qingxue didn’t want to reveal everything. This wasn’t something a smart woman would do. Therefore, although she felt a little bitter in her heart, she still chose to leave at the first moment. This way, she would not fall out with him, and at the same time, she would be able to express her feelings.

Moreover, Ling Qingxue believed that even if Xia ruofei and Feng Rao were in an ambiguous relationship, she had already seen through it. At least, there would not be any more drama between the two of them tonight because she left first.

Seeing this, Xia ruofei immediately said,”Qingxue, why are you leaving so soon?” Come in and sit for a while!”

Naturally, Xia ruofei could not let Ling Qingxue go back just like that. Otherwise, he would not be able to explain himself even if he was covered in mouths.

So as he spoke, he walked over and pulled Ling Qingxue’s hand into the house without saying anything.

Ling Qingxue’s heart was in a mess, but she didn’t want to go back just like that. If he really left, she would definitely not be able to sleep the entire night.

Therefore, she said half – heartedly,””I haven’t changed my shoes yet ...”

“Then change your shoes!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”this is your personal pair of slippers.”

Ling Qingxue remained silent. After changing her shoes, she bent down and carefully put her own shoes into the shoe cabinet. Then, she followed Xia ruofei into the living room without a word.

Feng Jing felt extremely embarrassed and regretful. If she hadn’t agreed to stay over, there wouldn’t have been so many problems.

Feng Jing couldn’t help but curse herself in her heart. I knew that Qingxue lived not far away, but I still came with RUO Fei. Why am I so stupid? How could he explain it clearly now?

Xia ruofei was very open. He felt that he had not done anything wrong and there was no need to look guilty.

He held Ling Qingxue’s hand and brought her to the living room to sit on the sofa. He then said with a smile,””Qingxue, sister ran was just talking to me about a new project on our farm! Didn’t I set up a small goose farm on the farm before I went out to sea? There were six Strasburg geese raised there, which was also for the test and technical reserve for the next step of large – scale breeding. Well ... Xiao liuzi, who was in charge of the breeding farm, had posted a lot of videos on TikTok, and now those six Strasburg geese had become internet celebrities! We were just watching the video! There ... The screen hasn’t been turned off yet!”

Ling Qingxue’s gaze followed the direction of Xia ruofei’s finger. As expected, she saw Feng Rao’s phone on the coffee table. It was still playing the video that Xiao liuzi had posted.

If the video on TikTok ended, it would go back to the beginning and play on loop. In this state, as long as the screen was not turned off manually, the phone would not automatically turn off.

Ling Qingxue watched the video and knew that Xia ruofei was not lying. She was already 70 – 80% convinced.

Even though it was already so late and Feng Jing was still at Xia ruofei’s house, which made Ling Qingxue feel a little uncomfortable, at least the scene that she had just seen was not an ambiguous one between the two of them. When she thought about it this way, she instantly felt much better.

“I didn’t say anything ...” Ling Qingxue glanced at Xia ruofei and said,”why are you explaining so much? It’s like I’m very petty ...”

Xia ruofei quickly replied,”how can I?” Our Qingxue is the most magnanimous, isn’t she? Sister Che!”

Feng Rao also nodded awkwardly and said,””That’s for sure! Is she your overbearing President? How can I not be generous?”
