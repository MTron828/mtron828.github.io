Chapter 795: Buying vegetable seeds (1)

Xia ruofei held Ling Qingxue’s hand as they walked out of the general office building. Along the way, many employees greeted them respectfully.

Ling Qingxue was Xia ruofei’s girlfriend, and the older employees in the company knew about it. Hence, they were not surprised that Ling Qingxue was in the office.

Ling Qingxue, on the other hand, was feeling a little “guilty.” Her face was slightly red, and her palms were sweating.

Xia ruofei was holding Ling Qingxue’s hand. Naturally, he could feel Ling Qingxue’s nervousness. He could not help but find it a little funny. At the same time, his heart fluttered and he could not help but gently scratch Ling Qingxue’s palm.

Ling Qingxue was so angry that she glared at Xia ruofei.

The two of them walked out of the comprehensive office building and headed straight for the small villa.

They did not notice that in the general office building, behind the window of the office next to Xia ruofei ‘s, a pair of eyes was watching the two of them as they walked away. The expression on the person’s face was complicated.

This person was Feng Rao.

Feng Jing only retracted her gaze when Xia ruofei and Xia ruofei turned a corner and disappeared into the small path hidden by the green trees.

Her face was still flushed, and she couldn’t help but Mutter,””This guy is really ridiculous ...”

Feng Jing wasn’t supposed to notice the commotion in the office next door.

However, she had just thought of something and wanted to ask Xia ruofei for instructions. As a result, when she reached the door, she heard a strange sound coming from the room before she could even knock on the door.

Feng Rao was so frightened that she immediately returned to her office with a red face.

......

Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue naturally did not know that they had unintentionally made a live broadcast. They snuggled up to each other as they returned to the small villa.

Hu Zi’s mother and Lin Qiao were very happy to see Ling Qingxue, especially Lin Qiao, who called her sister – in – Law affectionately. She held Ling Qingxue’s hand and kept talking to her.

Hu’s mother also went to the kitchen happily. Since her godson’s girlfriend was here, she had to make a few more dishes. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Ling Qingxue was pulled by Lin Qiao to sit on the sofa in the living room and chat. The two of them whispered to each other and giggled, while Xia ruofei was left out.

However, Xia ruofei did not feel depressed. He enjoyed the happy family atmosphere.

Xia ruofei’s parents had passed away when he was very young. He had grown up with his grandfather. After his grandfather had passed away, he had not felt the warmth of a family for a long time.

Now, not only did he have a girlfriend, but he also had a godmother and the weird Lin Qiao. Xia ruofei felt that his current life was pretty good.

Seeing that the two of them were chatting happily, Xia ruofei did not want to disturb them. He went back to his room upstairs to surf the internet.

In the afternoon, Hu Zi’s mother had prepared a table full of dishes. Xia ruofei took out two bottles of Semillon wine that he had bought in Australia. After being nourished by the spiritual energy and magic of time in the spirit map space, the taste was quite rich.

Lin Qiao and Hu ‘Zi’s mother had both drunk it before, and Ling Qingxue was full of praise for it.

Everyone happily finished their lunch. Ling Qingxue then diligently helped Hu Zi’s mother pack up.

It wasn’t easy for a poor lady like her to do such menial work. This showed that she really cared about her relationship with Xia ruofei, which was why she took the initiative to join the family.

Everyone worked together, and they quickly finished packing.

Lin Qiao smiled and said,”sister – in – Law, I’ve been occupying you for the whole morning. Now I’m giving it back to brother ruofei!” Otherwise, my brother will hate me to death ...”

Ling Qingxue blushed and said,””He dares! Qiao’ er, let’s ignore him. Didn’t you just say that you weren’t very good at Photoshop? I’ve learned some before, why don’t we go to your room now? I’ll teach you. ”

Lin Qiao sneaked a glance at Xia ruofei and said with a smile,”Sister – in – Law, maybe next time! I’m a little sleepy after drinking, so I want to sleep for a while ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and secretly gave Lin Qiao a thumbs – up.

Hu Zi’s mother was also a clever person. She smiled and said,””Qingxue, go upstairs and rest with ruofei! If we don’t sleep at noon, we’ll be tired in the afternoon. Let’s go back to our rooms to rest ...”

After that, Hu Zi’s mother winked at Lin Qiao, and the two of them went back to their room.

Ling Qingxue glared at Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei laughed and reached out to hold her waist.”Wife, Imperial mother has spoken, let’s go and rest for a while? Otherwise, I won’t have any energy in the afternoon ...”

“Can you rest well?” Ling Qingxue asked unhappily. If I go upstairs with you, I’ll be even more listless in the afternoon ...”

Xia ruofei walked up the stairs with Ling Qingxue in his arms and said seriously,””You don’t understand. Women need to be nourished ... You see, some women are only in their thirties, but they’re already old and yellow. Most of them are caused by endocrine disorders ...”

Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but hit Xia ruofei lightly and said,””You’re the only one with so much twisted logic!”

The two of them walked into the room, and what followed was naturally another fierce battle ...

After the two of them had given up, they fell asleep in each other’s arms. When they woke up again, it was almost four in the afternoon.

Ling Qingxue’s face carried a trace of laziness. She glanced at Xia ruofei and then sat up.

Xia ruofei didn’t look tired at all. Instead, he felt refreshed. The anger in his chest had disappeared, and his state of mind had returned to normal.

The two of them got dressed and went downstairs. Lin Qiao had already gotten up and was sitting cross – legged on the sofa in the living room, fiddling with her laptop.
