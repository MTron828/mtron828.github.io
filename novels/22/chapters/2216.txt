2217 Fairness and justice (1)

After two hours, Xia ruofei and Song Wei opened their eyes.

Song Wei was still shy. She quickly glanced at Xia ruofei and quickly lowered her head.

It was not her first time cultivating with Xia ruofei’s spirit body. However, today’s situation was special. Although she was focused during cultivation, she could not suppress the shyness in her heart when they finished their cultivation.

After all, Ling Qingxue was in the bathroom just a wall away.

In reality, the two of them had only been cultivating for two hours, which was only a few minutes in the outside world. Ling Qingxue definitely couldn’t have come out so quickly, but that different kind of stimulation was still very strong.

Song Wei felt her legs go soft. Of course, this was all a psychological effect. In fact, after the spirit body combined cultivation, her cultivation had improved again. Moreover, her body was not involved in any exercise, so she naturally did not feel tired.

Song Wei quickly stood up and said with a hint of panic and shyness,””RUO Fei, let’s go out!”

“Weiwei, why do I feel like I’m guilty?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

Song Wei blushed and said,”don’t say anymore!” Qingxue should be out soon, let’s go out!”

Xia ruofei spread his hands and said,”I need to rest for a while.” I’m so tired just now ...”

“No way!” Song Wei glared at Xia ruofei and said,”I see that you’re full of energy!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I like this description!” What a sense of accomplishment!”

Song Wei blurted out and blushed again. She pinched Xia ruofei’s arm and said,”Are you going out or not?” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”I really need to recover my mental strength!” You’re done with your cultivation, but I still have to serve student Qingxue later! You don’t want any accidents to happen to us while we’re cultivating, do you?”

“Don’t think that I don’t understand!”Song Wei said in a low voice. Your spiritual power is much stronger than ours, why would you need to recover!”

Then, she pulled Xia ruofei up and pushed him out of the time formation.

Xia ruofei kept the time array flag with a smile and pointed at the bathroom where the sound of water came from.””Did you see? Qingxue would definitely not be that fast! What’s the hurry?”

Song Wei’s face was red as she walked to the bed and sat down.

Xia ruofei also sat down on the sofa at the head of the bed and sank into it without any care for his image.

“Weiwei,” he said,”you rushed back from Yunan. It must have been a hard journey, right?”

“Isn’t this for our sake?”Song Wei said faintly. No matter how hard it is, I have to get it!”

Xia ruofei’s seat was a little low. He looked up at Song Wei and could not help but reach out to grab her hand. “It’s been hard on you ...”

Song Wei retracted her hand in a panic and said,”Ruofei, I promised Qingxue. We can’t ...”

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly and waved his hand.””I understand ... I will respect your opinions.”

What the hell is this? Xia ruofei said in his heart.

When he was cultivating with the spirit bodies in his sea of consciousness, he had experienced all kinds of madness. Now that he was back in reality, he couldn’t even hold hands. Wasn’t this self – deception?

The two of them were silent for a while. Xia ruofei took the initiative to ask,””By the way, you haven’t gone home yet, have you?”

“Mm! Qingxue came to the airport to pick me up. After we chatted for a while, she came straight to your place. ” Song Wei said,”but it’s fine! My parents don’t know that I’m back! I’ll just go back tomorrow and give them a surprise!”

Xia ruofei nodded.”That’s fine. It’s already so late. We’ll disturb their rest if we go back!”

The two of them chatted for a while until the sound of water in the bathroom stopped. After a while, Ling Qingxue came out in cotton home clothes, drying her hair with a bath towel.

She saw the two of them sitting by the bed and chatting. She asked nonchalantly,””You’re done with your cultivation so quickly?”

Song Wei immediately stood up and said,””Qingxue, it’s ... It’s your turn to cultivate with ruofei ... I’ll find a room to sleep in and won’t disturb you guys!” He said.

“Don ‘t!” Ling Qingxue quickly said. You can’t leave! I still have to go rest with you later!”

“It’s fine, you can rest here with RUO Fei!”Song Wei was stunned for a moment. I’ll sleep in the guest room alone!”

Ling Qingxue said seriously,”Wei Wei, our agreement doesn’t only apply to you. It also applies to me!” Of course I can’t stay overnight! Not only that, you have to be there to supervise me!”

Xia ruofei and Song Wei looked at each other and didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.

Ling Qingxue thought for a moment and said,””That’s not right! Didn’t we use this room? Where are you going! It’s that guy who should be leaving later!”

As Ling Qingxue spoke, she pointed at Xia ruofei, who had an innocent expression on his face.

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly and nodded.””Yes, yes, yes, I should be the one leaving! Wei Wei, why don’t you go take a shower too? I’ll be able to rest in a while!”

“But ...” Song Wei hesitated and said,”my clothes are still in the suitcase!” I left the suitcase in the car ... I’ll go get a change of clothes!”
