3289 Plenty of rewards (2)

Old Daoist Zhen Yang didn’t rush him and simply stood to the side and watched with a smile.

After about half an hour, Xia ruofei’s eyes lit up. He had finally mastered the sword control technique. It could be said that he had a basic grasp of it.

Xia ruofei couldn’t wait to try it out. Thus, he first made the flying sword recognize him as its master. Then, he silently used the sword control technique he had just learned and quickly established a connection with the flying sword.

The qushuang flying sword, which had just been placed on the table, suddenly seemed to come to life. It hummed softly and began to sway as it floated in the air.

Xia ruofei tried to control the flying sword and did a few movements. He realized that the sword technique could be used. The only thing he was lacking now was proficiency. He believed that with more practice, he would be able to use the flying sword like he did on earth.

The learning ability of cultivators was very strong. Controlling a flying sword was not a particularly complicated skill. As long as one mastered this Sword Art, it was relatively easy to increase the proficiency.

Xia ruofei’s face was full of excitement. Being able to use a flying sword in the secret realm would greatly increase his survivability.

Moreover, flying swords could be controlled, which meant that sword Kinesis flight was also possible.

In other words, he would be able to use sword Kinesis flight in the process of exploring the secret realm.

This was much stronger than when he could only use his feet to measure the boundless secret realm space.

Besides, being able to ride a flying sword meant that his ability to escape had increased by a large margin. This was undoubtedly a great advantage for Xia ruofei.

“Thank you for your generosity, Taoist priest!” Xia ruofei sincerely bowed to old Taoist Zhen Yang.

Even though the other party was just a puppet, the reward this time was too useful to Xia ruofei. Hence, his gratitude came from the bottom of his heart.

Old Daoist Zhen Yang waved his hand with a smile and said,”This is what you deserve.”

He paused for a moment before continuing,””There’s one more thank you gift, but I can’t give it to you for the time being. I’ll give you another gift first. This is an extra thank you gift for completing the third difficult problem!”

Although Xia ruofei was confused about the second reward, he was excited and full of anticipation when he heard that it was the reward for the additional question.

Old Daoist Zhen Yang took out another treasure from his storage spiritual treasure and handed it to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei took it and looked at it. He couldn’t help but reveal a curious look. The shape of this treasure was really strange. It looked like a pair of glasses with two round pink crystal lenses connected in the middle. However, this “glasses” did not have legs. Instead, it was attached with an elastic band made of some animal’s tendon, making it look more like a wind – proof goggles.

No matter what, this was an item with a modern aura. It didn’t look like a treasure from the cultivation world.

Xia ruofei didn’t know why old Taoist Zhen Yang would take out this thing, and it was even an additional reward. Generally speaking, additional rewards were relatively difficult to obtain, so the rewards should also be relatively valuable. Could it be that this thing was more precious than the flying sword of the bent frost? Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Old Daoist Zhen Yang introduced with a smile,”Master Xia, this item is called the sensory mirror. It’s also a precious magical treasure, but it can only be used here. It can’t be taken out. I have to make this clear to master Xia first ...”

So this was a control type treasure! It could only be used in the secret realm, and it could not be taken out of the secret realm.

As such, Xia ruofei’s interest in this item was even smaller. However, he still asked,””May I ask, what is the use of this perceptual mirror?”

“This treasure has many uses. Why don’t you let it recognize you as its owner and wear it on your body? I’ll explain them to you one by one,” Daoist Zhen Yang said with a smile.

Xia ruofei nodded.

Xia ruofei was already familiar with the process of dripping blood on the perceptual mirror to recognize its master. Soon, he successfully made the perceptual mirror recognize its master. He could also feel the faint connection between him and the perceptual mirror.

Under Taoist Zhen Yang’s guidance, Xia ruofei put on the perceptual mirror pendant.

Just as he expected, the thing was worn on the head, and the two lenses blocked the eyes.

Xia ruofei thought to himself,”I won’t be wearing it all the time, will I?” Even if it had a very impressive function, it was too embarrassing to wear it all year round ...

Wearing these extra – large wind – proof goggles would definitely make one look very silly ...

Xia ruofei thought as he took out a mirror from the spirit map space. He wanted to see his glorious image.

He mustered up the courage to look at the mirror and almost cried out in shock. His image in the mirror had not changed at all – although the sensory mirror was worn, it seemed to be completely invisible and could not be seen at all.

“What’s going on?” Xia ruofei could not help but ask.

“After the sensory mirror has recognized you as its master, it will automatically disappear when you wear it again. No one will be able to see that you’re wearing this magic weapon!” Taoist Zhen Yang said with a smile.

Xia ruofei secretly heaved a sigh of relief. It would be embarrassing if he kept wearing a weird pair of goggles.

Of course, old Daoist Zhen Yang had also said that this item could only be used in the mystic realm and couldn’t be taken away. It was still unknown whether he would be able to meet anyone in the mystic realm! However, it was always good to be able to hide.

Xia ruofei felt it for a while. He did not know what the rubber band of the sensory mirror was made of, but it was comfortable and did not feel uncomfortable. The other lens looked like pink crystal, but after he put it on, he saw nothing different, not to mention the color change.

This was not bad. Otherwise, it would be maddening to see a field of pink.

Of course, the most important thing was what this thing was used for. It was useless, no matter how comfortable it was.

“Taoist priest,” Xia ruofei asked directly,”what can this treasure do? please tell me.”

“The perceptual mirror, as its name suggests, is used to display the function of perception. Scholar Xia can use his mind to communicate with the treasure, and this treasure can determine the cultivation level and level of cultivators, monsters, and even objects within one’s field of vision. Some of them even have a simple introduction ...”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be dumbfounded. He used his mind to connect with the perceptual mirror, and as expected, he obtained a lot of information. It was quite easy to operate.

He turned his gaze to the little Daoist boy, Qing Feng, at the door, and lines of words in traditional Chinese characters suddenly appeared in his vision ...

The Daoist child Qing Feng

Beginner puppet

[Cultivation level: refined Qi Level 6]

[Weakness: the material used to make it is flawed. The hardness of the body is relatively low, especially the defense of the neck.]

……

There was some other information below. Xia ruofei scanned through it and erased it with his mind.

This was too magical! With this function alone, Xia ruofei had the ability to cheat in the secret realm.

He couldn’t help but turn to look at old Daoist Zhen Yang, but to his disappointment, the sensory mirror only gave him a series of greetings and no useful information.

Old Taoist Zhen Yang seemed to have seen through Xia ruofei’s intention and laughed,””There’s a limit to the scope of the sensory mirror. It’s related to your cultivation level. If your cultivation level is three levels higher than yours, all information will be hidden.”

Xia ruofei suddenly realized that even though Taoist Zhen Yang was a puppet, his level was so high that he could not see any information from the sensory mirror.

Of course, even so, the use of the perceptual mirror was already very great. If he saw a situation full of question marks, it meant that the other party’s level was at least three levels higher than his. In this case, it was better to stay away.

...

Therefore, even if they could not see through the other party’s information, they could still give an early warning.

Xia ruofei was very satisfied with this additional reward.

On the other hand, old Daoist Zhen Yang chuckled and said,”Mister Xia, the sensory mirror has another function that should be very helpful to you ...”
