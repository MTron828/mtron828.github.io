2687 The fish is about to take the bait (1)

Before Xia ruofei passed the checkpoint in front of the warehouse, he changed his appearance back to his original one. After passing the checkpoint, he changed back to “Commissioner Xu” and drove the car directly to the warehouse entrance.

Xia ruofei pushed the door open and entered. Li Yifu and bainilatti turned their heads at the same time.

“Who’s there!”

“Mr. Xia!”

The two of them spoke at the same time, but after bainilatti subconsciously finished shouting, he looked at Xia ruofei with a face full of confusion.

There was a soul seal between bainilatti and Xia ruofei, so bainilatti knew that Xia ruofei had entered before he could see clearly. However, when he saw him clearly, he was dumbfounded. He did not know this person at all! Why does he have the same aura as master?

Li Yifu, on the other hand, could not tell Xia ruofei apart without him releasing his aura. His eyes were filled with vigilance.

Xia ruofei smiled and released a little of his cultivation aura. Then, he said,””Foster husband, I just changed my appearance, and you don’t recognize me anymore?”

Li Yifu’s body trembled and he quickly came forward and said,””Martial granduncle! You’ve returned ...”

When benilatti was sent over, Xia ruofei had told Li Yifu not to avoid him. Although Li Yifu did not understand, he treated Xia ruofei like a god. He would not doubt Xia ruofei’s words. Hence, even though benilatti was present, Li Yifu still called Xia ruofei “Grand – Master”.

Xia ruofei nodded and looked at bainilatti. He said lightly,””Your first reaction is not bad. Remember, you must trust your intuition in the future. It is often more reliable than your eyes!”

Only then did benilatti confirm that the middle – aged man in front of him was his master. He quickly nodded and said,””I understand! Mr. Xia ...”

Xia ruofei continued,”I will appear with this face for the next two days. I will be the HR Specialist of the peach blossom company’s headquarters. In the future, when there are outsiders, you can just call me Commissioner Xu.”

“Yes!” Li Yifu and bainilatti responded in unison.

Then, Xia ruofei looked at bainilatti and asked,””Did Wang Boshan contact you this morning?”

“Reporting to Mr. Xia, I only answered one phone call this morning. It was from a friend of mine in carnade.” “Wang Boshan didn’t contact me,” said benilatti.

Xia ruofei nodded. He didn’t need Li Yifu’s confirmation because under the effect of the soul seal, benilatti would definitely not lie to him.

Xia ruofei said,”if Wang Boshan asks you about the situation on Paradise Island, you can tell him that I didn’t appear on Paradise Island. However, paradise Corporation sent a personnel Commissioner with the surname Xu over. He assessed the current personnel on the island and arranged for more than half of the people to leave Paradise Island. Only the minimum number of people to maintain the operation of the island was left.” However, you can’t tell him this information for free ...”

“Yes! “I understand ...” Benilatti said.”You have to charge, and you have to increase the price!”

“That’s right!” Xia ruofei said,”you have to remember what I just said. Don’t make a mistake. This is very important.”

“Don’t worry, Mr. Xia. My memory has always been good!” Bainilatti said with a fawning smile.

“Wang Boshan will definitely ask you about the other situations on Peach Blossom Island.” Xia ruofei said,”you just need to tell him that the Chinese people who stayed here look mysterious and we don’t know what they are busy with. However, you will find out as soon as possible.”

“Yes, Mr. Xia!” Beniladi said.

After Xia ruofei gave his orders, he said indifferently,””Alright, you can go first!”

Just as he finished speaking, benilatti’s phone in the corner of the warehouse rang. Since he moved into this warehouse, he had never carried his phone with him. It had always been placed within Li Yifu’s sight.

Although Xia ruofei felt that it was unnecessary, he did not object to Li Yifu’s insistence on benilatti doing so.

When the phone rang, the three of them turned their heads in unison.

“Let’s go and see who’s attacking!” Xia ruofei said calmly.

“Yes!” Benilatti rushed over to take a look at the phone, then said in a trembling voice,”Mr ... Mr. Xia, it’s Wang Boshan ...”

Although the call was not connected, benilatti still subconsciously lowered his voice, as if he was afraid that Wang Boshan would hear him. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Bainilatti looked at Xia ruofei eagerly, waiting for his next instruction.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,””Don’t worry about him! Let’s talk after you catch your breath. ”

“Okay, but ... He’ll hang up if I don’t pick up!” Beniladi said.

“If I die, then I die!” Xia ruofei shrugged his shoulders and said,”he’s in a hurry to find you. He’ll definitely call back.”

“Yes! Yes!” Benilatti was indeed still panting heavily. Furthermore, Xia ruofei had just finished talking to him, so he was still a little nervous. It was not appropriate for him to answer the phone.

Benilatti took the phone and walked to Xia ruofei’s side. The phone was still ringing. Xia ruofei took the phone and glanced at it before throwing it on a wooden box.

Ten seconds later, the phone finally stopped ringing.
