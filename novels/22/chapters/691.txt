Chapter 692: Spatial herb garden (2)

“Master! I promise I won’t let you down!” Xia Qing stuck out her chest and said,”you only need to provide the seeds. Leave the rest to me!”

“Good! Make a list now!” Xia ruofei said.

Following that, Xia ruofei waved his hand. The paper and pen that were originally kept in the Archean realm immediately appeared in his hands.

Xia ruofei passed a pen and paper to Xia Qing. Xia Qing listed more than 30 kinds of Chinese medicinal herbs on the spot. They were all common medicinal herbs. It would not be difficult to find their seeds.

Xia ruofei folded the paper and put it in his pocket.””I’ll go buy the seeds as soon as I get out. Xia Qing, you can start the preparatory work now!”

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing said respectfully.

Xia Qing was originally a spirit puppet that assisted in the management of the spirit map world. Clearing the land, taking care of the spirit plants, planting medicinal herbs, and so on were all his “innate skills.” As a spirit puppet that was absolutely submissive, the joy of master giving him tasks was born from the bottom of his heart.

Xia ruofei then told Blackie and the others to stay in the medium. After the expansion of the farm was completed, he would take them out to have fun.

Then, with a thought, Xia ruofei left the space and kept the spirit map scroll in his palm.

Xia ruofei looked at the time. It was already past oneo’ clock in the afternoon and he had missed the meal time.

So, he went downstairs to the kitchen and made some noodles for himself.

Of course, he didn’t forget to get two eggs. With the tomatoes and cabbage produced by the space, a bowl of ordinary noodles with the magical vegetables in the space became extremely delicious in an instant.

Xia ruofei had already gotten rid of all the vegetables he had planted in the Archean realm. However, he still had a lot of vegetables that he had harvested in the past. He had stored them in a space that could keep them fresh forever so that he could eat the most authentic space vegetables whenever he needed them.

......

Xia ruofei had been away for seven to eight days, so he should have gone to the company to check on the progress, especially the preliminary review of the new medicine. However, it was lunch break and Xia ruofei did not want to disturb his employees.

So, he simply drove the pickup truck away from the farm and went straight to the seed company in the city.

The Sanshan seed company was the largest company in the entire Southeast province. They sold all the common seeds of Chinese medicine.

Xia ruofei followed Xia Qing’s list and bought all the seeds he needed at once.

There were more than 30 kinds of medicinal seeds, and he bought 5 catties of each. Xia ruofei felt that with so many seeds, it should be enough for Xia Qing’s use.

There were more than 50 kilograms of seeds. The expensive ones cost a few hundred Yuan per kilogram, and the cheaper ones only cost 10 to 20 yuan. Xia ruofei spent more than 5000 Yuan in total and left the city’s seed company with a big bag of sorted and packaged medicinal seeds.

Xia ruofei did not return to the farm immediately. Instead, he drove to the northern suburbs of San Shan city. There were many companies that sold farming machinery there.

Xia ruofei had taken into consideration that the planting area was so large that it would be very inefficient to rely on Xia Qing’s manpower to cultivate the land. Hence, he had driven over to see if there were any small machines that could be used.

After a round of shopping, Xia ruofei really had some gains.

A company called Dahua agricultural machinery was selling a kind of caterpillar track super – Small agricultural excavator for about 80000 Yuan.

Compared to those engineering hook machines that cost hundreds of thousands or even millions, this was a good price.

Although this kind of super – Small excavator was almost useless on the construction site, it was very suitable to be used to open up the medicine garden in the realm.

Xia ruofei bought one without any hesitation, and the other party even delivered it to his door.

Hence, Xia ruofei asked them to send the small excavator directly to the warehouse he rented in the city. He also bought a large barrel of diesel on the way.

In the warehouse, Xia ruofei took the excavator, diesel, and the seeds he had just bought into the medium.

Then, Xia ruofei used his mind to communicate with Xia Qing in the medium, telling him to deal with the seeds first and not to cultivate the land for the time being. Everything could be discussed after he entered the medium.

After that, Xia ruofei drove back to the farm.

When he returned to the farm, it was already three in the afternoon. He parked his car at the general building and went upstairs to Feng Jing’s office.

Thump thump thump!

Xia ruofei gently knocked on the door. Feng Jing looked up and saw Xia ruofei. She immediately stood up and smiled.”Mr. Chairman, you’re finally willing to return to the three mountains? I thought that you had fallen into the land of gentleness in the capital and had forgotten about home!” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Xia ruofei pretended to be serious and said,”what are you saying?” I’m doing official business in Beijing!”

“Haven’t we already finished our business?” Feng Jing grinned.”I heard from Xue Jinshan that the chairman personally came and got the approval in the same night. He was so domineering!”

Xia ruofei said helplessly,”I had other things to do in the capital. Didn’t I rush back as soon as I finished?”

“I don’t Dare to Care about you!” Feng Rao said with a smile. Besides, we’re all used to you going missing from time to time! Anyway, the company will still operate without a Chairman!”

“That’s right! It’s my fault for having such a capable general manager!” Xia ruofei asked with a smile,”President Feng, how’s the company these days?”
