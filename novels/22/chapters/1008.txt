Chapter 1009: You call this_problem?

Translator: 549690339

“Uncle, you won’t be able to help even if I tell you. That’s the capital!” Zhuo Yiyi said unhappily. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Song Wei’s heart skipped a beat as she smiled and said,”Yiyi, uncle song Rui might really be able to help you with that matter! Just tell me! If you don’t want to say it, I’ll say it!”

“Don ‘t!” Zhuo Yiyi hurriedly replied. Then, she smiled bitterly and helplessly.”Actually, it’s about work!”

As it turned out, Zhuo Yiyi’s grades were not as good as Song Wei ‘s, and she had no chance of getting a postgraduate recommendation. Moreover, she wanted to start working as soon as possible, so she had not taken the postgraduate entrance exam at all and had started looking for a job this semester.

Many of the students who were studying in the capital city hoped to stay and work there, and Zhuo Yiyi was no exception.

It wasn’t easy for an archaeologist to find a job. Even a graduate from a top university like Yanjing University didn’t have many choices.

However, Zhuo Yiyi did manage to find a job that was quite suitable for her. In fact, she quite liked it. It was the work of preserving cultural relics in Yanjing Museum.

This job suited her profession quite well. Besides, Zhuo Yiyi was also quite interested in the conservation of cultural relics. Even though she was currently applying for the Yanjing Museum, it would at most be an official job, but Zhuo Yiyi still signed up without hesitation.

A batch of resumes was eliminated, but since Zhuo Yiyi’s specialization was more suitable, she still successfully entered the written test.

After a period of serious preparation, Zhuo Yiyi successfully completed the written test, and her results were rather good. She was ranked second among all the applicants, and naturally, she entered the interview.

This time, Yanjing Museum recruited three people and more than ten people went for the interview.

Zhuo Yiyi felt that her major was more suitable, and her written test results were also very good. She had a high chance of getting this job.

While they were waiting for the interview, the girl named Gina, who had texted Zhuo Yiyi earlier, took the initiative to strike up a conversation with her. She asked about her school, major, written test results, and so on. She even took the initiative to add Zhuo Yiyi on WeChat.

Zhuo Yiyi had always been a carefree person, so she was not on guard against jin Na. Hence, she told jin Na about her situation.

After the interview, all they had to do was wait for the notice. Zhuo Yiyi, on the other hand, was bored in the capital. When she heard that Song Wei had moved to Sanshan, she decided to travel to Sanshan by herself. Initially, she thought that the results of the interview would not be out too soon, so she was prepared to go home and spend time with her parents.

She had not expected that Gina would be the one who had sent a message to Zhuo Yiyi, telling her in a flaunting tone that she had been hired.

Zhuo Yiyi immediately logged into Yanjing museum’s official website to check, and found that the recruitment Notice had indeed been released. Her name had fallen from the sky.

Among the three who were accepted, other than the first who won first place in the written test, the other two had very low written results, and Gina was one of them.

Moreover, Gina was only a Chinese major student at an ordinary University in the capital city. She had nothing to do with the conservation of cultural relics. Under such circumstances, she would usually be eliminated in the first round of screening. Yet, she had actually successfully passed the written test and interview. She had even been accepted even though she ranked last. Zhuo Yiyi would rather die than believe that there was nothing fishy about this.

Initially, Zhuo Yiyi had not wanted to say anything, but once she opened her mouth, she could not stop herself from telling him everything that had happened.

Then, she said angrily,”the establishment is really precious these days!” Even a government office like the Yanjing Museum had so many people trying to get in! This group of people probably didn’t even know what a cultural relic was, and they just wanted to occupy an establishment to do nothing! We, who are really learning this and love this industry, are being rejected! You really are ...”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Actually, it’s not necessarily the Yanjing museum’s problem. This is an institution with a strong academic atmosphere. If the higher authorities had asked, they wouldn’t have been able to stop them even if they wanted to!”

Song Wei nodded in agreement and said,”I think they probably only want to recruit one person, but they have to report three targets to be able to recruit one person!”

“Sigh ...” Zhuo Yiyi sighed and said,”I only realized how cruel reality is after I left the school ...”

Song Rui laughed and said,”this is called a problem?” Zhuo Yiyi, don’t worry, I’ll take care of it!”

Zhuo Yiyi was stunned for a moment. She turned to look at song Rui and asked,””Uncle, you’re not joking with me, right?”

“You’re already so anxious,” song Rui said, pouting.”I dare to make such a joke?”

Xia ruofei looked at song Rui through the rearview mirror and said with a smile,””Yiyi, don’t worry. Since song Rui has agreed to help, this matter will definitely not be a problem.”

“Yeah!” Song Wei immediately nodded in agreement. Yiyi, uncle song Rui will definitely be able to do it!”

Zhuo Yiyi was a little puzzled as she asked,”you guys are actually so confident in uncle?” Why do I feel that this matter is a little mysterious?”

Song Rui was so angry that he immediately took out his phone and said,””Zhuo Yiyi, just watch! If this matter isn’t settled before the plane takes off, then I, song Rui, am bragging!”

After that, song Rui pondered for a while and dialed a number on his phone. He said directly,””Qiangzi, you are familiar with the people in the Beijing cultural Bureau. Help me do something! I have a friend who applied for the position of cultural relic conservation in Yanjing Museum. She ranked second in the written test, but she was not accepted in the end! This is too much of a bully!”
