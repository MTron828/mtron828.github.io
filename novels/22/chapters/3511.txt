Translator: 549690339

Xue Jinshan couldn’t help but break out in a cold sweat. He quickly said,”Yes! Chairman, this is my negligence, 1 ask for punishment! Such a situation will never happen again in the future. From tomorrow onwards, 1 will personally run the channels! Right, I have another idea. There’s a land transfer in Changping County, and the company’s cash flow is quite abundant now. Do you think we can rent a piece of land and grow our own Chinese medicinal herbs? This way, we’ll be able to control a portion of the raw material channels and the price won’t be restricted by others!”

After Xia ruofei heard this, he couldn’t help but secretly nod. It was obvious that Xue Jinshan had reflected on the problem of raw materials.

This was also one of the reasons why he valued Xue Jinshan. Although Xue Jinshan was from the medical profession, he was very active in thinking. He also had a lot of ideas about business management and was willing to use his brain.

However, Xia ruofei had no interest in these things. He laughed and said,””You don’t have to tell me about this. You can report it directly to President Feng. Don’t forget that I’m no longer in charge of this …”

Feng Rao didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.”Chairman, you … This is your own company! Why do i feel like you can’t wait to get rid of the burden? After this meeting, you’re going to be a hands – off shopkeeper!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”why not?” I’ve been waiting for this day for a long time, okay? Now, I can finally push all the trouble to you!”

Feng Rao and Xue Jinshan could not help but look at each other and smile bitterly.

However, Feng Rao quickly told Xue Jinshan,””Factory manager Xue, that’s a good idea. Take the time to form a text and consider all aspects of the problem, including the local land transfer policy, land acquisition compensation standards, the size of the plantation, the total investment budget, and the expected production, etc. As detailed as possible. You report to me first, and then we will hold a management meeting for a collective discussion! If there’s no problem, then quickly implement it!”

Feng Jing had already started to avoid arousing suspicion. Although Xia ruofei had given her a lot of autonomy, she still tried her best to make decisions as a group when it came to the use of large funds and adjustments to the company’s strategy.

“Alright!” Xue Jinshan quickly replied. I’m already working on the relevant proposal, and it should be perfected soon!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Okay, okay. You can discuss these work matters after you go down.” Jinshan, I’ve only asked you to stay for one thing today, and that’s the matter of the raw medicinal herbs. 1 heard that you’re running out of rice to put into the pot? I’m here to send you charcoal in the snow!” “Thank you, Chairman!” Xue Jinshan said excitedly.

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”elder Zheng will be in charge of the raw materials in the future. It’s also part of his job.” In the future, he’ll hand over a batch of medicinal ingredients to you every month! You two exchange contact information first. This batch of medicinal herbs will be handed over to the previous warehouse at 8 am tomorrow! Is there a problem?”

“No problem! No problem!” Xue Jinshan hurriedly said.

Then he quickly said to Zheng Yongshou,””Director Zheng, sorry for the trouble! Please take care of me in the future!”

After he finished speaking, he stretched out his hands towards Zheng Yongshou.

Zheng Yongshou shook Xue Jinshan’s hand and squeezed out a smile,”Factory manager Xue, you’re too kind. This is my job! 1 hope we can work together happily in the future!”

Zheng Yongshou was still not used to the polite way of communication in the secular world, but he was already trying to adapt.

“Happy cooperation! Happy cooperation!” Xue Jinshan said.

Then the two exchanged contact information. Xue Jinshan had a business card, but Zheng Yongshou naturally didn’t. There was only a phone number and WeChat, which Zheng Yongshou saved seriously. After adding each other as friends on WeChat, he excitedly left.

Xia ruofei heaved a sigh of relief. Feng Rao, who was beside him, could not help but laugh and say,””You’ve finally gotten rid of all your burdens. You feel relaxed, right?”

“Is it really that obvious?” Xia ruofei chuckled.

Feng Rao and Zheng Yongshou both nodded seriously. Xia ruofei kept his smile and said seriously,”Alright! Then 1’11 be more serious!”

Feng Rao laughed and said,”alright!” Stop pretending … Chairman, 1 still have something to report to you …”

“I’ve already…”

“Listen to me first! 1 need to ask for your opinion on this matter!” Feng ke said.

Xia ruofei said,”alright!” You say, you say…”

“You’re giving me all the decision – making power of the company. I feel like I’m carrying too much on my shoulders. What if 1 don’t manage the company well…” Feng Jing said.”So, 1 think that from now on, some important matters should be discussed by the Board of Directors before they decide together! 1 think 1 need to make some adjustments to the Board of Directors …”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said with a faint smile,””Sister ran, you’re not afraid of carrying a heavy burden, but you want to avoid suspicion!”

“No…” Feng Jing said weakly.

“There’s really no need for that. Since I’m handing the company over to you, it means that 1 trust you, your ability, and your character …” Xia ruofei said.

“I know, but… For a company to develop healthily, it’s best to work together on important decisions.” Feng Jing replied seriously,”! can’t even guarantee that every decision 1 make is right. People always make mistakes!”

Xia ruofei said helplessly,”alright!” If you think this is a good model, then we’ll do it according to your ideas … How about this! I appoint you as the Vice – Chairman of the company and you will be in charge of the Board of Directors!” Feng Rao hesitated for a moment before saying,”sure!” I’ll be drafting a company constitution for the Board of Directors in the next two days, and I’ll ask you to approve it… You won’t be leaving the three mountains in two or three days, will you?”

“1 don’t think so!” Xia ruofei said,”then it’s decided. Sister ran, you should hurry up!”

If Feng Rao wanted to draft this article, she would definitely need Xia ruofei’s signature. Otherwise, she would be both an athlete and a referee. Xia ruofei also knew that Feng Jing’s article would determine paradise corporation’s future operation model. It would be perfectly justifiable for him to personally sign and issue it. In this way, he would not need to be involved in the daily management of the company in the future.

“Alright, I’ll try my best…” Feng Jing nodded.”Chairman, do you have any other plans this afternoon?”

Xia ruofei said,”I still have something to do with elder Zheng. 1 won’t be staying in the company. Sister che, you can go and do your work!” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Feng Rao’s heart felt empty, but she still pretended to be relaxed. She squeezed out a smile and said,”Alright! I’ll send you guys off!”

the group walked out of the board meeting room, turned a corner, and arrived at the elevator reserved for senior executives, feng jing pressed the elevator door open and forced a smile.”the elevator is here, chairman, then … goodbye!” xia ruofei led zheng yongshou into the elevator, the moment before the door closed, he pressed the elevator door and said with a smile,””sister ran, don’t look so serious! it’s not like we’re going to say goodbye forever…”

“pei pei pei! you’re not allowed to jinx us!” feng rao quickly said.

“hahaha! what i mean is that i’ll come to the company every now and then to give you more autonomy, i just hope that the company can develop smoothly, so that you don’t have to ask me for instructions and miss the opportunity when you can’t contact me …”xia ruofei said casually,” besides, don’t we live in the same community? we’ll have many more chances to meet in the future!”

feng rao’s mood improved after hearing xia ruofei’s words, she smiled and said,””! know! you should get busy! i have to go and make a plan!”

then, she waved at xia ruofei and turned to walk towards her office..
