Chapter 431: Chapter 375 – in jail again (3)

Perhaps it was because of the danger that day, Xia ruofei’s emotions became agitated. He took a deep breath and continued,””Do you know that if I had been a minute late, my friend would have been ruined by that scumbag! Why did I hit him so hard? Because I’m racing against time! If I wasn’t ruthless, how could I have asked for my friend’s whereabouts at the first moment?”

“Also, did you guys see the scene that day? There were whips, candles, and collars in that room. It was obviously made for that scumbag’s sexual pleasure. Who knows how many victims there were before!” Xia ruofei continued,”have you checked these?”

Qin Xiao Yu was also slightly moved. She looked at Xia ruofei with a complicated expression and said,””We don’t understand the situation you’re talking about, but we’ll investigate it. If Fang Luo and the others are suspected of committing crimes, they’ll be severely punished by the law after they’re discharged! I can understand that you’re in a hurry to save your friend, but you shouldn’t have crippled him. It’s not worth it to sacrifice yourself for those hooligans. ”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,””Officer Qin, you haven’t been a police officer for long, have you?”

Qin Xiao Yu was stunned for a moment. Her attitude had softened a little, but after hearing Xia ruofei’s words, she couldn’t help but glare at Xia ruofei and said,””Is this any of your business?”

In fact, Xia ruofei was right. Although Qin Xiaoyu was the Deputy Captain, she had not been in the police force for long. In fact, she had only been in the Sanshan Public Security Bureau for two months.

In other words, Qin Xiaoyu’s frontline work experience was actually very lacking, which was why she had such a big reaction to Xia ruofei’s words.

Xia ruofei smiled faintly and said,”I think an old policeman should be able to easily tell what it means for Fang Luo to be so lawless!” Besides, I don’t hold grudges, because I usually take revenge on the spot, especially for that kind of scumbag. If I don’t personally cripple him, how can I avenge the girls who were victims in the past, and how can I vent my anger for my friend?”

“You ... This is a society ruled by law. Your way of thinking is very dangerous!” Qin Xiao Yu said.

These words were a bit of heartfelt advice. Qin Xiao Yu knew that Xia ruofei was very skilled and was even a retired soldier. If such a person’s thoughts went to the extreme, he would seriously endanger society and become an extremely unstable factor, like a time bomb. That was why she consciously gave some advice.

Xia ruofei smiled and did not say anything.

He could tell that Qin Xiao Yu was just a greenhouse flower who grew up in an ivory tower. She had never seen the cruelty of the outside world, and her words and actions revealed a sense of idealism.

Qin Xiao Yu saw that Xia ruofei was not listening to her and sighed in her heart. She then said,””Do you have anything else to say about this case? We’ll record everything down for you. ”

Xia ruofei said,”everything that happened to my friend at the bar was recorded by the bar’s surveillance camera. I’ve already edited the video. I hope it will be helpful for your investigation.”

“Oh? Where’s the video? Do you still have the original surveillance data?” Qin Xiao Yu immediately perked up and asked.

As the police officer did not handcuff Xia ruofei, he could move his hands freely. He put his hands into his pockets to pull out the USB with the edited surveillance video.

Qin Xiao Yu and the police officer in charge of recording were shocked. Qin Xiao Yu shouted,””Don’t move! Slowly take your hands out of your pockets, then raise them up ...”

Xia ruofei’s action of taking out his pocket reminded Qin Xiao Yu that Xia ruofei was a “dangerous person”, so she was extremely nervous.

Xia ruofei showed an expression of not knowing whether to laugh or cry. He slowly took his hand out of his pocket and showed Qin Xiaoyu the USB drive in his palm.””Officer Qin, don’t worry, I’m just taking out the video USB ...”

Qin Xiao Yu also felt that her reaction just now was a little too big, and showed a trace of embarrassment.

She gestured to the police officer beside her. The police officer immediately took Xia ruofei’s USB drive and inserted it into the computer’s USB port. He then copied the video that Xia ruofei had edited into the computer that was recording the statement.

Qin Xiaoyu motioned for the police to open the video. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

The video started playing. It showed Lu You hesitating at the entrance of the bar before walking in.

The moment Qin Xiao Yu saw Lu You’s figure, her eyes narrowed and revealed a look of disbelief ...
