2326 A new train of thought (1)

Xia ruofei went straight to the mountain sea realm and saw Bao Guijun, Qian guiyou, and the others digging the drain of the herb garden under Xia Qing’s lead. They were all sweating profusely and looked like they had been doing it for a while.

“Everyone, stop!” Xia ruofei clapped his hands and said.

Xia Qing immediately came over with Bao Guijun and the others. Xia Qing called out respectfully,””Master!”

Bao Guijun and the others also bowed,”Mr. Xia!”

Xia ruofei waved his hand, and a few large boxes containing the parts of the iron – Framed bed were lifted by an invisible force.

Bao Guijun and the others had already seen Xia ruofei’s magical means, so they were not surprised by this scene. They were still in awe.

Xia ruofei said,”pack these beds first. You can rest for today. I’ll make some appropriate improvements to your living conditions later.” Xia Qing, bring them a set of tools. ”

Bao Guijun and the rest thanked him profusely. They were prepared to sleep on the ground, but they did not expect Xia ruofei to be so “kind”.

Xia Qing took out a set of tools and gave them to Bao Guijun and the others. Then, they simply flattened a small piece of land in the area that Xia ruofei had marked out next to the herb garden. Then, they started to install the iron frame bed there.

Xia ruofei was not in a hurry to leave the medium. Instead, he handed over the living supplies he had purchased to Xia Qing and said,””You’ll be in charge of these things and distribute them according to their performance. In the future, we can refine a standard, such as how much work we can complete, how many points we can get, and then use the points to exchange for living supplies. ”

Xia ruofei also planned to buy some more advanced resources for basic survival. It was equivalent to having some enjoyment on top of the basic survival.

Of course, these things required a lot of points to exchange for. This would give Bao Guijun and the others more motivation to work.

Xia ruofei had not spent so much effort on this just for the five free laborers.

He had a rough plan in his heart – the scope of the spirit map space was getting larger and larger – and it was impossible for Xia Qing to manage it alone, so it was imperative to increase the manpower.

On the other hand, the spirit map space was Xia ruofei’s absolute secret. He couldn’t even reveal it to the people closest to him, which created a contradiction.

However, mord’s assassination team had given Xia ruofei a new idea.

There were many sinful people in this world who could die a hundred times without being wronged. In the past, Xia ruofei didn’t think that these people had anything to do with him. This time, in order to not leave any traces, he directly sent Bao Guijun and the rest into the spirit map space. This gave him an idea.

He could use this method to increase the manpower in the spirit map space, which would greatly speed up the construction of the space.

Moreover, he didn’t have any psychological burden by doing this. As long as he didn’t Rob ordinary people and only targeted assassin organizations and mercenary organizations, he could even be said to be doing good!

Xia ruofei had to confront the Morde organization in order to dig out the mastermind behind the attack. It would be easy to recruit a group of free labor.

When they had more manpower, they would naturally need to set up rules.

In fact, Xia ruofei had already started on this matter.

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing nodded.

Anyway, he would do whatever Xia ruofei said and did not need to think too much.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”by the way, these people are all ordinary people. They can’t work continuously like you. They still need a certain amount of rest time. You have to make arrangements.”

After that, he found an electronic clock in the pile of supplies and said,””In the future, the management of these few people will arrange their work and rest according to this time.”

This was an electronic clock with Arabic numerals. As long as it was constantly used in the mountain sea realm, it would be synchronized with the time in the outside world. There was no day and night in this space. If he didn’t prepare a clock like this, it would be hard to arrange his work and rest time.

As for the Arabic numbers on it, it wasn’t complicated. Xia ruofei only needed to teach it once, and Xia Qing had already mastered it.

In fact, it was just dividing two hours into two hours, and then each hour into sixty minutes. In addition, Arabic numbers were used instead of Chinese characters. The rest of the time was no different from the ancient way of telling time. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

As for the dry batteries used for the electronic clock, Xia ruofei had bought a lot of them. A pair of batteries could last for a few months, and the pile of batteries could last for a few years.

Xia Qing looked at the electronic clock with some curiosity and nodded,””I understand, master. Then wake up at 6:30 every day and start working at 7:00. He would rest from 12 to 1 p.m. And then work from 1 p.m. To 6 p.m. What do you think?”

Xia Qing had quickly gotten used to the new way of counting time, and her expression was also very accurate.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”sure.” In addition, looking at their work performance, if they were very active, they could rest for half a day every seven days. Hmm ... We can tell them this too, so that they have some hope. ”

Such a work and rest arrangement was naturally very harsh. He had to work ten hours a day, and it was all heavy physical work.

However, Bao Guijun and the rest were Xia ruofei’s captives. To put it bluntly, they were no different from slaves. There was no eight – hour work system, two – day rest days, and so on.
