Chapter 560: Iron – skinned Kaede fight (3)

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh when he saw this. He didn’t care if anyone was slandering the Eight Immortals! The effect he wanted was to attract everyone’s attention, and from the looks of it, it was obviously very successful.

Xia ruofei was very confident in the quality of Drunken Eight Immortals. He believed that as long as those people really drank Drunken Eight Immortals, they would definitely become fans or even anti – fans.

Xia ruofei was very satisfied with Li Jing’s work. He even called him to encourage him and to find out about the current sales.

In the end, Xia ruofei was pleasantly surprised. Within a few days, the sales of Drunken Eight Immortals had soared again. There were less than ten thousand boxes left in the warehouse, and more than two – thirds of the wine had been sent to the major channels.

According to Li Jing’s calculations, at least half of the 20000 boxes of wine had already been sold. This was even if some channels had limited the purchase in order to ensure the supply. Otherwise, they might have been sold out.

Furthermore, Walmart, Hualian, and other large chain stores also took the initiative to contact the winery, hoping to establish a long – term partnership.

Li Jing had already received instructions from Xia ruofei and Ling Xiaotian. He knew that due to production limitations, the winery’s main goal was to cooperate with these large channels. Thus, he was very active in the negotiations. These channels had already analyzed the potential of Drunken Eight Immortals, so they took the initiative to make many concessions in terms of entrance fees, Commission, and other aspects. The negotiations were progressing very smoothly.

Xia ruofei was very happy and gave full recognition to Li Jing’s work. At the same time, he also instructed him to speed up the construction of e – commerce channels and strive to open the flagship store of Skycat as soon as possible. Both sides would go hand in hand.

……

In the next half a month, Xia ruofei mainly stayed in the farm. He would patrol the construction site every day or visit master Luo’s place. He would also deal with some daily company affairs. Occasionally, he would return to the city to spend some time with Ling Qingxue. His days were very leisurely.

Very soon, master Luo finished processing the last batch of iron – Skin Dendrobium.

Originally, the iron maples had to be sorted according to their grades, but the raw materials this time were too good. Almost all the finished iron maples were of the best quality, so there was no need to sort them out at all. They were all put into a big bag. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Xia ruofei organized a group of people to carry over a pound of these iron maples. In the end, he obtained 136 kilograms of finished products, which was slightly more than the expected output.

Xia ruofei gave master Luo a red packet of 20000 Yuan and instructed pang Hao to give additional bonuses to all the workers who participated in the production of the iron – Skin maple.

Master Luo declined several times, saying that boss Qian had already given him his salary and travel allowance, so he could not take any more money from Xia ruofei.

However, Xia ruofei’s attitude was very firm. He said that boss Qian was giving him his salary, and the red packet was a token of his sincerity. The two could not be mixed together. Master Luo couldn’t reject it and could only accept Xia ruofei’s Red packet in the end.

After the first production of the iron – Skin maples came to an end, Xia ruofei gave President Lin of Tongren Hall a call.

After President Lin heard about it, he immediately said that he would personally bring people to the three mountains to buy them all.

Xia ruofei considered the fact that he still had to send the five employees to boss Qian’s place to learn. He had also promised Qian Lijun that he would go over to meet his comrades. Hence, he did not ask CEO Lin to come over and said that he would send them to Qiantang.

Then, Xia ruofei asked the workers to load the big bag of iron maples into his Knight XV off – Road vehicle and bought train tickets for five employees. He took master Luo in the off – Road vehicle and went straight to Jiangsu and Zhejiang Province in two groups.
