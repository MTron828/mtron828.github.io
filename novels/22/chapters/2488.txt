2489 Screening (2)

“I’ll remember that, Chairman!” Xue Jinshan laughed.

Following that, Xue Jinshan immediately asked,”Chairman, the work here has temporarily come to an end. I want to fly back to San Shan tonight ...”

“What’s wrong?” Xia ruofei frowned slightly and said,”didn’t I say to strike a balance between work and rest? Why are you in such a hurry?”

Xue Jinshan quickly explained,”the factory construction in Changping is also in progress. Didn’t you arrange for me to go to Spain for a vacation?” I have to hurry back and hand over some work! “In addition, we need to send some capable people to Qiantang to preside over the subsequent modification and debugging work ...”

In fact, Xue Jinshan just wanted to rush back to San Shan as soon as possible. This way, he could personally keep an eye on the Changping construction site for a few days. Of course, the factors that he had mentioned were also present. He had personally handled a lot of work in the past, and now he had to carefully select capable subordinates to take over.

Xia ruofei pondered for a moment.”You can go back if you want, but you have to rest for one night. We’ll go back tomorrow!”

“Chairman ...”

“It’s decided then!” After Xia ruofei finished speaking, he ignored Xue Jinshan and turned to Dong Yun.”Director Dong, hurry up and arrange the team’s rotation. Try not to affect your work. In addition, I’ll meet with the middle management and technical backbone who want to stay tomorrow. You organize the personnel. ”

“Yes, Chairman!” Dong Yun replied.

After the arrangements were made, Xia ruofei returned to the guest house that Dong Yun had arranged for him to rest. Dong Yun, Xue Jinshan, and the rest went their separate ways. Wang Jian and Lu Weifeng also left the pharmaceutical Group as if they had been pardoned.

Xia ruofei did not plan to hold a Grand handover ceremony, and the Liu family naturally did not want to publicize this matter. Hence, after the handover of the entire Pharmaceutical Group was completed, Xia ruofei’s arrival today marked the completion of the handover.

After dealing with the last scene, Wang Jian and Lu Weifeng left the pharmaceutical Group and went directly to the airport. If there were no special circumstances, they would not come back again.

However, they did not know how their new work arrangements would be when they returned to Beijing this time. Thinking of how they had secretly obstructed the handover work according to Liu Lifang’s instructions some time ago and how things had gotten out of hand, Wang Jian felt that his future would be bleak when he returned to Beijing.

Xia ruofei politely declined Dong Yun’s suggestion to have someone bring him to Qiantang for a tour. In the afternoon, he rested in the best suite in the guest house. In the evening, after having dinner at the group’s restaurant, he took a walk in the factory area and returned to the guest house.

At night, Xia ruofei didn’t cultivate. After all, he wasn’t at home. He didn’t want to enter the spirit map space here. Cultivating outside would consume spiritual crystals or origin crystals, and Xia ruofei felt that it was a waste.

He watched TV in his room for a while and went to bed early.

The next morning, Xia ruofei met with the middle – Level leaders and technical backbones of the former Pharmaceutical Group who clearly wanted to stay in the conference room of the guest house.

As for the top management of the corporation, almost 100% of them were from the Liu family. Naturally, they would not stay. Even if they wanted to stay, Xia ruofei would not want them.

Xia ruofei had also considered that in such a large Pharmaceutical Group, if the middle management and technical backbone were all gone, it would not be easy to fill the vacancy. These people were originally working here. If there were no problems, he would welcome them to stay.

What he did was naturally to screen for people with ulterior motives.

As for the professionals and management skills, Feng Jing, Dong Yun, and Xue Jinshan would be in charge of them.

Only those who could pass him would be qualified to accept the professional interview.

There were a total of 26 people who had come for Xia ruofei’s “interview” today. Everyone was gathered in one room waiting. Qin Yanan took the name list and called them to Xia ruofei’s side for the interview.

Everyone was a little apprehensive and worried about their personal gains and losses. Since they were able to come here, they naturally wanted to stay and work. Today was the personal interview of the boss of paradise Corporation. They were not sure if they would be able to catch Xia ruofei’s eye.

When someone came out of the meeting room and returned to the room, the people waiting immediately surrounded them and asked nervously about the interview.

They were all colleagues, and in theory, there was no competition in this interview. If they passed, they could all stay, so there was no need to worry.

However, those who had been interviewed were also dumbfounded.

Because Xia ruofei only asked a few simple questions, as if they were having a casual conversation, and then they ended the interview in a daze. They did not even know if they passed or not.

A few people returned to the waiting room in a row, and the situation was the same.

Those who had not been interviewed were even more uncertain.

Actually, Xia ruofei’s method was very simple. He just used his spiritual power to hypnotize the interviewees. This kind of hypnosis was not as strong as the one he used to extort a confession from them. There was no need to use that kind of strength to deal with ordinary people. However, the hypnotized person would have no impression of what happened during the hypnosis process. Their memory would be blank. However, Xia ruofei’s questioning time was very short and the questions were very simple. He also used some small tricks. These interviewees did not even realize that they had been hypnotized.

In fact, some powerful hypnotists could also achieve the same effect. However, with the help of Xia ruofei’s spiritual power, it was easier. He did not need to choose an easy target to hypnotize. As long as the target was an ordinary person and not a cultivator of spiritual power, he would not fail.

Hence, Xia ruofei’s interview speed was very fast. In less than an hour, all 26 people had been tested by him. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Dong Yun asked the interviewees to go back and wait for the news. Xia ruofei had not made it clear who would stay and who would leave. She did not know if Xia ruofei would make a decision immediately, so she asked the interviewees to go back.

When Dong Yun knocked on the door and entered the meeting room, she saw Xia ruofei scribbling on the interview list with a pencil.

Xia ruofei raised his head and saw Dong Yun walking in. He smiled and waved,”President Dong, come, come, come!”

Dong Yun walked to Xia ruofei’s side. Xia ruofei handed the list to Dong Yun and said,”This ... This ... And this, I don’t want these three people! As for the remaining 23 people, you can go through the professional ability interview as soon as possible. If they meet the requirements, let them stay!”

Seeing that Xia ruofei had made up his mind, Dong Yun did not ask any further. She nodded and said,””Alright! You’ve worked hard, Chairman. Leave the rest of the work to us!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”I’m going back to San Shan in the afternoon. I’ll leave it to you to arrange the work here.” In addition, the employees of our handover team should also arrange their follow – up work and leave as soon as possible. The company will organize them to get their visas in the next two days! You have to go too!”

Dong Yun was stunned for a moment and said with a smile,””Chairman, I think I’ll pass ...”

“I said, not a single one less!” Xia ruofei said,”you’re the leader of this team. How can we leave you out? I’ll put aside the company’s work for a week at most, so I’ll still be able to free myself. ”

“Alright! Thank you, Chairman!” Dong Yun nodded and said.

Xia ruofei returned to his room after handing the list to Dong Yun.

He was very satisfied with the interview because it turned out that such a screening was necessary. Didn’t he find three problematic people?

Xia ruofei’s eyes glinted coldly when he thought about the interview process. However, he quickly hid it and mumbled to himself,””I’ll let them go this time. If they still don’t give up, then I won’t be polite anymore ...”
