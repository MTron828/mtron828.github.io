2898 The eastern immortal (1)

The distance of about ten kilometers was very close to Xia ruofei’s sword Kinesis flight. Hence, Xia ruofei had actually arrived long ago.

However, he did not appear immediately.

With Xia ruofei’s cultivation level, even Qi refinement realm cultivators or beginner golden core realm cultivators wouldn’t be able to detect him if he wanted to hide his aura, let alone the ordinary people on the ship.

Naturally, Davis, Charlie and the rest were completely oblivious. They had no idea that on the left side of the yacht, a Huaxia golden core stage cultivator was standing on a flying sword and floating above the sea.

The yacht was very big. The water surface was more than ten meters high. Xia ruofei stood on his flying sword and floated quietly in the air on the left side of the yacht. To the people on the second deck, they would not be able to see Xia ruofei unless they stuck their heads out and looked down.

And in this dark night, on the boundless sea, who would be so bored as to look down from the deck railing?

The clouds were very thick today. After the sun had set, the visibility on the sea was very low. Even if they looked down, they couldn’t see anything, not even the value of admiring the scenery.

Xia ruofei only laughed when Davis was about to make his move on Charlie.

He originally wanted to show up immediately, but Davis and his subordinates began to be suspicious. He had indeed done something wrong!

Xia ruofei continued to step on the flying sword with interest, waiting to see the reaction of Davis and the others.

When Davis was finally angered by Charlie’s words and was about to shoot at Charlie, Xia ruofei made his move.

How could an ordinary person like Dai Weisi possibly escape from the restraints of an early jiedan stage cultivator’s spiritual power?

So no matter how hard he pulled the trigger, almost breaking his finger, the trigger didn’t move at all, and even the pistol seemed to be stuck to his hand.

The veins on Davis’s face bulged as he roared,””What are you guys doing? Immediately kill Charlie!”

Originally, the few big men were confused when they saw Davis’s performance, but after hearing Davis’s words, they seemed to wake up from a dream. They quickly pulled out the guns from their waists and aimed them at Charlie.

As a result, these big men were also in a tragedy. Like Davis, no matter how hard they pulled the trigger, they couldn’t pull it. They also couldn’t shake off the pistol no matter how hard they tried.

Charlie’s face was full of surprise as he looked at Davis and the few big men.

Could it be that the spirits of hessilin and the others had really appeared?

Charlie wasn’t afraid of Qingqing at all. He had already escaped from the gates of hell. Could there be a worse outcome than that?

If Xia ruofei knew that Charlie had treated him like a ghost, he would definitely give him a good slap.

You’re the ghost! If I didn’t appear in time, no one would respond to you in this vast ocean, and your whole family would become ghosts!

After Xia ruofei had enough fun, he activated the blue immortal sword under his feet.

The blue travel immortal sword lifted Xia ruofei up slowly. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Xia ruofei had already altered his appearance to a certain extent. He was now the young man named “Xia Tian” from the time he went to Italy.

Soon, Davis and the others saw a scene that they would never forget.

A young Chinese man in casual clothes with a relaxed smile on his face slowly emerged from the left side of the yacht. Then, his body slumped and he didn’t move at all, as if he was on an elevator.

But ... It was the F * cking ocean outside! There might not be a ship passing by here for years, and the second deck was at least ten meters above the sea. Where did this person come from?

Xia ruofei’s body continued to rise, and Davis and the others widened their eyes.

They saw that Xia ruofei was floating in the air. There was nothing under his feet. The flying sword itself was not an ordinary object. It could be kept in the dantian to be nourished. As long as Xia ruofei willed it, ordinary people would not be able to see the existence of this flying sword. So, to them, Xia ruofei seemed to be floating in the air and was still rising.

Could This Be Magic? The same thought appeared in the minds of Davis and the others.

How could a magician suddenly appear in the vast and remote sea at night? Besides, magic tricks relied on props. Even the best magician couldn’t do what this young Chinese man in front of him did!

It was natural for people to be afraid of the unknown.

Especially Davis, who had done something wrong, the fear in his heart could not be any greater.

As for Charlie, he wasn’t the least bit afraid that Qingqing would die at the worst. He wouldn’t face a worse outcome. The appearance of this young Chinese man was undoubtedly a variable. No matter what the result of this variable was, it was a profit for Charlie.

At least he lived for a few more minutes, didn’t he?

Moreover, the strange behavior of Davis and the others was clearly related to this young Chinese man. In other words, it was this magical young Chinese man who stopped Davis from killing him.

In that case, he might be able to survive!

Charlie’s heart was suddenly filled with a strong sense of hope.

“Eastern deity!” Charlie blurted out.

When he was in University, he had chosen to study Chinese culture. At that time, he was only in his twenties. He had long yearned for the immortals in Chinese mythology. In the myths and legends of Huaxia, those Immortals could ride the clouds and even move mountains and fill the seas. They had all kinds of magical powers, which made people even more fascinated.
