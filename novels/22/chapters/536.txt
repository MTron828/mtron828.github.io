Chapter 537: The perfect engraving_2

Xia ruofei quickly retracted his spiritual power.

He placed the freshly – made soul puppet core into the stone room in the spirit map space. Then, he cleaned up the table and floor that were covered with Jade chips and went to take a shower again.

It was already past eleveno’ clock at night when she came out again.

Xia ruofei lay down on the bed. He had used up a lot of energy just now, so he started to snore after a while. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

……

The next day, Xia ruofei went to the office early in the morning and left for a while. He was too embarrassed to continue being a hands – off manager. Besides, after going abroad, there was still a lot of work to be arranged. He definitely would not do it himself, but at least he had to arrange the tasks well!

Not long after Xia ruofei entered the office, Feng Jing knocked on the door and walked in.

“Good Morning, President Feng!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Good Morning!” Feng Jing walked to Xia ruofei’s desk and said with a smile,”Chairman, it seems that you’ve gained a lot from this inspection!” I see that you’re all red ...”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but rub his nose and thought,”The harvest this time was indeed not small. He had conquered a Western Horse! But ... Was it really that obvious?

“CEO Feng, how’s the company these few days that I wasn’t at home?” Xia ruofei cleared his throat and asked.

“Everything is going smoothly!” Feng Jing said,”I’m here to report on the company’s operations over the past few days.”

“Okay, tell me!” Xia ruofei nodded.

Feng Jing opened the folder and reported to Xia ruofei everything that had happened in the company over the past few days.

Feng Jing’s report was very clear, including the production and sales of vegetables, the company’s income and expenditure accounts, as well as some important daily management matters, such as the progress of recruitment and so on.

Xia ruofei did not leave for long, so Feng Jing only took six to seven minutes to report the situation. Then, she closed the folder and looked at Xia ruofei.””Chairman, that’s the general situation. The company’s operations continue to be good, and I personally think highly of our future development!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”this means you have good taste!” Choosing our company is definitely the best decision you’ve ever made in your life!”

Feng Jing pursed her lips into a smile. Xia ruofei’s words sounded like he was trying to sell her melons. However, after thinking about it carefully, it seemed like he was right. At least Feng Jing was getting more and more confident in the company.

Xia ruofei leaned back in her chair and said,””Boss Feng, I’ve brought back some good news from my trip to Australia.”

“Oh, really? Hurry up and tell me!”

“Our company’s subsidiary, Hunter Valley’s Paradise Farm, will be experimenting with planting paradise vegetables in the near future. We plan to change our business strategy within half a year, from animal breeding to vegetable planting.” Xia ruofei said,”once the experiment is successful, there will be at least 4500 hectares of land used to grow the Paradise vegetables!”

Feng Rao was very excited. She clenched her fists and said,””That’s great! Chairman, if this plan succeeds, it will bring us a lot of cash flow!”

Feng Jing couldn’t help but be excited. If Tao Yuan farm was still a small scale farm, then the scale of Australia’s farm was quite large.

To make an intuitive comparison, Taoyuan farm, including the newly rented land, only had an area of about 120 mu, which was about 8 hectares. If Paradise Farm had 4500 hectares of land for growing Peach Garden vegetables, that would be equivalent to 500 to 600 Peach Garden Farms!

Moreover, that 4500 hectares was purely for planting, while Taoyuan farm included many auxiliary facilities.

Feng Jing was well aware of the extremely high selling price of the Paradise vegetables. In fact, it could be sold at an even higher price in Australia. Just imagining the scene of 4500 hectares of land being filled with paradise vegetables made Feng Jing’s head spin.

After the initial excitement, Feng Rao started to worry about her gains and losses.

“Chairman, then ... Is the success rate of the experimental planting high?” she could not help but ask.

This was the key to the success of the planting plan, and it was also what Feng Jing was most concerned about.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,””This is the task I was going to give you.”

Xia ruofei took a sip of water and continued,””The key to planting the Paradise vegetables is in the seeds. I have the complete technology on hand. As long as you use the seeds I provide, there is a high chance that you can successfully grow the Paradise vegetables in Australia!”

Feng Rao’s eyes lit up and she heaved a sigh of relief.”Then there’s no problem! Chairman, the mission you’re talking about is ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,””The hereditary traits of the Peach Orchard vegetables will completely disappear after the generation gap, so Paradise Farm needs me to provide a steady supply of seeds. I’ve already agreed with my partners that Paradise Farm will import seeds from our paradise company in the name of Paradise Farm. This will be a normal mechanism, and the relevant procedures will be completed by someone in Australia. What you need to do is to contact manager Liang of Paradise Farm in time to ensure the safety of the seeds and to ship them to Australia in time!”

“No problem!” Feng Rao immediately replied. I will personally follow up on this matter in the future! This is our company’s top priority!”

Xia ruofei nodded.”I’ll give you manager Liang’s contact information later. You can contact him today. We’ll send the first batch of seeds over as soon as possible!”
