3291 Puppets also cheat people (2)

There was also a rider on the street, who was also frozen in place. The rider was lying on the back of the horse, while the horse was still in a running position.

Everything in the small town was frozen, except for the steamer baskets at the breakfast stalls that were still emitting steam.

Xia ruofei was not surprised because when he came in, he had already noticed that everything in this mini town was man – made. The residents and animals were all puppets, but they were very realistic.

What he didn’t expect was that old Daoist Zhen Yang could actually control everything here.

It was clear that the reason all the puppets were frozen at this moment was because of old Daoist Zhen Yang.

Old Taoist Zhen Yang strolled into the mini town, with Xia ruofei following closely behind him.

Taoist Zhen Yang turned to look at Xia ruofei and said with a smile,”Scholar Xia, you don’t seem to be very curious about this scene?”

Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”so far, I haven’t found any other life forms on the first floor of the trial Pagoda.” I knew that everything in this town was man – made, including the residents!”

Old Taoist Zhen Yang couldn’t help but look at Xia ruofei and said,””Scholar Xia is indeed quick – witted!”

Xia ruofei laughed.”Although these puppets look very realistic, their movements are still a little stiff. The whole town is like a sophisticated machine. Every part is operating according to the established program without any mistakes. “However, as the saying goes, going too far is as bad as not enough. This kind of precise order definitely doesn’t exist in normal human towns ...”

Old Daoist Zhen Yang gave Xia ruofei a big thumbs up.

“Taoist priest, you haven’t told me what the second reward is.” Xia ruofei smiled.

“Actually, the second reward isn’t a physical item, but a piece of information ...” Daoist Zhen Yang said with a smile.

“The information that Daoist priest wanted to tell me, could it be that these residents and animals are all puppets?” Xia ruofei asked, not knowing whether to laugh or cry.

If that was the case, then it was really a bit too much.

This was because Xia ruofei had already realized this. This meant that the reward was meaningless to him.

Old Daoist Zhen Yang waved his hand with a smile and said,”Naturally, it won’t be such a simple piece of information.”

Xia ruofei heaved a sigh of relief. That was good. No matter what information Taoist Zhen Yang could provide, as long as it was something he didn’t know before, then his efforts were not in vain.

He asked,”what is the specific information?” I hope Daoist priest won’t be stingy with your teachings!”

Old Daoist Zhen Yang chuckled.”You’re too kind, layman Xia. This is the reward you should have received ... Layman Xia, the information I can provide you is that the cultivation of these puppets in this town is actually extraordinary. The weakest is early golden core, and two of them even have the strength of nascent soul.” From the moment you stepped into the town, they have already regarded you as an invader and will attack you to the death ...”

Hearing this, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but widen his eyes. At the side, old Daoist Zhen Yang chuckled and asked,”Scholar Xia, how is it? This information is still useful, right?”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. After all this talk, he was just telling himself that he would be hunted down by hundreds of golden core stage and even nascent Soul Stage cultivators?

In order to tell him this, old Daoist Zhen Yang had actually pulled him into this small town. What use was this information? It was simply a huge pit, alright?

Xia ruofei, you thought there was a trap in front of you, but you didn’t expect the real trap to be waiting here!

Was there a need to bring him all the way to the town to tell him this piece of news? Wouldn’t it have been better to just tell him directly in true yang temple? True yang temple was even closer to the entrance of the second level. If he was really no match for them, he would have enough time to escape to the second level.

Presumably, these puppets wouldn’t chase him to the second floor.

“Thank you, Taoist priest,” Xia ruofei said with a dry smile. However ... I would like to know when these puppets will begin to pursue me. ”

With a mysterious smile, Daoist Zhen Yang said,”Now ...”

As soon as he finished speaking, the whole town became lively again. The horses continued to gallop forward, The Cloth Shop owner and the girl in pink happily completed the transaction, and the candied gourd peddler continued to shout ...

The puppets did not notice the frozen scene at all. To them, everything was continuous.

Of course, there was a difference. Everyone’s eyes fell on Xia ruofei at the same time, and their killing intent exploded.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but curse under his breath. Then, he subconsciously took out his qushuang flying sword. He made a sword gesture and stepped on the flying sword. Then, he flew away on his flying sword.

Now, he finally understood that the so – called second reward was clearly a huge trap.

Who said that puppets would not lie? When old Taoist Zhen Yang lied, his face wouldn’t even turn red. Xia ruofei had foolishly followed him to the center of the town and ended up in the most dangerous situation.

If it wasn’t for Xia ruofei’s quick reaction and the fact that he had just mastered the sword technique of sword Kinesis flight, he would have been killed by the nearest grocer. Just now, as soon as Taoist Zhen Yang finished speaking, the grocer had locked onto Xia ruofei. The carrying pole in his hand flew out and heavily hit the place where Xia ruofei had been standing, causing sparks to fly. The thick bluestone floor had actually cracked into several pieces.

If it had hit Xia ruofei, he would have definitely broken his bones.

Fortunately, Xia ruofei had just obtained the warped Frost Sword and had mastered the sword control technique. Although his posture on the flying sword was still a little stiff, and the flight trajectory was not so perfect, the speed of the flying sword was still brought out. After he narrowly avoided the itinerant peddler’s attack, he took advantage of the fact that the other puppets had not yet reacted and directly drove the flying sword to the narrow alley behind the street.

At this time, the map function of the perceptual mirror also helped a lot.

Xia ruofei had a real – time map in his field of vision and could clearly see every road.

Although the town was not big, there were many narrow alleys on both sides of the street. Many of the alleys were almost empty, and it was quite quiet. After all, there were only more than a hundred puppet residents in the entire mini town. Including the animal puppets such as cats, dogs, horses, and so on, there were no more than two hundred. This area of more than ten acres was divided into dozens of alleys of various sizes, and it was impossible for the puppets to cover all of them.

They were mainly concentrated near the streets.

Hence, Xia ruofei rode his flying sword at high speed in the alley. After a few turns, he arrived at a secluded place.

This was where the back door of a Manor was located. The alley was only three feet wide, with high walls on both sides. The back door of the manor was also tightly closed.

Xia ruofei didn’t dare to enter the house rashly. Taoist Zhen Yang had just told him that there were Yuanying stage puppets in this mini town. If he happened to be in the house, wouldn’t he be asking for trouble? Xia ruofei felt that if he were to encounter a nascent soul cultivator, he would not even have the chance to escape. Hence, he had to be extremely careful. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

When Xia ruofei flew into the alley, he had already used his spiritual power to check the situation in the alley. First, he confirmed that there was not a single puppet in the quiet alley. Second, he found the best hiding place in the shortest time possible.

In front of the back door of the house, there was a small ditch less than a foot wide. The flowing water was so clear that the bottom could be seen. The two sides and the bottom of the ditch were neatly built with cobblestones. The back door of the house was on this side, so there were two stone slabs set up from the top of the ditch to the alley.

Xia ruofei flew across the entrance of the house on his sword. He waved his right hand quickly and disappeared into thin air. The quiet alley was still as quiet as before, as if no one had ever been here ...
