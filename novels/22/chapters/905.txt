Chapter 906: Song Qiming’s decision (2)

Translator: 549690339

“Secretary, I worked in the organization Department for a while before I was transferred to the first Secretary Department,” Guangzhi Cao quickly said. “I had some contact with yang Jianren. He’s ... Quite flamboyant, and ... He doesn’t seem to have a good reputation for his lifestyle. ”

Guangzhi was being tactful, but song Qiming understood. He nodded and asked,””What’s his job?”

“Yang Jianren is not part of the system. He opened a trading company.” Guangzhi Cao said,”I don’t know how much business this company has, but he’s quite a spendthrift.”

Song Qiming nodded and said,””I know.”

Guangzhi Cao looked at song Qiming and said,”Secretary, I’ll go back first.”

“Yes.” Song Qiming nodded.

As Guangzhi Cao stood up, song Qiming said,””Xiao Cao, you did the right thing today. A Secretary’s job should be meticulous enough. If there’s anything, report it to the leader immediately and provide reference for the leader’s decision.”

Guangzhi Cao suppressed the excitement in his heart and said,”Yes, Secretary. I’ll work harder.”

Song Qiming smiled and said,””Well, go back and have a good rest in the afternoon! You’ve worked hard these past few days. ”

“Thank you for your concern, Secretary.” Guangzhi Cao said,”Secretary, you should rest for a while. I’ll take my leave.” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

After Guangzhi Cao left, song Qiming did not go back to his room to rest. Instead, he sat down in the study.

He took out a cigarette from the box and lit it. He sat in the smoke – filled study for a long time, then opened the desk drawer and took out a document to read carefully.

This wasn’t an official red – headed document. It was just a document sent by the provincial Party organization Department to every Standing Committee member about the situation of the candidates to be promoted to the main hall and Deputy Hall level.

In the near future, the province was indeed going to promote a group of Department – Level cadres, which was a normal cadre adjustment.

The organization Department summarized the situation of the candidates and sent them to each member of the Standing Committee. The next step was to observe these people according to the organization’s procedures, which would provide a basis for the next step of the official discussion of the Standing Committee.

Of course, he might not be promoted after being inspected, but those who were not inspected would definitely not be promoted.

Song Qiming quickly flipped to the page with yang Jinsheng. It was a simple introduction to the officers and their employment experience. He spent five to six minutes reading it.

After closing the document, song Qiming thought for a while. Finally, he picked up the red phone on the table and dialed a number.

“Hello, Secretary Lin!” After the call connected, song Qiming smiled and said,”I’m song Qiming.”

The person song Qiming was calling was the head of the southeast province, Lin Shengyun, the provincial Committee Secretary.

Lin Shengyun laughed heartily and said,””It’s comrade Qi Ming! What’s the matter?”

“Secretary Lin, I have something to report to you.” Song Qiming said,”I’ve seen the situation of the Department – Level cadres sent by the organization Department. My opinion is that our Municipal Party Committee organization department’s vice – Minister, comrade yang Jinsheng, should not be inspected this time.”

Lin Shengyun was a little surprised. Song Qiming had just taken office and was not familiar with the situation. Under such circumstances, he would not express too many opinions on personnel issues. Even if he were to go to the Standing Committee, he would at most raise his hand.

He didn’t expect song Qiming to express his opposition to the promotion of yang Jinsheng. He couldn’t ignore song Qiming’s opinion, because song Qiming was not only the Secretary of Sanshan city, but also the Deputy Secretary of the southeast province.

Song Qiming’s position in the provincial Committee was the third, second only to the Secretary and the provincial judge. In addition, yang Jinsheng, who song Qiming had mentioned, was a cadre of Sanshan city. As the Secretary of Sanshan, song Qiming naturally had the right to speak.

“Comrade Qiming, it’s comrade yang Jinsheng. Is there a problem?” Lin Shengyun asked with a smile.

“Secretary Lin, please don’t misunderstand.” Song Qiming said,”this is what I’m thinking. I’ve just been appointed and I’m not completely familiar with the team members, let alone the cadres under me. Moreover, the position that comrade yang Jinsheng is going to promote to is the municipal Party Committee organization Minister, so I hope that the Provincial Party Committee will give me some time to familiarize myself with the situation and then consider it comprehensively.”

Song Qiming paused for a moment before he continued,””And our department head, department head Niu, is still two months away from retirement! I don’t think there’s a need to rush the allocation of this position. Of course, this is just my personal opinion. ”

Lin Shengyun pondered for a moment, then smiled and said,””Comrade Qiming, I understand your suggestion. I will consider it seriously.”

“Okay. Thank you, Secretary Lin.” Song Qiming said,”I’ll give you a detailed report when I arrive at the Provincial Party Committee tomorrow.”

After hanging up the phone, song Qiming heaved a sigh of relief. He leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes to rest.

Although Lin Shengyun did not make his stand clear, song Qiming knew the weight of his opinion. There was a high chance that Lin Shengyun would agree to it.

Naturally, song Qiming would not make such a rash decision just because of a small conflict in a private room with yang Jinsheng’s son, yang Jianren.

Even if yang Jianren’s target was Xia ruofei, it was not enough for song Qiming to make up his mind.

In fact, song Qiming and Tian Huilan had had a long conversation when they took over the position.

This was normal because the two of them had the same political stance. Their handover was a true “handover.” Tian Huilan had told song Qiming everything about the team members, including the leaders of some important departments.

At that time, the two of them talked about yang Jinsheng.

Because Minister Niu of the municipal organization Department was about to reach the age limit, there had long been rumors about the selection of the organization Minister. Yang Jinsheng was going to take the baton in order and step into the Standing Committee position.

On the other hand, Tian Huilan was hesitant about yang Jinsheng’s promotion, and she even had some reservations.

It was because yang Jinsheng’s reputation was not very good.

That was why song Qiming had been hesitating. Guangzhi Cao’s report today had further strengthened his determination.

As a leader who wanted to do things and could do things, he was in his Prime. Naturally, he did not want to see any problems in his team.

Although it had happened to yang Jianren, he could still see the big picture from the small details. This also reflected a lot of problems from another perspective.

Before these questions were cleared up, song Qiming decided to stop the inspection of yang Jinsheng.

If yang Jinsheng really had no problems, then it would not affect his progress. Minister Niu still had nearly two months to reach his age, so there was no problem with the time.

Song Qiming closed his eyes and rested for a while. Then, he picked up his phone and called Liu Weiye, the Secretary of the municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection.

Liu Weiye was Tian Huilan’s old subordinate. He was someone song Qiming could completely trust.

He instructed Liu Weiye to investigate yang Jinsheng’s situation while keeping it confidential, and to focus on yang Jianren’s company.

For the people from the Commission for Discipline Inspection, this kind of confidential investigation was already a walk in the park. After the entire administrative machine was started, yang Jianren’s company’s current accounts and business situation would be checked clearly without him knowing it.

Song Qiming put down the phone and scribbled two lines under yang Jinsheng’s name on the document with a red pencil. Then, he muttered to himself,””I hope you can withstand the inspection! Otherwise, my first fire won’t be a good feeling ...”

Then, song Qiming locked the documents in his desk drawer and went back to his room to rest.

Xia ruofei did not know that Cao Guangzhi had reported to song Qiming, nor did he know that the small conflict that day had helped song Qiming make up his mind. He took the car back to the farm, thanked the two drivers, and went straight upstairs to his room.

After locking the door and windows, Xia ruofei took out the spirit painting scroll and entered the medium.

The unknown poison was still lingering on his fingertips!

After entering Xia ruofei’s body, the poison was tightly wrapped by Xia ruofei’s spiritual energy. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t break free. In the end, it just hid in a corner.

Xia ruofei was very interested in this poison, so he entered the medium as soon as he got home and was ready to study it.
