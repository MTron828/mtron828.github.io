Translator: 549690339

“An outstanding professional manager must be good at adjusting the company’s development strategy and psychological positioning according to the company’s strength and prospects, right?” Feng Jing smiled.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”you’re right!” I chose you because of this!”

Feng Rao blushed when she heard Xia ruofei’s slightly ambiguous words. She quickly adjusted her expression and said,””Chairman, since you’ve agreed, then I’ll officially contact the state – owned assets Supervision and Administration Commission today to try to win this project.”

This was the largest acquisition the company had made since its establishment, and it was also one that would affect the company’s long – term development. Feng Jing was extremely excited and eager to give it a try.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”sure!” If there’s anything you can’t make a decision on, report to me at any time!”

“Understood!” Feng Rao said excitedly.

......

In the next few days, Feng Jing put most of her energy into the acquisition.

The second sale of the jaded skin cream had just ended, and the company’s work was going on in an orderly manner. Everyone had their own duties, so there was no need for Feng Jing to spend too much energy on it.

On the second day after Xia ruofei returned to the country, he held a celebration party and gave out a bonus to all the employees who had worked before and after the sale of the jaded skin cream. He also announced a new company benefit. All employees would have a paid vacation opportunity every year. The company would provide travel subsidies, and the employees could choose the location.

Tourism benefits were also divided into three levels, and the subsidies for each level were different. Generally speaking, the first level of subsidies was enough to support employees to travel to European and American countries. The second level allowed employees to travel to domestic in – depth travel or Southeast Asian countries. The third level allowed employees to travel to at least one or two cities in the country.

The grading of travel subsidies was based on, in addition to the level of the employee, the quantitative scoring of their usual performance, performance, etc., And the evaluation of the grade every year.

This level was not only related to the travel subsidy, but also related to the promotion and transfer of employees.

This quantitative scoring system was timely introduced after Xia ruofei and Feng Jing’s repeated discussion.

The two of them agreed that since the company was developing so fast, it was time to set up rules. To put it simply, it was to be systemized and standardized.

The first group of employees to receive travel subsidies were the ones who had participated in the work before and after the jaded skin cream project.

The employees were naturally overjoyed, and Xia ruofei’s heart was filled with a sense of achievement.

He had never been a stingy person. The company was making money, and Xia ruofei would definitely not mistreat the employees who were working hard for the company.

Soon, Xia ruofei had been back for a week.

He had basically spent the entire week on the farm. Other than the two dates he had with Ling Qingxue, he had spent most of his energy on work.

Ye Lingyun and a few veterans had made Da Hong Pao tea leaves out of the tea leaves that Xia ruofei had provided before he left the country. They had obtained a total of 500 catties.

Xia ruofei tried it himself and felt that it tasted pretty good. Although it was still lacking compared to his collection of Da Hong Pao, it was much better than the so – called top quality Da Hong Pao on the market.

Xia ruofei knew that apart from the quality of the tea leaves that far exceeded other tea companies, ye Lingyun’s ancient tea – making skills that he had directly inherited from old man Li Zhifu also played a very important role. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Xia ruofei was very happy. Not only did he praise ye Lingyun and the others, but he also announced on the spot that they would receive travel benefits, just like the employees who had participated in the jaded skin cream project.

The other departments of the company also cooperated. Some were in charge of design, some were in charge of packaging, and some were in charge of publicity. Soon, this batch of tea leaves was packaged into small gift boxes.

This batch of Taoyuan Brand Da Hong Pao was sold in Taoyuan company’s Skycat flagship store and its own store in kyokubei.

Other than using a large banner on the front page of the e – commerce platform’s online store to promote it, paradise Corporation did not hold a press conference specifically for this paradise Brand Da Hong Pao.

On the one hand, the quantity of this batch of goods was not large. On the other hand, the current paradise Corporation was no longer the ignorant company of the past. After experiencing the auction of the top grade one – headed abalone, the press conference of the Jade skin cream, the first sale, and so on, it was now a company with a considerable reputation in the country.

Compared to the past when its reputation was only limited to Sanshan city and the southeast province, the current paradise Corporation had a considerable reputation in the country. It even had a lot of attention overseas.

This was naturally due to the jaded skin ointment.

It had been more than a month since the launch of the jaded skin cream, and the first batch of jaded skin cream had been released for more than half a month. More and more consumers had recognized the jaded skin cream, and it had naturally spread abroad.

Although the overseas release date of the jaded skin cream had not been confirmed yet, there were countless people who went abroad every day. Some were studying abroad, some were traveling, and some were visiting relatives. Among them were the users of the jaded skin cream.

The effect of the jaded skin cream was so amazing that such a phenomenal product was like an awl in a cloth bag. It was impossible to hide its edge.

Just a few days ago, the company began to receive calls from overseas, all of which were seeking cooperation. There were Europe, the United States, Southeast Asia, and even Africa.
