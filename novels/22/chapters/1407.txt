Chapter 1408: Bold and decisive (2)

Translator: 549690339

The next day, Jiang Liangyu gave Xia ruofei a call. He smiled bitterly and complained that Xia ruofei did not care about his old bones and had drunk him too much.

Xia ruofei, on the other hand, was complaining about Jiang Liangyu’s speech that day, which had caused him all kinds of trouble.

In the end, the two of them shook hands and made up, treating it as even.

Of course, after a round of drinking, Xia ruofei and Jiang Liangyu’s relationship became much closer.

Those who had been in the military knew that many friendships were formed through drinking.

After arranging the dinner, Xia ruofei had a few days of leisure time, and it was soon New Year’s Day.

Lin Qiao didn’t go home during the holiday. Xia ruofei specially brought Hu Zi’s mother to the farm villa to stay for two days.

This year’s spring Festival was earlier, around mid – January, so soon after New Year’s Day, all schools began to have winter vacation.

The school holidays started a few days earlier than the University holidays. After Nan Nan’s holiday, Hu Zi’s mother did not need to be sent and taken home. Hence, Xia ruofei went to the forestry Bureau’s dormitory to help Hu Zi’s mother pack her things and sent her to her new house in the daguantian community by car.

Then, the two of them cleaned up the house and did the cleaning inside and out.

The new year was coming. Hu Zi’s mother also wanted to clean up everything before Lin Qiao came back and spend the new year in the new house.

Xia ruofei did not ask for help, nor did he hire a part – time helper. He rolled up his sleeves and started to clean up. He did not even let Hu Zi’s mother do the work of climbing up the mountain. He snatched it and finished it himself.

Then, Xia ruofei drove to the supermarket to buy some daily necessities that the new house lacked. He made arrangements for Hu Zi’s mother’s life here and finally accompanied Hu Zi’s mother to have a meal in the new house. After that, Xia ruofei bade farewell and drove back to the farm.

As the company’s Annual Meeting approached, the two proposals that Feng Jing had been working on were finally completed.

She immediately went to Xia ruofei’s office to report. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Chairman, I’ve finished the two plans you instructed me to make for the company’s executive incentive mechanism and the company’s structural adjustment.” Feng Jing got straight to the point.”I’m here today to report to you!”

“Oh?” Xia ruofei sat up straight and said,”sister ran, you’ve been staying up a lot lately, haven’t you?” You’ve worked hard!”

Then, Xia ruofei stood up and said enthusiastically,””Come, come, come, Let’s Drink Tea and talk!”

He led Feng Jing to the sofa in the guest area and sat down. Then, he started boiling water and making tea.

Feng Rao knew Xia ruofei very well, and she knew his temper and style very well. Hence, she did not show too much restraint like a subordinate would when facing her superior. While Xia ruofei was still busy, she said directly,””Chairman, considering that this incentive mechanism is mainly targeted at senior management, I’ll first report the plan for the overall structural adjustment of the company!”

Xia ruofei nodded. This was a reasonable order. After all, after the company’s structural adjustment, the composition and number of senior executives would be different from now. The incentive mechanism had to be built on the basis of the company’s structural adjustment.

Feng Jing passed the thick revision plan to Xia ruofei. She took the other copy and started to report the plan that she had been thinking about for the past few days.

“Ruofei, this plan is based on your idea. I’ve made some minor changes.” Feng Jing said,”in general, we will set up two separate subsidiaries, namely Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory and Taoyuan agricultural products company. Both subsidiaries are fully owned by Taoyuan agricultural products company.”

“The head office will have one president and two vice presidents, each in charge of the business of the two branch companies. In addition, we will add an e – commerce Department and a director; Considering that although Paradise Farm doesn’t have a subordinate relationship with the Paradise Corporation, it’s still a property under your name after all, and we will have more and more overseas business in the future, so I suggest adding an overseas business department and upgrading the three major departments of the administration department, marketing department, and finance department. The heads of the three major departments will be the company’s Chief Administrative Officer, Chief Marketing Officer, and Chief Financial Officer respectively. This way, the company’s leadership structure will be more clear, with the chairman, President, and Chief Financial Officer. The Vice President and the heads of the three major departments, as well as the two companies directly under the business department ...”

Xia ruofei nodded his head as he listened.

He could tell that Feng Jing’s reorganization plan was based on the structure of the company Group.

In fact, although paradise Corporation had not been changed to Paradise Group, according to the current business volume, market share, and company valuation, this was the size of a Company Group.

Feng Jing’s plan was very scientific and in line with the rules of management.

Feng Jing’s plan was very detailed. Not only did she have an overall plan for the company’s reorganization, but she also listed the functions, tasks, and authority of each department in detail. She even gave her own suggestions for the new positions.

For example, she suggested that Cao tieshu be the manager of Taoyuan agricultural products company, while the Chief Marketing Officer and Chief Financial Officer would be the current marketing Director Xiao Qiang and financial Director pang Hao, respectively.

In addition, the directors of the e – commerce and overseas business divisions were also selected from the existing staff. They were Luo Xing, the Senior Marketing Manager who was previously in charge of the e – commerce business, and Jiang Limei, the first batch of senior employees from the administration department who had been recruited.

Xia ruofei knew these two people well.

Luo Xing used to be the backbone of the marketing department and Xiao Qiang’s right – hand man. After Paradise Corporation began to set up its e – commerce business, Luo Xing had been in charge of this work.

Jiang Limei was originally a top student at the University of foreign trade. She had a high level of English and knew how to do foreign trade. She was the one who was working with Paradise Farm. When they returned to Hong Kong to prepare for the press conference, Feng Jing also brought her along.

It could be said that both of them had grown up in paradise Corporation, and now there was no problem for them to take charge of a field on their own.

Xia ruofei nodded to himself. He could tell that Feng Jing had put a lot of thought into this proposal. There were no selfish thoughts in it. She just wanted to place the most suitable person in the most suitable position.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but secretly rejoice that he had chosen Feng Jing to be the company’s general manager. He was so lucky!

“I agree with this plan!” Xia ruofei carefully read the original proposal and said,”sister che, from today onwards, you can start preparing for the reorganization. I’m going to announce this proposal at the company’s Annual Meeting. Around the Spring Festival, we can consider it a trial run! It’s also a trial period for the new officials. If everything goes well, we can basically move to the new headquarters in time. By then, we’ll plan the office area according to the new department setting. ”

“Understood!” Feng Rao said straightforwardly.

“By the way, you have to talk to the people you’re going to promote in advance, such as old Cao, Luo Xing, and Jiang Limei.” Xia ruofei said,”as for Xiao Qiang and pang Hao, who will be promoted to the head office, I will talk to them personally.”

Although paradise Corporation was a pure private enterprise and didn’t need to have a formal organizational conversation like in the system, as the company’s first and second in command, it was still necessary to have a heart – to – Heart talk with the new officials and make some requests before they took office.

“No problem! I’ll arrange this work before the annual meeting. ” Feng Jing continued to ask,”ruofei, what time is it convenient for you?”

“Let’s do it today!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”anyway, my task is light. I only need to talk to two people. I don’t even have a Chief Administrative Officer yet! There were also two positions for the Vice president of the company, both of which were empty! Speaking of which, have you contacted the Dong Yun you mentioned a few days ago? What’s the other party’s attitude?”
