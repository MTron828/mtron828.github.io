2403 Crazy_There were two rows of waterproof mats inside the tent, and a narrow path in the middle.

At the entrance of the tent, there was a foldable gun rack, where the helmets and guns of the soldiers were placed neatly.

Xia ruofei had a military background and was very familiar with the layout of military tents in the wild, even the smell of sweat and feet in the air. He glanced at the mercenaries who were sleeping soundly and kept all the weapons and equipment at the door into his storage space before walking towards them.

The soldiers who were sleeping were the easiest to deal with. Xia ruofei did not even need to do anything. He could just treat them like objects and keep them in the spatial cage.

Therefore, he moved very quickly. Basically, within half a minute, a tent was swept clean.

He didn’t stop for a moment. After leaving one tent, he immediately went into the adjacent tent.

Just like that, everything seemed to be going smoothly along the way.

However, just as Xia ruofei was about to enter the eleventh tent, he suddenly felt a chill run down his spine. This was his sharp perception of fatal danger.

Xia ruofei did not hesitate. He rolled and entered the tent.

Almost at the same time, a clear gunshot broke the silence of the night. A large – caliber pistol bullet hit the spot where Xia ruofei had just been standing.

Xia ruofei’s expression changed slightly. He did not expect that he would still be discovered even as the operation was coming to an end!

Xia ruofei’s ability to adapt was also very strong. When he sensed danger, he did not blindly avoid it. Instead, he made the right decision in an instant and slipped into the tent that he was about to enter.

As he rolled into the tent, Xia ruofei had already stored the weapons on the gun rack at the entrance of the tent into the spirit map space. At the same time, he used his spiritual power to envelop the nine soldiers in the tent.

The soldiers were all woken up by the gunshots at the same time.

However, Xia ruofei had already kept the people closest to him into the spatial cage. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Five more soldiers had woken up.

If they resisted when they were awake, Xia ruofei might fail to take them in.

This was different from mental hypnosis. If mental hypnosis was used, as long as the other party’s mental power was much weaker than the caster ‘s, it would basically be a crushing defeat. It would be difficult not to fall for it.

However, if one wanted to put someone into the spirit map space, as long as the other party had the intention to resist, the difficulty would increase exponentially.

Xia ruofei didn’t know what the principle was, but he knew that it might be reasonable. Otherwise, the spirit map space was too heaven – defying. No matter if the other party was willing or not, it could directly put them into the space and then use its absolute control over the space to deal with the other party in any way.

Hence, after putting the four soldiers into the spatial cage, Xia ruofei saw that the rest of the soldiers had woken up. Without any hesitation, he stomped on the ground and pounced on the soldiers who were still in a daze.

After a few steps, Xia ruofei jumped up and stretched his body. He was almost turned over and kicked a soldier’s chin in a mid – Air shot. Then, he twisted his body and elbowed the other soldier’s chest.

The two of them didn’t even make a sound as they fell to the ground like logs. Xia ruofei’s body had also fallen sideways. At the same time, he put the two unconscious soldiers into the spatial cage.

The remaining three soldiers were charging towards Xia ruofei. They were stunned when they saw their two comrades disappear into thin air after being knocked down.

While they were still in a daze, Xia ruofei pushed himself off the ground and jumped up like a spring. He grabbed one of the soldiers by the shoulders and kneed him with his knee. The soldier felt as if his chest had been hit by a heavy truck and he fainted.

As Xia ruofei kept the soldier into the spatial cage, he jumped up from the ground and punched at the same time. The last two soldiers fell to the ground.

Xia ruofei took the opportunity to keep the two soldiers into the spatial cage.

From the gunshot to Xia ruofei rolling into the tent to him killing the nine soldiers, the entire process only took five to six seconds.

At this moment, outside the tent, Douglas, the leader of the modr mercenary group, rushed out of the last tent that Xia ruofei had not visited.

This tent was surrounded by 11 other tents and was located in the center of the camp. It was equivalent to the central Army tent in ancient times.

This was Douglas ‘resting place and also his command center.

The tent was divided into two compartments. Douglas rested in the inner compartment, while the outer compartment was used as a command center. A large military map was hung on the wall, and there were a few tables.

In the outer room, there was also a staff officer and an orderly on duty at night, so that Douglas could find them at any time if he needed help in the middle of the night.

However, the staff officer and the orderly were not on duty 24 hours a day. When it was time for lights out, they also fell asleep in the outer room.

Douglas was the kind of soldier who had truly experienced countless Wars. He used to be a special force soldier of the U.S. Military’s 101st Airborne Division. After retirement, because he had no other life skills and was unwilling to live the rest of his life with the retirement fund issued by the government, he came to Africa and became a mercenary.
