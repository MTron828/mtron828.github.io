2203 Joint cultivation of the spirit and body (1)

Ling Qingxue’s sea of consciousness was also filled with chaotic airflow like a vast ocean. In this chaotic airflow, the Black Rock Island where her soul was could be vaguely seen.

Rays of golden light flickered in and out of the chaotic airflow. Xia ruofei knew that this was Ling Qingxue’s spiritual power.

These golden lights formed by spiritual energy were very agile, swimming quickly in the ocean of Qi flow like fish.

However, because Ling Qingxue had completely let down her guard against Xia ruofei, the spiritual energy did not actively attack Xia ruofei’s spiritual energy.

Xia ruofei’s spiritual power was also golden in color, but it was many times stronger than Ling Qingxue ‘s. If Ling Qingxue’s spiritual power was like an agile fish, Xia ruofei’s spiritual power was more like a giant shark.

After all, crossing a large realm meant a qualitative leap. The spiritual power of the Spirit palpitating stage and the spiritual power of the Spirit gathering stage were not on the same level at all.

Of course, Ling Qingxue’s consciousness didn’t have the pink threads formed by the peach blossom miasma, so it looked more vibrant than Song Wei ‘s.

After a short pause, Xia ruofei controlled his spiritual power and headed straight for the Black Rock Island in the center of Ling Qingxue’s sea of consciousness.

Compared to the dangerous situation in Song Wei’s sea of consciousness, this time, there was no danger. The chaotic airflow and the Golden spiritual energy even parted to allow Xia ruofei’s spiritual energy to flow smoothly.

In a short while, Xia ruofei’s spiritual power had reached the Black Rock Island, the core of his sea of consciousness.

The island was still protected by a transparent film of light, but Ling Qingxue had completely let down her guard. Xia ruofei’s spiritual power went through it without much effort.

Just like Song Wei’s sea of consciousness, the island seemed to be made up of a whole piece of black stone. The entire Island was one.

The black stone tablet at the edge of the island had two golden lines, one thick and one thin.

Xia ruofei knew that this meant that Ling Qingxue’s spiritual power cultivation was at the early stage of the spiritual palpitations.

This was much more powerful than Song Wei. When Song Wei first performed the spirit body combined cultivation with Xia ruofei, she was only at the middle stage of the spirit Movement realm.

Xia ruofei couldn’t see what was happening in his sea of consciousness, so he was curious. He wondered what kind of symbol would appear on the black stone tablet with his cultivation of the spirit gathering realm.

Xia ruofei’s spiritual power only stopped for a moment. Soon, it passed the black stone tablet and flew towards the center of the island.

Unsurprisingly, he soon saw a small, naked person sitting cross – legged, with Ling Qingxue’s face between her brows.

Ling Qingxue’s soul seemed to be more solid than Song Wei ‘s. It was probably because her cultivation level was higher than Song Wei’ s.

When Xia ruofei’s spiritual power was near Ling Qingxue’s spiritual body, just as he had expected, the form of his spiritual power had changed.

Xia ruofei did not panic because he had experienced it before. He looked at his head, facial features, and body with great curiosity until it completely simulated the state of a spirit.

Xia ruofei even split some of his attention and said to Ling Qingxue calmly,””Qingxue, don’t panic. From now on, you just have to cooperate with me in circulating the” absolute beginning Heart Sutra “. No matter what happens, you don’t have to panic.”

Although Ling Qingxue’s cultivation level was not high enough for her to see her own consciousness, she could still sense the situation inside when external spiritual power entered her consciousness.

Fortunately, she was in a relationship with Xia ruofei. Even though it was a little awkward to appear naked in front of Xia ruofei, it was not enough to cause her to be excited.

In short, this combined spirit and body cultivation was much better than the last time Xia ruofei and Song Wei combined cultivation.

Back then, he and Song Wei had cultivated together. It could be said that they were surrounded by danger, and they had finally achieved it by accident. If anything went wrong in the middle, it might be a result of eternal damnation for the two of them.

Ling Qingxue nodded slightly, her face slightly red as she said,””I know ...”

The spiritual body formed by Xia ruofei’s spiritual power floated in front of Ling Qingxue’s spiritual body and sat down cross – legged.

He extended his hand, and Ling Qingxue’s spirit body also extended its hand. When the palms of the two Spirit bodies touched, the fear that came from the depths of their souls was felt again.

The two people in the outside world couldn’t help but tremble.

Fortunately, Xia ruofei was prepared and had also warned Ling Qingxue in advance. Hence, their breathing was only a little messy. Very quickly, the two of them adjusted.

In a short while, the two of them continued to circulate the “absolute beginning Heart Sutra” in the outside world. In Ling Qingxue’s consciousness, the two spiritual bodies also began to use this technique. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

The only difference was that true Qi circulated in their bodies, while pure mental energy circulated in the spirit body’s meridians.

As the cultivation progressed, on the deck of the yacht, two people closed their eyes and continued to operate their cultivation techniques. They looked solemn and had a sense of holiness.

But in Ling Qingxue’s consciousness, the contact between the two souls made the two of them involuntarily get closer.

Ling Qingxue was Xia ruofei’s girlfriend and they were already very close to each other, so she did not even have the most basic self – restraint.

Xia ruofei knew the huge attraction and temptation of this kind of spirit body joint cultivation. Even without the peach blossom miasma, he did not deliberately suppress himself.
