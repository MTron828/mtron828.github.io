  Feng Jing nodded helplessly. She knew that once Xia ruofei had made a decision, it would be hard for others to change it. Hence, she did not want to waste her efforts.

  Feng Jing felt dejected when she thought about how she might not have many chances to meet Xia ruofei in the future.

  After adjusting her emotions, Feng Jing raised her head and said,""Chairman, it's mainly the pharmaceutical factory that's in a hurry. Let's just talk about the other things during the meeting! Since you've made this decision, you must personally explain it to the company's management. Do you think we should gather everyone for a meeting this afternoon?"

  Xia ruofei nodded and said,"hmm, I think it's doable ... Considering that the pharmaceutical factory is quite far away, then ... We'll have a meeting in the Board of Directors" meeting room in an hour!" I'll personally explain the situation to everyone and make it clear that you'll be fully in charge of the company's work. "

  In paradise Corporation, the person Xia ruofei trusted the most was Feng Jing, who was now the CEO of paradise Corporation. Since Xia ruofei was no longer the CEO, it was expected that the CEO would be in charge of all the work.

  "Alright, I'll inform everyone right away," Feng Rao nodded. Chairman, Mr. Zheng, I'll take my leave first. "

  "Mm! Sister che, you've worked hard!" Xia ruofei nodded.

  Zheng Yongshou also nodded at Feng ke. Zheng Yongshou had seen the conversation between Xia ruofei and Feng Jing. To be honest, he didn't think much of it. It was just a business in the secular world. He didn't think it was necessary for Xia ruofei to make such detailed arrangements. Not to mention that the Paradise Corporation was far from being a giant company, even the world's top 500 and the world's richest people were not attractive to cultivators.

  But out of respect for the master, Zheng Yongshou didn't say anything. He just watched quietly. Even if he didn't understand, he wouldn't question Xia ruofei's decision.

  After Feng Jing left, Xia ruofei stood up, walked to his desk, and sat down. At the same time, he gestured for Zheng Yongshou to sit on the chair opposite his desk.

  "Elder Zheng, you'll be in charge of the liaison work with the Paradise Corporation in the future." Xia ruofei said,"there's some time now. I'll introduce you to the situation of paradise Corporation and the specific work you're in charge of. I'll also emphasize some things to take note of. Even if you don't understand it for now, you can remember it in your heart."

  "Yes, Mr. Xia!" Zheng Yongshou quickly replied.

  Hence, Xia ruofei used the one hour before the meeting to introduce the settings of some departments, the basic situation of the management, and the main business situation of paradise Corporation to Zheng Yongshou. Xia ruofei also emphasized a few things to pay attention to regarding the few aspects that Zheng Yongshou needed to show up in.

  The main thing was not to expose the identity of a cultivator, and not to use the means of a cultivator at will. They had to do things within the rules and legal framework of the secular world as much as possible. Other than that, there were some things that had to be done secretly, such as adding the spirit Heart Flower petal solution to the water source of Tao Yuan farm. Xia ruofei repeated the details.

  Zheng Yongshou didn't really understand some things about paradise Corporation, but he still strictly followed Xia ruofei's requirements and rote down all the information that Xia ruofei had introduced. In the future, when he slowly familiarized himself with the situation, he would naturally understand.

  For cultivators, remembering such a small amount of information was naturally nothing.

  Very quickly, an hour had passed. Feng Jing personally came to Xia ruofei's office and smiled.""Chairman, everyone's here."

  Xia ruofei stood up and said,""Good! Then let's go to the meeting! Elder Zheng, you should come along!"

  "Yes, Mr. Xia!" Zheng Yongshou quickly bowed and said.

  Zheng Yongshou's respectful attitude made Feng Jing a little curious. To an elite who had returned from overseas and received a modern education, Zheng Yongshou's attitude was a little too respectful, even a little flattering.

  Xia ruofei took the lead, with Feng Jing and Zheng Yongshou following behind. They soon arrived at the board meeting room on the same floor.

  the company's management had all arrived, including the administrative vice president dong yun, the pharmaceutical factory's director xue jinshan, and so on. they were all waiting in the conference room.

  when everyone saw xia ruofei, they all stood up and greeted the elusive chairman.

  xia ruofei came to the front and made a gesture of pressing down. he smiled and said,""everyone has worked hard during this period of time. please take a seat!"

  after he finished speaking, xia ruofei sat down. everyone waited for him to sit down before taking their seats.

  feng jing had already arranged the seats in advance. there was an empty seat on both sides of xia ruofei. feng jing sat on xia ruofei's right side, while the seat opposite feng jing was naturally reserved for zheng yongshou.

  that was originally dong yun's seat, but now that she had given it up, dong yun moved back one seat to sit beside feng jing. naturally, everyone else's seats also moved back one seat. however, this was feng jing's arrangement, so no one had any objections. they were just curious about zheng yongshou, who was the first person after the ceo.
