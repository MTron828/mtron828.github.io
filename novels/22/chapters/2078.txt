The only thing that the distributors had to spend money on was nothing more than two years of free maintenance. However, such maintenance items were priced very high. In fact, the consumables and parts used for the maintenance were directly purchased from the manufacturers, so the cost was not as scary as the marked price.

Of course, to Xia ruofei, the preferential conditions that Qin Lan had given him were still very practical. In total, he had saved at least one million Yuan.

Xia ruofei thought for a moment and said,””Manager Qin, I’ll think about it. You can go back to your work!”

Seeing that Xia ruofei did not make a decision immediately, Qin Lan could not help but feel a little disappointed. However, on second thought, this was a deal worth tens of millions. How could she expect the other party to place an order in such a short time?

She revealed a warm smile and said,””Alright! Mr. Xia, if you need anything, you can contact me at any time! This is my name card!”

After he finished speaking, Qin Lan handed over his name card with both hands.

Xia ruofei took the name card and nodded with a smile.””Good! I’ll contact you after I’ve considered it. ”

With that, Xia ruofei put the business card in his pocket and left.

After he drove back to the little villa at Taoyuan farm, he quickly searched for information on the azmu 100 Leonardo on his computer.

He had to admit that Qin Lan’s introduction had indeed moved him.

The information disclosed on the internet showed that the price Qin Lan gave him was not an exaggeration. Several professional yacht websites also gave a reference price of about 70 million. In addition, this yacht was indeed loved by the rich and celebrities. There were several rich and celebrities who owned this yacht listed on the internet, including the former richest man in China and a world – Class sports star.

Xia ruofei had always been very decisive in his actions. Besides, tens of millions of Yuan was nothing to him now. Even if he wanted to buy a private jet that was worth hundreds of millions, he had the ability to do so. However, now that he had the Gulfstream business jet that Li Yifu had given him as a gift, there was no need to buy a private jet for the time being. Buying a yacht to enjoy himself was even more simple.

Therefore, after browsing through the information on the internet, Xia ruofei found Qin Lan’s business card and dialed the number on it ...

After Qin Lan received Xia ruofei, she quickly threw herself into other work.

Their company was not only in the sales of azmu’s yachts. They were also running the Yacht Club and providing a comprehensive protection service for the club members. After all, the yacht consumer group was not large. It was not enough to just rely on selling yachts. The after – Sales paid service could bring in more profits.

Xia ruofei did not place the order on the spot. Qin Lan felt a little regretful, but she did not feel too disappointed. After all, it was such an expensive item. She did not have much hope.

Besides, Qin Lan could feel that Xia ruofei was interested in this yacht. This was a great gain for her. The high – end customer base was built up through the accumulation of daily life.

When Xia ruofei bought the sports yacht, he had left his contact information. After sending Xia ruofei off, Qin Lan immediately asked Liao Bo for Xia ruofei’s phone number and saved it in her phone.

Therefore, when her phone rang, Qin Lan immediately saw that it was Xia ruofei. She was overjoyed. She did not expect Xia ruofei to make a decision so quickly.

Qin Lan immediately stopped what she was doing and picked up the phone in a hurry. She said enthusiastically,””Mr. Xia, how are you?”

“Manager Qin, I’m personally quite interested in the azmu 100 Leonado yacht you introduced this morning.” Xia ruofei got straight to the point.”If I place an order now, how long will it take for the yacht to be delivered to me?”

Qin Lan quickly said,”Mr. Xia, the sales of the yacht are usually done after the order is placed. The manufacturer will then start production. Azmu is a relatively popular yacht brand and usually has a lot of orders. Therefore, the delivery period for large yachts like this is usually about a year.”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but frown.””It’s going to take a year?”

Qin Lan quickly explained,”Mr. Xia, one year is already considered very fast. This is only a general model yacht. If it’s a customized one, it will take even longer.”

Perhaps he felt that it was not very convincing, Qin Lan immediately added,””In fact, whether it’s a private yacht or a private jet, the delivery period is relatively long. It’s said that the Gulfstream’s commercial plane takes about three years on average to be delivered! The azmu yacht that Ali’s Boss Ma ordered had been in production for more than a year. So ... One year is not that long ...”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,””I thought two or three months would be enough, just like the yacht I bought ... I didn’t expect it to take as long as a year ... Forget it, manager Qin, I’ll think about it!”

Seeing that Xia ruofei was about to place the order but backed out because of the delivery period, Qin Lan was anxious. However, she could not do anything about it. If it was a problem in other aspects, she could still ask for instructions from the higher – ups, but the delivery period was determined by the manufacturer. She had no way to change it.

“Alright, alright! You can contact me at any time after you’ve considered it!” Qin Lan said and then added,”Mr. Xia, actually, the delivery period is not too long. You can find a friend to understand ...”

“I understand. Thank you, manager Qin!” Xia ruofei said.

Xia ruofei was not easily influenced by others. He felt that the delivery period was too long. If he could not accept it, he would not change his mind no matter what Qin Lan said.

After Qin Lan hung up the phone, her face was filled with disappointment.

When Qin Lan answered the phone, Liao Bo was reporting to her in the office. Liao Bo was going to leave, but when he heard Qin Lan call the other party “Mr. Xia”, he immediately knew that it was his previous client, Xia ruofei. Therefore, he decided to stay.

Liao Bo looked at Qin Lan and asked with concern,””Manager, is that Mr. Xia?”

“Yeah!” Qin Lan nodded.

“Are you talking about the azmu 100 Leonardo?” Liao Bo immediately asked.

Xia ruofei suddenly had an idea today and was interested in the azmu 100 Leonardo yacht. Liao Bo was the first to know about it and that was why he asked.

“Isn’t that so?”Qin Lan sighed. I heard that he already wanted to place an order, but ... When he heard that the delivery period would take a year, he gave up ...”

When Liao Bo heard this, he smiled bitterly and said,”one year is indeed a bit long. However, we have no way to control this!” Manager, forget it, forget it. It’s our order, so it can’t run away no matter what. It’s money that we shouldn’t be earning, so there’s no point in being anxious!”

“En!” Qin Lan rubbed her temples and said,”I’m just a little unwilling. I’m very close to getting this order ... Sigh! Xiao Liao, where were you just now? Let’s continue!”

“Oh!” Liao Bo said.

Then, Liao Bo suddenly patted his head and asked anxiously,””Manager, do you still remember the model of the yacht that President Huang ordered?”

“President Huang?” Qin Lan could not react for a moment.

“Director Huang of the Tianyang group!” Liao Bo reminded him,”he’s the client you personally contacted. How could you have forgotten?”

Qin Lan was suddenly enlightened. Her eyes brightened as she said,””Azmu 100 Leonardo! CEO Huang has ordered the azmu 100 Leonardo!”

Liao Bo and Qin Lan looked at each other and both of them revealed a look of surprise. Liao Bo then said,””Manager, do you think it’s possible? If it’s possible, then it’s the best of both worlds!”
