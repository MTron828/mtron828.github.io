“I’m not afraid that you’ll get lost!”Zhou leiyun laughed out loud.

“Then what are you worried about?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

“I’m just worried that you’ll be beaten up by the bar?a fans!” Zhou leiyun laughed out loud.”You know, this is Barcelona. Although I don’t want to admit it, I have to admit that the number of Barcelona fans in this city far exceeds that of our Spanish fans! You’ve abused Barcelona so badly in the game a few days ago. Don’t the Barcelona fans hate you to the core?”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment and said,”that makes sense!” Does that mean I’ll have to disguise myself later?”

“I must wrap myself up tightly!” Zhou leiyun joked.

“Alright! If I’m surrounded, I’ll say your name, general manager Zhou!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Just report! However, I can’t guarantee that it will be useful!” Zhou leiyun said with a smile.

Xia ruofei and Zhou leiyun chatted for a while and then hung up.

Then, he used the hotel’s landline to call Ling Qingxue’s room. After asking, he found out that the two of them had already woken up, so he called them downstairs to have breakfast.

While they were eating, Xia ruofei said that he wanted to go to the Spanish people’s Dani Halk base. Song Wei and Ling Qingxue, who were a little tired from walking yesterday and wanted to rest in the hotel, both said that they wanted to go together.

Xia ruofei did not expect them to be interested in football training. However, since they were willing to go, he naturally did not have any objections. He was even happy to have someone to accompany him!

The three of them quickly finished their breakfast and left the hotel without going upstairs.

Dani halke base was not too far from the hotel, so Xia ruofei and the other two did not call for a taxi and walked there directly.

They had not gone far from the hotel when they ran into a few bar?a fans. They did not know if it was Zhou leiyun’s jinx or if there were really that many bar?a fans in the city.

These bar?a fans recognized Xia ruofei at a glance. On the second day of the match, Xia ruofei’s photo had made the front pages of major Spain sports media. Although in the eyes of many Europeans, Easterners seemed to look the same, they still remembered the face of this “enemy.”

Fortunately, there were only a few football hooligans, and the game had been over for a few days. The urge to skin Xia ruofei and pull out his tendons had faded a lot. In addition, the “fountain” incident and the fake news from The Sports Daily had also embarrassed the bar?a fans. So they only glared at Xia ruofei and did not really come to cause trouble.

Of course, if they really wanted to cause trouble, they would definitely be the ones at a disadvantage.

Not only was Xia ruofei unafraid, but even song Wei and Ling Qingxue were unafraid as they stood in front of the cultivators. No matter how strong a few ordinary people were, they would not pose a threat at all. Their strength was not on the same level at all.

Therefore, Song Wei and Ling Qingxue also smiled and stood on either side of Xia ruofei. They even secretly hoped that these Barcelona fans would come and cause trouble!

However, they were destined to be disappointed. Even when the two sides passed by each other, the fans did not move.

Xia ruofei, Ling Qingxue, and Song Wei were talking and laughing as they walked towards Dani hark training base.

They had all woken up early today, so even if they walked there, they would be able to arrive before the training began.

The three of them arrived at the entrance of Dani Halk training base, where they finally saw Spanish fans instead of bar?a fans.

The Spain had been tougher in these two rounds, especially after their away victory over bar?a. The enthusiasm of the fans was even higher. Many fans would rush to the team’s training every day to express their support when the players came to the training base and left after training, or to ask for autographs and photos from the players.

In fact, there were fans waiting at the door every day during the team training.

However, after the away victory over bar?a, there were more fans who came.

When Xia ruofei, Song Wei, and Ling Qingxue arrived at the entrance of Dani Halk base, they were shocked by the number of fans.

There happened to be a car in front driving towards Dani Halk base, and the fans cheered. The car slowed down and finally came to a stop.

In fact, the fans on the Spain side were relatively restrained. They would not go crazy chasing after stars, knowing that stars were also public figures and needed their own space.

However, since the car had stopped, the fans would naturally surround it. A young fan was very excited in front of the window on the passenger side and handed a Jersey in, obviously asking for an autograph.

Xia ruofei and the other two had sharp ears. They heard the fans shouting Wu Lei’s name.

Xia ruofei could not help but feel surprised. He did not expect to run into Wu Lei at the entrance of the training base.

In fact, it was still early for the training to start, but Wu Lei had always been diligent, so he came early every day to give himself extra practice.

He had not been Spain for long, so he had not gotten his driver’s license yet. The one who drove him was a local translator hired by the club in Barcelona. The translator’s name was Wu Junfeng, and he was from the same family as Wu Lei 500 years ago. He had studied in Spain before and later stayed here, working in an import and export trading company, mainly trading with China. When Wu Lei entered La Liga, he had just quit his job, so he applied for a Spanish club.
