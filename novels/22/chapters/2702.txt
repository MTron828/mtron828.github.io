2703 Success (1)

After going around all the points, Xia ruofei was very satisfied.

Li Yifu’s cultivation level might still be relatively low, so he couldn’t be of much help when facing a strong opponent, but he was very good at carrying out tasks. He had indeed completed the tasks assigned to him meticulously.

The partial transformation of the Peach Blossom Island could be said to be a slight change that would affect the entire Island. No deviation was allowed at any point, or else it would have a large or small impact on the formation.

Hence, Xia ruofei’s construction plan was extremely detailed.

Even so, he was still a little worried. After all, the plan was executed by humans, and as long as it was done by humans, there would inevitably be mistakes.

But today, Xia ruofei had inspected every place and did not find any mistakes. The position, size, depth, and the placement of materials were all in accordance with the construction plan without any deviation.

It was clear how much effort Li Yifu had put in these few days.

Xia ruofei looked at Li Yifu with satisfaction and said,””Foster husband, you’ve done your job very well, even beyond my imagination! Very good!”

“Senior granduncle,” Li Yifu replied humbly.”I can’t help much. I can only do my best!”

Xia ruofei sighed.”Do your best. It’s easy to say these words. How many people can really do these words to the extreme?”

Then, Xia ruofei said,”foster husband, don’t worry. All your efforts will not go to waste. The Peach Blossom Island is my opportunity. It’s also your opportunity.” After the situation here has stabilized, you can stay permanently on the Peach Blossom Island! In terms of cultivation, I will also guide you with all my heart. I can’t guarantee anything else, but I can definitely help you break through the shackles of the Qi refining stage!”

Li Yifu’s entire body trembled as he said with tears in his eyes,””This disciple will never forget the great kindness of martial granduncle! In this life, I will follow martial granduncle’s lead!”

If it weren’t for the brothers of the Hong sect working not far away, Li Yifu would have knelt on the ground.

His path of cultivation had been too difficult. Before he met Xia ruofei, he had only managed to reach refined Qi Level 3 after decades of painstaking effort. After that, Xia ruofei casually gave him a few pointers and he broke through to refined Qi Level 4. Although this was also due to the accumulation of resources, without Xia ruofei’s guidance, it would not be easy to change from quantity to quality.

Later on, Xia ruofei even gave him a spiritual crystal and guided him on his cultivation a few times. As a result, his cultivation speed suddenly increased. He was almost 90 years old. Even if a cultivator’s body was stronger than an ordinary person ‘s, it was inevitable that his vitality would start to weaken. It was basically impossible for him to improve his cultivation. However, with Xia ruofei’s help, he was now close to touching the bottleneck of refined Qi Level 5.

In the past, Li Yifu didn’t even dare to think about it.

Now that Xia ruofei had obtained such a great opportunity on the Peach Blossom Island, he did not forget about him and even promised to let him stay on the island permanently. To him, this was a God – given opportunity. If what Xia ruofei said was true, breaking through the shackles of the Qi refining stage meant a complete transformation. He would have a chance to live again and his lifespan would be greatly extended.

Thinking of this, Li Yifu couldn’t help but tremble with excitement.

Xia ruofei could understand Li Yifu’s feelings. He patted Li Yifu’s shoulder and said,””Foster husband, you and I are from the same sect, and my seniority is higher than yours. As a senior in the sect, it’s only right for me to think a little more for you.”

Seeing Li Yifu open his mouth, Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand, saying,””Alright, alright! Work hard first! Let’s settle this crisis first, or else everything will be equal to zero. ”

“Yes, martial granduncle!” Li Yifu lowered his head and said.

There were some things that did not need to be said. Li Yifu did not say anything more, but in his heart, he already regarded Xia ruofei as the person he respected the most. He also secretly made up his mind that if his grand uncle – Master really encountered any danger in this crisis, he would risk his life to protect his grand uncle – Master even if his cultivation was low.

Xia ruofei went back to the warehouse next to the airport alone, while Li Yifu stayed at the construction site. He had been like this most of the time these days, personally watching over everything, no matter big or small.

……

Just as Xia ruofei had expected, Wang Boshan called benilatti in the afternoon.

Benilatti followed Xia ruofei’s instructions and hung up the phone nervously. After more than an hour, he returned Wang Boshan’s call.

“Mr. Wang, it wasn’t convenient to answer the phone just now.” “Our boss is back,” benilatti said.”He might be busy for the next few days. It’s best to send me a text first. I’ll call you back when it’s convenient.” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Wang Boshan said,”I’m sorry ... You didn’t raise any suspicion, did you?”

Benilatti said in a proud tone,””How could the boss suspect me? And it’s all up to me to deal with the local people of carnaught. At this time, boss ...”

Halfway through, benilatti suddenly stopped and asked in a playful manner,””Mr. Wang, is there anything good that you’re looking for me for this time?”

Wang Boshan said,”I still want to know more about Xia ruofei’s situation. He should have returned to Paradise Island today, right?” Where has he gone, who has he met, what has he done, as long as it’s related to him, I want to know. “
