Chapter 1925 A good show (2)

Liu haojun hurriedly pulled the bathrobe over to cover Fang Chenchen’s naked body, and at the same time, he pulled out a piece of clothing to cover his lower body. Then, he roared angrily,””Who are you people? You don’t want to live, do you?”

Dong Liu and Da Liu’s eyes turned red when they saw this. Da Liu was even more furious when he saw how arrogant Liu haojun was. He gritted his teeth and shouted,””Fuck! Brothers, let’s go! Kill him!”

He was the first to rush up and kick Liu haojun to the ground.

Other than the two underlings who were recording the whole process with their phones, the rest of the people also swarmed up and punched and kicked Liu haojun mercilessly.

Liu haojun wailed like a ghost and howled like a Wolf,”F * ck!” Do you know who I am? How dare you hit me ... Stop! Stop ... Ah ... Quickly stop ... I beg you, please stop ...”

In the beginning, Liu haojun tried to use his identity, but Liu Da and the others didn’t give him a chance to speak. Their fists and feet fell on Liu haojun like raindrops.

These were all people who mingled in the underworld every day. Fighting was a common occurrence for them. Even if their martial arts skills were average and they did not know any moves, they knew very well which parts of their bodies would cause severe pain. At the same time, it was not easy to kill them.

Liu haojun was a pampered young master. How could he bear such a beating? Soon, he lost his initial arrogance and began to beg for mercy with snot and tears.

Fang Chenchen clutched the bathrobe tightly as she sat on the ground, trembling.

She looked at Liu Dong, who was standing in the middle of the living room, in despair.

Liu Dong’s eyes were fixed on Fang Chenchen, and their gazes met. Fang Chenchen had never seen Liu Dong look at her like that. The love and care in his eyes had disappeared, replaced by a coldness that made Fang Chenchen’s heart tremble, and a bottomless despair ...

Da Liu had only kicked Liu haojun a few times in the beginning, but he retreated after the underlings went up. He glanced at Fang Chenchen and suddenly got angry. He rushed over and pulled at the bathrobe she was using to cover her embarrassment.

Da Liu cursed,”you have the nerve to do such an immoral thing, and you’re still afraid of being seen!” Why didn’t you cover yourself so well when you were having sex with that wild man just now?”

Then, Da Liu turned his head and shouted to one of his underlings who was filming,””Come closer, take a few close – ups of this shameless woman!”

Fang Chenchen screamed and grabbed her bathrobe, but how could she be stronger than Da Liu? Soon, her bathrobe was torn to pieces, and her body was exposed everywhere, covering this part and exposing that part.

Fang Chenchen looked at Liu Dong in despair, her eyes pleading.

In the past, even if Fang Chenchen had sprained her ankle, Liu Dong would have gone over to her and asked about her well – being. But now, Liu Dong was only looking at Fang Chenchen’s embarrassed look coldly and had no intention of helping her.

All of this was clearly captured by the phone.

Liu haojun screamed and shouted,””Quickly stop! Stop! I’m Liu haojun, the Deputy Secretary of the provincial Committee of Changping County! You are beating up a national staff! You’ll have to go to jail!”

Da Liu separated his underlings and walked up to Liu haojun. He scolded,””Go to hell! Are you trying to scare me? I don’t care who you are, but since you dared to steal my brother’s wife, I’ll cripple you!”

After saying that, Da Liu grabbed a steel pipe from one of his underlings and smashed it down on Liu haojun’s leg without thinking ...

Crack!

“Ah!”

Liu haojun let out a heart – wrenching scream. The severe pain from his broken leg made him tremble all over. After a few wails like ghosts and wolves, he actually fainted from the pain.

On the other side, Fang Chenchen’s bathrobe had been thrown away by Da Liu. She could only squat on the ground and curl up into a ball, hoping to cover her sensitive parts as much as possible. And the little brother in charge of filming was still faithfully recording.

When Liu haojun’s leg was broken, Liu Dong, who had been unmoving with a livid face, finally spoke,””Da, that’s enough ... Don’t kill anyone!”

Although Liu Dong wanted to kill Liu haojun, he still had a bit of rationality left in him. At least he knew that he had to pay with his life for killing someone. Besides, it was Liu Da who stood up for him today, and he could not drag him down with him.

Da Liu gave the steel pipe back to the underling, then clapped his hands and said,””He’s getting off easy ... I’ll ask about this grandson’s identity later and go loosen his bones every few days. Unless he runs out of the three mountains and never comes back, he won’t be able to live well!”

At this moment, there was a commotion outside the door.

“We’re here, we’re here!”

” 1902, right? I think I heard the sound of fighting ...”

“Hurry! When the machine is turned on ...”

Then, a group of people appeared at the door of unit 1902. They were much more professional than Liu Dong and Liu Da. Some of them were carrying professional cameras, while others were holding windbreakers. After taking a look at the situation in the room, they immediately rushed in.

Liu Dong saw the southeast province TV station’s logo on the camera and was a little confused.

Why are the media here?

What he was most worried about now was that this matter would spread like wildfire, so he had only gone to find Da Liu when he had no other choice. He had also repeatedly reminded Da Liu to keep it a secret.

Now, the media had actually come, and it was even the provincial media. If this matter were to be broadcast on television, wouldn’t everyone know about it?

A female reporter in a light blue suit walked up with a microphone. When she saw the scene in front of her, she knew that the informant was most likely right.

A man in rags was lying on the ground, his thigh swollen. There was also a woman who was completely naked. She was curled up into a ball and her eyes were dull.

The female reporter felt that the woman looked familiar, but she couldn’t remember where she had seen her before. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

They were all from the media circle of Sanshan, and they had the opportunity to meet on various occasions. Moreover, Fang Chenchen had been quite popular in Sanshan recently, so it was not surprising that the female reporter had an impression of her.

However, Fang Chenchen was in a sorry state. Da Liu had slapped her in the face when she was snatching the bathrobe. The corner of her mouth was swollen, and her hair was disheveled. She was very different from the graceful and imposing appearance she had on screen, so the female reporter did not recognize her. She only thought she looked familiar.

The cameras had already started rolling. The female reporter asked,””May I ask what happened here? Why did you guys fight?”

Before Liu Dong could stop the reporters, Da Liu already said angrily,””Do you still need to ask? This woman is having an affair behind her husband’s back, and we caught her in bed!”

Da Liu was in a fit of anger and had long forgotten about Liu Dong’s instructions. Of course, the main thing was that it did not happen to him, so he was more angry than Dong Liu was in deep despair. Similarly, when the reporters appeared, Dong Liu’s first thought was to stop them from reporting the news, while Da Liu’s first thought was to expose the adulterous couple and ruin their reputation!

The female reporter looked at the camera and said,””Hello, everyone. I’m Liu Yuan, a reporter from the city Intelligence station. We’re currently in a residential building. There were two groups of people fighting over a family dispute just now. Let’s interview the parties involved to see what exactly happened ...”

Then, the female reporter put the microphone close to Da Liu and asked,””Sir, can you tell us what happened?”

Dong Liu saw Da Liu’s indignant face in front of the camera and felt like he had just been cursed. He tried to pull at Da Liu’s clothes twice, but Da Liu shook him off each time. Da Liu, who was facing the camera, didn’t even pay attention to him.

Liu Dong felt that everything was out of his control. He looked at the reporters and cameras, but he was puzzled.

Why did the reporters suddenly appear? And they came too quickly? It had been less than ten minutes since he had rushed into the room, and the reporters had already arrived at the scene! Could it be that they had wings and could fly over?

Liu Dong could not figure it out, but he had a vague feeling that all of this must have something to do with the ‘justice is not absent’ WeChat.

Unit 1902 was in chaos. At the same time, in the rental house of the old community opposite, Xu Yougang saw the scene he directed in the surveillance video. He smiled and picked up the walkie – talkie, saying,””Cave four, cave two, cave three, prepare to wrap up!”
