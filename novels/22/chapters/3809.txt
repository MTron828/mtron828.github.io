Chapter 3810  Zhenyuan pill (2)

  That was why Xia ruofei had gotten used to alternating between the two techniques.

  After about an hour, Xia ruofei had finished absorbing the essence enhancing pill.

  As a result, his cultivation base had increased by another level on top of the foundation he had just built.

  The golden light on the ninth Dragon - shaped elixir pattern became brighter, and the patterns became clearer.

  However, Xia ruofei could feel that the increase in his cultivation this time seemed to be smaller than the first time he had taken the primordial enhancement pill.

  However, he didn't feel strange or disappointed. The effect of the primordial enhancement pill was the best when it was taken for the first time. If one continued to take it, especially after such a short period of time, the effect would definitely weaken. In fact, it was similar to the body developing resistance to it.

  Otherwise, as long as a cultivator continuously took the essence enhancing pill, they could rapidly increase their cultivation.

  Although this kind of thing was impossible in the current cultivation world, there were still cultivators who had such wealth during the golden age of the cultivation world, especially those who were good at alchemy.

  However, it was precisely because of the existence of the weakening effect that no one would completely rely on taking medicine to improve their cultivation.

  Xia ruofei had already expected this. Of course, he did not care much about it. It would be helpful to his cultivation anyway. He would save as much time as he could. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

  He rested for a moment, and immediately took the third and last Zhen Yuan pill.

  Then, Xia ruofei focused on circulating the "great Dao technique" and spent another hour to completely absorb the medicinal properties of the last Zhenyuan pill.

  Xia ruofei checked his cultivation level and nodded with a satisfied expression.

  These three Zhen Yuan pills had all been consumed, and although the effects of the consumption were decreasing, overall, it was at least equivalent to five months of his bitter cultivation.

  The effectiveness of the primordial enhancement pill was not to be underestimated. Xia ruofei's five months of cultivation in this state was equivalent to a normal cultivator's several years or even more than ten years of cultivation. It was shocking that he could achieve such an effect after taking three pills.

  The purplish - Gold golden elixir was still spinning in Xia ruofei's dantian. The nine Dragon - shaped elixir patterns on it were shining with a golden light. If one did not look closely, one would not be able to tell the difference between the golden light of the nine elixir patterns. However, Xia ruofei knew very well that the ninth Dragon - shaped elixir pattern had not been completely lit up. It was slightly different from the other eight Dragon - shaped elixir patterns that had been completely lit up.

  However, Xia ruofei was not disappointed. If he had to cultivate in isolation, he would need at least five months to reach this level. However, he had only spent three to four hours. In addition, this ninth Dragon - shaped pill vein was also very close to being completely lit up. He was very clear that even if he didn't have a pill like the essence enhancing pill, it wouldn't take long for him to completely light up this pill vein if he completely relied on normal cultivation.

  Moreover, as the golden light of the ninth Dragon - shaped core pattern became brighter and brighter, Xia ruofei could feel the bottleneck between the Golden core stage and the original infant stage more and more clearly.

  Previously, it was only a vague perception, but now he could clearly feel the bottleneck.

  All of this indicated that the distance between his cultivation and the original infant stage was perhaps only a thin layer of window paper!

  Xia ruofei was very satisfied with the effect of the three Qi replenishing pills.

  He stood up and stretched his muscles, then stood in front of the window of the bamboo pavilion and looked out at the sea, taking a short rest.

  Ten minutes later, Xia ruofei returned to the house. He sat down cross - legged on the Jade futon, calmed his Qi and concentrated, and quickly entered a state of cultivation.

  Without the Qi replenishing pill, Xia ruofei felt that his cultivation speed had slowed down by a lot. Of course, this was because the contrast was too strong. In fact, Xia ruofei's cultivation speed was still many times faster than the average golden core stage cultivator.

  The purple Yuan crystals he had placed around him were also being rapidly consumed. Dense and pure ling qi poured into his body like seawater. The purple - Gold golden core was constantly spinning, absorbing the yuan Qi produced by cultivation. The Dragon - shaped core patterns on the surface of the Golden core also emitted bursts of golden light, causing the entire golden core to become dazzling.

  The patterns on the Last Dragon - shaped pill pattern became clearer and clearer, and the golden light became brighter and brighter.

  The difficulty of lighting up the Dragon - shaped pill veins gradually increased. The first few pill veins might take a few days, a dozen days, or at most a few dozen days to light up one. Slowly, it would take two to three months to light up one. It would take even longer to reach the Last Dragon - shaped pill pattern. Three Zhen Yuan pills were equivalent to at least five months of hard cultivation, and he still hadn't been able to completely light up the pill pattern.

  Xia ruofei was completely engrossed in his cultivation. He was neither happy nor sad. Naturally, he was not in a rush. The mystic origin Scripture was constantly circulating. The purple origin crystal and the dense spiritual energy from the outside world were constantly being absorbed. His cultivation was also slowly but non - stop in this cultivation process.

  Don't look at how it was just one last step away, it was very time - consuming to really cultivate.

  After all, there were no longer any pills like the Qi replenishing pill that could directly increase cultivation. Xia ruofei could only rely on cultivation bit by bit to complete the final accumulation.

  If it was an ordinary cultivator, like Chen Nanfeng, it would take several years to accumulate the last bit of energy.

  Fortunately, Xia ruofei was blessed with unique conditions and had no lack of cultivation resources. Hence, his progress was much faster than that of ordinary cultivators.

  He spent about five days 'time, and after using another batch of purple origin crystals, he finally completely lit up the Last Dragon - shaped pill pattern.

  At the moment when the last pattern was lit up, Xia ruofei felt as if his entire body was trembling. The purplish - Gold golden elixir that was spinning in his dantian suddenly bloomed with a dazzling light. The brightness of the golden light suddenly increased by several times.

  The nine Dragon - shaped patterns were completely lit up.

  The nine elixir patterns also seemed to be alive. Nine divine Dragons of different postures seemed to be about to burst out of the surface of the purplish - Gold golden elixir. The dazzling golden light was emitted by these nine elixir patterns. All the golden light gathered on the surface of the purplish - Gold golden elixir and then suddenly bloomed, as dazzling as a star.
