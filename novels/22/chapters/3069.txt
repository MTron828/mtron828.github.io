3070 A small punishment and a big warning (2)

The taxi driver had completely given up.

Although he was not “Almighty” enough to get director Li’s phone number and could not verify the authenticity just now, the taxi drivers had actually seen director li more than once. Moreover, he had entered the “meltdown class” once because of a violation and had the honor of listening to director Li’s lecture in person, so he was quite familiar with this man’s voice.

The taxi driver didn’t dare to make a sound at all. He could only look at Sun Xiao with pleading eyes and keep shaking his head.

Sun Xiao looked at the driver, then smiled and said,””Director li, it’s been a while since we last met. I was thinking of having a meal together when we have time! I have something to trouble you with. ”

“No problem!” Supervisor Li said very enthusiastically,”it’s my honor to be invited by CEO Sun! I’m always free! In addition ... If director sun has any instructions, just say it directly! Even if I’m not capable enough, I’ll try my best to create the right conditions for you!”

“Alright then!” Sun Xiao said happily,”it’s not easy to talk over the phone. Let’s find a time to meet and talk.” Director Li, I won’t bother you anymore. I’ll ask you out when I’ve set the time!”

“Alright! Alright!” Director Li said repeatedly.

After sun Xiao hung up the phone, he looked at the taxi driver with a faint smile and asked,””Can you answer my question properly now?”

The taxi driver felt that his back was drenched in sweat, but he was still a little glad that Sun Xiao did not directly report this matter to director li, which meant that there was still room for change.

At this moment, how could he still dare to have any thoughts of getting lucky?

The taxi driver said,””Brother! I was wrong! I was wrong! Brother, please let me go! I won’t dare to do it again!”

“Say it!” Sun Xiao said impatiently.

He had been here for a long time, and he still had a guest to entertain in the hotel!

“Yes, yes, yes ...” The taxi driver quickly said.

Then, he poured out everything about how he had modified the taximeter. He even personally got into the car and demonstrated the switching between the two modes of the taximeter.

In fact, there were a few taxi drivers in tai city who did the same thing. However, they were unlucky to have met the serious Xia ruofei.

After giving his honest instructions, the taxi driver looked at Sun Xiao pitifully and pleaded,””Brother! Do you think ... You can be lenient? I won’t dare to do it again ...”

Sun Xiao pondered for a moment, trying to understand Xia ruofei’s “spirit of speech,” then he said,””First, how did you change the taximeter? change it back to how it was when you go back!”

“Yes, yes, yes!” The taxi driver nodded like a chicken pecking at rice, and then he vowed solemnly,”I swear to God that I will operate in good faith in the future and will never engage in such crooked ways again!”

“Second,” Sun Xiao continued,”the transport management will punish you ...”

“Ah?” The taxi driver couldn’t help but cry out.

This time, he had immediately admitted defeat, and his attitude was very sincere. He didn’t expect to be punished again. Wouldn’t that mean that all his efforts had been in vain? He was filled with disappointment.

Sun Xiao said impatiently,”what” ah “? He had to take responsibility for his mistakes! You’re an adult, don’t you know this? However, your husband also said just now that as long as you sincerely admit your mistakes and repent, you shouldn’t be beaten to death. The punishment from the transportation management is also a warning to you. If you can learn from this lesson, you will naturally be able to eat this bowl of rice in the future!”

The taxi driver finally understood that the other party was leaving him a way out, but it was a little “the death penalty can be avoided, but the punishment can not be avoided.”

He couldn’t help but feel a burst of regret, but since things had come to this, regret was certainly useless. He could only hang his head and say dejectedly,””Brother, I know ...”

Sun Xiao wrote down the driver’s name and license plate number, then said,””Go! Remember, don’t try to be lucky. The transportation management will focus on your car. If they find any more crooked ways, don’t blame me for not leaving you a way out!”

“Yes, yes, yes! I’ll remember that!” The taxi driver hurriedly said.

Sun Xiao handed the money to the taxi driver and said,””This was left behind by that gentleman. It’s a total of 40 yuan, enough for your ride.”

The taxi driver was so scared that he waved his hands and said,””Don ‘t! Don’ t! Brother, I don’t dare to take this money ...”

“That’s a different matter!” Sun Xiao frowned and said,”of course, I have to give you the car fare that should be yours. Otherwise, wouldn’t it look like that gentleman is trying to cheat you of the car fare and is deliberately looking for trouble? Do you think that man is that kind of person?”

“I wouldn’t dare!” The taxi driver said quickly. He could not help but shiver when he thought of Xia ruofei’s gaze and tone just now.

“Still!” Sun Xiao said. Then, he directly put the money in through the window on the side of the front passenger seat and threw it on the front passenger seat. He said,””Alright, you can go! Remember what I just said!”

“Yes, yes, yes! Thank you, brother!” The taxi driver bowed and bowed, then got into the car and left as if he was escaping.

After he left the sky Peak Hotel, he went straight to the repair shop that modified his meter last time. The shop had even registered his ID card, driver’s license, and license plate number. Moreover, it was obvious that the shop owner had eyes and ears everywhere. How could an ordinary brother like him disobey his orders?

Moreover, this time, he was really scared out of his wits and didn’t dare to have any crooked thoughts.

Tianfeng hotel.

After sun Xiao finished dealing with the matter of the car rental, he quickly walked into the hotel and went straight to Suite 3.

The No. 3 suite was actually located in an auxiliary building behind the hotel’s main building. This entire building was not open to the public, but was used to receive cultivators and friends who passed by.

To be precise, Sun Xiao was actually the manager of this building, but it was located in the Tianfeng hotel.

Of course, in terms of importance, the entire Tianfeng hotel was not even a fraction of the value of this building.

That was why Sun Xiao’s status was so high.

In this building, the first 10 suites were reserved to entertain distinguished guests. Ordinary cultivators would not be arranged to stay in these suites.

The first and second suites were for the sect master and the young sect master of the first heaven sect.

Xia ruofei was arranged to stay in Suite 3 because of the name card that Chen Xuan had left behind.

Surrounded by green trees, the subsidiary building was located in the best location in the entire sky Peak Hotel. The interior decoration was also very exquisite. It didn’t look particularly luxurious, but in fact, it was full of ingenuity. Anyone with a discerning eye could tell that this was the real high – end. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Although Suite No. 3 was called a suite, it was actually a little similar to a Presidential Suite.

There were six to seven rooms in this suite. In addition to the Super large master bedroom, there was also a room for the attendants, a study, a living room, an activity room, a guest room, and so on. There was even a kitchen with very complete facilities.

This suite was much larger than many commercial buildings. In fact, it was a very luxurious flat floor.

When sun Xiao arrived at No. 3 suite, Xia ruofei had already settled down.

The service staff also brought fruit platters, snacks, and red wine immediately. Anyone who could stay in such a suite was definitely a distinguished guest. Therefore, there was no need for Sun Xiao to give any instructions. The service staff of the Annex building took the initiative to do the work first.

“Senior!” After sun Xiao knocked on the door and entered, he quickly bowed when he saw Xia ruofei and said,”I’ve already settled the issue of the rental car.”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. By the way, my surname is Xia. Don’t call me senior, just ... Young master Xia!”

“Yes! Young master Xia!” Sun Xiao quickly said.

Then, he reported to Xia ruofei the results of the investigation and his preliminary handling of the situation.
