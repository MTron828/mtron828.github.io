Chapter 877: Chapter 561 – enemies on a narrow road (1)

Translator: 549690339

In the corridor outside the private room stood a young man in a full set of Armani casual clothes. There were a few people behind him. After hearing President Zheng’s words, they couldn’t help but change their expressions.

The young man was yang Jianren, who had just spoken.

His face was a little pale, and it was obvious that he was usually drunk and lustful. Although he was covered in branded goods from head to toe, it could not hide his wretched temperament.

As soon as President Zheng finished speaking, yang Jianren’s bean – sized eyes suddenly shot out a dark look, and his face suddenly sank. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Yang Jianren stared at President Zheng and asked,””Elder Zheng, what’s the meaning of this?”

President Zheng’s face twitched, but when he thought of the person in the room, he gritted his teeth and said,””Young master yang, I’m sorry. The moonlight lotus pond private room was indeed reserved by another guest. I can’t break the rules ...”

“Young master yang, I can arrange a room for you in the moon Shadow Pavilion. The environment is similar to the moonlight in the Lotus pond ...” President Zheng said.

“Bullshit!” Yang Jianren cursed,”elder Zheng, who are you trying to fool? I gave you face, but you don’t want it, right? Do you know who I’m treating today? Can you bear the responsibility for delaying my hospitality to the guests?”

“Young master yang, how would I dare not to give you face?” President Zheng said with a smile. However, the people here are all our members, and they made the reservation first. There’s no reason to force them to change!”

President Zheng was a businessman. It was in his nature to seek advantages and avoid disadvantages. If there were other members in the moonlight lotus pond room today, even if it was only he Feng, he would definitely have begged them to change rooms.

If yang Jianren’s name was mentioned when necessary, most people would still give him face.

However, Xia ruofei was also among them.

President Zheng didn’t dare to say this no matter what.

The cooperation between West River Moon Club and the Paradise Corporation in vegetable and fruit supply was secondary. The key was that President Zheng had personally seen Xia ruofei’s terrifying network at the opening ceremony of the Paradise corporation’s comprehensive office building. President Zheng was there.

President Zheng was amazed by the scene. Not only did Hong Kong’s Hengfeng group, the United States ‘shengbang group, and other world – Class consortiums send important people to attend, but they also sent expensive gifts such as Mercedes – Benz. More importantly, there were many local leaders and the young man who was highly suspected to be the young master of the song family in Beijing.

All of this made Xia ruofei’s status in President Zheng’s heart rise by a large margin.

Although yang Jianren also had a strong background, in President Zheng’s mind, it was clear who was stronger and who was weaker.

That was why he would rather reject yang Jianren than discuss with Xia ruofei about changing rooms.

“I don’t care!” Yang Jianren said with a cold face,”today, I’ve taken a fancy to this lotus pond moonlight private room! You’ll have to adjust it, even if you don’t want to!”

A few people behind yang Jianren also warned him.

“President Zheng, could it be that you’re still drunk from yesterday? Young master yang wants a private room, but you’re so reluctant. Do you still want to keep this club open?”

“Elder Zheng! I said that you’re smart for a lifetime, but you’re a fool for a moment! Hurry up and arrange a private room for young master yang, then apologize to him properly! Otherwise, you’ll regret it!”

……

President Zheng smiled apologetically as he apologized, but he had no intention of arranging a lotus pond moonlight private room.

Seeing this, yang Jianren was even more upset. He snorted and said,”Alright! Old Zheng, you’re good! I’ll remember this, and we’ll slowly settle the score later! Hmph! Didn’t you refuse to change rooms? I’d like to see who’s worthy enough to enjoy a private room that I, yang Jianren, have my eyes on!”

After saying that, yang Jianren strode towards the moonlight lotus pond private room.

“Young master yang, you can’t ...” President Zheng’s face changed and he quickly went forward to stop him.

Yang Jianren was in a fit of anger, so how could he listen? He pushed President Zheng to the side, and then a few people behind him stopped President Zheng while laughing.

There were two security guards not far away, but they both knew yang Jianren. Seeing that their boss couldn’t stop the young master, they didn’t dare to come forward.

Yang Jianren soon arrived at the door of the private room. He pushed the door open without knocking and walked in casually.

In the private room.

Xia ruofei was still calmly chatting with he Feng. As the private room was soundproof, he Feng did not know what was happening in the corridor outside. He was focused on getting closer to Xia ruofei.

Of course, Xia ruofei heard it clearly, but he did not care.

He Feng was personally pouring tea into the tea cup in front of Xia ruofei when the door of the private room was suddenly pushed open. Naturally, he was very unhappy and turned his head to glare at him.

When he saw that it was yang Jianren who came in, the dissatisfaction on he Feng’s face suddenly froze. Then, he put on a surprised look, stood up and said,”Young master yang! What a coincidence, you’re here for dinner too?”

Yang Jianren’s mouth slightly curved up, revealing a smile that was not a smile. He looked at he Feng, then turned his head and said to President Zheng, who broke free from his few followers and quickly walked over,””Elder Zheng, so the distinguished guest you were talking about is director he ... Oh no, Deputy Mayor he?”

President Zheng looked at Xia ruofei awkwardly, his eyes filled with helplessness.

Seeing yang Jianren’s unfriendly tone, he Feng’s heart also skipped a beat. He quickly thought for a moment, then frowned and asked,”President Zheng, what’s going on? Young master yang, do you have any misunderstanding about me?”
