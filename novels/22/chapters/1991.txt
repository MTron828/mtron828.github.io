1992 True brothers (2)

However, Xia ruofei understood immediately. The person on the card was an official of the Italy Embassy in China. Zhao was obviously talking about the visa.

“Alright! Big brother Zhao, you’re too awesome!” Xia ruofei said,”I can’t help but give you a like!” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Don’t forget the wine you promised me!” Zhao Yongjun said with a smile.

“Don’t worry!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I wouldn’t dare to forget the wine I gave you! We’ll have a few drinks at my house later, and then I’ll get you two bottles to take away. That’s good enough, right?”

Zhao Yongjun gave him a thumbs up.”Interesting!”

After that, the two of them stopped talking about Xia ruoxin’s flight to Italy. Instead, they chatted about their current situation in the car. Soon, they arrived at the courtyard house in liuhai Lane.

The car entered through the door in the backyard. After the renovation, the backyard had a garage.

Wu Qiang was not the only one in the courtyard house now. His sister – in – Law, Wu Xiujuan, and his partner, Xia Xiaolan, were also living in the backyard, and their work location was mainly here.

Seeing Xia ruofei get out of the car, Wu Xiujuan and Xia Xiaolan quickly went up to greet him.””Hello, President Xia!”

Xia ruofei smiled gently and nodded at them.””Hello! By the way, you’ve been working in Beijing for a while, have you gotten used to it?”

“I’m used to it!”Wu Xiujuan quickly said. Habit! This job is much easier than doing farm work, and President Xia pays us so much salary and lets us live in such a good courtyard. It’s like heaven!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.”It’s not that exaggerated. I see that the courtyard is so clean and the flowers and plants are full of vitality. I can see that your work is outstanding. You’re definitely worthy of the salary I’m giving you!”

Wu Xiujuan smiled and said,””It’s good that you’re satisfied, President Xia! Right, what do you want to eat for lunch? I’ll make you a few good dishes!”

Xia ruofei said,”I’m starting to miss sister-in-law’s cooking!” Do as you see fit! Today, I’m going to drink two cups with brother Zhao, and make a few dishes to go with the wine!”

“Alright!” Wu Xiujuan replied.

Xia ruofei nodded at the two of them, then walked to the master’s courtyard in the middle with Zhao Yongjun.

Along the way, the courtyard was almost spotless. The flowers and trees were well taken care of, and even the fallen leaves were all gathered together. It was obvious that the maintenance was very good. When Wu Qiang received a call from him yesterday that he was coming to Beijing, it was absolutely impossible to do this in one day.

Xia ruofei was very satisfied.

He opened the master bedroom. It was very clean. The bed must have just been laid out. The bedsheets still smelled of sunlight. Wu Xiujuan must have taken them out to dry. After all, Xia ruofei had not stayed here for a long time.

Xia ruofei put his luggage aside and took out a tea box from the ice bar. He and Zhao Yongjun sat in front of the root – carved tea tray, making tea and chatting.

Wu Qiang didn’t come with them, so Zhao Yongjun didn’t have to hide his words.

“Ruofei,” he said,”since it’s not convenient for you to tell me, I won’t ask you why you’re in such a hurry to go to Italy. But I still want to give you a few words of advice.”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”brother Zhao, please tell me.”

“When you’re outside, you must pay attention to your safety! This is the first one!” Zhao Yongjun said seriously,”Italy isn’t like China. If something really happens, we might not be able to help. You have to rely on yourself for a lot of things …”

“I know,” Xia ruofei nodded. Don’t worry! I know what I’m doing. ”

“Mm! I’m sure you’ll be able to handle it no matter what happens. ” Zhao Yongjun said,”if you really have any difficulties, you can call me immediately. I can also find some acquaintances at the Embassy in Italy. They can help you a little.”

“Alright! Brother Zhao, thank you!” Xia ruofei said sincerely.

Of course, he knew that Zhao Yongjun had taken care of him unreservedly, and he would remember this favor.

Zhao Yongjun then took out a piece of paper and handed it to Xia ruofei.””This is the contact information of Zheng Huailai, the military official of the Italy Embassy. He is my father’s former subordinate. If there is any situation that you can’t handle, you can contact him directly and just say my name!”

Zhao Yongjun paused, then continued,””I didn’t know why you went out this time, so I didn’t dare to disclose the news to uncle Zheng. However, as long as you say my name, he will definitely help you with everything he has! Even if you’re not in the Rome area, he can still provide you with as much help as possible through the Embassy and several other embassies!”

Xia ruofei solemnly took the note, folded it, and put it in his pocket. He said,””I know, brother Zhao!”

He didn’t say any more words of thanks, because there was no need for that between them. At the same time, Zhao Yongjun spared no effort to think for him, so a simple thank you wasn’t enough to express his gratitude.

This time, Xia ruofei had deliberately changed his identity. It was obvious that things were a little troublesome and might even go against the local laws. The Embassy was a sensitive place and most people would avoid it at this time. How could they give him the military official’s contact information?

If Xia ruofei were to cause trouble outside, then Zhao Yongjun, Zheng Huailai, and even general Zhao Cheng who had provided him with help would most likely be implicated.

It could be said that Zhao Yongjun was giving Xia ruofei his full support.

Xia ruofei was well aware of this, but there were some things he didn’t need to say.

Zhao Yongjun treated him with sincerity, so he naturally treated him as a brother who had gone through life and death with him. No matter how many words of thanks he said, he might as well put them into action.

This had always been Xia ruofei’s style.

Zhao Yongjun knew that Xia ruofei didn’t want to talk much about the trip to Italy, so he didn’t mention it again after giving his instructions. The two of them turned to talk about the clubhouse project.

After Xia ruofei returned to San Shan, the clubhouse project was progressing smoothly.

The design plan had been drafted several times, and Xia ruofei had also given many suggestions in the mail at San Shan. After the final decision was made, the preliminary construction began very quickly.

Zhao Yongjun and the others had never been in real estate, but this project was different from ordinary real estate projects. They had a wide network of designers, construction workers, supervisors … There were probably no people who would dare to cheat them.

In addition, the bank’s work was also very smooth. The most troublesome financial problem for ordinary people was basically the easiest to solve in their project.

So, after the initial phase of work, Zhao Yongjun started to have some free time. Other than going to the construction site occasionally, he could also take care of his antique business. He also had time to drink health tea and go out with his friends. His life was quite pleasant.

“I didn’t tell Xiao Rui and the others that you’re coming to the capital.” Zhao Yongjun said,”otherwise, I would really like to take you to our project site to take a look. It’s so hot!”

Xia ruofei really couldn’t appear at the project site now. Otherwise, song Rui and the others would know that he was in the capital soon. By then, Xia ruofei would be able to explain why he came here secretly without even telling his brothers.

“It’s fine. I’ll go to the construction site to take a look when I come back from Italy!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”anyway, I’ll be 100% assured if you guys keep an eye on it!”

“You’re just lazy!” Zhao Yongjun said,”I heard that you don’t really care about your own company. We knew it. We can’t count on you for this tiring work!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but burst out laughing.

At this moment, Wu Qiang knocked on the door and said,””President Xia, lunch is ready! Shouldn’t we start eating?”
