“This ...” Song Qiming could not help but feel awkward.

From the bottom of his heart, he definitely hoped that Xia ruofei would come up with the medicine as soon as possible. However, it was almost lunchtime, and Xia ruofei had come all the way here to treat his daughter. He didn’t even ask her to stay for a meal. It was unreasonable.

However, Song Wei was even more carefree. She smiled and said,”Dad, since doctor Xia said so, let him go back! There will be many more opportunities to thank him in the future!”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”That’s right. I’d better get down to business first. The earlier I can relieve Song Wei’s pain, the earlier you guys can be at ease!”

Then, Xia ruofei smiled and said,””By the way, Auntie, Song Wei, please don’t call me Doctor Xia. I’m not a full – time Doctor. You can just call me by my name. It’s more intimate.”

Although elder song had personally helped Xia ruofei to get his medical license, Xia ruofei was not a doctor. He felt weird when Fang Liyun and Song Wei called him “doctor Xia”.

Song Qiming could not help but laugh.”Right, right, right, we’re all on the same side, so it’s too distant to call each other that! In the future, everyone will call you Ruo Fei. Also, ruofei, stop calling me Secretary song. I’m older than your parents, so you can just call me uncle song!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,””Alright, uncle song!”

Although song Qiming was the Deputy Secretary of the southeast Provincial Party Committee and the Secretary of the political committee of Sanshan city, Xia ruofei even addressed elder song’s son, song Zhengping, as ‘uncle song’. Moreover, song Qiming was only elder song’s distant nephew.

Speaking of which, Xia ruofei already had a few “uncles song”. It was not a big deal to have one more song Qiming.

Song Qiming laughed happily.”Alright, alright, alright. Ruofei, I won’t keep you any longer. I’ll leave Weiwei’s matter to you!”

“Don’t worry, uncle song. I will do my best. ” Xia ruofei said. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Song Qiming’s family personally sent Xia ruofei to the entrance of the villa. They only returned to the villa after watching Xia ruofei drive away.

Song Qiming seemed to be in a good mood. He smiled and said,””Little Cao, you and old Zhang should stay for lunch! Your Auntie prepared a lot of good food for RUO Fei, he’s not lucky enough to enjoy it!”

Guangzhi Cao was flattered and quickly said,”Thank you, Secretary!”

Song Wei was a quiet girl. She told her parents, nodded at Guangzhi Cao, and went back to her room.

Song Qiming asked Cao Guangzhi and uncle Zhang to sit down in the living room. Fang Liyun poured a cup of tea for song Qiming. Cao Guangzhi quickly stood up and took the cup from Fang Liyun. He carefully placed it on the coffee table in front of song Qiming.

When he saw Fang Liyun pouring water for him and uncle Zhang, he quickly said,””Auntie, don’t be busy. I’ll do it!”

Guangzhi Cao was a good Secretary. Even though he was in song Qiming’s house, he was still very busy and made sure that he had enough service.

In comparison, the driver, Zhang, who had been with song Qiming for many years, was much more comfortable. He sat upright on the sofa, not as nervous as Guangzhi Cao.

Song Qiming’s brows relaxed a lot. He smiled and started chatting with Guangzhi Cao and Zhang.

Song Qiming had just been appointed to the position, so he only knew Guangzhi on the surface. Song Qiming took the opportunity to ask about Guangzhi Cao’s family and his lover’s child.

Guangzhi Cao was flattered, but he had been dealing with mechanisms for many years, so he responded appropriately.

Guangzhi Cao knew very well that as a Secretary of a leader, it wasn’t nice to flatter too much. The key was to leave an impression that he was neither humble nor overbearing, that he was reliable and trustworthy.

Obviously, Guangzhi Cao’s performance wasn’t bad. Song Qiming was in a good mood today, so he was quite satisfied with Guangzhi Cao. He nodded to himself.

Fang Liyun, on the other hand, was still unsure. She sat on the side and waited for song Qiming and Guangzhi to finish their conversation before she interrupted,”Old song, do you think RUO Fei really has a way to deal with Wei Wei? Many famous doctors have ...”

Song Qiming frowned and said,”Liyun, ruofei is different from other young people. Even the chief admires his medical skills. The chief personally gave me some advice this time. That’s why I invited ruofei over. Since he said that he has a plan for treatment, there must be hope!”

Song Qiming was very certain.

Fang Liyun’s mouth was wide open in shock. She seemed to have lost her composure.

She knew very well that song Qiming would only address one person as ‘chief’, and that was elder song.

Even the highly respected old chief had personally recommended Xia ruofei. Song Qiming had never mentioned this to her before. When she first heard about it, she could not help but be shocked.

Fang Liyun quickly replied,”Since the chief personally recommended him, there shouldn’t be any problems ...”

Fang Liyun and song Qiming’s respect for elder song was even greater than that of his biological children. They believed in his words without a doubt.

Song Qiming nodded slightly and said,””Yes, the Bureau chief and ruofei have told me that ruofei hopes to keep a low profile when it comes to medical skills. Otherwise, there will be an endless stream of people who come to him for treatment. He’ll be annoyed to death. So, you just have to keep this in mind and don’t let anyone know!”
