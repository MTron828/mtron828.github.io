Chapter 1466: Retribution (3)

Translator: 549690339

Guan Ping’s heart skipped a beat and he turned to look at Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei turned around and smiled.””This fellow has admitted defeat?”

Guan Ping nodded his head, covering the phone and saying, “He’s completely cowered ... He’s just wagging his tail and begging for mercy ... Ruofei, what does your uncle Liang do? How could he have such great power?”

“He’s one of the major shareholders of pioneer real estate, right?” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”but his main business is not a real estate agent. He only invested a little money to form an industrial ecosystem ...” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Xia ruofei continued.”Don’t worry about this. You can make the decision. If you want to let him go, I have no objections!”

Guan Ping’s heart was filled with emotions. He knew that Xia ruofei was very capable now and his career was doing well. He did not expect that he had underestimated Xia ruofei’s influence. They were once good friends in high school, but now, a simple phone call could decide the fate of the person who had once been above him ...

Just as Guan Ping was in a daze, store manager Liu on the other end of the phone couldn’t help but shout nervously,””Guan...Guanping ...”

Only then did Guan Ping come back to his senses. He coldly said,”Manager Liu, what’s the point of begging me now? If you knew this would happen, why did you do it then?”

When he thought about how store manager Liu had suppressed and humiliated him, the trace of compassion in Guan Ping’s heart disappeared without a trace.

“Guanping, I didn’t recognize you before, please forgive me just this once!” Store manager Liu begged. Not only does director Cai want to fire me, but he also wants to ban me from the entire industry. I really have no way out!”

When Guan Ping heard the words “director Cai,” his face twitched.

At the same time – he felt a sense of warmth in his heart. It was Bai Jingjing and store manager Liu’s threat to him just now – now – in order to stand up for him – Xia ruofei had blamed everything on them.

Xia ruofei really treated his brothers well!

Then, Guan Ping thought of manager Liu’s child. She was a pretty little girl who had been to the store before. She had a childish voice and was very cute, just like a porcelain doll. All the employees in the store liked her very much.

As for store manager Liu’s words about his mother taking medicine all year round and his wife not having a job, he could not rule out the possibility that she was pretending to be pitiful. However, such a cute little girl was enough to make Guan Ping feel bad for her.

He took a deep breath and coldly said,””Manager Liu, I can talk to my brother about it. After you leave pioneer real estate, you can try to apply for a job at other real estate agencies ...”

Losing store manager Liu’s job was already a lesson for him. He had been a store manager for so many years, and his family must have some savings. It was already very kind of them not to ban him from the entire industry.

Store manager Liu was also very satisfied with the result. He was overjoyed and said,”Guanping, thank you! Thank you for your magnanimity ...”

As for the non – competition agreement, he didn’t even mention it. As long as Xia ruofei didn’t ban him, the non – competition agreement was nothing. The agreement was that the public would not complain and the officials would not pursue the matter. As long as pioneer real estate did not pursue it, there would be no problem.

At that moment, Guanping seemed to have heard Bai Jingjing, who was beside store manager Liu, asking for the phone.

Towards this woman, Guan Ping was filled with disgust from the bottom of his heart, and this disgust had already reached the extreme.

He said coldly,”store manager Liu, please tell Bai Jingjing that I don’t want to talk to her. She brought this on herself!” No one will pity him!”

With that, Guan Ping hung up the phone. He leaned back in his seat and looked up at the roof of the car. He let out a long breath, as if he had vented all the depression he had been feeling all this time ...
