Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei rushed forward with great momentum. Without any fancy moves, he directly punched the turtles back.

In fact, the turtle had already thought of retreating. However, Xia ruofeis speed was faster than it had imagined. It retreated quickly, but Xia ruofei had arrived first. In the blink of an eye, his fist had landed on the hard turtle shell.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei used almost all of his strength in this punch. Thick vital Qi was poured into his fist and he smashed it hard on the back of the turtle shell.

After a muffled bang, Xia ruofeis fist was in pain from the impact. The turtles defense was indeed amazing. Xia ruofei felt as if the bones in his hand were about to crack from the impact.

Of course, under such circumstances, the turtle was not in a good state either.

Although the turtle shell was not broken, the force of Xia ruofeis attack had passed through the turtle shell and was directly transmitted to its body. It felt as if its internal organs had shifted and it almost spat out blood.

Fortunately, it was already in the middle jiedan stage. If it was an ordinary turtle, it would have been turned into a pile of meat paste under such a Thunderbolt attack.

However, there was a huge difference in strength between the two. Even if this punch didnt kill the tortoise, it was only temporary. It couldnt escape Xia ruofeis attack range.

Besides, Xia ruofeis ruthlessness had also come up. He did not use his flying sword anymore and did not care about the waves of pain coming from his fist. After that punch, he did not hesitate and threw another heavy punch.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

Muffled sounds could be heard continuously. Xia ruofei seemed to have gone crazy as he kept punching the turtle shell. His own hands were already covered in blood.

Of course, the tortoise was in an even worse state. Its tough shell was already cracking, and its body was suffering from even greater damage. Its internal organs were all seriously injured, and all of them were displaced.

Xia ruofei was not looking for trouble. After the first punch, the turtle had retracted its head and limbs back into its shell, looking like it was ready to be beaten.
