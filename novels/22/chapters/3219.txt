Chen Nanfeng and the other two had returned in a hurry, mainly because the Clearwater flying boat had been damaged. In fact, the three of them could still hold on.

Furthermore, cultivators had very strong recovery abilities, so they were already at full health.

Since Xia ruofei had suggested to test the black Phoenix flying ship, they naturally had no objections and nodded in agreement.

Chen Nanfeng even called Chen Xuan over. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Xia ruofei immediately released the black Phoenix flying ship from the courtyard and let it float above the central courtyard.

Fortunately, the Flying Ship had an invisibility effect on ordinary people. Otherwise, with such a huge flying ship quietly floating above their heads, the huge sense of oppression brought by the black hull with a trace of modern technology beauty would definitely make people think of keywords such as an alien civilization invasion.

Xia ruofei and the other five people jumped onto the flying boat.

Xia ruofei was not in a hurry to increase the altitude of the flying boat. Instead, he took Chen Nanfeng and the others around the flying boat.

Mu Sheng clicked his tongue and praised,”little brother Xia, your flying boat looks much bigger than brother Chen ‘s!” And this black material looks extremely sturdy!”

Chen Nanfeng couldn’t help but roll his eyes. Could refining materials be measured by ‘hardness’? Gold was also very soft! Was he worse than a hard rock?

Liu Mansha touched the side of the ship and said,”Fellow Daoist Xia, what is your flying boat made of? Why do I feel like ... It looks like obsidian Crystal?”

“Impossible! Obsidian Crystal is such a precious material. ” Mu Sheng shouted,”a fist – sized Obsidian Crystal can be sold for a sky – High price. How many obsidian crystals will be used to build such a large flying ship? Even with the power of the sect, it’s impossible to take it out!”

Chen Nanfeng said,”brother mu, you’ve made a mistake!” I’m sure that this flying ship definitely used Obsidian Crystal, and it’s very likely to be the main material!”

“Really?” Mu Sheng couldn’t believe it and looked at Xia ruofei questioningly.

Xia ruofei nodded helplessly and said,””Master did mention it before. He said that this flying ship is made from precious Obsidian Crystal, so it’s called the Obsidian flying ship!”

Even though they had already guessed the answer, Chen Nanfeng and the other two still gasped in unison. Such a large flying ship made entirely of Obsidian Crystal was quite a visual impact.

Moreover, when they heard Xia ruofei mention “master” again, they had a feeling that they were right.

Obviously, no matter how much of a genius Xia ruofei was, he couldn’t be like the Doraemon, who had one treasure after another. For example, this Black Phoenix flying ship must have been given to Xia ruofei by his mysterious and powerful master.

Of course, Chen Nanfeng and the others didn’t have any other thoughts.

First of all, they were allies now, and they would soon cooperate to explore the moon.

Besides, since Xia ruofei’s master had given the black Phoenix flying ship to him and he had taken it out in front of everyone, it meant that he definitely had a way to keep it.

Otherwise, an ordinary man would be guilty of treasuring a treasure. If an ordinary cultivator owned such a flying ship, it was very likely that he would bring death upon himself.

Of course, this was also because the temptation was not big enough.

After all, flying boats were mainly used as a flying tool, and their scope of application was relatively narrow.

If it was a treasure land like the peach source Island ...

Perhaps even Chen Nanfeng would find it hard to resist such a huge temptation.

Xia ruofei showed everyone around. Chen Nanfeng secretly felt that the black Phoenix flying ship was much better than the Clearwater flying ship. However, he did not know how strong the black Phoenix flying ship’s defense was or whether it could adapt to outer space.

Chen Nanfeng thought to himself,’this flying ship is made of extremely precious Obsidian Crystal, and its defensive power is extremely high. I’m sure this flying ship is not bad!’

Everyone arrived at the control room.

Looking at the control console that was much simpler than the Clearwater flying boat, Chen Nanfeng asked with a smile,””Fellow Daoist Xia, what fuel does your flying boat use?”

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”spiritual stones or spiritual crystals are fine. As long as you can provide it with energy, it can fly.” The higher the purity of the energy, the faster the flying speed. So, I’m going to give it some high – purity fuel today!”

With that, Xia ruofei flipped his hand and took out a crystal that was emitting a strong energy aura from the spirit map space.

“Origin crystals!” Chen Nanfeng and the others couldn’t help but be surprised.

“Hahaha! Little brother Xia, you’re really generous!” Mu Sheng said with a smile.

Origin crystals could directly provide rich vital energy and were the first choice of resources for Aurous core stage cultivators to assist in their cultivation. However, origin crystals were also extremely precious, especially when the resources in the modern cultivation world were increasingly scarce. Even golden core cultivators were reluctant to use origin crystals in their daily cultivation.

Xia ruofei smiled.”Resources are meant to be used. These aren’t gemstones. Do you think they have any value?”

Chen Nanfeng and the others couldn’t help but laugh.

But at the same time, they also had a deeper judgment: No wonder Xia ruofei was able to reach the Golden core stage at such a young age. He must have been given the best resources since he was young. He probably didn’t know what it felt like to be short of cultivation resources! He was definitely a winner in life born with a golden spoon!
