After Xia ruofei finished speaking, he placed his finger on elder Liu’s pulse and closed his eyes to examine him. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Old man Liu had wanted to change the topic to Qing Yun Island, but Xia ruofei did not give him the chance. After Xia ruofei started to take her pulse and check, it was not convenient for old man Liu to speak. He was also worried that he would disturb Xia ruofei and cause an oversight in the examination.

Therefore, old man Liu simply kept his mouth shut and looked at Xia ruofei, hoping to find some clues from his expression.

However, old master Liu was destined to be disappointed. Xia ruofei’s expression was still very calm, and there was no change in her mind.

After a long time, Xia ruofei opened his eyes and said,””Elder Liu, I have good news and bad news, which one do you want to hear first?”

When old man Liu heard this, he couldn’t help but smile bitterly.””Xiao Xia, your words remind me of the story about cow dung.”

“What ... What does this have to do with cow dung?” Xia ruofei asked curiously.

“Do you want to hear it?” Old man Liu asked with a smile.

“I want to hear a little.” Xia ruofei nodded.

“They said that the two of them went to play on the Prairie and lost their way. They were surrounded by vast grasslands and didn’t know how to get out.” Old man Liu continued,”one of them was injured and was resting at the same spot, while the other went to explore the nearby area. After he came back, he said something to his companion. It was like what you said just now. There was good news and bad news. He asked his companion which one he would like to hear first.”

“I’m guessing his companions want to hear the bad news first?” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Yes, I am!” Old man Liu said,”the Pathfinder said,” The bad news was that they were indeed lost. Now, they could only wait for help, because if they ran around randomly, they might go deeper into the grasslands. At that time, no one would respond to them. In addition, their food has been eaten up, and there’s only grass and cow dung in the surroundings. They may have to rely on cow dung to survive. ”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh. “We’ve already come to this point, is there still good news?”

“His companion asked the same question. Can you guess what the person who went to Scout the way said?” Old man Liu asked in high spirits.

“I can’t guess ...” Xia ruofei shook his head decisively.

The main reason was that he felt that the story was ridiculous and that he didn’t need to waste his brain cells. It was better to listen to the answer directly.

“The Pathfinders said,” old man Liu said with a smile. The good news is ... There’s enough cow dung!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh. He said,””Elder Liu, that’s a sad story. However, the news I’m going to tell you doesn’t have that many twists and turns. I won’t keep you in suspense and will just tell you directly!”

At this point, Xia ruofei paused and looked at elder Liu.””Actually, the bad news is that after this period of treatment, your recovery isn’t particularly obvious. The effect of this substitute formula doesn’t seem to be very good.”

Old man Liu nodded silently. He was already mentally prepared for this outcome, so he didn’t feel too depressed. He asked directly,””What’s the good news?”

“The good news is that your body has not continued to deteriorate.” Xia ruofei said,”this at least shows that the prescription I developed is at least right. Before it develops a drug resistance, it can at least maintain your current condition.”

“That’s good enough!” With a bitter smile, elder Liu said,”but ... I can’t even get out of bed now. This kind of life is really torturous ... So ... Let’s go back to what I just said ... I hope you can give me a bigger surprise this time.”

Then, old man Liu stared into Xia ruofei’s eyes, waiting for his answer.

Xia ruofei pondered for a while and said with a bitter smile,””Mr. Liu, I’ve told chief Liu more than once. I’m very confident in the previous prescription. I believe that if we continue to use the prescription, there’s a high chance of curing your illness. It’s just that we don’t have enough medicinal herbs now ... At that time, chief Liu also said that he would do his best to gather the required medicinal herbs. I wonder if there are any results?”

Old man Liu also smiled bitterly and said,””It’s a little embarrassing to say this. We’ve been searching for so long, but we couldn’t even find a single herb, so ... We might have to trouble you to put in more effort ...”

Xia ruofei said helplessly,”I know ... Actually, I’ve been collecting those herbs through my own channels. The effect ... Is still a little bit!”

Hearing that, old man Liu was even more confident. He asked with a happy expression,””How many did you find?”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,””Maybe I’m still one or two away from gathering all of them! There’s already some progress on these two herbs, I’m waiting for the news. ”

Old man Liu thought to himself,”as expected ...”

He put on a happy expression and said,””Little Xia, I’ll still have to rely on you at the crucial moment!”

Then, old man Liu asked hesitantly,””These herbs must be very precious, right? If you want to collect so many at once, won’t the funds ...”

Xia ruofei said indifferently,”I have enough cash. The other medicinal materials are too precious. I don’t have a clear price. I obtained them through bartering.”

“That’s great!” Old master Liu said,”but ... We can’t let you keep putting money in! Even if it’s bartering, you’ll still have to pay a precious treasure of roughly the same value, so ... Why don’t you consider the treatment fee plan I proposed a few days ago? You have to choose one, or else I’ll feel bad!”

Old man Liu heaved a sigh of relief in his heart after saying these words. The topic had finally been brought to this side.

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”I haven’t found all the medicinal herbs yet!” Moreover, even if he found all the medicinal herbs and made the previous pill, it would only increase the possibility of healing, but it was not a hundred percent success rate! Why don’t we wait until the treatment is successful?”

Old man Liu said in his heart,”If you can really treat it and then pay, why would you spend so much effort?

He cursed in his heart, but his face was still full of smiles as he said,””That won’t do! Even the hospital required the patient to pay in advance! Even if the final treatment was not effective, the treatment fee could not be refunded! So there was no such rule! You have to choose a payment plan for the treatment fee now! This way, we can be more at ease ...”

Seeing that old man Liu was so cooperative, Xia ruofei took the opportunity to put on an expression that said,””Then ... Alright! We’ll do as you say!”

Old man Liu was overjoyed and quickly asked,””Xiao Xia, which plan do you want to use?”

At this point, even though old man Liu was a shrewd person, he still couldn’t help but feel nervous.

Xia ruofei looked at old man Liu with a faint smile and asked,””Which plan do you want me to choose?”

Old man Liu laughed and said,””Since I’ve put forward three plans, I’m sure I’ve thought it through carefully and with the greatest sincerity. No matter which plan you choose, it’s the same for me. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have put forward these few plans.”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”then I’ll thank you for your generosity!” To be honest, when I heard these three plans, I was a little dumbfounded too. It was as if a pie had fallen from the sky and hit me ...”

“Don’t say that. In order to treat me, you’ve actually used up a lot of precious herbs. If you convert them into money, it’s already an astronomical figure.” Old man Liu said seriously,”besides, as you can see, many medicinal herbs are priceless treasures that can’t be bought with money! So, we’re the ones taking advantage of you!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”since you’ve said so, I won’t keep you in suspense.” To be honest, I’m not too short of money. I don’t have such a big desire for money and power. However, after seeing green cloud Island this time, I feel that it’s a very good place. The scenery is beautiful, the environment is pleasant, and it gives me a feeling of a paradise. If it’s possible, I hope that you can part with your beloved green cloud Island and give it to me!”
