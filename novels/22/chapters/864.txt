As soon as Xia ruofei finished speaking, Lin Qiao’s expression, which was like a revolutionary who was not afraid of death, began to loosen a little.

“Heron Island University?” Lin Qiao muttered to herself while thinking.

“Yup!” Xia ruofei struck while the iron was hot.”Qiao’ er, it’s really a waste of your marks to apply for Sanshan University. Although Sanshan University is a comprehensive university, its strong subjects are Science and Engineering. Its liberal arts majors are not well – known in the country. On the other hand, Egret Island University is the opposite. Several of its liberal arts majors are ranked in the top ten in the country. If you study in these majors, you won’t be any worse than Fudan or Renmin University!”

Her daughter was taking the college entrance examination this year, so Hu Zi’s mother naturally had a general understanding of the universities in the country. When she heard Xia ruofei’s words, her eyes lit up and she quickly said,””Qiao’ er, your brother ruofei is right. Heron Island University is not bad! This is the only famous university in the province, and the number of students enrolled in this province is relatively large. With your score, you can basically pick any major!”

Xia ruofei looked at Lin Qiao and said with a smile,””Qiao’ er, I know you’re a filial child. You insisted on going to school in the local area so that you could take care of your godmother ...”

Lin Qiao’s face blushed. In fact, what Xia ruofei said was an important factor, but she still had some girly thoughts that she couldn’t say.

Xia ruofei didn’t notice Lin Qiao’s embarrassment. He continued to smile and said,””Actually, you don’t have to worry so much. With me at the three mountains, I’ll definitely take good care of Godma. Moreover, the intercity high – speed rail ran almost every half an hour. It only took slightly more than an hour to come from Egret Island. If you want to go to school at Heron Island, you can come back every weekend as long as you want to go home. I’ll reimburse your ticket!”

“Really?” Lin Qiao smiled slyly and said,”brother ruofei, a gentleman never goes back on his word! You can’t go back on your word, I’ll really come back every weekend!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh. The monthly high – speed rail ticket for a weekly round trip only cost a little more than 1000 Yuan. To Xia ruofei, this amount of money was nothing.

He said,”of course I mean what I say!” When the time comes, I’ll let pang Hao know. If you want to come back, just give him a call and get him to help you book the tickets online! This isn’t a problem!”

Lin Qiao sneaked a glance at her mother and saw that her mother didn’t look happy. She said dejectedly,”Forget it, mom will definitely not agree ...”

Hu ‘er’s mother retorted,”so you know!” I’m not your ATM, and I don’t need to reimburse you for high – speed rail tickets every week! What are you thinking about?”

Xia ruofei quickly gave Hu Zi’s mother a look, meaning that Lin Qiao had finally moved on and was considering Heron Island University. She should not cause more trouble at this time.

However, Hu Zi’s mother was unmoved. To her, it was more important to cultivate her daughter’s character. Although she knew that Xia ruofei was not short of money and she did not treat Xia ruofei as an outsider, she did not want Lin Qiao to develop the bad habit of taking care of everything for her.

To put it bluntly, she felt that Xia ruofei doted on Lin Qiao too much.

Xia ruofei could only smile bitterly and helplessly. He rolled his eyes and said,””That doesn’t matter! Qiao’ er, you can continue your internship in our company’s e – commerce Department. As long as you continue to learn how to design software well, you can complete some of our e – Commerce Department’s work remotely. A month’s round trip ticket only costs a little more than a thousand Yuan. Unless you have no talent in design at all, otherwise, it’s impossible that you can’t even earn a little more than a thousand Yuan!”

Lin Qiao’s eyes lit up and said,”Yeah! Brother ruofei’s idea was better! Hmph, Hmph, I’m self – sufficient. Mom can’t say anything, right?”

After that, Lin Qiao glanced at her mother as if she was showing off.

Hu ‘er’s mother shook her head with a bitter smile and said,””I don’t care how you use the money you earned, as long as you don’t feel the pinch!”

“Why would my heart ache?” Lin Qiao took her mother’s arm and leaned on her.”I’ll buy a high – speed train ticket to go home and see you. It’s worth it no matter how much it costs!”

Hu Zi’s mother was also touched. She gently touched Lin Qiao’s face. Although she didn’t say anything, her eyes were covered with a layer of tears.

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Qiao’ er, you’ve even planned out how to get home. Does that mean you’ve agreed to go to Egret Island University?”

Lin Qiao was stunned. He had been insisting on choosing the three mountains University. How did it turn into a discussion about returning to the three mountains from Heron Island every week after a few words from brother ruofei?

However, on second thought, Xia ruofei’s suggestion seemed pretty good. Besides, there were obviously better schools to choose from. Under normal circumstances, no one would deliberately choose the worse one.

After thinking it through, Lin Qiao gently nodded and said,”Mm! Since it’s brother RUO Fei’s recommendation, then I’ll choose Heron Island University!”

Hu Zi’s mother heaved a long sigh of relief. Before Xia ruofei came back, Lin Qiao had insisted on her opinion no matter what she said. Fortunately, Xia ruofei’s few words made Lin Qiao give up the idea of applying to Sanshan University. Otherwise, she would have been really angry.Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))
