2503 First time meeting (2)

Zhou leiyun’s words were like a calming pill for Wu Lei. He nodded and said,””I understand!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”I’ve signed an agreement with director Zhou. I won’t interfere with the club’s management. So, for you, everything will be the same as before. Nothing will change.” For you personally, you just have to focus on training for the game. The domestic fans are looking forward to seeing you in La Liga as soon as possible!”

“I understand. Thank you, President Xia!” Wu Lei said,”I will definitely work hard!”

“Come on! For the sake of our fate, let’s drink!” Zhou leiyun raised his glass and smiled.

“Cheers!”

The three of them clinked their glasses. As an active soccer player, Wu Lei was very self – disciplined, so he only drank fruit juice while Xia ruofei and Zhou leiyun drank red wine.

“Eat something!” Zhou leiyun said,”President Xia, try the local delicacies!”

Zhou leiyun ordered a lot of Catalan food, such as salted cod, cold – cured meat, roasted snails, and so on. However, Wu Lei could not eat high – calorie food, so he ordered a steak and a chicken breast.

The Barcelonan cuisines were a little different from traditional western cuisines, or rather, it was somewhere in between Chinese and Western cuisines. There was even a dish called “carneldon” that looked a little like Beijing roasted duck. It was made with duck filling wrapped in pasta and some sauce.

Xia ruofei felt that the taste was not bad. For a Southerner like him who did not have strong tastes, the taste was just right.

...

Eating the local delicacies and admiring the old buildings outside the window, it really had a rich exotic atmosphere.

The three of them chatted in low voices as they ate, and the atmosphere was very harmonious.

Xia ruofei clinked his glass with Zhou leiyun’s and took a sip. He put down his glass and turned to Wu Lei.”Wu Lei, how many days have you been in Spain? are you used to it?”

Wu Lei pursed his lips and said with a shy smile,””I’m feeling pretty good. The sun is shining brightly here, and the scenery is pleasant. The club’s facilities were excellent, and they were more professional than the local clubs in all aspects. It’s just that I can’t have in – depth communication with my teammates for the time being. In addition ... I’m not used to not having my wife and children by my side. ”

Xia ruofei had seen some news about Wu Lei and knew that he was a man from the Gu family. Unlike many domestic football stars, Wu Lei rarely had any news outside of the stadium, and he had never had any negative news.

After the popularity of the Chinese Super League, the income of players had also increased greatly, so it was common for players to buy luxury cars. Wu Lei’s car was very ordinary. The only time it was photographed by the media was actually accompanying his wife on the subway, which was jokingly called “a luxury car worth more than 20 million” by the netizens.

In fact, Wu Lei’s income was one of the top among the Chinese Super League players. After all, he was the local player who broke the foreign aid monopoly and won the best striker. He could be said to be the best local striker, but he never squandered. Instead, he supported the training of the young players and was willing to take out tens of thousands of Yuan to buy nutrition for the young players.

In addition, Wu Lei was almost the only player in the Chinese Super League who did not have any tattoos.

It was because of this positive image that Xia ruofei had a good impression of Wu Lei.

After he heard Wu Lei’s words, he smiled and said,””Everything is difficult in the beginning! Since you’ve already taken the first step, the next step is to find a firm foothold. I think it’s one thing to work hard during training, but it’s also very important to master Spanish as soon as possible. Otherwise, it’ll be difficult for you to really integrate into the team. Although President Zhou and I are the major shareholders of the club, we can’t interfere with the manager’s lineup. You have to fight for everything yourself. ”

“I understand!” Wu Lei quickly said,”director Xia, the club has arranged for me to have a Western language teacher. I’m now cramming for this lesson!”

...

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”it’s good that you’ve realized this!” I believe you’ll be able to integrate into the team very soon!”

Wu Lei was 27 years old this year, the same age as Xia ruofei. However, his words did not sound like an old man’s words to anyone who heard them. It felt very natural.

“Thank you for your encouragement, President Xia!” Wu Lei said.

“Oh right, how’s your shoulder injury?” Xia ruofei continued.

“The team doctor has done a preliminary examination. He needs to undergo surgery.” Wu Lei said with some frustration,”although this operation doesn’t need to be done immediately, and this injury won’t affect my participation in the competition too much, it may cause serious consequences if I hurt the same place again in the competition. But I don’t want to miss the games during this time. After all, more than half of the season has passed. Once I get operated on, I’ll miss all the games this season ...”

Zhou leiyun also said,”director Xia, Wu Lei has to make his own decision. The club can only give suggestions.” His injury doesn’t affect the training and competition, but there are some risks. ”

“It seems like I’ll have to weigh the pros and cons myself!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“En!” Zhou leiyun nodded, then looked at Wu Lei and said,”you have to make this decision yourself. I’ve already told you that no matter what decision you make, the club will support you unconditionally! It was also fine if he wanted conservative treatment to ensure training and competition. If you want to have surgery immediately, we’ll contact the best sports Surgery experts for you. ”

“I’ll seriously consider it, director Zhou!” Wu Lei nodded and said.

“If it’s a surgery ... How long will it take for him to recover?” Xia ruofei asked.

“The doctor estimates that it will take two to three months for me to recover from the surgery and be able to participate in team training as usual,” Wu Lei said.”By then, I’ll have finished talking about La Liga for this season. I can only wait for next season!”

...

Xia ruofei nodded thoughtfully, then asked,””Director Zhou, if Wu Lei is to be operated on immediately, how long will it take for the doctor to arrange it?”

Zhou leiyun looked at Xia ruofei in surprise, then said,””Dr. Havimir is a world – renowned expert in upper limb surgery. He has operated on some world – Class star players, and we’re going to ask him to be the chief surgeon for Wu Lei. As for the exact time ... We’ll only know after the club contacts him, but it usually doesn’t take too long. ”

Such an authoritative sports surgeon’s surgery fees were very high, and ordinary patients could not afford it at all. He mainly operated on professional athletes, so his schedule was not as tight as ordinary surgeons.

Xia ruofei nodded. He looked at Wu Lei and asked seriously,””Wu Lei, if there’s a way for you to recover within a week after the surgery, would you be willing to have the surgery immediately?”

“What?” Wu Lei could not help but cry out.

He immediately realized that they were in a restaurant. He covered his mouth subconsciously and lowered his voice.”President Xia, you ... Are you joking with me?” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Why would I joke about this?” Xia ruofei said seriously.

“This is not in line with medical laws ...” Wu Lei hesitated and said.

This was related to his development in the RCD Espanyol club. Wu Lei had to be careful. He did not even care about Xia ruofei’s identity as the boss. He had to question it when it was time to.

He had always considered the recovery period to be two to three months. If he could persist until the end of the season before he had surgery, then he could use his vacation to complete his postoperative recovery. It would not affect his preparation for the new season. And if they could perform well in the remaining games of the season, their situation next season would naturally be much better.

If he were to go for surgery directly, by the time he recovered to the point where he could participate in training, the season would be over again and the team would be on vacation. It would be somewhat disadvantageous for his recovery. This was directly related to whether he could occupy a main force or standing substitute position on the team next season.

...

Xia ruofei’s “one week to recover” sounded like a fantasy to Wu Lei. It would be great if it was true, but he was afraid that Xia ruofei was just bragging. If that happened, it would have a huge impact on him.

At that moment, Zhou leiyun suddenly said,””Wu Lei, since CEO Xia said a week, he must be confident. Don’t you know President Xia very well?”

When Wu Lei heard this, he was stunned for a moment, then his eyes immediately lit up and his face revealed a trace of joy ...
