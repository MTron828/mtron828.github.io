Chapter 943: Chapter 607 – giving him a taste of his own medicine (1)

Translator: 549690339

Tang Yitian’s voice suddenly increased a lot when he said the last word, and it was full of dignity. Brodie couldn’t help but shiver. He said in fear and trepidation,””Dear Mr. Tang, I ... I accidentally offended your friend, Mr. Xia, but I swear, I was just saying it, and I didn’t really mean to do it ...”

“What did you just say?” Tang Yitian asked indifferently.

His tone was very calm, but everyone present could hear the Thunder hidden under the calm.

Brodie felt as if he was being stared at by a hungry lion. In the warm winter, his back was quickly drenched in sweat, and he couldn’t speak for a long time.

Lin Qiao’s loathing for Brodie had also reached the extreme. Seeing this, she said,””Mr. Tang, this man tried to strike up a conversation with me just now, but after I rejected him ...”

Lin Qiao told him about Brody’s ugly face without reservation. Tang Yitian was naturally furious after hearing it.

The son of a small tavern owner dared to have designs on Lin Qiao! Moreover, he even dared to threaten Tang Yitian’s family’s benefactor!

Furthermore, his benefactor was someone who was even more powerful than old Mister Li Jiu Zhou. He was simply a God – like figure. How could a little rich second generation like Brodie threaten such a figure?

“Mr. Xia, what do you want to do with this Brodie?” Tang Yitian didn’t make the decision on his own, but asked Xia ruofei carefully.

Xia ruofei said indifferently,”do as you see fit!” However, this fellow’s crime doesn’t warrant death. It’ll be fine if we just teach him a profound lesson. ”

Xia ruofei didn’t even bother to deal with this kind of small character who didn’t know the immensity of heaven and earth. However, in order to prevent Tang Hu from going overboard, Xia ruofei still reminded him.

“Understood!” Tang Yitian didn’t look at Brodie again. Instead, he turned to Xia ruofei and said,”Mr. Xia, this way please!”

Brodie’s heart was filled with apprehension and fear. He had no idea what kind of fate was waiting for him. However, after Tang Yitian’s gaze swept over him, he felt a chill all over his body. He didn’t dare to say another word and could only watch Xia ruofei and the others walk away.

When Xia ruofei passed by tan Lili, she said with red eyes,””Mr ... Mr. Xia, thank you for today.”

Xia ruofei stopped and said,””You’re welcome. You’re Qiao’ er’s classmate, and we’re all Chinese. It’s only right for us to help each other in a foreign country.”

“I ... I even mocked you and Lin Qiao before ...” Tan Lili said shamefully,”but you helped me regardless of the past. I ...”

Xia ruofei waved his hand.”Let’s forget about the past. What’s your next plan?”

“I’m going back to China in two days ...” Tan Lili said, disheartened.”I’m going back to repeat my studies for a year. I hope I can get into a good university ...”

Tan Lili came to Australia after her college entrance examination results were released. Her score was not even enough to pass the second tier. She hoped that Zheng Peng could help her to study in Australia. However, she did not expect to meet the wrong person. This Zheng Peng was a complete scumbag. Not only was he a Playboy, but he also bragged a lot. When things happened, he became a coward.

Xia ruofei nodded.”It’s good that you’re back. There’s not only a colorful world out there but also a dark side that you can’t see.” I’m sure you’ll have a new understanding of life after this, which will be good for your future. ”

“Thank you ...” Tan Lili said. Then, she gathered her courage and bit her lip.”Mr. Xia, can I ask for your help?”

“What is it?” Xia ruofei asked indifferently.

Tan Lili stared coldly at Zheng Peng, who was hiding in the crowd. She gritted her teeth and said,””I’m begging you to hit Zheng Peng’s winery hard in the business world. It’d be best if they could Taste the Feeling of bankruptcy! I know that this request is a bit excessive, but I really hate him! Mr. Xia, as long as you help me with this, I’ll ... I’ll do anything you want!”

After Zheng Peng heard this, he couldn’t help but say,””Tan Lili, you’re crazy! Have I ever offended you? You want to do this to me ...”

Tan Lili said hysterically,””I’m crazy! You bastard! What were you doing when that Wei nation man was about to rape me? You can’t wait to personally send me to his bed!”

“I ... I have no other choice, right?” Zheng Peng’s face turned red and white.”In that situation, the arm can’t win the thigh. Why do you want to make unnecessary sacrifices?”

Xia ruofei looked at Zheng Peng, then said to tan Lili,””Your request is very reasonable. I agree to it, and I don’t need you to do anything ...”

Zheng Peng heard this and stumbled out of the crowd. However, when he was three to four meters away from Xia ruofei, he was blocked by a few bodyguards in black.

“Mr. Xia, don’t believe this woman’s words!” Zheng Peng said loudly. She’s a bitch! In order to study in Australia, she was very obedient to me. Now that she saw that you’re Mr. Tang’s friend, she immediately turned to seduce you ... This is her usual trick!”

Tan Lili felt a sense of desolation in her heart when she heard the man she once loved so much defaming her in such a public place without any psychological pressure.

She suddenly felt that it was ironic that she used to love Zheng Peng so much.

“Are you saying that I’m blind?” Xia ruofei asked indifferently.

“No, no, no...” Zheng Peng quickly said,”I ... I ... I was worried that you would be bewitched by tan Lili.”

As Xia ruofei’s spiritual power improved, he became more sensitive to his surroundings. Even the subtle expressions of people when they were talking could not escape his eyes.

That was why Xia ruofei could feel that tan Lili’s words were from the bottom of her heart. On the other hand, Zheng Peng’s eyes were flickering. It was obvious that he was feeling guilty.

Xia ruofei’s lips curved up and he pouted.””Even without tan Lili’s request, do you think I’d let you go? Count for yourself, how many times have you offended me since this afternoon? I can’t be bothered to argue with you, but you’ve gone from bad to worse again and again. I’ve given you a chance. ”

After that, Xia ruofei nodded at Tang Yitian. Then, everyone continued to walk forward and left the banquet hall.

It was not until Xia ruofei and the others disappeared through the side door of the banquet hall that the almost frozen air in the hall seemed to relax. Everyone was talking about what had just happened, and many people looked at Brodie and Zheng Peng, who seemed to have lost their parents.

However, everyone was at least three meters away from Brodie and Zheng Peng. It was as if the two had a plague, and everyone was avoiding them.

Brodie and Zheng Peng seemed to be confused by this sudden and sudden turn of events. They stood there at a loss, their faces as pale as paper, and their minds were in a mess, temporarily losing the ability to think.

After a while, Zheng Peng’s phone suddenly rang. He trembled and took out his phone with shaking hands. It was his father. His face changed slightly.

Zheng Peng pressed the answer button, but before he could speak, he heard his father’s roar from the phone,””You unfilial son! What did you do? Why did the Meiya group inform me overnight that they want to take down all of our wine?”

“Dad, I ... I didn’t ...” Zheng Peng’s face was pale. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“No, my ass! They’ve already said that they’ve canceled all of our display slots because you’ve offended the distinguished guests of the Meya group!” Zheng Peng’s father was so angry that he almost vomited blood.

Their family wasn’t as rich as Zheng Peng had boasted. In fact, a few years ago, when the trend of overseas mergers and acquisitions had just begun, Zheng Peng’s father had transferred most of his funds overseas through various means, and then acquired the Wilkinson winery. He had almost bet all of his assets.

Now that their business in Australia had just taken a turn for the better, they were ready to fight for cooperation with the Golden Oak winery. They didn’t expect that Zheng Peng would mess it up. All the retail channels under the Mei ‘ya group had taken off their products, which basically declared their winery bankrupt.

Although there were three major retail giants in Australia, the Maya Group had the absolute advantage in New South Wales. Moreover, Tang Yitian had personally given the order, so even the two retail groups would have to give him face. Hence, Wilkinson winery’s wine supply would face a shortage of supply channels.

Due to the smooth development of the winery some time ago, Zheng Peng’s family had specially mortgaged the winery for a large sum of money. They were prepared to increase their investment and do a big job. Now that they had received such a head – on blow, it was likely that the capital chain would break all of a sudden. In the end, the winery would end up in an auction by the bank.

“Dad, what should we do?” Zheng Peng also panicked.

“You’re asking me what to do? How the hell would I know? Go back to the winery right now, we’ll be flying back tonight!” Zheng Peng’s father was so angry that he swore. Then, he sighed and said,”I’ll go to Mr. Robinson of the Golden Oak winery tomorrow and ask him to give us more benefits in terms of cooperation. I’ll see if he can help us find other sales channels and help us get through this difficult time ...”

Zheng Peng’s face became a little strange, and he stammered,””Dad ... I’m afraid ... The Golden Oak winery ...”

“Also what? Why are you hemming and hawing? If you have a fart, then spit it out!”

“I’m afraid the Golden Oak winery can’t even protect itself!” Zheng Peng smiled bitterly and said,”tonight, Mr. Robinson’s son, Brody, also offended that guest, and he offended him even more than I did ...”

“What!” Zheng Peng’s father couldn’t help but exclaim.

At that moment, Brody’s phone suddenly rang ...
