Chapter 1899 An inkling (3)

Not long after, Fang Chenchen replaced another female anchorwoman and became the anchorwoman of a popular show on the City Channel. In just a few months, she had gone from an unknown foreign reporter to a “Grand turn” to a pillar of the City Channel.

Fang Chenchen could be considered the “number one” of the City Channel now. The budget for the festival team was constantly increasing, and all kinds of publicity were also given full support. There was a team of seven or eight people just for the makeup artists and designers who served her, and her salary and bonus had also doubled.

It could be said that Fang Chenchen’s life had changed dramatically.

On such days, Fang Chenchen’s vanity was greatly satisfied, especially when she saw some streamers who did not even look at her in the past. When they saw her, they had to respectfully call her “sister Chenchen”. She felt an indescribable sense of carefreeness. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Of course, at the same time, Fang Chenchen also felt a little guilty.

Her husband was an engineer in the Environmental Protection Bureau of the Zhong Lou District. He was just a career editor. This honest man doted on her like a treasure. They also had a lovely daughter who was four years old and had just started kindergarten.

Especially Liu haojun, who was very domineering. When he needed it, he would call Fang Chenchen over with a phone call, just like today, and Fang Chenchen had no reason to refuse.

Sometimes, when Fang Chenchen was at home, or even accompanying her child, Liu haojun would give her a call and she would have to make up an excuse to go out.

Fang Chenchen’s husband was an honest man. Furthermore, after Fang Chenchen changed her anchor, her work had indeed become busier, so she had never given it much thought.

However, Fang Chenchen still felt like she was walking on thin ice.

While she was driving, her husband, Liu Dong, called.

Fang Chenchen felt a little guilty, but she quickly pressed the button on her Bluetooth headset and answered the call.””What’s wrong? I’m busy!”

“Chenchen, my mom said that she hasn’t been feeling well for the past two days. I want to go and visit her after work.” Liu Dong said,”can you find some time to pick up Mengmeng?”

Fang Chenchen furrowed her brows and said,”I’m too busy with work here, I can’t leave!” You can go pick up Mengmeng and then go to mom ‘s!”

“I see! “Alright then ...” Liu Dong said.

“Don’t forget to help her finish her work!” Fang Chenchen reminded him,”the teacher informed me in the group today!”

“Don’t worry!” Liu Dong said.

Liu Dong was in charge of all the handicraft work in the kindergarten, so Fang Chenchen basically did not have much free time.

“If there’s nothing else, I’ll hang up first. I’m busy here!” Fang Chenchen thought for a while and added,”Oh right, I might have to work late again tonight. If it’s too late, I’ll just sleep in the office. Don’t wait for me ...”

“I see!” Liu Dong said dejectedly. Okay then ... By the way, do you need me to prepare some supper for you?”

Fang Chenchen quickly said,”don’t worry about this!” Just keep Mengmeng in check! If I’m hungry, I’ll order takeout myself! I’m driving, and I’ll be recording an outdoor shoot later!”

“Oh, oh! Alright, alright! Be careful when you drive!” Liu Dong Hung up the phone in a hurry.

Fang Chenchen sighed softly and threw her phone on the front passenger seat. She drove straight into the West Lake Mansion. Her car was already equipped with an owner card, and the checkpoint at the entrance was automatically recognized.

Fang Chenchen did not notice that in a van not far away, behind the dark – colored window, a long – focus lens was pointing at her license plate and pressing the shutter continuously ...
