“Yup! However, there are some parts that are not quite consistent with what I had in mind. I was just about to ask them to revise the draft and then report it to you!” Feng Jing smiled and said,”every department has a different requirement. It’s quite troublesome to coordinate them.”

“You can distribute the design of the corresponding floor to the specific departments and let them check it themselves!” Xia ruofei said,”if you have to do everything by yourself, how are you going to handle it?”

“I’m not too satisfied with this first draft. I’ll make some amendments first before seeking everyone’s opinions. ” Feng Jing asked,”is there something the chairman wants to talk to me about?”

“Oh, there’s something.” Xia ruofei said casually,”in a few days, our company will be working with Hengfeng group to hold another auction!” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Feng Jing’s eyes lit up. She put down the design in her hand and asked eagerly,””Auction? What’s the auction this time? Is it still a top – grade abalone?”

Ever since she joined the company, Feng Jing realized that Xia ruofei had been producing a lot of good stuff. Most of them were not produced by Taoyuan agricultural products. However, everyone had their own secrets, and Feng Jing did not delve into them.

Xia ruofei shook his head.”It’s not an abalone, but it’s still very valuable. It’s truffle.top quality truffle!”

“This is good stuff!” Feng Rao said happily. This was a top – grade ingredient that was most favored by the upper – Class people! I also heard that the harvest of truffles this year isn’t very good. If we can bring out high – Quality truffles to auction, we’ll definitely be able to get a very high price!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.”I didn’t expect you to pay so much attention to the truffle market!”

Feng Rao smiled in embarrassment and said,””On one hand, it’s because I’m in this industry now, so I’m used to learning more about top – tier food ingredients. On the other hand ... I was lucky enough to taste truffles a few times when I was studying abroad. The taste of truffles is still fresh in my memory! But it’s too expensive ...”

Xia ruofei said,”you like truffles?” That’s easy, I’ll give you a piece later. You can cook it yourself, or take it to a Western restaurant and ask a chef to cook it!”

“No, no, no, no... This is more expensive than gold ...” Feng Rao waved her hand.

“I already have the means to get truffles for auction. What’s the big deal about letting you try one or two?” Xia ruofei said nonchalantly,”it’s decided then!”

Then, Xia ruofei did not wait for Feng Rao to reject and continued,””Chief Feng, I called you here today to let you know. The second reason is that I hope that you will still be in charge of communicating with Hengfeng group for this auction. After all, you’ve dealt with them before and are more familiar with them.”

“No problem!” Feng Rao agreed without hesitation.

“The location of the auction, where do you think would be the most suitable?” Xia ruofei asked again,”I think there are three choices. One is in a first – tier city in the mainland; One is to put it in Hong Kong, or we can find a place France or Italy where truffles are produced. ”

Feng Rao thought for a while and said,”If you’re asking for my opinion, I think Hong Kong is the most suitable place! First, our abalone auction in Hong Kong was very successful, and we have a certain reputation. Second, Hong Kong was already known as the capital of Eastern cuisine, and the people of Hong Kong knew a lot about food. Third, Hengfeng’s connections are very strong. Even if we hold a press conference in Hong Kong, we can still invite western Upper – Class people to attend. Of course, the condition is that our truffles must be of very high quality!”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and nodded.”Alright, I’ll discuss it with old Mr. MA again. By the way, boss Feng, there’s something I have to tell you first ...”
