Chapter 1424: Big news (2)

Translator: 549690339

After Xia ruofei’s explanation, the employees gradually relaxed.

After all, paradise corporation’s treatment had always been higher than some of the companies outside, and the benefits had always been good. During the new year and festivals, the company would give out various benefits. Most importantly, the company’s development momentum had been quite good since this year. Under such circumstances, the company was unlikely to take measures to reduce the salary.

Of course, after the personnel grading system was adopted, various assessment standards would be clearly set. It was basically impossible for those who wanted to muddle along in the company in the future. However, this basically had no impact on the employees who really wanted to do something in the Paradise company.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”alright, I’ve finished talking about the two important things. Now, let’s talk about something happy!” In the past year, under the joint efforts of all the employees, the company’s development had been booming, and the results were quite outstanding. All these achievements were inseparable from everyone present and the colleagues who stayed at home, especially the company’s leaders and some of the core employees, who had put in hard work! So, I’ve decided ...”

At this point, Xia ruofei paused and kept her in suspense before continuing,””To the company’s leadership, branch company heads, and department directors, there will be bonus rewards! “In addition, ordinary employees who perform particularly well will also receive additional bonuses. This year, the planned reward range is about 50 people!”

As soon as Xia ruofei finished speaking, the audience burst into enthusiastic cheers.

Only Xia ruofei and Feng Jing knew about this. Xiao Qiang, pang Hao, and the others were not aware of it. This was a huge surprise.

No one could live on their dreams alone. Even the most career – minded people had to support their families. Moreover, to be able to get a bonus was also a reflection of their personal value.

The newly appointed Chief Financial Officer, pang Hao, knew the company’s financial situation the best. This year’s profits were so high that even a small amount of dividends would be a huge income for them!

In addition to the middle and senior leaders who were within the scope of the dividends, the ordinary employees were also full of anticipation because 50 of them would also receive a bonus reward. In a company with about 300 people, this ratio was quite high.

Especially the business backbones of those departments, they felt that they had great hope, and their hearts were full of anticipation.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”the company’s profit this year is about 300 million Chinese dollars. I plan to take out 5% of the profit, which is 15 million Yuan as a bonus!” Of the 15 million, 3 million would be used to reward ordinary employees, and 12 million would be used for dividends for the company’s management. The only difference is that ordinary employees will receive an additional reward in addition to the year – end bonus, while the company’s Leadership Bonus will be directly distributed in the form of dividends!”

After Xia ruofei announced the specific amount of dividends, the crowd became even more enthusiastic. It was as if they were going out of control and everyone couldn’t help but start discussing.

Everyone naturally felt that this distribution ratio was very reasonable. In any company, the most precious wealth was the management with outstanding abilities. It was also a common phenomenon for them to receive high dividends.

In comparison, ordinary employees could still get a reward of 3 million Yuan, which was 60000 Yuan per person. Moreover, the employees who received this reward could also receive a year – end bonus. These two things added up to more than a year’s salary. What was there to be dissatisfied about?

As for pang Hao and the others, who knew that they would no longer receive their year – end bonus after receiving their dividends, they did not care.

At their level, it was basically impossible for their year – end bonus to exceed one million Yuan. However, according to the current bonus plan, they could get at least 1.8 million Yuan, which was equivalent to double or even triple the year – end bonus. Where else could they find such a good thing?

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”as the company has not implemented a hierarchical system this year, the selection of the 50 employees will also be evaluated by the Human Resources Department according to the assessment criteria. The top 50 employees will naturally receive a bonus reward. The evaluation results will also be announced on the company’s internal website. Everyone is welcome to supervise!”

Thunderous applause rang out from the audience. Regardless of whether they had any hope of winning the award, the employees were all very excited.

Xia ruofei continued,”the profit sharing system will continue for a long time!” And I promise that this dividend ratio will only increase and not decrease! This year’s profit was 300 million, so the dividends were 15 million! If the profit next year reached 3 billion, then he would get 150 million in dividends! I’ll say the same thing again, the company will naturally give you the same amount of return as the amount of contribution you’ve made to the company!”

“Alright!”

“Long live the chairman!”

“Long live the Paradise Corporation!”

The staff below the stage were so excited that they started to shout “long live!”. Xia ruofei felt a chill down his spine.

He gestured with his hands and said,””From next year onwards, the bonus system will become more regular and will be linked to the employee’s level. Whether you are a technical or management employee, as long as you reach a certain level, you will be able to participate in the bonus. The bonus ratio will be different depending on the level!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,””Therefore, the personnel grading system is very important. Everyone should study this system carefully after you go down. This is because every promotion assessment is related to your own personal interests, especially the big cake of year – end profit dividends. Only the elite employees are qualified to share it!”

Xia ruofei’s words had incited the employees ‘fighting spirit. Some of them were still worried about the grading system, but now they threw this worry to the back of their minds. They could not wait to see the specific policy.

Xia ruofei said seriously,”finally, I want to tell everyone that the personnel grading system can be used to promote or promote. It doesn’t mean that you can rest easy just because you have reached the level where you are eligible to receive dividends. To put it simply, the assessment will be carried out in a quarterly cycle. Those who have passed three consecutive assessments with excellence will be qualified to apply for a promotion assessment. Similarly, if you have passed three consecutive assessments of the same level and only passed the assessment as competent or failed one of the assessments, you will be demoted!”

Xia ruofei’s words cooled down the employees ‘fiery mood. Everyone began to review whether they could adapt to the requirements of their positions and began to feel a sense of crisis in their hearts.

This was the effect that Xia ruofei wanted to achieve.

The annual meeting officially ended after Xia ruofei announced the three things.

For the employees of paradise Corporation, this was destined to be an unforgettable day.

When everyone started to get up and leave the stage, Liu Qian took the microphone and said,”Dear colleagues, those who didn’t win the prize just now, don’t forget to claim the general prize that the company has prepared for you at the exit!”

The staff’s lottery tickets that won the lottery would be taken back, so those who still held the lottery tickets were naturally those who had not won any general before.

Since it was an Annual Meeting, they naturally had to be fair. They couldn’t let the employees return empty – handed, so the general award was also very necessary.

“General assistant Liu, what’s the company’s general award this year?” one of the employees asked loudly.

Liu Qian smiled and said,” 1000 Yuan, jingbei shopping mall’s E – Card!” Everyone gets a share! The colleagues who didn’t come today can collect it from the administration department tomorrow! Please pass on the message to each other when you return!”

“Awesome! Even a general award is this big!”

“The company must have spent a few million Yuan on this Annual Meeting!”

“What a great deal!”

“This consolation prize is more valuable than many company awards ...”

The employees discussed excitedly as they walked out. They had been a little depressed because they didn’t win the prize, but now their depressed mood was swept away. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Xia ruofei walked out with Feng Jing. He heard Xiao Qiang and Cao tieshu discussing this year’s dividends. His heart skipped a beat. He said to Feng Jing,”Director Feng, have you seen pang Hao?”

“It seems to have gone out in front of us!” Feng Jing asked,”why are you looking for him?”

“Okay, give him a call and ask him to wait for us at the door!” Xia ruofei said,”there’s something I need to know!”
