Chapter 8: A Fool

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Lu Wen was also dumbfounded. After a while, he said with uncertainty.

“This… this can’t be dyed, right?”

This Ice Lantern Jade Dew was truly too beautiful. It was so beautiful that it seemed like a fake. It was like a work of art.

Liang Qichao, Lu Ping, and Ling Qingxue raised their heads in unison and said.

“Nonsense!”

Ling Qingxue snorted.

“Don’t talk nonsense if you don’t know anything. This is obviously an extremely rare mutated supreme-grade ice lantern!”

Lu Ping shook his head and said.

“Lu Wen, from my experience, there’s nothing wrong with this Ice Lantern Jade Dew. It’s even prettier than the pictures on the Internet.”

Because of Ling Qingxue, these people had done some research on succulent plants. Liang Qichao even opened a succulent plant cultivation base.

In fact, Lu Wen had a vague feeling that the Ice Lantern Jade Dew wasn’t fake. However, he couldn’t help but say those words out of indignation. He hadn’t expected to incur public wrath.

Xia Ruofei did not take it to heart. There was still a faint smile on his face.

At that moment, Liu Minghao looked at Xia Ruofei, then at Ling Qingxue. His eyes darted around as he said.

“Little Xia, you’re selling this ice lantern, right? How about this? I’ll offer 80,000 yuan! Sell it to me! A pot of succulent plant for 80,000 yuan, you’ve earned a lot. You’ve been a soldier for so many years, but your retirement fee is probably not even that much!”

Liang Qichao immediately jumped up and said.

“Liu Minghao, what do you mean?! I was the one who contacted Mr Xia. If he is going to make a deal, he will have to do it with me!”

Lu Ping also said.

“Liu Minghao, you’re a little unreasonable! How dare you give a price of 80,000 yuan? This is just the price of an ordinary supreme-grade Ice Lantern. The one that Mr Xia has is a mutated variant! How about this, I’ll offer 100,000 yuan. Mr Xia, are you willing to part with it?”

Lu Ping seemed soft-spoken, but how could these rich second-generation heirs be simple? His words also mocked Liu Minghao, and he pretended not to hear Liang Qichao’s words, still preparing to fight for the Ice Lantern.

“You…” Liu Minghao was furious.” I’ll pay 120,000! ”

“130,000! Sell it to me!” Lu Wen also joined in the fun.

These people wanted to buy this pot of Ice Lantern Jade Dew for Ling Qingxue to win her favor, so they naturally wouldn’t back down.

And this supreme-grade Ice Lantern in fact was worth this price.

“You guys are too shameless!” Liang Qichao shouted. Then, he looked at Xia Ruofei pitifully and said, “Mr. Xia, Master Bloodwolf… you promised to sell it to me…”

Before Xia Ruofei could speak, Ling Qingxue spoke first.

“One million! I want this Ice Lantern. Who wants to fight with me?”

Liang Qichao and the rest were dumbfounded while Xia Ruofei did not know whether to laugh or cry.

Before he came, he had roughly checked the price. Although a supreme-grade mutated Ice Lantern was valuable, it was definitely not worth as much as a million. It was not even a fifth of a million.

Ling Qingxue’s bid was clearly not only because she liked the Ice Lantern.

In reality, when Ling Qingxue saw that Xia Ruofei’s outfit added up to less than 200 yuan and that he had just retired from the army and had no job, it could be said that he was in dire straits. Hence, she thought of helping Xia Ruofei.

However, smart as she was, she knew that she had to take into account a man’s pride and was considering how to get the best of both worlds! Then, Xia Ruofei took out this pot of jade dew and prepared to sell it.

Thus, Ling Qingxue did not even think about it and gave an exaggerated price.

Liu Minghao quickly said.

“Qingxue, no matter how good this Ice Lantern Jade Dew is, it’s not worth a million. I know you like this pot of Jade Dew. I’ll buy it for you later…”

Lu Ping adjusted his gold-rimmed glasses and said.

“Qingxue! This price is too high…”

Ling Qingxue snorted.

“I like it and I’m willing. It’s hard to buy my favorite thing with money. What can you do about it?”

“This…” Liang Qichao did not expect things to turn out this way. He could not help but look at Xia Ruofei pleadingly.

Xia Ruofei’s gaze was like a torch, and he had already seen the situation clearly. Furthermore, he more or less understood Ling Qingxue’s thoughts. However, Xia Ruofei could only appreciate her good intentions.

He had no impression of Ling Qingxue at all. How could he accept such a large sum of money? To put it nicely, it was called cheating her feelings. To put it bluntly, it was the act of a gigolo who was living off a woman!

Xia Ruofei thought about it and said.

“Director Liang, since everyone is so enthusiastic, let’s bid! The highest bidder wins, fair and just! However…”

At this point, Xia Ruofei looked at Ling Qingxue and smiled.

“My classmate Ling Qingxue shall not participate in the bidding!”

At first, Liang Qichao thought that Xia Ruofei’s words were as good as not saying anything. Ling Qingxue had already offered one million. How was he going to bid? Besides, who would dare to bid against Ling Qingxue? Fortunately, Xia Ruofei add the sentence afterwards, and Liang Qichao’s worries turned into joy.

However, Ling Qingxue could not take it. She pouted and said to Xia Ruofei.

“Why can’t I bid? It’s not fair!”

Liang Qichao and the others couldn’t help but stare blankly. They had known Ling Qingxue for so long, but this was the first time they had seen her reveal such a feminine side. They couldn’t help but feel envious and jealous.

Liu Minghao and Lu Wen were especially furious.

Xia Ruofei looked at Ling Qingxue helplessly and said.

“Stop fooling around. I’m doing something serious! If you like succulent plants, I’ll find you another one…”

Ling Qingxue immediately became happy.

“Then you have to keep your word!”

“Definitely, definitely…” Xia Ruofei said half-heartedly.

Liu Minghao couldn’t stand it anymore and quickly said.

“Since that’s the case, let’s start bidding! Little Lu will bid 130,000, right? I’ll bid 150,000!”

Liu Minghao added another 20,000 yuan.

In fact, this price was already considered very high. The rare Ice Lanterns on the market were only worth about 100,000.

“160,000!” Lu Ping gritted his teeth and added 10,000 yuan.

“170,000!” Liang Qichao was not to be outdone. He was the owner of this place, and he had not made a bid just now!

Lu Ping shrugged and said.

“I quit!”

He had always been a calm person. Now that the price had exceeded the actual value of this ice lantern, he decisively chose to stop.

The money of these rich second-generation heirs didn’t come from nowhere. Their fathers were indeed billionaires. However, they didn’t have any businesses on their own. Basically, they were living on their monthly allowance. If they took out a few 100,000 or 200,000 yuan at once, they would have a hard time surviving the month.

Lu Wen thought about it and shook his head.

Liu Minghao sneered and said.

“180,000!”

He wasn’t on good terms with Liang Qichao, and the two families were competing with each other for enterprises, so he had the intention to fight.

Liang Qichao snorted and said.

“Then I’ll pay 200,000!”

Liu Minghao’s expression changed slightly as he said angrily.

“Liang Qichao, are you crazy?! This ice lantern isn’t worth that much money at all! Are you just bent on competing with me?”

“Am I crazy to bid higher than you?” Liang Qichao said disdainfully, “Qingxue even offered a million just now!”

Liu Minghao was shocked and quickly looked at Ling Qingxue. As expected, Ling Qingxue’s expression had turned a little ugly.

He hurriedly explained.

“Qingxue, I… That’s not what I meant…”

Ling Qingxue said coldly.

“If you want to buy it, then continue bidding. If you can’t afford it, then give up. Why are you talking so much nonsense?”

This was intolerable!

What was the most important thing in front of the woman he liked? Of course, it was the dignity of a man. Tens of thousands was nothing!

Liu Minghao shouted with bloodshot eyes, as if he had been injected with chicken blood.

“250,000! I bid 250,000! Liang Qichao, do you still dare to raise the bid?”

Xia Ruofei knew that Ling Qingxue was purposely trying to arouse Liu Minghao’s competitive spirit so that he could sell his Ice Lantern Jade Dew for more money. He did not expect Liu Minghao to be so cooperative and foolishly increased the price by 50,000 yuan.

Xia Ruofei looked at Ling Qingxue reproachfully. Ling Qingxue blinked at Xia Ruofei as if they were telepathic, revealing a mischievous look.

Liang Qichao was also beginning to feel troubled. This price was at least twice the actual value. It would be unwise to raise the price further, but the issue of face was also very important!

At that moment, Liang Qichao saw Xia Ruofei secretly giving him a look, so he quickly came back to his senses.

He laughed and said.

“Liu Minghao, a gentleman doesn’t take what others like. Since you like this pot of Ice Lantern Jade Dew so much that you’re willing to pay twice the price, I’ll fulfill your wish!”

With that, Liang Qichao shrugged his shoulders, indicating that he had given up the competition.

Liu Minghao also calmed down, and he couldn’t help but feel a trace of regret—this amount of money could buy a lot of precious succulent plants.

Then, Ling Qingxue said.

“Since no one is bidding anymore, Liu Minghao, pay up!”

“Ah? I… I didn’t bring so much cash!” Liu Minghao said hesitantly.

“I have a payment machine here!” Liang Qichao laughed.” If you swipe your card here, I’ll get the finance department to transfer the money to Mr Xia’s account!”

Liu Minghao knew that it was impossible to go back on the payment, so he could only take out his card resentfully and watch Liang Qichao transfer 250,000 yuan.

Liang Qichao asked for the card number from Xia Ruofei and walked out of the office to look for the financial personnel at the store. After a while, the finance personnel transferred 250,000 yuan into Xia Ruofei’s account. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Thank you, Director Liang,” Xia Ruofei said.

“Haha! You’re welcome!” Liang Qichao laughed heartily. “It’s a pity that I didn’t buy this supreme-grade ice lantern this time. I hope we can still work together in the future!”

“Of course,” Xia Ruofei said with a smile.

Among these rich second-generation heirs, other than Lu Wen and Liu Minghao who kept making things difficult for him, Liang Qichao and Lu Ping were still not bad. Ling Qingxue, on the other hand, looked at him with stars in her eyes.

Liu Minghao looked at Xia Ruofei and Liang Qichao, who were chatting happily, and felt as if he had eaten a fly.

His eyes fell on the bowl of Ice Lantern Jade Dew that he spent 250,000 to buy. His eyes suddenly lit up and he quickly brought it to Ling Qingxue.

“Qingxue, this supreme-grade ice lantern is for you. I hope you like it.”

Ling Qingxue coldly glanced at the Jade Dew and said.

“If I want it, won’t I buy it myself? I appreciate your kindness, but keep it for yourself!”

Initially, although Ling Qingxue had a cold personality, at least she spoke appropriately. However, when she saw Liu Minghao targeting Xia Ruofei, she did not hold back.

Liu Minghao was stunned. He spent half a month’s pocket money to buy this thing to win the hearts of this beauty! How could it be like this? Didn’t he become a fool then?

Xia Ruofei laughed and said.

“Director Liang, since the transaction is completed, I won’t disturb you any further. I’ll take my leave first!”

“I’ll send you off!” Liang Qichao said hurriedly.

“No need. You should accompany your friends! I can go out myself,” Xia Ruofei said.

Then, he gave Liang Qichao a look and said.

“I’ll contact you later.”

Liang Qichao immediately understood and nodded.

Hence, Xia Ruofei walked towards the door.

Ling Qingxue suddenly spoke.

“Ruofei, I have to go back too. Let me send you back!”

With that, Ling Qingxue strode towards Xia Ruofei, leaving Liang Qichao and the rest looking at each other. Liu Minghao’s expression was the ugliest.
