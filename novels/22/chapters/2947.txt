2948 Xia ruofei’s assets (1)

“Naturally, you can!” Luo Qingfeng smiled and said,”the system of this auction is very loose. The participants of the auction are all cultivators with good cultivation, so they naturally have the ability to identify treasures. Therefore, there is no need to send the auction items for appraisal many days in advance. The auction itself is for cultivators to exchange what they need. If a fellow Daoist brings out an item for auction at the last minute, everyone will welcome it!”

“Master,” Luo Qingfeng said,”do you have any treasures you want to auction?”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”I have to gather some capital first!” I don’t have a single one of the spirit stones you mentioned last time. If you want to fight for the storage ring, you have to earn some spirit stones first!”

Just now, Xia ruofei had casually flipped through the booklet and had already seen that there were indeed two storage rings being auctioned this time.

What was rare was that these two storage rings were a pair. The design was exquisite and cute, especially suitable for girls to wear.

If they were to get it, Song Wei and Ling Qingxue would each get one. They would be equal, and it would be perfect.

This pair of storage rings should be a relatively expensive item, so it was printed on the first few pages. It was very eye – catching and Xia ruofei could see it with a casual flip.

According to Qingfeng Luo, storage rings were rare treasures in the world of cultivation. The price would not be cheap, and the competition would be intense.

Hence, Xia ruofei had to prepare sufficient “ammunition” in advance. Otherwise, he might not be able to win.

Luo Qingfeng had already expected that Xia ruofei was going to auction an item. He smiled and said,””Master, may I know what treasure you wish to auction? I can contact the falling leaves sect’s head Shao in advance and have him put master’s treasure up for auction before the storage ring. ”

“I haven’t decided yet ... I’ll think about it when I get back to my room!” Xia ruofei replied.

Xia ruofei had a lot of treasures and he was confident that he could get a high price. However, he could not think of what treasures to auction off at the moment. There were some treasures that Xia ruofei did not think were particularly valuable, but he could not bear to take them out. For example, spiritual crystals and elemental crystals were non – renewable resources. If he took out an especially valuable treasure, it would easily attract others ‘attention and would bring trouble.

For example, in the spirit herb garden on the realm Heart Island in the spirit map space, there were many very precious spirit herbs and spirit herbs. In the current cultivation world, they would definitely be priceless treasures and would definitely be sought after by many cultivators. However, if such a treasure was taken out, people would definitely have other thoughts. There was no such thing as an impervious wall in the world. Once someone found out the origin of the auction item, it could bring trouble to himself.

Of course, crystals could also be used as currency. However, according to what Qingfeng Luo had said last time, one spiritual crystal was equivalent to 1000 spiritual stones. However, because spiritual crystals were very rare, if someone really took out spiritual crystals to exchange for it, it would be very easy to get 1200 spiritual stones.

It was a loss to use spiritual crystals as currency.

Besides, if it was not necessary, Xia ruofei did not want to waste such a non – renewable resource. After all, he did not know if he would have the chance to obtain more spiritual crystals next time. On the other hand, Song Wei, Ling Qingxue, Li Yifu, Tang Haoran, and even song Qiming, who had just entered the cultivation world, needed cultivation resources. It was best not to use them if possible.

Hence, Xia ruofei had to think carefully about what treasure to auction off.

“Yes!” Qingfeng Luo nodded. The owner can take his time to think about it. You can add them at any time before the auction starts tomorrow night. Even if the auction has already started, according to the usual practice, you can still take out treasures for everyone to bid for at any time. ”

Xia ruofei nodded with a smile and said,””Mm! You can continue!”

“Yes! Master!” Qingfeng Luo said,”according to previous years ‘practice, in order to prevent people from maliciously raising the price and canceling the deal, everyone needs to pay a deposit of 500 spirit stones to attend the auction. If there is any violation, the deposit will not be returned but will be directly given to the client of the auction item as compensation. This old servant has already prepared the deposit, you don’t need to worry. ”

Five hundred spirit stones might not be a small amount for an ordinary individual cultivator, but it was not a big deal for the sects that could participate in the auction.

Of course,”independent cultivators” like Xia ruofei were exceptions. 500 spiritual stones were not even half a spiritual crystal. In his eyes, it was nothing.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”you can handle these things.”

“Yes, master!” “Yes!” Qingfeng Luo said respectfully.

Then, he explained the rules of the auction to Xia ruofei. The Kasaya and other items were all in the fallen leaves sect’s manual, so he only gave a brief explanation.

After Xia ruofei heard this, he had an idea of what to do. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

He stood up and said,”alright!” Then I’ll go back to my room to rest. Qingfeng, I’ll stay in the room opposite yours. If anything happens, please take care of me!”

Most of the people staying in this hotel were cultivators. Li Yifu’s cultivation was too weak. If anything happened, Xia ruofei would be too far away to help if he stayed at the end of the corridor. Luo Qingfeng, who was staying opposite Li Yifu, was very important.
