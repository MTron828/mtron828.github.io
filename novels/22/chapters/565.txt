Chapter 566: Chapter 433 – sending money to the door (3)

It turned out that this middle – aged fat man was boss Qian’s former good friend, the deadbeat Liu Jinsheng who later scammed boss Qian of tens of millions.

After boss Qian finished speaking, he quickly walked up and grabbed Liu Jinsheng’s collar. His eyes were spitting fire as he shouted,”You bastard! Give me back my money!”

Liu Jinsheng quickly pried boss Qian’s hand away and said,””Old Qian, calm down, calm down ... I’m here to pay you back your money!”

“I knew you didn’t have a good heart, you bastard, you F * cking ...” Boss Qian cursed. He only came back to his senses halfway through his sentence and asked in a daze,”what did you say? Return the money?”

He subconsciously let go and picked his ears.

Boss Qian really suspected that he was hallucinating. These few years, in order to collect debts, he had been to xiangnan province a lot. The court also ruled that he won the lawsuit, but he couldn’t do anything to Liu Jinsheng, this troublemaker.

According to the law, Liu Jinsheng had no assets under his name. Even if it was enforced by force, he would not be able to get back a single cent.

The reality was so ironic. It was clear that Liu Jinsheng spent every day drinking and living an extravagant life, but he spent “other people’s money”, lived in “other people’s Villa”, and drove “other people’s car”. Even the court could not do anything to him.

After a long time, boss Qian gave up. That money could only be considered as a lesson for his inattentiveness in making friends!

However, this lesson was too profound. Boss Qian had worked hard for so many years and had only just recovered. In terms of assets, he was still incomparable to the past.

Although every time he saw Liu Jinsheng, boss Qian would chase after him to collect his debt, but today, Liu Jinsheng really suddenly ran to boss Qian and said that he wanted to pay back the money. Boss Qian actually suspected that there was something wrong with his ears.

Liu Jinsheng smiled and said,”old Qian, I ... I’m just here to return the money ... Sigh!” I owe you such a huge sum of money, and I’m feeling very uneasy! I’ve been working hard to raise money all these years, and I’m here to pay off the debt as soon as I have enough ...”

After boss Qian confirmed that he did not hear wrongly, a trace of vigilance appeared in his heart. He looked at Liu Jinsheng coldly and asked,””You’re not playing any tricks again, are you? Liu Jinsheng, I’ve been screwed over by you all these years! Did you see that I’ve finally managed to get up and have some savings, so you’re here to play some tricks with me?”

“Old Qian, what are you thinking ...” Liu Jinsheng said with a bitter smile,”I’m really here to pay back the money. I definitely don’t dare to have any other thoughts!”

“Do you think I’m a three – year – old kid?” Boss Qian sneered and said,”have you forgotten what you said when I went to xiangnan to collect my debt two years ago? Even if the sun rose from the West, you, Liu Jinsheng, would not return a single cent to me! It’s been less than two years, don’t tell me you’ve forgotten what you said?”

Once bitten by a snake, twice shy.

Boss Qian absolutely did not dare to believe that such a big liar would suddenly make a 180 – degree turn.

If you can pay me back, even a sow would climb a tree!

Boss Qian looked at Liu Jinsheng, who was sweating profusely and had a look of fear on his face. He was even more certain of his judgment that Qianqian was not hiding anything. What was he so nervous about?

Seeing this, Liu Jinsheng sighed and said in a pleading tone,””Old Qian, don’t mock me. I know what I did in the past was wrong, I’m not human! “But you’re a great man, so don’t hold it against me. I’ve prepared the money and I’ve come to apologize in person. Can you please tell Mr. Xia to let me go and let me live ...”
