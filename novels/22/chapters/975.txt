“What do you mean?” Ling Qingxue didn’t understand.

“What do you mean?” Xia ruofei said,”let’s eat together later!”

“Let’s eat together? We?” Ling Qingxue cried out in surprise, then hesitated.”This isn’t appropriate, right? That’s the Deputy Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee ... If you treat him to a meal, we’ll ...”

“He’s the one who invited me to dinner!” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but ask,”Didn’t I tell you before?”

Ling Qingxue didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.”Alright, alright! You’re the best if he’s treating you to a meal, alright? Ruofei, stop fooling around. You can’t be so flippant when Secretary song comes later!”

“Who’s messing with you! Secretary song is really treating me to a meal!” Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.”And you and uncle Ling are going too!”

“You’re not joking?” Ling Qingxue finally got serious.

“Hey, hey, hey, Qingxue, what’s the meaning of this?” Xia ruofei laughed.”So you never believed me! You’re really good! Didn’t I ask Secretary song to arrange dinner here so that I could introduce you to him? Otherwise, why would I go through so much trouble?”

“This ... Is it really okay? Did you tell Secretary song?” Ling Qingxue was a little uncertain.

“It’s fine. We can just wait for him to come. ” Xia ruofei said casually,”Qingxue, can you have more confidence in me? Quickly go and call uncle Ling over!”

Ling Qingxue took a few glances at Xia ruofei, then nodded and said,”Alright, I’ll give my dad a call ...”

Ling Xiaotian had been drinking tea in the room in front of them. After receiving Ling Qingxue’s call and hearing that Xia ruofei wanted him to attend the dinner with Secretary song, he immediately rushed over.

Xia ruofei repeated what he had said to Ling Qingxue. He also vaguely revealed that he was close to song Qiming and that it was not difficult for him to introduce him to song Qiming. Only then did Ling Xiaotian and Ling Qingxue relax, but they could not help but feel excited.

……

In the front yard.

After Ling Qingxue and Xia ruofei were led to the flying Snow Pavilion in the backyard by the female staff, a man who was sitting on a long bench by the bar counter immediately stood up with an unhappy expression.

The man was dressed in Armani casual clothes, and even his shoes were Armani. His hair was smooth and shiny, and behind a pair of rimless glasses, there was a pair of small eyes. When the eyes were slightly squinted, they gave off a cunning and shady feeling.

He walked over to the old Lu that Ling Qingxue had called out to and said unhappily,””Manager Lu, what do you mean? Are you looking down on me, Tian Mingyi?”

“Principal Tian, how would I dare?” manager Lu quickly said. What do you mean ...”

This Tian Mingyi was the vice principal of the Central Primary School in the Bell Tower District. This status was not a big deal. If there were children who wanted to go to school, they would have to be respectful to him. However, manager Lu’s child was already in high school. Moreover, he was the manager of Ling Ji private kitchen. He would not have any business dealings with a primary school Vice Principal. Logically speaking, there was no need to be so polite to him. There was even a trace of fear.

Manager Lu’s attitude was respectful mainly because Tian Mingyi’s father was the Deputy Director of the health Bureau of Sanshan city. The health Bureau was related to the food and beverage industry. The hotel’s health license, regular Health Inspection, employee health certificate, and so on were all under the jurisdiction of the health Bureau.

Manager Lu naturally didn’t dare to offend a rich second generation like Tian Mingyi.

Tian Mingyi sneered and said, “Didn’t you just say that all the private rooms have been booked? Why did those two people get a private room as soon as they came? Flying Snow Pavilion? Aren’t the private rooms here numbered? This room sounds a little different!”

Manager Lu could not help but smile bitterly in his heart and quickly explained,””Principal Tian, you’ve misunderstood. This private room was reserved by our President Ling a long time ago. Furthermore ... Flying Snow Pavilion is not open to the public.”

“You’re open for business, yet you still have private rooms that aren’t open to the public?”Tian Mingyi sneered. This is new ...”

At this time, a middle – aged man beside Tian Mingyi also couldn’t help but say,””Manager Lu, you’re giving us preferential treatment! Are you afraid that our principal Tian can’t afford it? Are you still looking down on principal Tian?”

“I wouldn’t dare to look down on the leaders, director Wu!” Manager Lu quickly said. This room is indeed our President Ling’s ...”

Director Wu was the director of the health supervision office under the health Bureau of Sanshan city. He had a lot of power over these catering enterprises. If you offended him, you would have to do a spot check every two or three days, and you wouldn’t be able to continue your business. Therefore, manager Lu was very nervous.

Inspector Wu laughed coldly.”Vice – Chancellor Tian asked for a private room, but you’re so dilly – dallying and trying to reject him. The moment that President Ling came, you gave him all the reserved rooms. I think you’re not taking Vice – Chancellor Tian seriously!” I say, old Lu! Do you want to close your restaurant?”

Director Wu’s words were very arrogant, and manager Lu couldn’t help but feel a trace of anger in his heart, but he didn’t dare to show it.

Those in the F & B service industry would inevitably be bullied. Manager Lu had been in this line for many years. He used to be a Senior Branch Manager of a Central Branch of lingji F & B. This time, when Ling Xiaotian opened the high – end market and opened the first lingji private kitchen, he transferred him over to be the manager. This was also a high degree of trust in Him.
