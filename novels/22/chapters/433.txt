Chapter 434: Grasshopper on a rope (1)

Lu You had a worried look on her face. When she saw Xia ruofei, she quickly asked,””Xia ruofei, I heard that you’ve been arrested by the police. Is it because of what happened a few days ago? They didn’t make things difficult for you, right?”

Lu You’s barrage of questions left Xia ruofei scratching his head. He smiled bitterly and said,””Lu You, are you from the CIA or the KGB? He’s so well – informed!”

From the time Xia ruofei got into Qin Xiao Yu’s police car at Tao Yuan farm to the time he was released, it had only been about an hour. Even Ling Qingxue did not know about this, but Lu You had already received the news and rushed to the Public Security Bureau.

If Xia ruofei had not been released, Lu You would have barged into the police station.

Lu You’s face heated up slightly and she said,””It was your farm staff who told me ... Don’t ask so much, what’s the situation now? Will you be alright?”

Actually, ever since she had been rescued from the zero degrees fantasy bar by Xia ruofei and spent a night at the Peach Blossom Farm, a figure had left a place in Lu You’s heart that had never been touched before.

These few days, Lu You had not been eating or drinking and was always absent – minded in class. Xia ruofei’s shadow would flash in her mind from time to time.

Lu You was very clear about Jiang Yue’s feelings for Xia ruofei. She had also vaguely sensed that she seemed to have developed some feelings for Xia ruofei. Thus, Lu You always felt a little guilty in front of her best friends. Naturally, she would not confide in Jiang Yue about this kind of trouble and kept it in her heart.

Today, she finally couldn’t take it anymore. She didn’t think of a proper reason to meet Xia ruofei, so she drove to Taoyuan farm alone.

In reality, when Lu You was on the road, Xia ruofei was sleeping soundly in the police car. However, the winding highway was a one – way closed – off Route. Lu You naturally did not notice that Xia ruofei was in a police car that flashed past on the opposite Lane.

When she arrived at the farm, Lei Hu, who had witnessed Xia ruofei being taken away in handcuffs, was anxiously trying to get rid of a retired soldier like him. He did not know anyone else in Sanshan city and could not think of any solutions.

Lu You had been here a few times, and Xia ruofei had even specifically told them to let Lu You through when they saw her car. Thus, Lei Hu knew Lu You.

When he saw Lu You at the door, he immediately told her about Xia ruofei being taken away by the police of the Criminal Investigation Detachment of the city Bureau. In his opinion, it was always better to have one more person to think of a solution. Moreover, Lu You was so young and could drive a BMW MINI that cost hundreds of thousands. Her family must be quite well – off and might be able to help Xia ruofei.

The moment Lu You heard that Xia ruofei had been taken away by the police, she immediately thought that it might be because of the incident at the zero – degree dream bar a few days ago. She didn’t have time to think and immediately rushed to the city Police station anxiously. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Fortunately, Lu You saw Xia ruofei before she even entered the Public Security Bureau. Otherwise, she might really cause a scene at the Public Security Bureau. For Xia ruofei, she could not care about keeping a low profile, nor could she worry about her mother finding out about what happened that day.

Seeing Lu You’s worried expression, Xia ruofei felt warm inside. He smiled and said,””It should be fine. They just wanted to find out more about the situation.”

“Really?” Lu You didn’t quite believe it.

She had seen the surveillance video. Although she did not see Xia ruofei break Fang Luo’s fingers one by one and cut off his manhood, she had seen Xia ruofei’s attack on the big men who were guarding the bar. Even the accomplices were in such a miserable state, so how could the culprit, Fang Luo, have a good time?

Thus, Lu You knew the severity of the matter. She did not dare to believe Xia ruofei’s casual statement.

“Yes, the police let me go after a few questions, but ...” Xia ruofei said.

“But what?” Lu You hurriedly asked,”could it be that they will catch you in the future?”

“I don’t think so.” Xia ruofei shook his head and said apologetically,”Lu You, I don’t think I can hide what happened that day from Secretary Tian ...”

“Oh, so what if you know!” Lu You said indifferently,”it’s fine as long as you’re fine.”

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly and said,”I’ve provided the police with the surveillance footage from that day. I didn’t expect that big ... That policewoman to recognize you at a glance!” Then she left for a while and came back to let me go. I think this matter has already been reported to Secretary Tian, so you should be mentally prepared. ”

“I understand ...” Lu You said softly. Then, she raised her eyebrows and asked,”you said female police officer? Does she have a chest ... Uh, a good figure, about twenty – four or twenty – five years old?”

Xia ruofei nodded awkwardly and said, “She’s Qin Xiao Yu, the Vice captain of the first criminal investigation team.”

“It really is her!” Lu You had a look of sudden realization.

“Lu You, do you know this female police officer?” Xia ruofei asked.

Lu You nodded.”Yes, we’ve known each other for many years. Xia ruofei, I don’t blame you for this. Who knew that it would be such a coincidence? it just so happens that sister Xiaoyu is working on this case!”

Lu You was very clear that Tian Huilan must have already found out about what happened that day. Although Qianqian and Qin Xiaoyu had a good personal relationship with her, they would never and would not dare to help her hide such a thing. It was because this was no longer a small matter and if it was not handled properly, it could very well escalate into a problem between the two families.
