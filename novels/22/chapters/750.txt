Chapter 751: Wailing ghosts and howling wolves (3)

The Stingers of bees had barbs. When they left in a hurry after stinging someone, the barbs would still hang on the person’s skin, which would usually bring out the internal organs of the bee. Therefore, bees would basically die after stinging someone.

On the other hand, the Stinger of the Hornet did not stab backward, so in theory, it could be “used repeatedly.” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

After the two bullies were stung, they frantically slapped the Hornets. However, these Hornets had grown in the spirit map space for so long, and their reactions were also very fast. How could they be hit by them?

Often, before the palm could reach him, the Hornet would have already leaped up and ruthlessly bit down on another spot.

The thug’s hand hit the place where she had been stung, and she cried out in pain.

In just a few seconds, their heads and faces had been stung more than a dozen times, and they were swelling at a speed visible to the naked eye.

Especially their faces, which were severely affected by the disaster. They were swollen like pig heads, and even their own mothers couldn’t recognize them.

Xia ruofei didn’t release many Hornets this time. Although he hated these two bullies, he couldn’t kill them.

Even if no one could find out after the incident, Xia ruofei couldn’t treat human lives like grass. Wouldn’t he be a homicidal maniac?

After about 20 stingers, Xia ruofei used his spiritual power to order the Hornets to fly up and still hover around the ceiling of the bathroom.

The shrill screams of the two bullies immediately attracted the attention of the waiters in the corridor. Someone immediately rushed over and heard that the sound came from the women’s washroom. They quickly called a waitress in to check.

Lin Qiao had just walked to the door of the bathroom when the waiter waiting outside stopped her and said,””I’m sorry, this bathroom is temporarily unavailable. Please walk a few more steps. There’s another bathroom around the corner. ”

“Oh ...” Lin Qiao also heard the scream from the bathroom and didn’t know what happened. Of course, she was dizzy and in a hurry to go to the bathroom, so she naturally wouldn’t go in. She just turned her head to take a look and continued to walk in the direction pointed by the waiter.

......

No one noticed that behind Lin Qiao, near the ceiling of the corridor, there was a Hornet following behind her. Xia ruofei would never let Lin Qiao out of his sight, except when she was relieving herself in the bathroom.

The waitress was also shocked when she entered the room. The two men had been badly stung. After their faces swelled up, their skin became smooth and shiny like balloons that would burst with a press. Their eyes were so swollen that there was only a thin line left, and their lips were also swollen. The two of them were in so much pain that they rolled on the ground, letting out muffled cries.

After making sure that there was no one else in the bathroom, the waitress quickly called her male colleagues in.

“It’s a Hornet!” A sharp – eyed person saw the Hornet circling the ceiling and shouted.

Everyone subconsciously hid outside the bathroom. Although there were not many of them, they were too big and looked very scary.

“Quick ... Quick, call security!” A person who looked like a supervisor said in a trembling voice,”also, call 120! Those two guests seem to be in serious condition!”

While everyone was busy, Xue Fei, who was in Room 607, gave Hu Lili a look. Then, the two of them got up and left the room one after another.

Everyone in the room was drunk and no one noticed that two people were missing.

With the exception of Xia ruofei, who had been watching the surveillance in front of the computer, the moment Xue Fei stood up, Xia ruofei immediately ordered the Hornets left in the room. Except for two who were left to monitor the room, the remaining ten Hornets without cameras and four other Hornets with cameras flew out deftly when the door opened.

Xue Fei and Hu Lili had originally planned to go directly to the private room upstairs. Xue Fei’s eyes were full of lust, thinking that he would be able to enjoy a good time with women later.

However, as soon as they stepped out of the door, they were shocked by the movement in the bathroom on the right. They turned around and saw that there were a few waiters gathered at the door of the bathroom. In the distance, the nightclub security guards were also rushing over.

Xue Fei’s first reaction was that the commotion caused by Hong Mei and her partner was too big and had attracted the attention of the nightclub staff.

“Motherf * cker! Didn’t I tell them to be careful?” Xue Fei cursed in a low voice,”can’t you teach that girl a lesson when we get to the private room? F * ck!”

He was a little worried that tonight’s good thing would be ruined, so he anxiously took Hu Lili to the bathroom to see what was going on.

When they arrived at the bathroom, the waiters naturally stopped Xue Fei and Hu Lili. There were ferocious Hornets in the corner, so they couldn’t let the guests in. If someone else got hurt, they would lose their jobs.

However, just because humans didn’t go in, it didn’t mean that the Hornet wouldn’t come out.

When Xue Fei and Hu Lili walked to the door of the bathroom, Xia ruofei’s spiritual power was released at the same time.

The hornet’s nest that had been circling around the bathroom ceiling buzzed and flew out of the door.

The remaining 10 Hornets that followed Xue Fei out of Room 607 also received the order to attack. They flapped their wings and pounced at the two, forming a pincer attack.

When the waiters saw the Hornet suddenly fly out of the bathroom, they were so scared that they stepped back. Xue Fei and Hu Lili, who didn’t know what was going on, were also stunned.

The next moment, a buzzing sound was heard as twenty Hornets swooped down toward the two of them.

It was only then that Xue Fei and Hu Lili finally reacted. Their eyes were filled with fear, and they couldn’t help but scream. Then, they subconsciously covered their heads and tried to run away.

However, how could the Hornet let them go after receiving the order to attack?

Could two legs be faster than the flying speed of these Hornets? In the blink of an eye, the two hordes of Hornets caught up with their respective targets and stung their heads, faces, and hands.

The wails of ghosts and howls of wolves resounded in the night club again ...
