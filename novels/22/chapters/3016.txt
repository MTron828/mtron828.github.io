3017 The biggest harvest (1)

After hearing Luo Qingfeng’s words, Xia ruofei’s heart was completely at ease.

He was silent for a while before he said,””I know. You stand guard outside for me. Remember, don’t let anyone in. Don’t come in unless I call you!”

“Yes! Master!” “Yes,” Luo Qingfeng replied.

In the quiet room, Xia ruofei heaved a long sigh of relief. Then, he calmed himself down and returned to the spirit map space.

Just now, he was so excited that he didn’t have the time to think about it. Now, he had to feel the changes in himself.

After entering the spirit map space, Xia ruofei’s first feeling was that his understanding of this space had become very clear.

In fact, Xia ruofei used to feel that his control of the spirit map space was very good. But now, it was a completely different feeling.

In the past, he might have known it but not the reason.

But now, with his understanding of the laws of space, the spirit map space seemed to be able to be broken down into the most basic laws in his eyes.

Of course, in the spirit map space, especially the space of the Archean realm, the rules were much more complicated than the space inside the ore. At the same time, it was also more complete. Xia ruofei was still unable to completely understand the rules like he did in the ore.

If he could do that, Xia ruofei would be able to break open the spirit map’s space, even if he was not the one controlling it.

Of course, after the spirit map space had been upgraded several times, it was very close to the outside world. The spatial rules here were very complete and stable. It was extremely difficult to break through such a space.

Therefore, the safety of the spirit map space, at least for now, was absolutely not an issue.

At least, Xia ruofei knew that even the Jie Li Bai Qingqing could not do this.

From this point of view, Bai Qingqing’s spatial talent was indeed very good, and her attainments in the aspect of space were also very high. However, she was probably at Xia ruofei’s current level at most, or perhaps even worse.

Xia ruofei quietly comprehended the rules of the spirit map space for a while, silently corroborating them with the space rules he had comprehended in the past thousand years. He also had some new insights in his heart.

After he withdrew his thoughts, he turned his gaze to a certain place in the space.

It looked empty, but in fact, there were layers of spatial power wrapped around the mysterious ore.

Xia ruofei’s feelings were complicated. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

The purpose of his participation in the auction was to get two storage rings for Song Wei and Ling Qingxue. He had never expected that the biggest gain would actually be this mysterious ore.

Of course, it was also because of this ore that Xia ruofei had almost fallen into a situation of eternal damnation.

He still felt a lingering fear when he thought back to the dangers he had experienced inside the ore space.

There were a few times when his spirit body was almost instantly torn apart in the complex layered space.

Furthermore, even if there were no such dangers, being trapped in such a lifeless environment for a thousand years could easily lead to a mental breakdown, and one would go crazy.

Now that he thought about it, if Xia ruofei’s will wavered even a little, he might really be trapped in it and never be able to get out.

Xia ruofei really wanted to use his spiritual power to check again, but he could not muster the courage.

In fact, Xia ruofei had another thought in his mind. The spirit map space was also “drooling” over this mysterious ore. He could completely let go of the restraints and let the spirit map space devour this ore.

This was because Xia ruofei was still tempted to explore the secrets of the ore space again. However, at the same time, he told himself that this idea was very dangerous and that he should not try it.

If he let the spirit map space devour it, he would no longer have such thoughts.

However, after much thought, Xia ruofei still couldn’t bear to do it.

The laws of the small spaces within the ore were very primitive and simple. To comprehend the laws of space, this was a very valuable resource.

It was equivalent to dismantling the complex and complete spatial laws, crushing them and embedding them into different small spaces. At the same time, he also used some stacked spatial regions to demonstrate the effect of the combination of laws.

It was naturally more effective to comprehend the spatial laws through such a small space and layered region than to directly comprehend the complete spatial laws.

Xia ruofei felt that if he did not make full use of this mysterious ore, he would definitely regret it in the future.

Therefore, he eventually suppressed the idea of letting the spirit map space devour him directly.

Xia ruofei muttered to himself and called Xia Qing over using telepathy.

“Master, do you have any orders?” Xia Qing slightly bowed and asked.

Xia ruofei waved his hand and the spatial force that enveloped the mysterious ore turned transparent. It looked like the ore was suspended in mid – Air. Of course, the spatial force was still in effect, isolating the connection between the ore and the spirit map space.

“Can you recognize what this is?” Xia ruofei asked.

Xia Qing looked at it for a long time and said with a slight frown,””I’m sorry, master. I don’t recognize this stone ...”

“You don’t know him, or you can’t say it due to the rules?” Xia ruofei asked.

“I really don’t know him!” Xia Qing said with a bitter smile. In fact, after master broke through to the Golden core stage, the rules “restrictions on me are already very small. There’s basically nothing I can’t say.”
