Chapter 1724: Tide of praise (2)

During the press conference, Tony had prepared a Chinese translator to sit beside Xia ruofei even though he knew that Xia ruofei’s English was good. Xia ruofei was Chinese.

However, Xia ruofei answered the reporters ‘questions in English the entire time, so the poor translator became a decoration and sat there awkwardly.

The netizens were instantly overjoyed.

“Op, you’re a bad person. I had to watch the video again just to see the expression of the translator. It was so embarrassing ...”

“Please translate the area of psychological shadow!”

“Everyone’s thinking too much! He just sat there and did nothing, and he earned the translation fees! This kind of job is simply what I dream of! Are there any more? Give me a dozen!”

......

Xia ruofei didn’t know about the revelry on the internet. He and Feng Jing stayed at Tang Yitian’s house for three or four days and visited all the attractions worth visiting. They even took Tang Yitian’s luxury yacht out to sea and had a great time.

When they were out at sea, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but think of the amitz yacht that he had ordered. Although the small yacht he had ordered was nothing compared to Tang Yitian ‘s, he was still full of anticipation.

At that time, the construction period was about two months. Including the transportation time, he would have to wait at least another month.

Even though Feng Jing was also very happy, she couldn’t forget about the company in China.

In her opinion, she had been delayed in Australia for too long. In addition, she had stayed in Saipan for two days, so she was eager to return home.

However, she also knew that Xia ruofei had ordered oak barrels. He would definitely wait until the wooden barrels were completed and the fermented grape juice was taken away before he returned to the country. Thus, she did not rush him.

The two of them returned to Hunter Valley’s Paradise Farm after a few days of fun.

Li Yifu finally left and returned to United States he really wanted to stay, but he did not dare to disobey Xia ruofei’s order.

At Paradise Farm, Feng Jing also began to inspect the farm seriously.

She asked about the management model of the farm, sales channels, and so on in detail. In addition, she was also very interested in some of the modern facilities of the Australian farm. While inspecting it, she also recorded it in her notebook.

Xia ruofei, on the other hand, had a few days of leisure. Sometimes, he would sit by the lake in a daze for half a day. Sometimes, he would excitedly feed the Swans and kangaroos. He even pulled Feng Jing, who had unknowingly entered work mode, to experience the hot air balloon trip in the Hunter Valley.

One day, Xia ruofei and the others were having lunch at the small farm villa when Old West called.

“Xia, the oak barrels you ordered have arrived. Do you want to come over and take a look?” Old West laughed heartily.

“Of course! Uncle Wester, please ask Uncle Carl to wait for a moment. I’ll come over after my meal!” Xia ruofei said happily.

Feng Rao, who was sipping on her soup, put down her spoon and asked with a smile,””Are the wooden barrels ready?”

“Yup!” Xia ruofei said,”we agreed on a week. It’s only the sixth day! Uncle Carl is quite efficient. ”

Liang Qichao, who was standing beside him, asked curiously,””RUO Fei, why did you order the oak barrel?”

“Of course it’s for the wine!” Xia ruofei said,”to be precise, it’s to fill the grape juice to ferment and let it ferment in the oak barrel!”

“And then?” Liang Qichao’s IQ seemed to be a little off.

Xia ruofei glanced at him and said,””Then, it’s time to brew wine! Is there a problem?”

Liang Qichao chuckled and said,”I didn’t know you were going to make wine!” I just want to ask you, if the two big wineries are yours, why do you have to custom make a few wooden barrels to make wine? Don’t tell me West and gold oak wineries don’t even have oak barrels?”

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”you don’t know this, do you?” New oak barrels have their own benefits. New barrels have the greatest impact on the taste of wine, and I’m not using new oak barrels to make wine in the winery ...”

Xia ruofei felt that it was hard to explain and immediately shut his mouth.

However, Liang Qichao was even more curious now.””If you don’t make wine in the winery, where else can you make wine? Do you want to turn the farm into a winery?”

“Why are there so many questions? Just eat your food!” Xia ruofei said,”can’t I fill two buckets for my friends?”

“Okay, okay, okay, you’re the boss, so you have the final say!” Liang Qichao said with a smile. He looked at Feng Jing and smirked.”Could it be a female friend?”

Xia ruofei glanced at Liang Qichao, put down his bowl, and took out his phone. He said slowly,””I haven’t called uncle Liang for a long time, I really miss him! By the way, last time he asked me about that Devra ...”

This was Liang Qichao’s weakness. Xia ruofei had not even threatened him and he had already compromised.

Liang Qichao put on a flattering smile and said,””Brother! Brother! I was wrong! I shouldn’t have asked this and that, please spare me!”

Liang Qichao’s funny expression made Feng Rao laugh. The deputy manager of the farm, Daphne, seemed to have heard her name. However, Xia ruofei and the others were speaking in Chinese, so she could not understand. She looked at Liang Qichao questioningly.

Xia ruofei stood up and said,”I’m done!” You guys can eat slowly! I’m going to the winery!”

Feng Rao quickly put down her bowl and said,””Wait for me! I’ll go with you!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”sister ran, continue eating!” I’ll be waiting for you!”

Feng Rao’s heart felt warm and she said,”I really am full! Let’s go!”

Xia ruofei and Feng Jing drove a car and left Paradise Farm.

It was only then that Daphne asked curiously,””My dear, what did our boss just say? Why are you so scared?”

“Boss told us something very terrifying ...” Liang Qichao said with a sad face.

Daphne could not help but feel nervous.””What terrifying thing? Is he going to fire you? I think I even heard him mention my name. Is he going to fire me too?”

The pay at Paradise Farm was good, and it was relatively easy, so naturally, Daphne cared a lot about the job.

“It’s much scarier than being fired ...”Liang Qichao said.

Daphne’s face turned pale, and she asked in a trembling voice,””My dear, what’s the matter?”

Liang Qichao patted Daphne’s shoulder and said with a smile,””I’m just joking with you! The boss is my good brother, how could he fire me!”

However, Daphne refused to believe it, and Liang Qichao had to explain it to her.

......

Xia ruofei did not know that his joke with Liang Qichao had frightened Daphne. At this time, he was driving to West Winery with anticipation.

The winery and the farm were not far from each other, so Xia ruofei and Feng Jing arrived at the winery’s entrance very quickly.

As soon as Xia ruofei got out of the car, he saw six oak barrels placed neatly in the open space in front of the main building of the winery. Old West and Carl were talking next to the oak barrels.

When he saw Xia ruofei and Feng Rao, Old West immediately stepped forward and said,””Xia! Come and take a look at our new oak barrel! It’s a work of art ...”

Xia ruofei walked over and his gaze naturally fell on the six oak barrels.

The six oak barrels were of the same size. They were similar to the ones Xia ruofei had seen in the West Winery. The ends were small and the middle was big. There were a few iron hoops on top of them.

However, at first glance, the wooden barrel gave people a comfortable feeling. After approaching it, the oak barrel, which had been baked during the production process, had a special fragrance.

At the bottom of the barrel, a special symbol was stamped. It was the unique symbol of the old barrel craftsman, Carl, indicating that the barrel was produced in his factory. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Uncle Carl, you’ve worked hard!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Hehe,” Carl chuckled.”It’s a pleasure to meet such top – Quality oak and personally make them into oak barrels. It’s not hard at all!”
