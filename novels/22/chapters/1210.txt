Xia ruofei’s speed was too fast. After Section Chief Li’s shoulder joint was dislocated, he was stunned for a full two seconds before he felt the severe pain. He couldn’t help but cry out in pain.

Xia ruofei furrowed his brows and pointed his finger at Division Chief Lee. To his horror, Division Chief Lee found that he could not make a sound.

His mouth was wide open, but his throat seemed to be frozen, and his vocal cords could not move at all. He was like a suffocating duck, opening his mouth and holding his throat, but he could not make a single sound.

“Chairman, didn’t you say you wouldn’t use force?” Feng Jing said helplessly.

Chairman? Section Chief li even forgot his fear and turned to look at Xia ruofei. Isn’t this Feng Rao’s chauffeur? How did he become the chairman?

Xia ruofei glanced at chief li in disgust, then said to Feng Jing,””I’m already very civilized, is this considered violence? Is there a wound on his body?”

Feng Rao glared at Xia ruofei unhappily.

Wasn’t it violence if there were no injuries? The dislocated shoulder joint was in excruciating pain. In just a short while, his forehead was covered in sweat. He did not know what Xia ruofei had done to him, but he could not make a sound.

This was not considered using violence?

However, Feng Jing was also full of hatred for Section Chief li, so she naturally did not mind Xia ruofei’s sophistry.

“What do we do now?” she asked, a little worried.

Xia ruofei did not answer Feng Jing’s question. Instead, he looked at chief li and said,””You still want to make a sound?”

Section Chief li nodded his head repeatedly.

Xia ruofei said,”then be good!” If you keep wailing like a ghost or a Wolf, I’ll give you another round! And let me tell you, if your meridians are sealed for too long, even if you unseal them, you might not be able to make a sound. At that time, you can be a mute for the rest of your life!”

Section Chief Li’s face changed drastically when he heard this. He shook his head repeatedly and then nodded repeatedly.

Xia ruofei understood what he meant. He pouted and pointed at him. Division Chief li immediately groaned in pain.

He could make a sound! Section Chief li was pleasantly surprised, but his expression changed immediately. He quickly covered his mouth and looked at Xia ruofei, his body trembling slightly.

He had been scared out of his wits. In his eyes, Xia ruofei was a demon.

In fact, Xia ruofei’s move might look scary, but it was nothing to be proud of.

His Chinese medicine attainment was now comparable to some Chinese medical Masters. He had a deep understanding of the human body’s meridians. In addition, he had true Qi in his body, so it was easy to block section Chief Li’s meridians.

Xia ruofei sat down on the chair and crossed his legs. He asked calmly,””CEO Feng, did you record everything?”

Feng Jing nodded. She took out a small recording pen from her handbag and handed it to Xia ruofei.

There was a trace of fear in Division Chief Li’s eyes, but at the same time, there was a trace of well – hidden evilness.

Xia ruofei glanced at Section Chief li and pressed a few buttons on the recording pen. The room was filled with Section Chief Li’s proud voice.

“One million in cash! Not a single cent less!”

“As long as you accompany me for a night, the few floors of the balance power building will definitely belong to your paradise company!”

......

Xia ruofei turned off the recording pen and looked at Section Chief li with a meaningful smile on his face.

Section Chief Li’s face turned pale and he knelt down in front of Xia Rufei.

He had forgotten that his right arm had been dislocated, and this sudden movement caused him to lose his balance. He fell to the ground and hit his dislocated shoulder joint. It was so painful that he couldn’t help but scream.

However, he immediately thought of what Xia ruofei had just said. It was as if someone had grabbed his neck and his scream stopped abruptly.

Section Chief Li’s face was pale from the pain. He struggled to kneel in front of Xia ruofei again and begged,””Big brother! Big brother! I was wrong, please give me a chance...I...I...I promise that your company can buy those few floors of Hengli building at the lowest price!”

If it was someone else who had recorded this evidence, Section Chief li would definitely not have this attitude.

Shixin hotel was almost his base and he knew many people in the society. However, the power that Xia ruofei had just displayed, especially the ability to make him unable to make a sound with a simple point of his finger, was too terrifying. He was scared out of his wits.

Therefore, Division Chief Lee’s first reaction was to beg for mercy.

Xia ruofei glanced at Section Chief li and said,””I’ve already given you a chance, but you didn’t take it ...”He said.

Section Chief li was taken aback. He did not know that the ‘chance’ Xia ruofei was talking about was the one before Feng Jing entered the room. If he had stopped at the edge of the cliff and allowed Xia ruofei, the ‘driver’, to enter the room with him, Xia ruofei might have only given him a light punishment.

However, things were completely different now.

Xia ruofei ignored chief li. He took out his phone and dialed a number.”Where are we now?”

A young voice came from the phone.””We’ll be there soon. There was a traffic jam on the way. ”

This man was one of the friends that Song Wei had introduced to Xia ruofei not long ago. He was Liu Zhe, who Xia ruofei had ridiculed for having a weak kidney. His father happened to be the leader of the provincial state resources Administration, so Xia ruofei thought of him immediately.

“Yes, go to Room 503 directly when you arrive!” Xia ruofei said indifferently,”we’ll wait for you here!”
