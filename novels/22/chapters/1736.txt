Chapter 1737: One drink, one Peck (2)

At this moment, the sound of a car came from outside the door. Du Jingjing’s spirit was roused, and she quickly looked up.

However, her face soon turned gloomy. It was just a passing car, and it was driving very fast. She didn’t know if it was because of the rumors, but it didn’t dare to stay here for long.

Du Jingjing sighed faintly. It seemed that there would be zero sales again today. If that was the case, there had not been a single customer for three consecutive days, right?

Why don’t ... I just resign and go home to take care of my baby! Du Jingjing suddenly had this thought.

For the past ten days, she didn’t know if it was because of psychological reasons, but she always felt that her mental state was not right after staying in the resort. She even had a faint bad feeling, as if a voice was telling her,”She had to leave this place quickly, or the baby would be affected.

The wall clock behind the bar showed that it was almost 12:50. Because there were no customers, the employees had finished their work meals early and were lazily wasting time at their respective posts.

Suddenly, du Jingjing felt a hint of warmth in her body.

She couldn’t help but look left and right and asked,””Did any of you turn up the heater?”

“Supervisor, I didn ‘t!” A round – faced waitress said.

“You don’t say, I suddenly feel much warmer!” The cashier who was playing card games at the bar also looked up and said.

The round – faced waitress ran over and looked at the control panel of the central air conditioner.””No, I didn ‘t! The temperature setting hasn’t changed!”

These days, the resort’s staff often felt a little cold. Even if the heater was turned on, it had no effect, so many people still wore thick coats indoors.

But now, everyone felt the temperature rise, and a few people couldn’t help but take off their coats.

“The air feels fresher!” The round – faced waitress replied,”it’s not stuffy at all!”

Only then did du Jingjing realize that she was not hallucinating. The suffocating feeling that had accompanied her for the past few days had disappeared.

At this time, another car came from afar. When it reached the entrance of the resort, it gradually slowed down and finally drove in.

Du Jingjing was the first to react. She quickly greeted,””Everyone, be more alert. We have guests!”

Then, she quickly walked out to greet him.

It was a BMW X5 off – Road vehicle. The car stopped in the empty parking lot in front of the resort’s main building, and a man and a woman in down jackets got out of the car.

The man took off his sunglasses, looked around, and said,””The environment here is not bad, let’s eat here!”

“I heard that there are some unclean things around here!” His female companion said hesitantly. Why don’t we go to another shop?”

The man laughed and said,”look at your suspicious look. It’s a bright and clear day. How can there be any unclean things?” Besides, it’s almost oneo’ clock now. I’m starving. Let’s do it here! Let’s continue our journey after eating!”

The girl looked around and didn’t seem to find anything wrong. Instead, there was an inexplicable sense of relaxation and comfort.

Hence, she nodded and said,”alright!” We’ll eat here!” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

At this moment, du Jingjing also came out to welcome them. She smiled and said,””Welcome to the Imperial hot spring, please come in!”

As du Jingjing led the two of them inside, she asked,””May I ask if the two of you are here for accommodation or a meal?”

“Let’s eat!” The man said,”we’ve missed dinner time on the way here. Please ask the kitchen to hurry up. We’re both famished, and we still have to continue on our way later!”

In fact, the two of them were from Beijing and had just returned from a self – driving tour. They were going to have lunch at home, but they were delayed on the road. By the time they arrived at little Tang town, they were already hungry, so they decided to find a place to eat nearby.

“Alright, please follow me!” Du Jingjing said.

As she led the two of them to the restaurant, she said,””The two of you must have had a hard time driving, right? We have natural hot springs, fish therapy, and other programs here that are very effective in relieving fatigue. We’ve also been doing a promotion recently, and the prices are very favorable. Do you want to know more about it?”

The man and his female companion looked at each other, pondered for a moment, and then nodded.””Alright! After we’re done ordering, you can introduce us!”

“Alright!” Du Jingjing was overjoyed and quickly said. Alright! Please take a seat, this is our menu!”

Du Jingjing had successfully promoted the resort’s hot spring project. This was undoubtedly a good sign for the hot spring resort, which had not been opened for three days.

The truth seemed to be proving du Jingjing’s psychological suggestion. For the first time, four groups of guests came that afternoon. In addition to the hot spring and other activities, there was also a couple with a child who chose to stay at the hot spring resort.

Of course, these people were not here to spend money. They were all passing by and walked in on a whim.

Du Jingjing and the others, of course, did not know that the land not far from the resort had undergone amazing changes, and even their resort had benefited a little.

In fact, the resort’s business was not good before. On the one hand, it was because of the scary rumors on the internet. On the other hand, it was also because they were too close to the land. Although it was not within the scope of the array, the yin Qi that was emitted was also uncomfortable.

Especially for pregnant women like du Jingjing, their bodies were even more sensitive. In fact, her sixth sense had been very accurate these few days. If Xia ruofei had not turned the yin formation into the Yang formation and du Jingjing had been working at the resort for a long time, the baby’s condition would not have been good. The probability of miscarriage and deformity would have been greatly increased.

Of course, she hadn’t been exposed to Yin Qi for a long time. In addition, the formation had already been reversed, so she naturally wouldn’t be affected.

On the contrary, after the formation was reversed, Yang Qi and spiritual Qi would also be released. Although it was only a small amount compared to the inside of the formation, du Jingjing’s fetus would also benefit. Including the guests today, although some of them who heard the rumors were hesitant, after really staying here for a while, without exception, they all gave up the idea of retreating and stayed to spend. This was also because the negative impact of the yin formation had become the positive impact of the Yang formation.

After all, it was a natural formation, and it was impossible to completely lock the yin Qi or Yang Qi within the range of the formation.

If Xia ruofei had known that the small amount of Yang Qi that was released would bring such benefits to the neighbors, he would not have minded.

After all, the yin formation had greatly affected his business. He would just treat it as compensation.

There was a limit to what one could do.

......

Naturally, Xia ruofei did not know about the changes that had happened at the neighboring hot spring resort. On his way back to the capital, he had already called Zhao Yongjun and told him that the problem with the formation had been solved. Now, the follow – up work could proceed as planned.

Zhao Yongjun was naturally overjoyed when he heard this. He repeatedly said that he wanted to make it bigger and refute all the negative news from before with facts.

Zhao Yongjun would arrange these things, so Xia ruofei didn’t have to worry.

After he drove back to the courtyard house and got off the car, Wu Qiang walked over and said to Xia ruofei,””President Xia, miss song just came to visit you.”

Xia ruofei was stunned and said,”Song Wei?” Where is she now?”

“In your courtyard!” Wu Qiang replied,”I told her that you went out to handle some matters and I didn’t know when you would be back. She said that she would wait for you in the courtyard and I didn’t dare to stop her.”

Xia ruofei smiled.”It’s okay. You did the right thing.”

With that, Xia ruofei walked back to his own courtyard.

After a few steps, he turned back and said,””Wu Qiang, make me some noodles! I haven’t had lunch yet! I’m a little hungry!”

“Alright!” Wu Qiang hurriedly replied.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”wait!” I’ll ask Song Wei if she’s eaten. If not, I’ll have to get two servings! Go and boil the water first! Wait for my notice. ”

“Alright, director Xia!” “Yes, master!” Wu Qiang replied in a straightforward manner and then quickly walked to the kitchen.

Xia ruofei walked towards the courtyard in the middle.
