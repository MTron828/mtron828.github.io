2630 It’s really God’s arrangement_2

Brook waved at the crowd with a smile on his face, then stepped down the ramp.

The girl holding the flowers also stepped out of the crowd and waited at the bottom of the ramp. There was a middle – aged woman with an outstanding temperament standing beside her.

When Brook stepped down the last step, the girl took a step forward and handed over the flowers with tears in her eyes. She said with a choked voice,””Dad! Congratulations!”

It turned out that this girl was the daughter of the captain, Brook. She had come here today to give her father flowers, and the woman beside her was Brook’s wife.

After Brook took the flowers, he hugged his wife and daughter with a smile on his face. The sound of shutters and everyone’s applause suddenly sounded.

After a short hug, Brook patted his wife and daughter’s back and said,””Wait for me!”

Then, he passed the flowers back to his daughter. He ignored the reporters who kept reaching out for their microphones and strode towards Xia ruofei.

From a distance, Captain Brook laughed and opened his arms. Xia ruofei also smiled and went up to him. The two of them hugged each other.

“Xia, did you come here to celebrate my first return flight?” asked Captain Brook. You’re such a good friend!”

“Captain Brook, is this the first flight after the restoration of flight?” Xia ruofei was stunned.

“Yup!” Brook grinned.”After the injury on my arm recovered, I went through a long stage of psychological intervention treatment. Finally, after a psychological test and a simulator test, the aviation Director confirmed that I have the qualifications to fly again. Today is my first flight, and the company has specially assigned ‘RUO Fei’ to let me fly. We think this is more memorable.”

After experiencing the horror in the air, Captain Brook not only had broken arms and suffered external injuries, but also witnessed his colleague Johannson being poisoned to death in his seat and the co – Pilot, Wilkinson, being sucked out of the cockpit by a huge airflow and dying without a burial place. This had caused a great psychological trauma to him.

In fact, during this long period of time, Captain Brook had mainly been recuperating psychologically.

He continued to receive psychological intervention treatment. From the moment he closed his eyes, he would see the terrifying scene in the cockpit, and when he slept, he would dream of Wilkinson and Johannson. Later, his symptoms gradually alleviated, and he finally met the seafaring standards. It could be said that this was an extremely difficult process.

In the end, Captain Brook was able to return to his flight position completely due to his strong perseverance and his love for flying.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”then I really have to congratulate you!” “Captain Brook, but ... I’m not here to attend the ceremony. I wasn’t informed beforehand. In fact, I’m here to inspect my farm and winery in Hunter Valley. I didn’t expect that our two planes would land one after the other. We were even noticed by the tower administrator, which led to such an interesting arrangement.”

Brook’s eyes widened and he exclaimed,””God! This is unbelievable!”

Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”I also think it’s unbelievable!” ‘No matter what, I’ve made it in time for this important ceremony! Brook, congratulations again! I also wish you a safe and sound flight in the future! Have fun flying!”

“Thank you! Thank you!” Brook said,”in the words of you Chinese people, this is called ‘meeting by fate’!”

When Captain Brook said the words “we are fated to meet,” he actually used Chinese. Although it was a little awkward, his pronunciation was relatively clear.

“I didn’t expect you to have learned Chinese ...” Xia ruofei said in surprise.

Brook grinned and asked,””In the process of psychological treatment, I learned some Chinese by myself and also developed a great interest in your magical Chinese medicine. Of course, my Chinese standard is still very average. It’s only limited to a small number of daily phrases!”

At this point, Captain Brook revealed a distressed expression and said,””Your language is too complicated ... Xia, Did you know? I saw a topic on a Chinese learning Forum and I’m still confused!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows and said,””Oh? Tell me about it, I can answer your questions!”

Brook nodded and said,”Xiaofang said,’your sister, my period hasn’t come this month. I’m worried to death. This is simply a scam!’ The question was, who was in a hurry? A, Xiaofang’s sister B, Xiaofang’s mother C, Xiaofang’s Sister D, Xiaofang’s father E, Xiaofang’s period F, Xiaofang’s G, Xiaofang’s boyfriend Xiao Ming ...”

Xia ruofei almost burst out laughing when he saw Captain Brook’s confused look. He patted Captain Brook’s shoulder sympathetically and said,””Brook, it’s just a funny question. You don’t have to take it seriously.”

Brook’s eyes widened and he asked,””Is there no answer to this question?”

“Uh ... The answer is, of course, yes,” Xia ruofei said,”if it were me, I would choose G, Xiaofang’s boyfriend, Xiaoming.”

After hearing this, Captain Brook was even more confused, because he was the first one to rule out this option.

“Why?” Brook could not help but ask. This little Ming didn’t even appear in the main text!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but rub his forehead and said,””It’s a little complicated ... I’ll explain it to you when I have time. You should go to the celebration ceremony now ...”

Brook came back to his senses and said,””Alright then! Xia, you have to explain this question to me, it’s too profound! Oh, right ...”

After saying that, Captain Brook smiled at Xia ruofei and asked,””Xia, do you still remember what I said when the plane landed?”

“I remember you said a lot.” Xia ruofei shrugged his shoulders and asked,”which sentence are you referring to?”

“I said that everything is God’s arrangement,” said Captain Brook seriously. Look! You’re on the first flight after I resumed my flight, and you’re here. Our planes landed one after another, which further confirms my theory, right?”

Xia ruofei was speechless. He smiled and said,””Captain Brook, of course I respect your faith, but in my opinion, this is just a coincidence!”

“This is not just a coincidence ...” Captain Brook insisted.

At this moment, a gentle voice sounded,””My dear, everyone is waiting for you!”

It was Captain Brook’s wife, Molly. She had seen her husband leaving the airline leaders and media reporters to chat with a young man in a private plane nearby for so long, so she couldn’t help but come over to take a look.

“Hey! My dear!” Brook said excitedly,”look who’s this?”

Mo Li was stunned for a moment and looked at Xia ruofei seriously. In the eyes of many Westerners, the faces of Chinese people were similar, just like how Chinese people looked at foreigners in the same way. Many Chinese people could not distinguish the features of foreigners.

Mo Li’s eyes gradually widened. She covered her mouth and exclaimed,””Oh! God! You’re Mr. Xia!”

Captain Brook put his arm around Molly’s waist and said with a smile,”Xia, this is my wife, Mo Li!”

Xia ruofei then smiled at Mo Li and said,””Lady Mo Li, it’s a pleasure to meet you!” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Thank you! Thank you ... Mr. Xia, you’ve saved my husband’s flying career. No! You’ve saved his life!” Mo Li exclaimed agitatedly,”I’m so happy to be able to see you at such a special time!”

Brook hugged Molly tightly and said,””My dear, we should go!”

Then, he turned to Xia ruofei and said,””Xia, you should come with us! I believe that the higher – ups of the aviation Administration and the media reporters present will be very happy to see you here!”
