Goodman noticed that the phone rang and Charlie accepted the call.

This made Goodman’s heart skip a beat. Obviously, Charlie Koch had been waiting beside the phone. Although Goodman was in a hurry to deal with this matter, and the entire Bay group was in a mess, it had taken him nearly two hours from the time he started setting up to Manino’s execution of ERAD and the interrogation of medel. This was already a Godspeed.

For the past two hours, Charlie Kohler had been waiting by the phone, all for an answer. It could be seen that Charlie Kohler had placed an exaggerated amount of importance on this matter.

Of course, Goodman didn’t know that Charlie Coch was still on the rescue ship. Although the rescue ship had immediately turned back to Hawaii after picking him up, and Charlie Coch had planned to take a plane back to United States from Hawaii, the location of the accident was quite far from Hawaii, so the flight was expected to take at least six to seven hours. Charlie Coch had occupied the Captain’s Lounge, and he had no place to go on the rescue ship, so he could only stay in his room.

Normally, with how busy he was, he would not wait for two hours just for a phone call.

Goodman didn’t know the details, so he was even more nervous. When the call went through, he quickly said,””Mr. Coch, I’m Goodman! The matter has been investigated clearly, and we’ve also carried out the preliminary handling. I’ll call you to report the situation. ”

“Go ahead!” Charlie Koch said in a reserved manner.

He had already made up his mind. If Goodman’s decision didn’t satisfy him, he would launch all his family’s power when he returned to the United States and give the Gulf Group A heavy blow.

One must know that this was the first time the Daoist immortal had given him a task, so of course he had to handle it beautifully.

“Mr. Koch,” Goodman quickly said,”according to our investigation, this incident was started by the Bay group’s quachaquakos branch. But our person in charge in the state of vilacrus, ERAD, is the main person responsible ...”

Following that, Goodman gave a concise report of Manino’s findings to Charlie cohe. In the end, he said,””I’ve already ordered the person in charge of the Bay group’s northeast area to personally come to kuachakurakos. Now that ERAD has been executed by our internal department, we’ll deal with all those involved in this matter in the next few days! Mr. Cohe, there are also some local politicians involved. If we kill them all at once, it might ...”

“You guys handle it well!” Charlie Koch had no interest in listening to Goodman’s explanation. Besides, the main culprit, ERAD, and the instigator, Madel, had already been executed. As for those trashy politicians, it didn’t matter if they lived for a few more days.

In fact, what Charlie Koch was more concerned about was how the Gulf Group would obtain the understanding of Huafeng shipping. He felt that this was what the immortal was more concerned about. Otherwise, the immortal could kill small shrimps like ERAD and Madel with a wave of his hand. Why would he go through so much trouble?

But Charlie Koch didn’t take the initiative to mention anything. If Goodman couldn’t even think of this, then the Bay group deserved to be destroyed.

Goodman was obviously not a brainless person. He knew how to show his sincerity, so he immediately said,””Yes! Mr. Cohe, we will get rid of all the people involved in this within the next week! In addition ...”

At this point, Goodman pondered for a moment, then continued,””In order to express our apology, in addition to the preferential treatment of our Chinese friends in Mexico and the protection of our Chinese people, our Gulf Group is also ready to pay Huafeng shipping 50 million US dollars in spiritual compensation ...”

In fact, before Goodman made the call, he was planning to pay 25 million dollars in compensation. After all, Huafeng shipping’s real estate value was only a few million dollars, and they didn’t have any substantial losses. Giving 25 million dollars was already a very good show of sincerity.

However, because Charlie cohe had picked up the call at the first moment, Goodman felt that Charlie cohe had placed an unusually high amount of importance on this matter, so he had doubled the compensation amount at the last minute.

Of course, for the Bay group, which controlled a huge amount of drug trafficking resources, 50 million dollars was only a small amount. If this matter could be settled, Goodman wouldn’t feel the pinch at all.

After hearing this, Charlie Coch did not say anything. Seeing this, Goodman quickly added,”Mr. Cohe, if you feel that this amount is not suitable, you can name it. We will do our best to satisfy your request!” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Charlie Koche muttered to himself for a moment before saying,”I will convey this to my Chinese friends. As for whether they accept it or not, it’s not up to me to decide.”

Hearing this, Goodman’s heart skipped a beat. He had always thought that even if Charlie Koch personally came out to handle this matter, the Chinese would at most have a very good relationship with him. However, from his tone, it seemed like his position was even higher. Although Charlie Koch was helping to handle this matter, he couldn’t make the decision.

What kind of super big Shot was this? Goodman couldn’t help but shudder. In his memory, there shouldn’t be such a powerful person in China! Even the second and third generations who were extremely impressive in the eyes of ordinary people were in fact nothing in the eyes of the old United States families like Charlie cohe. Those people might have a lot of influence in China, but when it came to the international scene, not many of them were really tough.
