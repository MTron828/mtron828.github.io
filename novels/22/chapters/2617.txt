“In fact, the development of green cloud Island has been going on for more than ten years. This is also the overseas project that old Liu values the most.” Elder song said,”he built the blue cloud Island as the last resting place for the Liu family in order to prevent the Liu family from having no place to live when the situation in the country is irreversible. Therefore, after more than ten years of development and construction, this Island has already become a strong fortress. It’s simply a military fortress. ”

Hearing this, Xia ruofei’s interest was piqued. He said,””You’re saying ... The Liu family has also set up military facilities on this Island?”

“Yes, and it’s definitely a big deal!” Elder song said,”according to the information we have, there is a small mountain on green cloud Island that has been hollowed out. The refuge embedded in the mountain can withstand the blow of a nuclear explosion. On the surface, they also spent a lot of money to set up a large number of defense systems, and hired mercenaries to guard it all year round. It can be said to be impregnable. ”

“Now that you’ve mentioned it, I’m very interested!” Xia ruofei said,”this is a ready – made paradise!”

“According to the official data, the size of the cyan Cloud Island is almost five square kilometers, which is about the size of two Yongxing islands.” Elder song continued,”however, after the Liu family obtained the permanent ownership of Qingyun Island, they have been encircling the sea. Now, it has expanded by about one to two square kilometers, so the area is still very large. Moreover, green cloud Island has a natural deep – Water port, and the Liu family has also built a dock there. In addition, they have also built a 3000 – meter long runway, which can totally provide the take – off and landing of Boeing 737 – Class aircraft. The conditions are quite good!”

Xia ruofei was surprised,”it’s much bigger than I thought!” I thought it was just a small island!”

“If it’s just a private island in the ordinary sense, why would old Liu sell it for 2.5 billion dollars?” elder song laughed. According to my calculations, the Liu family’s investment in the past few years should not be less than this amount. So, if I had to choose, between 3 billion US dollars and blue cloud Island plus 500 million US dollars, I would definitely choose the latter. ”

“Understood!” Xia ruofei nodded and said,”Grandpa song, thank you for your suggestion! This information will be very helpful to me!”

“So, you already have a choice?” Elder song asked with interest.

“If I have to choose one out of the three, since you have already analyzed it so thoroughly, of course I will choose the blue cloud Island Plan.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”but I have the initiative now. Why do I have to charge the treatment fee according to the plan proposed by elder Liu? The blue cloud Island could be considered an option! However, I still want to have a chance to do some field research. After all, the cost of maintaining such an Island is not low. If I don’t use it well, there’s no need to do so. ”

“That’s true. ” Elder song said,”this kind of Island is specially prepared for big families. You’re single, so there’s no use for such a big place!”

“I have a girlfriend, okay?” Xia ruofei was unconvinced.”The term single dog doesn’t suit me anymore.”

He added another sentence in his heart,’not only do I have a girlfriend, but I have more than one!

“If you’re not married, doesn’t that mean you’re single?” elder song laughed.

Then, elder song continued,”but if you choose the green cloud Island, you can sell it to the song family even if you don’t need it!” I can give you an additional 5% based on the actual valuation. However ... We also need to pay in installments. After all, the song family can’t afford such a large sum of money. ”

“If you want it, I can get it from the Liu family and give it to you,” Xia ruofei said.

“That won’t do!” Elder song said without hesitation,”if it’s just a small gift, even if it’s a slightly more precious gift, I’ll take it as your filial piety and accept it. But the entire blue cloud Island ... I can’t accept it!”

“Then I’ll have to consider whether to choose this blue cloud Island or not.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”according to my wishes, I hope that the Liu family will make some concessions in other matters. I don’t want too much in terms of economic benefits.”

Elder song naturally understood what Xia ruofei meant. He said seriously,””Ruofei, if you don’t have to get involved in the family business, try not to. The relationship between the Liu and song families is very complicated. Last time, we already broke the rules a little. This time, you must not get involved!”

“Grandpa song, I can feel that Grandpa Liu’s attitude has changed after his relapse. I believe that if I’m willing to work for him, the Liu family and the song family ...” Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment.

“RUO Fei, listen to me!” Elder song said,”the situation is very complicated. It’s not just about the Liu and song families. Our two families are already top families in Huaxia. Some people are happy to see our two families fight over some things. In the past few months, the Liu and song families have stopped fighting, which has already made some people very uneasy. If our two families show signs of cooperation, I’m afraid there will be many undercurrents. In short, don’t bother about this matter! You can charge however much the treatment fee is. You don’t have to be polite with the Liu family, and you don’t have to help them save money. However, you shouldn’t get involved in some family matters. ”

Xia ruofei could guess what was going on. Where there were people, there would be fights. The big families in Huaxia were not just the Liu family and the song family. Although there were not many families that were on par with these two families, there were still some. Moreover, if some of the weaker families were to join forces, they could not be underestimated.

All sorts of forces were complicated, and the disputes of interests were even more complicated. For big families like the Liu family and the song family, any slight adjustment in their strategy could cause a chain reaction.

Since elder song had said so, Xia ruofei would not do anything bad.

“I understand, Grandpa song.” He nodded. Don’t worry, I won’t act rashly. ”

“Mm! You just need to listen to me. ” Elder song said,”by the way, the Liu family is very sincere this time. If you are satisfied with the treatment fee, try your best to treat old Liu! You don’t have to worry that he’ll harm you after he’s recovered, or that he’ll go against the song family again. I’ll protect you from all these things, and the Liu family knows my determination, so they won’t dare to go against you easily. ”

Xia ruofei’s heart warmed, and he said,”I understand, Grandpa song.” In fact, elder Liu’s condition is really complicated this time. I don’t have any intention of delaying it. ”

Eccentric song smiled and said,””Let’s not talk about this. Ruofei, if you’re not too busy, can you find some time to have a meal with me and have a chat? Old people tend to reminisce, but my children and grandchildren are busier than one another, and it’s rare to see them ...”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said,”I’ll go over to see you after I’m done with my work these few days! Grandpa song, take care of yourself, I’ll hang up first ...” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Good, good, good!” Elder song laughed and said,”I’ll be waiting for you at home. Don’t forget to bring two bottles of good wine!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said,”don’t worry. I promise I won’t forget!”

After hanging up the phone, Xia ruofei rested for a while in his room. When it was close to noon, he went to elder Liu’s ward to give him a checkup.

After they came out, Xia ruofei found Liu Qunfeng and asked,””Chief Liu, elder Liu mentioned the green cloud Island today. I wonder if it’s convenient for us to go and inspect it? It’s really too difficult for me to choose. After all, this blue cloud Island is just a name. It’s not as intuitive as three billion US dollars or 40% of the shares ...”
