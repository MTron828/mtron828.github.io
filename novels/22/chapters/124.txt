Chapter 125: Monster – Class SUV (Part 1)_1

[5th chapter seeking monthly votes and subscriptions!] Xia ruofei was shocked when he saw the car. The car was more than six meters long and nearly three meters wide. The black body of the car completely abandoned the traditional curves and was full of sharp edges and corners. It looked like a bloodthirsty beast with a kind of domineering aura. It was simply a road tank! The half – ton pickup truck was like a little brother in front of it, and the mighty Hummer H2 was like a little sheep next to it. Xia ruofei quickly used the remote control to open the courtyard gate of the villa. The three – meter wide gate was only big enough for the car to pass through. A domineering and fierce off – Road vehicle stopped in the courtyard, and a young man in a dark blue suit jumped out of it. “Hello, are you Mr. Xia?” “I am. You must be manager Huang, right?” Xia ruofei said with a smile. “I wouldn’t dare, I wouldn’t dare. Mr. Xia, you can just call me Xiao Huang!” Manager Huang said quickly. Xia ruofei thought,”Hengfeng group is indeed a super Financial Group!” A mere manager of the three mountains office actually drove such an impressive car ... Although he didn’t know how much this off – Road vehicle with the “K” LOGO on the front was worth, he could tell from the outside that it was definitely not cheap. However, Xia ruofei naturally would not say what he was thinking. He just smiled and said,””Manager Huang, thank you for your hard work ...” “You’re welcome, Mr. Xia!” Manager Huang said respectfully,”this is a task personally assigned by Chairman MA. We don’t dare to neglect it!” Manager Huang opened the car door and took out a large thermos box from the back seat. He handed it to Xia ruofei and said,””Mr. Xia, please check it!” Xia ruofei took the thermal box and looked at it. It was still sealed by the Hengfeng group. Seeing that the seal was intact, he smiled and tore it off. He opened the thermal box. It was filled to the brim with rice. Xia ruofei knew that truffles had to be stored in rice, so he reached in and took a look. Sure enough, he found a piece of white truffle. When he took it out, he saw that although it was smaller than the one he had at the MA family’s mansion, the quality was not inferior. Xia ruofei didn’t check how much truffle was in the box. He buried the White truffle in the rice and closed the lid of the chamber. “No problem. Thank you, manager Huang!” Xia ruofei said. “Mr. Xia, please sign this!” Manager Huang passed a list to Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei signed his name without a second word. “Manager Huang, I’m going to put down the truffles. Please excuse me ...” Xia ruofei said. Although the rice stored in the insulated box would be fine for a while, Xia ruofei still couldn’t wait to put them into the spirit map space. It was the only place where they could keep the food fresh. “Please wait a moment, Mr. Xia. We haven’t finished handing over the items yet!” Manager Huang said quickly. “Ah? There’s something else?” Xia ruofei was stunned as well. He asked in confusion,”what else is there?” “It’s this car!” Manager Huang said,”Chairman MA of the corporation instructed me to send this to you. We have already completed all the relevant procedures.” “What?” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but cry out,”you’re saying ... This car is also for me?” “Yeah! Chairman MA personally told us that the car just passed through Hong Kong’s customs yesterday. We used all our connections to get all the relevant procedures done in one day. ” Manager Huang said. Xia ruofei couldn’t help but look at the two – meter – tall giant off – Road vehicle. It was like a muscular monster and had a strong visual impact. Strictly speaking, it was already an armored vehicle. “No, no, no! This car is too expensive, I can’t take it!” Xia ruofei quickly waved his hand and said,”you should just drive back!” “Mr. Xia, I’m only in charge of delivering the car and the things to you. I can’t make any decisions for other matters!” Said manager Huang. Please help me sign for it first!” “I really can’t accept this ...” Xia ruofei said with a bitter smile. “Mr. Xia, if you don’t accept it, I won’t be able to report back!” Manager Huang pulled a long face and said,”please help me! If you really don’t want it, you can call Chairman MA or Chairman MA later and ask them to take it back!” Xia ruofei said helplessly,”all right ... Come, sign for me!” Manager Huang was just an errand boy, and Xia ruofei could not talk to him. Manager Huang quickly took out another sheet of paper and handed it to Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei did not look at it and signed it. Manager Huang passed the car keys and remote control to Xia ruofei and said,””Mr. Xia, let me introduce you to this car!” Xia ruofei smiled bitterly and nodded.””Alright then!” Speaking of cars, manager Huang immediately perked up and said,””Mr. Xia, this Knight XV off – Road vehicle is produced by Canada’s Conquest vehicle company. Every one of them is hand – made and there are only 100 of them in the world. “The body of the car is made of bulletproof steel plates and glass fiber wheel arches and bumper. The windows and windshield are all made of bulletproof and transparent materials. It is equipped with a 6.8 – liter V10 engine with a maximum power of 400 horsepower. The interior uses an improved Ford heavy vehicle chassis ...” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be dumbfounded. How was this a car? It was simply a tank! “Manager Huang, can you tell me how much this car cost?” he quickly asked. Manager Huang smiled and said,”the overseas price of this car is $695000. However, after including the shipping and tariffs, it’s definitely worth far more than this price. Chairman MA also customized a thicker armor and deeply modified the car. As far as I know, the total cost is no less than $4 million!” Alright! This car alone was worth more than 20 million Chinese dollars, which was several times more than Xia ruofei’s current net worth! Even though Xia ruofei was mentally prepared, he was still shocked by the price. “Mr. Xia,” manager Huang continued,”after the modification, the weight of this car has reached more than six tons, and the carrying weight can reach about three tons. The internal space has reached 283 cubic inches. Even if six professional basketball players sit in it, it won’t feel crowded at all. In addition, this car can withstand 20 kilograms of explosives, and the chassis can withstand the impact of hand grenades. In addition, the default bulletproof level of the entire vehicle is B4, but this car can reach B6 after some modifications ...” Then, manager Huang introduced some other features of the car, such as the Wilton cashmere carpet, night vision, rear camera system, PS3 game console, alpaian navigation and Bluetooth equipment, bulletproof flat tires, and original factory flash lights. In addition, it was equipped with a built – in oxygen survival kit and other safety features. It also came with a 27 – inch LCD TV, a water bar, a freezer, a cigar box, and other facilities. It could be said that it was luxurious in every way. After manager Huang finished his introduction, he looked at the monster – grade SUV with envy. Then, he took out a file and handed it to Xia ruofei.””Mr. Xia, this is the full set of documents for this car. The application for the mainland license plate is already in the process. I will send it to you when it’s done. During this period, you must bring these documents with you when you drive out for the traffic police to check.” “Alright, thank you!” Xia ruofei took the document with a smile. “Mr. Xia, I’ll take my leave first.” Manager Huang said. “Manager Huang, it’s not easy to get a taxi here since there’s no village or shop. Let me send you to the main road nearby!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’ll try this car too.” “Then ... I’ll have to trouble you!” Manager Huang said. “Wait a moment, I’ll put the truffle in.” Xia ruofei said. He carried the insulated box into the villa and went to the kitchen to avoid everyone’s eyes. Then, he summoned the spirit map scroll and sent the insulated box into the spirit map space. Then, Xia ruofei quickly walked out of the villa and called manager Huang to get in the car. The Knight XV’s chassis was 355mm from the ground, so the body of the car looked very high. Xia ruofei stepped on the pedal and sat in the driver’s seat of the Super SUV. He had the illusion that he was climbing onto a Dongfeng Truck. He took a deep breath, inserted the key into the hole, twisted it, and started the fire ... Knight XV immediately roared. Xia ruofei suddenly felt his blood boiling ...CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m
