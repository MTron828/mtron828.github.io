2937 Full speed operation_

“Senior granduncle,” Li Yifu said excitedly,”this is a disciple’s duty. Please don’t say that!”

Xia ruofei patted Li Yifu’s shoulder and said,””After a period of time, when everything is on the right track, you can stay on the island and cultivate in peace! I should be spending more time on the island, and this will be our base camp from now on! If you have any problems with your cultivation in the future, you can come and ask me at any time. ”

“Yes! Thank you, senior granduncle!” Li Yifu said, touched.

“The recruitment and the registration of the company can be started at the same time.” Xia ruofei said,”if we can’t find enough people, we’ll give priority to the normal operating conditions of the airport. The positions of the administrator and stewardess must be filled as soon as possible. Otherwise, the charter flight of qucan’t be used to Fly to Paradise Island.”

When Xia ruofei and the others took the public jet paradise to come here, they had already landed on their own when they were supposed to be in charge of the tower. The airport’s automatic navigation equipment was always in operation, and there were absolutely no other planes in the airspace and on the airport runway. In addition, the pilot was also his own employee, so although this operation was a little illegal, there was no problem.

If it was a charter flight by a regular airline, the pilot would not be able to control the plane to land on his first flight to the airport without the tower’s command.

Therefore, the airport’s normal operation was the top priority.

“This disciple understands!” Li Yifu said,”don’t worry, senior granduncle. I will complete the recruitment of airport staff as soon as possible!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes!” One more thing to take note of was to ensure that the personnel were absolutely reliable! Also, I will personally interview every person you recruit. Not a single one can be left out!”

“Yes!” Li Yifu replied solemnly.

He knew Xia ruofei’s rules. The workers he had hired to carry out the reconstruction work had to be personally interviewed by Xia ruofei. Of course, he also knew the importance of the Paradise Island, so he agreed with Xia ruofei’s actions. He also believed that one could never be too careful when it came to safety.

The group of them chatted as they walked and soon returned to the Yanhuang building.

In the next few days, Xia ruofei focused on his cultivation. While he was working hard to consolidate his cultivation, he also spent as much time as possible with Song Wei and Ling Qingxue.

The days of pure – heartedness had finally become history. Now, the three of them had basically formed a tacit understanding. Xia ruofei took turns to accompany Song Wei and Ling Qingxue in “cultivation” in days. While he was cultivating, he naturally enjoyed the good fortune of being with women.

There was still about a week before the auction, and the cultivation environment on the Paradise Island was much better than that of the star Seizer sect. Therefore, Luo Qingfeng did not return to the sect and stayed there to cultivate.

Anyway, the invitation was in his storage ring. He could just go with Xia ruofei from here.

Li Yifu was busy with the complicated tasks that Xia ruofei had given him.

If these tasks were given to an ordinary person, they might not be able to do it in a month or two. However, Li Yifu had a unique advantage. Not to mention registering a company, he had a group of professionals in his own company. It could be said that he was familiar with the process. It was said that he could settle both companies in a week at the earliest, and the equity relationship was also very clear.

In terms of recruitment, Li Yifu’s strong network also played a role. The Hong sect itself was full of talents, so he also gave priority to selecting disciples from the Hong sect. Although the Peach Blossom Island was isolated overseas, there were still many people who applied. Everyone was looking for Li Yifu, the big boss of the Hong sect.

Li Yifu was highly respected in the Hong sect. If she could work beside Li Yifu, her status in the Hong sect would naturally rise.

In addition, Xia ruofei had helped Li Yifu find two prescriptions from the cultivation classics and easily made pills that could enhance the physical quality. He had also let Li Yifu spread the news. Some young disciples of the Hong sect who wanted to improve themselves were even more eager to get the pills.

As for some relatively unpopular professional positions, Li Yifu had also successfully recruited suitable talents through his business connections.

These people had gone through a round of remote interviews. The airport was in urgent need of administrators, aircraft maintenance personnel, meteorological professionals, and so on. There were about 15 or 16 people, respectively in Australia and the United States Xia ruofei simply sent the business plane paradise to fly twice and bring these people to Paradise Island.

Naturally, Xia ruofei had to conduct the individual interview.

He still used the spirit hypnotism technique that had worked every time and checked everyone’s background. The people Li Yifu found were quite reliable. Except for one person’s resume, which was flawed, the others had no problems. There was not a single person who had sneaked in with ulterior motives.

The one with a flawed resume was not a fake resume. Under Xia ruofei’s hypnosis, he told Xia ruofei everything about himself. Xia ruofei judged that he was barely qualified for the job, so he didn’t pursue the matter and let him stay.

Of course, the main reason was that this person’s position was at the airport’s weather control station. Xia ruofei had already decided that the position of the person in charge of the weather control would be reserved for Ma Jia’s lover. Therefore, this person would only stay to help out. He was basically competent.

As for the staff in the other positions, it was not the time to worry about them yet. Moreover, these people did not set off from the same place, so Xia ruofei could not be extravagant enough to send a private plane to pick them up one by one.

Therefore, they mainly took the plane to the nearby Island and then came up by boat.

Xia ruofei had already asked Li Yifu to purchase two passenger ships for future transportation between peach source Island and the nearby islands. In the future, with more staff, everyone would naturally have the need to leave the island. At that time, these two ships could directly be changed into regular logistics ships, making it convenient for everyone to enter and leave the island.

After the airport began to operate normally, the garrison personnel on the island was naturally put on the agenda.

Tang Yitian had already arranged for a Boeing 757 plane from Australia to set off at any time to pick up the people in the three mountains.

Before everything was ready on the peach source Island, Li Yifu and ma su had communicated with each other several times. Soon, they decided on the departure time. Then, the charter plane in Australia took off on time and headed for the Sanshan International Airport.

……

Taoyuan farm.

The guards had already cleaned up the room.

They lived in the vacant staff apartment of Tao Yuan farm. Today, they were leaving for Tao Yuan Island. They had never lost the good work style of the People’s Army. Before leaving, Ma Jia organized everyone to clean the surrounding environment and the apartment they lived in.

When the team members gathered below the apartment, the rooms they had lived in were all clean and bright. The sheets on the bed did not have a single wrinkle, and the blankets were folded into neat tofu blocks.

Three Golden Dragon buses with the LOGO of the Paradise Corporation slowly drove into the paradise Farm and stopped in front of the employees ‘apartment building. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei’s assistant, Qin Yanan, was here with a car to send them to the airport.

After some small talk with Qin Yanan, Ma Jia organized everyone to board the train.

After getting on the bus, everyone saw that there was an identical camouflage suitcase next to each seat. There was also an army green sign hanging on it with everyone’s name printed on it.

When everyone saw the luggage, they were stunned.

Qin Yanan was holding a small megaphone used by tour guides. She smiled and said,””Hello, everyone! I’m President Xia’s assistant, Qin Yanan. President Xia has specially instructed me to prepare the luggage beside everyone’s seats. President Xia said that everyone should be able to use these things when they get to work!”
