“I’m sorry, I have to take this call,”Xia ruofei said.

Ling Xiaotian smiled and nodded. He picked up drunken eight immortal’s wine bottle and poured himself some wine. Then, he leaned over and poured Xia ruofei some wine as well.

Ling Xiaotian and Ling Qingxue were not outsiders, so Xia ruofei did not deliberately avoid them. He answered the call directly at the dining table.

“Manager Qin.” Xia ruofei said,”is that my yacht?”

“Yes, Mr. Xia,” Qin Lan said enthusiastically,”your yacht has been shipped from Heron Island to our Yacht club’s dock. When will it be convenient for you to come over and receive it?”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”it’s a little late today. How about this?” I’ll find some time to come over tomorrow morning. ”

“Alright, alright!” Qin Lan said happily,”Mr. Xia, I’ll be waiting for your arrival at the club tomorrow!”

It was a win – win situation for everyone. CEO Huang canceled the deal as he wished. Xia ruofei got a satisfactory yacht at a cheaper price and faster time. Qin Lan also closed a big business deal of sixty to seventy million Yuan. Her Commission for this month would increase a lot.

“Okay, see you tomorrow!” Xia ruofei said indifferently and hung up the phone.

“Ruofei, you bought a yacht?” Ling Qingxue asked as she looked at Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes!” Originally, it would take more than half a year for the yacht to be placed in order and delivered, but this time, they happened to have a client who wanted to cancel the order due to financial problems and gave me a big discount, so I accepted the order. ”

“What kind of yacht is it? That must be a lot of money, right?” Ling Xiaotian asked with a smile.

“Azmu’s 100 Leonardo is considered one of the more high – end models among azmu’s yachts.” Xia ruofei smiled.”The entire set would cost about 60 to 70 million!”

” 60 to 70 million ...” Ling Qingxue’s family was rich, but she still exclaimed in surprise.”You’re really rich now!” He just bought a yacht worth sixty to seventy million!”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”My company has sufficient cash flow. Besides, I’m in light debt. I didn’t think too much about it. I thought it was a good idea, so I bought it.”

Ling Xiaotian laughed and said,”you’ve made the right choice!” Hahaha! This was how young people should be! As long as you don’t pretend to be rich, you can spend as much as you want within your financial ability!”

Ling Xiaotian was also tactfully reminding Ling Qingxue that even if she and Xia ruofei were to get married in the future, she should not be too strict on the issue of money. Otherwise, men would have rebellious thoughts.

Of course, Ling Qingxue had no intention of stopping Xia ruofei from spending. She did not even catch the hint from Ling Xiaotian. Instead, she said excitedly,””Ruofei, I’ll go with you to see the new yacht tomorrow!”

Xia ruofei spread his hands and said,”I’m fine with it!” But don’t you have to work?”

Xia ruofei turned to look at Ling Xiaotian after he finished speaking.

Ling Xiaotian chuckled and said,”Qingxue, you can go with RUO Fei tomorrow!” It’s been hard on you during this period of time, so just take it as a break. I’ll keep an eye on the company. ”

Ling Qingxue was very happy and said sweetly,””Thank you, dad!”

“Silly girl! Do you need to be so polite with me?” Ling Xiaotian smiled and said,”come, ruofei, let’s drink!” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Xia ruofei quickly raised his glass and said,””Uncle Ling, a toast to you!”

After the two of them clinked their glasses, Ling Xiaotian raised his head and finished the wine in his glass. He then praised,””Good wine!”

This was the first batch of Drunken Eight Immortals that Xia ruofei had stored in the medium. When this batch of wine was stored in the medium, Ling Xiaotian had not even purchased the winery. Xia ruofei had bought the wine himself and put it in. It was also because Ling Xiaotian had drunk the Drunken Eight Immortals that Xia ruofei had given him that he had the idea of acquiring the winery.

This batch of wine had been around for more than a year. If one included the time flow difference at the Archean realm, it would be several decades.

Even in the outside world, a wine that had been aged for decades was definitely of the best quality. Furthermore, it was constantly being nourished by the rich spirit energy in the medium. This batch of Drunken Eight Immortals had absorbed so much spirit energy that it was more or less like spirit wine.

Ling Qingxue had already stepped into the door of cultivation, so she could naturally feel the faint spiritual Qi in the Drunken Eight Immortals wine. She couldn’t help but say,””I’ll have a cup too!”

Ling Xiaotian looked at his daughter and said with a smile,””Qingxue, when did you learn how to drink white wine?”

Ling Qingxue was a little embarrassed as she said,””I just wanted to try it out because I saw your intoxicated look.”

Ling Xiaotian laughed out loud,”alright, alright, alright, I’ll let my precious daughter have a taste of this fine wine!.”

Ling Xiaotian then passed the bottle of wine to Ling Qingxue.

Ling Qingxue couldn’t wait to pour herself a glass. Then, she raised her glass and said,””Dad, ruofei, let’s have a drink together!”

“Alright!”

“Come, cheers!”

Ling Qingxue took a big gulp. Even though it was a little spicy, it had a fragrance that made one reminisce. At the same time, the faint spiritual energy in the wine excited the true Qi that was slowly flowing in her meridians.

Ling Qingxue took a deep breath and imitated Ling Xiaotian’s expression.””It’s really good wine!”

Ling Xiaotian and Xia ruofei looked at each other in dismay. Could it be that this girl had become a little drunkard?
