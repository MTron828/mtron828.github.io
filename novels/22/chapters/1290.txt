Chapter 1291: Chapter 779 – not playing by the rules_1

Translator: 549690339

The entire bojun building was for the personal use of bojun real estate and was not rented out to the public. Their front desk was set up in the lobby on the first floor.

After Xia ruofei explained his purpose of visit, the front desk of bojun real estate quickly picked up the phone to report. After a while, a young woman in business attire came out of the elevator.

When the woman saw Xia ruofei and Feng Rao, who looked extremely young, she was stunned for a moment before she quickly asked,””Are you President Xia and President Feng from paradise Corporation?”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Nice to meet you. I’m Xia ruofei. This is our general manager, Feng Jing.”

The woman quickly said,”Hello, President Xia!” I’m he Xin, the Secretary of the Board of Directors! Boss Xu is already waiting for you in the meeting room, this way please!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. He followed He Xin to the elevator with Feng Jing and Liu Qian.

He found it funny as well. Bojun real estate was only a small real estate company in Sanshan, yet it had its own group and even had a Board of Directors ... But on second thought, his company was much smaller than bojun real estate, and it didn’t even have a proper Board of Directors, yet Feng Jing and the others still called him Chairman. Don’t laugh at the pot calling the kettle black. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

The elevator went up very quickly. While Xia ruofei was still in a daze, he had already reached the 18th floor.

He Xin did not know that Xia ruofei had already criticized bojun real estate in the elevator. She put on a professional smile and said,””This way, please!”

When they arrived at the meeting room, He Xin bowed slightly and said,””Boss Xu, boss Xia and boss Feng from paradise Corporation have arrived!”

Xia ruofei looked up and saw four or five people sitting on the side of the long conference table near the wall. In the middle was a middle – aged man in his forties. He was wearing a navy blue suit and a tie. His square face looked resolute and his eyes were very bright. One look and one could tell that he was a successful man.

If he was not mistaken, this middle – aged man should be the boss Xu that He Xin had mentioned. As for the others, they should be the company’s negotiation team.

As expected, after he heard He Xin’s introduction, he stood up unhurriedly and said with a faint smile,””President Xia, President Feng, how are you? I’m the Senior Vice President of bojun real estate, Xu Jiahui. Please have a seat!”

After Xia ruofei, Feng Jing, and Liu Qian took their seats, Xu Jiahui introduced them to the negotiation team from bojun real estate.

“President Xia, President Feng, for the sake of the company’s strategic development, we are interested in selling the property on the 1st floor and the 9th floor of the Hengli building. Considering that your company has just bought the other half of the property rights held by the power construction Group, we will also give priority to your company’s cooperation ...”

Xu Jiahui was speaking with fervor and assurance. Xia ruofei also had a polite smile on his face, but he was criticizing in his heart. What company development strategy? Wasn’t it just because there was a big problem with the capital chain, and he had to sell his assets in exchange for capital? He said it so arrogantly.

After Xu Jiahui introduced their assets in Hengli building, Feng Jing looked at Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei nodded slightly, and Feng Jing understood.””Chairman Xu, since we’re here today, we’re definitely interested in the property in your hands. Chairman Xu, why don’t you tell us your conditions?”

Xia ruofei and Feng Jing were both young people and didn’t like to beat around the bush. On their way here, Xia ruofei had already decided on today’s strategy with Feng Jing, which was to get straight to the point. Furthermore, Xia ruofei’s decision to personally handle the negotiations surprised Feng Jing.

Xu Jiahui smiled and said,”the reason why I considered working with your company first is that it’s a win – win situation for us. Our bojun can get the funds to support the company’s development strategy, and your company can integrate the resources of balance power building. It’s a very good choice whether you rent it or keep it for your own use.”

Xu Jiahui said all this to add some weight to the negotiation. However, when he saw Xia ruofei and Feng Jing frowning at the same time, he shut his mouth.

After a moment of silence, he said,””All of our properties in Hengli building will be transferred to your company for a price of 500 million Yuan. There is only one condition, that is, within one week after the contract is signed, the payment must be ...”

Before Xu Jiahui could finish his sentence, Xia ruofei stood up and said without hesitation,””Boss Xu, there’s no need to talk about the other conditions. If that’s the case, there’s no need to continue the discussion today!”

“CEO Feng, Liu Qian, let’s go back!” Xia ruofei said.

With that, Xia ruofei strode towards the door of the conference room. Feng Jing and Liu Qian were stunned for a moment. However, Xia ruofei had already said on the way here that he would be in charge of the entire negotiation, so the two of them did not consider the reason for Xia ruofei’s actions. After they regained their senses, they immediately stood up and followed Xia ruofei.

Xu Jiahui and his negotiation team were shocked.

What was going on?

It was less than three minutes from the moment Xia ruofei entered the room to the moment they left. Other than the initial small talk, Xia ruofei’s first sentence was to end the negotiation.

This was completely out of the ordinary!

Xu Jiahui quickly stood up and said,”President Xia, please wait!” If it’s a matter of price, we can still negotiate! Wasn’t this how negotiations were supposed to be? It’s normal for the two sides to have differences ...”
