2857 The tide of attacks (1)

This was Xia ruofei’s third match in La Liga so far. He had scored in the previous two matches, and they were all extremely difficult world waves. Therefore, some people on the internet had already given Xia ruofei the nickname “Mr. World wave”.

Mr. World – Class Bo did not let everyone down today. In just 15 seconds of the game, a violent shot from 37 meters away broke through Herona’s goal.

Before this goal, Xia ruofei’s stopping and picking of the ball were quite light and agile. His shooting movements were even more coherent. It could be said that this goal was a combination of the aesthetics of violence and technique. It made people’s blood boil and they could not help but praise it.

In the PP sports studio in Beijing, the old partners Shen fangjian and Jia Tianning were all excited by the goal.

A moment ago, Shen fangjian was still routinely introducing the starting lineup of both teams. However, he was interrupted after reading two names. The moment Xia ruofei stopped the ball, Shen fangjian shouted,””This is an opportunity! We all know that Xia ruofei’s personal skills and shooting accuracy are outstanding! He picked the ball, turned around, and passed ... Beautiful! It’s very open up ahead ... Wow! Xia ruofei is going to shoot!”

Jia Tianning, who was standing at the side, had completely forgotten the principle that two commentators could not steal each other’s words. At that moment, he couldn’t help but shout out,””Shoot! The ball went in! The ball went in! It had only been ten seconds since the match started, but Xia ruofei had changed the score with a world wave! This is crazy!”

Shen fangjian quickly said,”this is the cooperation of two Chinese players!” Wu Lei made a long pass from the center circle. After Xia ruofei received the ball, he nimbly picked it up and passed the ball. Then, he immediately raised his leg and shot! The football goes straight into the theoretical dead end, and the Herona goalkeeper has no way to deal with it!” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

The camera briefly gave the Spanish players some time to celebrate, and soon the televised broadcast began to replay the goal.

Jia Tianning, as a professional guest, also interpreted the goal for the fans in time,””As we can see, the Spaniards have already shown a strong desire to attack before the game began. They have at least seven players on the halfway line, including Xia ruofei. After the referee whistle was blown, they all pressed forward in unison! It’s precisely because of this offensive attitude that they were given such an opportunity!”

“Wu Lei’s pass was just right! If he were to pass the ball to another player, the force of his kick might be a little too strong. However, he clearly knows Xia ruofei’s speed very well. He passed the ball to Xia ruofei’s most comfortable position!” Jia Tianning was indeed the leader of Wu Chui Hall. It was Wu Lei who had spread the rumors, but he could still make it sound like Wu Lei and Xia ruofei had great chemistry!

Jia Tianning continued,”Xia ruofei stopped the ball, picked the ball, and turned around. This series of actions fully reflected his solid basic skills and unparalleled sense of the ball. It was also this beautiful back – to – back pass that laid the foundation for the next step!” We saw that when Xia ruofei shot, none of the defenders of Herona came up to intercept or interfere. The goalkeeper’s position was also a little forward. They did not prepare enough before the game! I didn’t know Xia ruofei’s shooting range was so far!”

Shen fangjian chuckled and said,”the commander of Herona is probably worried now!” The goal completely disrupted his pre – Game deployment! Now that the team is behind, it’s definitely not going to work to just defend, but the attack must be pressed on, which gives the Spaniards a chance to fight back!”

“Yes, I am!” Jia Tianning said,”Wu Lei and Xia ruofei’s tacit cooperation resulted in this beautiful goal. Of course, Xia ruofei’s personal ability was perfectly displayed. This is also the role of a superstar on a team. They can often rely on their personal ability and their own flash of inspiration to change the outcome of the game when the team is in a difficult situation! Even though Xia ruofei does not participate in many competitions and still lacks the support of data, I still think that if he focuses on football, he will not be worse than those superstars!”

Jia Tianning returned to his “summer bragging” mode, but the fans watching the game didn’t feel any discomfort, and no one in the bullet screen ridiculed Jia Tianning.

The reason was very simple. Xia ruofei’s goal was not to be criticized. No matter how much Jia Tianning bragged at this time, no one could refute it! Even the brainless black Xia was now very wise to hide and not speak.

The bullet screen of PP sports was filled with the word “awesome”. The fans who were watching the game were in a neat formation and all said the word in unison. It was a spectacular sight.

……

In the VIP box at El prate Stadium, Song Wei, Ling Qingxue, and Zhou leiyun subconsciously stood up and cheered the moment Xia ruofei scored the goal.

In fact, although the box had a certain sound – proofing effect, they could still hear the loud cheers of the fans in the stands, and everyone was singing and dancing. They could even feel the box shaking slightly.

After the excitement died down, the three of them looked at each other.

“This ... This should be considered Wei Wei’s win?” Ling Qingxue asked.
