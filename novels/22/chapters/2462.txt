2463 The ambition of a rich man (1)

The other young man in a Givenchy casual suit was stunned for a moment and asked,””Which song family?”

The young man who had spoken earlier laughed and said,””Zhou Yuan, which other song family could it be? Are there two song families in the capital?”

The young man called Zhou Yuan was still confused, he said,””I just don’t think I’ve ever heard of a Weiwei in the song family ... Young master Yun, am I ignorant?”

“You can’t say that,” young master Yun said, pursing his lips.”After all, Song Wei is a little different from the other song family members.”

“Young master Yun, please give me some pointers!” Zhou Yuan quickly said.

Young master Yun raised his chin in Song Wei’s direction and said,””She’s song Qiming’s daughter. Song Qiming can only be considered a distant relative of that old man. Besides, song Qiming isn’t in the capital, so it’s normal that you don’t know her. After all, you don’t have much contact with people in this circle.”

Although young master Yun’s tone was calm, there was still a sense of superiority.

Zhou Yuan was enlightened,”so that’s how it is!.”

Following that, Zhou Yuan could not help but look towards Song Wei’s direction, before whispering,””Young master Yun, this Song Wei is really pretty!”

Young master Yun glanced at Zhou Yuan and asked with a hint of ridicule,””What’s wrong? Are you tempted?” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Zhou Yuan chuckled and said,”at first glance, it’s more to my liking.” Besides, song Qiming’s daughter ... If she really gets married, I’m sure my father won’t object to it. ”

“Zhou Yuan, do you like Song Wei?” young master Yun asked with a half – Smile. Or is it because of her father?”

Zhou Yuan didn’t try to hide it as he smiled and said,””Both! You also know ... I can’t find a girl from an ordinary family. My family won’t be able to get through! This Song Wei is a perfect match for him. If there’s a chance, we can get to know her first!”

“You don’t know about song Qiming?” young master Yun asked indifferently.

Zhou Yuan was stunned for a moment, then he patted his forehead and said,””Now that you remind me, I remember ... Song Qiming got into a traffic accident some time ago. He was seriously injured, right?”

Although the news of song Qiming’s injury was not announced to the public, it was just that it was not widely spread. Those who could attend the opening ceremony today were not simple, and they all had their own channels of information. Zhou Yuan was no exception, it was just that he did not think of this earlier.

Young master Yun smiled faintly and nodded,””Do you still have feelings for Song Wei?”

Zhou Yuan’s expression changed slightly as he asked in a low voice,””Young master Yun, are you saying that song Qiming ... Will be affected by his health?”

“I’m not too sure about that, but song Qiming hasn’t returned to work yet,” young master Yun said.”It’s mainly because she’s been recuperating at home most of the time and acting all mysterious. I don’t think many people know about his situation.”

“You haven’t gone back to work after so long?” The expression on Zhou Yuan’s face changed. It was obvious that he was really tempted, and only at this time would he weigh the pros and cons.

Young master Yun said with a smile,”you’re really thinking that far!” Alright! I’m just saying. If you can really catch up with Song Wei, you’ll definitely have a lot of benefits!”

“What do you mean?” Zhou Yuan asked in confusion,”her father isn ‘t?”

“Although song Qiming has been recuperating, his position hasn’t been replaced,” young master Yun said mysteriously.”This means that his health shouldn’t affect his future work. Also, the higher – ups still think highly of him. Do you understand?”

Zhou Yuan’s mind was suddenly enlightened as he nodded and said,””Young master Yun, you have a profound view of the problem! It must be that way!”

Zhou Yuan could not help but sigh in his heart. In this aspect, he was still not as good as these Playboys who had been influenced by him since young! Even if these people were good – for – nothing, they were very sensitive to political matters. This was something that he could not compare to in any way. It was a congenital deficiency.

Young master Yun seemed to be enjoying Zhou Yuan’s look of admiration, and continued to point out,””Even if song Qiming is no longer a B – list celebrity because of his health, he is still very influential. He is also related to the song family. If you can really get Song Wei, you will definitely make a fortune!”

Zhou Yuan’s eyes brightened as he quickly said,””Young master Yun, you have a lot of connections. Help me create some opportunities!”

“It’s not difficult to introduce you to each other,” young master Yun said.”And as far as I know, Song Wei is currently single. But whether you can get together or not, it’s up to you!”

“Of course! That’s for sure!” Zhou Yuan quickly said,”young master Yun, no matter if it’s a success or not, as long as you can introduce me to him, I’ll always remember this brotherly love! I will definitely repay you in the future!”

A trace of disdain flashed through young master Yun’s eyes, but he concealed it very well.

He still had a faint smile on his face, but he said in his heart,”If your father wasn’t rich, would this brother take you to play? An embroidered pillow!

With young master Yun’s status, ordinary rich people naturally wouldn’t enter his eyes, but this wasn’t absolute. When one was rich to a certain extent, their influence couldn’t be underestimated. These super – rich people couldn’t be treated as pure businessmen.

Zhou Yuan’s family was considered to be rich to a certain extent, and could basically be said to be at the top of China’s Circle of Wealth. It was also because of this that young master Yun had pretended to be a snake with him, but in reality, young master Yun did not think much of this Zhou Yuan.
