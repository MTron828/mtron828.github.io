Translator: 549690339

He was complimenting both Xia ruofei and Feng Jing. Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment before he smiled and said, ” ” That can’t be compared to President Liu. Your wife is the face of the company in kyokuboku! ”

Liu Dong’s wife was many years younger than him. She was the famous campus Belle of Shuimu University and had once been very popular on the internet. She was so beautiful, a top student, and even married a billionaire. She was definitely a natural winner in life!

“Ruofei, don’t forget that President Liu is face-blind. He doesn’t know if his wife is pretty or not ...”Song Rui came over and said.

Everyone burst into laughter, and Liu Dong could not help but smile bitterly.

Liu Dong had once said that he was face-blind in the previous show. He had married such a beautiful wife, but he insisted that he was face-blind because he saw the other party’s kind heart. Wasn’t this the rhythm of attracting hatred? Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Therefore, there were countless jokes about Liu Dong’s face blindness on the internet at that time.

Therefore, song Rui’s teasing words naturally caused everyone to laugh.

After the small talk, Xia ruofei called out, ” “President Feng, please organize everyone to enter the venue!”

Feng Jing came back to her senses and quickly called for the staff to prepare the entrance passes. Xia ruofei personally accompanied song Rui, Zheng bang, and Liu Dong into the venue.

At this time, kyokuboku group’s off-duty employees began to get off the bus. Xia ruofei’s eyes focused on them. He realized that these employees were all wearing the same t-shirt with paradise corporation’s logo printed on it. On the front, there was also a poster of Daphne holding the Jade skin cream.

Feng Rao also noticed it immediately, and she couldn’t help but reveal a pleasantly surprised expression.

Xia ruofei did not know about this. He pointed at the employees and asked, ” “Song Rui, what’s going on? ”

Liu Dong smiled and said, ” President Xia, I arranged it. After young master Zheng told me about this a few days ago, I asked the logistics department to urgently contact the manufacturers to make these advertising jerseys. Not only are our employees wearing them, but there are also many in the cars behind us. I guarantee that everyone in the audience today will have one! ”

Xia ruofei was touched and said, ” ” Boss Liu, you’re so thoughtful. Thank you! Thank you! ”

Liu Dong chuckled.”It’s a piece of cake. The LOGO and poster were downloaded from your company’s official website by our publicity department. The resolution isn’t particularly good, and we’re in a hurry, so we’ll just make do with it!”

“It’s already very good!” Xia ruofei was touched.”Mr. Liu, thank you so much. Come, come, come, this way please!”

Xia ruofei personally led Liu Dong and the others into the stadium. After arranging for them to sit in the front row, he asked Zheng bang to help with Liu Dong. Then, he walked out with song Rui to remind him that kyokuboku entertainment was not the only audience that song Rui helped to organize.

Kyokuboku gaming company’s base camp was in Beijing, but the employees that could be transferred, including the basic – Level courier, plus the relatives and friends they could bring, were only a few thousand people in total. It was definitely not enough to rely on their support alone.

The audience of kyokuboku group was dressed in the same uniform and entered the venue in an orderly manner under the guidance of the staff.

The reporters who were originally whispering in the quiet venue were also attracted by this scene, and they all took out their cameras to take pictures.

As the thousands of people slowly entered the venue, a few areas were immediately filled to the brim. Huang Yu and the others no longer felt that the place was so empty that it was scary.

“See that?” Huang Yu said with a smile. I told you that this company wouldn’t make a mistake of its own! They’ve booked such a big venue, how could they slap their own faces?”

“This can’t be the Internet Water Army hired by the organizer, right?” one of the forum members teased.

Someone immediately retorted,”are the organizers crazy?” Hiring so many fake reviewers to make up the numbers? Why would I? Isn’t it better to just reserve a smaller venue?”

These moneymakers didn’t know that the audience who entered later, in a sense, were really considered fake reviewers, but they weren’t hired by the Paradise Corporation.

Xia ruofei and song Rui chatted as they walked out.

“Great job, young master Song!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you actually managed to invite Liu Dong!”

“Who are you?” Song Rui boasted,”I care more about your matters than my own! Can I not do it for you?”

“There’s still half an empty seat in the audience!” Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”can you fill them up?”

“Hold me responsible if you can’t fill it up!” Song Rui said.

Xia ruofei patted song Rui’s shoulder and said,””My good brother, I didn’t go to Song Wei for your sake in vain!”

Song Rui’s face was full of smiles when he heard that. He asked,””RUO Fei, do you think that girl Song Wei helped me? Why do I feel like Yiyi’s attitude towards me hasn’t changed at all?”

Xia ruofei glanced at song Rui and said,””Little comrade, you can’t eat hot tofu if you’re impatient, you know? Song Wei’s actions were subtle and it took time! Besides, with your carefree personality, even if Zhuo Yiyi had some subtle changes, I don’t think you’d be able to tell ...

Song Rui scratched his head and thought for a while, then smiled.””I really didn’t feel anything ...”

“Alright, alright! Help me finish up the press conference first!” Xia ruofei said,”don’t keep talking about that trivial matter!”

“Fine, fine, fine, you’re the Lord, alright!” Song Rui said.

As the two of them arrived at the entrance, Feng Jing’s worried expression was replaced with high spirits. She personally led the staff to hand out admission passes to the audience who had yet to enter the venue.

Seeing Xia ruofei walk over, Feng Jing put down her work and walked over.””Chairman, you’re so awesome!”

Xia ruofei laughed.”It’s all song Rui’s credit. I just moved my lips!”

“This is just the first wave. There will be more coming in soon!” Song Rui said.

“Many thanks, young master Song!” Feng Rao said sincerely.

“You’re welcome,” song Rui said with a smile.”Just call me song Rui like RUO Fei!”

“Sure!” Feng Rao said with a smile.

Then, Feng Rao said to Xia ruofei,””Chairman, you’ve really given me a surprise today!”

“I’m pretty reliable, aren’t I?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

“He’s reliable! I’ll give you a surprise too!” Feng Rao said with a smile.

“What surprise?” Xia ruofei asked.

“It’s a secret!” Feng Rao said mysteriously.

“Hey! You’re still keeping me in suspense!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”sure! Then I’ll be waiting for your surprise!”

The school’s security guards were also busy guiding the bus. After the bus from kyokuboku group alighted, it was quickly guided to leave from the other side and parked on the nearby roadside.

Soon, more buses arrived.

In a short while, the audience that song Rui had helped to contact came in waves.

Feng Rao couldn’t help but feel overwhelmed. Weiping mall, Huamei mall, Jumei mall ... Even the gold – panning group, the leader of the e – commerce industry with its headquarters in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Province, had sent the boss of the Beijing branch with hundreds of employees to support them.

Many of song Rui’s good – for – nothing friends had also come. Like Zheng bang, their task was to help contact the major e – commerce platforms. Of course, there were also people in charge of the media. Otherwise, Ji Yanwu and the other old reporters would not have been sent to interview such a press conference.

In just a short while, Feng Jing had met more than half of the country’s e – commerce bosses, and her brain was almost numb.

However, she vaguely understood Xia ruofei’s intention. He was not just trying to increase the popularity of the press conference. He was also thinking about the problem of future sales channels!

Feng Rao’s heart burned with passion at the thought of this.

It was almost time for the press conference to start, and the audience was almost all gathered. Feng Jing didn’t linger at the entrance, but instead went backstage to prepare for the press conference.

When they entered the stadium, Feng Jing saw that the seats were almost full, and her heart settled down.

She glanced at Xia ruofei, who was chatting happily with Liu Dong and the other big bosses of e – commerce. A smile appeared on her face, and she walked backstage.
