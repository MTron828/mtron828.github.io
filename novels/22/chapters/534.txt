Chapter 535: The treatment of the rich (3)

As for the Johansson flight crew, they would stay in San Shan city for a night and fly back to United States the next morning.

Of course, shengbang Corporation had a branch company in Sanshan city. Xia ruofei did not have to worry about the arrangement of the flight crew.

When he walked out of the airport, Lei Hu had already driven the Mercedes – Benz and was waiting by the side of the road. He was waiting for Xia ruofei to inform Feng Jing of his schedule before he returned and asked her to arrange for someone to pick him up.

“Brother Xia!” Lei Hu jogged over to take Xia ruofei’s luggage and said,”you’ve had a long journey!” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

He placed the luggage in the trunk and quickly opened the back door for Xia ruofei.

The Mercedes – Benz started moving slowly. Xia ruofei leaned back in his seat and asked,””Hu, is the company doing well these few days?”

“Everything is normal!” Lei Hu said,”director Feng has hired another group of people. The farm is much more lively now!”

“That’s good!” Xia ruofei said and then asked,”Oh right, I asked you to contact your comrades last time. How’s it going?”

“Brother Xia, the four of us and squad leader ye, who’s far away in Mount Wu Yi, have contacted all the comrades we could contact. After they heard us introduce the situation here, there were quite a few people who were interested!” Lei Hu said excitedly,”I’ve made a preliminary count. At least a dozen people have clearly expressed their willingness to come, and there are six or seven more who are also very interested!”

“That’s great!” Xia ruofei said happily.

“Brother Xia, do you think we should hold an interview or something?” Lei Hu asked for instructions,”there seem to be a little too many people ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”as long as you’re a veteran from our Army, especially those from the Special Forces, I’ll take you in as many as you want!” I don’t think it’s too much! Hu, contact your comrades when you get back and tell them to come over as soon as possible!”

Xia ruofei’s farm had expanded by several times, and the winery was starting to generate a steady stream of income. In addition, Fairyland farm in Australia was about to be launched. Soon, his business would usher in a surge of development. Now, it seemed that more than 20 security personnel was a little too much, but he would soon have to worry about recruitment.

In the future, when the business was opened, these high – Quality veterans would become the backbone of the security team. They might even be sent to work abroad!

“Great!” Lei Hu said happily. Thank you, brother Xia!”

Naturally, Lei Hu was more than happy to have so many comrades gathered together. When those comrades came, they could form two standard squad systems. It would even feel like the feeling they had when they were in the Army!

After Xia ruofei chatted with Lei Hu for a while, he took out his phone and sent a WeChat message to Ling Qingxue, telling her that he had landed safely. He then sent a message to Liang Qichao.

In the end, he thought about it and sent Monica a message. The content was simple: Monica, I’m back in China.”

Monica replied very quickly. It was a symbol emoji made up of many symbols, but one could still see at a glance that a small person was standing, and another small person was kneeling in front of him with his head stretched forward ...

Wasn’t this position the same as this morning ... Xia ruofei couldn’t help but shout in his heart,”This little demon!

Then, he hurriedly deleted the message completely and destroyed the evidence. Then, he looked up with a guilty conscience.

Fortunately, Lei Hu was still focused on driving and did not notice his boss’s awkward expression in the back seat.

It was almost eighto’ clock at night when they returned to the farm. Xia ruofei went straight back to the villa.

After a good night’s sleep on the plane, he was very energetic. After taking a shower, he lay on the bed and chatted with Ling Qingxue on the phone for a while.

After hanging up the phone, Xia ruofei still did not feel sleepy.

He simply took out the scroll and entered the stone room in the new space. He drank a small bottle of the spirit Heart Flower petal solution and then sat on the Jade futon again, adjusting his mental power and his entire state to the best.

Then, he left the space in a flash and took out the Supreme – grade sheep – Fat white jade that Lu You had given him.

Xia ruofei had been in Australia for the past few days. Other than having sex with Monica the previous night, he had been using ordinary low – Quality white jade to practice carving the whole rune.

His proficiency had already reached a level that satisfied him, and he felt that he was in a good state today. Therefore, he decided to start the official rune drawing today.

Xia ruofei held the sheep – Fat white jade firmly in his hand. With a flip of his other hand, the carving knife that he had kept in the storage space appeared in his hand.

He took a deep breath and stared at the sheep – Fat white jade with full concentration. He released his mental power and the carving knife in his hand steadily fell ...
