Chapter 1618: Unified thinking (2)

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes!” I agree with big brother Zhao’s opinion. Let’s first discuss a warning value! Once you exceed this warning value, you should stop while you’re ahead!”

Zhao Yongjun pondered for a moment and said,””We estimate that the final price of this piece of land will be around 320 to 330 million. However, Liu haofan and Tang real estate are more aggressive, so I estimate that they will increase the price within 400 million!”

“I also think so, as long as it doesn’t exceed 400 million, it’s basically safe ...” Xu Zi Xuan said.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.”Brother Zhao,” he asked.”What was your price in mind?”

Zhao Yongjun chuckled in embarrassment,””We didn’t estimate the difficulty at the beginning, so we set a psychological price of less than 350 million. Of course, my judgment was that we could basically get it with 330 million, but now it seems ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”since that’s the case, let’s play with their hearts!” Just set it at 400 million. As long as it doesn’t exceed 400 million, we’ll follow to the end! If we really spend it all on our hands, it’ll only be an extra 50 million in expenses, we can still afford it!”

Xu Zixuan and Liu Jian secretly smiled bitterly, thinking that you guys can afford it with your wealth, but we can ‘t! This was especially true for Hou Liang and Wei Jun.

After all, if they really used 400 million to get it, even if they could do certain things within the rules and delay the payment, a capital increase was inevitable. By then, they might not be able to come up with the money. Some of the money in Yingluo’s account was paid by Xia ruofei and Zhao Yong Jun.

Xia ruofei seemed to have seen through Xu Zixuan and the others “thoughts. He smiled and said, “Don’t worry! Since I’m the one who suggested this, I’ll pay for the 50 million if it really ends up in my hands! When the club starts to make a profit, you can return it to me at a certain rate!”

Since Xia ruofei had already said this, Xu Zixuan and Liu Jian naturally wouldn’t disagree. As for Hou Liang and Wei Jun, who weren’t in the car, they were both their underlings, so they had no choice but to agree.

However, Zhao Yongjun and song Rui were loyal. They said that if there was a problem, they would bear the extra part of the money. Just like Xia ruofei, they would each pay one – third of the money.

The bidding strategy was decided just like that.

No one knew that Xia ruofei’s radical suggestion was not just because he wanted to avenge song Rui.

He had taken a casual glance before he left in the car and discovered that there was something special about this land. Based on his discovery, even if he really bought it for 400 million, he would definitely not lose out.

Of course, if Liu haofan were to bid for it at a higher price, Xia ruofei would not care about Jian Jia. He was already confident that the land would be theirs in the end.

This round trip took almost the entire morning. After some discussion, they decided to go to Xia ruofei’s courtyard house for lunch. Hence, Xia ruofei called Wu Qiang in the car and asked him to make arrangements in advance.

The car returned to the courtyard in liuhai Lane. Zhao Yongjun told Hou Liang and Wei Jun about what they had discussed in the car.

When they heard that the brothers had already made their decision and that Xia ruofei and the others would pay for it even if they had to spend more money, Hou Liang and Wei Jun naturally had no objections.

The group of them had lunch together in Xia ruofei’s courtyard house. After making an appointment to attend the land bidding together the day after tomorrow, they went their separate ways.

Xia ruofei returned to the second courtyard alone and prepared to rest for a while.

He had just laid down on the bed when he received a call from Song Wei.

“Ruofei, is it convenient on your side now?” Song Wei asked,”I wanted to come and look for you ...”

Xia ruofei understood. After a moment of silence, he said,””I don’t have much to do in the afternoon, but I need to go out at night. Where are you? Do you want me to get Wu Qiang to pick you up?”

Xia ruofei knew that Song Wei wanted to cultivate with him. In fact, he wanted to help Song Wei solve the hidden danger of the peach blossom miasma as soon as possible. However, since he was in the capital, he had to visit the elders.

General Zhao Cheng and Tian Huilan were not in a hurry, but elder song could not be delayed. After all, song Rui knew that he had come to the capital. It was reasonable for him to visit elder song immediately.

Hence, Xia ruofei had already contacted elder song’s Secretary, manager Lu, before lunch.

Elder song was very happy to know that Xia ruofei was going to visit him. He immediately invited Xia ruofei to the song family’s old house for dinner.

“I’m at school right now. I just finished some stuff this morning and I’m free in the afternoon ... Ruofei, I can take a taxi here. You don’t have to send someone to pick me up,” Song Wei said.

“I’ll let Wu Qiang pick you up!” Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”wait for me at the East Gate of the school in about twenty minutes. It’s decided then!”

With that, Xia ruofei hung up the phone.

Xia ruofei’s siheyuan and Capital University were located in the downtown area of the capital city. From here, they had to take the West Second Ring Road and then the North Fifth Ring Road. The whole journey was only 13 or 14 kilometers. As long as there was no particularly heavy traffic, they would definitely be able to reach within half an hour.

Xia ruofei gave Wu Qiang a call and asked him to drive to Capital University to pick up Song Wei. He also gave Wu Qiang her phone number.

Since Song Wei was coming, Xia ruofei did not rest.

He got up and went to the courtyard. He sat down at the stone table under the grape trellis and began to boil water to make tea, enjoying the leisure time of the afternoon.

After about an hour, Wu Qiang led Song Wei to the second courtyard.

“Boss, miss song is here.” Wu Qiang said as he bowed slightly.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded at Song Wei. He then said to Wu Qiang, “You’ve worked hard, go back to your room and rest! I’ll take care of this side myself. ”

Wu Qiang was also very tactful and immediately said,”Okay, boss! If there’s anything you need, just call me!”

Wu Qiang was also expressing to Xia ruofei that if there was nothing important, he would definitely not come to the courtyard to disturb them.

After all, this was his boss’s private living space, and he was serving a beauty like Song Wei.

In fact, even if Xia ruofei had not come to the capital, Wu Qiang had always followed the rules.

He had insisted on staying in the relatively small room in the backyard even though it was such a big yard. Besides cleaning up, he had never come to the second yard even when Xia ruofei was not at home.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. After Wu Qiang left, he waved to Song Wei and said,””Do you want to come over and have some tea?”

“Let’s hurry up and cultivate!”Song Wei said. After all ...”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”hurry ...”

“No!” “I knew you’d say that every time!” Song Wei said coyly.

Xia ruofei touched his nose and said,”sure!” You even know how to answer first!”

“We’re running out of time, aren’t we?”Song Wei stomped her feet and said. It’s already past oneo’ clock, and you still have to go out at night to do things. We don’t have much time left! Let’s hurry up and get down to business!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but break out in a cold sweat. There didn’t seem to be anything wrong with what he said, but why did it sound so ambiguous?

Song Wei also realized that her words were ambiguous. Her face became slightly hot and she said, “Don’t get the wrong idea ...”

Xia ruofei quickly replied,”no, no!” Absolutely not! Come on! Since you’re in a hurry to cultivate, let’s enter the house ...”

Xia ruofei put down his teacup and walked into the spacious master bedroom.

Song Wei chuckled and followed behind Xia ruofei. After the two entered the room, Xia ruofei locked the door.

Although she knew that Xia ruofei was doing it for safety, Song Wei could not help but blush and her heart beat faster ...
