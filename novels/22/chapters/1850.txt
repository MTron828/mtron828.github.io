Li Yifu immediately asked,”great uncle – Master, may I ask if you have any other requirements for the configuration and interior of this plane?” Gulfstream’s Account Manager has also come to San Shan at random this time. We can let them make changes according to your needs at any time. ”

Xia ruofei shrugged.”I don’t have high expectations in this aspect. I feel that it’s pretty good now!”

Then, he turned to Ling Qingxue and asked,””Qingxue, what about you? If there’s anything you need, just tell me!”

Ling Qingxue chuckled.”What request could I have? this plane is all top notch. The interior feels pretty good too. It’s going to be troublesome to make changes here and there ...”

“That’s it then!”Xia ruofei nodded.

“Alright, martial granduncle!” Li Yifu quickly replied. I’ll go and handle the procedures immediately. It might take about a week! But during this period, if you need to use an airplane, there’s no problem!”

This plane was still under the Kyushu group’s name, and the ownership would be changed to Xia ruofei ‘s. It involved cross – border transactions, and there were many procedures, including customs declaration, tax payment, and so on. It was already quite fast to complete it in a week.

Li Yifu thought for a moment and said,”by the way, Grand – martial uncle, I suggest that the ownership of this plane is still under the name of your paradise Corporation. It can be considered as a purchase under the company’s name. This way, you can also get a tax discount.” Of course, if your company’s equity structure ...”

“Then put it under the company’s name!” Xia ruofei said, waving his hand.

Li Yifu only had to remind Xia ruofei a little and he understood. If this plane was bought by the Paradise Corporation, the money used to buy the plane would be considered an expense of the company. This would allow a portion of the tax to be refunded. Of course, there would be a certain amount of money needed to be used for the purchase of the plane, and Li Yifu would naturally take care of it.

This was a reasonable way to avoid taxes. Xia ruofei naturally would not reject it.

As for the equity structure, Xia ruofei owned almost all of paradise Corporation, except for Feng Jing who had a small share. Naturally, Xia ruofei would not be stingy with Feng Jing’s money.

“Alright!” Li Yifu immediately replied. Martial granduncle, then leave the rest to this disciple!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”you’re very thoughtful.”

“Oh right, how did you arrange the flight crew?” he asked.

Li Yifu replied,”Grand – martial uncle, they’re considered employees of our Kyushu group’s Southeast Branch. The company has provided them with long – term accommodation in the three mountains. This team is at your service. They can be on call at any time.”

Xia ruofei frowned.”I only fly a few times a year. Isn’t this a bit of a waste?” he said.

The annual salary of two experienced pilots and three air stewardesses working in a private business plane was not a small amount. In addition, they had to provide accommodation for them. Most importantly, the wastage of resources was too serious, which meant that the team was idle most of the time and had nothing to do.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”isn’t there a private jet company now?” “They can provide a plane management service, and when there’s a need for use, the company will send pilots and air Service personnel, and charge by the time ...”

“Martial granduncle, I’m not at ease to use the pilots from these companies,” said Li Yifu quickly. Your safety is the most important. It won’t cost much to raise such a team, so you don’t have to worry about it!”

In fact, buying an aircraft was just the beginning of the expenses. After the aircraft was delivered, the aircraft owner would have a lot of expenses every day. Even if the aircraft was parked at the airport without moving, the salary of the flight crew, space rent, maintenance fees, and so on were not what ordinary people could afford.

There was a very heart – wrenching saying,”even if a rich person gave you a plane, you would definitely not be able to afford it.”

Of course, Xia ruofei did not have such a problem. One reason was that he could definitely afford it. Another reason was that he did not actually need to do so. Li Yifu would pay for all the expenses.

Xia ruofei thought that since he had already accepted the plane, he didn’t care about the millions of team fees every year. So, he didn’t dwell on this issue and nodded.”Alright! I’ll follow your arrangements!”

“Yes, martial granduncle!” Li Yifu was overjoyed. He then asked,””Grand uncle – Master, do you want to ask them to apply for a temporary flight route so that you and Grand aunt can try out this plane?”

Xia ruofei looked at Ling Qingxue and asked,””Qingxue, what do you think?”

Ling Qingxue was a little moved when she heard that. She asked,””Wouldn’t it be too much trouble? I heard it’s quite complicated to apply for a flight route ...”

“No, no!” Li Yifu quickly replied. Actually, I’ve already reported it in advance. As long as you apply, it will definitely be approved within half an hour!”

Li Yifu was very meticulous. Before he came, he had already considered letting Xia ruofei try out the plane himself. Hence, he had asked the crew to apply for a temporary route. In fact, it was just a take – off and landing. Of course, after the take – off, it would circle the sky above Donghai.

The flight route had already been reported, and he could apply for it directly when needed. In addition, he had also made use of his connections in advance, so he could naturally approve it very quickly.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and nodded.”In that case, let’s take a flight!”

Li Yifu was overjoyed and immediately took out his mobile phone to call the flight crew waiting on the tarmac.
