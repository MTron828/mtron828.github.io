Chapter 80: The shocking spirit TuTh1

Xia ruofei walked along the bustling antique Street. Soon, they arrived at the entrance of Lingyu house. Originally, Xia ruofei did not plan to buy raw stones from Lingyu house. After all, there were a few other shops that sold raw jadeite stones in the antique Street. However, when he saw a sign that read “new batch of dragon’s cave high – Quality raw stones” hanging in the small shop of spirit Jade house, he immediately changed his mind and decided to try his luck at spirit Jade house. After all, the possibility of high – Quality Jade in the new raw stones was higher than the raw stones that had been selected by countless customers. Xia ruofei muttered to himself and walked into Lingyu house. “Hello, Mr. Xia! Are you here to buy jade again?” A surprised voice was heard. Xia ruofei took a closer look and realized that it was the waitress who had served him before. He smiled and nodded at her. “Is boss Chen here?” Xia ruofei asked. “It’s here! Please have a cup of tea here and wait a moment, I’ll go in and call the boss!” The waiter said enthusiastically. “Alright, thank you for your trouble.” Xia ruofei said with a smile. After sitting in the reception area for a while, Xia ruofei saw boss Chen, who was wearing a dark blue tang suit, walk out with a big smile on his face. Boss Chen seemed to have a special preference for Tang suits. “Brother Xia!” Boss Chen extended his hand to Xia ruofei enthusiastically. Xia ruofei shook his hand and said,””Boss Chen, sorry to disturb you again!” “Where? I can’t even thank you enough for taking care of my business, brother Xia!” Boss Chen said heartily,”how is it? Are you here to buy jade again?” Xia ruofei smiled and nodded,”I just happened to be doing something nearby, so I came to buy some Jade.” This time, it’s still about three hundred thousand Yuan! It’ll be fine as long as the quality is similar to the last time!” “No problem! I just went to Myanmar a few days ago and bought a batch of Jade. The quality is quite good. ” Boss Chen said,”I’ll get someone to prepare it immediately!” “Thank you for your trouble!” Xia ruofei said,”by the way, boss Chen, I just saw a sign at the door. Did your shop just bring in a new raw stone?” “Yeah!” Boss Chen laughed. The main purpose of this trip to Myanmar was to bring in raw stones and buy some Jade. The quality of this batch of raw stones was not bad. They were from dragon’s cave. Why? Brother Xia, are you interested in joining us for some fun?” “I know nothing about stone gambling!” Xia ruofei replied noncommittally. “What does it matter?” Boss Chen said with a smile,”no matter how knowledgeable a person is, he can’t compete with heaven – defying luck! Brother Xia, your luck last time was really amazing!” “Then ... Let’s get two pieces for fun?” Xia ruofei said, pretending to be moved. “Of course! One look and I know that brother Xia is a man of great destiny! Who knows, we might be able to get a huge increase in the price!” Boss Chen said. “Alright then! Anyway, you guys still need some time to prepare the Jade, so you’re free anyway!” Xia ruofei said,”then go and choose two pieces to play with! I hope boss Chen has good words for me!” “Hahaha! I wish brother Xia a Swift victory!” Boss Chen laughed heartily and said,”let’s go, let’s go together!” Boss Chen personally brought Xia ruofei to the shop next door. It was noon, so there were not many people in the store. There were only two or three people picking raw stones. They all greeted boss Chen when they saw him, and boss Chen responded with a smile. Then, he turned to Xia ruofei and said,”brother Xia, all the new raw stones are here. There’s a price on each of them. You can choose whatever you want.” If you choose it, I’ll give you a 10% discount!” “Hahaha! There was even a discount! Then I won’t be polite! “Pick a few more pieces later ...” Xia ruofei said with a smile. Then, he began to choose the raw stones. Boss Chen knew that customers usually did not want to be disturbed when they were Choosing Raw stones, so he did not go over, but walked to the side and sat down. The store was filled with rows of shelves, on which raw stones of different sizes were arranged. A price tag was placed next to each raw stone, and the price was marked according to the performance of the raw stone. It ranged from a few thousand to a few million. Xia ruofei walked through the shelves, seemingly choosing randomly. He looked at the raw stones very quickly, and after a rough glance, he moved on to the next raw stone. At first, the few customers were secretly paying attention to Xia ruofei. After all, he was personally accompanied by boss Chen. However, when they saw Xia ruofei’s stance, they couldn’t help but laugh in their hearts. So he was a rookie! He should be the kind of person who was stupid but had a lot of money! Otherwise, why would old Chen personally accompany him here? This was because people who played stone gambling all year round would be very careful when choosing Raw stones, especially when they encountered raw stones with good appearance. They would carefully observe every detail and look at it over and over again. If the window was open, they would have used a strong flashlight to get closer and take a closer look. People like Xia ruofei, who only knew how to do things on a cursory basis, were clearly amateurs! However, these people, including boss Chen, did not notice that Xia ruofei seemed to touch every raw stone casually when he passed by. Of course, with Xia ruofei’s skills that he had trained in the Special Forces and the layers of shelves, it was easy for people not to notice the abnormality. Xia ruofei had even clearly observed the positions of the few cameras in the store. Along the way, Xia ruofei had checked more than half of the raw gemstones. Every time there was Jade in the raw stone, the spirit map scroll hidden in his pocket would react. Based on the vibration of the painting, Xia ruofei could roughly determine the value of the raw stone. So far, Xia ruofei had not made any surprising discoveries. In fact, most of the raw stones couldn’t make the spirit map scroll react at all, which meant that these raw stones were just stones without any Jade. No wonder so many people went bankrupt from stone gambling! Xia ruofei mumbled in his heart that the most expensive one among the raw stones in Xuanji that had no chance of producing Jade was priced at more than a million Yuan! There were only about ten raw gemstones that could make the spirit map scroll shake, but Xia ruofei did not want any of them. Some of the paintings did not have much of a reaction, and the Jade in the raw stones was not worth much money. Of course, this was relative to Xia ruofei’s needs. If it was an ordinary customer who was lucky enough to pick these raw stones, they could still make a small profit. Only a raw stone could cause a spirit painting to have a strong reaction. Xia ruofei estimated that the value of the Jade inside was at least two million. Unfortunately, the price of this huge raw stone had also reached 2.2 million. In other words, even if Xia ruofei had the money to buy it, he would only make a small profit. This was not the result Xia ruofei wanted. Xia ruofei sighed and looked at the shelf on the other side. He could only hope that he could find the raw stones he wanted there. He strode to the other side of the shelf. Just as he passed by a pile of raw stones scattered in the corner of the shop, the spirit painting scroll in his arms suddenly vibrated! Xia ruofei was stunned. He had not touched any of the raw gemstones, but the spirit painting scroll was vibrating on its own. What was going on? There had never been a situation where the origin stone spirit map had trembled on its own before he had even touched it. He quickly observed his surroundings and found that no one was paying attention to him. Then, he turned his gaze to the most “suspicious” pile of unremarkable raw gemstones ...Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))
