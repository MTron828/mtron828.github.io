2030 Treasure hunt (2)

Rousey also looked around the room with interest.

This was the most luxurious building in the manor. The first floor was a tall Hall that was very spacious. The various furnishings were also quite luxurious. There were beautiful sculptures, expensive oil paintings, and shiny crystal lamps ... It was really not an easy task to find the treasure room in such a place.

Furthermore, this was just what Xia ruofei said. It was very likely that there was no treasure room here.

However, Rousey treated it as an interesting game. He carefully observed everything in the room and analyzed where the treasure room would be located if there was really a treasure room.

It must be the most unexpected position. It might be right under everyone’s eyes, but it was a position that was very easy to ignore.

Seeing Rossi’s serious look, lui hai and the others couldn’t help but be interested and joined the game.

“Sir, I think it might be behind that bookshelf!” “This is obviously a living room,” Rousey said.”It doesn’t make sense to place a bookshelf a few meters high on the entire wall here ...”

Lu zhengfeng, who was good at English, immediately retorted, “It’s definitely not such an obviously unreasonable place. Otherwise, wouldn’t it be easily discovered?”

“Where do you think it will be?” Rousey asked, somewhat unconvinced.

After looking at it for a long time, he felt that the bookshelf was the most likely. As for the other places, it was difficult to set up a treasure room.

“Maybe it’s inside this wall!” Lu zhengfeng said,”but this needs to be measured inside and outside the house to see how big the difference is. If it’s big, it means that there’s a hidden space!”

Lui hai knocked on the wall and said,””It’s solid, so it’s not possible! I think if there really is a treasure room, it might be underground, or ... In these pillars? I keep feeling that these pillars are too thick, and they don’t seem to match ...”

Hearing the discussion of lui hai and the others, old Geerman curled his lips, and then he immediately became depressed again.

Xia ruofei also saw the disdain on old Gelman’s face. He smiled and said,””Everyone’s imagination is pretty big!”

Lui hai laughed,”anyway, my brothers are still cleaning up. We’re free anyway.” Right, you were the one who suggested it, you haven’t even guessed it!”

Everyone’s eyes were on Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei smiled.”Just now, everyone had put forward a lot of good ideas. Their train of thought is very broad. Actually, what everyone said was ...”

Just when everyone thought that Xia ruofei was going to say “it makes sense”, he suddenly changed the topic and said,””It’s all wrong!”

After saying that, Xia ruofei looked at the speechless lui hai, lui zhengfeng and the others, and asked with a smile,””You guys must really want to know the reason, right?”

Lu zhengfeng and the others nodded repeatedly.

Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”the reason is simple!” Because there’s no treasure room in this room ...”

“Tsk ...” Even Lu zhengfeng, who admired Xia ruofei to the extreme, could not help but have the urge to give him the middle finger after hearing this.

Even old Gehrman, who had been playing dead, could not help but open his eyes and look at Xia ruofei with a strange expression.

Xia ruofei cleared his throat and smiled.””Everyone, would you like to take a look at Mr. Gelman’s treasure room? Then follow me!”

“Is there really a treasure room?”

“Is he really not in this room?”

Lui hai and the others couldn’t help but ask curiously.

Xia ruofei glanced at old Gelman and said,””Although the Gelman family hasn’t been in Turin for long, they are still a well – known Mafia family in southern Italy. How could they not have some family background? Am I right? Mr. Gelman?”

Old Gelman snorted and closed his eyes again.

Xia ruofei was not offended. He laughed and said,”Those who want to see the treasure room, follow me! Right, zhengfeng, bring Mr. Gelman over too!”

With that, Xia ruofei took the lead.

After passing through the luxurious Hall, there were rooms on the side. One of them was old Gehrman’s study. Xia ruofei led lui hai and the others into the room. Monica pushed the wheelchair into the study with Rossi. The brothers of the Hong sect pushed old Gehrman into the room as well.

Old Gehrman couldn’t help but sneer when he saw Xia ruofei bring everyone into the study.

There was indeed a secret room in this Manor, and it was not in the hall just now. However, the entrance was not in this study either.

When old Gehrman saw Xia ruofei’s confident look, he thought that Xia ruofei was really resourceful enough to find such a hidden secret room! Now, it seemed like he was just bluffing.

Even if he had to die, he didn’t want his family’s treasures to be taken away by these Chinese.

Although many people had entered, the study was very spacious and did not seem crowded.

Lu zhengfeng looked at the furnishings of the study with great curiosity and asked,””Sir, is there really a treasure room here?”

“You’ll have to ask Mr. Gelman,”Xia ruofei said with a smile.

After that, Xia ruofei smiled at old Gelman and said,””Mr. Gelman, why don’t you open the treasure room yourself and let us broaden our horizons? Maybe if I’m in a good mood, I’ll let you Live!”

Old Gehrman naturally did not believe Xia ruofei’s nonsense. He said sarcastically,””There’s no treasure room here, stop daydreaming!”

“It seems like Mr. Gelman isn’t being honest!” Xia ruofei shrugged.

Xia ruofei pointed to a bookshelf on one of the walls and said,””Zhengfeng, two of you go and push these two bookshelves away!”

“Alright!” Lu zhengfeng was eager to give it a try. He personally led a brother of the Hong sect up. Each of them was responsible for one bookshelf and pushed it hard to the sides. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Stop! Stop! Stop!” Xia ruofei shouted.

“What’s wrong?” Puzzled, Lu zhengfeng asked,”didn’t you ask us to push it away?”

Xia ruofei walked over and said,”I forgot to tell you. It’s very difficult to push open such a heavy bookshelf with brute force!”

After saying this, he walked to one of the bookshelves and found the fifth and eighth book among the beautiful books. Then he pressed on the upper part of the book and pulled it out in half.

Then, Xia ruofei walked to another bookshelf and took out half of the 11th book on the third row.

There seemed to be no pattern at all. He only did two simple actions. Then, Xia ruofei said,””That’s enough, you can start pushing now!”

“What?” old Gehrman laughed when he saw this.”Deliberately mystifying!”

He was speaking in Italian so Xia ruofei could not understand. He could not help but ask Monica,””What did he just say?”

Monica pursed her lips and smiled.”This is an Italy slang. It means that you are deliberately doing something unfathomable to make people think that you are very profound. That’s what it means.”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.”It seems like Mr. Gelman won’t shed tears until he sees the coffin!”

Then, Xia ruofei said to Lu zhengfeng,””What are you doing? Do your work!”

“Oh!” Lu zhengfeng said.

To everyone’s surprise, this time Lu zhengfeng and the brother of the Hong sect easily pushed the heavy bookshelf to the sides until it touched the two walls, revealing a gap of more than one meter wide in the middle.

But behind the bookshelf was an ordinary wall. Lui hai even knocked on it out of curiosity. The sound was muffled. Apparently, the wall was solid.

Everyone’s expressions were a little strange. Yingluo, did Mr. Xia make a mistake?

Only old Gehrman had a sneer on his face, as if he already knew this would be the result.

Xia ruofei’s expression remained the same. He strolled to the corner of the room and pulled down a brass lamp.

Suddenly, the sound of hinges could be heard. On the wall behind the bookshelf, about two meters high, the bricks slowly sank down, revealing a dark entrance.

“It really is a different world!”

“Godly! You can even discover this!”

“This is unbelievable ...”

Lui hai and the others all gasped and couldn’t help exclaiming.

Old Geerman looked like he had seen a ghost.

Was there really a secret room here? Why didn’t I know about it? What was going on?

He had always thought that Xia ruofei was bluffing, just like how Xia ruofei had always thought that he would not give up until he saw the Yellow River.

What old Gelman did not expect was that Xia ruofei would actually find the entrance to a secret room in this study!

At that moment, old Gehrman was starting to doubt his life.
