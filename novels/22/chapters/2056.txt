2057 “Pretty boy”_3

“You know nothing!” Li Yifu scolded him,”who told you that Monica is Mr. Xia’s woman? Just do your own things, don’t think about these gossips all day!”

Although lui hai couldn’t figure it out, Li Yifu’s words were the Golden Rule. Since the old man had spoken, lui hai naturally didn’t dare to disobey, so he immediately said,””I understand! Don’t worry, uncle, I’ll call the two boys right now ...”

“En!” Li Yifu nodded. He thought for a while and said,”Mr. Xia ruofei’s status is even more distinguished. You can understand it as ... Mr. Xia can only be considered his subordinate! So ... Hurry up and call those two kids, don’t be stupid enough to offend the noble!”

Li Yifu knew very well that the Xia Tian from before was just Xia ruofei changing his appearance. In this sense, Xia ruofei’s “real” identity was naturally more honorable than his previous identity that he had hidden.

Not only did Xia ruofei use the identity of “Xia Tian” to solve Monica’s problem, but he also used his original identity to rush to Italy to meet Monica. It could be seen that Monica was very important to Xia ruofei.

In Li Yifu’s heart, the Grao family became even more important. He had decided that when Xia ruofei returned, he would ask lui hai to increase the support and protection for the Grao family, because the head of the Grao family might be his other “master’s grandmother”.

Lui hai heard that. He was so scared that his soul almost flew out of his body. In his opinion,’Xia Tian’ was already a God – like figure. He did not expect that the ‘pretty boy’ that Monica brought back had an even more distinguished identity. This was simply beyond his understanding.

He came back to his senses and quickly said,”uncle Yi, I know!” Then I won’t talk to you anymore, I’ll call Hua immediately!”

Lui hai respectfully said goodbye to Li Yifu and then immediately called Hua. After being scolded by Li Yifu, he naturally wouldn’t be polite to Hua either, scolding him directly in the face. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

After that, lui hai asked Hua to respect Xia ruofei, even more than “Xia Tian”.

Although he did not tell Ah Hua everything Li Yifu had said, he made it clear that Xia ruofei’s status was even higher than Mr. Xia ‘s, and Li Yifu had personally confirmed it.

After the phone call, lui hai stopped what he was doing and called several guards to drive to Turin from Milan.

After answering the phone, Hua was stunned for a long time, then he conveyed lui Hai’s order to Yong.

The two of them looked at each other in dismay. After a long while, they both showed a look of fear. When Xia ruofei entered the room, they did not hide their hostility. Fortunately, they did not say anything too extreme. In general, their attitude was a little cold, but it was not completely irreparable.

That was why the scene in the restaurant had happened.

As Xia ruofei ate, he looked at ah Yong and Ah Hua, who were acting unnaturally. He had already understood what was going on.

After dinner, Xia ruofei walked past Hua and whispered,””Tell your boss not to come to the Grasso family. Also ... Act naturally in front of Monica. I’m Xia ruofei, who just came to Italy from China. I don’t know you guys, nor do I have any relationship with you. Understand?”

Those who could be trusted by lui hai were not idiots. Hua understood Xia ruofei’s meaning at once and said,””I understand! Don’t worry, Sir, we’ll definitely follow your instructions!”

Xia ruofei nodded and turned to smile at Monica.”Monica, it’s not too late yet. Take me to see your brother! I want to treat him as soon as possible. “
