Gao Jun was humbly giving way to Xia ruofei, wanting to let him sit in the main seat. When he heard the voice, he quickly looked up.

When he saw that the person was actually song Rui, he was surprised and happy. At the same time, he quickly walked out to welcome him.

“Young master Song! Please come in! Please come in!” Gao Jun said enthusiastically.

Song Rui nodded casually at Gao Jun and walked past him to tease the Deputy Director of the provincial station. He was indeed not interested in communicating with him.

Song Rui said as he walked,”ruofei, you’re not being kind!” He actually didn’t wait for me and went to the table first!”

Xia ruofei pouted.”Please look at your watch. What time is it now?” he asked.

The young man next to song Rui showed an embarrassed expression and said,””President Xia, I’m sorry for the delay, and then ... There was a traffic jam on the road. I’m really sorry!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I was just joking with song Rui!” We’re used to bickering when we meet, and we don’t mean to blame you. ”

Xia ruofei continued,”this must be young master Li!” I’ll have to trouble you with the car!”

The young man quickly said,”I don’t dare to accept it!” President Xia, you can call me Xiao si! That’s what brother Rui and the others call him!”

Song Rui also laughed and said,””Yes, ruofei! I’ve almost forgotten this guy’s full name ... Xiao si, what’s your name again?”

The young man looked helpless and said,””Li Zhe ...”

“Yes, yes, yes! Li Zhe!” Song Rui smiled and said,”but this name doesn’t sound good. Li Xiaosi is more comfortable!”

Li Zhe smiled and said,”you can call me whatever you like, brother Rui!” Calling me Xiao si is even more intimate!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”sure!” Then I’ll also call you Xiao si!”

“Alright!” Li Zhe said happily.

Xia ruofei saw that Gao Jun was a little embarrassed, so he said,””Oh right, let me introduce you. This is xiangnan TV’s Deputy Director Gao Jun. He’s the host tonight ...”

“Nice to meet you! ‘Nice to meet you!’ Young master Song, young master Li, please take a seat!” Gao Jun said politely.

However, he was in a difficult position. If song Rui hadn’t come, he would have tried his best to let Xia ruofei sit in the main seat. Now that song Rui was here, he was not sure.

Gao Jun didn’t know who should sit in the main seat between song Rui and Xia ruofei. If there was a mistake, it would turn out to be a bad thing. If he was narrow – minded, he might even hold a grudge against Gao Jun.

Xia ruofei knew what was going on. He laughed and said,””President Gao, don’t shirk away anymore. Isn’t the main seat the main seat? You’re the host today, so you’ll definitely take this position! Are you hoping that we’ll pay the bill?”

“Well ...” Gao Jun hesitated for a moment and said,”alright!” We’ll listen to President Xia!”

After he finished speaking, he took the lead and walked to the main seat in the middle. Xia ruofei and the others naturally sat down at will.

Xia ruofei sat between song Rui and Gao Jun. Further to the side was Huang Yajuan, and then Li Zhe. Hou Liang sat on the other side of Gao Jun. Beside him was Huang Yajuan’s assistant, Luo Xue. Further out were Qin Yanan and he Yu.

Gao Jun also intentionally let everyone sit in a row so that it would be more convenient to make a toast and adjust the atmosphere at the table.

After everyone had taken their seats, the waiter quickly began to serve the dishes.

After a few hot dishes were served, Xia ruofei smiled and suggested for Gao Jun to make the opening remarks.

He paid more attention to Gao Jun’s feelings. After all, Gao Jun was the host today, and with so many top – notch nouveau riche who usually didn’t have a say in the business, Gao Jun was inevitably a little nervous.

Gao Jun declined and stood up with a glass of wine in his hand, saying,””I’m very honored today that President Xia accepted the invitation and brought along good friends like young master Song, young master hou, and young master Li. It’s fate that brought us together. Let’s have a drink together!”

If Gao Jun really wanted to let loose, he could even hold a glass of wine and talk for an hour or two. Improvising on the spot was also a basic skill for leading cadres. However, he also knew that in this kind of occasion, he could not say those official pleasantries, otherwise, he would be despised by others for no reason, so he was also concise and comprehensive.

Xia ruofei was the first to respond. Everyone raised their glasses and took a sip. The dinner party officially started.

Although it was a dinner organized by Gao Jun in name, Xia ruofei was the center of attention.

Not only did Gao Jun frequently toast Xia ruofei, but song Rui, Hou Liang, Li Zhe, and the others also came to toast and talk from time to time.

However, Xia ruofei was also very careful. He often chatted with Gao Jun beside him so that he would not be left out.

Gao Jun was very grateful and felt that Xia ruofei was a very loyal person. Of course, he also took this opportunity to toast Hou Liang and subtly express his wish to report to Hou Liang’s father when he was free.

Hou Liang’s heart was naturally as clear as a mirror. Although he didn’t overstep his boundaries and agree on behalf of his father, he still said some words of encouragement and said that he would pass on the message to his father when the time was right. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Gao Jun was overjoyed.

In fact, Gao Jun was a very capable person. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been able to manage xiangnan TV’s most important entertainment business so well. Over the years, he had been in charge of the entertainment section, and xiangnan TV’s revenue had also been booming. On top of its already strong foundation, it had made even more progress.
