  Xia ruofei nodded."It's definitely from our own tea mountain. It's handmade. There's no nice packaging, but it tastes good!"

  "Well ..." Luo gang hesitated for a moment and said,"it's nothing, but you don't have to be so polite ..."

  Luo gang felt that the tea leaves that he made should not be worth much. He was just a simple man, but he was not pedantic or ignorant of the ways of the world. Xia ruofei had sincerely expressed his gratitude, so it would be inappropriate for him to keep him at a distance.

  "I should! I should!" Xia ruofei smiled and said,"and the tea leaves are in the car. Please wait a moment!"

  Xia ruofei then led Chen Xuan and the rest out of the small courtyard. They walked to the parking lot not far away and took out a bag of Da Hong Pao tea leaves that Xia Qing had personally made and grown in the spirit map space. He asked Chen Xuan and the rest to wait in the parking lot while he and Song Wei walked back.

  Xia ruofei did not lie. These tea leaves were his family's property and were handmade.

  However, these tea leaves were cut from the mother tree, Da Hong Pao, which had already stopped harvesting. Hence, Xia ruofei's tea leaves should be the most authentic Da Hong Pao tea leaves now.

  In addition to the environment of the spirit map space and Xia Qing's tea - making skills, it could be said that Xia ruofei's bag of tea leaves was much better than the Taoyuan Dahongpao that was sold on the market for thousands of Yuan per catty.

  In terms of value, this packet of tea leaves was much more valuable than the cash in the envelope.

  In the small courtyard, Luo gang saw the tea leaves in a paper bag that Xia ruofei had brought over. He finally confirmed that these were not high - end tea leaves that could be found on the market and happily accepted them.

  After Xia ruofei and Song Wei expressed their gratitude to Luo gang again, they left the courtyard and returned to the parking lot.

  The morning rush hour was almost over. It took them about 20 minutes to return to the courtyard in liuhai Lane.

  The relic restoration team's high - definition scanning equipment was specially customized. A high - resolution professional camera was fixed on it. It moved slowly and steadily on the guide rail and could clearly scan the relic. Even if it was magnified a hundred times, it would still be extremely clear. It could be said that it was detailed.

  Everyone came to the East Room. Luo gang skillfully turned on the power supply of the equipment and the computer. After some simple debugging, he nodded at Song Wei and said, "It's ready. If you want to scan anything, just leave it to me. "

  Chen Xuan turned to look at Xia ruofei. Seeing Xia ruofei nod his head, he passed the token to Luo gang.

  Everyone in the room was a cultivator. Naturally, no one was worried about what Luo gang, an ordinary person, could do.

  Luo gang fixed the token on the table, then operated the equipment while smiling and said,""According to little song's request, I've adjusted it to the highest resolution. I guarantee that the scan will be extremely clear, and every detail will be perfectly preserved!"

  "Thank you, teacher Luo!" Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.

  In the slight buzzing sound of the motor, the stand holding the high - resolution camera moved gently on the guide rail and slowly passed over the token.

  At the same time, the computer next to him had already displayed the picture of the token.

  Because the file was a Little Big, the pictures were basically presented in parts.

  A few minutes later, the scan was completed.

  Luo gang walked in front of the computer and was about to enlarge the image generated by the scan to show everyone the effect of the following details.

  Xia ruofei said,"teacher Luo, there's no need to look!" How can we not trust the professional equipment of the Natural History Institute?"

  Luo gang laughed and said,"professional equipment can make mistakes sometimes!" You really don't need to see if the scanning results meet the requirements?"

  Xia ruofei shook his head."There's really no need. We'll just have to trouble teacher Luo to make a copy of the original file for us."

  This kind of high - resolution, non - loss format picture was relatively large, but after all, it was only a picture file. Moreover, the token was not like some paintings and paintings, which were easily a few square meters. The token was only a little bigger than an adult's palm. The scanning range was small, so the file was naturally relatively small.

  "That's no problem!" Luo gang said with a smile.

  Xia ruofei took out a high - Capacity USB from his pocket and handed it to Luo gang.""I'll have to trouble teacher Luo!"

  Luo gang quickly copied the scanned source file into the USB drive.

  After Xia ruofei took the USB, he said,""Teacher Luo, I'll have to trouble you to delete the scan records and source files in the computer. A friend asked us to help do this. He repeatedly reminded us to keep it confidential. Since it involves trade secrets ..."

  "I understand! I understand!" Luo gang didn't take it to heart as he chuckled and nodded.

  Then, in front of Xia ruofei and the others, he delightedly deleted all the scanned records and generated source files on the computer. He even cleared the cache.

  Originally, Luo gang thought that this token was simple and elegant. He wanted to study the image generated by the scan when he had the time to see what era it was from.

  People who dealt in cultural relics were always excited when they saw something good. However, since Xia ruofei and the others had a request, he would not force them.

  The cultural relics in the Forbidden City's Natural History Department were as vast as the ocean, and they could not be studied in a lifetime. Naturally, he would not be angry over a token.

  "Thank you for your understanding, teacher Luo!" Xia ruofei said.

  Then, he took out an envelope that he had prepared earlier from his bag and stuffed it into Luo gang's hand. He said,""Teacher Luo, it's just a small token of appreciation. You can keep it to buy some tea!" Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

  Luo gang's face immediately turned red. He quickly pushed her away and said,""What are you doing? Hurry up and take it back! Little song! Ask your friend to take this back!"

  Xia ruofei did not expect Luo gang to have such a big reaction. He originally thought that it was only human nature for him to express his gratitude since he had helped. He did not think too much about it.

  He didn't expect the expert from the Forbidden City's Natural History Department to be so strong. When he saw the envelope in his hand, he pushed it away as if his hand was burned by charcoal.

  Song Wei used her eyes to signal Xia ruofei to keep the envelope. Then, she explained,"Teacher Luo, RUO Fei didn't mean anything else. He just wanted to express his gratitude! He doesn't know your rules ..."

  Then, Song Wei said in a reproachful tone,""Ruofei, you don't know this, but teacher Luo never accepts money! Otherwise, with his status in the field of relic restoration, the people who come to him to ask him to restore and appraise the relics would break the threshold!"

  "Teacher Luo has the true spirit of a scholar!" Xia ruofei praised,"I was being rude! Please forgive me, teacher Luo. "

  Luo gang was a typical intellectual. After Xia ruofei and Song Wei complimented him, his anger immediately disappeared. Instead, he became embarrassed and waved his hand. "I'm not as good as you guys say. It's just that I don't care about fame and fortune. I just want to do research in peace ..."

  "Mr. Luo," Xia ruofei said,"you don't have to accept the thank you fee, but to express our gratitude, we can give you some tea leaves that we made at home. That shouldn't be a problem, right?"

  "Made at home?" Luo gang was a person who loved tea. After hearing Xia ruofei's words, he couldn't help but ask suspiciously.

  Xia ruofei nodded."It's definitely from our own tea mountain. It's handmade. There's no nice packaging, but it tastes good!"

  "Well ..." Luo gang hesitated for a moment and said,"it's nothing, but you don't have to be so polite ..."

  Luo gang felt that the tea leaves that he made should not be worth much. He was just a simple man, but he was not pedantic or ignorant of the ways of the world. Since Xia ruofei had sincerely expressed his gratitude, it would not be appropriate for him to reject him.
