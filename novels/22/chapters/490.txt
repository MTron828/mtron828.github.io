Chapter 491: Chapter 400 – debts to be calculated one by one (1)

The burly man had long been scared out of his wits by Xia ruofei. Even though Xia ruofei was hugging Ling Qingxue so tightly that he could not free his hands, even though there was a gun hidden under the seat of the multi – Purpose vehicle, he did not dare to act rashly. He obediently got out of the car and dragged houzi, who had fallen on the driver’s seat.

The burly man’s hands and feet were weak. He tried several times before he managed to unbuckle monkey’s seat belt. Then, he nervously dragged monkey down and stood to the side, not daring to breathe, like a criminal waiting for his trial.

Xia ruofei did not even look at the burly man from the corner of his eyes. He immediately checked on Ling Qingxue’s condition.

To his relief, Ling Qingxue’s breathing was steady, and there were no obvious wounds on her body. It was obvious that she was not in a serious condition. After she was taken into the car, the other party must have used something similar to ether to put her into a coma.

After making sure that Ling Qingxue was fine, Xia ruofei was relieved. He carried Ling Qingxue to the passenger seat of the business car and laid her down. He even fastened the safety belt for her and finally took off his coat to cover Ling Qingxue.

Then, Xia ruofei closed the door and turned around slowly.

After settling Ling Qingxue down, it was time to get down to business.

Monkey and another burly man were lying side by side on the ground. Not far away lay the crippled Black Panther. All three of them were unconscious.

Standing beside the monkey was the last black – clothed man who kept quiet out of fear.

When Xia ruofei looked at him, he felt as if he had fallen into an ice cave and a chill ran down his spine.

Xia ruofei’s emotionless eyes swept past the burly man and said indifferently,””In three seconds, tell me who instigated this. If you have any hesitation or can’t say it, you can die.”

With that, Xia ruofei flipped his right hand and a military dagger with a cold glint appeared in his hand. He said coldly,””Start the timer! Three, two ...”

“I said! I’ll talk!” The big man shouted with a pale face.

Xia ruofei’s face was expressionless. His entire body was emitting a cold aura as he looked at the burly man quietly.

He was well – versed in the art of interrogation, especially when the other party was already scared out of their wits. This method was very effective.

The three – second time limit could make it impossible for the other party to weave a lie, and it could also cause huge psychological pressure on the other party.

The big man in Black didn’t dare to hesitate and said,””Big brother, we are young master Liang’s men. Everything we did was ordered by him.”

Xia ruofei didn’t wait for the big man to finish his sentence and directly asked in an oppressive manner,””Who is young master Liang? Three, two ...”

“He’s ... He’s Liang Haiming!” The Man in Black quickly replied,”it’s ... It’s the people from the Liang family in Beijing!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be stunned.

He had heard of the Liang family in Beijing, but he didn’t seem to have any connection with this big family in Beijing!

The only time they had crossed paths was when he treated elder song, the stupid head of the medical team, Liang Haitao.

Although the two sides were not on good terms, and Liang Haitao was also sent to the basic health team with a dejected face, this matter happened a long time ago. Moreover, it was the song family who came forward to negotiate. Even if the Liang family wanted to settle the score, they couldn’t have dealt with him so brazenly! Not to mention that he had used such an intense method.

If the Liang family had such courage, they wouldn’t have been forced to deal with Liang Haitao under the pressure of the song family.

After all, compared to the song family, the Liang family’s strength was much weaker.

Moreover, if the Liang family wanted to take revenge on him, there was no need to send Liang Haitao to the grassroots level in the border province. Furthermore, the entire Southeast province was under the song family’s influence. It did not make sense for the Liang family to go against him so openly in the southeast province.

Hence, Xia ruofei could not help but ask,””Is it the Liang family that Liang Haitao is from?”

“Yes, yes, yes! Liang Haitao is young master Liang’s cousin!” The burly man hurriedly replied.

“The people who followed me yesterday, were they sent by Liang Haiming?”

“Yes!”

“The surveillance personnel outside my farm are also your people?” Xia ruofei asked again.

“Yes!” The large man nodded.

He had just found out that Xia ruofei had already noticed the surveillance outside the farm. What a joke, they thought that they had done it perfectly ...

“Tell me the reason why Liang Haiming did this.” Xia ruofei asked indifferently.

The Man in Black didn’t have a complete grasp of the situation, but some of Liang Haiming’s plans had been ruined by the crackdown in Sanshan city recently. Liang Haiming often flew into a rage, and his underlings had been communicating with each other about recent events in private.

He was already scared out of his wits. When Xia ruofei asked, he immediately spilled everything he knew.

Xia ruofei’s face turned colder as he heard this. It turned out that everything had started because he had crippled Fang Luo.

This young master of the Liang family was really domineering to a certain extent. Xuxu and Fang Luo could do whatever they wanted, but Xia ruofei was dragged into this matter to save his friend and was even hated.

Xia ruofei’s expression was cold. He pointed at the car behind him and asked,””Do you know who she is?” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

The Man in Black couldn’t help but shiver and said in a trembling voice,””Brother Bao said that she’s your woman ... Big brother, we’re just following orders! Everything was decided by young Liang and brother Bao, please spare me ...”

Xia ruofei stared at the Man in Black with a playful look and asked,””Liang Haiming captured my girlfriend. How are you going to deal with her? Tell me everything you know. If you dare to hide a single word, I will throw you down the cliff right now!”

“I don’t dare, I don’t dare ...” The black – shirted man was as silent as cicadas in winter.”Big brother ... I ... I only heard it from brother Bao when they were chatting ... No... It may not be accurate ...”

“I don’t need it to be accurate. You just need to tell me what you know.” Xia ruofei said coldly.

The poor man in Black did not know that Xia ruofei had been preparing to kill him for a long time. From the moment he saw Ling Qingxue being taken into the car under his eyes, Xia ruofei had already sentenced everyone who was involved to death.

The black – clothed man still harbored a trace of hope for survival, and nervously said,”Big brother, I ... I’ll tell you the truth. Please ... Please don’t be angry ...”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Don’t worry. Even if I’m angry, I won’t come for you. I’ll go find Liang Haiming!”

The Man in Black let out a sigh of relief. He thought to himself,”this God of killing seems to be easy to talk to. As long as I can escape this time, I’ll run away and never serve Liang Haiming again!” It was too dangerous to stay by his side ...

With this thought in mind, the black – clothed man also threw away the last trace of fear and said with a flattering expression,””Big brother ... Young master Liang ... No! He gave us an hour to bring your woman to his villa ... And he said ... He said that when he’s tired of her, he’ll give her to brother Bao ... Uh ... To Heibao and the others. He even said that he’ll film the whole thing and then capture you, play the video for you, and torture you to death ...”

Xia ruofei listened quietly. There was no obvious change in his expression. However, under his calm appearance, the raging fire in his heart was even more intense. He could not control his killing intent at that moment. The temperature around him seemed to have dropped.

The burly Man in Black revealed an extremely frightened expression and said with a trembling voice,””Big brother, this is what young master Liang ... Liang Haiming said! I ... I ... I’m just passing on the message!”

As the Man in Black spoke, his teeth chattered uncontrollably, making clattering sounds. It was obvious that he was extremely afraid.

Xia ruofei restrained his murderous aura and asked with a pleasant expression,””Don’t be afraid. I have one last question. If you can tell me, I’ll let you go immediately. ”

“Ask, ask! As long as I know it, I won’t dare to hide it!” The burly man hurriedly said.

“Where’s Liang Haiming?” Xia ruofei asked calmly.

The Man in Black said without thinking,””He’s at the green Bull Mountain Resort ...”

The Man in Black poured out the exact location of the villa that Liang Haiming had rented for a long time, and even the room number of the luxury suite that Liang Haiming had booked at the Kempinski Hotel in the city. He told Xia ruofei everything.

Xia ruofei listened carefully and nodded.

The black – clothed man asked hopefully,””Big brother, I’ve told you everything I know. I’m not hiding anything ... Can ... Can you let me go?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”don’t be so anxious!” How would I know if you’re not lying to me?”

“Big brother, I swear to the heavens, if there’s a single lie ...”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”don’t give me that. We’re not three – year – old kids anymore. Only an idiot would believe in the oath!” Alright, you can just stay at the side! I’ll ask your partner again. If what he says is different from what you said, you know the result ...”

“Yes, yes, yes ...” The black – clothed man quickly replied.

He didn’t dare to hide far away or even get close to the black Multi – Purpose vehicle for fear that Xia ruofei would suspect that he was going to harm Ling Qingxue. So, after hesitating for a moment, he walked to the Black Panther’s side and squatted down obediently.

Xia ruofei kicked the other man in Black awake.

This man had a little more backbone than the previous one, but after Xia ruofei used a few simple tricks, he immediately cried and confessed.

The information Xia ruofei got was similar to what the Man in Black had said, especially Liang Haiming’s hiding place. They said the same thing.

Xia ruofei knew what to do.

He didn’t intend to ask the monkey and the Black Panther any more. He cast his gaze at the two black – clothed men who were still awake, waved his hand and said,””You guys, come over and carry the two of them to the car!”

The burly Man in Black was hoping that Xia ruofei would let them go, so he did not hesitate to follow Xia ruofei’s order. The two of them carried the unconscious monkey with all their might and walked towards the black commercial car.

Xia ruofei looked at their backs and revealed a trace of ruthlessness in his eyes, as if he was looking at two dead people.

All the questions that needed to be asked had been asked, and all the information that needed to be grasped had been grasped. It was naturally time to settle the accounts.

This first debt was naturally to be settled with the people in front of him who were directly involved in Ling Qingxue’s kidnapping ...
