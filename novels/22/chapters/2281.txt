2282 Begin the healing_Dong Yun rolled up her sleeves and joined the kitchen. As the host, Xia ruofei was the most idle person. He studied the newly bought Elfa van with interest.

As the saying goes,”when people gather together, the fire will burn brighter.” Very soon, dinner was ready. Xia ruofei specially took out a few bottles of Semillon white wine and poured some for everyone.

Those who were selected to participate in this mission were naturally the elites of paradise Corporation. Everyone was in a rather excited mood. In addition, the chairman had personally set up a family banquet to entertain them, so the employees ‘mood was even higher. They all toasted Xia ruofei.

Of course, Xia ruofei was in a good mood as well, and the banquet was filled with laughter.

After dinner, Dong Yun and the rest were about to return to the hotel. Xia ruofei asked Wu Qiang to drive the brand new Elfa to send them back.

……

The next morning, at about Teno’ clock, Xia ruofei changed into a formal suit. Accompanied by Qin Yanan and he Yu, he took the Toyota Elfa driven by Wu Qiang and headed to the Shangri – La hotel.

Dong Yun and the others had already arranged the meeting room in advance.

When Xia ruofei arrived, the people from the Liu family were already there. Liu Chongli was there in person, and there were also people from Far Corporation.

That morning, Dong Yun had brought people from the legal department to have a meeting with miles Corporation to finalize the details of the share transfer agreement. Xia ruofei had only come to sign the contract.

The signing ceremony was very low – Key, and not a single reporter was invited. Only the employees of both parties took a few photos with their cameras for safekeeping.

Dong Yun had already checked all the information. Before they came, miles Corporation had already sorted out the shares, including about 30% of the shares that were not held by the Liu family. They had also issued a letter of authorization.

Xia ruofei and Liu Chongli signed and stamped on the agreement, and it came into effect.

The next step was to go to the Industry and Commerce Department for filing, and then the follow – up handover work.

Xia ruofei and Liu Chongli shook hands and said,””Boss Liu, our people hope that the transfer can be done as soon as possible. Are you okay with that?”

Liu Chongli’s expression was a little complicated. He nodded and said,”Of course! My big brother arranged it personally, and the miles Corporation will do its best to cooperate!”

“That’s good!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Liu Chongli couldn’t help but lower his voice and say,”Mr. Xia, my brother’s condition is getting worse. He even fainted last night. Although he’s fine now after the emergency treatment, his physical condition is getting worse ...”

Xia ruofei understood what Liu Chongli meant. He smiled and said,””Don’t worry! I’ll be going to elder Liu’s first treatment this afternoon!”

Liu Chongli also secretly heaved a sigh of relief. They had paid such a huge price, wasn’t it just to treat old man Liu? FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

He quickly said,”thank you so much!” Mr. Xia, do we need to prepare anything?”

Xia ruofei said indifferently,”it’s like this ... I don’t want everyone to know, so the treatment place can’t be in Room 301. It’s best not to be in your house either. Elder Liu, go through the discharge procedures first. Then, you can find a quiet and secluded place to receive treatment there.”

“Discharged?” Liu Chongli cried out,”Mr. Xia, my brother’s current physical condition can’t take any more stress. If anything happens after he’s discharged, I’m afraid it’ll be too late ...”

“With the Liu family’s power, can’t they find a few reliable doctors and nurses to take care of the family?” Xia ruofei had a faint smile on his face as he said,”and ... Since you’ve invited me over for treatment, you must choose to believe me. If you don’t have confidence in me, I can also pretend that nothing happened. I can also return the shares of miles Corporation to you! This is something that both parties are willing to do!”

Liu Chongli couldn’t help but choke. His eyes flashed with anger, but he still suppressed his emotions and nodded,”Okay, we’ll do as you say. I’ll have to trouble you to take care of my brother’s illness, Mr. Xia ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,””Good! Good!”

“Then I’ll take my leave first!” Liu Chongli said, then nodded at Xia ruofei and walked out of the hotel conference room.

Liu Chongli was not in a good mood after he had rushed over to give Xia ruofei a pharmaceutical company worth more than a billion Yuan and had been reprimanded by Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei didn’t mind. He beckoned Dong Yun over and said,”President Dong, today you will take the staff to rest in the hotel. The help I found for you will also come to the hotel. After you meet up, you will have a meeting to get to know each other and discuss the specific work. You guys will fly to Jiangsu and Zhejiang Province together and take over vast expanse first!”

“Alright!” Dong Yun nodded and said.

Xia ruofei left the meeting room and gave manager Lu a call.

Elder song had already made the necessary arrangements. After Xia ruofei’s call, manager Lu immediately arranged for people to come to the Shangri – La hotel.

It was almost time for dinner, so Xia ruofei booked a large private room in Shangri – La and invited Dong Yun and the song family’s reinforcements.

After lunch, Xia ruofei did not return to the courtyard house. Instead, he checked into a hotel room to rest.

As for the people sent by Dong Yun and the song family, they continued to rent a conference room in the hotel and started to discuss the matter of taking over horizon.

Such a large Pharmaceutical Group had changed hands, and the handover work was very complicated, including the inspection of fixed assets, the inspection and handover of accounts, the situation of employees, etc. In team combat, it was natural to come up with a plan first, and everyone had to have a clear division of labor.

Xia ruofei slept for a short while and heard the doorbell ring. The people sent by the Liu family had arrived.

After Xia ruofei had changed, they took the elevator down.

He didn’t take the car sent by the Liu family. Instead, he let Wu Qiang drive behind the Liu family’s Red flag sedan.

The two cars, one in front and one behind, almost passed through the entire capital and arrived at a secluded place in the southern suburbs.

There was a small stream here, and there were weeping willows on both sides of the stream. These willow trees had just sprouted a few tender shoots.

Under the shade of the green trees, there was a small three – story building.

The building looked unremarkable from the outside, but the dense surveillance cameras on the wall and the strong men patrolling the building from time to time showed the identity of the owner of the building.

The car stopped in front of the small building. The electric side door opened slowly and Xia ruofei got out of the car with a medicine box.

Liu Chongli and Liu Qunfeng personally welcomed him at the door and escorted Xia ruofei into the courtyard.

“The environment here looks pretty good,” Xia ruofei said as he walked.

“Mr. Xia,” Liu Qunfeng said with a smile.”We’ll carry out your request to the letter. We’ll leave the rest to you!”

“I’ll try my best. ” Xia ruofei said indifferently.

The three of them came to the second floor. In a large suite facing south, old man Liu was lying on the bed with his eyes slightly closed.

The suite had been temporarily transformed into a luxurious Ward. It was fully equipped with all kinds of medical equipment. There were also two doctors and four nurses in the room monitoring the old man’s physical condition.

After Xia ruofei entered the room, Liu Qunfeng took the initiative to ask the medical staff to leave. Then, he nodded slightly at Xia ruofei and closed the door from the outside.

“You’re here!” Old man Liu said in a weak voice.

It seemed that Liu Chongli was not lying when he said that the old master had fainted yesterday. The old master’s complexion looked much worse today.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”that’s right, elder Liu!” I’m coming ...”

Then, Xia ruofei looked around the room and said with a smile,””It’s not bad this time. There’s no such thing as setting up all those messy little things!”
