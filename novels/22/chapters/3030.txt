3031 The end of closed – door cultivation (2)

Although his cultivation was still at the beginning stage of the Golden elixir realm, his spiritual power had been greatly improved. After thousands of years of tempering, Xia ruofei felt that he had gained some more Foundation.

Other than familiarizing himself with the great Dao formula, Xia ruofei also spent some time to recall the people and things that had happened before he was trapped in the ore.

He felt that all these things had happened thousands of years ago. It really felt like time had passed.

Xia ruofei had to slowly adapt to this.

Xia ruofei left the spirit map space and rested for a day in the quiet room that was originally reserved for Luo Qingfeng.

Of course, he also took this time to sort out the things that had happened before he was trapped in the ore.

The next morning, Xia ruofei opened the door of the quiet room and walked out.

Luo Qingfeng had been standing guard outside the door for a day and a night. When he saw Xia ruofei come out, he quickly stood up and called out respectfully,””Master!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”you’ve been here all this time?” Rest when you need to rest! The Guardian doesn’t need you to guard the door at all times, as long as you can maintain vigilance, isn’t that enough? What if I were to go into seclusion for a few months? Are you going to wait like this for the next few months?”

“Master,” Luo Qingfeng said with a smile,”I was also meditating outside the door. It doesn’t matter if I go back to my room or not!” By the way, master, have you finished your closed – door cultivation?”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes!” I’m just going through the harvest this time ... Qingfeng, if there’s nothing else, I’ll be leaving in the next two days!”

Luo Qingfeng subconsciously said,’master is leaving? Then this old servant will follow master! Although this old servant’s cultivation is low, I can still serve master tea!”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry,”you’re just an Aurous core stage cultivator, why are you serving tea and pouring water?” For now, you’ll be in charge of the star Seizer sect! We’ve made a name for ourselves in the auction this time, and it’s hard to guarantee that no one will covet the star Seizer sect. Without you, a golden core stage cultivator, personally overseeing the auction, I can’t be at ease. ”

“Yes! This old servant will listen to master!” “Don’t worry, master,” Luo Qingfeng said.”I’ll definitely take care of this property!”

In Luo Qingfeng’s eyes, if he was Xia ruofei’s servant, then the star Seizer sect would naturally be Xia ruofei’s property.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”I’m not leaving immediately.” Before I leave, I’ll take a look at our sect’s protective array. If possible, I can improve it to make the sect safer!”

“Great!” Luo Qingfeng was overjoyed when he heard that.”That’s great!” Since master is personally taking action, the power must be extraordinary!”

Xia ruofei waved his hand.”Not necessarily. Let’s take a look first.”

Although Xia ruofei had obtained a lot of knowledge about arrays from the Jade talisman of inheritance and he had a lot of practical experience, the knowledge of arrays was very broad and profound. He did not dare to boast that he would be able to improve the sect’s protective array before he had seen it.

Perhaps after looking around, Xia ruofei would find that he could not change anything.

If the person who had set up the sect – protecting formation was more skilled in the array Dao than Xia ruofei, then this possibility was entirely possible.

“Yes, master!” “Yes,” Luo Qingfeng replied.

Xia ruofei continued,”in addition, I want to conduct an inspection and assessment on all the disciples of the sect. We must ensure that the sect is absolutely reliable.” I might not be able to make it in time for the time being, but I still have to register them and find a suitable time to recall them in advance. Then I’ll conduct an inspection!”

Luo Qingfeng knew that Xia ruofei had a secret technique in the area of spiritual power. It could make anyone who was hit by it have no secrets to speak of in front of him.

So after hearing Xia ruofei’s words, Luo Qingfeng said without hesitation,””Yes! Master! I’ll arrange for all the disciples to undergo an inspection!”

“Yes.” Xia ruofei nodded and said,”speaking of this, I remember ... Have you dealt with Wang Boshan?”

Wang Boshan was the star Seizer sect’s outer sect disciple who had been captured by Xia ruofei together with Zheng Yongshou.

Wang Boshan had always been in charge of some of the star Seizer sect’s businesses in the secular world. However, when Xia ruofei questioned him, he found out that this guy was notorious for his crimes. The crimes he had committed were enough for him to be shot a few times in the secular world.

Considering that Wang Boshan was in charge of the star Seizer sect’s businesses in the secular world and held the position of a majority of the company’s shareholders and directors, Xia ruofei held back his anger and did not immediately get rid of Wang Boshan.

However, he had strictly ordered Luo Qingfeng to transfer Wang Boshan back to the star Seizer sect in the name of placing him in an important position. He had also sent a capable disciple to take over Wang Boshan’s business in the secular world and then get rid of him in the star Seizer sect.

This time, when Xia ruofei talked about the loyalty and reliability of his disciples, he naturally thought of Wang Boshan, so he asked.

Hearing this, Luo Qingfeng looked embarrassed and said carefully,””Master, I haven’t had the time to deal with him ...”

Xia ruofei frowned and asked,””Why?”

He knew very well that it was impossible for Qingfeng Luo to be disloyal to him, and his loyalty was unquestionable. However, he still did not like his subordinates to be not resolute enough or be less decisive when carrying out orders.

Although Xia ruofei’s tone was not particularly harsh, Luo Qingfeng could not help but shiver. He quickly explained,””Master, our star Seizer sect has a lot of properties in the secular world, and the stock structure is also more complicated. Other than Wang Boshan, the others in the sect don’t know much about the affairs of the secular world. This time, we’ve reluctantly chosen a disciple to replace Wang Boshan. For the sake of safety, this old servant will let Wang Boshan take care of him for a period of time, and let that disciple take over before he returns to the sect. Wang Boshan had just returned to the sect a few days ago, and this old servant was not in the sect during this period of time, so the matter of dealing with Wang Boshan was delayed! This old servant should die! Master, please punish me!”

After listening to Luo Qingfeng’s explanation, Xia ruofei’s expression eased a little. He said indifferently,””Since there’s a reason for this, there’s no need to punish. However, if all the affairs in the secular world were handed over, he had to hurry up and deal with them! You’ll execute it yourself!”

Initially, according to Luo Qingfeng’s intention, those businesses in the secular world were dispensable. At that time, he wanted to get rid of Wang Boshan. However, Xia ruofei knew that the secular world could not be given up easily, especially after running it for so many years. It was not easy. That was why he proposed to find someone to replace Wang Boshan and then let Luo Qingfeng deal with it.

This was Xia ruofei’s own idea. Since this had caused the matter to be delayed, he would naturally not vent his anger on Luo Qingfeng.

“Yes!” “Yes!” Luo Qingfeng quickly replied,”I’ll do it right away!”

“Wait!” Xia ruofei called out to Luo Qingfeng, who was already walking towards the stairs. He did not know whether to laugh or cry.”I told you to hurry up and deal with it, not to go now!” There’s a need to have an order of priority, isn’t there?”

“Master!” Luo Qingfeng turned around and said,”master, it’s my fault for not being considerate!”

Xia ruofei said indifferently,”let’s take a look at the sect – protecting formation first!” Strengthening the defense is the most important thing!”

“Yes! Master!” Luo Qingfeng said,”master, the control core of the sect – protecting array is in zhaixing tower. In addition, there are also array blueprints and operation manuals in zhaixing tower. Let me take you to take a look.”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes!” Let’s settle this first!”

“Master, this way please!” “The core of the array is on the sixth floor,” Luo Qingfeng said quickly.”It was originally guarded by a few disciples, but since master went into seclusion yesterday, I have asked them to leave. We can go there directly!”

After Luo Qingfeng finished speaking, he led Xia ruofei up the stairs to the sixth floor.

Xia ruofei observed for a while and realized that the building materials of the entire sixth floor were different from those of the other floors. Although they looked similar on the outside, they were actually made of some rare metals with extremely high defensive power.

The control core of the sect protecting great array was naturally the most important of the defense.

Luo Qingfeng led Xia ruofei along the corridor and arrived at one of the rooms. After pushing the door open, Luo Qingfeng said respectfully,””Master, the core of the formation is here!”
