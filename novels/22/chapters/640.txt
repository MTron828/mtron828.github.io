Chapter 641: The coastline in the space (2)

With Xia ruofei’s money – making speed, it was easy for him to support a few researchers.

Moreover, once the heart – nourishing soup was approved for mass production, it would definitely be profitable. Xia ruofei could ignore the huge profits from the heart – nourishing soup project, but he still wanted normal profits. This was also the foundation for the company’s sustainable and healthy development.

“Alright, Chairman,” Feng Jing said.”I’ll be focusing on this for the time being. If there’s anything I’m not sure about, I’ll report to you at any time.”

“It’s been hard on you, President Feng!” Xia ruofei said sincerely,”ever since you started work, you’ve never stopped working. The company is really grateful to you!”

“I’m scheming for politics in my position!” Feng Jing chuckled.”Besides, I like working too. I like the feeling of being fulfilled!”

“I’ll give you a big red packet at the end of the year!”Xia ruofei smiled.

“I’ll be waiting then ...” Feng Rao chuckled.

Xia ruofei shook his head helplessly after he hung up.

It was really difficult to do anything now, and this was only the normal approval process. After all, the medicine concerned the health and even lives of thousands of patients. The country must be very cautious. Xia ruofei could understand this.

If the approval process went smoothly, it would take several years. If there was a delay in any link, then it would really take a long time.

Xia ruofei sighed for a while and remembered that he had not seen the changes in the new space. He then returned to the spirit map space.

Xia ruofei appeared in the stone room.

He walked out of the cave and first looked at the wordless stone tablet at the entrance of the cave.

......

This should be the primordial chaos stele, right? Xia ruofei said in his heart.

This stone tablet was too mysterious. It looked ancient and ordinary, but it was the only thing that Xia ruofei could not see through in the entire space.

Xia ruofei could at least get a general idea of the other things, including the protective shield in the stone room that couldn’t be opened for the time being and the nameless booklet that had half of its contents yet to be unlocked.

Only this stone tablet gave Xia ruofei the feeling that it was filled with endless fog.

Xia ruofei took a few glances at the stone tablet before walking to the edge of the platform and looking around.

His first thought was that Blackie and the others, who were playing at the foot of the mountain, seemed to have become smaller. The same was true for the all – terrain vehicle that was parked quietly in the space.

Xia ruofei knew that this was because the mountain he was on had grown taller.

Xia ruofei’s mind moved. The invisible force of space lifted him up and he quickly floated down the mountain.

Only in this space, when his spiritual power had reached a certain level, could Xia ruofei achieve such a leap. It was similar to flying in the sky and burrowing underground. It was quite a cool feeling!

Xia ruofei landed steadily beside the all – terrain vehicle. With a whistle, xiaohei, Da Mao, er Mao and the rest immediately rushed towards Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei affectionately picked up Blackie, who was running in front, and ruffled its head. He laughed and said,””Get in the car, I’ll bring you guys around!”

He jumped into the car and placed Blackie on the passenger seat. Fluffy one, fluffy two, and the rest also jumped into the car.

Xia ruofei started the engine and stepped on the accelerator. The all – terrain vehicle immediately rushed forward.

The open – Top car drove at high speed, and the wind whistled in his ears. He breathed in the extremely pure air that had a trace of spiritual mist, and he felt a lot more refreshed.

Along the way, Xia ruofei also observed the new space. It had indeed expanded a lot.

The mountain seemed even more majestic, and it began to have a continuous feeling. The river that wound around the mountain had become much wider, and now it was completely a huge River. The river water gushed past, making a splashing sound.

The terrain in the new space also had more ups and downs. The all – terrain vehicle sped nimbly between the small hills and soon arrived at the nearest space membrane.

Xia ruofei would usually make a circle along the space membrane to roughly estimate the area of the current space.

This time, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but step on the brakes. He stared at the space membrane with a surprised look.

Most of the land in the new space was covered in green grass. From a distance, it looked like a huge green carpet.

But today, as the space continued to expand, Xia ruofei saw a different scene.

The closer he got to the space membrane, the sparser the green grass became. There was no grass six or seven meters in front of the space membrane, and the ground exposed outside was not soil, but sand.

Moreover, the closer the desert was to the dimensional membrane, the lower it was. Once it reached the dimensional membrane, his vision would not be able to see through it.

Xia ruofei was confused. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

He jumped out of the car and sniffed. There seemed to be a hint of saltiness in the air.

Xia ruofei had been living in Taoyuan farm for a long time and was very familiar with this smell. The air at the beach was filled with this smell. As the humidity at the beach was high, there would be some tiny droplets in the air that would dissolve some salt.

Could there be an ocean in this space?

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but have this thought.

He stepped on the sand. He squatted down and grabbed a handful of sand.

The color of the sand was almost pure white, and each grain was very fine. When he held it in his hand, it quickly leaked down through the gaps between his fingers. It was a very comfortable feeling.

Xia ruofei walked towards the space membrane step by step. He was listening to Yingying. If there was really an ocean, could he hear the sound of waves?

However, the space membrane seemed to isolate everything. Xia ruofei could not hear anything.

So, he went back to the all – terrain vehicle, found a small camping shovel, ran back to the space membrane, and dug hard.

The sand here was fine and soft. After a while, Xia ruofei had dug a big hole.

When he saw that the sand below was already somewhat moist, he dug hard twice and then stopped.

Xia ruofei squatted down and grabbed a handful of wet sand. He stuck out his tongue to lick it.

A bitter and salty taste immediately came to his taste buds. Xia ruofei vomited a few times but there was still a taste in his mouth.

However, he was overjoyed, thinking that this was the smell of seawater.

Xia ruofei knew that the sea was most likely behind the space membrane.

Xia ruofei could not help but click his tongue at the thought of the boundless sea.

It was just a picture scroll, but it contained such a large space. It could simply be called another world. This was really too magical!

Xia ruofei was sure that once the realm finished its upgrade, he would be able to see the sea. As for how far it would expand, he was not sure.

Xia ruofei was looking forward to the sea.

He jumped into the car and started it impatiently, speeding along the spatial membrane.

On one hand, he had to estimate the area of the space. On the other hand, Xia ruofei also wanted to see if the sea could be seen from other places.

Along the way, Xia ruofei realized that the White beach was about two to three hundred meters long. After that, it was gradually covered by green grass and the color was the same as before.

He continued driving.

When Xia ruofei returned to the hole he had just dug, he knew that he had made one round around the space membrane.

The coastline was indeed only two to three hundred meters long, and for the time being, they could only see the beach, but not the sea.

Xia ruofei roughly estimated that the space was close to 2000 acres.

In other words, after absorbing 50 million Chinese dollars worth of Jade, the area of the new space had nearly doubled. If there were enough Jade to upgrade the space, the area would definitely be even larger.

Xia ruofei looked at the oak tree that he had planted in the new space and the Hornet that was kept in the huge iron cage. He played with Blackie and the rest for a while before leaving the spirit map space with anticipation for the sea.
