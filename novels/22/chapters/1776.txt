Chapter 1777: A different song Wei (2)

Xia ruofei laughed awkwardly. “I’m just telling you in advance!”

“Let’s go! The old place?” Song Wei did not dwell on this and asked directly.

“En!”

The two of them passed through the front yard and arrived at the courtyard where Xia ruofei was staying.

Xia ruofei felt that Song Wei didn’t talk much today. He tried to find a topic to chat about, but Song Wei’s attitude was always cold. Hence, he decided not to talk anymore. He went into the room and took out the time array flag from the space.

Then, Xia ruofei picked up a bag of food and water that he had prepared earlier. He held the bag in one hand and the array flag in the other and returned to the living room of the master suite.

Xia ruofei set up the time formation with ease and familiarity. Then, the two of them walked in and started cultivating.

Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, more than ten days had passed in the formation.

The two of them practiced the “absolute beginning Scripture” together. The effect was naturally great. Song Wei’s cultivation improved by leaps and bounds again. She had already entered the late stage of Qi disciple Level 3. Xia ruofei estimated that she only needed to practice two to three more times and she should be able to break through to Qi disciple Level 4.

If his grandnephew Li Yifu, who was far away in the US, knew about this, he would be shocked again. Li Yifu had been stuck at Qi disciple Level 3 for decades. If it wasn’t for Xia ruofei’s guidance, he would never have been able to break through to Qi disciple Level 4. Song Wei, on the other hand, was so young. She had only been on the path of cultivation for less than a year and her cultivation was almost catching up to his. It was really frustrating to compare!

This was the huge effect of cultivation resources.

The “Taichu Heart Sutra” was definitely a top – notch cultivation technique. The only drawback was that it required two people to practice together, so there were some restrictions. But it was definitely better than Li Yifu’s cultivation technique. In addition, Song Wei had spirit crystals when she cultivated, which could provide her with an almost unlimited amount of spirit Qi. She could cultivate at any time and place, which was something that Li Yifu did not even dare to think about.

Whether it was a cultivation technique or a spiritual crystal, strictly speaking, they were all cultivation resources.

Of course, Xia ruofei did not know Li Yifu very well now. If Li Yifu’s character and integrity were not a problem in the future, Xia ruofei would also help him on account of his relationship with his master.

Xia ruofei also benefited from the training with Song Wei.

As Song Wei’s cultivation level increased, Xia ruofei gained more and more benefits when he cultivated the “absolute beginning Heart Sutra” with Song Wei. Now, he was slightly faster than when he cultivated the “great Dao Sutra” alone.

Through this phase of cultivation, Xia ruofei’s cultivation had reached the peak of Qi disciple Level 5. He could clearly feel the barrier. As long as he could break through the barrier, he would naturally break through to Qi disciple Level 6.

Xia ruofei even had the urge to continue cultivating the great Dao technique and break through in one go. However, he also knew that every time he reached the 3rd, 6th, and 9th level, it was equivalent to a small leap in cultivation. The barrier of cultivation would be particularly tough, and it would not be so easy to break through.

Hence, Xia ruofei was not in a hurry to achieve results. Instead, he adopted a steady and steady strategy.

Even so, by Xia ruofei’s conservative estimation, he would be able to achieve a breakthrough in a month at the latest, or a week at the earliest.

Just as Xia ruofei was about to keep the time array flag, Song Wei suddenly said, ” ” Ruofei, there’s still some time. I think ... Let’s try to see if we can get rid of the peach blossom miasma! ”

Xia ruofei was stunned. He rubbed his temples and asked, ” “Didn’t we agree that we’ll wait until you’ve broken through before we do it again? ”

Song Wei did not say anything. She just looked at Xia ruofei. She looked weak but determined.

Xia ruofei asked,” is it because ... That peach blossom miasma has started to affect your life? ” That’s not possible! With your current cultivation, it should be very easy for you to suppress the peach blossom miasma! Could it be that it has mutated over time ...”

“Don’t guess.” Song Wei said, ” there’s nothing wrong with the miasma. I just want to get rid of it as soon as possible ...”

There was one more thing that Song Wei did not say. After she had removed the peach blossom miasma, she had stopped contacting Xia ruofei.

These few days, Song Wei had been thinking a lot. She even knew that Ling Qingxue had come to Beijing. She urged Xia ruofei to post a photo of the two of them at the groundbreaking ceremony on Weibo. Since their relationship was already public, Xia ruofei did not hide it anymore. Since Feng Jing said that Weibo had to be active to a certain extent, he felt that a photo with his girlfriend should be able to attract fans. Of course, it was true.

On one hand, Song Wei felt guilty. On the other hand, she did not see any hope.

More importantly, as the number of times they practiced the ” Scripture of the primordium origin ” together increased, their souls were almost in perfect sync, and Song Wei felt that she could not stop herself.

Song Wei didn’t want to sink deeper and deeper, so she decided to cut the Gordian knot.

She just wanted to get rid of the peach blossom miasma today and never disturb Xia ruofei’s life again.

In just a few months of cultivation, Song Wei knew that this was a path to a magical world. Making this decision meant that her future cultivation would basically stop here. After all, if she cultivated the “absolute beginning Heart Sutra” alone, the effect would be too poor.

Even so, Song Wei still made such a difficult decision.

This was the reason why she accepted Xia ruofei’s invitation.

Xia ruofei was silent for a while before he asked,””Can you tell me the reason? I think you’re already very clear that trying to remove the peach blossom miasma at this time is not a small risk. ”

“I know ...” Song Wei nodded her head.

“I don’t think you know!” Xia ruofei’s tone was a little agitated.”Removing the miasma requires a high degree of compatibility between our souls, and all the operations will be carried out in your sea of consciousness. Do you understand what this means? If anything goes wrong, your sea of consciousness will be damaged, and you’ll become a useless person who can’t cultivate spiritual power. If it’s serious ... You might even become a vegetable!”

“I know all of this. You’ve told me this many times.” Song Wei said calmly.

“Then why did you decide to take the risk at this time?” Xia ruofei asked.

Song Wei nodded and said, “There’s nothing in the world that’s absolutely foolproof. No matter how well we prepare, we can’t guarantee that there won’t be any mistakes, can we?”

“How can that be the same? Qi disciple Level 4 and Qi disciple Level 3 were two completely different concepts! And I’m about to break through to Qi disciple Level 6! At that time, I can clear this damn peach blossom miasma. Although I can’t guarantee it, I can at least guarantee a 95% success rate! If we take the risk now, the success rate will only be 70%!” Xia ruofei said.

“A 70% chance is not low.” Song Wei remained unmoved.

Xia ruofei did not know whether to laugh or cry. He asked helplessly,””Why? What is it that you can’t even wait for such a short time? You’re even willing to take such a big risk?”

“You don’t have to ask ...” Song Wei’s expression darkened.

After ten consecutive days of cultivation, Song Wei felt that she was addicted to the soul – fitting experience. Her soul seemed to be trembling when she cultivated. She could not guarantee that if she continued to cultivate like this a few more times, she would not be able to remain so calm when it came to Xia ruofei.

Therefore, she was very determined this time. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Xia ruofei and Song Wei stared at each other. After a while, Xia ruofei shook his head and said,””No, this is irresponsible to you. I can’t agree to this!”

Song Wei’s eyes were slightly moist. She bit her lower lip and looked at Xia ruofei stubbornly.

After a long while, she suddenly burst out,””Xia ruofei! I’ve already said that I can accept such danger! Even if something happens, it’s none of your business! I don’t even care about myself, who are you to me! What right do you have to make decisions for me? It’s my own matter, so why are you taking responsibility! What right do you have to take responsibility! Every time, you put on a lecturing face. I’ve been tolerating you for a long time, you know! Are you done or not!”

Xia ruofei was dumbfounded when he saw Song Wei, who was usually gentle, suddenly forget about her image as a lady and almost break down ...
