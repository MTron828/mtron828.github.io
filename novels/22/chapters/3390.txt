Chapter 3391: Unexpected reward (1)

Translator: 549690339

As Ling Qingxue’s cultivation level was still relatively low and her spiritual power was far inferior to Xia ruofei’s, she did not feel it very clearly.

Even so, she still felt that cultivating in this stone pillar array was much more efficient than usual. She couldn’t even sense the effect of the array, but she felt that her mind was more clear than before, and her cultivation was so smooth.

As for Xia ruofei, he had analyzed the formation himself and his cultivation was close to the intermediate stage of the Golden elixir realm. His spiritual power had also improved by leaps and bounds, so he could feel it more clearly.

When he was cultivating, he felt as if there was a warm stream of air that was constantly nourishing his physical and spiritual body. His mind was much clearer than usual, and his cultivation of the ‘great Dao Sutra’ was also much smoother than usual.

The spiritual Qi in the space of the trial Pagoda was already very rich. When he reached the fifth floor of the trial Pagoda, the concentration of spiritual Qi here was no less than that of the Peach Blossom Island. The stone pillar array also had the function of gathering spiritual Qi, so the concentration of spiritual Qi here was even higher very soon.

Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue naturally did not hold back. They started to absorb and cultivate.

Xia ruofei also took the opportunity to pour his energy into the energy storage Pearl. After all, this was free spiritual energy. With the help of the stone pillar array, the spiritual energy seemed to have been purified and it was easier to absorb. Naturally, Xia ruofei was more motivated to absorb it.

All in all, Xia ruofei had a simple experience and realized that the stone pillar formation was a comprehensive aid to cultivation.

It was conceivable that if such an array could be set up in a sect, it would greatly improve the overall strength of the sect!

However, Xia ruofei knew that this was just a thought. In the trial Pagoda, not even a puppet’s corpse could be stored in the storage space. The precious topaz essence could only be absorbed on the spot. Once the time for the mission was up, it would be transported away immediately. If it was not absorbed completely, it would be a waste no matter how much Topaz essence it had.

In this way, this stone pillar array was countless times more precious than the yellow jade essence. Moreover, the range was so wide, so it was even more impossible to secretly bring it out.

Hence, Xia ruofei was thinking of taking advantage of the situation. While he was still on the fifth level of the trial Pagoda, he should quickly use the formation to cultivate. Otherwise, he would not be able to enjoy such thoughtful auxiliary services after he left.

In the hidden space enshrouded in purple mist, the green – robed elder in the towering Hall saw the scene in the mirror and couldn’t help but laugh. He muttered to himself,”’’This little boy has really lived a lot of hard days, he doesn’t even let go of such a small advantage … But this old man’s time can’t be wasted by you guys!”

The green – robed old man waved his hand as he spoke.

On the fifth floor of the trial Pagoda, Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue were cultivating to their heart’s content, absorbing the spiritual Qi from the stone pillar array.

The stone pillar formation shook slightly. Xia ruofei could clearly feel that the operation of the formation had slowed down.

He immediately sensed it and opened his eyes in surprise.

The scene in front of him made Xia ruofei’s eyes widen involuntarily. At this time, Ling Qingxue had also noticed the abnormality. She stopped cultivating and opened her eyes. At first glance, she could not help but exclaim softly. She looked at Xia ruofei and asked,”RUO Fei, what’s going on? Could this formation be…”

Even though the spiritual crystals that Xia ruofei had inserted into the array were not used up yet, the stone pillar array had stopped working.

This was equivalent to the array losing control!

Furthermore, the entire stone pillar array started to tremble slightly.

Then, under Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue’s astonished gazes, the stone pillars slowly rose from the ground. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei grabbed Ling Qingxue’s hand and was ready to take out the spirit map scroll at any time. If there was any danger, he would immediately hide in the spirit map space with Ling Qingxue.

However, even though the rise of the stone pillars caused the entire wasteland to shake, there was no danger.

In a short while, all the stone pillars had risen.

They seemed to be lifted by an invisible force, quietly floating in the air, still maintaining the original form of the array.

Seeing this, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but Mutter to himself,””Could it be that the senior who built this Tower of Trials was so stingy that he didn’t even give the junior A chance to use the array after the task was over and took it back in a hurry… But my spiritual crystals are still inside! It’s confiscated just like that? That’s too ruthless!”

In the space filled with purple Qi, the purple – robed elder was so angry that he glared at Xia ruofei and scolded,””Bullshit! Do 1 look like such a petty person?”

After saying that, the purple – robed old man snorted coldly again. He waved his wide sleeves and cast a mysterious magic art.

If one were to observe carefully, one would notice that although the purple – robed elder looked displeased, there was actually a hint of a smile in his eyes.

Obviously, he was not really angry with Xia ruofei. On the contrary, he admired Xia ruofei more.

When the elder in the green Taoist robe waved his sleeves and cast a new technique, Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue, who were on the fifth floor of the trial Pagoda, suddenly realized that the stone pillar array had suddenly burst out with a strong light. The two of them subconsciously closed their eyes..
