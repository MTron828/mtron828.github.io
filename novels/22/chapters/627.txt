Chapter 628: The brat is finally gone (1)

Xia ruofei’s mouth was dry from talking and he finally managed to coax the little descendant to sleep. At this time, he was physically and mentally exhausted and did not have the mood to take a bath again. Who knew if the little girl would suddenly want to go to the bathroom again when he was taking a bath?

Xia ruofei went back to the bathroom and found a dry towel to dry his hair. He did not even dare to use the hairdryer as he was afraid of waking up Huanhuan.

After his hair was dry, Xia ruofei hurried back to his bed and went to sleep.

That night, Xia ruofei felt like he was dreaming.

One moment, he dreamed that he was caught by the little monster and forced to tell it the story of shukbeta. As he told it, the little monster gradually turned into Huanhuan ...

The next moment, he dreamed that he was galloping on a horse in the grassland, and then it suddenly rained heavily, drenching him with bubbles ... Yes, the sky was not filled with water, but with bubbles ...

Then, he quickly changed his image and the scene in his dream changed into a kindergarten. He seemed to be a kindergarten teacher? “Teacher, I want to pee, I want to pee ...” A large group of naughty children surrounded him and said.

Xia ruofei could not sleep well the entire night. In his daze, he felt something rubbing against his face.

Xia ruofei opened his eyes in a daze and saw a tender foot!

Xia ruofei thought that he was hallucinating because he had not fully woken up. He rubbed his eyes and looked again. It was really a foot. It even rubbed against his face a few times ...

What was going on?

Xia ruofei got up and saw that Huanhuan had turned over. One of her feet was on his head while the other was accurately rubbing against his face ...

......

Fortunately, the little girl was still covered with the blanket, otherwise she would have caught a cold.

Xia ruofei was speechless. He stood up and gently carried Huanhuan up. He adjusted her position and took a look at the phone on the bedside table.

5:10 am.

He had only slept for three hours! Why did it feel like a long dream?

Xia ruofei continued to lie down and prepared to go back to sleep.

At this moment, Huanhuan moved and snuggled into Xia ruofei’s arms. Then, she changed to a more comfortable position and curled up into a ball in Xia ruofei’s arms.

Xia ruofei reached out and gently hugged little Huanhuan. He closed his eyes in a daze ...

As for brewing the pregnancy soup, Xia ruofei did not have the energy to care about it. Taking care of Huanhuan for an entire night was even more tiring than practicing the third set of movements for the little golden man three times in a row.

When he opened his eyes again, it was already past seven in the morning.

Xia ruofei turned around and saw Huanhuan still curled up in his arms, sleeping soundly.

Xia ruofei gently removed Huanhuan’s hand, pulled the blanket away, and got off the bed quietly. He went to the bathroom to wash up.

After Xia ruofei finished washing up and changed his clothes, Huan Huan opened her eyes in a daze. She said weakly in a soft voice,””Good Morning, brother ruofei ...”

“Good Morning!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Huanhuan, it’s time to get up! I’ll take you to breakfast. ”

“I want to sleep a little longer ...” Huanhuan said as she closed her eyes again.

Didn’t you want to visit the farm?” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Oh right, you still want to play with lightning, don’t you? Also, brother has two very beautiful fish at home. Do you want to see them?”

As soon as Xia ruofei finished his sentence, Huan Huan got up and shouted,””Good, good! Big brother ruofei, quickly take me down!”

Xia ruofei pointed at the bathroom and said,””Wash up first, then obediently eat your breakfast. Big brother will take you out to play!”

“yessir!”Huan Huan saluted cheekily and then ran into the bathroom happily.

Xia ruofei had prepared a new towel and toothbrush for Huanhuan. The little girl’s self – care ability was already pretty good. She could wash her face and brush her teeth by herself. However, she did not have enough strength to wring the towel, so she needed Xia ruofei’s help.

Huanhuan finished washing up very quickly.

Xia ruofei opened the bag that Tian Huixin had prepared yesterday and took out the clothes inside. It was a pink dress. After Huanhuan changed into it, she looked even more like a porcelain doll.

But ... Xia ruofei still felt that something was not right ...

He took a closer look and immediately realized that it was a problem with his hair.

Huanhuan’s hair was unkempt, and it looked even messier after a night’s sleep.

Little Huanhuan was also quite familiar with the procedures after waking up. She took the initiative to say,””Brother RUO Fei, help me comb my hair! After that, we can go for breakfast!”

Xia ruofei looked embarrassed. Comb her hair? I don’t think I’ve mastered this skill yet ...

“Um ... Huanhuan, can I discuss something with you?” Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”can we go eat first? There are a few pretty big Sisters over there, I’ll get them to help you comb your hair. ”

Huan Huan shook her head like a rattle drum. She looked at Xia ruofei strangely and said,””Of course not! Image is very important, how can I go out with disheveled hair?”

“We’re not out yet, we’re still on the farm!” Xia ruofei smiled apologetically.”Huanhuan, the place to eat is not far from there. Let’s bring the comb and rubber band over. I’ll find a sister with the best skills to comb your hair for you! Can I?”

“No, no...” Huanhuan said,”I want to comb my hair before eating!” Brother ruofei, help me comb it ...”
