Chapter 87: A warm dinner (1)

Xia ruofei parked his car at the family area of the forestry Bureau. He carried a small water bucket in one hand and a basket of Peach Garden vegetables in the other to the door of Hu Zi’s mother’s house on the third floor. He put down the water bucket and knocked on the door. Soon, the door opened. Hu Zi’s mother was very happy to see Xia ruofei.””RUO Fei is here! Come in, come in ...” Xia ruofei bent down to pick up the water bucket and followed Hu Zi’s mother into the house. Hu ‘Zi’s mother nagged,”you child, just come!” Why did he bring things? Aren’t you treating Auntie as an outsider?” “Auntie, these are all vegetables that I grew myself. I also raised the fish with my friends. I brought them here for you and Qiao’ er to try.” Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”Auntie, how’s your recovery?” Hu ‘er’s mother said happily,”I’m feeling great now!” I think he should have fully recovered ... Ruofei, that medicine of yours is really godly!” Xia ruofei was placing the vegetables in the kitchen. He poked his head out and smiled.”Auntie, I made some Chinese medicine yesterday and brought it to you today. Please eat for a while longer. ” “I don’t need to eat, right? I’m already fine!” Hu Zi’s mother said,”it must be expensive to make this medicine, right?” Xia ruofei tidied up the vegetables and walked out of the kitchen.”It doesn’t cost much. They’re all common Chinese medicinal herbs.” After he finished speaking, he took out the bottle of flower petal solution that he had prepared earlier and handed it to Hu Zi’s mother. Then, he said,”aunty, you can continue to take it even if you’re well.” This liquid doesn’t have any side effects. Not only does it cure diseases, but it also has good health. You can drink it without worry!” “Woof! Ruofei, thank you for your hard work!” Hu ‘er’s mother nodded in response. “Shouldn’t I be filial to you?”he asked. Xia ruofei smiled and continued to ask,”Oh right, Auntie, is it Qiao’ er’s winter break soon?” “I think there’s still two to three weeks left!” Hu Zi’s mother said. “Oh! After the holidays, you and Qiao’ er can stay at my place for a while!” Xia ruofei said,”I’ve rented a small villa in jianggang town. I’ve also bought some land to build a farm. The environment there is better than the city. Let’s celebrate the new year together this year!” “Alright! “I’ll do the laundry and cook for you ...”Hu Zi’s mother agreed happily. Xia ruofei smiled bitterly.”Aunty, you don’t have to do the laundry or cook. You can just enjoy your life.” “I can’t stay idle. Isn’t it good that I can help you with something?” Hu Zi’s mother said. “Alright, we’ll talk about it when the time comes ...” Xia ruofei said helplessly. The two of them sat down and started to chat. Hu Zi’s mother told her about her and Qiao’ er’s life, while Xia ruofei picked out some of the things that he was busy with to tell Hu Zi’s mother. The old and the young were having a good time chatting. When it was around fouro’ clock, Hu Zi’s mother got up and went to the kitchen to prepare dinner. Xia ruofei naturally had to stay for dinner. Otherwise, not only would Hu Zi’s mother not agree, Lin Qiao would also not agree if she came back and found out! Xia ruofei sat in the living room and watched TV. In no time, he could smell the alluring aroma of food coming from the kitchen. At this moment, the door opened. Xia ruofei looked up and heard Lin Qiao’s voice before he saw her.””Mom! What delicious food did you make? It smells so good!” As she spoke, she took a pair of slippers from the shoe rack at the door and changed into them. When she walked into the living room, she saw Xia ruofei sitting on the sofa and smiling at her. Lin Qiao shrieked in surprise. She threw away her bag and pounced on him, shouting,”Brother ruofei!” Xia ruofei immediately felt a warm, fragrant, and soft jade in his arms. Lin Qiao hugged him tightly. The girls in the third year of high school were not children anymore. Lin Qiao had developed well and her body had a faint fragrance. Xia ruofei suddenly felt that it was a little too much for her. He quickly said,”Let go, let go ...” “No!” Lin Qiao chuckled. After saying that, she hugged him even tighter. Xia ruofei could only break away from her embarrassedly. If she hugged him any longer, his body would have a reaction. That would be embarrassing. Lin Qiao looked at Xia ruofei and asked,”brother ruofei, why didn’t you come to see us for so long?” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I was a little busy a while ago, so I’m here now.” By the way, how are your studies? You didn’t play any tricks, did you?” “What naughty! He’s a good student!” Lin Qiao said,”your studies are good! The teachers are better than the teachers in our County middle school, and there are many top students among my classmates. I feel like I’ve improved a lot!” “That’s good!” Xia ruofei said,”study hard. When you get into college, I’ll give you a big gift!” “There’s even a gift to receive!” Lin Qiao was overjoyed and quickly asked,”can you tell me what the gift is?” “You’ll know when the time comes! It’s definitely a surprise ...”Xia ruofei said mysteriously.” So you have to work harder!” You have to at least get into 211 school to get a present!” “Hmph! Don’t look down on me. Although my Foundation is a little worse than my classmates, it’s not impossible for me to get into the 211 exam with hard work. ” Lin Qiao puffed up her chest and said,”brother ruofei, just wait for your wallet to bleed!” “I can’t wait for that!” Xia ruofei laughed. At this moment, Hu ‘Zi’s mother popped her head out of the kitchen and said,””Qiao’ er, why do you keep pestering your brother ruofei the moment you come back? Why aren’t you changing your clothes? Get ready to wash your hands and eat!” “I know!” Lin Qiao stuck out her tongue at Xia ruofei and said. Soon, Lin Qiao went back to her room and changed into a cute pink cotton – padded jacket. Then, she ran to the living room and chatted with Xia ruofei about school. She only stopped when Hu ‘Zi’s mother finished cooking and urged her to wash her hands. When Lin Qiao went to wash her hands, Hu Zi’s mother said to Xia ruofei,””Ruofei, Qiao’ er used to like to pester her brother and chat with him. Ever since Hu Zi left, she’s rarely this happy ... Thank you!” Xia ruofei saw that Hu Zi’s mother’s eyes were red and quickly said,””Aunty, look at what you’re saying. Hu Zi’s sister is my sister. We’re a family, what’s there to be polite about? I’ll come to visit you often in the future. ” Hu ‘Zi’s mother said, pleased,”it’s enough that you have this thought.” Young people should be busy with their careers. Just come and visit when you’re free ...” After Lin Qiao washed her hands, the three of them sat around the table and had dinner together. Hu Zi’s mother’s cooking skills were quite good, and the ingredients were all produced in the spirit map space. Qiao’ er was amazed by how delicious the food was, especially the two grass carp. Even Hu Zi’s mother was full of praise for the taste of the dish. Seeing the happy smiles on Hu Zi’s mother and Qiao’ er’s faces, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but think of Hu Zi’s face and the last words he had said when the bullet hit him. “RUO ... Ruofei ... Help me ... Take care of my mom ... And my ... Younger sister ...” Hu Zi, don’t worry! ‘I’m here for everything ...’ Xia ruofei said in his heart. [PS] I’ll be on Sanjiang recommendation this week.
