2371 “Kindred spirits”(1)

The guest outside the door was Xia ruofei.

In fact, when Xia ruofei used his spiritual power to investigate, he also discovered Daka’s existence and was shocked.

Xia ruofei did not hear the first half of the conversation between the high priest manchila and Daka, but he did hear the part where manchila ordered Daka to head to Basoko town to investigate the explosion case.

Therefore, he was already 100% sure that this highly respected high priest manchila of arulei was the leader of the Kongtong modr organization, Satan, his main target for his trip to Africa.

To Xia ruofei’s surprise, the pure and happy – looking black young man who had a good impression of Huaxia, Daka, was actually a follower of the priest.

However, from the conversation between the high priest and Daka, Xia ruofei had a preliminary conclusion. Daka did not know that the high priest was the leader of the modr, Satan. Otherwise, the high priest would not have to be so secretive.

Just as Xia ruofei was about to listen for a while more to see if there was any more useful information, the high priest actually discovered his whereabouts!

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows. With his ability to hide his tracks and conceal his aura, it was basically impossible for ordinary people to discover him.

It seemed that this high priest was indeed not ordinary!

However, Xia ruofei did not hide. Instead, he walked out of his hiding place and stood at the door, waiting.

He had absolute confidence in his own strength. Even if he were to encounter a cultivator who was stronger than him, Xia ruofei believed that he would have no problem escaping.

He only needed to avoid the other party’s detection for a short time to be able to take out the spirit map scroll and hide inside it.

The spirit painting scroll was so small that it would not be easy for the enemy to discover it if it was hidden in any crevice.

Furthermore, the high priest was only alerted when he was already close to the small courtyard. It could be seen that even if he had some small skills, they were not very high.

Hence, Xia ruofei was still very confident.

In the courtyard.

Daka didn’t notice any movement outside, but he had absolute faith in the high priest’s abilities, so he immediately nodded and said,””Yes, high priest!”

After saying that, Daka quickly walked out and passed through the courtyard to the door.

When Daka opened the door and saw Xia ruofei standing at the entrance, he was stunned.

He recognized the person in front of him. It was the Asian he had seen at the temple. He had mistook him for his new friend, Xia Tian.

“Friend,” said Daka immediately,”you have left the tourist area. This is the private residence of the Honorable high priest. Please leave immediately!”

At this moment, high priest manchila’s voice came out of the house,””Daka! It’s not the right way to treat a guest by keeping them outside the door. Sir, since you’re already here, please come in and have a seat!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Thank you for your invitation, high priest. I will accept your invitation!”

Daka was slightly taken aback. Even though he did not understand, he was absolutely obedient to the high priest’s orders, so he stepped aside and made an inviting gesture.

After Xia ruofei entered, Daka immediately closed the door and quickly caught up to Xia ruofei. He whispered,””Sir, the high priest has a very high status in arulei. Everyone here respects him very much. Please pay attention to your manners.”

Xia ruofei looked at Daka with interest and nodded with a smile.

After passing through the small courtyard, Xia ruofei followed Daka to the small living room of the bungalow.

High priest manchila sat on the chair and looked at Xia ruofei with his deep eyes, revealing a hint of enigma.

Xia ruofei also had a faint smile on his face as he looked at the seemingly harmless high priest.

At the same time, Xia ruofei could feel the sensor Jade Leaf on his chest getting hotter. It was obvious that the world stone was in this small house.

Thinking of this, Xia ruofei could not help but feel excited.

The high priest made an inviting gesture and said,””My friend from the mysterious East, please take a seat!”

This time, Xia ruofei’s appearance had obvious Southeast Asian characteristics. In the eyes of Africans, they were also Easterners, so Xia ruofei was not surprised. He smiled and nodded, then sat down on the chair opposite the high priest.

The high priest looked at Xia ruofei deeply and said to Daka,””Daka, go and make two cups of tea! Use the good tea you brought back from China last time. ”

“Yes, high priest!” “Understood,” replied Dorka.

He didn’t know why the high priest was so polite to this plain – looking southeast Asian man, but he still went to the room on the left to find tea leaves to make tea.

The high priest smiled at Xia ruofei and said,””Friend from the East, let me introduce myself. I am Manzila, the high priest of arulei. I wonder how I should address you?”

Xia ruofei made up a name and said,””High priest, I’m from siam, you can just call me su Cai.”

A hint of disappointment appeared in Manzila’s eyes, but he concealed it well. He smiled and said,””So you’re from Siamese, Mr. Surchai. I thought you were Chinese ... I’m sorry, but in our eyes, all Asians look the same. My student, Daka, knows the East better, so I think he can tell.”

Xia ruofei’s heart skipped a beat. He had a feeling that this high priest was not simple. More importantly, there were realm stones in the high priest’s room. Hence, he could not rule out the possibility that this high priest had something to do with the cultivation world.

Now that Manzila mentioned Huaxia, Xia ruofei’s curiosity was piqued.

Xia ruofei smiled.”Actually, I’m half Chinese. My grandfather and mother are both from China.”

Xia ruofei made up a simple story and told Manzila,””My grandfather went to siam from China in his early years and married a local woman, who gave birth to my father. My father fell in love with my mother when he was studying in China, and then we had me. So ... Strictly speaking, I have three quarters of Chinese blood. ”

The high priest looked very interested and smiled,””I see ...”

At this moment, Decca came over with two cups of tea on a tray.

“Please have some tea!” Daka said respectfully.

The high priest nodded and said,”Daka, you can leave first!” Remember to complete the task I gave you!”

“Yes, high priest!” Said Darka as he bowed slightly.

Then, he nodded to the high priest and Xia ruofei, walked out of the house, and left the courtyard.

Xia ruofei heaved a sigh of relief when he saw that Daka had left. If the black man had stayed, he would have been in a difficult position.

This was because he was definitely going to meet Manzilla, the leader of the modr organization, on the battlefield. The politeness he was showing now was just an act. The two of them did not fall out with each other and were only testing each other, hoping to get more information from each other.

Besides, Xia ruofei was confident that he could defeat the high priest. If Daka was still here, Xia ruofei would have to keep him in the spirit map space to keep the secret.

According to the previous information, Daka was not involved with the modr organization. Even if he did help Manzilla, he would not have to bear the consequences of life imprisonment.

Now that the high priest Manzilla had sent Daka away and told him to go to Basoko town according to the original plan, it was exactly what Xia ruofei wanted.

After Daka left, Manzila smiled and said,””Mr. Su Cai, you have Chinese blood in you, I wonder if you can speak Chinese?”

The two of them had been conversing in English. Xia ruofei nodded and said in Chinese,””Of course! I’ve been learning Chinese since I was young, and I communicate with my elders in Chinese at home!”

Manzila was very happy to hear this, and also changed to Chinese,”Then let’s communicate in Chinese! My Chinese isn’t very good, please forgive me!”

Manzilla’s Chinese was not particularly good. Many of his pronunciations had a strange accent, which was different from the Chinese spoken by foreigners in Europe and the United States. In short, it sounded strange. His Chinese standard was much worse than that of Dorka, but at least he could understand it.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.

Manzila looked at Xia ruofei deeply and said,”If I’m not wrong, Mr. Su Cai and I should be the same kind of person, because no one has ever been able to get close to that position before I found out. I think we should be able to exchange some insights ...”

Xia ruofei came to a sudden realization. He had a rough guess in his heart, but he still needed to verify it.

Hence, Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”I wonder what kind of thoughts high priest would like to share?”

Manzila laughed and said,”of course it’s the mysterious Eastern witchcraft!” Surely Mister su Cai wouldn’t refuse the invitation of a fellow ... Fellow Daoist?”

After saying that, a smile appeared on Manzila’s face. He clenched his hand into a claw and pulled back at a wooden carving hanging on the wall. The palm – sized wooden carving was directly pulled over and flew into his hand.

This high priest had indeed come into contact with cultivation methods! Xia ruofei cried out in his heart.

However, at the same time, he did not know whether to laugh or cry, because Manzila actually called the cultivation method “Eastern witchcraft”. He reckoned that this black old man was also half – baked, and most likely “self – taught”, and had not come into contact with the complete cultivation system.

Manzila revealed a proud look and smiled at Xia ruofei.”Mr. Su Cai, how’s my telekinesis? Can you give me some comments?”

Telekinesis was a test of one’s spiritual power. Seeing manzilaru’s move, Xia ruofei already had an idea.

Manzilla obviously thought that he had finally met someone who was on the same path as him and hoped to communicate with him. Maybe he could have some sparks of inspiration. At least, it was better than him working behind closed doors.

However, Xia ruofei didn’t want to continue with his pretense.

“Not bad, Mr. Satan!” He said with a smile.

Manzila was originally full of smiles, but when he heard the word “Satan,” his face suddenly changed ...
