“Father,” Chen Xuan said awkwardly,”I promised brother Xia that I’d give him one of the first heaven society’s spots if I were to explore the secret of the token ...”

At the auction, Chen Xuan had wanted to compete for the five Saints token. He had borrowed from Xia ruofei because he did not have enough spiritual stones. That was why he had made such a promise.

Chen Nanfeng couldn’t help but be stunned. He had really forgotten about this.

At that time, Chen Xuan did not know that Xia ruofei had one token and everything was still unclear. He did not know what the secret of the five Saints token was. He only guessed that if he could crack the secret of the token, each force would have no problem getting three spots. If they got two tokens, they would have six spots. It would not be a big deal to give one to Xia ruofei. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

However, the situation was different now.

Xia ruofei already had a token. Since the destination of this expedition was the moon, they had to reduce the number of people as much as possible.

According to Chen Nanfeng’s plan, the first heaven society would get two spots, the surging waves sect, the flying flower Valley, and Xia ruofei would each get one spot. Then, according to Chen Xuan’s promise, one spot would be given to Xia ruofei. This meant that Xia ruofei would get two spots, and the three sects would only get one spot each.

Chen Nanfeng clearly couldn’t accept this.

However, words that had been spoken were like water that had been poured out. How could they be taken back?

Not to mention, a big sect like the first heaven sect had to keep their promise.

Therefore, Chen Nanfeng was suddenly in an awkward situation.

At this time, Xia ruofei smiled and said,”brother Chen, that was just a joke. How can you take it seriously?!” There’s no need to mention this again. Let’s arrange the personnel according to sect leader Chen’s plan!”

“No!” Chen Nanfeng said. Xuan ‘er has made a promise on behalf of the first heaven society. We can’t go back on our words! Moreover, if it wasn’t for fellow Daoist Xia’s generosity, who knows which power would’ve gotten their hands on this command medallion! Perhaps we won’t be able to come to an agreement to study the token, or the token will disappear while we’re still arguing. Therefore, fellow Daoist Xia’s actions back then were a great help to us!”

Xia ruofei was also dumbfounded. He didn’t need that many slots! It wasn’t appropriate for the first heaven society to have fewer spots than him. After all, they had given him two tokens.

At this moment, Ling Qingxue, who was beside Xia ruofei, tugged on his sleeve and whispered into his ear,””Ruofei, I also want to go ...”

Xia ruofei then realized that Ling Qingxue had also passed the music screening. Theoretically, she could also go to the moon to find the secret realm.

However, Xia ruofei frowned and said,””What a joke! They were going to the moon! Not to the back garden! It’s too dangerous, you can’t go!”

Ling Qingxue said,”if you can go, I can go too!” No matter how dangerous it is, I’m not afraid! You’re going so far away this time, I have to stay by your side, or else I’m really scared ...”

At this point, Ling Qingxue’s eyes became a little wet.

Xia ruofei’s heart could not help but soften. He gently put his arm around Ling Qingxue’s shoulder and said,””Qingxue, don’t worry! I will definitely return safely! You can just wait for my news at home ...”

Ling Qingxue stubbornly shook her head and said,””I won ‘t! I can also sense the situation of the music, and I also meet the screening criteria. Since you have a spot, why don’t you let me go? If we’re talking about danger, we’ll all be in danger. Don’t tell me that if you go alone, we won’t be worried?”

Although the two of them spoke softly, everyone was a cultivator, so how could they not hear?

Therefore, Chen Nanfeng took a deep breath and said in a clear voice,””Fellow Daoist Xia, there’s no need to say anything more. The first heaven society has given you a spot, so we must honor it. How about this ... We’ll give our spots to elder Shen tianfang, and Chen Xuan ... Don’t go!”

According to this distribution, only Shen tianfang from the first heaven sect would get a spot, elder mu Hua from the surging waves sect could go, and the spot for the flying flower Valley would naturally go to Yang Liu. This meant that there was one mid – Stage golden core and two early – Stage golden core.

Including Xia ruofei, who was in the beginning stage of the Golden core realm, it meant that everyone was in the Golden core realm, except for Ling Qingxue, who seemed to be in the Qi refining realm.

Xia ruofei shook his head. After a moment of silence, he said,””Sect leader Chen, seniors, and fellow Daoists, I’ll also tell you a quota distribution plan! What does everyone think about this?”

Xia ruofei’s new plan was naturally different from Chen Nanfeng ‘s. According to Chen Nanfeng’s plan, each sect could only send one person. Xia ruofei’s plan couldn’t possibly reduce the number of people they could send. Therefore, everyone naturally nodded in agreement.

Xia ruofei said,”I think it’s more appropriate to go with the plan of one token for two people.” In this way, the first heaven society had two tokens, which meant they had four spots. If it’s distributed like this, I’ll shamelessly accept the quota brother Chen has given me. In this case, the first heaven sect will have three quotas, I will have three quotas, and the surging waves sect and the soaring Flower Valley will each have two quotas. ”

After hearing Xia ruofei’s distribution plan, they couldn’t help but feel tempted.

According to this arrangement, everyone had a lot more space to arrange their members.

Xia ruofei continued,”I’ll make it clear in advance that according to this distribution plan, my three spots should be freely distributed, right?” Thus, I may not use up all three slots. Perhaps only one or two people will participate in this expedition. “
