1955 Private jet (1)

After passing through a corridor, the tarmac was outside. Through the large fan’s floor – to – Ceiling glass, one could see the Gulfstream G650 business jet parked outside. The streamlined body glowed under the sun, giving off an indescribable sense of beauty.

Although the Gulfstream series of commercial planes seemed to have shrunk a lot compared to the commercial planes in the distance, private planes and commercial planes were two completely different concepts. Although the Gulfstream was small, it appeared so domineering when it was parked there.

The captain, Liu An, and Zheng Daming, along with the crew, stood in two rows at the door of the cabin to welcome Xia ruofei and the others.

Pang Hao mumbled softly,”which company rented this plane?” The service is really on point ...”

Even though Feng Jing and Dong Yun had both lived overseas before, this was the first time they had ever been in a business jet. Feng Jing said uncertainly,”Maybe this is their service process ...”

“President Xia!” Liu An stepped forward and said,”everything is ready. Please board the plane!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”why does it sound like he’s going to be the Emperor?”

Feng Rao and Dong Yun couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

Xia ruofei patted Liu An on the shoulder and said,””I’m just joking! Captain Liu, the weather is not bad today, right?”

“It’s a very suitable weather for flying!” Liu An said,”I’ve checked the weather forecast for the route. It should be very stable along the way.” Also, San Shan airport and our destination Hong Kong airport will not have too much traffic during our take – off and landing phase. Today should be smooth!”

“That’s good! Thank you for your hard work, everyone!” Xia ruofei said,”we might be staying in Hong Kong for two to three days. Do you need me to arrange for your food and accommodation during this period?”

“No need, President Xia!” Liu An said,”the Kyushu group has set up an office in Hong Kong. They have already made arrangements for us ...”

“Alright then!” Xia ruofei said,”you guys can tour Hong Kong. We should be here for at least two days!”

“Alright!” Liu An said.

Xia ruofei turned around and said with a smile,””Comrades! Get on the plane!”

When he turned around, he saw Feng Jing, Dong Yun, and pang Hao all wearing the same expression. Their mouths were wide open as they stared at the tail of the plane in a daze.

“Hey! My soul has returned!” Xia ruofei waved his hand in front of Feng Rao’s eyes and she finally came back to her senses.

With a look of disbelief, Feng Rao pointed to the tail of the plane and said,””President ... Isn’t ... Isn’t this our company’s LOGO?”

It turned out that when they came out of the security check and walked to the front of the plane, they were walking from the front of the plane, so they couldn’t see the Department at the tail of the plane. Now that they turned to the side, the three of them were attracted by the huge paradise Corporation LOGO on the tail of the plane.

At first, when everyone saw the green paint on the body of the plane, they felt that it was a little novel. It felt a little like the Qinba plane that had changed its paint, but it didn’t directly print Taoyuan vegetables. They felt that the rented plane was quite suitable for the scene and matched the positioning of Taoyuan company. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

However, when they saw paradise corporation’s LOGO, a wave of emotions suddenly surged in their hearts. If they were renting a plane from a business jet company, no matter how good their service was, they wouldn’t change the paint of the plane to the client’s company’s LOGO at the last minute!

Xia ruofei raised his head and glanced at the big Logo of the Paradise Corporation. He smiled and said,””You guys have good eyes! I recognized it at a glance!”

Pang Hao couldn’t help but roll his eyes and said,””Mr. Chairman, the LOGO is so big. As long as you’re not blind, you can definitely see it, okay? Don’t tell me this is the company’s new business plane! When did our company become so rich and overbearing? And as the director of China, how come I didn’t know about the hundreds of millions of expenses?”

Feng Rao and Dong Yun also looked at Xia ruofei.

“I didn’t buy it!” Xia ruofei chuckled.

Feng Jing heaved a sigh of relief when she heard that. To be honest, the total assets of paradise Corporation were only about one billion Yuan. Although it was developing rapidly, it was still a little too extravagant to buy a brand new Gulfstream G650 plane. This plane was worth more than half the company. She did not want Xia ruofei to be such a prodigal.

“This was a gift from someone else!” Xia ruofei continued.

Feng Rao and the other two’s eyes almost popped out.

“What?” Feng Jing couldn’t help but cry out,”who would give you such an expensive private jet?! Chairman, this ... This is too unbelievable, right?”

“Chairman, don’t try to fool me if I’m uneducated!” Pang Hao chimed in. Even the former richest man in the United States, Mr. Bill Gate, couldn’t be so generous, right? Unless ... You’re his illegitimate child ...”

At this point, pang Hao couldn’t help but chuckle evilly.

Xia ruofei glared at pang Hao and said,””I’m not lying to you! It’s a gift from an old friend of mine! Do you know about the Kyushu group in the United States?”

Feng Jing and Dong Yun nodded in agreement. As Wanwan worked overseas, how could she not have heard of the Kyushu group? Although the Kyushu group was not one of the top richest people in the United States, the company’s Chinese background was enough to make all the overseas Chinese very familiar with it.
