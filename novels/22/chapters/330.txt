Chapter 331: Three women for a drama (3)

When Xia ruofei walked out of the kitchen, he saw the three women sitting in the living room and chatting animatedly. Those who did not know the truth would never have thought that just an hour ago, the three women were still having all sorts of open and secret confrontations. ‘Women are the most complicated creatures in the world ...’ Xia ruofei laughed bitterly to himself. He took a deep breath and walked to the three of them with the Chinese medicine bags. He smiled as he handed the six sealed Chinese medicine to Jiang Yue and said,””Jiang Yue, take this medicine three times a day after meals. Your symptoms should stop acting up after two days.” Jiang Yue was already very shy in front of Xia ruofei. When she thought about the fact that the Chinese medicine was meant to treat her period pain, she became even more embarrassed and her face turned red. Jiang Yue lowered her head and quickly took the Chinese medicine bag.”Thank you, brother Xia!” From the beginning to the end, Jiang Yue did not dare to meet Xia ruofei’s eyes. She kept her head lowered throughout the entire process. From Xia ruofei’s angle, he could even see a faint blush on Jiang Yue’s tender neck. Although he did not have any such thoughts about Jiang Yue, he could not help but feel a trace of tender love for her. “You’re welcome,” Xia ruofei said with a smile. After Jiang Yue received the medicine, she mustered up her courage and said,””Brother Xia, sister Qingxue just showed us around the farm, and you even boiled some Chinese medicine for me, so ... We won’t disturb you ... We’ll go back to school first!” After saying that, Jiang Yue pulled Lu You and stood up. “Youyou, Yueyue,” Ling Qingxue said with a smile,”weren’t you two talking about some cultivation experiment problem? Why don’t you let RUO Fei take a look?” Lu You’s eyes lit up when she heard that. She immediately said,””Yeah! If Xia ruofei can grow such high – Quality vegetables, he might be able to solve our problem!” Jiang Yue hesitated for a moment before she looked at Lu You and asked,””Youyou, is this appropriate?” “Suitable! What’s inappropriate about that?” Ling Qingxue rushed to say,”RUO Fei loves to help others the most, especially when a beautiful woman has a problem and needs help. He definitely won’t refuse, am I right, RUO Fei?” Xia ruofei had no idea what was going on and could only respond with a smile. “Yueyue, sister Qingxue is right,” Lu You said immediately.”It’s settled then. Let Xia ruofei help us take a look!” Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. What’s the situation?” “You don’t need to worry about that!” Lu You said,”come to our school tomorrow! I need your help! You can’t stand us up!” With that, Lu You smiled sweetly at Ling Qingxue and said,””Sister Qingxue, we’ll take our leave then! Thank you for being our tour guide and for reminding me. ” “You’re welcome. Aren’t we already friends?”Ling Qingxue smiled. There’s no need to be so formal between friends. ” “Oh, that’s right.” Ling Qingxue continued,”your mother helped us a lot last time. Please help me convey my gratitude when you go back.” “Sister Qingxue, I’ll pass on your words.” Lu You said,”but don’t worry. I am me, and my mother is my mother. I will never use my mother’s identity to do things for myself. In fact, no one in the school knows my mother’s identity except Yueyue.” Lu You’s words seemed to have a hidden meaning. Ling Qingxue smiled and nodded. She did not continue the topic and instead accompanied Xia ruofei to send the two girls out. Xia ruofei only heaved a sigh of relief when Lu You’s car had left the villa’s courtyard. He turned around and saw Ling Qingxue looking at him with a half – Smile on her face. His expression froze for a moment before he laughed awkwardly and said,”Qingxue, let me explain ...” Ling Qingxue smiled and said,”explain what?” You didn’t do anything to let me down. ” “Yes, yes, yes! My love for you can be seen by the sun and moon! “My loyalty can move the heavens and earth ...” Xia ruofei said immediately. “Alright, alright! “Glib tongue ...” Ling Qingxue burst out laughing. “Wife, you’re not angry anymore, right?” Xia ruofei asked carefully. Ling Qingxue deliberately put on a straight face and said,”looking at you, who knows how many girls you’ll get in the future!” Do you think I can handle it?” “No, no, definitely not.” Xia ruofei said immediately. However, when he said this, he could not help but think of a few girls. For example, Lu You, Jiang Yue, and ... The hot Monica he met in Shen Cheng city ... However, Xia ruofei quickly threw these thoughts to the back of his mind. He put his arm around Ling Qingxue’s waist and said cheekily,””Wife, now that the third wheel has left, we can continue ...” “Continue, your head!” Ling Qingxue pushed Xia ruofei’s hand away and said,”I’m going back too. You can continue on by yourself ...” Ling Qingxue seemed to have thought of something, and she couldn’t help but burst out laughing. Then, Ling Qingxue strode towards her Porsche 911. Xia ruofei hurried over and said,””Qingxue, don’t go! Didn’t you say you weren’t angry anymore?” “I’m not angry!” Ling Qingxue smiled and said,”I just want to go home.” “But ... But didn’t you say ... You’re staying tonight?” Xia ruofei deliberately made a pitiful expression and tried to make Ling Qingxue stay. Ling Qingxue opened the car door and got in. She smiled sweetly at Xia ruofei and said,””You believe a woman’s words? I wanted to stay, but I suddenly changed my mind ...” With that, Ling Qingxue started the car and stepped on the accelerator. The Porsche 911 whizzed out of the villa, leaving behind a cloud of smoke. Xia ruofei smiled bitterly as he stood in the courtyard. He felt as if ten thousand alpacas were galloping across his heart ...
