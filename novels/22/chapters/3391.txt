Chapter 3392: Unexpected reward (2)

However, Xia ruofei quickly released his spiritual power to investigate and opened his eyes.

His spiritual power was like a clay ox entering the sea, unable to find anything at all.

To the naked eye, it was just a white light, which was very dazzling.

Xia ruofei could even see that there seemed to be stone pillars moving within the white light.

He was simply dazed, and couldn’t help but mumble to himself,””Could it be that these stone pillars have gained sentience?”

Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but laugh.”What nonsense are you talking about?”

Xia ruofei said seriously,”listen to my analysis!” “I’m the one controlling the stone pillar array. I put in spirit crystals to make the array work, but I didn’t do anything else. However, the stone pillar array stopped on its own and now it’s making such a big movement. If this isn’t the array becoming sentient, what is it? I’ve heard that those very high – Level arrays can produce an array spirit. Isn’t that a spirit? It’s just a different way of saying it!”

“Really? You’re not lying to me, right?” Ling Qingxue asked, her face full of doubt.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I don’t even know what’s going on. Why Would 1 Lie to You?” The existence of a formation spirit in high – Level formations is the so – called great formation having a spirit. This is recorded in many ancient books, I’m not speaking nonsense!”

At this moment, the white light that wrapped around the stone pillar array began to weaken, as if it was about to disappear.

Seeing this, Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue naturally stopped bickering. The two of them looked in the direction of the stone pillar array in unison.

Ling Qingxue held Xia ruofei’s hand tightly and said,””RUO Fei, no matter what happens, you have to stay calm. After all, it’s our biggest victory to pass this round!”

“En!”

Xia ruofei nodded and stared unblinkingly in the direction of the stone pillar array. The white light had weakened by quite a bit and was naturally not as glaring.

Through the white light, Xia ruofei was surprised to find that the stone pillars that formed the formation had all disappeared. Only nine small flags stood quietly on the ground.

What was this?

This was beyond Xia ruofei’s knowledge. He was very clear that the stone pillars that formed the formation were real stone pillars. One to two thousand stone pillars had disappeared after a few flashes of white light?

Also, what’s with this small flag? There were no flags in the formation just now.

Just as Xia ruofei was about to release his spiritual power to investigate, a line of words popped up in his perceptual mirror.

Congratulations, you have received the highest reward from the trial Pagoda’s fifth level, a set of flags of the Suan ni heaven formation! Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Xia ruofei was stunned. He looked at the nine flags on the ground.

Sure enough, when his eyes fell on the nine flags, their information immediately appeared in the field of vision of the perceptual mirror: The allheaven formation flag could be used to set up an earth grade formation, the allheaven formation. The highest heaven formation was a supplementary formation for cultivation, and its main function was…

The perceptual mirror gave a very detailed introduction, and it even included the usage of nine array flags.

This time, Xia ruofei’s array skills had improved greatly. Moreover, this was only an array method, so it was not difficult for Xia ruofei to master it. He had only taken a little look and had already mastered it.

What surprised Xia ruofei was that as long as the nine array flags were placed in the right positions, they would immediately form the stone pillar array. To be more precise, it was called the heavenly Luo array.

Xia ruofei thought to himself,”the name sounds domineering. It must be the meaning of the overarching heavenly Supreme celestial. Does it mean that with the help of this formation, 1 can become an overarching heavenly Supreme celestial smoothly?” This tone was a little too arrogant.

The stone pillars could not have appeared out of thin air. Hence, the nine array flags actually had a spatial storage effect. The stone pillars that formed the array formation were stored separately in the space of the array flags. As long as they were placed in the designated positions, a spell could be activated and the stone pillars would be released to a fixed position, forming the stone pillar array that Xia ruofei had just seen.

In addition, the array must also need energy to power, and the spatial storage function of the nine array flags included the storage of energy such as spirit crystals and origin crystals.

The user could store some spirit crystals or origin crystals in advance, so that when they needed to use the array, they could just throw out the array flag. As long as the spirit crystals or origin crystals were not exhausted, the array could continue to operate. It was indeed very convenient.

Just as Xia ruofei was about to try out the array flags, the perceptual mirror seemed to be able to guess what he was thinking. A line of words popped up almost at the same time. Please collect the reward and quickly head to the passageway entrance without delay! The highest heaven formation was not allowed to be used on the fifth level of the Tower of Trials, or it would be taken back!

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be dumbfounded. Why was this request so weird? What was this about?

However, the perceptual mirror would not lie. The information it released was timely and accurate. Hence, Xia ruofei naturally would not try to break the rules. He made a decision after a little thought.

Thus, he waved his hand and directly used his mental power to retrieve the nine array flags.

Then, with a thought, Xia ruofei kept the nine array flags into the spirit map space.

Xia ruofei was overjoyed!

Anything that could be stored in the space could be taken out directly. In other words, Xia ruofei could bring this super awesome auxiliary cultivation formation back to Earth.

The value of this formation alone was already difficult to estimate.

Even if it was a thousand or ten thousand origin crystals, it would not be as useful as the highest heaven formation.

With thousands of origin crystals, one could indeed create one or even more experts. However, the influence of the Luotian formation on a sect was more positive, and it could continuously strengthen the foundation.

These were two completely different realms.

Thinking of this, Xia ruofei’s mood became even better.

Ling Qingxue saw that Xia ruofei had put away the array flag and was surprised and happy. She held Xia ruofei’s arm and shouted happily,””RUO Fei, it’s done! You put away all those flags!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””Yup! This is the reward for our trial Pagoda’s fifth level. Those array flags can be used to set up the stone pillar array just now, which is extremely helpful for cultivation! We’ve really picked up a treasure this time…”

Xia ruofei suddenly stopped. He had a strange look on his face.””Qingxue, do you think… If I didn’t stop and study this array thoroughly and activate it with spiritual crystals, 1 wouldn’t have been able to get this reward?”

Ling Qingxue was also stunned when she heard this. After a long while, she said in an uncertain tone,””It should … Be… Like this?”

Xia ruofei immediately shouted,”this is too much!” If 1 were to rush to the sixth floor as soon as 1 completed the mission, wouldn’t I be missing out on such a powerful array? This scheme is too deep!”

“Who said it wasn’t?” Ling Qingxue felt the same way.”lt’s the same for the fourth level of the trial Pagoda. You’ve passed, but you can only get the reward on the fifth level. There are so many obstacles too. It’s really a trap with every step!”

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly and said,””The seniors who designed these levels are really…”

In the hidden space enshrouded in purple mist, the old man in the green Daoist robe was overjoyed. He laughed and pointed at the mirror in front of him, saying to himself,””Little doll! How can my reward be so easy to get? Forget about the other elemental crystals and elemental storage pearls, but this highest heaven formation is an earth grade formation. Not to mention you, a little Jindan – Stage kid, even this old man would feel a bit of heartache if 1 were to give it away!”

On the fifth level of the trial Pagoda, Xia ruofei smiled bitterly and said,””It’s a good thing I have a strong desire for knowledge… Qingxue, let’s not talk about this. Let’s hurry to the entrance of the sixth floor! I’ve already received a notification that we must hurry to the sixth floor’s passageway without delay.. It seems that it’s impossible to cultivate on the fifth level of the trial Pagoda!”
