Therefore, after the inspection of the orchard, Ma Zhiming and the others proposed to leave. After all, he had to visit his old father – in – Law, professor Tian, since he was going back to the mainland. Otherwise, it would be unreasonable.

Xia ruofei had wanted to keep Ma Zhiming and his family for dinner, but seeing that they were really short on time, he decided not to stay at the Gulfstream. He brought the unsatisfied Huanhuan to pick more lychees and cherries and asked her to bring them back to eat. At the same time, he also brought some for professor Tian and Tian Huilan.

Ma Zhiming’s family came and went in a hurry, but the cooperation was finally settled.

Ma Zhiming and Xia ruofei did not need to personally handle the specific matters such as the supply and quota. They could just let Feng Jing and the Hengfeng group’s office in the southeast province connect.

Feng Jing, who had accompanied Xia ruofei on the inspection, was full of admiration for her young boss when she saw that the Prince of Hong Kong’s Hengfeng group was so polite to Xia ruofei.

That afternoon, the sales manager of Ding Feng winery, Li Jing, personally came to Tao Yuan farm to report to Xia ruofei with the preferential conditions offered by the major cooperating super – Commercial channels.

Hence, Xia ruofei gathered the middle – rank and above staff in the administrative team for a meeting to discuss the quota.

Cao tieshu had already brought a few experienced farmers to visit the entire Orchard. Their estimated yield was similar to Feng Rao’s estimation the day before yesterday.

The lychees were about 5000 kilograms, and the cherry production reached 55000 kilograms.

Of course, the specific output would only be known after all the crops were harvested and weighed, but it would not be too different from the estimated output.

The Hengfeng group was taking the high – end route, so they had a higher compatibility with the Paradise brand. In addition, Xia ruofei had promised Ma Zhiming that he would favor the quota, so Xia ruofei directly decided to give Hengfeng Group A quota of 50000 catties of lychees and 20000 catties of cherries.

As for the other cooperative super – Commercial channels, the preferential conditions offered were mostly the same. Most of them promised to give the most eye – catching and best sales booth, and also give a discount on the channel fees.

After everyone’s discussion and Xia ruofei’s weighing of the pros and cons, they finally decided to give Walmart, which owned Sam’s Club, and Yong Hui, which was deeply involved in local farming, a certain amount of preferential treatment. They would give these two channels 10000 catties of lychee and 5000 catties of cherries respectively.

......

The other channels, as well as Xijiang Moon Club and lingji restaurant, split the remaining 40000 pounds of lychees and 15000 pounds of cherries.

After this year’s fruit quota was set, Feng Jing’s administrative team immediately got into action. They contacted the Hengfeng group’s Southeast Province Office and many cooperating super – Commercial channels to confirm the details of the delivery.

As for the price of the two fruits, Feng Jing did not object to Xia ruofei’s decision after studying the market. Hence, the price remained at 100 yuan per kilogram of lychees and 300 yuan per kilogram of cherries.

All of the business partners took this price for granted, and no one raised any objections.

This meant that this batch of fruits would bring Xia ruofei an income of about 12 million Yuan.

Although this was not much compared to selling the high – grade Drunken Eight Immortals wine or Iron Skin maple, and it was only once a year, Xia ruofei was still very happy.

This was because it was of great significance to improve the brand awareness of paradise and enrich the product line of paradise Corporation.

Xia ruofei’s goal was to make paradise a world – Class brand. If it was just to make money, there was no need to do low – profit and energy – consuming vegetables and fruits. He could just focus on high – end Ironhide Kaede, Chinese perch, truffle, and so on.

After the meeting to study the fruit quota was over, Feng Jing called Xia ruofei to her office.

As soon as Xia ruofei entered the office, he saw Lin Qiao in the office. She was looking at something on her Apple laptop.

“Qiao’ er!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you’re really here for an internship!”

“Of course!” Lin Qiao raised her chin and said,”do you think I’m joking?”

Feng Jing walked over with a smile.”Chairman,” she said,”I invited you here because we’ve finished the design for the exterior packaging. Please take a look.”

“Oh? You’re quite efficient this time!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“That’s a must!” Feng Rao laughed and said,”it’s your fault for assigning tasks so quickly every time. It’s all thanks to little sister Lin Qiao’s help this time. ”

Xia ruofei widened his eyes and pointed at Lin Qiao.””Qiao’ er? What could she do to help? It’s already good enough that I didn’t cause you any trouble, right?”

“Brother ruofei, you’re looking down on me again! Hmph!” Lin qiaojiao said angrily.

Feng Rao smiled and said,”Chairman, little sister Lin Qiao has really helped me a lot this time!” Let’s take a look at the design first!”

Feng Jing gestured to Lin Qiao. Lin Qiao pouted and turned the laptop screen to Xia ruofei.”There! Let’s see!”

Xia ruofei looked at Lin Qiao’s computer screen. It was the rendering of the box.

He took a look and couldn’t help but show a surprised look. The packaging design really made his eyes light up.

The design of the outer packaging was very simple. The base color was a simple and elegant beige color, and the main area was printed with large photos of lychees or cherries.

Xia ruofei could tell at a glance that the source material of the picture was the lychees and cherries produced by Taoyuan farm. However, after some post – editing, the lighting and visual effects were very good. In addition, some water droplets were added in the post – editing, giving it a more layered and three – dimensional feel, making people’s hearts beat faster.

The contrast between the red fruit and the beige – White background was very strong, giving off a fresh and tender feeling.

Next to the picture of the fruit was the green font “Taoyuan organic lychee/Taoyuan organic cherry”. Next to it was a row of small green words “pure natural good taste”.

The size, style, and position of these words had obviously been carefully selected. They were arranged in a picturesque disorder and looked very designed.

Between the picture of the fruit and the text, there was a green color block running through the entire side. The big LOGO of paradise Corporation was printed on this color block, and it was very eye – catching.

The front and back sides were exactly the same design, and the two sides introduced the Tao Yuan brand in green font, the quality of Tao Yuan fruit, nutritional ingredients, and so on. In addition, there was also a green QR code, which was the official WeChat and official Weibo of the Tao Yuan company.

After Feng Jing’s administrative team was formed, these channels were quickly opened and there were also specialized employees in charge of maintaining them.

Feng Jing was still very particular about the use of new media.

At the top of the box, there was a plastic handle.

The entire design looked very high – end, but it wasn’t heavy or luxurious. Instead, it gave people a fresh, natural, and simple feeling.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but exclaim,”beautiful!” Boss Feng, this design company’s standards have improved! It seems like we can have a long – term cooperation with them!”

Feng Rao laughed and said,”What do you mean” improved “?” Their first draft is still the same as before, with a lot of emphasis on color tones. One look and I can tell that it’s the feeling of a nouveau riche!”

“Is that so?” Xia ruofei was a little surprised.”The effect is still quite good after the modification!”

“That’s why I said that sister Lin Qiao’s contribution can’t go unnoticed!” Feng Jing said,”she was the one who came up with the basic idea for this version of the design. She even personally followed the other party’s designer and slowly implemented all her ideas into the design draft.”

“Swish!” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but exclaim,”Qiao’ er, I didn’t expect you to have a talent for design! This really makes me look at you in a new light!”

Lin Qiao made a funny face at Xia ruofei and said,””You still dare to look down on me!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”yes, yes, yes, it’s all my fault!” Designer Lin, you’ve done a great job this time. I’ll get President Feng to give you a big red packet to commend your contribution to the company, okay?”

“Really?”

“How can it be fake? I’ll honor it today!” Xia ruofei smiled and said seriously,”Qiao’ er, I think you’re really talented in design. Why don’t you take advantage of this summer vacation to learn graphic design software like Photoshop, Illustrator, and redesign? There’s no pressure in having more skills!”

“That’s right, that’s right,” Feng Jing chimed in.”It just so happens that your laptop is pretty good. It should be enough for you to practice drawing.”

“Alright!” Lin Qiao said,”but this self – study should not be easy, right? Sister Feng Rao, please teach me!”

“Sure!” Feng Rao replied readily. I’ve had some contact with it when I was in college, but I’m not very proficient in it. If you have any questions, you can come to me at any time!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but clear his throat when he saw the two of them chatting happily.

Feng Jing and Lin Qiao looked at each other with smiles in their eyes.

Feng Rao stifled her laughter and pretended to be serious.””Chairman, what do you think of this design?”

“No problem! I’ll use it!” Xia ruofei said,”inform the other party to start production immediately! Old Cao’s side has already started to organize workers to collect the fruits today, so the progress of the packaging must keep up!”

“Alright!” Feng ke said.

“Oh right, I’ll give pang Hao a heads up later. Go to the finance department and collect ... 2000 Yuan!” Xia ruofei looked at Lin Qiao and said with a smile,”it’s considered Qiao’ er’s design fee. We can’t let the ‘non – staff employee’ who has contributed to the company be disappointed!”

“Alright!” Feng Rao asked straightforwardly.

Lin Qiao said with embarrassment,”Brother ruofei, you’re really giving me a bonus? No need! I can’t ask for money for your help. ”

“Why can’t I?” Xia ruofei said seriously,”it’s normal to exchange labor for remuneration.”

“But that’s too much ...” He said.

“Many? I don’t think it’s much at all!” Xia ruofei asked,”what’s the most valuable thing now? Creativity! Thoughts! Inspiration! I don’t think the design fee of 2000 Yuan is too much for this work. ”

Feng Jing nodded her head in agreement. As a Senior Manager, she knew that Xia ruofei’s words made sense.

“So this matter is settled.” Xia ruofei didn’t allow Lin Qiao to decline.”Sign and collect the money today!”

Seeing Xia ruofei’s firm attitude, Lin Qiao could only nod and say,””Thank you, brother ruofei ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Oh right, Qiao’ er, give me your ID card.” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“What are you doing with my ID card?” Lin Qiao asked with confusion.

However, she still took out her wallet obediently, took out her ID card, and handed it to Xia ruofei.

“You don’t have to worry about that!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I wouldn’t use your ID card to do anything illegal, would I?”

“That’s hard to say!” Feng Jing teased,”sister Lin Qiao, I think you should be more careful!”

“Brother ruofei won ‘t!” Lin Qiao said seriously.

Xia ruofei squinted at Feng Rao and said,””Did you see? My sister knows me best!”

Feng Rao couldn’t help but burst out laughing.

Xia ruofei waved the ID card in his hand and said,””Alright, you guys can continue with your work! I’m leaving!”

With that, Xia ruofei turned around and left Feng Jing’s office.

He went straight downstairs, went home, and drove the Knight XV. He left the farm with Lin Qiao’s ID card and went straight to San Shan city.
