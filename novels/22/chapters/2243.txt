“President Xia even brought us a meeting gift!” He Jiong said,”he said that there are ingredients in it. He was still keeping us in suspense as to what exactly it is! Teacher Huang, you’re an expert in food, come and take a look!”

Huang Lei rolled his eyes.”What ‘expert in food’? you can just call me a foodie!”

“Hahaha!” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.

Zhang Xing and Peng Chang also came over curiously. Xia ruofei put the thermal container on the ground and smiled.””Teacher he, teacher Huang, open it and take a look!”

“What is it?” Huang Lei muttered to himself. And you’re making it so mysterious ...”

As he spoke, he opened the thermal container. There were three fish in the container, side by side, and the gaps were filled with ice. As soon as the lid was opened, cold air kept coming out.

Huang Lei’s eyes narrowed as he looked at the three fish. He quickly squatted down to take a closer look.

He Jiong, Peng Chang and Zhang Xing were all shocked by Huang Lei’s actions. They turned their heads in unison and stared at Huang Lei, trying to figure out something from his expression.

Xia ruofei stood at the side and watched the show with a smile.

Huang Lei revealed a look of disbelief. After a long while, he looked at Xia ruofei and asked,””President Xia ... This ... This is a Chinese perch?”

Xia ruofei laughed and gave Huang Lei a thumbs up,””Huang Sensei, you really live up to your reputation! I recognized it at a glance ...”

“That’s true ...” Huang Lei was excited.”President Xia, where did you get this?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”our company produces it!” However, these pomfrets grew up in a 100% simulated wild environment, so they can barely be considered wild Yangtze River pomfrets!”

Xia ruofei felt a little embarrassed after accidentally advertising for his company. After all, since the start of the recording, the show had given paradise Corporation enough advertisements.

In fact, Xia ruofei had the intention to show off the company’s products. That was why he had made up his mind last night. He took out three Yangtze River Chinese perch from the space ocean and put them in the freezer. Naturally, this was to fool people. After all, other than Sanshan city, the other places in the country supplied the Taoyuan brand Chinese perch with frozen water. If he took out a live Chinese perch in the capital, it would definitely arouse suspicion.

Moreover, the bellies in the Yangtze River were very timid. They would easily be scared to death with the slightest vibration. It would definitely be bumpy along the way from the courtyard to the Paradise Association, so it would not be easy to transport live bellies.

In the morning, when they were ready to set off, Xia ruofei put the three frozen stingray fish into a cooler box and brought Qin Yanan to the Paradise gathering.

The reason why he didn’t bring it directly into the mushroom house was that he was concerned about the program’s rules. After confirming that it wasn’t against the rules, Xia ruofei asked Qin Yanan to bring it over.

Peng Chang couldn’t wait any longer. He asked,””Mr. Huang, is this Chinese perch very precious?”

“Of course!” Huang Lei said,”the wild Chinese perch is almost extinct now. I haven’t seen it in recent years ...”

Then, Huang Lei briefly introduced the delicacies of the Chinese perch to everyone.

Huang Lei was indeed very knowledgeable about food. He talked about all kinds of stories and poems about the Chinese perch in the Yangtze River like a family treasure. At the same time, he also explained to everyone that it was because of human overfishing that this species was almost extinct.

In the end, Huang Lei said,”I’ll tell you about the story of the Spanish mackerel in the Yangtze River when I have time!” I have to hurry and deal with these fish. Anyway, I can promise you that you’ll definitely be able to taste the most delicious food later!”

After he finished speaking, Huang Lei closed the lid of the thermal container and carried it to the kitchen.

“Ms. Huang, please be careful with the handling of the beluga ...” Xia ruofei called out from behind.

“Don’t worry, President Xia! You can’t scale the fish, right? I know! I know!” Huang Lei turned around and smiled at Xia ruofei.”Don’t worry! I’ve studied some old recipes, so I’m confident in my Pomfret cooking!”

“That’s good ...” Xia ruofei was relieved.

The most delicious part of the pomfrets were the fish scales. After being steamed, the fish scales would soften into jelly. The taste was first – Class and it was very nutritious. If someone who didn’t know anything directly scraped off the fish scales and threw them away, it would really be a waste of God’s gift.

Seeing Huang Lei’s back view in a hurry, He Jiong could not help but laugh,”President Xia, is the Chinese perch really that exaggerated?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”teacher he, how should I respond to this?” It was an exaggeration! It’s not realistic to say that it’s not that exaggerated. ”

“Hahaha!” He Jiong could not help but burst out laughing too. We’ll know when we eat lunch later. I’m looking forward to it again! President Xia, you can rest for a while. Xiao Xing, come with me to wash the vegetables!”

Xia ruofei laughed as he walked under the pergola. He took out a bag of Taoyuan Brand Da Hong Pao and started to make tea.

He Jiong brought Zhang Xing to the pond to clean up the vegetables that had just been picked, while Peng Chang stacked the firewood that he had chopped up neatly under the roof.

Xia ruofei’s action of brewing tea was very familiar and had an inexplicable sense of rhythm. The cameraman could not help but give him a close – up.

After Xia ruofei had two cups of tea, he called out loudly,””Teacher he, come over and have some tea first!” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Xia ruofei took a while to boil the water just now. He Jiong’s side was almost done cleaning up the vegetables, so he agreed loudly and asked Zhang Xing to bring the washed vegetables to Huang Lei’s side before he walked over to Xia ruofei’s side.

“Teacher he, you’ve worked hard. Have a cup of tea!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Then, he personally poured a cup of tea for He Jiong and pushed it in front of him.

“Thank you!” He Jiong picked up the teacup and took a small sip. Then, he let out a long sigh and said,”it smells so good! Could this be the Yan Yun mentioned in the advertisement? This tea really has a special charm!”

Then, he couldn’t help but look at the transparent tea in the cup and said,””President Xia, the tea leaves are all the same. Why do I feel that the tea I made just now didn’t taste as good?”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”The tea flavor is born from the heart. Everyone’s state of mind is different, so the tea brewed will be different. It’s hard to say who is good or bad ...”

“I’ve learned something new ...” He Jiong said with a smile,”I heard that almost everyone in the southeast province knows about tea. It seems like this saying is true!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”It’s not that exaggerated. But it’s true that most Southeast people have the habit of drinking tea.”

The two of them chatted about the Way of Tea for a while. He Jiong was a professional host with a high EQ. He could chat about any topic for a while. As they talked, he turned to the incident of Xia ruofei’s forced surrender, which made Xia ruofei famous.

He Jiong smiled and said,”President Xia, I believe that many of the audience members are just as curious as I am.” How did you manage to land such a huge plane safely? I’ve seen the images in the cockpit of an aircraft. The densely packed instruments and buttons made me dizzy! As far as I know, you’ve never been in contact with piloting an aircraft before, have you?”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”I couldn’t do it because I wasn’t forced to. In that situation, I think if it was you, teacher he, who went up, you might have succeeded. If you didn’t succeed, you would have died!”

After making a small joke, Xia ruofei said seriously,””Actually, strictly speaking, it’s not like I’ve never been in contact with piloting a plane ... Those who are familiar with me all know that I once served in the Army ...”

“So you learned how to fly a plane during your military service?” He Jiong asked curiously.

The audience would be very interested in such topics as well. He Jiong had unknowingly changed from a variety show host to an interview reporter. Moreover, the change was very natural, without any sense of disharmony.
