Chapter 3805  A gift in return (1)

    Xia ruofei had already expected that Xuan Chen Zi would ask this question so he was prepared.

  He smiled and said,"Daoist Xuanzang, I've told Daoist Yuqing about this. Back then, I was fortunate enough to obtain an opportunity left behind by senior bi youzi. It can be said that senior bi youzi has imparted his teachings to me. So that night at the three mountains, I found out that Daoist Yuqing was a disciple of the Jade void temple and saw that his dantian was injured, so I helped him in passing. It can be considered as a way of repaying senior bi youzi!"

  Xia ruofei didn't tell them everything. After all, the green touring immortal mansion and the cultivation resources, magical weapons, spiritual herbs and spiritual medicines in it were an unimaginable wealth to the current cultivation world. Wealth could move people's hearts. He didn't know what kind of temperament bi youzi's junior Disciples had. Even if Xuan Hezi and the others were weak and couldn't pose a threat to him, he didn't want to cause more trouble. Thus, he was vague about the specific matters.

  Even so, Xuan Chen Zi couldn't help but be greatly shocked.

  His voice trembled as he said,"if that's the case, fellow Daoist Cang Xu ... No!" Senior Cang Xu, you're considered Grandmaster bi youzi's disciple? Then ... According to our seniority, we should also call you Grandmaster!"

  Xia ruofei waved his hand."Daoist Xuanzang, you're being too serious. Although senior bi youzi has taught me, I'm not worthy enough to be his disciple." There was no way to talk about seniority! I don't even dare to be a senior, let's just talk as equals!"

  Xuan Chen Zi also heaved a sigh of relief. If Cang Xu Taoist priest was really bi youzi's disciple, then the Xuan generation would really have to call him Grandmaster. This was because the Jade void temple had been passed down to him for the ninth generation, while bi youzi's disciples were the second generation! In this way, this Taoist master Cang Xu could be considered their ancestor.

  No one liked the sudden appearance of another ancestor, even if this person had a deep relationship with Grandmaster bi youzi.

  Of course, even if they were of the same generation, master Xuan Chen and master Xuan qingzi's attitude towards Xia ruofei had also started to show some respect.

  "Then we'll do as you say! Fellow ... Fellow Daoist Cang Xu!" Xuan Chen Zi said. He then asked tentatively,"I wonder what Daoist Cang Xu is here for? If it's something that our Jade void temple can do, we'll definitely spare no effort!"

  Xia ruofei laughed and said,"Daoist Xuanzang, I'm not here to ask for help." I've come to see how Daoist priest Yu Qing's injuries are recovering, and secondly ..."

  Xia ruofei paused for a moment and glanced at Xuan Hezi and Xuan qingzi. He then said,""I'm also entrusted by senior bi youzi to give something to your Jade void temple ..."

  Master Xuan and master Xuan qingzi had been sitting, but they immediately stood up when they heard this. They were extremely excited.

  "Fellow Daoist Cang Xu, does this mean ... Our sect's ancestral master bi youzi is still in the mortal world?" Xuan Chen Zi quickly asked.

  If bi youzi was still alive, he would be at least a thousand years old. What cultivation level would he be at? These years, the Jade void temple was like most of the other cultivation sects. Because of the deterioration of the cultivation environment, it was very difficult for them to advance. The strength of the sect was also constantly declining. If they had an ancestor who was more than 1000 years old and at least in the immortal soul Stage, it would naturally be a good thing for the sect.

  Xia ruofei knew that Xuan Chen Zi had misunderstood him. He smiled and waved his hand,"Daoist Xuanzang, you've misunderstood. Of course, I can't be sure if senior bi youzi is still in the human world. However, senior bi youzi left a message and entrusted me with this matter. "

  Xuan Chen Zi was slightly disappointed when he heard this. However, he quickly adjusted his mood. After all, the founder of the sect had specifically instructed him and this late Jindan expert had even personally made a trip. It must be a big matter and it was most likely a good thing for the Jade void temple.

  Therefore, Xuan Chen Zi quickly asked,""Daoist Cang Xu, may I know what the ancestral master has entrusted you with?"

  Xia ruofei smiled and took out a stack of books from the spirit map space. He placed them on the coffee table beside him.

  Xia ruofei had already expected that Xuan Chen Zi would ask this question so he was prepared.

  He smiled and said,"Daoist Xuanzang, I've told Daoist Yuqing about this. Back then, I was fortunate enough to obtain an opportunity left behind by senior bi youzi. It can be said that senior bi youzi has imparted his teachings to me. So that night at the three mountains, I found out that Daoist Yuqing was a disciple of the Jade void temple and saw that his dantian was injured, so I helped him in passing.

  His voice trembled as he said,"if that's the case, fellow Daoist Cang Xu ... No!" Senior Cang Xu, you're considered Grandmaster bi youzi's disciple? Then ... According to our seniority, we should also call you Grandmaster!"
