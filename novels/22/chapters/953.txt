Chapter 954: Lower your head and beg for mercy (1)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei was a little worried. After all, Tang Haoran was only seven years old and had grown up in a rich family. There were always people taking care of him. It would be terrible if he did not know how to use the bathroom equipment and got scalded by hot water.

So he quickly ran upstairs. Tang Yitian and Jennifer, who were both concerned about their son, were not much slower than Xia ruofei. The three of them ran into Xia ruofei’s room one after another.

Standing at the door of the bathroom, Xia ruofei’s slightly nervous expression disappeared in an instant. He didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.

At this time, Tang Yitian and Jennifer had already trotted to the bathroom door.

In the bathroom, Tang Haoran was holding a shower head. His face was blank and embarrassed because the shower head had been separated from the metal hose. From the condition of the fracture, it should have been forcibly torn off.

“Haoran, what’s wrong?” Tang Yitian asked subconsciously.

Jennifer’s mouth was wide open as she said,””Heavens! Haoran, why did you break the shower head ...”

“I’m sorry, master. I ...” Tang Haoran also looked a little embarrassed.

Xia ruofei chuckled.”It’s fine. It’s fine. It’s my fault for not warning you.”

Then, Xia ruofei explained to Tang Yitian and Jennifer,””Haoran can’t be blamed for this. He has just stepped into the threshold of cultivation and hasn’t fully adapted to his own strength, so ...”

Xia ruofei shrugged helplessly and continued,””He’ll naturally get used to it after some time!”

Then, Xia ruofei said to Tang Haoran,””Haoran, you can continue to take a shower in the guest room next door! Remember to control your strength and be careful. I don’t want to see you break the bathtub ...”

“I know, master ...” Tang Haoran said with a red face. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”go, go. You don’t have to worry about this place. I’ll get someone to fix it!” Oh right, remember to put on a bath towel, don’t catch a cold ...”

Tang Yitian and his wife didn’t recover from their shock until Tang Haoran left the room with a towel wrapped around his body. They couldn’t believe their ears when they heard Xia ruofei say that Tang Haoran couldn’t control his strength and destroyed the shower head.

The stainless steel hose connected to the showerhead was very strong. Basically, even if the head was broken, the hose would not be damaged. However, the position where the showerhead was connected to the hose seemed to have been torn off by a huge force. The ring – shaped metal had been deformed. It was a shocking sight.

“Mr. Xia, Haoran ...” Tang Yitian said excitedly.

Not to mention a seven – year – old child, even Tang Yitian’s strong bodyguards couldn’t tear the metal tube with their bare hands.

It had only been two hours since Tang Haoran and Xia ruofei went upstairs, and he already had such great power?

This was simply too unbelievable!

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”let’s sit down and talk!” You’re Haoran’s parents, so you need to know about his situation. But remember to keep it a secret and don’t spread it around ...”

“Okay, okay, okay. Don’t worry, Mr. Xia. We’ll definitely keep our mouths shut!” Tang Yitian said quickly.

Xia ruofei invited the couple to sit on the sofa and briefly explained Tang Haoran’s current situation. However, Xia ruofei did not explain in detail about the part that involved cultivation. He only let them know that his son was no longer an ordinary person from today onwards. At the same time, he reminded them to pay attention to the shaping of Tang Haoran’s character while urging him to continue cultivating. He must not go astray.

When Tang Yitian and Jennifer heard this, they naturally nodded and agreed to Qianqian that Tang Haoran was their biological son. They naturally did not want to see their son become an obedient person who would harm society.

Jennifer’s beautiful eyes were still filled with disbelief. She said to Xia ruofei,””Xia, could it be that you’re a legendary Eastern immortal? It’s really unbelievable that a 7 – year – old kid could master such a great power in only 2 hours ...”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Jennifer, I’m just a practitioner. If I’m an Eastern immortal ... Then strictly speaking, your son, Haoran, is also an Eastern immortal because he has also stepped into the threshold!”

Tang Yitian’s heart couldn’t be more excited. He said,””Mr. Xia, I’m so grateful to you! Not only did you save Haoran’s life, but you also guided him on the path of cultivation. I will never forget your kindness!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Mr. Tang, the path of cultivation is hard and lonely. Whether it’s me or Haoran, we’re destined to explore it with difficulty. So, to be honest, I’m not sure if this is a good thing or a bad thing. However, since I’ve accepted Haoran as my disciple, I’ll definitely fulfill my responsibility as a master and do my best to teach him well. ”

“Yes, yes, yes. Thank you, Mr. Xia!” Tang Yitian said.

Xia ruofei chuckled.”You don’t have to call me Mr. Xia. I’m Haoran’s master. You can just call me by my name or little Xia.”

“I don’t dare, I don’t dare ...” Tang Yitian quickly said,”this is too disrespectful ...”

Xia ruofei laughed,”aren’t names meant to be called?” It’s decided! I’ll call you big brother Tang!”

Tang Yitian hesitated for a while, then nodded nervously.””Okay, Mr. Xia, then I’ll take it up with you ...”

Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows. Tang Yitian suddenly came back to his senses. He smiled awkwardly.”This ... I’m used to calling you that. I’ll call you Ruo Fei from now on!”

“Yes, that’s good!” Xia ruofei nodded.

By then, Tang Haoran had finished his shower. He wrapped himself in a towel and returned to Xia ruofei’s room.

This time, he was very careful and did not destroy the bathroom in the next room.

Xia ruofei asked Tang Haoran to come over and sit down. He told him to control his strength. It was okay for him to destroy things, but it would be bad if he accidentally hurt someone.

In addition, Xia ruofei also explained a lot of principles to Tang Haoran. He used this opportunity to instill positive values in him to prevent him from going astray in the future.

Tang Yitian, who was watching from the side, was extremely grateful to Xia ruofei for teaching Tang Haoran so seriously.

Tang Hu very quickly sent Tang Haoran’s clothes to Paradise Farm. After Tang Haoran changed his clothes, the group went downstairs.

It was lunch time, so Liang Qichao called Uncle Bill over and asked him to prepare lunch.

Xia ruofei and the others had a happy lunch with Tang Yitian’s family.

After the meal, Tang Yitian invited Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao to Sydney for a trip. He also invited them to stay in his Manor in Sydney’s wealthy District.

Xia ruofei’s original plan was to stay in a hotel after arriving in Sydney and take Lin Qiao on a tour before visiting Tang Yitian.

However, the plan was always changing. He had met Tang Yitian and the others in the Hunter Valley in advance, and had officially accepted Tang Haoran as his disciple. Under such circumstances, it was not appropriate for him to stay in the hotel.

At the same time, Xia ruofei also thought that if he stayed at Tang Yitian’s house, he could guide Tang Haoran’s cultivation when he was traveling in Sydney. After all, the little guy had just entered the sect. It would be best if he could watch over him. Otherwise, it would be bad if something went wrong during his cultivation.

Hence, Xia ruofei nodded in agreement after some thought.

Lin Qiao was naturally very excited that ran ran could live in Jennifer’s house and get close to her idol from time to time. This was something that she didn’t even dare to dream of before.

Hence, Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao simply packed a few clothes and got into the extended Bentley with Tang Yitian’s family.

When the Bentley arrived at the entrance of Paradise Farm, the sharp – eyed Lin Qiao saw four or five people standing at the entrance of the farm. They seemed to be looking forward to it. Among them were the dejected Brody and Zheng Peng.

Lin Qiao turned to look at Xia ruofei and said,”Brother ruofei, I think it’s the two people from last night ...”

Xia ruofei frowned and said to the driver,””Don’t worry about them, drive over!”

“Yes, sir!” The driver responded and drove out of the farm without slowing down.

But Brodie and the others had already noticed the car driving over. Brodie’s father, Robinson, saw that the car had no intention of stopping, and in a hurry, he rushed to the middle of the road and kept waving.

The driver was so shocked that he slammed on the brakes and stopped the car, almost hitting Robinson.

“I’m sorry, Mr. Tang. Are you all right?”the driver quickly turned around and said.

Tang Yitian’s face showed a trace of anger, but he didn’t blame the driver. After all, no one had expected such a situation.

Robinson had rushed out on a whim. The Bentley had approached quickly and was about to hit him. He had been so scared that his body had turned stiff, thinking that he was going to see God.

After he came back to his senses, he walked to the door with trembling legs. Brody and Zheng Peng’s family also came over.

Xia ruofei frowned and rolled down the window.

When Robinson saw the young face in the car, he quickly said,””Mr. Xia, Mr. Xia, please let our Golden Oak winery go! I’ll definitely teach that brat Brodie a vicious lesson!”

After hearing Brodie’s words, Robinson immediately realized that Xia ruofei was the key to solving this problem. He had brought Brodie to the farm’s entrance early in the morning to “wait for the rabbit”

Zheng Peng’s situation was similar.

His father, Zheng Daming, and his mother, Luo LiMei, had gone to Canberra for business and would be staying there that night. After receiving the notice from the Maya Group, they immediately bought the earliest flight back to Sydney that night and rushed back to the winery in Hunter Valley.

He had come to Paradise Farm early in the morning,’coincidentally’ with the Robinson father and son.

Before Xia ruofei could say anything, Tang Yitian also rolled down the window and scolded him with anger,””Who are you people? Don’t you know that your actions just now were very dangerous?”

When Robinson saw that Tang Yitian was also in the car, his blood turned cold ...
