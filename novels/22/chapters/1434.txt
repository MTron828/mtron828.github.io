Chapter 1435: The hot stone pot (1)

Translator: 549690339

Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but let out a cry of surprise when she saw this.

The waiter was also scared out of his wits. He watched as the stone pot smashed towards the middle – aged female employee, his mind blank.

The stone pot looked like it had no temperature at all, but it was actually carved out of a whole stone. It was already boiling hot when cooking. The grilled fish was cooked by using the stone pot’s evenly distributed heat dissipation feature.

When the waiter served the dishes, he would remind the guests to be careful of touching the stone pot.

At this time, if a spoonful of oil was poured on the stone pot, it would definitely boil immediately. One could imagine how miserable it would be if such a stone pot hit a person.

Among the four of them, Xia ruofei was the most clear – headed and his reaction was far beyond the average person.

So, when the waiter’s hand went soft and the stone pot fell from the tray, he reacted almost instantly. He stood up, stepped forward, and reached out to hold the tray.

However, he was still a step too slow.

More than half of the stone pot had already slipped out of the edge of the tray, and its center of gravity was already outside the tray. At this time, the tray rushed upward, and the stone pot suddenly tilted down, falling toward the back of the middle – aged female employee.

Ling Qingxue didn’t dare to look anymore. She couldn’t even imagine that a boiling hot stone pot would fall on her back.

However, Xia ruofei’s second reaction was also quite fast. He quickly reached out his left hand and grabbed the stone pot.

With a clang, the lid fell to the ground, and the fragrant grilled fish inside fell out. A small amount of hot soup finally splashed on the middle – aged female employee, and she couldn’t help but cry out in pain.

However, both the waiter and Ling Qingxue were dumbfounded.

Xia ruofei had grabbed The Burning Stone pot with his bare hands! Wouldn’t this hand be burnt to a pulp?

It was only when Xia ruofei quickly put down the stone pot and let go of her hand that Ling Qingxue shrieked. She stood up in a panic and asked,””RUO Fei! How ... How’s your hand?”

The waiter was also trembling in fear. The tray had already fallen to the ground. He almost scrambled to Xia ruofei and asked in a trembling voice,””Sir, how’s your hand injury?”

He couldn’t stand holding the boiling hot stone pot in his hand, even if it was for a short time! The meat might even be cooked.

If a customer was hurt like this because of his mistake, he would be really unlucky. Not only would he lose money, but he would also lose his job.

It was almost the new year, and he was really unlucky to have encountered such an incident ...

Xia ruofei also felt a burning pain in his hand. Although he had subconsciously spread his true energy in his palm when he caught the stone pot, true energy was not omnipotent. Even if it could block a certain amount of heat, the remaining amount was enough for him to suffer.

However, he didn’t have the time to check on his injuries and asked with concern,””Aunty, how are you?”

Xia ruofei saw it clearly. A lot of the hot soup had landed on the middle – aged female employee’s back. She was just an ordinary person and did not have any true energy to protect her body. She was probably injured badly.

The middle – aged female employee was still in shock. She groaned in pain and said,”Young man ... I ... I’m fine ... But your hand ... Hurry and take a look at it ...”

Although her back was facing a few people at the time of the incident, she had subconsciously turned back when the waiter bumped into her. Hence, she had clearly seen Xia ruofei catch the stone pot with his bare hands.

At this time, the middle – aged female employee was full of gratitude, but at the same time, she was very apologetic and a little scared.

Xia ruofei stretched out his left hand and looked at it. His fingers and palm were already red and his knuckles were blistering at a speed that was visible to the naked eye.

It was not a light burn.

When Ling Qingxue saw the terrible state of Xia ruofei’s hand, her tears could not help but fall. She sobbed and said,””Ruofei, why are you so stupid? The stone pot was so hot, how could he catch it with his hand? You ... Does it hurt?”

It would be a lie to say that it didn’t hurt. However, this kind of pain was within Xia ruofei’s tolerance range. When he was in the lone wolf assault team, anti – interrogation training was a compulsory course for every member.

To put it bluntly, this course simulated the torture of the enemy after being captured. It was a real torture. Although it would not cause permanent damage to the body, the Veterans of the Special Forces knew very well which parts of the body could cause the greatest pain.

To be able to survive that kind of training, Xia ruofei could still bear with this kind of burn, even if his fingers were connected to his heart.

Furthermore, if he had not caught the stone pot, the middle – aged female employee would definitely have been severely scalded. In that split second, he did not have time to think too much and acted completely subconsciously.

Xia ruofei grinned and said,””I’m fine, Qingxue. Don’t worry! This kind of burn just looks scary, but it’ll be fine in a few days ...”

As he said this, he felt a throbbing pain on his finger. This kind of burn was throbbing in pain. Xia ruofei was caught off guard and couldn’t help but gasp.

Ling Qingxue’s heart ached even more when she saw this, and she quickly said,””You can still laugh! Let’s hurry to the hospital!”
