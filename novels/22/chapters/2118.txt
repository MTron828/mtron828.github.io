2119 The parents are not in (2)

“What?” Xia ruofei’s eyes widened.

Ling Qingxue finally couldn’t hold it in any longer and burst out laughing, clutching her stomach as she did so.

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly,”Qingxue, when did you become so cunning?” You actually know how to use this trick to urge me to go home?”

“People grow up in struggle!” Ling Qingxue giggled and said,”the great man told us that it’s endless fun to fight with others!”

“You actually dare to treat me as an object of struggle!” Xia ruofei chuckled as he moved closer to Ling Qingxue.”Miss, do you know the consequences of provoking me?”

“I was just joking ...” Ling Qingxue opened her eyes wide and showed an innocent look.”You wouldn’t be so petty, would you?”

“Hmph Hmph! “I’m so stingy ...” Xia ruofei said.”Since you lied to me, you must be prepared to receive your punishment!”

With that, Xia ruofei lunged towards Ling Qingxue.

Ling Qingxue cried out in shock as Xia ruofei caught her. The two of them fell onto the soft and wide sofa cushion in the living room.

Xia ruofei could feel the softness of the delicate body under him, especially when that pair of long, elastic legs subconsciously wrapped around his waist. He was originally half – joking about punishing Ling Qingxue, but now he suddenly felt the primitive flames start to burn.

Ling Qingxue and Xia ruofei had been together for a long time. Naturally, she was very familiar with Xia ruofei’s every reaction. When she felt that Xia ruofei’s breathing had become heavier, her heart trembled for no reason.

However, Ling Qingxue still managed to retain a bit of her rationality and said in a trembling voice,””RUO Fei, not here ...”

“I think this place is pretty good ...” Xia ruofei said as he lowered his head and kissed her. At the same time, a pair of big hands began to wander around.

“The curtains aren’t drawn yet!”

On the other side of the living room, there was a whole floor – to – Ceiling glass, giving a very wide view.

“Min River is right outside, and even the beach belongs to our family! Where’s the person?” Xia ruofei said,”I don’t think anyone would be so bored as to stare at us with a telescope from the other side of the river every day!”

In fact, if someone was watching them, Xia ruofei would have noticed it long ago with his sharp senses.

Therefore, he could be said to be fearless.

“But we haven’t had dinner yet! “Let’s cook first ...”Ling Qingxue said weakly, feeling weak all over.

“Let’s exercise first. We can eat more later!”

After Xia ruofei finished speaking, he pressed down on her without any room for discussion.

Ling Qingxue’s resistance was actually a subconscious act of self – restraint. In reality, her body had long gone soft, and her body’s reaction was very real. She hugged Xia ruofei very, very tightly ...

The heater in the house wasn’t on high, but the temperature seemed to be rising. In the winter, the villa was bathed in the spring light ...

Before they knew it, the sky outside had already turned dark. Only then did the two of them stop their activities.

Ling Qingxue snuggled into Xia ruofei’s arms. Her beautiful face was red. She could not help but feel embarrassed when she thought about what had happened just now.

It could be said that this was the most daring time she had ever been with Xia ruofei.

The two of them even moved the battlefield to the floor – to – Ceiling window and looked out at the scenery outside as well as the surging Min River. It was as if the people on the other side of the river could discover the spring here at any time. The excitement was indescribable.

Ling Qingxue pinched Xia ruofei and said,””Aren’t you going to get up and cook? My stomach is growling!”

Xia ruofei laughed and stood up to pick up the clothes on the floor. He picked out Ling Qingxue’s clothes and handed them to her.”You should also put on your clothes first! Don’t catch a cold!”

“I know!” Ling Qingxue said softly, her heart warmed.

Xia ruofei quickly put on his clothes and walked over to increase the temperature of the heater by a few degrees. He then said,””Wife, be good and rest for a while. I’ll go cook! After you’re dressed, turn on the living room lights! The sky is turning dark too quickly ...”

Just now, the two of them had been making love from the afternoon to the evening. Although they realized that the sky had turned dark, they were not so bold as to turn on the lights and continue fighting. If that were the case, someone passing on the road across the river would be able to see the situation here at a glance.

Ling Qingxue’s face turned red as she replied,”I know!” I know! Hurry up and go!”

Xia ruofei laughed and walked into the kitchen.

Ling Qingxue had already bought a sumptuous amount of ingredients, and the large refrigerator next to her door was almost full.

Xia ruofei’s cooking skills were quite good. Very quickly, he made three dishes and a soup. When the last soup was done, the mixed grain porridge in the pressure cooker was also ready.

Xia ruofei was wearing an apron and mittens. He brought the last soup into the dining room.

After the soup was served, Xia ruofei took off his mittens and stuck his head out of the dining room.”Qingxue, stop watching TV and come over for dinner!”

“They’re coming!” Ling Qingxue got up and ran over.”What delicious food did you make?” Waa! It looks pretty good!”

As she spoke, she picked up a piece of twice – cooked pork and stuffed it into her mouth. After chewing a few times, she said,””It smells so good!”

Xia ruofei patted Ling Qingxue’s head lovingly and said,””Why did you fight back? Hurry up and wash your hands! I’ll go get you some porridge. Don’t eat it secretly again!”

Ling Qingxue made a face and said,””I know! You’re just like my dad!”

After saying that, she couldn’t help but burst into laughter. At this time, she felt like her sister was being doted on like a daughter. This feeling was quite good.

The two of them finished their dinner affectionately. Ling Qingxue volunteered to do the dishes while Xia ruofei went to the living room to clean up the “battlefield” from the afternoon.

Ling Xiaotian was not coming back from Luo city tonight, so Ling Qingxue would naturally not go back to stay. She stayed over at Xia ruofei’s Villa.

The two of them had been intimate for a long time in the afternoon. After dinner, they sat down and chatted for a while. Then, they went upstairs to the master bedroom. After setting up the time formation, the two began to practice the “absolute beginning Heart Sutra” together.

In one night, the two of them had been cultivating in the array for about three to four days. Ling Qingxue’s cultivation had improved by a huge margin, and Xia ruofei felt that he had benefited a lot as well.

Of course, there was still a long way to go before Ling Qingxue and Xia ruofei could try the joint training of their spirit bodies.

It was already twoo’ clock in the morning when the two of them finished their cultivation.

Although it was only four to five hours of sleep, it was more than enough for a cultivator.

The two of them did not roll around in the sheets again. They just took a shower together and fell asleep in each other’s arms.

The next morning, after Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue had breakfast at home, he drove Ling Qingxue to the office and then drove straight to Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory.

Xue Jinshan had also specially come to the factory today to accompany Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei first inspected the busy production workshop and then came to the heavily guarded control room.

This was the core of the factory. Xia ruofei had arranged for a few veterans to guard it 24 hours a day.

In this control room, other than the Veterans in charge of security, only a few technicians in the factory had the authority to enter. Moreover, they could only use the control program and could not see the back – end code at all. It was impossible for them to crack the production process of the jaded skin cream.

After Xia ruofei entered the control room, everyone, including Xue Jinshan, left the room.

Xia ruofei used his authority as a super administrator to open the editing software of the control program and created a new program. Then, he began to input the control code according to the process he designed yesterday.

With the improvement of his spiritual power, Xia ruofei’s brain development must have far exceeded that of ordinary people. It was not only in his memory, but also in his logical thinking. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

It was not a complicated program. Xia ruofei spent half an hour writing it. He ran it in the computer and modified a few pen mistakes and complicated logic. The control program was completed.

Xia ruofei skillfully packaged the program and added a self – destruction program in the case of a violent crack. He named it “Strasberg,” which was also known as Strasburg. This program was specially used to produce Chinese medicine for breeding Strasburg geese.

After keeping it, Xia ruofei got up and walked out of the control room. He said to Xue Jinshan, who was waiting outside,””Jin Shan, find some time to free up one of the production lines. We need to test this control program. If there are no problems, we can start production directly. This will save the most time!”
