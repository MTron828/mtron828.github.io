Chapter 993: Chapter 637 – feeling like sitting on pins and needles 2

Translator: 549690339

Guangzhi Cao was so insistent, so manager Lu had to follow his wishes. However, this bowl of seafood noodles was also personally cooked by the chef, and there was not much noodles in it. Most of it was high – Quality seafood. The bowl was almost full of ingredients like big Nine – Section shrimp, abalone, and so on.

“Director Cao ...” Director sun of the health Bureau called out nervously.

Guangzhi Cao raised his head and looked at the leaders of the guilds. He said calmly,”All the leaders have arrived? Please go to the room next door to claim your own people! The Secretary has given instructions, so we’ll just wait in the room. ”

These bureau chiefs didn’t have the mood to claim anyone! Although they were confused at the beginning, the call was made by the Secretary himself. Moreover, the matter involved Secretary song. Therefore, they had already called to understand the situation on the way.

These directors were all scared out of their wits, and in their hearts, they were even cursing the few people who participated in the “joint inspection.”

They just wanted to get some information from Guangzhi Cao. At least they wanted to know what the Secretary’s attitude was!

Director sun of the health Bureau hesitated for a moment and said carefully,””Director Cao, it’s all because of our poor management that our subordinates caused such a mess. They even offended Secretary song. This ...”

“You guys shouldn’t be saying this to me.” Guangzhi Cao finished the soup in his bowl. He put down his bowl and stood up.”Director sun, let’s wait for the Secretary to finish his meal and see what he has to say!”

Although these directors were all at the same level, Guangzhi Cao was more like a leader, and no one felt that it was out of place. How could the staff around a leader be judged by their level? Not to mention that they had a favor to ask of Guangzhi Cao.

Tian Mingyi’s father, Tian Feilong, who was the Deputy Director of the health Bureau, quickly said,”Director Cao, it’s all my fault for not disciplining my child enough. That’s why he’s in such a big mess. You have to help us! Otherwise, if the Secretary were to blame us ...”

Guangzhi Cao was polite to director sun and the others, but he didn’t show Tian Feilong any respect.

Tian Feilong’s son had even scolded Secretary song today. He was the instigator of today’s incident!

Guangzhi Cao’s face turned cold, and he asked,””Deputy Chief Tian, how do you want me to help you in this situation? I can tell you that the Secretary is very angry! Everyone better be mentally prepared! Alright, that’s all I have to say. Everyone, go claim your own people!”

In the officialdom, the word “vice” was usually removed from a person’s title. This was the most basic common sense. Guangzhi Cao had directly called Tian Feilong “Deputy Director Tian,” which showed that he hated this man.

When director sun and the others heard this, their hearts beat faster, and they all looked like they were about to cry.

However, they knew that they couldn’t count on Guangzhi Cao, so they had to go to the next room to find out more about the situation.

Thus, this group of bureau chiefs walked into the room next door with extremely angry feelings.

When the bureau chiefs saw the group of people who seemed to have lost their souls, they were instantly enraged.

This was especially true for Tian Feilong. He rushed up and gave Tian Mingyi a big slap. A clear handprint immediately appeared on Tian Mingyi’s cheek. It was clear that he had not held back at all. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Dad ...” Tian Mingyi was also stunned.

“Don’t call me dad!” Tian Feilong was so angry that his entire body was trembling.”You bastard, will you only be happy when I’m dead?!”

As he spoke, Tian Feilong couldn’t help but want to beat up this scammer.

Director sun frowned and said in a deep voice,””Old Tian, what are you doing? The most important thing now is to clarify the matter and quickly think of a way to remedy it!”

What director sun meant was,”if you want to teach your son a lesson, go home. Today, everyone is in trouble because of your son. Who would have the mood to watch you act like a parent?”

Tian Feilong’s raised hand stopped in mid – Air, and he felt a little bitter. He could see that director sun was very dissatisfied with him.

Tian Feilong fiercely glared at Tian Mingyi and said,”Tell me everything that happened today. If you dare to hide anything, I’ll beat you to death when I get home!”

Tian Mingyi didn’t dare to hide anything! Secretary song had caught him red – handed.

Thus, he poured out everything that had happened today, and then said with a sad face,””Dad, I really didn’t know that this shop had such a powerful background! I ... I didn’t even know he was Secretary song ...”

After Tian Feilong heard this, his vision turned black and he almost fell to the ground.

The situation was a hundred times worse than he had imagined! His precious son had actually pointed at Secretary song’s nose and scolded him. Furthermore, these guys had been caught red – handed by Secretary song. Under such circumstances, even if he had a glib tongue, he had no way of refuting it!

Moreover, with song Qiming’s level, if he had made up his mind to deal with someone, would he need to listen to anyone’s explanation?

Tian Feilong was very clear about his own condition. He simply couldn’t stand being inspected.

He felt as if the sky was about to collapse.

After director sun and several other directors heard this, they looked at Tian Feilong and his son with dissatisfaction.

“What ... What should we do?” Tian Feilong mumbled as he held his head in his hands.

Director sun looked at Tian Feilong in disgust and said coldly,””What else can we do? We’ll wait!”

After understanding the situation, director sun wasn’t as worried as before that he would definitely be implicated in Wanwan’s incident. After all, a director was in charge of the overall work, so he had to at least take responsibility as a leader. However, with Tian Feilong standing out, his situation wasn’t as bad as he had imagined.

As for Tian Feilong, director sun had already sentenced him to death in his heart.

The atmosphere in the private room was unusually dull. No one spoke, and they just waited as if they were sitting on pins and needles.

Under such circumstances, time seemed to pass by very slowly. Everyone felt extremely tormented.

Most of these directors hadn’t had time to eat dinner yet. Many of them had been called over by Guangzhi Cao from the entertainment venues. They waited until past nineo’ clock. They were all hungry, but no one dared to complain.

As for manager Lu, he hated these people to the core, so he naturally wouldn’t be kind enough to prepare dinner for them.

Now that he knew that Secretary song was personally supporting his store, he was quite confident.

At around 9:30, the door of the private room was suddenly pushed open.

Director sun and the others looked up at the same time. They saw Guangzhi Cao standing at the door, making a gesture for song Qiming to enter. Then, the tall figure of song Qiming strode in.

After song Qiming came in, Ling Xiaotian, his daughter, and Xia ruofei also came in. As for Fang Liyun and Song Wei, they did not come in to help song Qiming with his work. They had never participated or interfered with his work. It was a habit they had for many years.

Director sun and the others stood up immediately.

“Secretary song!”

“Good day, Secretary!”

Everyone greeted song Qiming guiltily.

Song Qiming’s sharp gaze swept across the people in the room, then he asked calmly,””Everyone’s here?”

“Secretary, all the directors and directors from seven different departments are here,” Guangzhi Cao said immediately.

“Since we’re all here, let’s have a live meeting today!” Song Qiming nodded.

Then, song Qiming took out a stack of tickets and the notice of suspension of business from his pocket and said,””Comrades, this is a new restaurant that has only been open for less than a day. Whether it’s the kitchen or the private rooms, they are almost spotless. However, our so – called joint inspection team found 10 to 20 problems and even issued a notice to close down for rectification! Is this a normal phenomenon?”

Song Qiming looked at everyone with dignity and continued,””Whichever unit issued the fine, the head of that unit will come and collect it! Take a good look at the absurd reasons and basis for punishment written here! If you’re interested, you can go to the kitchen and private room that was fined by our public officials! Then ask yourself, is this how you serve the people?”

Then, song Qiming slammed the stack of penalty slips on the table.

It was as if this slap had hit the hearts of these directors, and everyone’s heart trembled ...
