Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei could not help but feel a headache. He was most afraid of Li Yifu doing this. Unfortunately, this old man was a stubborn donkey. If he really did not agree, Li Yifu might really dare to kneel down on the spot. However, if he agreed, Xia ruofei felt that it would be difficult to get over it.

By right, he was considered a rich man now. If it was something that was worth tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands, he would accept it. But that was a private jet worth hundreds of millions! It was almost half of the value of paradise Corporation. Even if Li Yifu was filial, Xia ruofei still felt it was inappropriate to accept such a big gift for no reason.

He was in a dilemma.

Ling Qingxue was the one who helped Xia ruofei out of his predicament. She said,””Ruofei, since this old man ...”

“Master’s grandmother, you can just call me foster husband!”Li Yifu quickly said in fear.

Ling Qingxue’s tone was a little unnatural as she said,””Since ... I’m so sincere, and the plane is already at San Shan airport, why don’t we go and take a look? Let’s see if you want to take a look first!”

“Yeah!” Li Yifu quickly replied. “Grand – martial uncle, if it’s convenient for you, let’s go and take a look at the plane now. It just so happens that if you’re not satisfied with the configuration and interior of the plane, you can raise it on the spot. Gulfstream also has specialized after – Sales personnel in China. They can immediately make changes according to your requirements!”

Li Yifu did not even consider the possibility of Xia ruofei still rejecting him after he had seen the plane. At most, he could just beg for it! The senior granduncle was a soft – hearted person, so he definitely wouldn’t be able to bear to refuse.

Li Yifu had a good grasp of Xia ruofei’s temper. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei looked at Ling Qingxue helplessly and said,””Alright then! Let’s go and take a look ...”

He glanced at Li Yifu, who was overjoyed, and said,””But if I still don’t want it after I’ve seen it, your plane will fly back to where it came from!”

“Yes, yes, yes!” Li Yifu said repeatedly,”grand uncle – Master, everything is up to you ...”

“Then let’s go!” Xia ruofei turned around and said,”go now! The airport isn’t far from here anyway ...”

“Senior granduncle, this way please!” Li Yifu quickly ran to the front to open the door for Xia ruofei.

Ling Qingxue looked at Li Yifu’s back with a strange expression and said in a low voice,””Ruofei, if I hadn’t personally experienced the wonders of cultivation, I would have even suspected that this old man had been brainwashed by you. He’s simply a fanatical believer of yours!”

Xia ruofei coughed and said,””If you didn’t say anything, I would have rejected you directly, and there wouldn’t be so much trouble. And, I forgot to tell you ...”

Xia ruofei paused for a moment and said with a smirk,””Actually, cultivators have a hearing that’s far better than ordinary people. No matter how low your voice is, at such a close distance, I can still hear you clearly ...”

Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but stick out her tongue when she heard that. She looked up at Li Yifu and saw that the corner of his mouth was twitching. He was forcing himself to maintain a 45 – degree angle to look up at the sky, looking very embarrassed.

Ling Qingxue was so angry that she pinched the soft flesh on Xia ruofei’s waist and said,””Why didn’t you say so earlier? Also, even if that’s the case, why did you expose me! It’s so embarrassing ...”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh. He put his arm around Ling Qingxue’s waist and said,””I’m just teaching you little by little. It’s very difficult to completely change a person’s habits of thinking. You still have to slowly adapt to your identity as a cultivator!”

Ling Qingxue couldn’t help rolling her eyes.

“Let’s go!”Xia ruofei said. Let’s go and see the Gulfstream business jet that’s standard for tycoons!”

The three of them walked out of the villa. Xia ruofei said,””Adopted husband, let’s take your car!”

“Yes, martial granduncle!” Li Yifu said hurriedly. Then, he hesitated for a moment before saying,”senior granduncle, I only brought an ordinary Mercedes – Benz. I might have to put you in a difficult position ...”

Li Yifu had been very low – Key this time. He didn’t dare to show off in front of Xia ruofei, so he had specially chosen an ordinary Mercedes – Benz.

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”I’m not that expensive. A Mercedes – Benz is considered a luxury car. Besides, it’s only a short distance from here to the airport.” If they were not in a hurry, they could even run there! Let’s go!”

The three of them walked out of the villa’s courtyard. Li Yifu quickly called for the Mercedes – Benz that was parked on the side of the road to drive over. Then, he quickly walked over to open the rear door and invited Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue into the car. He then sat in the front passenger seat very naturally.

The driver of Li Yifu’s car was from the southeast province branch of the Kyushu group. When he saw this scene, he was so shocked that his glasses almost fell off.

This was the big boss who was elusive! Even the chairman of the head office’s Board of Directors was his junior and had to be respectful when he saw him.

Now, such an awesome character had become a Lackey. Not only did he personally come to visit, but he also helped to open the door and sat in the front passenger seat. This was putting his own position very low!

The driver felt that his world view was about to be subverted.

Li Yifu frowned slightly and said,”what are you doing?” Drive! Go to Sanshan airport!”

The driver came back to his senses and quickly said,””Yes, Mr. Li!”

The car started slowly. After leaving the farm, they drove along the National Highway in the direction of Sanshan airport.

The farm and the airport were both located in Changping County, and it would only take 20 to 30 minutes to get there by car.
