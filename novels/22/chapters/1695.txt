Chapter 1696: The excited Old West (2)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei’s heart skipped a beat. Suddenly, he had an idea.”Uncle Wester, can you give me two barrels of the fermented grape juice?”

Old Wester was stunned for a moment and said,””Xia, it’s not that I don’t want to give it to you, but the entire winery is yours. It’s definitely not a problem if you want two barrels of grape juice ... But the fermentation process requires strict control of the temperature. If I give it to you ... The grape juice will definitely become extremely sour in the end, and that would be a waste!”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Uncle Wester, you don’t have to worry about that. Anyway, we’ve produced so much this year. At most, we’ll waste two barrels. Just take it as I’ve finished it myself ...”

Old West actually didn’t want to. The quality of the grapes this year was especially good, and all the wine was like his favorite. How could he bear to take two barrels out at once? However, Xia ruofei was the owner of the winery. Even if he objected, it would be invalid!

Besides, Xia ruofei did not use his power to oppress him. Instead, he discussed it with him calmly. Besides, two buckets of water were not too much, so he nodded helplessly in the end.

Old West beckoned a worker over and was about to ask him to bring out two barrels of fermented grape juice from the storeroom.

Xia ruofei quickly waved his hand and said,”uncle Wester, don’t be in a hurry!” I have a friend in Australia, and the oak trees he grows seem to be pretty good. I want to buy two oak trees from him. Can you help me check the quality? If the quality is good, can you please ask someone to make a few oak barrels for me? I’ll put the grape juice I want in the new oak barrels. How about it?”

“The oak trees here in Australia seem to be very ordinary!” Old West said hesitantly.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”let’s wait for the wood to arrive!” If the quality was not good, then they would use the oak barrels from the winery. It only took two buckets anyway! There’s no problem, right?”

Old Wester smiled bitterly and said,”Xia, you’re the owner of the winery!” Of course, there won’t be any problems with your request!”

“Thanks!” Xia ruofei said happily,”uncle Wester, we’ll take our leave first! When the oak wood is transported, I’ll have it delivered to the winery as soon as possible!”

Old West was busy dealing with the clear grape juice. He said goodbye to Xia ruofei in a hurry and went back to work.

As they walked out of the West Winery, Feng Rao asked curiously,””Ruofei, do you have friends who grow oak trees in Australia?”

“There is! I have a lot of friends!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I’m going to contact the oak tree in the afternoon. You can either rest at the farm for half a day or ask brother Liang to take you around the area! There’s no problem, right?”

“Of course, no problem!” Feng Rao laughed and said,”I’m not a child. I don’t need you to keep me company all day! You can go and do your work!”

Feng Rao couldn’t help but ask,””Ruofei, according to uncle Wester, the fermentation process has strict temperature control requirements. You asked for two barrels of grape juice, aren’t you wasting them?”

“I have my own use for it!” Xia ruofei smiled mysteriously and said,”besides, I’m not leaving them at Paradise Farm. I have to send them to a friend. Anyway, you don’t have to worry about it!”

“So mysterious. Could it be that oak – planting friend again?” Feng Rao joked.

“Amazing, you guessed it right!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”he also has his own winery. I gave him two barrels for testing.”

Of course, Xia ruofei did not have any other Australian friends. He was not going to give the two barrels of grape juice to someone for an experiment. He was going to keep them in his Origin space.

As for the oak tree, Xia ruofei wanted to cut down two of the oak trees that he had planted in the interspace. In order to cultivate truffles, Xia ruofei had planted many oak trees in the interspace. Since oak trees reproduced very quickly, cutting down one or two would not affect the production of truffles.

He also wanted to know the quality of the oak trees that grew in the space.

However, he couldn’t tell Feng Rao about this, so Xia ruofei could only say it without thinking.

Feng Jing didn’t suspect anything. After all, this was Xia ruofei’s private matter, so she didn’t ask further.

Back at Paradise Farm, Xia ruofei asked Liang Qichao to arrange for a wooden flatbed cart for lunch. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

As for the loading location, Xia ruofei said that he did not know where his friend would unload the wood, so he asked Liang Qichao to contact the driver after he had found the car.

Liang Qichao didn’t doubt him and agreed.

After Xia ruofei finished his lunch, he went back to his room and locked the door before entering the medium.

In the interspace, Xia Qing was still doing her best to manage those precious crops for Xia ruofei. Under his efforts, the medicine garden’s scope was constantly expanding. In the future, the medicine garden in the interspace alone would be able to meet the raw material needs of the manufacturing factory.

After being punished by Xia ruofei, the white fox had been very well – behaved recently. Most of the time, it was comprehending the spatial rules. This stable spatial structure, which was very close to the outside world, was like a huge treasure vault for it. It was very comfortable to live here.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”you guys can go back to work!” Don’t mind me!”

After Xia Qing and the white fox left, Xia ruofei took a saw from the Archean realm and chose two oak trees to cut down. Then, he removed the branches and vines. Very quickly, he got two logs of wood.
