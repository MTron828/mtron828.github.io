Chapter 193: The Red Dragon moving house (1)

“Brother ruofei, what did you order?” Lin Qiao asked curiously. “I ordered a fish tank two days ago. I’m going to keep some ornamental fish to liven up the house.” Xia ruofei said with a smile. “Oh, I’m not interested ...” Lin Qiao stuck out her tongue. The little girl grew up by the sea and had seen countless fish, so she didn’t really have much expectations for ornamental fish. Xia ruofei knew that Lin Qiao must have thought that he was going to keep the ordinary ornamental fish that were sold in the market. He just smiled and didn’t explain. More than an hour later, ye Lingyun, who was patrolling the farm with lightning, called Xia ruofei and told him that a small truck had arrived. It was a delivery from the wild fun fishing equipment store. Xia ruofei asked ye Lingyun to let the truck in and went downstairs to wait. In a short while, the white van arrived at the villa’s courtyard. The three workers got out of the car, and the driver took out a bill of goods and asked,””Which one of you is Mr. Xia ruofei?” “I am.” Xia ruofei stepped forward and said with a smile,”the fish tank is here? Everyone, you’ve worked hard!” “It’s not hard, not hard. ” The driver said,”Mr. Xia, may I know where you are going to put your fish tank?” “Oh, it’s the living room on the first floor. Just come in.” Xia ruofei said. “Alright,” he said. The driver and three workers immediately opened the carriage door and carefully unloaded the custom – made fish tank from the carriage. Ye linyun was surprised to see such a big fish tank. “Brother Xia, what kind of fish are you raising? Why did you get such a big fish tank?” Ye linyun asked. “Red Dragon.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”the two fish that I have my eyes on are bigger. You’ll know when I bring them back.” Xia ruofei then led the workers into the house and instructed them to place the fish tank next to the TV background wall and against the wall in the living room. The fish tank, which was nearly three meters long, occupied more than half of the wall. Below the fish tank was a black piano – painted cabinet. It was made into one with the fish tank, and the color of the sides of the fish tank was the same. Of course, the cabinet did not have a storage function. There was a complex filter system inside, which was directly connected to the fish tank above. After the workers placed the fish tank in place, they started to connect the wires and test it. After the lights and filtering system were confirmed to be normal, the driver asked Xia ruofei to sign on the bill of receipt for confirmation. Xia ruofei signed and took out his wallet to pay for the fish tank. After the driver checked everything, he shook Xia ruofei’s hand and said,””Thank you, Mr. Xia. If you have any problems with the fish tank in the future, you can call us directly. We will provide free warranty for the next three months.” “Alright, thank you for your hard work.” Xia ruofei said with a smile. As soon as the delivery workers left, Lin Qiao, who was doing her winter vacation homework upstairs, heard the noise and came downstairs. When she saw the Super long fish tank in the living room, she couldn’t help but ask in surprise,””Woof! Brother ruofei, why did you get such a big fish tank? How many fish do you want to keep?” “Just two!” Xia ruofei said with a smile. “Why did you get such a big fish tank for two fish? This ... It’s more than enough to raise 20, right?” Lin Qiao’s eyes widened exaggeratedly.”Aren’t you afraid that they’ll get lost in the fish tank?” “You little girl, you’re exaggerating ...” Xia ruofei laughed.”You’ll know when I bring the fish back!” “Okay ...” Lin Qiao stuck out her tongue mischievously. Xia ruofei went back to his room first. He locked the door and windows, took out the spirit map scroll, and entered the original space. Xia ruofei took out two of the largest tidying boxes and went to the spatial spirit pond. Each box was half – filled with the water from the spirit pond. Then, he moved the two tidying boxes to the fish pond where the red Arowana were raised. Xia ruofei then poured a small amount of diluted flower petal solution into the two boxes. Then, he used his mind to connect with the space and quickly locked onto the two big red Arowana. The space around them seemed to have frozen. Then, Xia ruofei used his mind to control the two red Arowana and moved them to the edge of the pond. Although the spatial evolution was incomplete, Xia ruofei’s control of the spirit map space had improved. In the past, he could not control the items in the space with his mind, especially the movement of living things. Now, he could try it. Xia ruofei squatted down and carefully picked up one of the red Arowana. Under Xia ruofei’s control, the red Arowana did not resist at all and was lifted up by him. Xia ruofei split his attention to control the other Red Arowana. At the same time, he carefully placed the red Arowana in one of the boxes. The other one did the same. In this way, Xia ruofei moved the two red Arowana from the pond to the tidying box. The sorting box was quite spacious, and the two red Arowana were very happy with the petal solution added to the spirit pool, so they didn’t feel uncomfortable for the time being and didn’t go crazy. However, Xia ruofei knew that the two red Arowana would not be able to stay in the tidying box for long. It would be difficult for them to even turn around. Moreover, the flow of time in the original space and the outside world was 30 times slower! Hence, Xia ruofei made his decision after a short thought. He transferred the two large boxes containing the red Arowana into the new space. In the new space, Xia ruofei drew a big circle on the ground and strictly ordered Blackie, fluffy one, and fluffy two to never enter the circle. Even if Blackie and the others didn’t have any ill intentions, once they got close to the red Arowana and frightened it, it was easy to damage the scales and other parts of the fish, and then the value would definitely be greatly reduced. Blackie, fluffy one, and fluffy two had lived in the interspace for so many days. Blackie, especially, had been in the original interspace for so long. It was already very intelligent. Therefore, after Xia ruofei gave the order, Blackie barked twice to show its understanding. Then, it brought fluffy one and fluffy two to the other side of the space to play. Seeing this, Xia ruofei left the spirit map space with a peace of mind. However, he still paid some attention to the situation in the spirit map space. This was the improvement Xia ruofei had made after the incomplete evolution. He could contact the space and check the situation without taking out the spirit map scroll. However, he still couldn’t store or withdraw items directly. When he wanted to store or withdraw items, he still had to take out the spirit map scroll. Xia ruofei felt that if this evolution was completed, he might be able to store and store items from the space without taking out the spirit map or painting. After keeping the painting, Xia ruofei opened the door and went downstairs. He said something to Lin Qiao and left the farm in the pickup truck. Of course, he just wandered around outside for a while. Then, he found a place with no one around and took out the two boxes with the red Arowana from the space. After that, Xia ruofei drove back to the farm. As soon as they returned to the villa, Xia ruofei shouted,””Ling Yun, come over and help me move these things!” Ye Lingyun quickly ran out. Lin Qiao knew that Xia ruofei had brought back the ornamental fish, so she followed him out of curiosity. When the two of them saw the red Arowana in the two large boxes in the back of the pickup truck, their mouths opened wide in unison, and their eyes revealed shock ...
