3343 A turn of events (1)

That was the situation that Xia ruofei was in. Shen tianfang had to die, and he could not reveal that he was the one who killed Shen tianfang.

Besides, Xia ruofei did not have much time to think about it. The trap & kill array would not be able to trap a master in the intermediate stage of the Golden elixir realm, who was infinitely close to the advanced stage of the Golden elixir realm, for long. If Xia ruofei let his guard down, the other party would probably break out of the array.

Therefore, in a short time, Xia ruofei could only think of using the spirit map space to avoid the mark that Shen tianfang mentioned.

After so many ups and downs, Xia ruofei still trusted the spirit map space.

As it turned out, the spirit map space did not disappoint him.

The five – colored ray of light formed after Shen tianfang’s death was unimpeded in the trap and kill array. However, after wandering around for a long time, it could not find Xia ruofei, who was hiding in the spirit map space.

Xia ruofei’s heart, which had been in his throat since the appearance of the five – colored light, finally settled down.

However, what made Xia ruofei a little depressed was that the five – colored light could not find its target and just kept wandering around the area. Xia ruofei could only hide in the spirit map space and watch the time pass.

The mission on the third level of the trial Pagoda was only one Shen beast away from completion. There was still an hour before he would break the record, so there was plenty of time. However, due to Shen tianfang’s sudden attack, Xia ruofei had used more than half an hour from the beginning when he escaped, to the time when he trapped Shen tianfang with the formation, and finally, when he successfully killed him.

Time was already tight, but now that the five – colored light was wandering around like a vicious dog, Xia ruofei could only watch as time flew by.

Even if he couldn’t break the record, he couldn’t risk being branded and leave the spirit map space at this time.

Hence, even though Xia ruofei was extremely anxious, he could only stay in the spirit map space and pay close attention to the situation outside. He would not dare to leave before the five – colored light disappeared.

As time went by, Xia ruofei became more and more anxious.

The five – colored light was fading, but it took time for the energy to dissipate. What Xia ruofei lacked the most was time.

He waited anxiously, watching as the five – colored light faded bit by bit, and time was wasted. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Finally, when there was less than ten minutes left to the record – breaking time shown in the perceptual mirror’s field of view, the five – colored radiance finally disappeared completely.

Out of caution, Xia ruofei waited for about half a minute even though he was running out of time. When his spiritual power could no longer sense any energy left, he let out a long sigh of relief and quickly left the spirit map space.

At this time, there were only nine minutes left before the recording time.

Xia ruofei carefully stepped onto the ground outside. He was relieved when he did not find anything unusual.

It seemed that the branding energy that Shen tianfang released when he died had really disappeared.

Xia ruofei could not help but smile bitterly when he saw that the countdown had become more than 8 minutes and 50 seconds in his perception.

In the beginning, he had plenty of time, but now, it had become an almost impossible task. In fact, it was just a matter of a thought from Shen tianfang.

If Shen tianfang did not have any evil intentions, they would have completed the mission smoothly and each of them would have been rewarded for breaking the record. They would have started exploring the small space on the fourth level of the Tower of Trials by now.

But now, Xia ruofei put away the trap and kill array and went to look for the Mirage beast. Even if he was lucky and found a mid – grade Mirage beast in a short time, he still needed to set up an array to lure the Mirage beast into the array and then waste time to attack the Mirage beast with the black light to kill it bit by bit. It was impossible to complete so much work in less than nine minutes.

Hence, Xia ruofei did not have much hope.

However, life was full of ups and downs. When you felt that there was no chance at all, there would often be a turn of events.

Xia ruofei initially thought that even if he was lucky, he would need to spend a few minutes to find the Mirage beast.

As it turned out, he had still underestimated his luck.

Just as Xia ruofei decided to put away the trap & kill array and was ready to make a last resort, he suddenly felt a vibration in the trap & kill array. He could not help but release his spiritual power to check it out. At the same time, he habitually looked around and also checked the field of vision of the perceptual mirror.

Just as he had turned half a circle, a line of words suddenly appeared in the field of vision of the perceptual mirror: Middle – grade Mirage beast found.

Immediately after, Xia ruofei felt the stars shift and the surrounding environment began to change drastically.

Xia ruofei was dumbfounded. He didn’t even care that he had fallen into an illusion.

It was very obvious that Huanhuan had a middle – Level Shen beast. When Xia ruofei had already given up on breaking the record, it walked into the trap and kill array.

There’s such an operation? Xia ruofei also felt that the development of the situation was beyond his expectations.

The power of the illusion this time was obviously much stronger than the ones created by the middle – Level Mirage beasts he had encountered before. Xia ruofei found himself on a beach. The sea a few meters away seemed to be boiling. Soon, a huge wave that was more than 100 meters tall came crashing down on the beach, and there were more waves after another.
