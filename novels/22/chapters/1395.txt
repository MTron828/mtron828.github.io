Chapter 1396: Chief Executive Officer (3)

Translator: 549690339

Ten minutes later, Xia ruofei and Liang Weimin arrived at Ling Ji private kitchen.

It was still the private room in the backyard that wasn’t open to the public. Liang Weimin was full of praise for the environment here. He said, “It’s not the first time I’ve come to Ling Ji’s private kitchen, but I’ve never been to this courtyard before! The decorations here are really not bad! It’s grand but not luxurious, it’s very tasteful!”

Xia ruofei gestured for the waiter to serve the dishes and smiled. ” “Uncle Liang, if you need this when you hold banquets in the future, I can help you arrange this private room.”

“Sure!”Liang Weimin nodded. At that time, I might really have to trouble you.”

Even though he said that, Liang Weimin also knew that this kind of courtyard was not open to the public. It must be reserved for the owner’s own use. It was fine if he asked Xia ruofei for help once or twice when there were especially important banquets, but if it happened too many times, it would definitely arouse suspicion.

As Xia ruofei had called in advance, the dishes were served very quickly.

When Liang Weimin saw the’ Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’, his eyes couldn’t help but light up. He said, ” “RUO Fei! I didn’t expect to be able to eat’ Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ at the last minute. You’re the one with the most face!”

“Uncle Liang, did you know that Ling’s private kitchen has recently developed a new dish? ” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

“I haven’t been here for some time, so I’m not too sure.” Liang Weimin asked curiously, ” what’s the new dish? ”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you can try it later. I promise it won’t be worse than the” Buddha Jumps Over the Wall. “” If you think it’s not bad after eating it, you can help to promote it when you go back!” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Liang Weimin knew about Xia ruofei’s relationship with the Ling family, so he naturally agreed with a smile.

“Oh, right, uncle Liang.” Xia ruofei suddenly asked,”how has brother Liang been? Does he call home often?”

Liang Weimin had a strange expression on his face. He smiled and asked,”RUO Fei, aren’t you Qi Chao’s boss? You should be very clear about his situation!”

Xia ruofei chuckled and scratched his head.””I’ve left the matters in Australia to brother Liang and elder Tang. We trust him a lot and don’t ask too much.”

Speaking of which, it had been a long time since Xia ruofei called Liang Qichao to ask about Paradise Farm in Australia.

Liang Weimin chuckled and said,”that kid doesn’t care about politics at all!” Can’t you take the initiative to report if you don’t ask? You don’t take after me at all!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh. “Uncle Liang, you’re being a bit boastful! But you’re wrong about brother Liang. I’m the one who agreed to the big strategy for the farm’s operation. Brother Liang knows my style, so he basically doesn’t tell me everything about the execution.”

Coincidentally, when Xia ruofei and Liang Weimin were talking about Liang Qichao, Xia ruofei’s phone on the table vibrated. He picked it up and saw that it was a call from Liang Qichao.

This man had not contacted Xia ruofei for at least ten days. He did not expect that the first call would be when Xia ruofei was eating and drinking with his father.

Xia ruofei showed Liang Weimin the caller ID on his phone and smiled bitterly. ” “You can’t talk about others behind their backs in the future, this is too much of a coincidence ...”
