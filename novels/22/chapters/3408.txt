Chapter 3409: The might of the formation (1)

Translator: 549690339

When Xia ruofei left the spirit map space, he hooked onto the protruding part of the cliff and kept the spirit map scroll.

The enraged goldthread nether snake had caught up to Xia ruofei again, but it was still 40 to 50 meters away from him.

Even though there was still some distance between them, Xia ruofei could already feel the terrifying aura of the goldthread nether snake, especially its soaring killing intent, which seemed to have a physical form. Xia ruofei could not help but shiver.

If Xia ruofei didn’t move, the distance of a few dozen meters could be covered in a few breaths. Therefore, as soon as Xia ruofei arrived outside, he immediately summoned the flying sword and silently used the sword technique to drive the flying sword to the top of the mountain.

At this moment, Xia ruofei had already left the poisonous fog and was less than a hundred meters away from the top of the mountain.

He stood on the flying sword and was extremely fast.

Although the goldthread nether snake was faster, Xia ruofei’s speed had increased as well. Hence, it was impossible for him to catch up to him within a short distance of a hundred meters.

Just like that, Xia ruofei successfully returned to the top of the mountain.

He didn’t stop. With a thought, he took out all the materials for the nine turn space splitting array from the spirit map space. Then, with a wave of his hand, the floating materials immediately scattered in all directions.

After two or three seconds, all the materials had arrived at their respective positions.

Xia ruofei immediately took out another crystal and inserted it into the core of the array.

At this moment, the golden thread nether snake’s huge triangular head peeked out from the cliff. Its cold eyes were filled with murderous intent, especially when it saw Xia ruofei. The snake let out an angry hiss and swung its head upwards. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

This time, Xia ruofei finally saw the huge body of the goldthread nether snake. Its body was thicker than a water tank and covered in hard scales. Even the snake’s belly was covered in these scales.

When the goldthread nether snake rose into the air, it was truly like a giant dragon, full of momentum.

If not for the fact that it did not have claws, Xia ruofei would have thought that it was a Dragon from the legends.

The golden thread nether snake flew into the air and stared coldly at Xia ruofei. Then, it suddenly lowered its head and increased its speed from zero to the extreme, leaving behind an afterimage.

Xia ruofei suddenly felt a huge threat of death.

He did not panic in the face of danger, and unhurriedly cast a spell.

The nine turn space splitting formation was activated at this critical moment.

The goldthread nether snake charged headfirst into the nine revolutions space – splitting formation.

It had been staring at Xia ruofei but the moment the formation was activated, it was as if the world had turned upside down. Everything in front of it disappeared and it felt as if it had entered a chaotic space.

The goldthread nether snake was enraged. It lunged forward and used its physical strength to break a small spatial cage.

However, there were countless of the same spatial cages, and they were layered together. Brute force alone would never be able to escape.

Moreover, the laws of space were more complicated than the other laws. The goldthread nether snake was the weakest in the laws of space. This could be said to be its weakness. Even though its strong body allowed it to forcefully break through the relatively unstable small space, it could not see through the essence of the formation. As for harming the formation, there was no way it could.

If Xia ruofei was trapped in the formation, he would not be able to see a chaotic space. He could see the essence of this small space through the phenomenon in front of him.

The chaos in the golden thread nether snake’s eyes could be broken down into spatial laws in Xia ruofei’s eyes.

Furthermore, Xia ruofei would definitely be able to see through the spatial node of this formation.

Even Xia ruofei wouldn’t be able to break this formation in a short period of time, but at least he wouldn’t be like the golden thread nether snake, who had completely lost its mind.

At this moment, Xia ruofei heard the voice of the Grand cloud scholar in his mind,'”‘Fellow Daoist Xia, can you first move me and this ore out of the formation? A difference of two thousand times in the flow of time is really a test of my patience!”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment. Then, he couldn’t help but laugh. Just now, in order to make it easier for him to communicate with layman Yuntai, he had taken out the mysterious ore from the cave in the mountain sea realm and placed it within the time formation flag of the Archean realm. Now that he had left the spirit map space and was in the outside world, he was fighting fiercely with the golden thread nether snake. From the perspective of layman Yuntai, who was in the formation, it was the same as when Xia ruofei was investigating the situation outside. It was all in super slow motion. It was even close to being frozen.

Scholar Yuntai was also anxious to know how the formation would deal with the goldthread nether snake, so he couldn’t help but remind Xia ruofei.

“I’m sorry, senior Yuntai, it’s my negligence!” Xia ruofei said as he held back his laughter. Then, with a thought, he placed the mysterious ore back into the stone chamber in the mountain sea realm.

In this way, the flow of time in the environment of scholar Yuntai was exactly the same as the outside world.

“I’m finally comfortable!” Scholar Yuntai said, and then he couldn’t help but say in surprise,”eh? The effect of this formation is much better than I thought! The goldthread nether snake has already been trapped in the many small spaces!”
