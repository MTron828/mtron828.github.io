Xia ruofei went back to his room gloomily. There was still a faint fragrance from Ling Qingxue on the bed. If it was not for Lu You and Jiang Yue’s sudden arrival, Xia ruofei would probably have gone to the mountains of Wushan with Ling Qingxue. However, there were no’ if’s in everything. The reality was that Xia ruofei was once again a loner. Xia ruofei did not mind that Lu You and Jiang Yue had returned, but Ling Qingxue was clearly holding a grudge against him. This gave Xia ruofei a huge headache. He sat on the bed in a daze for a while, then called Ling Qingxue unwillingly. The phone rang a few times before Ling Qingxue picked up. “I’m driving ... What’s the matter?” Ling Qingxue asked. Her voice was still calm, and Xia ruofei could not hear any dissatisfaction. However, the way she drove away had already told Xia ruofei that she was a little angry. Xia ruofei scratched his head and said,”that ... Qingxue, didn’t you say that you’re here today to bring the winery contract for me to sign?” You left in a hurry just now, and I didn’t even have time to sign the contract! Why don’t you ... Come back again?” “There’s no rush for the contract. I’ll find another time! I’ve been busy recently, why don’t you come to my company tomorrow?” Ling Qingxue said,”ruofei, if there’s nothing else, I’ll hang up first. It’s not safe to call while driving ...” “Wait!” Xia ruofei quickly said. Qingxue ... Lu you and I are really just ordinary friends. I’ve only met Jiang Yue by chance. Strictly speaking, we can’t even be considered friends. Please don’t be angry ...” “I’m not angry!” Ling Qingxue smiled and said,”I just suddenly remembered that I have something to deal with, so I have to go back to the company immediately ...” As if I’d believe you ... Xia ruofei muttered in his heart. “That ... That ...” Xia ruofei stammered for a long time but could not think of what to say.”Oh right! Didn’t you just promise Lu You and the others that I will help them tomorrow? I don’t even know the situation! You should at least tell me what I’m going to do tomorrow, right?” “I’m not too sure about that!” Ling Qingxue giggled and said,”I think it’s about her school’s Club. You’ll know when you go tomorrow.” “You ... You didn’t even know what it was and you agreed to it?” Xia ruofei was speechless.”How do you know that I can help?” What if I can’t do anything even after I go? wouldn’t I be blowing my own trumpet?” “So you’re blaming me, RUO Fei?” Ling Qingxue asked casually. “No, no...” Xia ruofei smiled bitterly.”But ... I ... Forget it, I’ll go!” “Don’t you like to help others? You should be very happy, especially when a beautiful woman has a request! Why do you still look so unhappy?” Ling Qingxue asked with a smile. “Qingxue, I’m not that bad.” Xia ruofei forced a smile and said,”why don’t you come with me tomorrow?” “I’m not going to join in the fun!” Ling Qingxue pouted and said,”I’m not talking to you anymore. I’m still driving!” I’ll hang up first ...” The moment Ling Qingxue finished speaking, Xia ruofei heard the busy toot from the phone. He put away his phone with a bitter smile. A girl’s thoughts were really too hard to guess ... Ling Qingxue was obviously jealous, but she just wouldn’t admit it. Moreover, she clearly didn’t like him dating Lu You and Jiang Yue, but she still took on this inexplicable job for him. Xia ruofei was also puzzled and could only shake his head with a bitter smile. Thinking about Lu You whom he was going to meet tomorrow, Xia ruofei was filled with anger. This girl was too willful! He had deliberately brought up the matter of treatment in the courtyard just now. If he had not brought it up, Ling Qingxue would not have left immediately even if she felt a little uncomfortable. At the thought of this, Xia ruofei took out his phone angrily and called Lu You. “What’s up? I’m driving!” Lu You’s words were exactly the same as Ling Qingxue ‘s. In fact, her tone was even colder. “What do you think?” Xia ruofei said unhappily,”why did you mention your aunt’s pain for no reason today? Are you trying to ruin my show?” “I didn ‘t!” Lu You said in an innocent tone,”I’m telling the truth ... I’m not making things up. Besides, I was complimenting your medical skills, not defaming you!” “Praise your head ...” Xia ruofei said angrily,”stop playing dumb!” Do you think it’s easy for me to find a girlfriend? I’ve only been here for a while, and you’ve already driven me away!” Lu You couldn’t help but burst out laughing when she heard that. She said,””Sister Qingxue is leaving too?” “Nonsense!” Xia ruofei said with a straight face,”if you didn’t mess things up, we would be fine!” “Hmph! You deserve it!” Lu You said. Xia ruofei gritted his teeth and said,”hey, Lu You, are we not compatible?” In the past, we would always quarrel whenever we met. Later on, when I was on a plane with you, we even encountered turbulence in the clear sky. I almost broke my back. This time, my girlfriend was so angry that she ran away!” When Lu You, who was driving, heard Xia ruofei mention the plane ride, her heart rippled again for no reason. Her tone became much gentler.””I was wrong this time ... You’re a man, don’t be so petty!” “Can I not be angry?” Xia ruofei said,”it wasn’t easy for me to find a girlfriend. If Qingxue breaks up with me, are you going to compensate me?”
