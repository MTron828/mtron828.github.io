2201 Entering the sea of consciousness (1)

After a while, the deck of the flying bridge was filled with a rich fragrance.

After Xia ruofei started to roast the fish, Ling Qingxue could not join in anymore. She just stood at the side and waited to eat.

The fragrance started to spread, and Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but ask,””RUO Fei, are you done? I’m so hungry ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”wait a moment!” It wasn’t the right time yet! Haven’t you heard of this saying? You can’t eat hot tofu in haste ...”

“Oh ...” Ling Qingxue pouted.

As Xia ruofei turned the grilled fish, he used a brush to apply some seasoning on the fish. As the oil dripped onto the charcoal, the fragrance became even stronger.

Finally, Xia ruofei put the five or six grilled fish on a plate and smiled.””Qingxue, let’s go and eat first! I’ll roast some more ...”

“Yes, yes, yes!” Ling Qingxue couldn’t wait to take the plate.

On the table not far away, Xia ruofei had prepared some beer.

He had actually bought them from the supermarket before he went out to sea. He had always kept them in his interspace. This time, he took some and put them in the wine cabinet on the yacht.

Ling Qingxue brought the grilled fish over. She had long been attracted by the aroma. She didn’t care that it was hot and took a bite.

The steaming hot fish meat rolled in her mouth. It had the unique taste of natural sea fish and the unique fragrance of Xia ruofei’s exclusive seasoning secret. Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but say vaguely,””Delicious!”

Xia ruofei put the fish on the barbeque rack and turned around, smiling.””Eat slowly! Don’t get scalded!”

Ling Qingxue smiled sweetly and said,”I know!” RUO Fei, I didn’t expect you to be so good at barbecuing! This fish tastes great!” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but take another big bite.

The fish had been roasted just right. The skin was already a little brown, but the fish meat inside was still very fresh and tender. A bite of it had a crisp texture, soft and chewy texture, and Ling Qingxue was very satisfied with it.

In the blink of an eye, the grilled fish was reduced to a pile of bones.

After Ling Qingxue finished one, she took out a tissue and wiped her mouth, then picked up another grilled fish.

She thought for a while and put it down. She opened a can of beer, took the grilled fish, and walked to Xia ruofei’s side.

Xia ruofei was standing in front of the barbeque rack, roasting the fish seriously. Ling Qingxue smiled and said,””Ruofei, thank you for your hard work!”

Then, she put the grilled fish in Xia ruofei’s mouth and said,””You should try your own cooking first!”

Xia ruofei opened his mouth and took a bite. He smiled and said,”Thank you, my wife!”

“How is it? Is it good?” Ling Qingxue asked.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”my wife fed me personally. How can it not be good?” It’s so delicious that it’s exploding!”

Ling Qingxue burst out laughing and said,””You’re so glib! I think you just want to praise your cooking skills! You’re going in such a big circle ...”

Xia ruofei chuckled,”cooking is just one aspect. There’s also my wife. You’ve helped me boost my spirit!” If you give me another one, it’ll be even more different!”

“Even roasted fish can’t shut your mouth!” Ling Qingxue’s face turned red.

Then, she leaned over with a beer and asked,””Do you want another mouthful of wine?”

Xia ruofei shook his head and said,”let’s not drink for now ... Qingxue, it’s smoky here. Don’t stay here. Go and eat first!” I’ll go over after I’m done with these. We’ll marinate the rest and roast them later, so they’ll be more flavorful!”

“Oh! Then hurry up!” Ling Qingxue said.

In a short while, Xia ruofei had finished roasting the batch of six fish. He carried the plate to Ling Qingxue’s side and sat down. He realized that Ling Qingxue had three more sets of fish bones in front of her.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,” wife, let’s eat here!” It’s freshly roasted and tastes good!”

” You’re so good to me ...” Ling Qingxue said coyly.

Just like that, the two of them had a grilled fish and beer for dinner on the vast sea.

Cultivators had a larger appetite than the average person. Even a delicate beauty like Ling Qingxue could eat a lot if she ate without restraint. So, ten to twenty fish were nothing to them. They were quickly devoured by the two of them.

By the time Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue had finished packing up the barbecue grill and other tools, the sky had already turned dark.

During the day, it was a sunny and cloudless day, and the horizon could be seen at a glance on the sea. The scenery was magnificent and moving. At night, although there were still no big waves on the sea, it was dark outside. The bottomless sea was close at hand, which more or less magnified people’s fear of the sea.

After all, Ling Qingxue was a girl. After Xia ruofei had finished packing, she said, ” “RUO Fei, why don’t we go into the cabin? It’s so dark outside, and I feel like something is staring at us from the sea. I’m so scared ...”

Xia ruofei laughed,” don’t think too much!” Since you’re a little scared, let’s go into the cabin!”

There was a very spacious and comfortable master bedroom on the yacht. At this time, the cabin was brightly lit. Ling Qingxue, who had been a little scared, immediately calmed down after entering the cabin. She even felt a sense of comfort.

In fact, many people had the same experience. They would sleep especially well on rainy or Typhoon nights.
