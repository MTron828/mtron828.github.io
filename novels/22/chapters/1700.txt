Chapter 1701: Testing the disciples (2)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei stepped out of the car. Tang Haoran immediately called out excitedly,””Master!”

Then, the little guy rushed over and threw himself into Xia ruofei’s arms.

Xia ruofei lifted Tang Haoran up and kissed him on the cheek. Then, he smiled and asked,””Haoran, master isn’t by your side. Will you be lazy?”

“I won ‘t!” Tang Haoran said. Master, I practice very seriously every day!”

“Oh, really? Then I’ll have to check it properly later!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Then he turned to Tang Yitian and Jennifer.

“Sister che, you’ve met brother Tang and Jennifer. I don’t need to introduce them, do I?” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Feng Rao was a little reserved in front of the rich couple and said,””Hello, President Tang! Hello, Ms. Jennifer!”

Tang Yitian laughed,”miss Feng, you’re welcome. Coming here is like going home!” Come on, let’s go in and talk ...”

Then, Tang Yitian and his wife led Xia ruofei and Feng Jing into the villa.

The group came to the living room of the rich and beautiful palace on the first floor. Tang Yitian said to Xia ruofei,””The servants are preparing dinner. We’ll take a rest here first. Two elders will come over later, and I’ll introduce you to them!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded,”sure!” We’ll listen to big brother Tang’s arrangements when we arrive at the sethany!”

Then, Xia ruofei patted Tang Haoran, who had been leaning on him, and said,””Haoran, come, let master check your homework!”

Feng Rao had already known that Xia ruofei had taken Tang Haoran as his disciple when she was in the capital. However, she did not know what Xia ruofei had taught Tang Haoran. After thinking about it, she felt that it was probably martial arts. After all, Xia ruofei had retired from the Army and Feng Rao had seen his skills before.

However, Feng Rao could not understand why a rich kid like Tang Haoran wanted to learn martial arts from Xia ruofei.

Now that Xia ruofei wanted to test Tang Haoran, Feng Rao could not help but feel curious.

“Ruofei, shall we leave for a while?” Tang Yitian said.

Tang Yitian wasn’t like Feng Rao. He had long realized how precious the cultivation technique that Xia ruofei had passed on to Tang Haoran was. At the same time, he also paid great attention to the confidentiality that Xia ruofei had asked him to keep.

When he was at home, he never asked Tang Haoran about cultivation. He knew that there were some things that he could not pry into no matter how curious he was.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”no need!” I’m just testing Haoran’s cultivation. I didn’t teach him anything new ...”

Then, Xia ruofei turned to Tang Haoran and said seriously,””Haoran, extend your left hand!”

Tang Haoran obediently stretched out his hand. Xia ruofei casually placed it on his hand and released some essential Qi. She quickly scanned Tang Haoran’s meridians and quickly understood his cultivation level.

Xia ruofei was surprised. It seemed that the little guy was not lying. He must have been cultivating very hard these few months because Xia ruofei realized that Tang Haoran’s cultivation had already reached the peak of Qi disciple Level 1. It seemed that he could break through to Qi disciple Level 2 at any time.

This cultivation speed seemed to be much slower than Song Wei ‘s. However, Song Wei had been cultivating in the time formation all this time. Most importantly, Song Wei had a unique cultivation resource like spiritual crystals. She could cultivate without any worries and Xia ruofei would help her from the side.

On the other hand, Tang Haoran could only cultivate for four hours every day at midnight and Mao. Moreover, the spiritual energy of heaven and earth was so thin. How could it be compared to the almost inexhaustible spiritual crystals?

To be able to steadily reach the peak of Qi disciple Level 1 in just a few months, one could only say that Tang Haoran’s talent was really very strong, and he must have worked hard enough.

Xia ruofei was very satisfied,”not bad!” It seems that Haoran really didn’t slack off ...”

“I’m the most obedient to master!”Tang Haoran said proudly. He persevered in his cultivation every day! He didn’t even rest for the new year ...”

“Not bad, not bad!” Xia ruofei patted Tang Haoran’s head and smiled.”I’ll give you a reward later! I’m also going to teach you the second level of the mental cultivation method. You should be able to break through soon ...”

Feng Rao was in disbelief when she saw that Xia ruofei’s so – called “test” on Tang Haoran was just like a traditional Chinese Medicine doctor checking his pulse.

Tang Haoran and Jennifer, on the other hand, were already used to it. They were quite happy to hear Xia ruofei’s words.

“Ruofei, thank you for your hard work!” Tang Yitian said.

“Hey! What’s there to be troubled about! After I taught him, I didn’t care about anything else!” Xia ruofei said,”I’d be willing to have another dozen Haoran, such a worry – Free disciple!”

“Hahaha!” Tang Yitian laughed.

“Xia, don’t praise him too much,” Jennifer said.”Be careful of Haoran’s pride!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”my disciple performed well, so I have to praise her to death!” Haoran won’t be proud, right?”

He rubbed Tang Haoran’s hair as he spoke. Tang Haoran raised his head and said,””Mm! Haoran is very modest!”

“Hahaha!” The adults all laughed heartily.

Everyone sat in the living room and drank tea for a while before they heard the sound of a car outside.

Tang Yitian immediately stood up and said,””Maybe my two elders have arrived. I’ll go out and pick them up!”

Xia ruofei thought for a while. Tang Yitian’s elder was here, so it didn’t seem appropriate for him to sit in the living room. He stood up and said,””Let’s go together!”

The group walked out of the villa and saw two old men getting out of a black Mercedes – Benz. Both of them were wearing traditional Tang suits. Their hair was almost all white, but they were in high spirits.

Seeing this, Tang Yitian quickly walked up to him and said,””Grandpa li! Uncle Xu! You’ve had a long journey!”

Xia ruofei was a little surprised. He thought that the two old men were about the same age, but hearing Tang Yitian call them that, it was obvious that they were of different generations.

Besides, Xia ruofei could clearly feel that one of the old men seemed to have genuine Qi circulating in his body. He was obviously a cultivator.

This was the first time Xia ruofei had seen other cultivators. He couldn’t help but take a second look at the old man.

The old man seemed to have felt something. His eyes swept over Xia ruofei like lightning, and then he laughed at Tang Yitian,””Yi Tian! You seem to be in good spirits!”

“Grandpa li, Yitian doesn’t have any talent for cultivation, so I can only put in more effort in taking care of my body ...” Tang Yitian said respectfully.

Then, Tang Yitian turned to another old man and asked,””Uncle Xu, was your journey smooth?”

“We’ve used your private jet and even applied for an exclusive route,” uncle Xu said with a smile.”What’s not going well?”

“That’s good!” Tang Yitian said,”Oh right, let me introduce you two. This is ...”

“Yitian, if I’m not wrong, this should be Haoran’s master, Mr. Xia, right?” Uncle Xu didn’t wait for Tang Yitian’s introduction, but interrupted him.

Xia ruofei smiled and took a step forward.””Junior Xia ruofei greets the two seniors!”

“You’re young and promising!” Uncle Xu praised.

Uncle Xu didn’t have any cultivation, but Grandpa li could sense Xia ruofei’s cultivation aura. He looked at Xia ruofei deeply and smiled.””Brother Xia isn’t as simple as being young and promising! At least, among the young people I know, there’s no one who can reach brother Xia’s level!”

Tang Yitian couldn’t help but feel a little embarrassed when Grandpa li kept calling him “brother Xia.” In his heart, he thought that the seniority in the family was all messed up.

He didn’t know that there was more chaos to come ...

Tang Yitian said to Xia ruofei,”ruofei, this is Li Yifu, Grandpa li. He’s a senior in the United States Hong sect.” This is our Australia’s righteous Association’s senior, Xu Ziyuan, uncle Xu. Both of you are seniors that I respect very much!”

Li Yifu said with a smile,”Yitian, don’t stand at the door. Let’s go inside and talk!” I’m going to have a good chat with brother Xia later!”L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎
