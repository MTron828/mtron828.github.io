Chapter 3382: The third part of the mission Part 2

Translator: 549690339

It was also the formation he had used to deal with the star Fern thorn ring.

Xia ruofei realized that they were running out of time, so he stopped for a few seconds and used his spiritual power to scan the surroundings.

In the end, Xia ruofei realized that the star Fern thorns were rather densely distributed within this one to two kilometer radius. It was much better than the previous situation where there might only be one or two star Fern thorns within a few kilometers.

There was not much time left. Even if Xia ruofei used his speed to the maximum, he could only see 40 to 50 star Fern thorns at most. If these mere 40 to 50 star Fern thorns just happened to produce a special star Fern thorn that could drop soul essence, then he would be really lucky.

However, Xia ruofei did a rough calculation. Based on the formation that he had, which could cover a maximum range of three kilometers, he could really carve out an area with a radius of two to three kilometers, which could cover at least a thousand star Fern thorns.

With this calculation, it would definitely be more appropriate to use an area attack.

Therefore, the same two formations with different settings and requirements could have completely opposite answers.

Xia ruofei rode on the qushuang flying sword and shuttled through the area of two to three kilometers. He set up the area – of – effect fire array in the shortest time possible.

At this moment, there were less than five minutes left on the mission time.

Xia ruofei threw out the crystals without hesitation and activated the array.

This time, the range of the formation was expanded to a radius of nearly three kilometers in order to cover as many star Fern thorns as possible.

However, this way, the difficulty of setting up the formation and the consumption of the formation would be greatly increased.

Fortunately, Xia ruofei’s knowledge of arrays was very solid and he was not short of money. He did not care about the short – term consumption of the array, so he set up the array very quickly.

After the formation was activated, the blazing flames seemed to have a life of their own, constantly squeezing towards the center.

The star Fern thorns within this attack range were also alarmed, and sensing that their lives were threatened, they frantically shot out date thorns. The whistling sound of the wind rang out in the fluttering flames, and the entire array’s range was almost covered by the date thorns.

Xia ruofei, who had already retreated to a safe distance, gently held Ling Qingxue’s hand. The two of them did not move.

Xia ruofei looked at the wolves in front of him, feeling very complicated. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

At this time, in the field of vision of his perceptual mirror, he could still see the countdown in the mission bar. It was flashing second by second, and there were only two minutes left until the end of the mission.

Xia ruofei was very familiar with the power of this formation. He was not worried that he would not be able to deal with the star Fern thorn in the formation within this short period of time. According to his prediction, the star Fern thorn in the formation would be completely dormant in at most one minute.

The biggest problem now was that burning all these star Fern thorns would most likely be useless.

There were too few special star Fern thorns that could drop a soul essence. Previously, Xia ruofei had to search non – stop for about an hour before he could find one. He had just found one ten minutes ago. There were hundreds of star Fern thorns in this area, and there were at most a thousand star Fern thorns. He did not have time to check them out and immediately started setting up the array. The probability of a star Fern thorn dropping a soul essence was too low.

Ling Qingxue’s palms started to sweat as well. She subconsciously held Xia ruofei’s hand tightly, as if this would give Xia ruofei some strength.

In the array, the star Fern thorn’s attack quickly weakened. In about a minute, the star Fern thorn had completely stopped attacking. However, Xia ruofei’s judgment was still very accurate.

He waited for another thirty seconds or so. There was no point in fighting for time now, so he might as well let the star Fern thorns burn more fully.

When there were 30 seconds left on the mission time, Xia ruofei made a gesture and stopped the array.

He didn’t even have time to collect the materials for the formation. He directly stepped on the qushuang flying sword and flew five or six meters high. Then, he waved his hand from above, and the ashes of the Burning Star Fern thorn immediately scattered with the wind.

It was difficult for Xia ruofei to use his Yuan Qi to attack from a distance within a three – kilometer radius. However, it was not a problem to just fan away some ashes.

Then, Xia ruofei started to search the area with the formation.

Ling Qingxue also clenched her fists, her eyes wide open as she searched the array.

When there were only ten seconds left on the mission time, Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue’s bodies trembled slightly at the same time. Their eyes locked onto the same direction almost at the same time.

About a kilometer away from Xia ruofei, a Black Star Fern soul essence was lying quietly on the barren land, still emitting a scorching aura.

Xia ruofei’s breathing became heavier and his face could not help but reveal an overjoyed expression.

“RUO Fei! Star Fern thorn soul essence! Hurry up and put it away!” Ling Qingxue also shouted excitedly.

In fact, when Ling Qingxue had warned him, Xia ruofei had already reached out his hand and grabbed at the air. The star Fern thorn soul essence, supported by Xia ruofei’s spiritual power, shot towards him quickly.

Three seconds later, Xia ruofei had the star Fern thorn soul essence in his hand.

The progress bar of the perceptual mirror finally jumped to 10/10!

Xia ruofei even took the time to glance at the countdown. There were only five seconds left on the mission time!

Xia ruofei heaved a long sigh of relief. It was as if all the energy in his body had been sapped away. His entire body relaxed.

He controlled the qushuang flying sword to lower its altitude. Just now, in order to have a better view and to clear away the ashes of the star Fern thorn as soon as possible, he had flown to an altitude of five or six meters. This was already unprecedented. Under normal circumstances, he would fly close to the ground when he rode the sword. The reason was that he had felt a sense of danger when he had flown to the top of the tree.

Ling Qingxue, who had been waiting on the ground, was already jumping up and down in joy. Her eyes were filled with tears of excitement.

This mission was really not easy! Although Ling Qingxue was unable to help, she had witnessed the entire process of Xia ruofei’s mission. His unyielding spirit made Ling Qingxue even more fascinated with Xia ruofei. At this moment, she was acting like a little fangirl who had just seen her idol.

“RUO Fei! That’s great!” Ling Qingxue was still very excited. The moment Xia ruofei landed on the ground, she pounced on him and hugged him tightly. She even took the initiative to kiss Xia ruofei’s face.”You’re the best!”

At this moment, the countdown to the second part of the mission had ended.

However, it was obvious that Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue had been determined to have completed this part of the mission. Hence, the two of them remained in this wasteland and were not directly transported out.

“That was really close this time!” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but sigh.”Luckily, luck is on our side in the end!”

“There’s nothing wrong with that!” Ling Qingxue giggled and said,”I really got the last soul essence by luck!”

“No matter how we got it, we have completed our mission!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

At this moment, in the field of vision of the perceptual mirror, words began to pop up on the mission bar. Xia ruofei quickly looked at it.

When Ling Qingxue saw Xia ruofei’s expression, she knew that there was a new message on the perceptual mirror. She did not disturb Xia ruofei and just held his arm, waiting quietly.

There were many words rolling in the mission prompt bar. Congratulations! He had successfully completed the second part of the task and collected 10 star Fern thorn soul essence. The third and last part of the chain mission on the fifth level of the Tower of Trials had been successfully activated! Please head to the designated location according to the map. The third round of the mission will be officially released there!

After Xia ruofei finished reading the text, he said to Ling Qingxue,””Qingxue, we’ve completed the second part of the mission without any mishaps. Now that the third part of the mission has started, I hope that our good luck won’t slip away…”

Ling Qingxue asked nervously,””Has the third part of the mission been released? What was the specific content? Are you in a hurry?”
