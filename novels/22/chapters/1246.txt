Chapter 1247: A perfect ending (2)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei passed the microphone to the staff and walked down the stage confidently. He returned to his seat.

Xia ruofei’s last words were discussed with MA Xiong. Such a top auction could easily create a brand effect. Moreover, Hengfeng group was indeed an excellent partner, which was beneficial to both parties. Therefore, in the future, if there were no accidents, Xia ruofei would choose Hengfeng auction house as his first partner for items that needed to be auctioned like top – grade abalones and top – grade truffles.

After hearing Xia ruofei’s words, many of them became very excited.

Many people had returned empty – handed today. There was no other way. There were too many monks and too few gruel. Those who had come to the auction were basically the elites of the high – end food and beverage industry or the rich who loved truffles. Xia ruofei’s words had clearly indicated that today’s truffle auction would not be the last. There would be a second and third truffle – picking season ...

To the buyers who were secretly disappointed, this was great news!

Therefore, the applause this time was even more enthusiastic.

After Xia ruofei left the stage, Lu zhongguang, who had just taken a few sips of water, returned to the stage.

The auction for the last truffle was still hosted by him.

“Ladies and gentlemen, we meet again!” Lu zhongguang made a small joke and then went straight to the point.”Entrusted by Mr. Xia, we will add a truffle to the auction. This white truffle weighs 1.12 kilograms. The starting price is 100000 US dollars! Although everyone already knows, I still have to remind you that Mr. Xia will donate all the proceeds from the auction of this white truffle to the Hong Kong Charity Association! Now, everyone can start bidding!”

” 150000 dollars!”

” 180 thousand dollars!”

” 200000 dollars!”

” 230000 dollars!”

......

Lu zhongguang’s voice had just fallen when the bidding began one after another. He did not even have the time to repeat the price.

The reaction to the truffle was much more enthusiastic than when it first appeared, and it quickly broke the last “normal price” of the previous auction. At that time, the bid was called for 210000 dollars, and then the price became extremely unreasonable as Blake raised his sign.

On one hand, this was the last truffle, and compared to those that were more than two kilograms, the threshold was much lower, so the buyers who had not gotten any before were all bidding.

On the other hand, the truffle was being auctioned for charity, and the final buyer would also be contributing to charity. Moreover, it could be on the news, so everyone’s enthusiasm for buying was naturally different.

In the end, the White truffle was sold for 320000 US dollars, which was far more than its actual value.

The winner was Nicolay, a wealthy man from Romania who had participated in the bid for the final truffle.

Nikola had gained nothing before. Although the truffle was only 1.12 kilograms, he would be pleased to get it. At least he did not return empty – handed.

Moreover, he could also win a good reputation for charity, so Nicolay was very happy after the successful bid, and even stood up to express his gratitude to the people around him who congratulated him. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

The auction came to a perfect end! Other than the White truffle he contributed to a charity in Hong Kong, the rest of the truffles were sold for a total of 17.644 million US dollars.

Xia ruofei insisted on paying the auction Commission according to the market price, which included a 10% commission, 3% tax, 1% insurance, catalog, and other miscellaneous fees. Xia ruofei’s net income was more than 15 million USD.

Xia ruofei did not need to personally take part in the delivery of the auction items and other clean – up work. Feng Jing’s team and the Hengfeng auction house’s team would naturally handle it well.

Xia ruofei followed MA Xiong to the resting Hall next to the auction hall. Although he wanted to stay with Monica, there were too many people present. Besides, MA Xiong had to introduce him to some of the Hong Kong socialites. So, he could only give Monica a look and left the auction hall first.

At noon, MA Xiong would host a banquet for his old friends at Hengfeng Jiahua Hotel. It wasn’t lunchtime yet, so everyone was arranged to stay in this lounge.

When MA Xiong led Xia ruofei in, there were already many people chatting in the lounge with glasses of red wine.

“Mr. MA, Mr. Xia, both of you have gained both fame and fortune today!”

“Congratulations! The auction was a huge success!”

“Heroes really come from youngsters! We old people admire Xia Sheng very much!”

Many people came up to him enthusiastically.

MA Xiong also introduced them to Xia ruofei with a smile.

The real estate magnate of Hong Kong, Guo Hongjiang, and the rich man, Zheng jianian, who had been very active in bidding at the auction today, were all present to urge the rich people of their level to take care of the delivery of the auction items and such.

Guo Hongjiang, Zheng jianian, and the others were also very enthusiastic about Xia ruofei.

Especially old master Zheng. He held Xia ruofei’s hands and said,””Xia Sheng, you’ve really brought honor to the Chinese today! When those foreigners saw our top – grade truffles, they looked like they had seen a ghost!”

“You’re too flattering!” Xia ruofei said politely.

“Hahaha!” Guo Hongjiang also laughed heartily.”I’ve wanted to attend the abalone auction the last time, but something happened at the company and I couldn’t attend! It’s a good thing I didn’t miss the truffle auction this time!”

MA Xiong teased,”director Guo, you’re not just saying that you didn’t miss anything.” Even the biggest white truffle in the finale has been taken by you. Even I’m envious!”

Guo Hongjiang glanced at MA Xiong and said,””Chairman MA, you’re so close to Mr. Xia. If you want truffles, do you have to fight with us at the auction?”

“Who wouldn’t want too much truffles?” MA Xiong laughed.

“Good job, MA Laosi! He’s been like this since he was young, insatiable and greedy!” Guo Hongjiang scolded jokingly.

Xia ruofei could tell that this real estate tycoon had a good personal relationship with MA Xiong. The way they spoke was very casual, and it was obvious that they were old friends.

MA Xiong laughed and said to Xia ruofei,””Xia Sheng, you should get closer to director Guo. He’s not only the boss of Hong Kong’s real estate industry, but also a director of the Hong Kong horse race! In Hong Kong, his words are more powerful than mine!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be moved.

Hong Kong’s horse race was one of the largest running organizations in the world. It was also approved by the special region government to legally run the horse race. The entire horse race was controlled by the Board of Directors, which consisted of 12 directors. Each director was a very prestigious person in Hong Kong Society. Although this was a voluntary position and there was no remuneration, it was a manifestation of social status in Hong Kong.

“Mr. Xia, if you like horse racing, we can have more exchanges ...” Guo Hongjiang said with a smile.

“I don’t know much about horse racing.” Xia ruofei said half – jokingly.

“Chairman Guo,” MA Xiong said with a smile.”Xia Sheng doesn’t know much about horse racing, but if there’s any health problem with the horses, he might be able to help!”

Guo Hongjiang raised his eyebrows and said,”Oh?” Does Xia Sheng have any experience in raising horses?”

“I’m not sure if Xia Sheng has ever raised a horse before, but his medical skills are simply too brilliant!”MA Xiong laughed out loud. I don’t think the health of ordinary horses will be a problem for Xia Sheng!”

Xia ruofei and Guo Hongjiang smiled bitterly at the same time.

“Chairman MA, are you making fun of me?” Guo Hongjiang pretended to be angry.

“Mr. MA, I’m studying Traditional Chinese Medicine, not a vet ...” Xia ruofei smiled bitterly.
