Chapter 76: Reaching an agreement (1)

Ruan Fugui couldn’t help but rub his hands. He hesitated and said,” “Mr. Xia, the market price is about 3800 Yuan per mu, but you’re personally introduced by Mayor Wu. So, 3500 Yuan per mu ...” When he said this, ruan Fugui sneaked a glance at Wu Gang, who hadn’t said anything the entire time. He saw Wu Gang’s brows furrow without a trace, so ruan Fugui quickly changed his words and said,” “Every mu ... Three thousand three hundred, no! What do you think of 3200?” At this moment, Wu Gang’s expression had returned to normal. There was even a faint smile on his face. Ruan Fugui secretly heaved a sigh of relief when he saw this. It wasn’t easy for him to be a village official. If the rent was too cheap, the villagers would definitely not do it. But if the rent was too expensive, the leader would not be satisfied. Fortunately, the price of 3200 Yuan was clearly acceptable to Wu Gang, and the village could barely accept it. Xia ruofei had seen all of this. Before he came, he had also checked the rental price of land in Changping County. In the coastal areas, this price was considered quite favorable. Hence, he nodded and said,” “Sure.” Ruan Fugui smiled and said,” “Mr. Xia, this is the price of the land. It’s much cheaper to buy a mountain forest. The soil and water in our mountain forest are average, so ... 1500 Yuan per mu a year, is that okay?” Xia ruofei said readily,” “Alright! We’ll go with your price!” Ruan Fugui said happily,” “As long as Mr. Xia is satisfied! This piece of land is a total of 28.3 mu, so let’s take it as 28 mu! The annual rent is 89600 Yuan, and the mountain forest is about 15 mu, so the annual rent is 22500 Yuan. The total annual rent is 112100 Yuan, is that okay?” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but take another look at ruan Fugui. This old man didn’t look very good, but his brain worked very quickly. Although it was just simple math, he was indeed capable to be able to calculate it so quickly. To be able to become the village director, he definitely had some skill. “No problem!” Xia ruofei nodded and said,”uncle ruan, I’ve even brought the company seal. Let’s sign the contract!” “Alright, alright!” Ruan Fugui quickly said. Then, he called the village Accountant and asked him to come over immediately. There was a computer in the village council with the model contract of the previous rented land. He could just pull it out and modify the parameters. However, only the young accountants in the village council knew how to use a computer. At this time, Wu Gang, who had not clearly interfered with the negotiations, smiled and said,” “Lao ruan, since Mr. Xia is planning to develop a farm in Dongkeng village, should we extend the lease period?” Ruan Fugui said,” “Mayor Wu, our lease is usually for three years, and in principle, it can’t exceed five years. But since you’ve spoken, then ... What do you think about the contract lasting eight years?” Wu Gang smiled and looked at Xia ruofei, asking for his opinion. Xia ruofei also knew that Wu Gang was helping him. He immediately nodded and said,” “Alright. Uncle ruan, I can’t take advantage of the village. If we sign an eight – year contract, the annual rent will be increased by 5% on the basis of the previous year! In addition, I hope to write a clause in the contract that our company will have the priority to lease the land under the same conditions when the contract expires. ” Ruan Fugui had thought that the eight – year lease would end immediately, so he felt a little heartache. When he heard Xia ruofei suggest an increase in rent, he immediately smiled and said,” “No problem, no problem!” Everyone waited for a while, and the village Accountant arrived at the village council. There was a ready – made lease contract on the computer. After some changes to the rent, terms, and conditions, it was printed out directly and signed by both parties. Then, the seals of the peach blossom company and the Dongkeng Village Council were stamped, and the lease contract was considered to be in effect. After both parties kept the contract, Xia ruofei smiled and said,” “Mayor Wu, uncle ruan, I really have to thank you for this! How about this! Let’s have lunch together and celebrate our successful cooperation!” Ruan Fugui said,” “Mr. Xia, you’re helping our village develop its economy. If you want to eat, we’ll treat you! Why don’t you and Mayor Wu have a meal at my house? My wife’s cooking skills are pretty good!” Xia ruofei laughed and said, “Uncle ruan, I’ll be taking root in our Dongkeng village from now on. I’ll have plenty of opportunities to come to your house for a meal. You can’t fight with me for this meal today!” Then, Xia ruofei looked at Wu Gang and said,” “Mayor Wu, I’ve already arranged the place. Do me a favor!” Wu Gang smiled and said,” “Since Mr. Xia is so enthusiastic, then Lao ruan and I will have to trouble you!” Seeing that Wu Gang had agreed, ruan Fugui didn’t refuse and agreed to Xia ruofei’s suggestion. Hence, the group of them left the house. Xia ruofei drove his pickup truck and led the way. Ruan Fugui sat in Wu Gang’s car and followed behind. The young village Accountant was still sitting in Xia ruofei’s flying car. He had just rushed over from the beach to settle the contract. Xia ruofei could not leave him behind when he was treating them to a meal! The place for dinner was the West River Moon Club. Other than that, Xia ruofei was not familiar with any other places. Originally, Ling’s restaurant would have been more suitable. However, after Ling Qingxue had forcefully “stolen” his first kiss, both of them had felt a little embarrassed. At this time, Xia ruofei could not contact Ling Qingxue. The two cars headed straight for the city one after another. When they passed by the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Xia ruofei stopped and went in with the village Accountant to transfer a year’s rent to the Dongkeng village’s account. He also gave ruan Fugui a calming pill. Xia ruofei gave President Zheng a call on the way and asked him to arrange a private room. When they arrived at the West River Moon Club, a beautiful female manager was already waiting at the entrance. She welcomed Xia ruofei and the others in very respectfully. When had ruan Fugui ever been to such a high – end place? On the way to the private room, he was like a grandmother who had entered the Grand View Garden. Even Wu Gang rarely had the chance to enter such a high – end club like Xi Jiang Yue. Hence, Xia ruofei’s status in his heart had undoubtedly increased by a lot. President Zheng had arranged a very luxurious private room for Xia ruofei and everything was ready. The dishes were served as soon as they were on the table. The dishes in the club were very exquisite. President Zheng even arranged for three Taoyuan vegetables, which were hard to find. When they heard the VIP manager introduce Taoyuan vegetables, Wu Gang and the others were even more surprised. They repeatedly said that this meal was too Grand, and they were somewhat flattered. When President Zheng of the club came to propose a toast and was very polite to Xia ruofei, the importance of Xia ruofei in the hearts of Wu Gang and the others increased. Especially Wu Gang, who vaguely knew that Xia ruofei had an “antenna” in the city. He reminded himself that in the future, Xia ruofei would open a farm in his area, and there would be many opportunities to interact with him in the future. He must build a good relationship with Xia ruofei. This meal was a happy one for both the host and the guest, and the cooperation between the two sides started very happily. Xia ruofei personally sent Wu Gang and the others to the door and asked President Zheng to arrange a room for him to rest. Jian Jia had drunk a lot in the afternoon and he could not drive at the moment. Of course, when President Zheng suggested to arrange for two girls to “relax” with him, Xia ruofei firmly rejected it. He rested in the club room for the entire afternoon, and the smell of alcohol had completely dissipated. He then got up to say goodbye to President Zheng, got his car, and went straight to Taoyuan meat stall. After lunch, he contacted Liang Qichao. He was going there to fulfill his promise to bring the White – skinned lunar patch to Liang Qichao, and he needed Liang Qichao’s help with the farm construction. Before they reached the entrance of Taoyuan butcher shop, Xia ruofei could see the impatient Liang Qichao standing by the roadside, looking forward to it. He couldn’t help but laugh. It seemed that the White – skinned lunar boundary was very attractive to Liang Qichao!
