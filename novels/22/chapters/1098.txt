Chapter 1099: Spirit – gathering Jade Guanyin (2)

Translator: 549690339

This Jade Guanyin didn’t look any different from the previous one. However, if a master who cultivated spiritual power was here, he would immediately notice that there were countless complex lines invisible to the naked eye inside, and there was a faint flow of spiritual energy.

The spirit Qi in the spirit map space was already very dense, so the Jade Guanyin quickly absorbed a lot of spirit Qi and seemed to be more agile.

And this was without the blood contract. Once he absorbed a drop of elder song’s blood, he would wear the Jade Guanyin, and it would continuously absorb spiritual Qi, unknowingly nourishing his body. The benefits were more than five or ten hundred – year – old wild ginseng.

The body of the elderly was weak. In Traditional Chinese Medicine, there was a saying that a weak body could not be nourished. A tonic medicine like wild ginseng was naturally the best choice to use to keep one’s life, but it seemed too potent to be used to nourish the body.

However, the Jade Guanyin did not have such a disadvantage at all. Its nourishment to the body was carried out unknowingly. The whole process was very gentle, and even the person who was being nourished could not easily detect it.

After Xia ruofei played with the Jade Guanyin for a while, he put it away with satisfaction.

He felt that he was in a very good state today, so he decided to carve out the few pieces of jade he had just prepared in one go.

In any case, time flowed 30 times faster in the Archean realm, so he had plenty of time.

The Jade Guanyin had been successfully sculpted, so Xia ruofei decided to use the rest of the Jade to carve the Jade Leaf.

He had already made a draft in his heart, so he picked up a carving knife and cut the rest of the Jade into small pieces without hesitation.

If Ma Zhiming had seen Xia ruofei cut the glass – Type jade that was worth millions into such small pieces, he would have been heartbroken.

For such precious Jade, the bigger it was, the more valuable it was.

Under normal circumstances, a whole piece of Jade could be used to produce several bracelets, and the rest could be used to make rings. In short, the utilization rate had to be maximized.

However, Xia ruofei did not think too much about it. He did not care about spending a few million Yuan.

The carving of the Jade Leaf was much simpler than that of the Jade Guanyin. In a short while, Xia ruofei had carved all the Jade into lifelike jade leaves.

There were a total of seven pieces.

Xia ruofei rested for a while and then continued to carve amulets into the seven leaves.

The size of the Jade Leaf was much smaller than the Jade Guanyin. It was not enough to engrave a more complicated rune like the spirit gathering talisman. Besides, Xia ruofei felt that the safety of his loved ones was the first priority, so a relatively simple rune was the most suitable.

Xia ruofei was already very familiar with drawing protective runes.

He didn’t stop at all and quickly carved all seven jade leaves into the protective runes. He didn’t fail even once and the success rate was 100%.

After finishing all this, Xia ruofei let out a long sigh of relief. Even with his strong spiritual power, he could not help but feel a little tired after completing such a high – intensity task.

However, after he found a few boxes to store the Jade leaves and Jade Guanyin, he quickly left the space and returned to the outside world.

After all, they were in a hotel. Xia ruofei was worried that someone would accidentally barge in, so he left the spirit map space without delay after he was done.

After returning to his room, Xia ruofei immediately kept the spirit map scroll in his palm.

Then, he sat down, lit a cigarette, and took a break.

Because the time flow in the spirit map space was thirty times faster, only a little time had passed in the outside world.

Xia ruofei rested for a while. Seeing that it was still early for lunch, he gave Tang Yitian a call and found out that his family was visiting the Forbidden City. He left the hotel and took a taxi to the Forbidden City’s Natural Park.

The Forbidden City’s area was very vast. If they were to visit all of them in one day, it might not be enough. Tang Yitian and the others ‘plan for today was to tour the Forbidden City and climb the Great Wall of Badaling the next day.

Hence, Xia ruofei quickly bought the tickets and met up with Tang Yitian’s family in the Forbidden City.

Tang Haoran had thought that his master would not be free this morning and was a little depressed. However, when he saw Xia ruofei rushing over after finishing his work, he was very happy and his mood suddenly soared.

Now that the matter of the company’s brand ambassador had been settled, and Feng Jing was in charge of the follow – up work, Xia ruofei was very assured. Elder song’s birthday present for the next day had been prepared, so Xia ruofei was at ease.

He accompanied Tang Yitian’s family on a tour of the Forbidden City for a day. The next day, he went to the Great Wall of Badaling with them.

Little Haoran finally became a ‘hero’ for once.

As they had to attend a banquet at old song’s house that night, Xia ruofei and the rest had a simple lunch at Badaling before returning to the hotel.

He went back to his room to take a shower and lay down to sleep for a while. Song Rui arrived at the hotel at around fouro’ clock.

After receiving the call, Xia ruofei immediately changed into the clothes that he had already prepared. Then, he placed the Jade Guanyin into a paper box and stuffed it into his bag.

Xia ruofei saw song Rui as soon as he got out of the elevator. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

This guy was sitting on the sofa, looking around with a pair of sneaky eyes. He didn’t even blink when girls with good figures came in and out.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but find it funny. He waved at song Rui and shouted,””Song Rui!”

“RUO Fei!” Song Rui immediately stood up and said with a smile,”you’re really acting like a boss now! I’m staying in Hilton Hotel for my business trip!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but roll his eyes.”If I had a big house in the capital, I wouldn’t stay in a hotel!”

“That’s not my house ...” Song Rui said with a bitter face.”I’d rather stay in a hotel. I don’t have much freedom at home. Besides, you know my old man. He always has a long face as if I owe him tens of millions ...”

“Who said that? Elder song is so kind!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“That’s because I’m kind to you!” Song Rui said,”all of us from the younger generation are afraid of Grandpa ... Every day at home feels like a year! I can’t even go out and have fun! I won’t say anymore, I won’t say anymore. It’s all tears ... Let’s go! Grandpa is already waiting for you at home!”

Song Rui brought Xia ruofei out of the hotel. A sedan with a red flag was parked at the entrance of the hotel. A major with dark skin and a cold face stood upright beside the car.

“Ruofei, this is Chen Gang, the new guard staff officer that the organization assigned to Grandpa!” Song Rui introduced. Brother Chen, this is Xia ruofei, the guest that Grandpa wanted to meet today. ”

Chen Gang nodded at Xia ruofei and said,””Hello, Mr. Xia! Please get in the car!”

“I’ll have to trouble you, brother Chen!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

He had a natural sense of closeness to soldiers. Although Chen Gang did not smile much, his strong military temperament made Xia ruofei have a good impression of him. He also knew that this was a habit of the security guards, so he did not feel that there was any neglect in his album.

Xia ruofei noticed that the sedan with the red flag had a white military license plate. After getting in, he could not help but ask,””Song Rui, this ... Could this be elder song’s car?”

Song Rui smiled and said,”strictly speaking, it’s not. It’s just a spare car. However, the specifications are the same as the special car. It’s a special explosion – proof version!” It’s just to pick you up, and Grandpa would glare at us if we tried to touch this car!”

In fact, Xia ruofei had noticed the heavy doors of the red – flag car when he got in. The experienced Xia ruofei could tell that the car was equipped with the best bulletproof armor.

He couldn’t help but feel touched. Elder song had indeed treated him differently!

Then, Xia ruofei had an idea and asked,””By the way, where’s elder song’s former guard staff officer, Xu Wu?”

When elder song was seriously ill, Xia ruofei treated him and lived in the mountains for a while. He was very close to his guard and staff officer, Xu Wu. So when he saw that elder song’s personal guard had been replaced by Chen Gang, he could not help but show concern.

Song Rui said with a smile,”brother Xu has been promoted. He’s now the Chief of Staff of the second security Regiment. The second security Regiment is stationed in Daxing. You can go and play with him when you’re free!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

As the two of them chatted, Chen Gang had already driven steadily on the road of Beijing. The car shuttled nimbly through the heavy traffic and gradually left the city, coming to the foot of a small mountain in the West of Beijing.
