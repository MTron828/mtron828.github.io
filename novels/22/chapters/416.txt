Chapter 417: Chapter 370 – directly cripple_1

Although this young man looked gentle, like a young student who had just walked out of the school gate, the strong murderous aura that he exuded made even a ruthless person like Fang Luo’s heart tremble.

Fang Luo had taken human lives, and he had been living a life of bloodshed for more than ten years. He was very sensitive to such a murderous aura, and a hint of fear appeared in his eyes. Such a strong murderous aura ... How many people had this person killed before ...

After Xia ruofei entered the room, he did not even look at Fang Luo. His gaze landed on Lu You, who was cuffed to the bed.

Although Lu You was not in a clear state of mind, her clothes were still intact even though they were a little messy. Xia ruofei heaved a sigh of relief. He was not late.

He walked to the bed in a few steps, grabbed the pair of alloy handcuffs with both hands, and separated them with force. With a crack, the solid alloy chain broke like a plastic toy.

Fang Luo’s eyelids twitched uncontrollably. He looked at Xia ruofei’s broad back and a fierce light flashed in his eyes. He gritted his teeth and used his other hand to grab the handle of the gun.

“Go to hell!” Fang Luo shouted crazily.

However, as soon as he raised the gun, Xia ruofei did a clean and Swift Roundhouse side kick, as if she had eyes in the back of her head. She accurately kicked the wrist of Fang Luo’s hand that was holding the gun.

The silver pistol was kicked away by Xia ruofei, and Fang Luo’s wrist quickly swelled up.

Xia ruofei turned around slowly. There was no emotion in his eyes as he stared coldly at Fang Luo, who was in a state of madness.

Fang Luo was panting heavily. Without any hesitation, he used his injured hand to grab the military dagger that was nailed to his left palm. He gritted his teeth and pulled the dagger out.

The intense pain caused Fang Luo to let out a muffled groan. However, he was indeed a ruthless person. He looked at the dagger that was still dripping with blood, and a hysterical smile appeared at the corner of his mouth.

Fang Luo leaped up and swung the dagger in his hand at Xia ruofei’s throat with a dazzling cold light.

The corners of Xia ruofei’s mouth curled up slightly, and his eyes revealed a hint of disdain. Facing the menacing Fang Luo, he did not move at all. He only raised his hand when the dagger was almost within reach.

Xia ruofei’s movements looked slow, but he managed to catch Fang Luo’s wrist accurately. Then, Xia ruofei gripped it lightly without any expression.

Crack ...

Fang Luo’s wrist bone was crushed by Xia ruofei’s casual grip, and the dagger fell to the ground with a clatter.

Fang Luo was like a mad demon. He waved his hand, which was pierced by the dagger, and hit Xia ruofei.

It had to be said that Fang Luo had a kind of ruthlessness that came from his bones. However, such ruthlessness was useless in the face of the huge gap in absolute power.

Xia ruofei tilted his head slightly and dodged the fatal blow easily. Then, when Fang Luo lost his balance, Xia ruofei pulled him slightly and Fang Luo’s entire body fell forward involuntarily.

Xia ruofei grabbed Fang Luo’s shoulders and kneed him without hesitation. He hit Fang Luo’s chest with his knee, making a dull sound.

Puchi ...

The impact was extremely heavy, and Fang Luo spat out a mouthful of blood.

Xia ruofei dodged lightly and avoided the blood that Fang Luo spat out. At the same time, he let go of his hands and Fang Luo immediately fell to the ground.

Xia ruofei’s mouth twitched. This person looked very powerful, but his actual combat power was not even comparable to brother Hu. He had completely lost his combat power without any effort.

At that moment, Fang Luo was leaning on the bedside table, his upper body naked. The corners of his mouth and his chest were covered in ghastly bloodstains. One of his palms had been pierced through, and it was still bleeding. His other wrist was broken at a strange angle. His entire person was as white as a sheet of paper, and he looked rather dispirited.

However, Xia ruofei did not have the slightest bit of sympathy. The situation in the room was already very clear. If he had not arrived in time, Xia ruofei did not even dare to imagine what kind of tragic ending Lu You would have had tonight.

The whips, candles, and other things at the side also showed that the person in front of her had some perverted hobbies. To Lu You, that was a nightmare – like experience.

Naturally, Xia ruofei would not have any sympathy for such a scumbag.

His gaze landed on Lu You, who was on the bed. At this moment, Lu You was still in a state of deep drunkenness. There was still a trace of fear and helplessness on her face. Perhaps the movement just now had allowed her to regain some consciousness. She started to Mutter softly again.

“Xia ... Ruofei ... Save ... Save me ...”

Seeing this scene, Xia ruofei felt a sharp pain in his heart. Lu You’s helpless look had touched his heart.

He walked forward and leaned over to Lu You’s ear, saying,””I’m here, it’s fine now ...” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Lu You tried her best to open her eyes, but her vision was still blurry. However, Xia ruofei’s voice seemed to have a magical power. She stopped mumbling and her expression became more peaceful. She twisted her body slightly and fell asleep again.

Only then did Xia ruofei straighten his body and turn to look at Fang Luo, who was like a dead dog.

Fang Luo was still gasping for air, and blood kept flowing out of his mouth. Xia ruofei’s knee attack had obviously hurt his internal organs.
