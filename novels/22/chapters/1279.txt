Translator: 549690339

As night fell, Xia ruofei and MA Xiong arrived at Guo Hongjiang’s Villa on the mountain top road.

Although it was called a villa, it was more like a Manor.

In addition to a three – story bungalow, there were a few auxiliary buildings, a huge front and back garden, a private swimming pool, and so on.

The environment here was quiet and private. At the same time, one could have a view of the sea of Port Victoria it was almost the best location in the entire port.

Guo Hongjiang’s wealth was evident from the fact that he owned such a vast Manor – style villa in the top luxury area.

Guo Hongjiang took Xia ruofei’s visit very seriously. Besides, MA Xiong, who was of similar status to him, was also in the car, so he had come to the entrance of the villa in advance to wait. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

As soon as the car stopped, Guo Hongjiang came up to him with a smile.

“Chairman MA, Mr. Xia, it’s an honor to have you here!” Guo Hongjiang said enthusiastically.

“Director Guo, if this place is full of ‘Peng Peng’, then my house is just a piece of wild land!” Xia ruofei joked.

“Mr. Xia is an expert, unlike us ordinary people who pursue material enjoyment.” Guo Hongjiang smiled and said,”Chairman MA, Mr. Xia, dinner is ready. Please come in!”

The two of them followed Guo Hongjiang to the restaurant in the villa.

The long dining table was already filled with delicious food, and the decanter was filled with red wine that had been decanted in advance. This was a bottle of wine from Bordeaux, France. It was more than a hundred years old and had been in Guo Hongjiang’s collection for more than 20 years. There were only two bottles of such wine in his large wine cellar, and he opened one bottle without hesitation today.

Neatly dressed waiters were lined up in a row, and there was also a foreigner in a white chef’s uniform. He was Guo Hongjiang’s family’s private chef who specialized in cooking.

Although there were only the three of them at dinner and it could be considered a family dinner, Guo Hongjiang made it very Grand. Not only were there a lot of service staff, but they also opened a rare red wine and even enjoyed the top – grade white truffle that they had won from the auction a few days ago.

Xia ruofei watched as The French Chef used a knife to slice the fresh white truffle and placed it on the plate. He could not help but have a strange feeling.

The White truffle was sold at a high price, but in the end, he still had to enjoy it himself. Although he only ate a small portion of the White truffle, Xia ruofei still felt strange.

Guo Hongjiang held his wine glass and said,”Mr. Xia, I can’t thank you enough for your great kindness. I won’t say much. From now on, Mr. Xia will be my, Guo Hongjiang ‘s, most expensive guest!” Come, let’s have a drink first!”

Guo Hongjiang was a smart man. Xia ruofei had saved the life of the “star of Hong Kong”, so it was a big favor.

Of course, the most important thing was that through this incident, Guo Hongjiang had keenly discovered that Xia ruofei was extraordinary. For such a person with extraordinary talents, especially those who were good at medicine, super – rich people like Guo Hongjiang would definitely go after them like ducks.

Regardless of whether Guo Hongjiang had a utilitarian heart, at least his attitude was very sincere. Hence, Xia ruofei also smiled and raised his glass. “You’re too kind, director Guo. I just did you a small favor. Don’t mind me. ”

“This is a great favor!” Guo Hongjiang and Xia ruofei clinked their glasses and said with a smile.

After drinking, Guo Hongjiang gave MA Xiong another toast and then greeted him warmly,””Come on! Chairman MA, Mr. Xia, try bliss’s cooking! Thanks to Mr. Xia, this top – grade truffle is not common!”

Everyone ate and chatted, and the atmosphere of the banquet was very lively.

After three rounds of drinking, Guo Hongjiang gestured to the Butler behind him. The Butler immediately brought over a document that had been prepared.

Guo Hongjiang held the document in his hand and passed it to Xia ruofei across the dining table. He smiled and said,””Mr. Xia, this is a small gift from me. I hope Mr. Xia will not reject it.”

Xia ruofei took the document, feeling a little strange. He opened it, took a look, and immediately closed the folder.”Director Guo, you can’t do that! Absolutely not!”

“Mr. Xia, don’t be in such a hurry to refuse!” Guo Hongjiang smiled and said,”I have my reasons for doing this ...”

MA Xiong put down his glass and asked with a smile,””Yo! It seemed that director Guo had given him a big gift! Look at how scared Xia Sheng is ...”

“Old Mr. MA, take a look for yourself!” Xia ruofei smiled bitterly.

MA Xiong took the folder and flipped it open. He couldn’t help but exclaim,”Director Guo is really generous!”

This was a transfer document. The transfer item was none other than Guo Hongjiang’s beloved horse,”the star of Hong Kong.” The transfer price was one Hong Kong dollars.

In other words, Guo Hongjiang wanted to give the “star of Hong Kong” to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei said,”director Guo, I really can’t accept this!” I know you want to thank me, but I only did you a favor and all I did was heal the star of Hong Kong. You’re giving him to me, this ... This is too ...”

Guo Hongjiang said sincerely,”Mr. Xia, if you didn’t stop me that night, the star of Hong Kong would have been euthanized.” If you didn’t save him, the star of Hong Kong would have been severely injured and wouldn’t have survived. So, it’s not a loss to me. You deserve this horse. And ...”

At this point, Guo Hongjiang paused and looked at Xia ruofei deeply before continuing,””And I think Mr. Xia has an affinity with the ‘star of Hong Kong’. To be able to tame it in just two to three days is not something an ordinary person can do. A precious horse gives a hero, so this horse is the most suitable for you ...”
