Chapter 635: Inspiring people (2)

“You’re welcome,” Xia ruofei smiled gently.”Auntie Xue, if it’s about time, go and prepare to feed Chengcheng his medicine!”

“Alright, alright.”

Xue bi Yun put one of the herbs into the fridge, then opened the other bag and poured it into a bowl. She heated it in a clay pot over water.

During the whole process, Chengcheng was lying on the carpet alone, fiddling with the cap of a mineral water bottle. He didn’t even care about Xia ruofei’s arrival.

Xia ruofei knew very well that taking only two doses of Chinese medicine would not help much. After all, the solution of the spirit Heart Flower petals this time was relatively diluted.

So now to test the effect of the heart – nourishing soup, it was the most suitable time. If in the future, under the treatment, Chengcheng’s condition could improve greatly, then it could prove the efficacy of the heart – nourishing soup.

Xue bi Yun brought out the heart nourishing soup that had been heated and added with rock sugar, and began to coax Chengcheng to take the medicine.

Xia ruofei was sitting on the sofa in the living room, feeding the medicine. He couldn’t help but he couldn’t leave either. He had to stay in case anything happened after Chengcheng took the medicine.

Xue bi Yun still had a way to treat Chengcheng. Even though the process was more complicated, a bowl of medicine was given out several times, and she even chased Chengcheng back and forth a few times, she still successfully fed him.

Xue bi Yun went to wash the dishes, while Xia ruofei stood up and went to Chengcheng’s side, paying close attention to Chengcheng’s condition.

Chengcheng didn’t have any reaction. After drinking the medicine, he started to play on his own. He didn’t have any reaction to the stranger Xia ruofei who was so close to him.

After Xue bi Yun finished washing the dishes, she stood to the side and looked at her son, sighing to herself.

Xia ruofei was not in a hurry to leave. He was observing Chengcheng’s situation while chatting with Xue Biyun. He also said a lot of comforting words to give Xue Biyun confidence in Chengcheng.

......

Half an hour later, Xia ruofei felt that Chengcheng should be fine, so he stood up and prepared to leave.

“Aunt Xue, I’ll go back first. I’ll get someone to send the medicine over tomorrow.” Xia ruofei said,”give me the remaining portions of the Chinese medicine I gave you yesterday!”

Even if the Chinese medicine was sealed and stored in the refrigerator, it could not be stored for more than three days, otherwise it would go bad.

Although the Chinese medicine from yesterday only contained a small amount of spirit Heart Flower petals, Xia ruofei did not want to waste it. He put the Chinese medicine into the spirit map space so that it could be preserved for a long time.

Xue bi Yun quickly took out the remaining bags of Chinese medicine and put them in a plastic bag before handing it to Xia ruofei.

After Xia ruofei took it, he thought for a while and took out a porcelain bottle from his bag and handed it to Xue bi Yun, saying,”Aunt Xue, if Chengcheng has any adverse reactions after taking the medicine these few days, you must immediately feed him the medicine in this. It can neutralize the medicine.”

There was a small bottle of spirit Heart Flower petal solution inside, which had also been diluted several times.

Xue bi Yun had already treated Xia ruofei as her life – saving straw, so she naturally listened to him. She quickly took it and held it tightly in her hands.

Xia ruofei continued,”Auntie Xue, you must keep this bottle properly. Don’t let Chengcheng take it by mistake. If there are no side effects, it can not be taken alone.”

“Alright, I’ll lock it in the box!” Xue bi Yun quickly said.

Xia ruofei’s reminder was not to slow down Chengcheng’s recovery, but he was worried that it would affect the effect of the heart nourishing soup.

Xue bi Yun sent Xia ruofei to the door of the suite. As he still had to take care of the child, Xia ruofei asked her to stay and left the hotel.

……

In the following days, Xia ruofei’s life was very busy and fulfilling.

The machines, equipment, and minerals and metallic materials he ordered online had arrived one after another. He often had to go to the warehouse to collect the goods and pay the balance.

In addition, these mechanical equipment could not be driven by batteries. Xia ruofei specially went to the city to purchase a small diesel generator.

After the preliminary preparations were complete, Xia ruofei would take time out every day to go to the spirit map space and use the mechanical equipment to process, Polish, and engrave the raw materials of the array disks.

One by one, the parts were slowly being processed.

This formation disk was not big, but it involved more than 200 parts. Xia ruofei could not finish it in one go, but he made progress every day. He was still very satisfied.

Huan Huan came to Peach Blossom Farm again. This time, Lu You brought her here.

Xia ruofei did not go back on his word. He brought the two beauties to the beach near the farm and played with them for a day. He even brought his own ingredients and had a barbeque at the beach.

Huan Huan was naturally having a lot of fun, and her innocent laughter echoed on the beach.

Xia ruofei felt that Lu You seemed a little unnatural. Sometimes, she would blush for no reason. Although she hid it very well, Xia ruofei could still sense it.

Furthermore, he could feel that Lu You was secretly looking at him a few times. However, every time he turned his head, Lu You’s gaze would be elsewhere. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

However, with Xia ruofei’s current level of spiritual energy, his senses were still very sharp. Even if he had his back facing Lu You, he could still feel Lu You’s gaze on him immediately.

However, Xia ruofei did not expose her. He just pretended not to know.

Xia ruofei did not pay too much attention to Lu You’s small abnormality. He just let go of his body and mind to play with Huanhuan for the whole day, then his mind returned to the soul puppet formation disk.
