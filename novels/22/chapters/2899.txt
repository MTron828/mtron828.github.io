2900 Decisive killing (1)

Dai Weisi and the others didn’t even have the chance to react before they felt a flash of sword light before their eyes, and several parts of their bodies simultaneously felt cold.

They couldn’t help but be stunned for a moment, completely not knowing what had happened.

After a long time, Davis and the others felt a heart – wrenching pain in their wrists and ankles, followed by blood lines slowly appearing on their hands and feet.

The blue travel immortal sword was so sharp that they didn’t feel anything when it cut the wrists and ankles of Dai Weisi and the others. Moreover, the wounds were very thin. After a long time, blood began to slowly seep out of the wounds under the pressure.

Davis was the first to scream like a pig being slaughtered. At this time, he discovered that his body had already regained its freedom, and the invisible binding force had suddenly disappeared.

However, his hands and feet were completely powerless. He couldn’t even hold the heavy pistol and it fell to the ground with a clatter.

The other burly men were in the same situation. The guns in their hands fell to the ground.

However, they were after all people who lived on the edge of a knife and licked blood for a living, so they were a little tougher than Davis. Davis was already rolling on the ground in pain.

In that instant, Xia ruofei’s Blue travel immortal sword had cut off all the tendons in Dai Weisi’s hands and feet.

Charlie was dumbfounded at the side. He was already convinced that this Chinese young man in front of him was the legendary Eastern immortal! Otherwise, how could there be such a godly method? In the face of such absolute combat power, even the speed of a gun could not compare! There was also the mysterious weapon of the eastern immortal. He had vaguely seen a sword light just now, but it had flashed under the night sky and then disappeared.

Could this be the legendary sword immortal? Charlie couldn’t help but have such a thought. When he was learning Chinese, he had read the legend of the swordsman of Mount Shu. The description of the legendary flying sword was simply fascinating.

Taking the enemy’s head from a thousand miles away, that was how domineering it was!

Xia ruofei’s face was still calm. He said indifferently,””Charlie, they don’t have any power to resist now. It’s up to you how you want to deal with them.”

Xia ruofei and Charlie had met by chance. However, he felt that it was fate for him to encounter such a thing even though he had just landed in the sea to rest. That was why he had saved him.

If Charlie’s compassion overflowed and he decided to let Davis go, he wouldn’t have any objections.

If Charlie was really willing to spare Davis ‘life, there was still hope for Davis to reattach the tendons in his hands and feet. After all, the Azure immortal sword was really sharp. Xia ruofei’s operation was even more exquisite, so the incision could be said to be very smooth and there was no other injury. As long as a good surgeon was found in time for the operation, it was unlikely that he would recover completely. At most, it would be a little inconvenient for his movements. He would not have to spend the rest of his life in a wheelchair.

Of course, if Charlie really made such a choice, Xia ruofei would be a little disappointed in him. However, it was just a little disappointment.

After Xia ruofei said this, he stepped onto the blue immortal sword that Charlie could not see and was ready to leave.

Seeing that Xia ruofei was about to leave, Charlie quickly called out,””Daoist immortal, please wait!”

Xia ruofei had already flown a few meters in the direction of the sky on the blue travel immortal sword. He stopped the flying sword and turned around to ask,””Is there anything else?”

Charlie quickly said,”Mr. Deity, Davis has several accomplices on duty in the cockpit. They all have guns in their hands. If you don’t mind, I’m definitely not their match. As the saying goes,’save a man to the end, send Buddha to the West’. Please save me, Mr. Deity!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but smile.””Your Chinese is pretty good! He actually knew how to send Buddha to the West. However ...... If you are talking about the five people in the cockpit, then there is no need to worry. They are now like Davis, without any ability to resist. You can say that they are at your mercy. ”

Xia ruofei’s spiritual power could cover an area of at least 15 kilometers. Although this yacht was one of the largest yachts in the world, its overall ruler was only about 160 to 170 meters long. Xia ruofei’s spiritual power scanned the entire yacht and he was clear about the condition of the entire yacht.

Before he arrived, Davis had already killed all the crew members, bodyguards, and other staff members on the yacht. Those who were left were naturally Davis’s accomplices. Furthermore, the few guys chatting in the cockpit could not escape Xia ruofei’s detection. By comparing the two, these people’s identities were confirmed without a doubt.

Hence, when Xia ruofei released the blue travel immortal sword, he first cut off the tendons in the hands and feet of Davis and the others, then drew a beautiful arc and flew directly to the cockpit. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

To Xia ruofei, this was as easy as blowing off dust.

Although he still couldn’t behead people from a thousand miles away like the legendary sword Immortals, within the range of his mental power, he could accurately control the position more than a hundred meters away without any difficulty.

This was done in a flash by Xia ruofei at a very fast speed. Moreover, this place was at the other end of the yacht, more than a hundred meters away from the cockpit. The sound from the other side could not be heard, so Charlie did not notice.

Of course, Charlie did not doubt Xia ruofei’s words. He could not help but widen his eyes and mumble,””Long – range flying sword control ... Could it be that Sir is the legendary sword immortal?”
