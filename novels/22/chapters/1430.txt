Chapter 1431: It makes sense to act cute (2)

Translator: 549690339

Everyone’s impression of big bosses was that they either had a serious face or were cold and aloof. This included the famous son of the richest man, young master Wang, who was known as the Secretary of the Discipline Inspection Commission of the entertainment industry. He also often fought with people.

In the replies, many people expressed their understanding of Xia ruofei.

After all, they had already spent a few million Yuan. Who would do something illegal just to save 20000 to 30000 Yuan? How could there be such a stupid person?

Therefore, as long as one was a little more understanding, they would not think that there was a conspiracy.

Some people laughed and said,”I guess at the moment when boss Xia won the prize, there would be 999 alpacas running through his heart. Why is it less than 1000 alpacas short of one?” He was afraid that boss Xia would get too proud ...

It wasn’t time to cultivate yet, so Xia ruofei leaned against the headboard and browsed through the Weibo comments with interest.

Although he didn’t care much about the false reputation, the overwhelming discussion about the Paradise company on the internet seemed to give him a sense of accomplishment.

After a while, Xia ruofei saw that the Weibo accounts of the peach blossom company’s employees had also started to participate.

After the annual meeting, many of these employees went to drink and sing according to their department’s schedule. The Department directors and the leaders of the new departments all had considerable year – end bonuses, so they were all generous today.

This also led to the employees of paradise Corporation not realizing that the topic of the annual meeting on the internet was already in full swing.

Of course, after one person saw it, everyone would naturally know that it was so convenient for Yingluo to have a WeChat group now. Even Xia ruofei had joined many WeChat groups of all sizes. Paradise Corporation also had a large group. Various departments, work groups, and even temporary teams would form WeChat groups. News spread very quickly.

When the employees saw the discussions on Weibo, they couldn’t help but criticize any remarks that were against the company.

The words of those who had personally attended the annual meeting were even more convincing.

In the midst of such discussions, more details about the annual meeting were revealed.

For example, Xia ruofei’s announcement that 5% of the profits would be used as dividends had caused a lot of envy.

The comment that questioned Xia ruofei’s win was also refuted by many employees.

“Please don’t make wild guesses without any basis. It’s a fact that CEO Xia won the prize, and it’s also a fact that he personally participated in the money – making game. However, he immediately set up a special prize after the incident and contributed all the prize money he won. The winner was even a security guard on duty. This matter is completely backed up!”

“Some people just hate for the sake of slandering. How can President Xia be accused of creating hype by giving more benefits to his employees? Just how dark were the hearts of these people? Our company is rich, so we are willing to give more money to our employees. Who is in the way of this?”

“When I saw that the news about my company’s Annual Meeting was on the hot search, I couldn’t help but go up to take a look. There are actually trolls for such a positive thing. Indeed, there are all kinds of birds in a big forest!”

After all these verified accounts of the Paradise company’s employees joined, Zheng Fang’s voice immediately grew a lot stronger. Although their numbers were not large, they had something to show for it! What he said was all reasonable. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Soon, the netizens also joined in. There was a lot of discussion about Xia ruofei’s win.

One of the comments by a netizen named “Demon Sword” was very representative and also received many likes.

He wrote,”this is what I think about President Xia winning the prize.” As the one who set the rules, he had to first follow the rules. He was also one of the employees. Since he had been drawn for this prize, he had to receive the prize and participate in the game. This was a form of respect for the rules. At the same time, he completed the game segment. After receiving the prize money, he immediately contributed the prize money as a special prize. This shows the loyal side of a boss. In this matter, I think boss Xia’s handling was almost perfect.

Xia ruofei laughed as he gave “Demon Sword” a like on Weibo.

It had to be said that Xia ruofei rarely used Weibo, so he did not know much about its functions.

He didn’t know that after he liked the post, it would be listed in the top half of the Weibo page.

The observant netizens soon realized that Xia ruofei liked this Weibo post and many of them laughed.

“Boss Xia really knows what to love and what to hate! I support your opinion and like it!”

“Previously, haters turned to fans. Now, true heart road has turned to fans!”

“What a cute shop owner!”

......

The number of fans on Xia ruofei’s Weibo account had increased again. In a short while, it had almost broken through 10000. These 10000 fans had all increased overnight.

Seeing that it was almost midnight, Xia ruofei turned off the Weibo notification to remind Yingluo. Otherwise, his phone would keep vibrating and there would be new messages almost every second.

After putting his phone aside, Xia ruofei started to focus on his cultivation.

......

Fang Xiaoyu was an employee of the marketing department of paradise Corporation. He was one of the first to apply to the company, so he was definitely one of the first – generation entrepreneurs.

Before he came to paradise Corporation, he had worked for another e – commerce company for a while. That was his first job after graduating from university. However, small and medium – sized e – commerce companies had a hard time surviving, and the company’s performance had always been poor. Naturally, his income did not improve much, so he simply resigned.

She had seen the peach blossom company’s recruitment advertisement by chance and came to apply for the job with a try – out attitude, and had been working until now.

Now that Fang Xiaoyu was one of the core employees of the marketing department, his name would most likely be on the list of 50 people’s awards, because no matter how you looked at it, he met the requirements.

Therefore, even though he did not win anything at the annual meeting and only received a kyokuboku mall shopping card that cost 1000 Yuan, he was still very excited and immediately posted it on his WeChat moments.

He didn’t expect that a status update as usual would become the source of all the news about paradise Corporation on the internet.

The culprit was Fang Xiaoyu’s high school classmate, Jiang Xuebin, who was now the co – Pilot of Heron Island Airlines.

Jiang Xuebin was the “peddler” of Banyan Tree forum. After seeing Fang Xiaoyu’s moments, he couldn’t help but ask her for more details about the annual meeting on WeChat. Fang Xiaoyu was excited, and since the annual meeting was not a confidential meeting, she naturally answered all her questions.

He didn’t expect that Jiang Xuebin would actually post these contents on the internet, and even use the photos in his WeChat moments.

When Fang Xiaoyu returned home after the Department gathering, she saw that Weibo was full of such content, and the photos were all the same as the ones she had posted on her moments. She couldn’t help but feel confused.

Soon, he found the source of the news and saw the post on the Banyan Tree forum.

Fang Xiaoyu knew Jiang Xuebin’s Banyan Tree ID, so he called Jiang Xuebin immediately. Jiang Xuebin had already turned off his phone to prepare for the next day’s flight mission, so Fang Xiaoyu couldn’t find him.

Fang Xiaoyu spent the whole night in anxiety.

The contents of his moments had been reposted on the internet, and he had seen some negative comments. Some of them were even criticizing Chairman Xia ruofei.

Fang Xiaoyu didn’t know if she would be affected by this incident. If the year – end bonus was canceled, or if it was more serious, she might even lose her job, then it would be a tragedy.

While he was complaining in his heart about Jiang Xuebin reposting the content of his moments without permission, his heart was also in a mess. The next day, when he went to work, he knocked on the office door of Xiao Qiang, who had just been appointed as the company’s Chief Marketing Officer, with an uneasy mood.
