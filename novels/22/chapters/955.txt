Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei didn’t care about the little incident at the entrance of the farm. As for Tang Yitian, he didn’t care about such a small figure either. So, everyone was in a good mood, talking and laughing along the way.

More than three hours later, the group arrived at Tang Yitian’s mansion in Sydney’s wealthy District, vauclub.

Tang Yitian’s Manor was only one of the many mansions he owned in Australia and even in the world.

The manor was in an excellent location. It was right by the sea. From his home, he could see the Sydney Harbor, the harbor Bridge, and the Opera House. There was even a private beach. Considering that Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao were here for a vacation, Tang Yitian chose to receive them here.

As the hostess, Jennifer showed Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao around their Manor with great enthusiasm.

The manor covered an area of about 15 acres and the building area reached more than 5000 square meters.

The manor had a large green space, a glass garden, a small Stadium, a home audio and visual center, a swimming pool, and other facilities.

The entire Manor was personally designed by the well – known architect Steve, who paid attention to every detail of the building. The overall style was quite harmonious and natural.

Lin Qiao was dazzled, especially when they walked to the private beach. When she saw the almost pure white beach and the boundless sea, she couldn’t help but exclaim in admiration.

“Jennifer, your house is so beautiful!” Lin Qiao smiled at Xia ruofei and continued,”I thought brother ruofei was already very rich, but compared to the real rich people, hehe ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”your brother, ruofei, started from scratch.” Even if I’ve started my business since I was in my mother’s womb, it’s impossible for me to earn big brother Tang’s family business at such a young age!”

“Ruofei,” Tang Yitian said without hesitation,”since miss Lin likes this Manor, I’ll ask someone to take care of it and leave it for you. You can come and live here whenever you come to Sydney!”

Tang Yitian knew that Xia ruofei wouldn’t accept it if he just gave him a Manor. That was why he suggested this. In fact, it was almost the same as giving it to him.

As long as Xia ruofei agreed, Tang Yitian would definitely not come to live with them in the future. He would usually send people to maintain the manor and make it ready to be used at any time. Xia ruofei could stay there whenever he wanted.

Tang Yitian’s life experience was much richer than Xia ruofei ‘s. After he found out that Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao were not biological siblings, he could already tell that Lin Qiao did not have simple feelings for Xia ruofei. On the other hand, Xia ruofei was very slow in this aspect and did not feel anything.

Therefore, when Lin Qiao expressed her love for this Manor, Tang Yitian didn’t hesitate to leave the manor for Xia ruofei to use.

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.”Big brother Tang, I might not even be able to come to Australia once a year. Why did you leave such a big Manor for me?” he asked. Isn’t that a waste?”

“Why would it be a waste?” Tang Yitian said without a care. Keep it as a backup! I have so many houses, but I can’t live in all of them. I might not even live in some of them once in a year or two ...”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Big brother Tang, you’re a rich and powerful man. I’m different ... Anyway, you have to listen to me. There’s no need to waste it.”

Seeing that Tang Yitian was going to give the whole Manor to Xia ruofei, Lin Qiao couldn’t help but stick out her tongue and say,””Mr. Tang, I was just talking nonsense. Don’t scare me! Besides, brother ruofei definitely won’t accept it. ”

Tang Yitian could only helplessly say,”alright!” However, if you come to Australia in the future, remember to tell me at once. I’ll pay for all your food, accommodation, and transportation!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”sure!” I promise I won’t stand on ceremony with you!”

It was already evening, and everyone enjoyed the sunset on the beach for a while before returning to the manor.

The main building of the manor was a six – story villa with a total area of more than four thousand square meters. Tang Yitian had already ordered the servants to prepare dinner.

The dinner was arranged in a beautiful garden. The long and elegant table was filled with delicious food that looked, smelled, and smelled good. There were Australian dishes and authentic Chinese food. Tang Yitian was very attentive. He was worried that Xia ruofei and Xia Ling wouldn’t be used to the Australian food, so he asked the family’s chef to prepare Chinese food.

Although he grew up in Australia, he had lived in the Chinese community for a long time and had once led the largest Chinese society in Australia, so Tang Yitian still retained a lot of Chinese living habits, including food. He also liked the taste of Chinese food.

That was why he had a Chinese food chef at home.

Australia was a famous wine – producing place, so wine was naturally indispensable for dinner.

Tang Yitian had prepared a six – liter bottle of wine. Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao only found out that the bottle of wine was from the famous Australian brand, benfu Grange, after Tang Yitian had opened the bottle and introduced it to them.

This benfu range was a limited edition that was released in 2012. There were only five bottles in the world, and each bottle cost as much as 142500 US dollars, which was nearly a million Chinese dollars.

Because the production was too low, or rather, this wine wasn’t mass – produced at all. It was an out – of – Print collection of wine, so Tang Yitian bought one of the five bottles because he had the advantage of the local location. It had been kept in the wine cellar for several years.

This time, when Xia ruofei was here as a guest, he took out this bottle of wine without hesitation. It was clear how distinguished Xia ruofei was in his heart.

After listening to Tang Yitian’s introduction, Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao couldn’t help but click their tongues at the expensive wine. Even Xia ruofei had never heard of it before. It was almost one million Yuan a bottle. Even if it was a six – liter bottle, a small glass would cost twenty to thirty thousand Yuan. It was even more expensive than gold!

Xia ruofei smiled.”Big brother Tang, if you had told me earlier, I definitely wouldn’t have let you open this bottle of wine. It’s too extravagant!”

“Xia,” Jennifer said with a smile,”even if Mr. Governor came as a guest, Ethan wouldn’t be willing to take out this bottle of wine to serve him. But you’re the most distinguished guest in our family. Of course, we have to serve you the best wine!”

Tang Yitian laughed and said,”Jennifer is right!” Ruofei, you are the most distinguished guests of our family! Come, come, come, let’s have a drink together!”

After that, Tang Yitian raised his glass.

Everyone raised their glasses. Even Tang Haoran raised his glass of drink.

After clinking glasses, Xia ruofei took a sip and said with an exaggerated expression,””I drank it for a few thousand Yuan? I don’t feel any different ...”

“Brother ruofei, you don’t know much about wine. It’s such a waste to give you such expensive wine!” Lin Qiao pursed her lips and smiled.

Xia ruofei looked at Lin Qiao with a smile and said,””You speak as if you know about wine ...”

“I can learn it if I don’t know it!” Lin Qiao raised her chin.

“Lin, I’m willing to be your wine – tasting teacher!” Jennifer immediately said with a smile.

Lin Qiao immediately looked at Xia ruofei proudly and said,””Did you hear that? Jennifer will personally teach me how to taste wine, and I’m sure my level will soon leave you far behind!”

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly.”Okay, okay, okay. Our Qiao’ er is the smartest. She can learn anything quickly, right?”

“This is more like it!” Lin Qiao said with a smile.

At this time, Tang Haoran also sensibly raised his drink and said,””Master, I’ll toast you!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I’m going to drink this glass of wine!” It’s the first time an apprentice has toasted me!”

Tang Yitian happily patted Tang Haoran’s head and said,”Ruofei, we’ll leave our Haoran to you in the future ...”

Xia ruofei clinked his glass with Tang Haoran ‘s. After taking a sip of wine, he said,””Big brother Tang, don’t worry! Haoran’s talent is pretty good. He will definitely have great achievements in the future. ”

At this time, Jennifer, who was talking to Lin Qiao in a low voice, couldn’t help but ask,””Xia, I want to know ... When you return to Huaxia later, will Haoran go back with you?”

She had been keeping this question in her heart. Her son was still so young. If he had to leave her for the distant Huaxia, she would naturally be very reluctant.

Even if she had absolute trust in Xia ruofei, Jennifer would still have all kinds of worries. After all, a mother would be worried when her son traveled a thousand miles!

Tang Yitian’s face slightly changed, and he quickly said,””Jennifer, Haoran is ruofei’s apprentice, so he must be learning from ruofei! He has such a capable master like RUO Fei, what do you have to worry about? If you really miss your son, you can fly to China to visit him!”

Tang Yitian was worried that Xia ruofei would be unhappy.

He was an immortal – like figure! He was willing to take Tang Haoran as his disciple, and that was already a blessing to his family. This was a great opportunity that many people did not even dare to dream of! You even showed that you don’t want your son to go on a long journey. If Xia ruofei changes his mind, wouldn’t all your previous efforts be in vain?

Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand.”Big brother Tang, I’ve been meaning to discuss this issue with you. I’ve been meaning to discuss it with you.” Haoran is still young, so it’s best for him to live with his parents. He also needs to receive a systematic cultural education, so I don’t plan to bring him back to China for the time being. ”

Tang Yitian heard this and said anxiously,””Ruofei, Jennifer is a woman, she doesn’t know ...”

“Big brother Tang, let me finish!” Xia ruofei smiled.”I didn’t plan to bring Haoran back to China! I’ve already passed on this stage of cultivation to Haoran, and I’ll guide him in his cultivation these few days. Once he’s mastered it, I can return home with a peace of mind. Remember to supervise his cultivation every day, and call me if there’s any problem. ”

Tang Yitian was relieved, then he asked,””Ruofei, if you can’t explain it clearly over the phone ...”

“You can bring Haoran to Huaxia to find me at any time!” Xia ruofei said,”also, if time permits, I will try to come to Australia a few more times. After all, I have a business here! While guiding Haoran’s cultivation, you can also come and visit my farm and winery. ” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Then I’m relieved!” Tang Yitian was overjoyed. Ruofei, give me a call whenever you want to come over. I’ll send a private jet to pick you up!”

Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand,”we’ll see!” I won’t be able to take it if the battle is too big ...”

Tang Yitian laughed out loud. In his opinion, people at Xia ruofei’s level didn’t care about worldly wealth at all. Although Xia ruofei also had a company, in Tang Yitian’s eyes, this should be Xia ruofei’s way of cultivating in the secular world. After all, he couldn’t figure out the actions of such a master.

Soon, everyone was full and Jennifer suggested,””Xia, Lin, why don’t we go out to sea on a yacht? The night view of the sea is also very good!”

Hearing that, Lin Qiao immediately said happily,””Good, good! I’ve been wanting to come to Sydney on a yacht for a long time, but ruofei bro never brought me ...”

“Then let’s go tonight!” Tang Yitian laughed. I’ll order people to make preparations. Even if you want to spend the night on the yacht, there’s no problem!”

Lin Qiao’s eyes lit up and she said,”then what are we waiting for?” Let’s go!”

Then, Lin Qiao stood up first and walked out with Tang Haoran.

Xia ruofei was very fond of Lin Qiao. He shook his head with a bitter smile and immediately followed her.
