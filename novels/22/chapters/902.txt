Song Wei subconsciously took the small porcelain bottle. She was both surprised and worried. Her lips trembled as she said,”RUO Fei, I ... Can I really be completely cured?”

Song Qiming and Fang Liyun felt a little dizzy from the huge surprise.

“Ruofei, we ... We don’t know how to thank you,” Fang Liyun quickly said.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”aunt Fang, you’re welcome.” Besides, we’ll only know the real effect after Song Wei has taken it for a while!”

“Ruofei, you made the medicine yourself. It’ll be fine!” Song Qiming said excitedly.

Two days ago, when he was reporting to elder song on the phone, he had also mentioned that he wanted Xia ruofei to treat Song Wei.

Elder song said indifferently,””Since little Xia has made a move, you don’t have to worry anymore ...”

Song Qiming understood the weight of elder song’s words, so he had unprecedented confidence in Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”uncle song, you think too highly of me ... By the way, I’ll send you the medicine for the next course of treatment in half a month!” The main thing was that this pill wasn’t easy to concoct, and some of the medicinal herbs were relatively rare. Also, I have to make some adjustments to the formula based on Song Wei’s condition after the first course of treatment, so I haven’t made any medicine yet. ”

In fact, the 50 pills were ready, but Xia ruofei could not give song Qiming and the others the impression that they were easy to make.

The poison itself was very difficult to deal with. Even the best Hospitals, the most advanced equipment, and famous Chinese doctors could not do anything about it. It was already beyond the imagination of ordinary people that Xia ruofei could deal with it. If it was not difficult at all and could be easily dealt with, it would be too shocking.

“Alright, thank you, ruofei,” song Qiming said gratefully. By the way, the herbs you used must be very precious, right? The cost ...”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and interrupted song Qiming.””Uncle song, elder song was the old general that I admired the most when I was in the Army. You’re his junior, and you have a good reputation in the southwest. That’s why I helped you. You and I don’t need to talk about money. Besides ... Some medicine can’t be bought with money.”

“That’s right ...” Song Qiming no longer had the air of a Provincial Minister. He was full of gratitude towards Xia ruofei.

He even said half – jokingly,”in terms of seniority, I’m elder song’s grandnephew, so we should be friends of the same generation!” I think I was the one who took advantage of you the last time you called me uncle song ...”

Guangzhi Cao almost cried out in surprise. An ordinary person would laugh in their sleep if they could call someone like song Qiming “uncle song”. However, master Xia was on the same level as Secretary song. If that was the case, he would have to call him “uncle Xia”.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.”Uncle song, how can you say that? I’m not related to elder song by blood. We’ll just do our own thing. Otherwise, Song Wei would have to call me uncle. How uncomfortable would I be?”

Song Wei’s face heated up slightly and she said with a coy expression,”How is this related to me?”

“Weiwei, you should call him uncle RUO Fei!” Song Qiming laughed.

“Don ‘t, don’ t, don’t ... I’m about the same age as Song Wei, don’t make me sound old!” Xia ruofei quickly said.

Song Wei couldn’t help but burst into laughter when she heard this. She quickly glanced at Xia ruofei and then lowered her eyes to look at the porcelain bottle that contained her hope. Her beautiful eyes revealed a trace of splendor.

Fang Liyun rolled her eyes at her husband and said,”Old song, we’re in front of the children! You don’t act like an elder ...”

Song Qiming smiled like a child, which was a rare sight.

A leader of his level rarely showed his emotions on his face, but he was really happy today.

Fang Liyun rolled her eyes at song Qiming before asking,””RUO Fei! Is there anything I need to pay attention to when taking this medicine?”

“Yes, yes, yes, tell us quickly.” Song Qiming quickly said,”it’s such a precious medicine. Don’t waste it because you didn’t use it properly ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”there’s nothing special to take note of, but it’s best to take it after a meal!” Remember, once a day. Don’t take too much. ”

At this point, Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,””If she still faints after taking the medicine, give Song Wei the half bottle of medicine I left last time. There’s a process to the treatment, and fainting is normal during this period. You don’t have to be too nervous. ”

Xia ruofei was clear about the condition of the poison in Song Wei’s body. At the beginning of the treatment, when she did not consume much of the petals of the spirit Heart Flower, the poison wreaked havoc in her hand’s shaoyin heart meridian. It was possible for her to faint once or twice. However, as her intake increased, the poison was gradually removed. As time passed, Song Wei would naturally not faint again.

Xia ruofei was worried that song Qiming and the others would be nervous, so he gave them a heads up.

“Alright, alright.” Fang Liyun said hurriedly.

Although Xia ruofei’s “medical advice” was very simple, she still memorized it with all her heart. Her nervous look made it seem like she was memorizing a very complicated scientific formula.
