The biggest difference between him and Bao Guijun and the other free laborers was that he could barely be considered a cultivator. Even though his cultivation was very low, he had indeed seriously cultivated an incomplete cultivation method.

This was also the reason why Xia ruofei had a relatively deep impression of him. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

However, Xia ruofei obviously didn’t care for such a low – Level cultivator. He was just asking casually.

After hearing Xia Qing’s words, Xia ruofei said,””With such a low cultivation, what can he do? Let him take care of it! It’s a waste to give him good medicine!”

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing nodded.

“I’ll give you a task,” Xia ruofei said.”Brew a pot of Chinese medicine according to this prescription!”

Xia ruofei first handed a prescription to Xia Qingyuan. It was a nourishing prescription that he had randomly chosen when he was brewing the Chinese medicine a few days ago. In order to ensure that the “taste” was the same, he still needed the same Chinese medicine this time.

Xia ruofei was completely at ease when he handed this matter over to Xia Qing. In terms of brewing Chinese medicine, Xia Qing was even better than him.

After Xia Qing took the prescription, Xia ruofei stretched out his hand and beckoned for a small half – bottle of diluted spirit Heart Flower petal solution. He also handed it to Xia Qing and said,””After the Chinese medicine is boiled, add this ... Just add it to this position.”

Xia ruofei roughly calculated the ratio and touched the bottle with his hand. A clear scratch appeared on the bottle.

“Understood!” Xia Qing took the bottle and said,”master, this is very simple. You can rest assured and leave it to me!”

Xia ruofei nodded.”Remember to mix it well after you’re done. Leave the rest to me.”

In the spirit map space, there was a small vacuum filling bottle that Xia ruofei had bought previously. It was mainly used to seal and store the medicinal soup.

Xia Qing definitely didn’t know how to use this kind of modern machinery, and it wasn’t easy to learn. So Xia ruofei decided that the final step was better to do it himself.

After handing over the task of brewing the medicine to Xia Qing, Xia ruofei walked across the Jade Bridge and came to the Linglong Pagoda in the center of the pool.

He looked up at the tower of delicacy and then strode into it.

Once Xia ruofei entered the Linglong tower, he looked at the wall.

Sure enough, the number on the screen changed to “three” again!

Xia ruofei nodded and turned to leave the Linglong tower. He started to practice the floating Lotus steps in the open space in front of the tower without any distractions.

Although he had not practiced for a few days, Xia ruofei had already built a solid foundation for the floating steps. He did not feel awkward when he practiced it.

In fact, mastering the basic movement technique was only the most basic level. The drifting steps technique combined movement technique, body shape, true Qi, and mental energy. Under the influence of many factors, there were countless possibilities.

And the most exquisite part was fumbled out from these countless possibilities.

This part was entirely up to one’s own comprehension. Even if there were cultivation experiences left behind by predecessors in the Jade talisman of inheritance, it could only be used as a reference.

It was like a simple principle that might not be useful even if someone said it a hundred times. Only when one had a personal understanding of it would one truly understand this principle.

Challenging the Jade pillar array was to bring out one’s potential under extreme conditions. Often, the flash of inspiration in that situation would be better than the effect of practicing it a hundred or a thousand times.

This was the most precious part of the Jade pillar array. Xia ruofei even felt that the reward for challenging the array was not as precious as the Jade pillar array itself.

Now, Xia ruofei was fully focused on practicing the Jade pillar formation over and over again. His goal was to sort out his understanding and comprehension from the previous stage and adjust his state of mind.

It was only under such circumstances that the effect of challenging the Jade pillar array would be the best.

After all, there were only three chances every seven days, so he naturally couldn’t waste it.

Xia ruofei practiced for more than a hundred times and felt that he was almost ready. He stopped and drank a few sips of the spiritual pool water to speed up the recovery of his spiritual power.

After a short rest, Xia ruofei walked into the Linglong tower and started his first challenge without hesitation.

The familiar Jade pillars, the familiar light spots ... Xia ruofei advanced at an extremely fast speed in the first 30 meters. The lights that were moving at random speeds and strange angles did not hinder him at all. His body seemed to have turned into an afterimage, floating left and right, looking very confident.

After 40 meters, Xia ruofei felt the pressure gradually increasing.

He perked up and circulated his mental energy and true Qi to the extreme. He didn’t even have time to think about how to deal with it. Most of the time, he had to rely on his subconscious reactions.

Fifty meters, sixty meters ...

Finally, Xia ruofei’s score was close to the best he had achieved in the previous challenge, and he felt that he still had energy to spare.

It seemed like his condition had improved after a few days of rest and not practicing the floating steps.

Hence, it was necessary to strike a balance between work and rest at times.

After 60 meters, Xia ruofei was no longer as confident as he was when he crossed the first 30 to 40 meters. He looked a little disheveled. There were a few times when the Halo almost brushed against his clothes. According to the rules of the Linglong tower, as long as the Halo touched him, even if it was just a little skin or a scratch on his clothes, it would immediately be judged as a failure. Then, Xia ruofei would be expelled by the power of the array without any ability to resist.
