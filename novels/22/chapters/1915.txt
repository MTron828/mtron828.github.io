Chapter 1916 Going all out (1)

“Boss is taking advantage of the information asymmetry,” Xu Yougang said with a smile.”Liu Dong’s mind is already in a mess after the sudden change. As long as we give him a little guidance, he will definitely follow the path we set! The boss was well – versed in psychological games! Liu Dong’s reactions were all within his calculations. ”

Xu Yougang paused and continued,””As for WeChat communication, it’s for two reasons. First, it’s convenient to send pictures, and second ... It’s also to avoid leaving messages with your own voice. Although we used a voice changer, some of the characteristics of a voice, including habits such as tone, can’t be changed by a voice changer. I’m just taking precautions!”

Zeng Liang couldn’t help but click his tongue and say,””That’s too cautious ...”

Xu Yougang smiled.”We can’t help it. Our opponent’s background is too strong. We can’t be too careful. This is also what the boss wants.”

“Understood!” Zeng Liang said lazily,”we’ve already calculated to this extent. No matter how strong the opponent is, it’s hard for him to escape this time!”

“Hehe! Boss’s plan is almost flawless, and all kinds of situations have been anticipated, but the result still depends on the effect of our execution. So, we can’t be careless!” Xu Yougang said.

“Don’t worry!” Zeng Liang said.

Then, he stood up and packed his equipment as he said,””You take command in the middle, I’ll be in position!”

“Be careful!” Xu Yougang said,”keep the communication going!”

“OK!”Zeng Liang grinned at Xu Yougang, put on his shoulder bag, turned around, and walked out of the rented apartment.

……

Liu Dong’s taxi soon arrived at the entrance of the night bar on Chunfeng Road. He was so anxious that he didn’t notice that there was a car following him from a distance.

At the entrance of the bar, Liu Dong bumped into a young man in a cap who was looking at his phone while walking. Liu Dong, who was in a bad mood, could not help but glare at the young man. However, the young man in the cap had a good attitude and apologized repeatedly.

Liu Dong was not in the mood to argue with an irrelevant person. He said in a bad mood,””Next time, be careful when you walk!”

With that, he pushed open the door of the bar and walked in.

The young man in the cap pressed his Bluetooth headset as he walked and said,””Wang Chong, try the signal!”

This man was Zhang Aijun. After he followed Liu haojun into the Urban area, he didn’t go to the West Lake Mansion. Instead, he came to Chunfeng Road to wait for orders.

Zhang Aijun’s mission was to find an opportunity to place a very small bug in Liu Dong’s pocket when he arrived.

The bug was small and light, almost made into a thin sheet. Even if Liu Dong put his hand into his pocket, he would not be able to find it unless he looked for it.

Of course, the side effect of making it so small was that it could not last long. The bug could only work for three hours, but it was enough for the mission.

On the road not far from the night bar, Wang Chong sat in the van. After adjusting the parameters on a small device, he put on his earphones and chuckled.”Very clear! I’ll send the signal to squad leader Xu!” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Alright! Then I’ll be on standby in the car!” Zhang Aijun said.

The middle row of the van had been modified. There was a work desk in front of the seat, a listening device, and some other equipment. The power source came from an inverted computer, which directly used the van’s battery. As long as the van didn’t turn off the engine, there was plenty of electricity.

Wang Chong used an audio cable to connect the audio signal he had received to his laptop. Then, he opened a software and established a connection with the laptop in his rented apartment several kilometers away, quickly sending the real – time audio signal back.

Xu Yougang, who was in the rental house, easily realized long – distance monitoring.

……

Liu Dong walked into the night bar, which was filled with strong soundwaves, and struggled to move forward in the crowd.

The bar’s business was very good. In the midst of the loud music, people raised their arms high under the flashing lights and twisted their bodies to the rhythm of the music, looking like a group of demons dancing.

Liu Dong pushed his way through the crowd and found the first private room of the bar.

Da Liu had brought Dong Liu to the night bar once, so Dong Liu knew that this was Da Liu’s private room. Whenever he appeared in the night bar, he would definitely be in this room. If he didn’t come to the bar, the private room must be empty. No one would dare to open it for other customers.

Two burly Men in Black suits were standing at the door of the private room, and they stopped Liu Dong.

“I’m Da Liu’s relative!”Liu Dong quickly said. I’m Liu Dong, he brought me here before. I have something urgent to talk to him about, please go in and tell him!”

The two men looked at Liu Dong from head to toe, and the man on the right said,””Just because you say they’re brother DA’s relatives, they’re brother DA’s relatives? What if brother da doesn’t know you at all? Aren’t we going to be scolded by brother da?”

“I have Da Liu’s number!” Said Liu Dong. If you don’t believe me, I’ll call him directly!”

After that, Liu Dong took out his phone and quickly found Da Liu’s phone number, showing it to the two men.
