Chapter 1203: Feng Jing’s new target (2)

Translator: 549690339

“You’re thinking too much. When it’s the 11/11 Gala, they’ll have to deal with millions of orders in a second. There won’t be any big problems!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”we have over 100 billion transactions a day. It’s fine even with such a large number of visits. With our level of data, it’s nothing ...”

“You’re right,”Feng Jing chuckled,” although I’ve been following up the entire time, it still feels like a dream. 100 million Yuan a minute! It’s like they’re snatching money!”

“Don’t say that in public,” Xia ruofei said.”Our cost is very high!”

Xia ruofei winked at Feng Rao after he finished speaking. Feng Rao couldn’t help but giggle.

“Chairman, I have something to report to you ...” Feng Jing said seriously.

“What do you think ...” Xia ruofei rubbed his eyes and sat in a daze for more than ten hours on the plane. He felt a little tired mentally, so he leaned back in his seat and closed his eyes to rest.

“I’ve been looking for a suitable building in the city recently ...”Feng Jing said.

Xia ruofei opened his eyes and smiled.”I was wondering why you came to pick us up personally today! It must be because of this!”

Xia ruofei knew that Feng Jing wanted to speed up the construction of the company’s headquarters. After all, it would be more convenient to manage the company in Taoyuan farm in the early stages. However, as the company grew, it would not be appropriate for the company’s headquarters to be in the suburbs farm.

Xia ruofei had already realized this, but he could not find the time to do it.

Feng Rao smiled shyly and nodded.

“Tell me!” Xia ruofei said. What have you gained recently?”

“It’s like this ... I found a property that I think is suitable in all aspects.” Feng Rao organized her thoughts and said,”this property is located on Xishan Road in the Bell Tower District. It’s a good location ...”

“Just tell me about this property!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Yes, Chairman.” Feng Jing nodded and said,”this is an office building called Hengli building. It was jointly developed by the provincial power construction Group and a real estate company.”

Xia ruofei frowned and said,””State – owned enterprise?”

“Yes, I am!” Feng Rao said,”the power construction Group was the one who invested the land. The building was built with the money from bojun land. It has a total of 15 floors. The first to ninth floors belong to bojun real estate, and the tenth to fifteenth floors belong to the power construction Group. The part that we’re going to sell now is the property rights of the power construction Group, the tenth to fifteenth floors!”

Xia ruofei thought for a moment and nodded.””This kind of joint development is common, but under normal circumstances, there should be a clause in their contract that gives priority to the acquisition!”

Feng Rao smiled.”I’ve done my research. There are indeed terms for priority acquisition in the contract, but bojun real estate hasn’t been doing well in the past two years. There’s a problem with their cash flow, and they can’t take over this part of the estate. They’ve already stated that they’ve given up on priority acquisition, so the current situation is that the estates on the tenth to fifteenth floors are for public sale, and the one in charge is the provincial SASAC!”

“What’s the price?” Xia ruofei asked.

Feng Rao had obviously done her homework. She said without thinking,””As far as I know, the state – owned assets Control Commission wanted to use the auction method at first, but not many companies responded, so they changed to inquiry mode. I specifically organized a team to analyze it. If we bid 30000 per square meter, we should be able to get it.”

Then, before Xia ruofei could ask, Feng Jing threw out another set of data.””The area of each floor of the Hengli building is about 1500 square meters. The Power Construction Company has a total of six floors, so the total area is about 9000 square meters. In this case, the total price is about 270 million Yuan! Our company currently has around 150 million Yuan in liquid funds, and the subsequent sales of the jaded skin cream can still bring in a large amount of cash flow. As long as we ask for an installment during the purchase negotiation and the terms of payment within one or two years, we can afford it even if we don’t apply for a bank loan!”

Feng Rao became more and more excited as she spoke. She turned to Xia ruofei and said,””Chairman, I personally think this is a very good opportunity!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Oh?” There must be a good reason for President Feng to be so optimistic about this business. If you can convince me, I will fully support your acquisition! Don’t worry about the funds!”

Feng Rao nodded and said,””Chairman, first of all, this is a ready – made building. It was originally an office building. After we bought it, we can put it into use immediately after some simple renovation. The relocation of our company’s headquarters is already something that we have to do. In this case, it’s obviously much faster to buy it directly than to buy the land and build it again!”

Xia ruofei nodded but did not say anything.

Hence, Feng Jing continued,”the second reason is that the electricity construction company’s property is located on the 10th to 15th floor of the building, which is obviously better than the 9th floor below. From the outside, the Heng Li building is located on Xishan Road in the Zhong Lou District of the center of Sanshan city. That is the CBD area, and there are many office buildings nearby. Even if it’s only half of the building, it’s still a great improvement to our company’s image!”

“En!” Xia ruofei nodded and said,”there’s a third point?”

“Of course!” Feng Jing smiled and said,”thirdly, if we buy it, we’ll become one of the two owners of the Hengli building. As for the owner of the first to ninth floors, bojun real estate, as I’ve said just now, they’ve been doing poorly in the past two years and their capital chain is on the verge of breaking. They might have to deal with some of their businesses in the future to cash out, which means ...”

Xia ruofei continued Feng Jing’s sentence and said,””In other words, if we buy the Hengli building’s electricity construction company’s part of the business, it’s very likely that we’ll be able to buy the remaining 1st to 9th floors from bojun real estate in the future. Then, the entire building will belong to our company!”

“Yes!” Feng Rao said excitedly. According to our analysis, it’s highly possible. Bojun real estate isn’t in a good position. ”

“Chairman,” Feng Jing continued,”this way, it’s very likely that we’ll have our own building. By then, it won’t be called the balance power building anymore. It’ll be called the Paradise building!”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and nodded.””Mm! In this case ... If our company continues to grow and expand in the future, we’ll have enough space. Boss Feng, this is a sustainable acquisition plan!”

Feng Rao looked at Xia ruofei uneasily and asked,””Chairman, what do you mean?”

“Sure!” Xia ruofei said concisely.

Feng Rao was stunned for a moment before she reacted. She was overjoyed and said happily,””Chairman, you agree!”

Xia ruofei laughed.”You’ve given so many reasons, and they’re all very good. I agree with you, so of course I’ll agree!” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Xia ruofei looked at Feng Jing with a strange expression and said,””CEO Feng, you can’t be thinking that I’m not very happy about the relocation of the headquarters, right?”

Feng Jing thought to herself, you’ve always been a passive person, but it seems like I misunderstood you. It’s not that you don’t want to spend money to move the headquarters, you’re just ... Lazy!

Although she was complaining in her heart, she still went easy on Xia ruofei since he had already agreed to her plan to acquire the Hengli building.

She smiled and said,”no, no... In the past, we didn’t have enough funds, so even if we had an idea, it was difficult to implement it!” The whole company is yours, so how can you be so negative?”

Xia ruofei glanced at Feng Rao and said with a smile,””It seems that the hot sales of the jaded skin cream has boosted boss Feng’s confidence! You’re already so eager to try a 200 to 300 million acquisition, this was something you didn’t even dare to think about before!”
