2180 A smooth return (2)

The next morning, the sun rose slowly, sprinkling golden light on the sea.

Xia ruofei only woke up when the sun shone through the window. He washed up and went to the deck of the bridge.

Looking at the sparkling sea, Xia ruofei felt relaxed and happy.

This trip out to sea could be said to be very fruitful. The biggest harvest was naturally green travel Immortal Island. That magnificent immortal abode must have become the place that Xia ruofei was constantly thinking about. The wooden token in his body was constantly being refined. Compared to after he broke through to the Golden core stage, the refining speed should be much faster!

Other than the realm stones and origin crystals he had obtained on The Enchanted Island, the spiritual Python golden core was also a huge surprise. It allowed Xia ruofei’s cultivation to reach refined Qi level 8. His spiritual power had also broken through a major realm and reached the spirit gathering realm, which was equivalent to a golden core cultivator. It could be said that this trip to the sea had completely transformed Xia ruofei.

In addition, he had also collected a lot of marine creatures in the sea, including the rare blue lobster. Those marine creatures were now living freely in the sea of the spirit map space, but in time, they would continue to reproduce and strengthen their group.

When the blue lobster was caught, there were many young lobsters attached to it. If they were lucky, a group of blue lobsters might even appear in the sea of space.

Xia ruofei was in a good mood. He shouted at the sea for a while before returning to the lower cabin in satisfaction. He took out bread, milk, and eggs from the medium space and made himself a simple breakfast.

After breakfast, Xia ruofei went to the cockpit and found the yacht dock on the main control computer. He set the auto – Pilot route, then lifted the anchor and set off on the way home.

After almost two hours of sailing, Xia ruofei could already see the yacht Pier in the distance. There were also some ships around him. He switched to manual driving mode and contacted the pier through the small radio on the yacht, telling them that he would be docking in a while.

As for the Yacht Club, they were actually a little worried about the Paradise Cruise going out for so many days.

Especially since the yacht’s owner was driving the yacht out to sea alone. Even if Xia ruofei had a yacht driving license, he was not a professional yacht driver and was all alone. If anything happened to him at sea, there would be no one to take care of him.

After the yacht set sail, there was no news from it, nor did it contact the Yacht Club. Everyone was naturally very worried.

Therefore, when the staff on duty received the news that paradise was about to dock, they were very excited. They quickly called Qin Lan to inform her that Xia ruofei was definitely a big customer and that Qin Lan was usually the one who followed up on his matters.

Xia ruofei was getting more and more familiar with the yacht. He drove the yacht back to his exclusive berth with ease.

A staff member was already waiting there. He took the cable that Xia ruofei had thrown over and fixed the yacht to the dock.

By the time Xia ruofei returned to the shore, Qin Lan had already arrived at the dock in the electric car.

“Mr. Xia, you’re finally back!” Qin Lan said the moment they met.

Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”what’s wrong?” Is there something urgent, manager Qin?”

“You’ve been out for so many days and there’s been no news from you. Our club’s staff are all worried about you!” Qin Lan said in a coquettish manner.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”actually, I didn’t go far. I’m still in the nearby waters.” And most of the time, they stopped the ship to rest! It’s just that the scenery on the sea is very beautiful and leisurely. So many days have passed unknowingly ...”

“It’s good that you’re back, it’s good that you’re back ...” Qin Lan said,”Mr. Xia, you can’t disappear like this next time. Everyone was worried to death ... This time, we tried to call you through the radio, but there was no response ...”

Xia ruofei smiled awkwardly and said,””I’m still not very familiar with the radio station ...” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

In fact, he didn’t even turn on his phone. He only turned it on when he was about to return to the port.

“Thank you for your concern, manager Qin.” Xia ruofei smiled.”I’ll leave the yacht to you. We’ll be away for a few days this time. You have to clean it up and take care of it ...”

“Don’t worry!” Qin Lan said.

Xia ruofei and Qin Lan arrived at the club in an electric car.

His Knight XV off – Road vehicle was parked there, and there was a layer of dust on it.

“Mr. Xia,” Qin Lan said,”we have a free car wash service here. When we received the news of your return, we wanted to help you wash your car. But you didn’t leave the car key, so ...”

“I’m fine!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’ll find a car wash later. It’ll be the same.”

“That’s so troublesome! There’s a professional car wash center right next to us, it’s dedicated to club members “service!” Qin Lan said,”just give me the car keys. You can also go in and have a cup of tea and rest!”

“Then ... I’ll have to trouble you!” Xia ruofei said.

He put his hand into his pocket and took out the car key from the medium and handed it to Qin Lan.

Qin Lan immediately called a staff member over and gave him a few instructions before handing him the car keys.

Then, she enthusiastically led Xia ruofei to the club’s reception hall.

Through the floor – to – Ceiling glass, he could see the car washing situation next door.

In fact, this Yacht Club also provided maintenance services for luxury cars. After all, those who owned yachts were basically rich people, and they must all drive luxury cars.

As for the car wash, it was a free service for the club members.

Qin Lan personally accompanied Xia ruofei to wait in the hall. She asked with a smile,””Mr. Xia, how did it feel to go out to sea this time? Are you satisfied with the performance and comfort of the azmu yacht?”

“Not bad!” Xia ruofei said. I’ve made the right choice by buying this yacht!”

“Then, please help me promote it. If your friend needs to buy a yacht, I’ll give him the biggest discount!” Qin Lan said.

“I will! I will!” Xia ruofei laughed.

In fact, although he knew a lot of rich people, there were not many local people in San Shan. People like Tang Yitian, Tang He, and MA Xiong from Hong Kong had all bought luxury yachts a long time ago.

As a business manager, Qin Lan built up her network through this. She did not care how sincere Xia ruofei was. Even if there was only a one percent chance, it was enough for her to put in 100 percent of her effort. After all, the Commission for selling a yacht was quite high.

Qin Lan accompanied Xia ruofei the entire time and did not handle any other business.

After the car was washed, she personally sent Xia ruofei to the door and waved goodbye to him. Her service could be said to be quite good.

Xia ruofei drove away from the Yacht Club and headed straight for the villa area.

He gave Ling Qingxue a call on the way.

Ling Qingxue teased,”you’re finally willing to come back?” I thought you found an Immortal Island on the sea and then flew away with the fairy on the island!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I really did find a mystical island!” I’ll bring you around when I have the chance in the future? I guarantee that you’ll never leave!”

“Virtue!” Ling Qingxue lowered her eyes and said, obviously not believing Xia ruofei’s words.

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly,”why don’t you believe me when I’m telling you the truth?” Forget it, forget it ... Let’s not talk about this anymore, you’ll know in the future! Qingxue, are you in the office?”

“Then why not?” Ling Qingxue said resentfully,”you went out to sea without me ...”

Xia ruofei looked at his watch and said,””Then I’ll come to the company to pick you up! I’ll go to the supermarket to buy some groceries first. We’ll have lunch at my house! I’ll cook for you!”

“Alright then!” “I want to eat kun fish!” Ling Qingxue said happily.

“I’ll get the farm to send one over immediately. If we want to eat it, we’ll eat it alive!” Xia ruofei said without hesitation.

“This is more like it!” Ling Qingxue said,”see you later! Come here a few minutes earlier. I don’t have much to do today, so I should be able to leave early!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said.

After he hung up, he turned the steering wheel and was ready to buy some ingredients at the nearby Walmart.

At this moment, his heart suddenly moved. He felt that the white fox in the space seemed to have moved.

Xia ruofei smiled and mumbled to himself,””This little fellow is finally going to wake up?”
