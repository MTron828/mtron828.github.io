3161 An amazing night (1)

After eating and drinking, Xia ruofei asked the staff to arrange for the drunk song Rui and the others to rest in the guest rooms. He also instructed them to have someone take care of them to prevent them from suffocating in their sleep.

Then, he chatted with Zhao Yongjun, who was about 60 – 70% drunk, before bringing Song Wei and Ling Qingxue back to the villa above the array.

Mu Sheng and the others all found their own rooms and went back to rest.

Chen Xuan was the only one who was still under the living room’s light, looking at his coding on his laptop.

He raised his head and looked at Xia ruofei.””Brother Xia, you’re back!”

“MMH! The bug hasn’t been resolved yet?” Xia ruofei asked,”what is yang Xincheng doing? Why do I have to rely on you to solve everything? What if you’re not in the company anymore?”

Chen Xuan chuckled.”I’m sure that chief yang doesn’t care about these specific matters. The reason why he assigned this job to me is mainly because I’m more efficient. In the future, when I leave the company, other people will be able to take on these tasks.”

Xia ruofei forced a smile and said,”I feel like this Paradise Mall project has become your obsession!” Alright, you can continue with your work! We’re going back to our room, you should rest early too!”

“Got it!” Chen Xuan waved his hand. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

The villa was not big, so there was a limited number of rooms. Since there were so many people today, Xia ruofei, Song Wei, and Ling Qingxue could only occupy one room.

To Chen Xuan and the rest, Song Wei and Ling Qingxue were both Xia ruofei’s cultivation partners. It was no problem for the three of them to live together.

However, Xia ruofei was well aware of this, so he was prepared not to sleep tonight.

The three of them entered the largest master bedroom.

Xia ruofei looked at the wide Simmons bed and coughed.””Um ... Weiwei, Qingxue, you guys sleep in the bed tonight. I have to rush to write the algorithm architecture, so I might not be able to sleep.”

Ling Qingxue chuckled.”Staying up late isn’t good for your health. Besides, you guys aren’t in a hurry. Why write through the night?” Let’s just sleep together! The bed is big enough anyway ...”

Song Wei blushed and pinched Qingxue’s arm secretly. She whispered,”You, how dare you say anything?”

Ling Qingxue chuckled and said,”what are you afraid of?” Does he really dare to do anything to us?”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry,”alright! I admit defeat, okay? You guys go wash up and sleep! I’m not sleepy after drinking, so I can sort out the thoughts I had during the day. ”

Ling Qingxue wanted to tease Xia ruofei a little more, but Song Wei dragged her to the master bedroom’s bathroom to wash up.

Xia ruofei sat down cross – legged on the bay window. He took out a laptop from the space, calmed his mind, and began to write code.

After a while, Xia ruofei heard the sound of running water coming from the bathroom. He could not help but be surprised.

Ling Qingxue and Song Wei were taking a bath together?

He had thought that the two of them were just washing up inside, but he didn’t expect them to be taking a bath together.

He was naturally very familiar with their bodies, so he couldn’t help but start to imagine the scene in the bathroom. He suddenly felt an evil fire surging up.

Xia ruofei quickly took a few deep breaths and forced himself to focus on his computer screen.

But the more he didn’t want to hear it, the more the sound of water seemed to drill into his ears.

The Golden core stage cultivator Xia ruofei had no choice but to use his vital Qi to seal off his hearing to escape from that alluring voice.

After a while, Song Wei and Ling Qingxue walked out of the washroom. Xia ruofei almost vomited blood again.

Both of them were wearing silk pajamas with suspenders, showing off their exquisite figures.

The two of them both had storage rings, so they were probably quite sleepy.

Song Wei was still a little shy and lowered her head while blushing. Ling Qingxue walked around Xia ruofei on purpose and smiled.”Ruofei, are you really not going to sleep? Then we’re going to rest?”

Xia ruofei turned his face away and said with a bitter smile,””Qingxue, stop it ... Go to sleep!”

After finally coaxing the two to sleep, Xia ruofei sat by the bay window and started to code.

However, there were two close female friends sleeping not far away from him. Furthermore, they were dressed so seductively. How could Xia ruofei calm down so easily?

If not for the fact that he was afraid that everyone would misunderstand, he would have even thought of accompanying Chen Xuan in the living room. The atmosphere there was more suitable for coding farmers!

Xia ruofei wrote and stopped. Finally, he calmed down and focused more on the algorithm architecture.

After listening to Wang Chi and the rest’s exchange, especially the free discussion segment, Xia ruofei had gained a lot of inspiration.

The knowledge that had stopped at the theoretical level was now connected to actual practice.

He had turned many of his thoughts during the day into code that could be recognized and operated by the supercomputer.

In fact, the process of cracking the logic was very simple.

The first step was image recognition, which required him to accurately identify each set of floating point images.

The next step was to list out the possibilities of the Chinese characters corresponding to each set of floating point patterns and then combine them according to the existing floating point patterns. This step could only be completed by a supercomputer, and the possibilities were astronomical. The human brain could not calculate all of them in a lifetime.

As for the third step, it was to make a logical judgment, eliminate the answers that were not smooth at all, and rank them according to the probability. This step was the most challenging step. The machine itself would not make a judgment, so it must be given a judgment logic.

This was also the reason why Xia ruofei had to search for sufficient information on the ancient language and make a matching database.

This process sounded simple and clear, but to really put it into practice, every step had to be done with code, which was not so simple.

There would be many problems in every process that Xia ruofei had to solve.

He gradually immersed himself in the world of coding. As his logic became clearer and he solved more and more problems, Xia ruofei felt that his brain was getting more and more active and excited.

Before he knew it, it was already three in the morning.

In order not to disturb Song Wei and Ling Qingxue’s rest, Xia ruofei had already turned off all the lights in the room.

Song Wei opened her eyes in a daze and turned to see Xia ruofei sitting by the bay window. His fingers were still flying on the keyboard of his laptop. The faint light from the computer screen reflected his extremely focused face.

The drowsy Song Wei was in a daze for a moment. She felt that Xia ruofei’s focused look was especially charming. She was a little mesmerized by him even with her head tilted ...

At this moment, Xia ruofei stopped and stretched. Then, he took out a bottle of spirit pool water from the spirit map space and took a few gulps.

Song Wei quickly looked away. Her face was still a little hot because she felt that her actions just now were a little infatuated ...

Song Wei thought for a while, then gently lifted the blanket and got out of bed.

...

Xia ruofei heard the noise and turned around immediately. When he saw Song Wei, he raised his hand to look at his watch. He was so focused on his work that he had forgotten the time. When he saw Song Wei, he thought it was already morning.

It was only threeo’ clock when Xia ruofei quickly asked,””Wei Wei, why are you up at this time? Did I wake you up?”

“No...” Song Wei said,”I had a dream and then I woke up ...”

Afraid of waking Ling Qingxue up, the two of them spoke very softly.

“Oh, oh! Then you should go to sleep!” Xia ruofei said,”it’s still early! I can still sleep for a few hours ...”

“Ruofei, why don’t ...” Song Wei hesitated for a moment and said,”why don’t ... You sleep on the bed for a while too!”

She mustered up the courage to say this, but her face and even her ears had already turned red.

Ever since she got together with Xia ruofei, Song Wei had always had a slight psychological barrier, and that was because of Ling Qingxue.

No matter how coincidental their relationship was, Song Wei could not escape the fact that she only became Xia ruofei’s girlfriend after Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue were together.

Therefore, whenever she and Ling Qingxue were by Xia ruofei’s side, she would always consciously weaken her presence. Even when she was alone with Xia ruofei, she would have a slight psychological barrier when it came to intimate behavior and needed Xia ruofei’s careful guidance.

This was the first time the three of them were in the same room.

...

That was why Song Wei could not fall asleep at first. However, she did not dare to open her eyes to look at Xia ruofei.

After that, she finally fell asleep in a daze. The quality of her sleep wasn’t good either. She kept dreaming and had completely woken up just now.

However, when Song Wei saw Xia ruofei sitting by the bay window alone and the focused expression on his face, her heart melted in the quiet midnight. It was as if a barrier had been broken.

Xia ruofei was slightly stunned. He hesitated and said,””This ... This isn’t very good! Besides ... I’m not sleepy!”

“Even if you’re not tired, you should still sleep!” Song Wei insisted,”you’re so young. Do you want to be like those cultivators who don’t eat or drink? Then what’s the fun in living?”

“Hehe! “Of course not ...” Xia ruofei laughed drily.”It’s today’s ...”

“Qingxue and I are both your girlfriends. What does that have to do with you?” Song Wei said,”besides ... I only told you to go to bed and sleep. I ... I didn’t tell you to do anything bad ...”

Song Wei endured her shyness as she finished her sentence. Her face was already burning hot.

Xia ruofei could not help but laugh when he saw Song Wei’s pouting face.

He looked at the sleeping Ling Qingxue and asked after some hesitation,””If Qingxue finds out tomorrow ...”

Song Wei rolled her eyes and said,”Qingxue wouldn’t care! Don’t you know her well enough?”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and nodded.””Alright then! I’m really tired, so I’ll sleep for a while ...”

Xia ruofei would not be a man if he still refused after all that was said!
