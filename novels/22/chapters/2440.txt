2441 Unlocking the Jade talisman (2)

In fact, with manager Lu’s status, how could he not get a few sets of jaded skin ointment if he wanted to? Sometimes, it wasn’t really troublesome to trouble others to do things properly. Instead, it was a display of closeness.

Manager Lu chuckled and nodded.””Then I won’t be polite with you! I’ll send you the address later!”

The two of them laughed and chatted at the door for a while before Xia ruofei drove away from the song family’s old house.

Xia ruofei was concerned about the heaven jade talisman, so after leaving the song family, he returned to the courtyard in liuhai Lane. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

When they stopped the car in the backyard, Xia ruofei said to Wu Qiang, who came forward,””I won’t be having dinner today. Also, if there’s nothing important, don’t come to my courtyard. I didn’t sleep well last night, so I’ll catch up on some sleep this afternoon. ”

“Okay, boss!” Wu Qiang quickly replied,”if you need supper, let me know at any time. I’ll ask sister – in – Law to get ready!”

Xia ruofei nodded and threw the car keys to Wu Qiang. Then, he walked through the backyard and arrived at the courtyard where Wu Qiang lived.

Xia ruofei returned to her room and immediately locked the door and windows before closing all the curtains.

Out of habit, he used his mental power to check the room. After making sure that there was nothing unusual in the room, he took out the spirit map scroll from his palm.

Xia ruofei placed the scroll under the blanket in his bedroom and entered the medium.

He had arrived at the Tao Wu at the Archean realm. There was a 30 – fold difference in time flow here, which could save Xia ruofei time.

Although the actual time he experienced had not changed, it had been shortened by thirty times according to the time in the outside world.

Xia ruofei estimated that it would take a long time for him to perfectly inscribe the array runes on the heaven jade talisman with his spiritual energy. He could not possibly study the array runes all the time, much less stay in the space for a few days. The difference in the flow of time at the Archean realm could solve this problem.

Xia ruofei waved his hand and the heaven jade talisman was teleported from somewhere in space and flew into Xia ruofei’s hand.

He looked left and right, then stepped onto the Jade Bridge and sat down cross – legged on the empty space in front of the Linglong Pagoda.

Although the spiritual Qi in the entire space was very dense, the Linglong Pagoda was the core of the formation in the spirit map world. The spiritual Qi here seemed to be even denser. Hence, Xia ruofei chose to break the heaven jade talisman here.

He first cultivated the “great Dao Arts.” After circulating his mental cultivation method a few times, his entire state of mind gradually calmed down.

Then, Xia ruofei stopped practicing and slowly opened his eyes. He looked at the ancient jade talisman in his hand.

The lines of mysterious patterns were very clear under the investigation of his spiritual power.

The array pattern on the heaven jade talisman was much more complicated than the earth jade talisman. Xia ruofei spent more than an hour just to go through all the array patterns.

One must know that Xia ruofei had inherited the knowledge of arrays and his spiritual power had reached the spirit gathering realm. Even so, it took him so much time to roughly go through the array patterns on the Jade talisman.

If he wanted to understand and understand it, it would take even longer.

In the end, if he wanted to decipher the heaven jade talisman, he not only had to understand it, but he also had to use his spiritual power to perfectly carve out the entire array pattern. That was even more difficult.

Fortunately, Xia ruofei was mentally prepared and did not feel anxious. He just sat on the ground calmly and studied the formation pattern on the Jade talisman.

Time passed by quietly. Unknowingly, Xia ruofei had already sat there for more than a day and a night. Of course, this was the time in the yuanchu realm. To the outside world, less than an hour had passed.

Xia ruofei remained in the same position and did not move. His eyes never left the array pattern on the heaven jade talisman. In these twenty hours, he didn’t even move his finger. He didn’t even try to carve. He just stared at the Jade talisman.

However, Xia ruofei’s eyes brightened and he looked more confident.

Although Xia ruofei looked at it for an entire day and night and did not seem to make any progress, he had actually gained a lot.

The array pattern on the Jade talisman became clearer and clearer in his eyes. He was even simulating the effect of the array pattern in his mind. Of course, these were all theoretical speculations. Xia ruofei himself was not very sure about the actual effect.

Xia ruofei could feel the fog covering the array pattern slowly dissipating.

Finally, he had a feeling of sudden enlightenment!

The formation patterns were still the same. However, in Xia ruofei’s eyes, the formation patterns that were initially unrelated had now become an organic whole. Every formation pattern, every curve, and every arc seemed to be just right.

Xia ruofei smiled.

At this moment, Xia ruofei, who had not moved for more than 20 hours, slowly raised his right hand. He stretched out his index finger and drew a line in the air. The invisible and intangible mental energy had a trace of golden light, leaving a mysterious arc in front of him.

Xia ruofei’s fingers were moving very fast. The array patterns were faintly visible in front of him. In a short while, he was completely surrounded by the array patterns.

But soon, Xia ruofei waved his hand gently and dispelled all the array runes that he had just spent a lot of mental energy to carve.

Then, Xia ruofei picked up the “heaven” jade talisman. He frowned and stared at one of the array patterns, studying it.

After a few more hours, Xia ruofei put down the Jade talisman and started to draw in the air again.

In the next three to four days, Xia ruofei spent most of his time studying the array pattern on the Jade talisman, except for the time when he got up to eat something.

Sometimes he was in high spirits as he carved the array patterns, and sometimes he frowned and shook his head. He continued to grab the heaven jade talisman and studied the text on it.

In this repeated process, Xia ruofei’s familiarity with the ‘heaven’ jade talisman increased rapidly and he carved more and more array patterns.

In the end, Xia ruofei put down the “heaven” jade talisman in his hand. He reached out and took a stream of spiritual water from the spiritual pond and poured it into his open mouth.

Xia ruofei drank some water from the spiritual pond to speed up the recovery of his spiritual power.

Then, he practiced the great Dao Arts for a while, filling up the true Qi in his dantian.

Xia ruofei felt that he had adjusted himself to a good state. He encouraged himself and sat down with his legs crossed.

He was also drawing the lines in the void, but Xia ruofei’s state was very different from before. His drawing speed was also faster than before.

Xia ruofei’s index finger continued to draw in the air and faint golden array runes appeared in front of him.

Soon, there were more and more of these array patterns. They all circled around Xia ruofei and were very beautiful.

This time, Xia ruofei didn’t stop halfway. Instead, he continued to inscribe the basic array runes. After these basic array runes were formed, they would circle around Xia ruofei.

When Xia ruofei drew the last stroke and completed the last array pattern, he heaved a sigh of relief.

However, he couldn’t slack off at this time. These array patterns all existed on their own and didn’t form a stable union with the other array patterns.

A confident smile hung on Xia ruofei’s face. With a slight thought, all the array patterns obediently moved to their positions as if they were being moved by an invisible hand.

These array patterns dazzled one’s eyes as they shuttled back and forth. They seemed chaotic, but they seemed to follow a certain rule.

In the end, Xia ruofei put his hands together and all the array patterns merged together, forming a seamless whole.

If one looked carefully, they would realize that the array pattern that was emitting a faint golden light was exactly the same as the one carved on the heaven jade talisman ...
