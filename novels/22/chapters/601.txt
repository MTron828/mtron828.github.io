Chapter 602: Inviting the tea King out (3)

“Okay, okay ...” Li Zhifu said,”I’m also a little curious ... My body is much better than before, and I haven’t felt pain for a long time ...”

Late – Stage cancer was usually accompanied by unbearable pain, so there was a saying that half of cancer patients were scared to death by themselves, and the other half died from pain.

When he was first diagnosed, li Zhifu often couldn’t sleep because of the pain. However, after taking the Chinese medicine that Xia ruofei had concocted, the degree of the pain began to gradually reduce, and the frequency increased. In the past ten days, he basically didn’t feel any pain.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”this means that the Traditional Chinese Medicine therapy is effective!” This is a good thing!”

Li Zhifu already knew about his illness, so he didn’t even dare to hope that he could recover one day. He had been teaching ye Lingyun everything he knew these days. His only wish was to teach ye Lingyun everything he had learned before he died, so he didn’t really care about his illness.

His daughter and son – in – Law, on the other hand, could clearly feel that his body had recovered a lot.

After hearing Xia ruofei’s words, li Zhifu was slightly stunned. His eyes lit up with hope as he asked,””Xia, my ... My illness ... Can it be cured?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”as long as we can treat it right, cancer is not undefeatable!” Old Mr. Li, at least for now, your treatment is on the right path. In addition to medication, you also need to build up confidence in yourself to see if you can defeat the disease. ”

Li Zhifu nodded and said,””I will. Thank you for your hard work, little Xia.”

“I wouldn’t dare to let my guard down on a mission personally assigned by elder song!” Xia ruofei laughed.”If the treatment is not successful, elder song will skin me alive.”

They talked as they walked towards the intersection. When they got into the car, ye Lingyun took the initiative to take Xia ruofei’s car keys and became the driver.

When they returned to Niu Yusheng’s house, Li Guizhi had already prepared a sumptuous lunch.

After lunch, Xia ruofei took out the thermal bag that he had prepared earlier from the car and handed the Chinese medicine to Li Guizhi. He asked her to heat it over water and let li Zhifu drink it.

......

Xia ruofei took his pulse after taking the medicine and said,””Old Mr. Li, your body is recovering very well! It’s almost the same as the treatment I expected. I’m getting more and more confident. I believe that it won’t be long before you’ll be completely healed!”

Niu Yusheng and Li Guizhi were overjoyed when they heard this.

After this period of interaction, ye Lingyun had a lot of respect and love for this master of his. After hearing Xia ruofei’s words, ye Lingyun also revealed an excited expression.

Li Zhifu’s eyes were also filled with excitement. It was better to live than to die. Even though he had lived for more than 90 years and was very open – minded about life and death, the feeling of being at the end of the road and having a glimmer of hope still made li Zhifu’s mood surge.

“Thank you, little Xia!” Li Zhifu said sincerely.

Xia ruofei nodded and smiled.””Mr. Li, I suggest that you come back to San Shan with me and go to the big hospital for a physical examination. Western Medicine’s various examination methods are more direct, and they can clearly see the condition of the cancer cells in the body and the recovery degree of the body. ”

Li Zhifu showed a hesitant expression. He was probably worried about his personal gains and losses. On the other hand, Niu Yusheng, Li Guizhi, and ye Lingyun immediately tried to persuade him. Li Zhifu considered for a while and nodded heavily.”Good! I’ll go back with you! Little song also called me a few times, inviting me back to stay for a few days ...”

“That’s just right!” Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”I’ll give manager Lu a call now and ask him to tell the Bureau chief the good news. At the same time, I’ll also arrange for the hospital to be ready in advance.”

After that, Xia ruofei immediately took out his phone and called manager Lu.

When director Lu heard that li Zhifu had recovered well and was going to stay in San Shan for a few days and go to the hospital for a follow – up, he was very happy. He immediately said that he would report to elder song and inform the relevant experts in the provincial People’s Hospital to get ready.

After the call, Xia ruofei said to li Zhifu,””Mr. Li, I’d like Ling Yun to bring me to Yan Xiaodong’s tomb this afternoon. Can we leave tomorrow?” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Alright, I’ll follow your arrangements.” Li Zhifu said with a smile.

After thinking through li Zhifu, everyone sat around the coffee table. Xia ruofei was here today. Li Zhifu was in a good mood after knowing that he had recovered well. He took out his precious Da Hong Pao and made tea for Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei looked at li Zhifu’s smooth movements and was ready to tell him the biggest purpose of his trip.

He pondered for a moment and asked,”old Mr. Li, I’ve heard so many stories about you from old song, but I’ve never seen you make tea with my own eyes!” It just so happens that I have six to seven catties of fresh Da Hong Pao’s leaves in my hands, all of which were just picked this morning. Can I trouble you to personally sell them once? Ling Yun can also learn from them ...”
