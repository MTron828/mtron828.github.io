Inspector Wu glared at manager Lu and said,”it’s not up to you to decide if there’s a problem, we have the final say!” I think there’s something wrong with your attitude! Brothers, check it again. This kitchen is so big, I’m afraid we can find eight to ten problems. ”

Inspector Wu’s gang of scoundrels laughed and responded, then began to split up to look for the problem.

“The rag is too dirty. The bacteria level is over the limit!”

“The sewage outlet doesn’t meet the standard!”

“The hygiene of the refrigerator is terrible!”

“The ingredients are going bad! That’s a big problem ...”

In a short while, this group of people had found six or seven problems out of nothing. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Manager Lu was shaking with anger. He pointed at director Wu and the others and said,””You ... You’ve gone too far!”

Inspector Wu walked up to manager Lu and stared at him coldly. He said,””We’re bullying you, so what? Who asked you to be so insensible?”

Tian Ming Yi laughed proudly and said,”Old Lu, didn’t your boss teach you? Not everyone can be offended!”

Manager Lu panted and pointed at inspector Wu and his men.””You’re abusing your power to get back at me. I ... I’m going to report this to your superiors!”

Director Wu took an exaggerated step back and said,””Aiya! I’m so scared ... Please don’t report me ... Oh right, my supervisor is principal Tian’s father. Our chief Tian is the most impartial and incorruptible person, please don’t report me! Otherwise, I’ll be out of luck ...”

The group of people immediately burst into laughter. Tian Ming Yi laughed so hard that he was almost in tears. He laughed as he pointed at inspector Wu and said,”Brother Wu, you’re so funny ... It’s such a waste not to be an actor!”

Inspector Wu laughed and said,”Lu fengwen, I see that you’re not fully awake yet.” Report? You can go now! Do you want me to tell you the number of our Bureau?”

Manager Lu gritted his teeth and felt a burst of sadness in his heart.

The King of Hell was easy to see, but the little devil was difficult to deal with. This was the most true portrayal!

At this moment, inspector Wu’s face suddenly darkened and he said,””In view of the many problems exposed during the inspection of Ling Ji’s private kitchen, the kitchen problem is particularly prominent. Food safety is not a trivial matter. Our joint inspection team has decided that Ling Ji’s private kitchen will be suspended for two months!”

After that, director Wu took the blank notice from a staff member of the health Inspection Bureau and filled it out. He then provocatively patted manager Lu on the chest and said,”If you have any objections to our decision, you can apply for a review through our higher – ups! Of course, you’re free to report whoever you want!”

When manager Lu heard that the suspension of business for half a month had been reduced to two months, he couldn’t help but be shocked. He picked up the suspension notice with a wooden expression, full of sorrow.

At this time, Tian Mingyi walked to manager Lu proudly and said,””Old Lu, you can’t just offend anyone. Next time, remember to be more open, if you can still run this broken restaurant!”

After he finished speaking, Tian Mingyi laughed and greeted,”Brothers, let’s go! No one is allowed to skip di Jue nightclub tonight!”

“Alright! Thank you, principal Tian!”

“Principal Tian is so forthright ...”

A group of people surrounded Tian Mingyi as they walked out. After turning around a row of food racks, Tian Mingyi and the others saw a group of people standing at the door. In the middle of them was a middle – aged man who was looking at them coldly. His gaze was like a sharp sword ...
