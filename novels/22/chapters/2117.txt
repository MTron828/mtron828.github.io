2118 The parents are not here (1)

After settling all these matters, Xia ruofei walked to the small balcony connected to the bedroom. He laid on the deck chair and prepared to enjoy the afternoon’s leisure.

However, his phone rang after a while.

Xia ruofei picked it up and saw that it was Ling Qingxue, so he immediately picked it up.

“My wife!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Xia ruofei, where are you?” Ling Qingxue asked with a smile.

“Oh, I’m at home on the farm!” Xia ruofei answered subconsciously.

“You seem to have forgotten that you have a home in the city, right?” Ling Qingxue asked. You haven’t lived in this house for a day, have you?”

Xia ruofei heard Ling Qingxue’s unfriendly tone and quickly explained with a smile,””I came back here today to find Xue Jinshan and Cao tieshu to arrange some work. I was just ... Preparing to return to the city!”

In fact, if Ling Qingxue had not called, Xia ruofei would have stayed at the farm for the night. This was how lazy people were. If they could lie down, they would not sit. They were already at the farm, why bother going back to the city? Wasn’t he sleeping anywhere?

However, he would never admit it.

“That’s more like it ...” Ling Qingxue said,”if there’s nothing else, then come back earlier!” You’re a Big Boss, and you’re cooped up in the farm all day long. What’s wrong with you?”

“Yes, sir!” Xia ruofei laughed and immediately said,” Why do I feel that something is wrong? You should be at the company right now, right? Why do you sound like you’re at home?”

Ling Qingxue burst out laughing and said,””It seems that men also have a sixth sense! I am at home! It’s in our house!”

Ling Qingxue had even emphasized the word “we.” It was obvious that she was in Xia ruofei’s Villa. Ling Qingxue also had a set of keys to the house.

“What’s the situation? Did the sun rise from the West today?” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”why is your old capitalist so kind today? why did he let you off so early?”

“How could you say that about my dad?” Ling Qingxue lowered her eyes and said.

“Hehe! A slip of the tongue! “I misspoke ...” Xia ruofei said.

“Virtue!” Ling Qingxue pouted and scolded him. Then, she said in a low voice,”my dad went to the Luo Cheng branch office for an inspection and won’t be back at San Shan tonight ... There’s nothing going on at the company today, so I’ll go home first!”

Speaking of this, Ling Qingxue acted like a spoiled child and said,””Why are you asking so many questions? It’s up to you whether you want to return or not! It’s just that the environment here is better, so what’s wrong with me being willing to live here?”

Hearing this, Xia ruofei’s heart was already burning. How could he sit still? It was as if there was a spring under his butt, and he jumped up from the recliner.

“I’m coming back now! Qingxue, wait for me!” Xia ruofei said.

“Okay, drive slowly on the road!” Ling Qingxue said,”I’m done talking to you. There’s still soup in the pot!”

Hearing this, Xia ruofei quickly said,”no, no, no!” What do you want to eat? wait for me to come back, I’ll make it!”

Ling Qingxue did not inherit any of Ling Xiaotian’s cooking talent. The dishes she made were too horrible to look at. Xia ruofei did not want to be the one to test the poison.

“It’s fine, it’s fine! Aren’t I free? I just wanted to make you something delicious. ” Ling Qingxue didn’t have the awareness of a newbie at cooking. She still smiled and said,”drive slowly on the road. It will be ready when you come back!”

Xia ruofei sighed in his heart and said in despair,””Alright! I know ...”

He could only pray that Ling Qingxue would not set the kitchen on fire. He had not even lived in this house for a day! He didn’t want the kitchen to have to be renovated ...

Xia ruofei rushed down the stairs as fast as he could.

When he was picking up the car, little black and the others ran over again, shaking their heads and wagging their tails.

Xia ruofei suddenly had the idea of bringing the two dogs to the villa in the city.

However, he thought about it again. Little black and the others were on the farm. Even if he wasn’t home, ye Lingyun and the others would still help to take care of them. If he left them in the city, he could only ask Ling Qingxue for help. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Of course, this wasn’t too troublesome. The main thing was that they didn’t have a dog raising license or any registration. It was fine to raise them in the farms in the suburbs, but it couldn’t be done in the high – end villa area. Black and the other dogs were all fat and strong, at least medium to large dogs. Even if the owners didn’t say anything, the property management would definitely interfere.

Hence, Xia ruofei could only put this thought aside for the time being. He was going to find someone he knew to get the dog raising license first, then consider this matter.

In any case, little black and the others were all very intelligent. They would definitely not harm other owners in the urban villas, and they could also play the role of guarding the house.

Xia ruofei drove the Knight XV back to the jiangbin villa district at lightning speed.

He didn’t park the car in the garage, but drove it directly into the parking space in the courtyard. Then, he jumped out of the car and jogged into the villa.

Xia ruofei sniffed as he entered the house.

Fortunately, there was no burning smell ...

Just as he thought of this, Xia ruofei saw Ling Qingxue in her home clothes. She was standing in the living room and smiling at him.

“Didn’t you say you were going to cook?”Xia ruofei asked, stunned.

“If I didn’t say that, would you have returned so quickly?” Ling Qingxue smiled.
