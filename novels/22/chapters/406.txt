Chapter 407: A glorious mission (2)

“Oh ... I know.” Ye linyun was obviously not in a good mood.

Xia ruofei frowned and said,”why do you look so weak?” Can you complete the task I’ve given you?”

This was the most common sentence used by the chief when he was in the Army. Ye Lingyun stood at attention almost reflexively and said loudly,””Yes, I can!”

“Very good!” Xia ruofei patted ye Lingyun’s shoulder in satisfaction and said,”pack your things tonight and hand over the work tomorrow morning. When you’re not at the farm, Lei Hu will be in charge of the security. Tell him everything you need to tell him, and then go back with old Mr. Li. Do you understand?”

“Understood!” Ye linyun said without hesitation.

Xia ruofei then greeted li Zhifu and went straight upstairs to his room.

That night, Xia ruofei boiled the Chinese medicine in the spirit map space and sealed them in nine vacuum – sealed bags. Then, he went downstairs and placed them in the kitchen refrigerator.

This time, Xia ruofei appropriately increased the amount of the spirit Heart Flower petal solution. He estimated that according to this ratio, li Zhifu’s cancer cells would be completely cleared in about ten days to half a month.

That night, elder song even called Xia ruofei personally. He called Xia ruofei immediately after li Zhifu’s call. It was clear that elder song cared about li Zhifu.

Over the phone, Xia ruofei reported li Zhifu’s condition in detail to elder song and said that he would continue to follow up. He would send someone to Wu Yi mountain to deliver medicine every three days. Ye Lingyun would also be by li Zhifu’s side to take care of him. Once there were any changes in his condition, he would immediately let li Zhifu return to the three mountains.

After hearing Xia ruofei’s words, elder song was slightly relieved. Especially when Xia ruofei said that li Zhifu’s condition was recovering steadily, elder song was even more relieved and thanked Xia ruofei for his hard work.

The next morning, li Zhifu left Peach Blossom Farm with ye Lingyun, who had finished handing over his work.

Xia ruofei asked Hong Tao to drive his Knight XV carriage and send the two to Mount Wuyi.

The reason why they used this eye – catching monster – Class SUV was mainly because it was much more comfortable than a pickup truck. After all, li Zhifu was an old man. He had to consider comfort during a long journey. In addition, the Knight XV also had a car – mounted refrigerator, which could store the Chinese medicine that Xia ruofei had brewed in advance.

People from the military had no resistance to cool off – road vehicles like the Knight XV. Hong Tao and a few others had been drooling over this car for a long time. So when Xia ruofei asked Hong Tao to drive li Zhifu and ye Lingyun, Hong Tao was so happy that he jumped up. Lei Hu and the other two were also quite envious.

Xia ruofei was also looking forward to ye Lingyun’s trip. He knew that when ye Lingyun returned to the three mountains, his farm would have a new tea – making expert. By then, the mother tree Da Hong Pao that he had planted in the farm could be harvested. When the time came, ye Lingyun could make the best Da Hong Pao. Whether it was for himself or for someone else, it would be great.

After sending li Zhifu and ye Lingyun off, Xia ruofei’s life returned to its usual tranquility. With two less people, the villa was even more peaceful.

Ten days passed quickly, and the weather in the three mountains gradually warmed up.

In the past few days, the cherry saplings that Xia ruofei purchased online in Shandong were transported to Taoyuan farm through the logistics company. He organized Cao tieshu and the others to plant all the cherry trees in the orchard at the back of the mountain. Of course, he did not forget to secretly take two or three and plant them in his spirit map space. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Cao tieshu was also rather puzzled by Xia ruofei’s introduction of these saplings, which were only suitable for planting in the North. However, he now had a kind of blind confidence in Xia ruofei, so he did not have any doubts. In any case, whatever the boss asked him to do, he would follow it to the letter.

When no one was around, Xia ruofei went to the water tower and added a lot of the spirit Heart Flower petal solution. The orchard was equipped with an automatic watering system. After watering the cherry tree once, the sapling, which had lost a lot of water due to the long – distance transportation, suddenly became energetic and swayed gently in the breeze.

This also made Cao tieshu and the others click their tongues in wonder. The other half of the lychee tree had not only survived, but its growth rate had also exceeded that of ordinary species. Cao tieshu and the others all said that looking at this situation, it would definitely be able to bear fruit on a large scale in the summer of the year after.

Hearing this, Xia ruofei laughed to himself. He knew that within three years, these fruit trees would be able to enjoy the nourishment of the spirit Heart Flower petal solution every three to five years. Even if there would not be a large number of fruits this summer, they would definitely be able to bear fruits by next summer.

However, he naturally wouldn’t reveal it. In any case, Cao tieshu and the others would naturally know when the time came.

Now, most of the eight vegetable greenhouses of 100 meters long and 10 meters wide in the entire Taoyuan farm had been planted with Taoyuan vegetables. These vegetables were also planted in batches according to the variety and growth cycle, which could ensure that there was a sufficient supply to several partner companies every day.

If the greenhouse was running at full capacity, the supply could increase by a large amount. However, these few partners could probably take all of it. If Xia ruofei wanted to expand his influence further, he had to continue to expand the scale and build more vegetable greenhouses.
