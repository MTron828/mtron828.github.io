Chapter 582: The king of fish (2)

However, Xia ruofei felt that he did not need it at all. As long as the Stingray could not survive out of the sea, and as long as they could survive and reproduce in freshwater, the superior environment in the spirit map space would definitely allow them to live very well.

Xia ruofei gently picked up the heated water tank. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

His strength was much greater than the average person ‘s, so he could easily lift the water tank, which weighed 40 to 50 catties, and it was quite stable, almost without any shaking.

The pair of stingrays in the water tank didn’t even notice anything abnormal, still swimming slowly and steadily in the water tank.

Ling Xiaotian also heaved a sigh of relief.

Xia ruofei walked to the back of the Knight XV’s car and opened the trunk. He placed the heated water tank in the trunk and took out three bottles of ‘drugged’ Drunken Eight Immortals wine before closing the trunk.

Xia ruofei brought the wine to Ling Xiaotian and said apologetically,””Uncle Ling, these bottles of wine were originally meant for everyone to take out for the catfish banquet tomorrow. Now that I’ve taken away the main course, I can only leave these bottles of wine for you to drink ...”

Ling Xiaotian had been looking at the water tank in Xia ruofei’s hands longingly. He only looked away after Xia ruofei had closed the car door.

However, the moment the door closed, he adjusted his mentality and laughed.””It’s fine, it’s fine! It’s good to have wine! Besides, I believe that you’ll be able to eat the Chinese perch very soon. You’re the best at creating miracles, haha ...”

Ling Xiaotian said as he took Xia ruofei’s glass of wine.

He thought for a while and asked,”Oh right, ruofei. I remember you said on the phone that you had something to tell me. Can you tell me now?”

Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but look at Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei did not hesitate and said with a smile,””Uncle Ling, I actually need your help. I heard from Qingxue that you really like ornamental fish, especially red Arowana. You also have a lot of connections in the circle and many fish friends with strong financial capabilities ...”

......

“Qingxue finally spoke from an objective standpoint!” Ling Xiaotian laughed smugly.

Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but roll her eyes.

“Uncle Ling, I have a few blood – Red Dragons that are of pretty good quality.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’m going to sell them, but this kind of high – Quality blood – Red Dragon is very expensive. Ordinary people can’t afford it. So, I would like to ask you to contact your fishing friends and ask if anyone is interested in buying.”

Ling Xiaotian’s eyes widened in shock as he said,””Blood Red Dragon?”

Xia ruofei nodded with certainty.”Yes, I have the channels to get high – Quality blood red Dragons. There are a total of six this time, and it’s only the first batch.”

“Since there’s such a good fish, why don’t you keep it for yourself?” Ling Xiaotian could not help but say,”ruofei, good Red Arowana are hard to come by!”

Ling Qingxue pouted and said,”dad!” Didn’t you hear what RUO Fei said? He had a fixed channel, and this was only the first batch. Do you think everyone’s like you, unable to take their eyes off a good quality Red Dragon?”

Ling Xiaotian laughed awkwardly and asked,””RUO Fei, what is the approximate grade of your six Red Dragons? It’s not that I don’t believe you! You know that my fish friends all have very high standards. ”

Xia ruofei smiled.”I don’t know much about this, but I’m sure that they’re not any worse than the pair I gave you last time. They should be slightly longer too. I believe that they must be the best blood red Dragons!”

“If that’s the case, then I’m relieved!” Lin Xiaotian replied. I’ll contact my friends tomorrow. Ruofei, when will your Red Arowana be ready?”

“Within three days!” Xia ruofei said with certainty.

“Alright, let’s set it three days later!” Ling Xiaotian said.

“Thank you, uncle Ling!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”three days later, I’ll send the red Arowana over. You can ask everyone to come to your house!”

“No problem!”

After making a deal with Ling Xiaotian, Xia ruofei bade farewell to everyone and left.

Ling Qingxue was a little reluctant, but since her father and her bodyguard were by her side today, she could not show it. She could only look at Xia ruofei with her big, watery eyes.

Xia ruofei smiled at her. When Ling Xiaotian and Lin Shengnan were not paying attention, he blinked his eyes quickly.

Ling Qingxue’s pretty face blushed slightly. This was a secret signal between the two of them that they had a tacit understanding. Xia ruofei was saying that he would meet her tomorrow.

The two young men and women who were in love, apart from eating and shopping, would naturally do some sports that everyone loved to see.

Ling Xiaotian did not notice his daughter’s blushing face. He continued to remind her,””RUO Fei, drive slowly on the road. Don’t make any vibrations. They’re easily frightened.”

“Don’t worry! I will be very careful!” After Xia ruofei finished speaking, he waved at Ling Xiaotian and the other two. Then, he stepped on the accelerator and started the car, leaving Ling Xiaotian’s Villa.

In fact, the moment the car started, Xia ruofei had already used his spiritual power to lock onto the heated water tank at the back of the car. With a thought, he easily stored it into the spirit map space.

As Xia ruofei’s spiritual power grew, his control of space became more adept.
