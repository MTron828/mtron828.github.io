Translator: 549690339

As for Xia ruofei, he immediately called Ling Qingxue after he hung up.

As expected, Ling Qingxue had not rested yet. When she heard Xia ruofei talk about Zhao Yongjun’s suggestion, she was very interested. The sleepiness that she had felt after drinking the Semillon red wine had disappeared without a trace. She was very excited to discuss it with Xia ruofei on the phone.

Since Xia ruofei had called Ling Qingxue, he was naturally inclined to agree to this operation method, so he told her his suggestion without reservation. At the same time, he also told Ling Qingxue that if the club could be run in the future, he would also have a certain share in it.

This was like giving Ling Qingxue a calming pill. She even wanted to tell Ling Xiaotian about this matter that very night. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Xia ruofei quickly stopped her. Ling Xiaotian was not like young people. At this time, he was most likely already asleep. There was no need to wake him up because of this.

After much persuasion, Ling Qingxue finally gave up on the idea. However, she was still very excited even when she hung up the phone.

Xia ruofei laughed bitterly, thinking that Ling Qingxue might not be able to sleep tonight.

What he didn’t know was that Ling Qingxue wasn’t the only one suffering from insomnia. Song Wei was also suffering from insomnia ...

Xia ruofei browsed the news online for a while, then went to the official website of paradise Corporation and the flagship stores that the company had opened in several major e – commerce platforms. Seeing that it was almost time, he went to the balcony on time, sat down, and began to cultivate.

As long as time allowed, Xia ruofei would not miss two periods of cultivation a day.

After all, the spirit Qi on earth was barren and he could not completely rely on the limited spirit Qi in the spirit map space to cultivate. Therefore, these two periods of time were extremely precious.

Although compared to cultivating in the space, the progress of cultivating in the outside world was negligible, there were still benefits to it.

Besides, cultivation was like rowing a boat against the current. If he didn’t improve, he would fall behind. To Xia ruofei, cultivating every day was also a form of maintaining his state.

It was only when he felt that the spiritual Qi that he had gathered from the void had suddenly become mottled that Xia ruofei stopped and got up. He went to the bathroom to wash up and then went to bed.

The next morning, Xia ruofei woke up on time without the need for the alarm on his phone.

As usual, he cultivated. After he was done, Xia ruofei washed up, changed into a set of sportswear, and ran a few rounds on the farm.

This kind of training had almost no effect on Xia ruofei’s body. He was maintaining a habit that he had formed after being in the Army for many years. It had become a biological clock.

After returning to the villa, Xia ruofei took another shower, changed his clothes, and went to the complex.

Zhao Yongjun and the others did not sleep in either. When Xia ruofei arrived, they were already taking a walk in the open space in front of the building.

Seeing Xia ruofei walk over, Zhao Yongjun smiled and said,””Ruofei, I saw you jogging downstairs from the room upstairs. Are you still maintaining the Army’s habits?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”yeah!” If I don’t run every day, I’ll feel so uncomfortable!”

“That’s a good habit!” Zhao Yongjun sighed.”Back then, I also did well in the five – kilometer run with weights. It’s just that I didn’t train as much after leaving the Army. Look at me now ... My beer belly is about to pop out ...”

“Brother Zhao, you’ve kept your figure well ...” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Zhao Yongjun still maintained a relatively healthy body shape. He was tall and burly, and he walked with the vigor of a Tiger. He had a strong military aura.

“Not bad compared to this bunch of kids!” Zhao Yongjun glanced at song Rui and the others and said,”but they’re far from you!”

“Oh right,” Zhao Yongjun added,”after you went back last night, I told my brothers about what we discussed in the car last night. Everyone was quite interested.”

“Yeah!” Song Rui said. Just thinking about us brothers investing in a club together makes me excited! Especially if we can bring in Ling Ji’s private kitchen ...”

As song Rui spoke, he couldn’t help but reveal a look of fascination.

“I think you’re excited because you can eat delicious food at any time!” Xia ruofei mercilessly exposed song Rui’s thoughts.”As for the chicken soup of brothers working together to break gold, you don’t have to give it to us ...”

Hou Liang, Xu Zixuan, and the others couldn’t help but chuckle.

Among this group of people, song Rui was the eldest son and grandson of the song family. His status was undoubtedly the most prominent. Other than Zhao Yongjun, who was the closest to him, people like Hou Liang, who had a good relationship with him, still spoke to him with a trace of respect.

Xia ruofei, on the other hand, did not have so many concerns.

Song Rui was also very thick – skinned. He said,”of course, the food is a very important reason, but I also want to make a career. If this club can do well, the elders in my family will say that we are ignorant and incompetent, fooling around all day long. They will more or less hesitate, right?”

Song Rui’s words were what everyone was thinking, including Zhao Yongjun. They were the second and third generations of the family with a golden spoon in their mouths. On the one hand, they enjoyed the glory brought by their fathers. On the other hand, they lived in the shadow of their fathers. No matter what, they were always labeled as “some son” and “some grandson”.

Of course, they also wanted to make a career to prove themselves.

Song Rui continued,”it’s a very happy thing to do business with my brothers!” Don’t you think so, everyone?”

“Right!”

“Brother Rui said what I wanted to say!”

Hou Liang and the others also jeered.

“Of course,” song Rui said,”on this basis, if there is a gathering point for everyone, and there are all kinds of delicious food, especially top food like the Buddha Jumps Over the Wall and the Yangtze River Chinese perch, wouldn’t that be even better?”

Xia ruofei glanced at song Rui and said,””So, you’re going to stay in Beijing for a long time? Don’t you still have a position in the company here at San Shan?”

“I’m sorry, but I’ve returned to the headquarters to work now,”song Rui said proudly.

“Do you believe that I won’t tell uncle song the real reason why you’re staying in the capital? you’ll be immediately sent to San Shan or even directly sent back to Xiang Nan Province.” Xia ruofei said slowly.

“You won’t do that, will you?” song Rui said nervously.

“That’s hard to say ...” Xia ruofei chuckled.”It depends on your performance!” If you put in a little more effort for the club ...”

“That’s for sure!” Song Rui quickly said,”this will be our own business in the future!”

Xia ruofei stopped teasing song Rui and said seriously,””Right now, we only have this intention. As for the specific operation, we still have to discuss the procedures! Let’s go have breakfast first! Let’s talk while we eat ...”

So, the group walked into the staff cafeteria on the first floor of the complex, where breakfast was already prepared.

Although it wasn’t as exquisite as a star hotel, the breakfast in the staff cafeteria was very sumptuous. There were steamed buns, porridge, soy milk, deep – fried dough sticks, and so on. There was a wide variety of food, and everyone could choose according to their own taste.

Xia ruofei and the others got their breakfast and sat down to eat while they talked about the club.

Even Zhao Yongjun was very excited, looking forward to the club’s blueprint.

Everyone was also talking at once. Some said that they wanted a high – end fitness center, some said that they wanted a mini golf course, and some said that a Health Center was a must. Even song Rui, the funny guy, said that he wanted to build a Sports Car Club and a standard racing track ...

Xia ruofei was calmer. He smiled and knocked on the plate.”Brothers, let’s not think so far ahead. The first thing we need to confirm is the investment amount, right? Where was this club built? What was the land price? What was the construction cost? How much labor costs and start – up capital do you need? Let’s confirm these basic things first, and then we’ll discuss the proportion of each investment, right?”
