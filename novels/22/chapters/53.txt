Chapter 54  Buying Jade (1)

    The Tupperware appeared in Xia ruofei's hands out of thin air!

  Xia ruofei looked at the Tupperware in his hand, his face full of joy. He didn't expect that after the space had evolved, he could actually take things out directly from the space. This was much more convenient!

  Then, could he directly send things into the space?

  Xia ruofei immediately tried again. He still used his mind to contact the spirit map space and gave an order. The next moment, the Tupperware in her hand disappeared like the most brilliant magic.

  The moment the container disappeared, Xia ruofei immediately sensed it reappearing in the medium.

  Xia ruofei was like a child who had just received a new toy and kept trying.

  After many experiments, Xia ruofei concluded: He could now store and withdraw items directly from the spirit map space in the outside world, but this process was also very taxing on his mental strength, much more so than directly bringing things in.

  There were also restrictions on the size and weight of the items.

  At the moment, he could at most send 200 kilograms of things into the space or take them out.

  Any bigger, and one would feel a sense of exhaustion as if their mental power had been exhausted. They would need to consume the spatial pool's water or even the petal solution to recover.

  Although there were these restrictions, this was already a great surprise for Xia ruofei.

  Xia ruofei had a feeling that as long as he continued to absorb the petals of the strange flower, or if the space was upgraded, he would be able to store and withdraw bigger and heavier things!

  Thinking of the realm's upgrade and evolution, Xia ruofei's excitement gradually calmed down. He began to analyze the process that he had stumbled upon.

  Without a doubt, the spirit painting scroll had evolved after absorbing the Jade paperweight.

  However, was the Jade material of the paperweight necessary for the spirit map, or did the paperweight itself have some special function? After all, this paperweight looked like an old item. Perhaps there was some magical legend about it? Xia ruofei frowned as he pondered.

  He was inclined to the former.

  He thought that the painting might need the Jade itself. Wasn't it said that Jade gathered the spiritual Qi of heaven and earth to increase one's longevity? The spiritual energy contained in the Jade itself might be what the spirit painting scroll needed, right?

  No matter how one analyzed or guessed, in the end, they had to rely on the facts to speak.

  Hence, Xia ruofei decided to test it out for himself.

  He hid the spirit painting well on his body, then took his bank card and more than ten thousand Yuan in cash that he had earned from selling Taoyuan brand vegetables in the past two days. He went downstairs to get his car and went straight to San Shan city.

  ……

  Wen Wan Street in ning 'an District of Sanshan city was the distribution center of Jade, antiques, and jewelry in the entire Southeast province. There were more than a hundred shops of all sizes here, all of which were in the Wen Wan - related industry. It had already formed a large industrial scale.

  Such a place was always full of good and bad people, and the shops of all sizes were full of counterfeits. Even if an expert came here, he could easily be fooled if he was not careful.

  Xia ruofei's destination was Wen Wan Street. Of course, he wasn't here to pick up treasures.

  After parking the car, Xia ruofei strolled into the busy pedestrian street.

  In addition to the shops, there were many stalls along the street. These stalls operated on a variety of businesses, such as Grandpa Mao portraits, little man books, ancient coins ... There was a dazzling array of things.

  As soon as Xia ruofei walked over, a few stall owners greeted him warmly. They were all glib with their words as if anything in their shabby stalls was a priceless treasure.

  Xia ruofei did not stop in front of these small stalls. Instead, he walked straight in. After a short while, he saw a shop with a signboard "spirit Jade house". It looked very big and was decorated in a high - end manner.

  He thought for a moment and walked into the shop.

  A young and beautiful waitress came up to him and greeted him with a smile,""Sir, do you want to buy jade? Our spirit Jade house is having a promotion recently. If you spend more than 20000 Yuan, you will get a free old pit raw stone! If you want to experience the fun of stone gambling, don't miss this great opportunity!"

  Xia ruofei just wanted to verify his guess. He didn't know anything about the old gemstones, nor did he know what stone gambling was, so he was naturally uninterested. He just said indifferently,""Oh ... Let me take a look first!"

  "Then what type and price do you want, Sir? We have all kinds of Jade here, and the variety is very complete. " The waiter asked with a warm smile.

  "Uh ... I'm just looking around." Xia ruofei asked,"by the way, do you have Jade for sale here?"

  With a professional smile, the waiter said,""I'm sorry, Sir, but we only sell finished jade products. We don't have any Jade materials for sale. "

  "Oh ... Do you have any jade products?" Xia ruofei asked. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

  He just wanted to verify if anything that was made of Jade could be absorbed by the spirit map space and upgraded. Finished jade items could also be used, so he was too lazy to change to another store.

  The waiter smiled."Of course we do. We have jade earrings, jade bracelets, and jade pendants. However, the price varies greatly depending on the quality. I wonder what price you would like to know, Sir?"

  "Then ... I want to see the Jade bracelet." Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,"recommend me a few of them at all prices! I'll take a look first. "

  "Alright, this way please!" The waiter said.

  People in the service industry were good at reading people's expressions. Seeing that Xia ruofei was dressed so simply and didn't seem to have a strong desire to buy, the waitress didn't take out anything expensive.

  The waiter rummaged behind the counter for a while and quickly took out a few boxes and placed them on the counter. He said,""Sir, these bracelets are all made of Jade. The price ranges from 5000 to 100000 Yuan. You can have a look first."

  Xia ruofei was also shocked. He didn't expect Jade to be so expensive. These bracelets didn't look like much, but the cheapest one cost 5000 Yuan and the most expensive one was 100000 Yuan.

  Xia ruofei thought,"there must be a reason why it's so expensive. Since I want to verify my judgment, I'll try the most expensive one first!"

  "Which one is the one that costs 100000 Yuan?" he asked.

  The waiter was stunned for a moment, thinking,"I didn't know how rich this young man is!" He actually wanted to watch the one that cost 100000 Yuan? Could it be that he was a low - Profile rich man? If he had known earlier, he would have taken out those high - grade goods that were worth hundreds of thousands or even millions.

  Of course, she was only stunned for a moment. She quickly reacted and the smile on her face became more enthusiastic. She pointed to one of the boxes and said,"

  "This is a jade bracelet of the ice glutinous type. It's priced at 100000 Yuan."

  "Oh, can I pick it up and have a look?" Xia ruofei asked.

  "Of course, but ... We have rules. If the bracelet is damaged because of Sir, you have to pay the original price ..." The saleswoman reminded Xia ruofei carefully.

  Xia ruofei nodded and reached out to grab the Jade bangle.

  Just as Xia ruofei's hand touched the Jade bangle, he felt the spirit painting scroll in his arms shake slightly again ...
