Chapter 24: Unstoppable

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Xia Ruofei pushed open the door and walked out of the house with a dark expression.

A dozen roguish young men stood in the ruined courtyard, each of them armed with steel pipes, machetes, and other weapons. They had kicked down the dilapidated courtyard door and it lay in pieces on the ground.

The leader was Zhong Qiang, who had harrassed Lin Qiao at the village entrance.

Zhong Qiang’s face was swollen, and one of his eyes was bruised, making him look even more ferocious.

Seeing Xia Ruofei come out, Zhong Qiang’s eyes revealed ruthlessness as he sneered.

“Kid, you have guts! You actually dared to stay in Little Island Village after hitting me. If I don’t teach you a lesson today, I’ll really be letting you down!”

Previously, at the village entrance, Zhong Qiang and the other two were knocked down by Xia Ruofei without any resistance. Therefore, he knew that Xia Ruofei was quite skilled. This time, he came to take revenge and called for more than ten hooligans. Moreover, everyone was armed.

In Zhong Qiang’s opinion, no matter how powerful Xia Ruofei was, he would not be able to defeat so many of them.

Xia Ruofei looked at these hooligans who were rubbing their fists before staring into Zhong Qiang’s eyes and asking calmly.

“Why did you bring so many men here?”

Zhong Qiang was slightly stunned, then laughed and said.

“What do you want? Big Guns, tell him what we want.”

Beside Zhong Qiang, a young man in ripped jeans and dyed blond hair immediately teased.

“Kid, of course we’re here to mess with you! Don’t tell me we want to have tea and chat with you?”

The ruffians also roared with laughter and said.

“Haha! Is there something wrong with his f*cking brain?”

“I think he’s been scared silly by Brother Qiang…”

With a smug smile on his face, Big Guns said.

“Kid, kneel down and apologize to Brother Qiang now. We can be gentler when we hit you. Otherwise… Hehe!”

Xia Ruofei looked coldly at this group of arrogant and domineering hooligans. He pursed his lips slightly and looked at Zhong Qiang.

‘So there’s nothing to talk about between us?’

Xia Ruofei’s calmness and disregard angered Zhong Qiang. He snorted and said.

“Talk my ass! You’re the first person who dared to hit me in Little Island Village. If I don’t cripple you today, I’ll take your surname! Also, this Lin family can’t escape responsibility. I’ll tear down this lousy house in a while!”

A sharp light flashed in Xia Ruofei’s eyes.

“The Lin family is the family of a valiant soldier. How dare you touch their house?”

Zhong Qiang laughed arrogantly and said.

“Soldier’s family? So what! I used to dislike Lin Hu. If he hadn’t died in the army, I would have beaten him up too!”

The fire in Xia Ruofei’s heart began to burn fiercely, and his eyes became extremely sharp. His entire body suddenly emitted a cold aura—this was the killing intent of a soldier who had truly seen blood on the battlefield.

No matter how arrogant and despotic Zhong Qiang was previously, no matter how much he mocked and ridiculed him, Xia Ruofei did not really get angry. After all, in his eyes, such a hooligan was completely unpresentable.

However, Zhong Qiang’s disdain when he spoke of the soldier’s families, especially the insult to Hu Zi, was something Xia Ruofei could not tolerate no matter what. The bloodlust buried deep in his heart was starting to stir.

Zhong Qiang, who was closest to Xia Ruofei, inexplicably felt a chill run down his spine and involuntarily took a step back.

Even he could not understand why he felt a chill in his heart, as if the young man in front of him had suddenly become a god of death.

Xia Ruofei slowly clenched his fists, and his eyes turned bloodshot.

Actually, this state was very dangerous.

Xia Ruofei and Hu Zi were both from the most elite special forces. They had received the most rigorous special forces training and had experienced many real battles. It could be said that they were the sharpest human-shaped killing weapons. Even bare-handed, they were extremely dangerous.

There were many vulnerable and fatal parts of the human body. Xia Ruofei undoubtedly knew these parts like the back of his hand.

Once he lost control of his emotions, it was no exaggeration to say that the lives of these dozen or so hooligans were definitely in danger.

At this moment, Xia Ruofei was on the verge of losing control of his emotions.

At that moment, a crisp voice sounded.

“Brother Ruofei!”

It turned out that Lin Qiao was worried and walked out to take a look.

When Xia Ruofei heard Lin Qiao’s voice, the boiling killing intent in his heart immediately subsided.

Zhong Qiang and the others also felt relieved.

“Qiao’er, why did you come out?” Xia Ruofei frowned slightly and said, “You have nothing to do here. Go in first.”

“I don’t want to!” When Lin Qiao saw that Zhong Qiang had brought so many people over, how could she still be willing to go in? She grabbed Xia Ruofei’s arm and said to Zhong Qiang, “Zhong Qiang, today’s matter has nothing to do with Brother Ruofei. If you have anything, come at me!”

Zhong Qiang had just taken a step back from Xia Ruofei, so he naturally felt embarrassed in front of his lackeys. Now that he saw Lin Qiao and Xia Ruofei being so intimate, he was even more jealous and hateful. He gritted his teeth and said.

“Brothers! Attack together and teach this kid a lesson!”

The thugs murmured in agreement. They raised their steel pipes and machetes and looked at Xia Ruofei maliciously as they surrounded him.

Lin Qiao was so frightened that her face turned pale. Xia Ruofei shielded her behind him and said calmly.

“Qiao’er, close your eyes…” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Huh?” Lin Qiao was stunned.

“Be good,” Xia Ruofei said calmly.

Then, Lin Qiao felt her soft body being grabbed by Xia Ruofei and could not help but blush.

Xia Ruofei calmly raised Lin Qiao’s hand to cover her eyes and said.

“Stand here and don’t move.”

Before Lin Qiao could react, she felt a gust of wind pass by. Then, she heard a scream like a pig being slaughtered.

She could not help but secretly open her fingers and look out. She saw Xia Ruofei alone like a tiger in a pack of wolves. More than a dozen hooligans with knives, steel pipes, and car chains surrounded him, but they could not even touch the corner of his clothes.

On the other hand, every time Xia Ruofei attacked, one or even several hooligans would be defeated.

As long as the hooligans were hit by Xia Ruofei, those who could stand up after falling to the ground would once again grimace and scream on the ground.

In the blink of an eye, more than a dozen hooligans were lying on the ground. Everyone was groaning in pain and could not get up at all.

Only Zhong Qiang was left standing.

Extreme fear was found in his eyes. He was trembling, and he was holding up a machete. He was frozen like a clay statue and looked ridiculous.

Xia Ruofei’s hair was not even messed up. He easily dusted off the nonexistent dust on his hands, then walked towards Zhong Qiang with a faint sneer on his face.
