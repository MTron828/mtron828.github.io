Chapter 247: A bunch of weaklings (1)

Ling Ji F & B headquarters. Xia ruofei was still in a confrontation with five officers from the tax bureau. Ling Xiaotian and Ling Qingxue were standing beside Xia ruofei. Ling Xiaotian looked worried. Ling Qingxue, on the other hand, was relatively calm. She knew Xia ruofei very well and knew that he was not the kind of person who would act on impulse. Time passed by. The atmosphere in the Finance Office was very heavy, and the ordinary employees did not even dare to breathe loudly. Suddenly, there was the sound of footsteps coming from the elevator. Soon, a group of people barged into the company and went straight to the Finance Office. Industry, commerce, health, Environmental Protection ... There were people from all sorts of departments. These were the people who had swept through every restaurant Under Ling Ji restaurant. What made Ling Xiaotian frown was that other than this group of people, there were more than a dozen people in security uniforms. These people didn’t look like good people. They were all rogues. Some of them had hideous scars on their faces. Almost everyone had tattoos. They glared at Xia ruofei with hostility. When little Shen saw who it was, his face lit up and he called out,””Brother Chen, brother Liu, you’re all here!” One of the middle – aged men in a business uniform nodded at Shen and said,””Little Shen, I heard that there’s a lot of resistance in your law enforcement, so we’re here to help.” “Thank you, brother Chen!” Xiao Shen said happily. Ling Xiaotian furrowed his brows and asked,”Who are you?” Why did you break into our company?” Brother Chen, a middle – aged man from the Industry and Commerce Bureau, said,””You’re the person in charge of Ling Ji F & B? We are all cadres of the various functional departments in the city, and now we have officially formed a joint inspection team. I hope you will stop being stubborn and cooperate with us!” Ling Qingxue pointed at the security guards and said angrily,””You guys are brutal law enforcement! Are these also executives?” One of them, a big man with a scary knife scar on his face, said with a smile,””The beauty really cares a lot! I’m such a capable man, of course I’m a cadre ...” “Hahaha ...” The security guards all burst out laughing, and they all looked at Ling Qingxue with perverted eyes. Ling Qingxue’s face was red with anger. At this time, Xia ruofei gently pulled Ling Qingxue’s hand and protected her behind him. Then, he glanced at the security guards with a calm look. Xia ruofei didn’t look strong and his expression was calm. However, when Xia ruofei’s eyes swept over these people, they clearly felt a bone – chilling coldness. The unbridled laughter stopped abruptly. The leader, Dao BA, quickly steadied his mind and coldly said,”I heard that someone stopped the tax bureau from enforcing the law. It was you, right? If you know what’s good for you, quickly step aside to avoid suffering physical pain!” Brother Chen from the Industry and Commerce Bureau also said,””These few comrades are employees of a regular security company. Because of your company’s violent resistance to the law, we invited them over to protect you!” Another official from the health Bureau, surnamed Liu, also said with a fake smile,”By the way, pay for the security guards later. If it wasn’t for your lack of cooperation, we wouldn’t have needed to hire security guards at the last minute. You’ll have to pay for it, right?” When the employees of the Ling Ji F & B group heard this person’s words, they all looked angry. They really went too far! He hired a bunch of thugs to the company, and in the end, he even wanted the company to pay the so – called fees ... Ling Xiaotian’s eyes also flashed with anger. These people were too arrogant! The Finance Office fell into silence, but anger was slowly brewing in this silence ... Whoosh ... Suddenly, a sneer broke the silence. Xia ruofei had a mocking smile on his face as he looked at the strange group of leaders, ordinary cadres, and hooligans. He said,”and you want us to pay for these punks?” I have to say ... This idea of yours is really creative, and your bottom line is really beyond my imagination! I’m impressed, I’ve finally seen what it means to be invincible in the world ...” The health Bureau officer surnamed Liu looked at Xia ruofei and said,””If you have time to mock me, why don’t you think about yourself?” “Shen, when you get back, give the police a copy of today’s video. This kind of brutal behavior against law enforcement must not be tolerated!” He said to Xiao Shen. “Alright!” Xiao Shen grinned. When it was just the five of them at first, little Shen was a little nervous. But now there were more than twenty people, including the dozen gangsters brought by Dao BA, and little Shen suddenly felt confident. “Old Liu, why are you wasting your breath on this grandson!” Scarface said loudly. After saying that, he pointed to the account books on the table and the sealed computer host and asked,””Are these the things you’re moving?” Xiao Shen nodded. Scarface waved his hand and said,”brothers, go!” Move the things!” Ling Qingxue’s expression changed and she rebuked,””Who dares to come up?” “Beauty, we all dare to do it!” Scarface said with a cheeky smile. Who wouldn’t want to go for a beauty? brothers, don’t you think so?” The hooligans were already drooling over Ling Qingxue’s beauty, so they all laughed out loud when they heard this. Their gazes towards Ling Qingxue were filled with lust. Ling Qingxue was so angry that her chest heaved up and down, and her face was flushed red. At this moment, a figure flashed past and pounced at Dao BA and the others. Dao BA felt his vision blur and Xia ruofei, who was a few meters away, had disappeared. Then, he felt a strong force and a series of slaps. He felt a burning pain on his face. From the perspective of little Shen and the others, it was even more shocking. Xia ruofei dashed into the encirclement of Scar’s men like a tiger among a flock of sheep. Xia ruofei’s movements were so fast that they felt like they were watching a fast – forwarded video. On the other hand, Scar’s men were extremely slow. In comparison, they looked like they were in slow motion on television. When everyone came back to their senses, Xia ruofei had already returned to his original position as if nothing had happened. Scarface and the rest of the men were all wailing as they lay on the ground. Their faces were all swollen. In such a short time, each of them had been slapped at least seven or eight times by Xia ruofei. Dao BA was in an especially miserable state. Xia ruofei did not hold back when he slapped him, and his molars were broken. Xia ruofei pursed his lips and said,”your mouths are too smelly. I’m helping you guys to remember!” Also, he dared to be someone else’s hatchet man with such a weak appearance? Let’s go back and drink milk for a few years first!” Little Shen and the others were all dumbfounded. They were completely shocked. Was he still human? Dao BA and the others were from the security company, but they were actually a bunch of aggressive gangsters. Fighting was a common occurrence, but in front of Xia ruofei, they were all weaklings. The reason why old Liu and the others had swaggered over to “support” was because Dao BA was their greatest support. Now that they had all fallen in a single exchange, what were they going to do? Ling Qingxue, on the other hand, looked at Xia ruofei’s back with bright eyes, full of admiration. Since ancient times, beautiful women loved heroes. Xia ruofei’s display of such courage made Ling Qingxue’s love for him even stronger. Xia ruofei looked around. Xiao Shen and the others could not help but avoid his gaze. “Who else is here to move things?” Xia ruofei asked indifferently. Other than Scarface and the rest who were wailing, no one else made a sound. Xiao Shen and the rest did not even dare to breathe. At this moment, a voice came from the office door.””Yo! It’s so lively! What are you doing?”
