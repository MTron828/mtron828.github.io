2366 Viper captured (1)

It was Satan, the mysterious leader of the modr organization, who had called Viper.

After a few hours, the news of the explosion at the modr’s Secret training camp finally reached Satan through official channels.

Of course, Satan and the higher – ups of arulei had a special channel of information transmission between them, and his identity would not be revealed.

Satan’s voice seemed to be a bit old.””Viper, the local police in Basoko have investigated the scene. The entire training camp has been blown up, but the strange thing is ... There’s not a single corpse inside. Everyone, including Golden Fox, is missing ...”

“How is this possible?” said boack in surprise. That was more than a hundred people! Where could they have run to?”

“I’m also very puzzled!” Satan’s voice was grave.”But that is the truth. So far, we have not received any reports from the training camp. They have all gone missing!”

“Boss, is it possible ... That Metatron and the entire training camp left our organization and started a new one?” said Beaulac with a frown.

“That is a possibility.” Satan said,”but what’s the motive? There was no way merendo didn’t know that a hundred newbies wouldn’t be able to do much! Besides, there are more than 20 instructors in the training camp. Not all of them are Metatron’s men. Do you think these instructors would be willing to run away with him?”

“Maybe the opposition was killed by Metatron!” “Metatron must have known that we would hunt him down if he betrayed the organization, so he used the explosion to erase all traces before he left. Then, he took his men to hide ...”

Satan said in confusion,”the problem is ... There’s no way Golden Fox doesn’t know. Even if we lose this training camp, our organization will not suffer any serious losses. He has a group of rookies with him, and they are such a big target. It must be very difficult for them to escape our pursuit. Besides, he is considered to have great power in our organization and has earned enough money. Why would he do such a thankless thing?”

“I don’t know!” Said Boak as he scratched his head. But big brother ... Other than this possibility, I really can’t think of any other possibility! There was not a single corpse at the scene. Could they have been captured by some mysterious force? That was more than a hundred living people! How could he have hidden himself without anyone knowing?”

According to normal logic, Boak’s analysis was right.

However, no matter how imaginative Satan and Boak were, they could never imagine that someone could carry a dimensional pocket around. Even if there were more than 10000 people, they could easily put them into the dimensional pocket and take them away, let alone 100 people.

Satan said,”this is indeed very hard to understand!” Viper, my brother! I need you to make a trip to Basoko town and see if you can find any clues!”

“No problem!” “I’ll leave immediately!” Said Boak.

“Mm! I’ll be waiting for your news!” Satan said,”remember to bring more people, and pay attention to your safety!”

“Understood!” Said Boak.

In fact, the leaders of the modr organization had rarely come out to do anything in person in the past few years. However, the explosion at the training camp and the disappearance of so many people were too strange. Most importantly, among the missing people, one of them was merondo, who had a high position in the modr organization. This was also the reason why Satan had decided to send Boak to personally make a trip.

After the call ended, he put on his slippers and stood up, ready to go back to the castle to change his clothes.

Of course, before that, he still had to choose a few of his best followers.

However, after two steps, he was stunned and his eyes were filled with shock.

He saw a young man walking out from behind the trees. The young man was holding a large – caliber pistol with a silencer, and the black muzzle was pointed at his chest.

The young man had dark skin and high cheekbones. He looked like a typical Southeast Asian man.

He couldn’t believe that someone had sneaked up to him and the security system of the manor did not react at all. There were more than a hundred guards in his Manor. Even if there were a hundred pigs in the manor, they would not be so slow – witted, right?

This young man was Xia ruofei, who had changed his appearance.

In order to save time, he rushed to Zaha city without stopping and immediately found a way to sneak into the manor. He used his psychic power to search and located Boak’s location.

Although the manor was equipped with a lot of high – tech defense measures and had a very strong security force, the degree of security was still not as tight as the secret training camp in Basoko.

After all, the training camp was completely militarized, and it was a tightly – sealed military camp. After all, this Manor was a living place, and the modr organization’s status in arulei could be said to be Supreme. The guards ‘work was actually very easy. Although the guards were still dedicated to their duties, nothing had happened in a long time, and their spirits had long since become very relaxed. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei also had strong spiritual power, which could carry out effective intelligence reconnaissance and danger warning.
