Chapter 1170: Chapter 725 – shocking the four

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei kept them in suspense for a long time, and everyone’s interest was piqued. Shi Yang also smiled and said, “There’s no need to be mentally prepared! Brother Xia, just say it!”

Xia ruofei let out a long sigh and revealed a pitiful expression. His brows were tightly knitted together.

Xia ruofei’s actions made Shi Yang, who was originally joking, a little nervous. She said weakly,””Brother Xia, don’t scare me ...”

Shi Xiao thought to himself that he couldn’t have really seen through the problem! That’s impossible! How could a doctor be able to detect a problem with just a glance? Wouldn’t that make him a God? He must be bluffing!

Xia ruofei sighed.”Shi Yang, have you been feeling insatiable recently? have you been feeling cold all the time? do you sweat a lot when you sleep at night?”

The stone puppet subconsciously nodded.

Xia ruofei continued to ask,”sometimes you feel dizzy, palpitations, suffocation, and shortness of breath?”

The stone puppet nodded again. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

In fact, she felt a little suffocated in her chest. She had been in this condition for more than a month, but the hospital didn’t find anything wrong with her.

At this time, Shi Yang no longer dared to look down on Xia ruofei. She only took one look at him and could see all his problems clearly. She was even more accurate than a CT scan machine!

Just as the stone puppet was staring at Xia ruofei, Xia ruofei sighed and said,””Shi Xiao, you should eat more during this time! Eat whatever you want to eat ...”

Shi Xiao’s words were like a bolt of lightning on a clear day, completely dumbfounded.

Eat whatever you want to eat ... What does this mean?

Everyone was originally whispering to each other, but after hearing Xia ruofei’s words, they were all stunned. They looked at the stone puppet in disbelief and then at the calm Xia ruofei.

Then, the stone puppet’s mouth pouted, and it began to cry.

As she cried, she said,”brother Xia, is ... Is my illness very serious?” You ... You don’t have to hide it from me. I can take it. Just tell me ... How much time do I have left ...”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be dumbfounded. This girl looked so carefree, but why was she so easy to tease?

Song Wei did not know whether to laugh or cry as she looked at Xia ruofei and quickly said,””Shi Yang, don’t listen to Xia ruofei’s nonsense. He’s just trying to scare you!”

Shi Xiao sobbed and said,”Sister Song, don’t comfort me!” Brother Xia ... Brother Xia is so accurate ... The symptoms he mentioned ... I have all of them ... Sob sob sob ...”

Everyone looked at each other. They had thought that Xia ruofei was just trying to be mysterious and that the stone puppet had been scared silly. They didn’t expect Xia ruofei to be able to accurately name so many symptoms without even touching the patient.

This was a little magical.

Xia ruofei quickly said,”Shi Yang, I haven’t finished!” What are you crying for? It’s not a big problem!”

The stone puppet was stunned for a moment, but it didn’t even bother to wipe its tears and quickly asked,”Brother Xia, you ... You mean ... I can still be saved?”

“This isn’t a life – threatening problem. It’s just a small problem. It can’t be said to be incurable.” Xia ruofei said, not knowing whether to laugh or cry.

“Ah?” The stone puppet couldn’t come to its senses for a while.

Xia ruofei didn’t dare to joke anymore and quickly said,””You’re just a little weak. You just need to pay attention to your diet. I’ll give you a prescription later, and your symptoms will naturally disappear after you take it for a while ...”

“It’s that simple?” The stone puppet felt as if it had returned from hell to heaven.

However, she quickly came back to her senses and couldn’t help but say fiercely,””Then, you were sighing and making me eat whatever I wanted to eat! You’re scaring me on purpose ...”

Xia ruofei showed an innocent expression and said,””I’m not! You misunderstood ...”

“Have you been dieting recently?” Xia ruofei asked immediately.

“I’ve been trying to lose weight recently ...”Shi Yang lowered his head and said.

Then, she raised her head and said,””But what does this have to do with the illness you’re talking about?”

Xia ruofei said righteously,”how is it not related?” It had a huge relationship! Losing weight also required science. Not only would dieting not help lose weight, but it would also easily destroy the body. It’s because you’ve taken in too little nutrients that your qi and blood are weak, and you’ve been invaded by evil!”

Xia ruofei stood up and glanced at the young masters and young ladies. He realized that he had successfully attracted everyone’s attention and could not help but feel proud.

He continued,”that’s why I told you not to control your appetite. Eat whatever you want to eat. Your body will only slowly get better if you take in enough nutrients!” Who knew you’d be so timid that you were so scared that you cried ...”

Song Wei couldn’t help but smile. She knew that Xia ruofei was just trying to scare Shi Yang. However, after Xia ruofei said that, it seemed like there was no flaw. Instead, it was because Shi Yang was too timid.

Lu You, on the other hand, glanced at Xia ruofei and thought,”This guy really had a way with girls. No wonder so many beautiful women were attracted to him ...

The stone puppet wiped away her tears in embarrassment and pouted,”Brother Xia, you’re so long – winded when you talk. It’s so scary ...”
