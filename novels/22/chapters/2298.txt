2299 The famous doctor Ge Jun_It would be fine if it was just a traffic accident, but if it was really a deliberate plan, the two cars in front and behind must have cooperated. The truck in the back might have been aiming to kill song Qiming.

Guangzhi Cao’s expression immediately turned serious, and he quickly said,”I got it, I’ll contact the police immediately!”

Guangzhi Cao took out his phone and was about to call the police, but Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,””Wait! Brother Cao, the most important thing now is to arrange for people to protect aunt Fang and Song Wei. If someone is really trying to assassinate uncle song, then aunt Fang and Song Wei might be in danger!”

Guangzhi Cao’s expression turned cold, and he immediately said, “That’s possible! President Xia, thank you for your reminder!”

In fact, with Song Wei’s current cultivation, ordinary enemies would not be able to threaten her. However, Xia ruofei did not want Song Wei to know that song Qiming’s car accident might not be a simple accident. Without Song Wei knowing, Xia ruofei was also worried that if something happened, it would be too late for regrets.

If someone was really behind this and they wanted to attack, it would be easy to Dodge in the open but hard to defend against in the dark. If the other party were to use firearms, Song Wei might be hit since she was not as experienced as Xia ruofei who had a natural sense of danger.

Therefore, it was still necessary to provide some protection.

“Brother Cao,” Xia ruofei said,”in order to not make aunt Fang and Song Wei nervous, I think we should protect them in secret. Don’t let them find out.”

“Alright, I understand!” Guangzhi Cao said.

He immediately contacted the Public Security Department and asked for police assistance. One was to immediately investigate the driver of the truck behind them. The other was to deploy the police force to set up surveillance near the hospital and protect Fang Liyun and her daughter in secret.

Guangzhi Cao had gone to make a call. Xia ruofei was worried about song Qiming, so he went to the intensive care unit.

With professor Chen’s instructions, Xia ruofei was able to enter the intensive care unit without a hitch. However, he had still followed the rules and sanitized himself. He had also put on a sterile suit, shoe covers, face mask, and so on.

Xia ruofei,’fully armed’, was led into song Qiming’s ward by a doctor on duty.

The doctor on duty had obviously received instructions. She left after leading Xia ruofei to the ward and closed the door for him.

It was very quiet in the ICU, with only the sound of the equipment beeping from time to time.

Xia ruofei walked to the bed and looked. Song Qiming was lying quietly, relying on a ventilator and other medical equipment to maintain his life.

Xia ruofei reached out and placed his hand on song Qiming’s wrist. His spiritual power silently entered song Qiming’s body.

He did not set up any more arrays as he did not plan to do any other treatment for the time being. Even if he used his mental strength to check song Qiming’s pulse, he would use Traditional Chinese Medicine methods. It did not matter even if the surveillance camera peeked in and recorded it. In fact, no matter where Xia ruofei touched song Qiming’s body, the effect would be the same.

In the short time that had passed, song Qiming’s body had absorbed the remaining components of the spirit Heart Flower petals. Xia ruofei had also performed acupuncture on him, so his recovery was much better than in the operating room.

Xia ruofei could feel that song Qiming’s brain injury had basically recovered. Even the swelling on his face had reduced by a lot. The wound from the open skull operation had not recovered yet, but from his physical indicators, there should be no major problems.

But the strange thing was that he didn’t show any signs of waking up. It was as if his soul had fallen into a deep sleep and was completely sealed.

As he thought of this, an idea suddenly flashed across Xia ruofei’s mind.

Could it really be a problem with the soul?

He also immediately thought of the time when Song Wei was infected by the peach blossom miasma and fell into a deep sleep. She did not react to any external stimuli.

Song Wei’s soul was damaged.

This time, song Qiming’s head was severely injured. When Xia ruofei arrived, his brain tissue had basically all died. If he had been a little later, he would have really died.

Once all the brain tissues were dead, it would be completely irreversible. Even if the petals of the spirit Heart Flower had magical recovery effects, it would not be able to play any role. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Fortunately, when Xia ruofei rushed to the operating room, although 99% of song Qiming’s brain tissue had been necrotic, there were still a few remaining cells and nerves that were still alive. It was this pitiful amount of “sparks” that allowed the spirit Heart Flower petals to come back to life.

What Xia ruofei was thinking about now was whether such a serious injury would damage his soul. Or from another perspective, when the soul sensed that the physical body was in a state of near death, would it have self – Protection or stress functions and seal itself up?

Xia ruofei had no clue. After all, he did not have a deep understanding of the brain and soul.

However, no matter what, song Qiming’s current condition was indeed very strange. His injuries were clearly not a big deal. His brain cells, tissues, and neurons had basically recovered, but he had no reaction to external stimuli. He did not even have a conditioned reflex. This was contrary to medical common sense.

In fact, song Qiming was in a vegetative state. However, in a vegetative state, only the cerebral cortex function was lost. Some primitive reflexes still existed, and they had a defensive reaction to pain and other strong stimuli. Song Qiming, on the other hand, did not even have these basic reflexes. From this perspective, he was very close to brain death.
