Chapter 824: Beating up the unscrupulous reporter (1)

Translator: 549690339

Huang Zhenyu felt that his luck had been pretty good recently.

He was originally just a correspondent of the county TV station and didn’t even have an official news reporter’s certificate. Every day, he would post some news about the county leaders to waste his time. However, two months ago, he met the Deputy Director of the provincial TV station’s entertainment channel’s reporter Department at a dinner party.

At that time, the provincial station was selecting reporters from all the news units in the province. After Huang Zhenyu learned of the news, he gave the Deputy Director of the entertainment channel’s reporters Department a big gift and invited him to the famous Tian Xiang nightclub in the provincial capital for a night. Just the two chicks he ordered to sleep with the Deputy Director cost him 30000 Yuan.

After he got his job done, Huang Zhenyu was also successfully selected and transferred to the provincial entertainment channel, becoming a reporter of the provincial media.

Although his reporter’s certificate had not been obtained yet, Huang Zhenyu had captured the information of many small celebrities during this period of time and had successfully gained a firm foothold in the entertainment channel.

This time, when he was waiting for a celebrity at the airport, he saw a team of military vehicles with black veils on them, so he turned to follow this lead.

Later, Huang Zhenyu found out that it was a martyr who had returned to his hometown to be buried, but the provincial and municipal media did not report much. Only guhuang County TV station reported a piece of news, which was quite low – Key.

So, Huang Zhenyu asked around and found out about the martyr’s parents. He took a cameraman and found squad leader Luo’s parents directly. Squad leader Luo’s mother couldn’t take the shock and fainted on the spot after hearing the bad news. She passed away a few days later.

Not only did Huang Zhenyu not feel guilty at all, but he even felt that this was a news headline. Didn’t people like to watch such sensational news nowadays?

When he realized that squad leader Luo’s parents had heard the news of their son’s sacrifice from him that day, he immediately edited the scene that was shot that day. Although the broadcasting standards at the provincial station were stricter, the corresponding new media platforms were relatively more relaxed. Very soon, the video was posted on the entertainment channel’s official Weibo.

Naturally, this Weibo post also received a lot of attention, and of course, there was a lot of controversy.

However, Huang Zhenyu was not afraid of controversy at all. Controversy meant that there was a topic to talk about, and if there was a topic to talk about, it meant that he was going to be famous.

Therefore, Huang Zhenyu was not ashamed of it. Instead, he was smug.

The burial time in Ganjiang province was relatively early. After the overnight funeral, the deceased would be sent to the mountain the next morning.

After Huang Zhenyu heard that squad leader Luo’s mother was buried today, he actually brought two cameramen over, ready to give a “follow – up report.”

When he arrived near the Luo family’s house, he was stopped by the indignant villagers. These villagers hated the unscrupulous reporter and reprimanded him.

When Lin Yue ‘e heard the news, she also came to the door to stop him.

Ever since Huang Zhenyu went from being a correspondent of a County TV station to a provincial reporter, his ego had inflated rapidly. How could he still care about these countryside villagers?

Huang Zhenyu stood on a rock and directed the cameraman to turn on the camera and start shooting. He then glanced at the crowd triumphantly and said,””We reporters have the right to interview! Do you understand the right to interview? Whoever dares to stop me is breaking the law! Be careful, you’ll be locked up after we take a picture of you!”

The villagers did not know what Huang Zhenyu’s so – called “right to interview” was, but they could still understand what being in prison meant. They were intimidated by Huang Zhenyu’s words, and their faces showed a hesitant look. They could not help but feel a trace of fear.

Lin Yue ‘E’s face was Haggard. Her thin and weak body blocked the door as she said,””This is our family’s private matter. We don’t want to be interviewed ...”

Huang Zhenyu looked at Lin Yue ‘e, as if he hadn’t heard her words. He asked,””You’re Luo Zhicheng’s lover? I want to know the details of Luo Zhicheng’s sacrifice and which unit did he serve in?”

When Lin Yue ‘e heard her husband’s name, she felt an indescribable pain in her heart. She suppressed her anger and said,””I’m sorry, no comment. ”

Huang Zhenyu pouted and said,”we’ve consulted the publicity department of the provincial military, and they said they don’t know anything about Luo Zhicheng’s situation. This doesn’t make sense!” I think ... Could it be that Luo Zhicheng didn’t die on duty, or maybe he died in a man – made accident, and the unit he was in gave him a martyr title to avoid responsibility?”

When Lin Yue ‘e heard this, she was so angry that her chest heaved up and down. Her eyes were red as she shouted,””You’re talking nonsense! Venomous slander! We don’t welcome you here, so get lost!” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

The corners of Huang Zhenyu’s lips curled up slightly, and a hint of smugness appeared in his eyes. This was the effect he wanted. The scene of Lin Yue ‘e flipping out had been completely captured by the camera. As for the words he had said earlier on when he had intentionally provoked Lin Yue’ e, they could be edited out later.

At that time, he could just casually make up some content and produce another sensational report.

Huang Zhenyu felt that everything had been going smoothly for him during this period of time. Even the city walls could not stop his good luck! It was boring to wait for a star at the airport, but he didn’t expect to find such a big piece of news.

Huang Zhenyu gestured for the cameraman to continue filming as he said leisurely,””It’s our job as reporters to investigate the truth! Why are you so agitated? Could it be that you’re hiding something, and you’re angry because I was right?”

“You’re talking nonsense!” Lin Yue ‘e, who was usually weak, didn’t realize that Huang Zhenyu was deliberately provoking her. When she heard Huang Zhenyu defaming her martyr husband, she had already lost her rationality.
