On the way back to his office, Zhu zhihang went through the whole thing again. Zeng jianzhang and Wu Liqian didn’t disclose this matter. Also, Wu Liqian reported last night that the Standing Committee would be holding a meeting today. The possibility of information being leaked from other channels was very low.

Not only did Liu haojun get the information, but he also managed to get it through his superior’s connections. It would take time, which meant that the news was likely to have been leaked last night.

And it was very likely that it would appear at his segment!

The problem was simple.

Zhu zhihang had never mentioned this to anyone. He didn’t even tell his wife and children when he came home last night. There was only one possibility if someone could hear this.

Thinking of this, the coldness in Zhu zhihang’s eyes became even stronger.

After he returned to his office, his Secretary, Jin Yuan, came in with a folder. He bowed slightly and said,””County Head, these are the documents for circulation ...”

Zhu zhihang stared at Jin Yuan for two seconds and said,””Put it here!”

“Alright!” Jin Yuan put the documents on the desk and took Zhu zhihang’s Cup naturally, ready to fill it up.

“Little gold!” Zhu zhihang stopped him and stared into his eyes.”How long have you been working for me?”

A hint of panic appeared in Jin Yuan’s eyes, but he pretended to be calm and said,””County Head, I was transferred over after last year’s spring Festival. It’s been more than a year ...”

“It’s been more than a year!” Zhu zhihang muttered to himself,”time really flies! Alright, you may leave! I don’t drink water ...”

“Alright, County Head!” Jin Yuan said. Then, he gently put down the cup and left the office.

Zhu zhihang leaned back in his chair, closed his eyes tiredly, and muttered to himself,””It’s been more than a year, you’re probably familiar with raising a dog! I didn’t expect you to be an ungrateful Wolf ...”

He was very clear about Jin Yuan’s resume. This young man had no background and got in with his own strength. In the past few years, he had been writing materials in the district headquarters office. It could be said that he had done a lot of work, but he had not been able to show his face at all.

This was also the portrayal of many grassroots civil servants.

Zhu zhihang had a good eye for talent. After the previous Secretary was demoted, he personally asked him to be the Secretary. For an ordinary clerk, this was almost like reaching the sky in one step.

Zhu zhihang felt that even if he did not have the gratitude of knowing Jin Yuan, he was at least a talented Bo Le.

Because of this, when Zhu zhihang found out that Jin Yuan had betrayed him, he felt extremely heartbroken.

He didn’t even need to question Jin Yuan, as he already had an answer in his heart. The panic in Jin Yuan’s eyes didn’t escape his eyes, which further confirmed his judgment.

Zhu zhihang leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes to rest. After more than ten minutes, he picked up the phone on his desk and dialed an internal number.

“Director Shi, have you decided on the group of cadres that will be sent to the village for the exchange?” Zhu zhihang asked indifferently.

On the other end of the phone, the director of the government office, Shi Qingyuan, said,”County Head, the preliminary list has been finalized. We were just about to let you have a look!”

“Put Jin Yuan on this list as well,” Zhu zhihang said.”As for who to replace, you can do it yourself ... After the list is done, report to me as soon as possible!”

Shi Qingyuan was stunned. Jin Yuan was Zhu zhihang’s Secretary! Being a village cadre was not a lucrative position, so it was impossible to communicate with him! Besides, how long had it been since Jin Yuan took office? Generally speaking, for the stability and continuity of work, the staff members around the leaders would not change so frequently.

However, Shi Qingyuan was no longer a rookie in the system. He knew when to ask and when to be confused. There must be a reason why Zhu zhihang suddenly proposed to communicate with Jin Yuan. When he did not understand the situation, his best choice was naturally to not say anything and firmly carry out the plan.

So, Shi Qingyuan quickly came back to his senses and said,””Alright, County Head! I’ll make the arrangements immediately ...”

Following that, Shi Qingyuan still had to ask,””County Head, what about your Secretary ...”

It was easy to talk to Jin Yuan, but it was not so easy to assign a new Secretary to Zhu zhihang.

Zhu zhihang said a little indifferently,”transfer someone from the government office to temporarily hold the fort!” We’ll talk about the Secretary later ... By the way, you can talk to Jin Yuan. I won’t be showing up. Tell him to hand over the work before work tomorrow!”

“Alright, County Head!” Shi Qingyuan quickly replied.

……

While Zhu zhihang was cleaning up the mole, Wu Liqian went to Secretary Zeng jianzhang’s office.

“Secretary Zeng!” Wu Liqian greeted him weakly.

Zeng jianzhang stood up very enthusiastically and said with a smile,””Comrade Liqian is here! Sit here, sit here ...”

He personally led Wu Liqian to the reception area of the office, then shouted,””Little yang, get a glass of water for County Head Wu!”

Secretary yang quickly brought a cup of tea over. After Yang left the office, Zeng jianzhang said with a smile,””Comrade Liqian, today’s main purpose is to talk to you about the peach blossom company’s project. County Head Zhu and I both know that this project was facilitated by you and you were the one who was in charge of the early stages of the project. I know you might not be able to understand why I handed this project over to Secretary Liu today ...”
