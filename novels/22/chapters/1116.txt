People like Zhao Yongjun and Liu Jian, who had already known Xia ruofei at the birthday banquet, often toasted Xia ruofei with great enthusiasm.

Compared to Hou Liang and the others, Zhao Yongjun and the others had a more direct understanding of Xia ruofei’s special status. Furthermore, it was all thanks to Xia ruofei that general Zhao Cheng was able to retain his military position and even advance a step further. Hence, Zhao Yongjun’s attitude towards Xia ruofei was extremely close.

The drinking session lasted for more than two hours. It was almost midnight. Under Xia ruofei’s suggestion, everyone had their last glass of wine.

Originally, song Rui wanted to find a club to sing in, but Xia ruofei rejected him.

The main reason was that it was too late. Besides, song Rui wasn’t going back to the song family’s old house tonight. If he had too much fun outside, it wouldn’t be good if elder song heard about it.

Although song Rui wanted more, he still respected Xia ruofei’s opinion. So, the group said goodbye to each other at the door of the private kitchen and left.

Xia ruofei didn’t know if Zhao Yongjun and the others had another event, but he was definitely not going. He didn’t even let song Rui go.

Although alcohol had no effect on Xia ruofei, he had drunk more than half a kilogram, so he did not drive.

The private kitchen of the Wang family had already called a few drivers in advance, so Xia ruofei asked them to drive and take the two directly back to the Hilton Hotel near Wang Fujing.

Xia ruofei got a single room for song Rui at the front desk, but this guy did not go back to his room. Instead, he shamelessly followed Xia ruofei back to his room.

After entering the room, song Rui didn’t treat himself as an outsider. He first picked up an unopened pack of specially – supplied cigarettes from the bedside table, opened the package quickly, popped one out, and lit it. Then, he put the pack of cigarettes into his pocket without blushing or skipping a beat.

Xia ruofei could not help but shake his head with a bitter smile when he saw song Rui’s shameless look.

“It’s almost 12 o’ clock, why are you following me?” Xia ruofei said helplessly,”go back to your room and rest!”

“Ruofei, I’m here for your advice ...” Song Rui took a puff of his cigarette and said.

“Yo! If it’s something that even you, young master Song, are in a difficult position, what advice can I give you?” Xia ruofei asked half – jokingly.

“It has nothing to do with that!” Song Rui waved his hand and said. It’s about chasing girls, I think you’re definitely better than me!”

“Go! I’ve only been in a relationship once, and I’m still in it. How can I be more experienced than you, a Playboy?” Xia ruofei laughed and scolded.

Song Rui glanced at Xia ruofei and said,””Don’t beat around the bush in front of an honest person! You may only have one girlfriend, but you’ve also been with many other girls! Not to mention others, even aunt Tian’s daughter is looking at you with a strange gaze! And that beautiful President of your company, your big – hearted girlfriend ...”

The image of Lu You and Feng Rao appeared in Xia ruofei’s mind, and he felt guilty for no reason.

However, he quickly smiled and said,”there’s nothing going on between Lu you and me!” Don’t tell me you’re jealous?”

“Go to hell! It’s not like you don’t know that I have no interest in that girl at all! Why are you jealous!” Song Rui said gloomily,”ruofei, I’m serious. You have to help me think of an idea ...”

Xia ruofei stopped joking and asked,””Still that Zhuo Yiyi?”

“Nonsense! Do I look like that kind of half – hearted person? Once you’ve decided, you definitely won’t change!” Song Rui said in dissatisfaction.

The last time at the three mountains, song Rui had fallen in love with Zhuo Yiyi at first sight. Xia ruofei had seen through it at that time. After that, Xia ruofei had often teased song Rui about this matter, so he had not been shy in front of Xia ruofei and had admitted it directly.

“Don’t you usually have a way?” Xia ruofei asked curiously,”Zhuo Yiyi should be working in the capital now, right? While you’re in the capital, just take the opportunity to take it down ...”

“It’s not that easy!”Song Rui said with a bitter face. I’ve been going to the capital every few days, but I haven’t made any progress ...”

Then, song Rui began to pour out his grievances.

Last time, it was thanks to song Rui’s help that Zhuo Yiyi was able to avoid being squeezed out by those with connections and successfully enter Yanjing Museum to work. Song Rui also took the opportunity to obtain Zhuo Yiyi’s contact information.

During this period of time, song Rui frequently used all sorts of opportunities to go to the capital. He also often went to look for Zhuo Yiyi, treating her to meals, and giving her gifts. However, Zhuo Yiyi seemed to be a little insensitive when it came to relationships. After this period of offense, Zhuo Yiyi’s relationship with song Rui had become much closer. However, she seemed to be very slow and did not understand song Rui’s feelings. She even seemed to treat song Rui as a brother.

This made song Rui rather depressed. There were several times when he wanted to make their relationship clear and confess to Zhuo Yiyi directly, but he was afraid that he would scare her and make it impossible for them to even be friends.

After Xia ruofei heard this, he couldn’t help but laugh. “You’re usually quite smart! Why is it so hard to chase a girl?”

“This girl is different from the others,” song Rui said gloomily,”the tricks we used in the past didn’t work on her at all ...”

“Then she probably doesn’t know your identity yet, right?” Xia ruofei asked, grinning.

“Nonsense!” Song Rui said,”I hope that you can like me as a person and not because of my family background ...”

“I didn’t expect our young master Song to be an innocent young man who has a beautiful vision for love!” Xia ruofei laughed.

Song Rui was a little angry and said,””Hey! I’m looking for you for advice, can’t you have some sympathy! I’m already like this, and you’re still making fun of me. You’re too inhumane!”

Xia ruofei held back his laughter and said,”alright!” This is indeed a difficult problem, I have to think about it ... But I drank too much just now, and it’s so late now, my brain is already a mess, I really can’t think of anything!”

Song Rui quickly said,”then ... Then you should rest early!” Help me think of a good plan tomorrow!”

“Hmm, maybe I’ll have an idea after I’m done resting ...” Xia ruofei said.

“Alright, alright, alright! I won’t disturb you anymore!” Song Rui quickly said,”it’s a deal. Give me some good advice tomorrow!”

“If you don’t leave now, my mind might still be in a mess tomorrow!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“I’m leaving, I’m leaving!” Song Rui said,”I’ll leave now!”

After he finished speaking, he walked out. After two steps, he stopped and picked up the tea box that Xia ruofei had left on the coffee table. He put it in his arms and laughed evilly. “I’ll take it back and try it ...”

Xia ruofei was so angry that he waved his hand and said,”get lost!” Are you a Bandit? Every time, it’s like a F * cking Locust passing through ...”

Song Rui chuckled and ran away.

Xia ruofei shook his head helplessly. He raised his wrist to look at his watch. It was already past midnight. It was already half past midnight. He decided not to cultivate and took a shower in the bathroom. Then, he fell asleep.
