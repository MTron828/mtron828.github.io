Chapter 1049: A precious gift (1)

Translator: 549690339

Inside the box was a lifelike Jade Leaf.

Xia ruofei had bought a piece of well – colored jade a few days ago and spent an entire day in the spirit map to carve it.

Although the quality of the Jade was very high, it was only worth a few hundred thousand Yuan. It was not enough to make MA Xiong and the others lose their composure.

At MA Xiong’s level, or even with Xia ruofei’s wealth, a few hundred thousand Yuan was nothing. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

What truly shocked MA Xiong and the others was the carving technique of the Jade Leaf.

The MA family was a truly wealthy family, and the Hengfeng group was in the jewelry business. Therefore, whether it was MA Xiong or Ma Zhiming, they naturally had good taste.

They could tell at a glance that this life – like green jade Leaf was not ordinary. The whole leaf was natural and exuded a natural charm. There was no trace of carving on it, as if it had been born with this appearance.

Upon closer inspection, every curve and vein of the leaf seemed to be in harmony with the laws of heaven and earth. MA Xiong and the others could feel that even the slightest deviation would cause the Jade Leaf to lose its charm.

This was clearly a superb carving technique that was even at the integration of heaven and man realm!

In the early days, Hengfeng group’s main business was in the jewelry industry. The company had many sculptors all year round, many of whom were famous masters in the industry.

However, even if these jade carving Masters were to make their own moves, none of them would be able to carve the Jade Leaf to such a natural state.

The value of the Jade itself might only be a few hundred thousand.

However, after such a process, its value had increased by at least tens or even hundreds of times.

Most importantly, the Jade Leaf was similar to the top – grade one – headed abalone, and one might not be able to buy it even if one had money.

After all, a sculpted master at this level couldn’t just casually make a move. This kind of peak work couldn’t be completely measured by money.

Therefore, MA Xiong and the other two immediately realized the value of the Jade Leaf.

Tian Huixin was the first to react. She quickly said,””Ruofei, your gift is too expensive. We can’t accept it.”

Ma Zhiming also came back to his senses and immediately said,”Yes, yes, yes. Xia Sheng, how can you give such a treasure to a child?”

When Huan Huan saw the Jade Leaf, her eyes were filled with love. This was a gift from brother RUO Fei! Moreover, this Jade Leaf was extremely pure and had a natural charm to it. Although the child did not understand it, he subconsciously felt very close to it.

When she heard that her parents had rejected Xia ruofei’s gift, Huanhuan pouted. However, she was very sensible and did not cry. She only held the box tightly with a strong sense of reluctance.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Mr. MA, aunt Huixin, this is my gift to Huanhuan. It’s not for you. It’s not nice for you to reject it on behalf of the child, right?” Look at how much Huanhuan likes this gift!”

MA Xiong cleared his throat and said,”Xia Sheng, our child is still young. Your Jade Leaf can be considered a peerless treasure. We really can’t accept it!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Old master Ma, this is a gift from me to Huanhuan. Jade has a price, but feelings are priceless. I’m very close to Huanhuan. Please don’t reject it ...”

“This ...” Ma Zhiming and Tian Huixin looked at each other.

Xia ruofei continued,”old master Ma, I treat you guys as my own people. Huanhuan is like my sister. It’s just a small gift. You guys don’t have to be so formal, right?”

Ma Zhiming and Tian Huixin were still hesitating. MA Xiong was a formidable figure in the business world after all, and he had strong courage and decisiveness. Seeing that Xia ruofei had already put it this way, he only muttered to himself for a moment before saying,””Zhiming, Huixin, since Xia Sheng has said so, let’s accept it!”

Ma Zhiming could only nod and say,”thank you, Xia Sheng!”

MA Xiong looked at Xia ruofei deeply and said,””Xia Sheng, I won’t say anything more. You’ve done a great favor for the MA family, and we’re all family. We’re one family, so there’s no need to talk like two families!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.

“Huanhuan, why don’t you thank brother RUO Fei?” Tian Huixin quickly said.

When Huan Huan saw that the adults had finally allowed her to accept the gift, she was elated. She immediately said sweetly to Xia ruofei,””Thank you, brother ruofei!”

Then, she leaned over and planted a kiss on Xia ruofei’s cheek with her sweet lips.

Everyone couldn’t help but laugh.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,””You’re welcome, Huanhuan. Can big brother help you put this Jade Leaf on?”

“En!” Huan Huan nodded heavily.

This Jade Leaf had already been strung with a red string in advance. Xia ruofei picked up the two ends of the string and warned the MA family,””Make sure Huanhuan wears this Jade Leaf at all times. Don’t take it off under any circumstances.”

Although MA Xiong and the others felt that it was not safe for the child to wear such an expensive Jade Leaf, it was a gift from Xia ruofei. Besides, the MA family was a wealthy family and had bodyguards to escort them in and out of the house. Even if Huan Huan wore the Jade Leaf, it would not matter too much.

Hence, when they saw Xia ruofei’s Serious Request, they immediately nodded in agreement.

Only then did Xia ruofei pick up the Jade Leaf with a smile. He wrapped it around Huan Huan’s neck and carefully fastened the lock on the back.
