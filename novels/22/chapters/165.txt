Chapter 166: Chapter 163 – a big move (1)

After the two of them walked onto the stage, the sound of small talk and conversation in the venue suddenly quieted down. Everyone’s eyes were focused on the stage. MA Xiongxian picked up the microphone and said with a smile,”Thank you, everyone, for your love. Today’s auction was decided on the spot, mainly for my little friend Xia ruofei, Xia Sheng. Thank you for your support! I believe that no one will regret coming to this auction!” After he finished speaking, MA Xiong passed the microphone to Xia ruofei and cupped his hands at everyone. He walked off the stage and sat down in an empty seat in the first row. Tian Huixin and Lu You, who were at the side, were very curious. Tian Huixin couldn’t help but turn to her husband and ask,””Zhiming, what is Xia going to auction?” “You’ll know soon enough!”Ma Zhiming said with a smile. Xia Sheng is always full of surprises, and this time will definitely be no exception!” “Uncle, why are you still keeping us in suspense?” “What good things can that guy have for auction?” Lu youjiao asked. Even if he were to sell his entire farm, that bit of money wouldn’t be enough to catch the eyes of these rich people!” Ma Zhiming laughed and said,”Youyou, don’t look down on Xia Sheng!” My dad is also looking forward to the auction!” Lu You looked at Xia ruofei who was on the stage and pouted.””I don’t believe you ...” Xia ruofei was dressed in a well – ironed Brioni suit, looking rather suave. Under everyone’s gaze, he didn’t have stage fright at all. He raised his hand slightly to the side of the stage, and a row of tall and beautiful ceremonial ladies, each holding a tray, walked up to the stage in a row. Just like the auction just now, the items on the trays were covered with red silk. The waitresses placed the trays neatly on two rows of long display tables and then left in an orderly manner from the other side. Xia ruofei picked up the microphone and said with a smile,””Hello, everyone. I’m the CEO of paradise Corporation, Xia ruofei. Thank you for your presence, and thank you for old Mr. Ma’s unreserved support. Thank you, Jiahua Hotel, for providing me with such a great venue and service.” Then, Xia ruofei said directly,””The guests who have come today are all from the Grao family’s truffle auction. I’m sure everyone is a loyal fan of truffles. Our paradise Corporation also happens to have a batch of very good truffles, so we hope to take this opportunity to hold an auction. Friends who didn’t manage to get the Grao family’s white truffle just now, don’t miss this opportunity!” As soon as Xia ruofei finished his sentence, the guests started to discuss among themselves. Many of them looked disappointed. They had come for MA Xiong’s name, but they did not expect that the person in question was a young man, and the item was truffles. What truffles could be of a higher quality than grazo truffles? The people present were all very picky, and ordinary goods simply wouldn’t catch their eyes. Moreover, the owner of the truffle on the stage was Chinese. Chinese truffles were not very popular internationally, and their prices were even ten to twenty times lower than authentic Italy truffles. To put it bluntly, they were cheap goods, and these upper – Class people would definitely not buy them. Most of the people were still whispering, but Blake, who had been defeated by Xia ruofei twice, stood up immediately. He had a teasing smile on his face and asked loudly,””Mr. Xia, do you think these people here are enough to buy the cheap Chinese truffle in your hands? I suggest you cancel the auction! Otherwise, if all the items were to be left unsold, that would really be the biggest joke in the world!” Xia ruofei’s expression did not change. He looked at Blake and said,”Mr. Blake, what makes you think that I’ll be auctioning cheap truffles? We haven’t even seen the auction item yet, do you have x – ray eyes?” “Is there a need to see?” Blake said contemptuously,”Huaxia truffles are just trash that can’t be shown on stage! The Western mainstream market doesn’t even recognize China truffle!” Although many people had the same thought as Blake and did not think highly of Xia ruofei’s truffle, they were still very confident. Although what Blake said was mostly true, all the Chinese people present couldn’t help but feel angry when they heard Blake’s contemptuous tone toward the truffle. On the other hand, Xia ruofei was still very calm. He said unhurriedly,””Due to the time taken to collect truffles and the environment it grows in, it doesn’t suit the taste of Europeans and Americans, so it’s a fact that the price is low. But no matter what, truffles are a top – Class ingredient, a gift from God. Why is it garbage in Mr. Blake’s mouth? Is this how Blake’s F & B group treats precious ingredients?” Blake’s expression changed slightly. Most of the people present were rich, and many of them were Chinese. Xia ruofei’s actions would not be good for Blake’s restaurant group’s reputation. “I didn’t ...” He quickly said. “Moreover ... I’ve been talking about paradise brand truffles from the beginning to the end. I don’t think I’ve ever said that our company’s truffles are produced in China, right?” Xia ruofei did not give Blake a chance to explain and interrupted him.”How did Mr. Blake come to the conclusion that I was going to auction the Huaxia truffle? Or are you just talking nonsense?” Xia ruofei’s voice became sterner and sterner as he spoke, and his eyes turned cold. In the audience, Monica’s eyes were shining. She was the first to applaud. The rich Chinese people in the audience also applauded, secretly cheering for Xia ruofei’s series of wonderful counterattacks. Blake’s face turned even uglier when he saw Monica clapping first. He sneered and said,”where else can it be produced if not Huaxia?” Could it be Italy? France? The traditional truffle production areas are all monopolized by a few large groups, including the Grao family. The annual production of truffles in the world is limited, so where are you going to find these so – called high – Quality truffles?” “This is our business secret, no comment!” Xia ruofei’s lips curled up as he spoke. Then, he looked around the room and said loudly,”as the saying goes,’what you hear is false, but what you see is true’. I believe that not everyone is as ignorant as Mr. Blake! The next little segment should be able to let everyone make the correct judgment!” With that, Xia ruofei walked to the long display stand and pulled down the red silk at the edge. A transparent sealed container appeared in front of everyone. There was a large piece of white truffle in it. Xia ruofei opened the transparent cover and took the White truffle to a small display stand in the middle of the stage. An electronic scale was already placed there. Xia ruofei placed the White truffle on the scale, and the reading was quickly displayed. One of the hotel staff took a video camera and took a picture of the reading. The next moment, the big screen showed the video. 512 grams. Everyone in the audience saw this number through the big screen at the same time. The sound of discussion immediately rang out. The truffles of Huaxia were usually relatively small, but this white truffle was already more than half a kilogram. It was even bigger than the dozen truffles that the Grasso family had brought out at the start of the auction. This was indeed beyond the expectations of many people. Blake’s expression changed slightly, but he quickly comforted himself, This must be the biggest truffles he had in this batch! Although China truffles were trash, it wasn’t impossible for them to produce one or two larger truffles every year ... Xia ruofei said unhurriedly,”an old leader of Huaxia once said: Practice was the only standard to test the truth! So ... The quality of truffles can only be known by personally experiencing it. ” With that, Xia ruofei clapped his hands twice and the doors of the banquet hall were pushed open at the same time. Rows of tall and beautiful waitresses filed in. Each of them was holding a tray with three to four plates on it. The waiters shuttled back and forth in the venue like butterflies, handing out plates to every guest. Soon, everyone received a copy. Xia ruofei smiled.”Now, everyone has received an egg roll made by the head chef of the French restaurant on the top floor, Mr. Mark Lawrence. But please don’t be in a hurry to eat it. Because...The good show is yet to come!” Xia ruofei nodded to the side of the stage. The Michelin star chef, Mark Lawrence, walked up to the stage in a white chef’s uniform and a tall chef’s hat. He came to Xia ruofei and turned to look at Xia ruofei with a questioning look. Xia ruofei nodded. After getting Xia ruofei’s confirmation, Mark Lawrence immediately picked up the large piece of truffle on the electronic scale and walked down the stage to the guests ‘seats. Xia ruofei stood on the stage and said with a smile,””Yes, everyone’s right. Next, I’ll invite everyone in the banquet hall to taste this white truffle!” As soon as Xia ruofei finished speaking, the crowd was in an uproar! This was definitely a huge sum of money ... It’s almost oneo’ clock in the morning when I finished writing this chapter. Today is the traditional mid – Autumn Festival, so I’ll release the first chapter in advance. I wish all my readers peace, joy, and a happy family! After publishing this chapter, steel gun still had to continue writing. Recently, in order to rush his manuscript, he went to sleep at two or threeo’ clock every day. Writing part – time was indeed very, very hard! So ... Seeing that steel gun was still working hard, could the students use their monthly votes to encourage him?Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m
