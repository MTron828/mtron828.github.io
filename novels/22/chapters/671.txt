Chapter 672: Chapter 473 – mourning (2)

With this relationship, when Qi Min and the others saw this fourth brother, they were like mice seeing a cat. He was really as honest as he could be.

However, Xia ruofei did not know this fourth brother. Hence, he only glanced at him before turning back to continue eating and drinking.

Fourth brother looked at Xia ruofei with interest and asked,””Xiao Qi, what’s going on?”

“Hey! Fourth brother, don’t even mention it!” Qi Min pursed his lips and said,”a small boss of a pharmaceutical factory asked us to do something for him, but he didn’t look like he was begging at all. Instead, he’s all high and mighty! We can’t even eat comfortably, so ... Aren’t we preparing to leave?”

Qi Min then asked enthusiastically,””Ling, you’re in the room next door? Why don’t we go over and give a toast?”

Fourth brother glanced at Qi Min and said,””Little Qi, Oh little Qi! You brat, you dare to play any game! Do you know who I’m treating today? You, kid, dare to go over and propose a toast?”

“Fourth brother, this ...” Qi Min said with a smile.

“Alright!” Fourth brother said impatiently,”the guest I invited today, even my old master has to be polite to him. You don’t have to join in the fun!”

When Qi Min heard this, he couldn’t help but tremble slightly. He quickly said,””Yes, yes, yes ...”

Fourth brother took a glance and continued,””Alright, if you want to leave, then hurry up and get lost. Don’t let the empty rooms affect our drinking mood!”

“Yes, yes, yes, fourth brother, we know!” Qi Min said carefully.

Fourth brother nodded. Just as he was about to leave the room, another voice came from behind him,””CEng Xiaosi, are you deliberately avoiding the wine? It’s a little unkind to run for so long!”

Qi Min and the others looked at each other, wondering who this person was. He actually called his fourth brother “CEng Xiaosi” so casually. How awesome!

......

Fourth brother’s originally unruly face immediately piled up with a smile. He turned around and said,””Young master Song, I wouldn’t dare! I was afraid that the noise here would affect your mood to drink, so I came over to say hello!”

This was the first time Qi Min had seen his fourth brother speak to someone in such a respectful manner. It was obvious that this young master Song was not on the same level as his fourth brother!

Thinking of young master song’s surname, there seemed to be only one powerful family with the surname song in China. The answer was obvious.

Qi Min’s emotions were surging, and he took the opportunity to come forward and get close to him,””Young master Song, I’m really sorry. There are insensible people here making a scene and disturbing your meal. I’ll get them to scram now!”

After he finished speaking, Qi Min turned around and arrogantly said,””The one surnamed Xia! Why don’t you get out of here? You affected young master song’s mood when he was drinking, can you bear the responsibility?”

He kun, Xue Jinshan, Zhou Qing, and Bai He all looked at Xia ruofei worriedly. At their level, they naturally did not know fourth brother, much less who young master Song was. However, even Qi Min had instantly become a Lackey, so how could they not realize that the other party had a powerful background?

Only Xia ruofei was still calm and composed, looking like he was sitting on a fishing platform.

When he heard “young master Song” ‘s voice, Xia ruofei was already sighing in his heart that the world was too small. Or perhaps, the capital was too small. When did this kid come to the capital? and how could he be drinking next door?

Could it be that she was really fated with him? Xia ruofei could not help but feel a chill in his heart.

Xia ruofei’s mind was running wild and he did not hear what Qi Min said.

Qi Min saw that Xia ruofei was still as calm as a mountain and was even more furious. He shot a look at Lu Ping and Guo Ziyang, and the three of them came forward to pull Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei finally came back to his senses.

He furrowed his brows slightly and seemed to casually shake his body. Qi Min and the other two immediately felt a huge force coming at them. They couldn’t help but stagger back a few steps until they hit the screen of the private room.

Xia ruofei gently brushed away the clothes that Qi Min and the rest had touched. Then, he stood up unhurriedly and slowly turned around.

Fourth brother could not help but frown when he saw that the little boss of the pharmaceutical factory that Qi Min had mentioned had actually taken action. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

This was too unruly! No wonder Xiao Qi and the others did not like him just now! How was this the attitude one should have when asking for help?

However, just as fourth brother was about to scold him, young master Song, who was behind him, said in a surprised voice,””RUO Fei? What are you doing in the capital?”

This young master Song was elder song’s eldest grandson, Xia ruofei’s good friend, song Rui.

As song Rui spoke, he strode forward and punched Xia ruofei’s chest. Then he said,””You didn’t even tell me in advance that you’re in my territory? That’s not interesting enough!”

Xia ruofei pouted and said,”so the entire forty – nine city is your territory?” Does your old man know that you’re so awesome?”

Fourth brother, who was standing at the side, was dumbfounded. He did not expect the little boss of the pharmaceutical factory that Qi Min had mentioned to have such a powerful background. He even called young master Song his brother.

If song shaowan had said anything just now, he might have already scolded her and offended her!

When he thought of this, fourth brother’s gaze was as if he wanted to kill someone. He looked at the three ashen – faced men.

Qi Min, Lu Ping, and Guo Ziyang’s minds were completely blank at this time. It was as if a hundred trains had passed by at the same time, and they had completely lost the ability to think.

This ordinary – looking little boss of the pharmaceutical factory was actually young master song’s friend?

The person who had just made things difficult for him, humiliated him, and even threatened to block his project was actually young master song’s friend?

If he had such a powerful relationship, why would he bother to ask a small section Chief like him to do things?

God, are you playing with me?

He kun, Xue Jinshan, Zhou Qing, and Bai He also had interesting expressions on their faces.

Originally, he was at the end of his rope and thought that he had walked into a dead end. He did not expect that after seeing the light at the end of the tunnel, his eyes suddenly opened up again.

As expected of someone that Secretary Tian valued so much! His connections were really deep!

Xue Jinshan and the other two were naturally full of admiration for their boss. They looked at Xia ruofei with eyes full of wonder.

At this time, fourth brother came back to his senses and quickly said,””Young master Song, so this gentleman is your friend! This is like a flood washing over the temple of the Dragon King ...”

Song Rui’s face turned cold after he was done with the small talk with Xia ruofei. He asked indifferently,””What’s going on?”

The three people of Qi Min’s body trembled at the same time, and they stammered, not knowing what to say.

Fourth brother frowned and scolded,”little Qi, I think you’re regressing!” Can’t you even speak properly? What are you doing?”

At this moment, he kun’s eyes rolled a few times. He gritted his teeth and said,”President Xia, how about ... I report the situation to our two distinguished guests?”

He kun decided to go all out. He had already offended Qi Min and his men. Not to mention young master Song, his fourth brother was probably someone with great power in the drug Control system. After weighing the pros and cons, he kun quickly made a decision.

Fourth brother gave Xia ruofei a questioning look.

“Let me introduce you. This is he kun, the Deputy Director of the Food and Drug Administration of the southeast province,” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Fourth brother also showed a warm smile and said,””It’s bureau chief he! I’ve even heard my father praise you! He said that the Southeast’s Deputy bureau chief he is an academic – Type leader and has a wide path of development in the future!”

Fourth brother saw he kun’s confused expression and said,””Oh, my father’s name is Zeng ke Wen.”

He kun immediately looked surprised. He quickly came forward and said,””So you’re the young master of chief CEng! Nice to meet you! I don’t deserve such praise from director CEng. ”

“Brother he,” Xia ruofei said,”tell song Rui and young master Zeng what happened just now!”

Qi Min and the others ‘faces instantly turned ashen. They looked at he kun as if they had lost their parents, and their eyes were pleading. However, he kun, who had been holding back his anger for a long time, did not care so much. He immediately began to explain the whole story.

[PS: fever starts in the afternoon and evening. I can only hurry up and write. The more I drag it out, the less I feel like it. My whole body is dizzy and my throat doesn’t hurt. It’s already the third day. It’s so uncomfortable. Sigh!
