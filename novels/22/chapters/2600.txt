2601 Heavy mountains and heavy waters recover (2)

If he didn’t have this level of skill, old man Liu wouldn’t have been able to develop to that level. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Xia ruofei went into the medium to make some medicine. This time, he did not make pills. Instead, he made a semi – liquid medicinal soup and packed it in a vacuum Chinese medicine bag.

Of course, this medicinal soup was essentially no different from the previous pills. The main ingredient was the petals of the spirit Heart Flower, but the proportion of the petals was lower this time.

Then, he took out a thermal container and asked Xia Xiaolan to get some ice from the kitchen. He put the bags of Chinese medicine and ice into the thermal container.

After settling all these matters, Xia ruofei returned to his own house to rest for a while. After Wu Qiang had sent Song Wei back from Capital University, he asked Wu Qiang to drive him to the Liu family’s house.

……

In the courtyard where old man Liu was recuperating, Liu Qunfeng was extremely anxious.

These days, he basically didn’t go to the office. Some urgent business affairs were sent here by his Secretary to deal with.

Liu Qunfeng had been suffering from severe insomnia for the past few days. He didn’t even sleep more than three hours a day, but he didn’t receive any good news.

The Liu family had sent out all their forces and used all the channels they could find according to the list given by Xia ruofei. However, the news came back one by one, and the result disappointed and even made him desperate.

Today, Liu Chongli came to this house, but he still brought bad news.

“Uncle Chongli, any progress?” Liu Qunfeng asked as soon as he saw Liu Chongli.

Liu Chongli shook his head helplessly and said,””There’s not even a single piece of useful information. Qunfeng, I’ve consulted the experts and professors at the Chinese Medicine Research Institute, but they’ve never heard of the names of those herbs! How are we supposed to find him?”

“I don’t have a single clue either!” Liu Qunfeng said with a bitter smile.

Then, Liu Qunfeng couldn’t help but say angrily,”Liu Lifang is stupider than a pig! Ever since he was young, he had always been a failure! This time, he had even caused such a great disaster! I really want to ...”

“Qunfeng, it’s too late to say all this now ...” Liu Chongli said.”After all, Lifang is your sister. I heard that you’ve been keeping her under house arrest in the main residence for the past two days, not even letting her out of her room. Could this be ...”

“Uncle Chongli! It’s because she’s my sister that I’m being merciful!” Liu Qunfeng gritted his teeth and said,”if it were anyone else, I would have turned her into ashes! You don’t have to plead for her! What’s wrong with locking her up for a few days? Would he lose a piece of skin or a piece of flesh? His father was still on the verge of death! It’s all her fault!”

Liu Chongli only spoke up for Liu Lifang because he and Liu Lifang both worked in the family’s company. After all, even though Liu Lifang’s ability was very poor, as the biological daughter of old man Liu, this identity was still very useful. Liu Chongli also took advantage of this to continuously strengthen his voice in the company.

After all, Liu Chongli was only elder Liu’s cousin, so their relationship was still a level apart.

This time, Liu Lifang would probably be stripped of all her positions. Thinking of this, Liu Chongli still felt that it was a pity. If old master Liu’s team was replaced with someone more capable, his influence in the company would inevitably be weakened.

Of course, Liu Chongli wouldn’t stupidly plead on Liu Lifang’s behalf at this time. He could just play a side trick at the right time, just like what he did just now.

Liu Chongli took the initiative to change the topic and asked,”QUN FENG, how’s big brother’s current situation?”

Liu Qunfeng said with a hint of fatigue,””Her condition has been stable for the past two days, but the experts in Room 301 said that this situation will not continue for long and told us to be mentally prepared ... This is in line with Mr. Xia’s conclusion.”

When Liu Chongli heard this, he couldn’t help but frown and say,”Qunfeng, do you think ... That Xia ruofei ... Gave us a fake list? If we can’t find all the herbs on it, he can just give up and not care about us ...”

“The possibility is very low.” “From what I know of Mr. Xia, he’s not that kind of person,” Liu Qunfeng said.

“But,” Liu Chongli said anxiously,”even the authoritative experts of the Chinese Medicine Research Institute don’t know about the herbs on the list. They’ve never even heard of them. Don’t you think that’s too suspicious?”

“Mr. Xia is an expert,” Liu Qunfeng said. “Just because those experts and professors have never heard of them doesn’t mean they don’t exist.” Because he didn’t need to do that. If he really wanted to leave, he wouldn’t need to go through so much trouble. This incident was caused by Liu Lifang. If he didn’t want to treat her, he could have just rejected her directly. Why did he have to go in such a big circle?”

“That’s true, but who knows what he’s thinking ...” Liu Chongli said without much confidence.

In fact, he had already accepted Liu Qunfeng’s analysis. However, he had been trying his best for the past two days, but there had been no progress. He couldn’t help but doubt it, and his heart was quite conflicted.

Suddenly, Liu Qunfeng’s phone vibrated.

“Uncle Chongli, I have to answer a call first,” he stood up and said.

Liu Qunfeng picked up his phone as he walked out,””Hey...It’s me...MMM...MMM...I know!”

The content of the phone call seemed simple. Liu Qunfeng hung up after a few words.

He turned around and walked into the room. He looked at Liu Chongli with a strange expression and said,”Uncle Chongli, I’ve just received some information regarding the medicinal herbs on the list.”

Liu Chongli immediately stood up and asked,””Someone found it?”

“It doesn’t count as us finding it ... But this information is indeed more important.” Liu Qunfeng said,”our people just found out that three years ago, at an underground auction in Malaysia, a medicinal herb called ‘Sky Heart Vine’ appeared. It is at least 90% similar to the ‘Amethyst blood radish’ that Mr. Xia described in the list. It should be the same medicinal herb!”

When Xia ruofei was making the list, he did not just write down the names of the herbs. Otherwise, the Liu family would not be able to find them. Hence, he also used words to describe each herb and even drew simple illustrations.

Because of this, the Liu family realized that the “sky’s will parasite” that was auctioned in Malaysia three years ago was most likely the “Amethyst blood radish” that Xia ruofei had listed.

“Is that so?” Liu Chongli’s spirits were lifted.”Then let’s hurry up and think of a way to buy it!”

No matter how hard they tried and how many resources they used, the results they got were all disappointing. It could be said that the news that Liu Qunfeng had just brought was the only good news in the past two days.

Although there were more than a dozen herbs on the list, and it was useless to just find the “Amethyst blood radish,” he was still one step closer to success.

“Uncle Chongli, do you know how much this ‘sky’s will Gu’ was sold for back then?” Liu Qunfeng asked with a bitter smile.

“How much?” Liu Chongli asked subconsciously.
