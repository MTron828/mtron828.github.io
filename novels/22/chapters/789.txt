Chapter 790: Sharpening the knife (3)

Lei Hu nodded in agreement.

“Oh right, what happened to Xue Fei that day?” Xia ruofei asked.

Lei Hu couldn’t help but look at Xia ruofei through the rearview mirror and said,””Xue Fei, Hu Lili, and their two friends were all seriously stung by the Hornet that night. They are still lying in the hospital! For the time being, he didn’t have the time to play any tricks! Although their lives weren’t in danger, they had suffered quite a lot. For example, Xue Fei ... Had been bitten in a vital part, and the swelling was still not reduced! I don’t know if it will affect the function in that area after the treatment ...”

Xia ruofei suddenly received a call that day to go to the General Hospital to meet Guo Zhan. Hence, he arranged for Lei Hu to send people to keep an eye on Xue Fei and the others, to keep track of their movements.

Lei Hu was in awe of Xia ruofei’s superb skills. He had even used the Hornet.

Although the nightclub said that it was a Hornet that flew in from outside and its source was unknown, Lei Hu was very clear that this matter must be related to Xia ruofei. Otherwise, how could it be so coincidental that it stung the four people who wanted to harm Lin Qiao? and Xue Fei’s condition was the most serious?

Of course, Lei Hu was also a soldier. He knew what to ask and what not to ask. On this kind of question, he was very smart to keep his mouth shut and would not discuss anything with his brothers.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but smile after hearing this.

That day, he had really used his mental power to control a Hornet to sting the place where Xue Fei was.

This wasn’t because he had a bad taste, but because he really hated Xue Fei. He actually dared to have such thoughts about Lin Qiao, so he had to let his “tool” who had failed to commit a crime receive a small lesson.

“Is there any other news?” Xia ruofei asked.

Lei Hu knew what Xia ruofei was asking and smiled bitterly.””Brother Xia, we haven’t made any progress in our investigation on Xue Fei’s father, Xue Zhengbang. After all, he’s the Deputy Mayor ...”

“Hu, you don’t have to explain. I understand.” Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand.”You don’t have to worry about Xue Zhengbang, but keep an eye on Xue Fei. He’s a time bomb. I won’t be at ease until he’s removed ...”

......

“Understood!” Lei Hu replied crisply.

Xia ruofei nodded and did not ask any more questions. He leaned back in his seat and closed his eyes to rest.

He had been thinking about Xue Fei’s case. He had to investigate Xue Zhengbang. Unless this Deputy Mayor was really an official like Bao Qingtian, he could easily beat Xue Fei down. Then, he wouldn’t have to worry about Lin Qiao’s safety.

Soon, the car returned to the farm. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei carried his bag and walked into the house. Lin Qiao was sitting on the sofa and fiddling with her laptop. She had been self – studying graphic design software recently and was very enthusiastic. She even wanted to hold her laptop while eating.

Seeing Xia ruofei return, Lin Qiao was very happy. She quickly put her laptop aside and shouted,””Brother ruofei, you’re back!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””Yup! Have you been obedient these few days? You didn’t run around, did you?”

“No, I didn ‘t! The farm is so remote, the farmland is right outside, where can i run to?” Lin Qiao pouted and said,”you didn’t even bring me along when you went on a business trip ...”

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”you said you were on a business trip. Where would you find the time to play?” I’m dying of exhaustion ...”

“Oh! Then you should go upstairs and rest!” Lin Qiao said,”do you want me to go up and help you fill the tub? Take a bath to relieve your fatigue!”

Xia ruofei quickly said,”no need, no need. How can I let my little princess do such menial work?” I’ll do it myself, you can continue to study!”

Lin Qiao stuck out her tongue at Xia ruofei and smiled sweetly.

“Has Godma returned to her room?” Xia ruofei asked.

“Yes, she always sleeps early!” Lin Qiao said.

“Alright, I won’t disturb her anymore. We’ll talk about it tomorrow!” Xia ruofei said,”I’m going back to my room. Qiao’ er, you should rest early too!”

“I know!”

Xia ruofei carried his bag and went upstairs. When he returned to his room, he did not rush to take a shower. Instead, he lit a cigarette and went to the balcony. Then, he took out his phone.

He had been thinking about Xue Zhengbang’s matter on the way here, and in the end, he decided to give Niu Tao a call to see if he could help him.

Although Niu Tao had been transferred to the provincial Military District, the nature of his work was special. He was in charge of some retired members of special combat units. At the same time, he was also in charge of coordinating and contacting some special departments. So, if Niu Tao was willing to help, Xue Zhengbang could still find out a lot of things in secret, even if he was the Deputy Mayor of Sanshan city.

However, this was a serious violation of his principles. Xia ruofei was not sure if Niu Tao would help him.

After thinking for a while, Xia ruofei decided to give it a try.

Niu Tao’s call went through very quickly.”Ruofei, you’re back?”

“Yup!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Fire Wolf, I hope I didn’t disturb your rest.”

“I don’t sleep so early! “I’ve been so busy recently ...” Niu Tao smiled and said,”well ... How’s your mission?”

Xia ruofei’s mission was top secret, so Niu Tao was more cautious. He only asked carefully.

“I didn’t fail you!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”if you’ve suddenly become busy these few days because of the East China Sea, then you’re probably cleaning up the mess for us.”

Although the lone wolf assault team had annihilated the Japanese special agents, rescued professor Liang Qiming, and obtained the core experimental data, there was still a lot of follow – up work left after they left the three mountains.

For example, how did these Wei nation people sneak into Huaxia, did they have any spies in Huaxia, how the matter of Liang Qiming’s laboratory in Sanshan University was leaked, and so on.

This required a special department to investigate, and Niu Tao happened to be in charge of this.

Niu Tao couldn’t help but exclaim,”F * ck! So it was to clean up the mess for you! F * ck, I’ll get the wolf King to treat me to a drink next time!”

“Remember to call me when you drink!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”Fire Wolf, let’s cut the chit – chat. I’m looking for you today ... Because I need your help with something. It might be a little troublesome. If you feel that it’s difficult, you don’t have to be polite. Just tell me.”

“So formal?” Niu Tao said,”speak! What’s the matter?”

Xia ruofei didn’t try to hide anything and said directly,””Huo lang, I want to investigate the situation of a Deputy Mayor of Sanshan city. His name is Xue Zhengbang, and he’s in charge of science, education, Culture, and health. I know that this is against the principles and the risk is quite high, so you don’t have to care about the situation. If you can help, then help. If you can ‘t, just tell me directly and I’ll think of another way. ”
