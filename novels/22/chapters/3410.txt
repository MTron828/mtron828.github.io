Chapter 3411: Finishing everything in one battle.i

Translator: 549690339

Before the goldthread nether snake could react, the shrill sound of something breaking through the air could be heard.

Hundreds of spatial wind blades suddenly appeared in this small space, so dense that they almost filled the entire space.

The goldthread nether snake’s mind trembled as it looked at the spatial wind blades. It was stunned for a moment because it didn’t know how to dodge them.

In the blink of an eye, several spatial wind blades had struck the snake’s body, causing its scales to fly and its skin to split open.

The golden thread nether snake let out a violent hiss. Its huge body writhed wildly, and it charged toward the dimensional membrane without any regard for anything else.

It had already realized that it was at the end of the road. The spatial cracks that had appeared silently had already made it very difficult to cope with. The appearance of the spatial wind blades had made the situation worse. At this moment, it could not care so much. There was only one thought in its mind, and that was to leave this place at all costs. Even if it was badly injured, it was better than being cut into pieces by the spatial wind blades.

After the goldthread nether snake let down its guard, the damage it received was naturally even greater.

In just a few breaths of time, dozens of spatial wind blades hit its body. In addition, it was very unlucky to hit its head directly into a dark spatial crack. The spatial crack had torn a terrible hole in the snake’s belly, and even its internal organs were exposed.

The golden thread nether snake was no longer as imposing as it was when it was chasing after Xia ruofei. Its body was covered in wounds of various sizes and was dripping with blood. It looked extremely miserable.

The goldthread nether snake’s eyes were filled with despair as it struggled to break free from the spatial cage. It was still trapped in another spatial cage. The density of the wind blades and spatial cracks in this spatial cage was much higher than the previous one.

The goldthread nether snake dodged with all its might, but the spatial wind blades still hit it.

The black spatial rifts that appeared randomly were even more difficult to guard against. Every time it hit a spatial Rift, or the spatial Rift appeared directly beside it, it would receive heavy damage.

No matter how strong the goldthread nether snake’s recovery ability was, it would not be able to recover from such a continuous and concentrated attack.

It felt that its body was getting heavier and heavier. Because of its injuries and blood loss, its ability to move continued to decline, and even its consciousness began to blur.

The goldthread nether snake let out an unwilling roar.

It was indeed very unwilling to give up. At first, when Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue appeared in front of it, they were just two weak little fellows who had delivered themselves to its door. However, the situation took a sharp turn. It did not even manage to touch Xia ruofei’s hair, let alone a direct confrontation. It was directly trapped in this terrifying Space Array. Then, in a very short time, it was injured one after another. Now, it was almost in complete despair.

The nine turn space splitting formation’s attack continued for more than ten minutes. The goldthread nether snake’s extremely tough body was finally at its limits.

Its huge body was curled up into a coil, and its triangular head was trying its best to raise up, but it drooped down again and again under the continuous attack of the spatial wind blades.

In the end, a pitch – Black spatial crack silently appeared on the snake’s head.

The snake’s consciousness was starting to blur. How could it Dodge? The spatial crack tore the snake’s head apart, revealing the bones beneath its skin.

The location of the tear was exactly seven inches away from the three golden threads.

This was the snake’s weakest and most fatal spot.

The goldthread nether snake’s body trembled, and its head rose. Then, life began to drain from its emotionless eyes, and its head dropped.

The goldthread nether snake’s massive body twitched a few times, and then it became completely silent.

Outside the nine turn space – splitting formation, Xia ruofei was naturally paying close attention to goldthread nether snake’s condition. He immediately realized that the fatal attack had been completed.

However, Xia ruofei did not dare to let his guard down. He was worried that the goldthread nether snake might have faked its death!

So he continued to control the formation, using the spatial wind blades to attack the goldthread nether snake. The random spatial cracks would occasionally appear on the snake’s body, and naturally, they would quickly leave wounds of various sizes on it.

Even after receiving such an injury, the goldthread nether snake’s body remained motionless.

Only then did Xia ruofei relax a little. He knew that if the goldthread nether snake had faked its death, it would not have been able to stay still under that attack. Even if it was a conditioned reflex, it would have moved.

The fact that the goldthread nether snake wasn’t moving at all could only mean one thing – it was completely dead.

Xia ruofei heaved a long sigh of relief. He made a hand seal and stopped the attack of the array.

However, he did not immediately go over to remove the array. Instead, he stood quietly outside the array, feeling as if he was in a dream. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

A venomous golden thread nether snake at the peak of the late golden core stage had been killed by him just like that? Xia ruofei felt a strong sense of surrealism..
