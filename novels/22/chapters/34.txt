Xia Ruofei thought for a moment and said.

“There are about six new vegetable types available now, including romaine lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, water spinach, spinach, and eggplants. They are all common varieties on the market, but their quality is definitely much higher.”

“In the early stages, 10 kilogram of each vegetable type can be supplied a day. After a week, 25 kilograms a day shouldn’t be a problem. After a month, we can supply 50 kilograms a day.”

Xia Ruofei had only started planting these vegetables because he wanted to keep them for himself to eat. However, because the vegetables in the spiritual space were growing too quickly, there were already a lot in excess.

Now that he was prepared to progress in this area, Xia Ruofei naturally wanted to expand the planting area. With the production speed of the spiritual map space, 50 kilograms a day was no pressure at all.

Of course, there was only so much land in the space, and some had to be reserved for the succulents. Therefore, the only way to continue to increase production was to plant them in the outside world. However, if he planted them in the outside world, he had to rent land and hire people. Moreover, the issue of maintaining the quality of the vegetables was also a problem.

However, Xia Ruofei did not have the energy to worry about these and would leave it for the future.

When Ling Qingxue heard this number, she pondered for a moment before nodding.

“It’s not a lot, but it should be enough to solve our immediate problem.”

50 kilograms a day seemed like a lot, but Ling Ji’s Restaurant was a large chain of restaurants. There were more than ten stores in the Three Mountains City alone. 50 kilograms of vegetables were like a pebble thrown into the sea. It would not cause any ripple at all.

However, it was enough to gather popularity and as a limited supply in the stores of a few central areas.

Ling Qingxue continued. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Ruofei, in terms of price… If the spinach and eggplant are 50 yuan per 500 grams, and the rest are 30 yuan per 500 grams, do you think it’s okay?”

This price was at least ten times the market price. Ling Qingxue was really full of sincerity.

Xia Ruofei nodded almost without hesitation.

“Deal!”

Since he had decided to launch these vegetables to the market, he was naturally going to take the high-quality route. Besides, he also felt that his “super vegetables” were completely worth this price.

Ling Qingxue said happily.

“I hope we work well together! By the way, when can you start supplying the vegetables?”

Xia Ruofei thought for a moment and said.

“In three days! I’ll give you an address then. Just send someone to pick up the groceries every day.”

Since they were going to work together for a long time, Xia Ruofei definitely needed to rent another place. This rental house lived too many people and Xia Ruofei could not possibly supply the vegetables here every day. If he only went out and stayed inside for a long time, it would definitely attract attention.

“Alright, I’ll go back and draft a contract now. Let’s sign it in two days!” Ling Qingxue said. She seemed a little too eager.

Xia Ruofei asked half-jokingly.

“What’s the hurry? Aren’t you going to sit a little longer?”

Ling Qingxue immediately glanced at Xia Ruofei flirtatiously and asked.

‘Would you like me to stay longer?’

Xia Ruofei hurriedly said.

“Er… business is more important, more important…”

Seeing this, Ling Qingxue burst out laughing and rolled her eyes at him.

“Coward! I’m leaving! I’ll look for you to sign the contract tomorrow. Don’t vanish somewhere again!”

“I’ll send you out!” Xia Ruofei said with relief.

After sending Ling Qingxue off, Xia Ruofei tidied up the cutlery and sat in front of the computer. He had always been concerned about the situation of the online shop. He had put all the goods on sale yesterday, and he could not wait to see if there was any business.

Opening the Taobao seller’s platform, Xia Ruofei was instantly disappointed.

It was empty. There was not a single purchase record. There were even very few people browsing.

A wry smile crossed Xia Ruofei’s face. ‘It seems I’ve been too idealistic.’

In fact, when he thought about it, this situation was normal. It was just a new online store with no credit history or transaction history, and no paid promotion. Besides, it sold very few products and every one was so expensive. Even if someone happened to click in, they would probably quickly click on the the red cross in the upper right corner.

Xia Ruofei frowned slightly and sat in front of the computer, thinking.

It was probably not a good idea to wait like this. He had to think of something.

The first thing Xia Ruofei thought of was to spend money to promote on Taobao.

However, he quickly rejected this idea. Not only would it cost a lot of money, but the effect would also be difficult to guarantee. The reason was as mentioned previously, the credit and transaction records of the store were zero. Moreover, the price was so expensive that most people would not believe it easily.

Moreover, Xia Ruofei had originally planned to take the high-quality route and not care about the sales volume, so there was not much point in doing a paid promotion.

After thinking about it, there was only one way. That was to first make a name for himself in the succulents’ social circle. Xia Ruofei’s target client was originally a small group of high-end users in the succulents’ circle.

At the thought of this, Xia Ruofei immediately thought of Liang Qichao. This buddy was a rich second-generation heir, and he ran his Immortal Succulent Store. He should have many connections in the succulent plant industry. Xia Ruofei definitely had to ask him for help.

With his mind made up, Xia Ruofei immediately picked up his phone and called Liang Qichao.

“Ruofei! Is there some supreme-grade succulent that you want to sell?” Liang Qichao asked impatiently as soon as he picked up the phone.

Xia Ruofei chuckled and said.

“Brother Liang, that supreme-grade Ice Lantern last time was hard to come by. How can it be so easy to get? However… I do have some good things on hand…”

Liang Qichao said quickly.

“Brother, don’t keep me in suspense. Tell me! What is it?”

Xia Ruofei said.

“Brother Liang, a friend of mine has cultivated some very good succulent seedlings. I wonder if you’re interested?”

“Seedlings?” Liang Qichao was slightly disappointed, but when he thought of the extremely stunning supreme-grade Ice Lantern Jade Dew that Xia Ruofei had brought last time, he felt that since Xia Ruofei recommended it, the quality must not be bad.

So he said quickly.

“I’m interested! Where’s your friend, Little Xia? Can I see the goods now?”

Xia Ruofei smiled and said.

“Brother Liang, my friend has an online store. I’ll send you the website address after I hang up. You’ll know when you go there and take a look.”

At this point, Xia Ruofei thought for a moment and added.

“That online store may have just opened, but there’s absolutely nothing wrong with it. I verified it myself.”

“Alright, send me the website address!” Liang Qichao said readily.

After hanging up, Xia Ruofei sent the website to Liang Qichao.

Less than five minutes later, Liang Qichao called. As soon as Xia Ruofei picked up, he heard Liang Qichao’s excited voice.

“Damn… Little Xia, your friend is too awesome! He… Where did he get so many rare supreme-grade succulent seedlings… I can’t believe my eyes! White-skinned Moon Realm, Blooming Cages, Jade Fans and Myriad Elephant… They’re all mutated rare species! If you didn’t guarantee it yourself, I would definitely think that the shop owner is a scammer!”
