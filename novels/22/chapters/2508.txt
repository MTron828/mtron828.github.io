2509 Rapid recovery (2)

Wu Lei had just finished his surgery, and the anesthetic had worn off, so his wound would definitely hurt. As professional athletes, they had to use as little anesthetic and painkiller drugs as possible, so they could only endure the pain.

Wu Lei immediately felt the effects as soon as the ointment was applied. The effect was immediate. He had been a little uncertain at first, but now he was confident.

After Xia ruofei finished applying the ointment on Wu Lei, he took off the disposable gloves and threw them into the trash can. Then, he closed the container for the ointment and stood up to put the ointment in the refrigerator.

Then he told Wu Lei,”change the medicine once a day. With the help of acupuncture, the wound and ligament will heal within a week. I guarantee that you will be able to resume training with the ball!”

Xia ruofei had assessed Wu Lei’s condition before. He added a good amount of the spirit Heart Flower petal solution after brewing the ointment to ensure that Wu Lei would recover completely.

And this ointment was enough to last for about six days.

“President Xia, I’ve troubled you so much!” Wu Lei said with a touched expression.

Xia ruofei was a shareholder of the club and had a big business in the country. Now that he had to spend so much time to help him recover, he was naturally touched.

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”you’re now the club ‘s’ high – Quality asset ‘!” I’m helping myself by helping you! You don’t have to be nervous. As long as you have the right technique and the right acupuncture points, you won’t feel any pain. You might feel sore, swollen, or numb, but you won’t feel any pain!”

“It’s fine even if it hurts. I can take it!” Wu Lei grinned.

Xia ruofei nodded.”You managed to finish the Asian Cup with a dislocated shoulder joint. You even wanted to finish more than ten rounds of La Liga before the surgery. I don’t doubt your willpower at all!”

Wu Lei was embarrassed by Xia ruofei’s compliment and laughed.

Xia ruofei took out a whole set of silver needles from the first aid kit. He opened the bag containing the silver needles and laid it flat on the bedside table.

Then, while he was chatting with Wu Lei, he suddenly and quickly inserted the silver needles into the acupuncture points near the shoulder and neck. In the blink of an eye, nine silver needles were accurately inserted into the acupuncture points, and the ends of the needles were still trembling slightly.

Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”what do you think?” It doesn’t hurt, right?”

Wu Lei raised his eyebrows and asked in surprise,””You’re done?”

Xia ruofei said,”I’m done!” However, the acupuncture has only just begun, and the process will take about 15 minutes. If you feel any discomfort during this time, you must let me know immediately. ”

“Alright, I got it!” Wu Lei nodded and said.

Then, Xia ruofei used the nine needles of cloud contact technique to continuously twist the silver needle. At the same time, wisps of genuine Qi slowly stimulated the acupuncture points through the silver needle.

Wu Lei immediately felt a warm feeling at the spot where the needle was inserted, and this warmth spread from the acupuncture point. It was as if he was soaking in a hot spring near his neck and shoulders, which was quite comfortable.

Xia ruofei could perform the nine cloud contact needles with ease. He had time to chat with Wu Lei while performing the acupuncture. They talked about Wu Lei’s performance in the domestic clubs in the past few seasons and how he had embarked on the path of professional football when he was young. The two of them had a great time.

If Xia ruofei’s physician brother Ge Jun were to see this scene, he would definitely be shocked. The nine needles of moyun was very complicated and difficult to perform. Even experienced Chinese physicians needed to be fully focused. Xia ruofei was able to do it as if it was light and was even able to divert his attention to chat with the patient. It was beyond ordinary knowledge.

After the acupuncture session, Xia ruofei helped Wu Lei to fix the band on his shoulder. He said,””Try not to move for the next two to three days, and don’t eat spicy food.”

Wu Lei felt that the acupuncture process was too comfortable. Even after Xia ruofei had withdrawn the needles, he still felt that it was not enough.

“Okay, President Xia, I’ll definitely follow the doctor’s advice!” Wu Lei smiled and said,”your medical skills are amazing! Whether it’s the ointment or the acupuncture, they’re the best I’ve ever seen!”

“You’ve seen many Chinese medicine doctors?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

“Of course! Which football player doesn’t get injured?” Wu Lei said,”when I was in China, most of the physiotherapists in the team were Chinese medicine practitioners. They also knew how to massage and acupuncture, but they didn’t have the effect of the acupuncture you gave me!” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“It’s my honor to be praised by Ball King Wu!”Xia ruofei laughed.

“President Xia, please don’t ridicule me ...” Wu Lei said with a bitter smile.

“Hahaha! The club has arranged a nurse for you. If you need anything else, just tell the translator, or you can just send me a WeChat message!” Xia ruofei stood up and said.

“Alright! President Xia, thank you again!” Wu Lei said.

Xia ruofei waved his hand as he packed up the silver needles and the first aid kit. “You’re welcome, but ... Please keep my treatment a secret. I don’t like trouble, and I don’t want everyone to know about it. ”

“I will! Even if my wife asks, I won’t tell her!” Wu Lei said.

Xia ruofei laughed.”That’s not necessarily the case. Just don’t go around telling everyone.”

Wu Lei was well known for being good to his wife and children. He seemed to be happy to be a ‘wife slave’ and was happy all day. It wasn’t easy for him to say something that he wouldn’t even tell his wife.

Xia ruofei left Wu Lei’s room and went to the living room. He told the translator and the nurse to take good care of Wu Lei before he went back to his room.

For the next few days, Xia ruofei would change his medicine and perform acupuncture on him every morning. Then, he would tour Barcelona alone in the afternoon. Dong Yun and the others had already left Barcelona, and Zhou leiyun had arranged for someone to accompany them to tour other cities in Spain.

Five days passed in a flash.

Wu Lei had been able to get out of bed two days ago. He had spontaneously started some lower body strength training. On the one hand, it was to maintain his condition. On the other hand, he was really on the verge of collapse from lying down.

After Xia ruofei finished the acupuncture for Wu Lei, he said,””You can remove the fixation on your shoulder. Just cover the ointment with ordinary gauze!”

“So ... I can train with the ball?” Wu Lei asked in surprise.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”that’s right!” However, don’t be too strong at the start. ”

In fact, Wu Lei’s injuries had basically recovered, including minor injuries in other parts of his body. However, athletes who had been injured would more or less have some trauma, so they would be particularly careful about the injured parts.

If they could not overcome the psychological barrier, they would naturally not dare to play against each other in the game. Many players could not recover to their former state after being seriously injured. Physical functions were one aspect, but psychological factors also accounted for a large proportion.

“I’ll go to the club now! Also, let the team doctor examine me again. ” Wu Lei said impatiently, then explained,”I can only resume training with the permission of the team doctor!”

Espanyol was already preparing for the home game against valekano in three days.

In La Liga last weekend, Espanyol scored 2:2 thrilling draws with Villarreal and 1 point in the away game. This was already a very satisfactory result for the current Spanish team.

They were facing valekano on the weekend. The opponent’s strength was average, and the Spanish team was playing on their home ground, so their goal was naturally to win.

Wu Lei was also eager to play in this game, so he hoped to join the pre – Match preparations as soon as possible.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”no problem!” You can go and check it again so that you can be at ease!”

So, Wu Lei went to the Spanish club with the interpreter.

When the team doctor saw Wu Lei, his eyes almost fell out of their sockets. He thought that Wu Lei should be recuperating in bed at the moment. How could he be running back to the club so fast?
