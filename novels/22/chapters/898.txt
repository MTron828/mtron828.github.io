Translator: 549690339

Mr. Lin and Dr. Huang were stunned for a few seconds before they pounced over at the same time. They grabbed the small plastic box and carefully took out a few Cordyceps sinensis for a closer look.

Especially doctor Huang, who was wearing reading glasses. His hands trembled slightly as he repeatedly observed the wormgrass in his hand. In the end, he even put it under his nose and sniffed it deeply. He couldn’t help but show an intoxicated look.

Xia ruofei sat down on the office chair behind the office desk and looked at the two with a faint smile on his face.

Mr. Lin’s and Dr. Xia’s reactions were within Xia ruofei’s expectations. He had a basic idea of where the Cordyceps that was produced in the realm was.

After a while, Mr. Lin and Dr. Huang put the wormgrass back into the plastic box. They looked at each other and Mr. Lin finally said,””Brother Xia, you’ve given me a big surprise ... No, it’s a shock! This product of yours is really too scary ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”Mr. Lin, if these were just ordinary herbs, Tongren Hall wouldn’t be interested in them!” How was it? My samples are good enough for you, right?”

President Lin smiled bitterly and said,”brother Xia!” What you said is like a slap in the face ... I’ve been in the business for so many years and have seen a lot of precious herbs, but this is the first time I’ve seen such a top quality wormgrass. ”

Dr. Huang added,”what’s more, the quality of this batch of wormgrass is very average. None of them are small. This means that the overall quality is very high!”

“Yes, yes!” President Lin asked with hope,”brother Xia, has the same quality wormgrass been mass – produced?”

Xia ruofei smiled noncommittally. He did not answer President Lin’s question directly but asked,””President Lin, Dr. Huang, based on your experience, what is the market price of aweto of this quality?”

President Lin smiled bitterly and said,”brother Xia, you’ve really given me a difficult problem!” Elder Huang, you talk to President Xia!”

Dr. Huang took off her reading glasses and said,”Mr. Xia, the current market price is like this. There are about 2000 pieces of level – one grass per kilogram. Depending on the quality, the price is between 300000 and 350000. However, the specifications of your batch of wormgrass are comparable to level – one grass ...”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”I’ve weighed them after they were made into dried grass. There are about 1200 pieces per kilogram.”

Even though the experienced director Lin and doctor Huang had a rough idea after seeing the wormgrass, they still couldn’t help but exclaim when Xia ruofei confirmed it.

Dr. Huang thought for a moment and said,”Mr. Xia, the price of special grade wormgrass ranges from 400000 to 500000, but the largest one I’ve seen is only 1500 wormgrass per kilogram. Yours has 1200 wormgrass, and the quality is very pure. I believe the medicinal analysis results must be quite good. It’s not easy to judge the price ...”

“Brother Xia,” President Lin said,”I personally feel that ... This grade of wormgrass is priced at six to seven hundred thousand Yuan per kilogram. There will definitely be rich people fighting to buy it!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Okay. With Mr. Lin and Dr. Huang’s judgment, I have a rough idea. Thank you!” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Then, Xia ruofei laughed and said,””Come, come, come, have some tea. I’ve already asked the restaurant to prepare dinner. Let’s have a few cups of tea tonight!”

Xia ruofei picked up the plastic lid of the small plastic tidying box and was ready to put the worm grass away.

“Brother Xia, wait!” President Lin called out after a moment of hesitation.

Xia ruofei stopped and asked in confusion,””Is there anything else, President Lin?”

President Lin smiled a little embarrassedly and said,””Brother Xia, these ... Samples, can you ... Can you sell them to our Tongren Hall?”

Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows in surprise and smiled.””There’s only about 500 grams in total. You’re willing to accept such a small amount?”

“It’s a dereliction of my duty as a manager if I don’t take such good wormgrass to Tongren Hall!” President Lin said half – jokingly,”brother Xia, you can’t be reluctant, right?”

In fact, when he saw these aweto, President Lin already had the intention to buy them.

As he had said, it was the first time he had seen such high – Quality wormgrass in his many years of business. Although there was not a large amount, it could be used as the shop’s signature.

These wormgrass, through exquisite packaging, could be made into at least 10 to 20 gift boxes. If they were placed in an eye – catching position in Qiantang Tongren Hall, it would be a symbol of the company’s strength!

Xia ruofei waved his hand indifferently and said,””What’s there to be reluctant about? I just thought that the business was too small and I thought that President Lin wouldn’t be interested! Since you want it, I’ll sell it to you!”

“That’s great!”President Lin was overjoyed. Thank you, brother Xia! After we take this batch of wormgrass back, we’ll take one or two samples and send them to the authorities to test the medicinal properties. This way, when you can supply them in bulk in the future, you’ll have a more specific reference standard for pricing. ”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”sure, thank you, CEO Lin.”

“It’s no trouble, not at all!”President Lin quickly said.
