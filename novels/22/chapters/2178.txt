2179 A smooth return (1)

Xia ruofei had been delayed at green Immortal Island for a few days and had sailed on the sea for a few more days. He wanted to get back as soon as possible. After all, that yacht was only suitable for sailing in the coastal waters. If he went out to sea for more than ten days and did not return, his family would be worried.

Therefore, he didn’t stay in Persia for a long time. He hurriedly met with Tang Yitian’s family and immediately set off on his return journey.

Tang Yitian’s private jet was already ready at the airport. The flight route had been applied for two days ago. It was to fly directly from Porter to the three mountains of China.

Xia ruofei got a full set of identity documents, which were all real and effective. Tang Yitian still had a lot of power in Australia.

He quickly passed through the customs security check in the business aircraft building and went directly to the tarmac.

The biggest advantage of a private jet was that time was relatively free. Although the route was planned in advance, it could still be adjusted according to the passenger’s situation.

After Xia ruofei boarded the plane, the crew was quickly approved to leave.

In less than ten minutes, the plane had already taxied off on the runway.

Such efficiency was impossible to achieve by taking a civilian flight.

After more than ten hours of flight, Xia ruofei finally returned to the three mountains.

The flight crew would rest for a day in San Shan and return to Sydney, Australia the next day.

Xia ruofei, on the other hand, used ‘Tang Fei’ as an Australian – Chinese to handle the immigration procedures.

As he did not return using his own identity, Xia ruofei naturally could not ask the company to arrange for a car to pick him up. After he left the airport, he took a taxi and arrived at the Shangri – La hotel in the city.

Tang Yitian had already booked a room for Xia ruofei. After Xia ruofei entered the hotel, she used ‘Tang Fei’ s ‘identity to check in.

Thanks to the development of the Internet, Tang Yitian had arranged everything in Australia. Besides booking the hotel, he even signed Xia ruofei up for a one – day tour.

This tour group set off from San Shan city and went to Pingtan. They went out to sea by boat at the dock and spent half a day on a nearby tourist Island before returning.

Xia ruofei rested in the hotel for a while. The phone he used as “Tang Fei” rang. The hotel informed him that the one – day tour group was about to set off.

So he packed his things and went downstairs. The tour guide gathered all the members in the hotel lobby and everyone got on a bus to go to Pingtan.

After arriving at Pingtan, they took a boat out to sea. Xia ruofei was in high spirits along the way and the members gradually became familiar with each other. They knew that this “Mr. Tang” was a Chinese man who was born and raised in Australia and was not good at Mandarin, so no one talked to him.

When they arrived on the island, Xia ruofei had a meal with everyone.

Just as the tour guide was about to bring everyone to snorkeling, Xia ruofei found the tour guide and told him that he was not going to move with the tour group or return on the boat at night. He was going to stay on the island for a day and then return on his own.

The main thing was that Xia ruofei was planning to’ disappear ‘from this Island, and he could not ruin the tour group. If he disappeared while he was with the team, it would involve a lot of troublesome problems.

The tour guide did not ask further. After confirming that Xia ruofei was leaving the tour group early, he took out a standard disclaimer for Xia ruofei to sign.

After that, Xia ruofei stopped following the group.

He strolled around the island for half a day and even had dinner at the food stalls by the sea. Then, he walked along the sea, looking no different from a leisurely tourist.

However, as Xia ruofei continued to walk forward, he gradually came to a sparsely populated beach.

Night had fallen. Xia ruofei looked left and right to make sure that no one was paying attention to him. Then, he jumped into the sea while standing on a rock.

It just so happened that the tide was low, so Xia ruofei easily swam in the direction of the tide towards the outer sea.

After a while, the small island was left far behind.

Night shrouded the sea in the summer and visibility was very low. After Xia ruofei swam for one or two kilometers, the lights on the island were already faintly visible.

There weren’t any ships nearby, so it could be said that no one knew.

Xia ruofei stepped on the water and drifted with the current. He expanded his spiritual power to the maximum and confirmed that there were no other boats within a few kilometers. He took a deep breath and took the azmu yacht out of the realm.

The yacht hit the surface of the sea, causing huge waves.

Xia ruofei swam half a circle around the yacht and easily climbed onto the yacht through the affinity platform.

Now, even if the Australian – Chinese “Tang Fei” was missing, the overbearing President Xia ruofei’s yacht trip was coming to an end.

Tang Yitian would naturally take care of the rest of the work. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei stood on the deck of the yacht and took off his wet clothes. He used the bath towel on the yacht to clean his body and changed into the clean clothes that he had taken out from the interspace. Then, he threw the wet clothes into the washing machine on the yacht.

Then, he controlled the muscles and bones on his face and quickly returned to his original appearance. He quickly walked to the cockpit and started the engine without turning on the lights. He steered the yacht in the direction of the three mountains.

However, he did not return to the yacht Harbor immediately. After all, it was already very late. Furthermore, he did not know when he would return to the sea after this trip. Hence, Xia ruofei decided to spend the night at sea and return the next morning.

He drove the yacht to the sea near the three mountains, stopped the boat, and then went to the luxury bedroom in the cabin to rest for the night.
