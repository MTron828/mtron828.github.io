The “messy” gadgets that Xia ruofei was talking about were the hidden cameras and recording devices that the Liu family had installed in the high – ranking Ward in the South Building of 301 Hospital.

When Xia ruofei entered the house, he used his spiritual power to check. This time, the Liu family was rather honest and did not play any tricks. Xia ruofei’s amazing performance last time must have shocked them. Besides, now was the time for the Liu family to show their sincerity. They probably did not want to make Xia ruofei unhappy at this time.

Old master Liu was indeed a sly old fox. His skin was definitely thick enough. After hearing Xia ruofei’s words, he didn’t feel embarrassed at all. He just smiled and nodded. “You’re now our family’s distinguished guest. The way the Liu family treats their guests doesn’t allow us to be disrespectful to our distinguished guest.”

Xia ruofei smiled noncommittally and walked straight to the head of the bed. He placed the first aid kit on the bedside table and sat on the stool in front of the bed.

“Elder Liu, you don’t look well.” Xia ruofei said casually,”I heard from CEO Liu that you fainted once yesterday?”

Old man Liu squeezed out a smile on his pale face and said with some difficulty,””This illness is developing very quickly. I can even feel that my life is passing by quickly ... To be honest, I’ve already prepared for the worst ...”

“Don’t worry!” Xia ruofei said confidently,”since I’ve already accepted the payment from the Liu family, I won’t let anything happen to you.”

“This is the best news I’ve ever heard.” Old man Liu said with a weak smile.

“I’ll give you an examination first. ” Xia ruofei said,”give me your left hand.”

There was no such thing as a man on the left and a woman on the right when taking a pulse. A real Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioner would have to check the pulse of both hands. However, old master Liu’s right hand was still inserted with a drip needle. To Xia ruofei, taking a pulse was just a supplementary method. He used his spiritual power more to check.

It was no exaggeration to say that even if Xia ruofei had no medical skills, he had the “equipment” that was always successful. Even the most advanced CT machine might not be more accurate than him in terms of diagnosis.

Old master Liu took out the left and right hands from under the blanket and showed them to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei deftly took old master Liu’s pulse, closed his eyes, and carefully checked.

The room was silent. Old man Liu even held his breath for fear of disturbing Xia ruofei.

As for the medical staff assigned to old master Liu and the other members of the Liu family, they had already been “cleared” out. This was also a rule set by Xia ruofei. He did not wish for there to be a third person present other than him and the patient when he was treating the patient.

Xia ruofei took elder Liu’s pulse and only opened his eyes after two to three minutes. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Mr. Xia, what’s the situation?” asked elder Liu.

“It’s indeed pancreatic cancer,” Xia ruofei said indifferently.”The tumor is rather large, and liver metastasis has already appeared.”

Old master Liu was shocked. He looked at Xia ruofei with his eyes wide open as if he could not believe it.

The old man was very clear about Yingying’s condition, and this was also his own request. His children didn’t dare to hide anything about his condition from him, not even if it was a kind lie.

Xia ruofei’s judgment was almost the same as the latest examination in 301 Hospital.

The problem was, could a Traditional Chinese Medicine doctor’s pulse reading really be so accurate? In old man Liu’s impression, this wasn’t the style of traditional Chinese medicine. Under normal circumstances, the diagnosis of Traditional Chinese Medicine wasn’t as clear as that of Western medicine. This was because Traditional Chinese Medicine focused on the conditioning of the whole body, mainly from the balance of yin and yang.

It was the first time that old master Liu had seen someone like Xia ruofei, who could state the patient’s condition directly and was even so sure that he had hepatic metastasis from pancreatic cancer.

He was very sure that this was the latest report after yesterday’s examination. There was no liver metastasis before this, and the Liu family did not show Xia ruofei the detailed examination report.

Old man Liu was not an ordinary patient. His medical records were absolutely confidential, so they could basically be sure that Xia ruofei’s judgment was really based on his pulse.

After recovering from his shock, old man Liu was filled with hope. He smiled and said,””Mr. Xia, I suddenly have more confidence in your medical skills!”

“Of course, only by trusting the doctor and cooperating with the treatment can your illness be cured faster.” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Then he stood up and walked to the bathroom to wash his hands carefully. Then he returned to the bed and said with a smile,””My treatment plan isn’t complicated. In the beginning, I’ll try to control the condition as soon as possible through acupuncture and taking the Chinese medicine pill I prescribed. I hope that through a course of treatment, my condition will not continue to deteriorate, and even get better. Then, I can plan the next step of treatment. ”

“I’ll do whatever you ask me to do regarding the treatment!”Elder Liu nodded with a smile.

“Alright, but don’t use the drip during the acupuncture process.” Xia ruofei said,”also, I need you to take off your shirt and lie on the bed. Is that okay?”

“Of course, no problem!” Old man Liu said with a smile.

Xia ruofei nodded and went forward to pull out the needle. He pressed the needle with a cotton swab and said,””Please press for a while, I’ll make some preparations!”
