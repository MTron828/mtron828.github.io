Xia ruofei quickly put away the materials and took out the curved Frost Flying sword. He turned back in the direction he had come from.

The forest was very dense. If it were an ordinary person, they would have lost their way long ago. However, Xia ruofei had a strong memory and had the help of his strong mental power. In addition, he was not far from the place where he had encountered the Star Beast in a straight line. Hence, in a short while, Xia ruofei had quietly sneaked into the vicinity.

He didn’t return to his original spot directly, but at a position about two hundred meters away, he first carefully used his spiritual power to investigate, and then began to set up the array.

Although this trap & kill array was not his original creation, it was indeed something that no one had ever used before. It could be considered as an improvement and combination based on the foundation of the predecessors. As for the specific effect, he was actually not particularly confident in his heart.

However, based on his understanding of arrays, he more or less had an idea of the power of this trap and kill array.

He felt that as long as they didn’t encounter any high – Level star beasts or dozens or even hundreds of middle – grade star beasts, this trap & kill array wouldn’t be easily broken.

Xia ruofei skillfully set up the formation and then quietly lay in the forest. He maintained the maximum range of his spiritual power and carefully observed the surrounding situation.

In fact, Xia ruofei was also taking a gamble. He was betting that the intermediate astral beast that had escaped would come back for revenge.

If that intermediate Star Beast were to escape, Xia ruofei would be wasting his time here.

After all, if he wanted to break the record, he had to race against time.

However, Xia ruofei still believed in his own judgment. Since this mid – grade astral beast knew how to run away when it couldn’t win, it was obvious that it had a high IQ. It was only natural for it to call for help and seek revenge. After all, from the contact just now, it could be seen that this mid – grade Star Beast was quite courageous. It could even use its body to withstand the flying sword. It was unlikely that it would be scared and run away, never to come back.

However, as time passed, Xia ruofei could not help but feel anxious. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Fortunately, he didn’t wait too long. After hiding in the forest for more than ten minutes, there was movement at the edge of his spiritual power detection range.

Xia ruofei’s spirits were lifted. He continued to maintain the maximum range of his spiritual power and focused on the direction of the movement.

Soon, Xia ruofei used his spiritual power to detect that the Star Beast that had just escaped had appeared in the range of his spiritual power. Behind this Star Beast, there were fifteen or sixteen other star beasts.

Xia ruofei’s eyes brightened. After scanning with his spiritual force, a dense amount of information appeared in his perception mirror. He glanced at it but did not find any information about the high – Level astral beast. He was overjoyed.

Including the Star Beast that had escaped earlier, there were a total of 16 intermediate star beasts.

If Xia ruofei had not prepared the trap and kill array in advance, he would have fled without hesitation when he encountered such a lineup.

But now, the formation hidden in the forest behind him gave him a lot of confidence.

The only problem now was how to lure all 16 intermediate star beasts into the trap and ensure his own safety. After all, if all 16 extremely fast intermediate star beasts attacked him at the same time, Xia ruofei would not even have the chance to defend himself.

In fact, if he didn’t have the spirit map, he wouldn’t even be able to escape.

Xia ruofei already had a plan in mind. He did not rush to meet them.

Firstly, he was too far away from the formation, and his safety could not be guaranteed.

Secondly, he had already discovered that these star beasts had relatively high intelligence, even higher than the human – shaped puppets on the first floor of the trial tower. If he knew that there was a large wave of star beasts coming, but he didn’t run for his life and instead faced them head – on, this kind of abnormal behavior might cause the star beasts to be on guard.

Besides, Xia ruofei wasn’t worried that the astral beast would leave so easily. The fleeing astral beast had called so many reinforcements. With such a big formation, it was obvious that they wouldn’t give up until they found him. According to common sense, Xia ruofei couldn’t possibly stay in the same place all the time. Hence, he judged that the astral beasts would definitely spread out to search for him. Once they found him, they would immediately call for their companions to surround him. His current position was definitely within the search range of the astral beasts.

Hence, Xia ruofei decided that biding his time was the best choice.

He was quietly hiding in the forest, his mental power always covering the group of star beasts.

To be honest, seeing such a large group of star beasts slowly approaching him, Xia ruofei still felt some pressure in his heart. However, he was more excited. This feeling was very similar to when he was in the Army and watched the enemy’s small troops walk step by step into the enemy’s encirclement through the scope of his sniper rifle. Although his heart would more or less beat faster, it was more like his blood was boiling. At the same time, he could still maintain absolute calmness. His finger on the trigger did not move at all.

Xia ruofei was like that now. He lay on the ground and completely hid himself under the tall grass. He mainly used his spiritual power to investigate, so he didn’t need to care if his vision was blocked.

In fact, mental power could detect almost 360 degrees without any blind spots, which was much larger than the field of vision with the naked eye, and less likely to make mistakes.

Soon, the 16 star beasts arrived at the place where Xia ruofei had fought with the star beasts.

They were not surprised to not find any trace of Xia ruofei. Instead, they quickly spread out in a fan – shaped formation and began to search the front. They seemed to be well – trained.

However, these star beasts did not expect that their every move was under Xia ruofei’s surveillance and that they were walking step by step into Xia ruofei’s carefully laid trap.

As the star beasts got closer and closer to Xia ruofei, his expression became more and more serious. He held his breath and did not dare to relax for even a moment as he used his spiritual power to detect the position of the star beasts.

When the astral beast that was searching for Xia ruofei’s hiding place was about a hundred meters away from him, Xia ruofei pretended to notice it.

Of course, he did not panic to the point of standing up and running away. As the saying goes, too much is as bad as not enough. After acting, it would no longer be real.

Xia ruofei deliberately made a little noise and then ran in the direction of the formation.

Although there wasn’t much movement, a slight shake in the grass immediately alerted the Star Beast.

Its sharp eyes scanned the area and immediately found Xia ruofei who was running away in the grass.

The Star Beast immediately stomped its hind legs and its body streaked across the air like a Phantom, chasing after Xia ruofei.

At the same time, it let out a sharp howl. The astral beasts that were searching nearby stopped in their tracks and surrounded Xia ruofei.

After Xia ruofei made a big commotion, he did not stop at all. Without hesitation, he flew in the direction of the formation.

After being discovered by the Star Beast, he didn’t even bother to hide his body. He stood up and stepped on the flying sword of the warped Frost, flying close to the ground.

In terms of absolute speed, Xia ruofei was definitely not as fast as the Star Beast. However, if he were to ride a flying sword, the Star Beast would not be able to catch up to him in a short time, no matter how fast it was.

Hence, Xia ruofei was soon followed by a large group of star beasts. Everyone was moving at their maximum speed. One was chasing while the other was running. The short distance between Xia ruofei and the array was covered in the blink of an eye.

After Xia ruofei passed through the array, he did not hesitate to cast a few spells. Three spiritual energy seals with mysterious patterns flew into the grass and the array that had been set up was activated in an instant.

These 16 star beasts didn’t seem to be aware of it as they charged into the range of the formation.

In fact, Xia ruofei had already stopped and turned around to look at the star beasts that were chasing after them.

However, as soon as these star beasts entered the formation, they immediately lost their target. The area in front of them suddenly turned white, and their visibility was less than a meter. They were surrounded by thick white fog.

These star beasts had probably never seen the array of human cultivators before, so they all started to run around in circles like headless flies.

The star beasts were also hot – tempered, and after they found themselves trapped, they also launched their strongest attacks towards their surroundings.

However, this trap and kill array obviously couldn’t be destroyed by brute force. In fact, most of the star beasts ‘attacks fell on empty space, and only a few of them hit the base of the array talismans. However, because the array was interconnected, such an attack was equivalent to being evenly borne by the entire array, and it didn’t hurt at all.

Some of the astral beasts couldn’t see their surroundings at all, so their attacks even landed on their companions. In an instant, three astral beasts were accidentally injured by their companions, and they let out angry roars.

This was also the reason why Xia ruofei felt assured when he detected that there were no high – Level astral beasts in the Horde.

...

If a high – Level astral beast’s random attack hit the key part of the formation, there was a chance that it would damage the formation. However, there was no need to worry about this group of middle – Level astral beasts. If this level of attack landed on Xia ruofei, it might break his bones. However, when it landed on the formation, the seemingly fierce attack would be no different from scratching an itch after it was shared by the entire formation.

If he was not in a hurry, Xia ruofei could have just watched the show from the side.

However, if he wanted to break the record, he naturally had to end the battle quickly. Therefore, it was meaningless to just trap these star beasts here.

Other than trapping the enemy, the deathtrap array naturally had a killing move.

Xia ruofei didn’t waste any time. After making sure that all the 16 star beasts had entered the trap, he immediately cast a spell and threw a few more seals into the center of the array.

The formation that was originally just a dense fog, after the activation of the seal technique, immediately underwent a violent change.
