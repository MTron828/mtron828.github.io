Chapter 1208: Life is like a play, all about acting (1)

Translator: 549690339

Feng Jing frowned slightly when she saw Section Chief li in his pajamas. She then said,”Oh! He’s my driver ...”

“I’m here to talk to you,” Section Chief Lee’s face darkened.”Why did you bring the driver here?”

Xia ruofei put on an innocent look and said,””I’m in charge of protecting CEO Feng’s safety. You guys can talk about your own things. I won’t talk!”

Section Chief Li’s eyes flashed with a hint of anger. He had asked Feng Jing to come to his hotel room so late at night to “discuss work”. His purpose was already clear, but why did Feng Jing bring a driver over?

Section Chief Li’s expression turned cold and he said indifferently,””Boss Feng, if you want to do something, you have to be sincere. Is this your sincerity?”

Feng Rao was confused and asked,””Section Chief Li, I’m very sincere! Otherwise, why would I come all the way from the suburbs in the middle of the night to meet you?”

Section Chief li cursed in his heart,’why the F * ck are you acting dumb in front of me?

He curled his lips and looked at Xia ruofei with disdain. Then, he said to Feng Rao,””I said to talk to you alone! I’ll put it this way, CEO Feng. If you want to talk, then come in alone. Otherwise, we have nothing to talk about!”

Feng Rao quickly exchanged glances with Xia ruofei and saw a flash of coldness in Xia ruofei’s eyes.

Feng Rao shook her head in her heart.

In fact, this was what she had discussed with Xia ruofei on the way here. The reason why Xia ruofei followed her upstairs was also her request. To put it bluntly, she was giving Section Chief li one last chance.

If Section Chief li had given up at the last moment and allowed Xia ruofei and Feng Jing to enter the room together, even if they did not talk about anything substantial, Xia ruofei would only give him a light punishment.

However, Feng Rao was being too idealistic.

Section Chief li had “worked hard” for so long and finally felt that he had forced Feng Jing to give in. How could he change his mind at the last minute?

In fact, the moment Division Chief li had this evil thought, his fate was already decided.

Only Feng Jing knew that Section Chief li had lost his last chance to save himself.

She finally gave up all hope and pretended to struggle in her heart for a while. Then, she gritted her teeth and said,””Little Xia, wait for me in the car downstairs!” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“President Feng ...” Xia ruofei said, pretending to hesitate.

Section Chief Li said rudely,””Why are you so long – winded? Don’t you listen to your superior? Boss Feng, why are all the drivers in your company so rude? I don’t have much confidence in your company!”

Feng Rao glared at Xia ruofei and said,””Get down!”

Xia ruofei then said helplessly,””Alright! Then be careful, President Feng ...”

Section Chief li shot a warning look at Xia ruofei, then put on a fake smile and said to Feng Jing,””President Feng, please!”

Feng Rao took a deep breath, nodded, and walked through the door.

Section Chief li stepped aside to let Feng Jing in, then immediately closed the door. He quickly closed the door and pressed the ‘Do Not Disturb’ light.

Feng Rao’s eyelids twitched slightly, but she walked in without a sound.

In the corridor, Xia ruofei walked forward unhurriedly and entered the safety passage in a flash. Then, he quickly ran upstairs.

Shixin hotel was just a Budget Express hotel. Xia ruofei had reason to believe that chief li chose this place because he had some internal connections in this hotel. He thought this was the safest place.

However, he also knew that even if chief li had acquaintances in the hotel, there was no need for someone to help him watch the surveillance cameras all the time when he was doing those dirty things.

After all, these people weren’t specially trained agents. Furthermore, they didn’t expect Feng Jing to go upstairs with her driver, so the possibility of him being watched was very low. He didn’t have to worry about anyone noticing anything unusual and reporting it to Section Chief li.

Xia ruofei went up the stairs at a very fast speed, almost unaffected by gravity. He sprinted the entire time. The hotel only had eight floors, and he ran up from the fifth floor. In less than 30 seconds, he had reached the top floor.

The iron door of the rooftop was locked, but it could not stop Xia ruofei. He was too lazy to open the lock, so he used a trace of true energy and twisted it. The big copper lock was pulled out by him.

Xia ruofei did not hesitate when he arrived at the rooftop. He immediately ran to the northeast corner.

As a former member of the Special Forces, he was extremely sensitive to directions. He almost didn’t need to think. He had already accurately found the top of Room 503 based on his subconscious feelings.

Without hesitation, Xia ruofei grabbed the railing of the rooftop and flipped over. He landed accurately on the air conditioner in Room 803. Before he landed, he used the window as a stepping stone. When he stepped on it again, it was light as if it was weightless and did not make any sound.

Even if Xia ruofei had not cultivated, he could do this with his eyes closed when he was in the lone wolf assault team, not to mention that his strength had increased by more than ten times.

Under the cover of the dark night, Xia ruofei was like a martial arts master who was as light as a swallow. He kept falling at an unbelievable speed.

Each of his movements seemed so dangerous, but it was just right. In the midst of danger, he could accurately find the best point of leverage.
