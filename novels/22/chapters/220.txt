Chapter 221: Chapter 217 – two doses effective (1)

The process of brewing the Chinese medicine was very simple. After Xia ruofei made sure that the doors and windows were locked and the curtains were drawn, he carefully checked the entire room. After making sure that there were no surveillance cameras, he followed the Chinese medicine prescription for liver cancer that he had memorized in advance and found the corresponding herbs from the list. Xu Wu’s work was very meticulous. Not only did he have a complete set of equipment for brewing medicine, but he also bought an exquisite and small scale. Xia ruofei easily weighed the herbs involved in the prescription and put them into the claypot. There was a sink in the room for the doctor, but Xia ruofei did not turn on the tap water. Instead, he summoned a spirit painting from his palm and connected to the space with his mind. He took out a small basin of water from the space pool. After that, it was Wen Huo’s slow cooking. Considering that elder song was still in a coma, it would be a little troublesome to feed him the liquid, so Xia ruofei had to wait for a long time so that there was not much liquid left. He poured the herbs in the claypot into a clay bowl and obtained about half a bowl of dark brown medicinal soup. Then, Xia ruofei opened the suitcase and found a bottle of flower petal solution with a relatively high concentration. The entire bottle of petal solution contained about half a petal. Xia ruofei poured almost one – fifth of the bottle into the clay bowl and stirred it well, making half a bowl of medicinal soup. Xia ruofei decided to give elder song five doses of the medicine. It should have a good effect. He would decide on the next step of the plan after that. Elder song’s condition was very serious. Xia ruofei estimated that an entire petal might not be able to cure him completely. Therefore, the solution that contained half a petal would not be able to cure him completely. At the same time, it would have a good effect. This would achieve his initial goal. After the medicine was prepared, Xia ruofei placed the clay bowl aside and let the medicine cool down naturally. Then, he randomly grabbed some herbs from each Chinese medicine packet, including the ones used to decoct the medicine before. He mixed them all together and poured them into the dregs in the claypot, then added some tap water to re – boil it. After all the herbs were mixed together, Xia ruofei poured the medicinal soup in the casserole into the sink and washed it away. He also poured the remaining dregs into the stove and burned them all. After doing all this, the medicinal soup in the clay bowl had almost cooled down. Xia ruofei put the rest of the Chinese medicine packets into the box and carefully locked it. Then, he carried the clay bowl out of the room. “Doctor Xia, is the medicine ready?” Manager Lu, who was at the door, asked hurriedly. The entire process of boiling the medicine took one to two hours, but manager Lu had actually stayed by her side. “En!” Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.”You can give the chief his medicine now.” “Good, good, good!” Manager Lu couldn’t help but look at the clay bowl in Xia ruofei’s hand. The brown liquid was his only hope now. Whether elder song could survive this crisis would depend on the effect of the medicine that the young Xia ruofei had prescribed. Song Zhengping, Tian Huilan, and song Rui were already waiting in the ward. When Xia ruofei entered the room, a few eyes fell on him. Xia ruofei smiled at Tian Huilan, indicating for her to relax. Then, he went straight to the bed and put the clay bowl on the bedside table. Then, he personally raised the head of elder song’s bed at an angle and took off his oxygen mask without hesitation. Xia ruofei started to feed elder song the medicine. Actually, elder song was no longer in a deep coma after he had taken the bottle of petal solution with the lowest concentration a few hours ago. Hence, he could subconsciously swallow the soup when Xia ruofei fed him. Xia ruofei was very patient. Moreover, there was not much medicinal soup, only about half a bowl, so he successfully fed her all of it. Xia ruofei waited for a while after feeding him. Then, he put the bed down and put the oxygen mask back on. Song Zhengping and the others only heaved a sigh of relief when Xia ruofei stood up. They had almost held their breath before this. Even though manager Lu knew that the effects of Chinese medicine were usually slower, he still couldn’t help but ask,””Doctor Xia, how’s the situation?” “Let’s observe for a while more!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”give the chief a dose of Chinese medicine tomorrow morning. I think he should be able to wake up in the morning.” “Wake up ... Wake up!” Manager Lu’s jaw dropped slightly.”Doctor Xia, you’re saying that the chief might wake up tomorrow morning?” “This is just my estimate, I can’t guarantee anything!” Xia ruofei smiled. “That’s right, that’s right ...” Manager Lu said. “Thank you for your hard work, Dr. Xia!” Song Zhengping said as he stepped forward. Thank you, thank you ...” Song Zhengping had rushed to Hongzhou just to see his father for the last time. He knew his father’s condition very well and didn’t expect his father to recover. He didn’t expect that a young Chinese medicine doctor would bring him hope after coming to Hongzhou. Song Zhengping, who had long since developed a shrewdness that did not show his emotions, could not help but reveal a trace of excitement at this moment. “You’re too polite. ” Xia ruofei said,”Chief Judge song, I’ll go back to my room first. I’ll brew the second Chinese medicine for the chief tomorrow morning.” One person will be enough in the ward, as long as the monitoring equipment doesn’t give any warnings, it’s fine!” Xia ruofei had received Tian Huilan’s call in the afternoon and had rushed over. Along the way, he had experienced so many things. At this time, the sky had already turned dark, and Xia ruofei felt a little tired. “Alright, doctor Xia, you’ve worked hard. Go and rest!” Song Zhengping said. Xia ruofei greeted manager Lu, Tian Huilan, and the others before returning to the doctor’s lounge. He washed up and went to the inner room to rest. The bed sheets and blankets that Liang Haitao had used previously had naturally been changed by the staff to new ones. Xia ruofei did not care about what kind of difficult night the medical team would have to spend in the big conference room. …… Xia ruofei woke up on time the next morning. He asked manager Lu to send breakfast into the room. After a simple breakfast, Xia ruofei locked the door and windows and began to brew the second Chinese medicine. This time, he was even more familiar with it. After more than an hour, Xia ruofei came to elder song’s bed with a bowl of medicine. Before feeding him the medicine, Xia ruofei observed elder song’s condition. His vital signs were quite stable, and the black spots on his hands and feet had faded. It was clear that the medicine from yesterday had worked. Song Zhengping and the others had also arrived at the room early. Today, not only was song Zhengping and his son present, but there were also a few middle – aged men and women who looked similar to song Zhengping. They were all elder song’s children. Elder song had three sons and two daughters, and all of them held important positions in Beijing or other parts of the country. Elder song’s third son, song Zhengming, was on a diplomatic visit with a leader and could not make it back in time. His other children had all arrived after Xia ruofei’s rest last night. Xia ruofei fed elder song the second bowl of Chinese medicine and waited in the ward with the others. As time passed, everyone except Xia ruofei was looking at elder song nervously. Xia ruofei had said that elder song might wake up after he drank the Chinese medicine. The success or failure of the treatment would depend on whether elder song would wake up or not. Although Xia ruofei had successfully stabilized elder song’s vital signs, everyone was still doubtful about whether he could treat liver cancer with the right medicine. If elder song could really wake up from his coma as Xia ruofei said, Xia ruofei’s treatment was undoubtedly the right one. As a result, song Zhengping, his siblings, Tian Huilan, and manager Lu were all extremely nervous. Even the usually happy – go – Lucky song Rui had a serious expression on his face at this time. He stood obediently at the side, but his eyes would occasionally glance left and right restlessly. Under everyone’s gaze, eccentric song was still lying there quietly, his chest rising and falling very gently. The rhythmic beeping of the monitoring Instrument seemed to be amplified in the quiet Ward. Ten minutes ... Twenty minutes ... Soon, half an hour had passed, but elder song still showed no signs of waking up. There was a dead silence in the ward, and the atmosphere was tense. Just as everyone felt that the hope was getting slimmer and slimmer, elder song’s finger suddenly trembled ...
