Chapter 621: Chapter 454 – helping the world (3)

“Sure, it’s fine to add more!” Xia ruofei said,”Auntie Xue, think of a way to feed Chengcheng this Chinese medicine. I still have to deal with the rest of the medicinal soup.”

“Alright, alright, please do what you need to do!” Xue bi Yun quickly said.

Xia ruofei returned to the bedroom and locked the door. Then, he poured all the remaining medicinal soup in the claypot into a soup bowl before throwing the dregs into the trash can.

Xia ruofei looked at the remaining medicinal soup and did some calculations in his heart. He walked back to the living room, took some mineral water from the water dispenser, and went back to the bedroom. He mixed the mineral water with the medicinal soup.

Then, he calculated the dosage and took out the prepared solution of the spirit Heart Flower petals from the space. He poured it in and stirred it evenly with chopsticks.

Then, Xia ruofei took out the sealed Chinese medicine bag that he had bought in the pharmacy and packed the soup into it.

There were nine portions in total, enough for three days.

Xia ruofei took the vacuum – packed bags out and saw that Xue bi Yun had already finished feeding him the bowl of Chinese medicine and was chasing after Chengcheng to wipe his mouth.

Xue bi Yun had been taking care of Chengcheng all these years, so she knew his habits and personality like the back of her hand. She had her own way of feeding him medicine.

Seeing this, Xia ruofei was slightly relieved. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Doctor Xia, Chengcheng has finished it.” Xue bi Yun saw Xia ruofei come out and quickly said.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”very good!” Aunt Xue, this is the Chinese medicine I made today. I’ve put it in a vacuum – sealed bag. Put it in the fridge three times a day and take it half an hour after meals. Three days later, I’ll have someone send you the medicine for the next three days!”

“Alright, alright!” Xue bi Yun gratefully accepted the vacuum bag,”doctor Xia, I’ve really troubled you ...”

......

“Aunt Xue, the first course of treatment will take about half a month. If there are no accidents, we should be able to see the obvious effect.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”after the second course of treatment, he should be back to normal!”

Xue bi Yun couldn’t help but be stunned. She didn’t dare to imagine it. After all, the publicly acknowledged conclusion in the medical world today was that there was no way to treat autism with medicine, and only through training intervention could behavior be corrected.

Even though Huanhuan had recovered, Xue bi Yun still did not dare to think that Chengcheng would be like Huanhuan.

Sometimes, she even wondered if Huanhuan had been misdiagnosed because she was introverted, and that she had gotten better with age.

Of course, Xue bi Yun quickly dispelled this thought. Because she and Tian Huixin had taken care of the child’s rehabilitation for a long time, she understood Huanhuan’s condition. With Hong Kong’s MA family’s financial resources, how could there be a misdiagnosis?

She was overjoyed, but at the same time, she was afraid of being disappointed again.

Worrying about gains and losses, this was Xue bi Yun’s current mentality.

“Doctor Xia, then ... Chengcheng’s epilepsy ... Doesn’t he need surgery?” Xue bi Yun carefully asked.

Xia ruofei smiled.”Traditional Chinese Medicine doesn’t require surgery. The pathological changes in the brain will gradually recover as the treatment continues. Aunt Xue, don’t worry!”

“Thank you! “Thank you ...” Xue bi Yun said, a little choked up.

“You’re welcome. We’re all from the same hometown, and you’re aunt Huixin’s good friend. I’ll definitely help if I can!” Xia ruofei said.

Xue bi Yun went to put the sealed Chinese medicine bag into the small refrigerator under the cabinet at the entrance of the room, while Xia ruofei looked helplessly at the sofa.

Huan Huan was still fast asleep.

In fact, Xia ruofei wanted to return to the farm as soon as possible. Yingying could take the soup tomorrow. This time, it was very likely that she could unlock a new page of the booklet. Xia ruofei planned to prepare the soup tonight and take it the next morning.

However, he had just promised Tian Huixin. Now that Huanhuan was still sleeping, it was really not good for him to leave.

After Chengcheng took the Chinese medicine, he didn’t play for a while and also fell asleep on the ground.

Xue bi Yun quickly picked him up and placed him on the sofa, covering him with a blanket.

Now, a little loli and a little boy on the sofa, each occupying one head, sleeping as soundly as they could.

Xia ruofei and Tian Huixin looked at each other and smiled bitterly. They sat down on the sofa opposite them helplessly.

At FiveO’ clock in the evening, Huanhuan finally turned over and rubbed her sleepy eyes. She looked around in a daze and slowly sat up.

When she saw Xia ruofei sitting opposite her, smiling at her, her sleepiness was instantly swept away. She shouted happily,””Brother Xia!”

Then, without even putting on her shoes, Huanhuan jumped off the sofa barefooted and threw herself into Xia ruofei’s arms.
