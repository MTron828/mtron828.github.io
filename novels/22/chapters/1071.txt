“That’s not a big problem ...” Feng Jing said.”As long as the quality of our products meets the standards, it’s fine. It’s just a matter of pushing the boundaries!” It wouldn’t matter if we’re not in a hurry to launch the product, but since we want to strike while the iron is hot, we definitely need a certain amount of advance. ”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,””Can the production of the heart – nourishing soup keep up?”

Feng Rao had obviously thought about this before. She replied without hesitation,””Now it seems that the jaded skin ointment will be approved before the heart – nourishing soup is officially approved on the market. If it’s only for clinical trials, one production line is certainly not a problem. At most, the workers will produce it in three shifts.”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”alright, you and Kanayama can discuss this.” However, I need at least a week to prepare the last ingredient. ”

A week’s time, including Xia ruofei’s arrangements that had been made four to five days in advance, was about ten days. That meant that he would have less than a year in the Archean realm.

Normally, one could harvest at least one or two batches of green maple vines in the Archean realm. When that time came, there would not be a big problem with normal production.

“Okay!” Feng Rao said excitedly.

“Let me know after you’ve decided. I’ll prepare the medicinal herbs in advance.” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Yeah!” Feng Rao nodded. I’ll contact Jin Shan immediately. If it really doesn’t work out, I’ll ask him to come back. He won’t have to personally look after the documents. ”

Then, Feng Rao said eagerly,””Chairman, I’ll go back to my office first. “I’ll have to contact Kanayama. Also, there’s still a lot of work to be done in the early stages of the listing. Sales channels, publicity, and other things have to be done first ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.”Okay, thank you for your hard work. Oh, don’t forget to let me know when you get a new number.”

Feng Rao was stunned for a moment, then she said in a low voice,””I know!”

She was still resentful about being pushed to the front stage by Xia ruofei for no reason.

Xia ruofei laughed.”I’ve already told ye Lingyun to strengthen the security and patrol. You don’t have to worry about the paparazzi or enthusiastic fans sneaking into the farm. However, if you leave the farm, you have to be more careful. It’s best to bring two veterans with you to be in charge of your safety ...” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Feng Rao said faintly,”now I don’t even have personal freedom ... Sigh!” I can’t care so much, I’m not planning to go out recently anyway ...”

Feng Jing couldn’t help but glare at Xia ruofei before she left the office while Xia ruofei laughed.

After Feng Jing left, Xia ruofei packed up and went back to the small villa.

Hu Zi’s mother and Lin Qiao were both at home. In a few days, Lin Qiao would be going to Egret Island to attend university. At the request of Hu Zi’s mother, she also officially ended her internship and stayed at home to accompany her mother. After all, she would be going on a long journey in a few days.

When Xia ruofei returned home, the two of them were naturally very happy. Hu Zi’s mother hurriedly went to prepare a few more dishes for Xia ruofei’s welcoming dinner, while Lin Qiao pestered Xia ruofei for gifts.

Fortunately, Xia ruofei was well prepared. When he accompanied Huanhuan to the Ocean Park and Disneyland, he bought a lot of small gifts, so he passed the test smoothly.

Xia ruofei’s life returned to normal. However, he felt that he had missed out on something, but he could not recall what it was.

......

Late at night, in a luxurious mansion on the top of Taiping Mountain in Hong Kong.

In the large master bedroom, Tian Huixin, who was wearing silk pajamas, was still blushing, but her expression was a little helpless.

Meanwhile, Ma Zhiming’s mood was also very low. At the same time, he said in a low voice with a trace of embarrassment,”Honey, I’m sorry ...”

Tian Huixin secretly sighed and hugged Ma Zhiming from behind. She said softly,””It’s okay ... I’m probably just too tired from work! Maybe he’ll be fine after some rest. ”

“I hope so ...” Ma Zhiming sighed.

After Huanhuan had fallen asleep, the couple returned to their room and prepared to make out, but no matter how hard they tried, Ma Zhiming couldn’t pull himself together.

Tian Huixin was at the age where her needs in that area were the strongest, so it was impossible for her to not feel awkward.

And this was not the first time. It had been the same for more than a month. Ma Zhiming even went to see the doctor secretly and prescribed medicine for him, but it was completely ineffective.

Now, Ma Zhiming was almost traumatized.

He wasn’t even forty years old yet, so logically speaking, it was impossible for such a situation to occur. However, the truth was that it was a joke.

“Hubby, rest early!” Tian Huixin said faintly.

The two of them lay side by side on the soft bed, covered with their own blankets, but they did not feel sleepy.

After an unknown period of time, Tian Huixin, who was in the dark, suddenly turned around and asked,””Zhiming, didn’t RUO Fei tell you to go find him after the auction? You didn’t go after that?”

Ma Zhiming patted his forehead and said,”I totally forgot about that!” A few days ago, there were a lot of things to do at the company ... Huixin, why are you suddenly asking about this? It’s all in the past. Besides, Xia Sheng said that he wanted to give me a gift, so I didn’t feel good about taking the initiative to look for him. Since I’ve forgotten about it, then forget it ...”

Tian Huixin sat up and said,””No! I was just thinking ... Could RUO Fei have noticed that you ... Have a small problem in that area?”

Ma Zhiming also sat up at once when he heard that. Then, he said dejectedly, “That’s not possible, is it? Even dad doesn’t know about this, and Xia Sheng didn’t help me do a checkup? Could it be that he can read fortunes?”

“It’s hard to say. You know RUO Fei’s medical skills very well. He’s at the pinnacle ...”Tian Huixin said.

Ma Zhiming frowned and said,”this isn’t scientific at all ... Huixin, even if Xia Sheng’s Chinese medicine is very advanced, he should at least check her pulse, right?” That day, he only looked at me a few times and he found something wrong with me?”

Ma Zhiming lay down again, somewhat dejected, and said,”Huixin, let’s not think too much ... Tomorrow, I’ll go to doctor he for a full – body Urology examination ...”

“Alright ...” Tian Huixin said faintly.

It was a quiet night.

At noon the next day, Ma Zhiming returned home dejectedly. After leaving Huan Huan in the care of the servants, he pulled Tian Huixin back to the room.

“Zhiming, how’s the checkup?” Tian Huixin asked nervously.

“There’s nothing wrong with the test results!”Ma Zhiming scratched his head and said. But ... But there was clearly a problem! How could this be?”

Tian Huixin was disappointed. The couple were only in their thirties. If Ma Zhiming’s unmentionable disease could not be detected by the best Urology expert in Hong Kong, then wouldn’t she be a widow at such a young age?

Moreover, disharmony in this aspect would have a huge impact on the relationship between husband and wife.

Tian Huixin lowered her head and thought for a while, then said,””Zhiming, why don’t you ... Try contacting RUO Fei? I feel that he must have seen through the problem with your body that day, but it wasn’t convenient for him to say it in front of dad and CEO Feng ...”

“No way, right?” Ma Zhiming hesitated.

“There’s no good way now anyway. Why don’t we try contacting him?” Tian Huixin said,”even if RUO Fei didn’t do it for this matter, you ... You can also ask him for help! After all, his medical skills are so good. ”

Tian Huixin’s words made Ma Zhiming finally make up his mind.

Although Xia ruofei could be considered their junior, and it would be a little embarrassing to ask Xia ruofei for help because of this problem, Ma Zhiming still decided to go all out for his own “happiness.”

It was noon. Ma Zhiming hesitated for a long time before he finally took out his phone. He found Xia ruofei’s number and dialed it.

Xia ruofei was helping Lin Qiao with her luggage when he received the call.

Lin Qiao was going to report to Egret Island tomorrow. Xia ruofei and Hu Zi’s mother were going to accompany her.

Seeing Ma Zhiming’s number, Xia ruofei greeted Lin Qiao and answered the call as he walked upstairs.
