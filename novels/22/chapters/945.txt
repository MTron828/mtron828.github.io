Chapter 946: The rune becomes_1

Translator: 549690339

Tang Yitian heard this and quickly scolded,””You child, you’re not allowed to be so rude! In the future, she would have to call him master! Do you know that?”

“Oh ...” Tang Haoran lowered his head and said.

At his age, he naturally didn’t quite understand how his brother had suddenly become his master, so he had a blank expression on his face.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”Haoran, your father is right. Since you’re going to be my disciple, you can’t call me brother anymore!” You have to call me master. ”

“I got it!” Tang Haoran replied obediently,”brother ruofei ... Master!”

Tang Yitian touched his son’s head with joy, then said to Xia ruofei,””Mr. Xia, then let’s settle the matter of acknowledging a master first! I’ll be going to Sydney in the next two days to prepare for the apprenticeship ceremony and invite some of the seniors of our Yixing Association to witness it ...”

Xia ruofei quickly waved his hand and said,”there’s no need to make such a big fuss!” Besides, accepting a disciple was a very personal matter, so there was no need to announce it to the world! You know, I’m actually quite afraid of trouble ...”

“This ... It’s a big deal for you to accept a disciple ...” Tang Yitian said with some difficulty.

“What’s the big deal?” Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”Mr. Tang, there’s no need to hold any ceremony. It’s decided!”

Tang Yitian didn’t dare to go against Xia ruofei’s words, so he could only nod helplessly.

“Don’t spread the news that I’ve accepted Haoran as my disciple. Just let our own people know,”Xia ruofei reminded her.

“Alright, alright.” Tang Yitian said quickly.

He knew Xia ruofei’s personality. Since Xia ruofei wanted to keep a low profile, he would not be so stupid as to tell everyone about this.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”how about this?” You guys take Haoran to Paradise Farm tomorrow, and we’ll do a simple ritual on a small scale. In addition, I’ll have to fully examine Haoran’s talent and customize cultivation content that suits him. ”

Tang Yitian was overjoyed and quickly said,””Alright, I’ll follow Mr. Xia’s orders!”

Xia ruofei was in a good mood after getting his apprentice as he wished. He chatted with Tang Yitian’s family for a while in the lounge. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Tang Yitian, as a special guest of this cocktail party, didn’t show up in the banquet hall to talk to Xia ruofei. It was only after Xia ruofei had taken the initiative to talk to him twice that he went out to say a brief farewell, then gave everyone a toast and returned to the lounge.

Of course, the farm owners and winery owners in the Hunter Valley area didn’t feel like they were being neglected. With Tang Yitian’s status, it was already very respectful for him to attend such a small party.

Usually, at their level, it was as difficult as ascending to the sky to see Tang Yitian. The two of them were not on the same level at all.

Xia ruofei did not like to be the center of attention, so he stayed in the lounge and did not go out.

Liang Qichao and Lin Qiao naturally became the focus of everyone’s attention. Many people came up to them to chat, and many of them were flattering them. Many people also revealed their desire to cooperate with Paradise Farm.

This was the first time that Liang Qichao had been so proud since he came to Australia. He had a confident smile on his face and responded appropriately. He only expressed his gratitude politely to the intention to cooperate and did not make any promises.

After witnessing the miracle of the vegetables in paradise, Liang Qichao would not take the initiative to look for a business partner! With such amazing products and a Super Channel like Maya, Paradise Farm’s development momentum would probably far exceed Paradise Farm’s domestic development.

Lin Qiao was surrounded by the female partners of the suppliers and was also the focus of everyone’s attention.

In the beginning, Lin Qiao was a little nervous. In addition, she wasn’t very proficient in English, so it was a little difficult for her to deal with the situation.

However, when she thought of Xia ruofei’s domineering performance just now, she suddenly felt more confident and gradually let go of her behavior.

Lin Qiao was the representative of the English course in the school. Her vocabulary and grammar were excellent, but she lacked practical practice. After this dinner party, Lin Qiao’s spoken English improved by leaps and bounds.

Xia ruofei did not wait for the reception to end. When he felt that it was about time, he called Liang Qichao and asked him to bring Lin Qiao back to the lounge.

Then, they made an appointment with Tang Yitian to meet tomorrow and left through the side door.

On the way back to Paradise Farm, Liang Qichao was still in a state of excitement. Tonight’s experience was like a dream to him. He almost couldn’t stop talking on the way, talking about how polite and enthusiastic the suppliers were.

Xia ruofei also laughed as he listened. He would interrupt from time to time, as if he was supporting Liang Qichao.

Lin Qiao was listening to their conversation with a smile on her face. She glanced at Xia ruofei from time to time, and her eyes glowed.

After returning to the farm, everyone made tea and chatted in the living room on the first floor for a while before going back to their rooms.

Once Xia ruofei entered the room, he locked the door and windows without even taking a shower. Then, he took out the spirit painting scroll and entered the medium.

He was prepared to unlock the human jade talisman in one go today.

Xia ruofei directly took the Jade talisman from the stone chamber in the mountain sea realm and brought it to the Archean realm. He used the 30 times time flow here to save as much time as possible.

Xia ruofei told Xia Qing directly,”I’m going into seclusion to practice unlocking runes. Don’t disturb me unless it’s something important!”

“Yes, master!” “Yes,” Xia Qing replied respectfully. She then left the Archean realm and went to the mountain sea realm to work on the herb garden, iron – Skin dendrobes, and Cordyceps.

Xia ruofei sat down cross – legged by the spiritual pond and slowly closed his eyes. He adjusted his breathing rhythm and slowly focused his mind.

Then, Xia ruofei’s fingers moved slightly. A wave of spiritual energy came out of his body and started to construct the complicated unlocking rune.

His speed was extremely fast, and the thin threads formed by his spiritual power shuttled back and forth in the air, forming complicated and rhythmic patterns.

These patterns stacked together, and a rune began to take shape.

In the later stages, his speed gradually slowed down, but he was still very smooth and did not slow down.

After a long while, a rune made of pure spiritual energy appeared in front of Xia ruofei.

He opened his eyes and took a few glances. Then, he waved his hand and dispelled the rune.

This time, the speed had improved a lot, and the Rune’s perfection had increased by a lot. However, there were still five small flaws. Xia ruofei had sensed them the moment the rune was completed.

His face was as calm as an ancient well. He picked up the water bottle beside him and drank a mouthful of the spirit Heart Flower petal solution. After resting for a while, he continued to practice.

Thirty hours in the Archean realm was only one hour in the outside world. Hence, Xia ruofei had plenty of time to complete the “last kilometer”.

Previously, he had insisted on practicing in the stone chamber for the mountain and sea realm. On one hand, he did not feel any sense of urgency for cultivation. On the other hand, of course, it was also because the Jade praying mat in the stone chamber had greatly improved the recovery and concentration of spiritual power.

After deciding to take Tang Haoran as a disciple, especially after obtaining the approval of Tang Yitian and his wife, Xia ruofei suddenly felt a sense of urgency and seemed to feel the responsibility on his shoulders.

Xia ruofei guarded his bier tightly. His spiritual power was like his arm and fingers, exuding out of his body and forming a complex unlocking rune in the air.

One time, two times, three times ...

With every practice, he could see obvious progress.

The unlocking runes he constructed were getting closer and closer to perfection in theory, and the number of tiny flaws in the runes had also decreased from five to one or two.

Xia ruofei felt that his spiritual energy was starting to get difficult. Hence, after drinking a few mouthfuls of the spirit Heart Flower petal solution, he stood up and walked to the lounge chair at the side. He laid down and closed his eyes to rest.

He had a lot of time, so even though he hoped to unlock the human – shaped jade talisman directly this time, he was not in a hurry.

His spiritual power slowly recovered.

Xia ruofei got up again and continued to practice calmly.

He painstakingly constructed the runes again and again, and then dispersed them with a wave of his hand without any heartache.

Xia ruofei’s proficiency in constructing runes was increasing little by little without him knowing.

Finally, after the second rest, Xia ruofei started to construct the runes again.

The initial stage was still very fast. The lines of spiritual power shuttled back and forth quickly, constructing a complex rune pattern.

As the construction process progressed, Xia ruofei’s speed gradually slowed down. However, he was still very precise in his control of every detail. Gradually, the construction of the rune was nearing its end.

Xia ruofei’s face, which had always been calm and collected, now showed a trace of nervousness.

This was because he could feel that the construction of the entire rune was extremely smooth, and he did not find any flaws.

Xia ruofei became more and more cautious in the process.

The strong mental strength that he had trained in the Special Forces played an important role at this time. Although Xia ruofei was a little nervous, he could still control his spiritual power.

The runes were getting more and more complicated, and Xia ruofei’s expression was getting more and more serious.

In front of Xia ruofei, a complicated rune formed by spiritual energy was gradually being perfected.

The last thread of mental strength twisted into a mysterious pattern in the air and merged into the rune without a trace.

The entire rune flashed and all the spiritual energy patterns merged into one. It floated quietly in front of Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei opened his eyes, a smile on his tired face.

This rune seemed to be a whole, and it was full of a harmonious and natural charm.

Xia ruofei didn’t even need to check to know that the rune was flawless. The channel created by his spiritual power was quite stable. The entire structure was a perfect whole.

Xia ruofei stared at it for a few seconds. Then, he took a deep breath and took out the human – shaped jade talisman.
