Translator: 549690339

As soon as the video call was connected, Geng bin saw that the screen of his mobile phone was filled with people, and the thunderous applause also shocked him.

At this time, Liu Qian was holding her work phone and the camera was facing the staff.

This phone was also connected to the computer, and the image was directly projected on the big screen.

Liu Qian smiled and said,”Geng bin, now everyone can see you on the big screen. Say hello to everyone!”

Geng bin was a little stunned. After hesitating for a second or two, he subconsciously saluted to the camera and said,””Hello, my fellow colleagues! I’m Geng bin from the security Department!”

Liu Qian did not explain the reason for the call, and Geng bin did not know that he had won the Special Award for Xia ruofei’s contribution. He was still guessing why a security guard like him would suddenly be called at the annual meeting, but soon his thoughts were interrupted by thunderous applause.

“Geng bin, you must be wondering why I suddenly video – called you!” Liu Qian said with a smile.

Geng bin smiled and scratched his head.””I’m indeed a little confused right now ...”

“Then you’ll be even more confused after this!” Liu Qian smiled and said,”I’ll let the chairman tell you!”

Xia ruofei was also on the stage at this time. After Liu Qian turned the camera to him, Geng bin immediately saw Xia ruofei on the phone.

Geng bin subconsciously straightened his back and shouted,””Good day, Chairman!”

These ex – soldiers called Xia ruofei “brother Xia” in private, but in formal occasions, they all followed the rules and would not mess around just because they had a good personal relationship with Xia ruofei. On the contrary, the security department’s employees had always been the model of paradise Corporation in terms of discipline.

Xia ruofei smiled.”Geng bin, we’re all gathered here on New Year’s Eve. It’s been hard on you guys who are on duty!”

“Chairman, this is our duty!” Geng bin quickly said. It’s not hard!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”there are two main purposes for today’s call. The first is to represent the company and say hello to the staff on duty.” As for the second reason ... Do you still have the lottery ticket I gave you today?”

“Yes,” Geng bin nodded and said,”the higher – ups told us to carry it with us!”

“Then take it out and show it to the camera!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Geng bin quickly took out the lottery ticket from his shirt pocket and aimed the camera at it.

Number 111. This was the lucky number printed on it.

The crowd burst into applause again.

When Geng bin pointed the camera at himself again, Xia ruofei smiled and said,””Geng bin, I believe you’ve heard the applause. I’m very happy to inform you that in the lucky draw that just ended, your number won!”

“Really?” Geng bin chuckled and said,”I didn’t expect my luck to be so good!”

At this time, Liu Qian also came to Xia ruofei’s side. She held her phone in one hand and said,””Geng bin, this award is very special! “Originally, it was the chairman who won the prize. He even got the best result in the game segment and received a total of 31800 Yuan. Then, he personally contributed this prize and drew an employee on the spot to get this prize. This luck finally fell on your head!”

Geng bin was even more excited when he heard this and quickly said,””Thank you, Chairman!”

30,000 Yuan was equivalent to several months of his salary. It was even higher than his year – end bonus. This was undoubtedly the best reward for him who had worked hard for a year.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you’re welcome!” You’ve made a lot of contributions to the company this year. This is the reward you deserve!”

“Thank you, Chairman!” Geng Bing said. I’ll definitely work harder! I won’t let down the expectations of the company’s leaders!”

Xia ruofei nodded, pleased.””I’ll get my brothers in the security Department to bring the bonus back for you! Please send your regards to the other brothers who stayed behind!”

“Yes!” Geng bin said.

After the video call ended, the fun and exciting second prize lucky draw segment officially came to an end.

The annual meeting was coming to an end, and the first and grand prizes were announced.

The first prize was a ten – day, nine – night luxury tour to the Maldives, and the company would pay for the entire family. The lucky winners could have a maximum of four spots, bringing their parents and wives (husbands). If the lucky winners had children, they could apply for an extra spot and bring their children along. All the expenses were covered by the company, which was very humane.

There were a total of five spots for such a grand prize.

The only grand prize was even more luxurious. It was a family luxury tour to Europe, and the quota was the same as the first prize.

Feng Rao went on stage to draw the first prize, while Xia ruofei naturally drew the grand prize.

In the end, three people won the first prize, and the other two first prizes were won by the more than 100 employees of paradise pharmaceutical factory who guarded the production line.

The grand prize went to a staff member of the marketing department who was present.

Regardless of whether they won the prize or not, everyone felt that tonight’s annual staff party was extremely exciting.

However, many people had the same feeling. Although the first and special prizes were tempting, the most exciting part was that Xia ruofei drew his number, participated in the game, and generously contributed the prize.

That scene had left a deep impression in the hearts of many employees. Many years later, when they talked about today’s Annual Meeting, this scene would be the first thing they would think of.

The grand prize was worth more than 150000 Yuan, which was definitely a Super Grand prize.

The employee who won the prize was a girl in her 20s named Lin Jiaxin. When this super lucky thing hit her head, she felt dizzy and even seemed to be dreaming after she went on stage.

Xia ruofei also stayed on stage after the draw. He would personally present the award to Lin Jiaxin, then give a speech and announce some decisions regarding the company’s reorganization.

The first and grand prize naturally could not be moved to the stage, but the preparation team for the annual party had made some colored cardboard in advance, on which the awards and prizes were written.

After Lin Jiaxin went on stage, Liu Qian, as usual, had to do a live interview with the only lucky person of the night.

“Congratulations, Jiaxin, for becoming the biggest winner tonight!” Liu Qian said with some envy.

“Thank you ... So I’m not dreaming, right?” Lin Jiaxin said in a daze.

The staff in the audience couldn’t help but laugh. Xia ruofei, who was standing at the side, couldn’t help but smile.

“Of course it’s not a dream!” Liu Qian said. It seems that our Jiaxin is a little caught off guard by this award! Actually, you can give it to me! I don’t mind ...”

“I mind!” After Lin Jiaxin regained her senses, she immediately said,”sister Qian, you can’t suppress the newcomer!”

“Alright, alright!” Liu Qian said,”then how do you feel now? Can I share it with everyone?”

“I ... I just feel a little unreal ...” Lin Jiaxin seemed to want to continue being silly and cute,”I’ve never won a prize since I was young. I’ve never won a small two Yuan prize when buying scratch – to – win tickets. I didn’t expect to win the grand prize this time!”

Liu Qian couldn’t help but laugh and said,”It seems like you’ve saved up all your luck and then used it all at once!”

“Jiaxin, how many slots are you planning to apply for?” Liu Qian asked.

Lin Jiaxin muttered to herself for a moment and said with some embarrassment,”It should be three people! If my parents can take leave, I’ll take them to Europe!”

Hearing this, Liu Qian reminded her,”Jiaxin, family also includes your boyfriend ‘s!” You don’t have to get married!”

“I know!” Lin Jiaxin said with a smile.

Liu Qian immediately reacted and said,”That means Jiaxin is still single!” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

She then said to the staff in the audience,””Why are the single young men in the audience hesitating? Hurry up and attack! Take a gamble, and the bicycle will change ... No, no! If you succeed, not only will you have such a cute and obedient girlfriend, but you’ll also get a free luxury tour in Europe!”

The employees also started to make a fuss, and Lin Jiaxin’s face suddenly turned red.

Xia ruofei joined in and said,”I think it’s possible!” I can reserve this family member position for you for a month ...”

“Everyone, did you hear that?” Liu Qian immediately said,”the chairman has given us a month’s time. Our single male colleagues have to make good use of it!”

Then, Liu Qian showed a flattering smile to Lin Jiaxin and said,”Jiaxin, you don’t have to consider men! In fact, if there’s a luxury tour in Europe, I can also accept girls ...”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment, then he couldn’t help but laugh out loud. The audience was also laughing ...
