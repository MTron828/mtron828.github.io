Chapter 900: I’ll need 500 grams too_2

Translator: 549690339

“Our President Lin would love to have more trouble like this!” Dr. Huang joined in the fun.

“Elder Huang is right, brother Xia!” President Lin laughed. In the future, if you encounter such ‘trouble’, you must consider me first!”

“No problem! We’re old friends, so I’m not worried about working together!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

President Lin thought for a moment and said,”brother Xia, there’s no reference price for this kind of top quality wormgrass at the moment. Let’s make it 700000 Yuan per kilogram!” How many do you have in total?”

“The weight we measured was about 490 grams. Mr. Lin, you can use a more sophisticated weighing tool when we trade ...” Xia ruofei said.

“No need, no need!” President Lin quickly said,”the price of 700000 Yuan is already a bit conservative. Let’s just take 500 grams! How about 350000 Yuan?”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Alright, alright, alright. We’ll do as you say, brother!”

CEO Lin seemed to be afraid that Xia ruofei would go back on his words. He immediately took out his phone and called the staff of Tongren Hall. He asked them to immediately prepare the contract and fax it to him according to the price they had just agreed on. He also asked the finance department to transfer the money to the peach blossom company’s account in the afternoon.

Xia ruofei knew that the reason why Lin Jian was so enthusiastic was definitely because he had the idea of working with the wormgrass of paradise company in the future.

Hence, after the deal was settled, Xia ruofei invited Mr. Lin and Dr. Huang to sit at the coffee table. He made tea for them and brought up their future cooperation.

“Mr. Lin, I’m not going to beat around the bush. This batch of wormgrass is just a sample. If we really want to supply it in bulk, I’m afraid it will take a few months.” Xia ruofei poured a cup of tea for President Lin and said,”if Tongren Hall is interested, we can consider it first.”

“I’m interested. Of course I’m interested!” President Lin quickly said.

What a joke, didn’t he rush over here so that he could be the agent for the wormgrass of the Paradise company in the future?

President Lin was also very clear that in theory, authentic Cordyceps sinensis was a natural product, including the iron fengdou from before. At first glance, it was also of wild quality, which could not be produced by Taoyuan farm at all.

However, he was a smart person. Xia ruofei had the means and channels to obtain these top quality medicinal herbs. He was his most important partner.

Because of his blind confidence in Xia ruofei, when CEO Lin received the call, he did not even ask about the quality of the wormgrass in Xia ruofei’s hands. Instead, he immediately decided to rush to the three mountains on the same day.

As it turned out, Xia ruofei did not disappoint him. In fact, he gave him a big surprise.

President Lin continued,”brother Xia, our Tongren Hall’s reputation and channels are the best in the country. We’re also old friends. This time, you must let us be the agent for the aweto!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Don’t worry, Mr. Lin. We’ve had a good time working together. I’ll definitely think of you first when I have a new product.”

At this moment, the fax machine in Xia ruofei’s office, which was in automatic mode, buzzed a few times and slowly spat out a few pieces of paper.

“Brother Xia,” President Lin immediately said,”it must be the contract from our side. Take a look!”

Xia ruofei stood up and walked to his desk. He picked up the printed paper and looked at it. It was indeed from Qiantang Tongren Hall.

The contract was a fixed format. It was a special document for Tongren Hall to purchase precious Chinese medicinal herbs, such as wild ginseng, iron maple, Cordyceps, and so on of a certain age. They only needed to fill in the name, grade, weight, unit price, and other parameters of the medicinal herbs to be traded in a certain fixed place.

It was not Xia ruofei’s first time signing such a transfer contract, so he was familiar with it. He quickly checked the amount and other important figures, then smiled and nodded. “There’s no problem with the contract. ”

Xia ruofei signed his name and took out the company seal from the drawer to stamp it.

Then, Xia ruofei called the finance department to inform them that there would be 350 thousand Yuan in the account today.

Xia ruofei passed the signed contract to President Lin. There were two copies of the contract and he wanted President Lin to bring it back and stamp it with the Tongren Hall’s seal before sending it back.

However, with Xia ruofei’s signature and the company seal, the payment could be made at Tongren Hall.

Ever since he established a close cooperative relationship with the peach blossom company, President Lin’s status in Tongren Hall had soared. He could make the decision for a small deal of 350000 Yuan by himself.

President Lin took the contract and handed it to Dr. Huang. Then, he said,””Brother Xia, thank you! This ... Do you have any thoughts on the sales model for aweto?”

Xia ruofei smiled faintly.”I’ll have to discuss this with my colleagues. Anyway, we can’t supply the goods in bulk for the time being. We’ll talk about the specific issues later!”

Then, Xia ruofei said seriously,””President Lin, regarding the sales collaboration, I can’t sign any written intent with you right now. I can only give you a verbal promise. I hope you can understand.”

Although he had already succeeded in his experiment at the Archean realm, Xia ruofei was not 100% sure that he could replicate such a success in the mountain and sea realm. Even if the possibility of failure was very small, Xia ruofei would definitely not sign any agreement with Tongren Hall before he actually obtained a large amount of Cordyceps. This included a voluntary agreement.

President Lin quickly said,”brother Xia’s words are more effective than any agreement!” Since you’ve agreed to cooperate with us first, I’m relieved. You don’t have to sign anything in writing!”

Xia ruofei had the initiative in the cooperation. Even if CEO Lin wanted to sign a written agreement, he had no bargaining chips. Besides, he had worked with Xia ruofei more than once and had confidence in his reputation.

Hence, he did not hesitate to praise Xia ruofei so that Xia ruofei would be more embarrassed to go back on his words in the future.

Xia ruofei smiled lightly and beckoned for the two of them to continue making tea.

That night, Xia ruofei invited Feng Jing, pang Hao, and the rest to the company’s restaurant to entertain President Lin and Dr. Huang.

The next morning, Mr. Lin took the 500 grams of aweto and returned to Qiantang city after bidding Xia ruofei farewell.

For the next two days, Xia ruofei did not rush to contact song Qiming. Instead, he stayed in the company to deal with some daily affairs. At night, he entered the spirit map space and continued to practice using his spiritual power to construct the complicated rune key.

Now, Xia ruofei could barely use his spiritual power to carve the entire rune. However, his proficiency was far from enough, and the spiritual power he poured into the rune was not stable enough.

Xia ruofei felt that there were still some minor flaws in the rune he had drawn. Although he could barely maintain the rune without it scattering, it was not in its best state.

Of course, this was largely due to his lack of proficiency.

Hence, Xia ruofei was not in a hurry to unlock the “v” character. After all, the rune did not operate smoothly. If something went wrong during the unlocking process and the Jade talisman was damaged, it would not be worth it.

Besides, Xia ruofei did not feel any sense of urgency when it came to cultivation. Hence, he maintained a steady state of mind and took a certain amount of time every day to practice.

On the third day, Xia ruofei gave song Qiming a call and told him that he had prepared the medicine.

Song Qiming was overjoyed. He expressed his gratitude and said that he would bring Song Wei to the farm personally.

Xia ruofei quickly declined. If a leader like song Qiming came out, it would definitely alert the leaders at all levels. Furthermore, Xia ruofei’s home was on the farm. If that happened, the farm would be affected.

Hence, Xia ruofei decided to send the medicine over himself. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

The two of them agreed to meet at his house at around 10:30 in the morning. Xia ruofei knew that song Qiming would definitely want him to stay for lunch. This was human nature, so he smiled and agreed.

Xia ruofei had asked Lei Hu to drive the company’s Mercedes – Benz over in advance. He left Taoyuan farm at around 10 O’ clock and headed to the villa area of the municipal Standing Committee by the crescent Lake.
