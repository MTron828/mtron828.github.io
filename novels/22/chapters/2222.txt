2223 A win – win situation (1)

When they arrived at the peach Garden building, Xia ruofei took the special elevator from the underground parking lot to the top floor.

As soon as the elevator door opened, Qin Yanan, who was at her desk facing the elevator, looked up and immediately stood up. She bowed slightly to Xia ruofei and said,””Good day, Chairman!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded at Qin Yanan.

Without waiting for Xia ruofei to ask, Qin Yanan took the initiative to report,””Chairman, director Gao from xiangnan TV arrived at the Tao Yuan building about ten minutes ago. He should be visiting the e – commerce Department at this time. President Feng and President Dong are with him.”

Then, Qin Yanan quickly looked at her watch and said,””Your meeting with him will be in about 20 minutes. The reception room is ready!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”okay, thank you!”

With that, Xia ruofei pushed the door open and walked in. Qin Yanan quickly followed him in and swiftly made Xia ruofei some tea. Then, he handed Xia ruofei a few documents that had been submitted since yesterday.

Xia ruofei glanced at the documents. They were arranged according to time and urgency. He nodded and said,””Alright, leave it here first! I’ll read it later. That ... When director Gao comes up, please remind me in advance. ”

“Alright!” Qin Yanan said,”Chairman, I’ll go out first!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.

Looking at Qin Yanan’s back as he left, then at the steaming teacup in front of him and the neat work desk, Xia ruofei felt that it was not bad to have a capable assistant.

Xia ruofei was reading some documents when Qin Yanan knocked on the door. She stood at the door and said,””Chairman, the administration department said that director Gao and his men are already waiting for the elevator. They’re ready to come up.”

“Alright,” he said. Xia ruofei said as he stood up.

He passed through the spacious office and went straight to the elevator. At this time, the elevator had just reached this floor.

The elevator door opened with a ding.

Dong Yun, who was dressed professionally, walked out of the elevator first and reached out to block the elevator door. Then, Gao Jun, the Deputy Director of xiangnan satellite TV, who Xia ruofei had met a few times, walked out.

When Gao Jun saw Xia ruofei standing not far from the elevator, he quickly walked over with a warm smile on his face. He reached out his hands and said,””President Xia! Hello, hello!”

Xia ruofei shook Gao Jun’s hand and smiled.””Director Gao, welcome, welcome!”

The two of them exchanged a few words, and Qin Yanan led the group to a small reception room on the side just in time. Everyone took their seats according to the host and guest. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Director Gao, it’s just recording an episode of the program. It’s not a big deal. Why did you personally come to the three mountains?”

Gao Jun said humbly,”President Xia is our important guest. I’m afraid that the people below will neglect you. It’s better to communicate with you in person.”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”you’re too kind, director Gao!” I’ll do my best to cooperate with the festival Group. ”

“Thank you! Thank you!” Gao Jun quickly said.

Even the son of chief hou of the headquarters was with Xia ruofei, so Gao Jun naturally did not dare to neglect him.

“Director Xia, do you have a certain level of understanding about our show?” Gao Jun asked.

Xia ruofei smiled.”I’ve actually watched a few episodes. That’s why I know the basic structure of the show. Of course, that’s on the premise that you guys don’t make too many changes this season.”

“That’s good!”Gao Jun said. There were definitely some adjustments to the details, but the overall shape did not change much. President Xia, I’ll go through the process with you first?”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said readily.

“First of all, our photographer followed you throughout the entire process. I heard from Mr. Hou that you have a very good siheyuan in Beijing, and it’s very unique.” Gao Jun said,”if you don’t mind, we hope to start shooting from the siheyuan.”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”no problem, but try not to involve too many private things.”

“Of course! Of course!” Gao Jun quickly said,”after the final editing of the show is done, we’ll let you review it first. If you feel that there’s anything that’s not suitable, we can make changes at any time. There won’t be any problems.”

“That’s good. ” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Gao Jun said,”President Xia, how about this? according to the usual practice, our guests will call to order food before going to the filming location. Let’s finish this order in the siheyuan!”

“Sure!” Xia ruofei said.

“Then the next step is to head to the mushroom house of the Paradise society.” Gao Jun said,”we arranged for a car provided by the sponsor to come out of the courtyard house. There will be a photographer accompanying the car to take some highlights ...”

Gao Jun then explained the general process of the shooting to Xia ruofei. In fact, the framework of this season’s show was similar to the previous two seasons. There were four permanent guests, and each episode would have a flying guest. Before the guests of the previous episode finished their journey, the guests of the next episode would have arrived. This way, it seemed that every episode was seamlessly linked.

The main theme of the program was naturally the leisurely life in the village.

According to Gao Jun’s introduction, this season’s permanent guest lineup was basically the same. It was still two old and two new. The “two old” were the male host of xiangnan TV, He Jiong, and the famous actor, Huang Lei. The “two new” were Peng Chang and Zhang Xing, who had become more popular in the past two years.
