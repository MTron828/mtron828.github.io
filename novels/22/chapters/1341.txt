Translator: 549690339

“I understand,” Liu Zhe said with a smile.”Thanks, brother Xia!”

After hanging up, Xia ruofei saw that Zhao Yongjun had already sent an ‘OK’ emoji back.

Ling Qingxue stood at the door and asked,””Ruofei, do you have something on tonight?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it’s nothing. A friend is looking for me. I’ll tell him to talk to me in two days ... Go to the kitchen and tell him.” Big brother Zhao and the others are already on their way. ”

“Alright, I’ll head over first.” Ling Qingxue smiled sweetly at Xia ruofei, then turned around and walked out of the private room.

......

In the Qing He teahouse, Tian Xiaojun saw that Liu Zhe had hung up the phone and immediately asked,”Did he say the place?”

“Chief Tian, brother Xia said that he’s hosting an important guest today. I’m afraid ...” Liu Zhe said after some hesitation.

“Just tell me the location!” Tian Xiaojun said impatiently,”how many important guests can there be in a small place like the three mountains?”

Zhong Zixin was also touching up her makeup with a small mirror as she sneered and said,””He’s just a small boss of a small company. I’m afraid that even a Section Chief is an important guest to him!”

Xia Ling also laughed without restraint.

Liu Zhe was a little annoyed. Putting aside the two idiots Zhong Zixin and Xia Ling, what did Tian Xiaojun have to look down on the three mountains? You left after finishing high school in Sanshan. If you didn’t have a good father, how could you be the Deputy Division Chief of the Ministry at such a young age?

Besides, if you look down on a small place like the three mountains, then why did you guys come here like cats that smelled blood after the jaded skin ointment became popular? Pretentious!

Liu Zhe naturally did not dare to show his complaints. He could only helplessly say,””Brother Xia said he’ll have Ling Ji’s private kitchen tonight ...”

“Bring us there!” Tian Xiaojun immediately stood up and grabbed the handbag on the table.

Tian Xiaojun was very decisive, and Liu Zhe had already given up trying to persuade him.

He had already told Tian Xiaojun that Xia ruofei had a good relationship with Song Wei, but Tian Xiaojun did not take it to heart.

If Xia ruofei was close to song Qiming, Tian Xiaojun might still have some reservations. However, Song Wei was song Qiming’s daughter. She could definitely use her influence to her advantage. However, it was not certain if it was Xia ruofei.

At the very least, Tian Xiaojun, who thought of himself as a superior official of the capital, did not care about these things.

Hence, Liu Zhe could only let him be. He was thinking about whether he could secretly inform Xia ruofei of the situation so that he could be prepared. He could also explain his difficulties so that Xia ruofei would not hate him.

Hence, Liu Zhe, who was sitting in the front passenger seat, had been fiddling with his phone ever since he got into the car.

Tian Xiaojun only looked on coldly from the side and did not interfere.

He knew that Liu Zhe would inform Xia ruofei, but he did not care. In his opinion, it would be better for Xia ruofei to know their identities in advance for the “negotiation”.

When it came to things like status, it didn’t seem as intimidating as when others said it.

Not only did Tian Xiaojun not interfere with Liu Zhe’s business, but he also directly talked about the Paradise company in the car.

He sat alone in the most comfortable seat in the middle of the car, while Zhong Zixin and Xia Ling sat in the back seats obediently.

Tian Xiaojun said,”after we meet later, Xiao Ling will be the leader. After all, I’m part of the organization, so it’s not convenient for me to make an appearance.”

Xia Ling laughed and said,”understood!” Young master Tian, this kind of rich man probably hasn’t seen much of the world. Don’t be scared silly later ... Haha!”

Zhong Zixin also said in a sweet voice,”didn’t young master Tian say it?” In terms of momentum, we have to gain the upper hand. Although this rich man doesn’t have much power, the things he has made are still not bad. If we didn’t come, he wouldn’t have been able to hold on for long ...”

“Zixin’s right!”Tian Xiaojun nodded. As long as everything goes well this time, we’ll distribute some of our shares after we return to the capital, and then we’ll sit at home and make a lot of money!”

“Why do you want to give it away?” Xia Ling asked.

Tian Xiaojun turned around and gave him a knock on the head, saying,”Nonsense, do you think the few of us can keep the shares? Don’t you know how deep the water is in the capital? We’re lucky this time. The few people in the upper – Class circle didn’t notice this small company. When the time comes, we’ll take the initiative to get close to it and get a share of the profits. Not only can we keep our way to wealth, but we might even be able to get into that circle ...”

At this point, Tian Xiaojun couldn’t help but reveal a look of fascination. Xia Tian and Zhong Zixin were also the same, their faces full of anticipation.

In the eyes of these mediocre second – generation children, the circle of the top rich and powerful was like a Holy Land that they yearned for.

Tian Xiaojun and the others did not know that the “rich man” they were about to “negotiate” with was someone who could call the big shots in the top rich and powerful circle his brothers.

One could not blame Tian Xiaojun and the others for not having access to information.

The social circle in Beijing was like this. If you were in this circle, you would naturally know some news. However, people like Tian Xiaojun, who were not qualified to be in this circle, had no way of grasping this information at all. Even if it was just a topic of conversation between song Rui and the others after a meal, it was very high – end news that was worth bragging about to Tian Xiaojun and the others.

Qing He teahouse was not far from the Ling Ji private kitchen, so Tian Xiaojun and the others arrived in a short while.

“This place is not bad!” Tian Xiaojun entered the room and looked around. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Zhong Zixin also said with a smile,”I didn’t expect this rich man to know how to pick a place!” It seems like the three mountains aren’t as backward as we thought!”

Liu Zhe couldn’t help but curse silently,’behind your sister!’ The three mountains was the frontier of reform and opening up, okay?

“Welcome!” The hostess bowed slightly and asked,”do you have a reservation?”

Tian Xiaojun turned his body slightly and looked at Liu Zhe.

Liu Zhe could only smile bitterly. He stepped forward and said,””We’re here to look for Xia ruofei, President Xia. I called him and found out that he’s having a banquet here tonight. By the way, I’m Liu Zhe. ”

“Okay, please wait a moment,” the receptionist immediately replied.

Then, she went to the front desk to pick up the walkie – talkie and reported the situation to the waiter in the private room so that he could ask Xia ruofei for instructions.

Zhong Zixin couldn’t help but Mutter, the rules are quite big!

Tian Xiaojun looked at Zhong Zixin sternly and said, “Don’t say such strange things! Remember, we’re here to talk about business today. Although we need to be imposing, it’ll be even better if we can make money in harmony!”

“I know, young master Tian!” Zhong Zixin said, unconcerned.

The receptionist finished her conversation very quickly and walked over.””I’ve already confirmed with director Xia. Please follow me!”

Xia ruofei received Liu Zhe’s message on WeChat. He did not know whether to laugh or cry.

However, in order to not put Liu Zhe in a difficult position, he decided to meet the three hotheaded men who had flown over from the capital city in a hurry to eat the “meat of the Chinese monk.”

He understood the way these guys did things. Once they saw benefits, they would gather around like sharks that smelled blood. Even if they avoided him today, they would still cling onto him like sticky candy.

It was better to deal with them all at once. Otherwise, these people might not be able to accomplish anything, but they would definitely do something bad.

Xia ruofei smiled at Ling Qingxue, who was making tea, and said,””My friend will bring a few people over for a discussion. You don’t have to say anything, I’ll handle it ...”

“An evil guest?” Ling Qingxue was stunned.

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”not really!” They’re just a few hotheaded youths, let them stumble a few times and they’ll know the immensity of the heavens and earth. ”

“Alright, I’ll just watch the show then ...” Ling Qingxue pursed her lips and smiled.

The two of them chatted for a while. Xia ruofei heard footsteps coming from the courtyard outside. Soon, someone knocked on the door of the private room.

Just as he was about to call out for them to come in, the door of the private room was pushed open. Tian Xiaojun walked in first, with Zhong Zixin and Xia Ling on either side, like loyal lackeys.

On the other hand, Liu Zhe was half a step behind. He threw an apologetic look at Xia ruofei the moment he entered the room.
