Chapter 1531: The girl’s Secret (2)

Translator: 549690339

In the stone room of the cave, Song Wei slowly raised her left hand and held the phone up to one of her fingers ...

After trying it a few times, he successfully unlocked the phone when he reached the index finger of his right hand.

Xia ruofei put his hand into his pocket and took out his phone from the spirit map space. He held it in his hand and then took it out of his pocket.

He took a look at the battery and realized that there was only about 10% left. Luckily, Song Wei was using an iPhone, which was the same as his phone charger. This saved Xia ruofei the trouble of rummaging through song Wei’s luggage for the charger.

Xia ruofei reached into his bag and took out his charger from the spirit map.

Every seat in the VIP lounge had a charging socket. Xia ruofei plugged in the charger and charged Song Wei’s phone as he checked.

As expected, there were more than Ten New Messages from Song Wei.

Xia ruofei opened it and browsed through it quickly. Some of them were probably from his friends or classmates. He did not reply to messages like Yingying a few days later. It would not be a problem even if he did not reply.

There were three other messages from a person named “mother.”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows and open the chat window.

“Wei Wei, be careful when you travel! Also, it’s cold in the South these two days. Don’t catch a cold!”

“This girl, she doesn’t even reply to her mom’s WeChat messages when she’s out playing?”

“Wei Wei, why aren’t you replying?”

The three messages were sent at different times. The first one was sent at Teno’ clock the night before, the second one at nineo’ clock the day before, and the last one at eighto’ clock the night before.

Judging from the text, Song Wei’s mother was already worried when she sent the last message.

Xia ruofei was a meticulous person. He looked through the chat history and found that Song Wei had naughtily called her mother “mother” in WeChat.

“Thank God I didn’t reply to her just now. If not, Song Wei’s mother would be suspicious ...” Xia ruofei broke out in a cold sweat.

He mimicked Song Wei’s tone and replied to her message. The gist of it was that he was in Xiang Nan Province with his University classmate, Xu Yuan Yuan. They went to the mountains for a trip yesterday and their cell phone had no signal.

Song Wei’s mother replied in a second. She sounded like she was complaining that Song Wei had too much fun outside and wanted her to go home early.

Xia ruofei had no choice but to reply, saying that he was traveling to Dian province with his classmates. The plane was about to take off and the stewardess had asked to turn off her phone.

Xia ruofei’s information was half – true and half – false. Even if he used his phone to locate her, there would be no flaws.

Xia ruofei was about to turn off Song Wei’s phone after he replied.

He sighed. This was not a long – term solution. He had to help Song Wei recover from her soul injury as soon as possible. Otherwise, her family would definitely be suspicious in a few days.

Just as Xia ruofei was about to turn off his phone, his hand accidentally touched the note icon on the home screen.

Before Xia ruofei could react, the notebook had already opened.

Xia ruofei quickly reached out and wanted to close it. After all, this could be a private message from Song Wei. It was not appropriate to open it on his own.

However, he still saw the content on the screen from the corner of his eye. His finger that was already on the home button paused for a moment and he didn’t press it.

It seemed to be Song Wei’s diary. She had written it three days ago, so it should be the most recent one.

“I’m going to Yuezhou with that guy tomorrow. He actually found out the location of the ancient tomb from Xu Yuanyuan’s husband. But ... He’s so smart, how can he not see my feelings for him? Do men become slow when it comes to this kind of question? Sigh ... No matter what, I’m really looking forward to going through an adventure with him ...”

Xia ruofei was dumbfounded. No matter how slow he was, he could tell what the girl’s Secret was.

He was stunned for a few seconds, then he hurriedly closed the notebook and quickly cleaned up the background. He didn’t even bother to charge the phone and sent the phone back into the spirit map space like a child who accidentally got into trouble.

Then, Xia ruofei sat on the sofa in a daze, his mind in a mess.

It was the hardest to enjoy a Beauty’s favor. Whether it was Lu You or Song Wei, or even Lu You’s cute best friend Jiang Yue, they were all rare beauties. However, to Xia ruofei, this represented a lot of love debts.

Especially Song Wei. If things were the same as before and they didn’t interact much, Xia ruofei wouldn’t have any psychological burden.

However, the current situation was that Song Wei had gone through so much danger with him in the underground palace because of him. In the end, because he did not take good care of her, the two of them were separated and Song Wei’s soul was damaged.

Xia ruofei was already filled with guilt. Now that he had accidentally discovered Song Wei’s Secret, he felt even worse.

Xia ruofei had been sitting there in a daze. He did not even hear the announcement that the flight to Hongzhou had started boarding. It was only when a waiter in the VIP lounge came to remind him that he woke up from his dream and quickly got up to go to the gate.

Soon, Xia ruofei boarded the plane through the covered bridge. As he sat in the first – Class cabin and waited for the plane to take off, he was more anxious than ever.

Xia ruofei had also made up his mind. No matter how much Jade he needed to upgrade the realm, he would buy it at all costs, even if it meant that he had to clear all his assets!

The Airbus A320 he was on was finally allowed to take off. After taxiing to the end of the runway, it stopped for a while and quickly accelerated to take off.

After about two hours of flight, the flight landed smoothly on the runway of Hongzhou airport at around 12 noon.

Xia ruofei carried a simple backpack and walked out of the departure hall.

As soon as they walked out of the restricted area, Xia ruofei saw a man in his thirties with a crew cut holding an A4 paper with his name printed on it.

Hence, Xia ruofei walked over quickly. Before he could say anything, a middle – aged man with a big belly next to buzzcut smiled and asked,””You must be Mr. Xia ruofei!”

“I am.” Xia ruofei looked at the middle – aged man and asked,”you must be President Yu!”

“I’m Yu mingdong. Mr. Xia, please take care of me!” The fat middle – aged man smiled like a Maitreya Buddha and even handed over his business card with both hands.

Xia ruofei took the name card and smiled gently.””I don’t dare! I’ve decided to buy a batch of Jade at the last minute, so I’ve caused you trouble!”

“Where? It’s just a small matter since Chairman MA has personally instructed it. ” Yu mingdong quickly said politely,”Mr. Xia, let’s go to Ruizhou first! The car is just outside!”

“Alright, I’ll listen to President Yu’s arrangements when we’re here.” Xia ruofei said.

The three of them walked out of the airport together. On the way to the parking lot, Xia ruofei and Yu mingdong had a brief chat. He found out that the man with the crew cut was called Shi Lei. He was Yu mingdong’s driver and bodyguard. He was also a retired Special Forces soldier and was very skilled.

Yu Ming Dong smiled and said,”this area is close to the border. The people here are tougher. Some places are even quite chaotic. I will feel more at ease with Lei Zi.”

In fact, almost all of the Jade owners who came to Dian province brought bodyguards with them. On the one hand, rich people cherished their lives more, and on the other hand, Ruizhou and Hongzhou were really chaotic.

Yu mingdong brought a Mercedes – Benz business car over. After the three of them got in the car, Yu mingdong smiled and said,””Mr. Xia, it’s time for lunch. I’ve made a reservation at the Junhao hotel in Hongzhou city. How about we have a simple meal before going to Ruizhou?”

Xia ruofei didn’t want to have these social events, but it was indeed almost oneo’ clock. He couldn’t let Yu mingdong and Shi Lei accompany him on the road, right?

“Then I’ll have to trouble you, director Yu,” he said with a slight nod. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Xia ruofei continued.”Director Yu, I need this batch of Jade materials urgently. Can you take me to the supplier directly after dinner?”
