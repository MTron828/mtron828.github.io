2961 The battle between two tigers (1)

In room 20, Xia ruofei smiled and said,””This is the correct way to auction! There’s no such thing as a one – shot deal!”

Li Yifu also laughed and said,””Grand uncle – Master, it seems like the popularity of the Qi gathering pill is even better than we expected!”

Xia ruofei nodded.”I think we can consider doing business with Chi – amassing pills in the future. However, it must be done under the premise of safety.”

“Master!” Luo Qingfeng quickly replied,”the star Seizer sect can provide the sales channels!” If master needs anything, please let this old servant know at any time!”

Xia ruofei glanced at Luo Qingfeng and said,””The star Seizer sect might not be able to take in such a huge business! If the star Seizer sect could continuously sell these Qi gathering pills, it would definitely attract the attention of the top sects! By that time, even a fool would know that you’ve mastered the refining method of the Qi – gathering pill. By then, with the star picking sect’s strength, would they be able to maintain the sales channels of the Qi – gathering pill? He might even be forced to ask about the refining technique! An ordinary man’s possession of a jade ring is his sin!”

“I’m sorry,” Luo Qingfeng said with a look of shame.”I’ve thought too simply of this matter ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”let’s see!” There was no hurry! There was no lack of cultivation resources at the moment, so there was no need to take risks. If he really wanted to do business in the Qi gathering pill industry, he could think of a way to make the star Seizer sect stronger first! Let’s develop ourselves first, then we’ll amaze the world with a single brilliant feat!”

“Wretched development?” Qingfeng Luo naturally did not understand the game language, so he could not help but ask in confusion.

In fact, even Li Yifu didn’t understand the word, but he could understand what Xia ruofei meant by the words.

Xia ruofei chuckled.”It’s to secretly expand our strength. When we have the ability to protect the sales channels and refining methods of the Qi – gathering pills, we’ll start to sell them openly!”

“Yes! This old servant understands!” “Thank you, master!” Luo Qingfeng was overjoyed and quickly said.

Xia ruofei’s willingness to help the star Seizer sect improve its strength was naturally a good thing for Luo Qingfeng.

Although the soul seal made Luo Qingfeng absolutely loyal to Xia ruofei, it did not destroy his mind. Other than his absolute obedience to Xia ruofei, there was no change in other aspects. Luo Qingfeng had entered the star Seizer sect since he was young and was currently the sect master of the star Seizer sect. Naturally, he had deep feelings for the sect. Besides, he knew that Xia ruofei’s background was unfathomable. If Xia ruofei was willing to help the star Seizer sect, even if he only revealed a little bit of it, it would be enough to make the star Seizer sect look brand new.

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”don’t thank me yet!” This was only one of the backup plans. In addition, even if we’re determined to increase the strength of the starseizer sect, we’ll have to make sure to select the most reliable of people, so as to avoid the information being leaked if we don’t do a good job. ”

“Yes! This old servant understands!” Luo Qingfeng said quickly.

As the three of them chatted, the second bottle of Qi gathering pills was auctioned off with a few more rounds of bids. It was all the bidding between the 5th and 6th box.

The two parties seemed to be at loggerheads with each other, neither giving way to the other. Every time they raised the bid, they followed the minimum bid of 40 spirit stones.

Even so, after a few rounds of bidding, the price of the bottle of Qi gathering pills had reached 2520 spirit stones. The bidder was the cultivator from Room 6.

Xia ruofei didn’t know that the person sitting in the sixth private room was the cultivator from the soaring Flower Valley whom they had met once in the elevator. However, no matter who was sitting in the private room, as long as the price was going up, Xia ruofei would welcome them with open arms.

In box six, Yu xiner said uneasily,””Master, we’ve already competed for a few rounds. Why don’t we give up first? Don’t ruin master’s plans ...”

Liu Mansha said calmly,”it’s fine. This is just a small fight!” This amount of spiritual stones is nothing to us or the Black Dragon cult. What I’m more curious about is what the black Dragon cult is trying to do. Are they really interested in this pill?”

“We can’t rule out that possibility!” Willow said from the side, ” the quality of the Qi gathering pill this time is excellent. For Qi refinement cultivators, it is indeed an excellent choice to assist in cultivation. I heard that Zhou bingxuan accepted a disciple in the secular world a few years ago, and he has an extremely high talent for cultivation. He even intends to let this disciple inherit his mantle. It’s just that the current cultivation environment is truly too harsh, so his genius disciple’s cultivation progress has always been unsatisfactory.”

Liu Mansha couldn’t help but glance at Yu xiner. She pouted and said, ” “Genius disciple? Could her talent be higher than Xin’ er’s? Taking in disciples at this time was the risk of drawing water with a wicker basket! No matter how talented he was, he couldn’t be cultivated without a huge amount of resources! The Black Dragon cult’s Foundation isn’t enough for him to mess around with!”

When Yu Xin’ er heard this from the side, she had mixed feelings in her heart. She was more or less embarrassed. She had also used up a lot of resources from the flying flower Valley all these years, and even some senior sisters had been quite critical of her. However, Liu Mansha was very determined to support her. This made her feel very touched, but at the same time, she couldn’t help but feel a little terrified. She knew that Liu Mansha had high hopes for her, and she was afraid that it would end up like what Liu Mansha had said, with all her efforts being in vain.

Liu Mansha seemed to have read Yu xiner’s mind. She said calmly, ” “Xin’ er, I’m not talking about you, don’t think too much. You’re different from that so-called genius disciple of the Black Dragon cult. As long as you persist in cultivating on the right path, your final achievements will definitely not be lower than mine! If the same resources were used on other disciples, they might only be able to reach the seventh or eighth Qi layer at most. But you, you have the hope of breaking through to the Jindan stage!”

Yu Xin’ er’s heart warmed and she quickly said, ” “Yes! This disciple understands! Thank you, master!”

“Is ... Is the Black Dragon cult going crazy?” Yang Liu cried out.

Liu Mansha frowned and looked at the big screen below. The highest bid had been updated. It was from Room 5, which was Zhou bingxuan from the Black Dragon cult, at 2800 spiritual stones.

Zhou bingxuan had changed his previous method of only increasing the bid by 40 spirit stones each time, and directly increased the bid by 280 spirit stones on the basis of Liu Mansha’s bid.

Liu Mansha sneered and said,”is this old man trying to show his determination to win?” Was 2800 spirit stones a lot? Who would be scared?”

After saying that, Liu Mansha immediately submitted a new bid. This time, she did not simply increase the bid by 40 spiritual stones. Instead, she manually entered the bid of 3000 spiritual stones into the bidding machine and pressed the submit button without hesitation.

Yu Xin ‘er didn’t dare to say anything else. She felt that the price was a little too high.

3000 spirit stones for 20 Chi – amassing pills was not as good as using spirit stones for cultivation! The total amount of spirit Qi would definitely be more than the Qi – gathering pill.

However, it could not be calculated that way. 20 Chi – amassing pills could be used up in less than a month, but 3000 spirit stones would take at least a few months to use up with the absorption rate of Qi refining cultivators. In addition, the spiritual Qi in the Chi – amassing pills was purer and the conversion efficiency was higher. The cultivation effect of the two might be similar, but it would save several times the time.

In room 20, Xia ruofei was still calm. On the other hand, Luo Qingfeng and Li Yifu were so excited that their eyes were wide open. They clenched their fists tightly and stared at the big screen.

At this moment, a rough voice came from Room 5,””Valley Head Liu, there are still four bottles of Chi – amassing pills. Why do we have to fight to the death and let the person who entrusted it to be auctioned off take advantage of it? Why don’t you give this old man some face and let Valley master Liu fight for the remaining three bottles?”

Liu Mansha snorted. Since Zhou bingxuan had already exposed her, she didn’t intend to hide her identity anymore. She said directly,”This is exactly what I wanted to say to sect Master Zhou! Since there are still four bottles of Qi gathering pills, why don’t you go fight for the remaining three bottles, sect Master Zhou?”

“You ...” Zhou bingxuan was angry for a moment,”my disciple is at a bottleneck in his cultivation and needs Qi gathering pills to help him cultivate. Valley master Liu is already a master in the middle stage of the Golden core, what’s the use of this Qi gathering pill?”

“You’re the only one who’s allowed to have disciples?” Liu Mansha said coldly,”I have taken in several genius disciples! They also need Qi gathering pills. ”

“Valley master Liu, do you really have to do this?” Zhou bingxuan asked gloomily.

Liu Mansha smiled and said,”I’ve already made a bid!” If sect Master Zhou wanted to compete, then he’d have to raise the price! Maybe this is the highest price I’ve ever offered. If you add another 40 spirit stones, I’ll give up!”

Zhou bingxuan snorted coldly and didn’t say anything else. Apparently, he was also quite angry.

In the private room, Yang Liu chuckled and said,”Senior Sister!” It was so carefree! This Zhou bingxuan was so arrogant that he thought everyone had to give him face! When has our flying flower Valley ever been afraid of others?”

“Junior Sister yang, we’re prepared to give up on this round of bidding,” Liu Mansha said calmly.

Yang Liu was stunned and asked in confusion,””Release ...”

Before she could finish her sentence, Zhou bingxuan, who was in the room next door, raised the price again. However, he didn’t seem to lose his mind and directly added 40 spirit stones to the base price of 3000, raising the price to 3040 spirit stones.

On the other hand, Liu Mansha raised the price again without hesitation, and she raised the price to 3100 spiritual stones in one go.

Seeing this, Willow was even more confused. She clearly said that Liu Mansha was going to give up! Why was it still increasing, and by so much at once!

Zhou bingxuan, who was sitting next door, was also greatly agitated. He gritted his teeth in anger and directly increased the price to 3200 spirit stones, ignoring the persuasion of the elder beside him.

When the price was displayed on the big screen, Liu Mansha clearly heaved a sigh of relief.

She said in a relaxed tone,””It seems that the rich and overbearing sect Master Zhou is determined to get this bottle of Qi gathering pills! As the saying goes, a gentleman doesn’t take what others like. Although we are little girls, we might as well imitate a gentleman! We’ll give up this bottle of Qi gathering pills!”

Afterwards, Liu Mansha even “considerately” said to Hao Qingsong, who was on the main auction stage,”Elder Hao! Our soaring Flower Valley will give up. If there are no other fellow Daoists bidding, you can announce the end of this round of bidding!”

No matter how irrational Zhou bingxuan was, he had already realized that he had been tricked by Liu Mansha to raise the price from the Black Dragon cult. Liu Mansha had no intention of competing for this bottle of Chi – amassing pills, but she kept raising the price with a look of determination. Her goal was naturally to make the Black Dragon cult spend more spiritual stones.

Under Liu Mansha’s provocation, Zhou bingxuan really fell for it. 3200 spirit stones for 20 Chi – amassing pills was equivalent to 160 spirit stones for each pill. This price was obviously a little outrageous. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

...

At this moment, Hao Qingsong was a little embarrassed, but he still dutifully inquired a few times. Seeing that there was indeed no one else competing for this bottle of Qi gathering pills, he loudly announced,”Congratulations to fellow Daoist Zhou from the fifth private room for winning this bottle of gathering Qi pills!”

Although he said congratulations, Zhou bingxuan felt that it was a little harsh.

Of course, for Hao Qingsong, this was just a routine. He immediately gestured for the staff to come up on stage and take the bottle of Qi gathering pills, and then hand it over to Zhou bingxuan in Private Room 5.
