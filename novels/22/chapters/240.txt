Chapter 241: Chief Xiao makes his move (1)

The person Xia ruofei thought of was Tian Huilan’s Secretary, Xiao Mei. After Wu Liqian was transferred to the deputy head of Changping County, Xiao Mei, who used to work in the first Secretary Department of the general office of the Sanshan Municipal Party Committee, took over her position and became Tian Huilan’s full – time Secretary. After Xiao Mei took office, Tian Huilan specifically asked Xiao Mei to take the initiative to give Xia ruofei her contact information so that Xia ruofei could find her at any time if he needed help. Xiao Mei picked up the phone after two rings and said,””Hello, Mr. Xia!” Compared to Wu Liqian’s relaxed and casual attitude when she was with Xia ruofei, Xiao Mei’s attitude was more respectful. She even used the honorific “you”. This was because Xiao Mei knew that Xia ruofei not only held a high position in Tian Huilan’s heart, but he also had a deep relationship with the former core leader, elder song. The last time they went to Hongzhou, Xiao Mei had accompanied Tian Huilan and had personally witnessed Xia ruofei’s amazing performance. Therefore, even though Xia ruofei was very young, Xiao Mei did not dare to neglect him. “Hello, chief Xiao!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I have something to trouble you with today.” After Xiao Mei became Tian Huilan’s Secretary, she was also appointed as the Deputy Director of the Secretary Department. Of course, the general office of the three mountains Municipal Party Committee was a Deputy – Level structure, so Xiao Mei’s Deputy Director was actually only at the level of a Section Chief. “Mr. Xia, please go ahead.” Xiao Mei quickly said. “It’s like this. Isn’t the general office of the municipal Party Committee recently re – bidding for designated reception units? My friend’s hotel is also competing for it. ” Xia ruofei went straight to the point.”Her hotel was newly built in the second half of last year. It’s almost a five – Star hotel and the hardware is definitely up to standard. However, it was rejected in the first round and was not shortlisted for the final bid. That’s why I’d like to ask director Xiao to help me understand the situation. Is there any misunderstanding?” “No problem, I’ll go and ask immediately,” Xiao Mei immediately replied. Mr. Xia, what’s the name of your friend’s hotel?” “Lingyun hotel is a subsidiary of the lingji food and beverage group.” Xia ruofei said. Xiao Mei quickly wrote down the name of the hotel Xia ruofei mentioned on a piece of paper and said,””Alright, Mr. Xia. I’ll call and ask now. I’ll report to you later.” “I don’t deserve a report!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”sorry to trouble you, chief Xiao.” “You’re too polite. ” Xiao Mei said. After hanging up, Xia ruofei saw that Ling Qingxue had brought the dishes over. He walked over and said with a smile,””Let’s eat, let’s eat!” Ling Qingxue glanced at Xia ruofei and teased,””Finished your call? Did you find a state or a Minister?” “You don’t have to worry about that ...” Xia ruofei chuckled.”Anyway, I’ll definitely help you with this.” “Yo, yo, yo ... You’re quite bold!” Ling Qingxue smiled and said,”don’t blow your own trumpet when the time comes!” “Just wait and see!” Xia ruofei said confidently. The two of them sat down and started eating. On the municipal Party committee’s side, Xiao Mei finished Xia ruofei’s call. After thinking for a while, she immediately picked up the phone on the desk and called Wang Xiao from the general office of the municipal Party Committee. Wang Xiao and Xiao Mei were admitted into the general office of the municipal Party Committee at the same time. One was in the Secretariat, and the other was in the general office. They had a good personal relationship. After Xiao Mei was chosen as Tian Huilan’s Secretary, she was promoted to the Deputy Director of the first Secretary Department. Her rank was up to the main section, while Wang Xiao was still the Deputy Director, a Deputy section level. Therefore, when Wang Xiao received Xiao Mei’s phone call, his attitude was much more enthusiastic than usual, and he even had a little more flattery. “Secretary Xiao, how are you?” Wang Xiao asked,”I wonder what instructions the leader has for me?” Xiao Mei smiled and said,”I wouldn’t dare to call it an order. I have something I want to ask you about. The bidding of the municipal Party committee’s designated reception unit was handled by your General Administration, right?” “Yeah!” Wang Xiao immediately replied. The shortlisted list for the primary selection is basically finalized, and the bidding will be held soon. I’ve been busy with this recently! Secretary Xiao, is there any hotel that needs my special attention?” They were all people in the system, so they naturally knew what was going on. In this day and age, people with connections would greet each other through various channels. Xiao Mei was now a popular person in the general office of the municipal Party Committee. If she spoke, Wang Xiao would definitely be happy to make friends. Xiao Mei pondered for a moment and said,”Wang Xiao, it’s like this. I have a friend who owns a hotel that is more than a four – Star hotel. The facilities are also relatively new. However, it was eliminated in the preliminaries without any warning. Can you help me understand the situation and see what happened?” “No problem, Secretary Xiao,” Wang Xiao said readily.”Tell me the name of the hotel and I’ll get it done!” Wang Xiao was also criticizing in his heart,’is there a need to say this? They must have been squeezed out by other hotels with powerful backgrounds! Why didn’t he use his strong relationship with Secretary Xiao earlier? He only remembered it after he was eliminated ... “Thank you! Wang Xiao. ” Xiao Mei smiled and said,”that hotel is called Lingyun hotel. I’ll be troubling you then!” Wang Xiao was still smiling at first, but when he heard the words “Lingyun hotel”, he couldn’t help but freeze and let out an “ah” subconsciously. Xiao Mei frowned and asked,”what’s wrong?” Wang Xiao, are you in any trouble?” “Chief Xiao, I really can’t help you with this ...” Wang Xiao said with a bitter smile. “I see ...” Xiao Mei said thoughtfully.”It’s okay, just point me in the right direction ...” Xiao Mei wasn’t a newbie who had just started work. She knew that the higher – ups must have informed them about this. Wang Xiao, who was only in charge of the specific tasks, naturally couldn’t help. As expected, Wang Xiao lowered his voice and said,””Chief Xiao, Secretary Lin personally asked about this ...” I understand. Thank you, Wang Xiao!” Xiao Mei said. “Please don’t say that,” Wang Xiao quickly said.”I didn’t help you. I’m sorry!” “The information you provided me with is very important. I’m already very grateful.” Xiao Mei smiled and said,”I’ll treat you to a meal some other day!” “Alright! Then I won’t be polite!” Wang Xiao let out a sigh of relief and smiled. After hanging up the phone, Xiao Mei sat down and thought for a while. She then stood up, pushed the door open, and walked toward the office of the municipal Deputy Secretary General, Lin Wanshui. Lin Wanshui was the head of the general office, so Xiao Mei naturally couldn’t call him to talk about this matter. This was the most basic courtesy in the system. Of course, Xiao Mei could also choose to report directly to Tian Huilan. Not to mention the preliminary list, even directly deciding on a final spot was just a matter of a few words to Tian Huilan. However, this matter was too small. If she troubled the leader for everything, it would inevitably leave the impression that she was incompetent. Xiao Mei felt that this matter was still within her ability to coordinate, so she decided to go and find Lin Wanshui herself. Soon, she arrived at the door of Lin Wanshui’s office. Xiao Mei tidied up her appearance, then raised her hand and knocked on the door ...Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m
