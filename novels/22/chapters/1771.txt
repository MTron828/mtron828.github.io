Chapter 1772: Gao Jun’s invitation (2)

Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows and smiled.”Oh? What do you need my support for? It couldn’t be that he was going to provide peach blossom vegetables and peach blossom Da Hong Pao, right? That shouldn’t be a problem, right? We’ve already come to an agreement!” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Zhao Yongjun and the others laughed.

Gao Jun shook his head with a smile and said,””Mr. Xia, I hope to invite you to participate in the recording of the first episode as a guest. In my design, you will be the only guest for the first episode!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be dumbfounded.””Me? Participating in a variety show?”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,””Gaotai, forget it ... I’m not a star and I don’t have any acting experience. Aren’t you afraid that I’ll make a bad opening for the next season of your show and even completely destroy it?”

Gao Jun smiled and said,”President Xia, why aren’t you a big star?” Don’t forget, you’re still in the top ten most searched topics on Weibo! In this era, those who had traffic, and a large amount of traffic at that, were considered celebrities! Besides, President Xia’s character is too positive. On top of that, his image is also very good. He’s definitely the best candidate for our show’s guest!”

At this point, Gao Jun paused slightly, took a sip of fruit juice to moisten his throat, and continued,””As for the stage performance experience that President Xia mentioned, that’s not a problem at all. The purpose of our show is to restore the real leisurely life. Just treat it as a day at a friend’s house. If you’ve watched this season’s show, you should know that we didn’t just invite celebrities from the entertainment industry. One of the episodes even invited an Olympic champion and a Winter Olympic champion! That episode was also very outstanding!”

Xia ruofei instinctively rejected anything about showing his face in public, but he still said,””No, no, no! I really can’t do this. Gaotai, you’d better find someone else!”

“President Xia, you’re the one and only person in my mind who can guarantee a good start!” Gao Jun said. “We pay the appearance fee for the guests who participate in the show. It’s not lower than our budget ...”

“Gaotai, it’s not a problem of money ...” Xia ruofei said helplessly.

At this time, song Rui said with a smile,””Ruofei, I think director Gao’s suggestion is not bad! I’m looking forward to it just thinking about it!”

Zhao Yongjun started to persuade Xia ruofei, but his analysis was more rational.””Ruofei, you should consider this invitation from the high platform. First of all, if you personally participate in the show, it will definitely be good for the placement of the advertisement. The audience would definitely have a deep impression of it! Second, this is also very beneficial for you to maintain the popularity of your fans. The internet favors the new over the old. Although you’re very popular online now, who knows, after a while, everyone’s interest might change. When that time comes, if you participate in such a high – rated variety show, and during the process of the show, the host will definitely talk to you about the forced decline, which is equivalent to giving the audience a deeper memory!”

Xia ruofei forced a smile and said,”brother Zhao, why do I need to maintain my popularity?” I’m running a company, not an artiste!”

Zhao Yongjun laughed and said,”why don’t you try saying that to your company’s CEO Feng?” Who said that entrepreneurs didn’t need to maintain their popularity? Big entrepreneurs like Beijing’s President Liu and heavenly cat’s President Ma still had to show their faces and make their presence known from time to time! You have a unique advantage now because of the Quto incident. If you don’t maintain this advantage, it will easily cool down the enthusiasm. Will your company’s team agree?”

I definitely can’t agree to it! Otherwise, Feng Jing, Dong Yun, and Guan Ping would not have been in such a hurry to post something on Xia ruofei’s verified Weibo.

Xia ruofei knew this as well. He agreed with Zhao Yongjun’s idea of better placement of advertisements to deepen the audience’s impression. He was also a little tempted.

However, Xia ruofei still had some reservations about appearing on television.

After thinking for a long time, Xia ruofei finally said,””Gaotai, please let me consider this! Anyway, there’s still quite a long time before the official recording of your show. Even if I can’t participate, I Won’t Hold You Back from looking for guests for your show. ”

Gao Jun nodded with a smile and said,””No problem. I just hope that you’ll consider my suggestion. I think that director Zhao’s analysis is very reasonable.”

“I’ll think about it,”Xia ruofei nodded.

Zhao Yongjun and song Rui exchanged a look, then tacitly took out their phones and sent each other WeChat messages under the table.

“Brother Zhao, it seems like ruofei is a little indecisive!” Song Rui said.

“We have to add fuel to the fire, how can we miss out on such a good thing?” Zhao Yongjun said.

Song Rui,’I seriously agree! Actually, I already have an idea!”

Zhao Yongjun: “I have an idea too. Let’s not rush into it. Let’s type out our thoughts on our phones, then I’ll eat some food. I’ll put down my chopsticks and we’ll hit the send button at the same time!”

Song Rui said,’interesting! Let’s do this!”

Zhao quickly typed his thoughts into the WeChat input box, but he didn’t send it. Instead, he held his phone under the table with one hand and picked up a piece of black pepper beef with his right hand. He put it in his mouth and chewed as he put down his chopsticks.

At the same time, Zhao Yongjun and song Rui pressed the send button almost at the same time.

The two of them first looked down at each other’s answer, then looked up and smiled at each other.

Song Rui quickly sent a WeChat message to Zhao Yongjun.””Hahaha! Great minds think alike! Let’s do this! I’ll use the excuse of peeing to go out and settle this matter!”

Zhao Yongjun replied,”okay!” Xiao Rui, the organization has entrusted this glorious and arduous task to you! Don’t let down the organization’s expectations and trust!”

Song Rui casually sent Zhao Yongjun an emoji of the Eighth Route Army. In the emoji, a soldier of the Eighth Route Army was saluting, and in the blank space, there was the word “I promise to complete the mission”.

Zhao Yongjun grinned and winked at song Rui, then put away his phone without a word. Song Rui naturally put his phone back in his pocket and joined in the conversation.

In this era where the mobile internet was highly developed, almost everyone carried their mobile phones with them. It was common for people to look at WeChat and the news on their mobile phones while eating at all kinds of gatherings and dinner parties. Therefore, their actions did not attract anyone’s attention, including Xia ruofei.

The dinner ended at nearly 10 p.m. No one noticed that song Rui got up and left the room. He only returned after five or six minutes.

In the evening, Xia ruofei drank a total of more than two pounds of Drunken Eight Immortals white wine. Even Gao Jun, who had drunk much less than Xia ruofei, felt a little dizzy, but Xia ruofei was still fine.

Gao Jun was in awe of Xia ruofei’s alcohol tolerance. Before he left, he kept reminding Xia ruofei to consider his invitation.

Xia ruofei naturally agreed. After sending Gao Jun to the car, the few of them went back to their respective homes and found their mothers.

Song Rui and the others called their chauffeurs over, and some directly asked for the price.

Although Xia ruofei could use his true energy to force out all the alcohol, he still called Wu Qiang in advance so that his friends would not worry. He asked him to take a taxi to the private kitchen of the Prince’s Mansion and wait for orders.

So, after sending Gao Jun off, Xia ruofei quickly got into the land Rover and was driven back to the courtyard in liuhai Lane by Wu Qiang.

When the car reached the entrance of liuhai Lane, Xia ruofei’s phone rang.

Xia ruofei looked at the caller ID and mumbled to himself,””It’s so late, what’s President Feng calling me for?”

Xia ruofei answered the call with a smile,””Sister che, what’s the matter? Tell me first if it’s good news or bad news!”

“Ruofei, I heard that xiangnan TV has the intention to invite you to participate in the recording of the third season of the life you yearn for?” Feng Jing asked.
