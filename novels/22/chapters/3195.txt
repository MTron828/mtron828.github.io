Xia ruofei bade Wang Chi, Cai Songlin, and the others farewell and left the private room.

Wang Chi said to Cai Songlin,”director Cai, could we trouble central to send a car to take us to the airport?” We’ll leave at 9:30 sharp!”

Cai Songlin nodded his head and said,””No problem! No problem! Director Zhong, please make the arrangements!”

“Alright!” Director Zhong, who was in the general office, quickly replied. Then he took his mobile phone and walked out of the room to call the car team to send a car.

Earlier, when Xia ruofei was around, Cai Songlin did not ask too much. Now that Xia ruofei had left, he could not hold back his curiosity and asked,””Academician Wang, President Xia just said ... The flight crew called him? It should be the airline’s ground service staff, right? And ... The take – off time can be discussed?”

Wang Chi laughed and patted Cai Songlin’s shoulder, saying,””Xiao Cai! We should be more imaginative! President Xia was in a private jet, so wasn’t it the same as directly contacting the flight crew? Their take – off time is also more flexible. It’s based on the boarding time of the passengers!”

Cai Songlin was stunned for a moment, then he could not help but smile bitterly and said,””It’s true that poverty has limited my imagination!”

Wang Chi laughed and said,”don’t talk about you. This is also my first time taking a private jet. I’ve been to many places in my life. I’ve been abroad more than 30 times over the years! But when I came here yesterday, I really almost made a fool of myself ...”

“That’s not necessary!”Cai Songlin laughed.

……

Xia ruofei returned to his room in the guest house and told everyone about the upcoming schedule. Then, they got ready to leave.

In fact, they didn’t have much to prepare. Everyone basically had a storage magic treasure, and they were used to carrying all kinds of necessities when they went out. When they left, they just needed to pack their things.

There was still about an hour before they would set off. Hence, Xia ruofei discussed with everyone and decided to study the combination of numbers that seemed to be a music score in the guest house.

Xia ruofei’s suggestion received everyone’s agreement.

When the result of this combination of numbers came out today, it basically meant that they had taken a big step forward in cracking the five sages order or the rising Dragon Order. Now, everyone was itching to find the ultimate answer as soon as possible!

Hence, Xia ruofei took out his laptop and started to study it with the others.

Everyone was enthusiastically discussing.

” 1 to 7 means do to si. There should be no doubt about that.” Xia ruofei muttered.

Song Wei subconsciously hummed a tune based on this.

Xia ruofei frowned and asked,”then what does 0 mean?” A rest talisman?”

Song Wei was the first to discover that the array was suspected to be a score. She had a certain foundation in music theory, so she had more say in it.

After hearing Xia ruofei’s words, Song Wei shook her head and said,”I don’t think it’s possible because 0s have appeared too many times, and many of them are in the middle of a group of numbers. If it’s a pause, then the music is intermittent. Also, we saw that in a set of numbers, there would be two zeros in a row. Stop talismans shouldn’t be used like that ...”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”that makes sense. Then what does this 0 mean?” Weiwei, tell me! Everyone, share your thoughts and we’ll brainstorm!”

Liu Mansha smiled.”The Music Theory I know is all about Gong Shang and jiao yu. I don’t know anything about these tadpole – like numbers!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”the five tones are connected!” As long as it’s related to music theory, everyone can talk about it so that we can inspire each other!”

Liu Mansha smiled and nodded, but did not say anything. It was obvious that she did not have any constructive opinions for the time being.

Xia ruofei didn’t force her and continued,””Then, Wei Wei, tell me your opinion.”

“What I said might not be right, it’s just a guess ...” Song Wei said after some thought.

“It’s okay, just tell me what you think. ” Liu Mansha smiled and said,”there’s no difference in seniority or cultivation level here. Everyone, please speak your mind!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”that’s right!” There are specializations in every profession! Not to mention, it was a brainstorming now. Who knew, someone might have a good idea when the inspiration came! It has nothing to do with cultivation!”

“Then I’ll tell you!” Song Wei said,”I don’t think it’s a rest talisman. Could it be a beat?” Let’s assume that the number ” 0″ represents a delay of one beat, then it seems that the whole song will be much smoother!” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

After she finished, Song Wei even hummed a few lines. As expected, everyone could clearly feel that the first few lines were smoother and more pleasant to the ear.

Xia ruofei slapped his thigh and said,”what Wei Wei said is quite possible!” The song was obviously smoother! And I feel that this song is really melodious. I’ve never heard such a song before. It’s like heavenly music!”

Chen Xuan and the rest nodded their heads in agreement. Just the first few lines of Song Wei’s song and Song Wei’s soft humming of the song were enough to stir the hearts of everyone.

Of course, this also made everyone even more excited. The more complex the song was, the higher the possibility that they had chosen the right path. They were also closer to solving the secret of the floating point image on the token.
