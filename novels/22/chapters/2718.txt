Li Yifu thought for a while and said,”grand uncle – Master, I’ve carefully thought over the first half of the plan. There shouldn’t be any major problems.” As long as the other party didn’t know that Wang Boshan and Zheng Yongshou had changed sides, they definitely wouldn’t have such a big defense. Furthermore, as an Aurous core stage cultivator, they definitely had this confidence. The only thing we can’t control is ... We don’t know if Qingfeng Luo will come alone. After all, he’s here to take over the Peach Blossom Island. After that, he still needs to carry out the island’s construction. He might even move the entire sect here. There are many things that he can’t do alone. ”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,””This is indeed a problem, but it’s something we can’t control. “And according to my judgment, the possibility of Qingfeng Luo coming alone is very high. From his previous style of doing things, he should be a cautious person. With his personality, he probably won’t let this news spread unless he’s already completely in control of the Peach Blossom Island. ”

Xia ruofei paused for a moment, and his thoughts became clearer. He said,”According to our information, apart from Luo Qingfeng, the only other person in the star Seizer sect who has studied arrays is Zheng Yongshou. The purpose of Luo Qingfeng’s trip this time is to activate the array. There is no point in bringing the rest of the sect along. He can activate the array and then start laying out the plans for the island’s construction. After all, for a cultivator, as long as they can control the array, the star Seizer sect will basically have complete control over the Peach Blossom Island. It was also difficult to find a breakthrough. But before that, it was hard to say. He would probably continue to block the news. So ... I think it’s highly possible that Luo Qingfeng came alone!”

Li Yifu thought about it carefully for a while and said with an expression of admiration,””Martial granduncle’s words are reasonable!”

Then, Li Yifu frowned and said,””Martial granduncle, although this disciple has some apprehensions about the first half of the plan, I don’t think there will be any problems on the whole. “As for the second half ... I feel that there’s a lot of uncertainties ... After all, Luo Qingfeng is a cultivator at the Golden core stage. We’ve never encountered cultivators at this level. Their strength and means may exceed our expectations. In addition ... According to Zheng Yongshou, the person with the highest level of array Dao in the sect is Luo Qingfeng. Thus, I’m worried that the Taixu xuanqing formation won’t be able to trap him ...”

Xia ruofei smiled.”If that’s the case, I’m afraid we’ll have to be prepared to fight to the death ... Of course, when facing an early golden core cultivator, we might not even have the capital to fight to the death. We might not even have the chance to escape ... The worst case scenario is that neither of us can escape and we’ll stay here forever ... I’m mentally prepared for that.”

Li Yifu’s expression changed as he said,”senior granduncle, I’ve already put my life and death aside!” “However, if there is really a problem, I hope that senior granduncle can escape decisively. Although my cultivation is low, I will do my best to stall Luo Qingfeng. Even if I can buy one more second, I am willing to do so!” But ... Nothing must happen to senior granduncle, otherwise ... Our sect’s legacy will be broken!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”adopted husband, you don’t have to be so tragic. I’ve said it. That’s the worst outcome.” We should always consider the most difficult things in everything we do. This is the right attitude, but it shouldn’t affect our confidence. ” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Xia ruofei looked confident and continued,””In fact, I’m very confident in the Taixu xuanqing formation. It’s still unknown how much of an effect Luo Qingfeng’s knowledge of arrays will play in the face of a large formation of this level! To be honest, although the overall strength of a sect like the star Seizer sect is not bad, they are not good at array formations. Luo Qingfeng’s array formation skills are relatively high, but we can’t scare ourselves before the war even starts!”

“I understand!” Li Yifu said,”I only hope that if the worst case scenario really happens, grand uncle – Master must not care about my life and death. Please escape from this place as quickly as possible. As long as you’re alive, there’s hope! As long as martial granduncle can be safe and sound, even if disciple’s body is smashed to pieces, disciple can still die with a smile!”

“Don’t say such demoralizing words!” Xia ruofei chided him in a low voice,”adopted husband, I’ve told you that the Peach Blossom Island is our greatest opportunity. I’ve also promised that I’ll help you break through the shackles of the aura refining realm. Do you think I’m a man of my word?”

“This disciple doesn’t dare!” Li Yifu said fearfully,”it’s just that we are facing a great enemy. I hope to tell you some things in advance.” It’s precisely because martial granduncle is a person who values relationships and righteousness that this disciple is worried that once things go south, martial granduncle will miss the best opportunity to escape because of this disciple. If that’s the case, even if this disciple dies a hundred times, it’s still difficult to atone for his sins!”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”alright!” Let’s not talk about this now! Foster husband, since you’ve acknowledged me as your martial granduncle, I can’t possibly abandon you at a critical moment and run for my life. This goes against my principles, and if I do, it might even affect my Dao heart, making it difficult for my cultivation to advance in the future. Do you understand?”
