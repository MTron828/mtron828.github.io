2680 Trekking through the peach source Island (1)

Liu Qingfeng was stunned for a moment, and then remembered that this person had not had lunch yet. He quickly said,”President Xia, I’ll get the chef to make it right away ...”

“No need!” Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”fight whatever’s in the cafeteria. I’ll wait here. The sooner, the better!”

“This ... Alright!” Liu Qingfeng said after hesitating for a moment.

After he finished speaking, Liu Qingfeng ran all the way to the cafeteria. He could have ordered his men to do this, but now he was worried that he would not have the chance to perform well in front of Xia ruofei! How could he not seize the opportunity?

Xia ruofei took the car keys and quickly found the clean land Rover in front of the project department building.

He opened the car door and sat inside. After a while, he saw Liu Qingfeng running over with two plastic bags. Liu Qingfeng came to the front of the car, and said breathlessly,”President Xia, the food is quite ordinary, you ...”

“This will do. I’m not particular about food.” Xia ruofei took the plastic bag and placed it under the passenger seat. He continued,”make arrangements for the next few days. Get someone to send the three meals a day to the airport warehouse. There’s no need to send them in, just set up a spot outside the cordon and put the things there. ”

“Alright!” Liu Qingfeng quickly responded.

“Alright, you can go and do your work!” Xia ruofei said,”carry out the few things that I mentioned!”

“Yes!” Liu Qingfeng replied.

Xia ruofei started the car and drove towards the airport.

Peach Blossom Island wasn’t big to begin with. It didn’t take long for Xia ruofei to arrive at the periphery of the airport. He could see the airport’s warehouses standing in the distance.

Xia ruofei realized that the warehouse had been cordoned off. The cordoned off area was about 50 meters away from the warehouse. Around the cordoned off area, guards in black could be seen patrolling back and forth. Especially on the road leading to the warehouse, there were more than ten burly Men in Black standing guard.

Xia ruofei secretly nodded. It seemed that Liu Qingfeng was very fast in carrying out his instructions, and he carried it out very well.

When the car reached the cordon, a Man in Black immediately gestured for Xia ruofei to stop the car. Xia ruofei stopped the car and stuck his head out of the window to lift his chin. When the Man in Black saw that it was Xia ruofei, he quickly bowed slightly and jogged over to lift the temporary roadblock.

Xia ruofei honked the horn and drove straight to the entrance of the warehouse.

Li Yifu heard the sound of the car engine outside and immediately went to the warehouse with a vigilant look. He happened to see Xia ruofei getting out of the car with two lunch boxes. Xia ruofei laughed and said,””My adopted husband! It’s time to eat!”

Li Yifu said fearfully,”senior granduncle!” You’re personally getting food for your disciple, this ... How can you be worthy of this?”

“Martial granduncle doesn’t need to eat?” Xia ruofei said nonchalantly,”what’s the big deal about bringing a meal along? Hurry up and eat! I still have something for you to do!”

“Yes!” Li Yifu quickly took the lunchbox from Xia ruofei and followed him into the warehouse.

“There! One for each person!” Xia ruofei took a lunchbox from Li Yifu and said,”hurry up and eat. I still have things to do after I finish eating!” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei opened the plastic bag and took out the lunchbox.

Inside each plastic bag were two disposable lunch boxes and a disposable soup bowl. The food was placed separately, and there was also a bowl of soup.

Xia ruofei opened it and smiled,””Not bad! There’s even chicken legs ... Foster husband, hurry up and eat!”

“Yes! Senior granduncle!” Li Yifu replied.

Although he agreed, he still obediently waited for Xia ruofei to start eating before moving his chopsticks in front of the elders. It was the rule of the older generation to wait for the elders to move their chopsticks first.

Xia ruofei gobbled down his food and soon finished more than half of the food. However, he noticed that Li Yifu was eating a little slowly, so he also slowed down consciously. He knew that once he finished eating, Li Yifu would definitely put down his chopsticks immediately no matter how much he had eaten.

After the two of them finished eating, Li Yifu immediately arranged all the lunch boxes and disposable chopsticks, put them into plastic bags, and tied them up tightly.

Xia ruofei brought Li Yifu to the entrance of the warehouse and said,””Foster husband, I’ve already given the orders. Now, the warehouse is surrounded by a cordon. There’s also a sentry post set up on the road. In addition, I’ve also arranged for all unrelated personnel to leave the island these two days, leaving only the minimum number of personnel to maintain the operation of the facility. This way, there will be no idle people on the island, and the risk of the warehouse being leaked will be reduced to the minimum. ”

“Understood, martial granduncle!” Li Yifu said.

After Xia ruofei had explained the situation to Li Yifu, he smiled and said,””Foster husband, I’m not just handing over the security work for the next few days to you. For a cultivator, this is really a waste of talent.”

“Please give me your orders, grand uncle – Master!” Li Yifu said without hesitation.

“Mm! The most important thing right now is to transfer a group of people here, a group of people that we can completely trust. ” Xia ruofei said,”the activation of the array will involve a lot of modification works. We need people who can control the construction equipment and it’s best to change the security personnel to people we can trust completely. I had originally started recruiting, but water far away can’t catch up with a near thirst. I need you to help me find some people for the time being. In addition, if you can recruit reliable people, it’s best to replace them with our own people. “
