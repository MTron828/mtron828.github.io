Zeng Liang, who had the same military experience as Xu Yougang, also said,””President Xia, I understand, but old Lei has underestimated us this time. Although we’ve left the Army, we’ll never lose our loyalty. Since we’ve promised President Xia and you’ve given us such a generous reward, we’ll sell our four lives to you!”

Xia ruofei laughed and waved his hand,”not really!” Not to that extent! I’m very confident in everyone! Come, come, come, I’ll tell you about the mission in detail ...”

Xia ruofei’s spiritual power cultivation had reached a higher level, and his insight was many times sharper than ordinary people. If Xu Yougang and the others had any ulterior motives, it would be difficult to escape Xia ruofei’s eyes. If they really met with an accident, Xia ruofei could not be sure how they would perform. But at least when they said this, it was from the bottom of their hearts.

Xia ruofei asked,”when you were in the Army, did you learn how to track and monitor?” Where’s the evidence?”

“It’s a must for the Special Forces,” Xu Yougang said without hesitation.”The four of us have no problem with it!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”very good. Your task is not complicated. You just need to follow and monitor a person. I need to know his daily itinerary, who he met, where he stayed. In short, everything about him, the more detailed, the better!”

“That’s similar to the work of a private detective!” Xu Yougang smiled and said,”President Xia, I’m not afraid of you laughing at me, but a few of us once thought of setting up a detective studio. It’s just that we didn’t have a source of customers or capital, so we could only think about it ...”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”More or less. However, I’m worried about hiring a private detective. Our own people are more reliable!”

“President Xia, you trust us so much,” Xu Yougang said.”We will not let you down!”

Then, he asked again,”President Xia, is there any specific information that we should focus on collecting?” Also, do you have any other requirements, such as photos, videos, and so on?”

Xia ruofei thought for a moment and said,””You can focus on the lifestyle of the target you’re tracking. Of course, you can also focus on honesty, but I don’t think you’ll get any useful information from this.”

People like Liu haojun, who came from a big family, might have problems in many aspects, and their abilities were average. But when it came to money, most people were relatively clean. This was because their families would give them enough money. They didn’t need such a gray income, and there was no need to risk their political future.

Xia ruofei paused and continued,””As for the type of information, the more detailed, the better. The clearer the photos and videos, the better. In short, this is up to you guys!”

“Understood!” Xu Yougang answered without hesitation.

Xia ruofei looked at the four of them and said,””I’ll pay each of you 100000 Yuan in advance. After you finish your work, the rest of the money will be transferred to your account immediately. If you finish your work well, you’ll even get an extra bonus!”

“President Xia, you can pay after you finish the work!” Xu Yougang said quickly.

Xu Yougang was the squad leader of Zeng Liang and the others in the Army, so the three of them secretly regarded Xu Yougang as their leader. It was mainly Xu Yougang who was communicating with Xia ruofei, while the three of them just listened quietly.

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”I heard from Lei Hu that your families are in a difficult situation. I’m paying you a portion of the remuneration to help you solve your urgent needs. I don’t want you to be distracted by money while working.” It’s settled then. In a while, each of you will leave an account number for me, and the money will be in my account today!”

“Then ... Then thank you, President Xia!” Xu Yougang said.

They were indeed in need of money, so Xu Yougang did not reject Xia ruofei’s kindness. He just made up his mind to do a good job and not let Xia ruofei down.

In fact, Xia ruofei was not worried that Xu Yougang and the others would run away with the money. For one thing, four hundred thousand Yuan was nothing to Xia ruofei. Even if he lost it, it was not a big deal. Secondly, if Xu Yougang and the others really took his money, they would not be able to escape if Xia ruofei really wanted to find them.

Xia ruofei looked at the touched faces of Xu Yougang and the other three and said lightly,””I’ll tell you the specific information of the target. Before that, you still have a chance to regret ...”

Xu Yougang looked at Zeng Liang and the other two. The four of them looked at each other. Then, Xu Yougang said decisively,””President Xia, we’ll accept this mission! Please give the instructions!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”okay. The person I need you to follow and monitor is called Liu haojun. He’s the Deputy Secretary of Changping County. At the same time, his family is very powerful in Beijing. Once this matter is exposed, the consequences will be very serious!”

As Xia ruofei spoke, he had been paying attention to the expressions of Xu Yougang and the others. When he revealed Liu haojun’s identity, Xu Yougang and the others ‘expressions changed slightly, but they quickly returned to normal.

It was obvious that Liu haojun’s identity had made them a little afraid. However, their mental fortitude had exceeded Xia ruofei’s expectations and they quickly adjusted.

“No problem!” Xu Yougang said,”I promise to complete the task!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”okay!” After this is done, you will work for me! The last thing I need to remind you is that after today’s incident leaves this office, I will never admit to what I said. If you fail to track Liu haojun and are arrested, I will pretend that I know nothing about it, but I will definitely fulfill the promise of a million Yuan reward and taking care of my family!”

“Understood!” Xu Yougang said seriously,”if anything happens, we’ll take it on ourselves. Even if we die, we won’t expose you, President Xia!”

Zeng Liang, Wang Chong, and Zhang Aijun also expressed their opinions.

Xia ruofei nodded in satisfaction and asked,””Lastly, is there anything else you need?”

“Mr. Xia, we need at least two cars, and we also need some money to buy equipment ...” Xu Yougang said.

“I’ll give you a sum of money. You can solve the car problem yourself. As for the equipment problem ... Do you have your own purchase channels?” Xia ruofei asked.

“No problem!” Xu Yougang said,”we are very familiar with the tracking and monitoring equipment in the Army. We also know a few underground channels, so we should be able to buy them very soon. The car thing is even simpler. We can buy two inconspicuous second – hand cars from the second – hand market, modify them to a certain extent, and then put on two fake license plates. It will be very safe!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”a problem that can be solved with money is not a big problem!” How much do you need?”

Xu Yougang quickly calculated in his mind and said,””President Xia, if we want to start the work normally, it might cost at least two million Yuan. The main problem is that some professional equipment is more expensive ...”

“I’ll give you three million!” Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”don’t save on the equipment. If you want to buy, buy the good ones ... Oh right, is three million enough? If it’s not enough, I can add more!”

“Enough!” Xu Yougang said excitedly. Enough! We can already get our hands on the best equipment!”

If he wanted to get a full set of top – tier private detective equipment, three million might not even be enough, but if it was just the equipment needed for this mission, this money was definitely enough. He could also buy very good equipment, including the wireless transmission equipment that he had always wanted but had no money to buy.

Xia ruofei nodded.”The money will be transferred to your account. I hope you can start working as soon as possible.”

“Let’s split up and prepare. Three days at most ... No!”Xu Yougang said. I can start working in two days!”

Xia ruofei said,”very good!” In that case, each of you can leave an account number for me and go back! During this time, you can rent a house outside, and I’ll pay for your expenses!”
