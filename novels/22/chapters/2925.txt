Chapter 1594: the great Tang!

Manino’s heart trembled slightly. He thought to himself,’it’s just as I’ve guessed. Goodman must have been under pressure from the outside world to make such a decisive decision. He basically sacrificed ERAD without any hesitation.’

However, Manino did not dare to ask. He quickly said,””I understand! Mr. Goodman, don’t worry!”

After hanging up the phone, Manino urged the helicopter pilot,””Why are you so slow? Increase the speed!”

In fact, the helicopter was already flying quite fast, but the pilot didn’t dare to explain much. He quickly said,””Yes! Mr. Manino!”

Then, the pilot controlled the plane to speed up a little more within the range of the safety margin. The plane carried Monino and rushed towards kuachakurakos at high speed.

Like a trapped beast, ERAD paced back and forth in Madel’s office.

Today, Manino’s order came at the right time. If it had been a little later, Madeline’s men would have done it, and the higher – ups would not have said anything. After all, according to the rules of the Bay group, there was nothing wrong with this matter.

However, just as he sent his men out, Manino’s phone call came.

The main thing was that this was Goodman’s order, and even if ERAD had more guts, he wouldn’t dare to disobey.

Besides, if the higher – ups were to investigate this matter, it would be impossible to hide it. There were so many people involved in the operation, and all Manino had to do was check the time of the operation, and everything would be revealed to you.

So, despite ERAD’s unwillingness, he still called a halt to the operation at the first moment.

Now, Madel had surrounded Huafeng shipping with his men and closely monitored it. However, they were all waiting for ERAD’s orders. Without his command, no one dared to move.

And as time passed, ERAD’s heart became more and more irritable.

Manino’s call was a little strange.

In his opinion, a few Chinese people were insignificant. In fact, the status of the entire Chinese community in Mexico was not particularly high. Why would the higher – ups of the group pay attention to such a small matter? ERAD had a bad feeling about this.

He thought about calling Manino again to ask, but then he remembered that he didn’t get along with Manino. Even if he asked, Manino wouldn’t tell him the truth, so he decided not to ask for trouble.

Time passed by slowly. ERAD sat in medel’s office with a gloomy face and didn’t say anything.

Suddenly, he felt that his surroundings were a little too quiet. He also had an inexplicable feeling of palpitations. This was an intuition for danger that he had developed after many years of living on the edge of a knife and licking blood. This intuition had saved his life more than once.

However, he was now in the Bay group’s kuachakus branch, which could be said to be very safe.

In this port city, the other drug gangs were not particularly powerful, and he had no enemies here. Why did he suddenly feel this sense of danger?

Just then, irade heard the roar of a helicopter.

He stood up at once, walked to the window and looked out. A helicopter was slowly descending from the helipad in the distance.

When he saw the helicopter, ERAD’s hanging heart was put at ease again. This was a helicopter from the Bay group. There was an eye – catching paint on the body, and he could see it clearly even from a distance.

ERAD didn’t realize at all that the danger he sensed was actually coming from within the group.

It wasn’t that ERAD wasn’t vigilant enough. It was impossible for him to think that dealing with a small Huaxia shipping company would cause such serious consequences. Not to mention that he didn’t take advantage of it at all. Instead, he was humiliated by the other party.

Therefore, even if there were any problems in the handling of this matter, even to the extent that it had alarmed the group’s higher – ups and even Goodman who had personally spoken, ERAD still felt that at the worst, he would just be reprimanded. He had never considered the more serious consequences. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

After all, although ERAD was only one of the many mid – level leaders in the entire Bay group, he was one of the most promising mid – level leaders, and he was also a favorite of Goodman ‘s.

The higher – ups would usually be more lenient towards capable people.

Therefore, ERAD never thought that he would lose his life because of such a small matter.

He stood by the window and watched. Soon, the helicopter landed steadily on the ground. Manino quickly got off the helicopter with a few bodyguards.

ERAD muttered in his heart, why is he here? This bastard wouldn’t take the opportunity to deliberately mess with me, right?

At this time, ERAD was a little vigilant in his heart, but he was more concerned about the internal personnel struggle of the group and did not think too much.

After getting off the plane, Manino went straight to the building where ERAD was.

What ERAD did not know was that ten minutes ago, the armed men Manino had gathered from several nearby areas, about one to two hundred of them, had already arrived near the kuachakuros branch. However, they had followed Manino’s orders and did not immediately assemble, but had instead hidden themselves.

As Manino led his men into the building, the armed men guarded the entrances and exits as planned. Some of them followed Manino into the building.

ERAD didn’t see the armed men who sneaked into the building from the back door. He saw Manino walk into the building and sit down at his desk, still thinking about how to deal with Manino’s possible suppression.

After a while, the office door was pushed open, and Manino walked in with five or six bodyguards.

ERAD first raised his head to take a look, then pretended to have just discovered it, revealing a very surprised expression. He got up and said,””Mr. Manino, why did you come here personally? How can I trouble you with such a small matter?”

ERAD’s tone was extremely polite, but Manino was still the same as before. He could not hear any respect in his voice. Instead, he saw the playfulness in ERAD’s eyes.

However, this time, Manino was not angry at all, because he had no reason to be angry with someone who was about to die.

In fact, from the moment the armed men surrounded this building, ERAD was already dead. No matter how good he was, it was impossible for him to escape from here.

Of course, Manino had never seen Xia ruofei and Luo Qingfeng in action. If he and ERAD had experienced the same thing that happened at Huafeng shipping this morning, he would not be so confident.

After all, no matter how tight the encirclement was, it was only targeted at ordinary people. For cultivators like Xia ruofei and Luo Qingfeng, even if there were ten times more people, they would not be able to do anything to them.

Of course, ERAD was just an ordinary person, so he was dead for sure.

He looked at ERAD and said in a business – like manner,””ERAD, I’m here on Mr. Goodman’s orders to deal with this matter! From now on, I’ll be in full command!”

Of course, ERAD had already guessed Manino’s intentions, but he was still very surprised. He also realized that things were much more complicated than he had imagined.

However, ERAD didn’t panic too much. He smiled and said,””Of course, you’re my superior, it’s only right for you to command!”

“Did the operation stop after I called?” Manino asked calmly. Where are the armed men you sent? They didn’t attack Huafeng shipping, did they?”

This was actually what Manino was most worried about. If ERAD didn’t care about it and sent someone to destroy Huafeng shipping first, Manino would be in deep trouble. He didn’t do well on Goodman’s orders, and Goodman was likely to be under great pressure. He would be the one to take the blame.

“The operation has been suspended, but our personnel are still near Huafeng shipping,” said ERAD. “I ordered them to only monitor. Even if someone leaves, they’ll only follow him and won’t act casually!” Since Mr. Goodman has spoken, how can I disobey?”

Manino heaved a sigh of relief. It seemed that bringing up Goodman had worked.

In that case, the next thing to do was to kill ERAD and then inform the armed forces to retreat.

Manino had brought one to two hundred men, so he could keep ERAD’s life no matter what. But wouldn’t it be better if he didn’t have to waste a single bullet? Not to mention that he was right in front of ERAD. If the two sides really clashed, ERAD would be in a life and death struggle, and he would be in danger, wouldn’t he?

...

Therefore, Manino still followed his plan and said calmly,””Mr. Goodman asked me to find out what happened first. I was going to ask someone from the quachaquarkos branch, but since you’ve experienced it yourself, it’s even better. I’ll ask you directly!”

“No problem! I’ll definitely tell you everything I know!” ERAD shrugged and said.

Manino was just doing business, and so was he. I don’t believe that you can make a big deal out of such a small matter.

“Let’s go to the meeting room!”Said Manino, nodding.

With that, Manino left ERAD behind, turned around, and walked out of the office.

Seeing this, ERAD couldn’t help but be stunned. Was there a need to be so formal? He was very angry and felt that Manino was deliberately putting on airs and questioning him in the conference room as if he was interrogating a prisoner.

He knew that he was in trouble this time, but before he figured out what the problem was, he decided to stay the same.

So, he shrugged and walked out of the office.

The meeting room was diagonally opposite Madeline’s office. When ERAD walked out of the office, he saw that Manino had already entered the meeting room, and two bodyguards were standing guard at the door.

ERAD secretly pouted and also walked over.

However, at the door of the conference room, the two bodyguards reached out their hands in unison to block ERAD’s path.

...

“What’s the meaning of this?” ERAD asked with a frown.

“I’m sorry, Mr. ERAD. ” One of the bodyguards said,”before you go in, you must hand over your weapon.”

When ERAD heard this, he was furious and cursed,””Impudent! Who Do You Think You Are? You dare to take my gun?”

“We’re just following the rules. Please cooperate with us.” The bodyguard said neither humbly nor arrogantly,”Mr. ERAD, this is the rule, and everyone must abide by it!”

In fact, the bodyguard was scared to death. He had heard of ERAD’s fierce reputation. He was really afraid that ERAD would directly pull out a gun and shoot him in anger. This possibility really existed.

After all, ERAD had to show some respect to Manino on the surface, but he didn’t need to feel any psychological burden when it came to a bodyguard.
