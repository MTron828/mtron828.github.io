Translator: 549690339

Song Wei accompanied Zhuo Yiyi for an entire afternoon. However, her family had to treat Xia ruofei to dinner that night, so even though it wasn’t very nice to leave her best friend alone, she still said it with a hint of guilt when it was about FiveO’ clock.

Song Wei tugged at Zhuo Yiyi’s hand and said gently,”Yiyi, I really have something on tonight! How about ... I go to the hotel to find you later?”

Zhuo Yiyi’s big eyes rolled around a few times before she looked at Song Wei and said with a smile,””Wei Wei, you’re dressed up so beautifully today, and you actually left me behind to act alone ... Hmph! Hurry up and confess! Do you have a date tonight? Not bad, Song Wei, you’ve only been at San Shan for a few days! You’ve found your Prince Charming so quickly?”

Song Wei’s face turned red and Xia ruofei’s figure appeared in her mind.

She was also flustered for no reason, but she quickly gave herself a psychological hint. I’m going to have dinner with him tonight! It was normal to think of him.

At this moment, Zhuo Yiyi seemed to have discovered a new continent. She pointed at Song Wei and said,”Your face is red! Could it be that I was right?”

Song Wei was so embarrassed that she could not help but reach out to scratch Zhuo Yiyi’s armpit. She pouted and said,””Wretched girl! You don’t have a filter on your mouth ...”

Zhuo Yiyi was the most ticklish. After being suddenly attacked by Song Wei, she could not help but giggle and beg for mercy.”Wei Wei, a gentleman uses his mouth and not his fists. You can’t be shameless ...”

Song Wei glanced at Zhuo Yiyi proudly and said,””I’m not a gentleman, I’m a woman!”

“A woman ...” Zhuo Yiyi looked at Song Wei teasingly and said,”a woman who’s been nourished by love!”

Song Wei stomped her feet in anger and reached out her hand, as if she was going to creak at Zhuo Yiyi again.

Zhuo Yiyi was so frightened that she hurriedly backed away a little. Then, she couldn’t help but ask,””Weiwei, what important thing do you have to do tonight?”

“There’s a dinner appointment tonight ... Yiyi, you must be tired after walking around for the whole afternoon, why don’t you go back to the hotel and rest?”Song Wei said after some hesitation. I’ll definitely accompany you properly tomorrow!”

Zhuo Yiyi’s eyes widened as she asked,”dinner?” And you said it wasn’t a date ...”

“It really isn ‘t!” Song Wei quickly said.

“Then I’ll go with you!” Zhuo Yiyi puffed out her chest and laughed evilly.”It can’t be a candlelight dinner, right?”

“It’s really not that. My parents are coming too. It’s an important dinner ...”Song Wei said helplessly.

When Zhuo Yiyi heard that Song Wei’s parents were going as well, she immediately dispelled the thought of going with her.

However, she changed her mind and couldn’t help but ask suspiciously,””Don’t tell me you’re using uncle and aunty as a shield on purpose because you don’t want me, the third wheel, to follow you!”

Song Wei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry,”you woman! Why are you so suspicious! Why Would I Lie to You?”

“Really?”

“Really, really!” Song Wei quickly said.

Only then did Zhuo Yiyi reluctantly say,”alright then!” I’ll forgive you! Wei Wei, don’t stand me up tomorrow!”

“I definitely won ‘t!” Song Wei made a solemn vow.

“Alright then ... I’ll believe you for now!” Zhuo Yiyi patted her perky chest and said,”you go! I’m going to watch a movie, and then I’m out hunting for food ... Poor me ...”

Song Wei was a little embarrassed and said,”Yiyi, I’m sorry ...”

“Go on, go on!” Zhuo Yiyi chuckled and said,”I’m just joking with you!”

“Alright then!” Song Wei stood up and said. Take care of yourself, and call me if anything happens ...”

Song Wei waved at Zhuo Yiyi, got up, and walked across the Plaza. She stopped a taxi by the side of the road and gave the driver the address that Xia ruofei had given song Qiming.

Song Wei had gotten her driver’s license in her second year of University. Song Qiming had also bought her a car, but it was only a smart car that cost a few hundred thousand Yuan. The small and exquisite two – seater car was very suitable for a single girl like her.

However, the car was left in the southwest. In fact, song Qiming had come in a hurry this time and had not had time to move many things from his house. Fang Liyun and Song Wei had only brought some necessities.

The living security of the provincial and Ministry level cadres was very good. The houses here were all carried and moved in, so they did not need to buy their own things at all. In addition, song Qiming was busy familiarizing himself with his new position, so he did not think of moving back for the time being.

Song Wei sat in the taxi and looked at the city scenery outside the window. She couldn’t help but look forward to tonight’s dinner.

……

The newly opened Ling’s private kitchen was located on Guanmiao Street in the Bell Tower District of Sanshan city.

This was an Old Street in Sanshan city. The buildings on both sides were not very tall, and they were all old. The street looked a little old.

Since it was positioned as a high – end private restaurant, Ling’s private restaurant would naturally not be opened in a busy place. This relatively quiet Old Street was full of the charm of the old city, and it was quite suitable.

Although the streets weren’t wide, transportation was still convenient.

In addition, there was a wide open space at the entrance of Ling Ji’s private kitchen, which could Park 20 to 30 cars. As a private kitchen that catered to a small audience, it was enough.

Xia ruofei used the GPS and drove to the small parking lot.

On the way, Xia ruofei had already taken out the jar of ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ from the medium. It was now placed in a thermal container in the trunk. There was also a tray filled with hot water at the bottom so that it would still be hot and scalding to the mouth when it was time to eat.

Xia ruofei did not take the thermal lunch box down. Instead, he got out of the car and walked straight to the Ling’s private kitchen.

Xia ruofei stopped at the door and looked around.

This was a building in the Ming and Qing Dynasty style, but the building materials looked quite new. It should have been renovated later. However, the flower baskets at the door and a row of lanterns along the green Brick wall still looked very jubilant.

Xia ruofei walked through the antique door, and after turning around the screen wall, he saw a small well. The two sides of the well were paved with green bricks, and it indeed looked full of the Ming and Qing Dynasty’s charm.

The receptionists in cheongsam standing on both sides did not recognize Xia ruofei. When they saw a guest coming in, one of them immediately asked enthusiastically,””Sir, how many of you are there? Did you make a reservation?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”is President Ling here?” I’m her friend. ”

The waitress was stunned for a moment, and didn’t realize that the Ling Ji private kitchen was only a branch of the Ling Ji F & B group. Naturally, the manager and other management staff were arranged here. The waitress didn’t think of the higher – ups like Ling Xiaotian and Ling Qingxue at first, but thought of which of the higher – ups in the store had the surname Ling.

Just as she was in a daze, a joyful voice came from inside,””Ruofei, you’re here!”

Then, the receptionist saw the Vice President of the corporation, Ling Qingxue, walking out at a brisk pace. She was practically jogging over.

At this moment, the receptionist finally realized that the “President Ling” Xia ruofei was referring to was the company’s little princess, Ling Qingxue.

Under the surprised gazes of the ladies, Ling Qingxue walked quickly to Xia ruofei and said with a smile,””You’re quite early! Not bad ...”

Ling Qingxue didn’t hide anything in front of the staff. She held Xia ruofei’s arm and said,””Let’s go! My dad is waiting for you inside!”

It was only after Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue had walked far away that the ladies came back to their senses.

This handsome guy is actually our Big boss’s son – in – Law! The welcoming ladies couldn’t help but gossip in low voices.

Ling Qingxue held onto Xia ruofei’s arm and asked smugly as they walked in,””How’s this place? From the renovation of the old house to the overall renovation, I basically watched over everything by myself!”

“Not bad, not bad! My wife is so capable!” Xia ruofei immediately gave her his praise.

“That’s right!” Ling Qingxue raised her smooth and tender chin.

Xia ruofei asked,”by the way, have you prepared the private room for tonight?” I’ve been promoting our Ling Ji’s private kitchen, so don’t drop the ball!”
