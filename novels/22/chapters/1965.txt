1966 The feast (1)

MA Xiong noticed Xia ruofei’s strange expression and could not help but ask,””Xia Sheng, what’s wrong? Are you not used to this wine?”

After he finished speaking, he couldn’t help but laugh. This expensive rotten wine was brought by Xia ruofei. He must have felt that it was good after drinking it, so he shared it with everyone. How could he not be used to it?

Xia ruofei swallowed the wine in his mouth and then said,””No, no, old master Ma, I ... Don’t particularly like foie gras, so ... Let them have one less serving!” The man said.

MA Xiong felt a little strange and said,””Oh, really? Xia Sheng doesn’t like foie gras? I ... I remember the last time you came to Hong Kong, we had a meal at our house. We also served foie gras! If I’m not mistaken, you said it tasted pretty good!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but think,”why does this old man have such a good memory?” He could actually remember such a detail! Could it be that I used too many petals of the spirit Heart Flower when he was being brainless?

“My taste can change!” Xia ruofei said awkwardly,”anyway, I don’t really feel like eating it today. Change it to steak for me!”

Xia ruofei had just heard old Blake’s story about the brutal process of producing foie gras, so he was just a little bit psychologically affected. He didn’t have obsessive – compulsive disorder and didn’t ask others not to eat foie gras.

He wasn’t an animal protector, but he did things in a calm and reasonable manner.

“No problem!” MA Xiong said straightforwardly.

Then, he pouted angrily at the waiter beside him. The waiter immediately nodded in understanding and turned to leave the room.

The foie gras incident was just a small episode. It was not surprising that Xia ruofei did not eat it. After all, everyone had different tastes. Soon, everyone was eating and chatting, and the atmosphere was very harmonious.

The French foie gras that MA Xiong had flown in from Austria were carefully cooked by a five – Star chef and served one by one.

Of course, Xia ruofei did not have the luxury of eating. He was given a steak.

Xia ruofei did not have much psychological resistance when he saw other people enjoying foie gras. Besides, his steak was not simple.

Today’s chef had personally come over to introduce the steak to everyone. This steak was made from the best ribs of the Golden aquidan cow, which was specially provided by the Polmard family.

According to the chef, golden Aquitaine beef, Black Angus beef, and Wagyu beef were ranked as the world’s top three beef breeds. Every golden Aquitaine was personally raised by the Polmard family members. Before entering the slaughterhouse, these beef enjoyed five – Star treatment. They were raised freely on the ranch, accompanied by music every day, and even masseuse services ...

It was said that this was to allow the cattle to grow in a relaxed and comfortable environment because pressure would make the cattle produce liver sugar, lactic acid, and adrenaline. These would affect the tension and acidity of the muscles, and the beef would not be soft and delicious enough.

After the Golden aquidan cow was slaughtered, the preservation of the beef was also very particular. The polmard family adopted their first “hibernation therapy,” which was to place the beef in an environment of -45 degrees Celsius, supplemented by a cold wind at 120 kilometers per hour. In this way, meat can be kept fresh forever. The so – called “fresh” meant that the meat quality would not be lost in the slightest.

Xia ruofei and the others were speechless. It was just a small piece of beef rib, but there were so many details. No wonder each piece cost more than 4000 dollars. And that was only the price of the raw ingredients. If the food cooked by a five – Star chef was included, it was normal for the price to double in a top Western restaurant.

In other words, a steak like this could be sold for 10000 US dollars, which was equivalent to more than 60000 Chinese dollars.

This price was nothing to Xia ruofei. With his current net worth, he basically did not need to consider the price for such an expenditure. However, the steak that cost more than 60000 Yuan still surprised Xia ruofei.

To put it bluntly, he was still not used to the life of a rich man. The luxury of a real rich man was often beyond the imagination of ordinary people, including Xia ruofei. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

This was also why some people suddenly became rich, and their behavior became strange and ridiculous.

Of course, Xia ruofei did not have the mentality of an upstart.

He didn’t expect beef to be sold at such a price.

Could he try raising beef? Just now, the chef seemed to have said that there were three top – tier beef in the world. What did he say? Xia ruofei thought to himself.

He found that his mind seemed to be more active recently. First, after listening to old Blake’s words, he had the idea of raising a fat goose. Then, when he saw the expensive steak, he had the idea of raising a cow.

Maybe he hadn’t opened up a new business recently! Xia ruofei said to himself.

He was not a conservative person, and it was not his style to make a lot of money every day.

As a soldier, he still hoped to have more challenges in his life and work.

For the current him, he could find greater joy in continuously developing new products, and they were even high – end and top – notch products.

Just as Xia ruofei was deep in thought, Xu lang raised his glass and raised it to Xia ruofei across MA Xiong. He smiled and asked,””Xia Sheng, is your company’s headquarters in use?”

Xia ruofei also stopped thinking and raised his glass to Xu lang. He said,””Our company’s headquarters has moved into the new building. Thanks to you, uncle Xu, everything has been going smoothly for now!”
