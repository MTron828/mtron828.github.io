When Xia ruofei and his team walked to the side of the training ground, the team had just finished a stage of training. The players were all relaxing on the field. Head coach Ruby saw his bosses and quickly walked up to them.

“We’re just here to take a look. ” Zhou leiyun smiled and said,”you guys go ahead and train.”

Although they did not win yesterday’s game, they tenaciously equalized the score despite being two goals behind. Wu Lei even created a penalty kick. Zhou leiyun was quite satisfied with the result.

The most important thing was that Wu Lei’s performance yesterday was very eye – catching. The Spanish club also showed its face in front of the domestic fans and raised a wave of reputation, which made Zhou leiyun very happy.

The reason why he had been trying to bring in Wu Lei was, of course, because of Wu Lei’s influence among the Chinese fans.

“Mr. Zhou! Mr. Xia!” Ruby said,”everyone’s training attitude is very serious, and Wu’s performance during training is also very good. After a short break, we will have an internal match.”

Ruby had a high EQ. He knew what the Chinese boss was concerned about, so he especially praised Wu Lei.

Zhou leiyun nodded.”Alright, we’ll do as you’ve arranged. We’re just here to see everyone.” Coach Ruby, you don’t have to accompany us. Go and organize the training!”

“Alright, please do as you please.” Ruby nodded.

The players were organized by the assistant manager to do some relaxation exercises in an orderly manner. The staff were collecting the training equipment on the field and the scattered football around, because the team’s internal game would be held here in a while.

Xia ruofei looked at the soccer balls piled on the side of the court and couldn’t help but feel a little itchy in his feet. He had loved playing soccer in high school and even played five – man soccer games with his comrades from time to time after he became a soldier. It was just that after he left the Army, he had basically not touched the ball.

The turf on the Spanish football club’s training ground was excellent. Xia ruofei could not help but walk over and stretch out his foot to pick up a football. Then he tried to start to dribble the ball.

Today, Xia ruofei was dressed in loose, casual clothes. His shoes were New Balance sneakers. Although they were not specialized for football, they were enough for some simple sports.

After all, Xia ruofei had not touched a soccer ball for a long time. His sense of the ball had inevitably declined. Hence, after bouncing five or six times at the start, the soccer ball fell to the ground due to his control issues.

Of course, this was also because he did not deliberately use his mental power to control it. Otherwise, even if he did not know how to play football at all, the football would be stuck to his feet like glue and could not fall off even if he wanted to.

However, Xia ruofei’s subtle control of his strength was superb. In addition, he had a certain Foundation in football. After a short period of adaptation, he became more and more skilled in dribbling the ball. Every time he did it, it was full of rhythm.

After all, Zhou leiyun was older. At first, when he saw Xia ruofei running to the side of the court to play football, he thought it was funny. However, when he saw Xia ruofei’s dribbling becoming more and more skilled, he could not help but widen his eyes.

Xia ruofei bounced the ball for 60 to 70 times, but it did not seem like the ball was going to fall.

This attracted the attention of the players and the coaching staff. They had already relaxed and were about to start preparing for the group match. Now that they had nothing to do, they could not help but gather around.

“How many times has President Xia jolted? ” Zhou leiyun asked as he looked at Jiang Xiaochen, who was mumbling to himself.

“It’s 86!” Jiang Xiaochen replied quickly and continued counting, ” 87,88,89 …”

He was Xia ruofei, who had been counting since the start of the game. He didn’t think much of it, but he didn’t expect the game to continue after so long.

Soon, the players and coaching staff also got the exact number. Everyone kept counting loudly at the side. Some were in Spanish, some in Catalan, and some in Portuguese. Of course, Zhou leiyun and Jiang Xiaochen were both in Chinese.

In fact, throwing the ball was just a very basic technical movement. It was mainly used to cultivate the players’ sense of the ball. Any of the players and coaches present today could easily do it dozens of times.

There were even children who specialized in bouncing the ball and could continuously bounce it hundreds or even thousands of times.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Therefore, bouncing ball itself wasn’t that amazing.

However, Xia ruofei was the owner of the club and was not a professional player. He could not even be considered an amateur player. It was surprising that he could do this.

Besides, Xia ruofei’s dribble had a strong rhythm. It seemed to have a special rhythm that made people feel very comfortable. It was definitely not like watching other people who were worried about him.

Everyone had a feeling that if Xia ruofei wanted to, he could continue to dribble the ball until the end of time …

“156、157……”

Xia ruofei could hear the crowd counting. He had been through a lot. He would not have stage fright in such a situation. On the contrary, he felt a little excited. It was as if he had returned to his high school days when he was playing football. However, the people standing on the sidelines were not the coaches and players of the top league, but his classmates. If there were beautiful girls among them, his sense of achievement would immediately rise by several levels.
