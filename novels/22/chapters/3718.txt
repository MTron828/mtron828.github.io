Translator: 549690339

Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but hit Xia ruofei and said,””Why are you so infuriating!”

“You’ve really broken through to the late – Stage of the Aurous core stage?” Song Wei could not help but ask.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”why Would I Lie to You?” Speaking of which, it was also because he was studying the “black origin Sutra”! However, the accumulation of my own cultivation base was almost at the point of a breakthrough, so 1 took advantage of the situation!”

Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but giggle and said,””If word of this gets out, wouldn’t sect leader mu, Valley master Liu, and the others die of anger? The breakthrough from the mid – Aurous core stage to the late – Aurous core stage is so logical and logical…”

“That’s why RUO Fei is the best!”Song Wei chuckled. He’s not someone ordinary cultivators can compare to!”

“Yes, yes, yes! Your man is the best!” Ling Qingxue said.

“Isn’t he your man?” Song Wei retorted immediately.

“You’re all right. I’m your man …”Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Move aside!” The two of them said in unison.

Ling Qingxue’s eyes darted around before she said,”Wei Wei, this guy has broken through to the late – Stage of the Aurous core stage. The effect of cultivating the” absolute beginning Heart Sutra “together will definitely be better!”

Song Wei’s eyes lit up and said,”Oh, right!”

Then, the two of them looked at Xia ruofei at the same time, as if they were looking at a perfect supplement pill.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but take a step back. He waved his hand and said, “Don’t look at me like that. I’m scared …”

Ling Qingxue giggled and said,”what are you afraid of?” Obediently accompany us to our joint cultivation! What are you hiding for? Where can you hide?”

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly.”No… I’ve been in seclusion for a few days. I’ve barely slept or rested. Can’t you at least let me rest?”

“No!” Ling Qingxue said decisively,”who was the one showing off just now? Now, you’ll join our cultivation! If we don’t work hard, we’ll really be left far behind by you! Weiwei, you first!”

“You go first!” Song Wei said,”1’11 go prepare something to eat. We’ll celebrate with RUO Fei today!”

“That’s good too … Anyway, I can’t let this guy be idle!” Ling Qingxue said.

Then, she pulled Xia ruofei over and said,””Come in, you!”

Xia ruofei was pulled into a bedroom by Ling Qingxue with a bitter expression on his face. However, there was no erotic reward. Ling Qingxue could not wait to ask him to take out the time array flag. Then, the two of them began to cultivate together.

Of course, even though the process of joint cultivation looked calm on the surface, it was actually quite erotic.

Furthermore, the combination of spirit bodies was, in theory, more fascinating than the combination of physical bodies.

To Xia ruofei, the progress of his cultivation was negligible when he cultivated with Song Wei and Ling Qingxue. However, with his current cultivation level, the consumption of the cultivation process was negligible. It was just a matter of time.

Moreover, with the help of the time array flag, it didn’t waste much time.

It didn’t cost much time, but he could enjoy the joy of spirit body Union. Xia ruofei naturally wouldn’t reject it.

The bitter look on his face was obviously an act. This was also a secret pleasure between him, Song Wei, and Ling Qingxue.

Xia ruofei was very serious in his practice with Ling Qingxue. Then, he did the same practice with Song Wei for the same amount of time.

The two of them felt it very clearly. Xia ruofei’s cultivation had indeed improved by a huge step. The joint cultivation process was much smoother and easier. In the same time, their cultivation had improved a lot more than before.

Naturally, the two of them were overjoyed. Xia ruofei’s improvement in cultivation was, in a sense, a great boost to their cultivation.

After the joint cultivation, Xia ruofei and his two female friends had a Happy Meal together. To celebrate his breakthrough to the advanced stage of the Golden core stage, Xia ruofei even took out his precious Drunken Eight Immortals white wine. Song Wei and Ling Qingxue drank half an. This wine was sweet and had a low alcohol content, which was especially suitable for girls.

After the meal, the three of them cleaned up the dishes together, and the atmosphere was naturally harmonious.

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue stood by the sink and washed the dishes, while Xia ruofei was responsible for drying and placing the plates they liked. The division of labor was very clear. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Song Wei washed the dishes and asked,””RUO Fei, now that you’ve broken through to the late – Stage of the Aurous core stage, what are your plans? Do you want to continue cultivating in seclusion on the Peach Blossom Island?”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,””If you keep yourself in a closed environment, the effect of your cultivation might not be very good, so you might go out for a walk!”

“En!” Song Wei nodded and said,”it’s better to travel ten thousand miles than to read ten thousand books. This principle should be correct when it comes to cultivation. Furthermore … The difference between the Jindan stage and the Yuanying stage is a huge realm. I believe that breaking through is not that easy. H

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’ve just broken through to the advanced stage of the Aurous core stage. There’s still a long way to go before I can break through to the nascent Soul Stage.” I won’t consider this problem for the time being.”

Ling Qingxue looked at Xia ruofei and said,””For others, it might be a long process, and they might not even be able to do it in their entire lives, but for you…”

At this point, Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but laugh. She then said,””Can you be measured by common sense? How long has it been since you’ve broken through to the mid – Aurous core stage?”

Xia ruofei was slightly stunned. He smiled and said,””It doesn’t seem to be a long time! We broke through when we were exploring the mystic Luna realm! It’s …. Not even been a year?”
