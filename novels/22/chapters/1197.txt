Chapter 1198: Returning to Australia (1)

Translator: 549690339

At the entrance of the International departure hall, Xia ruofei took the small login case from ye Lingyun’s hands and smiled.””Ling Yun, let’s stop here! There’s still a lot of work waiting for you at the farm!”

“Don’t worry, brother Xia!”Ye linyun nodded. The quality of this batch of tea leaves you gave me is very good. I will definitely be able to make high – Quality Da Hong Pao! They definitely won’t ruin our paradise corporation’s reputation!”

Xia ruofei laughed,”of course I believe you!” Otherwise, I wouldn’t have given you all of this business! Ling Yun, you’ll just take care of the tea. The company will do its best to ensure the rest. If you have any difficulties, just look for President Feng. I’ve already spoken to her!”

“Understood!” Ye Lingyun said bluntly.

Xia ruofei beckoned to ye Lingyun and pushed the boarding box into the airport Hall.

......

Ten hours later, Xia ruofei walked out of Sydney’s Kingford Smith International Airport.

He had come here this time specifically to improve the quality of the winery’s grapes.

Australia was in the Southern Hemisphere, and its season was the opposite of China. September and October were the best season for grape planting.

Xia ruofei had already prepared the grape seedlings in advance.

Through Xia Qing’s repeated experiments in the spirit map space, she finally managed to cultivate the excellent breed of half – llon white grapes.

Semillon itself was a species of white grape with an extremely strong vitality. In addition to the unique conditions in the spirit map space, Xia Qing made use of the time flow that was thirty times faster than that of the Archean realm. After a few experiments, she obtained the best species of grape and quickly began to reproduce these grapevines. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

After cultivating a batch in the Archean realm, he would immediately transplant them into the mountain and sea realm. Then, he would continue to cultivate another batch in the Archean realm. Now that there were enough grape seedlings in the mountain and sea realm, he could completely replace all the grape seeds in the two wineries under Xia ruofei’s name.

Xia ruofei should have arrived in Australia earlier.

However, he had been busy with this and that for a while and had almost never stopped. When the Jade skin cream was finally a success, he could finally free up some time, so he quickly flew to Australia.

This was because if they delayed any longer, they would miss the best season for grape planting.

Xia ruofei stepped out of the airport, looked at the blue sky and white clouds that were the symbol of Australia, and took a deep breath.

From afar, Liang Qichao had already walked up to them.

“Boss, you’ve had a long journey!” Liang Qichao said with a smile.

Xia ruofei punched Liang Qichao’s shoulder and said,””Brother Liang, Australia’s soil is really nourishing! Your weight has grown again!”

“Don’t mention it ...” Liang Qichao said,”I gain weight easily. I put on weight even when I drink cold water. It’s hard work here ...”

“Come on, you ... You should be very nourished!” Xia ruofei exposed him without mercy.

Every day, he lived in a farm with thousands of hectares of green grass, with a man – made Lake as clear as a mirror at the entrance, accompanied by swans and kangaroos all day long. It was simply a fairy – like life!

Liang Qichao chuckled and took Xia ruofei’s login case very naturally. The two of them walked towards the parking lot.

On the way to immortal farm in Hunter Valley, Xia ruofei asked,”Have you prepared the warehouse I asked you to rent?”

“Of course! We’ve settled all the paperwork yesterday, and the right to use that warehouse will be ours for the next month!” Liang Qichao asked,”what are you trying to put in there? The farm is so big, yet it’s not enough for you. Why do you have to rent a warehouse outside?”

“It’s a secret!” Xia ruofei smiled mysteriously and said,”take me to her first!”

Liang Qichao pursed his lips.”You’re still trying to keep me in suspense ... Fine, fine, fine. I don’t care about the boss’s business. I’ll Take You There now!”

Xia ruofei had searched for the warehouse on the internet and called Liang Qichao to rent it. It was also in the Hunter Valley area.

After checking the warehouse, Xia ruofei was quite satisfied.

The situation was similar to what he had seen on the internet. First of all, it was big enough to fit so many grape seedlings. Besides, the location was relatively remote. Xia ruofei had taken a look on the way there. There were no surveillance cameras at the nearby intersections, which made it easier for him to do things.

“Alright! Not bad, not bad!” Xia ruofei said happily,”brother Liang, give me the key to the warehouse! I’ll be useful these two days! Oh right ... Help me find two trucks in two days. Hmm ... The day after tomorrow at eight in the morning! Wait at the entrance of this warehouse!”

“No problem!” Liang Qichao passed the key to Xia ruofei.

The two of them got back into the car and headed to Paradise Farm.

Xia ruofei leaned back on the passenger seat and looked at the beautiful scenery outside the window. He asked,””Brother Liang, there’s no problem with the seeds we sent over last time, right?”

Immortal Land Farm had completed the planting experiment, and Liang Qichao was eager to show off his skills, so he quickly sent the planting plan and the seeds back to China.

Naturally, Xia ruofei would not be against money. After all, Paradise Farm earned US dollars! Therefore, he quickly contacted a few seed companies that he had contacted in advance and transported the seeds to the warehouse in San Shan city in the shortest time possible.

Then, Xia ruofei would find time to bring all these seeds into the spirit map space and let Xia Qing finish the job of soaking and drying them.

Due to the flow of time, all the strengthened seeds had been processed within a day.
