3071 Welcoming them through the night (1)

After Xia ruofei heard this, he smiled and said,””You can deal with this matter as you see fit, but remember not to beat him to death with a stick. He still needs this to support his family! Just let him have a long memory!”

“Yes! I’m going to ask the transport management to suspend his service for a week as punishment. ” Sun Xiao said,”anyway, he has already admitted it. Now, the evidence is conclusive!”

Xia ruofei nodded.”Sure ... Oh, right. Did you give him the fare?”

“I’ve given it, I’ve given it!” Sun Xiao quickly said,”I did as you instructed!”

“That’s good! You’ve worked hard!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“No problem!” Sun Xiao quickly waved his hand and said,”young master Xia, you’re too kind!”

Then, Sun Xiao immediately said,”young master Xia, the young sect leader will soon receive news of your visit. During your stay at sky peak, you can let me know if you have any needs. This is my business card!”

With that said, Sun Xiao respectfully handed over his business card with both hands.

Xia ruofei took the name card with a smile and kept it in the spirit map space.

Sun Xiao hesitated for a moment before asking,””Young master Xia, if I may ask, can you provide more personal information? In this way, this disciple can report to young sect leader, in case young sect leader asks and this disciple doesn’t know anything ...”

Xia ruofei laughed heartily and said,””Of course! Just tell him that Xia Tian from the star Seizer sect is here to visit, and brother Chen Xuan will understand!”

Sun Xiao heaved a sigh of relief and quickly said,””Alright! Thank you, young master Xia! Then disciple won’t disturb you any longer, you can rest here first!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””You’ve worked hard!”

“It’s not hard! It’s not hard!” Sun Xiao quickly said,”young master Xia, I will take my leave!”

Sun Xiao bowed to Xia ruofei respectfully and left the room.

It was not until he closed the door that Sun Xiao heaved a long sigh of relief.

In the short time that he had spent with Xia ruofei, Sun Xiao had felt immense pressure.

In fact, Xia ruofei had been very kind and friendly from the beginning to the end. However, Sun Xiao could feel an inexplicable pressure. This feeling was similar to the feeling he had when he was fortunate enough to receive the Golden core cultivators in his sect, including Chen Xuan and the other experts.

He even felt that the invisible pressure from Xia ruofei was stronger ...

After sun Xiao bade farewell, he immediately returned to his exclusive dormitory in this subsidiary building and directly reported the situation to the sect through the phone.

The heavenly sect’s communication method was similar to the star Seizer sect ‘s. They both set up a point near the mountain Gate, with disciples guarding it and people in charge of delivering news to the sect. Some news from the secular world was sent to the sect through this point.

The reason why he could not directly contact the sect was also because of the sect protecting formation.

However, the development of modern communication technology had brought great convenience and improved efficiency.

It was said that in the ancient cultivation world, there was a means of long – distance communication between cultivators. However, this kind of magic treasure had been completely lost. In the cultivation world, they had to rely on some scientific means to achieve rapid communication.

In the No. 3 suite of the attached building.

It was already Teno’ clock at night. Xia ruofei had already had his breakfast, and sun Xiao had personally brought it to the suite.

After the shower, Xia ruofei was ready to go to the bedroom to rest.

At this moment, there was a knock on the door of the suite.

Xia ruofei scanned the room with his spiritual power out of habit and was surprised. He quickened his pace and opened the door.

Standing at the entrance was the young sect master of the first heaven sect, Chen Xuan, whom he had just met at the auction not long ago. Sun Xiao was also by his side.

In fact, Sun Xiao was very shocked.

It had only been a few hours since he had sent the news to the sect, but the moment Chen Xuan received the news, he didn’t care that it was already night time and rushed to Tai city. Although the first heaven sect was located in the depths of Mount Tai, it was still quite far from tai city. From the looks of it, Chen Xuan must have rushed over after making some simple arrangements. Furthermore, he must have flown over on his sword or on his flying boat.

Of course, the sect was located in a remote area, and the mountain roads there were difficult to walk on. It would take a few hours for an ordinary Qi refining disciple to come to Tai city from the first heaven sect.

“Brother Chen! Why did you rush here overnight?” Xia ruofei said in surprise,”you’re making me feel uneasy!” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Chen Xuan laughed and said,”brother Xia, you’re treating me like an outsider!” How could I not welcome an honored guest? Besides ... You’re not only an honored guest, you’re also my creditor!”

After sun Xiao heard this, he was even more shocked.

Their young sect master had never lacked cultivation resources since he was a child, let alone spirit stones. Yet, he wanted to borrow money from this young cultivator? Could it be that this person’s background was greater than the young sect leader ‘s?

Looking at the dazed Sun Xiao, Chen Xuan said indifferently,””You can leave first! Tell the kitchen to prepare some supper. I want to have a few drinks with brother Xia!”

“Yes! Young sect leader!” Sun Xiao quickly replied.

Then, with a belly full of questions and shock, he respectfully bowed to the two of them and turned to leave.

Xia ruofei smiled and invited Chen Xuan into the house. They sat down in the spacious living room.
