Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei also felt a little strange. He felt that Tang Yitian was a little too enthusiastic. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that he was very respectful.

Even if Tang Yitian was very grateful to her for saving little Haoran, he shouldn’t have such respect for her!

However, Xia ruofei didn’t think too much about it. He guessed that Tang Yitian’s attitude might be because the hidden danger in little Haoran’s body had not been completely resolved.

“Alright,” Xia ruofei nodded and said,”we’ll do as Mr. Tang said. I’ll give you the contact information of the manager of the winery. You can contact uncle Carter for the details!”

“No problem!” Tang Yitian said. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei wrote down Old West’s phone number and passed it to Tang Yitian. Then, he smiled and said,””Mr. Tang, since you’ve come to the Hunter Valley, I’ll give little Haoran a check up!”

Hearing Xia ruofei’s words, Tang Yitian was a little embarrassed. He quickly explained,””Mr. Xia, we’re not in a hurry. It’s just that Haoran has been asking you to play with him for a few days. After you come to Australia, we should visit the farm, so ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand.”I was planning to go to Sydney today too. However, because of this reception, I had to postpone my plan.”

“It’s a good thing that there’s a party for the Maya Group,” Jennifer said with a smile.”Otherwise, if you go to Sydney and we come to the Hunter Valley, we’ll all lose ... Lose ...”

“Jennifer, you’re trying to say that you missed it!” Lin Qiao said with a smile.

“Yes, yes, yes, I missed it!” Jennifer said with a face full of distress,”the language of you Chinese people is really too complicated ...”

“Actually, Jennifer, you’re the best Australian I’ve ever seen who uses Chinese idioms!” Xia ruofei laughed.

“Really?” Jennifer said happily,”actually, my Chinese is not good enough. I need to continue to work hard ...”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.”Look, you’ve even learned the traditional Chinese virtue of modesty. It seems that you’re a qualified Chinese daughter – in – Law!”

Tang Yitian couldn’t help but look at Jennifer lovingly. When Tang Yitian was young, he was actually quite a Playboy. In addition, his family was rich, so he often changed his female partners. Later, after meeting Jennifer, he quickly stopped being a Playboy, which showed that Jennifer’s charm was indeed extraordinary.

After a few brief interactions with Jennifer, Xia ruofei could also feel that this famous star who was once famous all over Australia was a person with a very high EQ.

After chatting for a while, Xia ruofei asked little Haoran to get down from his body and sit on the sofa with his hand stretched out.

Little Haoran obediently followed Xia ruofei’s request and stretched out his left hand, palm up.

Xia ruofei placed his finger on little Haoran’s pulse and closed his eyes. His spiritual energy quickly seeped out of his body and entered little Haoran’s body through his meridians to check on the condition of the remaining innate pure Yang Qi.

After a long while, Xia ruofei opened his eyes and looked at Tang Yitian and Jennifer, who looked a little nervous. He said with a smile,””It’s almost the same as I expected. There’s not much innate pure Yang Qi left in little Haoran’s body. Even if it’s not cleared in a short time, it won’t be able to do much. It’s just that little Haoran’s body is slightly weaker than the average child.”

“That’s good ...” Tang Yitian let out a long sigh of relief.”Mr. Xia, if you say so, we can rest assured.”

Xia ruofei continued,”the last treatment is to completely remove the innate pure Yang Qi in Haoran’s body. So, I have to adjust to my best condition before I can carry out the treatment. Moreover, little Haoran has received several consecutive treatments before. At that time, it was because his life was in danger. It’s best to let him recuperate for a few more days this time to make sure that nothing goes wrong.”

In fact, Xia ruofei had already decided to accept Xia Qing’s suggestion to keep a part of little Haoran’s innate pure Yang Qi. At the same time, he would try to persuade Tang Yitian and his wife to let him take little Haoran as his disciple.

However, for little Haoran to absorb the innate pure Yang Qi for the last time, Xia ruofei hoped that it would be after he had unlocked the human – shaped jade talisman and started to cultivate the great Dao Arts. Hence, he decided to wait a few more days because Xia ruofei was very close to the perfect unlocking talisman. He estimated that in two or three days at most, he should be able to reveal the true appearance of the first three levels of the great Dao Arts.

“No problem, no problem. We’re not in a hurry at all!” Tang Yitian quickly said,”I’ll follow your arrangements!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. After a moment of silence, he said to Liang Qichao,””Brother Liang, you take Qiao’ er to the banquet hall to talk with your peers. I still have something to tell Mr. Tang and the others.”

Liang Qichao nodded and said,”okay, you guys talk!”

Lin Qiao wanted to spend time with her idol, but since Xia ruofei had asked, she knew that he must have something important to do. So, she obediently followed Liang Qichao out of the lounge.

Seeing this, Tang Hu also took the initiative to get up and said,”Fifth uncle, Mr. Xia, I’ll go ahead and take a look as well. You guys can talk!”

After Tang Hu also left, only Tang Yitian’s family and Xia ruofei were left in the lounge.

Tang Yitian was already in a relaxed mood, but when he saw Xia ruofei send Liang Qichao and the others away, he couldn’t help but ask nervously,””Mr. Xia, could it be that Haoran’s situation is difficult to deal with?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Mr. Tang, don’t be nervous. Although what I’m going to say is related to little Haoran, it’s not about his illness. You can rest assured about this.”

“That’s good, that’s good,” Tang Yitian heaved a sigh of relief and then asked,”is it about Haoran? Mr. Xia, what’s the matter?”

Xia ruofei looked at Tang Yitian and Jennifer. He thought for a while and said,””Uh ... I feel that I’m quite fated with little Haoran, and after these treatments, I found that this child is quite talented, so ... I have the intention to take him as a disciple. What do you think?”

The reason why Xia ruofei brought up this matter before he gave little Haoran his last treatment was to confirm it. If Tang Yitian and his wife really didn’t have any intention to do so, Xia ruofei would not force them.

Accepting a disciple also depended on fate. If his parents didn’t agree, it also meant that little Haoran wasn’t fated to be his disciple.

If that was the case, then when Xia ruofei was treating little Haoran in two days, he could not leave behind any innate pure Yang Qi. He had to completely remove it.

Although it was a waste of little Haoran’s talent, there was no other way.

After Xia ruofei finished, Jennifer’s reaction was still pretty good. Perhaps in her mind, the relationship between master and apprentice was similar to the relationship between a teacher and a student in a school. Tang Yitian, on the other hand, was stunned. He, who had a net worth of tens of billions of Yuan, actually lost his self – Control and opened his mouth wide. His eyes were also wide open. It seemed that Xia ruofei’s words had shocked him.

Seeing Tang Yitian’s reaction, Xia ruofei thought that he was unwilling.

Even if Tang Yitian didn’t want to, it was normal. After all, he had billions of dollars in wealth. He must have already planned out his child’s growth path. When he first heard that Xia ruofei wanted to take his son as an apprentice, it was inevitable that he would have some concerns.

Hence, Xia ruofei smiled bitterly and said,””Mr. Tang, you don’t have to feel pressured. I’m just asking for your opinion. If you don’t agree, just pretend that I didn’t mention it. I’ll still completely remove the hidden danger in little Haoran’s body ...”

“I agree! I agree!” After hearing Xia ruofei’s words, Tang Yitian seemed to come back to his senses. He said hurriedly,”Mr. Xia, we completely agree!”

In fact, Tang Yitian wasn’t as worried as Xia ruofei had guessed. He didn’t seem to believe what he had just heard. He was also shocked by the huge surprise, which was why he looked so dumbfounded.

In his mind, Xia ruofei was a master whose abilities surpassed Mr. Li Jiu Zhou ‘s! He had thought that it was already arranged by fate that they could meet Xia ruofei at the airport and that Xia ruofei was willing to save little Haoran. It was the good deed of their ancestors. He never dared to dream that Xia ruofei would take the initiative to take little Haoran as a disciple.

Furthermore, Xia ruofei had personally said that little Haoran was quite talented. Did this not mean that little Haoran could also become someone like Xia ruofei and Li Jiuzhou?

Therefore, after hearing what Xia ruofei said, Tang Yitian came back to his senses and quickly agreed. He was afraid that Xia ruofei would change his mind if he spoke too slowly.

“You guys really agree?” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel happy.”Don’t agree just because you can’t bring yourself to do it!” I’m really just happy to see you. Whether you agree or not, it won’t affect our relationship. ”

“No, no, no, Mr. Xia, it’s Haoran’s good fortune to have you as his master!” Tang Yitian quickly said. How could we possibly disagree? Isn’t it? Jennifer!”

As Tang Yitian spoke, he shot a look at Jennifer.

Even though Jennifer did not quite understand her husband’s behavior, nor did she understand the traditional Master – disciple relationship in China, she still nodded and said,””Xia, your suggestion is great. I think Haoran would be very willing to be your student.”

“It’s my disciple!” Tang Yitian quickly corrected her.”Jennifer.”

“Alright then!” Jennifer shrugged her shoulders and said,”no matter what, I fully support your decision.”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,””In that case, let’s ask little Haoran for his opinion!”

Xia ruofei patted little Haoran’s head and asked with a smile,””Little Haoran, are you willing to be my disciple? I can teach you some very powerful skills!”

Little Haoran had no concept of the Master – disciple relationship, but when he heard that Xia ruofei would teach him some powerful skills, he immediately nodded like a chicken pecking at rice and said,””Good, good! Brother ruofei, you’re my master from now on!”

Then, little Haoran revealed a confused expression and asked,””But ... What should I call you in the future? Should she call him brother or master? Why don’t you ... Call big brother master?”
