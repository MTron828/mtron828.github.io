Chapter 999: You’re quite sick (1)

Translator: 549690339

Tang He didn’t expect Xia ruofei to have already found a suitable material for the Phoebe zhennan wood. He was overjoyed when he heard that.””Ruofei, I’ve made the right decision to find you! An ordinary person wouldn’t be able to do this. Even if they could find barely qualified wood, they wouldn’t be as efficient as you!”

“You flatter me, Mr. Tang,” Xia ruofei smiled faintly,”then ... Are you going to send someone to inspect the goods?” Or do you want to come personally?”

Tang He pondered for a moment and said,”how about this ... I might be done in a day or two. There’s an important contract that needs my personal approval and signature, so I can’t come in these two days. How about three days?” I’ll contact you when I’m done!”

Xia ruofei replied readily,”sure!” Just give me a call in advance, and I’ll get my friend to prepare the wood in advance. Let’s go to the same warehouse as last time!”

“No problem!” Tang He said happily.

After hanging up the phone, Xia ruofei returned to the small farm villa and entered the spirit map space to check on the Phoebe zhennan wood that he had prepared.

When he was in Australia, Xia ruofei had already cut down the two nanmu trees that he had carefully selected and cut off the leaves, leaving only the trunk.

The two Phoebe zhennan trees were directly in contact with the soil in the realm, so they would not be kept in the same state as when they were just cut down because of the preservation effect of the realm.

When Xia ruofei saw the two goldsilk nanmu in the medium, they had already been in the medium for two to three years. Of course, this was the time in the yuanchu realm. In reality, it was only about a month in the outside world.

The two pieces of Phoebe zhennan wood had been fully oxidized, forming a perfect old material.

Xia ruofei measured with a tape measure. The diameter of the two wood materials was about 1.1 meters, and the core of the core was about one meter in diameter. The core proportion was about 91%, which was quite high.

Back then, the brothers Liang Weimin and Liang Weihua had been looking for wood for elder Tang. The competition between the two had been very intense, and in the end, Liang Weimin had won because of the high – Quality Phoebe zhennan wood that Xia ruofei had provided.

Xia ruofei still remembered that the Phoebe zhennan wood that Liang Weihua had found had a diameter of about 1.1 meters. However, the core of the wood was only 95 centimeters in diameter, which was five centimeters less than the two pieces of wood that he had.

Xia ruofei was also completely relieved. He knew that even if Tang He came to check it himself, these two pieces of material would definitely move this billionaire.

There were still three days left, which meant that these two pieces of material could stay in the primal realm for another three months or so. Perhaps the ratio of core material could be increased by a few more points.

After Xia ruofei checked the jinsi Phoebe Wood, he patrolled the space.

Xia Qing had been very busy. Now, Xia ruofei had already started to set up a medicinal garden, iron – Skin Dendrobium plantation, tea garden, and so on in the vast land of the mountain and sea realm. Every day, Xia Qing would travel between the two spaces, cutting iron – Skin dendrobes, tea trees, and taking care of the medicinal garden.

Fortunately, Xia Qing was just a spiritual puppet. She didn’t complain about being tired, nor did she need to sleep or rest. She worked almost all day long. Otherwise, if it were a human being, he would definitely not be able to withstand such a heavy workload.

Xia ruofei gave Xia Qing a few words of encouragement before leaving the spirit map space.

For the next two days, Xia ruofei was living a carefree life again. When he strolled around the farm, he also took time to avoid the employees and added some spirit Heart Flower petal solution to the water tower at the top of the mountain and the circulation pool in the kun fish cultivation space.

The use of the petals of the spirit Heart Flower was quite large now. Fortunately, the production rate was much higher than before, so it was not a big problem to break even.

Moreover, Xia ruofei had stored dozens of petals. If there was an emergency and he needed to use a large number of them, Xia ruofei would not have to worry.

He didn’t panic when he had more than enough food.

The next day, Xia ruofei still did not receive a call from Hengfeng group. Instead, song Rui called him.

This guy didn’t say much, just that he needed Xia ruofei’s help and asked him to come out for lunch.

Xia ruofei and song Rui were very close. As long as it was about Xia ruofei, song Rui would help him without any hesitation with just a phone call. Hence, Xia ruofei would not reject song Rui’s request.

So, he told Hu ‘Zi’s mother that he wouldn’t be having lunch at home. Then, he drove the Knight XV off – Road vehicle out of the farm and headed straight to the city.

Song Rui had booked the Shangri – La hotel next to Liberation Square in the Bell Tower District.

Xia ruofei parked his car in the hotel’s underground parking lot and went to the cold plum Hall on the third floor of the hotel. Song Rui had already arrived.

As soon as he saw Xia ruofei, song Rui immediately stood up and said,””RUO Fei, quickly come in and sit!” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Xia ruofei looked at song Rui and found that he seemed to be a little dispirited. He had an unkempt beard and had not shaved for at least two or three days. His hair was also messy.

Song Rui had always paid attention to his personal image. It was very unusual for him to act like this!

After Xia ruofei sat down, he asked,””What’s wrong with you? You look like a frosted eggplant ...”

Song Rui smiled bitterly and said,”it’s a long story ... Let’s eat first!” Let’s talk while we eat ...”

“Don ‘t!” Xia ruofei said. Let’s talk about the matter first! You don’t look like you’re in the mood to eat. Besides ... I won’t be able to eat in peace if you don’t explain it clearly!”

Song Rui was stunned for a moment before he replied,”sure!” Then let’s talk about the matter first!”
