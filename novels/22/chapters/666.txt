Chapter 667: Attending the banquet (1)

Xia ruofei was stunned. He did not expect he kun to take the initiative. He quickly said,””That’s the best! Director he, thank you so much ...”

“You’re welcome, you’re welcome,” He kun laughed and said,”President Xia, please send me your ID number by text. I’ll ask my Secretary to book the plane tickets.”

Xia ruofei quickly said,”I’ll have to trouble you guys!” Director he, tell me the flight number, I’ll book the ticket myself. ”

“It’s just a small matter. President Xia, please don’t decline.” He kun said,”President Xia, it’s decided! I’m going to a meeting soon, I’ll tell you the flight number later, we’ll talk about the details on the plane!”

Xia ruofei could tell that he kun was really in a hurry to go to the meeting, so he did not decline and hung up the phone after expressing his gratitude.

After Xia ruofei sent his ID number to he kun, he drove back to the farm.

On the way, Xia ruofei received a text message from he kun about the flight information.

Xia ruofei took a look as he drove. It was a flight at 9 am the next morning. It would be noon when they arrived in the capital.

Xia ruofei also noticed that he kun had asked his Secretary to book business class.

Can Deputy department heads travel in business class? Xia ruofei laughed and shook his head. However, there was a way for Dragons and prawns. She had even taken care of his plane tickets! Naturally, there was a place to settle the expenses.

Xia ruofei sent a text to express his gratitude and then drove back to the farm.

He parked the car at the complex and went upstairs to greet Feng Jing. When Feng Jing learned that Xia ruofei was going to Beijing to coordinate the project, she was very supportive. She laughed and said that Xia ruofei had finally done something that a Chairman should do.

Xia ruofei could only smile bitterly at Feng Jing’s teasing.

......

He went straight home to pack his luggage after leaving the office building. Of course, he also gave Ling Qingxue a call to let her know.

This girl had also been busy with the Ling Ji restaurant chain recently. Ling Xiaotian was prepared to give her more responsibilities and let her hold the position of Vice President, no longer just in charge of the finances.

In addition, Xia ruofei was also very busy during this period of time, so the two of them did not have many opportunities to meet.

However, as long as they had free time, Xia ruofei would chat with Ling Qingxue on the phone. Their relationship was still as close as glue.

Ling Qingxue was very understanding and supportive of Xia ruofei’s career. When she found out that Xia ruofei was going to the capital for a business trip for a few days, she did not say anything else but reminded Xia ruofei to take care of his health and safety.

The two of them cuddled on the phone for a while before hanging up reluctantly.

It was a quiet night.

The next morning, Xia ruofei went down at 7:40 sharp. Lei Hu was already waiting in the company’s Mercedes – Benz at the entrance of the villa.

At 8:10 am, Xia ruofei arrived at the departure hall of Changping International Airport.

He didn’t let Lei Hu help him carry his luggage, and instead dragged a very small luggage into the hall alone. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Just as Xia ruofei was about to find a place to sit down and rest, his phone rang.

“President Xia, we’ve arrived at the airport!” “Where are you?” he kun asked enthusiastically.

“Bureau chief he, I’m in front of the round counter at the inquiry office.” Xia ruofei said as he looked around.

Soon, he saw two people walking quickly towards him. One of them was dragging two suitcases while the other was a middle – aged man in a suit and leather shoes. He had slicked – back hair and was holding a mobile phone in his hand. He waved at Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei immediately waved his hand and walked over with his small suitcase.

“You’re President Xia, right? Aiya, he’s really young and promising!” He kun smiled like a Maitreya Buddha, his attitude extremely kind.

“Director he, Hello! I’m really sorry to trouble you this time!” Xia ruofei replied with a smile and they shook hands tightly.

The 30 – year – old man behind he kun took the initiative to help Xia ruofei with his luggage.

Xia ruofei quickly waved his hand.”No, no, it’s fine. I don’t have much luggage. I can carry it myself.” Let’s quickly change our boarding passes!”

“Haha, there’s still plenty of time ...” He kun said with a laugh.

The group walked towards the check – in counter. He kun’s Secretary asked for Xia ruofei’s identity card and quickly walked to the VIP counter. He quickly changed three boarding passes.

Under the guidance of a VIP customer service Officer, Xia ruofei and the others passed the security check through the VIP passage and entered the VIP waiting room of the airport.

Xia ruofei and he kun were chatting in the VIP lounge. He kun was also trying to find out the relationship between Xia ruofei and Tian Huilan. Xia ruofei was no longer a rookie who had just retired from the military. He had been practicing Tai Chi without leaving any traces.

In this way, Xia ruofei’s image in he kun’s heart became even more mysterious.

Soon, everyone started boarding.

He kun’s Secretary sat in Economy Class, while Xia ruofei and he kun sat next to each other in business class.

After the plane took off, Xia ruofei took out the documents and started to discuss the project with he kun.

He kun listened attentively. From time to time, he picked up the documents that Xia ruofei had prepared for him and flipped through them. After all, he was in charge of coordinating the project when he arrived in Beijing. Naturally, he had to understand the situation first.

After Xia ruofei finished, he kun had a rough idea of what was going on.

He secretly heaved a sigh of relief because this matter shouldn’t be too difficult. The approval of a Chinese medicine preparation was much easier than that of Western medicine. As for the description that it had a certain effect on autism, he kun didn’t think much of it.
