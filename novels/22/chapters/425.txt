Chapter 426: Trouble at the door (1)

The night had just fallen, and the lights were dim.

On the campus of Sanshan University, some students were walking to the internet cafe outside the school in groups of three to five, some were heading to the sports field in sports attire, and many were rushing to the self – study rooms with books in their hands.

The flashy Knight XV walked through the campus, earning a lot of heads.

Xia ruofei specially found a place that was relatively far away from Lu You’s dormitory and very secluded to park the car.

Lu You didn’t say much along the way. She just sat quietly in the front passenger seat in a daze. It was only when the car stopped that she woke up from her dream and said,””Ah! We’ve arrived ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”miss Lu, what were you thinking about on the way here?” I feel like I’m in a daze!”

Lu You was a little depressed. She said softly,””Nothing ... Xia ruofei, thank you for sending me back. I ... I’m leaving ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””En, quickly go back! I don’t want your classmate to worry. ”

The look of disappointment on Lu You’s face disappeared in a flash. She unbuckled her seat belt silently, opened the door, and got out of the car.

Just as she took two steps, she suddenly heard Xia ruofei call out,””Lu You!”

A hint of joy flashed in Lu You’s eyes. She quickly turned her head and asked,””What is it?”

“I’ll keep what happened yesterday a secret,”said Xia ruofei,” but you have to remember not to go to such a dangerous place again. ”

The trace of anticipation in Lu You’s eyes gradually dissipated. She lowered her head and said softly,””I know, goodbye ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and waved at Lu You. Then, he stepped on the accelerator and the Knight XV off – Road vehicle drove away from Lu You.

Lu You turned back and looked in the direction that Xia ruofei had left in. She only let out a sigh after the tail lights of Knight XV had disappeared and walked back to the dormitory.

After Xia ruofei left Sanshan University, he did not return to Taoyuan farm. Instead, he asked Ling Qingxue out for a meal. After the meal, the two of them even went to Sanshan square to watch a movie. After the movie ended, Xia ruofei went shopping with Ling Qingxue. The two of them were usually busy with their own things and did not have much time to date, so they treasured their time together.

Xia ruofei even gave Ling Qingxue three portions of jaded skin ointment. It looked like he had found it in the trunk of the car, but in reality, Xia ruofei had taken it out of the spirit map space when Ling Qingxue’s line of sight was blocked and put it in a paper bag in the trunk.

Ling Qingxue was a natural beauty. She was tall and slender. Even Xia ruofei was mesmerized by her long, elastic legs. After using the jaded skin cream recently, her skin became even more tender and delicate.

Xia ruofei almost couldn’t control himself. Lu You’s youthful and beautiful body yesterday had already made him feel a little angry, but he had been suppressing it forcefully. Today, ever since they met, Ling Qingxue had been sticking to Xia ruofei. Whether it was watching a movie or shopping, she would always hold Xia ruofei’s arm tightly. Her delicate body was tightly pressed against Xia ruofei ‘s. As they rubbed their heads against each other, Xia ruofei’s heart naturally itched even more and he couldn’t bear it.

It was a pity that Ling Xiaotian was also at their Riverside Villa today. Naturally, Xia ruofei could not go back to have sex with Ling Qingxue. Xia ruofei wanted Ling Qingxue to follow him back to Tao Yuan farm, but Ling Qingxue hesitated for a long time before rejecting him. After all, she was a girl, and it was definitely not good for her to not return at night. Although Ling Xiaotian might not mind, Ling Qingxue was still too thin – skinned.

Xia ruofei was also helpless about this. He could only send Ling Qingxue home like a gentleman and then drive back to Taoyuan farm alone.

For the next few days, Xia ruofei was very well – behaved and basically stayed in Taoyuan farm. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Of course, he had also been paying attention to the local news these few days. Although the news did not report the conflict at the zero degree dream bar that night, he did not take it lightly. These days, he had been living in seclusion, trying to avoid showing his face in the city.

In reality, Xia ruofei was so careful because he had promised Lu You to keep her secret. If he had told Tian Huilan directly, not only would he be fine, but Fang Luo and his gang would not be able to escape from prison even if they were disabled. They might even get shot.

All these years, Fang Luo had caused quite a bit of trouble for girls. If Tian Huilan were to get involved in this matter personally, then all the things that he had done would definitely be exposed. They would find out everything about him. Even stealing a dog when he was young would not be able to escape the investigation.

However, since he had promised Lu You, Xia ruofei could only be more careful and wait for this period of time to pass.

After all, if they were to strictly follow the law, even if Xia ruofei had a reason to save her, he would still be suspected of intentional injury if he were to be so heavy – handed.

However, there was no such thing as an impervious wall in this world. Moreover, there were many guests in the bar when Xia ruofei had rushed in that day.

Hence, even though Xia ruofei lived in seclusion on the farm, trouble still came knocking on his door.

It had only been two days since the incident at the zero degree dream bar.

One day, Xia ruofei was strolling around the orchard with lightning when he received a call from Lei Hu, saying that a few police officers had come to the farm to look for him.

Xia ruofei was mentally prepared for this. He immediately turned around and walked down the mountain.

When he arrived at the villa, Xia ruofei saw a valiant female police officer standing in front of his Knight XV off – Road vehicle. Her eyes were filled with adoration.
