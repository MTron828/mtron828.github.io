Translator: 549690339

Hearing this, everyone couldn’t help but laugh. Seeing the stone puppet’s deflated expression, they felt like laughing.

Xia ruofei smiled.”The symptoms of qi deficiency can be gradually alleviated through diet therapy. In addition, I can help you get rid of the symptoms of chest tightness immediately.”

“Really?” The stone puppet asked, its eyes wide.

“It’s effective with one shot!” Xia ruofei smiled faintly, with the air of a famous Chinese medicine practitioner.”Do you want to try?”

“Yes, yes, yes!” Shi Yang hurriedly said.

Compared to the others, Shi Yang had no doubts about Xia ruofei’s medical skills. Although her chest tightness and shortness of breath were not fatal, it had troubled her for a long time. She had to take deep breaths from time to time, which made her feel very uncomfortable.

“How do you do acupuncture?” Shi Xiao asked with anticipation. Do you need a room?”

After speaking, Shi Yang’s face became slightly hot. If she had to take off her clothes for acupuncture, she would not be able to accept it in front of a young man like Xia ruofei.

The crowd looked at Xia ruofei with an ambiguous look. They felt that this guy was really good at picking up girls! With just a few light words, he could get close to a beautiful woman ...

On the other hand, Song Wei and Lu You’s gazes were more threatening.

Xia ruofei felt like he was sitting on pins and needles. He quickly waved his hand and said,””No, no, it’s not that complicated! This place will do!”

With that, Xia ruofei stood up and walked to the side. He searched in his bag. In fact, he took out his set of silver needles from the medium.

He then walked to the stone puppet’s seat. Liu Zhe, who was beside the stone puppet, quickly stood up and said,””Brother Xia, you sit here!”

Xia ruofei did not stand on ceremony. He nodded at Liu Zhe and sat down. Then, he slowly opened the box.

Looking at the long silver needles, the stone puppet was a little afraid. Xia ruofei smiled gently and said,””Don’t be nervous. Stretch out your right hand. It won’t hurt!”

How could it not hurt when such a long needle was in her hand? Shi Yang didn’t believe it at all, but she had already developed blind trust in Xia ruofei’s medical skills, so she still gathered her courage and stretched out her hand.

The others stared at Xia ruofei without blinking.

Xia ruofei did not seem to be embarrassed under the gazes of so many people. With a faint smile on his face, he picked up a silver needle.

The stone puppet saw the shining silver needles and closed its eyes in fear.

Xia ruofei easily reached out his hand and inserted the silver needle into the Neiguan point on the stone puppet’s right wrist.

The stone puppet only felt as if it had been bitten by a mosquito, and then a tingling feeling came from its arm. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

She mustered her courage to open her eyes and saw that the silver needle was already stuck in her arm. As Xia ruofei twisted it, the end of the needle was shaking slightly. She was so frightened that she quickly closed her eyes again.

If there were any Chinese medicine experts present, they would be amazed by Xia ruofei’s technique.

However, all the people present were laymen, so they could only knock for fun at most.

Even so, they felt that Xia ruofei’s technique was quite wonderful. Although they could not tell what was good about it, it was so comfortable and harmonious, as if the person and the needle were one.

This was not an illusion.

The realm of human – Needle unity was not an exaggeration. However, there were very few people who could reach this realm. Even those well – known Chinese medical Masters might not be able to reach this realm.

Xia ruofei was able to do this not only because of his high spiritual cultivation, but also because of the precious Traditional Chinese Medicine books in the human jade talisman.

The stone puppet was extremely nervous. She felt her arm become more and more sore, as if a warm current was entering her body from the acupuncture point. Her whole body felt like she was bathing in a hot spring, so comfortable that she was about to moan.

After a while, Xia ruofei reached out and easily retrieved the silver needle without any hesitation.

The stone puppet’s eyes were still tightly shut. Xia ruofei’s voice rang in her ears.”Alright! Done!”

Shi Yang opened her eyes and realized that Xia ruofei had already kept the silver needle. She asked in surprise,””It’s done? It really doesn’t hurt at all!”

Xia ruofei arranged the silver needles and smiled.””It’s just a small problem. One needle is enough. Feel it ...”He said.

Only then did the stone puppet come back to her senses. She tried to take a few breaths, and then pressed a few times on her towering chest in disbelief, causing the men present to almost drool.

Shi Yang revealed a pleasantly surprised expression and loudly said, “It’s really not boring at all! Brother Xia, you’re too godly!”

Xia ruofei closed the box of silver needles, stood up and smiled.””It’s just a small trick, not worth mentioning ...”

Lu You saw Xia ruofei’s smug look and couldn’t help but roll her eyes at him. What a pretentious prick ...

Xia ruofei’s display of his skills had completely stunned these people. They had never seen such magical medical skills before. After a moment of silence, these people scrambled to say,””Brother Xia, please help me take a look too!”

“There’s me, there’s me ...”

Xia ruofei returned to his seat, cleared his throat, and said,””Don’t worry, I said that I’ll do voluntary diagnosis for you today! One by one ...”

Song Wei turned her head and looked at Xia ruofei deeply. She was worried that these rich men would not say anything because of her, but they would not think much of Xia ruofei. Now it seemed that she had worried too much.

Xia ruofei was such an amazing person. No matter where he went, even if he wanted to keep a low profile, he would inadvertently become the focus of everyone.

Moreover, he had the intention of showing off his skills today to shock these young masters and young mistresses.

These usually arrogant young masters and young mistresses all lined up obediently while Xia ruofei sat firmly in his seat.

When he saw Song Wei and Lu You standing up, he quickly said,””I say ... You two don’t have to join in the fun, right? I’m about to become your private doctor! If there’s something wrong with the two of you, wouldn’t that be a slap to your brother’s face?”

Lu You and Song Wei looked at each other and smiled.

“We’re just making space for miracle doctor Xia!”Song Wei pouted. I don’t want to delay your treatment!”

Xia ruofei looked up and laughed,”I like to hear that ...”

“Brother Xia, I’ll go first, I’ll go first!” Liu Zhe was the first to speak.

Xia ruofei took Liu Zhe’s pulse and whispered into his ear,””Liu Zhe, you’ve been having a bit of a ringing in your ears recently, and you have headaches occasionally, right? Your problem isn’t that big, but it’s not that small either. I’ll give you a prescription to recuperate, but you have to control that area. This is a sign of kidney deficiency!”

Although Xia ruofei’s voice was very low, it was still heard by Shi Xiao. This girl had already finished reading and did not go to line up. She was standing beside Xia ruofei in secret!

She immediately laughed and said,”haha!” Liu Zhe’s kidney is weak ...”

Everyone burst into laughter, and a few girls also laughed with their faces red. However, they all looked at Liu Zhe with a strange expression.

“Shi gan, you and I are irreconcilable!” Liu Zhe’s face turned green.

Xia ruofei didn’t care too much. He wrote down a prescription and handed it to Liu Zhe. Then, without looking up, he said,””Next!”

In truth, he had long since discovered that the stone puppet was eavesdropping, but he had intentionally lowered his voice to just enough for the stone puppet to hear.

Who asked Liu Zhe to be the first one to come out and ask about him? Hehe ...

“You’re in good health, and you have the habit of running long distances, right? That’s a good thing, but you have to pay attention to the wear and tear of your knees due to excessive exercise. It’s best to stop running for a while. ”

“It’s chronic gastritis. I’ll give you a prescription, and you’ll see the effects in a week!”

“There’s nothing wrong with it, but you sprained your ankle two days ago, right? Come, come, come, I’ll be fine with a needle!”

......

In a short while, Xia ruofei had looked through everyone.

These, these popinjays were completely convinced.

Xia ruofei only needed to take a few glances or check their pulse to accurately tell their situation without any mistakes.

A few of them who received treatment on the spot also felt the effects immediately.

This was a true godly doctor!

The way everyone looked at Xia ruofei changed. They all kept the prescription carefully.

No one doubted Xia ruofei’s magical medical skills anymore.
