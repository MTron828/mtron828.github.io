“President Xia! President Feng! Welcome, welcome!” Zeng jianzhang said with a red face.

“Secretary Zeng, you’re too kind!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”we can’t afford to be welcomed by you personally!” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Where? President Xia’s decision can be said to benefit the 700000 people of Changping!” Zeng jianzhang laughed and said,”anyone who can help the development of our Changping County is our honored guest! Of course I have to personally welcome him!”

Zeng jianzhang was a wily old fox in the system, so these polite words naturally came out of his mouth.

Xia ruofei said a few humble words and walked into the hotel with Zeng jianzhang.

The contract signing ceremony was at 10 O’ clock. Before that, Xia ruofei and the others were arranged to rest in a lounge next to the conference hall, accompanied by Zeng jianzhang.

Xia ruofei saw that Wu Liqian looked tired and was still busy with the signing ceremony. He couldn’t help but feel concerned. He wanted to let Wu Liqian sit down and rest, but he thought about it and decided not to.

Xia ruofei knew that the more Wu Liqian did, the greater her achievements would be. It would be best if she could complete it all by herself and the other leaders could not interfere.

At Teno’ clock sharp, all the reporters in the conference hall were already there. The photojournalists were busy looking for seats to set up their machines, while the text journalists were mostly editing scripts or conceptualizing today’s press release on their laptops. Some people were also chatting with other media reporters who were familiar with them.

The lights in the conference hall changed, and the lights on the podium in front were brighter.

The next moment, Zeng jianzhang and Xia ruofei walked out side by side, followed by Zhu zhihang, Wu Liqian, Feng Jing, and Xue Jinshan.

The stage lots were already set up on the stage, and everyone took their seats according to their names. The venue gradually quieted down.

The reporters looked curiously at Xia ruofei, who was sitting beside Zeng jianzhang.

The notice of the interview they had received was not very detailed. It only said that the government of the Changping County party Committee had important news on investment attracting and now that Xia ruofei had appeared at the press conference, it meant that the news about the construction of a branch of the Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory that had been spreading around was true. Furthermore, this project that had become popular had been pulled in by Changping County?

The reporters ‘interest was immediately piqued. The reporters who had originally wanted to come over to take a transportation fee, then take a draft and go back to edit it. If the coverage was enough, they would post a piece of news for the sake of Changping County, but they also put away their indifferent attitude and looked towards the stage.

Ever since the qiuhang incident, Xia ruofei’s popularity on the internet had not decreased. As long as he updated his Weibo, even if there was nothing interesting, there would be thousands of comments at the end. This kind of popularity could not even be compared to some a – list celebrities.

It could be said that Xia ruofei was now the main source of traffic. As long as there was news related to him, it would definitely be a hit.

As a reporter, which one of them didn’t want the news they wrote to be a hit?

After everyone was seated, Wu Liqian, who was sitting on the far left side of the podium, opened the microphone in front of her. She was the emcee of today’s signing ceremony.

Zeng jianzhang had arranged for Wu Liqian to host the signing ceremony, which was also a form of recognition of Wu Liqian’s position in the project.

Wu Liqian looked around at the reporters below the stage and said,””Thank you to all the media friends present for coming to our signing ceremony and press conference today! First of all, please allow me to introduce the leaders and guests who will be attending the signing ceremony!”

“They’re ... The Secretary of the committee of Changping County, comrade Zeng jianzhang! Zhu zhihang, head of the Changping County People’s Government! Mr. Xia ruofei, Chairman of paradise Corporation! Mrs. Wu Liqian, the president of paradise Corporation! Mr. Xue Jinshan, the director of Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory! I’m Wu Liqian, the deputy head of Changping County. I’ll be the host of today’s press conference!” Wu Liqian said.

There was a round of sparse applause from the audience.

“Next, I’ll first invite Secretary Zeng to announce the news!” Wu Liqian said.

Zeng jianzhang opened the microphone in front of him with a smile, cleared his throat, and said,””Welcome to the media. I have good news to announce today. After a long discussion, the Paradise Corporation has decided to build a branch of the Paradise pharmaceutical factory in Changping County!”

The reporters had an “I knew it” look on their faces, and all of them were eager to ask questions.

However, it wasn’t time for the media to ask questions yet, so they could only suppress their anxiety and listen carefully to Zeng jianzhang’s speech on stage.

“As we all know, paradise Corporation is a high – Quality company with great potential for development. The Jade skin cream produced by paradise pharmaceutical factory is popular all over the world, and the heart – nourishing soup has also benefited countless families with autism. I think it means a lot to our Changping to have such a company choose Changping!” Zeng jianzhang said,”first, it’s about the social influence ...”

Zeng jianzhang’s speech had a lot of formal words, but the reporters had also recorded the entire process with their recording pens.

In the end, Zeng jianzhang said with a smile,”I can reveal a few specific figures to you here. The total investment amount for this project is more than 1.5 billion. The initial capital for the first phase is as high as 500 million! And after the completion of the Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory, it would provide at least 500 jobs in Changping County! It was foreseeable that the factory manager of Taoyuan pharmaceutical would become a booster for the economic growth of Changping County! I’m full of confidence in this!”

The reporters applauded enthusiastically, not because Zeng jianzhang’s speech was wonderful, but because he had finally finished ...

“Thank you, Secretary Zeng!” Wu Liqian said,”let’s welcome Mr. Xia ruofei, the chairman of the peach blossom company, to speak!”

Xia ruofei smiled and patted the microphone lightly. Then, he moved closer to the microphone and said,””Thank you, reporter friends, for coming! Why do I feel that all of you look so familiar! We’ve been seeing each other a little too many times recently!”

The reporters in the audience suddenly laughed. A bolder female reporter said loudly,””This means that you’ve been especially popular recently, President Xia!”

“Hahaha! I don’t know if it’ll be popular or not! “I knew I had to be more careful when dealing with you guys. Once I’m not careful with my words, you’ll immediately magnify them ...” Xia ruofei said half – jokingly.

“President Xia, you’re the pride of our three mountains! We definitely won’t slander you!” The female reporter said loudly. She looked like a fan of Xia ruofei.

“I’ll remember that! The next time I see any negative news about me in the newspapers or on the internet, I’ll come to you!” Xia ruofei said.

“No problem!” The female reporter patted her chest and said. The shaking waves made the male reporter beside her steal a few glances.

Xia ruofei’s casual conversation with the reporter drew everyone closer.

In fact, in some foreign talk shows or speeches, a joke would usually be told on stage to make the atmosphere a little more relaxed.

Xia ruofei continued,”alright!” Let’s get back to the main topic! The Paradise Corporation had chosen Changping County after rigorous inspection and verification. “First of all, I would like to thank Changtai County and the other districts. For the location of the Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory branch, our company has almost gone to all the districts and counties around the three mountains. Wherever we go, we receive a warm welcome. Thank you!”

“Although we chose Changping this time, I believe that the pharmaceutical factory will expand again.” Xia ruofei said,”we will have many opportunities to work together in the future!”

Then, Xia ruofei said,”I don’t want to introduce the project of the Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory.” Thank you to the leaders of Changping County, you’ve provided us with a series of favorable policies that we can’t refuse. It can be said that you’re protecting the stable start and rapid development of the pharmaceutical factory!”

Next, Xia ruofei briefly introduced the factory’s scale, the number of production lines, estimated production capacity, the number of jobs available, expected annual interest tax, and so on. After the introduction, Xia ruofei ended his speech.

Wu Liqian followed the procedure and said,””The next stage is the signing of the letter of intent between the peach blossom company and Changping County! Please welcome Secretary Zeng and Chairman Xia!”
