Chapter 581: The king of fish (1)

With the roar of the engine, the Knight XV off – Road vehicle arrived at the entrance of Ling Xiaotian’s jiangbin villa.

The smart access control system flickered, and the iron door slid open silently.

Xia ruofei drove straight into the villa’s courtyard.

Ling Xiaotian and Ling Qingxue were walking out of the mansion. Ling Qingxue’s eyes were filled with joy as she looked at Xia ruofei from time to time.

Lin Shengnan, the female bodyguard that Xia ruofei had hired for Ling Qingxue, also walked out of the villa. She was just two steps behind Ling Qingxue. Even at home, she still dressed neatly and looked around vigilantly from time to time.

Xia ruofei looked at Ling Qingxue with a smile and nodded at her. Then, he said to Ling Xiaotian,””Uncle Ling, I’m really sorry to have disturbed you so late at night!”

Ling Xiaotian laughed and said,”we’re all family, there’s no need to be so polite!” RUO Fei, the rays are being kept in the warm water tank in the kitchen. I’ll Take You There!”

“Thank you, uncle Ling!” Xia ruofei said.

Ling Xiaotian led the way in front while Xia ruofei walked side by side with Ling Qingxue. Naturally, he held onto Ling Qingxue’s soft hands.

In front of her father and the bodyguards, Ling Qingxue appeared to be a little shy. She tried to struggle out of Xia ruofei’s grip, but Xia ruofei held on tightly. She could not help but roll her eyes at Xia ruofei.

Ling Qingxue then sneaked a look to her left and right. The bodyguard Lin Shengnan was looking straight ahead, ignoring the intimate scene between the two. Ling Xiaotian was walking in front and did not seem to notice Xia ruofei’s small movements. Ling Qingxue finally relaxed a little and let Xia ruofei hold her soft hand.

Soon, the group arrived at the big kitchen in the villa.

In a corner of the kitchen was a constant temperature water tank. A light blue indicator light emitted a faint light. It came with a battery that could maintain the water temperature in the tank according to the user’s design.

......

Ling Xiaotian subconsciously lightened his footsteps and said in a low voice,””Ruofei, pomfrets are very timid. You must be very careful when you move them. Generally speaking, they will die from shock during fishing. This pair of live pomfrets are really precious!”

“I understand, uncle Ling,” Xia ruofei nodded.

Through the transparent glass of the heated water tank, Xia ruofei could see two 30 – centimeter – long fish swimming slowly. Although he couldn’t see clearly, he was still excited.

Ling Xiaotian pointed at the water tank and said,”this is the legendary ‘King of fish’. RUO Fei, let me tell you, how delicate is this Chinese perch?” As long as someone touches its scales, it will stop moving immediately. That’s why Su Dongpo once called it ‘cherishing scale fish’. However, the scales of Chinese perch are the most delicious, so they are not scaled when cooking. Its scales are fine and rich in high – Quality fat and colloid protein. After cooking, they become semi – melted jelly and taste very delicious in the mouth. Not only is it good in taste, but it also has excellent calcium and beauty effects. ”

As Ling Xiaotian spoke, he couldn’t help but look at the two pomfrets in the water tank with some reluctance.

It had been more than ten years since he had tried Pomfret. He had tried it a few times when he was young and it still left an endless aftertaste. It was not easy for him to get two pomfrets by chance, but Xia ruofei had taken them away so suddenly. He was really reluctant to part with them.

Ling Qingxue, who was watching from the side, rebuked,””Dad! Why are you like a greedy cat? If you keep saying that, he won’t even dare to take RUO Fei ...”

“Qingxue, how could you talk to uncle Ling like that?” Xia ruofei quickly said.

Ling Xiaotian said in a self – deprecating manner,”it’s okay, it’s okay. Ruofei, ever since my daughter got together with you, my position in her heart has automatically dropped by one place. Girls should always be outside!”

Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but blush and weakly argued,””I didn’t ...”

Ling Xiaotian laughed and said,”let’s not talk about this anymore. RUO Fei, take the fish!” In the future, if you really breed the Yangtze River Pomfret, don’t forget to send me a few as soon as possible!”

“Definitely, definitely!” Xia ruofei quickly said,”my friend’s research has reached a certain level. I don’t think you’ll have to wait too long!”

Xia ruofei said this as a warning. He had the spirit map space where time flowed thirty times faster. The breeding of the rays would be very fast in the space. It would definitely be much faster than the normal cycle. With what he said today, when Xia ruofei started to breed the rays on the farm in the future, it would not arouse Ling Xiaotian’s suspicion.

“That’s good!” Ling Xiaotian said happily before continuing,”however, you should also be prepared for the difficult times! Pomfrets mainly live in the sea, but they migrate back to the river to lay eggs in the early summer, so it’s not easy to get them to adapt to freshwater farming!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”we have our own ways. Don’t worry!” With these two pure wild Chinese perch, our research progress will speed up a lot. Just wait for our good news!”

Xia ruofei was not too worried about the growth environment of pomfrets. He had done some research in advance and knew that pomfrets could actually survive in freshwater. At present, many artificial farms of pomfrets in the United States desalinated the salt in the environment by means of a ladder so that the pomfrets could slowly adapt to the freshwater environment.
