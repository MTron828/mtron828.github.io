In fact, from an objective point of view, Mallorca had more or less used some “lying on the grass tactics” in the second half. With just a little physical contact, he would fall to the ground in an exaggerated manner, especially after the 70th or 80th minute. There were people falling to the ground with “cramps” and the main referee had to interrupt the game again and again.

When Xia ruofei was watching the game, he was much more relaxed than the other RCD Espanyol players. The game had just entered injury time when another Mallorca player fell to the ground, clutching his thigh in pain. The Sevilla player next to him also looked helpless. There was no physical contact between the two men at all. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

After the referee blew the whistle to stop the game, the Mallorca player indicated that he had a cramp. Many Sevilla players showed dissatisfaction, while the Mallorca players nervously went over to press on the player’s leg. The referee could only signal the team doctor to enter the field.

“From what I can see in the second half of the match, Mallorca’s team doctor is probably the most tired ... I’m even worried that their team doctor might get cramps from all the running ...” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

The Spaniards ‘players burst into laughter.

In fact, although Spain’s strength wasn’t very strong, their professional ethics in the game were good. They rarely deliberately delayed time in the game.

However, when they were watching this match, none of them showed any contempt for Mallorca. In fact, they were secretly hoping that Mallorca would be even more shameless and drag the time out a little longer.

Under the continuous demands of the referee and the protests of the Sevilla players, the team doctor helped the Mallorca player out of the field. They had wanted to go out from the sidelines, but the referee stopped them in time and let them leave the field from the end line.

After Mallorca’s player left the field, he jumped on the spot and became lively again. He quickly ran to the sidelines and raised his hand to signal to the referee that he wanted to get back into the game.

The main referee was probably a little displeased with Mallorca’s behavior, so he turned a blind eye to it and dropped the ball first, letting Sevilla kick off first. The Sevilla players had not committed a foul just now, and the game was blown to a stop because of an injury. So, after the game resumed, the ball was still on Sevilla’s side.

Sevilla immediately took the ball and launched an attack. The Mallorca player waited anxiously on the sidelines, his hands almost sore from raising the ball. The referee finally turned his head to look at him and then waved to signal him to enter the field.

In the end, the game’s actual injury time reached more than six minutes. This was also the referee’s compensation for Mallorca’s delay in the injury time period to Sevilla.

However, sevilia was indeed lacking in luck in this game. The bombardment in the final stage still could not penetrate Mallorca’s goal. In the end, they could only pay for a low – Level mistake in the first half and lose the away game with a score of 0:1.

When the referee finally blew the whistle to end the game, the El prate locker room burst into loud cheers. The Spanish players hugged each other in celebration, happier than when their team had won.

Xia ruofei, Wu Lei, Zhou leiyun, and Ruby hugged and celebrated. After the result of this match was out, no matter what the other teams ‘results were, the Spanish team was guaranteed to be in seventh place at the end of this round.

In other words, the Spanish team had already taken half a step into the European arena!
