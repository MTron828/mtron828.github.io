In fact, he had done the same when he was excavating the yellow jade essence.

It was very easy to set up a time array with array flags. It could be completed in a few breaths. After setting up the time array, the process of digging out the yellow jade essence was very time – saving.

Xia ruofei said to Ling Qingxue and pulled her into the effective range of the time array flag. Then, he took out a shovel from the spirit map space and started digging without a word.

Xia ruofei was already very familiar with digging for the yellow jade essence. After a minute or two, he had successfully retrieved a piece of yellow jade essence.

Xia ruofei immediately threw the yellow jade essence into the bag hanging in front of his chest.

However, he didn’t take back the time array flag. Instead, he took off his backpack and put it on the ground. Then he said to Ling Qingxue,””Qingxue! Sit down now and absorb the Topaz essence in the time formation. If you absorb all the Topaz essence in your backpack, you should have more than enough time!” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Ling Qingxue nodded and sat cross – legged on the ground. She then asked,””RUO Fei, what about you?”

“There’s still about an hour left. I’ll continue to look for the yellow jade essence. It’s good stuff, the more the better!” Xia ruofei said,”I will set up some alarm and protection arrays around the time array. You don’t have to go anywhere. Just pay attention to your safety. I’ve been to many places on the 4th level of the trial Pagoda and I’ve never encountered any danger, so you don’t have to worry!”

“It’s better for you to keep it!” Ling Qingxue said,”the increase in your spiritual power will be of even greater help!”

Xia ruofei smiled and shook his head.””I’ve already absorbed more than two thousand pieces of yellow jade essence. This thing doesn’t have much effect on me. Time is precious, so I won’t talk to you any longer. I have to hurry to the next location!”

Xia ruofei told a white lie. In fact, after using the Topaz multiple times, the effect did not decrease. At least until now, Xia ruofei did not feel that the Topaz Essence’s effect of improving mental strength had significantly decreased.

However, if he did not say so, Ling Qingxue would definitely not be willing to absorb the yellow jade essence.

As expected, Ling Qingxue immediately nodded and said,””Alright then! You be careful!”

“Don’t worry! There’s no danger here, but after we enter the Tower of Trials “fifth level, we have to be careful. If my guess is correct, I’m afraid that the difficulty of the mission will increase again from the fifth level onwards. If we’re not careful, we might even lose our lives!” Xia ruofei said seriously,”that’s why we have to improve our strength as much as possible! Therefore, you’re absorbing the yellow jade essence not only to help yourself, but also to relieve the pressure on me, do you understand?”

Ling Qingxue would never go against Xia ruofei on such an important matter. She nodded obediently and said,””Mm! Don’t worry! I will work hard to absorb it!”

Xia ruofei caressed Ling Qingxue’s hair gently and stepped out of the time formation. Then, he set up a warning and protection formation around the time formation as quickly as he could.

He looked at Ling Qingxue, who was absorbing the yellow jade Essence’s energy, and took out his curved Frost Flying sword. He stepped on the flying sword and quickly flew toward the next location where the yellow jade essence was.

Xia ruofei still had a few hundred pieces of Topaz essence in his bag. He decided to let Ling Qingxue absorb them in the shortest time possible.

After all, it was unlikely that they would be able to find the yellow jade essence again in the future. Ling Qingxue’s cultivation level was still relatively low, including her spiritual power cultivation. In theory, the lower the cultivation base, the more obvious the yellow jade Essence’s improvement effect would be.

Therefore, if Ling Qingxue absorbed a few hundred pieces of yellow jade essence, she would be able to increase her spiritual power by a large amount, and it would be almost certain for her to break through to the next realm. If Xia ruofei were to absorb it, it would have very limited effect on his improvement. As for breaking through to the spiritualisation boundary directly, it was impossible. He would probably only have a slight chance if the Topaz essence was multiplied by ten times.

However, there was not enough time. Hence, Xia ruofei felt that letting Ling Qingxue absorb the Topaz essence was the most cost – effective choice.

After all, if one’s mental strength was a lot higher than one’s true Qi cultivation while in the Qi refining stage, it would be very beneficial for later cultivation and the stability of one’s Foundation.

This benefit would run through the entire cultivation process. The stronger one’s mental power, the stronger one’s brain function would be. One’s understanding of cultivation would be much stronger than that of ordinary cultivators of the same level.

Xia ruofei naturally wanted to help Ling Qingxue grasp this opportunity that would bring her long – term benefits.

His only thought now was to dig up more yellow jade essence. Even one more would be of great help to Ling Qingxue.

Without the help of the time array flag, Xia ruofei’s digging speed of the yellow jade essence would be slower. However, he could not care less. There was only one set of time array flag. If he used it, Ling Qingxue would not be able to use it. With so much yellow jade essence, even he would not be able to absorb it all in the remaining time without the help of the time array, let alone Ling Qingxue.

Xia ruofei’s figure flew across the fourth level of the trial Pagoda. He could be seen waving his shovel everywhere where the Topaz essence was.

Other than seizing every second to dig out the yellow jade essence, he had also been paying attention to the countdown on the Tower of Trials.

This was because not only did he have to dig out as much yellow jade essence as possible, but he also had to calculate the time and distance. He had to return to Ling Qingxue’s side before the countdown ended. Otherwise, no matter how much yellow jade essence he dug out, he would not be able to take it with him, and the effect would be equivalent to zero.

As time passed, Xia ruofei was working at a high intensity. His forehead was even starting to sweat. Normally, this kind of low – intensity work would not make him sweat.

When Xia ruofei grabbed the last Topaz essence, there were only five minutes and fifty – eight seconds left on the mission timer in his perceptual vision.

Xia ruofei stuffed the yellow jade essence into the bag hanging in front of his chest and stepped onto the qushuang flying sword. At the same time, he put away the shovel on the ground and flew towards Ling Qingxue’s position on his flying sword.

Xia ruofei used his sword to fly as fast as he could while staring at the countdown in the perceptual mirror.

Five minutes ... Four minutes ... Three minutes ... Two minutes ...

When there was only one minute and twenty – seven seconds left, Xia ruofei finally arrived at Ling Qingxue’s position.

He jumped off the qushuang flying sword and stepped into the time array.

Xia ruofei threw his backpack on the ground and panted as he said to Ling Qingxue,””Qingxue, quickly absorb the remaining Topaz essence. We’re running out of time.”

In reality, Ling Qingxue had already finished absorbing the Topaz essence that Xia ruofei had left behind when time was flowing at a rate that was about 90 times faster than normal. However, she did not leave the time formation. Instead, she cultivated in the time formation while adapting to her condition after her spiritual power had increased tremendously.

Ling Qingxue knew that time was of the essence. Even with the effects of the array, she only had two hours left.

On this trip, Xia ruofei had dug up more than 100 Topaz essence, close to 200. If Xia ruofei were to absorb it himself, two hours would definitely be enough. However, since Ling Qingxue was the one absorbing it, he would have to put in more effort.

Therefore, Ling Qingxue nodded and sat down cross – legged without a word. She took out a piece of Topaz essence from her backpack and began to absorb it.

Xia ruofei had been paying attention to the mission time countdown in the perceptual mirror.

As Xia ruofei was also within the range of the time array flag, the mission time countdown in the perceptual mirror’s field of view was very slow. It would jump by one second every one and a half minutes to two minutes.

The remaining time was about two hours.

Ling Qingxue’s face was solemn as she continuously took out yellow jade essence from her bag to absorb it. Every time she finished absorbing it, she would not say a word and immediately take out a new piece.

When the mission time in the perceptual mirror’s field of view reached the last ten seconds, Ling Qingxue had just finished absorbing a piece of Topaz essence. When she reached into her bag to take it, she realized that her bag was empty.
