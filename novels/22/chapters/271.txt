Xia ruofei twisted his body without thinking. A gust of wind blew in his face and a fist brushed past the tip of his nose. In a flash, Xia ruofei reached out and accurately grabbed the attacker’s wrist. Then, he turned around, lowered his body, and did a standard over – Shoulder throw, easily throwing the attacker to the ground. Then, Xia ruofei flipped the attacker over and pressed his knee against his spine, twisting his hand to the back. The entire process only took one or two seconds. His actions were quite coherent and could be said to be done in one go. This was a completely subconscious reaction. At this moment, he saw that the Ambusher was wearing a black hood and the handle of a gun was faintly visible at his waist. Xia ruofei’s expression changed abruptly. This was elder song’s courtyard. How serious was the situation for an armed attacker to appear? He pulled the gun out of the attacker’s waist with lightning speed, then loaded the bullet with one hand and pointed the muzzle at the back of the attacker’s head. From the moment the Ambusher attacked to the moment he was subdued by Xia ruofei, he had no way of resisting. By the time he could react, a Cold Gun was already pointed at the back of his head. “Ruofei, ruofei, don’t shoot!” He shouted in fear. It’s me!” Xia ruofei heard the sound and frowned. He moved his hand that was holding the gun and took off the man’s hood. “Staff officer Xu?” Seeing this, Xia ruofei let go of his hand and frowned.”What are you up to?” he asked. Xu Wu grimaced in pain as he stood up. He rubbed his wrist and smiled bitterly.”RUO Fei, your strength seems to have improved greatly again. I can’t even resist when I’m in your hands. I could at least exchange a few moves with you in Hongzhou. ” In fact, Xu Wu did not know that this was because he did not have any intention to kill Xia ruofei. Otherwise, with Xia ruofei’s sharp senses, he would not even need to make a move. He would have already sensed the danger and attacked decisively. “You haven’t answered my question,” Xia ruofei said calmly. Xu Wu’s expression was a little awkward as he said,””Ruofei, I’m just afraid that you’ve been away from the Army for so long, and your vigilance ...” “So you’re using this method to test me?” Xia ruofei said with a frown. “I’m sorry ...” Xu Wu said carefully. “Staff officer Xu,” Xia ruofei said calmly,”I hope this will be the first and last time. Otherwise, don’t blame me for not showing you any respect!” In fact, Xia ruofei had a good time with Xu Wu during the days in Hongzhou. The two of them called each other brothers. After all, their similar military experiences made them naturally close in such an enclosed environment. However, Xu Wu’s way of testing him today made him very unhappy. This was a lack of trust in his ability, and at the same time, it was very impolite. “I see,” Xu Wu smiled awkwardly. “Ruofei, I hope you don’t take it to heart. I made this decision on my own. Even manager Lu didn’t know about it ...” “It’s mainly because the security mission this time is very important. I personally feel very stressed and can’t feel at ease ...”Xu Wu explained. Seeing Xu Wu’s sincere attitude, Xia ruofei’s face softened. He nodded and said,””Forget it, let’s not talk about this anymore. Let’s just turn the page!” “Alright!” Xu Wu nodded with a smile. They were all men in the Army. Both parties were not petty people. After Xu Wu’s apology, Xia ruofei’s unhappiness naturally disappeared. He did not have to keep such a small matter in mind. Xia ruofei asked,”staff officer Xu, manager Lu asked me to come and find you as soon as I arrived. You said that the security was under a lot of pressure. Tell me, what’s the situation?” Xu Wu smiled bitterly and said,”this time, the Bureau chief is going out in plain clothes. Strictly speaking, there are only the two of us as personal guards. When we arrived at Mount Wu Yi, because we didn’t inform the local government, some of the security outside was arranged by the song family. It’s definitely not professional enough, so it’s mainly the two of us!” Xia ruofei nodded and said,””I understand.” Xu Wu continued,”also, the Bureau chief insisted on taking the bullet train ...” “A train?” Xia ruofei was stunned. Elder song’s identity was very special. Such an important person would usually travel by private plane. If it was close, it would definitely be a bulletproof car. Even if there were public transportation, the carriage would be cleared. Those who looked no different from ordinary passengers were actually professional security personnel. If elder song wanted to take the train, it wouldn’t be like this. He didn’t want to attract so many people, so he chose to travel in plain clothes. If he chose the train, he must be with the ordinary passengers. It couldn’t be a special train. Otherwise, wouldn’t it attract even more people? As a result, the pressure on the security was much greater. “Yeah!” Xu Wu forced a smile and said. The situation at the station would be complicated, and there might be unknown dangers on the bus. All these needed to be prepared. That’s why I’m under a lot of pressure right now ...” Xia ruofei’s expression was still very relaxed as he said,””I know. Elder song must have wanted to empathize with the people. That’s why he chose to travel by train.” Xu Wu was stunned for a moment before he asked,”don’t you feel nervous, ruofei?” Don’t you feel the pressure?” “I don’t feel anything!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”anyway, security is your job. I’m just your assistant. If there’s any problem, I don’t have to bear the responsibility! Why should I be nervous?” Xu Wu’s eyes widened and he said with grief and indignation,””You ... How can you be so irresponsible?” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”how can I not be responsible?” I’ll seriously fulfill my duty as your assistant!” “I’ve really met a bad person ...” Xu Wu said with a bitter face,”no, you have to help me revise the plan again!” I’m worried that there’s something missing ...” “Alright, alright, alright, go ahead!” Xia ruofei said with a smile. Xu Wu asked Xia ruofei to sit down and poured him a glass of water. He sat opposite Xia ruofei and said,””The Bureau chief will set off early tomorrow morning. There will be comrades from the military unit at the front line from guling to the South train station. There will be sentries arranged on the mountain road. When you enter the station ...” Xia ruofei listened to Xu Wu’s proposal seriously and gave his own opinions and suggestions from time to time. Xia ruofei had a lot of experience in this area. The things he put forward were all details that Xu Wu had not considered thoroughly. Xu Wu nodded and wrote down Xia ruofei’s opinions with a pen. Very quickly, the two of them studied the plan from beginning to end. In the end, Xu Wu sighed and said,””Ruofei, it’s a pity for a talent like you to leave the Army! Why don’t I look for the Bureau chief and specially recruit you back! Our guard Bureau is in need of an all – rounder like you!” Xia ruofei quickly said,”come on!” Come on! I don’t know how comfortable I am now!” Xu Wu was just saying. He knew that everyone had their own aspirations and could not be forced. Besides, Xia ruofei had just left the Army and the possibility of him returning was almost zero. Xu Wu stood up and walked to the safe in the corner. He skillfully entered the password to open the safe and took out a small box. He walked to Xia ruofei. “This is for you. You have to help me keep it safe!” Xu Wu said. “What is it?” Xia ruofei asked. “You’ll know when you open it!” Xu Wu said with a smile. With a trace of doubt, Xia ruofei reached out to take the box and placed it on the coffee table. Then, he unlocked it and lifted the lid. Xia ruofei’s eyes lit up when he saw the contents of the box.
