Chapter 385: The correct usage of jaded skin ointment (2)

“Really?” Ling Qingxue asked, half – believing and half – doubting.

“How would I dare to lie to you?” Xia ruofei said confidently,”you’ll know soon. It’s definitely a surprise!”

“If you dare to lie to me, Hmph ...” Ling Qingxue wrinkled her nose and made a cute, fierce expression at Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but pinch Ling Qingxue’s nose lovingly. The two of them went upstairs together. Once they entered the room and closed the door, Xia ruofei hugged Ling Qingxue’s delicate body and pressed her against the door. He leaned over, wanting to kiss her.

Ling Qingxue giggled as she dodged to the left and right.””Didn’t you say you have a gift for me?”

“Let’s kiss first!”

“Let’s look at the gifts first!”

“Let’s kiss first!”

“Let’s see first ... Hmm ...”

Before Ling Qingxue could finish her sentence, Xia ruofei had already kissed that touch of warmth domineeringly. Ling Qingxue quickly reached out and wrapped her arms around Xia ruofei’s neck, passionately responding to his kiss.

After a long time, the two of them reluctantly separated.

Ling Qingxue rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei and said,””It’s not wrong to call you a Rascal!”

Xia ruofei laughed and pulled Ling Qingxue’s soft hands into her boudoir.

Xia ruofei held onto Ling Qingxue’s shoulder and gently pushed her to sit on the edge of the bed. Then, he opened his satchel and said with a smile,””Wife, how could I lie to you? I’ve really prepared a gift for you!”

As he spoke, Xia ruofei took out a small preservation box with the jaded skin cream and said,””Dangdangdangdang...The surprise is here!”

Ling Qingxue took the Tupperware, opened it, and looked at it with a puzzled expression. She asked,””RUO Fei, What is this? It’s quite fragrant, and there’s also a medicinal smell ...”

“Wife, this is called jaded skin cream. It’s a beauty makeup that I personally made. It’s made purely from Chinese medicine. It doesn’t contain any additives or chemicals. It’s absolutely natural!” Xia ruofei praised himself.”The effect of this jaded skin cream ... Tsk tsk! Whoever uses it will know!”

“Cosmetics? Or did you make it yourself?” Ling Qingxue said in surprise,”RUO Fei, you actually have this kind of ability?”

Xia ruofei chuckled,”this is also part of the health Science of Traditional Chinese Medicine!” They had all thought it through! Wife, this is actually recorded in an ancient prescription. It uses natural Chinese medicine and there will definitely be no side effects. You can use it without worry! And ... The medicine should be able to give you a surprise!”

“Then ... How do I use this?” Ling Qingxue asked.

“Just apply it on the parts that need to be taken care of like how you usually do facial masks. When this jadeskin ointment turns pale yellow, it means that the medicinal effect has been basically absorbed. You can wash it off. This process will take about half an hour!” Xia ruofei said.

“But ...” Xia ruofei continued,”before using the jaded skin ointment, it’s best to do a massage first. That’s more conducive to the absorption of the medicine.”

Ling Qingxue looked at Xia ruofei suspiciously and said,””Do you need a massage before making a Facial Mask? This is the first time I’ve heard of this ...”

Xia ruofei said seriously,”massage to promote blood circulation and promote blood circulation. Naturally, the effect of the jaded skin cream will be more easily absorbed by the skin!” There’s a scientific reason behind this!”

Xia ruofei saw that Ling Qingxue still wanted to say something and quickly said,””Wife, don’t say so much. Come, come, come, lie down. I’ll give you a massage first!”

With that, Xia ruofei held Ling Qingxue’s shoulders and laid her flat on the bed. Then, he chuckled and jumped onto the bed, starting to massage Ling Qingxue.

Naturally, Xia ruofei had just made up a lie that he needed to massage his whole body before using the jaded skin ointment. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

At the start, he was still quite well – behaved, and he massaged Ling Qingxue’s head and shoulders.

White – collared workers who worked in the office all year round would have problems with their shoulders or cervical vertebrae. Although Xia ruofei was not a professional masseuse, he had enough strength in his hands and his massage was quite good. Ling Qingxue could not help but let out a sigh of comfort.

However, Xia ruofei’s obedience was only for a short while and he soon became restless.

……

Suddenly, the sound of a car engine came from downstairs. Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue looked at each other and quickly sat up.

Ling Qingxue put on her clothes in a hurry as she said,””Hurry up, my dad must be back ...”

When Xia ruofei thought of Ling Xiaotian, he felt a little apprehensive. After all, he had just slept with his daughter in his villa. How could he not feel guilty?

Hence, Xia ruofei quickly searched for his own clothes from the messy pile of clothes on the ground and quickly put them on.

As the two of them were getting dressed, Ling Qingxue was still frantically tidying up her slightly messy hair when Ling Xiaotian’s voice came from outside the door,””Qingxue, RUO Fei, are you guys inside?”

“They’re coming!” Ling Qingxue quickly replied.

As she tidied her hair, she walked towards the door. She even used her eyes to signal Xia ruofei to quickly tidy up the messy bed.

How could Xia ruofei have time to tidy up? He just wiped the bedsheet a few times in a hurry. After it was roughly flat, he flipped the quilt over and shook it a few times, then laid it flat on the bed.

After the door opened, Ling Xiaotian was standing at the door, chuckling. Intentionally or otherwise, he glanced at Ling Qingxue, and then at the scene in the room.

Ling Qingxue blushed and said,”dad, you’re back?” Ruofe...Just now, you brought me...A face mask. Let’s go back to the room to try it out ...”

Ling Xiaotian was someone who had been through this. The redness on his daughter’s face had not completely faded! How could he not know what was going on?

In fact, at this moment, Ling Xiaotian’s heart was filled with a sour feeling.

His daughter was his father’s lover in his past life. He had watched his little lover in his past life grow up from an infant into a slender and beautiful young girl. Now, she had become someone else’s girlfriend. Moreover, it was obvious that the two of them had an intimate relationship. As a father, Ling Xiaotian would naturally feel a little disappointed.

However, Ling Xiaotian was quite satisfied with Xia ruofei as his future son – in – Law, so he quickly laughed and said,””It’s fine, it’s fine, you guys continue chatting! Remember to come down for dinner later ...”

With that, Ling Xiaotian nodded at Xia ruofei, turned around, and went downstairs.

After Ling Xiaotian left, Ling Qingxue glared at Xia ruofei and said,””It’s all your fault ...”

Xia ruofei scratched his head awkwardly. He did not expect the two of them to be crazy for the entire afternoon. Fortunately, they had already called it a day before Ling Xiaotian returned. Otherwise, it would have been even more awkward if Ling Xiaotian had knocked on the door for a long time before it opened.

Now that Ling Xiaotian had returned, the two of them naturally did not dare to stay in Ling Qingxue’s room.

The two of them walked down the stairs side by side. Ling Qingxue thought of the jaded skin cream and pinched Xia ruofei’s arm unhappily. She said in a low voice,””Tell me the truth, is that black thing in the box really a Facial Mask?”

“I’m sure!” Xia ruofei said confidently,”we don’t have time now. You’ll know when you try it before you go to bed tonight. The effect is definitely great!”

Ling Qingxue shot a glance at Xia ruofei and asked,””If no one’s giving me a full body massage at night, then I can’t use a face mask, right?”

Xia ruofei laughed awkwardly and said,””Actually ... It’s fine if you don’t massage me, but ... The absorption might be a little slower ...”

Ling Qingxue suddenly increased her strength and pinched Xia ruofei hard. She said,””I knew you were lying to me, you big pervert! Why are you so bad ...”
