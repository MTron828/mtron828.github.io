Song Wei’s video not only captured the entire process of the stadium turning off the lights and spraying water, but also clearly captured the bar?a fans leaving the stadium from the opposite stands because she was in the VIP box. Some of the bar?a fans laughed loudly and made some indecent gestures at the Espanyol players after the Spanish players were drenched.

“Weiwei, I didn’t expect you to be able to take these pictures!” Xia ruofei said in surprise.

“I wanted to take a picture of your celebration, but I didn’t expect to get this,” Song Wei said with a smile.

Ling Qingxue had also been watching the video with the two of them. She said,””This is solid evidence! Let’s see what that reporter has to say!”

Song Wei looked at Xia ruofei and asked,””RUO Fei, what do you plan to do?”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,””Don’t release this video yet!”

“Why?” Ling Qingxue asked in confusion,”you should have released the video to slap him in the face!”

Xia ruofei laughed.”Let’s wait and see for a while. Public opinion has not yet fermented. The Spanish clubs have not even officially responded!”

“That’s good,” Song Wei said thoughtfully.”But we can’t just do nothing. I think we should add some fuel to the fire ...”

Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue looked at each other. Ling Qingxue could not help but say,””Wei Wei, if you have any ideas, just say it out loud. Don’t keep me in suspense!”

“Look!” Song Wei laughed and said. In fact, the report of The Sports Daily was just a little biased. I guess the sports media on the Spain side is more or less biased and have their own teams to support. The people may have become used to it. In fact, the most infuriating thing is the content on this reporter’s personal social account, which is Facebook. ”

“That’s right!”Xia ruofei nodded.

After all, Facebook only represented himself, so Pablo’s comments on Facebook were much more outrageous than the articles he wrote in sports daily. It was Pablo’s content on Facebook that made Ling Qingxue so angry.

Song Wei continued,”this reporter isn’t a famous person. His Facebook influence can only be considered average. These few posts about yesterday’s competition might be explosive, but compared to the explosive posts on Weibo or the headlines in our country, it’s not just an order of magnitude!”

Ling Qingxue sensed something and asked,””Weiwei, you’re saying ... We should transfer this person’s post to China?”

“That’s right!”Song Wei smiled and nodded. Think about it, if we translate his posts word by word and take screenshots and post them on Weibo, what will the Chinese fans ‘reaction be?”

“Then it’ll definitely blow up!” Ling Qingxue said without even thinking,”to exaggerate a little, RUO Fei and Wu Lei are like gods in the hearts of the Chinese fans! This guy dared to blaspheme a God. The netizens of Huaxia will definitely let him see the power of the vast ocean of people’s war!”

“This is what I meant by adding fuel to the fire!” Song Wei smiled.

Ling Qingxue said,”if we really do that, the Chinese netizens will definitely climb over the wall to attack him!” Do you still remember the expedition of the Imperial Bar back then? That’s what you call “Grand and mighty”!”

Speaking of this, Ling Qingxue suddenly revealed a suspicious expression and asked,””Weiwei, this is satisfying, but didn’t you still let the reporter achieve his goal of creating hype? It was estimated that no one in Spain had ever seen such a large – scale online battle. Didn’t he become a celebrity all of a sudden? We’re having a good time scolding them, but they might be secretly happy!”

Xia ruofei revealed a thoughtful expression and said,””Qingxue, there’s still a difference ... If me, Wu Lei, Ruby, or the Spanish officials were to argue with a reporter, it would indeed be a bit degrading, and we would really be flattering him. But ...”

Then, Xia ruofei changed the topic and said,””If thousands of Chinese netizens flood into his Facebook account to scold him, it may be a different situation. These are just ordinary netizens and fans, and everyone climbed over the wall and left after scolding him. They won’t bring him any good reputation and will only leave a mess on his face. ”

Song Wei nodded in agreement and said,”Although objectively speaking, it will definitely increase his exposure, the netizens ‘comments are all scolding him. Even if he has a reputation, it won’t be a good one. He might even become a laughing stock!”

Xia ruofei replied,”yes!” Then, we’ll release the video that Wei Wei shot at the right time, and it’ll be confirmed! It means Pablo is lying and making things up, which goes against the most basic principle of authenticity for a reporter!”

Ling Qingxue also understood what he meant. She said excitedly,””When that time comes, he won’t be able to continue in this line of work! Hmph! Such a Bad Reporter should be taught a deep lesson!” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Xia ruofei and the other two looked at each other and smiled. Xia ruofei said,””Then let’s do this! I’ll do it!”

After that, he quickly took screenshots of the posts on Pablo’s Facebook about yesterday’s game. Then, he opened the PS software and translated Pablo’s Facebook into Chinese. He typed the screenshots in red font, which basically corresponded to Spanish.
