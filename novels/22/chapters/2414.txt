2415 The pain on the skin (1)

Xia ruofei said indifferently,”chief Liu, you’re being too serious. I’ve received the consultation fee. Naturally, I’m obligated to treat elder Liu.” But I have my own treatment plan, so I hope you won’t mess up my treatment plan next time. ”

Xia ruofei’s meaning was that he would come when it was time for a follow – up visit and not for them to call him on their own accord.

Liu Qunfeng couldn’t help but feel a little angry, but he was in a mess because of Liu haojun and didn’t have the time to be angry with Xia ruofei.

Moreover, he did not dare to offend Xia ruofei now, because the life and death of the White jade pillar of the Liu family, old master Liu, was in Xia ruofei’s hands!

So, Liu Qunfeng just nodded silently, gestured to Xia ruofei, and then led the way. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

The two of them soon arrived at elder Liu’s room.

When Xia ruofei entered the room, he saw that old master Liu’s face was ashen and his spirit was quite dispirited. There was a frown between his brows that could not be resolved.

Xia ruofei knew very well that old man Liu’s condition was not due to illness. They must have paid a huge price for Liu haojun’s matter.

When old master Liu saw Xia ruofei, he forced a smile and greeted him.””Mr. Xia is here! You’ve worked hard ...”

Xia ruofei nodded with a smile and walked over to old master Liu.

“Elder Liu, you don’t look well. Did you not rest well these past two days? Or did you not take your medicine on time?” Xia ruofei furrowed his brows and said,”by right, after using the pills I provided, your condition shouldn’t be like this.”

Old man Liu revealed a bitter smile and waved his hand.””It has nothing to do with Mr. Xia’s medical skills. It’s me who has some things to do ... Sigh! I don’t need to say it! Mr. Xia, since you’re here, I’ll have to trouble you to examine me ...”

Xia ruofei didn’t say anything. He nodded and walked to the bed. He reached out and placed his hand on elder Liu’s pulse. He closed his eyes slightly and released his spiritual power to sense the situation in elder Liu’s body.

In fact, every time Xia ruofei came for a follow – up, the only thing he needed to pay attention to was whether elder Liu’s recovery speed was too fast.

After all, he had given the Liu family all the pills for a course of treatment at once. Although the possibility of the Liu family disobeying the doctor’s order and increasing the dosage was extremely low, it could not be ruled out.

If old man Liu increased the dosage of the medicine, his recovery speed would be faster than normal.

Of course, even if this situation happened, Xia ruofei could also deal with the fact that Wanwan was providing the Liu family with one pill a day. If old man Liu took more, it would mean that he would have no medicine for a period of time.

Xia ruofei would wait until the pills he provided were all consumed at the rate of one pill a day before he continued to provide more.

If the Liu family had told him the truth, Xia ruofei could have used the excuse of them not following the doctor’s advice and left without further treatment.

If the Liu family could come up with some excuse, such as accidentally destroying the pill, Xia ruofei could expose them by examining elder Liu’s body. He could also say righteously that elder Liu had overdosed on the medicine because he did not follow the doctor’s advice. The medicine had accumulated in his body and he was powerless to save him.

Even if he were to continue treating elder Liu, Xia ruofei could still delay his recovery.

In short, everything would be under his control.

After the examination, Xia ruofei found that elder Liu’s recovery was in line with his plan. It was clear that the Liu family did not dare to make any changes to the medicine that elder Liu had taken.

Xia ruofei opened his eyes and said,””You’re recovering well, but your mental state is very bad. Such a state is not good for the absorption of the medicinal properties. Right now, treatment should be your first priority. Don’t let anything else interfere with your recovery. ”

Old man Liu glanced at Liu Qunfeng, then said to Xia ruofei,””Thank you for your advice, Mr. Xia. I’ll be careful ...”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,””The pills from last time should be enough for you to take for a while,” Wang Yao said.”I won’t provide them to you this time. After all, keeping them for too long will cause the medicinal effect to be lost.”

“Okay, I’ll follow Mr. Xia’s arrangements.” Old man Liu smiled and nodded.

At this time, Liu Qunfeng said,””Mr. Xia, could you please perform acupuncture on my father ...”

“No need!” Before Xia ruofei could speak, elder Liu interrupted Liu Qunfeng,”Qunfeng, how many times have I told you? Mr. Xia should know how to treat him, so we laymen shouldn’t affect the professionals!”

Xia ruofei looked back at Liu Qunfeng with a meaningful look, then smiled and said,””Elder Liu’s current condition is indeed not suitable for acupuncture. Your mental state is too poor.”

“Mr. Xia, don’t care what Liu Qunfeng says. You can decide how to treat him!” Old master Liu looked at Liu Qunfeng sternly and then said to Xia ruofei in a friendly manner.

“Alright,” he said. Xia ruofei nodded and said,”elder Liu, if there’s nothing else, I’ll take my leave.” You should rest well. ”

“Thank you! Thank you!” Old man Liu said with a smile, then he shouted,”Liu Kuan! Help me send Mr. Xia off!”
