Chapter 3384: The test (2)

He glanced at the mission Notice board in the perceptual mirror and found that the progress of the second round of the mission was still 10/10. It did not change to 11/10 because he had received another star Fern thorn soul essence.

Xia ruofei didn’t care about that. He had completed his mission anyway.

He casually put the star Fern thorn soul essence that he had obtained by chance into his pocket, then continued to ride on his sword with Ling Qingxue. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

In the next twenty minutes, Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue rode on the flying sword of the bent frost and avoided another ten star Fern thorns. They finally arrived at the spot of light indicated on the perceptual mirror map. Of course, he did not encounter any more special star Fern thorns after that.

When Xia ruofei arrived at the spot of light, he stopped his flying sword. He pulled Ling Qingxue’s hand and jumped down from the qushuang flying sword that was two meters above the ground.

In this vast wasteland, the scenery was almost the same. Although they had flown for about an hour on their flying swords, this place was almost the same as the places they had been to before. The first thing they saw was a barren land, and a few star Fern thorns were scattered about a dozen meters away, making the wasteland even more desolate.

Xia ruofei held Ling Qingxue’s hand and walked a few meters before stopping.

The position he was currently standing at was exactly the position of the light spot indicated on the map, without any deviation.

Xia ruofei was a little suspicious. This place looked ordinary. What kind of mission was it that led him all the way here? Why did it have to be released in this place?

Xia ruofei’s doubts were answered very quickly.

A few seconds after he and Ling Qingxue stood at the spot of light marked on the map, Xia ruofei heard the familiar clicking sound of a spring.

He quickly followed the sound and turned around, just in time to see stone pillars rising from the ground.

This scene was very similar to the scene he had seen when he had completed the first round of the mission and received the reward of the mission from the previous level.

The difference was that there were more stone pillars rising this time, and they were distributed in a particularly wide area.

In front of the two of them, within a radius of about two kilometers, there were at least one to two thousand stone pillars slowly rising.

Besides, these stone pillars were different from the previous ones. They were carved with different numbers of patterns. These patterns looked very mysterious. Xia ruofei took a few looks and suddenly felt that they were unfathomable.

These stone pillars also had a number of grooves. Judging from their size, they should be just enough to hold a star Fern thorn soul essence.

Some of the stone pillars had five or six grooves on them, and some had at least one groove.

The positions of these grooves were also different. Some were high and some were low. Some were on the side of the stone pillar, and some were directly on the top of the stone pillar.

The sound of the spring gradually weakened and finally disappeared completely.

The stone pillars finally stopped rising.

In front of Xia ruofei were 1000 to 2000 stone pillars of different sizes and heights within a two – kilometer radius. They were like silent statues, faintly exuding an ancient and desolate aura. The scene was quite spectacular.

“What is this?” Ling Qingxue was also shocked by the scene in front of her and muttered to herself.

At this moment, Xia ruofei saw the latest mission description through the perceptual mirror:

[The third round of the chain mission on the trial tower’s fifth floor has officially begun. Please embed the star Fern thorn soul essence in a position that you think is suitable. If the score is good, you will pass. If the score is excellent or perfect, you will receive more generous rewards.] The time limit for the task was 10 hours. If the score was not good or above, the task would be considered a failure.

After Xia ruofei finished reading the mission description, he turned to Ling Qingxue and smiled.””If I’m not wrong, these stone pillars should form a rather powerful formation. However, this formation is currently incomplete and is missing a few key nodes. And the star Fern soul essence in my hand will form these key nodes!”

Xia ruofei then repeated the contents of the mission to Ling Qingxue and continued,””It seems like this mission isn’t easy! We still have 10 hours, 1 need to study it!”

“En!” Ling Qingxue nodded guiltily and said,”I don’t know anything about arrays, so 1 can only rely on you …”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”why are you being so polite with me?” Alright, I won’t waste any more time. I need to study this stone pillar formation first.”

With that, Xia ruofei stepped on the qushuang flying sword and circled the entire stone pillar array at a slower speed.

Although his spiritual power could easily cover such a large area, Xia ruofei still felt that seeing was believing. He rode his flying sword and flew around slowly. He had basically figured out the distribution of all the stone pillars. As for the patterns and details of each stone pillar, he definitely could not remember them in a short time so he did not try to remember them.

Xia ruofei circled around and returned to his original spot. He took out the time array flag from the spirit map space and quickly set up a time array. Then, he beckoned to Ling Qingxue and stepped into the array.

However, before he could analyze the stone pillar array, Xia ruofei felt that something was wrong. He sensed it carefully and immediately found the problem.

It turned out that the flow of time inside and outside the formation was still the same.

In other words, the array set up by the time array flag had no effect at all!

Xia ruofei was stunned. Did he make a mistake while setting up the array?

He quickly checked and found that there were no mistakes at all. The position of each array flag was accurate, and the error was definitely in the millimeter range. In fact, Xia ruofei had used the array flags to set up the time array countless times. It could be said that he could set it up with his eyes closed and he had never made a mistake.

Since there was no mistake in the formation, the time formation flag’s failure wasn’t because of him but because of the environment.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but smile bitterly. He had wanted to take advantage of the situation, but it seemed that the loophole was gone.

Xia ruofei did not know that in a hidden space filled with purple spiritual Qi, a white – haired old man in a green Taoist robe was in the towering Hall. He was looking at his confused face in the mirror.

The White – haired old man in the blue Daoist robe laughed and said to himself,””Little doll! It’s fine if you used a bit of a trick before, since getting this set of array flags is already a part of your strength. However, this stage tests your array Dao level, and it’s too unfair that you have dozens of times more time than others …”

Ling Qingxue saw that Xia ruofei had just entered the formation and immediately walked out. She could not help but be a little surprised. After a moment of shock, she asked,””RUO Fei, what’s wrong? Is there a problem?”

Xia ruofei laughed bitterly.”! wanted to save some time. 1 didn’t expect this obvious bug to have been fixed. The time formation doesn’t work here at all!”

“It can’t be?” Ling Qingxue was also a little surprised.”! used it well before!” He’s also on the 5th level of the trial Pagoda!”

“This trial tests one’s understanding of formations, and it also has a very strict time requirement. It’s indeed a bit too much to rely on a time formation to increase one’s time by several dozen times for no reason.” Xia ruofei smiled bitterly.”Forget it! If it can’t be used, then so be it! Let’s win fair and square!”

“Mm! 1 believe in you. If others can complete the mission in such a short time, you can do it too!” Ling Qingxue said.

Xia ruofei nodded.”!’!! just go inside the stone pillar array and study this array. 1 don’t believe that 1 can’t figure it out!”

With that, Xia ruofei flew into the stone pillar array on his sword. Then, he used his spiritual power to observe and record the shape, position, and direction of the array patterns on each stone pillar..
