Chapter 453: Recruiting soldiers and buying horses Part 1

Strictly speaking, today was the first day that Xia ruofei had moved into the new office. Although Jian Jia could foresee that the new office would be less used.

A unique and exciting private celebration added a lot of joy to this meaningful first day of relocation.

……

“Bad guy ...” Ling Qingxue pouted and said,”you’re so bad! This is the office!” What if someone barged in?”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Wife, don’t you know whose territory this is? who would dare to enter this office without my permission?”

“Only you can!” Ling Qingxue rolled her eyes.

Xia ruofei got up from the bed and walked towards the door of the lounge.””Lie down and rest for a while, I’ll get you a glass of water ...” He said.

Xia ruofei went to the office outside and filled half a cup with warm water. Then, he took out a small porcelain bottle from the spirit map space that contained the solution of the spirit Heart Flower petals and filled the cup to the brim without hesitation.

After putting the porcelain bottle back into the spirit map space, Xia ruofei walked to the bed with the cup and said,””Come, drink some water!”

“I don’t have any more strength ... Help me up!” Ling Qingxue said coyly.

He smiled slightly. With one hand holding the cup, he reached out his other hand to hold Ling Qingxue’s shoulder. He easily helped her up and then fed her the water.

Ling Qingxue had actually recovered some of her strength. Naturally, it was impossible for her to not be able to lift a cup of water. However, she enjoyed Xia ruofei’s care. At this moment, her heart was filled with happiness. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Ling Qingxue rested for a while more. The spirit Heart Flower petal solution began to take effect, and the feeling of weakness in her body gradually disappeared.

“Ruofei, I should go back.” Ling Qingxue said softly after putting on her clothes.

“Don ‘t! Don’t leave tonight!” Xia ruofei said,”I’ll take you to the beach. Then, we’ll have grilled fish in the villa’s yard tonight!”

Ling Qingxue’s eyes flashed with anticipation, but she hesitated and said,””I’ll pass on staying overnight ... It’s not good. There’s a lot of things to do at the company, so I’ll go back first. I’ll come and see you next time. ”

Xia ruofei knew that Ling Qingxue was easily embarrassed. Ling Xiaotian had also attended the event today and knew that she was at Tao Yuan farm. Under such circumstances, she would definitely not spend the night here.

In fact, Xia ruofei felt that Ling Xiaotian would not care about these things at all. In fact, Ling Xiaotian would be even happier if he knew that he had such a close relationship with Ling Qingxue.

However, Xia ruofei still respected Ling Qingxue’s wishes. He did not try to persuade her any further. He quickly put on his clothes, picked up the calligraphy piece on the desk, and sent Ling Qingxue out.

In front of the mixed – use complex, Xia ruofei watched as Ling Qingxue’s car left, then returned to the building.

Xia ruofei did not forget to open the windows after he was done cleaning the office. Even without the smell of hormones, a newly renovated office like this would need a long time to be well – ventilated.

He strolled out of the complex, planning to take a walk around the farm and then go back to make dinner. Since Ling Qingxue didn’t stay, the plan to grill the fish was naturally canceled. He would eat alone, making two side dishes and a bowl of noodles.

Xia ruofei first went to the Mercedes – Benz S – Class sedan that was parked quietly in the small square in front of the building.

The car was a gift from old master Tang’s shengbang group. Xia ruofei had already asked one of the four veterans, Xu Wei, to hand over the transfer procedures to shengbang group. He was going to put the car under the company’s name.

The brand new Mercedes – Benz looked extraordinary under the setting sun. Xia ruofei circled the car. Although he did not like this kind of business – like car, he had to admit that German cars were indeed beautiful.

“Boss!”

Xia ruofei heard the voice behind him and turned around.

He saw Cao tieshu standing somewhat cautiously behind him. His trousers were rolled up, and his feet were stained with some mud. He had obviously come from the vegetable greenhouse.

“Old Cao!” Xia ruofei revealed a friendly smile and asked,”what’s wrong? Did something happen at the greenhouse?”

“No, no...” Cao tieshu hurriedly said,”boss, I have something to discuss with you.”

“Oh? What’s the matter?”

Boss, when we cut the ribbon this morning, I heard you say that our farm is looking for workers?” Cao tieshu asked.

Xia ruofei immediately understood. He smiled and said,””Yup! Old Cao, do you have any relatives or friends that you want to recommend? I can consider it first. ”

Cao tieshu had been helping him manage the vegetable greenhouse in good order for the past few months. He was also very loyal to the farm. As long as the person he recommended had the basic quality and good character, Xia ruofei was willing to give him face.

They were going to recruit people anyway, so who didn’t they recruit?

“Then ... Do you need anyone to go to the staff cafeteria?” Cao tieshu asked,”I ... I want my wife to come and try.”

“Sister – in – Law is also a chef?” Xia ruofei asked in surprise.

“I can’t be called a chef!” Cao tieshu waved his hand and said. However, she used to work in the town middle school’s cafeteria, so her cooking skills are not bad. Whenever there’s a red and white wedding in the village, everyone will invite her to cook. ”

Then, Cao tieshu nervously asked,””Boss, my wife doesn’t have a chef’s certificate. I wonder if she meets the requirements for the job?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”no problem!” We’re the staff cafeteria, not a big hotel. Why do we need a chef’s certificate?”
