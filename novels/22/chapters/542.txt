Chapter 543: Fame that shakes the three mountains (3)

Then, he revealed a nostalgic expression and said,””I wonder if it still tastes the same ...”

At this moment, a strong smell of wine came over, and the people in the room sniffed in unison.

Old Li’s son could not help but call out,”dad!” Why is the wine you bought today so fragrant?”

“Woof! That’s really ...”Old Li was also very surprised. He quickly said,” quick, quick, quick, Guo Guo, pour some wine for your uncle Xinqiang! New and strong! I just found out today that the eight Drunken Immortals have changed their packaging. It seems that they have improved the craftsmanship! This wine is so fragrant ...”

Everyone quickly poured the wine, and after clinking glasses, they couldn’t wait to take a sip.

“Good wine! It has a long aftertaste!”

“This wine’s aroma is too strong ...”

“It’s really good wine!”

Old Li and the others couldn’t help but praise him.

The bottle of white wine was quickly finished by the three men, who took turns to drink it. Everyone still felt that they had not had enough.

“Guoguo,” old Li said, a little tipsy,”go buy a box tomorrow and bring it back to your uncle Xinqiang!”

“Alright!” Old Li’s son immediately replied. I feel that this wine is not inferior to Maotai Wuliangye, and it’s not expensive either. It’s very suitable for me to drink at home or to give it to others!”

“Do as you see fit!” Old Li waved his hand and said.

He was a little addicted to the wine. This wine was really good! Although old Li was thrifty, his family was not short of money. His son worked in a foreign company and his monthly salary was 20000 to 30000 Yuan. He could still afford to spend 150 yuan per bottle of wine. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

……

Similar scenes were happening in many places in Sanshan city.

Of course, most of the buyers were old men over the age of 50, so the sales of Drunken Eight Immortals would not skyrocket.

However, things were absolute. Drunken eight immortal was like an awl in a bag, and his sharpness could not be hidden.

On the third day after the newly packaged Drunken Eight Immortals wine was put on the shelves, inspector Wu of the provincial Department of Culture got married. This veteran who enjoyed the treatment of a main hall – Level official chose the Ling Ji restaurant as the hotel for his daughter’s wedding.

In other channels, be it supermarkets, shops, restaurants, or restaurants, the new Drunken Eight Immortals would definitely not be valued. They would often be displayed in inconspicuous locations.

However, it was the exact opposite in Ling Ji restaurant. All consumers would strongly recommend the Drunken Eight Immortals liquor.

This inspector Wu happened to be a San Shan local, which was one of the main reasons why he chose the most authentic San Shan cuisine, Ling Ji restaurant, as the location for his daughter’s wedding banquet.

Inspector Wu also had a good memory of the Drunken Eight Immortals wine, so he couldn’t stand the glib tongue of the hotel manager. In the end, for the wine to be used for the wedding, the new version of Drunken Eight Immortals was decided.

Although inspector Wu had already retired from his position as a leader, he had a wide circle of friends, especially in the officialdom. This banquet had a total of more than 50 tables. Of course, under the current strict rules, inspector Wu indicated on every invitation that he would not accept gifts. This way, no matter how many guests he invited, he would not give anyone a bad impression.

It was a banquet for more than 500 people, and a considerable number of them were leaders with a certain amount of power. These veterans of the “alcohol test” had drunk countless white spirits, red wines, foreign wines, and beers, so they could tell the quality of wine with just a taste.

Not long after the banquet started, the new version of the Drunken Eight Immortals became the most popular drink at the banquet. Almost everyone who had drunk it was full of praise. Some people even privately asked the waiter for the price of the Drunken Eight Immortals. When they found out that a bottle was only sold for 150 yuan, they were even more surprised.

Many people decided on the spot that from now on, the unit reception wine would be changed to Drunken Eight Immortals ‘steamed buns. In comparison, those “XX hard liquor” and “XX classics”, which cost 200 to 300 yuan, were simply too weak. Even if a bottle of Maotai Wuliangye cost 600 to 700 Yuan, or even more than 1000 Yuan, Drunken Eight Immortals would not be inferior.

This was simply a model of low price and good quality!

As a result, while the winery’s sales Manager, Li Jing, was scratching his head in frustration, the new version of the Drunken Eight Immortals wine, which he had been so worried about, had already become famous. It had set off a buying frenzy in the entire Sanshan city ...
