It wasn’t until he obtained the flying sword of the qushuang and learned the laws of sword control in this space that he regained one of the iconic abilities of golden core cultivators, Chi Xi’s sword control ability.

Shen tianfang obviously did not have such an opportunity. Therefore, even though his cultivation was infinitely close to the late – Stage of the Aurous core stage, he still could not ride a flying sword here.

This was also when he saw Xia ruofei actually fly up on his sword. The reason for his shock.

Xia ruofei controlled his flying sword and hovered about ten meters away from Shen tianfang. He looked down at Shen tianfang and asked,””I have one last question! Was it your own idea to attack me so decisively, or was it your sect leader Chen’s idea? Don’t tell me Chen Xuan ordered you to do this?”

Shen tianfang recovered from his shock. He looked a little pale as he stared at Xia ruofei and said,””I’ve already tried to overestimate your ability, but I didn’t expect you to give me such a big surprise ... I won’t hide it from you. Just now, I’ve already deduced the possible reason why I came to the third level of the trial Pagoda. It wasn’t until the moment I saw you that I realized that this matter was related to you. It was also at that moment that I decided to kill you. Sect leader Chen didn’t order this. As for our young sect leader ... He didn’t order this. Moreover, after entering the secret realm, I couldn’t contact him anymore, so naturally, I didn’t conspire with him!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”I’m relieved!” Otherwise, I’ll go on a killing spree once we’re out. To be honest, I’m quite close to brother Chen Xuan, and I don’t want to fall out with him!”

Shen tianfang was stunned for a moment before he smiled and said,””Xia ruofei, don’t tell me you think that you can escape from me just because you’ve mastered the technique of sword Kinesis flight in this trial space! If that’s what you really think, then you’re too naive! It’s just a little more effort, the final result will not change!”

With that, Shen tianfang did not hold back anymore. He waved his hands in the air, and the flying sword suddenly drew an arc in the air and stabbed toward Xia ruofei again, at a faster speed than before.

At the same time, Shen tianfang stomped his feet and flew toward Xia ruofei. He struck out his palms across the air and pressed down with the force of Thunder.

Xia ruofei stepped on the qushuang flying sword and dodged nimbly. Shen tianfang’s attacks missed one by one. The distance between the two was still five to six meters.

Shen tianfang said coldly,”Xia ruofei, give up!” It was meaningless for one to only know how to ride a flying sword! In this small space, you don’t even dare to fly high! It would be even more difficult to shake me off. You should know that sword Kinesis flight consumes a lot of vital energy! I don’t believe that your Yuan Qi is inexhaustible!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”You’re right. In terms of vitality storage, it’s hard to find someone who can surpass me in the cultivation world.”

Shen tianfang snorted and said,””What’s the point of being garrulous? I can still say that my cultivation has already broken through to the original infant stage! Was there any meaning to it? Xia ruofei, I’ll tell you one last time. If you obediently hand over all your cultivation resources, especially the secret of your rapid increase in cultivation in a short time, I’ll consider leaving your corpse intact! In fact, if the content you tell me is valuable, I can’t rule out the possibility of sparing your life! However, if you continue to resist, then when I catch you, I’ll definitely let you taste the cruelest punishment and let you slowly die in the most bitter pain ... This Chen will do as he says!”

Xia ruofei pouted and said,”isn’t this a trick to trick children?” Do you really think I’m a three – year – old child? You dare to let me leave the secret realm? Aren’t you afraid that when I return, I’ll find master to take revenge for me?”

Shen tianfang’s mouth twitched slightly, and he looked a little embarrassed. However, his expression quickly returned to normal, and he said indifferently,””There are many times when death is an easy thing, but living is very difficult! It’s already a great mercy for me to let you die without any pain!”

Shen tianfang knew that even an ant would not be able to survive. Xia ruofei would not give up so easily, especially after he had mastered the method of sword Kinesis flight.

So, after he finished speaking, he immediately used his spiritual power to control the flying sword and launched an even fiercer attack on Xia ruofei.

However, his spiritual power was not as good as the sword control technique. So, even though his cultivation was much higher than Xia ruofei’s and his swordsmanship was also very exquisite, Xia ruofei could still Dodge it easily. For a moment, Shen tianfang could not do anything to Xia ruofei.

When Shen tianfang saw that Xia ruofei could ride a flying sword in the trial space, he already knew that it was impossible to end the battle quickly.

However, he was still very confident. This was mainly because sword Kinesis flight consumed a lot of vital Qi, especially when it came to high – intensity dodging and evading. With Xia ruofei’s cultivation at the early golden core stage, he should not be able to hold on for long.

Shen tianfang did not know that Xia ruofei had an elemental storage Pearl. In terms of elemental energy storage, Xia ruofei was not inferior to Shen tianfang. In fact, he was far better than him.

If he really had to wait until Xia ruofei ran out of energy, Shen tianfang would probably start to doubt his life.

Of course, Xia ruofei had no intention of using the sword Kinesis flight to escape.

He retreated as he fought, slowly moving towards the direction of the trap and kill array.

Shen tianfang did not notice the formation that Xia ruofei had set up in advance. It was meant to deal with the intelligent Shen beast. Xia ruofei had even camouflaged the formation. Before the formation was activated, it was difficult for ordinary people to notice anything unusual in this area.

Furthermore, Xia ruofei did not set up this formation in front of Shen tianfang. He had not had time to collect it after killing a Shen beast.

Naturally, Shen tianfang was even more defenseless.

Xia ruofei stepped on the qushuang flying sword and used the terrain to Dodge the attacks. He had been dodging and running all this time and had not taken the initiative to attack.

This was also in line with Shen tianfang’s judgment. In his opinion, the difference in strength between Xia ruofei and him was too big, and it was impossible for Xia ruofei to attack him.

It was also because of this that Shen tianfang only wanted to exhaust Xia ruofei’s vital Qi as soon as possible so that he could kill him. He did not have much preparation at all.

If he was on guard, he would at most be on guard against Xia ruofei’s life – and – Death struggle. After all, if the legends were true and Xia ruofei really had a master in the original infant stage, he might have left some life – saving means for Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei retreated as he fought and soon entered the range of the trap and kill array. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Shen tianfang also chased after him without hesitation.

Xia ruofei maneuvered the qushuang flying sword nimbly and increased the speed. The distance between him and Shen tianfang was suddenly more than ten meters.

Shen tianfang was not shocked. Instead, he was happy because Xia ruofei’s actions would not help him escape at all. Instead, it would consume more primordial Qi, and it would only make the final moment come faster.

Therefore, he wasn’t in a hurry and just stayed far away.

Little did he know that after Xia ruofei turned a few times, he suddenly struck out a seal that he had prepared earlier. The trap and kill array was instantly activated.

Shen tianfang could still see Xia ruofei’s figure, but in the next second, he was suddenly shrouded in thick fog. His visibility dropped to the point where he could barely see his fingers.

Shen tianfang was experienced in actual combat. How could he not know that he had fallen into Xia ruofei’s trap?

He knew that this was bad. Then, he gritted his teeth and pushed his speed to the limit. However, he did not retreat blindly. Instead, he pounced at Xia ruofei’s position according to his memory.

However, after the formation was activated, the entire area covered by the formation was in a mess. Shen tianfang thought that he was going to Xia ruofei’s position, but in fact, he was in the opposite direction and had fallen into the depths of the formation.

Xia ruofei’s spiritual power had been paying attention to the situation inside the array. When he saw that Shen tianfang was deeply trapped in the trap and kill array, he could not help but sigh. They had finally come to this ...
