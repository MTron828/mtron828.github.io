2458 The peach blossom gathering (1)

In addition to Zhao Yongjun and song Rui, Liu Jian, Xu Zixuan, Hou Liang, and Wei Jun were all present. They were all wearing well – ironed suits and their hair was neatly combed.

“We look like bridegroom today!” Xia ruofei laughed.

Because of the opening ceremony, Zhao Yongjun and the others, who were the hosts, all had a corsage on their chests, making them look like bridegroom – to – Groom.

On the other hand, Xia ruofei was also dressed in a suit, but his suit was more casual. At least, his hair was not greasy, and he did not wear flowers on his chest. Relatively speaking, his outfit was not as eye – catching.

On the other hand, Song Wei and Ling Qingxue had specially dressed up today. The two of them were wearing dresses of the same color. They stood on either side of Xia ruofei, looking like a pair of pure and beautiful sisters.

“You’re a major shareholder,”Zhao Yongjun laughed,”you’ll have to put on a brooch too! By the way, President Ling can’t avoid it either, we all have to go on stage!”

Xia ruofei quickly waved his hand.”I’m fine. You guys can handle it. I’m just here to freeload some food and drinks!”

“You’re getting more and more shameless!”Song Rui couldn’t help but curse with a smile.

Xia ruofei shrugged innocently and said, “It’s not easy to survive in any industry if you’re not thick – skinned these days ...”

Ling Qingxue and Song Wei could not help but laugh when they saw Xia ruofei bickering with song Rui and the others.

They could tell that Xia ruofei was very relaxed when he was with Zhao Yongjun, song Rui, and the others.

Only when they were truly close friends could they be so casual and not have to worry about offending others.

“Let’s go, ruofei!”Zhao Yongjun said. I’ll accompany you around the club!”

“Don’t you have to receive guests?”Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

Zhao Yongjun was stunned for a moment, then he couldn’t help but laugh,””You little brat, a dog’s mouth really can’t spit out ivory! No wonder Xiao Rui dispels you every time we meet!”

“Brother Xia’s tongue is getting more and more poisonous!” Xu Zi Xuan also said with a smile.

“Xiao Rui and the others are all here, it’s fine if I leave for a while,” Zhao Yongjun said with a bitter smile. You’re a major shareholder, so it’s our responsibility to keep you company!”

Xia ruofei laughed,”brother Zhao, I’m just joking!” Let’s go! Take me to see our club!”

Just then, a Polo drove into the club.

This car was very unremarkable among the many luxury cars, even a little shabby. However, the security guard at the entrance of the club obviously recognized this car. He did not stop it for questioning, but directly waved his hand to let it through.

When song Rui saw the car, he was obviously happy and took two steps forward.

The Polo stopped. Xia ruofei looked at the person who got out of the car. It was Zhuo Yiyi. No wonder song Rui was so attentive. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

However, Zhuo Yiyi ignored song Rui. Instead, she walked quickly towards Xia ruofei and the others.

“Wei Wei! You’re here too!” Zhuo Yiyi cried out in surprise.

“Yiyi!” Song Wei was also very happy to see her old classmate.

The two women hugged each other passionately the moment they saw each other. They then held hands and chatted non – stop. Song Wei even introduced Ling Qingxue to Zhuo Yiyi. The three women were on the same stage, so their conversation became even more lively.

She didn’t know why they had so many topics to talk about.

Song Rui, who had followed Zhuo Yiyi over, had a bitter expression on his face. Xia ruofei, who was holding back his laughter, leaned over to Zhao Yongjun’s ear and whispered,””Brother Zhao, it seems like Xiao Rui’s status in the family will be worrying in the future!”

Zhao Yongjun laughed and said,”being henpecked is actually a good quality ...”

It was only when song Rui walked to Zhuo Yiyi’s side that she seemed to have just noticed his presence.

Zhuo Yiyi felt a little strange and said,”song xiaorui!” What are you still doing here? Hurry up and Help Me Park the car! Can’t you see that I’m reuniting with Wei Wei after a long time? How can you be so blind?”

Song Rui looked like he had nothing to live for and said,””Oh! I know!”

Song Rui carried out his girlfriend’s orders with determination. Although he looked bitter, he still ran to the Polo car parked at the entrance.

“Yiyi!” Song Wei said with a smile. That’s good! He actually taught my uncle song Rui to be so well – behaved! You’re really good at this!”

Song Qiming and elder song were from the same village. They were relatives for several generations. Song Qiming and song Rui were of the same generation. Therefore, Song Wei should call song Rui uncle. However, they were of the same age, so she would not call him that under normal circumstances.

Zhuo Yiyi said casually,”I didn’t teach him anything. He did it willingly!” Besides, I’m quite good to him. I even applied for a fitness card for him some time ago! That guy just eats and drinks all day and doesn’t exercise. He’s so young and already has a small stomach ...”

Ling Qingxue smiled and said,”Yiyi, you’re really good at this!”

However, Song Wei caught the main point and said,”Yo! You even know uncle song Rui’s stomach so well! It seems that you guys are developing very quickly!”

No matter how insensitive Zhuo Yiyi was, she couldn’t help but feel her face heat up. She said in a low voice,””Wei Wei, why are your thoughts so dirty! I saw it when I was swimming with him! What are you thinking?”

“What else could I be thinking?” Song Wei replied with a smile. I just wanted to say that you guys went swimming and working out together. It’s obvious that your relationship is developing very quickly! Where do you think I was thinking?”
