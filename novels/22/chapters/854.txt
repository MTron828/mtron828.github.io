There was a 32 – inch LCD TV in front of the electric massage chair. Nan Nan immediately nodded her head obediently in agreement.

Hence, Xia ruofei turned on the satellite TV and found a channel to broadcast “Balabala the fairies”. Nan Nan happily leaned against the soft and comfortable massage chair in the first – Class cabin and watched the cartoon.

Only then did Xia ruofei return to the back row and sit down. He started to chat with Lin Yue ‘e and uncle Luo.

After driving for about two hours, Xia ruofei saw that Lin Yue ‘e and the rest had gotten used to the environment. He picked up the phone in the car and said to Lei Hu,””Hu, stop the car at the service area up ahead!”

“Alright, brother Xia!”

The car drove for another ten minutes before turning into a highway service area and stopping.

Xia ruofei asked everyone to get out of the car and move around while Lin Yue ‘e brought Nan Nan to the washroom. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

When they got into the car and set off, Xia ruofei did not return to the back. Instead, he sat in the driver’s seat. Lei Hu was arranged to sit in the front passenger’s seat. When they were in the taxi, Lei Hu had been driving the entire time. Xia ruofei definitely could not do this on the return trip. Otherwise, it would be too unkind.

Even though Lei Hu was his employee and it was nothing for Lei Hu to drive for nine hours with his physical abilities, Xia ruofei still treated these veterans as his own brothers. Naturally, he could not order them around like servants.

Lei Hu kept saying that he could do it and asked Xia ruofei to rest at the back. However, Xia ruofei glared at him and said,”obey your orders.” Lei Hu shrunk his neck and smiled awkwardly as he sat in the front passenger seat.

Considering that Lei Hu had already driven a long way today, Xia ruofei did not change the driver’s seat after he got into it. He continued driving for more than three hours and finally entered Sanshan city at about six in the evening.

At this time, the evening lights were on in the three mountains. Xia ruofei picked up the phone in the car while driving, smiling and asking Nan Nan to enjoy the night view.

At this time, the car happened to pass by the bridge on the third ring Road. The lights of the city in the distance, the little fishing fires on the river, and the brightly lit boats upstream formed a beautiful night scene.

Xia ruofei could hear Nan Nan’s cheers over the phone.

He smiled and put the phone back. He did not enter the city, but drove directly from the third ring Road to the farm.

After more than 20 minutes, the Mercedes – Benz spint nanny car drove into Taoyuan farm.

Xia ruofei parked the car in front of the complex.

After Lin Yue ‘e and her family alighted from the car, they looked around. Lin Yue’ e said,””Ruofei, this is your farm! I took a look at it when I came in just now, and it seems to be quite big!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”sister – in – Law, I’ll bring you around tomorrow!” Let’s eat first!”

Xia ruofei had already informed the canteen to reserve some food on the way. When they entered the canteen, Cao tieshu’s wife immediately brought out the food from the thermal lunch box.

Xia ruofei had specially instructed the greenhouse to send over some Taoyuan vegetables. Lin Yue ‘e and the rest naturally enjoyed the meal. When they heard that the vegetables were produced on the farm, they couldn’t help but give a thumbs up.

Even Nan Nan, who usually had a small appetite, ate an extra small bowl of rice. Lin Yue ‘e was so happy that her eyes were squinted from smiling.

After the meal, Xia ruofei reminded Lei Hu to return the car the next day. Then, he brought Lin Yue ‘e and her family to the apartment that had been prepared for them.

The apartment had two bedrooms and one living room. All the furniture and appliances were ready. Xia ruofei had asked pang Hao to buy new bedding and some kitchen utensils. The apartment had a small kitchen, which was more than enough for a family.

Xia ruofei put down his luggage and smiled.””Nan Nan, this will be your new home in the future. Do you like it?”

The apartment was newly renovated and no one had lived in it before. Although the area was not very big, it was very heartwarming. Compared to the old house in Luo Jiashan, this apartment was much better.

Hence, Nannan said happily,”I like it! Uncle Xia, can I live in an apartment too?”

“Of course, this will be Nan Nan’s home in the future!” Xia ruofei squatted down and said to Nan Nan with a smile.

Lin Yue ‘e quickly said,”ruofei, this is the company’s property, right?” I don’t think it’s a good idea for me to take such a big set, right? How about this, we’ll stay here for a few days. I’ll get familiar with my job first, then I’ll rent a house nearby ...”

“Sister – in – Law, this place is surrounded by villages. Where can we rent a house?” Xia ruofei said,”besides, this is a staff apartment!”

“Every employee can live in such a house?” Lin Yue ‘e asked in disbelief.

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Single employees have their own dormitory. Sister – in – Law, your family is here. According to the company’s rules, you can apply for an apartment. This is not special! You’ll get your rent deducted when you get paid. ”

“Is that so ...” Lin Yue ‘e said,”how much should I deduct from the rent?”

Xia ruofei smiled.”The apartment and the dormitory are part of the staff’s welfare. The rent is just a symbolic charge. A two – bedroom apartment like this should cost around 200 yuan!”

Lin Yue ‘e couldn’t help but exclaim,’ so little? Wasn’t this the same as living for free? No, no, no... ”

“Sister – in – Law, you’re not the only one who’s like this. Everyone in the company is treated equally.” Xia ruofei said,”when the company built the house, it was to solve the staff’s accommodation problem, not to earn rent. If you don’t believe me, you can ask the other employees tomorrow. I’m not lying to you. ”
