In terms of administrative division, the location of the Wuyi Mountain East Station was not under the jurisdiction of the Wuyi Mountain range. There was still a distance of 50 to 60 kilometers from the Wuyi Mountain range to the Wuyi Mountain Scenic Area. It was only because of the reputation of the Wuyi Mountain range that it had this station name with Chinese characteristics. In fact, there was also a Mount Wuyi North Station, which was only three kilometers away from the scenic Area. However, Mount Wuyi was the largest high – speed rail hub station in Northern Min, so there were many train choices. That was why director Lu had chosen this station when he booked the ticket. The group left the station smoothly. As elder song had specifically ordered them not to alert the local government, no one knew that a former core leader of China had come to this small county – Level city. Elder song and the other four left the station through the exit gate with the other passengers. The entire process of leaving the station was naturally the stage where the security pressure was the highest. However, Xu Wu was no longer as nervous as when he left for the North train station of Sanshan city. He felt much more confident working with Xia ruofei. The two of them cooperated very well when they left the station. Although the five of them walked out of the crowd, they were able to put elder song under their protection and made their way to the train station Square without any trouble. There was no splashing of clean water on the street, no paving of dirt; There was no Grand welcome from the leaders of the provinces, cities, and counties; There were no flowers or red carpets. A black Mercedes – Benz business car was parked quietly on the road beside the square. It was the pick – up vehicle arranged by the song family. Not far from the front and back of the Mercedes – Benz, there were also black Mercedes – Benz sedans. These were all vehicles under the name of the song family’s company, Huatian group. The Men in Black beside the two cars were also employees of the Huatian group’s security Department. The vehicles were all bulletproof and had been transferred from the capital to Mount Wuyi in advance. They were also the elites of the security Department of the Huatian group, led by Huang Fang, the head of the security Department of the Huatian group. This head Huang used to be a Regiment officer, and before his retirement, he served as the captain of the Special Forces in the Army Group where elder song had once served. “Old commander!” Huang Fang puffed out his chest and shouted. Although he was wearing a black suit, he still subconsciously saluted. His back was straight as a pine, and he exuded a strong military aura. “Little Huang! “Thank you for your hard work ...” Elder song smiled. His original intention was to keep a low profile as much as possible, but at his position, how could he really keep a low profile? For his trip in plain clothes, the Huatian group had rented a transport plane to transport the bulletproof vehicles to Mount Wuyi. They had also transferred over a dozen elite security personnel from the Capital Group’s headquarters to act as the vanguard. Even the head of the security Department, Huang Fang, had personally come to coordinate the security matters. This in itself could be considered as mobilizing a large number of people. However, in order not to alert the local leaders, elder song had no choice but to accept his family’s arrangement. He knew that if he didn’t agree to this, his children would definitely not agree to this travel plan. “Old commander, please get in the car!” Huang Fang extended his hand and made an inviting gesture. Elder song nodded and took the lead to get into the Mercedes – Benz. Manager Lu and song Rui instinctively sat in the last row. Xu Wu sat in the front passenger’s seat. Xia ruofei was still in the seat with the highest safety responsibility, tidying up the seat next to elder song. The three – Vehicle convoy quickly left the Wuyi Mountain station and headed for Wuyishan City. Along the way, elder song was very excited. He pointed at the scenery outside the window from time to time and told Xia ruofei about the time when he followed the Army to the South. It could be seen that this piece of land must have left many memories for the old man. The car drove for more than an hour before they entered the city. This was a County – Level city famous for its tourism and tea leaves. Its development was much better than other counties in the same area. Highways and railways passed through this place. There was even a small airport. The buildings outside the window looked much better than those in ordinary small counties. The most obvious was that there were many tea shops. It was no exaggeration to say that half of the shops on the street were in the tea business. According to elder song’s request, their accommodation was not arranged at the Wuyi Mountain Resort. Instead, they had booked a hotel in the city. The falong hotel was the only four – Star hotel in the city. Manager Lu went to check in and the group went to the hotel room. Elder song’s room was the only large suite in the flarong hotel. Xu Wu and Xia ruofei’s rooms were on the left and right side of elder song’s room. Manager Lu’s and the others ‘rooms were also on the same floor. Huang Fang and the others had booked them in advance. In elder song’s room. The old man sat in the middle while Xia ruofei and the others sat on the sofa in the living room. Eccentric song said with a kind smile,”Little Xia, you’ve had a hard time along the way. I’m just an old man, and I’ve tormented the people around me!” “Chief, you’re welcome. It’s not hard work,” Xia ruofei said. “It’s a lie if it’s not hard. Your work is tiring!” Eccentric song sighed. Then, elder song said to manager Lu,””Xiao Lu, let’s have lunch at the hotel and try out the local delicacies. In the afternoon, you guys will accompany me to a place.” “Yes, chief!” Manager Lu replied. Since Huang Fang and the others were already there, manager Lu didn’t have to worry about the food and beverage arrangements. In fact, the ingredients were all air – flown in advance and had all undergone strict inspections. The Huatian group even hired a chef to follow Huang Fang’s team and arrive in advance. In fact, they had only borrowed the kitchen of the flarong hotel. As long as they had the money, it would not be a problem. Of course, since elder song wanted to taste the local food, the hotel’s chef would have to cook it. However, the people from Huang Fang would definitely monitor the entire process to ensure food safety. It was already past 11 O’ clock when they arrived at the hotel, so after manager Lu made the arrangements, the group quickly went to the private room on the second floor of the hotel for dinner. After the meal, manager Lu was going to arrange for elder song to rest, but elder song suggested that they leave immediately, so everyone had to change their plans at the last minute. After a series of busy but calm preparations, elder song and the others got into the car and left the hotel. There was still a Mercedes – Benz at the front and back, and a commercial car in the middle. The seating arrangement was exactly the same as in the morning. The convoy quickly drove out of the city and headed in the direction of the scenic Area. However, their destination was not the world – famous Wuyi Mountain Scenic Area. Elder song only gave the driver a name, Xuanji xiankeng village. Along the way, Xia ruofei was also very curious. Elder song had even canceled his usual lunch break and went straight to this place after eating. What made this old man so eager? The convoy soon arrived at the remote village. Elder song got out of the car to check and then instructed the convoy to drive forward for one or two kilometers. At the end of the road, the car could no longer drive on the road in front of them. Elder song got out of the car and looked at the nearby terrain. A trace of excitement appeared on his face. He greeted everyone and walked forward. The road in the mountain was not easy to walk on. Song Rui quickly went up to support his grandfather. Xia ruofei, Xu Wu, and the rest were on guard as they quickly followed.
