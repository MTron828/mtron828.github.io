Chapter 3784  Green touring immortal abode (2)

  Xia ruofei did not go out the entire morning. He sat in his bedroom and focused on refining the wooden token.

  According to the progress, the refinement was 99.99% complete. He was just a little bit away. If Xia ruofei was still in the Qi refinement realm, the last 0.01% might take more than ten days or even dozens of days to complete. However, he was about to break through to the nascent soul realm and his spiritual power was about to reach the late - Stage of spiritualisation realm. Therefore, the efficiency was naturally not the same as when he was in the Qi refinement realm.

  Xia ruofei had used about three hours. In these three hours, he had changed his usual practice of using a trace of spiritual power to penetrate the wooden token. Instead, he had used all his spiritual power to remove the last bit of resistance.

  Even so, it was almost noon when Xia ruofei finally refined the mansion - guarding wooden token.

  The moment the wooden token was completely refined, Xia ruofei felt that the connection between him and the wooden token had become much clearer. Previously, when he had absorbed the wooden token into his dantian and refined it with his spiritual power every day, he had also established a connection with the wooden token. However, the connection was very weak, almost non - existent.

  And the moment the mansion - guarding wooden token was refined, this invisible connection suddenly became several times stronger.

  At the same time, a series of information entered Xia ruofei's mind.

  Xia ruofei had received a lot of information in the spirit map space and the trial Pagoda in the mystic Luna realm. He was very familiar with this feeling, so he was not flustered at all.

  In reality, the amount of information this time was very little, it might not even reach one ten - thousandth of the information on the 9th floor of the Tower of Trials. In just a breath or two, the transmission of information had ended.
