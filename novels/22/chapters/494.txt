Chapter 495: Chapter 404 – hidden skill and fame (1)

The Hornets were already extremely fierce, and after living in the Spirit map space for a long time, their power had doubled.

Surrounded by more than 200 Hornets, the venom on the Stinger was constantly injected into his body. One could imagine the pain Liang Haiming was in.

The middle – aged man was stunned.

He had not expected such a situation to occur.

Although the green Bull Mountain Resort was located in the mountains, this area had been developed very well. It had a variety of modern living facilities and convenient conditions. No one would have thought that a group of extremely aggressive Hornets would suddenly appear in a luxurious villa.

It was not until Liang Haiming’s shrill scream that the middle – aged man recovered from the shock.

However, he was helpless in this situation. He couldn’t think of a way to save Liang Haiming.

Liang Haiming’s Villa naturally had guards. Hearing the screams in the house, Liang Haiming’s guards rushed in one after another.

Seeing this scene, everyone was dumbfounded.

The middle – aged man quickly shouted,”hurry!” Quickly save young master Liang ...”

The guards came back to their senses. Soon, some of them took off their clothes and waved them in their hands, trying to drive away the bees.

Everyone immediately followed suit, taking off their clothes and patting Liang Haiming’s body. Even the middle – aged man hurriedly did the same.

Liang Haiming’s scream was extremely shrill. Most of the Hornets were concentrated on his head, and now his head, face, and even neck were full of dense Hornets. If someone with trypophobia saw this scene, they would definitely shudder.

Moreover, the venom of these wild Hornets was also extremely toxic. Liang Haiming’s head was swollen as if it was filled with air, and his skin had a sickly watery luster.

Soon, his screams began to weaken.

The guards used their clothes to chase the Hornets away, and it was indeed effective. Some of the Hornets were even swept by the front of the clothes and fell to the ground, being trampled to death by the guards.

However, compared to the total number of more than two hundred Hornets, the number of Hornets killed was too small. Most of them were still attacking Liang Haiming.

Some of the Hornets, after being forced to fly, simply began to attack the guards, and the whole villa was in a mess.

Soon, the guards were more or less injured. The middle – aged man was also stung twice, and his mouth and cheeks quickly swelled up.

The burning pain made the middle – aged man grimace in pain and he kept sucking in cold air.

The middle – aged man couldn’t imagine how much pain Liang Haiming was in now.

In the beginning, Liang Haiming was still rolling on the ground, struggling and screaming, but now he was basically motionless. Many bees seemed to have fixed their target on him, still biting him, but he only twitched occasionally. No matter how many bees attacked him, he did not respond.

“No! “There are too many Hornets ... Young master Liang won’t be able to hold on like this ...” A guard shouted,”we have to think of another way!”

“Hornet’s are generally afraid of fire. It’s fine if you burn it or smoke it!”

“Are you stupid? The hornet’s nest is on young master Liang! How do I burn it?”

Everyone was waving the clothes in their hands as they discussed. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

At that moment, the middle – aged man saw the fire extinguisher in the corner of the door. He had an idea and shouted,””Use the fire extinguisher!”

Immediately, a guard ran over, picked up the fire extinguisher, pulled the lock, and sprayed it on Liang Haiming.

Although the foam from the fire extinguisher didn’t feel good on Liang Haiming, it was better than being burned! Besides, Liang Haiming had already passed out, so he couldn’t feel anything.

The villa was equipped with two foam fire extinguishers, and the two guards sprayed them at Liang Haiming from two directions.

A large amount of white foam was sprayed out of the fire extinguisher.

Soon, Liang Haiming’s body was covered in a layer of white foam. With his swollen face, he looked even more terrifying.

However, the middle – aged man’s idea was still effective.

When the bubbles landed on the Hornets, some of the flying Hornets ‘wings fell to the ground after being hit by the bubbles. Most of the Hornets on Liang Haiming’s body were trapped in the bubbles and lost their lethality.

The two guards then began to spray bubbles at the Hornet that was still flying in the air, and the luxuriously decorated living room of the villa was now a mess.

Xia ruofei saw the entire process through his telescope. He knew that the Hornets could not be recalled and he could not help but feel his heart ache.

However, the Hornet population in the medium multiplied very quickly. There were more than two hundred new Hornet during this period of time. These Hornet were originally wild bees that he had accidentally harvested. Using two hundred Hornet in exchange for Liang Haiming’s life was quite a good deal.

The most important thing was that this method could be said to be undetectable. No matter how suspicious the Liang family was, they would not suspect that it was a man – made assassination, much less suspect Xia ruofei.

Who would’ve thought that someone could actually control a fierce Hornet and attack wherever he pointed?

Xia ruofei had seen the whole process of the Hornet attacking Liang Haiming. He knew very well that Liang Haiming’s chances of survival in that situation were even lower than winning the lottery. He finally smiled.
