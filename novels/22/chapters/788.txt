Chapter 789: Sharpening the knife (2)

Xia ruofei raised his hand. His movement was slow but powerful. He returned a standard military salute to his dearest comrade and brother.

Xia ruofei, who was dressed casually, raised his hand and saluted, but it did not seem out of place at all.

According to the regulations, the recipient should be the first to lower their arms. Hence, the soldiers maintained their salutation posture. Xia ruofei maintained it for a few seconds before lowering his arm.

Without any hesitation, he turned around, opened the door, and sat in the car without even looking back.

He was afraid that if he took another look at the barracks and his group of life – and – Death brothers, he would not be able to hold back his tears.

The cheetah off – Road vehicle started up and slowly drove out of the camp. It was only until the car disappeared at the far gate of the camp that Guo Zhan gave the order,””The ceremony is over!”

Only then did the soldiers of lone wolf put down their arms.

“The first row, stay behind and stand guard for squad leader Luo. The rest of you, turn left and right!” Said Guo Zhan.

The comrades in the first row of the two lines on the left and right silently stepped out and came to stand guard for the monitor old Luo. The rest of the people turned around in unison and gathered in a column.

“Target the tactical training ground, run!” Guo Zhan shouted.

Some of the soldiers had just returned from their missions, and some were still immersed in the grief of losing their squad leader, old Luo. However, training couldn’t be stopped. This was one of lone Wolf’s principles. Even if the sky fell, they still had to train.

Without sweating like rain on the training ground day after day, how could there be a lone wolf on the battlefield that made the enemy tremble in fear?

Besides, class monitor old Luo hadn’t left yet. He was still watching everyone in the mourning hall!

......

Soon, the training ground was filled with the sound of gunfire and soldiers shouting. This familiar voice was the best comfort to the squad leader, old Luo.

……

In the evening, Xia ruofei carried a small bag and walked out of the South Sanshan train station.

Along the way, Xia ruofei’s mentality had slowly adjusted. After the recall, he had become a local citizen again. The past few days of tension, excitement, blood, and smoke were like a dream.

Now that he had woken up from his dream, he had once again changed from an outstanding special Combat Elite to the chairman of paradise Corporation, who had just emerged in the business world.

On the train back to Sanshan, Xia ruofei started to think about the company’s development, especially the work that had to be completed in the near future.

As he walked out of the station, Xia ruofei saw Lei Hu’s figure. The Knight XV SUV was parked beside Lei Hu. Xia ruofei had called Lei Hu yesterday and asked him to go to the Public Security Bureau to get the car. Then, he sent his train number to Lei Hu and asked him to pick him up at the station.

There was a spare key to the Knight XV at home. After Xia ruofei called the police, Lei Hu successfully retrieved the car and drove to the southern train station in the southern suburbs of Sanshan city to pick them up.

“Brother Xia!” Lei Hu waved at Xia ruofei, then quickly came forward to take the bag from Xia ruofei’s hands.

“Hu, you’ve worked hard!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Lei Hu opened the door for Xia ruofei and grinned.””Brother Xia, it’s not hard!”

After Xia ruofei got into the car, Lei Hu immediately closed the door, then quickly sat in the driver’s seat and started the car.

Xia ruofei leaned on the soft and comfortable seat in the back and asked with his eyes closed,””Did anything happen in the company recently?”

Lei Hu drove seriously as he replied, “They’re all pretty good! Yesterday, I heard director Feng and director Xue from the Research Institute talking about some clinical trials. ”

Xia ruofei opened his eyes and sat up straight. “What’s wrong with the clinical trial?”

Lei Hu scratched his head and said,”I don’t know much about the company’s specific Affairs. You’d better go back and ask President Feng about it!” But don’t worry, it shouldn’t be a bad thing. I can see that President Feng and the others are quite excited. ”

“Oh ...” Xia ruofei heaved a sigh of relief.”Alright, I understand.”

Xia ruofei was very concerned about the heart – nourishing soup project. Although the provincial and National Drug Administration were very supportive of it, Xia ruofei was still worried that there might be any problems, especially if there were problems in the clinical trials. It would be troublesome.

However, after hearing Lei Hu’s words, Xia ruofei was relieved. He knew that if something big happened, Feng Jing would definitely call him to report it. Since he had not received any calls until now, it must not be a bad thing.

After all, Lei Hu was only the head of security and did not know much about the company’s Affairs, so Xia ruofei decided not to ask.

“Oh right, Hu Zi, Qiao’ er hasn’t gone out these past few days, has she?” he asked after some thought. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“No, I personally went to pick him up after the class reunion.” Lei Hu replied,”she’s been at home the past few days. She didn’t even leave the farm.”

“En!” Xia ruofei nodded.

Lei Hu laughed and said,”brother Xia, you’re really concerned about this sister of yours.” Even a real brother wouldn’t be able to do this, right?”

Lei Hu was very clear about how much effort Xia ruofei had put in for Lin Qiao’s safety. All of this was done without Lin Qiao’s knowledge. No wonder Lei Hu was so emotional.

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly and said,”it’s precisely because he’s not my biological brother that I have to be so attentive!” Now that Hu is gone, I have to take good care of his only sister!”

Then, Xia ruofei continued,”you saw what happened that day. High school students these days are really bold. If I hadn’t been secretly protecting her, Qiao’ er might have been hurt!”
