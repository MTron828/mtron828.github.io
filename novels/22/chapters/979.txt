Tian Mingyi saw that manager Lu was treating him like an invisible person, so he couldn’t help but sneer. You just have to hold on! He wouldn’t give up until he reached the Yellow River! You won’t even be able to Cry Later!

……

Flying Snow Pavilion.

“Uncle Ling, did those two idiots do something?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

Ling Xiaotian curled his lips and said,”isn’t that so?” Director Tian of the health Bureau was quite a figure, but he didn’t expect his son to be so useless! An official’s position was neither high nor low! He’s calling people to do a joint law – enforcement inspection of our store!” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Ling Xiaotian knew that Xia ruofei had invited the Secretary of the municipal government, song Qiming, to dinner tonight, so he was not at all worried about the two little shrimps ‘actions.

Xia ruofei’s expression turned cold. He snorted and said,”Actually, many leading cadres are good officials! Just like you said, the officials are not high in rank, but their responsibilities are not small! It’s these monsters and demons that have turned the society into a mess!”

Ling Qingxue also said angrily,””What kind of people are these! If he didn’t book a room in advance, we would have to reserve one for him all year round, right? If principal Tian comes today, then if director Liu and director Zhang come tomorrow, will we still be able to open our shop?”

Xia ruofei gently held Ling Qingxue’s hand and said with a smile,””Qingxue, it’s not worth getting angry at these small fries. Today is uncle Ling’s first day of business, and he dares to do this. It looks like we have to teach them a lesson that will leave a deep impression. Otherwise, they’ll really be lawless!”

Ling Xiaotian could not help but feel happy when he heard manager Lu’s report. As soon as Xia ruofei gave the order, Ling Xiaotian did not hesitate to follow Xia ruofei’s instructions. On one hand, it was because he had the confidence. On the other hand, he might have other thoughts.

Song Qiming was coming over tonight, and they were the ones who invited Xia ruofei to a banquet. No matter who came to cause trouble, no matter how big the matter was, the Ling Ji private kitchen would not be the one in trouble.

If song Qiming personally came out to deal with these lawless “little brats,” then it would be hard for Ling Ji private kitchen not to be famous. There were no secrets in the officialdom, and the matter of Tian Mingyi and the others could not be kept a secret. By then, who would dare to come to Ling Ji private kitchen to cause trouble?

What was the difference between that and seeking death?

“Ruofei, with your words, uncle Ling’s heart is at ease!” Ling Xiaotian laughed.

Ling Qingxue hesitated for a moment before saying,”dad, RUO Fei, why don’t we go to the front yard to take a look?” Old Lu might not be able to handle the joint inspection team later. After all, today is our first day of business ...”

“No need!” Xia ruofei and Ling Xiaotian said in unison.

Xia ruofei laughed as he looked at Ling Xiaotian, then said,””It seems like uncle Ling and I share the same opinion! Just let them perform to their heart’s content! This time, we’ll let them put on a good show! Secretary song is new here and doesn’t know much about the local affairs. I’m giving him a good opportunity to understand the governance of the three mountains! He’ll definitely be very grateful to me ...”

With that, Xia ruofei chuckled. His smile looked evil in Ling Qingxue’s eyes, and she could not help but burst into laughter.

……

Just as Xia ruofei, Ling Xiaotian, and Ling Qingxue were talking and laughing, the people gathered by inspector Wu arrived.

The location of the Ling’s private restaurant was not very remote. Guanmiao Street used to be in the center of the three mountains. However, the city had changed in recent years and was not as prosperous as the old people’s house. However, it was not far from the administrative center. Moreover, the people who were gathered by director Wu were mainly people from the relevant departments in the Bell Tower District, so they arrived very quickly.

When a group of people wearing uniforms of urban management, security, and environmental Protection came in from the main entrance, Tian Mingyi and director Wu couldn’t help but show a proud smile.

Then, director Wu’s face darkened and he became the leader of the inspection team.

He walked up to manager Lu and said in a serious tone,””Manager Lu, our health, security, and environmental departments have decided to conduct a surprise inspection of your store. I am Wu Guanghui, the person in charge of this inspection! Please cooperate with our work!”
