2979 A Grand gamble (1)

Everyone quieted down after hearing Xia ruofei’s words.

The five bottles of Chi – amassing pills at the start of the auction had successfully attracted everyone’s attention. Many people were guessing which family had provided the Chi – amassing pills, and they had not expected the star Seizer sect to admit it.

“You have that kind of Qi gathering pill?” Luo Feng couldn’t help asking.

On the main auction stage, Hao Qingsong directly said, “I can vouch for that. The gathering Qi pills at the beginning were indeed provided by the star Seizer sect.”

As the host, the fallen leaves sect had the duty to keep the client’s identity a secret, but since the client had taken the initiative to reveal it, Hao Qingsong naturally didn’t need to hold back. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Moreover, Hao Qingsong was the one who had hoped the most that the star Seizer sect’s handwritten copy would be successfully auctioned off. That way, the fallen leaves sect would also be able to obtain great benefits!

Hao Qingsong’s words could be considered to be completely true.

Luo Feng couldn’t help but gasp. Although they didn’t participate in the competition for the Qi gathering pill, sun Tianfeng had personally appraised it, so it couldn’t be wrong. There were many Qi refining cultivators in the spirit Vulture mountain, including the young sect leader, Wu Ming, who was still in the Qi refining stage. This Qi gathering pill was naturally a good thing.

Thirty pills were equivalent to one and a half bottles. If Wu Ming was the only one to use it, it would last for a long time.

However, Luo Feng wasn’t satisfied with just winning 30 Qi gathering pills.

“Thirty Chi – amassing pills is too little ...” He said, squinting his eyes.”We’ll lose tens of thousands of spirit stones if we withdraw our handwritten copies from the auction!”

“How many do you think is appropriate, elder Luo?” Xia ruofei asked lightly.

Luo Feng smiled and said,”fellow Daoist Xia should be very clear that if we don’t get involved in this matter, you have no way of proving the authenticity of the two cultivation techniques. The fellow Daoists present will also not be able to buy them with ease!” So, all the benefits of this bet are on your side ...”

“What if my handwritten copy is different from the one in the Ling Jue mountain? Wouldn’t we be losing both the wife and the soldiers? ” Xia ruofei smiled faintly and said, ” you don’t have to say these words. Since elder Luo is still speaking with fervor and assurance, naturally, he wants to make this bet. It’s nothing more than a matter of the bet. We’ve already wasted a lot of everyone’s time, why don’t you be more straightforward, elder Luo? ”

“Alright!” Luo Feng said, ” if we win, we don’t want the Qi gathering pill, but the formula that you have! ”

Xia ruofei and Luo Qingfeng looked at each other, then smiled disdainfully and said, ” “Elder Luo has such a big appetite! You want to bet a priceless medicinal formula on the right to auction off a mere remnant volume? ”

“Fellow Daoist Xia can choose not to bet.” Luo Feng seemed to have Xia ruofei in the palm of his hand.

“Why not? ” Xia ruofei laughed and said, ” however, the stakes are not equal. If elder Luo wants to exchange it for the formula, shouldn’t you pay more if you lose? ”

“What else do you want? ” Luo Feng asked.

” In addition to the withdrawal of your’ the glittering jewel Wonderland’ fragment from this auction, you will also have to pay us an additional 50000 spirit stones. ” Xia ruofei said without hesitation, ” this is my final condition. If you have no objections, then we’ll bet! ” If you don’t agree, just say that you didn’t say anything before. If our handwritten copies were to be auctioned normally, I believe that there will be fellow Daoists who know the value of it! I don’t need to prove anything!”

Luo Feng couldn’t help but fall into hesitation.

His instinct told him that Xia ruofei was not bluffing.

However, if one were to judge rationally, the chances of the star Seizer sect also having the’ true glittering jewel Scripture’ were extremely low. In addition to the previous conflict between the two parties ...

If he had only bet that their ” the glittering jewel true understanding ” would leave the auction, he wouldn’t have had too many concerns. After all, if they lost, it would prove that the star picking sect’s ” the glittering jewel true understanding ” was also real. That would mean that the remnant scrolls that they would put up for auction later would likely not be sold, or they would be sold at a low price. So in reality, they wouldn’t have to put in too much for this bet.

However, if he added 50000 spiritual stones, the impact would be a Little Big.

Without the income from the auction of the ” glittering jewel true understanding “, their budget would be stretched thin. If they lost another 50000 spirit stones, there would be a difference of more than 100000 spirit stones. Basically, it meant that they had already withdrawn from the competition for that treasure.

Of course, if they won, not only would the ” glittering jewel truth ” fragment be auctioned for a higher price, but they would also get an extremely precious prescription for free. In the future, the lingjue mountain would be able to make a lot of money even if they sold Chi-amassing pills.

It could be said that the rewards were very attractive, but the risks were also quite high.

While Luo Feng was still weighing the pros and cons, Wu Ming, who was beside him, was already getting anxious.

Wu Ming said in a low voice,” uncle Feng, what are you thinking about? ” Promise him! We can’t lose! He’s just giving us a prescription for free!”

Luo Feng smiled bitterly to himself – if only things were that simple.

However, he still couldn’t resist the temptation of the Qi – gathering Elixir’s prescription. He finally gritted his teeth and said,””Alright! We’ll do as fellow Daoist Xia says! We, the Ling Jue mountain, will bet on this!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”great!” Our star Seizer sect will naturally be more than happy to oblige!”

Following that, Xia ruofei turned to Hao Qingsong, who was on the main auction stage, and said,”Elder Tong, we’ll have to trouble the falling leaves sect to be our witness!”

“No problem!” Hao Qingsong laughed. This is our honor! Furthermore, there are so many fellow Daoists present who have personally witnessed this. I believe that both of you will definitely not go back on your words! We’re all witnesses!”

“Thank you!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Hao Qingsong nodded and said,” since there are no more questions, we’ll now begin auctioning off the star Seizer sect’s hand-written copies of the “true understanding of the glittering jewel,”Volume One and volume Two.” That’s right, there’s one more thing I forgot to introduce to everyone. Because these two hand-written manuscripts started from the beginning and were both complete, not only could Qi condensation cultivators directly cultivate the first volume, even golden core cultivators could cultivate according to the contents of the two volumes. Alright, let’s cut to the chase and start the auction! The starting price of the two copies of the’ glittering jewel Wonderland’ was 30000 spirit stones, and each bid must be increased by at least 500 spirit stones! Fellow Daoists, you can start bidding!”

……

The price on the big screen began to update quickly. Every time it flashed, it meant that someone had raised the price again.

Everyone’s increase in the bid was quite large. Except for a few who increased the bid by 500, most of them increased the bid by 1000 or 2000 spirit stones.

In a short while, the price on the big screen had reached 50000 spirit stones.

This was the item with the highest unit price in the auction.

Moreover, the price was still rising, but the speed of change was beginning to slow down. This meant that some people knew that they had no hope or that they didn’t have enough budget, so they wisely withdrew from the competition. The cultivators who were still competing also had to think twice before bidding because of the price.

Xia ruofei did not expect everyone to be so enthusiastic.

Even Luo Feng and Wu Ming, who were in room 15, were dumbfounded. Yingluo, this was much more popular than their own handwritten manuscripts!

According to their estimation, the’ glittering jewel true understanding’ fragment could be sold for about 50000 spirit stones.

From the looks of it, the star Seizer sect’s handwritten copy had already reached 50000 spirit stones, and the final price was clearly far more than that.

Luo Feng quickly understood that the spirit Vulture mountain was actually “helping” the star Seizer sect. Their bet was basically a guarantee. If the handwritten copy of the star Seizer sect was real, then it would be worth it to buy it for fifty to sixty thousand spirit stones, or even seventy to eighty thousand – And if the star Seizer sect’s handwritten copy was fake, they wouldn’t suffer any losses either. They could even get hundreds of thousands of spirit stones as compensation. No matter how you looked at it, it was not a loss.

Therefore, no one had any worries at all, and the bidding was naturally more refreshing.

Luo Feng was extremely unwilling to accept this, but he quickly changed his mind and thought, Hmph! Now, no matter how many spirit stones were auctioned, it was all in vain! As long as they compared the copies of both parties, their true colors would be revealed. The higher the transaction price, the more losses they would have to pay. By then, the star Seizer sect wouldn’t be able to afford the losses even if they went bankrupt!

...

With this in mind, Luo Feng felt much more at ease.

In room 20, Xia ruofei looked at the rising numbers on the big screen and turned to Luo Qingfeng.””Qingfeng, do you not understand why I suddenly became high – Profile? He even took the initiative to admit to the matter of the Qi gathering pill. ”

“Master, you must have your own plans,” Luo Qingfeng said quickly.”I don’t want to speculate.”

Xia ruofei sighed and said,””From the moment I participated in the competition for that ore, especially after Wu Ming’s words, we were destined to be unable to keep a low profile. I don’t know how many pairs of eyes are staring at us! Since that’s the case, we might as well do the opposite!”

Xia ruofei patted Luo Qingfeng’s shoulder and said,””I’m doing this for the star Seizer sect’s sake. The more high – Profile we are, the less likely those with ill intentions will act rashly. It would be even better if they could be like Shao Qingyang and misunderstand that we have the support of a nascent Soul Stage old monster. Although the star Seizer sect has a profound Foundation and isn’t easily afraid of those other sects, I still hope to reduce the pressure on you as much as possible. ”

Luo Qingfeng was touched and said,””On behalf of the star Seizer sect, I thank master for your concern!”

“We’ll talk about it after the auction!” Xia ruofei said,”as long as my adopted husband’s plane takes off successfully, the two of us won’t have any worries. By then, I will naturally provide the star Seizer sect with even stronger protection!”

“Yes! Master!” Luo Qingfeng said,”I will follow master’s arrangements!”

As the two of them conversed, the price of the two handwritten copies had unknowingly risen to 60000 spirit stones.

There were at least three or four sects that had not given up and continued to raise the price.

Xia ruofei noticed that there were cultivators from the flying flower Valley in Room 6.

...

In box six, Liu Mansha frowned slightly and said,””Although this price is not considered high, the ‘true understanding of linglang’ is worth it! However, if we bid for these two hand – written manuscripts, I’m afraid we won’t be able to compete for that treasure ... Junior Sister yang, let’s give up! The overall situation is more important!”

At this moment, the person controlling the bidding device was actually elder Yang Liu of the flying flower Valley.

After Yang Liu heard Liu Mansha’s words, she turned her head and smiled.””Senior Sister Liu, no matter what price we have to pay, we have to get these two cultivation techniques! If you weren’t limited by your spiritual power, your cultivation would’ve broken through to the late – Stage of the Aurous core stage. These two handwritten copies of the “glittering jewel Wonderland” were simply a heaven – sent opportunity. They were specially prepared for you by the heavens! If you don’t take it from the heavens, you’ll be harmed!”

Willow continued,”as for the big picture ... It shouldn’t affect it!” Didn’t I prepare fifty thousand spirit stones? I’ll use it to subsidize Senior sister’s purchase of the “true understanding of glittering jewels”!”
