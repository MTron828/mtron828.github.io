Xia ruofei had just completed his breakthrough and naturally had a deep impression of that feeling. He nodded in agreement and said,””That hunger was really intense. I couldn’t stand it even after a few hours. It’s hard to imagine that you’ve been suffering for more than a year!”

“Master,” Luo Qingfeng said with a bitter smile,”this old servant’s breakthrough speed is actually quite fast. As far as I know, some cultivators take three to five years to break through to the early – Stage golden core realm! That was the real torture. However, all cultivators, as long as they’re at the Golden core stage and above, will go through this process. It’s rare for someone to complete a breakthrough in a few hours like master!”

“What caused you to drag this process out so long?” Xia ruofei asked.

“Master, this is caused by many factors,” Qingfeng Luo said.”From an external perspective, continuous and rapid cultivation requires a large amount of resources. Many cultivators do not have that many resources at all, so they can only rely on the normal cultivation method of absorbing spirit energy to complete the formation of the vital Qi vortex. As for the cultivators themselves, even if they had enough resources, the process of building a vital Qi vortex was relatively long. Basically, no one could maintain a high – speed cultivation state continuously. They had to stop to adjust and rest. Of course ... If it’s someone like you, master, who completed the construction of the vital Qi vortex in a few hours, then there won’t be such a problem. This old servant feels that it should be because of the difference in cultivation techniques. Master’s cultivation technique must be of a very high grade. ”

Luo Qingfeng’s explanation was simple and easy to understand. Xia ruofei nodded and said,””I understand now. For most cultivators, it’s not that they don’t want to, but that they can’t do it. So, they can only endure the constant hunger and the pressure of the vortex on their body functions.”

Luo Qingfeng smiled wryly and thought to himself,’you just found out ...’

However, he naturally wouldn’t show it. He only nodded respectfully and said,””Yes, Master. This is what most Aurous core stage cultivators experience when they break through.”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”let’s go!” I’m going to say hello to my friend, then we’ll get ready to leave!”

Luo Qingfeng saw Xia ruofei walking towards the door. He opened his mouth, wanting to say something but stopped. Then, he quickly followed.

In fact, Luo Qingfeng wanted to tell Xia ruofei that although early – Stage golden core cultivators could ride a flying sword, they still needed to practice hard to master the technique of riding a flying sword after just breaking through.

After all, sword Kinesis flight was a relatively high – Level use of vital Qi, and it also needed to be used in conjunction with mental power. Whether it was vital Qi cultivation or mental power cultivation, it would have a great impact on the user. Even if the conditions were met, the technique of sword Kinesis flight was not so easy to master. The balance of flying in the air needed even more constant practice to gradually become proficient.

Many cultivators in the early jiedan stage were very careful when they first learned how to ride a flying sword. Their flying posture was also crooked and they looked very embarrassed.

After all, this was the true meaning of humans not relying on mechanical means to fly directly into the sky. Since ancient times, humans had not been able to fly like birds. Human genes had a natural fear of the sky and an instinctive fear of flying off the ground. All of these had to be overcome.

Only after mastering it would the instinctive fear gradually disappear. Then, cultivators in the Golden core stage and higher cultivation could take flying on a sword as a common meal, and it was the most convenient and efficient way of travel.

Luo Qingfeng felt that Xia ruofei had just broken through to the early – Stage golden elixir realm, and he wanted to try sword Kinesis flight over such a long distance. Furthermore, he spent most of his time flying on the sea. One could imagine the difficulty and psychological pressure he would face.

However, when he thought about how Xia ruofei was able to complete the construction of the vital Qi vortex in a few hours, he realized that he could not be judged by common sense. Hence, he hesitated for a while and did not say anything.

Xia ruofei told Ling Qingxue and Song Wei. Then, without waiting for Li Yifu to send him the address, he left the Yanhuang building with Luo Qingfeng.

The two of them headed straight for the core of the formation on the west side of the island. With Xia ruofei leading the way, they were naturally unobstructed. No formation would affect them. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Luo Qingfeng had a deep impression of the cement room at the core of the array. Back then, he had been defeated by Xia ruofei, who had not broken through the bottleneck of the Qi refinement stage, with the help of the array. He had even been taken in as a soul slave by Xia ruofei.

Furthermore, Xia ruofei had used that battle to break through the bottleneck of the Qi refining stage, which laid the foundation for him to break through to the beginning stage of the Golden elixir realm.

Luo Qingfeng could not help but feel a little emotional when he saw the cement room that contained the core of the array again. However, he did not have any resentment towards Xia ruofei. Other than the use of the soul seal, Xia ruofei had treated the soul slaves well. He did not really treat them as chess pieces that could be sacrificed at will and at his beck and call. He even gave them basic dignity, which made him feel deeply grateful.

Xia ruofei pointed at the empty space in front of the cement house and said to Luo Qingfeng,””Qingfeng, this place has the highest concentration of spirit Qi on the entire Island. You continue to meditate and regulate your breath here, and try to recover all of your vitality. Our journey today is still very long, so we should take advantage of the fact that the spirit Qi here is denser than the outside world and absorb as much as possible!”
