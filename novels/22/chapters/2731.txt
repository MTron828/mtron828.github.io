2732 The arrival of the Golden core (1)

At this moment, peach source Island was quiet, and the roar of the car engine was very loud. Xia ruofei stepped on the gas pedal. His entire body was trembling, but at the same time, he was extremely calm. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Obviously, this was the most critical moment since he stepped onto the path of cultivation. It would also be his first time facing a golden core cultivator. However, he had already done his best in his preparations, and his military career had tempered his strong heart. Although he was filled with endless battle intent, he did not lose his mind and did not panic.

Xia ruofei did not drive straight to the small cement room where the core of the formation was placed. He stopped the car about two hundred meters away from the cement room.

It used to be a construction site, and some construction projects had not been completed yet. Before the staff of the Liu family left, the place had been cleaned up in an orderly manner, and several construction vehicles were placed there.

Xia ruofei parked the Land Rover beside the engineering vehicle. After getting off the car, his figure flashed and he flew towards the cement room where the array core was placed.

The distance of two hundred meters was covered in the blink of an eye. After Xia ruofei entered the cement room, he flipped his hand and took out a crystal, skillfully embedding it into the grooves around the array board.

The origin crystals he took out had never been used before. The spiritual Qi inside was extremely dense, and it could guarantee that the array would be activated in a breath’s time.

Xia ruofei used his fastest speed to check the array disc and origin crystals, then left the cement house in a flash. As long as he was within the range of his spiritual power, he could communicate with the array disc and control the array. Naturally, there was no need to guard this place.

In theory, Xia ruofei could control the formation anywhere on the island. However, the closer he was to the core of the formation, the easier it would be to control it. After all, it would consume a lot of spiritual power to cover a large area.

After Xia ruofei left the cement room, he headed straight for the cliff. In the blink of an eye, he was in front of the cliff. He did not stop and flew straight out. He reached out to the protruding part of the cliff and used it as leverage. His body descended lightly.

After descending for more than ten meters, Xia ruofei arrived at a position that he had found in advance. There was a gap in the cliff wall here, and it was blocked by vines. It could not be seen from the outside.

This height was just right. If they were too high and too close to the top of the cliff, the possibility of being discovered would increase. If the height was too low, the cliff wall below would be completely bare due to the erosion of the sea water. There was no cover at all. Even if he could find similar cracks, the hiding effect would not be as good as here.

Xia ruofei grabbed the edge of the gap with one hand. At the same time, he summoned the spirit map scroll from his palm and carefully stuffed it into the gap.

Then, Xia ruofei camouflaged the vines and weeds outside the crack. After a careful inspection, he found that there were no traces left behind. From the outside, there was no clue at all. With a slight thought, he disappeared from the outside world and entered the spirit map space.

Now, Xia ruofei’s aura had completely disappeared from the Paradise Island. Even if Luo Qingfeng used his spiritual power to scan, he would only find Wang Boshan on the island.

After Xia ruofei entered the medium, he first reached the mountain and sea realm. Then, he carefully separated a trace of his mental energy outside and kept an eye on the sea in the West.

Xia ruofei’s spiritual power had already reached the spirit gathering realm, which was equivalent to the cultivation of an early – Stage golden core cultivator. As long as one was not a cultivator who specialized in spiritual power or was particularly sensitive to spiritual power detection, it would be difficult for one to detect such a subtle spiritual power of the same level.

According to Zheng Yongshou’s information, Luo Qingfeng’s spiritual power was not his strong point. Hence, Xia ruofei was at ease and boldly released his spiritual power from the spirit map scroll so that he could fully understand the situation.

When Xia ruofei was done with all the arrangements, Luo Qingfeng and Zheng Yongshou had arrived at the uninhabited beach on the island.

Qingfeng Luo took out his flying sword and flew in the direction Zheng Yongshou had pointed out.

The distance between Evarts Island and Paradise Island wasn’t too far, and the speed of the flying sword was so fast that they could see the outline of Paradise Island in the distance in just ten minutes.

It was the darkest time before dawn, but with Luo Qingfeng’s eyesight, he could still clearly see the Paradise Island a kilometer away.

He himself had been studying the array Dao, and his level was only higher than Zheng Yongshou ‘s, so as soon as he arrived at the nearby sea, he immediately keenly sensed the existence of the natural array.

As Qingfeng Luo continued to approach the Paradise Island on his flying sword, he scanned the area with his spiritual power. Then, the speed of his flying sword began to slow down, and finally, he simply stopped. He stood on the flying sword and held Zheng Yongshou in one hand, floating in the air.

When Zheng Yongshou heard the sound of the wind suddenly stop, he couldn’t help but open his eyes.

When he saw the peach source Island in front of him, he couldn’t help but shout in his heart,”You should go over! Why are you stopping here?

The place where Luo Qingfeng was standing was not within the range of the array. Zheng Yongshou saw Luo Qingfeng stop his flying sword and float above the sea, looking at the Peach Blossom Island not far away without saying a word. He could not help but feel nervous. Did he find out something?

At this moment, Luo Qingfeng smiled faintly and said,””It’s indeed a big move!”

Zheng Yongshou’s heart trembled when he heard that, and he secretly cried out bitterly,”It’s finished! It’s finished! He had really aroused suspicion ...

Zheng Yongshou wasn’t afraid of death. As long as it was a task assigned by his master, Xia ruofei, he would complete it at all costs. Even if Xia ruofei asked him to jump off a cliff, he would not hesitate at all.

Zheng Yongshou was mainly worried that Xia ruofei’s plan would fail. Furthermore, Luo Qingfeng had already raised the alarm before he even reached the island. He must have been not careful enough at some point, which led to him giving himself away.

If that was the case, Zheng Yongshou felt that he would really die without hesitation.

“Yongshou,” Qingfeng Luo said.”Is Paradise Island in front of us?”

Zheng Yongshou braced himself and said,”yes, master!” Is ... Is there a problem?”

The corners of Luo Qingfeng’s mouth curled up slightly as he said,””What question? This is a big problem!”

When Zheng Yongshou heard this, he felt even more disheartened. He thought to himself,”As expected, he found out ... Master, it’s all this subordinate’s fault for being incompetent and messing up the matter ...

At that moment, Luo Qingfeng laughed and scolded,””I see that you’ve been studying formations all day, but you haven’t come up with anything! You can’t even tell that it’s such an obvious natural Taixu xuanqing formation? He didn’t go into details when he went back to report. If I knew it was the Taixu xuanqing formation, I would have come here personally!”

“Ah?” Zheng Yongshou was in a daze and didn’t come back to his senses for a while.

Qingfeng Luo looked at Zheng Yongshou and said with a smile,””Have you been blown silly by the wind? Why was she so out of it? I remember telling you about some high – Level formations, including the Taixu xuanqing formation!”

Only then did Zheng Yongshou come back to his senses. He quickly revealed a look of shame and said,””Master, it’s all disciple’s fault for not being skilled enough, that’s why ...”

Qingfeng Luo waved his hand and said,”the final result is good. That’s good.” It’s just a delay of a few days! This is nothing ...”

If Luo Qingfeng had known that this natural array was the Taixu xuanqing array, he would not have allowed Wang Boshan to use the strategy of a slow plan. He might have directly used the means of cultivators to forcibly take the island from the hands of the Liu family.

It was a good thing that Zheng Yongshou had not been able to completely identify the formation back then. Otherwise, Xia ruofei would not be able to do anything on peach source Island.

“Yes! Master!” Zheng Yongshou said respectfully,”the cliff on the west side of the island is right in front of us. The remains of the spirit crystals were found not far from there. Master, should we go to the island now?”

After Zheng Yongshou confirmed that it was a false alarm, he discovered that his back was already drenched in cold sweat.

The most urgent thing in his heart now was to get Luo Qingfeng to the island. As long as Luo Qingfeng entered the range of the array, his mission would be completed. As for whether he could trap Luo Qingfeng, he was like Wang Boshan, blindly worshiping Xia ruofei.

There’s something that master can’t do? It didn’t exist!

“Don’t worry,” Luo Qingfeng said lightly.”Let’s look around first.” This is the first time I’ve seen the real Taixu xuanqing formation, and the main body of the formation is naturally formed. This is simply too amazing!”

Luo Qingfeng wanted to observe everything. On one hand, it was out of his instinct to be vigilant. On the other hand, he wanted to see the natural Taixu xuanqing formation.

“Yes, master!” Zheng Yongshou quickly said.

Although he was very anxious, he did not dare to rush Luo Qingfeng at this time, in case Luo Qingfeng became suspicious.

Qingfeng Luo and Zheng Yongshou flew a few rounds around the island on their flying swords and finally returned to the sea on the west side of the island.

Qingfeng Luo sighed,’this is really a work of art! No... This was the work of the heavenly Dao! The main body of the entire formation is completely formed naturally. It’s truly too mystical!”

Then, Qingfeng Luo looked at Zheng Yongshou and said,””Yongshou, your judgment is correct. There are indeed a few traces left behind by ancient cultivators on this Island. Judging from these traces, the Taixu xuanqing formation on this Island has been activated over the years! Furthermore, the ancient cultivators “method of activating the array was extremely ingenious, allowing me to deepen my understanding of the array Dao.”

...

“Master, does that mean that the island still has those crystals that contain spiritual energy?” Zheng Yongshou asked with a surprised and happy expression.

“Under normal circumstances, there should be.” Luo Qingfeng said,”however, after so many years, it is unknown how many spirit crystals have been left behind! However, the value of this natural Taixu xuanqing formation alone was much higher than that of spiritual crystals! After some slight modifications, the formation could be activated! As long as the formation is successfully activated, it won’t take long for this place to become a cultivation paradise, and an extremely safe cultivation paradise at that!”
