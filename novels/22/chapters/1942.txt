“Then I’ll wait for the good news!” Xia ruofei smiled and took a sip of the tea.

Zhu zhihang saw this and knew that Xia ruofei was going to send them off.

Today’s purpose had been achieved, and the result was very satisfactory, so Zhu zhihang immediately stood up and said,””President Xia, then we won’t hold you up from your work! I wish your company and our County can reach a happy cooperation! Goodbye!”

Xia ruofei did not ask them to stay for dinner. He stood up and smiled.”Good! County Head Zhu, take care!”

Xia ruofei personally sent Zhu zhihang and the others to the door of the office.

Zhu zhihang thought for a while and said to Shi Qingyuan,”Director Shi, please wait for me at the door!”

Then, he looked at Xia ruofei and said,””President Xia, can I have a word with you?”

Xia ruofei was slightly stunned, but he immediately nodded and said,””Let’s go to my office!”

The two of them walked back to Xia ruofei’s desk. Zhou Yu had already closed the office door.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”please have a seat, County Head Zhu.” If you have anything else to say, feel free to say it. The soundproofing here is very good. ”

Zhu zhihang said,”President Xia, there were too many people just now. I think it’s necessary to explain to you more about the matter of County Head Wu being removed from the project negotiation team. I hope it can eliminate your misunderstanding of our Changping County team.”

Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows and gestured for her to come in.””Please speak, County Head Zhu, I’m all ears!”

Zhu zhihang carefully chose his words and said,””As I said just now, this is a personal matter ... There’s no need to hide this. It’s the personal behavior of the former deputy Secretary, Liu haojun. This comrade’s family background is better, but his personality ... How do I put it? He’s showing off a little. ”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’ve heard of him. He’s the one who’s been appearing on the internet for the past two days, Deputy Secretary Liu.” The third generation of the capital is indeed a little arrogant and despotic ...”

“It seems like you know Liu haojun quite well, Mr. Xia.” Zhu zhihang said,”that’s good. I don’t have to waste too much time. “Actually, Liu haojun wanted to get involved in this project himself. He contacted Secretary Zeng directly through a leader in the province ...”

Zhu zhihang also showed a helpless expression and said,””President Xia! “We really had no choice. Whether it was Secretary Zeng or me, it was very difficult to stick to our principles under such pressure ... Of course, as the direct leader of County Head Wu, I expressed my opposition at the time. Secretary Zeng also tried to mediate, but it was to no avail ...”

In fact, Xia ruofei had already deduced the general course of events, so he was not particularly surprised when he heard Zhu zhihang’s words.

Zhu zhihang said sincerely,”President Xia, I’m not trying to absolve the team from Changping County. I just hope you don’t misunderstand us too deeply.” Because if this project is settled in Changping, we’ll have a long – term cooperation in the future. I don’t want everyone to have any ill feelings. ” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”thank you for your honesty, County Head Zhu!” Liu haojun had already been kicked out of Changping. Let this matter end! I hope we can have a long – term cooperation in the future!”

Zhu zhihang said happily,”definitely!” Definitely! President Xia, I’ll take my leave now!”

“Alright, County Head Zhu, I’ll send you off!” Xia ruofei said.

Xia ruofei sent Zhu zhihang and the others to the door of the office. After watching them go into the elevator, he turned back to the office and took out his mobile phone to make a call to the capital.

……

Beijing, party school.

Wu Liqian, who had just finished class, was walking to the cafeteria with a file bag in her hand when she received a text message notification on her phone.

She took out her phone and swiped it open. It was a notification message that said: Heron Island Airlines has successfully purchased a ticket. Friendly reminder: Please go to the airport one hour before departure to check in to avoid missing the flight. The flight number ...

Wu Liqian was a little confused. She didn’t buy a plane ticket! Why did the airline suddenly send such a message? Could it be that someone else had left the wrong phone number when buying the plane ticket?

Just then, she received a WeChat message from Xia ruofei.

“Sister Qian, I’ve bought you a plane ticket and applied for leave. Don’t miss your flight!”

Wu Liqian was confused, but she quickly replied,”RUO Fei, what’s going on?

Xia ruofei sent a smiling emoji and replied,”You’ll know in a while!

Wu Liqian mumbled to herself,”this kid, what is he up to this time?” You’re still keeping me in suspense ...”

Just as she was about to call Xia ruofei to clarify, her phone rang.

This time, it wasn’t Xia ruofei who called. It was the Secretary of Changping, Zeng jianzhang.

Seeing this, Wu Liqian didn’t have the time to question Xia ruofei anymore. Instead, she picked up the phone.

“Hello, Secretary Zeng!” Wu Liqian said very politely.

Although the leader of Changping didn’t do the right thing last time, Wu Liqian knew that an arm couldn’t win against a thigh, so she didn’t blame Zeng jianzhang and Zhu zhihang.

In fact, Wu Liqian’s work ability was outstanding. When she was working in Changping County, Zeng jianzhang and Zhu zhihang were relatively supportive of her, and there were not many obstacles in her work.

Of course, this also had to do with the fact that Wu Liqian didn’t like to fight and just wanted to do her job well.

“Comrade Liqian, I hope I didn’t disturb your class,” Zeng jianzhang said with a smile.

“Secretary Zeng, class just ended!” Wu Liqian smiled. I’m preparing to go to the dining hall. The Secretary called. Do you have any instructions?”

“I can’t call it an instruction!” Zeng jianzhang laughed and said,”I have good news for you. With the hard work of County Head Zhu and my comrades, there’s finally some progress on the Tao Yuan pharmaceutical factory project! The peach blossom company has agreed to contact and discuss with us. When necessary, they will also send people to our Changping County to investigate!”

“Oh, really? That’s great!” Wu Liqian was happy from the bottom of her heart.”Secretary Zeng, this project is very important for the development of our Changping County. We must seize this opportunity!”

“Yup! That’s why ... I’m calling you for help!” Zeng jianzhang said with a smile.

“Ask for my help?” Wu Liqian was confused.”Secretary Zeng, what do you mean?”

“It’s like this. Our County has set up a Task Force specifically in charge of contacting the peach blossom company!” Zeng jianzhang said,”the organization has initially considered handing over the responsibility of the working group to you. It might conflict with the training time, but I believe you can overcome it! “Of course, you don’t have to be involved in the entire process. You might need to personally follow up on the early stages. As for the follow – up work, you can lead the team through phone calls, emails, and fax when you’re in Beijing training! We only have one goal, and that is to successfully bring the Paradise corporation’s project to Changping County! Comrade Liqian, do you have the confidence to complete the task the organization has given you?”

Wu Liqian thought of the WeChat message that Xia ruofei had sent her and the text message that the ticket was successfully booked. She suddenly understood that Xia ruofei had arranged everything! Her heart was filled with warmth.

Wu Liqian composed herself and said firmly,””Secretary Zeng, I promise to complete the task!”

“Good! This is the attitude I want!” Zeng jianzhang said happily,”comrade Liqian, you should take the time to take a leave and come back. Arrange the early work, and sit down with the peach blossom company as soon as possible to discuss the specific issues!”

“Okay, Secretary Zeng!” Wu Liqian said.

“Let the comrades in the county party Committee know after the schedule is set.” Zeng jianzhang said,”we’ll give you a welcome party!”

“Okay. Goodbye, Secretary Zeng!”

“I’ll see you in Changping!”

After hanging up the phone, Wu Liqian had an urge to cry.

These days, she seemed to have been shrouded in a haze. Now, the dark clouds in the sky had dispersed, and the clear blue sky was restored above her head ...
