Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

This Caucasian girl was wearing a sexy three – point sportswear, and a large area of her skin was exposed, showing a healthy wheat color. She had a head of beautiful golden hair and a pair of bright and pure blue eyes. Compared to the well – defined faces of the Europeans and Americans, her facial contours were a little more Oriental and appeared gentler. The three – point sportswear outlined her perfect body and incredible curves. The tight – fitting sports singlet bound her bulging chest, and it bounced gently as she ran. Her waist, which was completely exposed, was very slender, and the waistline was quite clear. A pair of slender legs ran at a steady frequency, and the muscle lines of her legs changed constantly as she ran, full of the beauty of exercise. Even with Xia ruofei’s Oriental Beauty standards, the foreign girl next door was definitely a beauty. Xia ruofei even thought that she was prettier than the few foreign female stars he knew. This kind of beauty made Xia ruofei lose his focus for a moment. Fortunately, he reacted quickly and returned a friendly smile to the other party.”Hello!” Xia ruofei spoke in English because he could tell that the other party’s Chinese was very awkward. He must have learned it not long ago. English and Japanese were compulsory courses for the lone wolf commando team. Although not everyone could reach a high standard, Xia ruofei had no problem with daily conversations. As for the reason why the special Combat Commando team had to learn these two languages, it was naturally well known. It was related to the special mission they were on. The foreign girl’s face was filled with a warm smile as she said,””Nice to meet you, I’m Monica!” “Hello, Monica! I’m Xia ruofei, Chinese!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”please let me guess. Which country did such a beautiful lady come from?” Monica laughed and said,”sure!” Take a guess ...” “Let me think ...” Xia ruofei said seriously.”Only the humid sea breeze of the Mediterranean Sea, olive oil, wine, and the sun at 40 degrees north latitude can give birth to a beautiful woman like you.” Monica laughed even more after hearing that. Fortunately, the speed of the treadmill was not set to be fast. Otherwise, she would not be able to stabilize her body. “Your mouth is really sweet!” Monica smiled brightly and said,”you’re the most talkative Chinese I’ve ever seen!” “Oh, really? I’ll be honored!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Oh right, I haven’t given you an answer yet! In fact, you have an elegance inherited from the Renaissance period, so you must be Italian, right?” “Correct! What a smart Chinese kid!” Monica gave Xia ruofei a charming smile. Then, Monica looked at Xia ruofei’s legs that were moving quickly. She was amazed that Xia ruofei could still speak so calmly while running at such a high speed. “Xia,” she said,”you’re not only the most talkative Chinese I’ve ever seen, you’re also the strongest Chinese!” Monica’s watery blue eyes sized Xia ruofei up and down. In contrast to the Western girl’s boldness, Xia ruofei felt a little embarrassed. He smiled shyly and said,””Thank you!” The two of them chatted as they ran, and they got along very well. Monica was very outgoing, and Xia ruofei had a natural affinity with her. When he was running, he could chat with a beautiful woman and practice his spoken English. It was a great thing. Monica’s speed on the treadmill was set between 8 to 10 kilometers per hour. After running for more than half an hour, she was already drenched in sweat. Xia ruofei, who was running at 13 kilometers per hour, still maintained a very stable speed. There were only a few beads of sweat on his forehead. Monica was amazed. She lowered the speed of the treadmill. As she jogged, she glanced at Xia ruofei from time to time, her deep blue eyes shining with splendor. At this moment, a young white man in a tight sports vest, showing off his well – proportioned muscles, walked over. He first looked warily at Xia ruofei, who was chatting happily with Monica, then smiled at Monica charmingly. “Monica!” The young white man said,”I’ve been looking for you everywhere! So you’re in the gym. ” “Hello, Mr. Blake!” Monica also smiled. “Monica, you can call me George!” Blake looked at Xia ruofei and asked,””By the way, is this your new friend? Why don’t you introduce me to him?” Monica obviously didn’t have a particularly close relationship with Blake, so she still insisted on calling him by his last name.”Mr. Blake, this is my new Chinese friend, Xia!” Then, Monica said to Xia ruofei,””Xia, this is Mr. George Blake, the Senior Vice President of the Blake group, a France restaurant chain!” Xia ruofei smiled and nodded at Blake. Blake also smiled elegantly and nodded at Xia ruofei. “Mr. Xia, Monica and I have some work matters to discuss. If you don’t mind, can you let me use this treadmill?” Blake asked politely. Although his tone was very gentle, there was an unquestionable sense of superiority in his bones. Xia ruofei frowned but before he could say anything, Monica said,””Mr. Blake, I think you’re mistaken. I never talk about work during my leisure time. Besides, there are many treadmills here, and Mr. Xia is already using it. There’s a Chinese saying ... First ... Second ...” Monica’s last sentence was in Chinese. She stammered a few times but could not finish it. “First come, first served!” Xia ruofei smiled and reminded her. “Yes, yes, yes, first come, first served!” Monica said,”Mr. Blake, I don’t think your behavior just now was polite ...” Blake didn’t get angry. He just shrugged and said,”Okay, I’m sorry ... Mr. Xia, I’m sorry!” “It’s fine. ” Xia ruofei said indifferently. Blake looked at the settings on Xia ruofei’s treadmill and walked to the treadmill next to Xia ruofei ‘S. He put the towel and cup aside and got on the treadmill as well. “I hope that when Mr. Xia is tired and needs to rest, I can use your treadmill!” Blake said to Xia ruofei with confidence. After a series of beeping sounds, Blake also set the speed to 13 kilometers per hour and started running. Xia ruofei shrugged his shoulders and didn’t respond to Blake. While Blake was running fast, he would look at Xia ruofei from time to time. Xia ruofei was just calmly running at a constant speed. Occasionally, he would turn his head to talk to Monica easily and ignored Blake’s competition. Monica naturally knew that Blake was competing with her. As she jogged leisurely, she turned her head to look at the two men with interest, especially Xia ruofei. She knew that Xia ruofei had been running at such a high speed for more than half an hour. A speed of 13 kilometers per hour was actually very fast. Most people would not use such a fast speed for long-distance running. Xia ruofei had been running at such a high speed for half an hour, at least six to seven kilometers. Blake had just started running on the treadmill and was full of energy. Would this Chinese guy lose to Blake? Monica was interested. Little did she know that Xia ruofei did not take Blake’s competition seriously and had no intention of competing with him. He just kept running because he had not had enough running and was not even sweating. As for when he would be able to escape to his heart’s content, only God knew ... Ten minutes passed. Xia ruofei’s expression did not change and his rhythm was steady. Blake’s face was covered in sweat. Twenty minutes had passed. Xia ruofei’s expression did not change and his rhythm was steady. Blake’s breathing became more and more rapid. Thirty minutes passed. Xia ruofei’s expression did not change and his rhythm was steady. Blake was already panting like a bull, sweating like rain, and his pace couldn’t keep up with the rhythm. 40 minutes ...
