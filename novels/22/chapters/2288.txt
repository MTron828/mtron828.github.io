Liu Qunfeng laughed dryly and said,””Mr. Xia, you’ve misunderstood. I didn’t mean it that way. It’s just that my father’s treatment is at a critical stage. I hope you can understand my anxiety as his son ...”

“Chief Liu, I’ve made myself clear. I won’t let my personal matters affect elder Liu’s treatment!” Xia ruofei said,”I can guarantee that nothing will happen to the old master during this period!” I don’t know what you have to worry about. ”

At this point, Xia ruofei said indifferently,””Also, chief Liu, please be clear that I’m not reporting to you, but to the Liu family! In short, this trip had already been set and could not be changed! If the Liu family thinks that I have violated the agreement, I can also allow you to stop this treatment. I will definitely return the consultation fee in full. The previous half of the treatment, consider it a friendly gift from me! Alright, chief Liu, I’m really busy here, so that’s all for now!”

Xia ruofei hung up the phone without further explanation.

Xia ruofei did not like Liu Qunfeng’s pestering style, especially at the end when Liu Qunfeng mentioned the consultation fee. He even seemed to be complaining and threatening him, which made Xia ruofei even more unhappy.

If others respected him, he would naturally not get angry for no reason.

After hanging up the phone, Xia ruofei said to Wu Qiang,””Wu Qiang, drive faster. Song Wei is waiting for us at the capital Gate.”

“Yes, President Xia!” Wu Qiang said.

The next moment, he sped up and drove the Toyota Elfa commercial car through the traffic, heading toward Capital University.

In the Liu family’s courtyard, Liu Qunfeng put away his phone with a dark face.

Leaning on the bed, old man Liu had a faint smile on his face as he asked,””Qunfeng, what did little Xia say?”

“He said he had something urgent to attend to,” Liu Qunfeng said.”He said he had to go back to Sanshan. He’ll stop the acupuncture for a while and let you take your medicine ...”

“Oh!” Old man Liu said indifferently. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Liu Qunfeng stood up and said,”dad, this Xia ruofei is too arrogant!” I was just expressing my objection. After all, he’s already halfway through your treatment! Why did he suddenly leave the matters here and run back to the three mountains? If something happened to his condition, would he be able to make it back in time? As the patient’s family, can’t I say a few words?”

“What you said just now wasn’t very nice ... What did Xiao Xia say?” old man Liu asked with a smile.

“He said that if we’re not satisfied, we can only hold it in! Otherwise, we can just stop the treatment and he can return the consultation fee to us. The previous treatment can be considered a friendly gift!” Liu Qunfeng said,”you be the judge! These words were too arrogant! He’s sure that we don’t dare to fall out with him, so he’s taking advantage of us!”

Because of Liu haojun, Liu Qunfeng had always held a grudge against Xia ruofei. Recently, Xia ruofei had been treating old man Liu, and the effect was very obvious. He had only temporarily suppressed his dissatisfaction, but it all exploded today.

“Qunfeng, you’re already a government official, so why are you still so impatient?” old man Liu laughed. Since Xiao Xia said so, he naturally has confidence. Aren’t we all very clear about his medical skills? Besides, they must have something urgent to attend to, so we should understand each other!”

“What could be more important than your health?” Liu Qunfeng said, unconvinced.

“In my family, this is a big deal, but in other people’s eyes, it’s just a transaction for money.” Old man Liu said playfully,”Qunfeng, this little Xia is a strange person. I can’t see through him anyway. His strength shouldn’t be just what he appears to be. There must be a lot of things we don’t know ... It’s best not to make an enemy of such a person. It’s best to build a good friendship with him ... It’s a pity that we’re one step too late. We let that old ghost, old song, take the lead!”

At this time, there was a soft knock on the door of the ward, and a middle – aged man who looked like a Secretary walked in. He first nodded at Liu Qunfeng, then said to the old man on the bed,””Chief, we just received news that song Qiming of the song family was involved in a serious car accident an hour ago. It’s unknown whether he’s Dead or Alive!”

Although song Qiming was not elder song’s direct descendant, he had the same origin as the song family. He was elder song’s distant grandnephew and was of the same generation as song Rui. Therefore, in the eyes of the outside world, song Qiming was naturally a member of the song family.

Old man Liu raised his eyebrows and asked,””How could this happen?”

“We don’t know the details yet,” the middle – aged Secretary said.”According to the information we received, song Qiming was in a car accident on his way to Songping city for research. We can’t be sure if there’s any human intervention in this.”

Old man Liu nodded thoughtfully and said,””I know, you can go down first! Report anything about song Qiming to me immediately!”

“Yes, chief!” The middle – aged Secretary said with a slight bow, and then quietly left the ward.

A smile appeared on old man Liu’s face as he said,””QUN FENG, isn’t this a match? Xiao Xia has a close relationship with the song family. He’s in such a hurry to go back this time, it must be because of song Qiming. ”

Liu Qunfeng’s dissatisfaction dissipated a little. His attention was now on what was happening to song Qiming.
