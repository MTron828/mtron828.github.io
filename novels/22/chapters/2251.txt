2252 Mission complete_In the limited conditions of the mushroom house, Huang Lei’s lunch was quite sumptuous. In addition to the home – cooked Yuxiang shredded pork and other home – cooked dishes ordered by Tang Yitian’s family, there were also several Taoyuan vegetables and a steamed Chinese perch.

As for the fish that Xia ruofei and Tang Haoran had caught, Huang Lei took out a portion of them and used the most common method of braising them. They were fragrant and appetizing.

The two of them had caught quite a lot of fish. They definitely couldn’t finish them all in one meal, so they saved the rest. Who asked the festival Group to be so stingy? Right now, He Jiong, Huang Lei, and the others felt as if they had already eaten their last meal and had no more next.

Everyone enjoyed the meal. Under such an atmosphere, even some home – cooked dishes tasted completely different. What’s more,”chef Huang” ‘s cooking skills were indeed excellent. What was even rarer was that every dish he made tasted good. He knew a lot about Sichuan, shrimpy, and Huaiyang cuisines.

After lunch, Xia ruofei took a short break and was ready to leave.

Zhang Xing rushed upstairs to help Xia ruofei with his luggage. They bid each other farewell in the courtyard.

He Jiong and Xia ruofei hugged each other and said emotionally,”President Xia, I’ve had a great time chatting with you. It’s just that I’m really reluctant to part with you so soon!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Happy times are always short. Teacher he, thank you for taking care of me these past two days. If there’s a chance in the future, you’re welcome to visit the three mountains. Let me do my part as a good host!”

“I will! I will!” He Jiong said.

Huang Lei walked up and hugged Xia ruofei.””President Xia, I’ve already become a fan of your paradise Corporation! I have to thank you from the bottom of my heart! It’s because you’ve provided so many high quality products!”

He Jiong added from the side,”also, their company’s heart – nourishing soup has been hailed as a blessing for children with autism!” Moreover, the Paradise company insisted on selling at a low price and prioritized the supply of children in the country. We are very impressed by this!”

“Teacher he is right, director Xia. The Paradise Corporation is a respectable company!” Huang Lei said solemnly.

“You’re too kind! You’re too kind!” Xia ruofei said,”we should do more. The bigger the company, the greater the social responsibility. This is not a simple slogan!”

Then, Zhang Xing and Peng Chang also came forward to hug Xia ruofei and bid him farewell.

When Zhang Xing met Xia ruofei for the first time yesterday, he had already expressed his “thirty – year – old fan of the CEO” status. After more than a day of contact and understanding the details of Xia ruofei’s forced flight, he was even more impressed with Xia ruofei. Therefore, he was also very reluctant to part with him after a short meeting.

Xia ruofei patted Zhang Xing’s shoulder and smiled.””Little Xing, I’m always in Beijing, so we’ll have plenty of chances to meet in the future! Right, maybe we’ll have the opportunity to cooperate in the future! Our company may also add a spokesperson. ”

“If President Xia needs it, I’m willing to be the spokesperson for free!” Zhang Xing said excitedly.

“Hahaha! We’ll talk about the price later. I can’t let you suffer a loss. ” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”just give me a discount!”

Zhang Xing nodded heavily.

Peng Chang came over and said to Xia ruofei,”President Xia!” I really want to learn magic from you! The magic show yesterday was so cool!”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry,”you’re still thinking about this! “Pengpeng, magic requires talent and long – term practice. Although I’m not a professional magician, I practiced the magic trick yesterday for a long time, so ... I’m afraid it won’t be easy for you to learn ...”

“I’m very determined, I’ll definitely be able to persevere!”Peng Chang said.

“You’re talented in acting, but not necessarily in magic,”said Xia ruofei. Actually, it’s good to enjoy the magical feeling of magic, why do you have to get to the bottom of it?”

“But I really want to learn ...” Peng Chang said.”Maybe I’m talented too ...”

Xia ruofei saw that this child was still wasting his time on a dead end and didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. He looked to the side and saw two decks of playing cards on the table under the canopy. He walked over to open the box and casually took out one.

“This is an ordinary poker card, right?” he asked Peng Chang.

Seeing that Xia ruofei was about to perform magic again, Peng Chang couldn’t help but get excited. He nodded and said,””That’s right!”

He Jiong, Huang Lei, and the others also gathered around curiously. The cameraman even subconsciously pushed for a close – up.

Xia ruofei held the poker card in his hand and waved it in front of Peng Chang. Then, Peng Chang saw the poker card disappear.

Before he could react, Xia ruofei opened his hands and the poker card was held between his fingers.

Xia ruofei smiled.”This card has always been in my hands. However, no matter how I try to show it, you will always see that I have an empty hand.”

After that, Xia ruofei waved his hand again and showed it to Peng Chang from all angles.

Xia ruofei said,”actually, this is one of the basic techniques of magic. Your fingers must be very flexible and you must go through a lot of practice to be able to control it accurately. Even if there are so many cameras, you won’t be exposed!”

He really didn’t use the spirit map space this time. When he was in the Army, Xia ruofei had practiced this move. It was just that he didn’t hide poker cards, but razor blades. At a critical moment, these razor blades would become fatal weapons.

Hiding a shaving blade was naturally more difficult than hiding a poker card, because both ends were very sharp, and if one didn’t control it well, they would cut themselves.

Of course, Xia ruofei was not wrong. Most magicians would do this, but their level of proficiency would be different.

Then, Xia ruofei called Peng Chang to stand behind him and demonstrated the moves in slow motion.

From a different angle, Peng Chang could clearly see the poker cards moving between Xia ruofei’s fingers. Every control was precise and the person standing opposite him would not be able to find any flaws.

Xia ruofei continued,”when you can control it as well as I do, it will show that you have the talent to learn magic. This is just the minimum requirement. As for whether you can achieve anything, it will depend on the subsequent situation.”

Then, Xia ruofei stuffed the poker cards into Peng Chang’s hands and said with a smile,””You can practice it first! You’ll only feel it after you’ve tried it yourself. ”

Peng Chang subconsciously took the card and tried it according to Xia ruofei’s demonstration. The card fell to the ground.

Xia ruofei saw that Peng Chang was a little embarrassed, so he laughed and said,””It doesn’t matter. It’s always like this at the beginning. You can practice for a while! If you’re really talented in this area, I can teach you a few magic tricks. ”

With Xia ruofei’s current skills and coordination, it would not be difficult for him to learn a few magic tricks. If Peng Chang had such great perseverance, he could just teach Peng Chang what he learned on the spot.

As for the magic trick last night, if Peng Chang really wanted to ask, he would just say,”it’s too difficult, I don’t recommend you to try it.” He believed that after Peng Chang learned a few magic tricks, he wouldn’t be so persistent in learning the magic trick.

“Thank you, director Xia!” Peng Chang scratched his head in embarrassment.

Xia ruofei nodded with a smile and walked towards the door.

Huang Lei, He Jiong, Peng Chang, Zhang Xing, and Tang Yitian’s family were naturally sent out as well.

Xia ruofei took the luggage from Zhang Xing’s hands and turned to Tang Yitian,””Big brother Tang, you can go to my house directly after you finish recording the program tomorrow! It’s been a while since we’ve had a proper gathering. Since you’re in the capital, I’ll be the host and entertain you well!”

“Alright!” Tang Yitian said straightforwardly,”we didn’t even book a hotel when we came back. We’re already planning to stay at your place!” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“That’s right! If you guys book a hotel, I’ll definitely get mad at you!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”brother Tang! Jennifer! Haoran, I’ll go back first!”

Tang Yitian and Jennifer also smiled and nodded. Tang Haoran waved to Xia ruofei and said,””Goodbye, teacher!”

Xia ruofei saw that the little guy was still a little reluctant and couldn’t help but smile.””Haoran, see you tomorrow!”

He was reminding Tang Haoran that they only needed to record a program here for one more day. They would be able to see him around this time tomorrow.

Tang Haoran also came back to his senses. The sorrow of parting that he couldn’t help but feel just now was obviously reduced a lot. He grinned and said,””I know! I’ll see you tomorrow, teacher!”

Xia ruofei nodded and waved to the crowd. He took his luggage and walked down the steps.

A Buick GL8 commercial car had been waiting for a long time. Xia ruofei placed his luggage in the trunk and got into the car.

He Jiong and the rest followed him down the steps. Everyone came to the side of the car and said a few words of farewell to Xia ruofei. Then, the car started up slowly and left the mushroom house.

Xia ruofei’s recording had ended, so there was no need for the cameraman to follow him. There was only one camera that was filming Xia ruofei’s car from the entrance of the mushroom house, recording the scene of Xia ruofei’s car driving away.

The car made a turn and the mushroom house disappeared from the rearview mirror. Xia ruofei’s recording was officially over.

Of course, he didn’t take this car back directly.

They were still in the Paradise Club’s territory. Before the car left the club, Xia ruofei saw the Deputy Director of xiangnan TV, Gao Jun, and the others waiting by the roadside. Qin Yanan and he Yu were also standing in the crowd.

Without Xia ruofei’s instructions, the car had already come to a slow stop.

With a beeping sound, the electric door slowly opened.

Xia ruofei stepped out of the car. Gao Jun quickly stepped forward and said enthusiastically,” “President Xia! Thank you very much! Thank you very much! Although this episode hasn’t been edited out yet, I’ve been following the entire filming process closely. I can foresee that this will be a rather successful show. Who knows, the first episode might even be a hit!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”then I’m lucky that I didn’t fail you!” To be honest, after I accepted this job, I was quite nervous. After all, I didn’t study acting, so I was afraid that I would mess up your show!”

“Director Xia, you’re too humble. I saw everything clearly on the monitor. Your camera sense is very strong. Many professional actors can’t even compare to you!” Gao Jun said, then emphasized,”I’m not flattering you! Some of our station’s senior editors also feel the same way!”

“Gao tai, you’re too kind ...” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Gao Jun quickly said,”that’s a realistic evaluation!” There was no exaggeration at all! President Xia, in order to thank you for your support, I would like to invite you, assistant Qin, and assistant he to have a meal together. Please do come!”
