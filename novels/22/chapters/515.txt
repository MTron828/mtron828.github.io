Chapter 516: The crisis at the customs (1)

Naturally, Zhou Qing had booked the most expensive first – Class ticket for Xia ruofei, which had a special VIP passage.

The assistant he brought along quickly helped Xia ruofei with the boarding pass. Then, under the guidance of the dedicated VIP customer service, the group of them arrived at the VIP security passage.

Xia ruofei took the small registration case from Zhou Qing’s assistant and smiled at Zhou Qing.””Director Zhou, I’m really sorry to trouble you to come here so late at night!”

“You’re too kind, Mr. Xia!” Zhou Qing said humbly,”the chairman has personally instructed us to ensure your service.”

Naturally, Zhou Qing did not dare to neglect the task that Tang He had personally assigned him.

In particular, he knew very well that the relationship between Xia ruofei and Tang He seemed to be far beyond ordinary business partners. Last time, Xia ruofei’s farm built a small building, and Tang He even asked him to send a Mercedes – Benz as a congratulatory gift.

The value of this car was almost half of the building.

Originally, Zhou Qing wanted to arrange for someone to accompany Xia ruofei to Australia, but Xia ruofei firmly rejected the idea. Ran ran was no longer a child. Did he need someone to take care of him throughout the journey? He didn’t know about others, but he wasn’t used to this.

Xia ruofei shook Zhou Qing’s hand and said,””Chief Zhou, I’ll go in then! You guys should also go back and rest!”

Zhou Qing smiled and said,”you can go through the security check first!” If there’s anything you can’t bring, I’ll help you bring it back. When you arrive in Australia, our colleagues will pick you up. If you need anything, you can just tell them directly. ”

“Thank you!” Xia ruofei said.

Then, he dragged his small suitcase and, under the guidance of the VIP customer service Officer, passed through the security check through the VIP passage. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Xia ruofei turned around and waved at Zhou Qing. Then, she followed the VIP customer service to the VIP waiting room that Heron Island Airlines had set up at Sanshan airport.

As a local airline of the southeast province, the conditions of the VIP room at Sanshan airport were quite good.

In the 400 – Square – meter vip room, there were dozens of single – seat leather sofas scattered in a picturesque disorder. There was also a special wine – tasting area, tea art area, business area, and so on, providing a rich meal.

However, Xia ruofei, who had just finished his dinner, was not in the mood to enjoy the delicious – looking desserts. He found a quiet corner and sat down. He took out his tablet and chose a movie to kill time.

At around nine in the evening, a waiter came over to remind Xia ruofei that he could board the plane.

Hence, Xia ruofei kept his tablet and dragged his small suitcase to the boarding gate.

A huge Boeing 787 wide – body passenger plane was parked quietly in front of the terminal. The boarding passage for first – Class passengers was different from that of ordinary passengers. After Xia ruofei passed through the boarding gate, he was led by a professional through a door to get off the tarmac and then boarded the plane through a special accommodation ladder.

Although the first class cabin of Lu hang’s Boeing 787 was not as luxurious as the A380 super first class cabin, the comfort was still quite good. For long – distance flight, the experience was many times better than the “Tiger seat” in the economy Class.

After waiting on the plane for more than 20 minutes, the cabin door closed.

Soon, the plane trembled slightly and began to retreat slowly with the push of the ground cart. Then the engine was started, and the plane smoothly taxied to the runway.

Xia ruofei put on his seat belt as required. He could feel the sound of the engine getting louder. Then, he felt a push on his back and the plane began to accelerate on the runway.

The plane nimbly leaped into the night sky of Sanshan city, and the lights of thousands of homes outside the porthole gradually faded into the distance.

Long – distance flights were very boring, so Xia ruofei specifically chose this direct flight. It could save four to five hours in the air, and the entire flight time was about nine and a half hours. If everything went well, they could arrive in Sydney around 10 am local time.

As it was a night flight, after the plane entered level flight mode, a beautiful first – Class air stewardess came over and asked Xia ruofei softly if he needed the seat to be leveled and turned into a comfortable single bed.

One of the main reasons Xia ruofei chose to take the night flight was that he could take a nap on the plane and then reach his destination. Hence, he gave a definite answer.

With the help of the air stewardess, the comfortable leather seats were quickly laid flat, forming a single bed of about two meters. The only flaw was that the armrests on both sides could not be put down, so sleeping on it felt a little cramped.

However, it was already good enough to have a bed for a flight. Xia ruofei naturally would not ask for too much.

The stewardess brought a blanket over and politely asked Xia ruofei if he needed anything else.

Xia ruofei smiled and shook his head to express his gratitude. Then, he took off his coat and lay on the bed.

The lights in the first – Class cabin were dimmed, and soothing music flowed in the cabin. Xia ruofei soon fell asleep in such an environment.

When he woke up again, it was already very bright outside the porthole.

He called the air stewardess over and restored the seat. Then, he checked the LCD screen and found that the plane would land at Sydney’s Kingford Smith Airport in about an hour.

Xia ruofei got up and went to the bathroom to wash his face. Then, he sat back in his seat, fastened his seat belt, and waited for the landing.

When the plane was about to land, the air stewardess came to Xia ruofei with the entry card and asked him to fill in the items he brought into the country.
