2033 An unexpected gain (1)

The lid of the box was opened without any fluctuations.

There was no unknown danger as Xia ruofei had imagined. Instead, there was an aura that Xia ruofei was very familiar with. The box was filled with black stones that were neatly stacked. It was about half the box, and there were at least ten to twenty of them. These black stones were the realm stones that Xia ruofei had considered extremely precious.

Xia ruofei was also stunned.

To Xia ruofei’s spirit map space, the world stone was the best nourishment. If the space only relied on absorbing jades to level up, the consumption would undoubtedly be an astronomical figure. The conversion efficiency of the world stone would be much higher.

It was just that world stones were something that could only be encountered by luck and not sought out. It was extremely difficult to take the initiative to find one.

Xia ruofei had never thought that there would be such a pleasant surprise waiting for him after he destroyed a small Mafia family.

Could it be that in the future, he would have to find a few more evil mafia families and exterminate them? Xia ruofei thought.

Of course, this was just a joke. It was definitely a coincidence that the Gelman family’s treasure room had a boundary stone. No matter if these boundary stones were from the Moore family’s or the Gelman family’s collection, Xia ruofei could guarantee that they definitely did not know what these small black stones were used for. They probably just kept them as a collection.

The moment the box was opened, the White realmfox, who had been immersed in the mysterious space rules and constantly comprehending, suddenly opened its eyes.

Then, this little guy seemed to be injected with chicken blood, and his figure shot out like lightning, wanting to pass through the spatial barrier.

However, even though it was known as the darling of space, the White sector Fox did not have the ability to travel freely in the man – made space of the spirit map world.

The White realmfox was so anxious that it kept squeaking when it was bounced back after hitting the space membrane several times.

Its abnormality also quickly alarmed Xia Qing, who was busy in the space.

Xia Qing’s control of space was naturally not as good as the realm Fox ‘S. He also had no way to restrain the realm Fox, who had a tendency to go berserk. Seeing that this little fellow was going to continue jumping up and down, it was about to destroy the medicinal gardens and rice fields in the space. Xia Qing was also very anxious.

Just as he was about to contact his master, Xia ruofei, an invisible force enveloped the white fox and locked it in a narrow space cage. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

In fact, Xia ruofei had sensed the White realm Fox’s abnormal behavior in the spirit map space at the first moment. He knew that the little fellow’s abnormal behavior must have something to do with the realm stones. After all, these were the most delicious food in the realm Fox’s eyes!

After being restrained by Xia ruofei, the White realmfox continued to RAM around, hoping to break out of the cage. However, it was obviously in vain.

Xia ruofei used his spiritual energy to whisper into the White fox’s ear,””Hey! Little fellow! Are you crazy!”

The White realmfox squeaked as it gestured.

Xia ruofei easily understood what the white fox was trying to say. He couldn’t help but laugh.”You want these world stones? In your dreams! I’m the one who discovered it!”

Xia ruofei ignored the jumping realm Fox and continued,””I haven’t scolded you yet! You only know how to freeload off my family’s spatial law comprehension all day. I’ve asked you to help me find world stones, but you have no results at all! This time, I discovered it on my own! Speaking of which, this world stone is right under our noses, yet you actually have no reaction at all! I say ... Are you sure you can do it? You’re not bragging, are you?”

The White realm Fox waved its front claws and squeaked loudly, looking like a humiliated leopard.

Xia ruofei finally understood. The White realm Fox was trying to say that the realm stones were blocked by a strange container. Not a single trace of their aura leaked out, which was why it could not sense them.

Xia ruofei, who was still standing outside, couldn’t help but look at the gray box in his hand. This was definitely not an ordinary Kasaya. Not only could it block the probing of spiritual energy, but it could also block the world Fox’s heaven – defying sensing ability. Its material was definitely not ordinary.

Xia ruofei used his spiritual power to tell the white fox,””No matter what, you didn’t put in any effort at all for this harvest, so why should you share the fruits of victory with me? You can’t have the idea of getting something without working!”

The spirit map space was like a bottomless pit. If he wanted to level up, he had to keep absorbing world stones, and Xia ruofei didn’t even have enough! How could he give it to the white fox as food?

If it was really the realm Fox that sensed it and guided him to find the realm stone, then out of the spirit of the contract, Xia ruofei did not mind sharing some with it. However, under such circumstances, unless Xia ruofei’s head was stuck between a door, how could he have shared it for no reason?

The White realmfox’s expression changed to a pleading one. No matter how one looked at it, it seemed to be flattering.

Xia ruofei laughed,”you haven’t replenished your world stone for a long time. Are you starving?” Poor thing ...”

Then, Xia ruofei immediately changed the topic and said,””You ate so many pieces last time. If you didn’t save more, you’d deserve to starve to death!”

Xia ruofei continued,”don’t even think about this batch of world stones!” There’s no place for you! If you don’t want to starve to death, please don’t think about comprehending the laws by yourself all day long. Can you help me sense the world stone? I’ll leave my words here! As long as you can find a clue to the world stone, I will definitely not keep it for myself. I will definitely give it to you!”

“Alright! Stop it!” Xia ruofei said,”reflect on your actions there! When you stop, I’ll let you out!”
