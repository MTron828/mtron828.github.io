Chapter 1677: Everyone’s high_2

It was only when many busybodies reposted the Weibo post and tagged the peach blossom company’s official Weibo that it attracted the attention of the operations Department.

Xia ruofei’s good friend, Guan Ping, who was a new employee, happened to be on rotation in the public relations department these few days. The public relations and sales of the misty paradise company were under the jurisdiction of the big marketing department. As soon as Guan Ping entered the company, he hoped to be familiar with the situation in multiple positions. Hence, Xia ruofei asked Xiao Qiang to give Guan Ping more rotation opportunities.

Guan Ping saw so much information about the background ’s company’s official Weibo and knew that something big must have happened, so he quickly clicked on it.

When he saw the contents of those Weibo posts, Guan Ping couldn’t help but be stunned.

RUO Fei’s plane had an accident? He even helped to land the plane? Guan Ping felt that it was a little like a fantasy.

His first reaction was that it was an online rumor. However, after tracing the source, he found that even the official Weibo of Air Australia had confirmed the matter. Even the official Weibo of many mainstream media outlets had forwarded it immediately.

After Guan Ping recovered from his shock, he realized that this might be a good opportunity for free publicity.

He calmed himself down and did not let the sudden gift bag get to his head.

Guan Ping took out his phone and called Xia ruofei. As the boss’s good friend, Jian Jia had this advantage. If it was any other employee, they would have to report it to the higher – ups and would not be able to confirm it with Xia ruofei immediately.

While the discussion on Weibo was brewing, Xia ruofei had just finished his statement at the police station and was resting at Kaiyue hotel. His phone had activated international roaming, so Guan Ping’s call was picked up very quickly.

“Ruofei, are you in Saipan now?” he asked. Guan Ping asked impatiently.

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment and said,”even you know?” This matter has spread so quickly?”

“So the news on the internet is true?” Guan Ping said excitedly.

“What’s the news on the internet?” Xia ruofei was confused.”I’ve just settled down. I haven’t had time to go online yet!”

“The internet is saying that the plane you were on had an accident, and then ... Then you landed the plane!” As Guan Ping spoke, he felt that it was a little too bizarre, and he could not believe it.

He was afraid that Xia ruofei would laugh and refute this ridiculous statement.

Fortunately, what he was worried about did not happen. Xia ruofei said,””There is such a thing, but the news spread too fast! It must have been those passengers who asked me for a photo, right? Otherwise, my identity wouldn’t have been exposed ...”

“That’s great!” Guan Ping excitedly called out.

Xia ruofei looked depressed and said,”ping Zi, are we still brothers?” I’ve had an accident here! I was almost buried in the sea, and you’re still calling it good? I didn’t expect you to be like this, Guanping!”

Guan Ping laughed,”haven’t you already turned misfortune into fortune?” I mean, this is a great thing for our company! You don’t know how popular it is on the internet now! It’s such a waste if we don’t make use of such a good free advertising opportunity!”

“This feels like a blessing in disguise,” Xia ruofei said.

“Isn’t it?” Guan Ping said,”alright, leave the rest to us. You can enjoy the sunny beach of Saipan! However, I might need your cooperation later on ...”

“Don’t go too far!” Xia ruofei said,”going too far is as bad as not going enough!”

“I know! Don’t worry!” Guan Ping said.

After he hung up the phone, he couldn’t help but clench his fists in excitement. Then, he quickly pulled out the keyboard, created a new document, and began to write the proposal with his fingers flying.

Guan Ping, who was in an extremely good state, only took about 20 minutes to write a simple proposal. Then, he ran directly to the office of the marketing director, Xiao Qiang, and then reported to Dong Yun, who was temporarily in charge of the daily affairs of the company.

Soon, the publicity department of paradise Corporation got into action.

The netizens refreshed the news on major platforms with great interest. In fact, the real news was the official announcement of Quto and the Weibo of the first person who experienced it. After that, there were some other news posted by the passengers on the plane. In fact, they were all similar.

There were also many people who posted it on their moments, but soon the screenshots of their moments were also posted on the internet.

Just as everyone was at their peak and constantly looking for new news, the official Weibo of paradise Corporation finally updated a blog post.

“After confirming with President Xia, who is on a ‘vacation’ in Saipan, the information circulating on the internet is basically accurate. The story was as follows: This morning, President Xia and the company’s president, Feng Jing, had agreed to fly QF108 to Australia to inspect the company’s Paradise Farm in Australia. The flight had encountered some unexpected changes during the flight, causing all the pilots to be unable to fly the plane. In order to save the passengers on board and also to save himself, President Xia bravely stood up and successfully landed the plane in Saipan airport under the full technical guidance of the Qinba Captain, Mr. Brook. The plane and passengers are all safe and sound. ”

It was a standard blog post with a picture of paradise corporation’s .

Soon, the netizens reposted it one after another. In just a short time, the number of reposts reached more than 10000, and there were also thousands of comments.

If you think that this is the only Weibo post Tao Yuan company will post, then you are too naive. To Guan Ping, who has been deeply immersed in marketing, how could he not make a fuss about such a great opportunity?

Therefore, within a few minutes, the official Weibo of paradise Corporation released another Weibo post.

“Sister Tao saw the netizens ‘comments. Someone asked if there’s anything our President Xia doesn’t know. Sister Tao made a special overseas call to President Xia to verify it. President Xia said that he really can’t give birth to monkeys ... In fact, in the eyes of our employees, President Xia is really omnipotent! The jaded skin cream that’s selling like hotcakes on the internet, as well as the heart – nourishing soup that has benefited countless people with autism, were all independently developed by President Xia! He alone could be considered the core competitive strength of the Paradise Corporation! You’re asking why our President Xia is so awesome? That’s because he eats Taoyuan vegetables all year round and drinks Taoyuan Brand Da Hong Pao. When he’s free, he would also drink Taoyuan brand iron – Skin Dendrobium and Cordyceps sinensis to nourish his brain!”

Nowadays, personified operations were popular on social media and official Weibo. Peach blossom company’s official Weibo had always called itself “peach sister” Wan Wan. In fact, a few cute girls were in charge of the operations, but Guan Ping just happened to be on shift today.

Guan Ping used a girl’s tone to post such a Weibo post, and it didn’t feel out of place at all.

As soon as this Weibo post was posted, the netizens got excited again.

“Pfft ... I won’t give up, I’ll give up on the operations of Tao Yuan’s official Weibo!”

“This advertisement is simply traceless!”

“Previous poster, can’t you see such an obvious advertisement? are your eyes blind?”

“The teacher above me, can’t you have a sense of humor?”

“AI! We’ve all received nine years of compulsory education. Operations girl, how can you be so smart?”

After Guan Ping posted this, he did not rest. Instead, he quickly used his official Weibo account to reply to the netizens ‘comments. He tried to use a relaxed and happy tone, as well as some popular online phrases, to quickly close the psychological distance between everyone.

After about half an hour, Guan Ping copied the proposal he had prepared in advance into the Weibo post box again. He selected the poster picture that the art team had made at the last minute, checked it carefully a few times, and then clicked the post button.

Now, many netizens were watching the official Weibo of paradise Corporation, teasing the operations girls while looking for new news. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Just now, sister Tao called President Xia again to ask for instructions. In order to celebrate President Xia’s escape from death, we have decided to hold a big promotion at eighto’ clock tonight! For the details of the promotion, please look at the poster! We also have the Jade skin cream that everyone has been looking forward to!”
