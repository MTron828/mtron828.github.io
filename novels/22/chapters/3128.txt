3129 Let’s have dinner (1)

When his phone rang, Chen Xuan was sitting at his desk, typing away at lightning speed. His fingers were much faster than the average person, and the sound of his fingers tapping away on the keyboard was a continuous stream that seemed to have a different kind of charm to it.

Most people might be able to type at such a speed, but it seemed like they had never seen anyone like Chen Xuan, who didn’t even need to think when it came to coding. All he needed to do was to type furiously.

Of course, the programmers in the office were already immune to Chen Xuan’s heaven – defying performance.

In any case, Chen Xuan was quick with his work. The code was simple and well – structured, and no bugs were ever found. If they hadn’t seen it with their own eyes, no one would have believed that such beautiful code could be typed out at such a crazy speed.

Chen Xuan’s phone rang, and the sounds of typing stopped abruptly. He frowned as he glanced at the screen.

When he saw that the caller ID was Xia ruofei’s number, which he had just saved yesterday, he could not help but raise his eyebrows.

He picked up his phone and walked out of the office. He went to the corridor next door and picked up the call.”Brother Xia, you were looking for me?”

“Brother Chen, you don’t plan to work overtime today, right?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

“It’s alright today. I don’t have much work to do. I should be able to get off work on time!” “Brother Xia, is there something you need?” Chen Xuan asked.

“Oh! I’m just asking. ” Xia ruofei said,”also, if you don’t have any other plans after work, I would like to treat you to a meal.”

Chen Xuan pondered for a moment before saying,””No problem!”

“Alright then! I’ll be waiting for you at home!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Oh right, I’ll send you my home address! Can you find it?”

“Brother Xia, why don’t you add me on WeChat?” Chen Xuan asked. Just send me your location! My WeChat is this phone number ...”

Xia ruofei was taken aback. He had always treated Chen Xuan as the young sect master of the first heaven society. He had always felt that Chen Xuan might not know about some of the modern technology methods. Hence, the first thing he thought of was to give Chen Xuan the address instead of using a simple method like WeChat to locate it.

After hearing Chen Xuan’s words, Xia ruofei realized that this guy was a true programmer! He was definitely good at using his phone and computer.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.”Alright, I’ll add you on WeChat and send you my location!”

“Okay, brother Xia. I’ll go back to the office first.” “See you in the evening!” Chen Xuan said.

“See you in the evening!”

After Xia ruofei hung up the phone, he opened WeChat and used Chen Xuan’s phone number to do a search. As expected, he found Chen Xuan’s WeChat number.

Chen Xuan’s WeChat name was “young master Chen of Tian Yi”. This was a rather Chuunibyou name. The first thing people would think of was a second – generation rich kid. It was completely different from the young, promising, and gentle image of Chen Xuan.

Xia ruofei chuckled as he added “young master Chen of Tianyi” as a friend on WeChat.

Chen Xuan was obviously waiting as well. He approved Xia ruofei’s application immediately.

Xia ruofei sent the location of the jiangbin villa district to Chen Xuan. He then sent the exact building number of his villa to Chen Xuan. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Chen Xuan quickly replied.

It was an expression, a cute cartoon figure nodding quickly.

After Xia ruofei saw it, he almost spat out his rice.

Chen Xuan’s image on WeChat was so different from how he looked in real life.

Xia ruofei did not reply to Chen Xuan. He packed his things and left the office.

He greeted Qin Yanan, who was on duty at the door, and walked into his exclusive elevator. He went directly to the underground parking lot and drove back to the jiangbin villa community.

On the way back, Xia ruofei gave Song Wei and Ling Qingxue a call each and asked them to come over for dinner.

Xia ruofei knew very well that with the first heaven society’s ability to collect information, his relationship with Song Wei and Ling Qingxue had probably been discovered by Chen Nanfeng long ago.

Chen Xuan might not have known, but Chen Nanfeng definitely knew.

Hence, Xia ruofei did not plan to hide it anymore. He decided to let Song Wei and Ling Qingxue show their faces. If Chen Xuan really wanted to harm Song Wei and Ling Qingxue, he would have to be more careful.

After all, Xia ruofei would not leave the three mountains until he was sure that Song Wei and Ling Qingxue were safe.

Moreover, he would also let Song Wei stay at the three mountains for the time being and not return to the capital. Otherwise, it would be difficult for him to take care of both sides.

Xia ruofei asked Song Wei and Ling Qingxue to go to the jiangbin villa earlier.

Therefore, he went to the supermarket to buy some groceries. When he returned to his villa, Song Wei and Ling Qingxue had already arrived in the same car.

Ling Qingxue had left the company right after receiving Xia ruofei’s call. However, she had driven to the Provincial Party Committee’s family residence to pick up Song Wei and then drove to the Riverside Villa area. Therefore, everyone had entered the area at the same time.

Xia ruofei had just parked his car when he saw Ling Qingxue’s beetle turn into his field of vision. Very quickly, Ling Qingxue’s car had also entered the villa’s courtyard.

Ling Qingxue and Song Wei got out from the car from the left and right sides.

Ling Qingxue looked at Xia ruofei, who was carrying two bags of vegetables, and asked with a smile,””What kind of guests are we having tonight? You’re actually buying so many ingredients when you have them at home ...”
