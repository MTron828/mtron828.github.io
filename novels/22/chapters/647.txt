Chapter 648: The completion of the disk array (1)

Looking at the budget that Jiang Hua and manager li had prepared – Xia ruofei could not help but grit his teeth – the total budget was almost eight million Yuan.

However, Xia ruofei understood after looking through it.

The requirements for the environment of the breeding of Chinese perch were too high. High – Quality sound – absorbing materials had to be used in the construction. In addition, the air, water temperature, Ph, and so on of the entire breeding workshop had very strict requirements.

The circulating water in the fish pond had to reach the standard of direct drinking water. A set of large water purification equipment alone would cost about two million Yuan.

Although Xia ruofei knew that the clam fish he provided would be very vigorous and not so delicate, this reason was not enough to be shared with others. There was no way he could ask for a lower standard.

Jiang Hua looked at Xia ruofei nervously. He was afraid that the boss would think that it was too expensive and give up on the project.

It wasn’t easy to find such a high – paying job, and it was in charge of a business with a lot of autonomy.

Fortunately, Xia ruofei didn’t hesitate. He smiled and said,””No problem, we’ll build it according to this standard!”

Jiang Hua let out a long sigh of relief.

“Manager Li, I’ll have the finance department transfer the first payment to your account soon,” Xia ruofei said to manager li.

“President Xia, there’s no hurry, there’s no hurry. We’re all old acquaintances!” Manager Li said happily.

The Liang family’s jianda group was considered to be of an upper – Middle scale in Sanshan city. They had fixed partners, and some of the building materials and equipment were settled regularly without having to be paid in cash. The workers ‘salaries were also settled monthly, so it would not affect the project funds if they arrived a few days later.

Xia ruofei was on very good terms with Liang Qichao, the heir of the corporation, and his boss, Liang Weimin, was very friendly to Xia ruofei. Manager li was well aware of this, so he had never urged for payment, including the previous construction projects.

......

Moreover, almost all of Xia ruofei’s construction projects had been handed over to the jianda group in the past year, and manager li was in charge of them. Manager li had earned a lot of money from the Commission alone. Because the boss valued him, the best engineering team had been transferred over. With high efficiency, it was natural to make more money.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”let’s follow the rules!” Friendship was friendship, but business was business! Manager li, please hurry up and report to uncle Liang. We’ll be signing the contract in two days, and some equipment needs to be ordered in advance. ”

“Alright, alright!” Manager Li said quickly.

“By the way, the renovation and construction of the fish pond are urgent.” Xia ruofei said,”if we can’t get our hands on it, we can stop other projects for a while and prioritize the fish pond.”

“I understand! President Xia, don’t worry!” Manager li patted his chest and promised,”this project is not a big one. If we concentrate our manpower and resources, it can be completed in 20 days!”

“Then I’ll leave it to you guys!” Xia ruofei nodded.

Twenty days would be almost two years in the origin space. If the first batch of pomfrets stayed in the original space, they wouldn’t be baby pomfrets anymore. Also, the fish pond in the original space was too small. It couldn’t keep more than five hundred pomfrets.

However, Xia ruofei already had a plan. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei had done an experiment when he first got the space.

Back then, the stream in the original space extended all the way to the space membrane, and the fish that Xia ruofei had intentionally placed in the stream was blocked by the space membrane.

In other words, it was impossible for living beings from the outside world to pass through the membrane wall in space.

Hence, Xia ruofei decided that after these little fish had grown to a certain extent in the original space, he would move them to the river in the new space.

The river in the new space was wide and long. Even if there were a hundred times more fish, it could still be kept. All Xia ruofei needed to do was to move some of the mud from the fish pond into the river so that the river could form a complete microbial chain and the rays would have an endless supply of food.

In addition, a portion of pomfrets were left in the original space to continue breeding young fish.

There was another benefit to this. Xia ruofei could have an endless supply of fish. When the farm needed them, they could just choose the right size fish from the river in the new space.

As for the farm fish pond, it was a good ‘cover’ for Xia ruofei to sell the precious Chinese perch.

After getting Xia ruofei’s approval, manager li and Jiang Hua did not even wait for a minute and immediately started the fish pond’s transformation work.

Although the official contract had not been signed yet, manager li had immediately transferred the construction machinery and the construction team to the fish pond to start the construction. He had also arranged for special people to order all kinds of special equipment and building materials.

Now, the registration of the pharmaceutical company, the recruitment, the production of the iron maples, the transformation of the farm and fish pond, and other work were all progressing at the same time. The whole company was a busy scene.

After Xia ruofei was done with the arrangements, he had a lot of free time.

He took some time to brew two portions of heart – nourishing soup and gave them to Xue Jinshan. As the heart – nourishing soup had an obvious calming effect after an hour of consumption, it could increase one’s concentration and comprehension. Hence, Xia ruofei had specially diluted it to one ratio. Otherwise, the effect would be too heaven – defying.

The truth proved that Xia ruofei’s actions were necessary.

Xue Jinshan’s professionalism was beyond Xia ruofei’s imagination. He had really taken a portion of the heart – nourishing soup to experience the medicinal effects.
