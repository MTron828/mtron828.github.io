Chapter 1256: Eternal interest (1)

Translator: 549690339

“George, shut up!” Old Blake glared at Blake and said,”I’m talking to Mr. Xia. It’s not your place to interrupt!”

Little Blake covered his burning cheek with his hands. His eyes were filled with fear and humiliation. He didn’t dare to disobey his grandfather, but the current situation made him very panicked and lost his composure.

Old Blake scolded his grandson and turned to look at Xia ruofei.

His eyes were deep and full of meaning, but Xia ruofei was not afraid at all. His eyes were as calm as water as he looked at old Blake quietly.

After half a minute, old Blake finally smiled and said,””Mr. Xia’s request is not too much. I agree on behalf of the Blake group and the Blake family!”

Little Blake’s face turned ashen. He couldn’t help but shout,””Grandpa! You can’t do this!”

“Shut up!” Old Blake reprimanded him without hesitation,”George, this is a lesson for you. From today on, you don’t have to deal with the affairs of the group. Just be good!”

Blake’s face turned pale.

He knew his grandfather’s way of doing things. This was almost like giving up on him completely.

As one of the heirs of the family, Blake held an important position in the group. Now, not only was his identity as the heir gone, but his position in the group had also been removed. It was undoubtedly a disaster for him.

The Blake family was a big family that had been around for hundreds of years. There were many members in the family. Old Blake had 20 to 30 grandsons and granddaughters, and that was only the direct line of descent. If all the members were included, there were at least one to two hundred people in the generation of young Blake.

Among so many people, there were naturally good and bad people. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Blake was listed as one of the legal heirs and held an important position in the company Group. He was one of the best in his generation.

Many people had been given up early on. Although they could also get their monthly allowance and live a life without worry, they had no future to speak of. They were basically just wasting their time and waiting for death.

In the past, Blake always had a strong sense of superiority when he faced his family brothers and sisters. He didn’t expect that he would fall to that kind of position overnight.

It would have been fine if he hadn’t gotten it before, but now that he had seen the scenery at the top, he had fallen into the mortal world. For the ambitious Blake, it was completely unacceptable.

He didn’t expect that he would end up in such a state just because of a Chinese man and his touching emotional intelligence.

It could be said that Blake’s intestines were turning green with regret.

If he had known that Xia ruofei was such a fierce person that even his own grandfather would rush to ask him for cooperation, he would not have dared to provoke Xia ruofei in Shen Cheng city!

Unfortunately, there was no medicine for regret in this world.

After scolding his grandson, old Blake immediately turned to Xia ruofei and put on a friendly smile.”Mr. Xia, the Blake family will make a public statement very soon to strip George of his position as the heir. At the same time, the Blake group will also make a statement to dismiss George from all his positions in the group. Are you satisfied with this?”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be secretly surprised. He was a little impressed by this sly old Fox’s courage.

A public statement would be like water that had been poured out. For a big consortium like the black group, it was impossible for them to go back on their word. Wouldn’t that be like slapping their own faces?

Although he didn’t make a public apology, those who knew the inside story naturally knew what was going on when he was publicly relieved of all his duties and his status as the family heir.

The only difference was that the Blake group’s face in front of the general public was saved.

Old Blake had been very sincere so far, so there was no harm in continuing the discussion.

After all, he didn’t need anything from the black group. On the contrary, the black group needed him, so he had the initiative.

Thinking of this, Xia ruofei smiled and said,””If I say I’m not satisfied, will Mr. Old Blake fall out with me?”

“I believe in Mr. Xia’s heart.” Old Blake laughed,”a man who can achieve great things doesn’t care about trifles!”

Xia ruofei didn’t feel anything about old Blake’s flattery. He smiled and said,””You’re old master Ma’s friend, so I’ll give you face and do as you say! Now, we can talk about our cooperation. ”

Old Blake was also happy, but he didn’t rush to get to the point. Instead, he looked at young Blake and said,””George, you can go out first! Reflect on your actions in the hotel! You’re coming back to France with me tomorrow!”

Although Blake was unwilling, he didn’t dare to resist his grandpa’s power. He could only nod and stand up silently.

He glanced at Xia ruofei and left the room without a word.

Blake’s eyes were complicated before he left. There was regret, despair, and deep resentment.

Xia ruofei’s mouth twitched. He didn’t think much of it.

To put it bluntly, Blake was just a spoiled child. He was not on the same level as Xia ruofei.

After Little Blake left, only old Blake and Xia ruofei were left in the room.
