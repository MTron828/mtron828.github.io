Xia ruofei’s suggestion made Feng Rao’s heart skip a beat.

This strong – looking strong woman was actually very clear that in the softest part of her heart, there was already a faint figure of a person. That trace of emotion that had gone through hundreds and thousands of twists and turns had long been unconsciously born.

However, Feng Jing was a strong woman, so her rational voice still prevailed.

She was older than Xia ruofei by a few years and they were in a boss – employee relationship. Most importantly, Xia ruofei already had a girlfriend and they were very loving.

They were so loving that they would do that in the office ...

Feng Rao couldn’t help but recall her experience of eavesdropping on the wall, and her face burned.

Xia ruofei saw that Feng Jing’s face had turned red for no reason. He was also confused and did not know what he had said wrong.

It was just a simple chat, right? Xia ruofei muttered in his heart.

Feng Rao’s expression quickly returned to normal. She smiled and said, “It’s fine. There are many things to do at the company. I’m going back to San Shan in the afternoon.”

Xia ruofei said,”there’s no need to be in such a hurry.” You’ve been working overtime for the past few days, and now that you’ve finally finished your work, what’s wrong with taking a day or two off? I’m not the kind of boss who oppresses his employees! Boss Feng, just stay and have fun for a day or two! The company will cover all the expenses during our stay in Hong Kong, just treat it as an employee benefit!”

Feng Rao tidied her hair and smiled,””Chairman, it’s not your fault. I really can’t stay idle. I’ve earned more than 70 million this time. I’m still thinking of quickly solving the issue of the new production line of the pharmaceutical factory. The sooner the jaded skin cream is released on the market, the sooner it will generate profits! Also, I’ve been thinking about the location of the headquarters. Even if I stay in Hong Kong, I don’t think I have the mood to play ...”

Xia ruofei had no more doubts after hearing Feng Rao’s words.

He knew this female general under his command very well. She could really forget to eat and sleep for work.

Moreover, Feng Jing’s obsession with the jaded skin cream was almost demonic. Now that the technical problems of the jaded skin cream’s mass production had been solved, and the company had plenty of funds, it was normal for her to rush back to promote this project.

Xia ruofei could only nod helplessly and say,””Alright ...”

Feng Jing saw Xia ruofei’s lost expression and felt her heart warm. She clinked her glass with Xia ruofei’s and smiled.”Chairman, thank you for your concern ...”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,””We’re family, no need to be so formal!” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The two of them sipped their red wine at the same time. Xia ruofei continued,””You haven’t booked the plane tickets, right? I’ll give pang Hao a call and get him to book it for you immediately!”

“It’s just a small matter, I’ll handle it myself,”Feng Rao quickly said.

Xia ruofei took out his phone and said,””I’m a little incompetent as the chairman. There are a lot of things that rely on you to support on your own. Otherwise, I’ll feel bad ...”

After that, Xia ruofei immediately dialed pang Hao’s number.

The call went through quickly and Xia ruofei said,””Fatty, check the flights back to San Shan from Hong Kong this afternoon and book a ticket for director Feng. Remember, it has to be first – Class!”

After the call, Xia ruofei put his phone back into his pocket and smiled at Feng Jing.

Xia ruofei’s teeth were white and neat, and his smile was clean. He seemed to have a natural affinity with others, which made Feng Jing feel warm inside.

“Chairman,” Feng Jing said softly,”you’re the real core of the company. The company’s development is all dependent on you. I’ve only done some administrative work ...”

Feng Jing had been working at paradise Corporation for a long time, and she was well aware of Xia ruofei’s importance to the company.

Taoyuan vegetables, Taoyuan fruits, top – Quality abalones, iron – skinned maples, wild Chinese perch, Jade skin cream ... Any of these products were phenomenal enough to shock the market. In addition to Xia ruofei’s strong network and resources, these formed the most important conditions for the company’s development.

It could be said that with these prerequisites, any other general manager would be able to achieve great success as long as they were not too bad.

Therefore, even though Feng Jing worked hard and even forgot to eat and sleep, she never dared to claim credit for herself.

On the contrary, she felt that she was very lucky to be able to get this life – changing job at the beginning stage of paradise Corporation.

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,””Without your hard work, the company would still be a small company. You’re the pillar of our paradise Corporation ...”

After saying this, Xia ruofei’s expression turned strange. He smiled bitterly and said,””President Feng, I think ...”

“What’s wrong?”

“The way we flatter each other, don’t we have no moral integrity and no lower limit?”

Feng Rao couldn’t help but burst into laughter. The strange atmosphere between the two of them disappeared in an instant.

After the celebration party ended, Feng Jing quickly returned to Xia ruofei’s Presidential Suite to pack her luggage. Ma Zhiming personally arranged for a car to send her to the airport.

Xia ruofei stayed in Hong Kong and spent a few days with Huanhuan.

He brought Huanhuan to the Ocean Park, Disneyland, Port Victoria, and other places. Ma Zhiming and Tian Huixin were naturally very assured of Xia ruofei. They assigned a driver to him and then enjoyed the rare couple’s time together.
