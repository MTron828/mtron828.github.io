Chapter 938: Chinese Kongfu_1

Translator: 549690339

Tan Lili’s beautiful face turned pale. Two tall and burly white bodyguards completely blocked her way. At this moment, there was really no way out.

Tan Lili helplessly looked back at Zheng Peng, only to see him standing there with a pale face, not daring to move. He even deliberately avoided her gaze.

Tan Lili was even angrier. She didn’t expect Zheng Peng to be so cowardly when he was in trouble. He didn’t even dare to say a word when his girlfriend was about to be taken for sex.

Yamada Jiro had a smug smile on his face. His lecherous eyes fell on tan Lili’s plump buttocks. He had already begun to imagine the scene of him pressing tan Lili under his body and wantonly humiliating her tonight.

Yamada Jiro was particularly fascinated by women’s buttocks, even a little perverted, so he had his eyes on tan Lili’s plump figure as soon as he came in. Even after being rejected by tan Lili, he couldn’t help but give her a slap on her perky buttocks.

However, he did not expect tan Lili’s reaction to be so intense. She even started screaming and shouting.

However, Yamada Jiro felt that this was good too. He could use this as an excuse to F * ck this strong – willed woman.

Yamada’s company wasn’t a giant in the Wei nation’s retail industry, but it wasn’t small either. Yamada Jiro had been pampered since he was a child and had developed an arrogant personality. Especially on this trip to Australia to develop, he had established a good friendship with Tang Hu, and the two sides were about to carry out in – depth cooperation. With Tang Hu’s position in the underground world, Yamada Jiro was simply unscrupulous.

Especially when he saw that the Australian Caucasians also did not dare to speak up for justice, Yamada Jiro was even more proud.

Tan Lili’s face was drained of blood. Her body trembled slightly as she looked at the two white bodyguards approaching her. She felt endless despair when she thought about the nightmare she was going to face tonight ...

Just as the two white bodyguards were about to grab tan Lili, a cold voice was heard.””Stop!”

The two Caucasians subconsciously stopped. Yamada Jiro also narrowed his eyes and looked in the direction of the sound.

A young man with an Asian face stepped out of the crowd and walked toward tan Lili.

Tan Lili turned her head around like a drowning person who had just found a life – saving straw. Then, her eyes widened.

The one who stepped forward was naturally Xia ruofei.

Tan Lili felt a mix of emotions when she saw Lin Qiao’s boyfriend, who was hiding in the corner and didn’t dare to make a sound, stand up for her. She had been mocking him before.

“Baka! Who are you? Do you have the right to speak here?” Yamada Jiro asked with a serious face.

At this time, another person stood out from the crowd and smiled at Yamada Jiro.”Mr. Yamada, he’s the owner of West Winery. This stupid Chinese is probably trying to stand up for his fellow Countryman, right?”

The person who spoke was Brody. He had been watching from the crowd. Because of Xia ruofei, he didn’t like the Chinese tonight, even Zheng Peng, who was carefully trying to get close to him. Seeing Zheng Peng almost being forced into a desperate situation by Yamada Jiro and tan Lili having no way to escape, Brody couldn’t help but feel a sense of pleasure.

What surprised him even more was that the person he hated the most, Xia ruofei, had actually stupidly stood up at this time.

Initially, Brody had thought that Paradise Farm’s background was too big. If Xia ruofei was really determined to deal with his family’s Golden Oak winery, what should he do? Now that Xia ruofei had taken the initiative to provoke Yamada Jiro, Brody was overjoyed and immediately stood up to “expose” Xia ruofei’s identity.

When the Australians heard that Xia ruofei was just the owner of a small winery, they all looked at him with pity. Although many of them admired Xia ruofei’s courage, they felt that his behavior was like hitting a rock with an egg.

Yamada Jiro was also stunned for a moment before he reacted. He looked at Xia ruofei as if he was an idiot and said,””So it’s the Chinese again! No wonder you’re so stupid!”

Then, Yamada Jiro waved to the two other bodyguards behind him and said,””You guys, go and teach that China man a lesson. What’s the consequence of being a busybody!”

“Yes!” The two white men responded loudly.

Then, they approached Xia ruofei with sinister smiles on their faces.

The fire of hope in tan Lili’s heart was gradually extinguished. The situation was obvious. Yamada Jiro had a lot of people and power. Even if Xia ruofei was not only the owner of West Winery, but also a major shareholder of Paradise Farm, he was not enough to stand out in this situation.

Although he wasn’t small, he looked so weak in front of the two white bodyguards who were as strong as polar bears.

Could it be that he was really doomed tonight? Tan Lili thought sorrowfully.

She even felt a little guilty for implicating Xia ruofei. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Liang Qichao and Lin Qiao looked worried. Lin Qiao knew that Xia ruofei had served in the Special Forces and was good at fighting. Liang Qichao was even more worried. He didn’t even consider that Paradise Farm would be in a passive position after offending Yamada Jiro and Tang Hu. He rolled up his sleeves and was ready to help Xia ruofei.

However, before Liang Qichao could do anything, Xia ruofei had already taken the initiative to greet the two white bodyguards.

The two white men approached Xia ruofei from both sides. Xia ruofei’s footsteps gradually quickened. When they were close enough, the two white men raised their bowl – sized fists and the smile on their faces became even more cruel.

At this moment, Xia ruofei suddenly lowered his center of gravity. With a beautiful sweep of his leg, the two Caucasians fell to the ground like dumb bears. They covered their legs and screamed in pain.

The onlookers gasped at the same time. Such a simple move was extremely practical. In addition, Xia ruofei’s movements were as fast as lightning. It was very pleasing to the eye.

“Oh! Chinese Kongfu!”Many people couldn’t help but exclaim.

Yamada Jiro’s face was livid as he cursed,””Baka! A bunch of trash! Aren’t you guys going to attack me together? Beat him to death!”

The two white bodyguards struggled to get up from the ground. Two other strong white men also left tan Lili behind. The four of them closed in on Xia ruofei.

Their expressions were much more serious than before, but they still didn’t believe that the thin and weak – looking Easterner could have much power. They thought that the two of them had just underestimated their enemy.

A disdainful smile appeared on Xia ruofei’s face. Without waiting for them to come to him, he took the initiative to greet them. Xia ruofei’s footsteps slowed down, and then he lightly stepped on a sofa.

He turned his body sideways and kicked one of the White bodyguards in the chest.

The White bodyguard suddenly felt as if he had been hit by a truck. He flew backward involuntarily and only landed on his butt after flying for three or four meters.

After Xia ruofei kicked the White bodyguard, he twisted his body and kicked another strong white man. Then, he kicked the third and fourth one.

The four bear – like bodyguards were all kicked away. Xia ruofei did not land on the ground at all. When the last bodyguard was kicked away, he did a beautiful side somersault and stood firmly on the ground. Then, he hooked his finger at them in disdain.

This set of movements was extremely gaudy, like Huang Feihong’s Foshan Shadowless Kick in the movie.

The farm owners and winery owners who were watching the show gasped again and exclaimed. Some young people even whistled.

Xia ruofei’s movements were too cool. He came from the mysterious East. This was the first time these people had seen Chinese Kungfu, and they couldn’t help but exclaim in admiration.

Xia ruofei did not use too much strength in the first kick, but he used a bit more strength in the second kick. Hence, after the four white men were kicked away, they could not stand up after struggling for a long time.

Xia ruofei’s expression was cold as he walked towards Yamada Jiro.

Yamada Jiro’s face darkened. He did not expect his bodyguards to be so useless. Some of the four men were mercenaries who had been through countless life and death situations, and one of them was even an underground champion. They had a lot of fighting experience, but in front of Xia ruofei, they were as weak as chickens.

Seeing Xia ruofei walking towards him unhurriedly, Yamada Jiro could not help but feel a huge pressure.

As he slowly backed away, he said,””I’m Mr. Tang Hu’s friend. You’d better think clearly about what you’re doing!”

“Don’t talk about Tang Hu. So what if you’re Tang Yitian’s friend?” Xia ruofei said indifferently,”today, you have insulted the Chinese again and again and even tried to rape my fellow countrymen. Do you think I should give you a memorable lesson?”

Yamada Jiro didn’t expect Tang Hu’s name to be completely useless. In his opinion, this young man was either too powerful to care about Tang Hu, or he was an idiot who did things without considering the consequences.

However, according to Brodie, Xia ruofei was only the owner of a winery. How powerful could the owner of a small winery be? It seemed that the second possibility was more likely. This young man was acting unscrupulously just because he had good skills!

As Yamada Jiro thought about it, he took out a gun from his pocket and pointed the black muzzle at Xia ruofei.

In an instant, the entire place fell silent.

All kinds of screams were heard. When the well – dressed upper – Class people saw Yamada Jiro take out a gun, they were so scared that they quickly dodged to the side.

Xia ruofei was still five to six meters away from Yamada Jiro. He squinted his eyes and said,””I hate being pointed at with a gun, especially by the Japanese! You’ve successfully infuriated me ...”
