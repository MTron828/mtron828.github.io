2464 The ambition of a rich man (2)

Young master Yun smiled and said,”it’s a piece of cake! Let’s go! I’ll bring you to meet him now!”

“Thank you, young master Yun!” Zhou Yuan quickly said,”I got a Ferrari Enzo a while ago. If you like it ...”

Hearing this, young master Yun’s eyes narrowed slightly, and he asked,””You actually managed to get Enzo? Amazing!”

Ferrari Enzo was born in 2002. It was a gift for the 60th anniversary of the Ferrari brand. It was also the first flagship top sports car created by the Ferrari brand after entering the 21st century.

At that time, there were only 399 of this car in the world. It was said that the Pope’s custom – made model was added in the end, so there were only 400 of it in the world.

The key was that each of the Ferrari Enzo had an owner long ago. After all, they were cars from more than a decade ago. Unless you bought them back then, you wouldn’t be able to buy them even if you had the money.

Zhou Yuan chuckled.”My dad has a good personal relationship with a rich man in Dubai. He has two Enzos at home. I had to pester him for a long time before my dad helped me to ask that rich man to buy one. He gave up one of them!”

Young master Yun was a person who loved cars as much as his life. When he heard the news about Ferrari Enzo, he was naturally very excited. Zhou Yuan was playing along.

“How’s the car?”young master Yun couldn’t help but ask.

Zhou Yuan smiled,”I tried driving it in Dubai previously. Although this Enzo is more than ten years old, it’s been maintained quite well. I don’t think it’s any different from a new one!” And this car’s mileage is less than 1000 kilometers!”

“Less than 1000 kilometers after more than ten years? ” Young master Yun was in disbelief.

Zhou Yuan chuckled,” that Dubai tycoon really likes to collect all kinds of sports cars!” Most of the time when I bought it, I just enjoyed it and didn’t drive it much!”

Zhou Yuan continued,” young master Yun, do you know how exaggerated it is? ” He had a large three-story garage specifically for him to store all the sports cars in his collection! It was a spectacular sight! He has hundreds of sports cars of all kinds. How many times do you think he can drive this Enzo in a year? ”

Zhou Yuan was no match for young master Yun in terms of politics, but when it came to luxury cars, he immediately started to talk non-stop, finally regaining some confidence.

“Then you’re really lucky!” Young master Yun said with a hint of envy, ” this kind of person doesn’t lack money at all. It’s harder than ascending to heaven to get him to sell you his collection of cars! ”

“Isn’t that so? ” Zhou Yuan said with a trace of pride, ” the main thing is that my father’s face is big, so he wanted me to step in personally. It’s already good enough that he didn’t chase me out, so why would he sell it to me? And it’s not expensive, only 20 million!”

Back then, the Ferrari Enzo was sold for about 600000 dollars, which was about three to four million Chinese dollars. However, the value of this model of car couldn’t be measured by normal standards. An ordinary car would probably be worthless after more than ten years, but the Ferrari Enzo was completely different. The car was still maintained as if it was new, and its collection value rose steadily because of the commemorative significance of this model and the general rule that rare things were more expensive.

It was indeed not expensive to buy it for more than 20 million.

Following that, Zhou Yuan lowered his voice and said,””Young master Yun, I’ll send this car to you after it arrives at the port. Just leave the procedures to me!”

Young master Yun pondered for a moment, then waved his hand and said,””Forget about the formalities. When the car arrives, just let me drive it for a few days!”

Zhou Yuan immediately replied,”understood!” I’ll send it to you when the car arrives!”

Young master Yun wasn’t noble and unquestionable, but he didn’t want to cause any negative influence and avoid being punished by his family.

As for lending it to him for a few days, it was no different from giving it to him. As long as young master Yun did not take the initiative to return it, how could Zhou Yuan possibly ask for it?

It was just that the car was still Zhou Yuan’s in name.

Young master Yun nodded with satisfaction, then said,””Go! I’ll take you to Song Wei’s place to say hi!”

After saying that, young master Yun led Zhou Yuan and strode towards Xia ruofei’s direction.

Xia ruofei held the blue – Belt Martell and leaned back on the sofa. The three women were chatting beside him, but he couldn’t interrupt. He just enjoyed the leisure.

Young master Yun walked over with Zhou Yuan and greeted him with a smile,””Wei Wei! When did you return to the capital?”

Song Wei and the other two stopped chatting and looked up.

Song Wei was slightly stunned and said with a hint of surprise,”Ling Yun? Why did you come to the capital?”

Ling Yun, also known as young master Yun, smiled and said,””My dad was transferred to Beijing half a year ago, so I followed him here! It seems that you don’t care about me! I’m sad ...”

Song Wei felt a little awkward.

She wasn’t embarrassed because she didn’t know that Ling Yun had come to Beijing with his father. It was because she wasn’t that close to Ling Yun. However, she wasn’t used to Ling Yun speaking to her as if they were old friends.

Therefore, Song Wei didn’t know how to respond to Ling Yun’s words. She simply gave him an awkward but polite smile.

“Weiwei, I heard that uncle song had an accident some time ago?” Ling Yun asked again. How is it now?”

Song Wei felt a trace of anger in her heart. In principle, news of song Qiming’s incident should be kept under wraps. However, Ling Yun asked such a question in front of so many people, especially when there was a young man she didn’t even know beside Ling Yun.

However, since he had asked about her elder, Song Wei could not be rude. She replied,””I’m fine now. Thank you for your concern ...”

Zhou Yuan, who was standing at the side, saw that Ling Yun had been chatting with song Weila but had no intention of introducing her to him. He couldn’t help but feel anxious.

Ling Yun chatted with song weimo for a while before he pulled Zhou Yuan to his side as if he had just remembered something.”Look at me, I’m so happy to see my old friends that I forgot to introduce them to you. Wei Wei, this is the eldest son of glory world corporation’s director Zhou, Zhou Yuan! Zhou Yuan, this beauty is the one I’ve been telling you about, the Pearl of Southeast’s Secretary song, Song Wei!”

When Xia ruofei heard Ling Yun’s introduction, he couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows. He had just chatted with glory world corporation’s Chairman, Zhou leiyun, at the door. That Zhou leiyun looked like he was in his early forties! She already had a son this old?

Although he didn’t know Zhou Yuan’s age, he looked to be at least 25 or 26 years old. Could it be that Zhou leiyun got married and had children in his teens?

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel curious.

On the other side, Zhou Yuan saw that Ling Yun had finally remembered him. He was on the verge of tears as he hurriedly took two steps forward and extended his hands to Song Wei.”Miss song, it’s a pleasure to meet you!” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Song Wei saw that Zhou Yuan was about to shake hands with her, and she could not help but frown. She took a step back and said,””Young master Zhou, it’s a pleasure to meet you!”

Looking at Song Wei’s calm expression, she did not seem to be pleased at all.

Zhou Yuan was not angry that he did not manage to shake hands with Song Wei. Instead, he took out a gold – stamped business card and handed it over with both hands, saying,””Miss song, this is my name card!”

Song Wei hesitated for a moment, but in the end, she still reached out and took the Kasaya. This was the most basic etiquette. Moreover, it was the opening ceremony of Xia ruofei’s paradise chapter today, and she did not want to make the atmosphere too awkward.

Zhou Yuan saw that Song Wei had accepted his name card and was overjoyed. He rubbed his hands together and said enthusiastically,””Miss song, may I have the honor to have your name card?”

“I’m sorry, Mr. Zhou. I’m still a student. I don’t have a name card!”Song Wei replied.

“Oh! It didn’t matter! It’s fine!” Zhou Yuan quickly said,”then ... Can we add each other on WeChat?”

At the side, Ling Yun couldn’t help but frown. He felt that Zhou Yuan was indeed a little embarrassing. He noticed that the business card that Zhou Yuan gave Song Wei had a layer of gold foil on it. It was real gold, and it was too deliberate to show off his wealth. Furthermore, Song Wei’s attitude was already very cold, yet Zhou Yuan still wanted her contact details. He had no sense of judgment at all.

In this situation, it was impossible to get his contact information by force. Moreover, it would easily cause the other party to be more disgusted.

Ling Yun, who prided himself on having an off – the – charts EQ, definitely wouldn’t be so tactless.
