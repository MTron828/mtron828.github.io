Chapter 615: Crossing acraepoids, young master Song (2)

Although the major hypermarket channels were almost out of stock, the factory still had stock. Xia ruofei had personally made a call and settled the 50 boxes of wine with just a word. Li Jing hurriedly said that he would get someone to prepare the stock and that he could come to collect it at any time.

Xia ruofei hung up the phone and smiled.””Alright! You can just get someone to get a small truck to transport the goods!”

“Alright!” “Thanks!” Song Rui said.

“It’s no big deal, why are you being so polite!” Xia ruofei laughed and scolded.

Song Rui also immediately took out his mobile phone and called the head of the company’s logistics department, asking the company to send a small truck to Ding Feng winery to get the wine.

“It’s not easy for you to come here. Have lunch here! Let us brothers have some too!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

It was almost 11 O’ clock. Song Rui nodded and said,””Alright!”

Xia ruofei picked up the phone on the table and called Feng Jing. After confirming that there was nothing urgent, he packed his bag and said,””Let’s go! Let’s go to my villa!” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

The two of them strolled to the first floor and Xia ruofei went to the staff cafeteria.

It was almost time to get off work, and Cao tieshu’s wife and the other cafeteria staff were nervously preparing food.

Seeing Xia ruofei, the employees quickly greeted him.

Xia ruofei smiled and said to Cao tieshu’s wife,””Sister – in – Law, a friend of mine came today. Can I trouble you to prepare a few dishes for me? I’ll get Lei Hu to send them to the villa later.”

“No problem! Boss, what do you want to eat for lunch?” Cao tieshu’s wife wiped her hands on her apron and asked with a smile.

......

Xia ruofei said,”eat whatever you have!” There was no need to specially prepare. If there were any fresh vegetables in the greenhouse, just pick some, and get one or two meat dishes and a soup! The dishes have to go well with the wine. As for the rest, you can do as you please. I believe in your skills!”

Cao tieshu’s wife said happily,”Alright then! Then I’ll do it according to my own ideas!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it’s been hard on you, sister – in – Law!” Everyone has worked hard ...”

The canteen staff quickly said that it was not hard work. Xia ruofei would thank them every time he came to eat. They had a very good impression of Xia ruofei, the boss who was easy to approach.

After he was done with his business at the canteen, Xia ruofei brought song Rui back to the small villa.

“Sit, sit, sit! I’ll make you some tea!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Do you have any good tea here?” Song Rui picked up a magazine from the coffee table and flipped through it as he spoke.

“Hehe! Why don’t you drink it and you’ll know?” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

He walked to the small cabinet next to the TV background wall and squatted down to open the cabinet with his back facing song Rui. He reached inside and took out a small box of tea leaves. Of course, these tea leaves were actually stored in the spirit map space. Xia ruofei was just putting on an act.

The entire tea set was ready, and Xia ruofei had learned from him. His tea – making movements were methodical.

Very quickly, the rich aroma of tea filled the spacious living room of the villa.

Song Rui, who was looking at the cover girl, sniffled, put down the magazine, and said with a smile,””Woof! Your tea smells pretty good!”

“It’s even more fragrant!” Xia ruofei said with a smile as he placed the tea cup in front of song Rui.

Song Rui suspiciously picked up the teacup and took a sip. He slowly felt it and then called out,””F * ck! Your tea is good! Where did you get it? Give me a few pounds to take away ...”

“PAH!” Xia ruofei said,”I only have three or four taels left and you’re asking for a few catties? why don’t you just go and Rob me?”

“Comrade ruofei! I realized that as your business is getting bigger and bigger, you’re also becoming more and more stingy!” Song Rui said,”we’re brothers. What’s wrong with giving me a few catties of tea leaves?”

“What else? I’ve only given your grandfather two taels!” Xia ruofei said unhappily,”do you know what old Mr. Li Zhifu said about my tea? It’s even better than the mother tree Da Hong Pao!”

Song Rui was also stunned for a moment. As a qualified dandy who was well – versed in the ways of eating, drinking, and having fun, he naturally knew the market price of the mother tree, Da Hong Pao.

Song Rui opened his mouth slightly and said,””What the f * ck ... So, we drank 10000 Yuan in one gulp?”

“You think?” Xia ruofei glanced at song Rui.

Song Rui revealed an excited expression and said,””Then all the more you shouldn’t have kept it to yourself! How could he monopolize such good tea leaves! I have to share it with my brothers!”

“I think you’re just a Locust! You ate mine and took mine after you were done ...”

In the end, the two of them haggled over the price again and song Rui was satisfied that he had cheated Xia ruofei of a tael of tea leaves.

Xia ruofei could not help but feel his heart ache. There were only four taels of tea leaves left. Now that song Rui had taken away one tael, he was left with three taels.

Xia ruofei thought to himself,”before the new tea leaves are out, I will not let anyone else brew the tea. I will keep it for myself!”

Very quickly, Lei Hu brought a veteran to deliver the food made by the canteen.

There were three dishes that were made with the vegetables from the Paradise as the ingredients: a plate of lychee meat, a plate of sweet ‘n’ sour ribs, and a small pot of bamboo sun soup.

Although they were all home – cooked, Cao tieshu’s wife’s cooking skills were still very good. The appearance of these dishes might not be as good as those in the big hotels, but the taste was quite delicious.
