Chapter 1309: I’m not serving you anymore (2)

Translator: 549690339

Feng Rao’s tone turned cold. She snorted and said,”The peach blossom company and the Qian Tang store of Tongren Tang have signed a long – term supply agreement! The party that breached the contract had to bear the responsibility for compensation! However, as long as manager Chen is willing to bear the consequences, we don’t mind! We can stop the supply from next month. As for the penalty, we won’t ask for it for the sake of President Lin!”

Chen shun was stunned. Shouldn’t the other party soften his attitude and plead for mercy immediately? A business that was worth more than ten million a month, and he was going to give it up just like that?

The development of the situation had always been beyond his expectations.

CEO Lin, who had been silent from the beginning, now even had the thought of killing Chen shun. The thing he was most worried about had still happened. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

He was already going crazy from the failure of aweto’s business. At the same time, he was worried that Chen shun would not be able to continue his business if he angered Xia ruofei.

He didn’t expect that before Xia ruofei could make the decision to terminate the cooperation, Chen shun, this idiot, would take the initiative to bring it up. He thought that this would be enough to make paradise Corporation suffer.

Did this guy’s brain get stuck in a door when he was young? President Lin cursed in his heart.

He didn’t even know the most basic situation and dared to represent the headquarters to come and negotiate.

In this Ironhide Kaede fight business, the Paradise company was the one who took the initiative. It was Tongren Hall who was begging the Paradise company to cooperate, okay?

Feng Rao looked at Chen shun coldly and said,”Manager Chen, I’m busy with work here. Since both parties have irreconcilable differences, we won’t keep you. Please!”

Chen shun snorted coldly and stood up abruptly.”This is the first time I’ve seen such an overbearing company! Tongren Hall has tens of thousands of business partners, and it’s useless without your company. You don’t have the channels of Tongren Hall, so I’d like to see who you can sell your medicinal herbs to!”

“We’re not kids anymore, so don’t say such boring words. ” Feng Rao stood up and said,”I have a meeting to attend to. I’ll be leaving now!”

She was extremely disgusted with the purchasing manager sent by the headquarters of Tongren Tang chain. She really didn’t know what the HR department of Tongren Tang did for a living. How could such a person be a manager and be assigned to such an important task?

If they were all like this, then there was no need for this cooperation!

Feng Jing and Liu Qian also left.

CEO Lin gritted his teeth and glared at Chen shun. He stood up without a word and left the meeting room with his people.

After a while, only Chen shun and the purchasing agent he brought were left in the meeting room. There was also an administrative girl who was in charge of tea security. She stood at the side with a vigilant look, as if she was guarding against a thief.

Chen shun’s expression was extremely ugly. He snorted coldly and said, “Let’s go!”

Chen shun and the purchasing Commissioner went downstairs. This time, he had learned his lesson. He rented a car from the city. He didn’t want to walk a long way and then hail a taxi on the National Highway.

Chen shun’s phone rang just as he got into the rented car.

It was his second uncle, Chen Weinan.

“Second uncle!” Chen shun picked up the phone unhappily.

“Chen shun, how’s the negotiation going with the Paradise company?” Chen Weinan asked sternly.

In his opinion, this was a ripened fruit. President Lin had even negotiated the price. Chen shun only needed to go over and pick the fruit gently.

However, his nephew was unreliable, so Chen Weinan was a little worried and called to ask about the situation.

“Second uncle, we didn’t reach an agreement,” Chen shun said.

“What’s going on?” Chen Weinan frowned and asked,”did you work hard or not? Didn’t I tell you that this order is very important to the Tongren Tang chain and to you?”

Chen shun then remembered Chen Weinan’s serious words before he left the capital, and he panicked.

Although he was good at ruining things, he still had a lot of bad ideas. So, he rolled his eyes and immediately said,””Second uncle, you can’t blame me for this! The peach blossom company doesn’t have any sincerity to cooperate at all, and their attitude is very arrogant!”

“The attitude of paradise Corporation is arrogant?” Chen Weinan said doubtfully,”could it be that you didn’t pay attention to your words and angered him?”

“How is that possible?” Chen shun immediately complained,”second uncle, you don’t know this. I rushed here as soon as I got off the plane yesterday, but I didn’t even see a person in charge. They didn’t even receive me. What’s more, this company is in the middle of nowhere. Yesterday, I walked for more than half an hour and stopped a car by the roadside for another half an hour before I finally returned to the city!”

“There’s actually such a thing?” Chen Weinan started to believe it.

“Second uncle, that’s not all!” Chen shun immediately said. They treated Lin Zhongming and his group as guests, but they were indifferent to us. There was obviously something fishy! So, I was smart and suggested to check the goods again, and they immediately turned on me!”

Chen shun continued,”we’ve seen this batch of wormgrass. Although the quality is not bad, Lin Zhongming’s price of 750000 Yuan is obviously too high. If we buy it at this price, we will lose our profit margin!” So, I followed the principle of purchasing and offered a price of 500000 Yuan. I’m also deliberately offering a lower price to leave some room for bargaining!”

Chen Weinan secretly nodded and felt that his nephew had done a good job, so he asked,”And then? How did you guys fall out?”
