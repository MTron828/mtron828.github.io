Chapter 1707: Shocked by the heavens (1)

Translator: 549690339

Not only was Tang Haoran dumbfounded by Li Yifu’s words, but Xia ruofei, Tang Yitian, and Xu Ziyuan were also dumbfounded. They felt as if their world view had been subverted.

A ninety – year – old man was being so respectful to an eight or nine – year – old child, and he even considered himself a junior. Was there anything more shocking than this?

“Grandpa ... Grandpa li ...” Tang Haoran was so scared that he could not even speak properly.

Li Yifu was even more terrified when he heard this and said anxiously,””Martial uncle Tang, please don’t call me that. You’ll embarrass me!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t stand it anymore. He cleared his throat and said,””That ... My adopted husband ...”

Xia ruofei felt a little awkward, but he could not call Li Yifu senior anymore. Otherwise, Li Yifu would really kneel down.

“Senior granduncle, may I ask what instructions you have for me?” Li Yifu quickly asked.

Xia ruofei felt goosebumps all over his body. He said awkwardly,””Well ... Haoran is still so young. It’s not appropriate for him to be your martial uncle, right? Why don’t we ... Discuss our own matters?”

Li Yifu immediately said with a serious face,”martial granduncle, that won’t do!” It’s fine for Yi Tian and Ziyuan to discuss with me, but martial uncle tang can ‘t! He’s your personal disciple and has already gone through the master ceremony. No matter how old he is, he’s still my martial uncle. This seniority can’t be messed up!”

Tang Yitian felt like he was in a dream. Why did his precious son suddenly become the same generation as the Hong sect’s legend, li Jiuzhou? Even Li Yifu had to call him uncle – Master, what was wrong with this world?

Xia ruofei felt very helpless, but there was nothing he could do. He could not really use his authority as a senior granduncle to order Li Yifu around, could he? Moreover, looking at Li Yifu’s expression, he would definitely not agree to such an order.

In the end, he could only say, not knowing whether to laugh or cry,””Alright, alright! I’ll do as you say!”

“Thank you, grand uncle – Master!” Li Yifu quickly said.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and reached into his pocket. He took out a black jade Guan Yu statue from the spirit map space and said,””Please wait a moment!”

Tang Yitian and the others didn’t know what Xia ruofei wanted to do, but even Li Yifu was standing aside with his hands down respectfully. They naturally didn’t dare to ask and just waited obediently.

The statue of black jade that Xia ruofei had taken out was only completed the last time. At that time, he did not have the time to engrave the formation on all the Jade statues. Today’s incident was a coincidence. Suddenly, a Grand – disciple had appeared. He had to express something no matter what!

Everyone present knew about cultivation. Xia ruofei did not intend to hide it and decided to carve the formation on the spot.

He held the Duke Guan Jade statue in one hand, and his other hand gently stroked the surface of the Jade statue. He closed his eyes slightly and quickly entered a state of heart like still water, feeling every vein inside the Jade statue.

After a long while, Xia ruofei opened his eyes. He extended his right index finger and quickly drew on the surface of the Jade.

Tang Yitian and Xu Ziyuan could only watch the show. They didn’t know what special meaning Xia ruofei’s action, which was similar to a Taoist drawing talismans, had.

On the other hand, Tang Haoran was about to break through to Qi disciple Level 2. Although he did not specialize in mental power, he could still sense the majestic mental power that seeped out from Xia ruofei’s fingertips. Thus, he could not help but widen his eyes in curiosity.

As for Li Yifu, his heart was in turmoil. He could clearly feel the strength and precision of the spiritual energy from Xia ruofei’s fingertips. Although he did not know what formation Xia ruofei was drawing, he could still vaguely feel the mysterious lines that were invisible to the naked eye.

Li Yifu stared at Xia ruofei’s movements, afraid to miss any details.

In fact, it would be useless even if he had memorized everything. His spiritual power cultivation had not reached that level, and some fine control could not be learned just by looking at the movements.

Xia ruofei didn’t draw any complicated arrays. He felt that what Li Yifu needed the most was a spirit gathering array. To ordinary cultivators, spirit Qi was the most precious.

Xia ruofei was already familiar with the spirit gathering formation, so he was able to draw it in no time.

When Xia ruofei finished the last stroke, the entire formation was formed.

Li Yifu’s eyes widened as he could feel that the Jade statue of Duke Guan in Xia ruofei’s hand was slowly gathering spiritual energy.

At this moment, Li Yifu was even more shocked by Xia ruofei. Grand uncle – Master was indeed the Grand uncle – Master! He could actually draw a precious spirit gathering array so easily!

Xia ruofei smiled and passed the Guan Gong Jade to Li Yifu.””Foster husband, take it!”

Li Yifu was stunned. He couldn’t believe his ears.”Grand uncle – Master, this ... This is ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Haoran, I can’t let you call me uncle – Master for nothing!” This is his gift to you!”

“How can we do that!” Li Yifu and Tang Yitian said in unison.

Then, Tang Yitian quickly said,””RUO Fei, how can you pay for the meeting gift Haoran gave you?” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”then what do you want little Haoran to give you as a gift?” Did he have any presentable gifts? I’m his master, if I don’t give him a small gift, who will?”

Li Yifu quickly waved his hand and said,”martial granduncle!” This spirit gathering array was too precious! I ... I don’t dare to accept!”
