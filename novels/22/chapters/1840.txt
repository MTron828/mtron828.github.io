Initially, Xia ruofei had planned to let Ling Qingxue find the feeling of joint training before ending her cultivation. However, other than being a little cautious at the beginning, Ling Qingxue quickly entered the state and could be said to be very comfortable with her cultivation.

And as the cultivation progressed, the frequency of their souls would gradually synchronize. The two of them were lovers, and that feeling was even more addictive.

Hence, even Xia ruofei had unknowingly entered a state of selflessness.

When the two of them finished their cultivation, the east side was already showing a hint of white. The two’s first joint cultivation had actually gone on for an entire night.

Even the spiritual crystal that was used for cultivation had lost a bit of its luster.

Xia ruofei himself revealed a strange expression, while Ling Qingxue seemed to be still immersed in the wonderful experience of the joint training and only came back to her senses after a long time.

As the two of them had been practicing together, Xia ruofei did not need to check on her. He knew that Ling Qingxue had steadily crossed the threshold of cultivation after this practice. Her cultivation had officially reached the middle stage of Qi disciple Level 1.

To be able to achieve such an effect in just one day, even if Xia ruofei started from the beginning, under the same conditions, he might not be able to achieve this.

It could be said that Ling Qingxue’s performance had far exceeded Xia ruofei’s expectations.

He stood up and moved his muscles and bones slightly. In fact, this was just his own illusion. When he was cultivating, his true Qi was always flowing in his meridians. It was impossible for him to feel numb in his hands and feet like ordinary people would feel after sitting for a long time.

“Qingxue, well done!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Ling Qingxue was a little embarrassed as she said,””When I was cultivating, that feeling was really wonderful! We’ve been cultivating for the whole night. I feel like it hasn’t been long since I sat down, but it’s almost dawn outside ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”this means that both of us are completely immersed in our cultivation. That’s why we don’t notice the passage of time. This state of cultivation is the best!” I originally planned to let you get used to the joint training first and then rest early, but I didn’t expect you to become very familiar with it so quickly without any process of adaptation!”

Xia ruofei paused and continued,””Now that you’ve officially entered Qi disciple Level 1, it can be said that you’ve already crossed the threshold of cultivation. And with your talent, your future achievements will definitely not be low!”

Ling Qingxue didn’t know that her success was all thanks to Xia ruofei’s hard – earned two bowls of heart – concentrating herbal soup. She was full of confidence and nodded.”Mm! You have to be careful! Maybe I’ll surpass you soon!”

“I’ll be so happy if that day comes!”Xia ruofei laughed.

Then, Xia ruofei said seriously,””Qingxue, from now on, you must take every step steadily and surely. You can’t rush for success. You have outstanding talent. As long as you calm down and build a good foundation, your future will be limitless. You must not overtrain in order to quickly improve your realm. A skyscraper rises from the ground, and the foundation is very important.”

“Mm! I got it!” Ling Qingxue said seriously.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”alright!” The first joint training had ended successfully! Next ... You should take a shower ...”

Ling Qingxue was stunned for a moment, then she looked down slightly and immediately screamed. She jumped up and ran in the direction of the bathroom.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.

Ling Qingxue had just started cultivating, and there were still many impurities in her body that had not been expelled. On top of that, her cultivation had improved by a large margin this time, so she was in the same predicament as last time. A lot of sticky, greasy black impurities were stuck on the surface of her skin, emitting an unpleasant sour smell.

As a beauty who loved cleanliness, how could she endure such a state?

When Ling Qingxue came out of the bathroom, the sky was already bright. She was drying her hair as she asked in distress,””RUO Fei, will it be like this every time you cultivate in the future? This ... Is too disgusting ...” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”don’t worry!” “This is a normal phenomenon. Cultivation is actually a process of constant self – purification and self – improvement. In the past twenty years, your body has accumulated a lot of impurities, so there was a lot of dirt discharged from your body during the first few cultivation sessions. It won’t be so obvious later on. Look at me when I was cultivating, isn’t there nothing wrong?”

“That’s good ...” Ling Qingxue let out a sigh of relief.

Xia ruofei said,”let’s go get something to eat. We won’t cultivate today. We’ll catch up on sleep later!”

“Okay, I’ll listen to you!” Ling Qingxue said.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”by the way, you’re already at Qi disciple Level 1. With your current ability to control your true energy, you should be able to use it well. You can practice it when you’re free.”

“How do I practice?” Ling Qingxue asked in confusion.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I’m just practicing how to control my true energy!” Otherwise, wouldn’t it be a waste if you had superb strength but couldn’t use it when you really needed to fight an enemy? Forget it, I’ll show you!”

With that, Xia ruofei held Ling Qingxue’s hand and walked down the stairs to the villa’s courtyard.
