“Good! Then let’s eat and set off!” Song Qiming said. Then, he turned to Li Yifu and said politely,”old Mr. Li, thank you for your hard work these past two days!”

“You’re too polite! This way, please! Mr. Song.” Li Yifu said.

When they arrived at the dining room, Li Yifu went to the kitchen to bring out the steaming hot breakfast.

After breakfast, they took the elevator to the rooftop.

Xia ruofei immediately released the black Phoenix flying ship, then said to Li Yifu,””Foster husband, if there are no special circumstances, I will return today! I’ll leave the island to you.”

“Please rest assured, martial granduncle!” Li Yifu nodded and said.

“Ruofei, I’ve discussed it with my dad. I’ll stay on the Peach Blossom Island and cultivate,” Song Wei said.

“Aren’t you going to send uncle song off?” Xia ruofei asked in surprise.

“I’ll be back soon after 1 go back anyway. 1 might as well use this time to cultivate!” Song Qiming chuckled and said,”we’ll have plenty of chances to meet in the future. There’s no need to waste five to six hours to send me off!”

“That works too!” Xia ruofei nodded and said,”then you stay here and cultivate. I’ll be back soon!” Don’t worry, I’ll definitely send uncle song home safely!”

“I’m very confident in you! “Song Wei smiled. 1’11 leave my dad to you!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.

Just as Xia ruofei and song Qiming were about to board the black Phoenix flying ship, Zheng Yongshou rushed to the rooftop and said,””Mr. Xia, I would also like to return to the three mountains with you.”

Zheng Yongshou immediately explained,””I’ve been here for almost a month. I need to go back to deal with the daily affairs of the company and the farm. Since you’re going back, I’ll take a ride.”

Xia ruofei rested in his room for a while. The sky was just starting to light up when he heard footsteps coming from the living room. He scanned the room with his spiritual force and saw Song Wei walking out of the room.

Hence, Xia ruofei also stood up and walked out.

“It’s almost time?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

“En!” Song Wei nodded and said,”there’s a time difference of more than three hours between here and China. It’s almost dawn when we set off for Sanshan now. My dad has a meeting in the morning, so he’ll get home early to pack up before he has to go to the municipal Party Committee.”

“Alright! Then let’s go!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”uncle song should still be cultivating.”

The two of them didn’t disturb Ling Qingxue. Instead, they walked out of the room with light footsteps and took the elevator down.

When they arrived at song Qiming’s floor, Xia ruofei scanned the floor with his spiritual power and smiled at Song Wei.””Uncle song is also ready to go. Let’s go!”

The two of them came to song Qiming’s door. Xia ruofei raised his hand and knocked on the door.””Uncle song, I’m RUO Fei!”

“They’re coming!”

Soon, song Qiming opened the door and said with an apologetic look,””RUO Fei, I’m sorry! I’ve wasted a lot of your time coming back and forth, and I’ve troubled you so early in the morning.”

“Uncle song, we’re all family. Why are you being so formal?” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

At this time, Li Yifu also came up from downstairs. He first bowed respectfully to Xia ruofei and then said,””Grand uncle – Master, Mr. Song, miss song, I’ve prepared some breakfast. You can leave after eating!”

“Then let’s have some?” Xia ruofei asked song Qiming with a smile and continued,”don’t worry, we’ll make it in time. We won’t delay your meeting in the morning! There’s a three – hour time difference between here and China!” “Good! Then let’s eat and set off!” Song Qiming said. Then, he turned to Li Yifu and said politely,”old Mr. Li, thank you for your hard work these past two days!”

“You’re too polite! This way, please! Mr. Song.” Li Yifu said.
