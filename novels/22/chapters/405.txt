Chapter 406: A glorious mission (1)

Xia ruofei stopped in his tracks, turned around, and asked with a smile,””Old Mr. Li, what’s the matter?”

“Xiao Xia, I want to bring Ling Yun back to Mount Wu Yi in the next two days.” Li Zhifu said.

Xia ruofei frowned and said,””Mr. Li, your condition has not stabilized yet. You need to continue receiving my Chinese medicine treatment. I’m afraid it’s not appropriate to go back now!”

“Xiao Xia,” li Zhifu said with a bleak expression,”it’s the same whether the illness is treated or not. I’ve thought about it. I think we should go back to Wuyi Mountain!”

Xia ruofei never told li Zhifu about the treatment. He only gave him a dose of Chinese medicine every day. In order to avoid shocking the world, Xia ruofei didn’t add much petal solution into the Chinese medicine. So, li Zhifu’s body was recovering at a slow speed, but he didn’t feel it.

Xia ruofei did not tell li Zhifu that he had the confidence to cure his cancer. On one hand, he had some selfish motives. Li Zhifu would definitely teach ye Lingyun everything he knew under such circumstances. On the other hand, Xia ruofei knew that even if he said it, li Zhifu would probably think that he was comforting him and would not believe him.

Xia ruofei didn’t expect li Zhifu to suddenly want to go back after staying for less than half a month. He didn’t expect it. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Mr. Li, are you not used to living here?” Xia ruofei asked after a moment of silence.

“No, no, little Xia, don’t misunderstand.” Li Zhifu said,”I just feel that since I’m suffering from this illness, there’s no point in staying in Sanshan. People still hope to return to their roots when they’re old. I don’t want to die in a foreign land ...”

Li Zhifu paused for a moment and looked at ye Lingyun, who was clearing the dishes.”Also, considering that Ling Yun has been learning from me for a while, I’m planning to bring him back to Wuyi Mountain. It’s not good to practice with leaves every day here. Furthermore, the key steps will require some special tools. It’s more convenient to go back.”

Hearing this, Xia ruofei was overjoyed. He knew that li Zhifu was going to pass on all his skills to ye Lingyun. This was a good thing!

“Mr. Li, since you’ve said so, I won’t try to persuade you any further. There’s no problem on Ling Yun’s side. I’ve made the decision for him. I’ll be more at ease with him by your side to take care of you.”

“Thank you, Xia!” Li Zhifu said.

Strictly speaking, ye Lingyun was still Xia ruofei’s employee. Li Zhifu also knew that ye Lingyun had always listened to Xia ruofei. If Xia ruofei didn’t agree, he might really refuse to bring ye Lingyun back to Wuyi Mountain.

“I should be the one saying thank you.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”we are very grateful that you are willing to pass on all your knowledge to Ling Yun.”

“Let’s not talk about this. Ling Yun is a smart and hardworking kid. I believe he will pass down my tea – making skills to the next generation,”li Zhifu said with a wave of his hand.

“Definitely!” Xia ruofei nodded.

“Old Mr. Li, it’s best if you inform old song that you’re leaving,” Xia ruofei continued.

“Don’t worry! I’ll talk to little song and he won’t make things difficult for you. ” Li Zhifu said with a smile.

“Thank you, old Mr. Li.” Xia ruofei said,”also, I will brew the Chinese medicine for three days tonight. I will send someone to bring you the medicine every three days. You must take the medicine on time every day.”

Even if Traditional Chinese Medicine was kept in cold storage, it was best not to last more than three days. Otherwise, the medicinal properties might change. Since li Zhifu insisted on going back, Xia ruofei could only use this stupid method. Fortunately, Sanshan city was not far from Wuyi Mountain. A one – way trip would take about two hours. Now that Hong Tao and Lei Hu were at the farm, it was not too troublesome to send someone to deliver the medicine every three days.

“I don’t think it’s necessary, Xiao Xia,” said li Zhifu with a smile. That’s too much trouble for you. Besides, you know that my illness ...”

“Mr. Li, this is my only request. If you can’t do it, I can’t let you leave.” Xia ruofei said seriously,”and you don’t have to be so pessimistic. Although your condition is a little tricky, you’re not in despair yet. I’m confident in treating colon cancer with Chinese medicine.”

Li Zhifu thought that Xia ruofei was just trying to comfort him. He smiled bitterly and said,””Okay, little Xia, I promise you.”

“I’ll get Ling Yun to supervise your daily intake of medicine. ” Xia ruofei smiled and said half – jokingly,”you can’t go against my words!”

“I’ll definitely follow the doctor’s advice!”Li Zhifu laughed.

Xia ruofei nodded and beckoned ye Lingyun over. He said,””Ling Yun, hand over the work on hand to Lei Hu tomorrow, then accompany old Mr Li back to Wuyi Mountain.”

“Ah, brother Xia, what about the farm if I leave?” ye linyun asked.

Xia ruofei laughed and scolded,”you really think the earth won’t spin without you?” “Don’t worry about the farm. I’ll give you two tasks. The first is to take good care of old Mr. Li and make sure he takes his medicine on time every day. The second is to learn from old Mr. Li. You’re not allowed to return to the three mountains until old Mr. Li says you can finish your apprenticeship. Do you understand?”
