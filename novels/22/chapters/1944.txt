1945 The difference between heaven and earth (2)

“That’s really tiring!” Xia ruofei said,”rest early today! You’ll be officially taking over the job tomorrow!”

Wu Liqian smiled and said,”it might be difficult for others to do this job, but it’s not a challenge for me!” Don’t tell me you’re going to set up an obstacle for me?”

“Hahaha! That’s hard to say! This is business!” Xia ruofei laughed carefreely.”You represent the Changping County government, and I represent the peach blossom company. We’re on different sides!”

“How could it be different?” Wu Liqian also laughed.”This is a win – win cooperation, okay? We’re all on the same side!”

“Woof! She’s already in working mode! “Sure ...” Xia ruofei said.

Wu Liqian couldn’t help but giggle. After teasing Xia ruofei for a while, she felt more relaxed.

After chatting for a while, Wu Liqian said,””Ruofei, Secretary Zeng and County Head Zhu went to the airport to pick us up today. I was shocked when I walked out of the passage!”

“There’s such a thing?” Xia ruofei was also surprised.

“Isn’t that so?” Wu Liqian said,”and when we had supper at night, the two leaders were very polite and kept toasting me. To be honest, I was a little flattered! Ruofei, I feel like something’s not right. This doesn’t seem like their style!” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Hi!” What are you thinking about? Perhaps they were placing too much importance on the Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory project. This was called treating the wise with respect. Who asked you to be the key person in bringing in this project? Sister Qian, although you’re in Beijing, I’m sure you’re aware of the situation in Changping County. Secretary Zeng and County Head Zhu are in urgent need of a big project to strengthen their hearts! At present, they were in a very passive situation! You’re helping them when they’re in need, so it’s only right that they be polite to you!”

After Wu Liqian heard this, she smiled and said,””Mm! I don’t want to think too much about it. I’ll try to get this job done as soon as possible, and then I have to go back to Beijing for training!”

“You’re going back?” Xia ruofei said,”Liu haojun has already left. You ...”

“This is a formal training class, and the standards are so high. You can’t just quit if you want to! Moreover, the teaching professors were all of high standards! How can we waste such a rare learning opportunity?” Wu Liqian said.

“Alright then!” Xia ruofei said,”you’re a good kid who loves to study!”

……

The next morning, Wu Liqian, who was exhausted from the journey, did not follow Zeng jianzhang’s instructions to rest at home. Instead, she came to the office early.

Regarding the Tao Yuan pharmaceutical factory project, a Task Force had been set up in Changping County. As the person – in – charge of this Task Force, Wu Liqian gathered everyone for a meeting on the first day she returned to work.

In the past, Wu Liqian’s prestige had plummeted because of Liu haojun’s various constraints. Everyone looked at her with contempt.

But this time, everything had returned to normal. Everyone even looked at them with more respect. It was no secret that Zeng jianzhang and Zhu zhihang had personally gone to pick them up and waited at the airport for more than two hours. Almost everyone in the agency knew about it.

What’s more, Liu haojun, who had always been against Wu Liqian, had left with his tail between his legs. Wu Liqian had taken a step further and firmly held the project that everyone was drooling over in her hands. Her authority was immediately different, and everyone could not help but respect her.

The task force was made up of elite personnel, including the director of the government office, Shi Qingyuan, who was the Deputy Team Leader of the task force and assisted Wu Liqian in handling some specific Affairs.

Wu Liqian mobilised everyone and divided the work. Some were in charge of coordination, some were in charge of communication, and some were in charge of logistics support, etc.

At the end of the meeting, Wu Liqian said,””Director Shi, contact the Paradise Corporation immediately after the meeting. I hope to have our first business meeting with them today!”

“Alright, County Head Wu!” Shi Qingyuan said,”however, it might not be so easy to talk to the peach blossom company. We’ve been rebuffed a lot before. Even though President Xia has given us a heads up this time, we can’t expect them to be very efficient. ”

Wu Liqian frowned slightly. She had not even started work, and she was already discouraged. How was she going to progress in the future?

She said indifferently,”you’ll be in charge of contacting them!” Report to me immediately if you encounter any difficulties!”

“Alright!” Shi Qingyuan said lazily.

It wasn’t that he had anything against Wu Liqian. In fact, he was a little uncomfortable with the peach blossom company’s attitude. He had been rebuffed by Xia ruofei last time.

To Shi Qingyuan’s surprise, when he contacted the peach blossom company, they immediately became much more enthusiastic when they heard that he was from Changping County and that it was Wu Liqian who asked him to contact them.

When Shi Qingyuan mentioned that he hoped to meet with the Paradise Corporation today to discuss the specific investment matters, the company agreed without much hesitation. The time was set at around 10 am, and it was not to go to the Paradise pharmaceutical factory, but to the company’s headquarters, the Paradise building.

Calculating the time, it should be just right for him to leave Changping and drive to the Taoyuan building in the city.

Shi Qingyuan quickly reported the situation to Wu Liqian.

“Let’s go now!”Wu Liqian said immediately.

After a while, a Buick junyue and a Buick minivan drove out of the government compound one after another and headed toward the city.

At the peach blossom mansion.

When Shi Qingyuan got out of the car, his eyes almost fell out of their sockets. He saw the chairman of paradise Corporation, Xia ruofei, standing at the entrance of the building, waiting with a smile on his face.

After seeing Wu Liqian, Xia ruofei even took the initiative to greet her and said very politely,””Mayor Wu! Welcome, welcome! I was wondering why I heard the chirping of Magpies today! So it’s an important guest!”

Shi Qingyuan could not help but think,”you’re on the 15th floor, can you hear the Magpies?”

He thought of the scene when he accompanied Zhu zhihang to visit here yesterday.

They almost couldn’t even enter the door! Not only did Xia ruofei not welcome them personally, but he also made them wait in the reception room for more than an hour. In the end, they talked for more than 20 minutes.

It was really infuriating to compare people! The difference in treatment before and after was too great!

Wu Liqian felt warm inside when she saw Xia ruofei’s bright smile. She took a step forward and said,”President Xia! Hello there!”

“Everyone, please come in!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”today, I’ve gathered factory manager Xue and the two experts he invited. We can have a good talk about the investment!”

Then, Xia ruofei said,”Oh right, I’ve already booked a private room at the Ling Ji private kitchen. I think it’s almost lunchtime after the discussion. County Head Wu, how about giving me a chance to treat everyone to a meal?”

“Mr. Xia, we should be the ones treating!” Wu Liqian said with a smile.

“It’s the same no matter who’s treating!” Xia ruofei said,”it’s decided then! Come, County Head Wu, please come in!”

In the working group, other than Shi Qingyuan, there were two other people who had accompanied Zhu zhihang here the day before. When they saw this scene, they were also shocked.

Xia ruofei personally brought Wu Liqian and the others to the meeting room. On the Paradise corporation’s side, Xue Jinshan, the two experts invited from outside the pharmaceutical factory, as well as Feng Jing, Dong Yun, and the others were already waiting in the meeting room.

Seeing this, Shi Qingyuan felt that there might be a chance.

Xia ruofei was planning to talk to the people from Changping County personally. He had been rather cold to them yesterday and had directly kicked the ball to the pharmaceutical factory. Today, Wu Liqian was the one who came, and the standard was immediately different.

As expected, after everyone was seated, Xia ruofei said,””County Head Wu, everyone here is quite familiar with each other, so I won’t introduce you. Let’s get straight to the point! I want to hear what kind of preferential treatment and support measures can Changping County give us if the Tao Yuan pharmaceutical factory project is located in Changping?”
