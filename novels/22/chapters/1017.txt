Chapter 1018: A one – headed abalone’s stunning appearance (2)

Translator: 549690339

Then, with a thought, Xia ruofei took out the thirty dried abalones from the space, wrapped them with his spiritual power, and placed them one by one into the car refrigerator.

Fortunately, the refrigerator in the car was large enough, and the dried abalones were almost full.

Xia ruofei used his spiritual power to close the door of the car’s refrigerator. Throughout the entire process, he had been multitasking, driving while completing the task. However, as a cultivator with Qi disciple Level 4 and spiritual power at the spirit palpitate stage, multitasking was child’s play. It was not difficult at all.

After the dried abalone was placed in the refrigerator, Xia ruofei focused on driving. Soon, the three cars arrived at Taoyuan farm.

At the entrance, Xia ruofei told the veteran on duty to guide Guo Song to the small villa when he arrived.

After entering the farm, Xia ruofei moved the dried abalones from the car refrigerator in the back row into the spirit map space. When the car refrigerator was turned on to quick – freeze mode, the temperature of the abalones had completely dropped. There was even a layer of white ice crystals on the surface of the sealed bag.

He kept these dried abalones in the stone chamber in the mountain sea realm. If he left them in the Archean realm, due to the time flow being 30 times faster, they would probably return to normal temperature before he could take them out of the villa.

As long as it was related to the secret of the spirit map space, Xia ruofei would be extremely careful. In his opinion, there was no need to be overly cautious.

The three cars stopped in the yard of the small villa. When Blackie, lightning, and the others saw so many strangers, they immediately became vigilant and made low muffled sounds.

Xia ruofei quickly scolded them and told them that they were his own people. Only then did Blackie and the rest return to their lazy state.

“Ruofei, your dogs are pretty good!” Tang He said with a smile.

Xia ruofei laughed.”It’s a guard. It’s not a rare breed.”

Tang He said,”I can tell that these are Chinese Garden dogs, but they’re as fierce as some big, fierce dogs!” And it was very human – like! I didn’t expect you to be so good at raising dogs ...”

Xia ruofei said humbly. At this time, Hu Zi’s mother heard the sound of a car and opened the door of the villa. When she saw a large group of people in the courtyard, she couldn’t help but be stunned for a moment before asking,””Ruofei, you have guests?”

Xia ruofei quickly introduced Tang He and Hu Zi’s mother.

Tang He knew that this was Xia ruofei’s godmother, so he was very polite.

After exchanging a few pleasantries, Hu Zi’s mother invited Tang He into the house. She saw Tang He’s assistant and bodyguards standing in the courtyard, each carrying out their own duties. She couldn’t help but say,””Ruofei, let the guests into the house!”

“They can just wait outside. It’s too much of a bother for so many people to go in ...” Tang He said with a smile.

“There’s no reason for guests to stand outside the door,” Hu ‘Zi’s mother said.”Let’s all go in and have a cup of tea!”

Tang He declined, but he could not resist Hu Zi’s mother’s enthusiasm. He could only signal his two assistants to come in with him, while the bodyguards stayed in the yard to guard the place.

When Hu Zi’s mother heard that the big men were in charge of security, she couldn’t help but feel speechless. However, she didn’t insist on letting them in.

When they arrived at the living room, Hu Zi’s mother immediately made tea for everyone and served them peanuts, melon seeds, fruits, and other things.

“Please have a seat, Mr. Tang. I’ll go get the things,” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

In the kitchen of the villa, there was a huge double – door refrigerator. However, Xia ruofei could not take out the abalones from the inside because Hu Zi’s mother was in charge of cooking during the summer break. Naturally, she was in charge of the refrigerator as well. She knew more about the things inside than Xia ruofei. If Xia ruofei took out thirty dried abalones from the refrigerator, Hu Zi’s mother would be the first to notice that something was wrong.

Fortunately, there was a small refrigerator in Xia ruofei’s big bedroom upstairs. In the summer, there was a freezer compartment for drinks and the like.

Hence, Xia ruofei went straight upstairs and locked the door when he reached his bedroom. He took out the dried abalones from the spirit map space and packed them in two large paper bags. He waited for a minute or two before he went downstairs with the paper bags. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

When he heard Xia ruofei’s footsteps coming down the stairs, Tang He’s expectant gaze was already cast over.

Xia ruofei put the paper bag on the coffee table in front of Tang He with a smile and said,””Mr. Tang, this is the dried abalone our company is going to auction.”

Tang He stood up immediately and picked up a sealed dried abalone from the paper bag eagerly.

After being frozen all the way, the dried abalone felt very cold to the touch, but Tang He didn’t feel it at all. He just stood there in a daze, his eyes revealing an extremely shocked expression.

The dried abalone in Tang He’s hand had already exceeded the standard of a one – Head abalone. It was bigger than his palm and felt heavy in his hand like a piece of lead.

Holding such a huge abalone in his hands was quite a visual impact.

Even Hu Zi’s mother and Tang He’s two assistants could not help but widen their eyes.

“Ruofei, this ... This abalone is too big!” Hu Zi’s mother could not help but say.

Hu Zi’s mother had lived in a small fishing village by the sea for most of her life. In the past, Hu Zi’s father often went out to sea to fish, and Hu Zi’s mother often came into contact with all kinds of sea products. However, this was the first time she had seen such a huge abalone.

Xia ruofei smiled.”Godma, this abalone is a heart – warming product that our company is preparing to launch. It’s mainly targeted at the high – end seafood market.”

Hu Zi’s mother didn’t really understand what Xia ruofei said, but at least she knew that the best dried abalone was produced by Xia ruofei’s company, so she couldn’t help but feel happy.

At this time, Tang He came back to his senses and looked at the two big bulging paper bags. He couldn’t help but ask,””Ruofei, have all the dried abalones here reached this standard?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I have 30 dried abalones here. About 25 of them are above the standard of a one – headed abalone. Unfortunately, the other five are only a few grams to a dozen grams short. They can only be considered super large two – headed abalones.”

Tang He put down the dried abalone in his hand and immediately looked through the two paper bags. He found that Xia ruofei was not lying. Each of the abalones was more than the size of a palm, and each of them was very heavy.

Tang He felt that his understanding had been subverted. Since when could one – headed abalones, which were hard to find, appear in batches?

After a long while, Tang He said with a bitter smile,””RUO Fei, you’re really a man who can create miracles! If you can’t succeed in the agricultural products industry, I can’t think of anyone else who can succeed!”

“Mr. Tang, you’re too kind ...” Xia ruofei smiled and said humbly.

At this moment, the communication device in the hall rang.”Brother Xia, Mr. Guo from Hengfeng group has arrived!”

Xia ruofei walked over and took a look at the image on the LCD screen. It was the old soldier on duty at the entrance, standing outside the villa’s courtyard with two people in suits and leather shoes. They should be Guo Song and his colleagues.

Xia ruofei and Tang He set off from the warehouse in the city, which was similar to the journey from Guo song’s hotel to Taoyuan farm, so they arrived almost at the same time.

Xia ruofei immediately opened the villa door and shouted,””Mister Guo! Please come in!”

The two of them immediately walked into the courtyard. With Xia ruofei personally welcoming them, Tang He’s bodyguards naturally would not stop Guo Song and his wife.

One of the men, who was about 45 or 46 years old, said enthusiastically from afar,””You must be Mr. Xia! I’m Guo Song from Hengfeng group’s seafood trading company, and this is my colleague, Luo Jiahao from Hengfeng auction house!”

“Welcome, welcome. Please come in!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

After he shook hands with Guo Song and Luo Jiahao, he stepped aside and invited them into the villa.

Guo Song walked into the living room, and his eyes suddenly fell on the one – headed abalone that Tang He had just placed on the coffee table. He suddenly stared at the dried abalone and couldn’t speak for a long time, as if he had been frozen.
