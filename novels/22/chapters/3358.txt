When Ling Qingxue saw Xia ruofei descending from the sky on his flying sword, she was stunned for a moment. Then, not only did she not look happy, but she also took a step back warily and stared at Xia ruofei with a slight frown.

Xia ruofei was slightly stunned. He walked towards Ling Qingxue and said,””Qingxue, what’s wrong? Don’t be afraid, it’s fine! I’ll be by your side to protect you from now on, so you’re safe!”

Ling Qingxue looked at Xia ruofei. Suddenly, without a word, she summoned her flying sword and stabbed it towards Xia ruofei.

Naturally, Xia ruofei was not on guard. Fortunately, Ling Qingxue was only a Qi refining cultivator. Although she could use her flying sword to attack, she could only use her spiritual power to draw the flying sword and stab it at Xia ruofei. Moreover, her spiritual power was very weak, so the speed of the flying sword was very slow to Xia ruofei.

He dodged it with ease and used his mental power to bind the flying sword and throw it to the ground.

Xia ruofei’s expression changed and he called out in concern,””Qingxue, what’s wrong? What had happened? Why are you attacking me?”

Ling Qingxue snorted and said,””Don’t waste your time! You can’t fool me with this trick! In this Tower of Trials, everyone had to deal with all the quests alone. How could RUO Fei be here? Don’t think that you can confuse me by changing to a different illusionary realm and creating a ruofei flying here!”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.”Qingxue, you’re not thinking of me as your inner demon, are you? This ... How could there be such a realistic illusion!”

Ling Qingxue pouted and said,”continue making up stories!” You’ve already used RUO Fei’s image once! How can I fall for it again if you use it again?”

Xia ruofei thought for a moment and asked,”Qingxue, you can’t be thinking that you’re still on the third level of the Tower of Trials, right?” Eh? So you were already on the third floor of the Tower of Trials before you were sent here? That’s pretty fast!”

Xia ruofei had been breaking all the records and completing all the missions. It could be said that his speed was very fast. Looking at Ling Qingxue’s performance, she should have already experienced the illusion on the third level of the Tower of Trials. That was why she was suspicious of Xia ruofei’s appearance.

With Ling Qingxue’s cultivation level, it was already considered very fast for her to reach the third level so quickly.

Of course, Xia ruofei also knew that Ling Qingxue was in the Qi refining stage, which meant that the difficulty of the mission would be reduced. However, the fact that she was able to reach the third level so quickly showed that Ling Qingxue’s performance was outstanding.

Ling Qingxue frowned slightly and looked at Xia ruofei.””What do you mean? Don’t try to fool me! What teleportation? Didn’t he just change the illusion? Don’t think that I don’t understand!”

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly.”Qingxue, stop fooling around ... You’re no longer on the third level of the Tower of Trials. This is the training space on the fourth level.”

“This is impossible!” Ling Qingxue said firmly.

“Was your previous mission to kill the Mirage beast?” Xia ruofei said,”if I’m not wrong, it should be a beginner – Level Mirage beast, right?”

“So what?” Ling Qingxue nodded.

Xia ruofei said,”you must have been teleported here for more than ten hours, right?” Have you met a Mirage beast before?”

Ling Qingxue also showed a trace of hesitation. It was just as Xia ruofei had said. She had been searching non – stop for more than ten hours, but all she could see was the monotonous wilderness. She did not even meet a Mirage beast, let alone a Mirage beast. She did not even meet a living ant. It was as if she was the only one left in the world.

Xia ruofei understood what was going on the moment he saw Ling Qingxue’s expression. He smiled and said,””Also, didn’t you notice that you didn’t encounter any danger in the past ten hours?”

Ling Qingxue did not say anything. However, after Xia ruofei’s reminder, she did notice that she had not encountered any danger or attack in the past ten hours. She had just been walking alone in the vast wilderness.

Xia ruofei continued,”also, do you know why I found you?” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

At this point, he took out a piece of yellow jade essence from his bag and showed it to Ling Qingxue. He then said,””Did you just find this kind of crystal?”

Ling Qingxue took a look and said in surprise,””How did you know?”

Xia ruofei smiled.”This thing is called the yellow jade essence. It’s because you excavated this yellow jade essence that I was able to determine your location. Then, I immediately rushed over to meet you.”

Ling Qingxue saw that Xia ruofei’s words were logical and could not help but waver.

Xia ruofei continued,”Qingxue, you’re actually already on the fourth level of the Tower of Trials ...”

“This is impossible! I didn’t even complete the third level of the Tower of Trials, and I didn’t find the entrance to the fourth level, so how could I suddenly go to the fourth level?” Ling Qingxue immediately shouted.

Xia ruofei said,”it’s a long story, but time is of the essence. I’ll make it short!” When I was on the third floor of the Tower of Trials, because I broke the record of the mission, I received an additional reward, which is to teleport one of my companions to the same small trial space as me. I’ve always wanted to meet you as soon as possible, so I gave up on other more attractive conditions and chose this reward. It looks like my luck is pretty good. I actually ran into one with a one in eight chance!”

Xia ruofei did not mention that he had already chosen this reward on the second level of the Tower of Trials and was sent to the same trial space as Shen tianfang. Later on, because Shen tianfang was tempted by the money, Xia ruofei even planned to kill him before he could do anything.

The reason why he didn’t say anything wasn’t because he didn’t trust Ling Qingxue. It was just that the fewer people who knew about this, the better. Otherwise, if one day someone accidentally let it slip, it would be a big deal.

“Really?” Ling Qingxue asked.

Xia ruofei said,”why Would I Lie to You?” Besides, how could you mistake me for your inner demon? How can the inner demon be as handsome as me?”

Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but burst out laughing.””I didn’t expect you to be so smug!”

Xia ruofei said,”Qingxue, we have more than an hour left before we’ll be transported out of the trial space on the fourth level. In this one hour, we need to collect as much of this Topaz essence as possible ...”

“Are you really RUO Fei?” Ling Qingxue asked suspiciously.

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly and said,”if you don’t believe me ... How about this?” Use your spiritual power to investigate the interior of the yellow jade essence. ”

“What do you do with this?” Ling Qingxue nodded.

“You don’t have to worry about that, just do as I say!” Xia ruofei said.

“Alright, I’ll try it!” As Ling Qingxue spoke, she picked up the yellow jade essence and used her mental power to probe inside.

As expected, Ling Qingxue’s spiritual power also began to increase significantly, and the speed of increase was even faster than Xia ruofei ‘s.

Ling Qingxue was so shocked that she almost threw out the yellow jade Spirit.

Fortunately, she managed to control herself at the first moment. She clenched the yellow jade essence tightly in her hand and continued to absorb the energy inside. She only stopped when the yellow jade essence had been completely absorbed and turned into fragments, her face full of surprise.

“How is it?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

“What is this?” Ling Qingxue was shocked.”Why is my spiritual power growing so fast?”

“This is the yellow jade essence that is unique to the trial Pagoda’s fourth floor.” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I’m guessing that the trial Pagoda’s fourth level doesn’t have any real stages. This level is a reward for cultivators who have passed the first three stages, so there shouldn’t be any danger at all.”

Xia ruofei paused and continued,””Qingxue, we only have about an hour left. I must collect as much Topaz essence as possible! Because it’ll be too difficult to find a treasure that can increase one’s spiritual power so quickly in the future!”
