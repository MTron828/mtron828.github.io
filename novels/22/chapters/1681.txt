Chapter 1682: Unexpected fan – in – arms (2)

Xia ruofei nodded and said,””No problem!”

Tony continued,”also ... After the preliminary investigation is completed, we will hold a press conference to release some information to the public. Mr. Xia, do you need to keep your identity a secret?”

“I would like to keep it a secret, but there’s no point ...” Xia ruofei said with a bitter smile.

Tony raised his eyebrows in confusion. Xia ruofei turned on his phone and showed Tony and Alex a Weibo post.

“This matter has already spread like wildfire in the country,” he said.”Even my photos have been exposed ... So, there’s no need to keep my personal information a secret.”

Tony laughed and said,”understood!” Mr. Xia, you’ve made a great contribution to Quto, and we’ll work on a reward plan as soon as possible! Whether it’s you, Mr. Xia, or the rest of the crew, you will all be handsomely rewarded!” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”thank you in advance!”

There was no need to be pretentious with this kind of money. It was an international practice. The domestic reward for the successful disposal of specially hired crew was in the millions. Furthermore, it was foreign money. Xia ruofei had no psychological pressure with it.

“We should be the ones saying thank you!” Tony said with a smile, then picked up the tea cup and drank it in one gulp. He stood up and said,”Mr. Xia, we won’t disturb your rest anymore! If you need anything, please contact Alex. Please try to stay in the hotel tomorrow morning, because the investigation team might come to you to understand the situation!”

“OK!”Xia ruofei also stood up and sent the two of them out.

......

Not long after Xia ruofei returned to his room, Feng Rao came to look for him after a nap.

As soon as they entered, Feng Rao said with a smile,””Ruofei, you’re an internet celebrity now!”

“Don’t tell me you didn’t sleep and spent the whole afternoon on Weibo!”Xia ruofei said gloomily.

“How is that possible?” Feng Jing replied,”I just took a look after I woke up. Weibo, WeChat public account, WeChat moments, your handsome photos are everywhere!”

In reality, Feng Rao didn’t really sleep well. Although she was physically and mentally exhausted, she kept dreaming about the terrifying scene in the sky. She kept experiencing the feeling of weightlessness in her dreams, and when she woke up, she was covered in sweat.

“Is this considered bad news spreading far and wide?” Xia ruofei smiled bitterly.

“How can it be a bad thing?” Feng Rao giggled.”Even if it was bad, it’s all good now, isn’t it?”

Feng Rao was scrolling through Weibo on her phone as she spoke, and she couldn’t help but burst out laughing.

“What’s wrong again?” Xia ruofei could not help but ask.

He had been leeched on by countless people in the afternoon, and now he had a little phobia, afraid that something would happen again.

Feng Rao laughed as she said,”you didn’t stay idle in the afternoon either!” He even recorded a video of Dong Yun and the others? Look at the comments on this Weibo, it’s so funny ...”

Xia ruofei then remembered the video. He had wanted to call Guanping to ask, but he had forgotten about it when Tony and Alex came to visit.

Xia ruofei quickly took out his phone and opened Weibo. He wanted to see if Guan Ping and the others had deleted the video and posted it.

However, when he opened it, the video was still the same video, but there were already thousands of comments.

“What’s going on ...” Xia ruofei mumbled to himself.

He pulled down the page and saw the comments from the netizens. He almost spat out a mouthful of blood.

When everyone saw Xia ruofei’s embarrassment in the video, they happily left comments on Weibo.

“Hahaha! President Xia is too cute! Does this count as a forced advertisement failure?”

“The Lun family just wants to focus on recording a video, why is it so difficult? Can’t you guys wait for me to finish reading the advertisement?”

“Pfft ... How big is President Xia’s psychological trauma?”

“I’m finished, I’m finished. I’ve become a fan of President Xia!”

“Circle of fans +1”

“Is it really good for you to do this for the operation of paradise Corporation? Boss’s image has been ruined by you guys! Can’t you edit this video? In response to your lazy behavior, I only have four words to say: Well done!”

“Wahaha! Paradise corporation’s operations girl wants to add chicken legs!”

......

Xia ruofei was a little dumbfounded. The effect of this broken video was surprisingly good. He casually flipped through it and saw a few comments from “passerby” who had turned into fans.

Moreover, the netizens were quite happy. Some people even cut out moving pictures from the last part of the video and added the words “baby’s heart is bitter” to make an emoji package.

Feng Rao had also finished watching the video. She was rolling around on the sofa while clutching her stomach and laughing.”RUO Fei, your image is completely ruined!”

Xia ruofei snorted and said,”it must be Guanping’s idea!” He even promised me that he would edit it well! I actually believed it ...”

Xia ruofei became more and more depressed as he thought about it. He couldn’t help but say,””No, I have to call him back and give him a good scolding!”

“No, no, no!” Feng Rao quickly stopped him. I think the effect is quite good! This was Guan Ping’s idea? I’ll reward him when we get back!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but roll his eyes and said,””Sister che, do you like to go against me that much?”

Feng Rao said with a serious face,”I’m just stating the facts!” This was the operation rule of new media. Everyone was tired of the aesthetic appreciation of serious things, and sometimes they needed to win by surprise! Also, didn’t you realize that your image immediately became very down – to – Earth? Even though everyone is laughing at you, they definitely won’t feel distant anymore!”

“You guys can do whatever you want ...” Xia ruofei said gloomily. Then, he couldn’t help but Mutter,”you guys don’t take me seriously ...”

“That’s enough!”Feng Rao laughed. Don’t take advantage of me! Everyone is trying to create a brand new image for you! Let’s not talk about this anymore. Since we’re already out, we should trust our colleagues in China. Let them do what they need to do and don’t always point fingers at them! You said it yourself!”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. He shook his head while fiddling with his phone.

“What are you doing?” Feng Rao asked. Are we really going to call Guanping and give him a good scolding?”

Xia ruofei said unhappily,”I’m hungry!” Can I call the front desk to deliver the food?”

“Use the landline to make an internal call!” “So stupid!” Feng Rao said.

Xia ruofei was a little embarrassed and said,””I’ve been so angry that I’m muddled!”

......

The next morning, Alex came to Xia ruofei’s room and asked him to go to the investigation team to cooperate with them.

The investigation team was also staying at Kaiyue hotel and had rented a conference room.

When Xia ruofei followed Alex to the meeting room, there were already more than 20 people sitting there. The moment he entered, all eyes fell on him.

Many people were curious, but even more were in disbelief.

Xia ruofei also saw a few yellow – skinned and black – haired faces.

When they saw Xia ruofei, they immediately went up to him and introduced themselves in Chinese.””Hello, President Xia! We are staff from the safety investigation Department of the China civil administration. We are also participating in the investigation of this incident! My surname is li, and I’m the leader of the team this time!”

“Hello, director li!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

He didn’t know this person’s official position, but he thought that it shouldn’t be wrong to call him a director. The most common title in the country was director, from the small to the Ministry and even the Deputy state level.

“Hello, director Xia!” Director li greeted with a smile. You’ve brought glory to Huaxia this time! Before we left, chief Xue of the headquarters specifically asked us to convey his greetings to you!”

Xia ruofei didn’t know chief Xue, but he still said politely,””Thank you, thank you!”

After the small talk, director Li said,”The basic course of the incident is very clear, and you’re not a professional pilot. They won’t make things difficult for you in terms of technical details, so you just have to relax and describe what happened to them. If you feel uncertain, you can refuse to answer. There’s no harm in being careful!”
