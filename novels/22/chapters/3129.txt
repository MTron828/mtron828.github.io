Chapter 3130 A bold test (1)

The group of them sat down in the living room of the villa. Xia ruofei then introduced them,””Brother Chen, this is Ling Qingxue and this is Song Wei. They are both my ... Dao companions!”

Ling Qingxue and Song Wei didn’t expect Xia ruofei to introduce them so directly. They blushed.

Chen Xuan wasn’t surprised at all. In the world of cultivation, it wasn’t uncommon for powerful cultivators to have multiple Dao companions. Of course, there were also cultivators who spent their entire lives alone, and there were also those who only had one Dao companion. Even if their Dao companion had fallen, they would never be willing to remarry. For example, his father, Chen Nanfeng.

In any case, although it wasn’t common for a cultivator to have multiple Dao companions in the world of cultivation, it was still considered a normal phenomenon. At least, it wouldn’t attract as much condemnation as in the secular world.

Xia ruofei immediately turned to Ling Qingxue and Song Wei and said,””This is the young sect master of the first heaven sect I told you about, brother Chen Xuan. He’s already an early golden core cultivator at such a young age. He’s also from a famous sect, so his future is limitless!”

“Brother Xia,” Chen Xuan said with a bitter smile,”ever since you’ve appeared in the world of cultivation, the words ‘young and promising’ no longer fit me, right?”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.””In terms of the lifespan of Aurous core stage cultivators, brother Chen and I are of the same age.”

Ling Qingxue and Song Wei couldn’t help but feel honored when they saw the young sect master of the number one sect in the cultivation world praising Xia ruofei. They couldn’t help but cover their mouths and laugh.

Chen Xuan turned to Song Wei and Ling Qingxue and said,””Hello, my two sisters – in – Law, don’t believe brother Xia’s flattering words. I only entered the Golden core stage a few years earlier than others by relying on the cultivation resources provided by my family. I believe that with brother Xia’s support, the two of you won’t be any older than me when you step into the Golden core stage. ”

“Sect leader Chen is too humble. RUO Fei has been praising you in front of us!” Song Wei said with a smile. They say you’re the leader of the younger generation in the world of cultivation. ”

Chen Xuan waved his hand and replied,”I don’t deserve it!” I don’t dare! By the way, sister – in – Law can just call me by my name or brother Chen like brother Xia. Calling me young sect Master Chen is really too distant. ”

“Greetings, brother Chen!” Song Wei and Ling Qingxue said in unison.

Chen Xuan nodded his head with a smile. After a moment of silence, he said,””My two sisters – in – Law, I didn’t prepare any gifts for our first meeting in advance. I got these two headwear when I explored the ancient cultivator ruins last time. Take it as a meeting gift for you!”

With that, Chen Xuan flipped his hand and took out two exquisite head accessories from his storage ring. He then handed them over to Song Wei and Ling Qingxue.

One of the two headdress was in the shape of a Phoenix with its wings spread, and the other was in the shape of a delicate and beautiful jade Orchid. They moved and stopped, but they were both lifelike. Furthermore, the material looked very special. It was neither gold nor Jade. It had a metallic texture, but it also had the clarity and luster of Jade. It was clearly not made of materials commonly seen in the secular world.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“This ...” Song Wei and Ling Qingxue looked at each other and then turned to look at Xia ruofei.

They did not know if they should accept Chen Xuan’s gift, so they left the decision to Xia ruofei.

“Since it’s a gift from brother Chen, you should accept it!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Only then did Song Wei and Ling Qingxue take the headdress and said in unison,””Many thanks, brother Chen!”

The two of them didn’t need to discuss and tacitly chose the headdress that they liked. Song Wei took the Magnolia headdress, while Ling Qingxue chose the Phoenix headdress, which was more in line with their personalities.

The two of them held the headwear in their hands and immediately felt a refreshing coolness. It was as if their minds were refreshed and they became much more clear – headed.

“These two head ornaments have the effect of calming one’s mind and focusing one’s concentration. After wearing them, you’ll be able to cultivate twice as fast.” For Qi condensation cultivators, the effect was quite good. Originally, I found two rainbow feathers along with these two head ornaments, but the feathers have already been worn down by the passage of time. Otherwise, it would have been more suitable to give them to my two sisters – in – Law. ”

“Many thanks, brother Chen!” Xia ruofei said,”your gift is great! It’s also very suitable for Wei Wei and Qingxue, thanks!”

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue expressed their gratitude to Chen Xuan.

“Brother Xia, you didn’t tell me in advance.” Chen Xuan waved his hand and said,”I didn’t prepare any special gifts for my two siblings today.” Originally, wild tea was more suitable, but with brother Xia’s tender and protective nature, I believe that my two sister – in – Law should have already taken it. ”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”brother Chen, you know me well!”

“Ruofei, why don’t you talk to brother Chen for a while?” Song Wei stood up and said. I’ll go prepare dinner with Qingxue. ”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded,”okay, thank you ...”

In fact, Xia ruofei was almost done preparing dinner. Song Wei and Ling Qingxue only needed to stir – fry a few more vegetables and watch the fire. Besides, Song Wei’s cooking skills were not bad, so it was not a problem for her to complete the task. As for Ling Qingxue ... As long as she didn’t make things worse.

Xia ruofei and Chen Xuan were the only ones left in the living room.

Xia ruofei poured away the tea leaves that Song Wei and Ling Qingxue had just made and cleaned the tea set again. Then, he took out the peach blossom Da Hong Pao and started to make tea while chatting with Chen Xuan.
