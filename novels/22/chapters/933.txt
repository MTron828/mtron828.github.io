Liang Qichao couldn’t help but exclaim in his heart,”This was the perfect match, the golden couple!

In contrast, although he was also wearing an Armani suit, his slightly bloated figure did not give him a high – Class aura. Instead, he looked like a nouveau riche.

Liang Qichao couldn’t help but feel a little depressed.

Lin Qiao looked a little shy and said,””Brother ruofei, What are you looking at? Don’t you recognize me?”

Xia ruofei came back to her senses and smiled.””I almost couldn’t recognize her. It turns out that our Qiao’ er is so beautiful in an evening gown!”

Lin Qiao was overjoyed. It was as sweet as honey. She smiled at Xia ruofei with a blushing face and walked down the stairs while lifting her dress.

“Brother ruofei, you’re so sweet – tongued, is this how you managed to trick sister – in – Law?” Lin Qiao walked to Xia ruofei and smiled.

“What do you mean by lying?” Xia ruofei said,”Qingxue and I are in love and we are childhood sweethearts, okay?”

Liang Qichao couldn’t help but give Xia ruofei a thumbs – up in his heart when he saw Xia ruofei talking about him and his girlfriend in front of the beautiful woman.

Only Xia ruofei was slow in this aspect. Even Liang Qichao could tell that Lin Qiao was looking at Xia ruofei weirdly.

It was almost Sixo’ clock in the evening. The three of them set off immediately after they were ready.

Paradise Farm was not far from boggallbin. After about 20 minutes, Liang Qichao’s Mercedes – Benz arrived at Spicer Vineyard Hotel.

This Manor – style hotel was considered high – end in the entire Hunter Valley area. It had top – notch luxurious decorations, a beautiful and quiet environment, and a vast vineyard scenery.

Every room in the hotel was located in the rolling vineyard and local bushes, as romantic as a forest hut in a fairy tale.

In order to provide the most private and comfortable living experience, this hotel only had eight rooms.

Of course, the reception was held in the main banquet hall of the hotel. The people who attended the reception tonight were the people in charge of the wineries and farms in the Hunter Valley area, so there was no need for a room.

The car passed through the quiet forest path. Along the way, they could see individual villas hidden by the green trees, as well as swimming pools and small golf courses of various designs.

The small parking lot was filled with all kinds of luxury cars. Brands like Mercedes – Benz and BMW were not eye – catching here. Xia ruofei even saw two Bentleys. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

After parking the car, Xia ruofei and the other two walked into the banquet hall of the hotel’s main building.

At the entrance of the hall stood four cold – looking Men in Black. Although the lights were on, they were still wearing sunglasses, and they looked around from time to time.

The Man in Black checked Xia ruofei’s and Liang Qichao’s invitation cards carefully and made an inviting gesture to let the three of them in.

Xia ruofei noticed that one of the four men was black, one was white, and the other two had yellow skin and black hair.

Liang Qichao laughed and said in a low voice,””Ruofei, the boss of this distributor is Chinese, so he has quite a few Chinese people working for him. However, whether it’s their boss or their bodyguards, most of them came to Australia a few generations ago. So, other than the difference in their looks, they are actually native Australians. ”

“The legendary Banana Man!” Xia ruofei laughed. Suddenly, he had an idea and asked in a low voice,”you’re saying that the boss of this Distributing Company is Chinese? It can’t be Tang Yitian from the Mei ya group, right?”

“You know about the Meiya group too?” Liang Qichao asked, surprised. It seems that you have done your homework! Maya’s Chairman Ethan. I think Tang’s Chinese name is Tang Yitian!”

Liang Qichao’s knowledge in Australia was different from his knowledge in China. Tang Yitian always used his English name in the media and in some formal occasions. In fact, it was the name on his ID card. The name “Tang Yitian” was given by his father according to the family tree.

On the plane, Xia ruofei had heard Jennifer call Tang Yitian “Irene.”

“Is the Maya Group very powerful in Australia?” Xia ruofei asked.

He had only learned a little from Lin Qiao. As for Tang Yitian, he certainly wouldn’t boast in front of him.

Liang Qichao said exaggeratedly,”just remove the ‘is’.” Maya is Australia’s retail giant. Among the three biggest supermarket chain brands in Australia, Maya is also the well – deserved leader. It’s no exaggeration to say that if we can get the support of Maya supermarket, our Paradise Farm will be able to dominate Australia. Even if we don’t have the advantage in the quality of Taoyuan vegetables, we can still sell well in all of Australia!”

“That’s amazing ...” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but click his tongue. Then, he asked,”will Tang Yitian be attending tonight?”

Xia ruofei thought that if Tang Yitian attended the party, he could introduce Liang Qichao to him. Then, Paradise Farm wouldn’t have to worry about the distribution channel anymore, and Liang Qichao could focus on making good products.

“I don’t think it’s possible.” Liang Qichao said,”today’s only a party for the suppliers in Hunter Valley. I think it’ll be a very high standard if the person – in – charge of New South Wales can attend.”

“I know,” Xia ruofei nodded.

If Tang Yitian hadn’t come, Xia ruofei wouldn’t have called him to tell him about it. Anyway, he would be going to Sydney to meet him soon, so he could just mention it.

In consideration of social etiquette, Xia ruofei and Liang Qichao spoke in very low voices. Lin Qiao, on the other hand, was busy admiring the beautiful decorations and exotic furnishings in the hall and did not notice what they were talking about.

There were many soft long sofas and single sofas in the banquet hall, and there were exquisite desserts on the long tables against the wall. Many waiters in black waistcoats shuttled through the crowd with trays, ready to serve the guests at any time.

There was a white grand piano in the corner of the hall, and a white performer in a tuxedo was playing the piano with great focus. Soothing piano music flowed in the hall.

The guests were either sitting or standing, elegantly holding their glasses and talking in small groups.

The New South Wales branch of the Maya Group would hold such parties every season. The purpose was to strengthen communication between the suppliers. For the suppliers, it was also a good opportunity to communicate with each other and improve their relationship with the Maya Group.

Lin Qiao, who was like a fairy in a flower, immediately attracted a lot of attention when she entered the hall. This evening dress almost perfectly set off her oriental charm and a trace of playfulness at the same time, so many people turned their heads.

Some young people raised their glasses to Lin Qiao in a friendly manner.

On the way, Xia ruofei introduced some social etiquette to Lin Qiao. However, when they entered the banquet hall, Lin Qiao still looked a little nervous.

Xia ruofei gently patted Lin Qiao’s hand on his arm and said,””Relax, can’t you see that your beauty has conquered everyone? It’ll be fine to just say hello to them. ”

Xia ruofei’s words seemed to have magic. Lin Qiao’s face slowly bloomed into a smile. She nodded and reached for a glass of champagne from the waiter’s tray beside her. Then, she raised her glass to the people who greeted her.

After entering the banquet hall, Liang Qichao and Xia ruofei split up.

He had been in Australia for almost a year, so he naturally had a lot of acquaintances in the Hunter Valley area. Therefore, he shuttled through the crowd with a glass of wine in his hand and chatted with people from time to time.

Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao strolled around the main hall for a while. After eating a few desserts, they found an empty sofa and sat down to rest.

On the other side of the hall, a young man and a young woman were sitting and talking.

The two of them were Zheng Peng and tan Lili.

Tan Lili, who had never been to such a high – end cocktail party before, was like a grandmother who had just entered a Grand View Garden. Her face was glowing.

Because she was dressed very sexily today, a deep V – neck purple evening dress set off her full figure, especially her perky breasts, which attracted a lot of hot eyes.

Tan Lili was very vain, so she was naturally happy to receive so much attention.

From time to time, she would raise her glass to the people who greeted her. Sometimes, she would even bow slightly, appearing elegant and calm.

“What do you think, baby? It feels good, right?” Zheng Peng put his arm around tan Lili’s waist and asked with a smile.

Zheng Peng also felt very proud of his female companion.

“Very good!” Tan Lili said happily,”it’s just like the life I imagined in the upper class! My dear, you have to bring me to more of these events in the future!”

“No problem ...” Zheng Peng gave an empty promise.

Tan Lili’s gaze was a little dazed as she looked in a certain direction and mumbled to herself,””Why are they here?”

“Who is it?” Zheng Peng said as he looked in the direction of tan Lili’s gaze.

Then, his face darkened as he saw Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao.

Tan Lili didn’t look too good either. Lin Qiao was like a beautiful little princess today, attracting a lot of attention like a magnet, which made tan Lili very uncomfortable.

Zheng Peng’s eyes flashed with a dark look, then he said with a smile,””Lili, since your classmate is here, let’s go and say hello?”

Tan Lili couldn’t help but look at Zheng Peng and said,””What are you saying hello for? Lin Qiao’s boyfriend is so wild, aren’t you afraid ...”

“What kind of occasion is this?” Zheng Peng sneered. Would he still dare to make a move? I can’t wait for him to hit me! Don’t you see those big Men in Black around us? Let me tell you, he’s a real member of the Chinese society. ”

Zheng Peng paused for a moment before he continued,””Have you heard of the righteous Association? Back then, Ethan. Tang was the leader of the righteous Association. He had wiped out the Vietnam gang and the Indonesian gang in New South Wales, and even shocked the entire underground world of Australia! But now, Ethan. Although Dunn has already cleared his name, whoever dares to make trouble in his territory is courting death!”

Tan Lili’s eyes lit up when she heard that.””The boss of the Chinese society? That Ethan. Don’t you think Dunn is very impressive?”

Zheng Peng glanced at tan Lili and said,””Don’t be so smitten! A person at eldest brother Tang’s level is not someone we can come into contact with! Let’s go over and say Hello, I’m just thinking of checking him out!”

“What bottom line?” Tan Lili asked in confusion.

“If he didn’t sneak into the hotel, then he must be a farm owner or a winery owner in the Hunter Valley area. But I’ve never heard of such a person before!” Zheng Peng sneered.
