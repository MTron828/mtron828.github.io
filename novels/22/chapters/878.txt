After he Dong finished speaking, he took a step back respectfully to highlight yang Jianren’s status. At the same time, he looked at Xia ruofei with a cold smile on his face.

Yang Jianren’s beady eyes rolled a few times before he looked at Xia ruofei with a sneer on his face.

“Vice Mayor he, the distinguished guest you mentioned, could it be the one beside you?” Yang Jianren said in a mocking tone.

“Yes,” he Feng said seriously.”Young master Xia is a distinguished guest that I usually can’t even invite. Today’s room was specially reserved for young master Xia!”

Yang Jianren turned around and met he Dong’s eyes. Then, as if he had heard the funniest joke, he couldn’t help but burst out laughing.

He Feng frowned and looked at Xia ruofei worriedly. He asked,””Young master yang, are my words laughable?”

Yang Jianren laughed so hard that he was out of breath. He pointed at Xia ruofei and said,””Deputy Mayor he, don’t tell me you met a scammer? As far as I know, this guy is just a farmer! He opened a small farm and did some small business! And ‘master Xia’? I think you’ve been blinded by lard!”

He Feng’s expression changed and he said loudly,””Young master yang, please be careful with your words!”

He didn’t care about yang Jianren’s life after he offended Xia ruofei, but he was worried that Xia ruofei would be in a bad mood and his efforts today would be in vain! What if Xia ruofei was a dandy with a weird temper? he might even vent his anger on her!

At this moment, Xia ruofei, who had been comfortably leaning on the sofa, stood up and said to he Feng,””Mayor he, he’s right. I really do own a small farm. It’s not wrong to say that I’m a farmer ...”

“Young master Xia, please don’t joke around ...” He Feng said with a sad face.

Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”I’m not joking!” President Zheng and I are old friends, he can prove it. ”

President Zheng didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. He nodded helplessly at he Feng.

Just as President Zheng was about to say that Xia ruofei had more than just opened a farm, yang Jianren could not wait to say,””Deputy Mayor he, did you see that? Elder Zheng had also proven it! This was just a farmer! You’re actually treating him as a guest of honor, what a joke ...”

At this time, he Dong also finally couldn’t help but jump out and echo,””Young master yang, it seems that scammers these days are really too rampant. Even a farmer dares to swindle people and pretend to be the young master of a rich family. And there are actually people who believe it ...”

“Hahahaha ...” Yang Jianren’s men couldn’t help but burst into laughter. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

He Feng looked at Xia ruofei and then at yang Jianren. He said,””Young master yang, no matter what Mr. Xia’s identity is, he’s an important guest I’ve invited today, so you don’t have to worry about it. We’ve already reserved this private room in advance. Please go back!”

He Fengshi would never believe that Xia ruofei was just a small businessman. Who had ever seen a farmer who could make the new provincial and Municipal Committee pay so much attention to his small matter?

Perhaps Xia ruofei had started a farm, but it was definitely for fun. Didn’t all the rich young masters like to come out and start their own businesses? As he Feng thought about it, he made up his mind.

“Hmph!” Yang Jianren snorted coldly and said,”he Feng, you’re good! Now that my wings have hardened and my dad is no longer the leader of the yl District, you’re not going to care about me, are you? Don’t forget that my dad is still working in the city! Besides, how do you know that my dad will no longer lead you in the future?”

He Feng’s face couldn’t help but Twitch, but he still gritted his teeth and said,””Young master yang, I don’t have any other meaning, but there’s always a first come, first served basis! Even if commander yang were to come here personally, I would still say the same thing!”

“Alright! You’re good!” Yang Jianren said through gritted teeth.

At this point, they had basically shed all pretenses of cordiality and could not continue the discussion at all.

He could be considered to hate he Feng.

This kind of FOP might not be able to accomplish anything, but if he wanted to do something bad, he had all kinds of tricky methods that were impossible to guard against.

Yang Jianren was already thinking about how to make he Feng suffer in the future.

At this moment, a voice came from the door of the private room,””Yo! It’s really lively today! Yang, you’ve gathered so many people today ...”

Everyone looked towards the door of the private room. Xia ruofei only glanced at them indifferently and realized that he did not know the person who had come. He then continued to sip his tea.

And whether it was yang Jianren or he Feng, when they saw the person, their faces subconsciously showed a trace of flattery ...
