” 200000 dollars!” Someone directly added $50000. The previous truffle had been sold for 350000, so everyone knew that this truffle would not be lower than that price, so they decided not to increase the price any further. And most of the people in the hall knew that this was the only chance they had today to buy the best truffle. As for the last item, although MA Xiong had clearly stated that he would not participate in the bidding, there were at least three other people who were as rich as MA Xiong. They had not made a single bid so far, and it was obvious that they were all after the truffle. ” 250000 dollars!” As soon as the bid of 200000 dollars was called, someone immediately added another 50000 dollars. ” 280 thousand!” ” 300000 dollars!” ” 330000 dollars!” ” 340 thousand!” The bids were quickly called out one by one. The auctioneer did not even have time to repeat their bids. In a short time, the price of the White truffle had reached 340000 US dollars, which was very close to the price that MA Xiong had bid for the last truffle. Finally, a voice said loudly,”” 350 thousand dollars!” This was a Chinese man. Many people present knew him, Chen Haosheng, the president of the Golden cauldron group, a rich man with a net worth of more than 5 billion. ” 360000 US dollars! ” A crisp voice rang out. This time, it was a beautiful young woman in her early thirties who was also famous. Her name was Yuan Qingqing, the owner of the fair Lady health club. This health club was a high-end health and beauty agency that specialized in female customers. Yuan Qingqing was also a rich man with a net worth of billions. As soon as these two bid, many people gave up. Chen Haosheng thought for a moment, then raised his sign again and shouted, ” “370 thousand dollars. President Yuan, why don’t you take a step back? After I bid for this truffle, I can invite you to share it with me. It’s absolutely free!” Many guests revealed a smile of understanding. Yuan Qingqing could be considered a great beauty, and a woman in her early thirties had a mature charm. Moreover, she was also a rich man, who wouldn’t want to get close to her? ” 400000 dollars! ” Yuan Qingqing’s expression didn’t change as she directly added another 30000 dollars, and then said lightly, ” I’m sorry, I don’t lack money, and I like to enjoy the good things alone! ” Chen Haosheng laughed embarrassedly and shrugged his shoulders, ” A gentleman doesn’t take what others like. President Yuan, I give up. ” Yuan Qingqing’s bid was too fierce, and Chen Haosheng directly gave up the competition. Only a glutton who loved truffles would spend a lot more than its value on a truffle. Businessmen were rich, but it was the most rational to weigh the pros and cons. “Boss Yuan bid 400000 US dollars!” Seeing this, the auctioneer said, ” is there anyone else who wants to bid? Four hundred thousand dollars going once ... Four hundred thousand dollars going twice ... Four hundred thousand dollars going thrice!” With a clang, the gavel fell, and the 1.53 kg white truffle was sold for 400000 US dollars. So far, Xia ruofei had earned nearly 970000 US dollars. There was still a giant truffle that was not auctioned. Today was destined to be Xia ruofei’s Day of profit. As Xia ruofei walked up the stage, the guests held their breaths, waiting for Xia ruofei to reveal the final answer. Xia ruofei didn’t beat around the bush. He picked up the microphone and said with a smile, ” ” I believe everyone has been waiting for this moment for a long time. Then ... I announce that the last round of the auction has officially begun. Our final item is ...” At this point, Xia ruofei tore off the last piece of red silk cloth and pointed at the giant white truffle in the sealed container. ” “This giant white truffle weighs 2.05 kg!”He said. As soon as Xia ruofei finished speaking, the crowd went into an uproar. Some people even stood up and stretched their necks to look at the stage. “Oh my God, this is unbelievable! Is this the biggest white truffle ever found? ” “The world record! It was definitely a world record! We’re actually witnessing the birth of a world record today!” “This is indeed the biggest surprise! This trip was really worth it!” …… Everyone was excited, except for one person, Blake. Blake felt like he was being slapped in the face when he saw the truffles that Xia ruofei took out being sold at such high prices. When the truffle was revealed, Blake felt as if he was struck by lightning. “This is impossible!” Blake suddenly stood up and shouted, ” it must be fake! White truffles can’t grow to this size, it must have been forged with other similar fungi!” MA Xiong snorted and stood up. He turned around and said to Blake coldly, ” ” Young man, it’s not a good habit to speak without thinking. This batch of truffles was personally guaranteed by me. Are you saying that I, MA Xiong, am lying to everyone? ” ” I ...” Blake was at a loss for words. He had completely lost his mind just now, and now he was starting to regret it. More and more people started to criticize Blake. Some of them had successfully bid for the White truffle, while others were empty-handed. However, they had all tasted the White truffle that Xia ruofei had given away for free, so they all stood up to speak for him. All the accusations were like arrows that were shot at Blake. He stood there with a pale face and couldn’t say a word. In the end, Blake chose to leave the studio with his tail between his legs. No matter how thick-skinned he was, he couldn’t stay there any longer. Just as Blake reached the door, Xia ruofei said loudly, ” ” Everyone, before the official auction, I will invite a few guests to the stage to appraise this white truffle. Paradise corporation’s reputation can not be slandered. If there is no problem with our truffle, I hope to see Mr. Blake’s apology on the mainstream media in Shen Cheng city. Otherwise, you will soon receive our lawyer’s letter! ” Blake’s footsteps stopped for a moment. He snorted coldly with an ashen face and left the auction site. Although Xia ruofei was still smiling, the way he looked at Blake’s back had become cold. Soon, the representatives selected by the guests came to the stage. They were either famous Western chefs or business leaders, all of whom were highly respected. When everyone was on the stage, Xia ruofei opened the lid of the giant truffle. The group of people surrounded the truffle and looked at it carefully for a long time. The final conclusion was unsurprisingly that it was a whole piece of white truffle. The quality was top notch and could be called the best! Xia ruofei said in the midst of the applause,””I now announce that the auction for this 2.05 kg white truffle will officially begin!”
