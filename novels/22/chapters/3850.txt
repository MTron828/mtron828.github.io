Chapter 3851  Gathering at the three mountains (2)

  ……

  A few hours later, Xia ruofei's Black Phoenix flying boat returned to the jiangbin villa district in Sanshan city.

  It was already past nineo' clock at night in China.

  He had just made a round trip to Australia, and on his way back, he had made a detour to the star Seizer sect to pick up Luo Qingfeng. As for Song Wei and the other two, it was only a one - way trip from Peach Blossom Island to Huaxia. Hence, even though the cloud piercing shuttle was slower than the black Phoenix flying boat, the three of them had already arrived at the three mountains before Xia ruofei.

  Li Yifu was the only one in the villa. Song Wei and Ling Qingxue had already gone home.

  Song Wei had already spoken to song Qiming. Song Qiming pushed back his complicated work for two days and asked for leave from his superior. This way, he could head to the first heaven society with Xia ruofei and the rest the next morning.

  Naturally, Ling Qingxue had returned home to accompany her father, Ling Xiaotian. She had spent most of her time on the Peach Blossom Island, and this time, she had only spent one night at the three mountains. Thus, it was only natural for her to return home to have a meal and chat with her father.

  Xia ruofei brought Tang Haoran and Luo Qingfeng into the villa.

  Li Yifu quickly stood up and respectfully said,""Greetings, martial granduncle! Greetings, little martial uncle!"

  He then greeted Luo Qingfeng.

  Xia ruofei nodded and said,"adopted husband, have you finished the handover with old man Zheng on Peach Blossom Island?"

  "Yes!" Li Yifu quickly nodded. There's no problem with Zheng Yongshou controlling the Taixu xuanqing formation, and he's even more skilled than this disciple. With him guarding the Peach Blossom Island, nothing will happen. "

  "Mm! There's nothing else for you to do tonight, so you can find a room and rest early. " Xia ruofei said,"rest well today and enter the seven Star Pavilion at the first heaven sect tomorrow. Only then will you be in good condition!" Qingfeng, the same goes. Rest early today!"

  "Yes! If martial granduncle doesn't have any other instructions, this disciple will return to my room to rest!" Li Yifu said.

  "Yes!" Luo Qingfeng also bowed and said."As you wish!"

  "Go!" Xia ruofei nodded.

  There were two guest rooms on the first floor of the villa, so Li Yifu and Qingfeng Luo had one each.

  After the two of them returned to their rooms, Xia ruofei said to Tang Haoran,""Haoran, you should also find a room to rest! There shouldn't be any problems with washing up and taking a bath, right? In addition ... You wouldn't be afraid to sleep alone, would you?"

  "You're underestimating me too much, master!"Tang Haoran puffed out his chest and said. I've been in my own room for a long time! I'm already so big, how can I need someone to help me shower?"

  Xia ruofei patted Tang Haoran's head and smiled.""Hahaha! In the blink of an eye, the little kid had grown up! Alright, then you should also choose your own room and rest early! You're not allowed to play with your phone or stay up late, understand? I have to be in my best condition tomorrow!"

  "I know, master!" "Yes, master," Tang Haoran replied."Can I sleep in the room next to yours?"

  "No problem! The biggest master bedroom on the second floor is my room. You can choose any of the other rooms!" Xia ruofei said with a smile.

  "Alright! Then I'll go upstairs first!" Tang Haoran said happily.

  After sending Li Yifu and Tang Haoran back to their rooms, Xia ruofei returned to the master bedroom on the second floor. He took out a few bottles of elemental serum and cultivated for a few hours. He stopped cultivating at around midnight and went to the bathroom to take a shower before going to bed to rest.

  The next morning, when Xia ruofei got up and went downstairs, Li Yifu was already busy in the kitchen. Luo Qingfeng was helping him.

  Qingfeng Luo had been the sect master for so many years, and it had always been others who served him. He was really not familiar with the skills in the kitchen. In contrast, although Yifu li used to be a world - Class rich man, his cooking skills had always been good. He probably had this kind of interest in the past.

  Luo Qingfeng quickly bowed and greeted Xia ruofei when he saw him.

  Li Yifu also said respectfully,"senior granduncle, you're up!" Wait a moment, breakfast will be ready soon!"

  Xia ruofei laughed and said,"my adopted husband!" Qingfeng! You guys are up so early! We don't have to prepare much for breakfast, just have a simple meal and we'll set off!"

  "Alright! I'll be done in a minute!" Li Yifu said.

  Xia ruofei looked around and realized that Tang Haoran was not on the first floor. He mumbled to himself,""Is this little fellow still sleeping in?"

  He was about to go upstairs to wake Tang Haoran up when he heard footsteps coming from the second floor. Tang Haoran had already finished washing up and walked out of the room.

  "Good Morning, master!" Tang Haoran said.

  "Good Morning!" Xia ruofei looked at his watch and said,"not bad! I thought you were sleeping in!"

  "My work and rest time is very regular!" Tang Haoran said,"but there's a two - hour time difference between this place and Australia. I'm still not used to it ..."

  "It's fine, you don't need to get over the jet lag!" Xia ruofei laughed and said,"you'll only be out for a day or two this time. You'll be going back to Australia soon!"

  At this time, Li Yifu had already prepared breakfast, and Luo Qingfeng was helping to bring it to the dining room. The breakfast was not particularly sumptuous. It was just home - cooked porridge, fried eggs, and the like, but there was still a variety.

  Xia ruofei called everyone over for breakfast. He had already contacted Song Wei and Ling Qingxue on WeChat in the morning. Both of them said that they would come over after breakfast.

  Ling Qingxue lived close by, so she could have breakfast with Ling Xiaotian, chat with him for a while, and then walk over.

  On Song Wei's side, she had also finished her breakfast at home. Then, she drove her car and brought song Qiming to meet up with her.

  After Xia ruofei and the other three finished their breakfast, Li Yifu and Luo Qingfeng cleaned up the table and the kitchen. Then, they sat in the living room and chatted. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

  At around 8:30 in the morning, Xia ruofei heard the sound of a car engine outside. Then, the courtyard gate of the villa slowly opened by itself. Xia ruofei had already registered with the property management and could enter the community directly. In addition, the license plate had been entered into the villa's access control system. When the license plate was recognized at the entrance, the courtyard gate would open automatically.

  Xia ruofei scanned the room with his spiritual power and realized that Song Wei and song Qiming had arrived.

  "Weiwei and uncle song are here, let's go and pick them up!" He said with a smile.

  "Don't say anything wrong in front of Weiwei's father," Xia ruofei reminded them."Remember what I told you yesterday!"

  When Li Yifu was on the Peach Blossom Island, he would address Song Wei and Ling Qingxue as "master grandmother." Tang Haoran followed suit and addressed them as "master's wife" whenever he saw them.

  This time, she could not let it slip in front of song Qiming. Song Qiming would definitely not be able to accept polygamy, especially when one of the female leads was his precious daughter. If he was not mentally prepared, he might break down.

  "Understood!" Li Yifu, Tang Haoran, and Luo Qingfeng responded in unison.

  Xia ruofei brought the three of them out of the villa and into the courtyard. Song Wei had just parked her car and was getting out of the car with song Qiming.

  "Uncle song! Good Morning!" Xia ruofei smiled and greeted him.

  "You're early too!" Song Qiming said with a smile.

  "Will your work be affected by this last - minute arrangement?" Wang Yao asked. Xia ruofei asked.

  Song Qiming laughed heartily and said,""Work can never be finished, but it's not a problem to squeeze out time! I heard from Weiwei that this is a rare opportunity that you fought for with great difficulty, so I definitely can't miss it!"

  Xia ruofei smiled and nodded,"yes!" When everyone is here, I will tell everyone in detail about the magic treasure of the seven Star Pavilion that we will be in contact with this time! By the way, uncle song, let me introduce you!"

  Then, Xia ruofei pointed at Li Yifu and said,""This is Li Yifu, we're from the same sect."

  "Old Mr. Li is a famous patriotic Chinese, I know him!" Song Qiming said with a smile.

  Li Yifu didn't dare to neglect Jian Jia. This was Song Wei's father. Song Wei and Xia ruofei were of the same generation. Song Wei's father was Xia ruofei's senior. However, he was Xia ruofei's Grand - disciple. In this way, he was no longer of the same generation.

  "Hello, Mr. Song!" He quickly said.

  When Xia ruofei introduced him, he said "we're from the same sect. "Just as Li Yifu was about to explain to song Qiming that he was actually Xia ruofei's Grand - disciple, the sound of footsteps came from outside, followed by Ling Qingxue's crisp voice."Everyone is early! I live the closest, but I'm the last one to arrive. I'm really sorry ..."
