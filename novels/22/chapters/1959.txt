1960 An old friend visits (2)

However, he quickly adjusted his emotions and closed the folder. He smiled and said,””Liu Qian, you’ve done a good job during this period of time, and you’ve considered all the details in all aspects very well. In the next one or two days, you have to continue to work hard and don’t drop the ball at critical moments. We’re mainly here to watch the fun. You’ll be in charge of the auction, understand?”

What Xia ruofei meant was that Liu Qian would be in charge of the organization and coordination of the entire auction.

Liu Qian felt that she had a pillar of support after picking up Xia ruofei and the others. Now that Xia ruofei said this, she immediately felt great pressure.

If this job was done well, it would naturally be an outstanding thing, but once there was a mistake in any part, it would be equivalent to losing points in front of the four company executives at the same time.

However, Liu Qian quickly stood up and replied,””I understand! President Xia and the other leaders, please rest assured! I won’t betray your trust!”

Xia ruofei gestured with his hands and smiled.””Sit down and talk, sit down and talk, I’m not asking you to show your determination ...”

Liu Qian smiled a little embarrassedly and sat back in her seat.

Xia ruofei said,”that’s true, but it’s not like we don’t care anymore. If there’s anything that we can’t coordinate or if there’s something you don’t understand, you can come and ask us anytime. We’re a team, after all!”

“I understand. Thank you, President Xia!” Liu Qian said with a sweet smile.

She knew that if she really asked Xia ruofei or Feng Jing for help, the leaders would definitely not sit by and do nothing. However, this way, her mission’s KPI would definitely drop. Although there was no clear quantitative index, there must be a scale in the leaders ‘hearts.

“President Xia, if there are no other instructions, I’ll go down first!” Liu Qian said. I’m going to take a look at the venue again. I’ll be doing the final adjustments today. ”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””You can go!”

Then, he turned to Feng Jing and the others and smiled.””You guys should also go back to your rooms and rest for a while! You can go out if you want, but don’t delay your dinner time!”

“Alright! Then we’ll go down too!” Feng Jing smiled and said,”Chairman, you should rest too. See you at dinner!”

“See you tonight!” Xia ruofei stood up and said.

Feng Jing and the others had gotten their room cards in advance. Their rooms were located one floor below the Presidential Suite, and everyone was arranged to a Business Suite. In fact, even Liu Qian was staying in a luxurious King – sized room. It could be said that the Hengfeng group’s reception standards were quite high.

After Feng Jing and the other two left, Xia ruofei changed into a comfortable set of home clothes. He poured a glass of red wine and sat in front of the bright floor – to – Ceiling window. He looked at the White sails on Victoria Bay in the distance and muttered to himself,”Should I give her a call?”

Xia ruofei was still looking forward to meeting Monica again in Hong Kong.

The two of them exchanged contact information, but they didn’t contact each other much, especially in the past few months.

Xia ruofei did not know how Monica was doing.

Actually, from a certain perspective, Xia ruofei’s personality was a little passive. Monica did not contact him, so he did not contact her either. He was always worried about whether he would disturb Monica.

Besides, Xia ruofei could not figure it out. Although he had been with Monica twice and he was Monica’s first man, Western women had a different mindset from traditional Chinese women. Xia ruofei did not know what position he was in Monica’s heart. Perhaps she really thought of him as a man who was solving her physiological needs or a man who could comfort each other at a certain time.

As he thought about it, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel a little irritated. He took out a cigarette and put it in his mouth. Ding! He flicked the Zippo lighter away and lit it.

He took a deep breath and then exhaled, as if he was exhaling all the foul air in his heart.

Just then, Xia ruofei heard the doorbell ring.

He turned to look at the display on the access control system not far away, then walked over and pressed the intercom button.””Please enter!”

The door of the Presidential Suite opened from the outside. A middle – aged man in a tuxedo and a bow tie walked in. He was the Butler of the Presidential Suite. His English name was Tony. He was actually Chinese. He was a native of Hong Kong. Hong Kong had been colonized by the United Kingdom for many years, so they had a tradition of using English names. They mainly used English names at work.

“Tony, what’s the matter?” Xia ruofei asked.

Tony bowed slightly.”Mr. Xia, there’s a Mr. Jason Blake here to visit you. He said he’s an old friend of yours. Would you like to meet him?”

Xia ruofei’s eyebrows raised and a faint smile appeared on his face.

Jason Blake was the head of the Blake family. After the auction, he was the one who discussed the collaboration with Xia ruofei. He was also the one who made the decision to appoint George Blake, who had always been against Xia ruofei, as the successor.

When Xia ruofei saw the name of the Blake family on the auction list, he had already guessed that old Blake would come to see him. However, he did not expect the old man to be so eager.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”lead him to the guest room!” I’ll come over after I change my clothes!”

Although they were in their own hotel room, they still had to dress formally when meeting guests. At least, they couldn’t wear casual clothes. This was also basic social etiquette.

“Yes, Mr. Xia!” Tony bowed slightly and then left quietly.

Xia ruofei stubbed out his cigarette in the ashtray and strode towards the large master bedroom in the Presidential Suite.

When Xia ruofei changed into a well – tailored suit and arrived at the reception room, old Blake was already sitting there waiting.

The silver – haired old Blake looked energetic. When he saw Xia ruofei, he immediately stood up and took two steps forward. He opened his arms and said with a warm smile,”My dear Xia! We meet again!”

Xia ruofei was not used to the foreigner’s habit of hugging. However, he could only endure the discomfort in his heart when old Blake was so enthusiastic. He hugged old Blake and then they took their seats.

After Tony served the tea, he bent over and whispered into Xia ruofei’s ear,””Mr. Xia, I’ll take my leave now. If you have any instructions, please press the call bell at any time!”

Xia ruofei nodded slightly, and Tony immediately walked out of the guest room and closed the door behind him. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Mr. Blake, thank you for coming to support me again!” Xia ruofei smiled and spoke in fluent English.

“The black family is very interested in any high – Quality truffles, not to mention the truffles brought by Mr. Xia. Each piece is enough to amaze the world. How can we miss such a grand event?” Old Blake said with a smile,

“You flatter me! You’re too kind!” Xia ruofei said indifferently,”then ... What business do you have with me today, Mr. Blake?”

Old Blake hesitated for a moment and said,”Mr. Xia, our black family has signed a supply agreement with your paradise Corporation. Why don’t you sell the truffles to us directly? Our purchase price is already a premium on the base of the average price of the last auction. I think that if you sell it to us directly, the profit won’t be less than the auction, and you can save a lot of trouble. If you count the share of the auction house, I think the profit may be higher if you sell it directly. ”

Xia ruofei knew that old Blake would definitely tell him about this when he met him. This foreigner was quite ambitious. He wanted to get everything done in one go!

But how could Xia ruofei let old Blake do as he wished? He wasn’t auctioning truffles just for money. His more important goal was to make the Paradise Corporation famous overseas.

Although there were many products being auctioned this time, truffles and top – grade one – headed abalones were still the most important items in this batch of goods. If any of them were missing, this comprehensive “product exhibition” would lose a lot of points.

Hence, Xia ruofei smiled and said,””Mr. Blake, I certainly won’t forget the agreement we signed. But if I remember correctly, the agreement should be in effect starting next year. My truffles are not within the scope of the agreement, right?”
