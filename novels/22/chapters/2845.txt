Bar?a’s statement was brief:

” 1. Last weekend, after our home game against Espanyol, the fountain system was turned on before the Spanish players left due to the operational error of the stadium manager. We express our deep regret and apologize to the Espanyol players. In the future, we will strengthen our management work to prevent similar incidents from happening.

Second, regarding the matter of Mr. Meyers, a member of the bar?a fan organization, lying in front of the media, the club understands the fans ‘defense of the team, but we have always advocated the principle of integrity. We do not agree with and advocate Mr. Meyers’ behavior, and we sincerely hope that the fans can face the team’s negative news rationally. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

After Xia ruofei read the statement, a smile appeared on his face.

Bar?a’s statement was still trying to shirk responsibility. Even a fool would not believe the so – called “misoperation” of the stadium administrator, because this was not the first time. Perhaps it was just the personal behavior of an individual staff member, but the club did not correct it in time and even acquiesced to such a thing happening, just to disgust the opponent. It had to be said that such a big club was really a little petty.

On the other hand, bar?a’s attitude toward Mayers was generally good. His “three views” were more upright. Although he did not use very harsh words on Mayers, he clearly expressed his attitude.

After all, Meyers was a die – hard fan of the team, and bar?a was probably worried that their words would be too harsh and easily cause the other fans to be at odds with each other.

No matter what, Barca had made his stand clear. In a sense, it could be said that he had lowered his proud head.

It did not seem easy to bow their heads. If there was no irrefutable evidence, bar?a would not care about how the Spanish team complained!

Xia ruofei immediately used Google to search for news related to Mayers. He quickly found the article that Zhou leiyun had mentioned. It was also published this afternoon by a small media company in Barcelona.

Big media outlets like marca and as would not do things like the paparazzi, while small media outlets did not care so much in order to attract attention and promote sales.

In this news report, the tabloid reporter revealed Mayers ‘annual ticket number and home address. They had been waiting since the morning and took a lot of photos in half a day.

The reporters even stopped Mayers, who was going out to throw out the garbage, hoping to interview him.

After the news of the referee’s rejection was exposed, Meyers ‘status in the fan organization plummeted, and bar?a even canceled his annual pass. Many fans blamed him for talking nonsense. Not only did he not help the team, but he also made the team more passive in public opinion.

Mayers read the statement from The Sports Daily and was surprised to find that the statement did not mention Pablo bribing him with money and then cooking up the video. Instead, he said that he had deliberately lied for the sake of the club and that Pablo had resigned due to his oversight.

When Mayes saw this, he was furious.

In fact, Pablo was the mastermind behind this incident. After he found Meyers, he offered to pay him and let him complete an interview according to his script. Meyers had always been loyal to bar?a. After reading the script, he found that such an interview was very beneficial to bar?a. Moreover, he would be paid, so he readily agreed.

Now, according to The Sports Daily’s statement, he was the mastermind behind all this. Pablo only had a flaw in his business. Although he had resigned, it would not be difficult for him to find a similar job.

Besides, Mayers had nowhere to vent his anger. He couldn’t tell the media that Pablo had ordered him to do all this and that he was just doing it for money!

In this way, not only would he not be able to clear his name, but he would also be charged with collecting money.

Therefore, when Mayes saw the reporters, he was naturally even more furious.

After reading the report, Xia ruofei finally smiled. He had been waiting for this kind of tabloid report.

Although the Spain tabloid reporters were not as powerful as the United Kingdom paparazzi, their ability to dig up information could not be underestimated.

Xia ruofei smiled as he memorized the main points of the report.

Then, he took his phone and gave Zhou leiyun a call.

“President Xia, have you finished reading the statement from Barcelona?” Zhou leiyun asked with a smile.

“I’ve seen it. ” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”he’s as cold as ever. Even when he’s admitting his mistake, he still gives people a feeling that he’s too high to reach!”

“Your description is too accurate!” Zhou leiyun said,”I just can’t stand the way their father is the best in the world. It’s as if we were the ones who got F * cked last weekend and not them!”

Although Zhou leiyun’s words were crude, they were very fitting of his identity as the owner of a Spanish club.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,””The universe team’s name isn’t just for show ... Let’s not talk about them. Since bar?a has made a statement, then our club should also make an official response!”

“Alright! They’ve already prepared the news release for this side. ” Zhou leiyun said,”I’ll get someone to send it to you to check!”

“I won’t be looking at the draft!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”the club has professionals to handle this kind of official thing. I can’t do anything even if I do it!”

“That’s true ...” Zhou leiyun said,”then ... When do you think the press conference will be held?”

“How about 9 am tomorrow morning?” Xia ruofei said,”I will participate! Get them to inform as many media outlets as possible!”

“Alright! I’ll personally follow up on this matter!” Zhou leiyun said.

After Xia ruofei hung up the phone, he stayed in his Room to Read the news. The afternoon passed quickly.

Ling Qingxue and Song Wei did not plan to go out today. They had gone to Dani hark training base in the morning to accompany Xia ruofei, so they rested in their rooms in the afternoon.

After dinner, Xia ruofei accompanied his two girlfriends to the nearby streets for a walk before returning to the hotel early.

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue were still staying in the same room. Xia ruofei was used to it, so he greeted them in the corridor and went back to his room alone.

They did not know that in the dead of the night, Xia ruofei had deftly avoided the cameras and left the hotel quietly ...

The next morning, Zhou leiyun rushed to the hotel and had breakfast with Xia ruofei and the other two. Then, Xia ruofei and the rest took Zhou leiyun’s car to Dani hark base, where the press conference would be held.

Zhou leiyun personally accompanied Xia ruofei to show that he valued Xia ruofei. He would not personally attend the press conference. It was enough for the club’s management to attend.

As a major shareholder of the club, Xia ruofei did not need to attend the press conference. However, Xia ruofei had requested to attend. In addition, he had another identity, which was a player of Espanyol. He had also experienced the “fountain” period, so it was reasonable for him to attend the press conference.

The car drove straight to the venue of the press conference. It was just past eighto’ clock. There was still some time before the press conference would start. Zhou leiyun brought Xia ruofei and the other two to the lounge next to the press conference.

Zhou leiyun, Song Wei, and Ling Qingxue would be staying in the waiting room for the press conference. They could watch the live feed of the press conference from the television.

The press officer of the club, Louise, and the Executive Vice President, Jiang Xiaochen, who was also Zhou leiyun’s agent in the club, were present at the press conference. He had a lot of power in the club, and even the General Manager did not dare to refute his opinions easily.

When Xia ruofei and the others arrived, Jiang Xiaochen and Louise were already waiting in the lounge.

“Is everything ready?” Zhou leiyun asked.

Jiang Xiaochen nodded and said,”the invitation was sent out yesterday. The media in Spain big and small, are very interested. In addition, some of the domestic media now have people in charge of the news of our Spanish club. They will also attend. Today, reporters from about 50 media outlets will definitely be coming.” All of our preparation work has been completed. We’re just waiting for the meeting at nineo’ clock!”
