2713 Falling down (1)

Wang Boshan was still immersed in the excitement and anticipation of making a great contribution and did not feel anything unusual. He saw Zheng Yongshou stop and couldn’t help but say,””Martial uncle Zheng, I think it’s quite peaceful ... It’s impossible for them to discover us!” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Zheng Yongshou looked around and said with a serious face,””It’s because it’s too quiet that I feel something’s wrong. In addition ... How long have we been walking?”

“How long?” Wang Boshan was stunned for a moment. He calculated silently and his expression changed slightly,”more than ten minutes!”

“How big is this Island? With our speed, we can cross the entire Island from the West to the East Coast in ten minutes! But what about us now?” Zheng Yongshou said.

Wang Boshan looked at the surrounding environment and looked at the distant buildings. He finally realized that something was wrong.

His voice trembled as he said,”martial uncle Zheng, we ... We seem to have been staying in the same place!” But ... We’re walking in a straight line! Why ...”

“If I’m not wrong, we’ve already fallen into a very advanced formation!” Zheng Yongshou said with a serious expression.

“How is that possible?” Wang Boshan lost his voice,”with uncle-master’s array Dao level, what level of array could make you fall into it without being aware? This ...”

Zheng Yongshou’s face turned green as he said,”there’s something strange about this Island!” We can’t walk around aimlessly now ... Otherwise, we’ll definitely sink deeper and deeper!”

“Martial uncle Zheng ...” Wang Boshan said in a trembling voice,”could it be ... That the natural array on this Island was suddenly activated?”

“Impossible!” Zheng Yongshou growled in a low voice,”I’ve observed this array from the outside. Although I can’t be sure what kind of array it is, it’s of a very high level! It was already a miracle that a natural formation of this level could take shape. How could it activate on its own? It must have been modified by a cultivator!”

“This ... This ...” Wang Boshan was confused after hearing it.

Zheng Yongshou said with a gloomy face,”Boshan, we’ve all been wrong!” That Xia ruofei...He’s playing the pig to eat the Tiger!”

“You’re saying ... He’s a cultivator?” Wang Boshan looked as if he had seen a ghost and said,”that’s impossible! We’ve all had direct contact with him! There’s no trace of a cultivation aura on his body. ”

“There’s only one possibility, and that is that his cultivation has far surpassed both of us ...” Zheng Yongshou said in a deep voice.

“This is even more impossible! How old is he?” Wang Boshan said,”even if he started cultivating in his mother’s womb, it’s impossible ... It’s impossible for him to have a higher cultivation than you!”

Zheng Yongshou also showed a trace of hesitation and said,””Logically speaking, with his age ... The cultivation environment on earth was already very poor when he was born. No matter how talented he is, it’s impossible for his cultivation speed to be so fast ...”

“Yup! Martial uncle Zheng, let’s not scare ourselves!” Wang Boshan quickly said,”and you want to! If his cultivation base is really far beyond ours, why would he go through so much trouble? He could have taken us down a few days ago in the capital ...”

“But, this place is indeed strange, and it’s very likely to be a trapping array ...” Zheng Yongshou said with a frown.

Wang Boshan thought for a moment and said,”martial uncle Zheng, do you think there’s such a possibility ... There were cultivators who lived on this Island many years ago. Was this array left behind?” It’s not the natural formation ...”

As Wang Boshan spoke up to this point, he suddenly recalled the rainbow light that benilatti had mentioned and quickly added,””Also, didn’t benilatti say that there was a rainbow light the day before yesterday? Could it be that the birth of a spirit item triggered this formation? According to him, the fey appeared around here. Xia ruofei might have been lucky not to get caught up in it, and this area is deserted, so no one noticed it?”

Zheng Yongshou pondered for a long time before saying,””That’s indeed a possibility ... Boshan, if that’s the case, then our luck is really bad! Of all the places to enter the island, why did he choose this side ...”

Wang Boshan didn’t dare to speak. It was Zheng Yongshou’s own decision to go to the island from the west side. He was only following orders. How could he dare to use this to provoke bad luck now?

Zheng Yongshou took a deep breath and said,””No matter what, let’s think of a way to escape from this formation first before we think about our next step!”

With that, Zheng Yongshou took out a compass from his backpack and carefully used it to determine the direction and find a breakthrough in the array.

Wang Boshan knew nothing about arrays, so he could only wait anxiously on the side. He didn’t dare to leave Zheng Yongshou’s side. He knew that he was trapped in the array and was afraid that if he was even a little further away from Zheng Yongshou, he would be completely separated by the array. He didn’t even dare to imagine facing the array alone.

Zheng Yongshou measured with the compass for a long time with a solemn expression, then took three steps forward to the right with some uncertainty. Wang Boshan also followed him step by step.

Then Zheng Yongshou used the compass to test for a long time before continuing to move forward.

The two of them carefully tossed and turned for almost half an hour before Zheng Yongshou let out a long breath and said,””Boshan, it seems like our guess was right. This is just an ordinary trapping array. It’s still far from the level of the natural array.”

“Martial uncle Zheng, you mean ... We’ve already walked out of the formation?” Wang Boshan asked with uncertainty.
