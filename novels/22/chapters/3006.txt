Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”don’t worry, sect leader mu. I’ve even accepted the spiritual stones. How can I go back on my word?” I promise I’ll get the firecloud pill before you leave the star Seizer sect!”

“Thank you! Thank you!” Mu Sheng said.

“Thank you, brother Xia!” Mu Jianfei also said sincerely.

Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand.””Brother Jianfei, you don’t have to be so polite. It’s only right to do things after being paid!”

“You won’t be able to buy firecloud pills even if you have spirit stones elsewhere.” Mu Sheng said,”this is not just a deal for us! The entire Cang lang sect will remember little brother Xia’s kindness!”

“Sect master mu, you’re too kind ...” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Didn’t Chen Xuan promise to give you a spot to explore the secret of the five sacred medallions?” Mu Sheng smiled and said,”our surging waves sect is also qualified to explore this secret. When the time comes, if little brother Xia personally goes out, I’ll be responsible for your safety! If it’s any other fellow Daoist from your star Seizer sect, the surging waves sect will definitely take care of him!”

“Then I’ll thank sect leader mu in advance!” Xia ruofei said.

Luo Qingfeng led the group of people into zhaixing tower.

This was the star Seizer sect’s most important location. On the second floor, there were even guest rooms specially set up to receive important guests, with dedicated staff providing 24 hours of service.

Luo Qingfeng arranged for Mu Sheng and the other two to stay in the guest rooms, then led Xia ruofei straight to the top floor.

This kind of ancient building naturally did not have an elevator, but for cultivators, even the stairs were a burden. Luo Qingfeng directly brought Xia ruofei to the 10th floor on his flying sword. The reason why he brought Xia ruofei was naturally to hide it from Mu Sheng and the others. Since everyone had misunderstood that Xia ruofei was a Qi refining cultivator, then let this misunderstanding continue. Who knew when it would have an unexpected effect!

In the entire star Seizer sect, only Luo Qingfeng, the sect leader, had the right to ride a flying sword in the star Seizer tower. Anyone else who dared to do so would be sentenced to death.

Of course, this was a rule in the past. Now, the star Seizer sect only had Luo Qingfeng, the only remaining golden core cultivator, and no one else could fly on a sword.

The 10th floor of star picking tower was a forbidden area in the entire star picking sect. It was a floor that was exclusively used by Luo Qingfeng, the sect leader.

The entire floor was huge, at least a thousand square meters.

There were specialized book rooms, cultivation rooms, pill refining rooms, weapon refining rooms, and so on set up here. The functions were very complete.

However, the star Seizer sect’s heritage had withered over the past 300 years. As the sect leader, Luo Qingfeng was not very proficient in refining medicine, elixirs, or weapons. He basically had no use for those rooms.

Luo Qingfeng asked the disciples who were serving on this floor to leave. Then, he said to Xia ruofei respectfully,””Master, it’s getting late. You should go and rest!”

Xia ruofei smiled and shook his head,”take me to the place where the medicine is being refined.” Since you’ve already taken the spirit stones, you’d better refine the firecloud pill as soon as possible, or else this matter will always be on your mind!”

“Yes! Master!” “This way, please!” Luo Qingfeng said quickly.

With that, Luo Qingfeng brought Xia ruofei to the alchemy room on the tenth floor with ease.

Although Luo Qingfeng might not even come here once a year, there were still disciples in charge of cleaning the house every day. The house was almost spotless.

Xia ruofei looked around the room and realized that the commonly used herbs were kept in stock. The equipment used to refine medicine was complete and of high quality.

Of course, Xia ruofei could also tell that these things had not been used much. It seemed that it was a waste to leave them with Luo Qingfeng.

“Master, take a look and see if there’s anything else you need.” Luo Qingfeng asked,”I’ll get someone to prepare it immediately!”

Xia ruofei waved his hand.”The firecloud pill is not a complicated pill. These are enough. Even if I’m missing one or two ingredients, I have some!” Don’t bother those disciples in the middle of the night. ”

“Yes! Master!” Luo Qingfeng said.

“Master, if you don’t need this old servant to serve you, then this old servant will take his leave first?” he asked carefully.

Luo Qingfeng did this to avoid suspicion. After all, the firecloud pill was nothing much to Xia ruofei. In fact, it was a very precious medicine in the world of cultivation. One firecloud pill at this auction was worth 1000 spiritual stones, which was evident. Moreover, Mu Sheng didn’t even choose Wu Ming’s 80000 spiritual stones. Instead, he chose Xia ruofei’s proposal of 50000 spiritual stones and the firecloud pill, which further highlighted the value of the firecloud pill.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,””No need! If I can’t even fully trust you, then who else can I trust?” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

In theory, Luo Qingfeng, who was controlled by the soul seal, was even more reliable than Li Yifu.

Xia ruofei continued,”you can stay and see!” If I can learn it, it’ll be a good way to make money. ”

Luo Qingfeng shed tears of gratitude and said with a choked voice,””This old servant thanks master!”

Xia ruofei took out a pen and paper from the spirit map space and wrote down the formula and the refining method of the fire cloud pill. Then, he handed it to Luo Qingfeng.

Xia ruofei said,”write down the contents first and then help me prepare the ingredients!” By the way, do you know how to identify medicinal ingredients?”

“Of course!” Luo Qingfeng quickly replied,”normal herbs are no problem!” If it’s too rare ...”
