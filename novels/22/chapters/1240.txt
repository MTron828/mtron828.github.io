Chapter 1241: Not taking the usual path (2)

Translator: 549690339

When Blake realized this, a smile appeared on his face.

He felt that he had grasped Xia ruofei’s weakness. He even regretted not bidding. He felt embarrassed to be scared by a mere 500000 dollars.

At this time, the second piece of white truffle was put up on the auction stage.

It was a 1.2 – kilogram piece of white truffle, and the starting price was also 100000 dollars.

When Lu zhongguang announced the start of the auction, before anyone else could bid, Blake raised the sign in his hand and shouted,”” 250000 dollars!”

Xia ruofei also raised his board without hesitation.” 300000 dollars!”

” 350 thousand dollars!” Blake also raised his sign and shouted fearlessly.

The others who were originally very interested in the truffle could not help but smile bitterly when they saw this.

Before they could bid, the holder of the truffle was already competing with others and raising the price to the sky.

Backstage, Feng Rao was also burning with anxiety. She had already realized the problem that Blake had thought of.

In this endless competition, the one who would be hurt was the Paradise Corporation! Not only did he lose a lot of benefits, but more importantly, his reputation was also greatly damaged!

Besides, Blake didn’t have to worry at all. At most, he would return empty – handed, but he could still mess up a press conference and turn paradise Corporation into a joke.

Feng Jing didn’t believe that Xia ruofei would be so brainless. She was worried that Xia ruofei would lose his cool and not realize the stakes.

In fact, Xia ruofei’s performance was similar to Feng Rao’s judgment.

The trend of the truffle auction was exactly the same as the previous one.

After Blake called out the price of 350000 dollars, Xia ruofei immediately called out the price of 500000 dollars without any hesitation.

The difference was that Blake wasn’t scared this time. He just kept the bidding card in his hand and didn’t plan to put it down.

” 600000 dollars!” Blake said proudly.

The buyers in the audience thought that these two people were crazy. The White truffle was worth at most 200000 dollars, but they were outbid by three times the original price.

How could they buy things happily like this?

The first time, everyone felt that it was a little interesting and had the mentality of watching a show. However, the second time was still the same. It was just the two of them fighting, and the others had no room to bid at all.

The buyers who really wanted to buy a few truffles were starting to feel unhappy.

” 700000!” Xia ruofei called out indifferently without changing his expression.

” 800 thousand dollars!” Blake felt that he had caught Xia ruofei’s weakness and was fearless. He looked at Xia ruofei like a cat teasing a mouse and continued to bid.

” 900000 US dollars!” Xia ruofei’s expression turned ugly.

Blake was overjoyed. He immediately raised his sign and shouted,”” 950 thousand dollars!”

After the bidding, Blake said in his heart,””I’ll round it up for you. I’ll stop when you call for one million dollars. This truffle will end here. Let’s take it slow. I’ll see how you can continue this auction! Wouldn’t those super – rich people be so angry that they left early? Hahaha ...”

Just as Blake was fantasizing, he saw many people’s eyes focused on him.

What was going on?

Blake felt that something was wrong, but he couldn’t figure out what it was. He just felt that something was missing.

Something is missing ... Blake suddenly realized that Xia ruofei had not bid yet!

He quickly stood up and looked at Xia ruofei.

Blake’s seat was in the back row, so he could only see the back of Xia ruofei’s head from his side.

She saw Xia ruofei talking to Monica in a low voice, and the two of them laughed.

Although he couldn’t see his face, one thing was for sure. He didn’t seem to have any intention of raising the price.

Blake suddenly felt a burst of cold sweat on his body. He couldn’t help but shout,”Chinese man, why did you stop bidding?”

Xia ruofei stood up slowly and turned around to look at Blake. He smiled and asked,””Why should I bid?”

“You ... Didn’t you just say that you wouldn’t let me buy a piece of truffle?” Blake’s voice even trembled a little.”How can you go back on your word?”

The guests and buyers in the auction hall couldn’t help but laugh at Blake’s words. Do you think the auction is a game for children? You’re also an adult in your twenties. Do you believe what others say?

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh. “Can’t I suddenly change my mind?”

Blake felt like he was struck by lightning.

You can’t play like this! How could the Chinese be so untrustworthy? He changed just like that? The White truffle was only worth 250000 dollars at most. Now, under the bidding of the other party, he had raised the price to 950000 dollars without any hesitation. That was almost enough to buy four truffles like this!

The money was not the most important thing. It was almost a million dollars, which was still affordable for Blake. At most, he would feel a little bit of pain, but the matter was not that simple.

His status in the family was not as good as his brothers, and he was also ranked lower in the position of the heir. Moreover, he had screwed up two business deals in a row some time ago, and the family had been criticizing him greatly.

If he bought a white truffle worth at most 250000 dollars at an auction for 950000 dollars, he didn’t know what kind of storm he would face in his family when the news spread back to France!

Blake panicked, and he shouted in both shock and anger,”You ... You’re raising the price with malicious intent! You’re the owner of this batch of truffles, so your bid is invalid!”

Xia ruofei looked at Blake as if he was an idiot and said,””I don’t want to explain the same question a second time! The law will tell you whether my offer is valid or not!”

Then, Xia ruofei glanced at the buyers who were watching the show and said,””Also, you can say that I’m raising the price maliciously, but I have to make it clear that this is entirely directed at you! To put it bluntly! You’re an unwelcome character in our paradise Corporation! I will not participate in the normal bidding of other buyers!”

Blake gritted his teeth and glared at Xia ruofei as if he wanted to eat him up.

Xia ruofei laughed coldly without a care. He turned to look at the stage and said to Lu zhongguang,””Mr. Lu, I think you can start the countdown ...”

Lu zhongguang finally came back to his senses. This was the second time he had been distracted on the stage.

The main reason was that the auction process today was too unusual. Even Lu zhongguang, who was used to big scenes, felt a little frightened.

Lu zhongguang looked at Blake sympathetically and then started to perform his duty.””Number 184, Mr. Blake, has bid 950000 dollars for this white truffle. Is there anyone else who wants to bid higher?”

This was just a routine. With this price, even if one’s head was clamped by a door, it was impossible to increase the price.

Lu zhongguang waited for a while before he started the countdown.”” 950000 dollars going once ... 950000 dollars going twice ... 950000 dollars ... Going three times!”

The auction mallet slammed down heavily!

“Deal!” Lu zhongguang said,”congratulations, Mr. Blake, for successfully winning the bid for the 1.2 – kilogram white truffle!” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Blake didn’t feel anything to be happy about. He felt like all the strength in his body had been sucked out, and he sat down on the chair weakly.

His performance today was too clumsy, like a big fool who had been played in the palm of someone else’s hand.

He thought that he had found Xia ruofei’s weakness, but he did not expect that Xia ruofei had already planned this. The funny thing was that he had foolishly jumped into the trap.

Now, Blake felt that he was a complete fool ...
