1953 Promotion by half a rank (2)

“Don’t worry about that, President Xia!” Zeng jianzhang said,”after the specific land acquisition area is mapped out, the county will handle it. Just wait to receive the land! We also hope that the Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory can start production as soon as possible!”

“Then I’ll leave it to everyone!” Xia ruofei said,”Secretary Zeng, County Head Zhu, County Head Wu, we’ll take our leave first!”

Xia ruofei winked at Wu Liqian, and Wu Liqian smiled.

Zeng jianzhang and the others personally sent Xia ruofei and the others out of the hotel. They waved and watched as Xia ruofei and the others left in their commercial vehicle before they turned around and walked back.

In the hotel lobby, Zeng jianzhang affectionately said,””County Head Wu, it’s all thanks to you that this matter was so successful!”

“Secretary Zeng, you’re too kind!” Wu Liqian smiled and said,”it’s all because of the trust of the leaders and the cooperation of the comrades that we were able to close this project in such a short time! I didn’t make any personal contributions!”

At a time like this, she should be polite and humble. Anyway, no one could take her credit and achievements away.

Zeng jianzhang smiled and looked at Zhu zhihang, saying,””County Head Zhu, in the future, you should recommend more capable and humble officials like County Head Wu to our party Committee!”

“Secretary Zeng, County Head Wu is my most capable subordinate!” Zhu zhihang forced a smile. You’re stealing my girl without saying a word. It’s hard for the government to carry out their work!”

Wu Liqian was confused when she saw the first and second – in – command teasing her. She couldn’t help but ask,””What are the two leaders talking about? I don’t understand what you’re saying. ”

Zeng jianzhang and Zhu zhihang looked at each other, then laughed and said,”County Head Wu, County Head Zhu has some opinions! It’s like this, didn’t Liu haojun resign from his position? “Right now, the party Committee is lacking a Deputy Secretary. After discussing with County Head Zhu, I recommended you to the higher – ups, hoping to give you more responsibilities. The city has already agreed to our recommendation in principle, so you can take care of the work at hand in the next two days and be ready to hand it over at any time!”

“Me?” Wu Liqian’s eyes widened.”Isn’t this a little too sudden?”

Liu haojun had been forced to resign after the scandal. At first, Wu Liqian just felt relaxed because she didn’t have to face his endless pestering. She didn’t think about fighting for the position of the Deputy Secretary. After all, she had been the executive Deputy County Head for less than three years. A Deputy Secretary was equivalent to the third in command. Such an important position shouldn’t have been hers.

She didn’t expect that this position would fall into her hands even though she didn’t fight for it. This was an unexpected surprise.

Zeng jianzhang smiled and said,”the position is vacant now, but someone has to do the work, right?” Also, with County Head Wu’s ability and prestige, he’s the most suitable candidate to take over. That’s why I don’t think it’s sudden at all!”

“Thank you for your trust!” Wu Liqian said. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

No one wouldn’t want to keep improving in their career. Since she was given a more important position, she couldn’t refuse it.

Although the Deputy Secretary and the executive deputy head of the county were of the same rank, they were ranked differently in the team. The importance of the two positions naturally had a difference.

Wu Liqian had been promoted to the Deputy County Head position in just one or two years, which could be considered a promotion.

Zeng jianzhang waved his hand and said,”it’s mainly because you’ve done well in your work!” “County Head Wu, although the project contract has been signed, the working group can not be disbanded. It can be used as a temporary part – time organization. Normally, the comrades should go back and divide the daily tasks. If the working group needs anything, you can call everyone together at any time. The task of this Working Group is still to coordinate with the peach blossom company. The construction period of the entire project will take at least a few months. During this period, there will definitely be a lot of things that need to be coordinated. How was it? Do you have the confidence to complete the mission?”

“No problem!” Wu Liqian said. Secretary, please rest assured! However, Secretary Zeng, I have a request ...”

“Do you still want to go back and continue your training?” Zeng jianzhang chuckled and said,”County Head Zhu has already told me about this. We respect your personal wishes. If you want to go back and continue your studies, there’s definitely no problem. It’s just that you’ll have to work harder when you’re studying. Other work can be handed over to other Deputy County heads, but you still have to take on the responsibility of the work group. You can remotely command them through email or phone!”

“Alright! Secretary Zeng, don’t worry! I won’t delay my family’s work!” Wu Liqian said happily,”also, the training course will only last for two months. I’ll be back soon!”

Zeng jianzhang said meaningfully,”I’m just afraid that you won’t be able to come back after the training!” Such an outstanding female cadre, if she is fancied by any Ministry ...”

“I think that’s very likely!” Zhu zhihang also said.

Wu Liqian smiled.”Don’t worry, leaders. I’m not going anywhere. I’ll go back to Changping after the training!”

“We will remember your promise!” Zeng jianzhang said,”then we’ll wait for you to come back after you finish your studies!”
