Chapter 1647: The negotiation (1)

“Ruofei,” Zhao Yongjun said with a smile,”I didn’t expect you to be so bad even though you look honest and honest!”

“I also want to successfully get that piece of land!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”who knew that Liu haofan would interfere?”

Zhao Yongjun said,”Xiao Rui will be very happy if he knows!” He’s just looking forward to killing Liu er!”

“Hahaha ...” Xia ruofei laughed heartily.

“Then we’ll hold back for the time being!” Zhao Yongjun said,”ruofei, don’t rush back! If we really manage to get this piece of land, you have to solve the problem with the formation immediately!”

“Don’t worry!” Xia ruofei said,”I won’t leave unless there are special circumstances!”

For the next few days, Xia ruofei lived in seclusion. He found peace in the liuhai Lane courtyard and lived a leisurely life.

During this period, he also invited Song Wei over. The two of them cultivated together twice, and Song Wei’s cultivation finally broke through to Qi disciple Level 3. She was getting closer and closer to the cultivation level required to solve the problem of the peach blossom miasma.

Also, Xia ruofei went to visit elder song.

Other than that, Xia ruofei spent most of his time in the courtyard house. He was either making tea in the courtyard or watching a blockbuster in the professional recording room. He almost never left the house.

Of course, even if he stayed behind closed doors, Xia ruofei was still very familiar with the situation outside. Zhao Yongjun and the others would talk to Xia ruofei almost once a day to tell him about the situation with the land that Tang real estate had sold.

Just as Xia ruofei had expected, although Tang real estate had spread the news that they intended to sell the land in little Tang town and hinted that there was room for negotiation on the price, the effect was very limited.

In the beginning, there were still a few companies that wanted to take advantage of the situation. However, these real estate companies were not fools. They were also wary of the rumors on the internet a few days ago, so although they were a little tempted, they were also quite cautious.

Almost all of these companies had sent fengshui experts to inspect the town. Some of the more high – Level so – called cultural environment consultants naturally found the problem quickly, and these companies quickly ceased their activities.

The cultural environment consultants hired by several companies were half – baked. Although they could not find the problem immediately, the aura of the land was very uncomfortable. Even ordinary people who were slightly more sensitive, such as Chen Dazhuang, would feel uncomfortable as soon as they stepped into the range of the array. Therefore, these Fengshui specialists also gave advice to the company to be cautious. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

In the end, Tang real estate wanted to sell the land at a lower price, but there were few people who agreed.

This made Liu haofan both shocked and angry. If this continued, this piece of land would really be in his hands.

With his background, he could withdraw the funds from this project without losing a single cent, and Tang real estate would not dare to say anything, but it would be too embarrassing, and his reputation would be ruined.

However, if this continued, although the money he invested wasn’t a lot, it was still tens of millions. It would basically go to waste. This piece of land in Xuanji basically couldn’t be used for any other purpose other than to build a Cemetery. It could only be left abandoned there.

Zhao Yongjun and the others discussed it with Xia ruofei and felt that it was the right time, so Zhao Yongjun made an inquiry to Tang real estate in the name of their temporary Hengrui company.

Only Zhao Yongjun was suitable to step in. He wasn’t like Xia ruofei and song Rui. He and Liu haofan weren’t at daggers drawn yet, and he had enough prestige.

Zhou Tianyu from Tang was worried sick. As soon as he received the report of the company’s inquiry, he immediately instructed his employees to contact the other party and said that the price was negotiable. It was best for everyone to sit down and discuss it.

At the same time, Zhou Tianyu immediately called Liu haofan to make sure he knew who the boss behind Hengrui was. Whether it was Zhao Yongjun or Liu haofan, he and Tang real estate couldn’t afford to offend them, so he naturally had to talk to Liu haofan.

Originally, Zhou Tianyu was worried that Liu haofan’s temper would flare up. He would rather keep the land in his hands than trade with Zhao Yongjun and the others.

He didn’t expect Liu haofan to agree without much hesitation after hearing that. He even expressed that he would personally participate in the negotiations.

Recently, Liu haofan had been troubled by the matter of the land. As long as he could get rid of it quickly, he didn’t care who took over the land!

Besides, song Rui also had a share in Hengrui. If he really took over, it might be a good thing for him. Liu haofan was still waiting to see song Rui make a fool of himself! He firmly believed that if song Rui and the others bought the land, they would not be able to solve the Feng Shui Bureau’s problem. In the end, no matter how much money they invested, it would definitely be for naught.

Thus, the two sides quickly agreed to discuss the details of the land transfer in front of the Tang real estate company at 10 am the next day.

Zhao Yongjun explained the situation to Xia ruofei, and he immediately decided to participate in the negotiations.

That night, Zhao Yongjun and song Rui came to Xia ruofei’s courtyard house.

Liu Jian and the others did not come this time, including when he activated the formation. Xia ruofei did not let them participate as they did not know much about this matter. Hence, Xia ruofei simply let them stay out of it so that they would not offend Liu haofan.
