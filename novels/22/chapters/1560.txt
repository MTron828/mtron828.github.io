Chapter 1561: A different gift (2)

Translator: 549690339

The spiritual body did not expect the miasma to have any effect on Xia ruofei. For a cultivator whose spiritual power cultivation had reached the spirit palpitations stage, it was only a matter of time before the miasma was completely removed.

Xia ruofei sat cross – legged on the bed, and time passed.

Xia ruofei finally opened his eyes when the clock on the wall pointed to one in the morning.

The peach blossom miasma in his body had been completely destroyed by the double strangulation of his mental power and genuine Qi. His mind had naturally recovered.

Although the evil poison in his body had been completely expelled, Xia ruofei was still in great trouble.

It was not difficult to get rid of the peach blossom miasma in his body, but it was troublesome for Song Wei.

The peach blossom miasma was different from ordinary poisons. The essential Qi had little effect on it. Moreover, it could infect the soul. Even if he used his own spiritual power, he must use his own spiritual power. If someone else’s spiritual power seeped in from the outside, it would never be completely synchronized with the soul. This meant that even if Xia ruofei’s spiritual power was stronger, it would be difficult to completely expel the peach blossom miasma from Song Wei.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but think hard.

The hands of the clock on the wall moved quietly. Time passed by but Xia ruofei still could not come up with a feasible plan.

In the end, he still decided to discuss it with Xia Qing.

After Song Wei was poisoned by the peach blossom miasma, Xia ruofei sealed off the spirit map space from the outside world almost immediately.

Although Xia Qing was only a spiritual puppet, Xia ruofei saw her as no different from a normal human being. Furthermore, there was a mischievous realm Fox in the medium. He did not want Xia Qing or the realm Fox to see Song Wei’s seductive look!

Xia ruofei used his divine sense to communicate with the space and explained the situation in a few words. Then he asked,””Xia Qing, you should also help think of a good way to deal with this peach blossom miasma ...”

Xia Qing couldn’t help but reveal a trace of embarrassment as she fell into deep thought.

Xia ruofei also knew that this matter would not be so easy, so he did not disturb Xia Qing. He also quietly thought of a solution.

“Master,” Xia Qing said after a long time,”the plan now ... Can only be done from two aspects.”

“Oh? What two – pronged approach?” Xia ruofei’s eyes were filled with hope.

“First of all, it is naturally to expel the peach blossom miasma from miss song’s body as much as possible.” Xia Qing said,”the main trouble of this thing is the poison that has contaminated the soul. As for the other peach blossom miasma that is distributed in the body, with master’s spiritual power cultivation, he should be able to expel it.”

Xia ruofei nodded.”That’s not a problem. It’s just a temporary solution.”

The peach blossom miasma had a strong regenerative ability, so it was meaningless not to get rid of it completely.

Xia Qing said,”that’s why we have to work on two fronts!” In addition to getting rid of the peach blossom miasma as much as possible, master can try to think of a way from the array Dao ...”

Xia Qing’s words enlightened Xia ruofei. His eyes lit up and he said,””The three stinky leathers are indeed better than Zhuge Liang! Why didn’t I think of array Dao! Let me think ... I can set up a double formation that can suppress the poison in the soul while calming the mind!”

Xia ruofei had studied such array patterns in the ancient array books. However, it was slightly more difficult. To perfectly combine two arrays, it was basically as difficult as a level three array. With Xia ruofei’s current array skills and spiritual power cultivation, it was not a problem to set up a level two array. It would be difficult for him to set up a level three array.

However, Xia ruofei was not afraid. Instead, he was full of fighting spirit.

As long as there was a way to solve this peach blossom miasma, what was a little difficulty that couldn’t be overcome? If the first time didn’t work, he would try twice. At most, he would set up a time array with array flags and keep trying!

However, Xia ruofei quickly recovered from his excitement. He smiled bitterly and said,””Xia Qing, in the end ... This is the same as treating the symptoms but not the root cause! Blindly suppressing him would not solve the problem! Besides, the miasma can regenerate. If I can’t get rid of it completely, I’ll have to expel the miasma from Song Wei regularly ...”

Xia Qing also frowned. This was the best solution he could think of at the moment. To completely get rid of the peach blossom miasma that had been contaminated by the soul, there was no other way except for Song Wei herself. Because everyone’s soul was unique, outsiders could not achieve complete synchronization. And Song Wei herself did not have any cultivation at all, so she was in an endless cycle ...

Wait a minute! Xia Qing suddenly felt as if she had missed out on some crucial information.

Xia ruofei’s divine sense had been in the space the whole time, and he could clearly feel the change in Xia Qing’s expression. He immediately felt a trace of nervousness and realized that Xia Qing might have thought of a solution.

Sure enough, after frowning and thinking for a moment, Xia Qing said happily,””Master! There’s a way we can try!”

“Hurry up and tell me!” Xia ruofei said impatiently.

“Do you still remember the” absolute beginning Heart Sutra “in the human – shaped jade talisman?” Xia Qing asked.

Xia ruofei quickly searched through his memories. The human – shaped jade talisman contained a large number of ancient books, including cultivation techniques, medical divination, and so on. It could be said that it was all – encompassing. With such a large amount of information, other than the medical knowledge that could be used, Xia ruofei could not possibly digest all of it.

As for the cultivation technique, Xia ruofei already had the top cultivation technique, the great Dao technique. Naturally, he could not cultivate any other techniques.

Therefore, he only learned the “fierce yang Scripture” and did not know anything else about these cultivation methods. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

He had learned the “fierce yang Scripture” in order to pass it on to his first disciple, Tang Haoran.

After Xia Qing’s reminder, Xia ruofei quickly found the “absolute beginning Heart Sutra” and quickly browsed through its contents.

The joy on Xia ruofei’s face became more and more obvious. Xia Qing was like an Encyclopedia. There were so many ancient books and techniques, and he had really found a technique that had a high chance of solving the problem.

The level of the “absolute beginning Heart Sutra” was definitely not as high as the “great Dao Sutra”, but it was kept in the human jade talisman by the previous owner of the space, so it naturally had its own unique points.

The biggest feature of this cultivation method was that two people could cultivate it together, and at the same time, both spiritual power and true Qi.

Every time they cultivated, the two of them had to be together, and the circulation route of the cultivation method was also connected with each other. The true Qi would flow from one person’s body to the other, and through a specific Meridian, it would make a circle.

This cultivation technique seemed to be of little value because it had too many limitations. Unless it was a couple or husband and wife who lived with each other all day long, it was really inconvenient to cultivate it. After all, it could not be done without anyone. One person could not cultivate it alone. It was impossible to even complete a Qi circulation.

However, for Xia ruofei and Song Wei, this technique had an irreplaceable advantage even the great way of Dao. After they had successfully cultivated it, they could circulate the technique together and their souls would gradually synchronize. Although it was impossible to be absolutely synchronized in theory, it should be enough to get rid of the peach blossom miasma.

And if Song Wei cultivated the “absolute beginning Heart Sutra”, she would also have her own spiritual power cultivation. To expel the peach blossom miasma, it would be another layer of protection. It was simply killing two birds with one stone.

Xia ruofei quickly made up his mind. He knew that the only hope to completely get rid of the Spirit’s last vicious move was on this “Scripture of the primordial heart”...
