2081 Return (2)

After lunch, Xia ruofei did not leave the house. He strolled around the farm, looked at the greenhouse and the Pomfret cultivation workshop, and then went back to the villa to take a nap.

After he woke up, he tidied up a little and went to the cafeteria for dinner.

Xia ruofei did not see Feng Jing when the employee bus returned to the farm.

Feng Jing still lived on the farm, but the company’s Affairs were complicated. As the president, it was normal for her to work overtime, so she rarely got off work on time.

Of course, all the higher – ups in the company had their own cars, so it was convenient for her to come back whenever she wanted. Besides, if she worked overtime too late, she could spend the night in the office. Her office was second only to Xia ruofei’s huge office, and it also had its own big bedroom.

Initially, Xia ruofei wanted to talk to Feng Jing about the company’s current situation. However, seeing that she wasn’t back yet, he could only drop the idea and wait until he went to the company tomorrow.

At night, Xia ruofei watched TV in the living room for a while and left the small villa at around 10 O’ clock.

He went to the pivotal water tower in the farm and the water tower in the pomfrets cultivation workshop, and added some of the spirit Heart Flower petal solution.

This was something he had to do every once in a while. Only in this way could he ensure that the produced vegetables, Pomfret, and so on were of high quality.

Although the security of the farm was tight and there were brothers from the security team patrolling from time to time, Xia ruofei was skilled enough to complete these tasks without any effort. Very quickly, he added the solution of the spiritual heart Flower petals without anyone noticing. It was not even 11 O’ clock when he returned to the villa.

As he had to go to the company headquarters the next day, Xia ruofei washed up and went to bed early. After his routine cultivation, he fell asleep immediately.

The next morning, he still didn’t see Feng Jing when he was having breakfast at the canteen. Even when the employees at the headquarters in the city left after breakfast, Feng Jing still didn’t appear.

Xia ruofei knew that Feng Jing must have slept in the office again last night, so he got up and left the cafeteria. He drove the Knight XV SUV towards the city.

Although they left later, Xia ruofei arrived at the peach blossom mansion earlier than the company’s bus.

After parking the car in the company’s underground parking lot, Xia ruofei walked to the elevator with his handbag under his arm. He greeted the patrolling veteran and took the elevator to the chairman’s office on the top floor.

Every time Xia ruofei came to this huge office on the top floor, he would feel that it was such a waste. The entire floor was occupied by the chairman’s office, except for a small part of Feng Jing’s office.

And he only came here for a few days all year round, and most of the time he was idle.

However, it was already renovated to this extent, so Xia ruofei could not say anything more. Besides, what Feng Jing said made sense. No matter how high the utilization rate was, the chairman’s office was the face of the company. It could not be too luxurious.

As soon as Xia ruofei got out of the elevator, he saw a young lady sitting behind the desk in front of his office door. The moment she saw Xia ruofei, she quickly stood up and bowed slightly.””Good Morning, Chairman!”

Xia ruofei still had some impression of this lady. If he remembered correctly, she should be a staff member in the president’s office. Her name was Yao Xin.

“Little Yao, what are you doing here?” he asked, slightly surprised.

“Chairman, President Feng asked me to come over,” said Yao Xin quickly.”She said that you’ll be coming to the company today. I’ll be responsible for providing you with protection during your working hours.”

In fact, Yao Xin had been learning from Liu Qian during this period of time. She was basically the “Assistant to the President’s assistant”. Feng Jing had the intention to transfer Liu Qian to a specific position. The position of the president’s assistant couldn’t be empty for even a day, so she selected Yao Xin from the president’s office. Liu Qian used this time to bring Yao Xin out before she could leave. Yao Xin would then take over her position as the president’s assistant.

Feng Jing had received a call from Xia ruofei yesterday and knew that he was coming over today. Hence, she had asked Yao Xin to work for Xia ruofei as an assistant or secretary.

Paradise Corporation had never set up a Board of Directors. They didn’t even have a full – time Secretary for the chairman. Feng Jing had mentioned it a few times, but Xia ruofei felt that there was no need for a Secretary since he wouldn’t be in the company often, so he had rejected her.

After Xia ruofei heard Yao Xin’s words, he slightly nodded and said,””Alright, thank you for your hard work!”

“It’s not hard!” Yao Xin quickly said and pushed open the door to Xia ruofei’s office.

After learning from Liu Qian for a period of time, Yao Xin had already mastered a lot of things to pay attention to when working with the leader.

She had arrived an hour earlier today and had cleaned Xia ruofei’s desk until it was spotless.

In fact, Xia ruofei’s office was cleaned by someone. Otherwise, Yao Xin wouldn’t have been able to clean such a large area. She mainly cleaned the area where Xia ruofei’s desk was.

Yao Xin had also sorted out some documents that needed Xia ruofei’s approval and signature. She arranged them according to their priority and placed them neatly on Xia ruofei’s desk.

After Xia ruofei entered the office, Yao Xin also came in quickly. She made a cup of hot tea for Xia ruofei and gently placed it on his desk.

After Xia ruofei sat down, he naturally picked up the documents on the table and read them. After Yao Xin served tea, Xia ruofei looked up at her and said,””Thank you! Xiao Yao, go and prepare the meeting room. After I’m done talking with CEO Feng, I’ll call for a meeting with the company’s director and higher management. ”

“Alright!” Yao Xin quickly responded and then asked,”Chairman, do you need me to inform President Feng?”

“No need, I’ll give her a call.” Xia ruofei said indifferently.

Not only was Feng Jing Xia ruofei’s most capable subordinate, but her position in the company was only second to Xia ruofei. It was disrespectful to let the Secretary call her.

“Alright!” Yao Xin quickly replied.

After Yao Xin left, Xia ruofei picked up the phone on his desk and called the president’s office.

“Chairman, you’re here for work?” Feng Rao asked with a smile.

“Sister ran, did you sleep in the office again last night?” Xia ruofei half – opened his mouth and laughed.”I’m going to criticize you! You’re being irresponsible to your own body!” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Just because I’m sleeping in the office doesn’t mean that I’ll be working overtime!” Feng Jing said. I’m just too lazy to go back and forth. Besides, the office’s conditions aren’t any worse than the apartment on the farm!”

“No matter how good the conditions are, it’s still an office!” Xia ruofei said,”I don’t want to be called a capitalist who exploited his subordinates!”

“You are!” Feng Jing chuckled and said,”Chairman, I’m not joking. Are you free now? I’m here to report my work. ”

“Come over!” Xia ruofei said.

After a while, Feng Jing knocked on the door and walked into Xia ruofei’s office. She came to see Xia ruofei and naturally didn’t need the Secretary to inform her.

Xia ruofei respected her and stood up to welcome her. He smiled and said,””It’s alright, you look good!”

“That’s a must! You’re the boss who’s out all day, and we’re just employees who earn money for you. How can we mistreat ourselves?” Feng Rao said half – jokingly.

“Your words are not accurate!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you’re also a shareholder of the company, okay? You can’t lose your sense of ownership just because you don’t have many shares!”

Feng Rao chuckled and sat down at Xia ruofei’s desk.

Xia ruofei walked around the desk and sat down at his seat. He opened the drawer and took out an exquisite box. He pushed it in front of Feng Jing and said,””Sister che, I brought you a little gift from Italy this time!”

“At least you still have some conscience!” Feng Jing said happily,”let me see what you bought for me first!”

She put the folder aside, reached for the box, and opened it.
