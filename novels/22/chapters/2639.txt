2640 Full of sincerity (2)

“I’m fine with it!” Xia ruofei nodded and said,”I can make time anytime! Let’s do this! There should be news about the last two herbs I’ve been looking for in the next two days. If the herbs are all gathered, I’ll make a batch of Pills first, and then go to the agate map with uncle Liu. ”

The Liu family had shown enough sincerity. Naturally, Xia ruofei could not delay the treatment with the excuse of insufficient medicinal materials.

Old man Liu revealed a look of joy. He nodded and said,””Then I’ll leave it to you! Tell Kuan to inform the agate map in advance and be ready to set off at any time. ”

“Yes, master!” Liu Kuan still agreed very simply.

Old master Liu asked Xia ruofei kindly,””Xiao Xia, our construction project on blue cloud Island has basically been completed. There are still a few projects in the plan that haven’t started yet. What are your thoughts on the construction? If there is a need to continue the construction, we can also provide assistance. ”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,””As for the current construction project, just finish the finishing touches. As for the subsequent construction, I may have other considerations.”

Old man Liu smiled and nodded.””No problem! There’s not much work left. I’ll get them to retreat after they’re done!”

The construction plan of cyan Cloud Island was formulated by old man Liu based on the position of the Liu family’s last refuge. Xia ruofei did not have a large family to consider. After he took over cyan Cloud Island, he would definitely have his own considerations in the construction. This was very normal, so old man Liu was not surprised.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”thank you!” I’ll bear all the expenses incurred by the finishing touches. ”

“There’s no need for that. The rest is just some cleaning up. Some of the materials that should be purchased have already been purchased in advance, so it won’t cost too much. It’s too troublesome to calculate.” Old man Liu laughed and said,”consider it a friendly gift from us!”

Since it was not a lot of money, Xia ruofei did not reject it too much. He just smiled and expressed his gratitude to old man Liu.

“If that’s the case,” old man Liu continued,”after the ownership transfer, we’ll withdraw some of our people first. The rest of them will gradually come back after they’ve finished cleaning up the few construction projects on hand.”

“Alright, we’ll do as you’ve arranged.” Xia ruofei nodded.

“In addition ...” Old man Liu continued,”the security work of our blue cloud Island is handed over to a mercenary organization. They have two relatively fixed teams, and they will take turns to be stationed on blue cloud Island. They are responsible for the defense and safety of the entire Island.”

Old man Liu paused for a moment before he continued,””What do you plan to do with the guards? If you want to continue to hire these mercenaries, we can help you get in touch with them and sign a new contract. Of course, you can also form your own guard team. ”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,””In the short term, I’ll still rely mainly on mercenaries. However, I should be building my own team of guards. After all, I’m not at ease leaving the safety of the entire Island to mercenaries.”

“That’s fine,” old man Liu said with a smile.”We won’t terminate the contract with that mercenary organization for the time being. Just let us know when you’re done building your own guard team, and we’ll end the contract with the mercenary organization.”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”that’s good. After all, it’s troublesome to sign a new contract.” In this way, after I take over green cloud Island, I will bear the mercenary expenses incurred, and I will transfer the money to you at that time! Elder Liu, you can’t reject this again! I won’t insist if you don’t accept the expenses for the completion of the project, but the cost of hiring a team of guards is not a small amount. I can’t take your blue cloud Island and still want you to pay for the guards. This is unreasonable. ”

Old man Liu chuckled and nodded.””Alright, alright, alright! Then we’ll do as you say! Kuan, do a good job with Xia when the time comes. ”

“Yes, master!” Liu Kuan said.

After making all the arrangements, old man Liu looked tired and said,””Then let’s do this first! I’m going to rest for a while ...”

Hence, Xia ruofei, Liu Qunfeng, and Liu Kuan left elder Liu’s room.

After leaving the house, Liu Kuan said goodbye to Xia ruofei and Liu Qunfeng and went to make arrangements for the matters on the green cloud Island.

Liu Qunfeng turned to Xia ruofei and said,””Mr. Xia, thank you!”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment, then he realized what Liu Qunfeng meant. He smiled and said,””You’re too polite! I have my own reasons for choosing the green cloud Island. Moreover ... I really don’t have much interest in the shares of your family group. ”

“No matter what, you don’t have the option of choosing shares. It’s of great importance to the internal stability of our family. Thank you very much!” Liu Qunfeng said sincerely.

He then said,”Mr. Xia, please give me your account number.” The transfer to the green cloud Island may not be so fast, but we will transfer the cash to you within three days. ”

They had already discussed this, so Xia ruofei did not hold back. He sent his overseas bank account to Liu Qunfeng through text.

Xia ruofei stayed in the Liu family’s residence for two days. Every day, he would routinely check on elder Liu and personally supervise the entire process of taking the medicine. The rest of the time, he would stay in the guest room that was arranged for him.

On the third day, the Liu family’s 500 million dollars had been transferred to Xia ruofei’s overseas bank account. His assets in that account had already exceeded two billion dollars.

Although it was just a string of numbers in his account, it still felt good to have a large sum of money in his account.

After Xia ruofei received the money, he went to look for old master Liu and said,””Elder Liu, I’m going out today.”

Old man Liu’s eyes flashed and he asked,””Is there any news about the two herbs?”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””If nothing unexpected happens, I should be able to get all the medicinal ingredients.”

“That’s great!”Old man Liu was overjoyed. I’ve been in good condition these past two days, so there shouldn’t be any problems with my body. ”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”okay!” If everything went well, he should be able to make a batch of pills tonight! You can change your dressing starting tomorrow. ”

Xia ruofei had only brought three days ‘worth of Chinese medicine this time. After drinking it today, it should have been enough to replenish his energy. If he had the pill from last time, it would be seamless.

“Good! Good! Good!” Old man Liu said repeatedly.

Xia ruofei had already informed Wu Qiang in advance. Very soon, Wu Qiang drove to the Liu family’s residence.

Xia ruofei told Wu Qiang to take a taxi back while he drove away from the Liu family’s residence.

Of course, Xia ruofei wasn’t going to meet any friends.

Although the possibility of the Liu family following him was very low, Xia ruofei still did a few anti – tracking actions out of his habit of being cautious. He also used his mental strength to check continuously to make sure that no one was following him. Then, he drove the Toyota Elfa commercial car out of the city.

Xia ruofei found a remote place to stay for more than an hour before driving back to the city. When he passed by a Walmart, he went in to buy a huge plastic sorting box.

It was the kind of opaque tidying box size was quite large and almost took up the entire space in the trunk of Elfa. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei drove back to liuhai Lane courtyard house and went straight to his own house. He told Wu Qiang not to disturb him unless it was an emergency.

After setting up the alarm array, Xia ruofei walked into his bedroom and summoned the spirit map scroll from his palm. He then entered the space.
