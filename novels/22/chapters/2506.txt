In front of the club’s management and head coach Ruby, Wu Lei did not speak to Xia ruofei. He only smiled and nodded as a greeting. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

It could be seen that Wu Lei was working hard in training. He did not deliberately show it because of his boss and manager. In fact, his training attitude had always been very good. Manager Ruby also saw this and was ready to arrange Wu Lei on the big list for the away challenge against the Yellow Submarine Villarreal this weekend.

However ... In the end, Wu Lei did not follow the team to villiaryol. In the afternoon, under the personal accompaniment of Zhou leiyun, Xia ruofei visited the Columbus Monument and the Holy Family Hall. After having dinner with Zhou leiyun and Jiang Xiaochen, he had just returned to the hotel when he received a WeChat message from Wu Lei: Mr. Xia, I’ve decided to undergo the operation immediately and have already informed the club of my wishes. I’ll have to trouble you with the recovery after the operation!

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but smile and replied,”No problem! Don’t worry, if you’re lucky, you might be able to make it in time for the home game next weekend!

Wu Lei replied,[yes!] Thank you!

Xia ruofei called Zhou leiyun after he heard that Wu Lei had decided to have the surgery as soon as possible.

Wu Lei was a player that Zhou leiyun had personally contacted and brought in. The club also attached great importance to Wu Lei, so after he made the decision to have surgery, the club reported it to Zhou leiyun as soon as possible.

“I already know about this, chief Xia,” said Zhou leiyun. Don’t worry, I’ve already contacted Dr. Havimir. He doesn’t have any other surgeries scheduled for him recently. Wu Lei will go for a comprehensive examination tomorrow. If everything goes well, he can even have the operation tomorrow afternoon! Also, Dr. Havimir said that he could perform the surgery for Wu Lei in his surgical clinic in Spain, so that he wouldn’t have to go to Germany ”

“That’s great!” Xia ruofei said,”there are still nine days until the home game next weekend. If everything goes well, he might even have the chance to make his home debut!”

Zhou leiyun chuckled and said,”that’s all thanks to your miraculous hands!” Doctor havimir’s initial assessment is that the patient will need two to three months for postoperative recovery. ”

...

“Don’t forget that I’m also a shareholder!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I will definitely do my best to help him!”

The next day, Zhou leiyun personally accompanied Xia ruofei and Dong Yun to continue their tour of Barcelona, while Wu Lei headed to Dr. Havimir’s surgical clinic with the company of the Spanish club’s team doctor and Jiang Xiaochen.

Barcelona’s historical and cultural landscapes were very rich. It would take many days to explore them in depth. Xia ruofei and the others could only be considered as having a cursory look. And today was finally the opening day of nokapu. Dong Yun had finally completed her pilgrimage as she had wished. As the chairman of Barcelona’s arch – enemy club, Zhou leiyun accompanied her on a tour of nokapu Stadium with mixed feelings.

In addition to his psychological discomfort, he also needed to be careful to cover it up. Otherwise, if he was photographed by reporters, the newspapers tomorrow would probably be full of news like “the Chinese rich boss of the Spanish club visits nokapu.” He would be drowned by the spittle of the Spanish fans.

When they returned to the hotel that night, Zhou leiyun invited Xia ruofei and the rest to a banquet at the hotel’s restaurant. After the meal, he personally sent Xia ruofei back to his room.

Just as Zhou leiyun was about to leave and go home, Jiang Xiaochen called.

Zhou leiyun took a look at the caller ID and quickly picked up the call. He was also very concerned about the situation of Wu Lei’s surgery.

“Xiaochen, how is it?” Zhou leiyun asked.

“Director Zhou, I have good news for you. Wu Lei’s operation has just ended. Dr. Havimir said that the operation was very successful!” Jiang Xiaochen said excitedly.

Xia ruofei’s hearing was much better than the average person ‘s. Although Zhou leiyun did not put it on speaker, he could still hear it very clearly.

Without waiting for Zhou leiyun to speak, Xia ruofei said,””General manager Zhou, was Wu Lei’s surgery a success? That’s great!”

...

Zhou leiyun was all smiles as well.””What did Dr. Havill say?”

Xia ruofei quickly said,”general manager Zhou, turn on the speaker!” Turn on the speaker!”

Zhou leiyun nodded. He turned on the speaker and placed his phone on the coffee table.

Jiang Xiaochen’s voice was heard from the phone’s speaker.””Dr. Havimir said that he mainly repositioned Wu Lei’s collarbone and reconstructed the shoulder ligament. The surgery went very smoothly and even exceeded the expected results. He also said that Wu Lei’s body is in great condition and that this operation will not affect his career!”

“That’s great!” Zhou leiyun clenched his fists and immediately asked,””Did the doctor say how long it would take to recover?”

Jiang Xiaochen hesitated for a moment before saying,””Dr. Havimir told me that Wu Lei needs to undergo shoulder fixation in the first two weeks. He can start receiving physical treatment in the third week, and it will take about six to eight weeks for him to fully recover.”

Jiang Xiaochen did not know about Xia ruofei’s promise to Wu Lei, so he felt that it was not wise for Wu Lei to choose surgery at this time. Because the recovery period of six to eight weeks meant that the season was basically over by then. Moreover, Wu Lei had rested for such a long time, and he still needed to get back to his form. It could be said that there were not many opportunities left for Wu Lei this season.

Zhou leiyun raised his head and looked at Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei chuckled and said,””General manager Zhou, let Wu Lei stay there and observe for a day. Let him come back tomorrow! Leave the rest of the rehabilitation to me!”

“Alright!” Zhou leiyun said happily and immediately instructed Jiang Xiaochen over the phone,”Xiaochen, did you hear what President Xia said just now?”

“I heard it!” Jiang Xiaochen said.

“We’ll do as President Xia says!” Zhou leiyun said,”send Wu Lei back tomorrow!”

...

“Alright! I got it!” Jiang Xiaochen said.

He didn’t know what Zhou leiyun was up to, but the operation was a success, and the team doctor could help Wu Lei with the rehabilitation training, so it wouldn’t be a big problem for him to return tomorrow.

Xia ruofei saw that Zhou leiyun had hung up the phone, so he asked,””Director Zhou, are there any Chinese medicine shops in Barcelona? I need to prepare a few medicinal herbs in advance. ”

“Of course there are Chinese medicine shops. In fact, as long as there are Chinese people in the world, there are basically Chinese medicine shops.” Zhou leiyun smiled and said,”I’ll arrange for someone to send you there!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’m too lazy to run!” I’ll make a list of the medicinal herbs I need, so please send someone to buy them for me! Also, we need to buy a set of tools for decocting the medicine. ”

Zhou leiyun had thought that Xia ruofei would be worried about the prescription being leaked, so he had asked for someone to send him to a Chinese medicine shop. He did not expect Xia ruofei to not care about this at all.

Zhou leiyun was stunned for a moment before he immediately said,””No problem! Just send me the list and I’ll arrange for someone to take care of it!”

After Zhou leiyun left, Xia ruofei immediately listed all the herbs he needed on WeChat and sent them to Zhou leiyun.

Xia ruofei was a little tired after a day of sightseeing.

After Zhou leiyun left, he quickly took a shower and went to bed early.

……

...

The next day, all the herbs that Xia ruofei needed had been sent to his room. At the same time, there was also a set of claypot, charcoal and other things. These were all things that Xia ruofei had requested Zhou leiyun’s subordinates to prepare.

If he wanted Wu Lei to recover quickly, he naturally needed to use the spirit Heart Flower petal solution. As for these herbs, some of them had no effect at all, while some were used to relax the tendons and activate the muscles. How could he achieve the effect of a complete recovery in only a week with these herbs alone?

Xia ruofei used these herbs to make an ointment and added a certain amount of the spirit Heart Flower petal solution.

After Xia ruofei mixed the ointment evenly, he kept the bowl of ointment in the small refrigerator in the suite.
