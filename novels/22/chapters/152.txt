Chapter 153: Chapter 150 – MA Xiong visits (1)

The next morning, after Xia ruofei woke up, he summoned the spirit map scroll in his palm and entered the space. He went to both spaces and saw that the puppies were normal. Blacky was also staying inside the fence obediently. He was relieved. Of course, Blackie had actually been in the medium for more than ten days, so it was obviously bigger than yesterday. Xia ruofei took another bag of dog food and brought it to the new space. He scooped a few bowls of milk for fluffy one and fluffy two and poured the dog food into a shallow plate. Then, he left the space to wash up and get dressed. Considering that they were going to Shen Cheng city tomorrow, Xia ruofei gave Ling Qingxue a call. Although Ling Qingxue was not his girlfriend yet, he had just invited her to his farm to play the day before yesterday. It would be unreasonable for him to go to Shen Cheng city without telling her. Fortunately, Ling Qingxue was a reasonable person. Moreover, the first month of the lunar year was the busiest time for the food and beverage industry. There were many feasts. She had originally planned to come to the farm to look for Xia ruofei after finishing her work. Hence, Ling Qingxue only reminded Xia ruofei to take care of his health and safety when he went out. She did not show any signs of unhappiness. After the call with Ling Qingxue, Xia ruofei went downstairs for breakfast. Knowing that MA Xiong’s family would be flying to the three mountains from Hong Kong, Xia ruofei stayed in the mansion. As expected, when it was close to noon, Xia ruofei heard the sound of a car’s engine coming from outside the villa. When he got up and walked out of the villa, he saw a black Mercedes – Benz and a Toyota nanny car already parked at the entrance of the courtyard. Xia ruofei used the remote control to open the gate, and two cars entered. The electric door of the nanny van made a beeping sound as it slowly opened. Xia ruofei first saw little Huanhuan, who was wearing a pink Princess dress, getting out of the car. She then ran towards him with a happy expression. “Uncle Xia!” The little girl’s voice was filled with irrepressible joy. “Swish!” Xia ruofei revealed a warm smile. He squatted down and opened his arms. Huanhuan rushed into his arms. Xia ruofei planted a big kiss on Huanhuan’s pink face. Then, he picked her up and spun her around, making her laugh. “Huanhuan, I’ve missed you so much!” Xia ruofei hugged Huanhuan with one hand and used the other to gently brush her nose. He asked,”did you miss uncle Xia?” “Of course! I even dreamed of you a few days ago!” Huan Huan said seriously. At this moment, MA Xiong, Ma Zhiming, Tian Huixin, professor Tian, and Lu You all got out of the car. Xia ruofei smiled and greeted them, then continued to ask,””Oh, really? What did Huanhuan dream about?” “I dreamed that uncle Xia took me to Disneyland!” Huan Huan replied. Xia ruofei could clearly feel that Huan Huan’s pronunciation was clear, and the two of them answered each other’s questions in a very organized manner. If someone who was not aware of Huan Huan’s previous state was standing here, they would never have thought that not long ago, Huan Huan was still a Star Child who was completely immersed in her own world. At this moment, Huanhuan looked at Xia ruofei with her innocent eyes and asked seriously,””Uncle Xia, is this the ‘dream – telling’ that they say on TV?” “Ha?” Xia ruofei was stunned. When Lu You saw this, she couldn’t help but burst out laughing. After hearing Huan Huan’s words, Tian Huixin did not know whether to laugh or cry.”Huanhuan, don’t talk nonsense!” Only the dead or the gods could appear in her dreams, and Xia ruofei was not a God. It was truly inauspicious to say such words during the new year. “But that’s how it is on TV ...” Huanhuan said, feeling wronged. “You still dare to say that!” Tian Huixin said with a fierce expression. Xia ruofei laughed and said,”it’s fine, it’s fine. Children’s words carry no harm!” Why are you taking a child so seriously ...” Xia ruofei gently pinched Huanhuan’s pink face and said,””Huanhuan, let me teach you. This is not called dreaming. It’s called “what you think in the day, what you dream of at night,” you know?” “What you think in the day, you dream of at night?” Huan Huan looked puzzled. Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”it means ... Huanhuan misses uncle Xia very much during the day. That’s why she dreams of me at night. Do you understand?” Huan Huan nodded her head and said,”Mm! I understand!” “Good girl!” Xia ruofei said. Xia ruofei looked at Lu You, who was laughing so hard that she was shaking. He rolled his eyes and smiled evilly. He reached into his pocket and took out the red packet that he had prepared earlier and handed it to Huanhuan. “Huanhuan, here, this is your New Year’s money!” Xia ruofei said. Huan Huan turned to look at Tian Huixin. After seeing Tian Huixin nod slightly, she reached out to take the red packet and said very sensibly,””Thank you, uncle Xia!” “You’re welcome. The elders all give red packets to the younger generation during the new year!” Xia ruofei said with a smile. Xia ruofei even emphasized the word “elder”. After he finished speaking, he looked at Lu You. Lu You didn’t react in the beginning. She only felt that Xia ruofei’s gaze was a little strange. When she came back to her senses, the smile on her face froze. Huanhuan had always called Xia ruofei “uncle”. If she and Huanhuan were cousins, then wouldn’t Xia ruofei be her elder? Lu You was instantly indignant. She looked at Xia ruofei unhappily and then said to Huan Huan,””Huanhuan, quickly return the red packet to him. Also, you can’t call him uncle in the future, you have to call him brother! Do you know that?” Huan Huan looked at Lu You innocently and asked with a puzzled expression,””Sister Youyou, why? I’ve always called him “uncle.” Why did uncle Xia suddenly change to “big brother”?” Xia ruofei laughed and said,””Huanhuan, don’t listen to your sister. Let’s just call him uncle. That’s good!” “You ...” Lu You glared at Xia ruofei and snatched Huanhuan from his arms. Then, she said to Huanhuan,”let’s go and find lightning to play with ... Ignore him!” Lu You carried Huanhuan and walked towards lightning. At the same time, she kept instilling into lightning,””Remember, call me big brother from now on, Don’t call me Uncle ...” “Oh ...” Huanhuan said,”but why?” “There’s no why!” Lu You said helplessly,”you just have to remember ...” Professor Tian, MA Xiong, and the others couldn’t help but laugh. However, they naturally wouldn’t get involved in the young man’s bickering. When Huan Huan saw lightning, she immediately jumped down from Lu You’s arms and ran over to play with it. Lightning was quite intelligent. It had already known Huanhuan last time, so it was very docile. With Lu You watching by the side, Tian Huixin and the others were naturally very assured. After Xia ruofei beckoned MA Xiong and the rest to enter the house, he introduced Hu Zi’s mother, Lin Qiao, and ye Lingyun. MA Xiong didn’t put on any airs as a rich man. He greeted them with a big smile and even gave Xia ruofei, Lin Qiao, and ye Lingyun a big red packet each as per Hong Kong’s custom. These were really big red packets, Yingluo. Each red packet contained a whole ten thousand Hong Kong dollars. Lin Qiao and ye Lingyun hurriedly declined when they saw the amount of money in the red packet. They didn’t dare to accept it. “Qiao’ er, Ling Yun, this is from old master Ma. Just accept it,”Xia ruofei said with a smile. In the eyes of a billionaire, 10000 Hong Kong dollars was not even a drop in the ocean. There was no need to be pretentious when people gave out red packets on New Year’s Eve. Lin Qiao and ye Lingyun only accepted the red packets after hearing Xia ruofei’s words. Lin Qiao even obediently paid her New Year greetings to MA Xiong and said some auspicious words. MA Xiong also smiled and expressed his gratitude. Lin Qiao and Hu ‘Zi’s mother served tea to the guests, and they sat down in their respective seats. MA Xiong smiled at Xia ruofei and said,” “Xia Sheng, I’ll be honest with you. Other than inviting you to the truffle tasting auction, I also have something I need your help with ...” [PS] announcing the VIP Reader group number: 295848872, genuine readers are welcome to join the group (after joining the group, you need to verify the screenshot of the full subscription).
