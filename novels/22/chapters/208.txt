Chapter 209: Chapter 205 the Secretary’s help (1)

“Little Xia!” Tian Huilan quickly picked up the call and said anxiously. Xia ruofei couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows. This was the head of Sanshan city and a Deputy provincial – Level leader. Her ability to maintain her composure was definitely not something that ordinary people could imagine. At this moment, Tian Huilan’s tone made Xia ruofei realize that the matter might not be small. “Secretary Tian, I’m sorry I didn’t have my phone with me just now,” said Xia ruofei. Is there anything I can help you with?” “Xiao Xia, one of my elders is in critical condition and is dying ...” Tian Huilan said.”I want to ask, can you ... Can you help diagnose and treat him?” In fact, Xia ruofei had already guessed it when he saw Tian Huilan’s missed call. In Tian Huilan’s impression, Xia ruofei’s best skill was undoubtedly his medical skills. Other than saving lives, the Secretary couldn’t have called him personally to ask for a few handfuls of vegetables, right? “Secretary Tian, is it serious?” Xia ruofei asked calmly. “Late – Stage liver cancer ...” Tian Huilan said. Xia ruofei frowned. It wasn’t that he had no confidence in the flower’s petals, but the disease was incurable. Moreover, it was one of the more dangerous types of cancer. It was hard to detect in the early stages, difficult to treat, and the survival rate was very low. If this disease was cured casually, it would bring him a lot of trouble. In the secretary’s office. Tian Huilan couldn’t help but smile bitterly when she heard the silence on the other end of the phone. He was really a little desperate. Xiao Xia’s medical skills were indeed brilliant. His father’s heart disease and Huanhuan’s autism could not stop him. He even saved his sister’s father – in – Law, who had a serious cerebral hemorrhage and was on the verge of death. But elder song had late – Stage liver cancer! With elder song’s status, as long as there was a way, his condition would not have developed to such a serious extent. Moreover, he had gone to Germany for surgery some time ago, but there was still no way to control his condition. In the end, he had no choice but to return home. In this situation, even the gods could not do anything, right? Asking Xiao Xia for help was indeed a little too much. Thinking of this, Tian Huilan said,””Xiao Xia, I ...” “Secretary Tian, I can try.” Xia ruofei interrupted Tian Huilan. “Ah?” Tian Huilan was so shocked that she thought she had heard wrong. “I said, I can try.” Xia ruofei said,”but I’m not confident, especially before I see the patient ...” “I understand. I’m already very grateful that you’re willing to help!” Tian Huilan said, slightly excited. “You’re too kind, Secretary Tian. ” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”where is the patient now? When do you need me to go over?” “The faster, the better!” Tian Huilan immediately said. The patient is in Jiangnan Province, and I’ve already contacted the airport. There’s a flight to Hongzhou city in Jiangnan in 50 ... No, 45 minutes. If you don’t have any questions, we’ll meet at the airport!” “Secretary Tian, you’re going in person too?” Xia ruofei was a little surprised. “Yes, this is a very important senior of mine.” Tian Huilan said,”so ... Xiao Xia, I’ll leave it to you this time ... Of course, if there’s really no way to turn the situation around, then there’s nothing I can do. I’ll still be very grateful to you!” “Don’t worry, Secretary Tian. I’ll do my best. ” Xia ruofei said,”then let’s meet at the airport!” “Alright, thank you for your hard work, little Xia!” After hanging up the phone, Xia ruofei sat on the chair and pondered for a moment. He didn’t regret promising Tian Huilan that he could make a provincial level official so nervous. This patient was definitely not an ordinary person. In a human society like Huaxia, if Xia ruofei wanted to develop his business, he could not do without the support of the rich. Otherwise, when Taoyuan farm rose to fame, it might be snatched away by others. Tian Huilan’s elder was definitely worth Xia ruofei’s time. However, it was one thing to be willing to save him, and another thing to do so. Late – Stage lung cancer and possibly body metastasis. This kind of illness was basically on the irreversible countdown to death, so naturally, he couldn’t just stupidly cure it. If he did that, not only would he not receive the gratitude of that Big Shot, but he might also bring himself big trouble. Even a fool would know that Xia ruofei was hiding a big secret. Terminal cancer was not like MA Xiong’s acute cerebral hemorrhage. Who wouldn’t want to grasp the big secret of being able to cure a fatal disease? The more important a person was, the more he would treasure his life! Xia ruofei thought for a moment, took out the spirit map scroll, and entered the original space. He had to make some preparations before he set off. The flow of time in the original space was 30 times slower than the outside world. Xia ruofei was not worried about not having enough time. He found a few porcelain bottles and filled one of them with the spatial spirit pond water. He then directly fused a whole petal into it. The other porcelain bottle was also made into flower petal solution of the same concentration as the first bottle. Then, he diluted it according to different ratios. In total, he made five bottles of flower petal solution of different concentration. The one with the lowest concentration was the same as the petal solution he usually used to water the Phoebe zhennan and ginseng. That was a large box of space spirit pool water mixed with a petal solution. He made marks on them that only he could understand. Then, he took a few more bottles of red herbal tea. Except for the first bottle of petal solution with the highest purity, he added the brown herbal tea with a little medicinal smell into the other bottles, then closed the bottle stopper and stirred it well. This was the solution that Xia ruofei came up with in a short period of time. After seeing the patient, he would use the petal solution with the lowest purity first. Even if it could not kill the cancer cells, it could at least keep the patient alive. In short, the principle was that the effect couldn’t be too fast, and it couldn’t be completely cured. Although he did not know the patient’s identity, Xia ruofei believed that with his status, as long as he could pull him back from the gates of hell and alleviate his condition, the usual medical methods should be effective. In this way, he would not expose his secret, and he could also gain a big favor, which was basically a life – saving grace. Xia ruofei took a suitcase and sealed the porcelain bottles. Then, he placed them neatly in the suitcase. Then, he took out a set of silver needles and put them in. Xia ruofei had bought them from the Chinese medicine pharmacy when he had time last year. It was for the sake of acting when he needed to treat people. Of course, Xia ruofei had also learned some basic knowledge about acupuncture points in Chinese medicine. It was enough for him to put on an act. In the end, he randomly found two sets of clothes to change into and put them in. Then, he left the spirit map space with his suitcase. After keeping the painting, Xia ruofei did not waste any more time. He took his suitcase and quickly went downstairs. He found ye Lingyun and gave him some instructions. Then, he drove the pickup truck straight to Changping airport. 【月票换加更】啊啊啊啊...... 钢枪已经用尽洪荒之力了，但是差距还是越来越小，也没有其他办法，唯有爆肝码字了! Up until now, he had received 172 monthly votes today.
