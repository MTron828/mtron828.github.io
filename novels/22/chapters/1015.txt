Chapter 1016: Fifteen million USD (2)

Translator: 549690339

Hence, Xia ruofei accompanied Tang He and walked to the two pieces of material.

Xia ruofei had personally cut down the two pieces of Phoebe zhennan wood and was very familiar with their condition. He could see them every time he entered the realm, so he was already used to it.

But Tang He was different. When he walked to the side of the Phoebe zhennan material, his eyes couldn’t help but light up. Then, he immediately bent down to examine it carefully, and his expression became more and more excited.

After a long while, Tang He straightened up and asked,””Ruofei, I want these two pieces of material! Do you want to open a few Windows and see the lines inside?”

Xia ruofei smiled and shook his head.””No need, just give me a price ...”

Tang He’s eyes flashed with a strange light. He looked into Xia ruofei’s eyes and asked,””Are you sure? If it’s a top – grade big – wave like the last time, the price will be much more expensive. ”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”how can there be so many Supreme – grade patterns?” Mr. Tang, you can just state your price normally. If you take it back and find a precious top quality pattern, then you’re lucky!”

Ah – Zhong couldn’t help but look at Xia ruofei deeply. From his experience, if the core of these two pieces of material was taken out, the price should be higher. He couldn’t understand Xia ruofei’s approach.

Tang He couldn’t help but laugh and said,””Straightforward! Ruofei, I won’t waste any more time. I’ll sell these two pieces of old Phoebe zhennan together for 15 million US dollars. What do you think?”

Ah – Zhong turned pale with fright and couldn’t help but cry out,””Master Tang! The price is too high ...”

“Ah – Zhong!” Tang He’s face darkened.”I know what to do. Don’t say anything more!”

Ah-Zhong’s heart couldn’t help but tremble, and he hurriedly lowered his hands.”Yes, Master Tang ...”

He could not understand it. Previously, Xia ruofei could have sold it at a higher price, but he offered to sell it directly and did not need to take out the core. Tang He could’ve bought the two pieces of gold Phoebe zhennan at a much lower price, but he offered such a high price.

15 million dollars was equivalent to 7.5 million dollars for each piece of material. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

If it was an ordinary Phoebe zhennan material of the same size, it would be impossible to sell it for such a price. Even if Xia ruofei’s two pieces of wood were of high quality, they still needed to find very precious patterns, such as cloud patterns, tiger patterns, and so on, when they were cut out to reach this price.

Otherwise, Tang He would definitely be at a loss for spending so much money to buy it.

In fact, ah – Zhong did not know that Tang He’s confidence in these two pieces of material far exceeded his because Tang He had seen with his own eyes that the gold Phoebe zhennan material, which was also bought from Xia ruofei, had the highest quality wave pattern.

At that time, Tang He had spent ten million dollars on that piece of material, but after the big wave cut, the actual value of the material had reached at least fifteen million dollars.

This time, these two pieces of material gave Tang He a very familiar feeling. He vaguely felt that they seemed to be of the same root and origin as the Golden nanmu material last time. He even had a sixth sense that the lines of these two pieces of material would not be different.

Moreover, Tang He had actually taken advantage of the Golden Nannan material he bought last time. This time, Xia ruofei had given him such good tea leaves, so he had the idea of compensating him.

The material this time was slightly smaller than the last one, which was ten million Yuan last time. This time, it was 7.5 million Yuan a piece. This price was appropriate in Tang He’s eyes.

Xia ruofei didn’t act coy. Without much consideration, he laughed and said,””Deal!”

Actually, Xia ruofei knew that the Phoebe zhennan wood grew in the spirit map space and was nourished by rich spiritual energy day and night. The probability of it appearing was very high. In other words, it should be worth it to sell these two pieces of wood for fifteen million US dollars.

“Hahaha! It’s so refreshing to do business with RUO Fei!” Tang He said happily.

Xia ruofei said,”Mr. Tang, let’s use the name of my offshore company in Cayman Islands this time!” I also need to invest in two wineries in Australia, and it’s too troublesome to transfer the domestic funds ...”

Tang He laughed and said,”I had to remind you even if you didn’t say so!” An offshore company’s account is more flexible, and foreign financial policies are more relaxed. I suggest that all your overseas business will be done through an offshore company in the future. ”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”okay!” By the way, Mr. Tang, you can directly deduct the money we lent you last time ... Just use today’s exchange rate between us dollars and Australian dollars!”

“Alright!” Tang He said readily.

Then, Tang He’s legal assistant quickly drafted the contract and attached the photos of the two pieces of material from different angles. Xia ruofei and Tang He signed the transfer contract.

The speed of overseas transfers was also very fast.

Tang He made a phone call and the money was transferred to his account. Xia ruofei checked the account of an offshore company in the Cayman Islands. After deducting the three million Australian dollars that he lent last time, which was equivalent to 2.37 million US dollars, the remaining 12.63 million US dollars had been transferred to his account.

“I’ve received the money, Mr. Tang. ” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Tang He extended his hand to Xia ruofei and said with a smile,””Happy cooperation!”

“Happy cooperation!”

“I’ll come to you again if I need more Phoebe zhennan or other precious wood!” Tang He chuckled and said,”ruofei, you’re not allowed to decline!”

Xia ruofei also laughed and said,””I can only say that I’ll try my best, but I can’t guarantee anything about this kind of thing!”

Tang He laughed and patted Xia ruofei’s shoulder.

The transaction here was completed. Tang He and Xia ruofei walked out of the warehouse together. This place was temporarily taken over by Tang He’s men.

They would complete the customs procedures in the shortest time possible, then transport the wood to the United States by sea.

Xia ruofei’s warehouse was empty except for two pieces of wood. There was only a tea set, a table and a chair for the picnic that Xia ruofei took out in the morning. In front of Tang He and the others, Xia ruofei couldn’t put these things into the space. He directly gave the key to Tang He’s people and asked them to lock the warehouse after the wood was transported away, and then send the key to Peach Blossom Farm.

When Xia ruofei and Tang He reached the door, the two stood at the door and chatted for a while.

Just then, Xia ruofei’s phone vibrated.

He made an apologetic expression at Tang He and took out his phone.

The caller ID showed that it was a local landline in Sanshan. Xia ruofei picked up and said,””Hello, who is this?”

“Are you Mr. Xia ruofei?” The Mandarin of the person on the other end of the phone was very stiff, with a strong Cantonese accent.

“I’m Xia ruofei. You’re from Hengfeng group, right?”Xia ruofei said immediately.

A few days ago, MA Xiong had said that he would send someone to look at the one – headed abalone that Xia ruofei had mentioned. He also said that he wanted to bid for some information to warm up the auction. Hence, Xia ruofei immediately guessed his background when he heard the obvious Cantonese accent.

“Yes, yes! Hello, President Xia!” The voice on the other end of the phone suddenly became enthusiastic.”I’m sent by Chairman MA to contact you about the auction. My name is Guo Song.”

“Oh, nice to meet you, Mister Guo!” Xia ruofei smiled and continued to ask,”have you arrived at the three mountains?”

“Yes, I just checked into a hotel!” Guo Song asked,”when is it convenient for you, Mr. Xia?” I’d like to take a look at the abalone you have ...”

MA Xiong had personally ordered him to come to the mainland to identify a batch of one – headed abalones. He didn’t believe it at all. Since when could one – headed abalones be measured by the word “batch”? However, this was a task personally assigned by the chairman. He had also specifically instructed Mr. Xia to be a distinguished friend of Hengfeng group and to have a good attitude, so he didn’t dare to neglect it and immediately packed up and rushed to Sanshan.

Xia ruofei said,”I’m definitely free today. However, I’m not at the farm right now. Mister Guo, you can rest in the hotel first. I’ll contact you when I get back to the farm.”
