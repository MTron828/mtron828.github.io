Xia ruofei was now acquainted with many cultivators. He was no longer as ignorant about the world of cultivators on earth as he used to be. However, he was also clear that in terms of numbers, the cultivators were like a drop in the ocean compared to the ordinary people in the secular world.

When he was traveling in the secular world, he had rarely encountered cultivators, let alone among his acquaintances.

Xia ruofei released his spiritual power to confirm without a sound. He realized that there was indeed a trace of spirit Qi fluctuation in Lu You’s body. However, it was very weak. If he did not have extraordinary senses and the spiritual power of the spiritualization realm, he might not have noticed it.

From the fluctuations of spirit Qi in Lu You’s body, she might have just started cultivating and might not even be at refined Qi Level 1.

But no matter what, this trace of spirit Qi fluctuation was enough to prove that Lu You had indeed come into contact with cultivation and was considered to have embarked on the path of cultivation.

Xia ruofei had not been in contact with Lu You for one or two years. He did not know what she had been through or why she would have a connection with the cultivation world.

However, no matter how curious Xia ruofei was, he remained calm and smiled at Lu You. He nodded and said,””Lu You! Long time no see!”

Lu You’s gaze was a little evasive, but she still nodded slightly and said,””Long time no see! You’re also in Beijing!”

Zhao Yongjun laughed and said,”ruofei just arrived today too. We’re here to welcome him!” 1 didn’t expect Youyou to return today. This must be fate!”

Lu You’s pretty face heated up slightly, and Xia ruofei felt a little unnatural.

Zhao Yongjun might not know the inside story, but how could Xia ruofei forget the seemingly cold but actually passionate miss Lu?

Lu You had never hidden her feelings for Xia ruofei. Back then, Lu You was the one who had boldly confessed to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei had a headache at that time. However, what he was worried about did not happen. Lu You disappeared from his life very quickly. After hearing what Zhao Yongjun and the others said today, Xia ruofei knew that Lu You had probably gone overseas to study.

It had been a long time since the incident. Xia ruofei did not know how Lu You was doing or what she was thinking, so he was definitely feeling uncomfortable.

Zhao Yongjun didn’t notice and laughed,””Come! Youyou, sit here! We were just about to eat, and the dishes have just started to be served! You’ve come in time!”

“Thank you, brother Zhao!” Lu You smiled and said.

Today was a welcoming dinner for Xia ruofei, and Zhao Yongjun was the leader of the brothers, so he was considered the host. He took the main seat, while Xia ruofei sat on the right side of Zhao Yongjun. Originally, the person sitting on Zhao Yongjun’s left was song Rui. However, after Lu You came in, song Rui immediately moved to the side and asked the waiter to add another chair. After all, Lu Youyuan was a guest. He would definitely not let her sit at the last seat.

This way, Xia ruofei and Lu You sat on either side of Zhao Yongjun.

After the dishes were served, Zhao Yongjun raised his glass and laughed,””Brothers, let’s have the first drink together. Firstly, it’s to welcome Youyou back. Secondly, it’s been a long time since ruofei returned to the capital. Ruofei, you can hold your liquor well, so please show your sincerity!”

Everyone had seen Xia ruofei’s alcohol tolerance. He drank like water. No one had ever seen Xia ruofei drunk before. To lighten the mood, Zhao Yongjun started to drink Xia ruofei’s first glass of wine.

Xia ruofei didn’t decline. He smiled and said,””Alright! Then 1’11 use the big cup. H

After saying that, he gestured to the waiter to bring a tall glass of drink, then directly picked up the wine divider and poured himself a large glass of white wine.

“Straightforward!” Zhao Yongjun gave Xia ruofei a thumbs up and said,”come, come, come! Here’s the first cup!”

Everyone used the small glasses to drink white wine. Xia ruofei was the only one holding a big glass. He raised his head and downed it. Then, he touched his mouth without a change in expression and said with a smile,”This wine is really good! I’m wasting good wine by drinking it like this. Brother Zhao, 1 propose … I’ll use the same cup as everyone and drink! As long as you’re happy and happy…”

“Alright!” Zhao Yongjun nodded. We can’t get you drunk even if we want to!

You might as well save some wine!”

Zhao Yongjun’s words caused everyone to laugh. At the same time, there was a hint of helplessness in their laughter. Everyone had tried many times and used all sorts of shameless methods, but they really couldn’t get Xia ruofei drunk…

After three rounds of drinks, Zhao Yongjun tilted his head slightly and looked at Lu You. He smiled and asked,””Youyou, you said on the phone that you have something to discuss with me. What is it?”

Lu You looked at Xia ruofei and hesitated for a moment. Then, she smiled and said,””When 1 was still abroad, 1 heard that there was a Paradise Club in the capital. The environment was very good. Later, 1 asked around and found out that it was opened together with you, brother Zhao. So, when I came back, 1 wanted to come here and experience it. 1 also wanted to get you to help me get a membership card.”

Zhao Yong Jun was stunned and asked,””Just this?”
