Xia ruofei paused and continued,””If you keep breaking these spatial cages, how will you have the time to comprehend the spatial laws? I have plenty of time to play with you ...”

This was the true weakness of the white fox. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

After the realm Fox tried to break through a few spatial cages, it gave up dejectedly. It stood up on its hind legs and put its two front paws together in a very human – like posture, looking very pitiful.

Xia ruofei knew that the Jie Li was wild and hard to tame, so he did not loosen his restraint immediately. Instead, he asked,””I reminded you last time. I’ll ask you again today. Do you still dare to mess around in the space?”

The White realmfox shook its head and looked obedient.

Xia ruofei continued,”when I’m not in this space, Xia Qing will represent me. You must obey his words. Can you do that?”

“Ji ji ji ...” The White realm Fox nodded repeatedly.

Xia ruofei waved his hand and removed all the space cages.

Looking at the white fox’s docile appearance, Xia Qing said in admiration,””Master, you’re amazing, you managed to control it with one move!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”this little guy’s wildness won’t disappear in a short time. If it causes trouble here, inform me immediately. I’ll teach it a big lesson!”

When the White realmfox heard this, it could not help but shiver in fear. Its eyes became more gentle.

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing replied.

Xia ruofei continued to patrol the mountain sea realm. Then, he stood by the sea and looked at the small island in the distance. He had wanted to go to the island again to take a look, but Yingying had been pressed for time last time, so he had not been able to explore the entire Island. After taking the heart – concentrating grass, he had left in a hurry.

However, on second thought, Xia ruofei realized that the island had a special spatial barrier. He could not teleport there directly and had to swim in. Hence, he gave up on the idea of going to the island.

Xia ruofei thought to himself,”I’ll buy a small motorboat tomorrow so that it’ll be easier to enter and exit the island. I don’t have to get” wet “every time I go up ...”

After patrolling the space, Xia ruofei returned to the Archean realm.

Four boxes filled with raw gemstones were placed neatly on the grass of the Archean realm. Xia ruofei was prepared to open them today. He was also looking forward to what surprises these five raw gemstones would bring him.

Xia ruofei strode to the side of the wooden box. He injected genuine Qi into his hand and pulled it open gently. The wooden box that had been nailed shut was pulled open.

Soon, Xia ruofei opened the four wooden boxes and took out the five raw gemstones of different sizes.

If Yu mingdong had seen this scene, he would have been shocked speechless. The two raw stones that needed a forklift or several people’s cooperation to move were lifted by Xia ruofei effortlessly as if they were weightless.

Then, with a thought, a small gasoline engine was moved to his side. He pulled the rope hard and the gasoline engine started running.

After seeing that the voltage and current on the meter had stabilized, Xia ruofei picked up a hand grinder and replaced the grinding plates with new ones. He then plugged it into a socket connected to the output end of the gasoline – powered generator.

Xia ruofei had bought the grinding machine and grinding sheets from jadeite Street, where they were well equipped for cutting stones.

He turned on the power of the grinding machine and began to cut the stone from the smallest piece.

Xia ruofei did not have much experience in this area, but he had precise control of his hands and good eyesight. He could use this method of polishing bit by bit to cut the raw stone without damaging it at all.

Of course, there were some parts that could not be polished by the grinder. Xia ruofei only needed an ordinary carving knife and infused with genuine Qi to easily remove the unnecessary stone parts.

The screeching sound of friction was accompanied by the roar of the gasoline engine. Xia ruofei’s hand was full of stone chips.

After a short while, the smallest raw stone was cut out.

Ice seed! And it was the relatively rare red silk! Xia ruofei had spent about 700000 Yuan on this raw stone, but this piece of Jade was worth at least three to four million Yuan!

Without a doubt, this was a good start.

Xia ruofei was not as fanatical as those who gambled on stones. He did not show any signs of excitement at the expected huge increase. He used the carving knife in his hand to clean some of the corners. Then, he placed the priceless Jade aside and continued to cut the second raw stone.

The second piece, a huge increase!

The third piece, great increase!

......

Xia ruofei cut four raw stones in a row without stopping. The Jade in each stone was pretty good, mainly ice – Type jade. Even the worst one was worth at least three to five times its original value.

Just these four pieces of jade were worth more than 20 million Yuan. Xia ruofei had already earned back the capital he spent on these raw stones.

There was only one piece left, and it was the one that Xia ruofei had the most faith in.

Xia ruofei had spent more than three million on this raw stone. It was not the most expensive of the five raw stones, but Xia ruofei felt that it had the most potential.

This was because it could cause a strong vibration on the spirit painting scroll. The intensity of the vibration was almost the same as the original stone that became the king of bidding, but the price was not even one – tenth of that stone.

Xia ruofei rested for a while and drank some water. Then, he walked towards the raw stone with the grinder in his hand.

He had done this many times, so he was at least familiar with grinding raw stones.

Xia ruofei turned on the power of the grinding machine and started to grind the last raw stone with confidence.

In the midst of the stone debris, Xia ruofei stared at the raw gemstone without blinking.

The stone Skin was worn off bit by bit. Suddenly, a pure black color entered Xia ruofei’s sight. He subconsciously raised his arm and moved the grinder away from the raw stone.

After turning off the power, Xia ruofei picked up a wet cloth and wiped it with force.

It really wasn’t an illusion. There was a pure black piece of Jade at the window position. It looked like it could be planted with water. Xia ruofei shone it with a strong flashlight and felt that it was very transparent. However, in a daily environment, the piece of Jade was actually pure black.

Was this still considered Jade? Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel apprehensive.

However, since the spirit painting scroll had such a strong reaction, it meant that the Jade inside was definitely not bad.

It might be a rare type of Jade! Xia ruofei said in his heart.

He turned on the power of the grinding machine again and continued to grind carefully.

This raw stone was a Little Big, but the Jade inside was not that big. Hence, Xia ruofei had to grind it for more than two hours before he finally took out the head – sized Jade.

He spent another twenty minutes carefully removing the impurities on the corners of the Jade with a carving knife.

Then, a piece of black jade was presented in front of Xia ruofei.

Although it wasn’t the traditional green color, this black jade seemed to have a kind of soul – stirring beauty. The black jade flesh was like a black hole that could attract people’s eyes involuntarily.

With Xia ruofei’s half – baked knowledge of Jade, he could only judge that the quality of this black jade was at least of the ice type. As for its value or whether it could be considered a type of “Jade”, he had no idea.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and decided to leave the spirit map space with the strange Jade.

After returning to his bedroom, Xia ruofei picked up his phone from the bedside table and took a few photos of the black jade.

Then, he opened his WeChat and sent the photo to Ma Zhiming, who was far away in Hong Kong.

Xia ruofei wrote on WeChat,”Mr. MA, can you help me see if this piece of Jade is Imperial Jade?” If so, what’s the value?”

He was worried that some things couldn’t be seen clearly in the photo, so he sent the size and approximate weight of the Jade to Ma Zhiming. Then, he put the black jade into the medium and waited for Ma Zhiming’s reply.
