Chapter 454: Recruiting soldiers and buying horses Part 2

Cao tieshu laughed in a simple and honest manner, his eyes filled with hope.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and asked,””Cao, is sister – in – Law willing to work on the farm? Will you be too busy with the work at home?”

“She’s willing!” Cao tieshu quickly replied,”I went home this afternoon and asked her. Boss, our family only has a few acres of land now. There’s not much work. She’s also studying at a University in another city, so there’s only US at home. It won’t affect her much if she works on the farm. ”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”okay, old Cao, let sister – in – Law try it tomorrow!” Why don’t you find another person and let her help Sister – in – Law in the kitchen and do some chores? The kitchen hand’s salary may be slightly lower, but sister-in-law’s salary and treatment are the same as our farm workers. Is that okay?”

Cao tieshu was pleasantly surprised,”yes!” Yes! Boss ... Isn’t the salary a little too high ... She’s just cooking, isn’t it a little inappropriate to take 5000 a month?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”that’s a chef’s position!” 5000 was not considered high! It’s settled then ... By the way, old Cao, I still need to hire two cleaners for my farm. I prefer to find them in your village, which is more convenient for me to get to work and get off work. Why don’t you help me look for them? The salary will be the same as that of a kitchen hand, so let’s set it at 3500 a month for now!”

After listening to Wu Liqian’s suggestion, Xia ruofei had made up his mind to expand the farm. However, he wanted to get in touch with Wu Liqian’s classmate first. If he was satisfied with his ability and was willing to work on the farm, then he could hand over the contract negotiations with the village, the recruitment of new workers, the construction of new greenhouse infrastructure, and other specific tasks to the new general manager.

If he could slack off, Xia ruofei would not be willing to do such tedious work.

However, Cao tieshu’s visit to him had also reminded Xia ruofei that Kongtong farm had not expanded yet. The recruitment of new workers was not urgent, but the staff canteen had to be operated first. This was also to fulfill the welfare promise to the employees. It would also be convenient for him to eat when he did not feel like cooking in the future.

In addition, with the building in use, the janitors couldn’t wait either. They had to be hired immediately.

Hence, Xia ruofei decided to take this opportunity to recruit the people in these two positions.

Cao tieshu was also very happy after hearing this. He quickly said,”No problem! Boss, I’ll definitely be strict!”

He didn’t know where Cao tieshu had learned the phrase “strict security,” but it was quite appropriate to use it here.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. After some thought, he said,””By the way, old Cao, I’ll get a chef from the restaurant to come over. Let him take care of sister – in – Law for the time being.”

Xia ruofei was mainly thinking about the modern kitchen facilities in the employees ‘cafeteria. Cao tieshu’s wife might not know how to use them. Furthermore, being a chef for a wedding in the countryside was different from being a chef in a company’s cafeteria. It would be better to have a proper chef from a restaurant teach some hygiene standards for a period of time. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Cao tieshu didn’t think too much and immediately said,””That’s great! My wife only knows how to cook some countryside dishes, so she can learn more from the city’s chef. ”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’m just here to help look after them. It won’t take long.” I think that since sister – in – Law can cook for someone else, her skills must be good enough. Aren’t our workers all from the countryside?”

Cao tieshu chuckled and nodded.

The problem of the restaurant’s chefs could be easily solved. Xia ruofei’s future father-in-law’s family was running a chain restaurant. He dared not say about other things, but there must be many chefs.

Xia ruofei gave Ling Xiaotian a call in front of Cao tieshu. He did not pretend to be polite with Ling Xiaotian. After exchanging a few pleasantries, he directly stated his request.

Ling Xiaotian had always been very satisfied with his future son – in – Law. Now that the two of them were working together to set up a winery, such a small matter was naturally not a problem for him. He immediately expressed that he would send the Executive Head Chef of the flagship store in the city center over to guide him.

Wasn’t this like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut?

Xia ruofei jumped in shock and hurriedly declined. After much persuasion, Ling Xiaotian reluctantly agreed and changed the chef. Although it was not the head chef of a chain restaurant, it was still an experienced chef. It was the most suitable to come and guide Cao tieshu’s wife.

After Xia ruofei finished his call, Cao tieshu expressed his gratitude to Xia ruofei before returning to the vegetable greenhouse.

Of course, before he reached the greenhouse, he couldn’t help but take out his mobile phone and call his wife. He couldn’t wait to tell her the good news.

At the same time, Cao tieshu also wanted his wife to quickly find a kitchen helper and two cleaners.

Xia ruofei had given him this task out of trust. Who in the village didn’t know of the famous Peach Blossom Farm? Everyone, young and old, was envious of Xia ruofei’s first batch of 15 workers. Many people were eagerly waiting for the farm to recruit new people.

Therefore, the three quotas in Cao tieshu’s hands, no matter who he gave them to, would not be a small favor.

Because of this, while Cao tieshu was grateful to Xia ruofei, he also constantly reminded his wife to choose the right person, or else she would be letting down the boss’s trust.

In fact, Xia ruofei would not care about such a small matter. It was just a cleaning job. If the person was not suitable, he could just fire him and replace him.

……

The relocation work was completed in two days.

Pang Hao moved the finance department to the accounting office that was specially installed with iron doors and windows, and rearranged the accounts.

He had also entrusted the design of the farm’s signboard to the Li Du advertising company, and they would soon come up with three alternative plans.

Lei Hu, Hong Tao, and the other four security guards had also moved the monitoring terminal, which was originally placed in the guest room on the first floor of the villa, to the monitoring room on the first floor of the new building. They had also recalibrated the circuit.

The four of them were assigned to a single apartment with one bedroom, one living room, and a balcony, so they were all more motivated.

Cao tieshu’s wife and the kitchen helper and janitors that Cao tieshu had helped to find had also arrived. Xia ruofei did a simple interview and found that they were all simple and honest rural women who were very active in their work. He was very satisfied.

Under the guidance of the chef sent by Ling Ji dining, Cao tieshu’s wife quickly threw herself into work. The staff cafeteria was also officially opened, and all the employees began to enjoy their free lunch. Although it was only a meal, it was very effective in gathering people’s hearts. Everyone’s enthusiasm for work was clearly raised to a higher level.

When the villagers heard that Peach Blossom Farm provided free lunch, they naturally became even more envious. They all asked the workers when Peach Blossom Farm would recruit more workers.

Naturally, the workers did not know when they would be hiring. On the day of the ribbon – cutting, it was said that they would be hiring new people, but other than recruiting two cleaners and two chefs, there had been no other news for the past two days.

What they didn’t know was that this situation happened because their boss was too lazy.

Xia ruofei wanted to wait for the new general manager to take office before he started the work.

On the third day, the professional manager that Wu Liqian had helped to contact finally arrived in Sanshan city and Taoyuan farm ...
