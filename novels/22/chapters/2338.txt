Both of them were cultivators, so their hearing was naturally much better than ordinary people. Therefore, when they heard footsteps coming from outside the door, they separated in time.

However, Song Wei’s face was still blushing. She looked like a child who had done something bad. She seemed very guilty.

The next moment, the two of them saw Fang Liyun appear at the door. She smiled and said,””Ruofei, Weiwei, come over for lunch!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei replied.

When Song Wei recalled the scene just now, she could not help but feel a little ‘guilty’. At the same time, she felt a faint sense of excitement as if she had done something bad under the eyes of her parents.

She did not dare to look at Fang Liyun and followed Xia ruofei out of the room with her head lowered.

However, Fang Liyun took another look at Song Wei. She could not help but ask curiously,”Wei Wei, why is your face so red?”

Song Wei was at a loss for words and did not know how to explain.

Xia ruofei reacted quickly and immediately said,””Oh! Aunty, Song Wei was helping me look after the stove just now! I guess you got too close and got roasted?”

“Oh ...” Fang Liyun did not doubt him and said casually,”Weiwei, remember to put on a Facial Mask later. You’re not young anymore, you have to take care of your health!” Be careful that you won’t be able to get married in the future!”

Song Wei couldn’t help but secretly roll her eyes. This was too heart – wrenching ...

Xia ruofei tried to hold back his laughter.”Auntie, you’re worrying too much. Song Wei is a natural beauty. Why would she worry about getting married?”

“Whoever’s child is whoever’s to worry about!” Fang Liyun sighed.”In the past, when she was in high school and university, we didn’t want her to fall in love. We were afraid that it would affect her studies. But now that she’s studying for her master ‘s, we’re starting to worry about her finding a partner!”

“Mom! I’m not even in a hurry, so why are you in a hurry?” Song Wei blushed and couldn’t help but say.

“It’s because you’re not in a hurry that I’m in a hurry!” Fang Liyun’s words sounded like a tongue twister, but it did make sense.

Xia ruofei saw that Song Wei was about to go berserk. He realized that he was the one who started this conversation. In order to avoid Song Wei from finding him for revenge, he decided to change the topic.

“Oh right, aunty,” Xia ruofei said,”I’ll prepare the medicine for the next few days. You have to clear out the refrigerator first!”

The change of topic was a little stiff. However, Fang Liyun was very concerned about anything related to song Qiming’s rehabilitation. Hence, Xia ruofei successfully diverted her attention.

“There’s an ice box in the living room. It’s used by your uncle song to store the tea leaves. I think it’s okay to use it to store Chinese medicine, right?” Fang Liyun said after some thought. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Yes, yes ...” Xia ruofei said.

The three of them chatted as they walked to the dining room.

The lunch was very sumptuous.

Although Fang Liyun did not want to leave song Qiming’s care to the caretaker, she did everything herself and asked Song Wei for help occasionally. Other than that, she left the rest to the domestic service staff.

For example, cooking and cleaning.

Knowing that Xia ruofei was coming over today, Fang Liyun had specially instructed the chef to make a good preparation.

Although it was not made by Fang Liyun personally, it was still a heartfelt gesture. Hence, Xia ruofei ate it with great relish and even praised it from time to time.

Fang Liyun was very happy to see Xia ruofei eating so happily. In the blink of an eye, he had finished three bowls of rice and a lot of dishes.

Xia ruofei had done so much for their family, but Fang Liyun could not think of many ways to repay him. This time, Xia ruofei was staying at her house because he was treating song Qiming. Naturally, she wanted to ensure that her life was well taken care of. Only then would she be at ease.

After lunch, Xia ruofei went back to her room to pick up the ointment that he and Song Wei had worked together to make. At the same time, he carried his small medicine box and went upstairs to treat song Qiming.

The small medicine box contained some of Xia ruofei’s usual items, such as a whole set of silver needles for acupuncture, a jar for cupping, and a horn piece for scraping sand.

Xia ruofei went to song Qiming’s side and gave him a massage to relax.

Of course, what he used was not a simple massage technique. The massage techniques from the lost medical books combined with true energy. It was not an exaggeration to say that if he was willing to become a physical therapist, he would have a steady stream of business just based on this unique skill.

Song Qiming felt as if Xia ruofei’s hand had some sort of magic. Wherever it went, there was a sense of warmth. The Tipsy feeling made him feel drowsy.

After the massage, Xia ruofei began his first acupuncture session.

He still chose to use the nine needles of the moyun technique that he was most familiar with, and used it with his genuine Qi. The effect was quite good.

The purpose of both massage and acupuncture was to relax song Qiming’s muscles and meridians, which were blocked or damaged due to external injuries, to a certain extent. This was beneficial for the absorption of the medicinal properties.

The first part of the work was auxiliary. The real effect was the ointment he specially formulated.

The ointment itself was extremely effective in treating external injuries. In addition, he had added a concentrated solution of spirit Heart Flower petals, which made the effect even better.

After the acupuncture, Xia ruofei rested for a while. Then, he put on a pair of disposable gloves and started to apply medicine for song Qiming.

There was not a lot of ointment, and most of it was used on song Qiming’s fracture.
