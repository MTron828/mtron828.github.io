Xia ruofei laughed and said,”you can even feel the minute differences in the ingredients?” Old company commander, don’t be too full of yourself!”

Then, he said to the Veterans,””Everyone, don’t just stand there. Line up and come over. One bowl for each person. Not a single one less!”

The ex – soldiers quickly formed a line and came forward to drink the soup.

At first, ma su didn’t think much of it, but soon his face changed slightly and said,””Eh? It really does seem a little different ... My head doesn’t hurt anymore! What the hell ... Why is the effect so fast?”

Xia ruofei smiled as he watched from the side. Of course, he knew what the effect of the soup would be.

The petals of the spirit Heart Flower could even cure a serious disease like old man Liu. The Veterans in front of him were only dispirited after drinking alcohol. They didn’t get sick at all. Under normal circumstances, they didn’t need to take medicine. They would recover after two days of rest. Hence, even though Xia ruofei had only added a few drops of the solution, the huge bucket of hangover soup had already diluted the solution by many times. However, the effect was still very obvious.

Xia ruofei had also added some spatial spiritual pond water.

The spirit pool water was a great help in recovering one’s mental strength. After drinking The Hangover soup with the spirit pool water and the petals of the spirit Heart Flower, everyone’s spirits were low. Naturally, they recovered quite quickly, and the effect was very good.

The ex – soldiers also finished the soup one after another. They also quickly felt the magical effect of this “unique hangover soup.”

In a short while, the Veterans in the open space in front of the dormitory building became lively again. A few of them even clamored to go for a five – kilometer cross – country run.

Ma su was also eager to give it a try. He had been a company commander for so many years and was also a person who couldn’t stay idle. Although this was no longer the Army, he couldn’t help but want to stop everyone from training well when facing a group of soldiers who had led them before.

Xia ruofei stopped him and said,””Old company commander, although everyone has recovered a lot, we still drank too much last night. Let’s rest for half a day today! Besides, you just announced that you would rest in the morning, and now you’re changing it to training. It’s not the style of the Army to change your orders so quickly!”

“Alright then!” Ma Jia said,”then let’s rest for half a day!”

In fact, Xia ruofei was the boss now, and his instructions had to be carried out firmly!

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”old company commander, come and sit with me.” Let’s have some tea, and I also want to talk to you about the upcoming work arrangements. ”

“Alright!” Ma Jia said straightforwardly,”the day we arrived, they told me that the small villa over there is where you live. I haven’t been there to visit it yet!”

“Then what are we waiting for?” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”let’s go now!”

“Let’s go!”

It was not too far from the staff dormitory to Xia ruofei’s Villa, so they did not take a car and just walked for a while.

Xia ruofei invited Ma Jia to the coffee table in the living room and sat down. He then started to boil water and prepare tea. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Xia ruofei secretly took out a small jar of Da Hong Pao from his spatial space and took it out from his pocket. He used a tea spoon to scoop some tea leaves and put them into the pot.

As he waited for the water to boil, he smiled and said,””Old company commander, have a good taste of my tea later!”

“I’ve heard that your company is also selling a type of Da Hong Pao. ” Ma Jia laughed and said,”the internet has a very high evaluation of your tea leaves. They say that the price is affordable but the quality is quite high!”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”The tea here is different from the peach blossom Da Hong Pao that our company sells on the e – commerce platform’s flagship store. The tea here is all precious for personal consumption. It’s much better than selling in bulk!”

In fact, this was the truth. Xia ruofei had harvested and made these tea leaves in the medium. Furthermore, they were from the few tea trees that he had cut from the mother tree, Da Hong Pao. These were the second – generation authentic Da Hong Pao. The tea leaves sold in the flagship store were mostly from the second or third generation cut tea trees.

“Then I’ll have to have a good taste!” Ma Jia said,”I’ve never even tried the tea leaves you sell in your online store ... On one hand, I don’t have money. On the other hand, your hunger marketing is too infuriating! Isn’t it bullsh * t that you want to snatch something to buy?”

Xia ruofei smiled awkwardly and said,””I didn’t ask much about the specific sales. It’s all the strategy set by the management team. However, it wasn’t just marketing! The output of Taoyuan’s Da Hong Pao tea leaves is indeed a little low. We can’t just release all the tea leaves at once! If that’s the case, there won’t be any tea for sale for a long time, so we can only release some of our stock at a time. ”

By then, the water was already boiling, so Xia ruofei started to make the tea. In a short while, the unique fragrance of Wu Yi Rock Tea filled the living room.

Xia ruofei picked up a cup of tea and handed it to Ma Jia, saying,””Old company commander, have a drink and see how it tastes!”

“Thank you!” Ma Jia said and took the cup.

He didn’t even realize that his attitude towards Xia ruofei was not as casual as before. Of course, this wasn’t to say that Ma Jia was snobbish. After all, they were no longer in the Army and Xia ruofei was going to be his boss. His attitude unconsciously became more polite than before.

After Ma Jia took a small sip, she said,””The fragrance of this tea is very special! Although I’ve never had any good tea before, I think it’s really good! It’s even more fragrant than the wolf King’s precious tea leaves!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”how dare you drink Wolf King’s Tea!” I have to report to him the next time I see him!”

“Don’t tell on me!” Ma Jia said,”besides, the wolf King turned a blind eye to it. When did we not take something good from his office? Hahaha ...”

The two of them chatted for a while before Xia ruofei said,”I’m usually quite busy, and I can’t keep an eye on the farm all the time, so I’ll have to trouble you with the personnel Management.”

Seeing that Xia ruofei was talking about work, Ma Jia also said seriously,””No problem! The wolf King asked me to take a break and come here in advance so that I can help you manage your team. ”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”actually, we don’t have any special tasks during this period of time. Everyone is mainly resting and recuperating. I estimate that everyone will be able to arrive in two or three days. You can organize some basic training for everyone appropriately, but don’t push it too hard.”

Xia ruofei agreed with ma SU’s idea of organizing everyone’s formation and basic physical training.

After all, some of the Veterans had left the Army for several years, and the guards were basically considered a military unit. Some of the sloppy habits of the local area were naturally not allowed to be brought in.

Many people felt that the formation training was just for show, including the Army’s very strict housekeeping standards, especially the matter of the quilt being folded into tofu blocks, which was often criticized on the internet. In fact, whether it was the formation training or the housekeeping, they were all good ways to cultivate a soldier’s discipline. Our Army was established in the hearts of the soldiers through such means.

Ma Jia had been a company commander for so many years, so he was naturally very clear about this. He nodded and said,””Don’t worry! I know what I’m doing!”

Xia ruofei said,”there are still a few things that I have to trouble you with, old company commander.” “First, everyone’s uniforms and equipment must be unified when we arrive at the guard. Old company commander, you’re in charge of asking for everyone’s opinions on the basis of seeing what kind of clothes everyone likes. American or British, it’s fine. Our Army’s clothes are also not a problem. In short, everyone’s opinions are the main priority. At the same time, it must be convenient for work. When the time comes, make a list for me, and I’ll think of a way to buy it.”

“Alright!” Ma Jia replied.

“The second would be weapons and equipment.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”similarly, we’ll first ask for opinions and then give me a list of equipment. In addition to a set of equipment, if you have any weapons that you really like, you can also bring them up. I will try my best to satisfy everyone! Of course, it’s fine as long as it’s not too outrageous. For example, there’s no need to deploy a set of Patriot missiles on the island!”

Ma Jia couldn’t help but burst into laughter and said,”I know! If that bunch of kids knew about this, who knew how happy they would be! I’ll tell them the good news when I get back!”
