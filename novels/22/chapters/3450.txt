Chapter 3451: Breaking the record (1)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei stood still on the steps and took a few deep breaths. Then, he silently circulated the “great Dao Sutra”. Soon, the boiling energy in his body was suppressed and slowly calmed down.

Now that he had walked less than twenty steps, he was relatively relaxed.

Xia ruofei was able to move freely on the steps. He could even turn his head to look back. He was about three meters above the ground, about the height of a floor. The steps behind him extended to the ground, but Ling Qingxue was no longer in the square.

Previously, when Xia ruofei was challenging the levels, he would only let Ling Qingxue temporarily hide in the spirit map space unless the situation was extremely dangerous. Otherwise, Ling Qingxue would always be behind him. Even though she could not provide any substantial help, it was a great encouragement to him.

Now that Ling Qingxue had been teleported away, even though there was a high chance that her life would not be in danger, Xia ruofei’s heart was still a little empty.

He rested for a while on this step before continuing to climb.

After all, the steps in front of him were basically not difficult for him, and the pressure could hardly shake him.

In fact, Xia ruofei was also secretly making comparisons in his heart. When Ling Qingxue was challenging the levels just now, the first part was actually easier. However, in comparison, she was not as comfortable as Xia ruofei.

Hence, Xia ruofei was more or less confident that he would be able to go further than Ling Qingxue.

As for whether or not he could reach the top, that was unknown.

After all, Ling Qingxue had only cleared one – third of the trial. The remaining two – thirds would undoubtedly be more difficult.

Of course, once he started to climb, Xia ruofei would not have any distracting thoughts and would not worry about his gains and losses. He would only focus on climbing up step by step without any distractions.

Level 30, level 40, level 50 …

This time, Xia ruofei climbed to the 50th step in one breath before stopping to rest.

This time, he continued to climb more than thirty steps, and still felt relatively relaxed. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Although the pressure was getting stronger, he was getting more and more familiar with it. He was getting more and more used to resisting it while climbing.

Xia ruofei’s expression was calm. There was no joy or sorrow on his face. He was not secretly happy because the initial difficulty was lower, nor was he worried because the pressure continued to increase. In short, there was only one thought in his mind and nothing else.

The only thought in his mind was to climb up.

As for which level he could last and whether he could reach the top, Xia ruofei did not even consider it now.

When he was resting on the 50th step, in the hidden space enshrouded in purple mist, Daoist Qing Xuan and immortal mountain river were also watching Xia ruofei’s every move in front of the bronze mirror.

Xia ruofei was the only one left in the Tower of Trials. He was the disciple of the mountain river spiritual master and he was on the last and most difficult level of the stairway to heaven. Therefore, the mountain river spiritual master would not leave the majestic hall at this time.

As for Daoist Qing Xuan, he was in charge of the trial Pagoda. He had to monitor the situation of the cultivators in the trial Pagoda at all times, so he would not leave.

The two of them were watching Xia ruofei’s challenge.

Of course, they had just started climbing, so the difficulty wasn’t high. Therefore, the two of them looked very relaxed.

One must know that Xia ruofei had so many opportunities. He was also the disciple of immortal mountain river and the cultivation technique he cultivated was the great Dao formula that even Daoist Qing Xuan coveted. If he could not even pass the 50th level, he would be a waste.

Daoist Qing Xuan took a look at the image displayed in the bronze mirror and said with a smile,””Brother mountain river, this disciple of yours seems to be rather relaxed.”

“We’ve only just started climbing, so it doesn’t mean anything. “Immortal mountain river smiled. Let’s see what happens after the 200th or 300th level!” “Oh?” Daoist Qing Xuan raised his eyebrows and asked,”it seems like brother mountain river is very confident in his disciple! Are you so sure that he can pass the 200th level?”

Immortal mountain river smiled lightly and asked,””Could it be that Daoist Qing Xuan hopes that there will be no harvest again?”

Daoist Qing Xuan was stunned and smiled bitterly.”Of course 1 don’t want to be – handed … But if this kid passes level 200,1 don’t think there’s anything to be happy about!”

Immortal mountain river laughed and pointed at Taoist priest Qing

Xuan,”Daoist Qing Xuan, are you really going to stoop to the level of a junior? If Xia ruofei can pass the 200th level, it will not only be his personal honor, but also the entire world of cultivation, isn’t it?”

Daoist priest Qing Xuan’s expression also gradually became heavy. He sighed and said,””Yup! Now that the situation is grim, we really need someone who can turn the tide! However, this child is still too young…”

“I hope he still has time to grow!” Immortal mountain river’s expression also became a little heavy.”Let’s see how he passes the stage first! Maybe he couldn’t even pass the 200th level! With the resources he has now, he can live a carefree life in the cultivation world of China.”

On the eighth level of the Tower of Trials, the Obsidian stairway.

After a short rest, Xia ruofei continued to move higher.

The 60th level, the 70th level, the 80th level, the 90th level….
