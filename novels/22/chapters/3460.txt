Qing Xuan Taoist priest and immortal mountain river could not help but whisper at the same time,””Alright!”

The two of them subconsciously lowered their voices as if they would disturb Xia ruofei if they were too loud.

In fact, Xia ruofei’s ability to stand firm on the 478th step had tied with the best record in history. The results of the early stage nascent soul cultivators of Xuanji were naturally not counted. It was specially arranged to test the difficulty of the Obsidian stairway. This was a stairway specially used by Aurous core cultivators to break through.

Back then, it was on the four hundred and seventy – eighth step that Xuan Jizi was unable to endure and was thrown out.

If Xia ruofei could stand firm on this step and take a step forward, even if he was eliminated just at the edge of the 479th step, he would have created a new record.

Reverend Shan He was very pleased. In his long cultivation life, he had taken in many disciples, some of whom had similar cultivation to him, but Xia ruofei was the most special. Reverend Shan He did not meet Xia ruofei in person, but he took Xia ruofei in with a thought that he left in the spirit map space.

Of course, more importantly, Xia ruofei was the only one among his disciples who had cultivated the great Dao Arts.

The “great way of Dao” was the life’s work of spiritual master Shan He. As for Xia ruofei, spiritual master Shan He naturally looked at him differently.

He thought highly of Xia ruofei’s talent and tenacity. He also felt that Xia ruofei would be able to achieve good results on the stairway.

But even so, immortal mountain river didn’t dare to think that Xia ruofei could break the record. After all, Xia ruofei was only in the intermediate stage of the Golden core realm. He would be at a great disadvantage in the heavenly stairs.

The reason why immortal Shanhe predicted that Xia ruofei would reach the four hundred and eightieth step during the duel was to show off in front of Taoist master Qing Xuan.

He just didn’t expect Xia ruofei to be so hardworking. The road was extremely difficult, but he was courageous and courageous, catching up with the record set by the peerless genius Xuan Jizi.

“Brother mountain river, I really envy you!” Qing Xuan said sincerely,”how did you meet such a good disciple?”

Immortal mountain river laughed and said,””l also left my precious mountain and river spiritual map in the cultivation world of the divine land. That’s how I’m fated to be here today!”

8th level of the trial Pagoda.

Xia ruofei did not know the significance of the 478th step. He did not know that he was standing at the starting point of history, so he did not feel anything.

He only knew that every inch of his skin felt like it was being torn apart, and every bone in his body was creaking. He could be crushed into pieces at any moment.

That was the truth. If Xia ruofei’s vital Qi had been exhausted and he could not maintain his defensive state, the huge pressure would have instantly crushed all the bones in his body. Even if he would be thrown out and eliminated, it would be difficult to avoid being seriously injured.

Fortunately, the spiritual pressure was not too bad. In front of Xia ruofei, whose spiritual power had reached the spiritualization realm, the Obsidian stairway’s spiritual pressure could no longer pose a substantial threat to him. Now, Xia ruofei’s biggest enemy should be the squeezing force of 500 to 600 GS.

If it was on earth, such a strong compression force would be enough to flatten the hardest material.

As a cultivator in the intermediate stage of the Golden core realm, Xia ruofei’s physical strength was stronger than many cultivators in the advanced stage of the Golden core realm. In addition, his cultivation technique was definitely one of the best in the cultivation world. His spiritual power had also reached the spiritualisation realm. It could be said that in terms of overall strength, Xia ruofei was much stronger than many cultivators in the advanced stage of the Golden core realm. Even when he was clearing the trial, his results were much better than countless cultivators in the advanced stage of the Golden core realm who had passed the stairway since ancient times.

Xia ruofei panted heavily as he circulated his martial art at full speed.

He even took out a spirit Heart Flower petal from the spirit map space and directly absorbed it in his palm to treat the many injuries on his body that had broken bones.

Ten minutes later, Xia ruofei was fully recovered. He took a deep breath and stepped onto the four hundred and seventy – ninth step.

In the hidden space enshrouded in purple mist, immortal mountain river and Daoist priest Qing Xuan heaved a long sigh of relief.

Xia ruofei’s step meant that a new record had been set.

Now, the two of them were no longer concerned about Xia ruofei’s results. Even if Xia ruofei was eliminated now, he was still the keeper of the historical record.

The outcome of the bet between Qing Xuan Taoist priest and immortal mountain river had already been decided. Once Xia ruofei passed the four hundred and sixty – fifth step, no matter what his final result was, he would definitely be closer to the result that immortal mountain river had guessed.

Therefore, Qing Xuan Taoist priest did not have the mentality of winning or losing. At the same time, he did not have the previous trace of expectation. Now, he and immortal mountain river were holding an admiring attitude, watching the process of Xia ruofei climbing each step. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

On the four hundred and seventy – ninth step, Xia ruofei still stood firmly.

After another round of adjustments, he took another step forward.

This time, it was the four hundred and eightieth step. This was the result that Daoist master mountain river had guessed.

Therefore, when Xia ruofei stepped onto the four hundred and eightieth step, immortal mountain river was also beaming with joy. The outcome of the bet was naturally important, and it was something worth being happy about since his prediction was so accurate..
