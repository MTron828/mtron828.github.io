2101 The delivery of the luxury yacht_1

Before the car stopped, Qin Lan was already standing beside the car with a smile. When Xia ruofei jumped out of the car, she immediately said,””Good Morning, Mr. Xia!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””Hello, manager Qin!”

At this moment, Ling Qingxue alighted from the car as well. Xia ruofei then introduced her,””This is my girlfriend, Ling Qingxue!”

Qin Lan quickly greeted Ling Qingxue and said enthusiastically,””Hello, miss Ling! You’re so beautiful!”

Ling Qingxue smiled and said,”thank you!” Manager Qin is also very pretty!”

“You’re overpraising!” Qin Lan replied politely and then asked,”Mr. Xia, miss Ling, shall we go directly to the dock to see the yacht or ...”

“Let’s go to the dock!” Xia ruofei said straightforwardly,”if there’s no problem with the yacht, I’ll pay the rest of the money today!”

“Alright, alright!” Qin Lan hurriedly said,”this way please!”

She waved her hand gently, and the electric car that had been arranged for them slowly drove over. The three of them got into the electric car and went straight to the yacht dock not far away.

The weather today was very good. The sky was clear for thousands of miles, and under the blue sky and white clouds, white sails were faintly visible on the sea. It was a beautiful scene.

A silver – White yacht was quietly parked in a yacht berth. Under the sunlight, the 30 – meter – long streamlined body of the boat glistened and gently rose and fell with the rhythm of the waves.

“It’s so beautiful!” Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but exclaim in admiration. Then, she took Xia ruofei’s hand and asked,”ruofei, is this the yacht?”

Xia ruofei had already seen many pictures of the azmu 100 Leonardo from various angles. Naturally, he could recognize it at first glance.

Although there were a few yachts docked at the yacht Pier, there was only one yacht that was 100 Leonardo. Hence, the answer was self – evident.

He chuckled and nodded,”that’s right!” Qingxue, to be able to buy a yacht like this for less than 70 million without waiting, it’s definitely worth it, right?”

“Yes, yes!” Ling Qingxue nodded her head and said,”it looks pretty good!”

At this moment, the electric car stopped beside the yacht. Qin Lan smiled and greeted,””Mr. Xia, miss Ling, this way please!”

Qin Lan led Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue to the deck of the yacht. The dark – skinned yacht pilot, Liu Yi, was already standing on the deck to welcome them.

“Hello, Mr. Xia, we meet again!” Liu Yi greeted him warmly.

As a yacht pilot, Liu Yi had seen many rich people. However, it was the first time he had seen someone like Xia ruofei who bought two yachts at once.

Xia ruofei remembered Liu Yi as he was the one who tried driving the yacht for him.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”old Liu, you’re helping me drive the yacht again today!” You’ve worked hard!”

Liu Yi grinned and said,”you don’t have to be so polite. It’s part of my job!” Mr. Xia, you can take a look around first. I’ll go and make some preparations. ” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Today, Xia ruofei was definitely going to try out the yacht. Liu Yi needed to do some preparation work before setting sail.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.

Liu Yi went to the driver’s seat in the cabin while Qin Lan took Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue on a tour of the luxury yacht.

The huge open deck, the extremely comfortable stern deck, the unique ocean viewing platform, the Super large master bedroom, the various luxurious interior decorations, lighting equipment, and so on were all introduced in detail by Qin Lan to the two of them.

Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue quickly fell in love with the luxury yacht. To the rich, this yacht was like a Palace on the sea. It was definitely the best enjoyment to go out on this yacht.

After touring the place, Qin Lan asked,””Mr. Xia, miss Ling, are we going to go out to sea next? You can also experience the performance of this yacht in actual use. ”

“Sure!” Xia ruofei nodded.

Qin Lan immediately went to the cockpit to inform Liu Yi to start the yacht.

The yacht slowly accelerated, leaving a spray of water as it sailed out to the open sea.

Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue stood on the highest observation deck, facing the blowing sea breeze. They looked at the beautiful scenery on the sea and felt relaxed and happy.

Qin Lan also came to the observation deck to chat with Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue.

However, she was not like Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue, who were cultivators. In the cold weather, the sea breeze was blowing, and she felt that she could not hold on for long.

Xia ruofei could tell as well, so he smiled and said,””Manager Qin, let’s take a look inside the cabin!”

Qin Lan looked at Xia ruofei gratefully and said,””Alright, alright!”

The three of them went down the observation platform and came to the warm cabin. Only then did Qin Lan’s almost frozen body slowly start to feel something.

Ling Qingxue was also very interested in how a yacht was driven, so Xia ruofei brought her to the cockpit.

Liu Yi was steering the yacht. When he saw Xia ruofei and the others come in, he did not stand up. He just turned around to say hello and then focused on steering the yacht.

“Mr. Xia, you can entrust your yacht to our club for management and maintenance. If you need to use it, you just need to make an appointment an hour in advance. We will arrange for the most professional yacht pilot to serve you!” Qin Lan said with a smile.

Xia ruofei nodded, but his heart was slightly moved.

He sat down beside Liu Yi and asked with a smile,””Liu, does driving a yacht require a driver’s license, just like driving a car?”

Liu Yi smiled.”Of course. We all have to go through a strict examination before we can take the job. The difference between a yacht driver’s license and a car driver’s license is that it is issued by the maritime department. The vehicle Administration doesn’t have the authority to do so.”
