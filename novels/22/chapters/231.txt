Chapter 232: Chapter 228 – busy (1)

“Don’t worry, we’ll do our best for boss Xia’s project!” Manager Li said quickly. Xia ruofei also smiled and said,”brother Liang, manager li is not bad.” When we were building this farm, he was watching the construction site every day. You’ve seen the final project. It can be used as a sample project!” “My brother’s matters are my matters, so I definitely didn’t say anything!” Liang Qichao laughed and said,”if we don’t do it well, wouldn’t we be slapping ourselves in the face?” “Boss Xia, let’s have a brief discussion today. Let me know if you have any requirements or ideas.” Manager Li said,”I’ll come up with a design plan later.” Xia ruofei nodded and said,”Yes, manager li. I’m considering building a six – story building. The first and second floors will be used as offices. The third floor and above will be employees ‘apartments. At the same time, we’ll reserve some rooms for future use.” The office and living floors were relatively isolated, so it was best to pass through different entrances in front and behind without interfering with each other. As for the exterior design, I don’t know much about it. You’re experienced, so just do it according to your ideas first and let me have a look later. ” “Alright,” he said. Manager Li said as he jotted down notes in his notebook. Then, the two of them discussed some more details, including the area, direction, and so on. Manager li also gave some suggestions of his own, many of which were details that Xia ruofei had not thought of. For example, the broadband expansion in the villa used to be home broadband, but now it was used for office use, so the bandwidth would definitely need to be increased. After settling the details, Liang Qichao left Peach Blossom Farm with manager li. Manager li would work overtime to come up with a design plan when he returned, and Xia ruofei only had to give the final approval. Before they got into the car, Liang Qichao kept reminding Xia ruofei to pay more attention to the Phoebe zhennan material. Xia ruofei naturally smiled and agreed to Qianqian’s request to earn money for himself. He would do it well even without Liang Qichao’s instructions. After Liang Qichao left, Xia ruofei also drove away from Taoyuan farm. He drove the Knight XV straight to the real estate transaction Center in the city, and the transfer of the villa was stuck at a certain step. This required the presence of both the buyer and the seller or an authorized agent, so he called Guan Ping as soon as he came back and made an appointment to do it today. Xia ruofei parked his car and went to the real estate trading center. He saw Guan Ping and Zhao Xueqing waiting at the door. The moment they met, Guan Ping started to complain that Xia ruofei was not reliable. Xia ruofei also looked like he was accepting the criticism humbly. He smiled and allowed Guan Ping to scold him. After that, he even took the initiative to apologize to Zhao Xueqing, saying that he had an urgent matter and had to leave the three mountains, delaying everyone’s time. Zhao Xueqing was very polite and smiled, indicating that it was fine. Everyone walked towards the real estate trading center. Xia ruofei purposely stayed a few steps behind and nudged Guan Ping with his arm. He asked in a low voice,”Little ping, how’s your relationship with sister Zhao?” “What do you mean how is it? Just a normal customer relationship!” Guan Ping’s eyes were evasive. “You’re playing dumb, right?” Xia ruofei laughed.”Should I call sister Zhao over to ask?” Xia ruofei was about to call Zhao Xueqing. Guan Ping quickly covered Xia ruofei’s mouth and smiled bitterly,””RUO Fei, you’d better spare me!” “Can you tell me now?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile. “What are you talking about?” Guan Ping scratched his head and said,”sister Zhao ... She’s currently single, but I don’t know if she’s interested in me ...” “You’re already single, why are you still hesitating?” Xia ruofei widened his eyes and asked,”go! All kinds of offensive attacks were taking turns! Weren’t you quite popular with women when you were in school?” “Go! Do I have as much luck with women as you do?” Guan Ping said,”back then, you didn’t even touch a basketball when you were on the court! The girls at the side of the court kept screaming ...” “I can’t help it, I’m good looking!” Xia ruofei smiled proudly. “Tsk ...” Guan Ping expressed his disdain. “But then again, you weren’t bad back then!” Xia ruofei said,”why are you so nervous when you’re working?” Guan Ping smiled bitterly.”Sister Zhao started her own company. Although she’s not very rich, her family property is at least a few million Yuan. I’m just a real estate agent. I don’t have anything I want ... Forget it!” After stepping into society, people would become more realistic. It was no wonder that Guanping felt inferior. The difference in material conditions between the two sides was too big. Xia ruofei said seriously,”little ping, I have to say this to you. The most unacceptable thing for a person is to belittle himself. You’re a real estate agent now. Are you going to be a real estate agent for the rest of your life?” When you meet a girl you like, you have to be brave and chase after her. If you can’t get her, then there’s nothing to say, but if you don’t even chase after her, you’ll definitely regret it in the future!” “I know, ruofei.” Guan Ping said,”thank you!” Xia ruofei grinned and said,”it’ll be noon by the time we’re done today. Why don’t you try to ask her out for lunch?” You don’t need me to teach you how to chase girls, do you?” “En!” Guan Ping nodded his head heavily. Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”if you’re not happy with your job at the agency, you can work for me.” Chubby boy is working in my company now! You’re here to help manage the sales, and it’s basically the same as your current business. When our company develops, all of you will be at the gold collar level. By then, you won’t have to worry about not being able to match your social status, right?” Guan Ping revealed a touched expression,”Alright, ruofei, I’ll consider it carefully! Thanks!” Xia ruofei patted Guan Ping’s shoulder and said, “Let’s go!” Xia ruofei left immediately after signing a few documents at the real estate Center and completing the process. The next time he came, it would be the final signature and confirmation, as well as the transfer of money. Both parties trusted each other, so they did not open a guarantee account at the bank. Instead, they would wait for the transfer to be completed before transferring the money. As for whether Guan Ping could get Zhao Xueqing on a date, it was his own business. Xia ruofei could not care so much. Anyway, he had already said what needed to be said. In the next few days, Xia ruofei was also busy with the farm. For example, he cut the succulent plants again and put some of the seedlings from last time on the internet for sale. In addition, he also made some preparations for cutting down the Phoebe zhennan wood. There was also the arrangement of the vegetable field in the interspace. In a few days, the vegetable greenhouse of Tao Yuan farm would enter a virtuous cycle and Xia ruofei could clear the vegetable field in the interspace. After leaving for a few days, Xia ruofei had accumulated a lot of work. He spent these few days in a busy manner. Three days later, manager Lu called Xia ruofei and told him that elder song had arrived in Sanshan city. Hence, Xia ruofei, who thought he could take a break, started to prepare Chinese medicine for elder song’s follow – up examination.ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m
