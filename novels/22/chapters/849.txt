Chapter 850: The invisible key (2)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei knew that the time was right. He carefully opened a small gap in the space that he had confined and guided the spiritual power that had almost been condensed to the extreme to leak out from the small gap.

Just like that, his spiritual power was pulled into a thin line.

Although it was almost invisible to the naked eye, Xia ruofei could clearly sense the existence of this thin thread of spiritual power.

He immediately followed the shape of the rune in his mind, guiding the thin thread of spiritual force to extend, turn, transform, and shuttle ...

Xia ruofei could feel an invisible rune slowly forming in front of him.

This process was very slow. Under his careful control, it took him more than ten minutes to complete less than thirty percent.

Besides, the runes were too complicated. Xia ruofei felt that there was only a slight deviation in the control and the runes he drew were already wrong.

Although this mistake was very small, it already meant that this attempt had failed.

This was because the rune had to be drawn in one stroke to be an effective rune, and there was no chance to go back and modify it.

Xia ruofei sighed. He released his control of his spiritual power and kept them back into his body.

Xia ruofei did not expect to succeed on his first try. However, after trying, he felt that the difficulty was beyond his expectations.

“Looks like I’ll have to work hard to succeed!” Xia ruofei muttered to himself.

He didn’t try again. It was almost noon when he got home. He spent a lot of time patrolling the space, activating the Halo shield, and trying to draw the human rune. It was time for lunch.

If he wanted to successfully draw out a complete rune, he still needed a lot of time to practice. This was not something that could be done overnight.

Hence, Xia ruofei left the medium.

He didn’t bring the human – shaped jade talisman with him. Instead, he left it on the stone platform. There was no place safer than the spirit map space. It was simply a super safe.

Xia ruofei quickly took a shower, changed into clean clothes, and went downstairs. Hu Zi’s mother had indeed prepared lunch. Lin Qiao had also returned from the office building.

Lin Qiao already knew that Xia ruofei had returned home. When she saw him coming downstairs, she immediately asked for a gift. Xia ruofei was already prepared for this. He took out some silver ornaments and beautiful crafts that he had bought in the Tibetan area.

These Tibetan – style gifts were very beautiful and were perfect for the little girl. Lin Qiao accepted them with joy.

After having lunch at home, Xia ruofei chatted with Lin Qiao and Hu Zi’s mother for a while before going back to his room.

Xia ruofei had been away for a few days. He should have gone to understand the company’s operations first, but he had a break in the afternoon and did not want to disturb Feng Jing and the other executives.

Besides, Xia ruofei had more important things to do.

After he returned to his room, he used his phone to give Lin Yue ‘e a call. Yingying, now that the matter of the aweto had been settled, he had returned to the three mountains. It was time to bring Lin Yue’ e and her family over.

“RUO Fei.” Lin Yue ‘E’s gentle voice came from the phone.

“Sister – in – Law! I’ve already finished my business and returned to the three mountains. ” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”how are the preparations on your side? Can you come over now?”

Lin Yue ‘e clearly didn’t have much confidence in her heart. She hesitated for a moment before saying,””Ruofei, I’ve settled everything at home ... But, what can sister – in – Law do at your company? I ... I’ve never worked in a big company before!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”sister – in – Law, we’ve already agreed on this. Why are you backing out?” Besides, it’s not a big company, just a small one. More than half of our employees are ordinary villagers from nearby. They can do the job, so how can you not do it?”

Lin Yue ‘e said with some embarrassment,””Alright...Ruofei, what do you want me to do?”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”sister – in – Law, I have a few positions here. What do you like to do?” The first is to be the Deputy Director of our company’s logistics department. You just have to manage the company’s warehouse, cold storage, and some things like the purchase of office supplies. The specific things will be done by the people below, and you will be in charge of commanding. ”

Lin Yue ‘e thought for a moment before asking,”are there any other positions?” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Actually, the job that Xia ruofei had offered was very easy. It did not require much exposure to the elements. However, Lin Yue ‘e felt that Xia ruofei was obviously taking care of her. Otherwise, why would he leave such a good position for her to take?

“There’s also the orchard manager,”Xia ruofei said. Sister – in – Law, didn’t you say last time that you used to take care of the small orchard in your house? This was the right specialization, right? There are also specialized workers in the orchard. You’re mainly in charge of the management. ”

As the business continued to expand, Xia ruofei had long wanted to separate the orchard from the rest of the business. This way, Cao tieshu could also focus on the vegetable greenhouse.

Old Cao was indeed a hardworking old cow who did his job with all his heart and soul, but he couldn’t always be the only one using him!

“Sister – in – Law, if you don’t like this position, I still have ...” Xia ruofei continued.

“No need. Ruofei, let’s take the one in the orchard! This is suitable for me. ” Lin Yue ‘e hurriedly said.
