Translator: 549690339

Everyone ate and chatted. After a while, the song family members from the other tables went to the main table to propose a toast to elder song.

Song Rui smiled at Xia ruofei and said,””Ruofei, why don’t you take everyone to propose a toast! The host table’s aura is too strong, we can’t even hold it when we go alone!”

Liu Jian and the others nodded like chickens pecking at rice. The people sitting at the main table were all their elders, as well as a “divine beast” level chief like elder song, director Zhang of the central Criminal Investigation Department, and others. These usually fearless Playboys didn’t even dare to breathe loudly in front of them. Therefore, in the past, they would always “group up” to toast at such occasions.

Song Rui was supposed to be the ‘leader’, but now that he suggested that Xia ruofei bring them there, they didn’t think it was unreasonable. Instead, they felt that it was very appropriate.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and nodded.””It’s good to go over and offer a toast. ”

Everyone waited for a while and saw an opening. Xia ruofei stood up and led them to the main table. Even the cold Lu You was no exception. She held her wine glass and followed Xia ruofei.

This group of people was a big target and immediately attracted everyone’s attention.

Xia ruofei walked over quickly and said with a smile,””Chief, let’s toast to you. We wish you good health and a long life!”

Eccentric song laughed and joked,”Little Xia is quite qualified to be the ‘table leader’! I need to be praised!”

The leaders at the main table also let out kind laughter.

Xia ruofei took the lead, and the other young people also came over to say a few auspicious words. Elder song was in a good mood. He smiled and nodded his head to thank them, then drank a glass of wine with them.

Then, Xia ruofei led everyone to toast to the other leaders at the main table.

At the level of these leaders, it was natural for them to make toasts one by one. However, they were all the elders of these young people’s families, and today’s main character, elder song, had already made a private toast. So, other than director Zhang, who represented the central Scout Academy to celebrate elder song’s birthday, the rest of the leaders made a toast together.

In front of their own juniors and the leader was the amazing young man, Xia ruofei, these leaders naturally did not put on any airs and everyone had a drink together.

General Zhao chuckled and said to Xia ruofei,””Xiao Xia, don’t rush back this time. Let Yongjun show you around the capital!”

Zhao Yongjun knew that song Rui was not lying. Xia ruofei had a deep relationship with his father. He was even more curious, but he could not ask in front of so many people. He could only keep it in his heart and ask his father when he got home.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”general Zhao, I came to the capital city for the company’s matters. I’ll have to rush back after I’m done. Our new product will be launched soon. There’s a lot of work to do!”

“Xiao Xia,” Zhao Cheng said with a smile.”You call director Tian ‘Auntie’ and Secretary song ‘uncle’. Do you have to treat me like an outsider and call me general Zhao?”

The last time Xia ruofei had treated Zhao Cheng, he had called him general Zhao. Zhao Cheng had thought that Xia ruofei was only a highly skilled Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioner, so he had called him “doctor Xia”. Today, he had found out that Xia ruofei had a close relationship with the song family, so he had naturally grown closer to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment. He smiled and said,””Then I’ll call you uncle Zhao!”

Zhao Cheng laughed and said,”that’s right!” RUO Fei! The company’s matters can be handled by the people below. You’re the boss, so what’s the problem with going back a few days later? It’s rare for you to come to the capital, so let Yongjun play with you for a few days!”

Seeing Zhao Cheng’s enthusiasm, Xia ruofei could only nod and say,””Alright, thank you, uncle Zhao!”

“Oh right, the new product that your company launched, Yu ... Yu something?” Zhao Cheng continued.

Tian Huilan reminded him with a smile,”Jaded skin cream!”

“Yes, jaded skin cream!” Zhao Cheng slapped his thigh and said,”get me some of it too. It’s time for my husband to take good care of himself ... Also, the Drunken Eight Immortals wine you sent me last time ... I can’t even taste Maotai after drinking it! Send me more when you’re free!”

Xia ruofei’s heart warmed. He immediately said,””No problem, uncle Zhao. I’ll give the jaded skin cream to brother Zhao tomorrow. As for the wine ... I’ll mail it to you after I return to the three mountains!”

With Zhao Cheng’s status, how could he not have any skincare products and white wine? Moreover, the Drunken Eight Immortals was currently being sold all over the country. Even if there weren’t many of them in the capital, how could Zhao Cheng not be able to buy them if he really wanted to? Xia ruofei knew that Zhao Cheng was helping him promote and at the same time, expressing his gratitude. He was very grateful.

Sure enough, after the other leaders at the table heard Zhao Cheng’s words, they couldn’t help but look at Xia ruofei.

Zhao Cheng was a high – ranking military officer and had a high status among the leaders who were close to the song family. Since he treated Xia ruofei differently, Xia ruofei’s importance in the hearts of the other leaders increased.

After the toasts, they returned to their seats. Liu Jian and the other Playboys were even more impressed with Xia ruofei.

Just now, when they went to the main table to toast, they were all like obedient babies, not even daring to breathe loudly. Only Xia ruofei was still very calm. He even spoke with confidence like the god of death, general Zhao. This group of young people was just short of worshiping Him.
