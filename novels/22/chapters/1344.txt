Xia ruofei squinted his eyes and looked at Tian Xiaojun.

A faint smile hung on Tian Xiaojun’s face. He did not avoid Xia ruofei’s gaze at all, as if he had Xia ruofei in the palm of his hand.

From Tian Xiaojun’s point of view, after his “explanation,” the village boss in front of him should be able to understand the situation very well, and the following conversation would enter the rhythm that he had set.

Tian Xiaojun even thought that he might have a chance to flirt with the long – legged beauty next to Xia ruofei. He felt that if he showed his strength, the other party would at least doubt Xia ruofei’s ability, if not throw herself into his arms. Then, he would have a chance to win her over with a little trick.

Especially when they showed their fangs and kicked Xia ruofei out of Paradise Corporation, he didn’t believe that this beauty would still follow Xia ruofei who had nothing.

As Tian Xiaojun thought about it, he glanced at Ling Qingxue, and his mind was filled with thoughts.

At this moment, Xia ruofei said,”I understand the ‘truth’ you’re talking about. My answer is: No way!”

Tian Xiaojun was a little absent – minded, but he replied, “That’s the way! He who understands the times will act ...”

At this point, he realized that Xia ruofei’s answer was not what he wanted. His face darkened and he stared coldly into Xia ruofei’s eyes.”What did you just say?”

Xia ruofei shrugged his shoulders and said to Ling Qingxue,””Look at him, not only is there something wrong with his brain, but there’s also something wrong with his ears ... What’s even rarer is that he’s physically disabled but still so determined. Even in this state, he still doesn’t forget to take money from home ...”

Ling Qingxue was originally filled with anger, but after hearing Xia ruofei’s words, she couldn’t help but burst out laughing.

This alluring smile seemed to raise the temperature of the cold winter by a little, and it was also like a flower blooming on her face.

However, Tian Xiaojun was no longer in the mood to admire the beauty. He could feel his anger rising rapidly. When he saw Xia ruofei’s lips curl up into a sneer, he was even more furious.

Tian Xiaojun stared into Xia ruofei’s eyes, gritted his teeth, and said,””You’re playing with me?”

Xia ruofei spread his hands and said,”you’re the ones who sent yourself to me!” I’m free anyway!”

When Ling Qingxue heard this, she couldn’t help but laugh again.

The hot – tempered Xia Ling stood up and pointed at Xia ruofei’s nose.”Grandson! Are you tired of living? You dare to make fun of us!”

Xia Ling’s murderous look made Ling Qingxue’s expression change slightly. Xia ruofei calmly grabbed Ling Qingxue’s hand and gently patted the back of her hand. Then, he said calmly,”I hate it when people point at my nose. I’ll let you off this time since it’s your first offense. If you point at me again ...”

Xia Ling was so angry that she laughed out loud. He took two steps forward and stood in front of Xia ruofei. Then, he reached out and pointed at Xia ruofei’s nose. This time, his nose was almost touching Xia ruofei ‘s, but Xia ruofei did not even blink and just looked at Xia Ling quietly.

“Grandson!” Xia Ling said arrogantly. So what if he pointed again? He’s just a village boss, why is he acting like a big – tailed Wolf?”

Xia ruofei knocked on the armrest of the chair with one hand and held Ling Qingxue’s hand with the other. He said indifferently,””I can’t do anything, just ...”

As Xia ruofei spoke, Xia Ling was still looking at Xia ruofei with a disdainful expression. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

But suddenly, he felt his vision blur. Xia ruofei was sitting there without moving, but he was shocked to find that his finger had been grabbed by Xia ruofei. Then, he felt a sharp pain and couldn’t help but scream.

The whole process was very troublesome to describe, but it actually happened in an instant.

Xia ruofei quickly retracted his hand and gently grabbed Ling Qingxue’s soft hand. Even his posture was exactly the same as before.

This scene was even stranger in the eyes of Tian Xiaojun and Zhong Zixin.

They could clearly see Xia ruofei stand up, grab Xia Ling’s finger, pinch it gently, and then sit back down.

The process seemed slow in their eyes, but in reality, it was as fast as lightning. In the blink of an eye, Xia ruofei had completed all the movements.

One was fast and the other was slow, forming a strong contrast.

Tian Xiaojun and the others could only watch helplessly, but they did not have the time to help. By the time they came to their senses, Xia Ling was already holding her finger and screaming in pain.

Xia ruofei then continued what he had been saying,””It’s just to make you remember! This time, I’ll give you a light punishment. If you dare to point your finger at my nose again, I’ll break your finger! Whoever wants to try, you can come over ...”

Tian Xiaojun quickly walked to Xia Ling’s side and saw that her index finger was already swollen at a speed visible to the naked eye. Even if her bone was not injured, this injury was still very serious.

Tian Xiaojun couldn’t help but feel a trace of fear. He had clearly seen Xia ruofei lightly pinch Xia Ling’s finger just now, but it actually caused such an obvious swelling. How much strength did he have to use?

Could it be that this guy was also a martial arts expert? Tian Xiaojun muttered in his heart.

However, he was not too afraid. What era was this? One would never be able to defeat the powerful state apparatus if they were aggressive. No matter how good Xia ruofei was, could he be better than the fully armed police? Could they be more powerful than an Army equipped with heavy firearms?
