Chapter 1831: Qingxue’s cultivation (1)

Translator: 549690339

Ling Qingxue was not in a deep sleep. When Xia ruofei opened the door, she frowned and slowly opened her sleepy eyes.

After seeing Xia ruofei’s figure, Ling Qingxue slowly sat up and said,””You’re back so quickly?”

Ling Qingxue, who was still a little sleepy, had a different kind of lazy charm, which made Xia ruofei’s heart beat faster. If it was not for the bowl of medicine in his hand, he might have immediately started a fight with Ling Qingxue.

However, now was not the time. This small bowl of medicine had cost Xia ruofei five spiritual crystals. It was not an exaggeration to say that it was worth a city. Even though Xia ruofei’s hand was extremely stable, he was still very careful when he went upstairs.

Xia ruofei smiled.”I’ve been back for a while. Look ... I’ve already brewed the medicine for you!”

Ling Qingxue’s sleepiness was gone when she heard that. She quickly got out of bed and asked,”I can start cultivating after drinking this medicine?”

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”it should be about time ... Come, drink your medicine!” The temperature is just right ...”

“En!” Ling Qingxue nodded and carefully took the bowl of medicine, drinking it all in one gulp.

She had already drunk it once, so she was prepared for the bitter taste. After drinking it, she immediately ran to open the bedside table, took two candies, and put them in her mouth.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh. You’re well prepared!”

Ling Qingxue smiled a little embarrassedly and said,””I’m going to wash up!”

“En!” Xia ruofei nodded.

Ling Qingxue went into the bathroom while Xia ruofei folded the blanket on the bed. Although he had left the Army for a year or two, Xia ruofei still maintained the living habits of the Army. Although he was not a clean freak, the room was always in a very clean state. The blanket was also folded neatly according to the tofu block folding method.

Of course, the soft duvet couldn’t produce the effect of tofu blocks.

Xia ruofei smoothed out the bed sheet and opened the window for some fresh air.

Girls usually took a longer time to dress up. Xia ruofei had tidied up the room, but Ling Qingxue had not come out yet. So, he went to the balcony connected to the room, took out a cigarette, and started smoking.

After finishing a cigarette, Ling Qingxue finally walked out of the bathroom.

Her hair was still wet, and it was obvious that she had just taken a shower.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but whistle and said,””Wow! A beauty in a bath!” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Ling Qingxue’s face turned red. She glanced at Xia ruofei and asked,””Ruofei, how long will it take to absorb the medicinal properties of this Chinese medicine?”

Xia ruofei didn’t think much of it and said,””It should be very fast. There are very precious herbs in here, and the absorption speed is much faster than ordinary herbs. It should be done in a while!”

When Ling Qingxue heard this, she couldn’t help but raise her eyebrows and say,””Alright! You were lying to me last time!”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment. He then remembered that he seemed to have used the excuse of helping her absorb the medicinal properties as an excuse to shamelessly pull Ling Qingxue into the sheets.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but say,”girl, you’ve learned a lot!” I was wondering why I suddenly asked this question! You dug a hole for me to jump into?”

Ling Qingxue pouted and said,”who asked you to be so bad!” You only know how to bully me. I thought ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”do you think we have to have a go at it today?” Wife, I was wrong. For the sake of absorbing the medicinal properties, it’s best to ...”

“Stop it!” Ling Qingxue said angrily,”I’d be a fool if I believed you!”

Xia ruofei touched his nose and said,””Then ... Why don’t we just treat it as a tuition fee ... We’re free now anyway ...”

“There’s no need to use that ... To pay school fees!” Ling Qingxue said in a bad mood.

“Why not?” Xia ruofei argued,”didn’t you see the news? Nowadays, some high school students often call beasts ...”

“Hey! That’s a very rare scum, alright?” Ling Qingxue said,”your thoughts are too dirty. I can’t be bothered to talk to you ...”

“You actually dare to look down on me!” Xia ruofei said,”it seems like I’ll have to teach you a lesson today!”

After Xia ruofei finished speaking, he put on a fierce look and approached Ling Qingxue with a smirk on his face.

Ling Qingxue also played along and acted as if she had lost all color in her face, begging for mercy.

Of course, the two of them only played around for a while. They did not really want to have sex. After all, Xia ruofei did not have the mood to do so. He was still concerned about the effect of Ling Qingxue’s medicine.

It could be said that the effects of the medicine this time would directly determine the heights that Ling Qingxue would be able to reach in her cultivation in the future. After all, there was no longer much meaning in taking the heart – concentrating grass a third time. The effects would be very poor, and the price to pay would be too great.

Of course, Xia ruofei did not worry too much about the gains and losses. Ling Qingxue’s current situation was worse than the others. Even if she did not use the heart – concentrating grass, she still met the minimum requirements for cultivation. It was just that her talent was slightly mediocre. Her future achievements might not be as high as Song Wei ‘s.

After taking the heart – concentrating herb, if his talent could be improved again, it would be a happy ending. If the effect was not obvious, Xia ruofei could accept it.

The two sat and chatted for a while. Xia ruofei estimated that it was about time, so he stood up and smiled.””Qingxue, give me your hand. I’ll check it for you.”
