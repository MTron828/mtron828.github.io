Chapter 3440: You’re still the ruthless one (2)

Translator: 549690339

In the hidden space enshrouded in purple mist, the green – robed old man almost choked to death. What the hell was with taking the initiative to establish a connection? It couldn’t have really recognized him as its master, right? What was going on?

On the seventh floor of the trial Pagoda.

Xia ruofei was also in a state of shock. Ever since Ling Qingxue had easily lifted her hand into the barrier, he felt that his brain was not enough.

After hearing Ling Qingxue’s words, Xia ruofei could not help but scratch his head. He asked,””Take the initiative to establish contact? What do you mean?”

Ling Qingxue herself was confused. She said,””It’s to take the initiative to establish contact! This crystal card was the core control of the heavenly cloud Palace. Through it, one could control the entire heavenly cloud Palace. This information was given to me by the crystal card! Also … I… I think…”

“What do you mean?” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel anxious.”Hurry up and tell me! Please don’t let there be any side effects!”

Ling Qingxue quickly replied,”no!” No! RUO Fei means … I seem to be able to control this cloud Palace, and even … To the extent that I can keep the entire cloud Palace! I don’t know why…” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Xia ruofei was dumbfounded. After a while, he muttered,””This … Establishing a connection … So this is master recognition!”

“Master?” Ling Qingxue was still in a daze.

“You’re saying that the crystal plate is the core control of the heavenly cloud Palace. It then established a connection with you on its own, so that you can control the heavenly cloud Palace and even keep it?” Xia ruofei asked.

“Yeah!”

“Isn’t this a master recognition? It means that you are now the master of the cloud Palace!” Xia ruofei said. Then, he couldn’t help but slap his head and said,”that’s not right! There’s still someone who took the initiative to recognize a master? And didn’t they usually drip blood on it to recognize a master? You didn’t do anything just now!”

If Xia ruofei could not understand, Ling Qingxue would naturally be clueless. She was in a daze throughout the entire process.

Hence, after hearing Xia ruofei’s words, Ling Qingxue could not help but feel worried. She asked,'”‘RUO Fei, this … There shouldn’t be any problems, right?”

Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue could not figure it out no matter how much they thought about it. However, in the hidden space enshrouded in purple mist, the elder in the green Daoist robe heard their conversation and suddenly came to a realization.

He seemed to have understood the reason.

The green – robed elder couldn’t help but cry out,””Could it be that this girl has fairy Lingbo’s bloodline? She was the descendant of fairy Lingbo? This … This was too unbelievable! However, this was the only explanation. Otherwise, why would the heavenly cloud Palace take the initiative to recognize him as its master? Fairy Lingbo actually had descendants, and they even had her bloodline aura… Wait! Could she be the reincarnation of fairy Lingbo? No, no, the time doesn’t match …”

The green – robed old man’s emotions were in turmoil, and he had lost his usual calm demeanor as he muttered to himself.

On the seventh level of the Tower of Trials, Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue did not know what was going on and could not give a reason.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said with uncertainty,””There shouldn’t be any problems! This was a good thing! Qingxue, are you sure you can control the entire cloud Palace?”

Ling Qingxue nodded and said,”I’m sure!” Now, as long as I want to, I can clearly know the situation in any corner of the cloud Palace. I tried to control it just now and there was no problem! Do you want me to try again?”

“How do we try?” Xia ruofei was confused.

“You’ll know soon enough!”Ling Qingxue smiled.

Just when Xia ruofei was still confused, he heard footsteps approaching. He quickly turned his head and saw two late – Stage golden elixir realm puppets charging towards him with killing intent.

Xia ruofei hurriedly pulled Ling Qingxue behind him to protect her. At the same time, he took out the qushuang flying sword and the blue immortal sword.

Ling Qingxue giggled and said,”ruofei, don’t be nervous. I’m the one who transferred them over!” They won’t hurt you!”

“Look at their murderous auras. Do they look like they won’t hurt me?” Xia ruofei said.

Ling Qingxue pursed her lips and smiled,”that’s because the order I gave them just now was to kill you!” But I’ve already changed it, look!”

Xia ruofei looked over doubtfully and saw that the two puppets no longer had the murderous look on their faces.

And when they came close, they just stood at the steps of the gazebo with their hands down, more obedient than a cat.

Xia ruofei looked at the two puppets in shock, then looked at Ling Qingxue and said,””This is amazing! Qingxue! There were so many puppets and monsters in the heavenly cloud Palace! You’ll have so many more fighters, I won’t be your match in the future!”

Xia ruofei had just gone through many rounds in the cloud Palace. He knew the strength of those monsters and he had to take risks to pass many rounds.

Ling Qingxue proudly raised her chin and said,””Now you’re afraid! Let’s see if you still dare to bully me in the future!”

Xia ruofei pretended to be afraid and raised his hands.””I don’t dare! I don’t dare! Fairy, please spare me!”

Ling Qingxue laughed so hard that she couldn’t even straighten her back.

After a while, Ling Qingxue asked again,””By the way, ruofei, I think I can take away the entire cloud heaven Palace! Are we going to accept it?”

Xia ruofei replied without hesitation,”of course!” Such a good magic weapon, if he didn’t take it, was he going to keep it for the new year? Didn’t you always say how good it would be if we could live in this Palace? If you take it away now, Won’t You Be able to live in it whenever you want in the future?”

In the hidden space enshrouded in purple mist, the green – robed elder also came back to his senses. He shouted,””No! I can’t accept it! If you take it away, what about my seventh level of the Tower of Trials?”

The heavenly cloud Palace was the main building of the seventh level of the Tower of Trials. All the tests were completed in the heavenly cloud Palace.

If the heavenly cloud Palace was taken away, then wouldn’t the seventh level of the Tower of Trials only exist in name?

Wouldn’t it be a joke if the nine – Level Tower of Trials was suddenly missing one level?

However, Ling Qingxue and Xia ruofei, who were in the heavenly cloud Palace, could not hear what the green – robed elder had said.

And even if she did, Ling Qingxue would not listen to the green – robed elder’s words. She would only listen to Xia ruofei.

Besides, why can’t I take a talisman that I got with my own ability?

Alright! In fact, Ling Qingxue’s success in obtaining the numinous Sky Hall was largely due to luck.

But luck was also a part of strength, wasn’t it?

Hence, after Ling Qingxue heard Xia ruofei’s words, she immediately nodded and said,””Good! Then let’s take the cloud heaven Palace away!”

Ling Qingxue then smiled and said,””RUO Fei, since we are going to keep the heavenly cloud Palace, we have to go out first.”

“That’s for sure! Right, how do I get out? Should we return the way we came?” Xia ruofei asked,”is there a back door in the cloud Palace? It’s quite far from the front entrance!”

Ling Qingxue smiled and said,”there’s no need to go through so much trouble. Just watch me!” Just don’t resist.”

“Oh!” Xia ruofei said.

Why did these words sound so familiar? He was the one who had said that to Ling Qingxue before.

Who would have thought that it was Ling Qingxue’s turn to say this to Xia ruofei?

After Ling Qingxue had finished speaking, Xia ruofei felt a pulling force. It was not a strong force but he did not resist. The scene in front of him suddenly changed and he found himself in the huge square in front of the cloud Palace.

This was the place where he and Ling Qingxue had entered the heavenly cloud Palace.

“Awesome!” Xia ruofei could not help but give Ling Qingxue a thumbs up.

Ling Qingxue pursed her lips and smiled, then said,””Then I’ll take over the cloud heaven Palace!”

“That’s a must! What’s there to hesitate about?” Xia ruofei said.

“En!” Ling Qingxue nodded her head.

Then, without seeing what Ling Qingxue did, the entire heavenly cloud Palace shook slightly and then disappeared into thin air.

The entire seventh level of the Tower of Trials was left with an empty square.

Xia ruofei looked at the empty seventh level of the Tower of Trials and couldn’t help but laugh..””Qingxue, you’re the most ruthless one!”
