Translator: 5496903“President Xia, you’re really good at hiding!” The person in the lead laughed heartily.

Xia ruofei raised his head and looked over. He couldn’t help but be slightly shocked by this lineup. The person who had just spoken was short and had a “strange appearance”. It was the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the gold rush Group, Ma Yun, who was now firmly at the top of the Chinese internet industry. Don’t be fooled by the fact that this internet giant, who was called “father MA” by the netizens, was not tall in appearance or figure. However, his every move was very imposing.

The few people with Ma Yun were also successful people in the Internet industry. Among them were the few who had attended the release conference of Tao Yuan company’s Jade skin cream, like Liu Dong of jingbei group, Cheng Hao of Jumei shopping mall, and so on.

In addition to these few, there was also a legendary giant in the Chinese internet industry, the famous Chairman of the Board of Directors of Penguin Group, MA Huayi. After so many years of development, Penguin Group was no longer limited to the field of instant communication. This giant company’s tentacles reached almost every corner of the Internet industry: Games, reading, e – commerce, group purchase, entertainment ...

All of these people added together could definitely top half of China’s Internet industry.

Especially the two MA bosses, their permanent offices were not in Beijing. The gold rush group’s headquarters was in Qiantang city, the capital of Jiangsu and Zhejiang Province, while the Penguin Group’s headquarters was located in Shenzhen, a special district in Guangdong Province.

“Er MA” had actually flown in from outside to attend the opening ceremony of a club. If this news were to spread, it would definitely cause a lot of gossip.

“It’s Boss Ma!” Xia ruofei smiled and went up to him.”Welcome! Welcome!”

Then, he immediately greeted the other internet bosses.

“Boss Liu! We meet again, welcome!”

“General manager Cheng, you’re getting more and more handsome. Are you preparing to switch to the entertainment industry? Hahaha!”

“Boss Guo! You’re still as elegant as ever, old man!”

……

Finally, Xia ruofei walked to MA huasu and said with a smile,””Brother MA! I’ve long heard of your great name, and I’ve finally met you today!”

Ma Yun and MA Huayi, both Boss Ma, were here today. In order to distinguish between the two, Xia ruofei used the nickname ‘little brother MA’ from the netizens. This way, he would not neglect MA Huayi, and it would be easy to distinguish him.

MA huasu still had the image of a modest gentleman. In an era where people in the internet used jeans and T – shirts as the standard, he always appeared in public in a suit and tie.

Of course, everyone was dressed in formal attire today, so MA Huatong was not too conspicuous.

MA Huachen showed a strange smile and said,””President Xia, you can call me pony!”

Pony was MA Huayi’s English name. In fact,”pony” meant “little ma” in English.

“Okay, brother MA!” Xia ruofei said with a serious face.

At the side, Ma Yun couldn’t help but burst out laughing,”President Xia, well done! Hua Yan is too tsundere sometimes. This is an illness that needs to be treated!”

Liu Dong and the others also revealed knowing smiles.

Xia ruofei had a strange feeling when he saw this.

It was common for these internet bigwigs to bicker with each other on the internet. In the eyes of many people, these people would have a real – life PK after meeting each other. The kind that wouldn’t stop until his brain was smashed. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

In reality, they were like old friends.

As the big bosses of the same industry, the competition between them was naturally very fierce. However, these people were all super – rich people with assets in the hundreds of millions, and most of them were well – educated, so they were quite gentlemanly.

Besides, business competition was normal, and it didn’t affect their personal relationship.

“Everyone, thank you for your support!” Xia ruofei smiled.”Let’s sit here and chat!”

At this moment, Ling Qingxue whispered into Xia ruofei’s ear,””Ruofei, I’m going to walk around with Weiwei and Yiyi. You guys can talk!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”okay, I’ll go over to you guys in a bit!”

Since Ling Qingxue and the rest did not want to join in the fun, Xia ruofei would not force them.

Ling Qingxue and the rest nodded at Ma Yun and the rest, then left with their wine glasses.

Xia ruofei invited everyone to sit together and smiled.”I didn’t expect all the big bosses of the Internet industry to come here today. They’ve added quite a bit of glory to our paradise gathering!”

“We must support President Xia’s business!” Liu Dong said with a smile. He still had a strong Northern Jiangsu accent, but it was this accent that made people feel simple and kind.

The last time the Yushi cream’s product launch was held in Beijing, Xia ruofei had asked song Rui to help arrange this matter. At that time, song Rui had contacted Liu Dong through his good friend Zheng bang in the industry. Thus, jingbei group had pulled several buses of employees to support the product launch. Liu Dong and the others had even supported the Yushi cream at the product launch and announced on the spot that they would open sales channels on the five major e – commerce platforms at the same time.

The reason Liu Dong had attended that event in person was mainly because of Zheng bang’s reputation. Zheng bang’s family had been living in the capital for a long time, and Zheng bang even held a small portion of jingbei group’s shares.

However, since then, Xia ruofei and Liu Dong had been in contact on WeChat and they got along quite well.

Hence, Xia ruofei was the most familiar with Liu Dong and had the best relationship with him among all the people present.

As for Ma Yun, MA Huayi, and the others, other than a coincidence, it was also because of the Paradise Club’s strong background. On the other hand, it was also related to Xia ruofei, or rather, the Paradise Corporation.

Not counting the ordinary products such as Iron Skin fengdou and Taoyuan Da Hong Pao, just the explosive sales of the Jade skin cream alone had already made Xia ruofei famous in the industry.

Although the scale of the Paradise corporation’s assets could not be compared to any of the people present today, these were all big bosses in the Internet industry. Their eyes were absolutely sharp, and they could all see the terrifying potential of the Paradise Corporation.

Even if the Paradise Corporation didn’t have more new products in the future, just relying on the Jade skin cream and heart nourishing soup would be enough to let the Paradise Corporation snowball and grow in a short period of time.

Everyone had come together to get to know Xia ruofei, who had single – handedly founded paradise Corporation. In addition, in the past few years, many people had been spreading their net to make investment arrangements. The few with the ability, such as Ma Yun, MA hualiu, and even Liu Dong, all wanted to try their luck and see if they could invest in the Paradise Corporation.

Ma Yun leaned back on the soft sofa and said with a smile,””President Xia, we’re all attending an Internet Summit in Beijing. When President Liu said that the Paradise gathering would be holding its opening ceremony today, we all wanted to get to know you, a young internet celebrity entrepreneur, so we came uninvited.”
