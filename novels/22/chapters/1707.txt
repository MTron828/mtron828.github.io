Chapter 1708: Amazing as a celestial being (2)

“I told you to take it, so just take it!” Xia ruofei said,”it might be precious to you, but as you can see, if you want this kind of array, I can draw it at any time!”

Then, Xia ruofei smiled at Tang Haoran and said,””Haoran, show your jade pendant to your adopted husband!”

“Yes, master!” Tang Haoran took out the Jade Leaf from his clothes obediently. It was the gift that Xia ruofei had given him last time.

“See that? A spirit gathering array!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Haoran has one too!”

Of course, Li Yifu really wanted it, but after a fierce struggle in his mind, he still said,””Martial granduncle, perhaps this is something that you can obtain at any time, but this spirit gathering array is extremely precious even in the cultivation world! I really can’t accept disciples!”

Xia ruofei was shocked. Had the world of self – cultivators on earth declined to such an extent? Was this elementary spirit gathering array really as precious as Li Yifu had said? Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

However, he was only stunned for a moment before he said with a straight face,””Since you call me martial granduncle, then you have to listen to me! Foster husband, you’re not thinking of deceiving your master and exterminating your ancestor, are you?”

Tang Yitian and Xu Ziyuan wanted to laugh, but they didn’t dare to. A young man in his 20s was teaching a 90 – year – old disciple a lesson in a serious manner, and the other party had to listen respectfully. It was a delightful scene.

“Your disciple wouldn’t dare!” Li Yifu replied fearfully.

“Then keep it!” Xia ruofei said,”isn’t there a saying that goes,’don’t dare to refuse a gift from an elder’? Haoran is your martial uncle. How can you refuse the meeting gift he gave you?”

Li Yifu gritted his teeth and bowed to Tang Haoran, saying,””Thank you for the reward, uncle – Master!”

“Li ... That ... That’s what master gave you ...” Tang Haoran quickly waved his hand.

Xia ruofei chuckled as he stuffed the Jade statue of the gatekeeper into Li Yifu’s hands and said,”This is right!”

Li Yifu carefully put away the Jade carving.

“Since you’re calling me grand uncle – Master, I’ll have to prepare a gift for you ...” Xia ruofei continued.

“Grand uncle – Master, this spirit – gathering Jade sculpture is precious enough. I really don’t dare to take any more of your rewards ...” Li Yifu said hurriedly.

Before Li Jiu Zhou passed away, he had repeatedly reminded him that if he met Grandmaster Shan He’s direct descendant, he had to treat him with the sect leader’s etiquette. He had finally found his sect’s descendant after much difficulty, and it was even the personal disciple of Grandmaster Shan He, yet he had not even expressed anything! Li Yifu was terrified just by thinking about how he had received such a precious gift.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I don’t have anything good. My gift for our first meeting ... Why don’t I tell you about the Enlightenment of cultivation?” Let’s corroborate with each other!”

Li Yifu wanted to refuse, but when he heard that Xia ruofei wanted to teach him cultivation insights, he couldn’t bring himself to refuse.

He had been stuck at Qi disciple Level 3 for decades. In addition to the increasingly barren natural spiritual energy on earth, the incompleteness of his cultivation techniques was also a very serious problem. In addition, the number of cultivators on earth was decreasing day by day, and they would usually keep their occasional exchanges to themselves, so there was no such opportunity at all.

With Xia ruofei’s cultivation, he could benefit a lot from just a few words of advice.

How could he miss such a rare opportunity?

In the end, Li Yifu blushed and said,””Then ... Then many thanks, martial granduncle!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”alright!” Let’s go eat first! We’ll talk after dinner!”

In fact, Xia ruofei still had many good things. Not to mention anything else, just any spiritual crystal was many times more precious than the spirit gathering array.

Besides, Xia ruofei still had the complete Guiyuan Scripture in his mind!

However, this was the first time he had met Li Yifu. Besides, he did not know Li Yifu’s character. Even if Li Yifu was his Grand – disciple and they had the same master, he did not know Li Yifu well. If he gave these precious things to Li Yifu and caused trouble to society, Xia ruofei would be in deep trouble.

Hence, Xia ruofei felt that it was better to observe first before deciding if he should teach Li Yifu the complete Guiyuan Scripture.

“Yes!” Li Yifu said,”senior granduncle, please!”

Xia ruofei did not decline and walked over first. Li Yifu then respectfully asked Tang Haoran to go first.

Fortunately, they had already agreed to go their separate ways from Tang Yitian. Otherwise, Li Yifu would have no generation, and even Tang Yitian would be his grandfather’s generation!

Xia ruofei and Tang Haoran took the lead, with Li Yifu following behind respectfully. Xu Ziyuan and Tang Yitian were the last to follow.

When they returned to the villa from the back garden, Jennifer and Feng Jing had already returned to the living room. When they saw the group of people coming in, Jennifer immediately said,””Everyone, come over and eat! Dinner’s ready ...”

If it was in the past, Li Yifu would definitely be sitting in the main guest’s seat. He was the first honored guest!

However, the situation was completely different now. Li Yifu said respectfully,””Martial granduncle, please take a seat!”

Xia ruofei and Tang Yitian looked at each other, not knowing whether to laugh or cry. They could only helplessly sit in the seat that should have belonged to Li Yifu.

Feng Rao and Jennifer were even more stunned, completely unable to figure out what was going on.

How did Xia ruofei become Li Yifu’s senior granduncle after a trip to the back garden?
