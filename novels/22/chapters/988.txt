Song Qiming’s expression turned cold.”Then, can you explain why you’re here? you’re the Vice – Principal of an elementary school. Why are you here?” Could it be that the scope of joint law enforcement has been expanded to include primary schools?”

“Secretary song, I ... I ...” Tian Mingyi’s face was full of tears. He didn’t know how to explain.

In fact, he couldn’t explain it. They were not in the right at all.

Song Qiming looked at Tian Mingyi in disgust. He was no longer interested in talking to such a small fry.

He said directly to Guangzhi Cao,”little Cao!” Call the leaders of the other units and tell them to come to me to get their people!”

“Yes!” Guangzhi Cao said immediately.

Tian Mingyi, inspector Wu, and the others almost fell to the ground when they heard this. They knew that their political lives had completely come to an end, and for someone like Tian Mingyi, it was very likely that even his father would be implicated.

To ordinary restaurant owners, a Vice Director of the health Bureau like Tian Feilong was a God that they could never offend. However, for song Qiming, who was a Secretary of the municipal government, he could deal with Tian Feilong with just a few words.

Song Qiming then turned to Ling Xiaotian and said in a friendly manner,””Chairman Ling, please find a room and send a few security guards to keep an eye on these people.”

Ling Xiaotian immediately replied,”alright!” Anyway, they’ve chased away all the guests tonight, so there are still many empty rooms ...”

Song Qiming said apologetically,””Chairman Ling, I will definitely get justice for what happened today!”

“Thank you, Secretary song!” Ling Xiaotian said sincerely. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Song Qiming smiled and nodded. He turned to Guangzhi Cao and said,”After they arrive, tell them to claim the people from their respective units and wait in the private room!”

“Okay, Secretary song!” Guangzhi Cao quickly said.

At this moment, Xia ruofei, who had been watching from the side, smiled and said,””Secretary song, let’s go to the private room!”

“That’s right! RUO Fei, Qingxue, please take good care of Secretary song’s family. I’d like to personally cook a few dishes for Secretary song to express my gratitude!” Ling Xiaotian chimed in.

Song Qiming laughed and said,”it’s rare for a rich man like Chairman Ling to cook personally!” It seems like I’m in for a treat today!”

“It’s our honor to have Secretary song visiting our restaurant,”Ling Xiaotian quickly replied.”What’s the big deal about me cooking a few dishes?” Secretary song, please!”

Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue led the way, and they soon arrived at flying Snow Pavilion.

Song Qiming also praised the elegant and quiet environment of flying Snow Pavilion. After everyone sat down in the private room, Ling Qingxue immediately sat down beside the coffee table and personally made tea for everyone.

Xia ruofei knew what song Qiming and his family were thinking. He did not want them to eat with a heavy heart. Hence, he smiled and said,””Uncle song, aunty Fang, since there’s still some time, let me do a checkup for Song Wei first! Once the treatment plan for the next stage is settled, you can all eat in peace!”

Xia ruofei still addressed song Qiming as “Secretary song” in front of outsiders. However, since everyone in the room was his own people, Xia ruofei followed song Qiming’s request and addressed him as “uncle song”.

Xia ruofei had briefly told Ling Qingxue about the situation, including Song Wei’s illness, so she was not too surprised. She continued to concentrate on making tea. The tea leaves she used were the top – grade Da Hong Pao that Xia ruofei had given to Ling Xiaotian.

Song Qiming and Fang Liyun were overjoyed.””Then I’ll have to trouble you, ruofei!”

Xia ruofei smiled at Song Wei and said,”Come on! I’ll take your pulse first!”

Song Wei smiled and sat down on the chair beside Xia ruofei. She reached out her white arm and placed it on the armrest.

After Xia ruofei had absorbed the Chinese medicine knowledge from the human – shaped jade talisman, his medical skills were on a completely different level from when he treated Song Wei. He reached out his fingers and placed them on Song Wei’s pulse. His actions were like that of a master.

Xia ruofei’s eyes were closed and his expression was calm as usual.

After a long while, he opened his eyes with a smile ...
