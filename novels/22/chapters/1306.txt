Chapter 1307: Someone from the headquarters (2)

Translator: 549690339

......

Chen shun, the purchasing manager of the Tongren Tang chain headquarters, was in a bad mood.

At noon, Vice President Lin of the East China District called the Vice President of the chain store in the East China District to report that there was a batch of high – Quality Cordyceps sinensis to be purchased and he wanted to apply for permission.

This Vice President was Chen shun’s second uncle, Chen Weinan. He had a deep impression of this Vice President Lin from the East China region. He was originally just a store manager, but he was lucky enough to continuously purchase very old wild ginseng. Later, he opened up his own channels and could purchase high – Quality iron – skinned maple leaves for Tongren Hall every month. This was why he was discovered by the chain headquarters ‘leader and was promoted smoothly.

When Chen Weinan heard that this Vice President Lin had found the best quality aweto, which was more valuable and had better sales, he was slightly moved and asked about the source.

Just as he had guessed, it was still from the Paradise Corporation in San Shan.

Chen Weinan immediately had an idea. This was a performance that would make people jealous! His nephew, Chen shun, had been in the position of purchasing manager for a long time. This time, the position of the Vice President of the purchasing department was vacant, and there were six or seven managers of the purchasing department who met the promotion conditions. If Chen shun could get such a big order, with the help of Zhang Zian, Chen shun’s promotion would be reasonable.

Therefore, Chen Weinan immediately called a halt to the transaction. He said that with such a large purchase and such a large transaction amount, the chain headquarters needed to send someone to preside over the purchase in the name of the chain headquarters. Then, the batch of goods would be distributed to the various regions. In other words, they could not let the East China region eat all the food.

Just like that, Chen shun was urgently dispatched to the three mountains.

Before leaving, Chen Weinan had specifically given Chen shun face – to – Face instructions and emphasized the importance of this purchase many times.

This was because his nephew was really not presentable. His ability level was average, but he was good at eating, drinking, and playing. If it were not for his protection, he might not even be an ordinary purchasing Commissioner, let alone a purchasing manager. He might even be kicked out of the company after a few days.

Chen shun was also overjoyed after hearing this, as if he could see the Vice President of the procurement department waving at him.

He didn’t understand those profound questions, and he didn’t want to understand them. Anyway, he just remembered his uncle’s words and tried his best to get this big order!

With such a sense of urgency, Chen shun boarded the flight to Sanshan city with an experienced purchasing Specialist.

When the plane landed on San Shan, it was already past four in the afternoon. He hailed a cab at the airport and headed straight for Tao Yuan farm.

He didn’t expect that when he came to the farm, a female assistant in her 20s would receive him. After a few phone calls, she told him that the chairman of paradise company had gone out and couldn’t talk today.

He originally thought that even if the deal didn’t go through today, the Paradise company would at least arrange for accommodation and food, right?

Unexpectedly, after she finished speaking, the female assistant shut her mouth and did not mention this matter again.

Chen shun was extremely depressed. He felt that this paradise company didn’t know how to treat their guests. He was here to buy the company. He was the God of Fortune! Even if he didn’t treat him as a guest, he still needed basic protection, right?

However, since the other party was feigning ignorance, Chen shun, as a man of the capital, could not shamelessly take the initiative to mention it. He could only leave the farm with his people gloomily.

When he arrived at the farm’s entrance, Chen shun realized that something was wrong.

The farm was located on the outskirts, and it took a long time to walk from the entrance of the farm to the National Highway, and it was difficult to get a taxi on the National Highway.

Seeing the sky getting darker and darker, Chen shun’s mood was also extremely bad.

He pulled out his phone with a dark face, found President Lin’s number, and dialed.

The phone rang a few times before President Lin picked it up. He said indifferently,””Manager Chen, do you have any instructions?”

“Vice President Lin, we’re at the entrance of Tao Yuan farm right now. We can’t get a taxi to the city right now, so can you get someone to call a taxi to pick us up?” Chen shun said in a commanding tone.

President Lin could hear Chen shun’s resentment, but he almost laughed out loud.

It seemed that manager Chen from Beijing had already been to Tao Yuan farm, but he had been refused.

Brother Xia is really a good friend! President Lin said in his heart.

President Lin controlled his emotions and said coldly,””Manager Chen, I’m sorry, we don’t live in the city ...”

“Where are you staying?” Chen shun asked.

President Lin said in a matter – of – fact tone,””Of course I’m staying at Taoyuan farm!”

“You ...” Chen shun didn’t expect boss Lin to be at Peach Blossom Farm.

He said hatefully in his heart, this is preposterous! The few of them treated me with good food and drinks, but I didn’t even have a cup of hot tea when I came over! It’s getting dark, and they’re not even arranging accommodation!

“Is there anything else, manager Chen? If there’s nothing else, I’ll hang up first. Director Xia is looking for me for dinner!” President Lin said.

Then, without waiting for Chen shun to speak, he hung up the phone.

Chen shun was so angry that he almost threw his phone away. The purchasing Commissioner who came with him stood to the side, trembling in fear, not daring to touch his bad luck.

“What are you waiting for?” Chen shun said unhappily. Let’s walk out and stop a taxi on the National Highway!”

After that, he strode forward, and the purchasing Commissioner could only drag their suitcases and quickly follow.

The two of them walked for a long time, and only came to the National Highway when it was completely dark.

Then, they stopped a taxi for a full half an hour in the cold wind before they were lucky enough to find an empty taxi returning to the city. They then got on the car and returned to the city.

After getting a room in San Shan city, Chen shun’s resentment had not dissipated. He decided that when they discussed the specific terms of the acquisition tomorrow, he would make a good decision on this paradise company.

If the Tiger doesn’t show its might, do you think I’m a sick cat? Chen shun said in his heart.

At this time, he had already forgotten his uncle Chen Weinan’s advice.

......

The next morning, after a few twists and turns, Chen shun finally met the chairman of the peach blossom company, Xia ruofei. At the same time, he also saw CEO Lin and the others.

Chen shun didn’t give President Lin a good look, and President Lin didn’t want to pretend to be polite with this person who was obviously here to pick up the peach, so the air in the meeting room seemed to have a trace of gunpowder.

It was not until the late Xia ruofei entered the meeting room that the frozen air seemed to start flowing again.

Feng Jing had felt the atmosphere in the meeting room was very depressing. When Xia ruofei entered, she quickly introduced him,””Chairman, this is manager Chen shun from the purchasing chain of Tongren Tang. Manager Chen, this is our Chairman, Mr. Xia ruofei. ”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,””Hello, manager Chen.”

Chen shun nodded at Xia ruofei with a fake smile, then said,””President Xia, I’m here on behalf of the Tongren Tang chain to discuss the acquisition of aweto. According to Vice President Lin’s report from the East China region, your company has a batch of wormgrass that has a good color. We are quite interested in high – end Chinese medicinal herbs, but before we talk about the purchase, I would like to check the goods first. ”

Xia ruofei sat down and frowned.””Director Lin has already brought a professional appraiser to inspect this batch of worm grass yesterday.”

“Vice President Lin has seen it, but I haven ‘t!” Chen shun said,”our Tongren Tang chain has a very strict set of procedures for such a large amount of money involved in the acquisition. I hope you can understand.”

Xia ruofei thought for a moment and nodded.””Alright then!”

Although Chen shun looked like he was asking for a beating, Xia ruofei still wanted to cash out this batch of wormgrass as soon as possible. Since he wanted to see it, he would let him. It would not waste much time anyway.

Xia ruofei beckoned to Liu Qian, who quickly put down her pen and walked over. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Xia ruofei took out his office key and handed it to Liu Qian.”Go to the administrative office and find a few young and strong guys to carry the three large boxes behind my desk over. Tell them to be careful and not to bump into them.”

“Yes!” Liu Qian said, then took the key and left quickly.

In a short while, three boxes of aweto were carried into the meeting room.
