After Xia ruofei finished, he immediately added,””Of course, this is just a precaution. As long as the conditions allow it, I’ll definitely be by your side to protect you when you break through. I’m just afraid that I won’t be able to leave because of other things. You’ve mastered the next stage of the cultivation method in advance, as well as some precautions for the breakthrough, so there won’t be any problems even if you break through alone!”

“Alright!” Song Qiming nodded. However, I’m getting on in years, and I’m afraid that my comprehension and memory aren’t that good. I’m afraid ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”didn’t it go smoothly when you were learning the body – nourishing technique?” Don’t worry! Although the “modest Heart Sutra” is different at each stage of the Qi refining stage, it’s still only at the Qi refining stage. There’s nothing difficult to understand, and it’s relatively easy for you to learn it!”

Song Qiming chuckled and said,”I didn’t know that the health – Maintenance method was such a powerful thing!” The ignorant are fearless! I’m really feeling a little guilty now!”

“Uncle song, you’ll know after you learn it. It’s not as difficult as you think!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Alright! Then I’ll do my best!”

“En!”

After that, Xia ruofei started to write down the Level 4 cultivation technique of the “if void Heart Sutra” and explained it to song Qiming word by word.

At the same time, he drew a Meridian circulation diagram for this stage and patiently explained every Meridian and acupoint to song Qiming.

After all, song Qiming had experience in cultivation. Especially after he had broken through several levels in a row today, he had a good grasp of the third level of the Qi refining stage. Therefore, it was not that difficult for him to understand it. Very soon, he had mastered the entire stage of the technique and had also firmly remembered the meridian circulation diagram.

After teaching song Qiming the Level 4 Qi refining technique, the two of them left the study room.

It had been more than an hour since song Qiming consumed the wild tea, his breakthrough, and their long conversation. Besides, it was getting late. Under normal circumstances, Xia ruofei should have left and returned home.

The two of them went to the living room.

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue were making tea and chatting with Fang Liyun. The tea they were drinking was the pot of wild tea. The tea leaves were quite durable, and the fragrance didn’t diminish even after being brewed a few times.

Song Qiming noticed that Fang Liyun did not seem to be acting out of place after drinking the wild tea. If there was anything different about her, it would be that she seemed to be in better spirits. Fang Liyun was almost done with her shower and was about to rest, but she seemed to be in the mood to chat and did not seem to be sleepy at all.

Song Qiming could not help but secretly heave a sigh of relief.

“Qingxue, it’s time to go home!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Let’s sit a little longer!” Fang Liyun smiled and said,”it’s rare for us to have such a happy chat!”

“Aunty, it’s getting late. We should go back ...” Xia ruofei said with a smile.”I should be at the three mountains for the next few days. I’ll come and visit you when I have time!”

Ling Qingxue and Song Wei were relieved to see song Qiming come out in high spirits.

Ling Qingxue stood up.”Uncle song, aunty Fang, RUO Fei and I will take our leave. You guys should rest early too!”

“Alright then!” Fang Liyun said,”ruofei, if you’re at the three mountains, come over often. Don’t talk about it!”

“Don’t worry! Aunt Fang’s cooking is so good, I definitely can’t help but want to come over and freeload a meal!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Fang Liyun was very pleased and said with a smile, “You’re such a sweet – tongued child!”

After Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue greeted everyone, they walked towards the door.

“I’ll send you guys off!”Song Wei said quickly. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Then, she followed him out.

Song Qiming looked at his daughter with a complicated expression, but he did not say anything.

However, only he knew his true thoughts.

After all, song Qiming had found out about the world of cultivation all of a sudden. He even knew that his daughter’s cultivation level was higher than his own. The fact that he could remain so calm showed that song Qiming’s mental fortitude was pretty good.

Song Wei followed Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue out of the building and into the courtyard. She asked impatiently,””RUO Fei, how is it?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”refined Qi Level 3!” And I’ve already touched the bottleneck of refined Qi Level 4, and a breakthrough is just a matter of time!”

“That’s great!” Song Wei cheered at first, then she immediately looked back carefully and asked in a low voice,”then, about cultivation ...”

Xia ruofei knew what song Wei was concerned about. He smiled and said, “I’ve already told uncle song some things about the world of cultivation. He now knows that he’s not cultivating the health maintenance method that the old men and women in the park use every day. In addition ...”

At this point, Xia ruofei paused for a moment. Then, he looked at Song Wei and smiled.”He also knows that his precious daughter has already reached refined Qi Level 5, which is even higher than his cultivation.”

“Ah?” “Ah!” Song Wei couldn’t help but exclaim and immediately covered her mouth.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”uncle song is not a fool. He could tell that you were making wild tea today.” However, that’s all the information I’ve revealed. I didn’t tell you anything else, including our relationship and the matter of Paradise Island. “
