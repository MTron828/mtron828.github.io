Translator: 549690339

Ling Qingxue and Cheng Xiaoxiao were at a loss. After all this talk, this manager Bastian was not a fan of Xia ruofei! She was so excited just now, and she was even more of a fan than a fan!

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”so Mr. Bastian used to be our customer!” I really have to thank you for taking care of our business ...”

Bastian quickly said,”I don’t deserve it!” I don’t dare! I was just following the boss to see the world. That auction really opened our eyes, and our corner Western restaurant also won a piece of top quality black truffle! When we were tasting the dishes, I’ll never forget the taste ...” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Mr. Bastian, you flatter me!” Xia ruofei said with a warm smile.

In fact, some white executives who worked in China more or less had a kind of superior mentality, especially in front of local employees.

However, in front of Xia ruofei, Bastian was not arrogant at all. On the contrary, he was very humble because the gap between the two was too big.

Bastian had seen with his own eyes that Xia ruofei was having fun with the Super – rich in Hong Kong. He had made a net profit of 10 to 20 million dollars from an auction, while the Western restaurant around the corner could only pick up a few truffles that the rich people were not interested in. They were not on the same level as Xia ruofei.

Bastian asked enthusiastically,”Mr. Xia, our boss still can’t forget it. He said when your company would auction truffles again!” The truffle harvest season is almost over ...”

Xia ruofei was taken aback. It was spring all year round in the spirit map space, so he was not particularly sensitive to the harvest time. Truffles were stored in the space after they were dug out. They would not go bad anyway, so in theory, he could take them out for auction at any time.

However, truffles ‘harvest season was only a few months from the end of the year to the beginning of the year, and they could only be stored for a very short time. Therefore, if truffles were taken out at other times, it would definitely cause a huge uproar, because it was already against the rules of nature.

After the truffle auction with Hengfeng at the end of last year, he had been busy until now. The truffle season was about to end, but he had not organized a second auction yet.

Xia ruofei still had a lot of top – grade truffles in his storage space. He felt that he could take advantage of this harvest season to hold another auction. Otherwise, he would have to wait until November or December to make money again.

Furthermore, Xia ruofei suddenly had a better idea. This auction could not only sell truffles but also some high – end products of the Paradise Corporation.

Just imagine, if pieces of super – Large top – grade truffles, top – grade one – headed abalones, top – grade old mountain ginseng, top – grade wormgrass, top – grade iron – Skin dendrobes appeared in the auction, how shocking would that be?

Moreover, all of these products would be branded with the Paradise corporation’s trademark without exception. It was conceivable that the Paradise Corporation would happily reap another wave of fame.

Thinking of this, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but have the urge to immediately make arrangements.

He smiled and said to Bastian,””We’re planning to hold an auction soon, and the scale is expected to be much bigger than the auction at the end of last year. The items for auction might not be limited to only the best truffles. Some of our company’s high – end ingredients and herbs, such as abalone, ginseng, Cordyceps, and so on, will also appear in the auction!”

Bastian was very excited to hear this and said,””God! This was wonderful news! Mr. Xia, I think our boss Mr. Boris would be overjoyed if he knew about this!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”You can tell him the good news. However, we haven’t announced the details of the auction yet. I hope that this information won’t be leaked out before that!”

Bastian immediately made a solemn vow. “Don’t worry! Mr. Xia, I promise that our Western restaurant will keep this secret for you!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. Then, he glanced at Cheng Xiaoxiao and asked,””Mr. Bastian, I want to take a photo with miss Cheng Xiaoxiao. This ... Won’t affect your work, right?”

“Of course I won ‘t!” Bastian did not hesitate to say,”I think Cheng must feel very honored!”

In fact, Bastian was very clear that Cheng Xiaoxiao had violated the work rules just now and asked Xia ruofei for an autograph and a photo. However, Xia ruofei had already made it clear that he wanted to protect this fellow fan of his. Unless Bastian’s head was kicked by a donkey, he would definitely not come out at this time to sing a different tune.

As for punishing Cheng Xiaoxiao, that was even more impossible.

Cheng Xiaoxiao was both surprised and happy. She had thought that she would not be able to escape today, but she did not expect things to turn around. Xia ruofei had even personally exonerated her, which made her even more moved to tears. As a fan, she felt that she was really lucky to meet such an idol.

Xia ruofei and Cheng Xiaoxiao had finished taking a photo together. Ling Qingxue had taken the photo for the two of them and had even specially taken a few more photos.

After the group photo was taken, Bastian immediately said,”Mr. Xia, and this beautiful lady, I won’t disturb your meal anymore! I hope the restaurant will give you a good memory!”
