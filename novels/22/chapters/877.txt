Chapter 878: Chapter 561 – enemies on a narrow road 2

Translator: 549690339

When President Zheng heard this, he was even more furious. So this time, he was like a pig looking into the mirror and looking at himself in disdain! There was really no way to do this job ...

Xia ruofei had a faint smile on his face as he looked on coldly. He didn’t care much about this arrogant “young master yang.” No matter how impressive Yingluo was, could she be more impressive than song Rui? There aren’t many rich kids like song Rui in all of China, right? Didn’t he still call him brother and scold him whenever he was unhappy?

However, when his eyes fell on the person behind yang Jianren, his eyes couldn’t help but narrow slightly, and the curve of his mouth became even wider.

The man saw Xia ruofei the moment he entered the private room. He stared at Xia ruofei with a pair of dark eyes and a sneer on his face.

Enemies really meet on a narrow road! Xia ruofei laughed in his heart.

The man’s name was he Dong. He used to be a Sales Manager at Ling Xiaotian’s company. He was also the son of Ling Xiaotian’s comrade. At that time, Ling Xiaotian had even tried to matchmake him and Ling Qingxue.

He was also Ling Qingxue’s fanatical admirer. Back then, when Ling Qingxue had discovered the unique taste and beautiful appearance of Peach Garden vegetables, she had decided to collaborate with Peach Garden Farm to launch Peach Garden vegetables at Ling’s restaurant. It was he Dong who had created trouble and deliberately made things difficult for Xia ruofei.

Later on, when Ling Xiaotian realized that paradise vegetables was a huge help to Ling Ji restaurant out of its predicament and took the initiative to ask for cooperation, Xia ruofei’s condition was to fire the sales manager he Dong, who did not distinguish between public and private affairs and worked for private purposes.

At that time, Ling Xiaotian had even gone through an intense mental struggle. After all, he Dong was the child of his old comrade and former class monitor.

In the end, Ling Xiaotian still made the right decision to kick he Dong out of the company.

Xia ruofei had thought that he Dong was just a passer – by in his life and that they would never meet again. In fact, he didn’t even care about such a small character.

What he didn’t expect was that after more than a year, he would actually meet he Dong again under such circumstances.

Yang Jianren didn’t wait for President Zheng to speak. He said loudly,””Mayor he, I have a very important guest to entertain this afternoon and would like to use this moonlight lotus pond private room. I see that you only have two people here, why don’t you ... Change to another room?”

Yang Jianren’s words were as if they were natural, and he Feng was a little unhappy after hearing them.

However, he Feng still suppressed this trace of unhappiness.

After all, yang Jianren’s father was his old leader.

Yang Jianren’s father was yang Jinsheng, the current Deputy Minister of the municipal organization Department. Although he was only at the chief level, he had a lot of power. More importantly, it was said that Deputy Minister yang was about to be promoted to Deputy Director, and it was very likely that he would directly enter the Standing Committee of the municipal Party Committee. Once he took this step, it would be a whole new world.

There was also a key point. Yang Jinsheng was promoted from the position of the Executive Deputy Mayor of the KL District to the municipal organization Department. He had worked in the yl District for more than ten years and had connections all over the district. When yang Jinsheng was the executive Vice District head, he Feng was only the director of the education Bureau. He Feng had a natural sense of respect for this old leader of the yl District.

If it were any other time, he Feng might not have cared so much about it because of yang Jianren’s background and would have just changed it.

However, he had invited Xia ruofei to dinner today and he could not consider the problem so simply.

In he Feng’s judgment, Xia ruofei was most likely a young master from a big family. What did a young master like him value the most? Of course it was face!

If he had not come to the Lotus pond Moonlight Box today, he would not have minded the slight difference in the grade of the box.

But the current situation was that they had been drinking tea and chatting here for a long time. Now yang Jianren had barged in and asked for this room. If she rashly agreed to young Master Yang’s request, where would she put the face of “young master Xia”?

Thinking of this, he Feng quickly glanced at Xia ruofei. He saw that Xia ruofei was still as steady as Mount Tai and had a faint smile on his face, so he was even more sure of his judgment. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

He secretly made up his mind and said with a smile,””Young master yang, I’m really sorry! I’m also entertaining a distinguished guest today, so I’m afraid I can’t agree to the change of room ...”

Yang Jianren couldn’t help but be stunned.

When he entered the room, he saw that the guest was Xia ruofei, who was sitting next to he Fengshi. He completely ignored Wanwan and thought that changing rooms was just a matter of words.

He could still vividly remember the time when his father was the executive Vice District head of the yl District. The Director of Education, he Feng, had come to his house to pay a New Year visit with a respectful attitude.

Now that his father’s status was even higher, and he was going to advance further soon, his influence was even higher. How could he Feng not give him face?

What yang Jianren didn’t expect was that he Feng really didn’t give him any face.

Yang Jianren’s face suddenly darkened, and he said gloomily,””Deputy Mayor he, aren’t you going to give me this little bit of face?”

“Young master yang, it’s not that I don’t want to give you face, but it’s really not convenient for me to come here today ...” He Feng said with a smile.

Yang Jianren’s face turned cold. Before he could speak, he Dong, who was behind him, suddenly stepped forward and whispered a few words in his ear.

Yang Jianren’s expression changed a few times as he listened.
