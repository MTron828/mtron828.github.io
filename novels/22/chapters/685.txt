Chapter 686: Obtaining the world stone (1)

Once Zhao Cheng got home, he rushed upstairs to look for Xia ruofei.

He grabbed Xia ruofei’s hand and shook it agitatedly as he said,””Doctor Xia, I’m really grateful to you this time!”

“General Zhao, are the results out?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

“He’s out! It’s out!” Zhao Cheng said,”his condition has improved greatly. There’s no need to inject insulin at the moment. He’ll be fine as long as he takes medicine to control it!”

“There’s hope for a complete recovery after a few more treatments,”Xia ruofei said indifferently.

“Yes, yes, yes. I believe you, Dr. Xia!” Zhao Cheng said happily,”I really have to thank you this time! Doctor Xia, tell me! What do you want? As long as it’s not too precious, I have a way to get it for you. ”

Xia ruofei smiled and shook his head.”General Zhao, I’m only here to treat you because someone asked me to. I’ve never thought of asking for anything in return.”

“I know that, but you’ve done me such a big favor. It’d be outrageous if I didn’t show any gratitude!” Zhao Cheng said,”I know that you’re not short of money, Dr. Xia. Otherwise, I would have given you the money directly!”

“General Zhao, let’s not talk about this for now,” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Xia ruofei then picked up his simple luggage and said,””Your treatment here has come to an end, but I still have a lot of things to deal with at my company! That’s why I should be leaving. ”

“You’re leaving already?” Zhao Cheng was a little surprised.”Doctor Xia, I ... I’m only halfway through my treatment!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I have a lot of things to do in my own company. I can’t stay with you for a long time. So, the follow – up treatment may be more troublesome. You need to send someone to my place to get the medicine regularly.” Or you can take a short break and live in Sanshan for treatment. You can return to work when you’ve fully recovered. ”

Zhao Cheng shook his head.”That won’t do, that won’t do. I’ve been on leave for quite a few days. If I don’t go back now, those bastards at the headquarters are going to turn the world upside down!”

......

In truth, Zhao Cheng was more concerned about the negative effects of his long disappearance. This would have a huge impact on the future development of a young and powerful general.

Therefore, it was definitely impossible to take a vacation and go to labor.

He could only use Xia ruofei’s method and send people to San Shan city to collect the medicine regularly.

This kind of brewed medicinal soup could only be preserved for three days at most, which meant that Zhao Cheng had to send people to the three mountains every three days, which was indeed quite troublesome.

However, for a Deputy region chief, this was not a problem.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”then send someone to collect the medicine regularly!” It will take about two to three months to completely cure the diabetes. ”

“No problem!” Zhao Cheng said,”I’ll send people to collect them regularly! But I’ll have to trouble you with the brewing of the medicine ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it’s nothing. A doctor has the heart of a parent!” Besides, I’ll help you to the end. Since I’ve promised elder song, I’ll naturally do my best. General Zhao, when your men arrive at the three mountains, just give me a call. ”

“Alright, alright.”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded at Jin Feng. He slung his backpack over his shoulder and went downstairs.

“Doctor Xia, I haven’t thanked you properly yet!” Zhao Cheng quickly caught up to him.

Xia ruofei stopped in his tracks and looked into Zhao Cheng’s eyes.”General Zhao, how do you want to thank me?” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“It’s too common to give money! Dr. Xia, is there anything you want? As long as you can think of it, I’ll do everything I can to get it for you!” Zhao Cheng said.

“The things in this villa will work too?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

“That’s great! I’m in and out of my room, you can take whatever you like!” “Even if you’re interested in my precious guns, I’ll give them to you without hesitation. I’ll even help you get all the documents!” Zhao Cheng said in a low voice.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”general Zhao is indeed very particular in handling matters!” I’ve already thought of what I want!”

“Oh? What do I have here that can catch your eye, doctor Xia?” Zhao Cheng asked curiously.

Xia ruofei said as he went downstairs,””General Zhao, no matter what I like, I can just take it away, right?”

“Yes, yes, yes! Please don’t stand on ceremony with me!”

“Then after I take it, we’re even! You don’t have to keep thanking me!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“A gift is just a way to express my gratitude. You’ve done me such a big favor. Nothing can replace my gratitude!” Zhao Cheng said.

Xia ruofei shook his head helplessly. By then, they had already reached the first floor.

“General Zhao, I’ll take it then!” Xia ruofei said.

“Take it directly! You’re welcome!” Zhao Cheng made a gesture of invitation.

Jin Feng was also very curious. He had thought that Xia ruofei would decline, and Zhao Cheng would prepare a gift for Xia ruofei according to his idea. Xia ruofei would then reluctantly accept it.

This should be the correct script, right?

He did not expect Xia ruofei to be someone who did not play by the rules. He really did pick a gift from Zhao Cheng’s house.

What would he take out?
