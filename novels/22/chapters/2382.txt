2383 Establishing might (2)

Xia ruofei said indifferently,”starting from my left, it’s the first to the fifth groups!” Bao Guijun, you are the leader of the first group. Qian guiyou, team two leader, Huang rujue, team three leader ...”

“Yes!”

“Yes!”

Bao Guijun and the others saw Xia ruofei rubbing Metatron casually and felt as if their inner demons had been removed. When Xia ruofei personally appointed them as the team leader, they all felt proud and elated. They walked out of the herb garden and stood in front of the group they were in charge of.

Bao Guijun also realized that Metatron, who had been giving him a fierce look, was in his group. He wondered if Xia ruofei had arranged it on purpose.

Anyway, Bao Guijun felt good. He didn’t have the fear from the bottom of his heart anymore. On the contrary, now that merendo had become an ordinary worker under him, he felt like a serf who had turned over and was singing. He even wanted to settle the scores with merendo in his usual work.

After Xia ruofei had divided the ingredients, he nodded to Xia Qing, indicating for him to continue.

Xia Qing bowed to Xia ruofei and then said loudly,””I hope that everyone will remember what master said just now! No matter what you used to do, you only have One Identity here, and that is to be a laborer! Whoever does something that is not in line with their status will be severely punished!”

Then, Xia Qing assigned a mobile temporary house to each group. Each mobile temporary building had two floors. These free laborers lived in two rooms on the upper floor. Each room had about 10 people, so over 100 people could be easily accommodated in five mobile temporary buildings.

There were still more than 20 mobile temporary houses left empty. Xia ruofei would continue to capture people into the medium in the future, and they would slowly come in handy.

Xia Qing also briefly announced the rules of the labor team. Of course, she didn’t mention any details. She just left it to Bao Guijun and the other team leaders to teach them.

After that, it was time to distribute the supplies. Everyone had a set of bedding, two sets of coarse clothes, a set of basic daily necessities, and a set of labor tools.

Some of the supplies were purchased by Xia ruofei before he left the country. They were all piled up in the empty mobile room. Some were collected from the training camp, such as bedding. These people had a set each in the dormitory of the training camp. Besides that, there were many spare supplies in the warehouse. Xia ruofei had kept them as spoils of war and continued to distribute them to them for use.

Bao Guijun and the others got into their roles quickly. Some of them were in charge of distributing clothes and registering the names, while others were maintaining order.

These people were mainly made up of the prospective mercenaries from the secret training camp in Basoko town. They were already under military management, and with Xia ruofei and Xia Qing’s deterrence, no one dared to cause trouble, and the scene was also very orderly.

Soon, everyone received their own supplies and stood in line again.

While distributing the supplies, Xia ruofei told Xia Qing some things, mainly about Personnel Management. For example, the labor team now had more than 100 people and would continue to expand in the future, so they had to establish a multi – level management system as soon as possible. It was also best to set up a canteen and select prisoners with experience in this area to be responsible for cooking.

Of course, the food given to these free laborers was certainly not big fish and meat. It was enough to ensure the energy needed for their daily survival, and they did not need particularly good cooking skills.

In addition, it was best to refer to military management for the management of so many people. For example, they would train in line every morning, take attendance at night to comment on the day’s work, and have an emergency gathering from time to time. These were all to train their awareness of obedience.

There was also an incentive system, such as a moving red flag. Every day, every week, and every month, the most active groups and individuals would be selected, and a certain number of points would be awarded. He believed that once the captives understood the role of points, this system would play a great role.

This was what Xia ruofei had experienced every day during his military service, so he could handle this kind of management with ease.

Xia Qing had never doubted or hesitated about Xia ruofei’s words. He would firmly carry out whatever his master said, so he took Xia ruofei’s words very seriously and wrote them down.

By the time Xia ruofei finished giving his orders, Bao Guijun and the others had already finished distributing the supplies. After asking for Xia Qing’s permission, Bao Guijun and the others led their team members into the mobile temporary houses that were allocated to them and settled down.

The captives had all entered the mobile building, and Manzila, who was still lying on the ground, was quite conspicuous.

His arms and legs were broken, and he could not even move. Besides, Xia ruofei had not counted him in when dividing the groups. It was as if he had been forgotten.

It was only then that Xia ruofei brought Xia Qing down from the sky and walked to Manzila’s side.

Xia ruofei said to Xia Qing,”you’ll manage this person alone. First, treat his injuries. After he’s fully recovered, you can assign him some physical work that consumes more energy. This guy is a third Qi layer cultivator, and his spiritual power cultivation is higher.”

Xia ruofei naturally spoke to Xia Qing in Chinese, and Manzila also understood Chinese. He quickly said,”Manager Xia, don’t worry! I’m very strong, so you can tell me what to do ... But ... You have to wait until my injuries are better. ”

Xia Qing nodded indifferently and didn’t say anything.

Xia ruofei’s eyes were fixed on Manzila for half a minute. Manzila was a little scared by Xia ruofei’s gaze and could not help but lower her head, not daring to look at Xia ruofei.

At this moment, Xia ruofei said indifferently,””You secretly cultivated for 3 minutes and 36 seconds just now ...” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Ah?” Manzila looked at Xia ruofei in shock.

He had indeed been cultivating for a while, mainly because the spiritual energy here was too rich. He couldn’t hold it in. Moreover, his injuries were quite serious, and absorbing some spiritual energy would be beneficial to his recovery.

However, even Manzila himself did not know the exact time of the training. He only knew that it might be three to four minutes.

Manzila did not expect Xia ruofei to know exactly how long he had been cultivating for, even though he did not look at him.

Xia ruofei stared into Manzila’s eyes and said,””I’m the master of this space. It’s impossible to hide from me that the spiritual Qi here hasn’t increased or consumed a single bit. At the same time, I’m the owner of this place, and everything here is my personal property, including the spiritual energy of heaven and earth that fills this space. Do you understand?”

Manzila lowered his head in guilt and said in fear,””I understand. I didn’t know your rules just now. Please forgive me ...”

Xia ruofei replied indifferently,”of course I’ll forgive you. It’s your first time after all!” And I didn’t have time to emphasize it to you. I’m telling you now, if I find you again, I’ll throw you into a cage and feed you to the bees! Don’t try to get lucky, Xia Qing and I can’t hide the change in the spiritual Qi here. You’re the only cultivator among the laborers. As long as there’s a loss of spiritual energy, it must be you. We’ll catch you one by one!”

“I don’t dare!” Manzila quickly replied. He didn’t dare! I won’t dare to do it again!”

He couldn’t help but sigh in his heart. It seemed that the matter of cultivation was coming to an end. For a long time in the future, or even for the rest of his life, he would not be able to cultivate. It was a pity that his magical cultivation technique and his own cultivation would soon be wasted.

Manzila cherished his life very much, so he did not dare to take the risk to cultivate in secret. Besides, he believed Xia ruofei’s words without a doubt. Xia ruofei had just used his actions to prove that he had the ability to monitor the changes in the spiritual energy at all times.
