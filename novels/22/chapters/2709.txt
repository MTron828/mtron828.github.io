After hearing Xia ruofei’s words, Li Yifu revealed a thoughtful expression. After a while, he said,””I think I understand now! Grand uncle – Master, once they report this to the sect, it will also show their incompetence! Even if they give up on using commercial means, they will definitely try it with their own means!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”that’s pretty much the case.” Of course, the key problem is that I’m just a relatively rich ordinary person in their eyes. If they use the methods of cultivators to deal with me, I won’t be able to resist at all. Think about it, under such circumstances, would Wang Boshan and that martial uncle Zheng still report to the sect? Since it’s seized by the means of cultivators, the two of them are enough. Why report it to the sect and leave an incompetent influence on the higher – ups of the sect?”

“Yes! This disciple has learned!” Li Yifu lowered his head and said.

……

In the capital, in a luxury suite of the Wanhao hotel, Zheng Yongshou was in a rage. He pointed at Wang Boshan and asked with an ashen face,””What’s going on? Didn’t you already Pat your chest and guarantee that you’ll definitely be able to take down that Island? Why did the other party suddenly change his mind?”

Wang Boshan couldn’t help but criticize in his heart. Two days ago, Zheng Yongshou was also present at the private kitchen negotiation in the Prince’s Mansion. After the negotiation, Zheng Yongshou praised him a lot. Why did Xia ruofei change his mind now and it all became his responsibility? 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

However, Zheng Yongshou was his uncle – Master, so Wang Boshan did not dare to show his dissatisfaction.

He could only say helplessly,”martial uncle Zheng, I’ve only just found out about this news. There were no signs before this!” “The information from Paradise Island also shows that Xia ruofei flew directly to evac, the capital Island of ponatu, as soon as he arrived. He had a long discussion with ponatu’s Minister of Internal Affairs, Evian, behind closed doors. We have a mole in ponatu’s Minister of Internal Affairs and confirmed the news. I was caught off guard when Xia ruofei suddenly called today to say that he’s not selling the island!”

“What do we do now?” Zheng Yongshou gritted his teeth and said,”I told you not to go through so much trouble. Just go and restrain those people above. Even if you don’t want to kill, you can just lock them up! When the sect leader comes, we’ll investigate it carefully and determine the level of the natural formation. Then we’ll be able to control the island completely. As for the agate, who cares if they admit it or not?”

Wang Boshan smiled bitterly,”martial uncle Zheng, I’m just thinking for the sect.” Don’t worry, I’ll immediately contact the mole on the island to confirm the situation, and then we’ll discuss our next step. ”

“I guess this is the only way! Quickly make the call!” Zheng Yongshou said sullenly.

“Yes, martial uncle Zheng!” Wang Boshan said as he took out his phone.

This time, he naturally couldn’t wait to send a text message and then wait for bainilatti to call back. He immediately found bainilatti’s number and dialed it.

Fortunately, bainilatti didn’t hang up this time. After ringing for about six or seven times, he picked up.

“Mr. Wang, why did you call me directly?” Benilatti lowered his voice and said,”fortunately, the boss wasn’t with me just now. I found a quiet place to answer the call ...”

Wang Boshan said impatiently,””Cut the crap! I need first – hand information, and I’ll give you a lot of money!”

“What information would Mr. Wang like to know?” Beniladi asked slyly.

Wang Boshan did not beat around the bush and went straight to the point,””Xia ruofei called me just now to cancel the island deal. I want to know why. What had happened on the Peach Blossom Island since yesterday? Is there something unusual about it? As long as it’s something you know, or something you think is valuable, tell me! This time, the money will definitely be yours! As long as the information is useful, I will double the money!”

When bainilatti heard that, he couldn’t help but whistle and say,””Wow! Mr. Wang is too generous!”

“Don’t talk nonsense, I’m pressed for time!” Wang Boshan said impatiently,”hurry up and pick the useful ones.”

“Alright! Alright!” “Mr. King, I don’t know how to define the unusual thing you’re talking about,” benilatti said. However ... Something strange did happen on the island last night, and many people saw it. ”

“Oh?” Wang Boshan sat up straight and asked,”what happened?”

His intuition told him that the strange thing that bainilatti mentioned was probably the reason why Xia ruofei’s attitude had changed 180 degrees.

Wang Boshan didn’t know that Xia ruofei had deliberately created all this for him, including every word that bainilatti had said. It was carefully planned to mislead him and create an illusion.

Benilatti said in an uncertain tone,””I can’t tell you the details, but at around 10 O’ clock last night, a seven – colored light suddenly appeared on the west side of the island. Many people on the island saw it, but the boss immediately sent his own people over and sealed off the area. As for what exactly appeared, I think only the boss himself knows.”

“Seven – colored light?” Wang Boshan’s eyes revealed a strange look and he immediately asked,”you don’t know what it is? Then ... From the time the seven – colored light appeared until now, did Xia ruofei have any unusual behavior?”

“The boss and his men rushed over last night,” said benilatti,”but the light soon disappeared. Boss has locked himself in his room the entire day. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have been so relaxed ... Also, the Western area of the island has been sealed off. No one is allowed to approach!”

Wang Boshan’s expression changed and he asked,””Other than that, is there anything else that you feel is unusual? Think carefully again! The information you just told me is very useful. I will pay you three times the price! If you can still remember any useful information, I will give you more money! You might not even need to work for the rest of your life!”

“God ... Mr. King, you really are an Angel sent by God!” Beniladi praised Wang Boshan exaggeratedly in a greedy tone, then said,”let me think ... Let me think ... What else is unusual ...”

“Don’t worry, take your time to think ...” Wang Boshan said,”as long as you feel that there is something abnormal, you can tell me!”

Bainilatti muttered to himself for a while before saying with a hint of uncertainty,””Mr. Wang, there’s one more thing, but I’m not sure if it’ll be of any use to you ...”

“You go first!” Wang Boshan said.

“It’s just ... After the seven – colored light appeared yesterday, until now ... I feel that the air on the Paradise Island seems to be much fresher, and my mood is much better. I had a slight high blood pressure, but I just had my blood measured today, and it has actually returned to normal!” “Of course, this is just my subjective feeling. It probably won’t be of much use to you ...”

“No, no, no! This information is very important!” Wang Boshan said,”alright! Beniladi, I will pay you a million dollars! Check your account later!”

“Heavens! I’m so grateful to you!” Benilatti said excitedly,”thank you! Thank you!”

“I still have things to do here, so let’s leave it at that!” Wang Boshan said,”Oh right, this is a critical period. If there’s any situation, you must call me immediately. My phone can be reached 24 hours a day! You don’t have to worry about money, I’ve always been very generous with valuable information!”

“Alright! Alright!” Benilatti quickly said,”don’t worry, Mr. Wang. I’m your eyes in Paradise Island. Nothing here can be hidden from me!”

Wang Boshan hung up the phone, then looked at Zheng Yongshou and said,””Junior Master Zheng, I think ... I’ve found the reason why Xia ruofei suddenly changed his mind ...”
