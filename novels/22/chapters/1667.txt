Chapter 1668: A miraculous landing (1)

After the plane entered the approach phase, Brook was obviously nervous. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

This was because there would be more and more operations in the plane, and it would become more and more complicated. Even an experienced pilot would feel great pressure to complete the entire landing without the help of the automatic system.

Strictly speaking, Xia ruofei was not a pilot at all. Although Xia ruofei’s talent had amazed Brook in the flight just now, Brook had not even touched a simulator before. It was simply a fantasy to fly such a huge passenger plane to the ground.

If it wasn’t for the flight just now that gave Brook a little confidence in Xia ruofei, he might have already lost all hope.

Brook was extremely nervous and kept reminding Xia ruofei. Under Xia ruofei’s control, the plane passed through the clouds and they could see the blue sea below.

To Feng Jing, who was sitting behind Xia ruofei, this feeling was even more terrifying.

Anyone who had been on a plane before would know that when a plane was flying above the clouds, even though they knew that the White clouds could not hold the plane, they would still feel a sense of security.

After emerging from the clouds, they saw the boundless ocean below. Looking down from the sky, the ocean seemed to be still and unmoving. Moreover, the deep blue made it seem extremely deep, like a bottomless abyss.

Feng Rao had been clenching her fists ever since she entered the cockpit. It was as if doing so would help Xia ruofei exert more strength.

Her state of mind had gone from the uneasiness she felt in the first class cabin to calmness. She felt that everything was arranged by fate. If she were to die Here, at least she would be with Xia ruofei. They were so close to each other in their last moments, which was a great comfort to her.

From Feng Rao’s seat, she had to lean out slightly to see Xia ruofei’s side profile.

She maintained this position the entire time. Xia ruofei was very focused when he was flying the plane. He was like a magnet that attracted Feng Jing’s attention.

And his resolute side profile seemed to give Feng Jing a great sense of security.

“Xia, there’s another turn in front, and we’ll be at the 5th side of the airport.” Brook said,”let’s lower the landing gear first!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said calmly. Then, he reached out to pull down the landing gear.

After a while, the three green lights on the landing gear lit up. Brook also let out a sigh of relief. If there was another problem with the landing gear, it would really be a case of a leaking roof and a rainy night.

“Xia, let’s carry out the landing inspection!” Brook said.

“OK!”Xia ruofei said to Brook.

Brook leaned forward and tried. The pain in his arm made him groan. He frowned and thought for a while, then said,”MA ‘am, please come over and take out the clip in front of me ...”

Originally, the landing inspection of the 350 aircraft was carried out one by one on the flight computer. After each confirmation, it would be ticked. But now, many functions of the flight computer were out of use. Fortunately, they also backed up paper inspection forms in a folder in front of the pilot.

The folder had been inserted into a small gap, so it had not been sucked out of the plane by the high – speed airflow.

Now that they were flying at a much lower altitude and speed, the noise in the cabin was not as loud as before. They could still communicate normally if they were a little louder.

“Please wait!” Feng Rao nodded.

She unbuckled her seat belt, stood up, and walked to Brook’s side.

The windshield on the other side had disappeared, leaving a big hole. Xia ruofei couldn’t help but remind her,””Sister che, be careful!”

Feng Rao smiled at Xia ruofei and said, “Don’t worry!”

With one hand on the back of Brook’s seat, she leaned out and took out the folder with the other hand.

“Madam, please flip to the floor check – up report and read it out for me to verify!” Brook said.

Originally, the landing inspection form needed to be cross – confirmed by two pilots, but now they could only do it in an emergency. Of course, Brook would be more careful.

“OK!”As an elite who had just returned from abroad, Feng Jing naturally had no problem with English. She quickly flipped to the page with the check – up report and began to cooperate with Brook.

After the check, Brook said,””Madam, thank you very much. Now, please return to your seat and fasten your seat belt!”

“Alright!”

After Feng Jing sat back in the seat behind Xia ruofei, Brook said,””Xia, I’ll tell you about the situation at Saipan airport! Saipan is located in the Northern Mariana Islands between the Pacific Ocean and the Philippines Sea. It belongs to the subtropical marine climate with abundant rainfall. According to my experience, Saipan often has heavy rain in a short time and a small area. Because the area is very small, it is difficult for aircraft radar to observe it. Sometimes, even towers can’t observe it with the naked eye, so it will cause some trouble for flight!”

Xia ruofei nodded as he focused on controlling the plane.

“If this sudden heavy rain causes us to be unable to keep an eye on the runway,” Brook continued,”we have to make a decisive turn. After all, your flying experience ... Uh, after all, you’ve never controlled the plane to land!”
