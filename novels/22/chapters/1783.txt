Chapter 1784: Compromise (2)

The breakfast Wu Xiujuan prepared was quite sumptuous. Not only was there porridge, soy milk, deep – fried dough sticks, but there were also red sugar mantou and deep – fried dough cakes.

Wu Xiujuan had made all of them herself. Even the soy milk was ground on the spot, and she had fried the deep – fried dough sticks herself.

In the past, if Xia ruofei wanted to have such a sumptuous breakfast, the only way was to buy it from a breakfast shop. Otherwise, it would be quite difficult for him and Wu Qiang to make such a sumptuous breakfast.

Xia ruofei nodded and said while eating,””You guys eat too! How can I eat when everyone is looking at me like that! Oh right, Wu Qiang, go to the front and call your wife back for dinner!”

Wu Qiang said, somewhat embarrassed,””President Xia, Xiao LAN isn’t my girlfriend yet!”

“Isn’t that something that will happen sooner or later? Hurry up and go!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Auntie Wu, sit down and eat!”

“Boss Xia,” Wu Xiujuan said quickly,”you can eat first. I’m not hungry yet!”

Xia ruofei said seriously,”aunt Wu, I don’t have that many rules at home. Wu Qiang knows that there’s no distinction between boss and employee here. Everyone eats at the same table!”

“Yeah, sis – in – Law!” Wu Qiang nodded. President Xia never put on airs! Please sit down and eat!”

Wu Xiujuan sat down and ordered a bowl of porridge, but she was still a little nervous.

Xia ruofei didn’t say anything else and just ate his breakfast.

He knew that no matter what he said, Wu Xiujuan would definitely not feel at ease. After all, he was the boss. It might be better if he spent more time with her. For example, Wu Qiang was not as reserved as before.

Soon, Wu Qiang called Xia Xiaolan over and they had breakfast together.

Wu Xiujuan was busy cleaning up the dishes, and Xia Xiaolan continued to clean up. Wu Qiang, who couldn’t stay idle, drove his car out of the garage and started washing it in the backyard.

Xia ruofei returned to the courtyard where he lived and looked at the news on his phone uneasily. He was still thinking about Song Wei. He knew that Song Wei was determined this time and would not give up so easily.

As expected, Song Wei arrived at the courtyard house before nineo’ clock.

Xia ruofei came to the front yard. Song Wei was standing outside the gate of the courtyard. When she saw Xia ruofei, she said,””Ruofei, I’ve thought about it all night and decided to give it a try!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but smile bitterly and asked,””Song Wei, you ... Why do you have to do this?”

Song Wei looked into Xia ruofei’s eyes and asked,””I’ve been very calm today, and there shouldn’t be any problems with my mental state. I just want to ask you one thing ... Are you willing to help me?”

“Of course I’m willing to help you! Otherwise, what’s the point of all our hard work?” Xia ruofei said,”but the timing is still ...”

“I’m asking if you’re willing to help me get rid of the peach blossom miasma today?” Song Wei interrupted Xia ruofei and asked seriously.

Xia ruofei was silent for a moment before he asked,””What if I say no?”

Song Wei shrugged her shoulders without hesitation.”Then I’ll go back to school! I can’t force you if you don’t want to, can I? I can’t get rid of the peach blossom miasma by myself ...”

Xia ruofei leaned against the door frame and asked Song Wei,””There must be a ‘but’ after that, right?”

“Yeah!” Song Wei smiled.

“Tell me!”

“It’s nothing ... If you’re not willing to help me today, then I won’t cultivate the ‘absolute beginning Heart Sutra’ anymore.” Song Wei said calmly,”and ... He won’t try to get rid of the peach blossom miasma.”

At this point, Song Wei shrugged and said,”I think, if I don’t want to cooperate, even if your cultivation is high, you should not be able to do anything to the peach blossom miasma in my sea of consciousness, right?”

“Aren’t you being too cruel to yourself?”Xia ruofei widened his eyes.

“I’m not joking ...” Song Wei said.

Xia ruofei rubbed his temples and asked,””Song Wei, do you know what this means?”

“You told me about it!” Song Wei nodded. Although I can suppress it with my current cultivation, the peach blossom miasma might mutate as time passes.”Even if it remains the same, my cultivation will continue to decline because I stop cultivating. The final result will still be the same. My mind will be completely corroded by the poison ...”

Xia ruofei looked at Song Wei and did not say anything. After a long while, he sighed and said,””You can come in!”

Song Wei’s eyes brightened slightly at first, then a trace of sadness flashed across her eyes. She lifted her legs and walked into the courtyard house.

She knew that Xia ruofei was forced to agree. She should be happy that she had achieved her goal, but she could not.

The two of them walked one after the other through the front yard and arrived at the middle yard where Xia ruofei lived.

The two of them didn’t speak along the way, and the atmosphere was a little depressing.

When they entered the master suite, Xia ruofei said,””You can sit for a while! I’m going to the backyard ...”

After taking two steps, Xia ruofei turned around and explained,””I’ve hired a few more staff members. I have to tell them not to come here and disturb ...”

In fact, Xia ruofei just wanted to calm down. Otherwise, he could have just called Wu Qiang and informed him. Besides, regardless of whether it was a success or a failure, it should not take too long to get rid of the peach blossom miasma. If they were in the time formation, only a few minutes would have passed in the outside world when the whole process was over. There was no need for Xia ruofei to specifically inform Wu Qiang and the others.

Song Wei gently nodded and said,”En!”

Xia ruofei sighed to himself. After he walked out of the door, he lit a cigarette and took a few deep puffs. He then casually snuffed out the cigarette in the trash can and walked to the backyard to give Wu Qiang and the others some instructions.

When Xia ruofei returned to the master suite, he saw Song Wei sitting on the sofa quietly and reading a magazine. She seemed to be calm.

Even when Xia ruofei walked into the house, Song Wei only raised her eyes and then focused on the magazine again.

Xia ruofei shook his head and didn’t say anything. He went straight to the bedroom and took out the time array flag from the spirit map space.

He set up the time formation in the living room and said to Song Wei,””Go in!”

Song Wei nodded and put down the magazine. She followed Xia ruofei into the time formation.

Just like before, the two of them sat cross – legged facing each other. The only difference was that they had been cultivating before, but this time, it was a very dangerous attempt.

Xia ruofei did not ask Song Wei if she was mentally prepared for failure. He said, “Let’s start!” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Song Wei nodded. The two of them reached out their hands at the same time, and their palms touched.

“First, circulate the” absolute beginning Heart Sutra “!” Xia ruofei said in a deep voice.

Since he had decided to take the risk, Xia ruofei quickly got rid of all distracting thoughts and focused on Song Wei. He could not persuade Song Wei to give up on the idea, so he could only try his best to increase the success rate.

The two of them tacitly began to merge their true Qi according to the cultivation method of the “Scripture of the primordium origin”. This had been done countless times in the past. The two true Qi merged together, and they were in each other’s bodies. They took turns to carry out the Qi circulation of the “Scripture of the primordium origin”.

The soul frequencies of the two of them gradually synchronized after a few cycles.

One round, two rounds ... Until the true energy had reached the peak and the soul Frequency was almost the same, Xia ruofei said in a deep voice,””Song Wei, I’ll be in charge of the rest. You have to let down all your defenses and let my spiritual energy enter your sea of consciousness.”

“No problem, let’s start!” Song Wei said calmly.

Xia ruofei nodded. He used a large amount of mental energy to weave an impenetrable invisible net and completely wrapped the ball of vital energy.

He urged his true Qi to follow Song Wei’s meridians all the way up. Finally, he felt as if he had entered an empty world.

Xia ruofei used his spiritual power to sense and soon, the situation in this empty space was presented in his mind without missing anything.

This was Song Wei’s sea of consciousness? Xia ruofei gasped.
