2501 Arrival at Barcelona (2)

Wu Lei had successfully passed the physical examination of the Spanish club a few days ago and officially joined the club.

Perhaps it was because of the club owner’s Chinese background or the huge Chinese market behind Wu Lei, the Spanish club held a special press conference for Wu Lei’s joining and also organized a Grand joining ceremony.

Many Chinese people in Spain rushed to Barcelona from afar to attend Wu Lei’s joining ceremony.

Wu Lei also showed off his footwork on the court as usual. His performance could be said to be average, or at least he did not make a fool of himself.

“That’s right. He usually rests in the club at noon. After a day of training, there’s a car that will send him back to the hotel!” Zhou leiyun nodded.

“This treatment is not bad!” Xia ruofei grinned.”Director Zhou, find a time for me to meet Wu Lei. I want to talk to him!”

“No problem!” Zhou leiyun promised.

The two of them chatted for a while and soon, the check – in procedures were completed. Zhou leiyun personally sent Xia ruofei upstairs.

This time, Zhou leiyun had shown his sincerity, and the reception was also very high.

Xia ruofei was staying in a luxurious suite, while the other employees were staying in the king – sized rooms. At first, Zhou leiyun did not know that there was a higher – up from Paradise Corporation in Xia ruofei’s group. After knowing Dong Yun’s identity, he immediately ordered Zhou Yuan to change Dong Yun’s room to a suite, and it was on the same floor as Xia ruofei’s room.

...

Everyone went back to their rooms to rest while Zhou leiyun accompanied Xia ruofei to the luxurious suite.

As for Zhou Yuan, Zhou leiyun was annoyed when he saw his cautious and submissive appearance, so he simply sent him away.

The luxury suite had a spacious living room, a dining room, a small kitchen, and a large bathroom with a high – end Jacuzzi. The view of the suite was also the best of all the rooms. Standing in front of the bay window in the bedroom, one could have a panoramic view of the beautiful scenery of Gorte, and the main cathedral of Barcelona was close by.

Zhou leiyun chatted with Xia ruofei about the upcoming arrangements, then got up and left. Xia ruofei and the rest had been on the plane for more than ten hours. Now that they had arrived at the hotel, they definitely had to rest. Zhou leiyun did not want to disturb them.

Earlier on, Zhou leiyun had already discussed with Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei and the rest would be resting in the hotel that afternoon to recover their energy. The next day, Zhou leiyun would arrange for someone to accompany Dong Yun and the rest on a tour around Barcelona. Xia ruofei would follow Zhou leiyun to the Espanyol club and make a trip to the club. Although Xia ruofei and Zhou leiyun had signed the share transfer agreement, there were still some procedures that could only be completed in Spain.

However, Xia ruofei had underestimated the enthusiasm of Dong Yun and the others. As soon as Zhou leiyun left, Dong Yun asked in the group,”Chairman, what are our plans for the afternoon? Is it a group activity or a free activity?

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but send a message in the group.”He didn’t have any plans for the afternoon! Everyone had been on the plane for such a long time, were they not tired? I think it’s better to rest in the hotel and go out tomorrow!

Dong Yun directly sent a voice message over, “I’m not tired at all!”

Shi wen,[not tired +1]

Jiang Zhou,[not tired +2]

……

...

The employees replied that they were not tired. Xia ruofei did not know whether to laugh or cry.

Hence, he gave Zhou leiyun a call and asked him to arrange for someone to bring Dong Yun and the others out for a trip.

“No problem!” Zhou leiyun said with a smile. President Xia, I’ll get someone to show President Dong and the others around the Laocheng District, and we can try the local specialties tonight!”

“I’ve caused you trouble!” Xia ruofei laughed bitterly.”These employees have been too tense for a while. Now that they’re on vacation, they look like they’ve been revived!” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Hahaha! It’s no trouble at all!” Zhou leiyun said candidly,”director Xia, aren’t you going out for a walk?”

“I’m not going!” Xia ruofei said,”I can’t rest well on the plane. I think I’ll catch up on sleep!”

“That works too! I’ll come and find you for dinner tonight, and I’ll call Wu Lei along. ” Zhou leiyun said readily,”let’s have a meal at the hotel today. The main thing is to have a good chat!”

“I’ll follow your arrangements!” Xia ruofei said.

Then, Xia ruofei suddenly thought of something. After hesitating for a while, he asked,””Director Zhou, is it convenient to arrange for everyone to visit nokapu tomorrow?”

The Espanyol and Barcelona clubs were not on the same level at all, but they were still arch – enemies in the same city. Even Xia ruofei felt that it was a little too much to ask the Espanyol club owner to send someone to take everyone to visit Barcelona’s home ground, nokapu Stadium.

Zhou leiyun was stunned for a moment, then he smiled bitterly and asked,””They all want to visit nokapu?”

...

“Not really, but President Dong is a die – hard fan of Barcelona. Since she’s in Barcelona this time, she’s definitely going to make a pilgrimage to nocape!” Xia ruofei said,”a few other employees also expressed similar opposite opinions. They are not loyal to Barcelona, but when their friends in China learned that they were on vacation in Barcelona, fans would ask them to bring some Barcelona souvenirs, authentic jerseys, and so on. It would be even better if they could get Messi’s autograph ...”

“I understand!” Zhou leiyun said with a bitter smile,”but on non – Match days, I won’t be able to see those star players in nokapu ...”

To be honest, Zhou leiyun felt a little bitter in his heart. As the owner of the Spanish club, how could he be willing to let his Club Live in the shadow of bar?a? However, this was the cruel reality for now.

Even with Wu Lei, the fans from China would obviously like bar?a more at the club level.

If they were given a choice between visiting Barcelona’s home ground and visiting Spain’s home ground, everyone would probably choose the former without thinking.

The two of them chatted for a while more before Zhou leiyun hung up. He wanted to arrange for someone to be Dong Yun’s tour guide.

As for visiting nokapu, that would be tomorrow at least, and the premise was that nokapu would be open tomorrow.

Xia ruofei took a bath in the bathroom, changed into a bathrobe in the closet, and lay down on the bed in the bedroom. Because China and Spain had a six – hour time difference, it was almost time to sleep in China, so Xia ruofei fell asleep very quickly after lying down.

When his phone on the bedside table vibrated, the sky outside had already turned dark.

Xia ruofei reached for his phone and glanced at it. It was Zhou leiyun. He picked it up and said,””General manager Zhou ...”

“President Xia, are you still sleeping?” Zhou leiyun said apologetically,”I’m sorry! I’ve disturbed your rest ...”

...

Xia ruofei yawned and said,””It’s fine, I should get up too! Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to get over the time difference. General manager Zhou, have you arrived at the hotel?”

“I just arrived. I’m at the bar on the second floor!” Zhou leiyun chuckled and said,”it’s fine. You can take your time to pack. Wu Lei has just returned from training. We’ll meet on the second floor later!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said.

He rolled out of bed and went to the bathroom to wash his face. Then, he changed out of his pajamas and took out a casual suit from the space. After that, he left the room and took the elevator to the second floor.

As Xia ruofei walked into the bar on the second floor, he saw Zhou leiyun waving at him from a distance. Opposite Zhou leiyun sat a young man in the Spanish team’s yellow sportswear.

Xia ruofei walked over.

Zhou leiyun did not choose a private room. Instead, he asked for a booth by the window, where he could enjoy the night view of the Laocheng District.

“Director Zhou, sorry to keep you waiting!” Xia ruofei walked over and said with a smile.

“I’ve only just arrived!” Zhou leiyun smiled and said,”President Xia, let me introduce you ...”

“There’s no need for an introduction. Wu Lei is a famous star player in our country. Who doesn’t know him?” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”Hello! I’m Xia ruofei. ”

“Hello, President Xia!” Wu Lei quickly said.

...

“Let’s sit down and talk!” Zhou leiyun beckoned him over.”Wu Lei, don’t be so reserved. Have a seat!”
