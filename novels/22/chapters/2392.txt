In fact, if Xia ruofei had read the data in the USB drive, it was possible that he could have taken all the money in the bank account for himself. After all, they had just met and Tony did not know what kind of person Xia ruofei was.

However, he was already on his deathbed and there was no one he could trust. He could only choose to trust Xia ruofei.

As Xia ruofei listened, he reached out and searched Tony’s body. He found his wallet and the USB flash drive in his waist bag.

“Is this the USB drive?” Xia ruofei asked as he took out a photo from Tony’s wallet. It was a girl who looked to be 14 or 15 years old. She had two golden braids and a bright smile on her face.

Xia ruofei turned the photo around and saw an address and contact number written on the back. He showed the back of the photo to Tony and asked,””This is the address and phone number, right?”

Tony nodded with difficulty and said,””Please ... I’m counting on you!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”don’t worry!” I’ll give this USB and the things you left behind to your daughter. ”

Tony panted with difficulty as he nodded gently. Blood kept oozing out of his mouth, and he was about to die.

“Do you have anything else to say?” Xia ruofei asked.

Tony squeezed out a smile and said,””Live ... Live on ... Stay away ... From this damn battle ...”

Halfway through his sentence, he could no longer catch his breath. His head tilted to the side, and he completely stopped breathing.

Xia ruofei looked at Tony’s dilated pupils and sighed. He closed his eyes and put him down.

Xia ruofei did not keep Tony’s body as he was being cautious. There must be surveillance cameras in the Qin Zhuan coffee shop. After the explosion, the surveillance cameras must have stopped working. However, the data before the explosion might still be intact. When the local government investigated this case, they would definitely look at the surveillance data. When they compared it, they would find that Tony was missing.

Besides, Xia ruofei had also considered that this was an area controlled by the government. If Tony’s body was left here, the local government would definitely take care of it. After identifying him, they would probably inform his family.

At this moment, Xia ruofei could hear the shrill sound of police sirens approaching.

He did not stay in the coffee shop any longer. He reached into Tony’s pocket and found the car keys. He took one last look at Tony, then got up and quickly left the coffee shop.

Xia ruofei found Tony’s Ford SUV not far away.

The car’s glass had been shattered by the blast, and there were glass shards everywhere.

Xia ruofei opened the car door and waved his hand. A wisp of spiritual power swept out and swept all the glass shards on the driver’s seat to the side.

He sat in the car and inserted the key to try it out. When he found that the car could still start normally, he quickly changed gears, stepped on the gas, and left the vicinity of the coffee shop.

Xia ruofei drove the Ford SUV and passed by the fire trucks, ambulances, and police cars that were speeding towards them.

After he drove out of Deca town, he found a place to park the car.

Then, Xia ruofei cleaned up the car and put all the things Tony left in the car, the USB and the photo with the address and phone number into the spirit map space.

Xia ruofei had specially used the spatial laws to create a small space in the spatial mountain and sea realm to store Tony’s belongings.

Xia ruofei had no intention of opening the USB drive that Tony had specially entrusted to him.

He could guess that the things inside must be very important, and it was very likely to involve some financial issues. However, Xia ruofei’s net worth was at least a few billion dollars. Even if he was not a scholar, he would not have such a crooked idea.

Xia ruofei planned to pass all of Tony’s belongings to his daughter, Ames, after he was done with the things here.

After putting away Tony’s belongings, Xia ruofei sat in the driver’s seat, deep in thought.

There was also a waist bag in front of him, which also belonged to Tony.

In addition to the USB flash drive, Tony’s passport, reporter’s id, and so on were also in the waist bag.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and finally decided to change into Tony’s appearance.

He used a secret technique to slightly adjust his bones, bones, and muscles. At the same time, he also changed his skin color a little using a makeup investigation technique. He also slightly adjusted his hairstyle and stuck some beard on his face.

In a short while, Xia ruofei’s appearance was at least 70% to 80% similar to Tony ‘s. If one only looked at the not – so – Clear ID photo on the passport, they would be exactly the same.

Xia ruofei did not plan to use Tony’s identity to move around in vadira. He only did so to deal with the possible inspections on the way. By changing into Tony’s appearance, it was equivalent to having a complete set of identification documents. Whether it was in the government – controlled area or the anti – Government armed area, as a reporter, he could pass through without any obstacles in most cases.

Of course, if it was an area of intense battle or a place involving military secrets, then they could not enter. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei would not use Tony’s appearance for the actual operation. Even though Tony had died, Xia ruofei did not want to bring trouble to his family.
