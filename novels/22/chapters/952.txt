Chapter 953: Outstanding talent (1)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei took a look and realized that there were no mistakes. He felt even more relieved.

It seemed that Xia Qing was right. Tang Haoran’s cultivation talent was indeed very good. Otherwise, it was hard to imagine that a six or seven – year – old child could remember the true energy circulation route in such a short time. Moreover, he could remember the names of those acupuncture points without any error even when he didn’t understand or even recognize the words.

Xia ruofei nodded approvingly.””Haoran, well done! Everything is correct. ”

Tang Haoran was so happy that he beamed with joy, just like a child who was praised by his teacher at school.

Xia ruofei then took the map that Tang Haoran had marked and explained the names of the acupuncture points to him one by one. He even made him remember the words that he did not know.

Of course, Xia ruofei did not go into detail. He only asked Tang Haoran to remember the names of the acupuncture points and the flow of genuine Qi. After all, he was still too young and could only recognize a few words. He would not be able to understand things that were too complicated.

Tang Haoran followed Xia ruofei’s instructions seriously and memorized the names of the acupuncture points.

Then, Xia ruofei separated another wisp of true Qi and demonstrated it a few times in Tang Haoran’s meridians along the path of the “fierce yang Scripture” before he retracted his true Qi.

However, a wisp of his spiritual power still remained in Tang Haoran’s body.

Xia ruofei said,”Haoran, imagine that there is a ball of genuine Qi in your dantian. Then, follow the mental cultivation method I taught you and direct it to move according to the route you just took.”

“Yes, master!” Tang Haoran nodded and said.

The pure Yang Qi in Tang Haoran’s body had already been concentrated in Xia ruofei’s dantian.

Therefore, Tang Haoran followed Xia ruofei’s request and used the mental cultivation method of the “fierce yang Scripture”. The innate pure Yang Qi in his dantian, which had been suppressed by Xia ruofei’s spiritual power, immediately calmed down and began to rotate counterclockwise, forming a small cyclone.

After a while, the innate pure Yang Qi began to obediently follow Tang Haoran’s instructions and entered his meridians.

“Master, I can feel the heat!” Tang Haoran exclaimed happily.

“Stop!” Xia ruofei scolded sternly.

Tang Haoran did not know what was going on. He quickly stopped his heart technique and looked back at Xia ruofei nervously like a child who had done something wrong.

Xia ruofei used his spiritual power to suppress the innate pure Yang Qi and said seriously,””What did master say before? When cultivating, one must be completely focused and not be distracted in the slightest, or it would lead to very serious consequences! What did you do just now?”

“I’m sorry, master,”Tang Haoran said guiltily,” I felt the heat just now. I was so happy that I forgot ...”

Xia ruofei’s expression was serious.”This is the first and last time. Otherwise, don’t cultivate anymore. You can live a safe and healthy life without cultivating. If you cultivate, you might go into Qi deviation! If it’s light, he’ll be crippled. If it’s heavy, he’ll lose his life. This isn’t a joke!”

When Xia ruofei said this, he used a trace of his spiritual power. It carried an unquestionable authority. It made Tang Haoran’s heart tremble. These words were deeply engraved in his heart.

Tang Haoran did not dare to look Xia ruofei in the eye. He lowered his head and said,””Master, I’ll really remember it. I won’t do it again!”

Xia ruofei’s expression softened. He nodded and said,””Rest for 3 minutes, then continue to cultivate. I hope you won’t let me down this time!”

“Yes!”

Unconsciously, Xia ruofei’s image in Tang Haoran’s heart had changed from an amiable big brother to a strict and even harsh master.

Although he still felt very close to Xia ruofei, there was a hint of respect in this closeness.

This was also the effect that Xia ruofei hoped to achieve. However, Tang Haoran was too weak. Once he had extraordinary power, it was easy for him to go to the extreme if he had a problem with his mind. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

However, if he had a master that he respected, who would constantly remind and spur him on, the possibility of him going astray would be greatly reduced.

The break time passed quickly. Tang Haoran asked carefully,””Master, can I try again?”

“Did you remember what I said just now?” Xia ruofei asked.

“I’ve remembered it all!” Tang Haoran said quickly.

“Then let’s start!” Xia ruofei nodded.

Tang Haoran immediately sat down cross – legged and began to practice the mental cultivation method that Xia ruofei had taught him.

The innate pure Yang Qi in his dantian began to spin slowly again, and then a small wisp of it separated and entered his meridians.

A trace of Xia ruofei’s spiritual power remained in Tang Haoran’s body to monitor his first cultivation.

Once the innate pure Yang Qi was activated, Tang Haoran felt the heat again. However, this time, he remembered Xia ruofei’s words. He did not have any emotional fluctuations. He guarded his bier and concentrated on circulating the “fierce yang Scripture”.

Xia ruofei’s spiritual power detected that the innate pure Yang Qi in Tang Haoran’s meridians was slowly being converted into true Qi. At the same time, it was also nourishing and transforming his meridians.

Xia ruofei had already experienced this process when he was cultivating. However, this time, as a bystander, Xia ruofei still had a little understanding of cultivation.

Tang Haoran was indeed a cultivation genius with an innate pure yang body. His speed of transforming the innate pure Yang Qi was only slightly slower than Xia ruofei ‘s.

Time passed by. When the last wisp of innate pure Yang Qi was absorbed, Tang Haoran’s cultivation speed suddenly slowed down. At this time, his body had already cultivated true Qi.

Xia ruofei checked and found that Tang Haoran had already entered the first level of the Qi refining stage.

For ordinary people, it was extremely difficult to step into the threshold of cultivation.

However, Tang Haoran had extraordinary talent and the help of the innate pure Yang Qi, so he easily completed the crucial first step.

Tang Haoran also felt that his cultivation speed had slowed down. He stopped cultivating and said,””Master, it seems like the increase in true energy is not as obvious as before.”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”that’s because you’ve already defeated the flaming monster in your body and used it as nutrients for your body.” Now that we don’t have the flaming monster, we can only rely on the spiritual energy from the outside world to cultivate. Naturally, our cultivation speed has slowed down. ”

“I see ...” Tang Haoran said,”master, if I had known earlier, you would have left more flaming monsters for me to deal with!”

Xia ruofei patted Tang Haoran’s head and said,””You still don’t quite understand the logic that too much is as bad as not enough, but you have to remember that the surge in strength is not always a good thing. Everything has to be controlled to a certain extent, otherwise your body will not be able to take it.”

“I got it!” Tang Haoran nodded and said.

“Haoran, the spiritual Qi on earth is barren now. The environment is very bad for cultivators.” Xia ruofei said seriously,”only the spiritual energy at midnight and Mao am can barely meet the needs of cultivation ...”

Xia ruofei paused and continued,””Midnight is from 11 p.m. To 1 a.m. You’re still growing, so you can’t stay up so late at night. You have to make good use of the time to practice every day, which is from 5 a.m. To 7 a.m.”

“Yes, master!” Tang Haoran said,”I’ll wake up before five every day and persevere in my cultivation!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. Cultivate diligently every day. I’ll check your cultivation progress regularly. But you can’t be too hasty. Every step must be steady, and remember not to be impetuous!”

Tang Haoran was still so young, so it would not be convenient for Xia ruofei to bring him along to cultivate. Thus, he had to rely on himself to cultivate for the next few years. That was why he had to give instructions to him patiently.

However, according to the normal rate of cultivation, it would take a few months or even a year for Tang Haoran to break through the first stage of the scorching sun Scripture. Hence, after Xia ruofei taught him the mental cultivation method of the first stage, he did not need to guide and supervise him all the time.

“I understand, master.” Tang Haoran said obediently.

“Also, don’t be careless if you have any problems with your cultivation. If you’re not sure or feel uncomfortable, call me immediately. This is no joke.” Xia ruofei said seriously.

“I’ll remember that! Master, don’t worry!” Tang Haoran nodded his head heavily.

Xia ruofei smiled.”I’m sure you’ll remember my words. Let’s go and take a shower!”

“A bath?” Tang Haoran was puzzled.”Master, I took a shower before I left!”

“Look at your body ...” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Tang Haoran lowered his head and smelled the stench on his body. His exposed skin was also covered with a thin layer of black oil.

These were the impurities discharged from his body after he had stepped into the threshold of cultivation. The innate pure Yang Qi had transformed his body’s meridians and meridians, which also produced a lot of impurities. However, Tang Haoran was still young, so there were not many impurities in his body. Otherwise, this layer of filth would be even more obvious.

Tang Haoran could not help but exclaim in surprise. His face revealed a trace of embarrassment.

Xia ruofei chuckled and asked,”can I take a bath on my own?” Do you need master’s help?”

Tang Haoran quickly straightened his back and said,”No need! Master, I’m now a man who defeated the flaming monster, so of course I’m going to wash myself ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”then go to the bathroom!” I’ll ask your parents to prepare a set of clean clothes for you. You can’t wear this set of clothes anymore, so just throw it away later!”

“Yes, master!” Tang Haoran immediately got up and sneaked into the bathroom.

Xia ruofei went downstairs and told Tang Yitian and his wife to prepare a clean set of clothes for Tang Haoran.

When Tang Yitian heard that Tang Haoran had discharged a lot of impurities from his body during his first cultivation and was taking a shower upstairs, he was so happy that he almost jumped up. He immediately called Tang Hu and asked him to send two sets of Tang Haoran’s clothes over.

Jennifer did not know what cultivation was, but when she saw her husband’s overjoyed look, she was also very happy and thanked Xia ruofei repeatedly.

Just then, Xia ruofei heard Tang Haoran’s exclamation from upstairs.

He quickly called Tang Yitian and Jennifer and quickly ran upstairs.
