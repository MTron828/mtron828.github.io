Chapter 1363: Discussing the big plan together (1)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei pulled everyone back to the normal conversation track and also appropriately cooled down the young masters.

Zhao Yongjun was the oldest and the most mature of them all. At the same time, he had been in the business for many years after leaving the Army and was relatively familiar with the business world.

So Zhao Yong Jun touched his chin and said,””The amount of investment depends on how big the business we want to do. First of all, the clubhouse must be opened in the capital. With the land price in the capital, which is extremely expensive, the cost of land must be very high. And we don’t want to open a clubhouse in a building like those who sell sheep’s head and dog meat, so we can consider a slightly remote location. The land price outside the fourth and fifth ring roads will be much cheaper than the central area and the Embassy area.”

“Agreed!” Song Rui nodded. There’s no place to build a race track in the Urban area!”

“Even if they want to build it, they need to have the guts to approve it!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”besides, don’t even think about the racing track for now. If you want to build an international standard race track, you’ll need at least a few billion dollars. The maintenance cost is also very high. The most important thing is that the profit margin is too low ...”

Song Rui was disappointed when he heard that. However, he really liked to play with cars, so he couldn’t help but say,””Then, can’t we make it smaller and lower the standards?”

Zhao Yongjun laughed and said,”then we might as well not do it!” If we want to do it, it’ll definitely be the best! Otherwise, wouldn’t it be embarrassing for everyone?”

Zhao Yongjun’s words were in line with the mentality of song Rui and the others. This group of second and third generation people were not afraid of anything, so they could not do anything that would embarrass them.

Hence, before song Rui’s plan could even be carried out, it had already been aborted ... FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei said,”brother Zhao’s location is a little off the mark. I personally agree. On one hand, it’s cost – wise. On the other hand, it’s for privacy.” In the future, there will definitely be a threshold for membership services. I think for the guests who are qualified to spend in the club, they can at least afford a car!”

Hou Liang and the others laughed when they heard this. Xu Zixuan even said,”There are many high – end clubs that are developing in the suburbs. After all, the land in the suburbs is more spacious and the price is cheaper.”

“Alright!” Zhao Yongjun nodded.”Then after we go back, we’ll split up to understand the situation and see if there’s any land around the fifth ring that’s ready to be sold!”

“I’ll leave this matter to you guys!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”the functions of the club don’t have to be big and complete, but as long as it’s decided to start, it must be top – notch!”

This was Xia ruofei’s principle of quality.

Liu Jian nodded and said,”if you want to do it, then do it!” Let’s make a preliminary decision on what functions we need to achieve, and then we’ll entrust a professional organization to do an evaluation!”

Xu Zixuan said,”food and beverage is definitely indispensable!” It doesn’t matter how big the club is, this is just a basic function. ”

“Of course!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I feel that the Ling’s private kitchen’s standard for Chinese food should not be a problem, especially the two signature dishes. If it really doesn’t work, I can ask the Ling’s food and beverage group’s Executive Head Chef to bring them over for a while. The quality of the dishes can be guaranteed!”

Zhao Yongjun nodded.”Western food is also a must. Everyone, use your connections. It’ll be best if you can invite one or two Michelin star chefs to join us!”

Hou Liang and the others all nodded.

Everyone then discussed some other things in the club. Everyone had their own preferences. Other than Wei Jun, who was basically a bystander, everyone expressed their opinions.

Even after breakfast, there was still no solution. Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,””How about this! Let’s first roughly determine the investment amount, and then find a professional company to make a plan for us according to this amount. What do you think?”

“I think we can!” Zhao Yongjun immediately said,”ruofei, how much do you think is suitable for the initial investment?”

Xia ruofei smiled.”I’m not as familiar with the situation in the capital as you guys are. You guys can tell me more!”

So everyone turned their attention to Zhao Yongjun and talked about business. Zhao Yongjun was definitely the best among them.

Zhao Yongjun thought about it and smiled,””Considering the land price and construction cost, I think we won’t be able to do much if we invest too little. How about this? We’ll invest 500 million in one episode! The total investment will be no less than 1.5 billion. What do you think?”

When Zhao Yongjun said that, Hou Liang and the others looked at each other. Even song Rui was a little speechless.”Brother Zhao, this ... This is a bit too much, right? The few of us ... Can we gather such a large sum of money?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”don’t look at me!” I can’t possibly take out so much money at once ...”

In fact, if it was an initial investment, Xia ruofei could still gather all his overseas assets. However, since everyone was investing, it would be meaningless if he owned the majority of the shares.

“Since you’ve mentioned the investment amount, there must be a reason,” Xia ruofei continued.”Why don’t you tell us more about it?”

“Don’t be scared by this number,” Zhao Yongjun said with a smile.”We don’t actually need to take out so much money.”

“First of all,” Zhao Yongjun analyzed,”we don’t have to pay the full transfer fee all at once to get the land from the government. This is negotiable. It shouldn’t be a problem to pay it off within a year. We can save a lot of money here.
