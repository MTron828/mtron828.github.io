2559 Heavenly fairy! Fatal blow!_2

After passing palrejo, Xia ruofei did not hesitate to dribble the ball forward at high speed.

No one, including the players of Espanyol, realized how fast Xia ruofei’s speed would be if he were to charge. This was under the condition that he did not use his true energy. He was much faster than these active professional players by relying on his body alone.

Parejo quickly turned around and gave chase. However, he realized in despair that his sprinting speed could not match Xia ruofei’s dribbling speed. The distance between the two was getting wider and wider.

The Spaniards also realized that this was a great opportunity. After the valentian team was bypassed by two players in a row, a huge gap appeared on the right side.

Both Wu Lei and iglasias immediately ran forward at high speed. Iglasias went straight into the penalty area, while Wu Lei ran on his most familiar right side.

Xia ruofei was not greedy for the possession of the ball. Before the opponent’s defenders were in position, he calmly raised his leg and passed the ball. Similarly, he passed the ball without any observation.

Although Xia ruofei did not even look at it, the accuracy of the kick was outrageously high. It went straight to iglasias in the penalty area.

In fact, Xia ruofei had also noticed Wu Lei, but compared to him, Iglesia’s position was obviously better to see that the opponent’s defensive formation was not tight in a hurry, and they had changed positions. Now, the one defending against Iglesia was a small man, and Iglesia had an absolute advantage in fighting for the header.

The ball was almost sent to iglasias’s head. All he needed to do was to pull it up on the spot and then swing his head to attack the goal.

Everyone’s hearts were in their throats the moment iglésias headed the goal.

The ball was too fast and too close. In addition, Xia ruofei’s pass had an obvious forward charge, which made the ball even faster.

It could be said that as long as iglesias was within the range of the goal, the goal was almost certain to go in.

Valencia’s goalkeeper was also in despair. He could only watch as iglassias headed the reverse corner and the football flew toward the left corner of the goal. Even if his arm was ten centimeters longer, he would not have been able to reach it.

As soon as the ball was headed out, he felt like it was there. He even wanted to start celebrating.

However, with a loud bang, Iglesia’s heart sank to the bottom. The ball was almost in his mouth. He actually headed it a little higher, and the football hit the crossbar and then bounced out of the penalty area. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

The football bounced in the direction of Wu Lei’s forward plug, but the height was a little high. Wu Lei jumped with all his might, but the football still fell behind him through his hair ...

This was the best chance, and the game was quickly entering injury time. Perhaps this was the last chance. He did not expect iglasias’s header to miss by a hair’s breadth, and he was unable to grab the second drop point in time. He had missed it just like that!

Just as Valencia’s players heaved a sigh of relief, a blue figure rushed toward the ball from the right flank at high speed!

It was Xia ruofei!

He did not slow down after passing the ball, but continued to rush in the direction of the penalty area.

Then, the football bounced back just like that.

No matter how strong Xia ruofei’s spiritual power was, it was impossible for him to predict this kind of ball. He did not know at all that iglecia would head sideways, let alone where the football would bounce to. It was purely his attacking instinct.

In fact, Xia ruofei had overdone it. However, his strong body coordination allowed him to adjust his center of gravity in time and stop.

At this time, the football had already flown to his side and behind him. He quickly turned his body and did not wait for the football to land. He directly did a half – turn and fiercely kicked the football. The football suddenly crossed a beautiful arc and whizzed back to the goal!

The ball was so fast that Valencia’s goalkeeper, Neto, could only turn his head in time and watch the ball enter the net.

The stadium was silent. The Valencia players held their heads in their hands and looked at the ball that was still spinning in the net in disbelief.

We’re falling behind just like that? The game is about to end, so ... Are we going to lose? To lose to a weak team like RCD Espanyol on our home ground?

These players were all filled with confusion. The opponent’s number 25 player was simply on steroids today. A Chinese player who had never appeared in front of the media, who seemed to have descended from the sky. In today’s game, there was a super long – distance drop shot, a super elevator ball from 35 meters away, and a high shot from the corner of the penalty area. There were a total of three shots, and three goals were scored. It was a hat – Magic!

This was simply a bug that had no solution!

Valencia’s players and the coaching staff on the sidelines felt a sense of helplessness.

The home fans quieted down the moment Xia ruofei scored the goal. Then, sparse applause rang out from the stands. Soon, the applause grew louder and louder, and finally resounded throughout the entire Stadium!

The home fans stood up and applauded their opponent’s beautiful goal!

The away team’s stands became a boiling ocean. The Spanish fans were singing and dancing. Xue Jinshan and the others became the most popular people in the stands because they were Xia ruofei and Wu Lei’s compatriots. Everyone enthusiastically came over to chat with them.

Despite the language barrier, football was the best language.

“After Xia ruofei broke through two of the opposing players, he quickly dribbled the ball through the center line. There is a wide open space in front of him and he has many choices! Wu Lei and iglesis are both quickly cutting forward. This is an opportunity for the Spanish team!” Shen fangjian said excitedly,”Xia ruofei has chosen a 45 – degree angle! The ball could actually go further down the end line ... The drop point was not bad! ‘Iglasias’ header!’ This ball is ... Sigh! It actually hit the crossbar ... Wu Lei didn’t get the ball either, it’s too ... Wait! Xia ruofei grabbed the second drop point. He did not wait for the ball to land and directly shot it with all his might! Woah! The ball went in! The ball went in! The ball ... Is in!”

Shen fangjian shouted with passion,”this is a beautiful high – Air shot!” The football drew a charming arc and went straight to the dead end of the goal. Neto did not even make a move to save it! Xia ruofei performed a hat – trick! This is a great competition!”

Jia Tianning was also very excited, he said,””The fans who stayed up all night to watch the game tonight were worth it! I even feel like I’m dreaming! Our Chinese players scored four goals in one game of the top league, and Xia ruofei even scored a hat – trick! This is simply unbelievable!”

“I really regret using the term ‘fairy from beyond the heavens’ when Xia ruofei scored the second goal!” Shen fangjian said,”this is clearly the perfect replica of the transcendent flying immortal! And Xia ruofei’s ball was even further away from the goal! The arc is more beautiful!”

“Fairy from beyond the heavens” was used to describe Zidane’s winning goal in the 2002 UEFA Champions League Final game against Reynold’s Reynold, where he used his amazing left foot to do a half – turn in the air and score an angry goal.

Indeed, Xia ruofei’s shot was very similar to Zidane’s famous fairy from beyond the heavens. Moreover, Xia ruofei’s shooting position was in the corner of the penalty area, much further than Zidane’s shot.

Through the slow – Motion replay, everyone was more aware of the difficulty and excitement of the goal.

At that time, Xia ruofei continued to plug in after passing the ball. In fact, when the ball bounced back from the crossbar, he had already run two body lengths away. However, he forcefully braked to a stop and turned around.

The ball was at the height of Xia ruofei’s chest. Under normal circumstances, Xia ruofei would have run towards the ball and stopped it.

But in this way, the opposing defenders would definitely come up and they could only play the position attack again.

Xia ruofei had chosen the extremely difficult half – turn to shoot in the air. At this time, he could not see the goal at all. Moreover, the football was so high that his body was almost horizontal when he shot.

Even so, the football still drew a beautiful arc and hit the absolute dead end!
