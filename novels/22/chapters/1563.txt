Hence, Xia ruofei decided to carve A Doraemon – shaped pendant.

With the help of his spiritual power, Xia ruofei could accurately control the carving knife. In this sense, his carving skills were not inferior to those jade carving Masters. Soon, a lifelike Jade Doraemon was born in his hands.

Xia ruofei put the pendant aside after he was done. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Xia ruofei still needed to practice in order to combine the two array patterns perfectly. Otherwise, the success rate would be too low.

First, he sat cross – legged on the ground with a calm mind. His mind was spinning quickly as he silently deduced the array in his heart.

Now, Xia ruofei’s array Dao cultivation had improved by a huge margin compared to before he entered the underground palace. Naturally, his understanding of array patterns had become more thorough.

Array patterns were constructed in his mind, and every stroke and drawing was filled with endless mystery.

After a long time, Xia ruofei finally opened his eyes. He drew in the air with his finger and lines that could be seen with the naked eye appeared in front of him out of thin air. They were shining with a faint golden light.

Each and every experiment resulted in failure.

However, Xia ruofei was not discouraged. He remained calm and continued to adjust his plan.

Finally, the golden light in front of him flashed slightly, and those seemingly chaotic array patterns seemed to have suddenly combined together. As the light swirled, an aura that calmed one’s mind was emitted.

Xia ruofei was overjoyed. He checked it carefully a few times but did not find any problems.

It was a success! Xia ruofei clenched his fist in excitement.

The next step was to practice continuously and increase his proficiency to increase his success rate!

This was close to a level – three formation and Xia ruofei was not confident.

However, he had no lack of patience. He waved his hand to disperse the array pattern and started to carve again without even taking a breath.

One time, two times, three times ...

Xia ruofei couldn’t even remember how many times he had practiced it. He could feel that his understanding of this self – created formation was getting more and more thorough. He could draw the formation patterns more and more smoothly.

Finally, Xia ruofei reached out and picked up the Doraemon – shaped jade pendant. He first felt it silently and then drank a bottle of spirit Heart Flower petal solution to recover some of his spiritual power.

He then took a deep breath and released his psyche from his body. His fingers quickly drew on the surface of Doraemon’s pendant, and rays of golden light continuously penetrated into the jade pendant, forming complicated and profound array patterns inside the Jade.

It was almost done in one go. Xia ruofei spent less than a minute before he finally heaved a sigh of relief and retracted his spiritual energy.

There was no need to check. The moment the formation was completed, the jade pendant seemed to have an additional spirituality. At the same time, when Xia ruofei held it in his hand, he could feel his heart calm down.

He naturally knew that he had successfully drawn it!

Xia ruofei picked up the jade pendant and left the spirit map space in a flash.

After he returned to the outside world, he kept the array flag and went to the bed to check on Song Wei’s condition.

Song Wei was wearing a thin platinum necklace with a small pendant. Xia ruofei removed the necklace and replaced the pendant with this Doraemon jade pendant. Then, he put it on Song Wei again.

Miraculously, after Song Wei put on the jade pendant, her unconscious expression became much more peaceful. Most importantly, the seductiveness that came from deep within her bones was reduced by a lot. Although she still looked very attractive, at least it did not make men want to commit a crime.

Xia ruofei took a deep breath and took out a bottle of the spirit Heart Flower petal solution from the spirit map space. Then, he helped Song Wei up and carefully fed her the solution. Just now, Xia ruofei’s hand was not light. There was a dark wound on the back of Song Wei’s neck. Moreover, she had been unconscious for so many days. Xia ruofei felt that feeding her another bottle of the petal solution would help her recover.

As Song Wei was not in a deep coma, she would subconsciously swallow the water when Xia ruofei fed her. This saved Xia ruofei a lot of trouble.

At the end, Song Wei even subconsciously stuck out her tongue to lick the bottle’s mouth, which made Xia ruofei’s heart burn with passion.

This peach blossom miasma was really too evil! She had already been suppressed to this extent, but she could still turn a dignified and intelligent beauty into a sexy stunner.

Xia ruofei kept the bottle and the array flag in the medium and looked at Song Wei uneasily.

Under normal circumstances, Song Wei would wake up very quickly after taking the solution.

After Song Wei woke up, Xia ruofei was confused about how to explain to her what had happened.

Besides, Xia ruofei found it hard to talk about Song Wei’s current situation. However, he had to say it. Besides, the two of them had to practice the “Scripture of the primogenitor” together. This involved cultivation and it was not something that could be explained in a few words.

Xia ruofei naturally hoped that Song Wei would wake up soon. At the same time, he was afraid that she would still be in the same state when she was poisoned by the peach blossom miasma. He was very conflicted.

However, no matter how conflicted Xia ruofei was, the wound on the back of Song Wei’s neck disappeared quickly after she drank the solution. Her eyelashes moved a few times and she slowly opened her eyes.

“RUO Fei ...” Song Wei called out weakly.

“Song Wei, you’re finally awake!” Xia ruofei smiled guiltily and said that he was the one who knocked Song Wei out.

“Where is this place?” Song Wei said,”I remember ... I seemed to have woken up once just now. You also told me ... That we’ve already left the underground palace, right?”

Xia ruofei looked a little embarrassed and said,””It’s good that you’re awake ... Don’t think too much. Oh right, Song Wei, how are you feeling?”
