Chapter 3670: Putting on airs as the number one (2)

Chi Qingqing was clearly using her power to oppress others. The world of cultivation was just that realistic. Those with higher cultivation levels deserved to suffer unspeakable pain.

Chi Qingqing glanced at Xia ruofei again and said,””Also, you actually brought an ordinary person with no cultivation to the first heaven society! Sect Master Shen, how many heads do you have to dare to do such a thing? Do you believe that if I were to tell elder Zhou right now, how do you think he would deal with you?”

Chi Qingqing had received some preferential treatment, and Lu Yuqing had dared to be so arrogant in the first heaven society, even though she was only arrogant to the cultivators of a vassal sect. There was another very important reason, and that was that the first heaven society’s early gold core elder, Zhou gan, was more supportive of the luoshen sect. There were rumors that Zhou gan hoped Lu Yuqing and his son would become Dao partners, and it was probably not a groundless rumor.

Chi Qingqing had mentioned elder Zhou intentionally or unintentionally, clearly to strengthen her own momentum.

In fact, although Xia ruofei found this ridiculous, it was more useful to Shen Hu.

After Shen Hu heard Chi Qingqing’s words, he revealed a timid expression.

The thought of backing out came to him, but when he saw Xia ruofei still watching the show with a playful expression, the thought of backing down instantly disappeared.

Shen Hu bit the bullet and said,”sect leader Chi, you don’t have to use elder Zhou to pressure me. You have reason to go around the world. Today’s incident was because Lu Yuqing was arrogant and domineering. My disciple did not do anything wrong, but she was ordered around and insulted by Lu Yuqing! We’re all here to observe the ceremony, so we’re of equal status. I don’t believe that the first heaven society will side with you!”

Chi Qingqing was slightly surprised. With the strength of the luoshen sect, they could easily suppress the water Yuan sect. Her own strength was much stronger than Shen Hu’s. In addition, she also held the banner of elder Zhou, a golden core cultivator. By right, Shen Hu should have given in long ago.

She did not expect Shen Hu to be so stubborn.

However, Chi Qingqing did not take it to heart. The first heaven society didn’t care much about a subsidiary sect like the water element sect. If it wasn’t for the fact that they had been trying to curry favor with elder Zhou, they wouldn’t have received any special treatment.

Therefore, with her relationship with elder Zhou, she could easily turn the water Yuan sect into dust.

As for who was right and who wasn’t… The other higher – ups of the first heaven society wouldn’t care about such trivial matters!

Hence, Chi Qingqing was only slightly taken aback before she sneered and said,””Shen Hu, you really have a backbone! Then let’s wait and see! If I come all the way back to the country to watch the ceremony, and sect leader Chen is driven away by the first heaven society before he can even break through, I’ll be a joke!”

At this point, Chi Qingqing snorted coldly and said,””Yuqing, come with me! Go to your master’s room and cultivate first. Don’t let some wild girl from some small sect disturb your cultivation!”

“Yes! Master!” “Yes,” Lu Yuqing replied immediately. Then, she shot Lu You a provocative look.

Lu You’s mind was in a mess. She realized that she had caused a lot of trouble for Shen Hu and the water element sect. This trouble was so big that even Shen Hu, the sect leader, could not solve it. Moreover, it was very likely that Xia ruofei would be implicated.

Her mind was in a mess, so how could she notice Lu Yuqing’s provocative look?

Chi Qingqing’s cold eyes swept across Shen Hu, Xia ruofei, and Lu You one by one. Then, she left the room with Lu Yuqing without a word.

“Teacher, I’m sorry. I’ve caused you trouble,” Lu You said with a trembling voice.

“I can’t blame you for this. The people of the luoshen sect are too domineering. You’re my in – Name disciple. I can’t just watch you suffer!” Shen Hu said with a bitter smile.

Lu You couldn’t help but shed tears. However, he quickly regained his senses and hurriedly said,””RUO Fei, hurry up and leave! Otherwise, it would be too late! You’ll be in big trouble when the people of the first heaven society blame you!”

Xia ruofei, who had been watching coldly from the side for a long time, finally spoke.””Lu You, you don’t have to worry. I will be fine. Your teacher will be fine too. Just stay here and be at ease!”

After that, Xia ruofei turned to Shen Hu and said,””Sect Master Shen, please take good care of Lu You. I’ll go back first.”

After he finished speaking, Xia ruofei nodded at Lu You and walked out.

Seeing Xia ruofei leave, Lu You heaved a sigh of relief. Although she felt that Xia ruofei would never leave the first heaven society on his own, as long as he was not at the scene and was not caught red – handed by the first heaven society’s law enforcement officers who might arrive at any time, he would have a chance to get away.

As Xia ruofei was walking out, he sent a message to Shen Hu. He said indifferently,””Don’t worry, I’ll let Chen Xuan know. “Also, I haven’t finished speaking. Why don’t you tell Lu You that I’m also a cultivator? even though my cultivation isn’t that high, I’m on good terms with Chen Xuan. That’s why I’ve been officially invited by Chen Xuan to attend the ceremony. This way, she won’t be so worried.”

Shen Hu immediately calmed down when he heard this. He quickly sent a message,”Very well, senior Xia. Don’t worry, I’ll take good care of Lu You. Even if Chi Qingqing were to fight me personally, she wouldn’t be able to defeat me in a short time. After all, we’re both at the ninth level of the aura refining realm. Besides, they won’t dare to make a move in the territory of the first heaven society.”

“That’s good!” Xia ruofei transmitted his voice.

Then, without saying anything else, he walked out of the courtyard and headed towards the courtyard where he lived.

Xia ruofei had just reached the entrance of his residence when he saw Chen Xuan walking over from a distance. Behind him were three service disciples carrying food boxes and wine jars.

Chen Xuan waved at Xia ruofei from afar and shouted,””Brother RUO Fei! I’ve taken out all the good wine I’ve kept for many years, so you have to drink a few glasses with me!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Let’s talk about drinking later. I have something to tell you.”

Chen Xuan was stunned for a moment, but he quickly replied,””Alright! Let’s talk inside!”

Xia ruofei and Chen Xuan entered the courtyard, and the three disciples quickly went to the dining room in The West Wing. They opened the lunchbox and placed the delicious food on the table.

Chen Xuan waved his hand at the three servant disciples, and they immediately bowed slightly before silently retreating.

Chen Xuan then turned to Xia ruofei and asked,””Brother ruofei, if you have anything to say, you can say it now.”

Xia ruofei told her about his encounter with Lu You and what happened after that. The main point was, of course, how the luoshen sect’s chi Qingqing and Lu Yuqing had bullied Lu You.

Xia ruofei did not exaggerate anything. With his current status, it would be a piece of cake for him to punish Chi Qingqing and Lu Yuqing. Why would he need to deliberately exaggerate the facts?

After hearing this, Chen Xuan could not help but reveal a look of anger.””A Qi condensation cultivator dares to be so arrogant in the heavenly sect? Brother RUO Fei, did she say which elder Zhou She was referring to?”

Among the Golden core elders of the first heaven society, there was another elder with the surname Zhou. This was why Chen Xuan had asked this question.

However, before Xia ruofei could say anything, Chen Xuan waved his hand and said,””Who cares which elder Zhou He is! How can we not punish this kind of person who bullies the weak under the name of the first heaven society’s elder?”

“Then I’ll have to trouble brother Chen.” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“What are you saying?” Chen Xuan replied,”the fact that you didn’t do it yourself is already giving me face! If I didn’t handle this matter well, would 1 still have the face to see you?”

“Brother ruofei, this is my fault. I didn’t pay attention to whether your friend came with Shen Hu. If I had known that your friend was here, I would have asked the disciples who were in charge of accommodation to take care of him.”

“Brother Chen, you’re being too serious. You’ve been busy these few days. How can you personally worry about such a trivial matter?” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Leave this to me!” Chen Xuan replied,”brother ruofei, please wait for a moment.. I’ll make some arrangements and be back!”
