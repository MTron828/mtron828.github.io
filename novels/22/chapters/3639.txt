Chapter 3640: Heading straight to Sydney (1)

Translator: 549690339

Tang Haoran’s summer vacation was about to end.

He had been cultivating on the Peach Blossom Island for more than a month and was extremely close to breaking through to refined Qi level 9.

Although Song Wei and Ling Qingxue had both broken through a layer of cultivation, and Tang Haoran had not been able to break through to the ninth Qi layer after taking the Vermillion Jade Fruit, the more one cultivated, the more difficult it was to break through. The bottleneck between the eighth and ninth Qi layer was an order of magnitude difference.

Therefore, Tang Haoran’s cultivation progress was not any slower than Song Wei and Ling Qingxue.

If Tang Haoran could stay on the Peach Blossom Island for a while longer, he would definitely have no problem breaking through to refined Qi level 9.

However, he was about to start school soon. Xia ruofei’s point of view was that Tang Haoran should still receive a normal education at his age. The speed of his cultivation was not that important.

Hence, even though Tang Haoran was about to break through, Xia ruofei decided to take him back to Sydney first.

Tang Haoran did not lack cultivation resources anyway, so he could continue cultivating in Sydney. However, the environment there was definitely not as good as Paradise Island, so his cultivation speed would slow down a bit. Other than that, there was no other effect.

Li Yifu, whose cultivation had completely stabilized at the early golden core stage, continued to guard the Peach Blossom Island.

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue saw that Tang Haoran had advanced so quickly, so they also made up their minds to cultivate hard. Therefore, they would not leave in the short term and would stay here to cultivate.

Xia ruofei, Zheng Yongshou, and Tang Haoran embarked on the journey to Sydney.

On the rooftop of the Yanhuang building, Xia ruofei and the other two stood on the deck of the black Phoenix flying ship, waving goodbye to Song Wei and the others.

The black Phoenix flying ship then streaked through the air in a beautiful arc, accelerating to its maximum speed in an instant before turning into a streak of light and disappearing from everyone’s sight.

After more than an hour, Xia ruofei controlled the black Phoenix flying ship and slowly landed near Tang Yitian’s Manor.

When the three of them arrived at the entrance of the manor, Jennifer and Tang Yitian, who had received the news, were already waiting there.

When Jennifer saw Tang Haoran, she could not help but call out,””Haoran! You’re back!”

“Dad! Mother!” It was also Tang Haoran’s first time being away from his parents for so long, so when he saw Tang Yitian and Jennifer, he also cheered and jumped into Jennifer’s arms.

Jennifer hugged Tang Haoran and said,””Let mom take a good look! My son seems to have grown taller!”

Tang Yitian, Xia ruofei, and Zheng Yongshou greeted each other. The last time Zheng Yongshou transported oak to Australia, Tang Yitian had specially met him, so the two knew each other.

Hearing Jennifer’s words, Tang Yitian didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.”My dear, our son has only left home for a month. How could he have grown so tall all of a sudden?”

“Who said that?” Jennifer said,”I think he has grown a lot taller! Haoran, tell mom, how tall are you now?”

“1.5 meters!” Tang Haoran said proudly.

“I knew it!” Jennifer naturally knew her son’s height and weight well.”You’ve grown ten centimeters taller!”

“Ah?” Tang Yitian wasn’t as attentive as Jennifer, so he didn’t know Tang Haoran’s original height. He couldn’t help but be dumbfounded when he heard that.”You really grew taller?”

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”Haoran has been cultivating very hard and has had a breakthrough in his cultivation. It’s normal for him to grow taller!” Besides, he’s still growing, so it’s not strange for him to be 10 cm taller in a month.”

After taking the Vermillion Jade Fruit, Tang Haoran’s cultivation had broken through several levels in succession. While his true energy was forging his body, he had also grown taller. Xia ruofei was very clear about this.

“Cultivation actually has such an effect…” Tang Yitian was very envious.

Although Tang Yitian was a formidable man, he wasn’t very tall because of genetic factors, only about 1.72 meters. This was an ordinary height for Chinese men, but in the Australian society, which was dominated by white people, this height was a little short, and he would look a little weaker when he walked out.

“Brother Tang, you’ve already stopped growing at your age …” Xia ruofei did not know whether to laugh or cry.

Jennifer also laughed hysterically when she heard that.

“I’m just happy for our son!”Tang Yitian said awkwardly. Don’t just stand here, let’s go in and chat while making tea!”

Tang Yitian’s Manor was very large, so they all got on the electric car and quickly drove to the main building inside the manor. After a while, everyone had already arrived at the house and took their seats in the spacious living room on the first floor.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”big brother Tang, 1 returned Haoran to you unscathed!” You guys don’t have to worry anymore, right?” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“I’ve never been worried about leaving the child in your care!” Tang Yitian smiled.’Tt’s just that his mother misses her son a little, and she often Nags in my ear. She can’t stand it…”

“You’re speaking as if you don’t miss your son at all!” Jennifer couldn’t help but glance at Tang Yitian and then at Xia ruofei. She asked with a smile,”ruofei, did Haoran cause you any trouble?”

“Why would 1? Although Haoran is young, he’s very independent. He can eat, shower, and sleep on his own. We don’t have to worry about him!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I don’t know how you guys taught him.. He should be a pampered young master, but he’s like a poor kid who takes care of things early!”
