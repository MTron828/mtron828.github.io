“Your subordinate wouldn’t dare, but…” Zheng Yongshou lowered his head.

Xia ruofei interrupted Zheng Yongshou’s words and said,””Since you don’t dare, then keep it! Also, even though you’re only following my orders because of the soul seal, I’ve never, nor am 1 used to treating people as servants. So in my eyes, you’re just an ordinary subordinate. You don’t have to be so careful in front of me. As long as you’re loyal, you’ll definitely have a better future than when you were cultivating in the heart excising sect!”

Zheng Yongshou was so touched that tears welled up in his eyes. He said in a trembling voice,””Master, please rest assured. This subordinate is willing to bow and die for master!” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Although Zheng Yongshou was loyal to Xia ruofei because of the soul seal, the soul seal would not make a person lose his mind. In fact, both Zheng Yongshou and Luo Qingfeng were normal cultivators who could think independently. It was just that when they faced Xia ruofei, they could not help but have the thoughts of obedience and worship. Thus, Zheng Yongshou could naturally tell good from bad, and he could see that Xia ruofei did not treat him as a slave.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”alright, just call me Mr. Xia from now on.” You have to make it a habit, or else you might call me by the wrong name in front of others!”

“Yes! Mr. Xia!” Zheng Yongshou quickly said.

Xia ruofei threw the key to the warehouse to Zheng Yongshou and said,””I’ll leave the key to you in the future! I wouldn’t have come here if there wasn’t anything important.”

“Understood!” Zheng Yongshou said.

The task that Xia ruofei gave him was not complicated. If he did not have to adapt to the life in the secular world, it would be easy for him. It was such a simple task, but Xia ruofei was still considerate of him. He allowed him to cultivate on the Peach Blossom Island and even gave him precious spiritual crystals. He was very touched.

Xia ruofei continued.”Oh, right. When you store and retrieve items from the storage ring in the warehouse, you must be careful to avoid people’s eyes and ears. After all, if people from the secular world accidentally see you, it will be a bit shocking.”

“Your subordinate will take note!” Zheng Yongshou said.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”alright!” Next,i’ll take you to the Peach Blossom Farm. It’s getting dark, so it’ll be more convenient!”

The two of them went out together, and Zheng Yongshou deftly locked the warehouse door. Xia ruofei sat in the driver’s seat, and Zheng Yongshou hurriedly climbed into the car as well. His movements were a little clumsy, and he was still a little unaccustomed to these modern vehicles.

Xia ruofei started the car and looked at Zheng Yongshou. He smiled and said,”After you’ve settled down here, let Zheng Yi arrange for you to learn how to drive and get a driver’s license. It’ll be much more convenient for you in the future. After all, you often have to come to the warehouse alone.”

“Okay, Mr. Xia, I’ll tell President Zheng when i get back and try to get the car as soon as possible …” Zheng Yongshou said.

“A driver’s license, it’s a driving license!” Xia ruofei said,”you can only drive on the road legally if you have a driving license!”

Xia ruofei believed that with the intelligence of cultivators, it would be very easy for Zheng Yongshou to learn how to drive. After learning the basic operations, he would be able to drive very quickly. After all, the reaction speed of cultivators was much faster than ordinary people. However, Xia ruofei still hoped that Zheng Yongshou could follow the normal path to learn how to drive and get a driver’s license. He had to make Zheng Yongshou learn to abide by the laws and rules of modern society under the subtle influence of his teaching.

Zheng Yongshou naturally would not compromise Xia ruofei’s orders. He nodded and said,””I understand. Don’t worry, Mr. Xia. i’ll definitely follow the rules of the secular world and won’t act recklessly.”

Xia ruofei nodded and said seriously,””Mm! This is very important. Once I find out that you’re doing evil in the secular world, i’ll cripple you without hesitation! You Must Remember This!”

When Xia ruofei said this, he added a trace of spiritual power of the spiritualization realm. In addition to the suppressing effect of the soul seal, Zheng Yongshou couldn’t help but tremble. Instantly, an unforgettable seal formed in his mind. He quickly said,”Yes! This subordinate will definitely remember your order! I won’t dare to disobey!”

Xia ruofei was well aware that if a cultivator was not bound, he could cause a lot of destruction in the secular world, especially when Zheng Yongshou was dealing with people from the Paradise Corporation. So he had to give a heads up in advance. Otherwise, if something really happened, it would be too late for regrets.

Xia ruofei was very satisfied with Zheng Yongshou’s attitude. He started the car and drove in the direction of the expressway.

At this time, the sky was gradually getting dark, and San Shan city had entered the rush hour, so the car was moving very slowly on the ring road. However, Xia ruofei was not in a hurry. He slowly drove the Knight XV in the traffic and only picked up speed when they entered the expressway around the city.

About half an hour later, Xia ruofei had entered the borders of Changping County.

He drove in the direction of Taoyuan farm with ease, but he didn’t drive directly into the farm. Instead, he found a quiet place two or three kilometers away from the farm and parked the car.

“Get out of the car!” Xia ruofei turned off the engine and said as he opened the door,”I don’t want to alert the farm people.. I’ll bring you there on my sword!”
