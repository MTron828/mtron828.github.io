2361 Capturing the Golden Fox (2)

In a short while, his figure had already appeared on the other side of the training ground.

Xia ruofei’s spiritual power was constantly dispersed as he continued to survey his surroundings.

Just as he passed through the tactical training ground, a team of mobile sentries also came from not far away.

When the patrol team was about to turn, Xia ruofei had already detected their presence with his spiritual power. He sped up without thinking and hid behind a building just before the patrol team turned.

What happened next was simple.

There were several buildings next to each other, and the moonlight was not very good that night, so the visibility was quite low. He used the street lights and the shadows of the buildings to quietly sneak behind the three – story building.

Xia ruofei found a half – Open aluminum window. He pushed it open gently and jumped into the three – story building.

Before he came in, he had used his mental power to investigate. This should be an instructor’s dormitory. The place he entered was a public living room, and there were rooms on the left and right sides of the living room. In each room, there was a person lying on the bed, sleeping soundly.

Xia ruofei did not alert the people in the instructor’s dormitory. The main target he was looking for was the person in charge of the training camp,”Golden Fox”

According to pardu and the others, Golden Fox spent most of his time on the third floor of the small building. There was about half a floor there, which was where Golden Fox worked and rested.

Xia ruofei carefully avoided the surveillance cameras as he ran up the stairs quietly.

He didn’t stop at all. He only stopped when he found a Sentry at the entrance of the third floor. He knocked him out with a punch and then threw him into the space cage of the spirit map world.

Xia ruofei had set up a very large space cage in advance. It was foolproof to use this kind of cage to imprison ordinary people.

Moreover, he didn’t need to worry about the captives waking up or tying them up. As long as he threw them into the space cage, he wouldn’t have to worry about them escaping.

This way, Xia ruofei’s efficiency had increased a lot.

Of course, before throwing the captives into the spirit map world’s space cage, Xia ruofei would also take the opportunity to find all the poison and weapons they had hidden. After all, if the captives were to carry guns with them, it was likely that there would be bloodshed if a conflict occurred between the captives in the space cage.

Xia ruofei had finally managed to gather a batch of free labor. Naturally, he was not willing to suffer any losses because of this place.

There were even sentries at the stairs, which meant that Golden Fox was most likely living there. Otherwise, the security would not be so tight.

Xia ruofei arrived at the third floor and immediately used his spiritual power to investigate.

Sure enough, he found a white man in his forties sleeping soundly in a big room on the east side of the small building.

“He is the Golden Fox?” Xia ruofei mumbled to himself.

Very quickly, Xia ruofei realized that something was not right. He increased the intensity of his spiritual power again and investigated the big room on the east side.

That room was adjacent to a large office. The office and the bedroom were connected. Xia ruofei scanned the area inch by inch with his spiritual power and quickly found the abnormality. There was actually a hidden room between the office and the bedroom.

This room ingeniously made use of the visual perception illusion, as well as the ingenious design of the house’s structure, so that ordinary people really wouldn’t be able to sense that there was another room in that position.

The four walls, the floor, and the ceiling of the room were all covered with copper plates, which could shield them from electromagnetic devices to a large extent.

Xia ruofei’s spiritual power had a weak penetration ability against solid objects, especially metal objects. This was why he did not discover the secret chamber immediately.

Just as Xia ruofei felt that something was wrong, he increased his strength and scanned the room inch by inch. The secret room was finally revealed.

Xia ruofei’s spiritual power sensed that there was another bed in the secret room. A white man in his forties was sleeping on the bed. This man’s body shape was almost the same as the one on the bed outside. Even his appearance was similar.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and understood.

Needless to say, the one sleeping in the bedroom outside must be the substitute of the white man in the secret chamber.

Xia ruofei felt that he was already very cautious, but he still admired this Caucasian man who was likely to be Golden Fox.

It must be known that in such a heavily guarded military camp, the possibility of an enemy sneaking in was extremely low.

However, this white man still arranged for a substitute to sleep in his bed, while he himself would rather sleep in a small bedroom. It could be seen how cautious he was.

Xia ruofei guessed that if he were to attack the substitute on the bed, the main body in the secret chamber would be the first to notice.

After all, the substitute’s role was obvious. Other than blocking the first wave of attacks for him, its greater role was probably to warn him.

Xia ruofei grabbed the doorknob and released his true energy. The lock immediately broke without a sound. He easily pushed the door open and walked in.

When he entered the door, Xia ruofei casually lifted his foot and stepped over a thin line. This little warning technique could not be hidden from his spiritual power.

He did not walk towards the bed in the bedroom. Instead, he raised his hand and shot a small stone. The substitute who was sleeping soundly on the bed did not react at all in his sleep. His body trembled slightly and he fainted.

Xia ruofei, on the other hand, walked to the wardrobe in the bedroom with interest and scanned it with his spiritual power. It was very likely to be the entrance to the secret room.

Of course, there was another entrance on the other side of the office.

It was also because of this that if someone really broke in and attacked the substitute on the bed outside, the original body in the secret room would be able to detect it at the first moment and escape from the other entrance.

Xia ruofei moved closer to observe and used his spiritual power to penetrate it bit by bit.

He quickly realized that there was indeed an entrance behind the wardrobe, but the white man had locked it from the inside. No matter which way he opened the door, it would definitely wake the person in the secret room.

Since that was the case, Xia ruofei might as well go all out. He reached out and grabbed the edge of the wardrobe. Then, he exerted force and exhaled his genuine Qi.

Suddenly, the wardrobe was pushed two to three meters to the side, and a secret room about one meter wide appeared in front of Xia ruofei.

Although Xia ruofei used a lot of force, it did not cause much of a stir.

However, the white man in the secret room must have had an early warning system. Almost at the same time the wardrobe was pushed open, he woke up and jumped up from the bed. The gun in his hand was pointed at the opening.

This guy was really cautious. Not only did he arrange for a substitute to cover up his tracks, but he also slept in the secret chamber. He even had his gun in his hand when he slept, and he could shoot directly if there was a situation.

Unfortunately, his opponent was Xia ruofei, so he did not have the chance to shoot.

The white man only saw a black shadow flash in front of his eyes. He subconsciously pulled the trigger, but to his horror, he found that he couldn’t pull it. No matter how hard he pulled, the trigger wouldn’t move.

In the time it took for him to be stunned, the black shadow had already arrived in front of him.

The white man’s reaction was also considered fast. He directly used the pistol that could not be fired as a cold weapon and raised his hand to smash the person who broke into the secret chamber.

However, he once again felt his vision blur, and immediately lost track of his opponent.

Immediately after, the white man felt a strong wind passing through the back of his neck. Before he could react, he felt a sharp pain. His vision suddenly turned black, and he fell to the ground involuntarily ...
