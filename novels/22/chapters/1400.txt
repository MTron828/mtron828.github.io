Chapter 1401: The sound of applause (1)

Translator: 549690339

A faint piece of music started playing, and at the same time, there was a slightly low female voice – over.

“They’re called the children of the stars ...”

“They are like the stars in the sky, shining alone in the distant and dark night sky ...”

“They are as beautiful and pure as the stars, but they are also as cold and lonely as the stars ...”

The opening three lines immediately drew everyone’s attention. The screen was still dark, but there were lines of white subtitles.

Immediately after, the screen flashed, and handsome and beautiful faces began to appear. From the screen, it was impossible to tell that these children were any different from normal children, but if one looked closely, they would find that they were all avoiding the camera. Almost no one was looking directly at the camera.

The voice – over also became deeper.”In China, on average, one in every 100 newborns will be diagnosed with autism. Each child will affect three to four families and six to eight people. Prior to this, the cause of autism has yet to be determined, and there are no effective drugs for the treatment of autism. ”

The faces of parents under great pressure appeared on the screen, and in the corner of the screen, there were often children playing with their toys, completely immersed in their own world, and turning a blind eye to the camera lens.

The reporters in the venue were silent. Even the reporters who were adjusting the machines and communicating with each other stopped and looked at the scenes flashing on the big screen.

In the past few years, autism had become a mental illness that everyone was more and more concerned about. Everyone had a better understanding of this illness and had a deeper understanding of the suffering that families with autistic children had to endure.

Some of the reporters who had some understanding of the heart nourishing soup couldn’t help but secretly praise it in their hearts. This was really an amazing achievement.

The film was very short, less than three minutes, and it only introduced the situation of autism as well as the current research situation around the world.

The film ended with this sentence: These children who lived on the stars looked at earth from afar, but they couldn’t receive the signal from earth ...

After the short video ended, Xue Jinshan walked back to the stage from the side, and the spotlights switched back on to follow his footsteps.

He reached out to arrange the microphone, then smiled and said,””I’m sure everyone has guessed it. Some of the more well – informed reporters have already gotten more detailed information ...”

Xue Jinshan’s words caused a wave of friendly laughter from the reporters below the stage. Even more reporters who were unclear of the situation were busy asking their peers around.

Since the news would be announced at the press conference soon, it wasn’t exclusive news, so the reporters who knew the news didn’t hide it. They all revealed what they knew.

However, Xue Jinshan quickly pulled everyone’s attention back to him.

He went straight to the point and said,”that’s right, the first new drug that our Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory is releasing is related to autism.” To be precise, this Chinese medicine is currently the only medicine in the world that can effectively treat autism!”

The reporters who were still trying to get information all turned their heads to look at Xue Jinshan in unison. Some of the more impatient ones even stood up to ask questions.

However, Xue Jinshan waved his hand and said,”there will be a Q & A session later. Please allow me to first introduce our Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory’s brand new special medicine for autism, the Kongtong heart – nourishing soup!”

As soon as Xue Jinshan finished speaking, a picture of the newly packaged heart – nourishing soup appeared on the big screen behind him.

“This is a pure Chinese medicine Medicine. It was created after a long period of arduous research by the research team of paradise Corporation. They looked through countless Chinese medicine classics and went through layers of approval, animal experiments, clinical trials, and other procedures before it was finally approved to be on the market ...”

Xue Jinshan spoke with fervor and assurance on the stage. Xia ruofei also looked at him with a gratified smile.

The press conference was indeed standard. There were no celebrities, no beautiful PowerPoint, and even the venue layout was passable. However, the meat of the bun was not in the folds. Xia ruofei was very satisfied with the content of the press conference.

Except for the short video at the beginning that stirred up everyone’s emotions, the rest of the press conference was basically following the rules. Xue Jinshan introduced the research and development process of the heart nourishing soup, which, of course, had been modified. He couldn’t possibly say that this was the work of the chairman of paradise Corporation, Xia ruofei, alone, right?

Then, he also focused on some data from the clinical trials of the heart – nourishing soup, including the first few children with autism who participated in the heart – nourishing soup trials. From the time they took the medicine until now, the whole process had been followed and recorded, so the information was very complete.

Even without the need for professionals, just from the small number of videos disclosed at the press conference, everyone could see that the children’s symptoms had improved significantly after taking the heart – nourishing soup for a few courses.

The reporters were getting more and more excited.

The treatment of autism was a world – wide problem.

The developed countries in Europe and the United States had not made any breakthrough in the study of the pathogenic mechanism of this disease. The treatment had always been based on behavior correction, and no effective drugs had been found at all.
