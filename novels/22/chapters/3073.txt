3074  The number one sect (2)

  Looking at their clothes, one could tell that they were just ordinary disciples who guarded the water flying boat, the two disciples bowed slightly and called out in unison,""Greetings, young sect leader!"

  Chen Xuan smiled gently at the two of them and nodded. Then, he turned to Xia ruofei and said,""Brother Xia, this is the mountain Gate of the first heaven society. The three words on the mountain Gate were written by my father, the great ancestor."

  Xia ruofei looked closely and realized that the three words "first heaven society" were also majestic. When he looked at it, he could hear the sound of metal clashing. These three simple words were like three angry gods, releasing an overbearing aura at the same time.

  Xia ruofei's body was slightly stunned by the overwhelming aura.

  When Chen Xuan saw Xia ruofei staring at the three words, he quickly reminded him,""Brother Xia, please don't stare ..."

  However, his warning was too late. Xia ruofei had already focused his attention.

  Chen Xuan couldn't help but feel regret. He knew that the words 'great - grandfather' contained an overbearing aura. If an ordinary cultivator didn't pay attention to it, it would be fine. However, if they paid attention to it, they would probably be crushed by the aura.

  Back when Chen Xuan was still a Qi condensation cultivator, he had been forced to take six or seven steps back by these words before falling to the ground.

  In fact, Chen Xuan was just giving Xia ruofei a normal introduction. He did not expect Xia ruofei to be so honest and take the three words seriously.

  If Xia ruofei were to make such a fool of himself at the entrance before he even entered the mountain, Chen Xuan would really be embarrassed as the host.

  If Xia ruofei was a little more narrow - minded, he might even think that Chen Xuan was deliberately toying with him to give him a chance to show off his power!

  Chen Xuan could not help but feel anxious.

  What he did not expect was that Xia ruofei's footsteps only paused for a moment. There was almost no change in her expression. She was only stunned for a moment, then she smiled and said,""Brother Chen, the three words on your sect's Gate are extraordinary! It's full of power! I was caught off guard just now and almost suffered a loss!" Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

  Chen Xuan looked at Xia ruofei in shock. At the same time, he heaved a sigh of relief.

  He didn't have the time to think about how Xia ruofei was able to get out of that power so quickly and was completely fine.

  As long as Xia ruofei did not make a fool of himself here, he would be thankful.

  "Brother Xia, I didn't explain myself clearly just now. I almost caused you to lose out. I'm really sorry!" Chen Xuan hurriedly apologized.

  "Brother Chen, you're too serious." Xia ruofei chuckled and said,"brother Chen has already reminded me in time. If there's anyone to blame, it's my curiosity. Fortunately, nothing happened!"

  "Yes, yes, yes!" "Please come in, brother Xia!" Chen Xuan said, gesturing for him to enter.

  As Chen Xuan brought Xia ruofei into the sect, he muttered to himself,"It was said that this brother Xia was likely to be a Yuanying stage cultivator's personal disciple. It seemed that the credibility of this rumor was quite high. At such a young age, he could be as steady as Mount Tai in front of his ancestor's inscription. The foundation of a Yuanying stage personal disciple was really not ordinary!

  This was Chen Xuan's first time trying to comprehend these three words. In the end, he was immediately suppressed by the aura, causing him to take a few steps back and fall on his butt. At that time, he was about the same age as Xia ruofei.

  This was why Chen Xuan was feeling especially emotional.

  Chen Xuan personally led Xia ruofei around the sect. At the same time, he introduced Xia ruofei to the various buildings they passed by. A series of ancient buildings were built against the mountain, scattered in an orderly manner within a radius of several dozen li. It was clear that this entire area was enveloped in a large array. Everything within the array's range couldn't even be detected by the satellites in space. In the photos taken by the Pi Xiu reconnaissance satellite, this was a primeval forest.

  That was actually an illusion created by the formation. The real situation had long been concealed.

  The spiritual Qi in the entire area was very rich. Xia ruofei sensed that it was almost at the same level as the Taixu xuanqing formation before the second transformation.

  Near the mountain Gate, there were a few disciples wearing white Crescent - shaped clothes. They looked full of energy and were at least at refined Qi Level 5 and above.

  Looking at their clothes, one could tell that they were just ordinary disciples who guarded the mountain Gate.

  The number one sect in the world of cultivation was indeed worthy of its reputation. Just a glimpse of the gate gave Xia ruofei a feeling of myriad of phenomena and magnificence.

  The Clearwater flying boat was very recognizable. Therefore, the moment it landed in front of the mountain Gate, the disciples who were guarding the gate hurriedly came out to greet it.

  "Brother Xia, we've arrived!" Chen Xuan walked out of the cabin and smiled."Let's go down!"

  "Alright!" Xia ruofei said,"please, brother Chen!"

  The two of them jumped off the flying boat together. Just as Chen Xuan kept the shrunken green   "Yes, yes, yes!" "Please come in, brother Xia!" Chen Xuan said, gesturing for him to enter.
