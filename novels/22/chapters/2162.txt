Xia ruofei laughed and said,”sure!” Then I’ll leave this matter to you. Do we have the medicinal herbs you need in our space? If you want to buy it, you’ll have to wait for a while. ”

“These are all commonly used medicinal herbs. The ones planted in the spirit map world are enough!” Xia Qing said with a smile.

“Then I’ll leave it to you to handle!” Xia ruofei said,”and this snake skin, snake meat, if you think it’s useful, you can deal with it. I’ll find time to throw out the rest!”

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing said respectfully.

Xia ruofei checked on the white fox’s condition and realized that it seemed to be in a deep sleep. What was even more amazing was that a Milky – White aura had started to appear around its body. The aura was getting thicker and thicker, almost enveloping it completely. From a distance, it looked like a white cocoon.

Xia ruofei guessed that the White realmfox had reached a critical point and might be on the verge of a breakthrough or evolution. He could easily detect the White realmfox’s condition. Although it was motionless, it was full of vitality. Hence, he was not too worried.

After greeting Xia Qing, Xia ruofei returned to the outside world in a flash.

After all this, the sky was already starting to brighten.

Xia ruofei walked to the boundary of the array and skillfully inserted his vital energy to open the boundary. Then, he flashed out of the array.

Soon, the barrier returned to normal. Xia ruofei checked it and picked up the backpack that he had left in the bushes last night. He then left the pool.

When they left the Azure immortal abode, the stone door had been completely closed by Xia ruofei. Other than the wooden token that he had with him, which he could still enter, even if other cultivators happened to come to the immortal Island and even broke the array boundary beside the pool, they would basically not be able to discover that there was an immortal abode so deep underground.

Xia ruofei was carrying a huge backpack as he sped through the forest.

Along the way, he could see that many trees had fallen, which showed how destructive the purple blood spirit Python had been last night.

However, this was also convenient for Xia ruofei. He did not need to identify the direction. He just had to follow the destroyed area and soon, he arrived at the cliff.

Last night, he had hidden in the spirit map space the moment he jumped off the cliff. That was how he had escaped the purpleblood spirit Python’s pursuit. However, the survivors ‘camp at the bottom of the cliff had suffered.

Xia ruofei stood on the cliff and could clearly see that the campsite had become a raggle. All the houses had collapsed and there were blood splatters everywhere.

He couldn’t help but sigh. Although he didn’t kill these survivors, it was undeniable that if he hadn’t broken into this immortal Island, those survivors might not have been able to leave for their entire lives, but they basically wouldn’t have encountered such a disaster.

Xia ruofei did not look for a way out. Instead, he jumped down from the cliff. As he was falling, he tapped on the protruding parts of the cliff and landed on the ground lightly. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

He used his spiritual power to scan the area, and his heart sank. There was no sign of life in the surroundings.

Could it be that the survivors were all wiped out?

It was highly possible. After all, the strongest person among the survivors was Puyol. However, even Puyol could not resist Xia ruofei. When faced with the purple – blooded spiritual Python, Puyol was no different from the other survivors.

The only difference was that he was a little faster at escaping.

However, this was an Island, where could he escape to?

As long as the purple blood spirit Python was willing, even if Puyol escaped into the sea, he would still be unable to escape death. In the sea, their speed was not as fast as the purple blood spirit Python.

Xia ruofei still had a glimmer of hope. He followed the direction of the destruction caused by the purpleblood spirit Python and searched.

After passing through the forest, the beach was in front.

It seemed like Puyol and the rest had fled towards the sea as soon as they could last night.

Xia ruofei quickly walked out of the forest and saw Puyol and the rest shivering on the beach.

Including Puyol and the child in his arms, there were only four or five people who survived. Other than the child, the rest were men with stronger bodies.

“Puyol!” Xia ruofei shouted.

Puyol raised his head suddenly. When he saw Xia ruofei, his eyes were filled with disbelief. After a while, he shouted with his eyes wide open,””Daoist immortal! You ... You’re still alive ...”

Xia ruofei walked in front of them with a serious expression and said in a low voice,””I’m really sorry about last night ... I didn’t expect that Python to escape ...”

Puyol revealed a sorrowful expression and said,””Dead ... So many people are dead...Even John’s mom, Linda, is dead...I saw that Boa breaking Linda’s body with one bite and swallowing it ...”

Puyol’s words made the remaining 3 survivors recall the hellish scene from last night, and their eyes revealed an expression of extreme fear.

Xia ruofei sighed and said,”it’s okay ... It’s all in the past!” I’ve already killed that Python!”

“What? Is this for real?” Puyol cried out in surprise.

“Of course!” Xia ruofei said,”you don’t have to doubt that. From now on, you don’t have to worry about your safety on the island.”

“Thank you ... Thank you!” Puyol said. Then, the expression on his face turned a little gloomy as he said,”but it’s hard for us to survive ...”

They had been able to live on the island for so many years because of the formation of a small society. Everyone had their own duties and division of labor. Everyone worked hard to survive under Puyol’s leadership. Now that so many people had died, there were only four or five survivors left, and there was a child who was crying for food. Survival had become a big problem.

“Don’t worry, I’ll find a way to get you guys out!”Xia ruofei said.

The eyes of Puyol and the other three survivors lit up. All these years, they had been dreaming of leaving this deserted island and returning to human society. However, Xia ruofei’s nonchalant words made them feel that it was not real.

Perhaps the surprise came too suddenly.

“Really? Can I really go back?” One of the survivors muttered.

“Of course!” Xia ruofei said,”I brought internet and GPS devices with me. However, for some reason, the signal is blocked on this Island. We just need to build a strong enough wooden raft and get as far away from this Island as possible. When we get a signal, we can ask for help!”

With an accurate location and the ability to connect to the internet to call for help, the probability of being rescued was still very high.

The survivors, including Puyol, were all in tears.

“I thought I would never see my mother again ...” One of the survivors murmured,”and my dear Jessica, she must have thought I had lost my life at sea ...”

“Wuwuwu ... I can finally go back ...”

“Little John, daddy will be able to bring you home soon ...” Pyol was also very excited.

Xia ruofei looked at them and said,””Alright, alright, let’s wait until we’re really rescued before we get excited! The most important thing now is to build a big and strong enough raft. Otherwise, if you fall apart in the wind and waves before being rescued, none of you will be able to go home!”

“Yes, yes, yes!” “Lord Divine immortal, let’s go and cut down the trees now!”

“Wait!” Xia ruofei called out. He looked at the child in Puyol’s arms and said,”Puyol, your child doesn’t seem right ...”

The child’s face was red and his body was trembling. Xia ruofei reached out and touched his forehead but immediately retracted his hand.””The child is running a high fever! Let’s quickly bring down his fever! Let’s not worry about the raft for now!”
