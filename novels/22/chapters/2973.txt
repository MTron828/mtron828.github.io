“Sect leader Shao,” Luo Qingfeng said seriously.”It’s best if fewer people know about my visit to you ...”

Seeing how serious Luo Qingfeng was, Shao Qingyang put away his joking expression and nodded. Then, he led Luo Qingfeng to a room not far away.

“Can you tell me now, sect master Luo?” asked Shao Qingyang. This room has already been set up with several kinds of barriers in advance, so there’s absolutely no need to worry about the problem of the walls having ears!”

“Yes.” Luo Qingfeng nodded and said,”sect leader Shao, I’ll be honest with you. I’ve come to find you again to submit an item for auction at the last minute.”

Hearing that, Shao Qingyang couldn’t help but let out a sigh of relief. He smiled and said,””That’s a good thing. We welcome you! Sect leader Luo, aren’t you being too cautious? Could it be that it’s an extremely precious treasure, and you don’t want people to know that you submitted it for auction? Sect leader Luo can rest assured on this point. Since our fallen leaves sect is hosting this auction, we will definitely abide by the rules of the industry and will definitely not disclose the information of the client. ”

Luo Qingfeng sneered in his heart. Every auction said the same thing, but no matter which sect was the host, it was impossible to completely prevent the news from leaking out. After all, they were not a professional auction house. How could the confidentiality of the news not be leaked? What’s more, as long as the other party’s background was big enough, the higher – ups of the fallen leaves sect didn’t even need to threaten them. They would fight to provide the information that the other party needed.

Although he was secretly complaining, Luo Qingfeng naturally would not say it out loud. He just smiled and said,””I naturally trust you, sect leader Shao. However, the auction item provided this time is no small matter. I have no choice but to be careful!”

As Luo Qingfeng spoke, he did not forget to pay attention to the situation at the auction house. He was also worried that the speed of the transaction was so fast that even the remnant scroll of the spirit Vulture mountain was on the stage. If that happened, it would be too late to say anything.

Hearing this, Shao Qingyang’s eyes lit up, and he said with great interest,””Sect leader Luo, please elaborate!”

“We want to submit the first and second volumes of the glittering jewel Wonderland,” Luo Qingfeng said indifferently.”We only have one request, and that is to auction it before the remnant volume of the spirit Vulture mountain.”

Shao Qingyang couldn’t help but take a deep breath. His eyes were wide open, and he stared at Luo Qingfeng for a long time before he said with a bitter smile,””Sect leader Luo, you’ve really shocked the world with one brilliant move! The items that your sect has submitted for auction this time are truly more frightening than the previous one!”

“Sect leader Shao, the remnant scroll of the Vulture mountain will be auctioned soon. You should just tell me if you can do it.” Luo Qingfeng asked directly.

Shao Qingyang muttered to himself for a moment, then said with a bitter smile,””This really puts me in a difficult position ... Sect leader Luo, in this case, the spirit Vulture mountain will definitely be furious. They might even vent their anger on our fallen leaves sect!”

With the strength of the fallen leaves sect, do you really think that they are afraid of the spirit Vulture mountain? Even if you don’t have as many golden core cultivators as the spirit Vulture mountain, if the spirit Vulture mountain wants to deal with you, they won’t have much of an advantage! Wu Tiancheng is not an impulsive person. ”

“Of course, we’re not afraid of the lingjue mountain,” Shao Qingyang said with a faint smile.”But why would I want to make an enemy out of nothing?”

Luo Qingfeng had already anticipated the attitude of the fallen leaves sect. He smiled faintly and said,””Sect leader Shao, according to the rules, as long as there is no problem with my item, your sect, as the organizer, can’t reject the items we provide, right?”

“Of course!” Shao Qingyang said,”if the first two volumes of the ‘glittering jewel Wonderland’ that your sect provided are real, we naturally can’t stop this cultivation technique from being auctioned. However, the order of the auction is decided by us, the organizers.”

After saying that, Shao Qingyang smiled and looked at Luo Qingfeng.

Luo Qingfeng also showed a faint smile and said,””There are only two possibilities. The first is to follow our wishes and auction off our” the glittering jewel truth “handwritten copy before the auction on the lingjue mountain. The second way was to auction the scroll fragment after the lingjue mountain! I think I still need to analyze the second situation with sect leader Shao ... Since we dared to submit the “truth of the glittering jewel” to the auction, there is no doubt about its authenticity. If your sect were to auction this special item after the remnant of the spirit Vulture mountain, then ... What would the fellow Daoist who spent a high price to buy the remnant of the spirit Vulture mountain think? For us, there’s actually no loss. The higher the price of the lingjue mountain’s remnant volume, the higher the price of our complete first and second volumes of the “glittering jewel truth” will naturally rise. With so many cultivators attending the auction, I don’t have to worry about not being able to sell the cultivation method. ”

Shao Qingyang couldn’t help but take a deep breath. He had to admit that Luo Qingfeng’s words made sense.

However, he thought about it again and immediately smiled,”I admit that what sect leader Luo said makes sense. However, your sect’s sudden rush to sell the remnants of the “true glittering jewel Scripture” must not be just to gather spirit stones, right?”

Although Shao Qingyang didn’t go to the front desk, he had been paying close attention to the situation of the auction. Naturally, he had also seen what had happened when the mysterious ore was being bid for.

Wu Ming’s words put the star Seizer sect in a very passive position.

Shao Qingyang felt that Luo Qingfeng must have been extremely angry, which was why he had immediately taken out the transcript of the glittering jewel true understanding to attack the lingjue mountain.

Qingfeng Luo nodded generously and said,””Sect leader Shao’s eyes are as sharp as a torch. Naturally, you can see that our star Seizer sect is not to be bullied by anyone. What we did today was simply an eye for an eye. The little kid of the spirit Vulture mountain must be responsible for his words and actions. I will use this matter to teach him a lesson. Just take it as me teaching my son on behalf of Wu Tiancheng!”

Luo Qingfeng looked into Shao Qingyang’s eyes and asked,””How is it, sect leader Shao? Would the falling leaves sect help him with this? I hope that sect leader Shao can give me a straightforward answer. ” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Shao Qingyang pondered for a long time before he raised his head and said,””I can help, but I can’t do it for free ...”

“I’ll increase the auction Commission to 10%!” Qingfeng Luo said without hesitation.

“Sect master Luo, we don’t need a few spirit stones ...” Shao Qingyang waved his hand.

“What do you mean, sect leader Shao?” Luo Qingfeng asked.

“I’m sure your sect has the original version of the glittering jewel Wonderland,”said Shao Qingyang.” If we can help you with this, I wonder if I can take a look at it?” If it’s not convenient to use the original, a handwritten copy is fine!”

“This ...” Luo Qingfeng could not help but freeze.

He did not expect that Shao Qingyang would make such a request. If it was just a concession in terms of Commission, he could make the decision himself. Besides, Xia ruofei had given him a lot of authority. Even a 30% commission was not a problem. But if Shao Qingyang wanted to see the contents of the glittering jewel Wonderland, he could not make the decision.

Seeing this, Shao Qingyang immediately said,””I only need to borrow it for two hours. I also guarantee that the contents of the book will only be exchanged between the fallen leaves sect disciples and will not be spread to others!”

“Sect master Shao, I’m afraid ...” Luo Qingfeng smiled bitterly.

“What’s wrong? Can’t sect leader Luo make the decision?” Shao Qingyang was also a little surprised and asked with a slight frown.

At this moment, the door was opened and a young voice came in,””We can agree to this condition! However, you’re only allowed to read the first volume for an hour!”

Luo Qingfeng’s eyes lit up when he heard the voice. He turned around and said,””Junior Brother Xia, you’ve come?”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded at Luo Qingfeng. He waved the two handwritten copies that had just been bound in his hand and said,””Senior brother Luo, the handwritten copy has been brought.”

Shao Qingyang, who was standing at the side, was stunned. It was not because he could tell that Luo Qingfeng, the sect master of the star Seizer sect, could not make the decision, but because the young man in front of him had made the decision without hesitation. The main reason was ... The room was clearly set up with several kinds of barriers, but this young man had been able to hear their conversation from the outside!

This was simply too frightening ...
