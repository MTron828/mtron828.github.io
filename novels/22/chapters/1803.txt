Chapter 1804: High morale (2)

Translator: 549690339

Then, Xia ruofei reminded him again.”There are so many projects at once. We’ll be using too much money. We must pay attention to the health of the capital chain. Pang Hao’s side has to plan every expense well. Don’t be too anxious to collapse!”

“Understood!” Pang Hao said,”Chairman, as long as the loan from the bank goes smoothly, there won’t be any problems with our capital chain!”

Xia ruofei nodded and asked,”is there anything else you need to spend money on?”

Everyone laughed and shook their heads.

Xia ruofei had been away for more than a month. Many of their plans and ideas had to wait for him to come back, so they all asked for money at the meeting.

Xia ruofei closed the book and said,””If you don ‘t, then the meeting is over! I’m going to take a look at the headquarters! President Feng and director Dong, if you’re free, please come with me!”

“Alright!” Feng Rao and Dong Yun replied in unison.

The company’s top management walked out of the big meeting room in a single file. Everyone was rubbing their fists and wiping their palms, their morale very high.

If all the topics discussed in today’s meeting could be implemented, there was no doubt that paradise Corporation would welcome a great opportunity to take off.

As the company’s top management, their status naturally rose as well.

Xia ruofei and the other two went back to the office to put down their things and then went downstairs together.

The security had sent a veteran named Xie Bing to wait downstairs in a Mercedes – Benz. Xia ruofei and Feng Jing naturally sat in the back seat while Dong Yun sat in the front seat.

After getting in the car, Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,””President Dong, go and buy a few small cars for the company’s directors and above. Aren’t you going to buy a bus soon? We’ll make the plan together!”

Before Dong Yun could say anything, Feng Jing said,”Chairman, the company’s current demand for cars is not particularly urgent, we also ...”

Xia ruofei waved his hand.”A car also represents the face of a company. This Mercedes – Benz is the only decent car in the company now. In the future, you will have to deal with the government and the banks. You can’t always have a car, right?”

Since Xia ruofei said so, Feng Jing could not refute him. In fact, Feng Jing knew that it was necessary to get a car. It was not only for the sake of the company, but also for the enthusiasm of the higher – ups. However, they had just confirmed that they would need a lot of money during the meeting, so Feng Jing felt that the problem of the car could be put aside for a while.

Seeing that Feng Jing didn’t object anymore, Dong Yun nodded and said,””Alright!”

“Chairman, what kind of car should I get?” she asked.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”let’s go with the Mercedes – Benz S – Class!” This car is good for business use!”

“That’s a huge expenditure of several million Yuan!”Dong Yun raised her eyebrows and said.

There were five or six people above the director level in the company, including Xue Jinshan from the pharmaceutical factory. An imported S – Class Mercedes – Benz car, even an S350, would cost more than a million. If it was a Mercedes – Benz S600, it would cost two or three million.

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”we’re going to spend a few hundred million soon, why would we care about a few million?” Don’t worry! If the company’s funds are tight, I’ll continue to inject capital. I can’t say much, but one or two hundred million is not a problem!”

Xia ruofei’s overseas account had tens of millions of us dollars. In addition, his domestic account had tens of millions of cash, but he did not have any investment channels.

After the meeting in the morning, Xia ruofei’s thinking had changed. It was too bad to put the money in the bank to suffer interest. It was better to invest it in the development of the company.

Of course, he had to keep enough money to ensure his financial freedom. In other words, he only needed to consider his personal preferences when spending money, not the thickness of his wallet.

Hearing Xia ruofei’s words, Dong Yun had no more concerns. She nodded and said,””Understood, I’ll come up with a car purchase plan as soon as possible for you to have a look!”

“Yes, you’ve worked hard!” Xia ruofei said,”there might be some chaos in the short term after the company’s relocation. You’ll have to be exhausted as the Executive Director during this period of time with the coordination between the departments and the passing of messages. Quickly straighten out the daily management of the company!”

“No problem, this is part of my job!” Dong Yun said.

Soon, the car arrived at the new headquarters of paradise Corporation.

From afar, Xia ruofei could see that the original words “balance power building” had been removed from the outer wall of the building. In its place was the new words “paradise building” and the LOGO of paradise Corporation. It was very eye – catching from afar.

It was still daytime. Xia ruofei believed that at night, with the lighting effects, he could see the sign of the Paradise building from far away.

The building had been cleared, and the car slowed down at the entrance of the underground parking lot. Before the car stopped, the pole was raised.

Xia ruofei noticed that the guard in the parking lot was also a veteran from the security Department of Peach Blossom Farm. Xia ruofei could still vaguely remember his name.

“Xie Bing, that was Shen Yuanwu, right?” Xia ruofei asked.

“Yes, President Xia!” Xie Bing drove the car into the underground parking lot and answered,”we’re taking turns to be on duty. The building hasn’t been put into use yet, so we don’t need too many people for security.”

After two recruitments, the security Department now had more than 30 people.

However, Xia ruofei felt that the manpower was getting tighter and tighter because the security Department was in charge of the pharmaceutical factory. Now that there was an additional building, the security pressure was obvious.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said to Feng Rao,””Director Feng, I’m planning to expand the security Department. According to the current allocation of manpower, our brothers are working too hard, and it’s easy to make mistakes!”

“I think so!” Feng Jing nodded in agreement.

Xia ruofei said,”the security Department will have around 150 to 200 people!” I’ll give ye Lingyun and Lei Hu a heads up later. We’ll still prioritize recruiting from the Veterans!”

Many veterans had been drivers in the Army before. Whether it was in charge of security or driving, they had no problem. Maybe it was a little difficult to recruit veteran drivers because buses needed an A certificate, but small car drivers were definitely not a problem.

Although Feng Jing felt that there were too many people, she didn’t raise any objections.

Since the building was not yet in use, the underground parking lot was quite empty, so Xie Bing parked the car directly near the elevator.

Xia ruofei and the other two took the elevator up, while Xie Bing waited in the car.

“Chairman, where should we start?” Feng Rao asked.

“Let’s start from the bottom!” Xia ruofei said.

The peach blossom company was using the 10th to 15th floors that they had acquired from the Power Construction Company, and the 1st to 9th floors that they had bought from bojun real estate, which were all temporarily idle.

“Alright!” Feng ke said.

The three of them went to the tenth floor first.

This was actually a spare floor, but compared to the nine floors below, the tenth floor was decorated in the same style as the upper floors, including office slots and all kinds of cables. In the future, when the company expanded, they could directly use it as long as they purchased office equipment.

Xia ruofei looked at it seriously. He asked about everything, from the model of the cable, the brand of the cement paint, and the wallpaper. He also asked about the specific results of the environmental impact.

The three of them watched and chatted as they walked up the stairs.

The 11th and 12th floors were the marketing department’s territory, including the e – commerce Department.

The 13th floor was for the finance and security departments.

The vice president’s office was on the 14th floor. Of course, it was still empty. The administrative department was also on this floor.

The 15th floor was split into two. The largest part was Xia ruofei’s chairman’s office, while the other part was the CEO’s office. There was even a space beside Feng Jing’s office for the use of the CEO’s office staff.

The directors of each department worked on the floor of their respective departments. As there was plenty of space, the directors had their own spacious offices. Of course, it could not be compared to Xia ruofei and Feng Jing’s super – Large offices.

When they reached the vice president’s office on the 14th floor, Xia ruofei even said meaningfully,””I hope this office won’t be empty for too long! Everyone has to work hard!”

Of the three people present, one was the chairman and the other was the president. Naturally, they did not need to “work hard” to fight for the position of Vice President. Xia ruofei’s meaning was clear.

Dong Yun’s eyes were filled with fighting spirit, and she couldn’t help but feel her blood boiling. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Soon, the three of them arrived at the 15th floor. This was the first time Xia ruofei had visited his future office after the office was renovated.
