2008 Entering a no man’s land (2)

From the moment Xia ruofei entered the room to the moment the burly man was knocked out, only about a minute had passed. In the twenty to thirty seconds, she was talking to the burly man. In other words, she had only spent thirty to forty seconds to take care of the last two burly men who were guarding Rousey.

Do you understand English Xia ruofei asked Luo Si.

Of course! Rosey replied in perfect English.

Among the Italy, there were not many who were good at English. Even those who could speak often had a strong accent, and Rossi was clearly well – educated.

That’s much easier! Xia ruofei smiled and said,Rousey, come with me! Your sister asked me to come and save you!

Why should I believe you Rossi looked at Xia ruofei and asked,what evidence do you have to prove that Monica sent you

There’s no need for any proof. You’ll be able to see Monica soon! Xia ruofei said. Then, he shrugged his shoulders and asked,besides, if I want to take you away, can you resist

Rosey was stunned for a moment, then he smiled and said,That makes sense! But ... How are you going to take me away You want to push me out in a wheelchair The guards at the rehabilitation Center are not just for show ...

Simple! Xia ruofei said casually.

He squatted down in front of the bed and carried Rousey on his back.

Following that, Xia ruofei took out a rope from his pocket and pulled it out. In fact, he was putting his hand into his pocket and taking out a Kasaya from the spirit map space. He used the rope to tie Rossi to his body and smiled. It’s time to leave!

Although Rousey could not walk, he was not thin and weak. If he stood up, he would be at least 1.8 meters tall. His leg muscles were atrophied, making them look much smaller than ordinary people’s legs. However, his upper body was very strong. It was clear that he did not lack exercise.

Rossi was more than 150 pounds, but Xia ruofei carried him as if he could not feel his weight at all. It was quite easy.

He pushed the door open and looked around. Then he ran to the safety passage on the west side of the corridor with Rossi on his back. He ran down the stairs quickly along the route he had just come in.

Luo Si lay on Xia ruofei’s back and could hear the wind whistling in his ears. Xia ruofei was clearly running on foot with him on his back, but it was as if he was sitting in a high – speed car. It could be seen how fast Xia ruofei was.

They did not encounter any obstacles along the way. Xia ruofei carried Rossi and easily dodged the old man who was guarding the door. Then, he went straight to the position where he had just sneaked in.

Hey! The main gate is on the other side! Rousey reminded him in a low voice.

I know! Xia ruofei said without turning his head,but I don’t want to go through the main door. Who knows how many guards there are waiting for me to deal with!

As they spoke, Xia ruofei had already arrived at the wall. Before Luo Si could ask Xia ruofei how to get out, he felt his body suddenly rise up as if he was riding on clouds.

In the next moment, Rousey found himself on the other side of the wall.

Xia ruofei kicked the ground, flipped over, and landed. The entire set of movements was done in one go and was very light. Luo Si, who was behind him, did not feel much of a shock and was already outside the wall.

Monica, who was waiting anxiously in the bushes, could not help but stand up when she saw Xia ruofei’s figure appear on the wall. With the help of the weak light from the street lamp, Monica could vaguely see that Xia ruofei was carrying someone on his back. She was suddenly excited and could not hold it in any longer. She ran out of the bushes she was hiding in.

It’s Monica! Rousey called out.

Xia ruofei carried Rossi to Monica. Monica finally saw that the person on Xia ruofei’s back was her younger brother, Rossi, whom she was most worried about. She burst into tears ...

Rousey! Are you alright Monica quickly asked.

I’m fine! Rousey grinned and said,Monica, the person you sent to save me is so good at fighting. Jack and the others are like four or five – year – old children in front of him. They can’t even withstand a single blow!

Monica quickly said,Rousey, don’t be rude! How could I order Mr. Xia around I begged him to go in and bring you out!

Monica could not help but feel nervous when she heard Rossi say send someone to save me. She was afraid that Xia ruofei would be angry.

Actually, Xia ruofei could not understand Italian at all. Besides, he was not that petty.

Xia ruofei only said indifferently,let’s talk in the car! I didn’t hide my tracks just now, so someone might catch up to us soon!

Alright, thank you for your hard work, Mr. Xia! Monica said hurriedly.

Xia ruofei opened the back door of the Mercedes – Benz, untied the rope, and carried Rousey into the car. Monica quickly got into the car from the other side. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei quickly started the car and left the rehabilitation Center.

Of course, he didn’t stop in the city. Instead, he drove out of the city.

A few minutes later, the sound of cars screeching and the sharp sound of brakes breaking broke the silence. A group of fierce – looking men rushed into the rehabilitation Center and went straight to the sixth floor where Rousey was under house arrest.

The group of men naturally returned without any success. They came to a white middle – aged man in a flashy white suit and said,Mr. Gelman, they’ve rescued her, but she shouldn’t have gone far. She’s still warm in bed!

Mr. Gelman, another man suggested,let’s hurry and chase after them!

The middle – aged white man was the young leader of the Gehrman family, dyyork. After receiving the news that Toles had been assassinated, dyyork had rushed over immediately and brought his men to chase after him.

Chase Dick laughed coldly.The roads here lead in all directions. We don’t even know which direction they went. How are we going to chase them

Then ... What should we do

Check the video at the rehabilitation Center immediately, said dillork.Then compare it with the surveillance video at Toles ‘villa. I need to know the real identity of this Asian as soon as possible!

Understood!

Also, dillork continued,send someone to Glasso’s house and smash everything you can!

According to the description of the people at the scene, deyork knew that after the other party killed Toles, they also took Monica of the Grasso family, the woman Toles had taken a fancy to. Although there was no evidence pointing to Monica or the entire Grasso family as to what the masked man had to do with it, the Gelman family had always been drooling over the Grasso family. How could they let go of such a good opportunity

Yes! The black – clothed man responded and immediately went to make arrangements.

Tonight, for the Grasso family, they were probably going to be in big trouble.

However, Monica didn’t care about the life and death of the Grasso family. At this moment, she was sitting in the back seat of the speeding Mercedes – Benz, constantly asking about her brother.

Soon, the car crossed the river and left the downtown area of Turin, heading to the less populated suburbs.

She could not return to the hotel tonight.

Although Xia ruofei had changed his appearance when he was doing this, it was very easy for him to go back to the hotel and the other party would not be able to find out that it was him. But now that Monica and Rousey were also here, it was hard to say.

Xia ruofei knew that as soon as he returned to the hotel with Monica and her brother, the Mafia would arrive.

If they didn’t get rid of the Gehrman family, Monica and her brother might never be able to return home. The Black Hand Gang would definitely find them even if they had to dig three feet underground.

At that time, the two of them would definitely end up in a very miserable state.

How should he deal with this

Xia ruofei’s brain was also working quickly, hoping to find a solution as soon as possible.

In fact, with Xia ruofei’s individual combat ability, he could slowly take out the Gelman family’s main target, Yiyi, by himself. However, doing so would be too ostentatious and would easily attract the attention of the huge glory society.

It was obviously not the best plan.

He was thinking as he drove, and suddenly an idea came to his mind ...
