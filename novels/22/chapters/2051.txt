2052 Brother, I can only help you this much (3)

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.”Alright, alright! I was just scaring you! You’re such a coward even when you’re sober, do you think you’ll suddenly become a man after drinking a little?”

“Who’s a coward! Who’s a coward!” Song Rui said, unconvinced.

“If you’re not afraid, would Zhuo Yiyi still treat you as a brother?” Xia ruofei said,”How long have you been here? Why is there no progress at all?”

“I’m just enjoying the process of pursuing a girl ...” Song Rui said.

“You don’t even believe your own words, do you?” Xia ruofei sneered.

“Hey! Don’t tear down hard times, you know? Why are you bringing it up?” Song Rui was flustered and exasperated.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I’m just worried about you!” Xiao Rui, as your brother, I have to remind you that you should work harder. The lady is not completely uninterested in you. As a man, you should take the initiative sometimes!”

“Did Yiyi tell you something yesterday?” song Rui asked immediately.

“What did she say to me? I didn ‘t!” Xia ruofei yawned.

“She must have told you something. Otherwise, you wouldn’t have said that!” Song Rui said,”ruofei, quickly tell your buddy. What did Yiyi say?”

“I really didn’t say anything! It’s up to you to believe or not!” Xia ruofei said. Then, Xia ruofei shouted,”Wuqiang, see if you’re done earlier?” I still have to go to the airport later!”

With that, Xia ruofei strode towards the backyard. Song Rui followed him and asked him questions, but Xia ruofei refused to give in.

It wasn’t that he was deliberately keeping them in suspense, but it wasn’t a good thing to have too many outsiders involved in matters of the heart, especially when song Rui and Zhuo Yiyi were so close. It was the best choice to leave it for them to expose themselves.

Hence, Xia ruofei kept his mouth shut even after breakfast. He did not tell song Rui about what Zhuo Yiyi had told him.

However, song Rui was also a smart person. Xia ruofei believed that he would also increase his offensive. As for whether it would succeed, it would depend on whether Zhuo Yiyi had listened to his words last night and what decision she would make after listening to him.

Anyway, no matter what Zhuo Yiyi’s decision was, the matter between her and song Rui would soon have a clear conclusion.

Of course, Xia ruofei hoped that this would be a good outcome. However, he had already done what he could. Now, he could only wish them well.

Zhao Yongjun and the others finished their breakfast and left.

Although song Rui wanted to ask Xia ruofei, he knew that Xia ruofei would not say anything even if he knew, so he had to leave first.

Since Xia ruofei wanted him to step up his attack, he would give it a try. Speaking of which, he had never confessed to Zhuo Yiyi before! It seemed that he had to plan well and find a good time.

Although Xia ruofei often teased him and the two of them often bickered, Xia ruofei would never lie to him when it came to important matters. He would not harm him either. Song Rui was very clear about this. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

After Zhao Yongjun and the others left, Xia ruofei went back to his room to pack his luggage. Then, he asked Wu Qiang to drive him to the airport.

Liu An’s flight crew had flown from San Shan to Beijing overnight. The International flight route to Turin had been applied for, and the estimated time of departure was around 10:30 in the morning.

This time, Xia ruofei was using his own identity to go abroad, so there was no need to hide. He directly asked Wu Qiang to send him to an auxiliary building next to Terminal 2 of the Capital International Airport. The flight passage for the business jet was set in this auxiliary building.

At 10:35 A. M., The Gulfstream G650 bus plane was allowed to enter the runway after an Airbus plane landed.

After a slide to accelerate, the Gulfstream plane’s streamlined body leaped lightly on the runway, drawing a beautiful arc and rushing into the rare blue sky in Beijing ...
