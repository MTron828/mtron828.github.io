2551 Super long – range hanging shot (2)

This was a drop shot! A long – distance lob over forty meters away!

Neto had just abandoned the goal to attack and was still on the edge of the penalty area. He did not have time to return to the front of the goal. At this time, Xia ruofei actually made a drop shot.

Neto felt all the hair on his body stand up. He desperately ran in the direction of the goal with all his strength, but he saw the football go over his head. It was futile for him to reach out. The height difference was far too great!

Neto symbolically jumped high. He did not expect to have teammates on the goal line waiting to clear the siege. Neto just wanted to change the flying trajectory of the football even if his fingertips touched the football a little.

However, he did not touch the ball at all.

Neto’s tall body fell heavily on the grass, his head still turning along with the football’s trajectory, his eyes full of despair.

In Neto’s eyes, the football seemed to have slowed down, or rather, the flow of time in the entire world seemed to have slowed down. He watched the football approach the goal bit by bit.

Bang! Bang!

The football slammed heavily into the lower edge of the crossbar!

However, it did not bounce into the goal. Instead, it landed on the goal line and then bounced toward the small penalty area.

At this moment, Neto felt that the flow of time had returned to normal. He also subconsciously used his hands and feet to rush in the direction of the football. Finally, with a strong push of his legs, he pounced over and pressed the football under his body.

These few short seconds felt like a long time to Neto.

He panted heavily and pressed the football tightly under his body, not moving.

On one hand, Neto was feeling scared. At this moment, his back was already drenched in cold sweat. On the other hand, he also wanted to use this opportunity to buy as much time as possible within the scope of the rules.

The moment Xia ruofei closed the door, the entire court quieted down. Everyone stared at the ball that was spinning at high speed.

When the ball hit the bottom of the goal, it bounced off the goal line and was caught by the inner support. Valencia’s fans heaved a long sigh of relief, feeling like they had just survived a disaster.

The Spanish fans in the visiting stands let out a huge sigh.

Beijing, PP sports studio.

“This pass is too small! Wu Lei was trying his best to catch up! Good luck, Wu Lei!” Shen fangjian shouted excitedly,”Aiya! The opposing goalkeeper, Neto, got the ball out of the encirclement first ... Wait! Wu Lei touched the ball, and now the ball bounced near the sidelines! Xia ruofei! He had grabbed the second landing point! He directly fired a drop shot! The goalkeeper did not touch the football ... Aiya! The beam! It’s such a pity ...”

“It’s such a pity!” Jia Tianning couldn’t help but sigh,”if that goal had gone in just now, he would definitely have been selected for the best goal of the round!”

“Let’s watch the slow – Motion replay!” Shen fangjian said,”a moment ago, Xia ruofei was still in the front field fighting with Wu Lei and iglaisias for the high post. After Neto rescued him, he had already rushed to the sidelines. I have to say that Xia ruofei’s judgment of the landing point was too accurate! That was a beautiful shot. To be honest, this position was a little off, but Xia ruofei did not hesitate to choose to shoot from the side. This was beyond everyone’s expectations!”

Jia Tianning said,”Xia ruofei’s shot was perfect in all other aspects, except that it didn’t bring a goal!” From this, it could be seen that Xia ruofei’s footwork was very good! Some netizens are questioning Xia ruofei’s qualifications to compete. I think ... This is the best response for Xia ruofei!”

“After Xia ruofei went on stage, he only touched the ball twice. This time, it hit the lower edge of the scale again!” Shen fangjian said,”we can see the whole picture from the tip of the iceberg. We can be sure that Xia ruofei’s footwork is not inferior to those big star players!”

……

Thousands of miles away in the capital city’s PP sports studio, the two commentators were still passionately discussing the goal. Xia ruofei, who had missed the goal, did not seem too upset. He just waved his hand casually and started to walk back.

Neto lay on the ground for a while before he slowly stood up at the referee’s urging.

Before the kick – off, he carefully placed the ball on the line of the small penalty area and then slowly backed away. His speed was like a snail, and he dawdled for a while.

In the end, when Neto kicked the goal ball out, the referee blew the whistle to end the first half of the game.

The players walked off the field. The Valencia players looked serious as they thought about how their performance at the start of the game was like a dream. They had already led by two goals, and everyone thought that it would not be a problem to score three points.

They did not expect the game to turn out like this in the last ten minutes or so, and they were almost equalized by Espanyol.

The Spanish players walked off the field, talking and laughing. Most of them were talking about Xia ruofei’s shot, and their words were filled with regret.

Xia ruofei and Wu Lei walked side by side to the changing room. Wu Lei covered his mouth and said,””Brother Xia, that ball just now was such a pity! I’m a little unlucky!”

Now, a lot of players paid attention to covering their mouths when they spoke on the field. This was not because they had just finished eating garlic, but because they covered their mouths with their hands after being caught by the broadcast camera so that the lip – reading experts hired by the TV stations would not read what they had just said.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”it’s okay. Let’s do another lob in the second half!” The kind that is even further away than this!”

Wu Lei knew that he did not have many chances like what he had just done, but he did not refute Xia ruofei. Instead, he nodded his head heavily. At this time, he could not say anything to give up.

However, Xia ruofei did not feel regretful, nor did he lose confidence. He had already done his best with the lob shot just now. That was the only way to get the football past the tall goalkeeper, Neto. He could even roughly judge that the football would hit the crossbar at the moment of the shot, but whether it would enter the goal or bounce out after the rebound would really depend on luck.

In other words, if it were any other player, the result of this drop shot could not be better.

Since it was destined that they would not be able to score a goal, what was there to regret?

During the 15 – minute break, head coach Ruby kept cheering for the players. He even praised the cooperation between Xia ruofei and Wu Lei. When they were arranging the tactics for the second half, Ruby and Xia ruofei had agreed to let Wu Lei try to withdraw and receive the ball. In addition, Ruby emphasized that everyone should try to create free kick opportunities in the front field, because Xia ruofei’s free kick technique had not been fully utilized yet!

The halftime interval soon ended and the players from both teams returned to the field at the referee’s urging.

Both teams did not make any substitution adjustments and still had the same lineup at the end of the first half.

Espanyol kicked off in the second half.

The referee blew the whistle and the center forward, Iglesia, who was stepping on the football, nudged the ball towards Wu Lei and then ran to the front field.

Valencia’s players quickly spread out their formation and pressed forward to take a break. Their manager stressed that they had to maintain the force of the press and not let the Spanish team organize an effective attack.

Wu Lei did not stop the ball. Instead, he passed the ball diagonally behind him. The ball flew accurately towards Xia ruofei on his right.

After Xia ruofei stopped the ball, he took a step forward and passed the center line.

At that moment, a player from Valencia quickly approached from the side. Xia ruofei did not need his teammates ‘reminders. It was as if he had eyes on his back. He gently nudged the ball to the side and used his body to separate the ball from the player.

Then, Xia ruofei changed his rhythm and sped up to dribble the ball forward, leaving the Valencia player in the dust.

At this moment, Xia ruofei raised his head and saw that the goalkeeper Neto was standing a little forward.

He said in his heart,”damn!” This is looking down on my shooting skills! What could be tolerated?

Even though the ball had just crossed the center line, Xia ruofei did not hesitate and immediately swung his leg over.

With a bang, the football was like a cannonball that was shot out of the barrel, flying quickly in the direction of the Valensia team’s goal ...
