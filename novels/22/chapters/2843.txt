2844 Hot search specialist (2)

Wu Lei smiled bitterly and handed the phone to Xia ruofei.””You just casually posted a video and I’m on the hot search! You call this not doing anything?”

Xia ruofei glanced at it and laughed.””I’ll go! Third on the hot search? How did you get there so quickly?”

Wu Lei did not know whether to laugh or cry,”brother Xia, don’t you know how much influence you have?” I just came out of the shower and wanted to say that I’ll look at my phone for a while. I almost died when I saw more than ten missed calls and more than ten WeChat messages ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”then you’re too timid!” You’re scared to death just because you’re on the hot search? I seem to be on it often!” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Wu Lei couldn’t help but roll his eyes and said,””I wasn’t scared to death by the hot search. I was just shocked to see so many missed calls and unread messages. I thought something big had happened!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh. He looked at the comments with great interest and said,””Lei Zi, this is a good thing! What a positive energy! I was in the changing room this morning when I suddenly thought that this video was quite meaningful, so I simply edited it and posted it on Weibo! The facts have proven that my judgment is still very accurate! Do you see how the netizens are buying it? And so many authoritative media outlets are praising you! It’s so good!”

“So you told me to go to the training ground in the morning just to edit this video!” Wu Lei said.

“Yup!” Xia ruofei said,”the effect is not bad, right? Hahaha!”

Wu Lei finally understood what had happened. He was silent for a moment before he said sincerely,””Brother Xia, thank you! You’ve helped me so many times that I don’t even know how to thank you!”

Xia ruofei patted Wu Lei’s shoulder and said,””You don’t have to be so polite! Lei Zi, I admire your drive and character, and I also admire your courage to walk out of your comfort zone to chase after your dreams. That’s why we hit it off so well! As long as you play well and work hard to realize your football dream, that will be the best way to thank me!”

Wu Lei’s heart warmed, and he said with determination,””I will! Brother Xia! As long as you’re still investing in the Spanish club, I won’t go anywhere in the future. I’ll stay here! Even if I’m unfortunately relegated to League Two in the future, I will never transfer ...”

Wu Lei quickly added,””Pei Pei Pei! Brother Xia ... I ... I didn’t mean it that way ... With our team’s strength, it’s definitely not a problem to stay in the league ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand,”I understand what you mean!” “But Lei Zi, in the future, when your strength improves, and if there is a better platform, I will still support you to go out. There is no need for you to stay in RCD Espanyol just because of me...Of course, you can’t go to bar?a! Hahaha!”

Normally, at Wu Lei’s age, although he wasn’t in the middle or late stages of his career, he didn’t have much room for growth in his skills. Basically, they were all fixed. However, Xia ruofei had taught him the first set of the Golden man’s body refining movements, allowing him to make great progress in his physical strength, flexibility, agility, and many other aspects at the age of 27. In addition, the high – Level competitions in the top league would also further improve his awareness. With this, he had more possibilities in the future.

Hence, Wu Lei’s gratitude towards Xia ruofei came from the bottom of his heart. In his eyes, Xia ruofei had given him a new life. It was because of this that Wu Lei had a stronger sense of belonging to the Spanish club and was even willing to play there until he retired.

After hearing Xia ruofei’s words, Wu Lei opened his mouth but Xia ruofei waved his hand to stop him. He said,””The future is too far away, let’s not talk about it! Leizi, didn’t you say you were going to give the young players a gift? Let’s hurry over!”

“Good! I’ve already prepared everything, let’s go!” Wu Lei quickly said.

Although Xia ruofei had said that he would not object to him playing on a better and bigger platform, he had secretly made up his mind. As long as Espanyol needed him and Xia ruofei was still a shareholder of Espanyol, he would stay in the team and never seek a transfer.

Wu Lei carried a shoe box and went to the training ground of the women’s ladder with Xia ruofei.

Wu Lei had already contacted the club’s staff in advance and found the Spain girl named Claire.

In fact, the children of this age group were usually the same as other children. They were in school and basically came to train in their spare time. It wasn’t the weekend, so Claire’s training was scheduled for the evening. She had been notified by the club staff and had come over after the morning class.

Xia ruofei and Wu Lei saw Claire, who was also wearing the Spanish team’s yellow sports jacket, at the side of the training ground. There was a little boy who was a little taller than her.

“Hello!” Wu Lei smiled and greeted Claire in Chinese.

Claire was also very excited to see Wu Lei and Xia ruofei. She quickly jogged over to them and said with a trembling voice,””Hello! Mr. Xia, I didn’t expect to see you here!”

Xia ruofei was impressed by the girl’s Chinese. She did not have the strange accent of a foreigner. It sounded like a Chinese kid.

“Hello!” Xia ruofei smiled.

Claire was very sensible. She pointed at the little boy beside her and said,””This is my brother!”

The little boy also greeted Xia ruofei and Wu Lei shyly. In comparison, Claire was more natural and unrestrained.

To Xia ruofei’s surprise, the little boy also greeted them in Chinese.

The four of them stood at the side and chatted for a while. Xia ruofei realized that the little girl’s Chinese was much better than her brother ‘s. After asking, he found out that the little boy had only learned Chinese for a year, while Claire had been learning it for eight years.

Although Xia ruofei had invested in the Espanyol club, he was not familiar with the club’s situation, so he asked about the women’s soccer team when they were chatting.

From Claire, Xia ruofei learned that the RCD Espanyol had a four – age group of women’s football teams. The first team was basically professional and usually participated in the local Women’s Football League. However, the attention was obviously not as high as the men’s football team, and the treatment of the players was relatively lower.

As for the other ladder teams of several ages, each team had many girls who liked football like Claire. Most of them followed the training system, which was equivalent to amateur players.

Very few of these girls would be able to embark on the path of professional football in the future, and even if they joined a professional team, their income was not high. However, there were still many young girls who joined the team training because they liked football from the bottom of their hearts.

After Xia ruofei had a brief understanding of the situation, he could not help but exclaim that the football environment and fan culture in Europe were much better than that in China!

After a short chat, Wu Lei gave the sneakers to Claire.

Before buying the sneakers, Wu Lei even asked the staff to know Claire’s size. He was very meticulous.

Claire was pleasantly surprised to receive Wu Lei’s gift. She held the sneakers in her arms as if she had found a treasure. She smiled brightly and kept thanking Xia ruofei and Wu Lei.

A pair of assassin – Series sneakers cost at least two to three hundred euros, which was definitely a very expensive gift.

Not to mention that it was a gift from her favorite Star, Wu Lei, which made it even more meaningful.

The little girl hugged the sneakers with a dazed expression, as if she was drunk. It was obvious that this surprise was too big.

Xia ruofei took a picture of Wu Lei giving the sneakers to Claire. Then, he smiled and asked Wu Lei to take a picture with the two children.

At last, under Wu Lei’s invitation, Xia ruofei walked over and asked the staff to help take photos. The four of them took another photo together and then everyone waved goodbye.
