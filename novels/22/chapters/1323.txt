Chapter 1324: Chapter 792 – a great disaster befalls (1)

Translator: 549690339

Chen Weinan was sulking in his office when he received the call.

He didn’t know if he was angry at his nephew for being so disappointing or that Lin Zhongming was unreliable.

Chen Weinan was very clear about his incompetent nephew. He could only believe 30 – 40% of what he said. As for what the real situation was, he would only know after he had a detailed understanding.

Just as Chen Weinan was smoking in his office, his phone rang.

The person who called was an old classmate of his. He worked at the group’s headquarters and had a similar rank as him. However, his authority was not comparable to that of a leader of a subsidiary company.

So Chen Weinan immediately got rid of the negative emotions, adjusted his mood, and answered the phone.

“Old Ma!” Chen Weinan laughed heartily and said. How come a busy man like you has the time to look for me today? Don’t tell me you’re thinking about the two bottles of Maotai at home?”

On the other end of the phone, old Ma was not in the mood to joke. He lowered his voice and said solemnly,””Our Discipline Inspection team is currently investigating Chen shun’s matter. President Tang has already personally gone to San Shan to repair the relationship with the peach blossom company. You might also have some trouble on your side, so quickly think of a solution!”

Old Ma finished his words quickly and hung up the phone without waiting for Chen Weinan to reply.

Chen Weinan heard the busy tone from the phone and was dumbfounded. He still held the phone in his hand, but his brain was in a mess ...

Old Ma’s phone call made Chen Weinan feel that a disaster was imminent.

Although he was working in a company, it was still within the system, and he could even reach a division – Level position. Chen Weinan’s sensitivity was no less than that of people in the government.

Old Ma’s phone call gave him a very dangerous signal.

First of all, old Ma was very careful. He hung up the phone after he finished speaking in a hurry. It could be seen that the matter was very serious. Old Ma had taken the risk to tip him off. No matter how this matter was handled, he owed him a big favor.

In addition, although old Ma’s words were short, the information was quite rich.

The first reason was that the group’s Discipline Inspection had directly intervened and so quickly. He hadn’t heard anything about it in advance and had been investigating in secret.

Secondly, President Tang of the corporation actually went to San Shan to carry out crisis public relations in person, explaining the seriousness of the situation. At the same time, it also reflected the deep background of this company.

In addition, old Ma also said that even he, Chen Weinan, was in trouble, which explained the problem even more.

Chen Weinan knew that this disappointing nephew of his had probably poked a hole in the sky this time. Moreover, when he called Chen shun in the morning, Chen shun definitely did not tell the truth. The matter was definitely not as simple as Lin Zhongming being a traitor and colluding with the peach blossom company to cheat funds.

Chen Weinan almost fainted. This time, he was really screwed.

He took a few deep breaths and forced himself to calm down. There was no use in losing his mind now. The most important thing was to get through the crisis.

Chen Weinan quickly made a decision.

He didn’t immediately look for his close superior. At this time, unless they were very close, most people would definitely choose to protect themselves and avoid him.

Chen Weinan’s first call was to Chen shun. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

This was because Chen Weinan had already realized that the key to solving the problem was paradise Corporation.

As long as he could obtain the forgiveness of the Paradise Corporation, the possibility of him getting through this safely would increase greatly. Otherwise, no matter how much he begged, he would probably not be able to escape the fate of being severely punished.

Chen Weinan found Chen shun’s phone and dialed it, while praying that Chen shun was not on the plane back to the capital.

......

In fact, Chen shun was not in such a hurry to return to the capital.

It was not easy for him to come to the South. Although he did not succeed and was still angry, he did not want to make a wasted trip.

After all, this was a public business trip. The return tickets, city transportation, accommodation, meals, and so on could be reimbursed. Moreover, there was a 200 to 300 yuan travel allowance every day. Where else could he find such a good deal?

So, he had long forgotten about the unpleasant things in the morning. In the afternoon, he went to visit the scenic spots in Sanshan with the purchasing Commissioner. He was also planning to rent a car to Zhang Gang tomorrow to eat seafood and play by the beach. It would be a worthwhile trip.

The reason why he brought the purchasing Specialist along was that, on one hand, they were going on a business trip together, and he couldn’t go back first. On the other hand, he wanted to give him some benefits to gamble on his mouth. After all, Chen shun and the purchasing Specialist were well aware of the quality of the batch of Cordyceps. When they went back, they would make the purchasing Specialist insist that the quality was average, so they would have to give him some small favors to win him over.

When he received Chen Weinan’s call, Chen shun was still playing in the most famous San Fang Qi Street in the San Shan city. He was walking in the antique alleys and enjoying the night view of the alleys. He was in a very good mood.

Seeing that it was Chen Weinan’s call, Chen shun picked up the phone indifferently, even though it was noisy with people around him,””Second uncle, what’s the matter?”

Chen Weinan was almost roaring as he asked,”What are you doing? You can’t even handle such a small matter and you’ve caused me so much trouble! Are you trying to get me killed?”

Chen shun was dumbfounded. He asked,”Second uncle, I ... I didn’t cause any trouble! I’m still at the three mountains! You’re not mistaken, are you?”

“No trouble?” Chen Weinan coldly said. You didn’t cause the trouble at paradise Corporation? Don’t tell me it’s me?”
