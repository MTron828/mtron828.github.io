Chapter 1703: A blow (2)

Translator: 549690339

Since Li Yifu had already said so, Xia ruofei was too embarrassed to refuse.

Moreover, he had never fought with a cultivator before, so he wanted to test his actual combat power. Thus, he pondered for a moment and nodded,”Then I’ll accept your invitation!”

“Grandpa li, ruofei, let’s go to the back garden!” Tang Yitian said quickly. The field over there is bigger!”

“Lead the way!” Li Yifu said straightforwardly.

Thus, the group of people moved to the back garden. The two of them stood facing each other in the empty garden. Tang Yitian and Xu Ziyuan stood far away, their eyes full of anticipation.

“Senior li, please!” Xia ruofei said as he cupped his fists.

“Brother Xia, be careful!” Li Yifu did not stand on ceremony. He made an opening gesture and pounced on Xia ruofei like lightning.

In the blink of an eye, the two had exchanged a few moves. Tang Yitian and Xu Ziyuan didn’t even dare to blink because their speed was so fast that they couldn’t see their movements clearly. They even felt that they had left afterimages.

Even the dazzling special effects in movies and TV shows were not as shocking as the scene of the two fighting.

In fact, it only took a few breaths for Xia ruofei and Li Yifu to separate from each other.

Xia ruofei’s face revealed a trace of surprise. Li Yifu’s face changed drastically, and he had a look of disbelief.

Although it was only a short contact, Li Yifu could clearly feel that Xia ruofei’s vital energy was extremely powerful. It gave him a feeling that he was unparalleled. Although Xia ruofei did not have any mysterious ultimate moves, in fact, Xia ruofei did not attack him at all. However, Li Yifu still felt that he could not find his opponent’s flaws no matter how hard he tried. Xia ruofei’s every move and a few casual movements could easily block all his attacks.

Li Yifu suddenly realized that he had made an error in his judgment. How was the cultivation of this young man in front of him about to catch up with him? It had surpassed him by a large margin!

Li Yifu felt a deep sense of defeat when he thought about the other party’s age and his own.

As for Xia ruofei, he was also filled with shock.

He was not surprised by Li Yifu’s cultivation. To be precise, he was a little surprised, but he felt that Li Yifu was much weaker than he had imagined.

What Xia ruofei was really surprised about was that Li Yifu’s moves felt familiar to him. Even Li Yifu’s genuine Qi felt familiar to him when they fought.

Hence, Xia ruofei started to search his guts.

At Xia ruofei’s level, his memory was pretty good. He had a photographic memory. However, he had read too many ancient books and martial arts. Most of them were just for reference. He did not really study them or practice them. Therefore, he could not remember them.

On the other side, Li Yifu couldn’t help but ask bitterly,””Brother ... Brother Xia, if I may ask, your current cultivation ...”

Xia ruofei came back to her senses and said casually,””Senior Li, I’m still at Qi disciple Level 5 ...”

Recently, Xia ruofei had been using spiritual crystals to cultivate, so his progress was much faster than before. In fact, he could vaguely feel the bottleneck of Qi disciple Level 6, and he was not far from a breakthrough.

However, Xia ruofei had always paid attention to letting nature take its course when he cultivated. He did not pursue it deliberately, including the few breakthroughs he had made. When he reached the realm, it would be natural. Hence, he was not in a hurry and continued to maintain his own cultivation pace.

Li Yifu couldn’t help but take a deep breath when he heard Xia ruofei’s words.

Qi disciple Level 5! This young man in his 20s was already a Qi disciple Level 5 master!

He still didn’t know that Xia ruofei had cultivated both true Qi and mental power at the same time, and that the cultivation of mental power was higher than the cultivation of true Qi. Otherwise, he would have been even more shocked.

When Li Yifu thought about how he had been cultivating since he was young, and how he was only at Qi disciple Level 3 even though he was getting old, he felt as if his world view was going to be subverted.

Even his father, Li Jiu Zhou, a legendary figure, had only reached Qi disciple Level 6 in his entire life. He had not been able to transform even the slightest bit of true Qi into Yuan Qi, and was still far from reaching Foundation establishment.

Xia ruofei, on the other hand, was only in his twenties, but he was about to reach his father’s level. It was really infuriating!

In reality, it was not that Li Jiu Zhou or Li Yifu were not talented. It was just that the cultivation environment on earth was too harsh. They did not have top – notch cultivation techniques like Xia ruofei, nor did they have precious spiritual crystals to assist in their cultivation. Every day, they could only absorb the thin spiritual Qi at midnight and dawn. It would be strange if their cultivation progress could be fast!

Li Yifu took a long time to come back to his senses and said with a bitter smile,””It seems like I’m really a frog at the bottom of a well! So Mr. Xia’s cultivation has long since surpassed mine ...”

Xu Ziyuan and Tang Yitian were so surprised that their mouths were wide open. They knew that Xia ruofei was powerful, but they didn’t expect him to be this powerful.

Xia ruofei, who was in his twenties, had a cultivation that far surpassed Li Yifu ‘s? The two of them felt that this was so unreal. They simply couldn’t believe their ears.

“Mr. Xia, may I ask about your disciple’s cultivation ...” Li Yifu couldn’t help but ask.

He had unknowingly changed “brother Xia” to “Mr. Xia,” and his tone was much more respectful.

After asking, Li Yifu stared at Xia ruofei, feeling a little worried.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Haoran has just started cultivating. He’s still at Qi disciple Level 1 ...”

Li Yifu secretly heaved a sigh of relief. If even Tang Haoran’s cultivation was higher than his, then he had really wasted his life.

However, Xia ruofei immediately continued,””However, this child’s talent is really not bad. He has already touched the bottleneck of Qi disciple Level 1. If there are no accidents, he will soon break through to Qi disciple Level 2 ...”

Li Yifu almost fell down. He still remembered that he had cultivated for five years before he managed to break through to Qi disciple Level 2 with great difficulty. After that, he spent another 30 years before he broke through to Qi disciple Level 3. After that, he was just a bi ‘an and was still unable to advance to the next level.

And Tang Haoran, an eight or nine – year – old child, who had only been in contact with cultivation for less than a year, was actually about to break through to Qi disciple Level 2 ...

When did cultivation become so easy?

Li Yifu felt that his Dao heart was about to waver ...

Xia ruofei’s mind was not on this. He thought for a while and asked,””Senior Li, I have a question ...”

“Please don’t call me senior ...” Li Yifu interrupted Xia ruofei with a bitter smile and said,”I don’t deserve the title ‘senior’ with my insignificant cultivation!” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“There’s no order in learning, but a senior is still a senior!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I would like to ask, what is the name of your cultivation technique?”

Li Yifu hesitated for a moment before saying,””My late father taught me this technique. It’s called the origin returning Scripture. It has a mental cultivation method and a palm technique.”

He had only revealed the name of the technique but not the secret of his cultivation. Besides, Xia ruofei’s cultivation was much higher than his, so he would not covet his incomplete technique. Hence, he told Xia ruofei without hesitation.

When Xia ruofei heard the three words “origin returning Scripture”, he immediately revealed a look of realization.

No wonder he felt that it was so familiar. It turned out that he had really seen this cultivation method before. Although there was a difference of one word in the name, there must have been some origin.

Xia ruofei immediately thought of a martial arts technique called the Guiyuan Scripture that he had once browsed. This martial arts technique included a set of palm techniques, a set of leg techniques, and a matching heart technique.

These cultivation techniques were directly injected into his mind through the human – shaped jade talisman, so he quickly found the contents of the cultivation techniques. After comparing the two, he found many similarities, but the palm technique Li Yifu used seemed to be a bit crude ...
