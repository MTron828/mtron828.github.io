Translator: 549690339

“Brother Xia, you were looking for me?” Lei Hu ran to Xia ruofei’s office and asked with a smile.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”Hu Zi, I’ll let pang Hao know later. Go to the finance department and get an advance of 200000 Yuan. Go back to the city immediately and rent a good nanny car. It’ll be best if it’s a Mercedes – Benz spint. Tomorrow, you’ll drive with me to Ganjiang province. I have to pick up a few people.”

Renting a car would definitely require a deposit. Xia ruofei did not know how much a deposit was needed for such a high – end nanny car, so he asked Lei Hu to bring 200000 first. If it was not enough, he would have to contact the company’s finance department at the last minute.

“Alright!” Lei Hu immediately said. Then, he asked curiously,”Brother Xia, who’s that important? You actually went to pick him up personally. ”

“She’s the widow of a martyr. Her deceased husband was an old squad leader of mine in the Army,”Xia ruofei replied.

When Lei Hu heard this, he was immediately filled with respect.

Xia ruofei then briefly told Lei Hu about old Luo and Lin Yue ‘E’s situation. Of course, he skipped the parts that involved military secrets.

Even though Lei Hu was a retired soldier, he did not have the authority to know.

In fact, if Xia ruofei had not gone through the proper procedures to be recalled back to the Army, he would not have had the authority to know even a little bit of information about the top – secret operation of lone wolf.

Lei Hu immediately said,””Brother Xia, I understand! In the future, US veterans will all be sister-in-law’s family!”

Xia ruofei nodded with relief and said,””Hurry up and get ready! Remember, the nanny car must be in good condition. Uncle Luo is old and in poor health. This trip will be a few hundred kilometers! We must ensure the comfort of the car. ”

“Don’t worry, brother Xia! I’ll definitely get it done properly!” Lei Hu patted his chest and promised. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

After Lei Hu left, Xia ruofei sat in the office for a while before going home. The company was running smoothly and the employees were used to him being the boss, so it didn’t really matter if he was there or not.

When they reached home, Hu Zi’s mother was still resting in her room. Xia ruofei went straight upstairs to her room.

He locked the door and windows, then took out the spirit map. With a thought, he went directly to the stone room in the mountain and sea realm in the spirit map space. He was ready to continue practicing the drawing of the human jade talisman.

Xia ruofei also knew that if he were to train at the Archean realm, he would have a lot of time.

However, he was even more aware of the principle that haste makes waste. The drawing of the human – shaped jade talisman required a high level of concentration. If he practiced for a long time, it might backfire and the effect would be bad.

In addition, there was also a Jade futon in the stone chamber of the mountain sea realm that could help one concentrate and speed up the recovery of one’s mental power. This futon was fixed to the stone bed and could not be moved.

Hence, Xia ruofei still chose to practice in the mountain sea realm.

In any case, he wasn’t in a hurry to cultivate. He had always held a kind of normal heart that let nature take its course.

Xia ruofei sat on the Jade futon on the stone bed and practiced for the entire afternoon. His progress was still slow.

Now he could barely draw less than half of the runes, and any more would greatly increase the error rate.

Moreover, his drawing speed was very slow and was far from reaching his requirements.

Xia ruofei didn’t just want to open the human – shaped jade talisman and obtain the first three levels of the “great Dao technique”.

He wanted to practice this rune to the point where he had memorized it by heart, and it would be best if he could instinctively draw it out in an instant.

This was the only way he could unleash the defensive power of the Jade talisman. It was also the only way he could engrave the talisman on a Jade carrier and make it into a protective talisman after he cultivated the “great Dao chant” in the future.

Xia ruofei wanted to give an amulet to Ling Qingxue, Hu Zi’s mother, Lin Qiao, and other close family and friends.

Although the progress was not too fast, Xia ruofei was not in a hurry. He looked at the time and it was almost time for dinner. So, he got down from the stone bed and left the medium.

During dinner, Xia ruofei told Hu Zi’s mother and Lin Qiao that he would be going out again tomorrow.

Lin Qiao complained that Xia ruofei was wild now and only knew how to go out all day. She even said that she was going to complain to Ling Qingxue.

Xia ruofei could only smile bitterly and explain the situation briefly. He promised that he would only be out for a day, and he would return on the same day.

After listening to Xia ruofei’s story, Hu Zi’s mother and Lin Qiao could not help but sigh. Lin Qiao’s attitude also took a 180 – degree turn and she strongly supported Xia ruofei.

It was because they could empathize with Lin Yue ‘E’s predicament.

In the past, Hu ‘er’s mother and Lin Qiao had also encountered this and that kind of difficulty, and it was their relatives who had sacrificed their lives for the country. This made them feel a natural sense of closeness to Lin Yue’ e, who they had never met.

After the meal, Xia ruofei took a walk around the farm and saw Lei Hu driving an 80 – 90% new Mercedes – Benz spant nanny van into the farm.

Lei Hu also saw Xia ruofei and the car stopped beside him.

“Brother Xia, I’m back!” Lei Hu stuck his head out of the driver’s seat and said,”this kind of high – end nanny van is really not easy to rent. I ran around the whole afternoon before I found a car rental company that offered this service. They only have one, but fortunately, the car is in good condition!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”thank you!” There might be no more food in the cafeteria, come to my house to eat! I’ll get Qiao’ er to cook some dumplings for you. ”
