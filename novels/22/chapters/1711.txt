Chapter 1712: Haoran’s breakthrough (1)

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”it’s not that serious. I just thought ... Can you not call me Grand – Master in front of outsiders in the future?” This ... This is a little too scary!”

Li Yifu was stunned for a moment before he said,”but ... You’re my senior granduncle!” How could this disciple dare to not ...”

“Stop, stop!” Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”I didn’t say that I’m not your Grand Master. I’m just saying that in the presence of outsiders, you have to change the way you address me. I don’t want others to think that I’m an old monster ...” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Li Yifu wanted to refuse, but he didn’t dare to disobey his grand uncle-master’s order. In the end, he could only ask somewhat unwillingly,””Senior granduncle, how should this disciple address you?”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”in the future, when there are outsiders, you can call me Mr. Xia!”

The title ‘Sir’ could be a social courtesy, but it could also be an honorific title. Such a title would not seem particularly abrupt outside. Li Yifu thought about it and felt that it was acceptable, so he nodded and said,””Yes, martial granduncle, this disciple will remember!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. Luckily, this Grand – disciple was not too old – fashioned. If he had insisted on not agreeing, he really could not do anything to him.

Give him a scolding with a straight face? He would kneel down and beg for forgiveness in minutes.

“It’s getting late,”said Xia ruofei.” Big brother Tang, please assign rooms for us. Let’s all go and rest!” By the way, help me find a quiet room. I want to guide Haoran’s cultivation. ”

Li Yifu could not help but show an envious look.

Xia ruofei had only given him a few words of advice, and he had broken through the bottleneck that had troubled him for decades. Tang Haoran could often receive Xia ruofei’s guidance. No wonder his cultivation had advanced so quickly.

Li Yifu wanted to listen to Xia ruofei’s guidance, but he also knew that it was a taboo. Since his senior granduncle did not take the initiative to bring him along, he should not even mention it.

Hence, Li Yifu could only look on enviously as Xia ruofei brought Tang Haoran back to the tea room.

Tang Yitian quickly ordered the servants to prepare guest rooms for everyone.

Li Yifu gradually calmed down and continued to consolidate his cultivation realm in the guest room.

Today’s experience made everyone’s brain feel a little overwhelmed. Tang Yitian and his wife were so excited that they couldn’t sleep. They were all talking about Tang Haoran in a low voice. To have a master like Xia ruofei was definitely Tang Haoran’s good fortune from his previous life. Xu Ziyuan was also shocked by the huge amount of information today. His brain was in a state of extreme excitement. On the other hand, Feng Jing’s mind was filled with questions. She could only ask Xia ruofei when she had the chance to be alone with him ...

Xia ruofei brought Tang Haoran into the tea room.

“Ya!” Tang Haoran said. Master, the spiritual crystal is still in my father’s safe!” Please wait a moment, I’ll go get it from my father!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”there’s no need to go through so much trouble!” I’ll use this first ...”

Xia ruofei put his hand into his pocket and took out the crystal from his spatial ring. It was the one he used during cultivation and had an abundant amount of spiritual Qi. He handed it to Tang Haoran.

“Thank you, master!” Tang Haoran grinned.

Xia ruofei brought Tang Haoran to sit cross – legged on the tatami. Then, he said,””Haoran, take this spiritual crystal and start your cultivation as usual. Don’t think about anything. The breakthrough will be a matter of course!”

“I’ll remember it, master!”Tang Haoran said with a serious face.

Xia ruofei smiled and patted Tang Haoran’s head.””Let’s begin! I’ll protect you from the side, so you can break through without worry!”

Tang Haoran nodded heavily. He held the spirit crystal in his hand and quickly entered a state of cultivation. Xia ruofei sat cross – legged beside him and observed his condition calmly.

There was no doubt about Tang Haoran’s talent, especially when the pure yang attribute cultivation method was especially suitable for his physique. Now that he had the spirit crystal, which was an almost inexhaustible source of spiritual energy for him at his current stage, his cultivation would naturally be more effective with half the effort.

Time passed by. After about two hours, Xia ruofei’s closed eyes suddenly opened. He looked at Tang Haoran.

That was because Xia ruofei had already felt the obvious change in Tang Haoran’s aura. It was the sign of a breakthrough.

Tang Haoran, who was immersed in his cultivation, did not notice anything. He continued to practice his cultivation method over and over again.

After another ten minutes or so, the true energy in Tang Haoran’s body seemed to have suddenly become active. Tang Haoran, who was in the state of cultivation, could not help but show a pained expression on his small face. His body even swayed slightly, but he quickly stabilized.

“Concealment of spirit and Qi, break through with all your might!” Xia ruofei’s calm voice rang in Tang Haoran’s ears, calming his unstable emotions.

He steadily controlled his genuine Qi to break through the bottleneck again and again until a moment, as if a slight cracking sound was heard, and then he suddenly felt enlightened.

In the past, his true Qi felt like it was moving through a narrow waterway. Now, it felt like he had suddenly arrived in a wide canal. The thick true Qi accumulated in his dantian was also released in an instant, and began to circulate rapidly in his meridians.

Xia ruofei had been using his spiritual power to monitor Tang Haoran’s condition. Seeing this, he relaxed slightly and said to himself,”Success!
