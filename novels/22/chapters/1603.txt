Chapter 1605: Betrothal gift (1)

Translator: 549690339

Du Qinghong’s words silenced the room.

Even Xia ruofei could not help but be stunned. He did not expect that after the formation patterns were carved on the black jade carving, it would be worth so much in the eyes of this experienced President du!

Another thing that shocked Xia ruofei was that du Qinghong did not look like a businessman. He was the president of a metaphysics society, but he had such a rich family property. He dared to bid 100 million without even blinking. His net worth must be much more than that.

Actually, Xia ruofei did not know much about du Qinghong’s business. In his early years, du Qinghong had been living in Hong Kong, where the metaphysics of Feng Shui was highly respected. Those famous Feng Shui masters were all distinguished guests of the rich. Du Qinghong was very famous in this line of work, and the reward for helping once was very generous. It was not an exaggeration to say that his family was rich.

In addition, du Qinghong’s net worth was not as much as Xia ruofei had imagined. Xia ruofei had underestimated the attraction of Dharma artifacts to an authentic Feng Shui Master like du Qinghong. In fact, if du Qinghong really wanted to buy the bell tripod jade carving at the price of 100 million, his assets would be reduced by at least half, and he might have to sell some real estate.

However, du Qinghong did not hesitate at all.

Ling Xiaotian and his daughter were also stunned. The value of this jade carving of the Zhong Yuan had far exceeded their imagination.

One hundred million Yuan in cash, even a rich man like Ling Xiaotian couldn’t help but be tempted at that moment.

However, he quickly said,”old du, don’t even think about it!” There’s no room for discussion ...”

With that, Ling Xiaotian stuffed the Jade statue of the bell into Xia ruofei’s hands without hesitation and said,””Ruofei, I thought that this Jade statue would be worth at most a few million, or at most a few million. I didn’t expect it to be so valuable. In that case, I can’t accept it ...”

However, Xia ruofei did not take it. Instead, he let go of it. Ling Xiaotian was so scared that he held on to it tightly, afraid that he would drop it and smash it into pieces. This was a hundred million Yuan! Even if they were all hundred – Yuan bills, they weighed more than a ton!

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”uncle Ling, I’ve never taken back the things I’ve given out!” Besides, this Jade statue isn’t worth that much money ...”

Before Xia ruofei could finish his sentence, du Qinghong glared at him and said,””Little Xia, are you questioning my taste? Why don’t we make a bet? The three mountains mystics society will be in charge of organizing an auction for this jade carving. If the final bid is lower than 100 million, I’ll pay you back!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but smile bitterly. ‘Aren’t you trying to ruin my reputation?’ I’m just saying this to uncle Ling, do you have to take it so seriously? Besides, you’ve already offered a price of 100 million. Even if no one wants it, you’ll still buy it for 100 million, right?

Ling Xiaotian couldn’t help but laugh when he heard this. He said,””Old du, it seems like you really like this jade carving!”

“Of course,” du Qinghong quickly said,”old Ling, have you changed your mind? As long as you’re willing to sell it, I’ll immediately raise the money to pay you. I won’t delay a single cent!”

Ling Xiaotian quickly waved his hand and said,”stop, stop!” I’m not planning to sell it ... No, I’m not planning to take it ... How can I accept such an expensive gift from a child?”

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly and said,”uncle Ling, aren’t you making things difficult for me?” This is just a small token of my appreciation ...”

“You’re too kind ...” Ling Xiao tiankai laughed,”how about this is your betrothal gift? If that’s the case, I’ll accept it!”

Ling Qingxue’s face turned red and she said,””Dad ...”

Ling Xiaotian laughed and said,”Qingxue, what’s there to be embarrassed about?” And I’m telling you, if this is the betrothal gift, I’ll prepare double the dowry for you when you get married according to the customs of Min Nan ...”

Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but feel embarrassed. She stomped her feet and said,””You’re getting more and more unreliable ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”sure!” As long as uncle Ling is willing to accept this gift, you can call it a betrothal gift!”

Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but pinch Xia ruofei and said,””I didn’t agree to marry you!”

“But I didn’t say I’m going to marry her now!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”just take it as an advance betrothal gift! You’re going to marry me sooner or later anyway!”

Ling Xiaotian was comforted by the situation and laughed,””There’s nothing wrong with RUO Fei’s words! If that’s the case ... Then I must have this Jade statue ...”

“Definitely!” Xia ruofei quickly struck while the iron was hot.”Unless you don’t agree to me being with Qingxue!”

“Hahaha! Then I’ll accept it!” Ling Xiaotian wasn’t a pretentious person, so he accepted the Jade carving.

He then continued,”but, ruofei, you’ve given me a big problem!” This thing was a little hot! Whether it’s at home or in the office, I have to be on guard against theft at all times. It’s a treasure worth a hundred million!” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Du Qinghong was also envious of Ling Xiaotian. He was also sighing at himself for not having a daughter as beautiful as Ling Qingxue. Otherwise, he might have been able to fight for a son – in – Law!

Xia ruofei did not know that du Qinghong had such a ridiculous thought. He smiled at Ling Xiaotian and said,””Uncle Ling, please don’t put it in the safe! Then it won’t have any effect at all ...”
