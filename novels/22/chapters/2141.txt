2142 Array (1)

Actually, there was no need for Puyol to say it. When Xia ruofei first saw the pool, he already had the answer in his heart.

He said indifferently,”very good!” Puyol, you’ve completed your mission. You can return now ... This is your reward!”

With that, Xia ruofei took out a pile of biscuits, bread, Coke and other food and drinks from his backpack. He even gave two packs of cigarettes. Puyol’s eyes lit up when he saw it. He even temporarily forgot about the fear he had for the pool and the Python in it.

“Thank you!” He said excitedly. Thank you, Daoist immortal ...”

Puyol hurriedly put all the things that Xia ruofei had given him into his backpack. He even carefully put the two packs of cigarettes into his pocket as if he was holding two precious diamonds.

“Oh, right. Before I go back, I don’t want anyone to appear within a 500 – meter radius of this pool, including you,” Xia ruofei said indifferently.

“Understood!” Pyol quickly replied. Understood! Don’t worry, Daoist immortal! Even if you asked us to come, we wouldn’t dare to come! After I go back, I’ll restrain my subordinates and stop them from entering the forest to hunt without your order!”

Xia ruofei didn’t want to be disturbed by others, so he marked out a forbidden area with the pool as the center and a radius of 500 meters. Puyol had sealed off the entire forest. Of course, Xia ruofei was happy to be in peace.

He nodded with satisfaction and said,”yes!” Then you can go back first!”

Puyol did not want to stay here for a long time. He always had a feeling of fear and trepidation by the quiet pool.

After Xia ruofei spoke, he felt as if he had been pardoned. After turning around and taking two steps, he turned back and carefully said,””Divine immortal, please be careful. That Python is really scary. If it’s not necessary, please don’t provoke it ...”

Puyol still had a glimmer of hope that this time, the “God” would take him away from this deserted island and return to human society.

This was much more important than the biscuits and drinks in his backpack.

If the “Daoist immortal” was accidentally buried in the snake’s stomach, then wouldn’t his little hope be in vain?

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I see. Thank you for your reminder!” Puyol, you should leave ...”

Although Xia ruofei’s tone was gentle, Puyol’s heart skipped a beat. He quickly said,””Yes! Yes! Yes!”

Then, he hurriedly turned around and went into the forest. Soon, he was far away from this area and quickly headed in the direction of the camp, not even daring to look back.

Xia ruofei’s spiritual power had been spreading out to Xuanji. Next, she needed to get close to the pool to observe the array boundary at a close distance. She even needed to make some attempts to prevent Puyol from coming back and secretly peeking from the side, although the possibility of this was extremely low.

After confirming that Puyol had left without looking back, Xia ruofei did not approach the pool immediately.

He immediately took out some Jade and other materials for setting up the array from the spirit map space. He set up some alarm arrays in a radius of about ten meters around the pool. Once the array was touched, he would be able to detect it immediately.

There wasn’t even the sound of insects nearby. Xia ruofei had used his spiritual power to investigate carefully. It was indeed dead silent. There weren’t even insects, let alone hares, foxes, and other animals. If the array was triggered, it was basically the survivors in the camp who had broken in.

After setting up the realm formation, Xia ruofei carried his backpack with one hand and carefully approached the pool.

When he was two to three meters away from the pool, Xia ruofei threw his backpack on the ground. Then, he kept his mental power alert and circulated his genuine Qi in his body according to the main points of the great Dao Sutra. He continued to move forward carefully.

In this state, if there was any danger, Xia ruofei would be able to react in time and burst out with his strongest attack.

In fact, when Xia ruofei’s spiritual power probed in the direction of the pool, he had already discovered something different. When he was one meter away from the pool, his spiritual power encountered an invisible barrier and could not penetrate it at all.

There was nothing there, and he could see everything in the pool. On the other hand, his spiritual power, which was difficult to block with material obstacles, could not break through at all.

If Xia ruofei closed his eyes and used his spiritual power to look, he would not be able to find the pool. He would only sense that there was a blind spot in that direction.

It was a strange situation, but it was within Xia ruofei’s expectations.

He walked to the invisible barrier step by step and tried to reach out.

A gentle resistance came and Xia ruofei’s palm could not move forward at all.

He injected genuine Qi into his arm and gradually increased his strength.

That invisible resistance was also increasing at the same time. With the use of true Qi, this kind of force could even move a truck. However, in the face of this invisible resistance, it was completely useless.

The resistance was like water waves. It was not hard at all, but it was very tough. No matter how much strength Xia ruofei used, the array only caved in a little. When Xia ruofei removed his hand, it immediately returned to its original state. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Xia ruofei was not unfamiliar with this situation. In the cave in the spirit map space, there were several protective barriers like this. His human and earth talismans were taken out of the barriers.
