Chapter 1286: Returning to the farm (2)

Translator: 549690339

Since it was not listed, the option reward was just a castle in the air. It was a pie drawn out of thin air and had no meaning.

Since there were no shares or options, he could only consider the bonus reward.

However, this was only Xia ruofei’s initial idea. He would have to discuss it with Feng Jing first.

When they returned to the farm, it was already past lunchtime.

Hence, Xia ruofei asked ye Lingyun to come to the small villa with them. After rummaging through the refrigerator for a long time, they finally found some dumplings. Thus, the two of them settled their lunch.

However, the dumplings still tasted pretty good.

These were not frozen dumplings bought from the supermarket, but made by Hu Zi’s mother. She had specially bought some organic mountain Black pork from Sam’s Club and made them with Taoyuan vegetables.

Hu ‘Zi’s mother made a lot of dumplings at once, then put fifteen in each bag and put them in the refrigerator.

Xia ruofei would cook some occasionally, but the dumplings were not finished even after a long time.

After lunch, Xia ruofei asked ye Lingyun to go back and rest.

He also went upstairs to take a shower and then took a short nap. When it was time for work in the afternoon, he got up and changed his clothes, then went straight to the complex.

Xia ruofei arrived at the door of Feng Jing’s office and waved his hand to stop her assistant, Liu Qian, who had stood up to greet him. He went straight to the door and knocked lightly.

“Please enter!” Feng Rao said loudly.

Xia ruofei pushed the door open and walked in. Feng Jing was looking down at some documents. Without lifting her head, she asked,””What is it?”

She waited for a few seconds but did not hear any sound. She looked up in confusion and saw Xia ruofei.

Feng Rao quickly stood up and glared at Xia ruofei.””Chairman, how old are you? why are you still playing such childish tricks? Besides, why are you walking so quietly? I was almost scared to death!” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I was so close to walking in!” You’re too engrossed in your work!”

Then, Xia ruofei glanced at the documents on the table and asked with a smile,””What are you looking at?”

Just as Feng Rao was about to speak, she saw Liu Qian walk in with a cup of freshly brewed tea, so she shut her mouth.

“Please have some tea, Chairman!” Liu Qian placed the teacup on the coffee table in front of Xia ruofei and bowed slightly before leaving Feng Jing’s office.

After Liu Qian closed the door, Feng Rao said,””I’m watching ...”

“Wait! Let me make a guess!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”you’re acting so mysterious as if you’re meeting an underground party ... I guess it’s an agreement with the black group!”

“It’s so boring to guess right on the first try!”Feng Rao pouted.

Xia ruofei laughed and took a sip of the tea. He then praised,””Good tea! This should be our company’s own Da Hong Pao, right?”

“Mm! After Ling Yun was done, he gave some to the company’s senior executives. ” Feng Jing said jokingly,”Chairman, we’re not encroaching on the company’s interests, are we?”

“Hey! Which is which!” Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.”As long as you don’t carry the tea leaves in a gunny sack and transport them home, it’s fine. How much tea can our own people drink?”

“These tea leaves are not cheap!” Feng Jing said on purpose.

“I can afford it no matter how expensive it is!” Xia ruofei said unhappily,”let’s make it a rule in the future! Director and above would enjoy it! Implement the rationing system!”

“The chairman is wise!” Feng Rao said with a smile.

“Let’s talk business!” Xia ruofei asked,”has the Blake group made the decision?”

“Mm! We’ve discussed with them according to your instructions. You’ve already made the decision in the early stage, so the negotiations went smoothly. ” Feng ke said.

She knew that Xia ruofei should be most concerned about the effective period of the agreement, so she immediately said,””I’ve signed the contract with them for five years, and the other terms are basically as you said. I’ve had the company’s Legal Affairs review the contract, and there are no problems, so I signed it on behalf of the company.”

Xia ruofei touched his chin.”Five years isn’t a short time, but we won’t lose anything. The price is fluctuating anyway ... Five years it is!”

Feng Rao nodded and smiled. “There’s another interesting thing!”

Then, she stood up and walked back to her desk. She took out a stack of newspapers from the drawer and handed it to Xia ruofei.

“What is it?” Xia ruofei felt strange.

However, he understood after a quick glance that these newspapers all had one thing in common, and that was a joint statement made by the black group and the black family, which terminated all of George Blake’s positions in the company and stripped him of his status as the heir of the family.

Xia ruofei quickly looked at the banner and said with a smile,””They’re all foreign newspapers!”

“Yeah!” Feng Rao nodded. The black family asked someone to send this over yesterday. I think the black group immediately issued this statement as soon as we signed the contract. ”

Xia ruofei scratched his head.”This bunch of big – nosed people ...” He said.”They won’t make up a few fake newspapers to fool me, will they?”

Feng Rao was stunned for a moment before she said, not knowing whether to laugh or cry,”Chairman, how could that be possible? These newspapers are all electronic, and I went to their official website to take a look at the electronic newspapers. They are all real, and the black group did not play any tricks. ”

“Then they’re smart!” Xia ruofei said,”in that case, I’ll prepare some goods for them!”

“Anyway, you’ll be in charge of this matter. I won’t care so much.” Feng Jing said,”I was thinking about how to keep it a secret. If it really doesn’t work, I’ll just go to the bank and rent a safe. If I leave it here and it’s accidentally seen by others, we’ll be violating the contract if word gets out.”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”leave it to me!” I’ll keep it safe. ”

“That’s great, I was just worried about this hot potato!” Feng Rao handed the contract and the supplementary agreement to Xia ruofei without a second word.

Naturally, Xia ruofei was prepared to put them into the spirit map space when he returned. Which bank in the world would have a safe as safe and convenient as the spirit map space?

“Everything is normal in other aspects, right?” Xia ruofei asked.

“It’s normal!” Feng Jing giggled and asked,”Chairman, do you feel no sense of accomplishment? You’ve been away from the company for so many days, but it seems like the company’s operation is no different from before ...”

Xia ruofei glanced at Feng Rao and said,””President Feng, if you didn’t have such a sharp tongue, we could still be good friends ...”

Feng Rao couldn’t help but giggle.

After the joke, Feng Jing quickly returned to the main topic.””Chairman, there’s something I need to report to you.”

“What is it?”

“Yesterday, the boss of bojun real estate, Wang Dongliang, contacted me ...” Feng Rao said.

“Bojun real estate?” Xia ruofei thought for a long time before he asked with uncertainty,”you mean the owners of the first to ninth floors of our headquarters?”

“Yes! The renovation for our new headquarters has already started, and bojun real estate is right below us. This CEO Wang only just found out that the few floors above have changed owners. ” Feng ke said.

“Then, he called you ...” Xia ruofei thought for a moment and continued,”could it be that he wants us to take over the remaining nine floors?”

Xia ruofei vaguely remembered that Feng Jing had mentioned that bojun real estate’s capital chain was not very stable when she had recommended this building to him. At that time, Feng Jing had used this as an advantage. After all, if bojun real estate was not doing well, it was very likely that they would sell these properties.

At that time, he could put the entire building under the name of the Paradise company, or even change the name of the building to the “paradise building”, and no one would be able to object.

Feng Jing nodded.”That’s what CEO Wang meant. He beat around the bush for a long time and said a lot of things that were off topic. In the end, he hinted that he wanted to cash out the properties and asked if we were interested in taking them.”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,””Of course I’m interested! Let’s take down the 1st and 9th floors!”
