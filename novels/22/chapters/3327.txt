3328 The appearance of the Mirage beast (2)

Xia ruofei observed his surroundings with rapt attention, trying to find a flaw in this illusion from the angle of the array Dao.

At this moment, a feeling of fear suddenly welled up in his heart.

This was Xia ruofei’s natural sense of danger. His expression changed. Without hesitation, he stepped on his flying sword and flew into the sky.

With a whoosh, a black shadow flashed under Xia ruofei’s feet and quickly disappeared into the void as if it had never been there.

Xia ruofei had been flying upwards and did not see the black shadow clearly.

Of course, he had been constantly releasing his spiritual power to maintain a high state of alert. However, just like before, his spiritual Power’s detection had completely lost its effect, and he couldn’t find any trace of the black shadow at all.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but frown. If that was a Mirage beast, it would be much harder to deal with than a Star Beast.

The task on the third floor of the trial Pagoda only required the killing of 30 Mirage beasts, even if it was doubled.

If the middle – Level Mirage beasts could reach such a level, it would indeed be difficult to kill 30 of them.

Xia ruofei’s brain was spinning fast as he thought of a way to deal with the Mirage beast.

This Mirage beast came and went without a trace, and it was best at setting up illusions. If there was no way to break it, it was possible that it would be trapped in this illusion for a long time. By then, not to mention four hours, even 20 hours would not be enough. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

In theory, if one wanted to see through the illusion, one must have a strong mind. From this perspective, Yang Liu, mu Hua and the other older generation cultivators had an advantage over Xia ruofei. Even Chen Xuan had an advantage over Xia ruofei. After all, they had cultivated for a long time and their minds were stronger.

However, Xia ruofei also knew that since the Almighty who set up the trial space had designed such a mission, it meant that there must be a way to deal with the Mirage beast. He had to find a way as soon as possible.

Everything was difficult in the beginning, but as long as the first Mirage beast was killed, the rest would be much easier.

Xia ruofei suddenly had a flash of inspiration. The Mirage beast could easily set up illusions, but it did not seem to have any destructive power. That was why it had personally attacked Xia ruofei. If that was the case, could he use the ‘poison against poison’?

In other words, he had set up a small illusion array around himself. Once the Shen beast appeared, he might fall into Xia ruofei’s illusion array.

As long as he could control the Mirage beast, the next step would be much easier.

Now, Xia ruofei regretted setting up the trap & kill array in advance. The trap & kill array could not be used now. Otherwise, it would be more effective to set up a trap & kill array now than a simple illusion array.

It seemed that he had been too cautious just now. Xia ruofei could not help but smile bitterly.

However, it was a little troublesome to prepare the materials for the trap and kill array. However, it was relatively easy for Xia ruofei to set up a simple illusion array.

He knew that the Mirage beast must be observing his every move in the dark and waiting for an opportunity to launch the fiercest attack. Therefore, he didn’t dare to expose the spirit map space or take out the spirit map scroll.

Thus, he could only prepare this illusory formation in the outside world.

Fortunately, simple illusory formations were not too difficult for Xia ruofei. Besides, he had mastered several illusory formations with decent power, so it was not too complicated to prepare.

Xia ruofei quickly took out the necessary materials for the formation from the spirit map space, mainly some blank Jade talismans and spiritual stones.

Xia ruofei sat down on the spot and started to draw on the blank jade talisman.

Of course, he didn’t dare to let his guard down at any moment, so he could only multitask, drawing array runes and being on guard in case the Mirage beast suddenly appeared.

Xia ruofei’s spiritual power was much stronger than before. It was not difficult for him to do two things at once.

Although Xia ruofei did not have a carving knife in his hand, he could still accurately carve the array patterns into the inside of the blank jade talisman.

Among the illusory formations that he had mastered, the one he was currently inscribing was of medium difficulty and relatively powerful. The entire set of illusory formations only needed to inscribe four Jade talismans.

Xia ruofei’s fingers moved swiftly and many array patterns were carved on the blank jade talisman.

After about ten minutes, the entire illusory formation was completed. This speed was something that Xia ruofei did not even dare to imagine before.

The four Jade talismans didn’t seem to have changed on the surface, but if one used mental power to examine them, one would discover that they were already densely covered with mysterious array patterns.

In these ten minutes, the Shen beast did not appear even once. Xia ruofei was worried that the Shen beast would come out to cause trouble at the critical moment of carving the array. But now, it seemed like he had worried for nothing.

After Xia ruofei checked the Jade talismans, he waved his hand and threw them out.

The Jade talismans landed accurately in their respective positions. At the same time, Xia ruofei threw out a simple array control core. The array patterns on it corresponded with the array patterns in the Jade talismans. There was a groove in the middle of the control core, and an unused spiritual crystal was embedded in it.

Xia ruofei’s spiritual energy touched the core of the array and the array started to work. The energy of the spiritual crystal was drawn by the core and was continuously transmitted to the entire array through the array patterns.

A ripple seemed to flash in the air.

Xia ruofei checked and knew that the formation had been successfully activated.

He heaved a sigh of relief. He had to prepare four talismans and a control core in such a tight time. His efficiency was already extremely high. The entire process had only destroyed a blank jade talisman because his hand had trembled slightly. Everything else had gone smoothly and he had not wasted much time.

He was more worried that the Mirage beast would not appear again. If the Mirage beast wanted to trap Xia ruofei and wait outside the illusion, Xia ruofei would not be able to do anything to it.

After Xia ruofei had set up the illusion formation, he could only wait at his original spot.

He deliberately made an anxious look, and at the same time, it seemed that his guard had relaxed a lot.

The Mirage beast had been observing Xia ruofei’s movements. After a while, Xia ruofei immediately felt a gust of wind behind him. He instinctively leaped forward and turned his waist to look in the air. A black shadow had rushed straight into the range of the illusion array that had just been set up.

After entering the range of the array, the Mirage beast’s body suddenly froze.

Xia ruofei finally got a good look at the Mirage beast. It looked quite cute and looked a bit like a rabbit, but its ears were shorter than a rabbit ‘s. Its body was also furry. Compared to a Star Beast, it was much smaller and not fierce at all.

If it was in the secular world, such an appearance would be very deceptive. At least, it could gain the love of a bunch of young ladies.

However, Xia ruofei had experienced the power of the Shen beast. He was still in the illusion and could not find any flaws. Hence, he did not dare to judge a book by its cover. He thought that this little guy looked harmless and let his guard down.

After the Mirage beast entered the illusory formation, its eyes were dazed, and its footsteps seemed to be drunk.

Xia ruofei didn’t know what the Mirage beast had experienced in the illusory formation. However, the theory of all illusory formations was similar. The scene that the people in the formation saw was actually based on their own judgment.

Hence, Xia ruofei had no way of knowing what the Shen beast saw in the illusory formation. However, he could see that the Shen beast’s face revealed an extremely frightened look, and its eyes suddenly turned red. It originally looked like a rabbit, but when its eyes turned red, it became even more like a little white rabbit.

At this moment, Xia ruofei saw the scene in front of him start to crack bit by bit. The tropical island – like environment suddenly fell apart, and he was back to the small hill.

Although the illusory formation was not very effective in trapping the enemy, the Mirage beast was obviously immersed in the illusion and could not extricate itself. It could not maintain its own illusion and let Xia ruofei escape easily.

Xia ruofei looked at the Mirage beast in the array. The qushuang flying sword and the blue immortal sword floated up at the same time and stabbed towards the Mirage beast.
