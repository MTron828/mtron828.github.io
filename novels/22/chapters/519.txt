Chapter 520: Make things big (3)

The old couple had not paid the fine yet, and the two pieces of cake that Houton had used to make a fuss about were still on the counter.

Smith’s expression turned even uglier.

If the White assistant’s complaint just now was considered insignificant, then these two incidents could basically be confirmed as blatant discrimination. This was a big scandal for the entire customs. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Moreover, he had the support of that gentleman behind him, so it was very likely that the matter would be blown up.

The White assistant turned on the phone’s recording function and recorded everything the girl said. Then he said,””MA ‘am, I’ve recorded everything you’ve said. Can you and these two old men please leave me your contact information? In the future, the court may need your testimonies. ”

The Chinese girl took out a piece of paper and wrote down her phone number without saying anything. At the same time, she translated what the White assistant had just said to the two old men. The two old men were also filled with righteous indignation, so they did not hesitate to write down their daughter’s contact information.

They were going to live in Australia for a few months, and if necessary, they would be very happy to testify in court.

Smith saw that things were getting out of control and quickly said,””Mr. Jorgensen, our Customs Department is very sorry for what happened today. We will definitely conduct a thorough investigation. If hourton is involved in racial discrimination, we will definitely deal with him severely. What do you think ...”

Houton’s brain was already a little overwhelmed. He had gone overboard in the past, but nothing had happened. What was going on today? why did Mr. Smith look like the sky was going to collapse? Who was the other party?

Tang He’s white assistant, Jorgensen, said coldly,””Mr. Smith, I’m just following orders. Everything is up to the boss to decide, but I still have to remind Mr. Hutton to be prepared to go to court!”

“This ...”

After Jorgensen finished speaking, he glanced coldly at Horton and turned to walk out.

Smith quickly called for someone to take over Houton’s job. Then, he glared at Houton and pulled him along as he quickly caught up.

The customs officer who took over Horton’s job naturally didn’t dare to cause any more trouble. The old couple and the Chinese girl successfully passed through the customs and dragged their luggage out.

In the airport lobby.

Xia ruofei and Tang He were chatting casually when Jorgensen, the White assistant, came back quickly and reported the matter to Tang He.

After hearing Jorgensen’s words, Xia ruofei and Tang He snorted at the same time. Tang He even smacked the chair heavily and said,””Jorgensen, contact Lucas immediately and ask him to form a team of lawyers to file a lawsuit against this hourton! I don’t care about the money, I only want the result, and that is to make this villain lose all his reputation and fortune!”

“Yes, Mr. Tang!” Jorgensen said.

Lucas was one of the most famous lawyers in Australia. Lucas’s law firm was also one of the top five in Australia, and he had a strong team of lawyers working for him.

For such a God in the legal world to take action personally and file a lawsuit against hourton was like using a cannon to kill a mosquito, or using a sledgehammer to kill a chicken.

Even if there was no evidence at all, Lucas’s team could win the lawsuit in various ways, let alone the fact that there was conclusive evidence of Horton’s racism. At the very least, it would drag Houton into a long lawsuit, putting him under huge pressure every day, and eventually exhausting him.

“Mr. Tang, I’ll pay half of the legal fees!” Xia ruofei grinned.

Tang He was stunned for a moment, then he laughed and said,””Xia, there’s no need for that. Lucas and I are old friends, and he’s also the chief legal counsel of shengbang group in Australia. His lawyer fees are settled with our company on a regular basis.”

Xia ruofei shook his head and said,”since this started because of me, I have to do my part!” Mr. Tang, I hope that this lawsuit can be blown up as much as possible. It’s best if it can affect the whole of Australia and even the whole world. Only then can we make those who discriminate against China fear us and know that we Chinese are not to be bullied! At the very least, they won’t dare to be so unscrupulous when they face our fellow countrymen in the future. ”

Tang He nodded in agreement and said,””I also have the same intention!”

Although Tang He was already an American citizen, he had always thought that he was a Chinese man in his bones. His patriotism had not changed because of the change in nationality.

Just as everyone was talking about the lawsuit, Smith and Houton quickly caught up. At the exit, the old couple and the Chinese girl also dragged their luggage out.

Horton’s fat body was a very eye – catching target. The old couple and the Chinese lady noticed him immediately and also pushed their luggage cart towards Xia ruofei.
