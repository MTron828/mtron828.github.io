2517 Superstar cultivation plan (1)

Wu Lei thought for a while and said,”first of all, compared to the Chinese Super League, La Liga’s pace is much faster. I’m not used to it ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.”I can tell. You didn’t take the ball much today. You basically just shifted the ball. Although you didn’t break through often in the Chinese Super League, you were still very calm when you took the ball and protected it.”

Wu Lei was a little embarrassed and said,””The other side is coming up too quickly. I’m worried that I’ll lose the ball, so it’s better to deal with it as soon as possible and then run for the opening.”

“It’s not that this way of playing is bad ...” Xia ruofei muttered to himself.”Of course, I’m just saying this from the perspective of a fan! You’re a professional. I think ... Since you’ve just joined the team, there might not be any problems with this kind of play. But if you play for a long time, your teammates may not pass the ball to you much, and it will be more difficult for you to get opportunities. After all, you can’t always rely on running through gaps or even running out to score a goal! Moreover, if your teammates didn’t have confidence in you, even if you had an opening, they might not pass the ball to you. Instead, they might choose a more secure passing route. Also, even if you get the chance to shoot, it’s ...”

“You also often miss a single blade, right?” Wu Lei scratched his head in embarrassment and said,”actually, the ability to seize opportunities in front of the door...How should I put it? “Some people on the internet say that my psychological quality is not good, but I don’t admit it. In fact, I’m not too nervous every time there’s a single – handed ball. Maybe my basic skills are a little worse, and my left and right feet are unbalanced. I could have used my left foot to shoot directly, but I wanted to adjust to my right foot every time. As a result, the other side would fill in the position as soon as I adjusted, and there would be no shooting angle ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”it seems like you’re quite objective about yourself.” Have you thought about how to solve this?”

Wu Lei smiled bitterly and said,”the gap is all – Round. To be honest, I should be a very good striker in the Chinese Super League, but in La Liga, or in the whole of Europe, a striker like me is relatively ordinary. I may be able to play in a small and medium – sized club like RCD Espanyol, but my competitiveness is limited. After all, I’m 27 years old this year. A lot of things have been set in stone, and the room for improvement is limited.”

“Then let me share my opinion?” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Please speak!” Wu Lei quickly said.

“You don’t have to be so polite.” Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”I think you have a problem that needs to be solved, and that is your physical resistance! You’re too thin now. Your body may be enough in the Chinese Super League, but it’s definitely not enough in European football. You can’t hold the ball if you can’t handle the physical confrontation, and you fall when someone touches you. The more you can’t hold the ball, the less confidence you have. That’s why, like today’s game, you don’t have time to think about what’s more reasonable when you receive the ball, and you just pass it out. ”

Wu Lei nodded in agreement and said, “That’s right! That’s right! In fact, my first breakthrough in the first half would have passed if I were in the Chinese Super League. The other side didn’t even have the chance to make a tactical foul. But today, I was put down by someone, so my confidence was more or less affected in the later games. ”

“I’ll definitely do more strength training,” Wu Lei continued.”The coach also said that I’m too weak and need to get stronger.”

“Mm! However, the training must also be targeted and scientific. You can’t lose your quick – witted advantage while you’re still strong after training. That’s not worth it. ” Xia ruofei said.

“Yes, the fitness coach will develop a specific training plan.” Wu Lei nodded and said. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”I can help you train. It won’t conflict with the plan made by your fitness coach, and it won’t affect your normal training. It should be able to improve your physical fitness quickly. Are you interested?”

When Wu Lei heard this, he said almost without thinking,””I’m interested! Of course I’m interested!”

After Xia ruofei had helped Wu Lei with his rehabilitation, Wu Lei had developed a blind trust in Xia ruofei. As long as Xia ruofei asked for it, he would subconsciously believe that there was no problem. So, he agreed almost without thinking.

“Don’t you want to know the details of the training?”Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

“The training that President Xia is doing for me is definitely the most suitable for me. There’s no need to ask!” Wu Lei said directly.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”sure!” My training is actually very simple. You just need to follow me and do a movement. It’s a bit like yoga, but it only looks like it. In fact, it’s completely different. ”

The training that Xia ruofei wanted to help Wu Lei with was actually the few movements of the little golden man that he had learned from the stone tablet in the spirit map space.

This was a set of body cultivation techniques. Xia ruofei had already started to practice it before he got the great Dao technique.

Xia ruofei had experienced it himself and knew the magical effect of this body – refining technique. The first set of movements was enough to improve Wu Lei’s physique. If he trained for a long time, Wu Lei’s physical fitness would be stronger than many European players.

What was even more valuable was that the body – tempering technique of the little golden man improved the body in all aspects. If Wu Lei practiced this, not only would he not lose his body’s flexibility, but his speed would also become faster as his physical quality improved. By then, Wu Lei’s strength would definitely increase by a large margin.
