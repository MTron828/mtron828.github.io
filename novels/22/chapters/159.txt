Xia ruofei was a little embarrassed as he said,””I can’t ask for more, but I still have something to do today. I hope I can have the honor tomorrow!” Xia ruofei was indeed busy. The auction was going to start at night. He had asked MA Xiong to come to the hotel in the afternoon. He said that he had something to talk to him about. In fact, he wanted to talk to MA Xiong about the truffles. Before that, Xia ruofei still had some preparation work to do. Monica looked at Xia ruofei and smiled.””Not an excuse?” “Of course not!” Xia ruofei said,”give me your phone number! I’ll look for you tomorrow!” Then, Xia ruofei smiled and added,””Actually, I wanted to take the opportunity to ask for her phone number!” Monica laughed. She took out a business card from her bag and handed it to Xia ruofei.”This is my phone number from China. I’ll be in Shen Cheng city until the day after tomorrow. I’ll be waiting for your call!” Xia ruofei took the business card and made an “OK” gesture. “I’m also looking forward to having dinner with you!” The two of them walked out of the gym and said goodbye to each other at the entrance. Monica looked at Xia ruofei’s back as he walked towards the Presidential Suite’s elevator. A strange light flashed in her beautiful eyes. She was getting more and more interested in this mysterious Eastern young man. Xia ruofei returned to the Presidential Suite and took a bath in the Super – Large Jacuzzi. After changing his clothes, Xia ruofei left the hotel alone. He didn’t use the hotel’s Rolls – Royce Phantom, because he needed to avoid people’s eyes and ears for this trip. Xia ruofei strolled around shencheng for about an hour. When he returned to the hotel, he was already carrying two plastic boxes in his hands. He had found an empty place and taken them out from the spirit map space. The truffles that he was going to auction tonight were in the boxes. The reason why Xia ruofei went through so much trouble was naturally out of careful consideration. There were surveillance cameras everywhere in the hotel. If Xia ruofei had taken the truffle out of the Presidential Suite, MA Xiong would have easily found out that Xia ruofei’s truffle had appeared out of thin air if he had checked the surveillance cameras. Although the possibility was low, Xia ruofei did not dare to be careless when it came to his biggest secret, the spirit map scroll. If he had gone out for a walk and brought it back, everything would make sense. Back in the Presidential Suite, Xia ruofei placed the two tidying boxes in the large refrigerator in the suite to try to keep the truffles fresh. MA Xiong arrived at Xia ruofei’s room at around four in the afternoon. Ma Zhiming was also with him. As for Tian Huixin, Huan Huan, and Lu You, they did not appear. “Xia Sheng, have you gotten used to living here these past two days?” MA Xiong asked with a smile the moment he entered. Xia ruofei smiled bitterly.”Old Mr. MA, to be honest, I’m not really used to it ... Your Presidential Suite is too luxurious. I’m feeling uncomfortable!” “Hahaha!” MA Xiong laughed and said,”Xia Sheng, you’re so funny! This is a hotel owned by our Hengfeng group. You’re at home here, what’s there to be uncomfortable about?” Everyone came to the living room of the Presidential Suite and sat down. After the private butler made tea for the three of them, he politely bowed and left. “Xiasheng, why did you call me here?” MA Xiong asked with a smile. “Mr. MA, I would like to ask you if the organizer of tonight’s truffle auction can accept additional truffles?” Xia ruofei went straight to the point.”I have a friend who just happened to provide me with a batch of truffles of very good quality. I hope that this batch of truffles can also be put up for auction.” MA Xiong was slightly stunned when he heard that. He pondered for a moment before he said,”Xia Sheng, this tasting auction is organized by the Grao family of Italy. All the truffles for auction are their own Alba white truffles. I’m afraid it’ll be a little difficult to convince them to accept other truffles for auction ...” “So that’s how it is!” Xia ruofei was slightly disappointed. However, MA Xiong could not be blamed for this. Xia ruofei had not asked about the situation in advance. He had always thought that the auction was organized by a third party. He did not expect the organizer to be the owner of the auction item. People in the same trade were enemies, so they naturally had no reason to accept other truffles at their auction. MA Xiong thought for a moment.”Xiasheng, we have many restaurants and hotels under Hengfeng. Your friend can sell her truffles directly to our restaurants. There’s no need to go through the trouble of going to the auction.” In fact, MA Xiong had misunderstood. He had assumed that the truffles provided by Xia ruofei’s friends were from southern Yunnan province of China. In fact, China’s truffles were not well – known internationally. Their price was more than ten times lower than authentic Italy truffles. The auction was for high – end customers who pursued the highest quality. If such truffles were put up for auction, no one would be interested in them. MA Xiong’s offer to buy the truffles from Hengfeng restaurant was naturally for Xia ruofei’s sake. Xia ruofei smiled.”Mr. MA, I thank you for my friend’s kindness. However, his truffles are of good quality. He hopes to maximize the value of his truffles through auctions.” “Oh? I wonder where the truffles are now? Can I take a look first?” MA Xiong was interested and asked. Truffles could not be kept fresh for a long time, so MA Xiong knew that since Xia ruofei’s friends wanted to auction the truffles tonight, they must be in Shen Cheng city by now. “Of course. I went to get the truffle this afternoon.” Xia ruofei said with a smile. After that, he stood up and walked to the pantry. He opened the refrigerator and took out the two tidying boxes. He then carried them back to the living room. “Mr. MA, my friend’s truffles are all here.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”one of them is black truffle, and the other is white truffle.” As he spoke, Xia ruofei tore off the tape on the box and opened the lid. Instantly, the unique fragrance of truffle gradually filled the Presidential Suite. MA Xiong was a glutton himself, and he had a special liking for truffles. Therefore, he was invigorated when he smelled the fragrance. MA Xiong reached into the box and quickly took out a piece of white truffle from the rice. When MA Xiong saw the truffle that was close to 500 grams, he couldn’t help but stare at it. The larger the truffle, the higher its value. Not to mention, the truffle’s fragrance was so pure. MA Xiong carefully picked up the truffle and observed it carefully. He even sniffed the special fragrance of the truffle from time to time. Xia ruofei smiled and said,””Mr. MA, the quality of this truffle is considered average. The largest piece in the box is nearly four catties!” [PS] announcing the VIP Reader group number: 295848872, genuine readers are welcome to join the group (after joining the group, you need to verify the screenshot of the full subscription).
