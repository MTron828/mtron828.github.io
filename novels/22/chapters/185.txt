Chapter 186: Chapter 182 – overbearing wealth (1)

Xia ruofei took out his phone and saw that it was a call from Wu Liqian. He immediately answered,””Sis Wu, Happy New Year!” It was only the fifth day of the first lunar month. According to the Chinese custom, it was the new year before the fifteenth day of the lunar month, so Wu Liqian also laughed and said,””Happy New Year, little Xia!” “If the county Head has any instructions, please give them!” Xia ruofei laughed and teased. “I had good news to tell you, but since you’re making fun of me, I’ve decided not to tell you ...” Wu Liqian said. “Don’t mind me, sis Wu!” Xia ruofei quickly said,”tell me the good news. Don’t worry that my heart won’t be able to take it!” Wu Liqian burst out laughing and said,””That mouth of yours ... Okay, I’ll stop joking with you. Last time you said you wanted to buy the villa, I helped you ask my relative. There’s no problem on his side. He was planning to sell it before the immigration!” “That’s great!” Xia ruofei said happily,”sis Wu, thank you!” “Aren’t you going to ask about the price?” Wu Liqian asked with a faint smile. “Since sis Wu is personally making an appearance, what problem could there be?” Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”I don’t need to ask to know that the price is absolutely reasonable!” “Hey! What a sweet mouth!” Wu Liqian laughed and said,”my relative said that if you really want it, he will sell it to you for 2.2 million Yuan. Although this villa is in the countryside, we thought of some ways to get the property rights, so the two certificates are complete. What do you think of the price?” “What else do you have to say?” Xia ruofei replied without hesitation,”it’s a super discount! I’m taking it!” The price of 2.2 million Yuan was about 5000 Yuan per square meter. The price of a house in Changping County was about 10000 Yuan. Although this was a remote rural area, it was actually very close to the county. A villa area had just been developed by the sea four kilometers away. The opening price was close to 7000 Yuan, so this was a really good price. Besides, Xia ruofei had just earned 14 million from the truffle auction in Shen Cheng city. Now that he had plenty of money, he naturally decided to buy it without hesitation. “Alright! Then I’ll give my relative a reply. ” Wu Liqian said,”by the way, my relative’s house doesn’t have a mortgage loan from the bank, so if you don’t have enough money, you can apply for a mortgage.” “No need, sis Wu, let’s just pay in full!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it’s more convenient to go through the procedures this way!” “Yo! You’re really rich and overbearing now!” Wu Liqian teased,”you paid 2.2 million in full without even blinking?” “Hehe ... I made some money, but I’m still far from being rich.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I will continue to work hard in that direction.” “You can continue ...” “Oh right, sis Wu, your relatives have gone abroad, right?” Xia ruofei asked,”will it be troublesome to handle the transfer of ownership?” “It’s fine. I’ve already asked around. Before he went abroad, he had already entrusted a friend to help him deal with the property.” Wu Liqian said,”the power of attorney has been notarized. The real estate and land certificates are also in his friend’s hands. There’s no problem with the transfer.” “That’s good. ” Xia ruofei said,”then it’s decided! After the holiday, the real estate Center will do the transfer of ownership!” “Mm! I’ll ask his friend to contact you in the next two days!” Wu Liqian said,”you guys can discuss the details. With the power of attorney, it won’t be a big problem to transfer the ownership. If there are any problems, just give me a call.” The villa was located in Changping County, which was now under Wu Liqian’s jurisdiction. Once she gave her order, even if it was slightly against the rules, as long as there was no problem with their principles, the Housing Authority would definitely give them the green light. “Alright! Thank you, sis Wu!” Xia ruofei said,”if you have time, come to the farm and give me some guidance! Also, give me a chance to do my part as the host. ” “Alright! I’ll come visit when I’m not busy with work. ” Wu Liqian said with a smile. The two of them chatted for a while more before ending the call. Xia ruofei called his classmate, Guan Ping, as he walked towards the villa. Guan Ping worked in a real estate agency, so he was familiar with the transfer of ownership. “RUO Fei!” Guan Ping answered the phone. “What are you doing? Is it convenient for you to talk?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile. “He’s playing games at home!”Guan Ping replied. If you have anything to say, say it!” “I want to buy a house. We’ve already discussed the price and everything else.” Xia ruofei went straight to the point.”You’re more familiar with the transaction contract and the transfer process. Help me run this!” “No problem!” Guan Ping said readily and then asked,”why do you have to settle the contract yourself when you buy a house? You didn’t buy it through an agency?” The process of buying a house was more complicated, especially for second – hand house transactions. Most people completed it through an intermediary company, and the situation of the buyer and the seller directly trading was very rare. “The seller is an acquaintance. We can just discuss the price. Why do we need to find an agency?” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”besides, aren’t you here? There’s no need to let the agency earn the money!” “That’s true!” Guan Ping laughed and said,”this is simple! Later, I’ll just change the company’s transaction contract template and it’ll be able to be used directly. The transfer of ownership will be even easier. I go to the real estate transaction Center every two or three days, so I know the process inside!” “That’s what I wanted you to say!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’ll pay you the intermediary fee according to the market price!” “RUO Fei, are you scolding me?” Guan Ping pretended to be angry.”Why would I charge you for such a small thing? Are we still brothers?” “It’s because we’re brothers that I can’t let you do any voluntary work! I know that it’s actually quite troublesome and tiring to transfer the ownership. ” Xia ruofei said with a smile. “No matter how troublesome it is, I can’t take your money! Anyway, I’ll go to the real estate Center every day and help you with your business. ” Guan Ping insisted. “Alright, alright, I’ll treat you to a drink another day!” Xia ruofei said. He only had two good friends in middle school, Guan Ping and pang Hao. Until now, they were very close. Since Guan Ping had said so, Xia ruofei did not insist. “That’s the way! “I’m still very happy to have a drink with you ...” Guan Ping said with a smile, and then asked,”by the way, where did you buy the house? How much is the total price?” “It’s a small villa on my farm. I used to rent it, but I’ve made some money recently, so I want to buy it.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”the houses in the suburbs are not expensive. An entire villa is only 2.2 million.” “Only 2.2 million! “Your sister ...” Guan Ping shouted.”Damn ... Ruofei, you’ve become a nouveau riche without saying anything!” Following that, Guan Ping said with a cheeky smile,”Um ... Can I take back what I just said? It’s actually not a big deal to occasionally charge a good brother a middleman’s fee!” “Get lost!” [PS] announcing the VIP Reader group number: 295848872, genuine readers are welcome to join the group (after joining the group, you need to verify the screenshot of the full subscription).
