3306 Elemental storage Pearl (1)

The information that appeared in the perceptual mirror made Xia ruofei slightly stunned.

Energy storage Pearl (reward for breaking the record on the first floor of the Tower of Trials)

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh. He had been nervous for half a day and it turned out that this was the reward for completing the first level of the Tower of Trials. He didn’t expect the Almighty who set up the Tower of Trials to have such a bad taste and use such a method to give out the reward.

It was one thing for a Star Beast to deliver the treasure, but he had also announced the mission for the second level. Xia ruofei already understood that he had deliberately sent another star Beast to deliver the prize after killing 100 intermediate star beasts.

Xia ruofei did not suspect that the information provided by the perceptual mirror was fake. He continued to read the introduction of the elemental storage Pearl carefully.

It turned out that the elemental storage Pearl was used to store elemental energy.

Cultivators could transfer their vital Qi into the elemental storage Pearl and store it. This elemental storage Pearl could store all the vital Qi of an ordinary late – Stage golden core cultivator.

Although this function was simple, it was very practical.

Xia ruofei liked it very much. He was so happy that his eyebrows were raised.

Although he didn’t lack cultivation resources, whether it was absorbing spirit crystals or origin crystals, he needed to cultivate in order to transform their energy into Origin Energy.

Therefore, if one consumed a lot of Yuan Qi in a fierce battle, there was no way to replenish it with spirit crystals or origin crystals. No one could cultivate while fighting.

On the other hand, the elemental storage Pearl stored the cultivator’s own elemental energy. It could be directly absorbed and used, which was obviously much more convenient and fast.

Even though Xia ruofei was much stronger than the average Aurous core beginner stage cultivator, in terms of vital energy, he did not have much more than Chen Xuan and the rest. This elemental storage Pearl could store all the elemental energy of a late – Stage golden core cultivator. In other words, Xia ruofei would have to exhaust his elemental energy several times before he could fill the elemental storage Pearl.

As long as he carried the elemental storage Pearl, he could use the elemental energy inside at any time. It was equivalent to having a dantian that was several times larger, and he could use his elemental energy in battle without any worries.

Xia ruofei walked forward and picked up the energy storage Pearl. After observing it for a long time, he tried to inject some energy into it.

As expected, this wisp of Yuan Qi was easily absorbed by the energy storage Pearl and stored inside.

Next, he tried to use this strand of vital Qi. With a single thought, this strand of vital Qi was sucked out and reentered Xia ruofei’s meridians.

Xia ruofei felt it carefully and realized that it was his own vital Qi. There was no sign of rejection at all. It had directly integrated into his dantian.

If Xia ruofei’s elemental energy was consumed too much during a battle, he could directly absorb the elemental energy from the elemental storage Pearl.

“What a great treasure!” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but exclaim.

He held the energy storage Pearl in his hand and muttered to himself for a moment. Then, he immediately used his mental power to examine it. After that, his figure flashed to his right.

The trial Pagoda’s second floor was a forest terrain, and he quickly found a place that was easy to hide the spirit map scroll.

This was a very well – hidden small tree hole, and there was a large amount of grass outside. If he didn’t use his spiritual power to investigate, he probably wouldn’t have noticed it with his naked eyes.

Xia ruofei took out the painting from his palm and stuffed it into the tree hole.

Then, he camouflaged the surroundings of the tree hole and entered the medium. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Xia ruofei immediately appeared in the spirit map space.

The first thought that came to his mind when he obtained the elemental storage Pearl was to fill it with elemental energy.

Now that he had started the second level’s trial mission, time was very precious.

In the first level’s trial mission, he had broken the record and received the elemental storage Pearl as a reward. This reward made him extremely satisfied, so he naturally wanted to try and break the second level’s record.

If he were to directly inject vital Qi into the elemental storage Pearl on the second level of the Tower of Trials, on one hand, it would waste a lot of time. Even if he used up all his vital Qi, he would not be able to fill the elemental storage Pearl all at once. He would have to absorb the energy of the elemental crystals again and then continue to inject. On the other hand, the second level of the Tower of Trials was filled with the unknown to him, and was rather dangerous.

It was much safer to operate it in the spirit map space.

The most important thing was that it could save a lot of time.

The moment Xia ruofei entered the spirit map space, he called Xia Qing over and asked,””Xia Qing, have you prepared the medicine?”

Xia ruofei’s shoulder was severely injured on the first level of the Tower of Trials. Although he had used a petal of the spirit Heart Flower at the first moment, he had not fully recovered.

He was about to complete the trial mission on the second floor, and he could foresee that the battle would be very intense. His injuries would definitely affect him, so he had to get rid of the hidden dangers first.

“It’s done, master!” Xia Qing said respectfully. Then, she took out a small bottle of ointment and handed it to Xia ruofei with both hands.

Xia ruofei took the ointment and said with a smile,””You’ve worked hard, go do your work!”

“Yes! Master!” Xia Qing replied. Then, her figure flickered, and she returned to the mountain and sea realm in the spirit map space.

Xia ruofei took the ointment and set up the time array flag. Then, he entered the array flag’s range.

This way, the difference in time flow between two to three thousand times allowed him to do many things with ease, while the time in the outside world would not be wasted.

Xia ruofei first applied the ointment on his injured area before he started to pour his elemental energy into the elemental storage Pearl.
