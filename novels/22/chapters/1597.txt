Translator: 549690339

After Xia ruofei got his car, he met up with the staff from pang Bo company at the West exit of the exhibition center.

The motorboat wasn’t big, and it was loaded into an ordinary cargo truck with the Pambo company logo sprayed on it.

Xia ruofei drove the Knight XV off – Road vehicle and led the way. The two cars left the exhibition center one after the other and went straight to Xia ruofei’s warehouse in the city.

The location of the warehouse and the exhibition center happened to be one in the South and one in the North. It took about 40 minutes to go around the three warehouses.

When they arrived at the warehouse, Xia ruofei parked the Knight XV a distance away and went over to open the door.

The door of the warehouse was very high, so the van was directly poured into the warehouse. More than half of the van was inside the warehouse.

Then, the staff of pang Bo company opened the carriage door and pressed a button. Two sliding rails slowly extended out of the carriage and finally touched the ground.

Then, the motorboat that was fixed on the frame slowly slid down along the special slide and was finally completely unloaded on the ground of the warehouse.

With a sizzling sound, the two sliding rails slowly retracted. The entire process of unloading the truck was very easy and fast.

A staff member came to Xia ruofei with the receipt and said,””Mr. Xia, please take a look at the goods. If there are no problems, please sign here.”

The model and color of the motorboat were all correct. Xia ruofei believed that such a big company would not play any tricks on this issue. So, after a simple check, he signed his name.

“Thank you!” The staff member said politely,”the instruction manual, maintenance card, and so on are all in the storage box of the motorboat. This fixed frame comes with it, so it can be easily transported when you need to go out to sea.”

“Alright, thank you for your hard work!” Xia ruofei politely shook hands with the staff and personally sent them out of the warehouse.

Xia ruofei turned around and closed the warehouse door. Then, he walked to the front of the motorboat. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The GTR engine 230 had a beautiful streamlined body, and the red and black colors were quite cool. Xia ruofei could not help but look forward to driving it on the sea.

After admiring it for a while, Xia ruofei had an idea. He kept the entire motorboat and its frame into the spirit map space, then went out and drove back to the farm.

The trip took almost the entire afternoon. Xia ruofei went to the staff cafeteria for dinner and then returned to his small villa.

He quickly returned to his room, locked the door and windows, summoned the spirit map scroll, and entered the medium.

Mountain and sea realm.

Xia Qing was curiously looking at the motorboat. Even the realm Fox was sticking its head out and looking at it. It timidly stretched out its claws, but before it could touch the motorboat, it quickly retracted them.

Xia Qing had seen all – terrain vehicles and small excavators before, but the white fox had never seen such things before! In its eyes, it was undoubtedly a terrifying monster.

“Master!” When Xia Qing saw Xia ruofei, she quickly and respectfully greeted him.

Xia ruofei nodded and walked over to pick up the kit hanging on the rack.

He took out a wrench, screwdriver, and other tools from inside and began to skillfully untie the motorboat’s fixation device.

“Master, What is this?” Xia Qing couldn’t help asking.

Xia ruofei quickly turned the wrench and said without looking up,””Motorboat, for the sea!”

“Use it in the sea?” Xia Qing turned pale with fright,”won’t this metal guy sink in the sea?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”Xia Qing, who said that iron will definitely sink into the water?” Not only will this thing not sink in the sea, but it can also be driven very fast!”

“This ... This is impossible!” Xia Qing said with a shocked expression.

“Nothing is impossible! Have you ever seen an iron thing that can fly in the sky?” Xia ruofei said,”you’ve never seen it before, have you? But this is true. ”

Planes were usually made of aviation aluminum, not steel. However, Xia ruofei was too lazy to explain in detail.

Including the principles of buoyancy and density in water, it was hard to explain in a short time. So after he said this, he didn’t care about Xia Qing who was in a mess in the wind and continued to work.

In a short while, Xia ruofei had removed the motorboat from the scaffold.

It was too easy to move the motorboat in space. Xia ruofei only had to think about it and he gathered the invisible force of space to wrap the entire motorboat.

Then, the motorboat slowly drifted to the beach, and Xia ruofei followed behind.

When she saw with her own eyes that the motorboat did not sink when it landed on the sea, but drifted with the waves, Xia Qing’s mouth opened so wide that an egg could be stuffed in it.

Xia ruofei laughed. With a flash of his body, he appeared on the motorboat.

“Little guy, do you want to come up and try?” he called out.

The white fox was also by the sea, looking curiously at the motorboat and Xia ruofei who was on it.

Hearing Xia ruofei’s words, the White realmfox looked conflicted. However, its curiosity triumphed over its fear and it nodded its head firmly.

Xia ruofei gave the white fox a thumbs up. Then, with a thought, he used his spatial energy to bring the white fox to his side.
