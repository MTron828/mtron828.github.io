She couldn’t possibly trouble Tian Huilan for everything!

Wu Liqian was angry, but when she saw Liu haojun’s smug look, she felt a little nauseated. No matter what, it was better to stay away from this scoundrel.

As for what would happen after they arrived in Beijing, they would just take it one step at a time.

Thinking of this, Wu Liqian looked at Liu haojun coldly and said,””Move! I’m going to the security check!”

Liu haojun stood in front of Wu Liqian and stared at her with bloodshot eyes.””I’ll give you one more chance. Give up this position and go back to Changping. As long as you’re willing to be my woman, I guarantee that you’ll have a smooth life in Changping. How was it? Please consider it!”

A trace of anger appeared on Wu Liqian’s face. She bit her lower lip and squeezed out two words,””In your dreams!”

After that, Wu Liqian dragged her suitcase and tried to bypass Liu haojun to go to the security check.

Liu haojun, however, immediately changed his direction like a street gangster and even reached out his hands to stop Wu Liqian.

He revealed a cold smile and said,””I like women with strong tempers like you! Because to me, conquering with such difficulty gives me a greater sense of achievement! Wu Liqian, you can’t run away. So what if you go abroad, not to mention the capital? As long as I’m willing, I can make you unable to stay in any corner of this world in minutes!”

After saying that, Liu haojun actually reached out to pull Wu Liqian. He even said,””A wise man submits to fate. I think you should return to Changping with me ...”

However, a hand reached out from the side and grabbed Liu haojun’s wrist.

Liu haojun’s pulse was locked. He suddenly felt sore and numb, as if he couldn’t exert any strength in his body. Then, he felt that the hand was slightly exerting force. He felt as if he was being clamped by a hard and hot iron clamp. A burst of severe pain came from his wrist. He even felt his bones creaking. He couldn’t help but scream.

Wu Liqian looked at Xia ruofei, who had appeared in time, in surprise.

Xia ruofei ignored the wailing Liu haojun. He smiled at Wu Liqian and said,””Sister Qian, I’m so sorry! There was a traffic jam on the way, so I’m a little late ...”

“It’s fine. It’s still early,”Wu Liqian said.

Liu haojun used all his strength, but he couldn’t break free. He shouted in exasperation,””Quickly release me! You bastard!”

Xia ruofei was expressionless, but he used a little more strength.

Liu haojun suddenly screamed loudly. His entire body was hunched over as he cried out in a trembling voice,”Let go ... Let go ... My hand is going to break!”

Xia ruofei glanced at Liu haojun and handed the bag to Wu Liqian.””Sister Qian, the things I’ve prepared for you are all inside. Keep them well!”

Wu Liqian knew that the paper bag must contain the jaded skin ointment. She reached out to take it and said softly,””Thank you ...”

While Liu haojun was still cursing, some people had already noticed the small commotion and looked over.

Xia ruofei looked at Liu haojun coldly and said,””If you continue to spew shit, your arm will really break ...”

Liu haojun was like a duck that had its throat clutched. He opened his mouth weakly, but he didn’t dare to curse anymore.

As Xia ruofei let go, he gave Liu haojun a light push. Liu haojun immediately staggered back six or seven steps and almost fell on his butt.

Xia ruofei smiled and said to Wu Liqian,””Sister Qian, it’s almost time. I’ll send you to the security check!”

“These things ... Do we need to do a consignment check?” Wu Liqian asked, waving the paper bag in her hand.

“It’s okay. The jaded skin ointment can be brought directly onto the plane.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”let’s go!”

“En!” Wu Liqian nodded her head. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

The two of them directly treated Liu haojun as air.

Liu haojun gritted his teeth in anger, but he was also scared out of his wits by Xia ruofei. He did not dare to stand in front of Wu Liqian anymore.

He looked at Xia ruofei’s back and shouted,””Do you know who I am?”

Xia ruofei blinked at Wu Liqian and said,””This child is so pitiful. He doesn’t even remember who he is. Did he ... Lose his memory?”

Wu Liqian couldn’t help but burst into laughter. She didn’t have a good impression of Liu haojun at all. Moreover, the two of them had already fallen out a long time ago, so she naturally wouldn’t show any mercy at this time.

Wu Liqian said directly,”amnesia shouldn’t be that bad, right?” But ... There might be a problem here ...”

As she spoke, she pointed to her head with her index finger, and her meaning was self – evident.

Some of the onlookers almost burst out laughing when they saw the two of them echoing each other.

Liu haojun’s face was red and white, and his eyes were murderous. He shouted with hatred,””Who are you? Leave your name if you dare!”

Xia ruofei stopped and turned around.””Weren’t you in a hurry to meet me? You don’t even know me?”

Liu haojun was stunned for a moment, then immediately came back to his senses. During this period of time, he had been most concerned about the results of attracting investment into Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory. Hence, when Xia ruofei said that, he immediately guessed Xia ruofei’s identity.

When he looked at Xia ruofei again, the hatred in his heart grew.

Initially, the peach blossom company had sent people to inspect several other locations at the last minute and refused to meet with him. He was already filled with anger. Now that Xia ruofei had come out to meddle in his business, he naturally hated her more.

“It’s President Xia!” Liu haojun said sinisterly,”President Xia, you’re such a Big Boss. Don’t you know that it’s illegal to hit someone?”

“Idiot!” Xia ruofei spat out the word in disdain, then said to Wu Liqian,”sister Qian, it seems that you’re right. This guy really has a problem with his head! Ignore him, I’ll take you to the security check!”

After that, Xia ruofei helped Wu Liqian with her luggage and the two of them walked towards the nearest security checkpoint.

Liu haojun was infuriated by Xia ruofei’s disdainful tone. However, he knew that he was no match for Xia ruofei.

Liu haojun shouted from behind,””Xia ruofei, you’ve got guts! Shut down all of your company’s businesses in the southeast province if you can! Or else ...”

Xia ruofei stopped in his tracks, turned around and stared into Liu haojun’s eyes.”Are you threatening me? I really don’t buy it! Not to mention a good – for – nothing like you, even if your Liu family’s elders came out, what could they do to me?”

Liu haojun was stunned. He thought that Xia ruofei didn’t know about his family’s situation. Otherwise, Xia ruofei wouldn’t have the courage to be so rude to him.

Xia ruofei looked at Liu haojun and said,””You don’t understand? It’s okay if you don’t understand. You can ask your brother who runs a Leather Company when you go back, and you’ll understand. ”

After that, Xia ruofei ignored Liu haojun and dragged Wu Liqian’s suitcase to the security check.

Liu haojun stared at the back of the two people who were getting further and further away, and his expression was uncertain. After a long time, he finally gritted his teeth and took out his phone. He found Liu haofan’s number and dialed it.

“Big brother?” Liu haofan was a little surprised.
