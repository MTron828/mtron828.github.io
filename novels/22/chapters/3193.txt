3194 It’s a music score?_

Everyone was in the middle of a discussion, so the room was rather noisy. However, Xia ruofei’s sharp ears picked up Song Wei’s humming.

He couldn’t help but turn his head and ask with a smile,””Wei Wei, what’s this tune? I don’t think I’ve heard it before, but it’s really nice to listen to!”

Actually, Song Wei was humming subconsciously. She only realized it when she heard Xia ruofei’s words and quickly stopped with a red face.

“Don’t stop!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”by the way, Weiwei, you haven’t answered me yet! What song is it?”

Song Wei came back to her senses and pointed at the computer screen in embarrassment,””I ... I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I just subconsciously hummed these numbers according to the music score. I didn’t expect it to really be like a song ...”

Xia ruofei was stunned.

He turned his head and stared at the computer screen, turning the numbers into simplified music scores in his mind. As expected, the first few sets were the songs that Song Wei had just hummed.

Chen Xuan and the rest had also noticed the conversation between Xia ruofei and Song Wei.

Chen Xuan couldn’t help but say,”brother Xia, miss Song Wei has provided us with a good idea!” But ... Could these numbers be just a song? If that was all, why did they need to use such a complicated method for encryption? Could it just be a coincidence?”

Xia ruofei was not in a hurry to answer. Instead, he quickly went through all 3000 sets of numbers.

These numbers were not the standard simplified music score, and what the negative numbers and zeros represented had to be guessed. Hence, Xia ruofei could not immediately reproduce the song in his mind.

However, even after going through it once, Xia ruofei was sure that the combination of these numbers could really form a song.

Xia ruofei thought for a moment and said,””Brother Chen, let’s analyze it first ... First, let’s assume that the direction of deciphering this time is correct, and the program is running normally, so there is no problem with the result, right?”

“Of course!” Chen Xuan nodded.”That’s a major premise.”

A smile appeared on Xia ruofei’s face. He couldn’t suppress his excitement and said,””I’m pretty sure that there won’t be any problems with this premise!”

Chen Xuan was taken aback for a moment before he snapped back to his senses. His eyes widened as he asked,””You’re saying that our decryption direction is correct, the program is running normally, and the results and data are accurate? You’re sure of all this?”

Xia ruofei nodded with a smile.”Due to strict consideration, I can only say that it’s basically confirmed. However, the possibility is very high!”

Chen Xuan and the others gasped in shock. Chen Xuan was still in disbelief as he pointed at the document filled with numbers on the computer screen and asked,””What’s the basis? Is it because of that song?”

Xia ruofei nodded.”I’ve just used my fastest speed to go through the combination of more than 3000 numbers. Although I’m not completely sure what the numbers mean if this is a simplified score, there’s no doubt that these 3000 numbers can still form a song!”

Chen Xuan nodded his head thoughtfully and said,””I believe in brother Xia’s vision. That is to say, these numbers can really be turned into a song, right?”

Xia ruofei nodded.”If you want to restore it perfectly, you need to try again. The main thing is to figure out the meaning of some numbers.”

After listening for a while, Mu Sheng couldn’t help but interrupt,””Little brother Xia, I don’t quite understand. Even if these numbers can form a song, how can they prove that our previous judgments are correct?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,””Sect leader mu, think about it from another perspective. There are three conditions in the major premise that we just mentioned. The direction is correct, the process is normal, and the data is accurate. If any one of them does not hold, then the answer we get must be a pair of chaotic and irregular numbers. And since we’ve gotten the score, doesn’t that mean that we’ve been on the right path?”

Mu Sheng was deep in thought, but he still frowned and asked,””Little brother Xia, I’m not doubting your judgment! I’m just a little worried. What if this is a coincidence?”

Xia ruofei was very sure.”It might be a coincidence that one or two groups could form a meaningful tune. However, if more than 3000 groups could form a song, the probability of it being a coincidence is much lower than winning the lottery!” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Xia ruofei smiled and said,””Today’s incident made me recall a story. The Russia psychologist, lefev, had always believed that music was the transmission of feelings from one person to another. He even believed that the language of music was the universal language! Lefeyvore had studied the spectrum of planet SS433 before. He found that the slowed – down spectrum matched the music composed of nine notes, and the accuracy was unusual. Many experts thought it was ridiculous at first, but after careful examination, they had to admit that the spectrum of planet SS433 could indeed form music. “Of course, most astronomers think that the creation of music is an accidental phenomenon and not some cosmic intelligence using the planet to compose!”

After Xia ruofei finished his story, he looked around at the crowd and said,””Lefeivore had calculated the probability of this planet’s spectrum matching the music from a mathematical point of view. It was about one in a thousand. Such a low probability was enough to attract everyone’s interest and attention. In other words, the possibility of a piece of music being formed naturally or by chance was extremely low. “Especially when we have more than 3000 groups of numbers combined to form a meaningful music piece. To say that it was formed by coincidence or chance ... I can say that the probability of this happening is infinitely close to zero! Basically, it can be ignored!”
