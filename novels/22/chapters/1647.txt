Chapter 1648: The negotiation (2)

After all, compared to song Rui and Zhao Yongjun, Liu Jian and the others ‘backgrounds were not strong enough. If Liu haofan really hated them, it would be a little troublesome.

That night, Xia ruofei, Zhao Yongjun, and song Rui discussed their negotiation strategy for the next day and then went back to their rooms to rest early.

The next morning, the three of them had breakfast in Xia ruofei’s courtyard house and made tea in Xia ruofei’s courtyard. It was almost nineo’ clock when they left for Tang real estate.

The three of them were using Zhao Yongjun’s Mercedes – Benz, and they even brought Wu Qiang along to be their driver.

At around 9:50 am, Xia ruofei and the others arrived at the headquarters of the Tang real estate.

Zhou Tianyu naturally didn’t dare to neglect them and had been waiting downstairs for a long time. The moment Xia ruofei and the others got off the car, he immediately greeted them with a smile. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“President Zhao! Hello, hello!” Zhou Tianyu said to Zhao Yongjun, who was walking in front. Then, he greeted song Rui and Xia ruofei,”young master Song, young master Xia! Welcome, the two of you!”

Zhao Yongjun just smiled and nodded at Zhou Tianyu, but song Rui asked,””Why don’t I see Liu er?”

Zhou Tianyu was a little embarrassed. He told Liu haofan that he had already arrived at the Tang real estate, but he didn’t want to lose face in front of song Rui, so he naturally didn’t want to lower his status and welcome him.

However, this time, no one was interested in this piece of land. Someone finally wanted to take over the land that was about to be smashed. Zhou Tianyu naturally didn’t dare to offend Zhao Yongjun and the others. It was impossible to tell the truth.

Hence, Zhou Tianyu could only say awkwardly,””Young master Song, young master Liu, he ... He’s preparing for the negotiation later. He ... He’ll be waiting for you upstairs!”

Song Rui pouted and said,”tsk!” He would suffer for his face! General manager Zhou, do you think ... If we turn around and leave now ...”

“Young master Song! Young master Song!” Zhou Tianyu quickly said,”young master Liu really has something to do. He even told me to explain it to you all. You see ... Should we go up first? there’s no need to do this over such a small matter ...”

Xia ruofei patted song Rui’s shoulder and smiled at Zhou Tianyu,””CEO Zhou, song Rui was just joking with you, please don’t take it to heart! Let’s go in!”

Zhou Tianyu felt that his back was almost drenched in sweat. He thought to himself that he would never take on such jobs again. The company could let whoever it wanted to be responsible for. This group of young masters was really hard to serve!

Zhou Tianyu finally welcomed Xia ruofei and the other two into the company’s headquarters. They took the executive elevator to the 28th floor. Zhou Tianyu attentively held the elevator for everyone and asked Zhao Yongjun and the other two to get down first. Then, he jogged a few steps and led the way.

They soon arrived at a large conference room.

As expected, Liu haofan was sitting in the conference room waiting. When he saw Xia ruofei and the other two, his expression was a little complicated, but he still stood up and went to greet them.

“Brother Zhao, welcome!” Liu haofan greeted Zhao Yongjun.

Then, he looked at song Rui coldly and nodded. Even though he had already greeted song Rui, song Rui didn’t care. He tilted his head and looked away, ignoring Liu haofan. Liu haofan was so angry that he gritted his teeth.

At last, Liu haofan’s eyes stopped on Xia ruofei. He squinted at Xia ruofei and then smiled. He took the initiative to reach out his hand to Xia ruofei and said,””President Xia, I’ve heard so much about you! I didn’t recognize you last time, I’m sorry!”

After the land auction, Liu haofan had a deep impression of Xia ruofei. Naturally, he had to inquire about Xia ruofei’s identity and background.

Although Xia ruofei was not well – known in the capital’s circle of rich and powerful people, everyone who knew about his deeds regarded him with great importance. In a sense, Xia ruofei had already surpassed the level of these rich and powerful people.

Hence, Liu haofan did not spend much effort to find out about Xia ruofei’s situation.

After learning about Xia ruofei’s past, Liu haofan was secretly shocked. He thought that Xia ruofei was a pushover among Zhao Yongjun and the others. At most, he was a white glove. He didn’t expect to be wrong. The real person with the toughest ideas was Xia ruofei.

Hence, when they met today, Liu haofan no longer looked down on them. Instead, he looked serious. He knew that Zhao Yongjun and the others were starting to see Xia ruofei as their leader.

Xia ruofei smiled and shook hands with Liu haofan.””You’re too kind, young master Liu!”

Liu haofan looked at Zhou Tianyu and the latter nodded at him. He smiled and said,””Brother Zhao, director Xia, let’s take a seat!”

Since song Rui had ignored him, he might as well treat song Rui as air.

The group of guests and hosts sat opposite each other at the conference table, each occupying a row of seats.

Although Liu haofan sat in the middle, he didn’t speak first. Instead, Zhou Tianyu smiled and opened the folder in front of him,””Director Zhao, director Xia, young master Song, regarding this piece of land in little Tang town, your company also participated in the bidding when the land was sold, so I won’t go into the details. I’m sure you all know it very well.”

“Yes, director Zhou, let’s get straight to the point!” Xia ruofei nodded.

Liu haofan’s eyes narrowed. He looked at the three people in front of him and knew that Xia ruofei would be the leader of the negotiation today.

Zhou Tianyu said,”our Tang real estate bought this land at a price of 410 million HxB. Now, out of consideration for the company’s development strategy, we intend to transfer the land in exchange for a certain amount of cash to be used for other development projects ...”

Xia ruofei exchanged glances with Zhao Yongjun and song Rui, who were on his left and right. All three of them smiled.

No matter how grand he made it sound, he could no longer cover up the fact that there was a problem with the land.

Of course, Xia ruofei wouldn’t expose Zhou Tianyu’s last lie. He smiled and said,””Director Zhou, we’ve heard a lot about that land! First, it was sold for a sky – High price, then those rumors appeared on the internet ...”

Zhou Tianyu said awkwardly,”those are just rumors ...”

“Whether it’s a rumor or not, we don’t care.” Xia ruofei smiled faintly and said,”since we’re here, we’re naturally interested in this land and are willing to take on the possible risks. What we’re most concerned about is naturally the price. Director Zhou, you’re not thinking of letting us take over at the original price, are you?”

Zhou Tianyu laughed and said,””Of course not ... Considering that the transaction price of this land was unreasonably high at the time, there is a certain element of bubbles ...”

Speaking of this, Zhou Tianyu couldn’t help but look at the three people in front of him. Liu haofan’s eyes twitched as well. The person who caused this price bubble was sitting opposite him!

Zhou Tianyu continued,”considering these factors, our company will make a concession in terms of price. Our psychological price is 380 million ...”

The moment Zhou Tianyu finished speaking, Xia ruofei closed the folder in front of him without hesitation and stood up.

Zhao Yongjun and song Rui, who were beside him, naturally stood up immediately.

“Director Zhou, if this is the price, I don’t think there’s a need to continue the discussion ...” Xia ruofei said.

With that, Xia ruofei picked up the document and was about to leave.

Zhou Tianyu panicked. He knew that these young masters never played by the rules, but this was a formal business negotiation! How could you leave without saying anything? If you think this price is not suitable, you can bargain!

Business has always been like this! Asking for a sky – High price and paying on the spot!

Zhou Tianyu quickly said,”CEO Xia!” Please stop! Please stop! If you’re not satisfied with the price, we can still talk about it!”

Xia ruofei didn’t sit down. He just stopped in his tracks and said to Zhou Tianyu,””Director Zhou, I don’t think it’s necessary to waste everyone’s time. The price difference between the two sides is too big. There’s no possibility of negotiation!”

“This ...” Zhou Tianyu couldn’t help but look at Liu haofan for help.

Liu haofan glared at Zhou Tianyu, then squeezed out a smile and said to Xia ruofei,””President Xia, I didn’t expect you to be so impatient! “This ... At that time, I also felt that the price set by old Zhou and the others was a little too high. How about this? Regardless of whether we can come to an agreement or not, at least let’s sit down and have a slow talk!”
