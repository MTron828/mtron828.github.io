Translator: 549690339 T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Qiangzi’s real name was Xu Qiang. His father was a leader of the Ministry of Culture. The Ministry of Culture was not a particularly powerful Department among the major ministries. Naturally, Xu Qiang’s status in song Rui’s circle was not very high.

However, it was the most convenient for him to do this.

The Yanjing Museum was a subsidiary of the Jing city’s Bureau of culture. The head of the museum was usually a Deputy Director of the Bureau.

Xu Qiang’s father was a leader of the Ministry of Culture, so Xu Qiang had a lot of connections in this industry.

Usually, Xu Qiang could barely hang around in song Rui’s circle. This time, young master Song actually called him personally to ask him to do something. Moreover, this matter was easy for him, so Xu Qiang agreed without hesitation.

“Brother Rui, leave it to me!” Xu Qiang said,”I’d like to see who has the guts to take the spot of brother Rui’s friend!”

Song Rui said lightly,”let’s talk about it later. I want to see the results first. My friend’s name is Zhuo Yiyi. She came in second in this written test ... Qiangzi, can you finish it in half an hour?”

“No problem! If I can’t even do this, then I won’t have the face to work with brother Rui!” Xu Qiang said without hesitation.

Then, he laughed evilly and said,”brother Rui, it sounds like a girl!” Isn’t this girl super pretty?”

Song Rui said indifferently,”are you itching for a beating?” Don’t ask around!”

“Yes, yes, yes! Brother Rui, I’ll go do something first!” Xu Qiang quickly said.

“Give me a call if you have any results.” Song Rui said and then hung up.

He turned to look at Zhuo Yiyi and said,””I’ve already told my friend, don’t worry! There will be results soon. ”

Zhuo Yiyi had known song Rui for a long time. Song Rui had always been a good – tempered gentleman, but this was the first time she had seen him so domineering. She couldn’t help but take a few more glances at him.

Then, Zhuo Yiyi asked in disbelief,””Uncle ... This ... This is it?”

“It’s not a big deal,”song Rui shrugged.

Zhuo Yiyi felt that all of this seemed a little unreal, but she also felt that song Rui didn’t seem to be lying, so she couldn’t help but feel conflicted.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”Zhuo Yiyi, why are you still so worried?” Even if song Rui didn’t help, you won’t lose anything, right?”

“That makes sense!” Zhuo Yiyi smiled and said,”the situation can’t get any worse anyway ...”

Song Rui knew that it was unlikely that Zhuo Yiyi would be completely at ease just because of his words. However, he didn’t want to explain further. After all, once the final results were out, Zhuo Yiyi would know that he wasn’t bragging.

Therefore, song Rui only smiled and did not continue the topic.

The seafood stall was not far from the airport. Xia ruofei arrived at the airport’s parking lot in no time.

Xia ruofei and song Rui each pushed a large suitcase. The four of them walked into the airport departure hall.

There was still more than an hour before the flight would take off. After checking in their luggage at the counter and changing their boarding passes, Zhuo Yiyi was not in a hurry to go through the security check. Instead, she followed Xia ruofei and the rest to the lounge chair in the lobby and sat down.

It had only been ten minutes since song Rui had finished the call.

Zhuo Yiyi, Xia ruofei, and the other two chatted with each other. Her mood had been affected by the recruitment incident, and she was not as lively as before.

Xia ruofei saw a vending machine not far away and asked with a smile,””I’m a little thirsty. I’ll go buy a bottle of water. What do you guys want to drink?”

Just then, Zhuo Yiyi’s phone suddenly rang.

Song Wei looked at song Rui and said with a smile,””Yiyi, quickly pick up the phone!”

Zhuo Yiyi took out her phone and looked at the caller ID. It was a landline from Beijing.

“Who is this?” Zhuo Yiyi mumbled to herself as she picked up the call.”Hello!”

A very solicitous voice came from the other end of the phone.””Hello, are you student Zhuo Yiyi from Yanjing University?”

“I’m Zhuo Yiyi. May I know who you are?”

“Hello, student Zhuo! I’m Secretary Hu from the Human Resources Department of Yanjing Museum. ” The voice on the other end of the phone became even more enthusiastic.”I’m informing you on behalf of the Yanjing Museum that you have been officially accepted by our Museum. Congratulations!”

Zhuo Yiyi was stunned. She subconsciously glanced at song Rui and stuttered,””Re ... Accepted? This ... Could you have made a mistake? I didn’t see me on the list of candidates that your official website published!”

Officer Hu’s voice became a little awkward.””Student Zhuo, that list is only for public use. It’s not the final admission Result. After some feedback and the leader’s comprehensive consideration, you will be on the final admission list.”

Even Mr. Hu himself was baffled. Less than an hour after the official website had announced the name list, the museum’s curator had personally come over and asked him to immediately inform Zhuo Yiyi of her acceptance.

In addition, officer Hu also heard the director go to the office next door and very urgently ask the colleague in charge of the maintenance of the official website to immediately withdraw the notice and replace it with a new one.

In fact, it wasn’t just officer Hu, even the museum’s curator himself was still confused. Just a few minutes ago, the director of the city’s cultural Bureau had personally called to criticize the museum’s recruitment work. He said that some of the more professional and comprehensive comrades had been inexplicably excluded from the list, and that this was a serious dereliction of duty by the museum’s recruitment leader, and so on.

Immediately after, the director of the Cultural Affairs Bureau instructed that Zhuo Yiyi, who had placed second in the written test, must be admitted.

The curator of the museum was also a party member and Deputy Director of the cultural Bureau, so he couldn’t help but ask around. It was only then that he found out that a Deputy Director of the Ministry of Culture had personally called to ask about this matter because of Zhuo Yiyi.

Beijing was a municipality. The director of the cultural Bureau was at the main department level, and the curator of the museum was also at the Deputy department level. Speaking of which, the Deputy Director was only at the same level as the curator.

However, in the officialdom, matters could not be simply judged by the administrative level. The Deputy Secretary of the municipal Party Committee and the Deputy – mayor of a Prefecture – Level city were both Deputy Directors. However, one was the third – in – command of the city, while the other had not even entered the Standing Committee. The power of speech was on a completely different level.

The Deputy Director was the Department leader of the higher authorities. He had direct supervision and guidance power over the city’s cultural Bureau. Even if a director or a Deputy Director made the call, the director would pay great attention to it, let alone the Deputy Director.

The curator broke out in a cold sweat when he heard the news. He didn’t have time to ask any other questions and directly asked the director to remove Gina from the list.

In fact, among the three criteria, the first place in the written test was based on her own ability, while the other two were accepted through connections. Moreover, Gina was not much different from the other person’s client in terms of rank. Under the same circumstances, the museum had no other choice but to get Gina in.

Who asked her to have the worst grades?

Everything had been settled in just a few minutes. Gina had no idea that the organization that she had spent so much effort on had already flown away and landed in the hands of Zhuo Yiyi, who had lived up to her reputation.

After Zhuo Yiyi heard this, she felt as if she was in a dream. She repeatedly confirmed it with that Secretary Hu.

Officer Hu knew that this future colleague of his had a very powerful background, so he could only patiently answer Zhuo Yiyi’s questions, which were almost all the same.

In the end, after Zhuo Yiyi hung up the phone, she immediately logged into the official website of Yanjing Museum to take a look. She realized that the list had indeed been changed, and she was on it.

“Ah!” Zhuo Yiyi shouted happily. Ignoring the strange looks from the people in the departure hall, she hugged song Rui and said,”uncle, you’re too awesome! It was really settled with one phone call!”
