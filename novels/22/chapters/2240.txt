Xia ruofei thought for a while and said with a smile,””Then I’ll choose both! It’s not a waste of effort anyway! Let’s go buy some vegetables first. After we come back, I’ll go to the greenhouse to water and pick some vegetables!”

“That’s great!” He Jiong said happily,”I was just worried that I didn’t have enough manpower! President Xia, let’s go get some groceries!”

Generally speaking, there would be several guests in an episode, and these guests were more or less in contact, such as close friends or actors from the same crew. They would promote movies, TV series, and so on while appearing on the show. It was rare for there to be only one guest like this time.

In fact, it was more lively with more people, and it was easier to produce an interesting show effect. Besides, there were more people to share the work set by the festival team.

However, in order to show how much importance xiangnan TV placed on Xia ruofei, they had decided to use a single guest model for this episode.

“Alright!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”let’s go!”

He Jiong greeted the other three guests and left the house with Xia ruofei.

Walking down the steps in front of the mushroom house, a new Buick MPV was already prepared. Xia ruofei and he Jiong got into the car from both sides.

He Jiong was the pilot while Xia ruofei sat in the co – Pilot seat.

Cameras from different angles had been installed in the car so that they could capture the entire scene of He Jiong and Xia ruofei. Furthermore, two of the cameras were facing the inside of the car. In order to avoid appearing on the screen, the cameraman did not follow them. Instead, he got into another business car and headed to the grocery store. He still needed the cameraman to follow him and film the scene.

The two cars drove on the asphalt road inside the Paradise Club one after another. It didn’t take long for them to drive out of the club and head in the direction of little Tang town.

He Jiong and Xia ruofei were chatting along the way. Xia ruofei’s personality was considered gentle while he Jiong’s emotional intelligence was very high. Hence, the two of them were having a great time chatting.

Soon, the car arrived at a farmer’s market in Xiaotang town. After parking the car, Xia ruofei and he Jiong sat for a while. They only opened the door and got out after the cameramen in the back were in position.

He Jiong said with a smile,”we came here to take a look when we came to check out the place yesterday. The things available in this market are quite complete. We can basically buy all the ingredients we want to buy. There’s just a problem ... Our daily food expenses are only a hundred dollars, so we have to be careful with our expenses ...”

“A hundred? Everyone?” Xia ruofei asked, slightly surprised.

He Jiong nodded and said,”this episode’s pretty good. You’re the only guest.” We don’t even know how we’re going to survive the next few episodes ...”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.”Why don’t I save some money for you guys this week? We might as well not have any pork stewed with vermicelli, and just eat whatever is available!”

“That won’t do!” He Jiong said seriously,”we have to complete the dishes ordered by the guests no matter what. Otherwise, wouldn’t we be ruining our reputation?”

Xia ruofei thought for a while. Buying two pounds of pork and some noodles would not cost much, so he nodded and said,”Alright then! Let’s go in and take a look ...”

The festival team had already coordinated the shooting location in advance, so although the market was noisy, it was still quite orderly, and no one came up to affect the shooting.

He Jiong brought Xia ruofei to a meat stall. An older woman in her thirties greeted her warmly,”Teacher he, you’re here to buy groceries!”

“Yeah!” He Jiong chuckled and nodded. Big sister, pick us a good piece of streaky pork ...”

“Alright!” The woman grinned and cut off a large piece of streaky pork.”The quality of the pork today is absolutely first – Class. You can take it back and make it into red braised pork. It’ll definitely be twice as fragrant!”

When he Jiong saw that this big piece was at least six to seven Jin, he quickly said,”Big sister, we don’t want that much! Just one or two catties will do ...”

“There are so many of you, how can one or two catties of meat be enough?” the lady asked, puzzled.

After saying that, she pointed to the staff who were filming and said,””I saw dozens of you this morning, right?”

Xiangnan TV’s film crew was filming in Xiaotang town, so naturally, they couldn’t hide it from the local people. Some people even went to the nearby paradise gathering to watch the show. Moreover, the production team had also specially come to the market to check out the location, so the big sister was also very familiar with the situation.

Xia ruofei and he Jiong looked at each other and smiled. Xia ruofei smiled and said,””Big sister, someone else will be responsible for the staff’s meals. We only need to buy ingredients for five people ...”

“Oh! So that’s how it is!” The woman suddenly realized and said,”five people eating one or two pounds of meat is too little! Do you want to cut more?”

Xia ruofei laughed bitterly to himself,”we also want to buy more!” However, the budget was not enough!

“Big sister, one or two catties is enough ...” He could only say.

“Alright then!” The eldest sister saw that Xia ruofei and he Jiong were determined and did not try to persuade them anymore.

She looked at the piece of pork a few times and did some calculations in her heart. Then, she cut a small piece of pork with the knife.

The big sister threw the piece of pork onto the scale, then pointed to the display and said,””Two catties and one tael, I’ll count it as two catties for you!”

He Jiong could not help but exclaim,”wow! Big sister’s hands are really accurate!”
