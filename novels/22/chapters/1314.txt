Wei Jun continued,”big brother Jun, give me a day ... No!” I’ll get this done in half a day’s time. I’ll definitely give your friend an explanation, but I hope that Tongren Hall can continue with this business. The competition in the high – end Chinese medicinal herb Market is too fierce ...”

Zhao Yongjun said that on purpose. Although he had contacted the year of the crane Hall, they were still a bit weaker than Tongren Hall. It was not easy to buy over a hundred million worth of goods in one go.

The best choice would naturally be to continue cooperating with Tongren Hall.

So when Wei Jun said this, Zhao Yongjun went with the flow and said,””Alright then! Little Wei, I’ll leave this matter to you!”

“You’re too kind, brother Jun!” Wei Jun was a little flattered.”Brother Jun, since time is so tight, I’ll go back and take care of things. I’ll take my leave now!”

“Alright! Go do your work!” Zhao Yongjun smiled gently.”Liangzi, stay and have some tea with me!”

“Good, big brother Ying Jun!” Hou Liang stood up and said,”wait a moment. I’ll send Wei Jun out ...”

Zhao Yongjun nodded slightly.

Thus, Hou Liang brought Wei Jun out of the private room. Once they reached the door, Hou Liang said solemnly,””Wei Jun, you must treat this matter as your top priority! You can never imagine how important Xia ruofei is. Let me put it this way! He’s a few levels higher than me and Jun bro ...”

Wei Jun couldn’t help but take in a cold breath as he looked at Hou Liang with a hesitant expression.

In his eyes, Zhao Yongjun and the others were already the top second generation. This Xia ruofei was even a few levels higher than Zhao Yongjun. Was there such an amazing person in the circle of second generation in China? Even Zhao Yongjun’s father’s status wasn’t that high, right?

Hou Liang was well aware of Wei Jun’s thoughts. He patted Wei Jun’s shoulder and said, “It’s not convenient for me to explain it to you. It’s fine as long as you know it in your heart!”

Wei Jun’s heart trembled, and he hurriedly said,”I understand, don’t worry Liang bro! I know what to do!”

Hou Liang nodded and said,”alright, go!” Hurry up! If there’s any news, give me a call immediately. I’ll be with Jun bro the whole day. ”

“Understood!”

Wei Jun hurriedly left the teahouse.

He didn’t look for anyone and drove directly to the headquarters of the Tongren Tang Group.

When he went to the chairman’s office to ask, his Secretary told him that his father, Wei Jianming, was in a meeting, and the meeting was expected to be long.

Wei Jun became even more anxious when he heard this. He was like an ant on a hot pan. He paced back and forth in front of Wei Jianming’s office a few times before he finally made up his mind to take out his phone and call Wei Jianming.

In the group’s meeting room.

Wei Jianming was hosting a rather important meeting, mainly to discuss the group’s next strategy.

He was listening to a report from a middle – rank manager when his phone on the table suddenly vibrated.

Wei Jianming glanced at it and saw that it was his son, Wei Jun’s number. He frowned slightly and hung up.

After a while, his phone vibrated again.

This time, it was a text message.

Wei Jianming frowned slightly. He opened the message and saw that it was also from Wei Jun. Dad, I have a very urgent and important matter to talk to you about. I’m at the door of your office right now. It’s very important. Can you come out for a moment?

Wei Jianming thought, what could Wei Jun be looking for me for?

Although his son’s ability was not very outstanding, he was generally reliable. He was much better than some second – generation rich kids who spent their days drinking and playing. The two “very” in the message seemed to be quite urgent.

Wei Jianming put down his phone without a change in expression. He still looked like he was listening attentively, and he even wrote and drew in his notebook from time to time.

After a few minutes, the middle – Level officer finally finished his report.

Wei Jianming put down his pen and said with a pleasant expression,”Comrade Jianzhong’s speech was very comprehensive, and the points of view are also very high, giving me a lot of inspiration! Comrades, we’ve been in a long meeting, so let’s take a break now. We’ll continue in 15 minutes!”

As the head of the company and the host of the meeting, Wei Jianming could naturally control the pace of the meeting.

Moreover, the meeting had been going on for a long time, and everyone was getting drowsy, especially those who smoked heavily. They had long been looking forward to the break so that they could go out for a smoke.

After Wei Jianming finished speaking, everyone relaxed. Some sat in their seats and closed their eyes to rest, while others walked out in groups of two or three, distributing cigarettes to each other on the way.

After Wei Jianming closed his notebook, he stood up unhurriedly and walked out of the conference room.

Only when he turned the corner did he pick up his pace. In reality, he was also a little anxious, worried that Wei Jun would cause trouble outside, but he could not show it in front of his subordinates.

When he arrived at the door of his office, Wei Jianming saw Wei Jun waiting there like an ant on a hot pan.

“Dad ...” Wei Jun quickly called out when he saw Wei Jianming.

“Let’s talk in my office!” Wei Jianming interrupted Wei Jun and said.

The father and son walked into the office. Wei Jianming turned around and said to his Secretary,”I have something important to do here. No one is allowed to disturb me!”

“Okay, President Wei!” The Secretary quickly replied.

Wei Jianming closed the office door and glanced at his son. He asked,”Speak! What happened?”

“Dad!” Wei Jun quickly said. There’s an urgent matter that you might need to personally ask ...”

Wei Jun didn’t try to hide anything and told him everything that happened in the morning at peach blossom company. Of course, he didn’t forget to emphasize that Zhao Yong Jun and Hou Liang personally asked him to do this. He even told him everything that Hou Liang said to him at the door of the teahouse’s private room without holding back.

Wei Jianming’s expression changed slightly after he heard that. He said,”The Zhao Yongjun you’re talking about ...”

“He is the son of general Zhao!” Wei Jun quickly said.

Wei Jianming’s expression became even more cautious.

Although he had never heard of Xia ruofei’s name, Hou Liang’s father was his old leader and was now in a high position. Zhao Cheng was also famous in the capital. The sons of these two had come together to ask Wei Jun for this matter. Moreover, Hou Liang had even emphasized those words to Wei Jun in private. It could be seen how important Xia ruofei was.

“Who handled this matter before?” Wei Jianming asked.

“Brother Jun said it’s a purchasing manager called Chen shun, but I’m not sure which Department he’s from ...” Wei Jun said.

Wei Jianming thought for a moment and said, “I’ve never heard of this person. He’s probably from the chain company ...”

Wei Jianming pondered for a moment, then walked to the desk and picked up the landline to dial a number. He said,”Comrade Wei Ran, please come to my office.”

Wei Jun immediately knew that his father was calling Tang weiran, the Vice President of the Tongren Tang Group, who was in charge of the chain companies. He immediately felt a lot more at ease. He knew that his father had decided to take care of this matter and attached great importance to it.

Wei Jianming put down the phone and said to Wei Jun,”President Tang will be here soon. Please go to my lounge and wait for a while!”

“Alright!” Wei Jun said.

The chairman’s office was a large suite, and one of them was a bedroom specially used for resting. Wei Jun walked into the resting room with familiarity and closed the door.

Then, Wei Jianming used the internal line to inform his Secretary to bring him in as soon as Tang weiran arrived.

After a short while, there was a knock on the office door.

“Please enter!” Wei Jianming sat up straight behind his desk and said in a clear voice.

The office door was pushed open, and a slightly fat balding man walked in and said,””President Wei, you’re looking for me?”

Tang Wei Ran was the first senior executive of the group to lean towards Wei Jianming after he took office. So, Wei Jianming, who had just arrived, could only control the chain companies. He was secretly glad that this incident happened in the chain companies. If it had happened in the other subsidiaries, even if he was the chairman, things might not have gone so smoothly.

Wei Jianming smiled kindly and said,”Wei Ran is here! Please take a seat! There’s an urgent matter that might require you to personally handle ...”

Tang Wei Ran sat opposite Wei Jianming and smiled.””What are your instructions, President Wei? I’ll definitely carry it out!”

“Haha!” Wei Jianming laughed and said,”I might need you to go on a business trip. Also, it’s time to reorganize the chain companies!”
