2181 The awakening of the realm Fox (1)

Xia ruofei parked the car by the side of the road and entered the spirit map space to observe the White realmfox’s condition.

Now, it was still wrapped in a white cocoon of light. Xia ruofei’s spiritual energy could not penetrate it completely. He could only vaguely sense the white fox’s condition.

The little guy was stretching his forelimbs as if he was stretching. Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh. Did this guy really take a long nap? It didn’t feel like anything had changed!

At this moment, the white fox seemed to have opened its mouth.

Could it be yawning? Xia ruofei said in his heart.

However, the next scene made Xia ruofei’s eyes widen. The white fox opened its mouth and sucked. The White cocoon of light around it started to turn into rays of light and was sucked into its mouth.

There’s such an operation?

The White cocoon of light was very thick, and the rays of light seemed to be peeling off from the surface of the cocoon, and then they were absorbed by the realm Fox.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be amazed.

However, it seemed that the White realmfox would not come out for a while. At this rate, it would take a long time for it to finish eating the entire light cocoon!

Xia ruofei was still thinking about picking up Ling Qingxue. After some thought, he decided to put this matter aside and drive to buy some groceries.

Xia ruofei started the car again and drove to the nearby Walmart. He bought some organic pork and ribs. As for the vegetables and the Chinese perch that Ling Qingxue had personally ordered, they were all readily available in the interspace and did not need to be bought at the supermarket.

Soon, he walked out of the supermarket with a bag of groceries and drove back to the jiangbin villa community.

It had been more than ten days since anyone had lived in the villa, and there was a layer of dust on it.

After all, this was not the farm. Even if Xia ruofei was not at home, ye Lingyun would arrange for people to clean it regularly.

Xia ruofei placed the groceries he had bought from the supermarket into the refrigerator. Seeing that it was still early, he went to the garage and took out a mop, a rag, and other tools to start cleaning.

Although it was easy to hire a part – time cleaner, Xia ruofei enjoyed the process of cleaning by himself. Besides, he was full of energy. Although the villa was huge and there were many corners, he could do the cleaning very quickly.

After cleaning up the courtyard and the first floor, Xia ruofei looked at his watch. He felt that it was about time, so he put his tools aside and drove to the courtyard. He headed straight to the headquarters of Ling Ji F & B.

As Xia ruofei drove, he sent his thoughts into the spirit map space again to observe the White sector Fox’s condition. He realized that it was still tirelessly absorbing the White threads of light in the cocoon of light. In such a short time, the cocoon of light seemed to have become thinner. However, it should not be finished anytime soon.

Just then, his phone rang.

Xia ruofei’s phone was connected to the car’s Bluetooth after he got into the car. He glanced at the display on the car’s LCD screen and saw that it was a call from Ling Qingxue. He pressed the answer button on the Multi – Function Steering Wheel.

“Wife!” He said with a smile.

“Ruofei, I’m done here. Have you come over?” Ling Qingxue asked.

“He’s already on the way!” Xia ruofei turned to look outside and said,”we’ll be there in two traffic lights!”

“That’s great!” Ling Qingxue said,”I’m going downstairs!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said,”there’s a bit of traffic on the road ... If I’m not there by the time you get down, you can wait for me by the road!” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Okay, I know!” Ling Qingxue said.

Xia ruofei drove on the road that was starting to get stuck in traffic. After about ten minutes, he finally arrived at the headquarters of the Ling’s restaurant.

He turned the steering wheel and entered the building. From afar, he could see Ling Qingxue standing on the steps of the first floor, looking around.

Xia ruofei smiled, honked the horn, and drove the car over.

The Knight XV SUV was too eye – catching. When Ling Qingxue heard the horn, she turned her head and immediately noticed it. She immediately revealed a sweet smile and quickly walked towards the car.

Ling Qingxue was wearing a black business suit with a cream – colored shirt with a little lace. Her hair was also tied up, and she looked like a white – collar elite.

She opened the door of the passenger seat, held the handle with one hand, and got into the car easily with a little force.

The chassis of the Knight XV was so high that even a girl with less strength would have a hard time getting on it. Ling Qingxue could tell at a glance that this was the result of her cultivation.

“My wife, you’re so beautiful today!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Ling Qingxue glanced at Xia ruofei and asked,””You mean ... I wasn’t pretty before?”

“How did you get the meaning of this?” Xia ruofei said without hesitation,”my wife has always been so beautiful, but she’s even more beautiful today! He looks good!”

Ling Qingxue pursed her lips into a smile and said,”alright, your desire to live is quite strong ...”

“It’s a must!” Xia ruofei said with a smile as he started the car.

After Ling Qingxue fastened her seat belt, she turned around and sized Xia ruofei up. Then, she said,””You’re good! You didn’t get much tan after being out at sea for so many days!”

“Hehe ... I’m sleeping in the cabin most of the time ...” Xia ruofei smiled.”You’ll know when you have time next time. It’s actually very quiet at night on the sea. The yacht bobbed gently with the waves. Sleeping on the big soft bed feels like being in a cradle. It’s as if you’re a baby. Sleeping is so comfortable!”
