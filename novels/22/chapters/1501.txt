Chapter 1502: Seemingly real yet illusionary (1)

Translator: 549690339

Being in such an empty and quiet underground square, and having witnessed Xia ruofei disappear into thin air, Song Wei’s helplessness was imaginable.

Her delicate body trembled slightly. The light from the sky shone on the stone pillars and the altar, forming black shadows that looked like monsters in her eyes.

Song Wei could no longer go back. Even if she had a rope, she would not be able to climb up the 10 – meter height. Even if she did, how could she find the way out of the maze – like corridor?

Besides, Xia ruofei had disappeared without a trace and Song Wei would not leave him alone.

Song Wei bit her lower lip. She was having an intense internal struggle.

There were three paths in front of her, and she had already rejected the option of going back.

The only other option was to wait at the same spot. The other option was to walk to the altar like Xia ruofei did. Xia ruofei had disappeared there. If she walked there, would she be able to go to the place where Xia ruofei had disappeared?

However, Song Wei did not know what kind of danger she would face if she did that.

She stood at the edge of the stone platform and hesitated for a long time. In the end, she made up her mind and slowly walked towards the altar in the center of the stone platform.

Instead of sitting here and waiting for death, it was better to take a gamble and maybe meet up with Xia ruofei.

She walked carefully to the side of the altar and looked at the black stone on the stone plate in the center. She gritted her teeth and reached out her hand just like Xia ruofei.

Before her hand could even touch the world stone, a ray of light flashed and Song Wei disappeared from her spot.

......

Xia ruofei held the Zippo lighter and moved forward in the dark.

“Xia Qing, did you see what happened to Song Wei just now? was she injured?” he used his divine sense to communicate with Xia Qing.

“Master,” Xia Qing said with some surprise,”I only noticed a flash in front of my eyes, and then you came here. I didn’t see miss song’s situation.”

Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows and said,”a flash?” Didn’t the entire stone platform collapse just now, and I fell into the crack? I clearly saw Song Wei fall to the ground too. How could you not see anything?”

“This ...” Xia Qing also felt a little incredulous,”I really didn’t see anything ...”

Xia ruofei fell into deep thought. Everything that happened tonight was strange. Now, he was separated from Song Wei. The situation seemed to be out of his control.

“Master,” Xia Qing said at this time,”the suppression of spiritual will is getting stronger and stronger here. I ...”

Xia ruofei also clearly felt that Xia Qing’s divine sense voice transmission seemed to have become a little empty, as if she was speaking from a very far place.

His expression changed slightly, and he tried to contact the spirit map space with his mind.

After trying, he realized that his connection with the spirit map space had weakened a lot.

“How did this happen?” Xia ruofei was a little anxious.

Xia Qing’s voice also became urgent,””Master, this place’s suppression on spiritual force and divine sense is too strong, and it seems to be getting stronger and stronger. I can’t sense the outside world anymore! I’m worried that you’ll soon lose contact with the spirit map world!” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Xia ruofei’s mind was racing. He was already used to the existence of the spirit map space. Many things were placed inside and could be used at will. If he were to lose the connection to the spirit map space for the time being, then ...

Xia ruofei didn’t need Xia Qing’s reminder. He quickly realized what his priority was.

With a slight thought, he immediately took out the box containing the petals of the spirit Heart Flower from the spirit map space. In addition, he also took out a military dagger and a pistol.

This gun was taken out from the bedside table when Lu You was in danger at the bar. When Xia ruofei went over to save her, master Luo had taken it out. After Xia ruofei subdued master Luo, he naturally kept this pistol of unknown origin into the spirit map space without hesitation.

When he was retrieving the items, he could clearly feel that it was much more difficult than usual. His communication with the spirit map space was also continuously suppressed.

Xia ruofei took advantage of the fact that they could still contact each other and said to Xia Qing,””Xia Qing, take good care of the space. You don’t have to worry about the matters of the outside world. If I don’t come in again for a long time ...”

“Master, it definitely won’t happen!” Xia Qing said,”with your current strength, you can definitely turn danger into safety!”

“I hope so ...” Xia ruofei smiled bitterly.

He realized that his connection with the spirit map space was getting weaker and weaker, so he stopped talking and focused on dealing with the current situation.

He inserted the military dagger into a position on his Greave that could be reached at any time, then stuffed a few magazines full of bullets into his shirt pocket, and then loaded the bullets with a click.

Xia ruofei held the pistol tightly in his right hand and the Zippo lighter in his left hand as he continued to search.

After walking for a while, Xia ruofei suddenly felt a sense of danger. He subconsciously moved to the side.

Xia ruofei squinted his eyes at the dazzling light.

When he opened his eyes again, he couldn’t help but tremble. He was like a statue, standing in place with a dumbfounded look.

He found that the place he was in had completely changed. He was now standing in a tropical forest. The scorching sun shone through the gaps between the leaves, and the air was filled with a familiar moisture.

Xia ruofei was very familiar with this environment. When he was in the lone wolf assault team, he had carried out missions in the tropical forest many times.
