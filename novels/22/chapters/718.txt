Everyone found a shade and sat on the ground. They enjoyed the delicious lychees and cherries while listening to Xia ruofei’s instructions.

Xia ruofei said in an orderly manner,”first of all, I’ll personally be in charge of the sales of the fruits. I’ll contact some of my previous partners. It shouldn’t be a problem for all these fruits to be sold out.”

“Chairman, I just made an estimation. Each of our lychee trees can produce about 400 to 500 catties. The total output is estimated to be over 100000 catties!” The yield of each cherry tree was estimated to be about 200 catties, so the total yield was at least 40000 catties! Can we really sell all these fruits at once?”

The yield was shocking. A normal fruit tree would take at least three to four years to produce a large yield, but these trees had only been planted for about a year. Although Xia ruofei had bought the bigger saplings, the growth of these trees was far beyond that of the average fruit tree.

Thus, when the cherry and lychee trees bore fruit in April and May, Cao tieshu was also shocked.

Not only did these fruit trees grow extremely fast, but they would also bear fruits on a large scale in the second year. This was far beyond Cao tieshu’s knowledge.

Cao tieshu was an old farmer, and his estimated yield was about the same as Feng Rao ‘s.

This was considered a high yield even among fruit trees that were four or five years old.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”don’t worry!” I’m afraid that the production is too little and not enough for them to share!”

The Hengfeng group of the MA family of Hong Kong had already begun to diversify their operations. They were involved in the high – end fresh fruit industry and had many chain stores in China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Southeast Asia, specializing in high – Quality fresh fruits.

If MA Xiong knew that Xia ruofei’s Paradise Farm had such high – Quality lychees and cherries, he would definitely buy all of them and not share any with anyone else.

On the other hand, the winery had established very close cooperation with many of the country’s large chain merchants. Moreover, due to the popular sales and production control of drunken eight immortal, it was basically those large chain merchants who were trying to curry favor with the winery.

Hence, as long as Xia ruofei moved his lips, those super merchants would definitely fight to reserve the best fruit sales spot for paradise Corporation.

......

In addition, long – term partners such as the West River Moon Club and Ling Ji restaurant also welcomed this high – end fruit.

Therefore, although the output seemed high, if it was split up and given to these partners, it might even be stretched out.

However, these fruit trees were still in the growing stage, and the output should continue to rise in the next few years.

Especially the lychee tree, which had a lot of room for growth. There were many places in the South that had giant lychee trees that were hundreds or even thousands of years old. The output of a single tree could reach thousands of catties.

Seeing Xia ruofei’s confidence, Feng Jing didn’t say anything else. She knew Xia ruofei well and knew that this young Chairman wouldn’t do anything he wasn’t confident in.

Xia ruofei continued,”chief Feng, you’re mainly in charge of the packaging design and production of the fruits.” Just like before, find a company to design a relatively high – end exterior packaging. Our paradise corporation’s LOGO must be very eye – catching. ”

“Sure, no problem. Leave it to me!” Feng Jing nodded.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”let’s call them paradise brand premium organic lychees and paradise brand premium organic cherries!”

“Although it’s a bit hard to say, it’s not a big problem.” Feng Jing laughed.”I’ll get the designer to do a good job on it!”

Xia ruofei looked at Cao tieshu and said,””Old Cao, you’ll be in charge of the harvesting work. Once I’ve contacted the sales department and President Feng has settled the packaging problem, we’ll immediately start harvesting the fruits.”

“Alright, boss!” Cao tieshu grinned.

Xia ruofei said,”now, we can also make some preparations in advance, including tools and personnel.” The farm might not have enough manpower, so we can temporarily hire some villagers to help. ”

“I know! Don’t worry, boss!” Cao tieshu said.

Feng Jing added,”old Cao, these fruits are all of high quality, so we must be careful when we harvest them. We can’t cause any damage. It’s best if we come up with a set of standards and conduct simple training for the workers before harvest. We must emphasize that everyone is well – received.”

Xia ruofei said,”yes, yes, yes. This is also very important.” President Feng, I think you should send someone to understand the harvesting and packaging process of high – Quality fruits on the internet and help old Cao to come up with a set of standards. ”

“Yes, Chairman!” Feng ke said.

Cao tieshu was an uncouth fellow. When he first heard that he had to set the standards, he immediately felt like scratching his head. Fortunately, Xia ruofei immediately sent someone to help him, and his worries turned into joy.

At this moment, Lin Qiao spat out a cherry pit and asked,””Brother ruofei, what should I do?”

Xia ruofei smiled and touched Lin Qiao’s nose.””You! Just be responsible for eating! As long as you’re not afraid of getting angry, you can have as many lychees as you want! Uh ... I’ll have enough of cherry too!”

“Brother ruofei, you look down on me ...” Lin Qiao pouted.

Feng Rao smiled and said,”sister Lin Qiao, the chairman doesn’t think highly of you, but I do!” Since you have nothing to do during the summer break, why don’t you work with me on the fruit packaging design? I’ll just treat it as an early exposure to society and an early internship. ”
