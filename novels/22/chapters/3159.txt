There was a thin card inside the envelope, but this card was not a bank savings card, but a spending card for the Paradise Club.

Thirty thousand Yuan.

The instructions on the back of the card clearly stated that Qin Zhuan was not an informal membership card of the Paradise Club. It was just a storage card, but when there was a balance in the card, one could use this card to enjoy various services in the Paradise Club. After the balance was used up, the card would be taken back.

Moreover, there were different levels to stored – value cards. The card that Zhao Yongjun had given out was naturally of a high level. With this card, they could enjoy the same treatment as Gold members. Gold members were the second – tier members, and most of the facilities and services of the Paradise Club were open to Gold members.

This transportation fee was much more generous than a normal meeting. It could be said that they were not in the same order of magnitude at all.

Today, Wang Chi and the others had just enjoyed the hot springs, food, and other services of the Paradise Club for free, so they knew the prices of the services here were much more expensive than the outside world. Of course, the quality was also much higher.

Even so, 30000 Yuan was enough for them to bring their friends here to have fun. If they were the only ones here, it would be no problem to use it three or four times.

Wang Chi glanced at the card in Feng Xiaoyi’s hand. It was also 30000 Yuan.

It seemed like Zhao Yongjun didn’t distinguish between their identities and gave them the same card.

Needless to say, Guo Qian and Li Yufu also received the same gold storage cards.

Just this alone had already cost him 120000 Yuan.

Wang Chi calculated that the two meals alone cost tens of thousands of Yuan. There were also hot springs, saunas, and fitness ... All of them were very expensive.

Wang Chi couldn’t help but secretly sigh,”this is really a big move!”

Of course, from this perspective, Wang Chi could also see Xia ruofei’s position in the hearts of Zhao Yongjun and the others. This was no ordinary care. It could be said that they had considered everything and were very respectable.

Feng Xiaoyi asked carefully,”teacher, this ... Isn’t this a little too expensive?” I ... I don’t dare to take it, you can take it!”

Feng Xiaoyi was here today to do odd jobs for Wang Chi. He didn’t even get a chance to join in during the discussion. He was just a bystander. He came here and actually gave Wang Chi a 30000 Yuan storage card. He suddenly felt a little hot.

“Since it’s from director Zhao,” Wang Chi said indifferently,”you can just accept it. What’s there to worry about?”

“I didn’t do anything ...” Feng Xiaoyi said.

“Maybe President Zhao doesn’t care about this. His perspective of the problem is different.” Wang Chi said,”Xiaoyi, just keep it! Don’t you have a girlfriend recently? I’ll bring her here to play on the weekend. The environment here is quite good. ”

Naturally, Feng Xiaoyi wanted this stored – value card very much. However, he felt that he should not take a reward without doing anything. He felt a little uneasy in his heart. Since Wang Chi had said so, Feng Xiaoyi no longer had any concerns.

“Then ... Then Thank you, teacher!” He said carefully.

Wang Chi smiled and said,”why are you thanking me?” This is from director Zhao. If you want to thank someone, you should thank director Zhao and director Xia!”

“They’re only doing this because of you, teacher. The one I want to thank is naturally you, teacher!” Feng Xiaoyi said with a smile.

Even though he had a PhD, it didn’t mean he was a nerd. No matter how high an academic level a person was, it was impossible for them to be accepted as a disciple by an academician.

“Haha!” Wang Chi laughed and said,”you ... But speaking of thanks, I really have to make a phone call ...”

Wang Chi took out his phone and quickly found Xia ruofei’s phone number. While they were talking, Xia ruofei and Wang Chi exchanged phone numbers and they added each other on WeChat.

When Wang Chi called, Xia ruofei was still fighting at the table.

He glanced at the caller ID and saw that it was Wang Chi. He didn’t want to disturb his brothers ‘drinking, so he told Zhao Yongjun, who was beside him, and got up to answer the call outside the room.

“Academician Wang, you’re home already?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

“He’s still on the way!” Wang Chi smiled and said,”I just saw the gifts that director Zhao prepared for us. This is a very kind thought! You scared our little Feng!”

“Hahaha! Brother Zhao just wanted to express his gratitude. The gift is not about the weight, but the heart and sincerity!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”tell Dr. Feng to accept it without worry! There’s nothing inappropriate about that!”

Xia ruofei didn’t know what Zhao Yongjun had prepared for the experts, but since Wang Chi had called, it must be something expensive.

However, he didn’t intend to ask clearly. It was fine as long as he understood what his brother was doing.

No matter how valuable it was, it was nothing to people of Xia ruofei and Zhao Yongjun’s level. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“I still have to thank you!” Wang Chi said,”director Xia, not only did you provide us with a platform for Academic Exchange, you also let us teachers enjoy the service of a top club. After that, director Zhao even gave us such a valuable gift. This is all thanks to you, director Xia!”

Wang Chi was not a pedantic bookworm. He knew that the person he should thank was Xia ruofei, so he called Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”academician Wang, you’re too kind. We should be the ones thanking you!” Chen Xuan and I have benefited greatly from this exchange. It has been of great help to us!”

“In fact, the communication between Professor Guo, professor li, and I was a great inspiration for us. We got a lot of new inspiration through the collision! So let’s thank each other!” Wang Chi laughed and said.

“I wouldn’t dare!” Xia ruofei said.

“Mr. Xia,” Wang Chi said,”you’re organizing this exchange meeting. I guess you want to do something in the field of supercomputer application?”

“I do have plans in this area, but the idea isn’t very mature yet,” Xia ruofei said.

Of course, the matter of the token could not be known to the people of the secular world, so he could only vaguely explain it.

Wang Chi had been in academia for so many years, so he naturally knew the importance of confidentiality. He didn’t ask further, but smiled and said,””If you have any questions in the future, you can come to me at any time! We can discuss it together! Also, if you need to coordinate some supercomputers, I should be able to help!”

Xia ruofei’s eyes brightened. He had wanted to find someone through elder song and get them a supercomputer for their use, but asking elder song for help was a bit overkill.

Wang Chi happened to be a big name in his field. He was also an academician and a member of various committees. Wang Chi had a lot of say in the evaluation of titles and awards, so there wouldn’t be any problems if he were to coordinate things.

More importantly, supercomputers were very busy most of the time. If they wanted to occupy the time, they had to make use of every opportunity. If elder song came forward, no matter how difficult it was, they would have to squeeze out some time, which might delay the progress of some important scientific research projects.

Since Wang Chi had come forward, he would naturally assess the situation from a professional point of view and allocate his time in a scientific manner, so as to achieve the best of both worlds.

Xia ruofei was overjoyed,”that’s great!” I’ll have to thank you first, academician Wang!”

Wang Chi laughed and said,”just give me a call if you need anything!” I can still help you with this small matter!”

“Thank you! Thank you!” Xia ruofei said.

In the Mercedes – Benz, after Wang Chi hung up the phone, he said to Feng Xiaoyi,””We Chinese pay attention to reciprocity. Now, we can accept their kind intentions.”

Feng Xiaoyi smiled and said,””Teacher, you’re so thoughtful.”

Wang Chi smiled and then contacted Guo Qian and Li Yufu to talk about this “thought”. Soon, the three of them came to an agreement. If Xia ruofei needed any technical guidance in the future, they would spare no effort in contacting him, including when it came to coordinating the supercomputer.

After all, everyone had different resources at hand, so it was naturally easier to get things done by contacting many parties.

...

Furthermore, Guo Qian and Li Yufu had also received the same gifts. Wang Chi naturally wouldn’t let them idle around. It was only fair for everyone to work together!

……

In the Paradise clubhouse, Xia ruofei returned to the private room.

Zhao Yongjun clinked his glass with Xia ruofei’s and the two of them drank together. Then, Zhao Yongjun smiled and asked,””Is academician Wang looking for you?”

Xia ruofei laughed.”Brother Zhao, the gift you prepared is too expensive. I feel a little uneasy.”

“He’s just being polite!” Zhao Yongjun said,”he’s an academician, what hasn’t he seen? How can I not accept such a small gift?”

Xia ruofei laughed.”But brother Zhao, you’re very considerate. You’ve really helped me!”

“Oh?” Zhao Yongjun suddenly became alert.”What do you mean?”

Xia ruofei told Zhao Yongjun about what he had told Wang Chi on the phone. He smiled and said,””I was just thinking about who to ask for help with this super computer! Academician Wang offered to help us solve this problem, and if we have any technical questions, we can ask him at any time. Don’t you think this gift is very useful?”

Zhao Yongjun chuckled and said,”it’s a human society!” Everyone would carry a sedan of flowers! This academician Wang is an interesting person! Since he spared no effort to help you, I will definitely repay him at the appropriate time!”

Xia ruofei poured himself a glass of wine and said,””Brother Zhao, there’s no need to thank me. It’s all in the wine!”

...

“Hahaha! Good brother!” “Cheers!” Zhao Yongjun said forthrightly.
