Chapter 1616: Liu er_2

Xia ruofei nodded in understanding. He naturally would not get involved in this kind of thing and would just watch the show from the side.

After hearing song Rui’s words, Liu haofan laughed and said,””Song Rui, I really didn’t recognize you. Who knew that I would meet the famous young master Song in the capital in the wilderness!”

Song Rui was furious. How could he not see that Liu haofan did it on purpose just now?

But before he could speak, Zhao Yongjun waved his hand to stop him.

“Haofan,” Zhao Yongjun asked,”why are you in the mood today, coming to this God – forsaken place?”

Liu haofan smiled and said,”I heard that there’s a good piece of land here, so I came to take a look!” Why? Brother Zhao is also interested?”

Zhao Yongjun’s eyes narrowed, then he laughed and said,””We’re planning to work together on something. This piece of land is indeed within our scope of inspection!”

“Oh? It seems that great minds think alike!” Liu haofan smiled faintly and said,”but I advise brother Zhao to make other plans as soon as possible ...”

Song Rui couldn’t help but say coldly,””What do you mean by that? Who are you showing off to?”

Liu haofan shrugged and said,”I’m just telling the truth!” Originally ... This piece of land wasn’t that important to me, but now I’ve decided that no matter what price I have to pay, I’m going to get it. Even if I have to leave it here to grow grass after buying it, it doesn’t matter ...”

“Liu er, are you trying to argue with me?” song Rui gritted his teeth.

“Shallow! How can you be so emotional when it comes to business?” Liu haofan said lazily,”song Rui, it seems like you haven’t made any progress after being in Xiang Nan Province for so many years!”

“F ** K your big ...”

“Song Rui!” Zhao Yongjun didn’t wait for song Rui to finish his cursing and stopped him with a frown.

Then Zhao Yongjun looked at Liu haofan and said,””Haofan, it’s indeed useful for us to buy this piece of land. We’re all friends who grew up together. There’s no need to make things so awkward, is there?”

“Big brother Zhao, it’s not that I don’t want to give you face!” Liu haofan said with a smile. If you want to blame someone, blame song Rui ... Or you can kick song Rui out and I might consider it ...”

Xia ruofei watched from the side and couldn’t help but be speechless. This was a business worth hundreds of millions, and these young masters were using it as a dispute over personal feelings? Isn’t this too much of a joke?

“Don’t push your luck, Liu er!” Song Rui said coldly.

Zhao Yongjun waved his hand to stop song Rui. He looked at Liu haofan and said,””If that’s the case ... Then let’s all rely on our own abilities! Haofan, take your time, we still have something to do, so we’ll be leaving first!”

“Take care, big brother Zhao!” Liu haofan waved his hand.

He did not even look at song Rui.

Zhao Yongjun pulled the cursing song Rui into the car, and then everyone got into the car separately.

His originally good mood was instantly destroyed.

Since they wanted to discuss the next step of the plan, Xu Zixuan and Liu Jian got into Zhao Yongjun’s car. The three of them squeezed into the back seat with song Rui, and Xia ruofei sat in the front passenger seat.

As for the other two cars, they were driven by Hou Liang and Wei Jun, following behind Zhao Yongjun’s car.

After the car started, song Rui was still cursing,””F * ck! This son of a B * tch Liu er, he’s just like a ghost that won’t leave ...”

Zhao Yongjun gave Xu Zixuan a look, and Xu Zixuan immediately took out his phone and started to ask for information.

The car came out from the simple road. When it turned back to the main road, Liu haofan’s Knight XV off – Road vehicle could be seen from the other side.

Xia ruofei looked in that direction almost subconsciously. He couldn’t help but be shocked and shouted,””Brother Zhao, stop the car!” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Zhao Yongjun quickly stepped on the brakes and stopped the car. Hou Liang and Wei Jun didn’t expect Zhao Yongjun to suddenly stop, so they had to brake and almost rear – ended him.

“What’s wrong ruofei?” Zhao Yongjun asked.

Song Rui also said,”ruofei, you’re not thinking of helping your bro beat up Liu er, are you?” This ... We shouldn’t be too rash. House Liu isn’t just any Noble House ...”

Xia ruofei was focused on the land they had just inspected. After hearing song Rui’s words, he couldn’t help but roll his eyes and say,””Can you not feel so good about yourself?”

Xia ruofei got out of the car and looked in Liu haofan’s direction. It was his first time looking at the plot of land from this angle.

Xia ruofei calculated quickly and silently. At the same time, he verified some things in his mind and finally came to a conclusion.

He took a deep look at the Knight XV and then turned around to get on the carriage.

“RUO Fei, what’s the situation?” Zhao Yongjun asked.

“It’s nothing. We’ll talk about it later ...”Xia ruofei smiled.

“I hate it when you keep me in suspense!” Song Rui said with dissatisfaction.

“You won’t understand even if I tell you,” Xia ruofei retorted sarcastically.”I’ll keep you in suspense to avoid a blow ...”

Zhao Yongjun couldn’t help but laugh.

At this time, Xu Zi Xuan, who had been quietly talking on the phone in the back seat, finally hung up the phone, and his expression became a little ugly.

Zhao Yongjun saw Xu Zixuan’s expression through the rearview mirror and frowned slightly, asking,””Xuan Zi, how is it?”

“Brother Zhao, song Rui, the situation doesn’t look good!” Xu Zixuan said with a bitter face.

“What’s wrong?” Song Rui asked.

“I’ve heard that Liu haofan might be collaborating with Tang real estate this time, and he’s determined to get this land!”Xu Zixuan said.

Song Rui and Liu Jian gasped at the same time, and their expressions turned even worse.

Tang real estate could be said to be the Star Real Estate company in the whole of China. It had real estate in almost every big and medium – sized city in the country, and could be said to be rich and overbearing.

If they were really interested in the 15 – acre land and were willing to pay a premium price, his side had no chance of winning.

In addition, Liu haofan’s financial resources were much stronger than song Rui ‘s.

This wasn’t because Liu haofan was capable, but mainly because he had a super – money – making brother named Liu Ruofan. He was less than 30 years old, but he managed the extraordinary group to have ten billion Yuan in assets.

Liu Ruofan especially doted on his younger brother, Liu haofan, and would generally not refuse Liu haofan’s requests. If Liu haofan got involved with the extraordinary group and joined forces with the Tang real estate, it would be very difficult for others to get a share of this land.

Zhao Yongjun was still relatively calm. He asked,””You’ve inquired clearly? Did Liu haofan really want to cooperate with Tang real estate? There’s no problem with the source of the information, right? Could it be a smokescreen deliberately released by Liu haofan to make some people retreat?”

“Big brother Zhao, the source is absolutely reliable!” Xu Zi Xuan said. I’m afraid he really did ride on the coattails of the Tang real estate company ...”

For a moment, the atmosphere in the car became a little dull, and everyone’s mood was down.

It wasn’t easy for them to find such a place that met their requirements in all aspects, but it was very likely that someone else would take advantage of them. This feeling was really unpleasant!

No one spoke in the car. In the silence, only the sound of the engine could be heard faintly through the soundproof window.

After a long time, Liu Jian said hesitantly,”brother Zhao, young master Rui, brother Xia, why don’t we ... Inspect the other plots?” There’s no need to fight to the death with Liu haofan ...”

“No!”

“No!”

Two voices were heard almost at the same time. It was Xia ruofei and song Rui.

Song Rui couldn’t help but look at Xia ruofei and said,””RUO Fei is my brother! How could he cower before the battle? Regardless of the extraordinary group or the Tang Group, they would always pursue profit, right? I don’t believe they’ll spend 1 billion or 2 billion to compete with us. Wouldn’t they be fools?”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but roll his eyes. “Aren’t you overthinking things, kid? I’m not opposing and avoiding the sharp edge for you!”
