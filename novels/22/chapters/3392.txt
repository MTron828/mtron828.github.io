Chapter 3393: The Tower of Trials “sixth floor_l

Translator: 549690339

“Then let’s find the exit first!” Ling Qingxue said.

“Mm! This time coming to the 5th level of the trial Pagoda, the harvest can be considered not small!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”this set of highest heaven formation flags is more precious than all the previous gains combined!”

Xia ruofei carried Ling Qingxue and jumped onto the qushuang flying sword. Then, they followed the instructions on the perceptual mirror map and flew in the direction of the passage to the sixth floor.

Along the way, the two of them would occasionally come across star Fern thorns. Xia ruofei would habitually check them first, but they were all ordinary star Fern thorns, so he would go around them and continue moving forward. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

After flying for about an hour, Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue arrived at the spot of light indicated on the perceptual map.

Actually, Xia ruofei could see from afar that there were many star Fern thorns growing here. These star Fern thorns were no longer growing close to the ground. Instead, they were wrapped around like vines, forming the shape of an arch.

Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue were both very familiar with the light screen at the entrance of the tunnel. It was inside this “arched door”.

Seeing this, Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but frown and ask,’”RUO Fei, could this be the entrance to the sixth floor? There are so many star Fern thorns, why don’t we go over?”

Xia ruofei pondered for a moment.’These star Fern thorns form an arched door. We really can’t use an array to burn it. What if the star Fern thorns are burned out and the passageway is gone?”

“Yup!” Ling Qingxue said, frowning.

Xia ruofei landed his flying sword at a safe distance and said to Ling Qingxue,””I’ll go check out the situation first. You stay here and be careful!”

“It’s too dangerous for you to go there like this!” Ling Qingxue said as she grabbed Xia ruofei’s hand.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”but we re already at the entrance of the passage. We can’t just stop because of a few star Fern thorns, can we?” 1’11 go and investigate first! My cultivation level is higher than yours, so if there’s any danger, I can handle it!”

Ling Qingxue had seen the power of the star Fern’s thorn. She held Xia ruofei’s hand and said,””Ruofei, let’s think of another way! It’s too dangerous for you to go there so rashly!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”of course I have a way to save my life. You don’t have to worry!” And … I feel that this star Fern thorn is a little different from the ones we’ve encountered before. It gives me a peaceful feeling, as if… It has been tamed. As for the specific situation, we still have to try to find out!”

After hearing Xia ruofei’s words, Ling Qingxue let go of her hand and said,””Then you must be careful!”

“I know! Don’t worry!” Xia ruofei smiled and patted the back of Ling Qingxue’s hand.

After Ling Qingxue let go of Xia ruofei, he stepped onto the qushuang flying sword and flew towards the “arched door” with full vigilance.

He also released his mental force, constantly paying attention to the star Fem thorns that formed an arch door.

Before the star Fern thorn launched an attack, there were also signs. For example, most of the star Fern thorns would suddenly contract and then release thorns. If he used his spiritual power to investigate, he would be able to find the signs earlier.

Xia ruofei slowed down and advanced towards the arched door. He was on full alert, but the star Fern thorns were very calm and had no intention of attacking.

If Xia ruofei could not sense the strong life force, he would have thought that these star Fern thorns were fake.

Not only could he sense the life force of the star Fern thorn, but he could also sense a trace of a peaceful aura. This aura was not meant to ease Ling Qingxue’s heart.

Just like that, Xia ruofei reached the arch door. He even reached out to touch the familiar screen.

Those star Fern thorns were still obediently standing there, with no intention of launching an attack.

In the distance, Ling Qingxue was also holding her breath. She looked at Xia ruofei without blinking. As Xia ruofei got closer and closer to the arch, she became more and more nervous. Her heart was about to jump out of her throat.

She only felt at ease when Xia ruofei touched the light screen and flew back on his sword.

“Qingxue, it looks like these star Fern thorns aren’t aggressive. Let’s go over directly!” Xia ruofei said.

Ling Qingxue looked at the dense cluster of star Fern thorns and still felt a little scared. However, she still nodded bravely and said,””Alright!”

With Xia ruofei by her side, she would feel much more at ease.

Xia ruofei held onto Ling Qingxue’s soft hands and said,””Don’t be afraid. If there’s any danger, 1’11 definitely be able to protect you. As long as you completely relax and don’t resist, it’ll be fine!”

Xia ruofei would definitely have prepared for the worst. Once the star Fern thorn suddenly attacked, he would definitely not be able to Dodge and protect Ling Qingxue at the same time. Thus, he had to use the spirit map space.

This was not the first time Xia ruofei had reminded Ling Qingxue of this, so she simply nodded and said,””Understood!”

“Then let’s go!”

Xia ruofei held Ling Qingxue’s hand and stepped onto the qushuang flying sword. Then, they carefully flew in the direction of the arched door.

Soon, the two of them entered the twenty – meter range.

According to Xia ruofei’s experience, this range was basically the attack range of the star Fern thorn.

When Xia ruofei had flown over by himself, he was not too worried. Now that he had Ling Qingxue with him, he was honestly under a lot of pressure..
