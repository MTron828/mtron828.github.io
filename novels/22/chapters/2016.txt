When Lu zhengfeng heard this, he subconsciously said,Mr. Xia, I’m afraid the difficulty of assassinating so many important targets at the same time ...

Lyu hai didn’t wait for Lyu zhengfeng to finish his words, he hurriedly interrupted him,No problem! We’ll do as Mr. Xia says!

Lyu zhengfeng couldn’t help but look at Lyu hai with his eyes wide open. Xia ruofei’s plan looked beautiful, but in fact, it was almost impossible. Lyu zhengfeng didn’t understand why Lyu hai didn’t object at all.

He didn’t believe that lui hai couldn’t see how unrealistic it was to assassinate so many high – Level members of the Gelman family at the same time.

Lyu hai didn’t pay attention to Lyu zhengfeng, but continued,Mr. Xia, if you need us to cooperate, just tell us! We’ll follow your orders!

Lui hai knew that Xia ruofei must be confident since he mentioned it. The power of these Masters was beyond their imagination. Since Li Yifu revealed a little bit to him last night, lui hai had no more doubts about Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei looked at lui hai and smiled,Just now, zhengfeng felt that the targeted elimination mission was more difficult, so I’ll take care of it. What I need you to do is to provide intelligence support! The more detailed the target’s information, the better. Also, send one or two people to cooperate with me and be in charge of communication ...

Lui hai said without hesitation,Mr. Xia, I’ll work with you!

Xia ruofei thought for a while and nodded.Alright. Also, zhengfeng, mobilize all the people in your branch in Turin. After I start the operation, there will be chaos in the Gelman family. You must seize the opportunity and attack them from all sides, and try to defeat them in one fell swoop!

Alright! Lyu zhengfeng seemed to be affected by Xia ruofei’s confidence or out of his trust in Lyu hai. This time, he nodded his head and agreed.

Xia ruofei said,one last thing to emphasize. Launch multiple attacks at the same time. If any of you encounter any difficulties, contact ah hai immediately. I will rush over to help!

Understood! Lu zhengfeng replied.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,alright. You guys go and deploy your men first. Increase the intelligence gathering. I’m going to rest for a while. I need to recharge my energy!

Then, Xia ruofei said to lui hai,Ah hai, when the time is right, just call me! Let’s try to finish everything in one fell swoop tonight and let the glory Association not have time to react!

Lui hai felt his blood boiling as if he had returned to the days when he was young and fought together with the brothers of the Hong sect. He puffed out his chest and said,Yes!

Xia ruofei turned around and went back to his room.

Before Lyu zhengfeng said anything, Lyu hai said directly,Zhengfeng, say no more! As long as it’s Mr. Xia’s orders, we’ll do it to the letter! Don’t ask me why, if I could tell you, I would have told you long ago!

I know! Lu zhengfeng smiled bitterly. Big brother hai, you ... When you’re with Mr. Xia, you have to be careful ...

It didn’t matter to Lu hai as he had prepared in advance. But it was extremely dangerous for Lu hai to follow Xia ruofei. He might lose his life if he wasn’t careful.

Lui hai said unhappily,I will be very safe with Mr. Xia! You should worry about yourself! Don’t screw it up! Otherwise, you can quit your position as the branch boss!

I don’t know where you get your confidence from ... Lu zhengfeng muttered.

However, after being glared at by lui hai, he didn’t dare to say anything more. He hurriedly pulled some core members and started to arrange people.

Although the Gelman family had not been in Turin for a long time, they had taken over almost all of the properties of the Moore family, so they had a large territory and a lot of properties. They had to be prepared for an attack in advance. In a situation where they were short on manpower, it was also a test of Lu zhengfeng and the others ‘ability to coordinate.

But Lyu hai was not worried about this. Lyu zhengfeng was not a greenhorn anymore. He was able to take charge of the Turin branch not only because of his relationship with Lyu hai but also because of his leadership ability. But he was not as smart as Lyu hai and did not know how to be flexible.

......

The night slowly descended.

As usual, there was a sense of leisure in the bustling city. No one noticed that some Chinese people in Turin had secretly gathered together ...

After the dinner, Xia ruofei left the building with lui hai.

During the day, Monica and Rousey had come to look for Xia ruofei as they were worried about their situation. However, Xia ruofei did not tell the siblings about tonight’s operation. He only consoled them and told them to stay here for a few days without worry.

Xia ruofei also told them that the storm would soon subside.

This time, Xia ruofei had the intention to kill the Gelman family because of Monica.

If Toles did not covet Monica, perhaps Xia ruofei would not have taken such extreme measures.

Now, the Gelman family had clearly touched Xia ruofei’s bottom line.

It was not advisable to kill indiscriminately, but Xia ruofei did not feel any psychological pressure when killing a notorious mafia organization like the Geerman family.
