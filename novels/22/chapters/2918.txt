Even fewer people knew her private phone number.

Charlie naturally paid more attention to it. He looked at the number recorded on the satellite phone, only to find that it was a completely unfamiliar number. It was not even a common number in the United States

When Charlie saw the number, he was stunned for a moment. Then, he quivered and thought of a possibility. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

He quickly used the satellite phone to dial a number. It was the cell number of his trusted aide, Peter.

“God! Boss, are you alright?” Peter asked excitedly after picking up.

Charlie was not in the mood to talk nonsense with Pierre and said,””I’m already on the rescue helicopter. There’s something I need you to do right now. It’s extremely urgent!”

“Please give me your orders, boss!” Pierre quickly said.

“I can’t connect to the internet at the moment. Can you help me check the origin of a phone number?” Charlie said.

“No problem! Could you please give me your number?” Peter said.

” 8613 ...” Charlie suddenly stopped and said in a serious tone,”Pelter, remember, don’t check anything about this number. Just confirm the origin!” Also, don’t tell anyone about this number!”

“Understood!” Pierre said without hesitation.

Only then did Charlie report the phone number he had just recorded to Pierre.

In fact, when phone numbers in the Huaxia mainland dialed an international number, it would display the International dial code starting with 86. However, this was a long string of numbers connected together. Moreover, Charlie was busy every day and would not remember the Huaxia dial code, so he could not confirm it. He had asked Pierre to check it first.

After reporting the numbers, Charlie said, ” “Check it now, don’t hang up!”

” Boss, I’m already looking it up ...” Pierre said as he turned on the search engine on his laptop. ” I found it! Boss, this number is from the Huaxia mainland. Only when an international long-distance call is made from the Huaxia mainland will the International dial number 86 be displayed in front of the number.”

” God ...” Charlie couldn’t help but Mutter after hearing it.

Pierre was shocked and quickly asked, ” “Boss, what happened? ”

“I’m fine! We’ll talk about it when I’m back!” Charlie said, ” remember, you must keep the number I asked you to check a secret. It’s best to forget it from now on! ”

“I know, boss!” Peter said.

Charlie hung up the phone in a hurry and immediately searched for the number that Xia ruofei had just called. He called back immediately while holding his forehead and mumbling to himself, ” “Dammit! I actually hung up on him, damn it ...”

The rescue team member sitting across from him was also shocked. He thought that Charlie was feeling unwell and quickly asked, ” “Mr. Cohe! What was the problem? Do you need my help? ”

Charlie Koch hurriedly waved his hand and placed his index finger on his lips, signaling for the rescue team to keep quiet. He had already heard the other party’s phone ring.

……

Xia ruofei was still on his way to ishwaatlan. When his phone vibrated, he took it out and saw that it was an unfamiliar number. The long string of numbers looked very strange. He had just called the number Charlie had left for him, but Charlie had used a satellite phone to call back.

Xia ruofei’s number was rarely used. He would only use it when he was using Xia Tian’s identity. Most of the time, his phone was turned off, so very few people knew this number. Hence, his first reaction was that it was a harassment call. After all, this number looked like an Information Station number that had been changed by a software.

However, after thinking for a while, he still picked it up. ” “Hello, who is this? ”

Charlie was sitting in the rescue helicopter. At this time, he had already connected the satellite phone to the helicopter’s noise-canceling headphones, so he could hear it very clearly. He was almost certain that this young voice was the voice of the eastern deity who had descended from the sky and saved his life last night.

“Hello, I’m Charlie cohe. Are you the eastern ...”Charlie could not help but ask in a trembling voice.

At this point, Charlie stopped abruptly because there were still several rescue team members in the cabin. He definitely could not reveal the matter of the eastern deity.

Just as Charlie was in a dilemma, Xia ruofei said directly, ” “It’s me, you’re right!”

“Is it inconvenient for you to talk now? “Xia ruofei asked immediately.

“I’m fine!”Charlie quickly replied. He was fine! If you have any orders, please tell me!”

Although the rescue team member sitting opposite him could not hear Charlie’s words clearly due to the loud noise in the cabin, he could see Charlie’s reserved and respectful posture. He could not help but secretly marvel at the influence of Youyou, who had a net worth of hundreds of billions of dollars in America. He was definitely a top boss! Who else could make such a Big Shot act so humbly?

Charlie looked at the rescue team members opposite him and subconsciously covered his mouth with his hand. He did not want these people to see the shape of his mouth.

In fact, it was indeed a little inconvenient for him to speak now. After all, outsiders could never know about the eastern immortal. Otherwise, he was not sure if the immortal would be unhappy. However, the other party had taken the initiative to call him at this time. It was obvious that there was something for him to do. It was not appropriate for him to say that it was not convenient to talk now and that he would contact him later.

In front of a God, he didn’t dare to show any neglect!

However, Xia ruofei could hear it. He smiled and said,””Charlie, I heard a lot of noise next to you. You must have been rescued and are on the rescue plane now?”

“Yes, I am!” Charlie replied respectfully,”I can’t hide anything from you!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”alright then!” I’m not in such a hurry. I’ll wait for your plane to land! You can find a place with no one around and call me back. ”

Charlie’s heart relaxed slightly and he quickly said, “No problem, but I’ll have to trouble you to wait!”

“It’s fine, I’m not in a hurry!” Xia ruofei said with a smile and then hung up.

On the rescue helicopter.

Charlie held the satellite phone and was silent for a few seconds before he gradually calmed down. He switched the noise – canceling headphones on his head to the cabin – Level communication mode and said, “Mr. Captain, please speed up. I have something urgent to deal with as soon as I land!”

“Alright, Mr. Cohe!” The captain quickly replied. I’ll fly at my highest speed as soon as possible!”

“How long is it expected to reach the rescue ship?” Charlie asked.

“It’ll take about 45 minutes if we fly normally. ” The captain replied,”if you’re in a hurry, I can try to arrive within half an hour.”

“Very good!” Charlie cohe said,”if you can be faster within half an hour, I will give you a million US dollars for every minute that you arrive earlier! Mr. Captain, please fly back as much as you can!”

The captain was stunned for a moment, then immediately said with some excitement,” “No problem! Mr. Cohe, please fasten your seat belt. The comfort level might decrease for the rest of the flight!”

“OK!”Charlie cohe said.

Then, he felt the head of the helicopter sink slightly, and then the speed suddenly increased.

For the rest of the voyage, Charlie Koch clutched the satellite phone in his hand tightly. He would look out the porthole almost every few seconds, trying to see if the rescue ship had appeared in his field of vision.

Every second that passed, he felt the pressure increase, because the immortal was waiting for his call! It’s a sin to let the Lord deity wait for one more second!

Finally, after flying for more than 20 minutes, Charlie Koch saw a rescue boat appearing not far below the plane. The “H” logo on the White helipad on the deck was already clearly visible ...
