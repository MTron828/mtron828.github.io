Chapter 1706: The seniority is in a mess (3)

Translator: 549690339

“In – Name disciple?” Xia Qing was also confused.

Hence, Xia ruofei told her about the Guiyuan Scripture. Xia Qing then remembered that Xuanji’s incident was really a trivial matter in the long years of cultivation of immortal mountain river. If it wasn’t recorded in the human jade talisman, Xia Qing would not have remembered it.

After confirming the condition of the spirit map space’s previous owner, Xia ruofei looked at the White – haired old man in front of him with a headache.

Xia ruofei was really not used to having such an old Grand – disciple.

Xu Ziyuan and Tang Yitian’s brains crashed. They felt like they were listening to a fairy tale. It was so unreal.

A figure from hundreds of years ago was actually Xia ruofei’s senior?

The well – respected Li Yifu was actually Xia ruofei’s Grand – disciple?

Then these people simply had no seniority!

Only Tang Haoran was still as carefree as before.

Tang Yitian thought for a while, but he still couldn’t help but say,””Grandpa li, do you want to confirm this? If there’s a mistake ...”

Li Yifu flew into a rage upon hearing this and rebuked,””Shut up! Yi Tian, do you really think that I’m an old fool? How can you make a mistake for such a big matter?”

Of course, Li Yifu was not an old fool.

Those who could say the origin returning Scripture were definitely from the same line as Daoist master mountain river.

Furthermore, Xia ruofei had specifically mentioned Xichuan and that the successor’s surname was li. Among the siblings, only he, who had also embarked on the path of cultivation, knew about li beihuai. This was an absolute secret in the Li family and could not be leaked.

Most importantly, Xia ruofei had such a terrifying level of cultivation at such a young age. Moreover, any random disciple he had was about to break through to Qi disciple Level 2 when he was eight or nine years old. It could be seen how deep the heritage was.

How could such a descendant of a famous sect lie about this matter? What was she after? Worldly wealth? In the eyes of cultivators, this was equivalent to dung and not worth mentioning at all. Inheritance? The other party’s inheritance was countless times better than his. He might even have the complete “origin returning true scroll”. How could he take a fancy to his incomplete cultivation method?

As for Xia ruofei, he had basically confirmed the origin of Li Yifu’s bloodline.

On one hand, there was proof from the last paragraph of the Guiyuan Scripture. Li beihuai’s name was also mentioned by Li Yifu. More importantly, Li Yifu had accurately said the Daoist name of the spirit map space’s previous owner that even Xia ruofei himself was not clear about. This was enough to prove the authenticity.

Li Yifu’s seniority was there, so Tang Yitian didn’t dare to say anything after being scolded. He could only step aside.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”Li Qian ...”

After saying these two words, Xia ruofei saw that Li Yifu was about to kneel down again. He quickly stopped the car and said awkwardly,””This ... It’s been so long, and we’re not from the same branch. I don’t think there’s a need to strictly talk about seniority, right? You’re a nearly 90 – year – old man, calling me martial granduncle, I also feel quite awkward ...”

Li Yifu said sternly,”senior granduncle, you’re wrong!” As cultivators, we must first respect our teachers. You’re Grandmaster Shanhe’s disciple, which means you’re my uncle – Master, so this seniority can’t be messed up!”

“But ...” Xia ruofei forced a smile.

He pointed at Tang Yitian and the others and said,””If that’s the case, then wouldn’t the seniority of big brother Tang and I be even more chaotic?”

Xia ruofei’s words reminded Li Yifu of something. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

He looked in Tang Yitian’s direction, then quickly walked in front of Tang Haoran, and respectfully called out,””Your adopted husband greets martial uncle Tang!”
