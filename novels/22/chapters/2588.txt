2589 The answer is obvious (2)

Xia ruofei thought for a moment and took out a set of silver needles from his bag. He used the nine needles of cloud contact to lock elder Liu’s life and temporarily suppress the cancer cells.

Of course, when the condition was so serious, it was impossible to completely eliminate the cancer cells with simple acupuncture. To put it bluntly, it was only a temporary solution and not a permanent one. It could only delay the treatment. If one really wanted to cure the disease, they still had to rely on the ingredients of the spirit Heart Flower petals.

At least until now, in the face of these injuries in the secular world, the composition of the spirit Heart Flower petals could be said to be successful in every endeavor, and there had never been a case of failure.

However, Xia ruofei would definitely not take out the petals of the spirit Heart Flower so easily. He had to find out what was going on first. At least, he could not take the blame.

Moreover, when he thought about the spirit Heart Flower petals that had been consumed in the early stages of the treatment, which was equivalent to a waste, he felt a burst of displeasure. He had no relationship with the Liu family, and now he had to pay so much more. At least he had to let the Liu family know what was going on.

On this basis, his losses would naturally be borne by the Liu family.

With this in mind, Xia ruofei walked out of old master Liu’s room.

The two big men who had been on duty at the stairway immediately came over when they saw this. One of them asked respectfully,””Mr. Xia, what can I do for you?”

“Go on, Liu Qunfeng, please come over!” Xia ruofei said indifferently, then turned around and went back to his room.

“Yes!”

After a while, Liu Qunfeng arrived at elder Liu’s room.

Liu Qunfeng saw that his father was still unconscious, but there were a few more silver needles on his body. For some reason, even though elder Liu still looked the same, Liu Qunfeng felt a little more at ease. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Mr. Xia, have you found the reason for my father’s deterioration?” Liu Qunfeng asked with a hint of anticipation.

Xia ruofei nodded.”I’ve made a preliminary judgment after the inspection. However, I still need to verify it.”

At this point, Xia ruofei paused and asked,””The batch of pills I left behind should still be there, right?”

“There are still a lot of pills,” Liu Qunfeng said.”They’re all in the fridge next door.”

“Is it convenient for you to take me there?” Xia ruofei asked.

“Of course!” “Mr. Xia, this way please!” Liu Qunfeng said.

Then, Liu Qunfeng personally led Xia ruofei to the room next door.

This room was connected to elder Liu’s room. There were usually medical staff stationed here, and there was also someone guarding the refrigerator where the pills were stored 24 hours a day.

As Xia ruofei did not like to be disturbed while he was in the middle of treatment, Liu Qunfeng had sent all the staff away, leaving only a man in Black to guard the refrigerator.

The burly man saw Liu Qunfeng and Xia ruofei walking over and quickly bowed to greet them.

“Is everything normal here?” Liu Qunfeng asked.

“Yes, since I took over the shift, no one has entered this room!” The black – robed man replied respectfully.

“You may leave now!” Liu Qunfeng nodded.

“No need!” Xia ruofei suddenly said,”just let him stay here!”

The reason he had called Liu Qunfeng over was so that he could be a witness. He didn’t want the Liu family to think that he was the one who had tampered with the pills.

Besides, Xia ruofei also had some questions to ask the Man in Black who was in charge of guarding the pills, so he asked him to stay and be a witness.

The Man in Black looked at Liu Qunfeng. Whether he stayed or left was up to Liu Qunfeng.

Liu Qunfeng nodded slightly, and the Man in Black immediately said,””Yes!”

Then he walked to the side and stood straight.

Xia ruofei said,”brother, there’s no need to stand so far away.” Please open the refrigerator and take out the rest of the pills. ”

“Yes!” The Man in Black said.

After getting Liu Qunfeng’s permission, the Man in Black walked over and opened the refrigerator door. He carefully took out a Tupperware.

There were pills in the Tupperware. Each pill was wrapped in a film and stacked in the Tupperware.

There were at least twenty or thirty pills left, which meant that under normal circumstances, these pills could still be used for about a month.

Xia ruofei ordered,”open the lid!” I want to see these pills!”

“Open the lid!” Liu Qunfeng immediately ordered.

“Yes!” The Man in Black replied, and then carefully opened the lid of the container.

In fact, Xia ruofei’s mental power had already scanned every pill. The reason he had asked the Man in Black to open the box was to let Liu Qunfeng see it more clearly.

After using his spiritual power to investigate, Xia ruofei had already concluded that the problem was with the pill.

Although the pills did not seem to have changed much, Xia ruofei’s spiritual power could detect them. The spirit Heart Flower petal composition in each pill had disappeared.

Without the petals of the spirit Heart Flower, these pills were just the most ordinary tonics.

It was no wonder that the pill had no effect on old man Liu.

Moreover, without the suppression of the petals of the spirit Heart Flower, the cancer cells in old man Liu’s body naturally started to become active again, and then slowly ate away at his body.

Pancreatic cancer developed very quickly. A week’s time was enough to make all the previous treatments go to waste. The situation was even worse than before Xia ruofei’s intervention.
