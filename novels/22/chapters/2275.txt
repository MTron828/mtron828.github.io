2276 Virtue and tolerance (2)

The four words “virtue and tolerance” were presented in front of everyone. The strokes were vigorous and powerful, revealing a stern aura unique to people in the military, but there was no sense of disharmony. It seemed to interpret the profound meaning of these four words from another angle.

“Good writing!” Xia ruofei couldn’t help blurting out.

He knew that elder song was giving him encouragement, but at the same time, it was a reminder.

As the peach blossom company expanded, Xia ruofei had shown more and more amazing things. Elder song also hoped that Xia ruofei would never forget his original heart and never lose himself. He wanted to always be like a real gentleman, carrying the world with his moral character.

This was elder song’s good intention.

Elder song didn’t know that for Xia ruofei, whose cultivation was getting higher and higher, these words were a good reminder.

A cultivator’s power was so great that they could move mountains and fill the sea. As their cultivation continued to improve, many people would often lose their original heart and forget that they were once a powerless mortal. They would even put themselves in a higher species and regard mortals as ants.

“The Bureau chief spent a long time in the study last night writing,” manager Lu said.”This should be the piece he’s most satisfied with.”

Xia ruofei was touched. It seemed that elder song knew that he would be visiting today and had prepared this gift in advance yesterday.

Elder song’s calligraphy had a high artistic value. More importantly, his personally written works were often given a deeper meaning. This was also the reason why elder song did not write for others easily. However, he never hesitated when giving Xia ruofei his calligraphy pieces. Including this time, elder song had already given Xia ruofei two pieces of calligraphy.

Xia ruofei carefully rolled up the piece of calligraphy and said to manager Lu,””Manager Lu, please tell Grandpa song that I will remember his words!”

“I’ll definitely bring it!”Manager Lu smiled and nodded.

Xia ruofei nodded and sat in the car. He waved goodbye to manager Lu and Fang Zhongming.

The car started slowly and left the song family’s old house.

It was almost nineo’ clock in the evening when he returned to the courtyard house. Xia ruofei washed up, sat on the bed, and cultivated for a while before lying down to rest.

The next day, Xia ruofei did not plan to leave the house. He had to prepare the medicinal herbs for elder Liu’s treatment.

Facing such a serious illness, Xia ruofei definitely could not rely solely on traditional Chinese medicine. He still had to use the petals of the spirit Heart Flower. However, even if they had a certain effect, they could not cure him immediately. It was not easy to grasp the extent.

After he finished his breakfast, he returned to the master’s courtyard in the middle, ready to close the door and enter the spirit map space.

Just as Xia ruofei was about to take out the painting, he heard footsteps. From the sound, Xia ruofei knew that it was Qin Yanan.

Sure enough, Xia ruofei heard a soft knock on the door. Qin Yanan said,””President Xia, I have something to report to you.”

Xia ruofei had already locked the door, so he had to open it again. He smiled and asked,””Yanan! Did something happen in the company?”

Qin Yanan’s expression was a little strange as she said,””President Xia, the company called me. There’s something very strange. Everyone is indecisive and asked me to report to you as soon as possible.”

“What’s so troublesome?” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”tell me!”

“Yesterday evening, the company’s legal department received a fax from miles Pharmaceutical Group from Jiangsu and Zhejiang Province. The other party said ...” Qin Yanan hesitated for a moment, then continued,”the other party said that they want to transfer all the shares of the group to you, and they want us to send someone to get in touch with it as soon as possible ...”

Qin Yanan quickly explained,””President Xia, this matter sounds very ridiculous. The colleagues in the legal department thought it was a prank and ignored it at first, but soon the other party called again. They were very serious and seemed to be very anxious. “After hanging up the phone, my colleagues from Legal Affairs immediately reported to the company leaders at home. This morning, President Feng got the contact information of the chairman of miles Pharmaceutical Group through his personal connections and called to ask. Chairman Liu personally admitted that there was indeed something going on and said that as long as he reported it to you, the matter would be clear, so ... President Feng asked me to report this to you immediately ...”

Xia ruofei thought to himself,”the Liu family is quite fast!” It seemed that the old man was not as calm as he looked on the surface. He was still very afraid of death ...

“President Xia, this matter ...” Qin Yanan carefully asked.

“There is indeed such a thing.” Xia ruofei smiled.”However, I did pay some other price. It’s equivalent to an exchange! Our paradise pharmaceutical factory happens to be in the stage of rapid expansion. If we take over miles Corporation, we’ll save a lot of time!”

“So this is true!” Qin Yanan was shocked.

The market value of miles Pharmaceutical Group was higher than that of paradise Corporation. Now, all the shares were going to be transferred to Xia ruofei? He didn’t know what price Xia ruofei had paid for the equivalent exchange, but one thing was for sure. Once miles Corporation was merged into the paradise Corporation, the company’s assets would at least double.

If he counted the additional value brought by the rapid development of Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory, it would be even greater.

“Of course it’s true!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”who would make such a joke for no reason?”

Then, Xia ruofei said seriously,”Yanan, contact your family and ask CEO Feng to immediately gather the elite forces to form a team. The team must include legal, financial, and pharmaceutical factory professionals. Let CEO Feng or CEO Dong lead the team. Come to the capital and meet me immediately!” I’ll ask miles to send a team to Beijing to sign the transfer agreement. After that, I’ll go to Jiangsu and Zhejiang Province to take over the manufacturing factory. ”

“Alright!” Qin Yanan said excitedly. At the same time, she quickly jotted down notes in the small notebook she carried with her.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”by the way, tell boss Feng not to affect the company’s normal operations because of this. There’s no need for too many people in the acceptance team.” If you don’t have enough manpower, I have reliable candidates on my side who can be filled in by then. ”

“Understood!” Qin Yanan asked as she jotted down notes,”President Xia, do you have any other orders?”

“Not at the moment, but I have one request, as soon as possible! It’s best if you fly over today!” Xia ruofei said,”by the way, since you’re in Beijing now, you and he Yu will be responsible for some front – back coordination and security work. For example, the accommodation and accommodation of our company’s team after they come over. Once the number of people is confirmed, you will have to book a hotel in advance. Of course, I’m just giving you an example. You and he Yu will have to work harder for the specific matters. This matter is more urgent. ”

“Don’t worry, President Xia!” Qin Yanan quickly said,”I’ll coordinate it.”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”then go!” If there’s anything you can’t make a decision on, report to me at any time!” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Alright!” Qin Yanan replied.

When she walked to the front yard, she felt that her steps were light, because this matter was really like a dream and too unreal.

Qin Yanan contacted San Shan, and Feng Jing was extremely excited when she heard the news. Paradise Corporation also quickly took action. After discussing with a few senior executives at home, they quickly gathered the elite forces to form a ten – person team led by Dong Yun. They booked a flight to Beijing at around noon.

Xia ruofei had also contacted the Liu family, saying that he wanted to come to the capital city to sign the share transfer agreement. Since old master Liu had already spoken, Liu Chongli would naturally fully cooperate, so he agreed without hesitation.

Miles Corporation also sent people to Beijing. The two parties agreed to meet at the Shangri – La hotel the next morning to sign the agreement.
