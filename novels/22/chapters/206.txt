Chapter 207: The future space wine

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”alright, I’ll pay the deposit first!” Immediately organize the production, the sooner the better. ” “Alright, alright!” Manager Qi hurriedly said,”I’ll make the arrangements now. I guarantee that the 5000 catties of Drunken Eight Immortals will be ready within two days!” Manager Qi took Xia ruofei to the finance department and paid a deposit of 10000 Yuan with his card. 25 jars of 5000 catties of wine would cost a total of 112500 Yuan. To manager Qi, this was definitely a big deal. Although Ding Feng winery had been a well – established brand for decades, it had never been able to get involved in the high – end wine industry. It was basically taking the path of small profits but high volume sales, and its sales had been declining over the years. This was because many young people were no longer interested in drunk eight immortal. Only a few old customers still maintained the habit of Drinking Drunk eight immortal. Relying on the feelings of the old customers, the winery could only maintain its operations for a few days. Therefore, getting an order of more than 100000 Yuan in one go was a great bonus for manager Qi’s performance, and he could also earn a lot of Commission. Manager Qi was very polite to Xia ruofei. He personally handed the receipt for the deposit to Xia ruofei and then personally saw him out. Before Xia ruofei got into the car, he said,”manager Qi, let me know when the wine is ready. I’ll give you an address when the time comes. Please help me deliver it directly.” “No problem! Mr. Xia, don’t worry!” After leaving the Dingfeng winery, Xia ruofei was not in a hurry to return to the farm. He found a place to stop by the side of the road, took out his mobile phone to connect to the internet, and searched for rental information on the same city’s website. This time, he had ordered a total of 25 large jars of white wine. If he sent all of them to Taoyuan farm, it would be too obvious a target. These white wine would all be sent into the spirit map space. At that time, Xia ruofei would definitely not be able to explain why the white wine had disappeared. The workers were fine. After all, they had gone home after work. But there were people living in the villa! Especially since ye Lingyun, a former Special Forces member, was in charge of the entire farm’s surveillance system, so if he wanted to put the white wine into the space, he definitely couldn’t send it to the farm. And Xia ruofei couldn’t always order people to unload the goods on the way. The best way was to rent a small warehouse. This was because there would definitely be similar situations in the future. Having such a place would be much more convenient. Now that the internet was very advanced, Xia ruofei quickly found a suitable small warehouse. The warehouse was located in the northern suburbs of Jinning District. It was only about 150 square meters in area and the monthly rent was 2200 Yuan. Although the location of the warehouse was a little remote, it was relatively convenient to get there. Even heavy trucks could drive all the way to the entrance of the warehouse. Furthermore, the warehouse was located right next to the swirling highway. It would only take five minutes to enter the swirling highway by car. Xia ruofei would be able to return to Taoyuan farm in Changping from the warehouse even faster than returning from downtown. Xia ruofei called the landlord according to the information provided on the internet in the same city. After hearing that the warehouse had not been rented out, he immediately expressed his desire to go to the site to take a look. Then, he drove directly from the Lingshui District in the western suburbs to the Jinning District in the northern suburbs. After Xia ruofei had inspected the warehouse, he felt that it was similar to the information on the internet. Furthermore, it was very suitable in all aspects and decided to rent it on the spot. The landlord was overjoyed. Soon, both parties signed the lease contract. Xia ruofei paid the full year’s rent in one go. After settling the warehouse, Xia ruofei drove back to Taoyuan farm. In the next two days, Xia ruofei lived a carefree life. He did not need to worry about the transfer of ownership at all. From Guan Ping’s feedback, the transfer process would take about a week, and this was under the condition that the loan was paid in full. If he wanted to apply for a mortgage, it might even be delayed by a month. Of course, Xia ruofei only needed to sign the last few papers and pay. Some procedures required both the buyer and the seller to be present at the same time, so he probably needed to make two trips to the real estate Center. For the time being, the farm was only occupied with the vegetable greenhouse. Cao tieshu managed it well, and Xia ruofei only needed to go over occasionally. His most important task was to go to the water tower on the mountain every once in a while to add some petal solution. The vegetables in the greenhouse were growing very well, and the farm employees were amazed. They said that it was indeed a new vegetable product, and the growth rate was far faster than ordinary vegetables. It seemed that it would take less than a month for the first batch of vegetables to be harvested. …… The ninth day of the first month of the lunar year. Hu Zi’s mother and Lin Qiao were ready to return to the city. Lin Qiao was about to start school, and the two had to return to the forestry Bureau dormitory in the city early. Lin Qiao needed to finish the rest of her winter vacation homework, and Hu Zi’s mother also needed to clean up the house. No one lived there for so many days, so they had to clean it thoroughly. Hence, Xia ruofei drove them back to the city. When they arrived at the forestry Bureau dormitory, Xia ruofei stayed behind to help Hu Zi’s mother clean up and even had lunch with them. While they were eating, Xia ruofei received a call from manager Qi of the Dingfeng winery, saying that the 25 jars of Eight Immortals drunk were ready. Xia ruofei immediately sent the address of the warehouse to manager Qi, then gobbled up the rice in his bowl and hurriedly left Hu Zi’s mother’s house. Xia ruofei drove to the warehouse in Jinning District. After waiting for a while, two large trucks arrived at the entrance of the warehouse one after the other. Manager Qi personally escorted the carriage and directed the workers to carefully move the heavy wine jars into the warehouse and place them neatly along the wall. “Mr. Xia, can you check these bars?” manager Qi asked. Xia ruofei nodded and casually opened a jar. He first smelled the fragrance, then took a spoonful of the wine from manager Qi. He brought it to his mouth and tasted it. Then, he closed his eyes slightly and savored the taste before nodding in satisfaction. Before this, Xia ruofei had even bought a bottle of ordinary Drunken Eight Immortals from the supermarket to try it so that he could remember the taste of the wine. Then, Xia ruofei randomly opened three jars and took a sip of each. They tasted the same as the bottled wine he had bought from the supermarket. “No problem,” he said. Xia ruofei smiled and said,”manager Qi, I’ll transfer the rest of the money to you!” I can pay by card, right?” “Sure, sure!” Manager Qi said happily,”I brought a mobile credit card machine!” Xia ruofei paid the remaining 110000 Yuan by credit card. At the entrance of the warehouse, manager Qi shook hands with Xia ruofei and said,””Mr. Xia, thank you for taking care of our business. Call me directly if you need anything next time!” “Alright!” Xia ruofei said,”you’ve all worked hard today. Take care!” “Mr. Xia, please wait!” Manager Qi said goodbye to Xia ruofei politely and left with the workers. Xia ruofei returned to the warehouse and locked the door from the inside. Then, he closed the blinds at the air vents and summoned the spirit map scroll from his palm. As the gap between the two teams was slowly closing, steel Spear’s heart was burning with anxiety. Was a month’s effort really going to be in vain in the last one or two days? Stay up late to update for monthly votes! Thank you, thank you!
