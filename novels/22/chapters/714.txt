Chapter 715: Return with a full load (1)

Xia ruofei also heard the discussion behind him and could not help but smile.

1000 points? It sounded quite difficult. The last level was 30 seconds, and one had to score more than 209 points.

However, Xia ruofei had already promised Lin Qiao that he would win her an Apple gift bag. How could he go back on his word?

The onlookers were amazed by Xia ruofei’s abnormal hit rate. In fact, Xia ruofei knew very well that with the help of spiritual power, the basketballs were like precise – guided missiles, and it was difficult to miss them.

As for the physical problems caused by continuously shooting from both sides at high speed, it was non – existent for Xia ruofei. After undergoing the transformation of the body tempering soup and the petal solution of the spirit Heart Flower, Xia ruofei’s current body could not be judged by common sense. Even if he continued to shoot from both sides at high speed for an hour, he would not feel tired.

The fourth level’s countdown was still 5 seconds.

That little bit of time passed by quickly. The board was raised, and the basketballs scrambled to roll down.

Xia ruofei did not wait for the ball to roll to the end. He reached out his arm to grab a basketball and threw it without looking at it.

When the basketball flew above the basket, the countdown had just ended. It was the 30 – second countdown for the fourth round.

With a whoosh, the basketball entered the hoop right before the countdown, not even wasting half a second.

793 points!

Xia ruofei’s crazy performance was on stage again.

The basketballs formed a line one after another, and all of them entered the net without exception. The score was rising rapidly.

......

Ten seconds later, it was the last 20 seconds of the challenge, and the score became three points again.

The score rose even faster.

882、885、888……

No one could see the score clearly because it would be refreshed very quickly.

In the last 10 seconds, the score displayed on the shooting machine finally broke through the 900 mark.

This was already a record that was beyond imagination.

Everyone couldn’t help but start the countdown.

9 seconds, 918 minutes.

8 seconds, 927 minutes.

Seven seconds ...

Everyone’s heart was in their mouth, and the store’s staff were also slightly relieved. It seemed that it would be a little difficult to break through 1000 points.

However, in the last few seconds, Xia ruofei’s hand speed increased again and the speed of his score rising increased sharply.

2 seconds, 972 points.

1 second, 996 points.

Just as the countdown was about to reach 0 seconds, Xia ruofei grabbed a basketball with both hands and threw it out almost at the same time with a slight time difference.

Shua! Shua!

Two hollow sounds were heard.

At this moment, the time had jumped to zero.

And the score displayed on it was 1002 points!

The crowd of onlookers immediately burst into an uproar, and then everyone couldn’t help but clap.

Lin Qiao was so happy that she almost jumped up. She ended the recording after a close – up of the score and then screamed as she pounced on Xia ruofei.

“Brother ruofei! You’re amazing!” Lin Qiao hugged Xia ruofei and laughed,” 1002 points! It’s a Super Record!”

When the crowd saw a beautiful girl hugging Xia ruofei, they started to cheer and some even whistled.

Lin Qiao blushed and quickly let go of Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei was sweating after he rolled four levels. Lin Qiao quickly took out a tissue and handed it to Xia ruofei.

“Thank you!” Xia ruofei took the tissue and wiped his sweat. Then, he looked at the store assistant.

“Excuse me ... My challenge of 1000 points should be considered a success, right?” Xia ruofei asked with a faint smile.

The shop assistant was dumbfounded at the unbelievable score. When he heard Xia ruofei’s words, he came back to his senses and subconsciously looked at the store manager.

The store manager thought for a moment and immediately said with a smile,””Of course! Sir, congratulations on your success in the highest difficulty. You will receive a big gift bag of Apple products from us!”

The surrounding crowd let out waves of envious exclamations.

They had also seen the rules on the sign. They knew that if they scored more than 1000 points, they would be able to get almost all of the top – Class electronic products in the Apple Series, which were worth nearly 40000 Yuan. This was really enviable.

The manager was a little worried at first, but when Xia ruofei really scored more than 1000 points, he thought it through.

This promotion was originally an event approved by the headquarters, and the prizes were also estimated. He or the store did not need to bear the cost. Since someone had gotten more than 1000 points with their own ability, they would just give out the prizes normally.

Moreover, this in itself was a very big gimmick. It was simply a shot in the arm for this promotion, and it would definitely stimulate the customer’s desire to spend.

Xia ruofei smiled and said to Lin Qiao,””Qiao’ er, I didn’t fail you! Now, all the electronic products you need for college are here. You don’t have to buy them anymore!”

Lin Qiao smiled and gave Xia ruofei a thumbs up.

The store manager invited Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao to return to the store.

The store manager personally led Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao to the rest area at the corner of the store and asked them to sit down. He also ordered the staff to bring tea and snacks. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Please wait for a moment, we need some time to prepare the prizes ...” He said.

The manager smiled bitterly and said,””Actually, we didn’t expect anyone to break through the 1000 – point mark, so we didn’t prepare the big gift package. But don’t worry, our staff has already gone to the warehouse behind to transfer the goods according to the promised prize on the poster. It will be ready very soon.”
