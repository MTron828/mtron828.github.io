2561 President Xia_stop using your magical power

PP sports’s commentator, Shen fangjian, couldn’t help but say,””These three goals, no matter which one of them is singled out, could be the best goal of the season. And with three such wonderful goals in the same game, it’s simply a visual feast!”

“Let’s not forget Wu Lei’s goal. It was his goal that blew the horn of the Spanish team’s counterattack!” Jia Tianning said,”and I noticed that in this game, Wu Lei has made great progress in terms of self – confidence, physical confrontation, ball protection, and even the grasp of opportunities in front of the goal. We are very happy to see that Wu Lei is adapting to the pace of La Liga at a very fast speed! I believe that this goal is just the beginning. We have reason to be full of expectations for his next performance!”

Jia Tianning was indeed worthy of the title of the Vice master of Wu Chui Hall. Even when all the attention was focused on Xia ruofei, he still didn’t forget Wu Lei and was still praising him.

Espanyol did not celebrate for a long time. After all, this was Valencia’s home ground. They had already conceded a goal, and if they continued to celebrate on their field, it would be like rubbing salt on their wounds. So, after they thanked the visiting fans, they quickly returned to the locker room.

That night, Espanyol took a flight back to Barcelona.

When the competition ended, it was not even five in the morning in China. At this time, most people were still in their dreams, but the internet platform was unprecedentedly lively.

Some fans went to bed early, set an alarm at threeo’ clock, and specifically got up to watch the game. Some people just wanted to watch Wu Lei at the beginning. If Wu Lei did not play for a long time or was replaced after he played, these fans would definitely not watch the entire game.

No one had expected this match to be so exciting. The process was full of twists and turns, and the result was even more exciting.

It was already big news that Xia ruofei had suddenly become a player of Espanyol. His performance in this game had made many people who had doubted him at the beginning even more embarrassed.

The Chinese players took all four goals from the Spanish team. Xia ruofei scored a hat – trick, and almost all the threatening shots were related to Xia ruofei and Wu Lei. Also, don’t forget that Wu Lei’s goal was an assist from Xia ruofei. On the other hand, Xia ruofei’s long – ranged shot came from Wu Lei’s pass. The free kick that Xia ruofei scored was also created by Wu Lei.

The only thing that Xia ruofei did was to feed him a biscuit, but he spat it out. This also resulted in Xia ruofei’s half – turn and mid – Air shot, which was a replica of the fairy from beyond the heavens, allowing him to perform a hat – trick.

After watching the game, how could the Chinese fans go back to sleep?

Their minds were in a state of excitement, and the sky was about to brighten, so almost no one went to sleep. These people were naturally browsing Weibo, forums, Tieba, and so on.

#Xia ruofei’s hat – trick in La Liga #This topic was No. 1 on Weibo’s hot search list without any suspense.

The team of a certain popular young hunk had just started to hype up a piece of news and spent a lot of money to buy the hot search. In the end, when he woke up in the morning, he almost cried and fainted in the toilet.

If it was said that the main people who were browsing Weibo and forums in the early hours of the morning were the fans who stayed up late to watch the game, then after dawn, this group was not limited to fans, or rather, it was not limited to hardcore fans.

Some people also liked football, but they would not stay up at two or threeo’ clock in the morning to watch it. Generally speaking, if there was a game they were concerned about, they would read the news after waking up to see the results or find a game compilation to watch.

After watching the highlights of the match between Espanyol and Valencia, the fans could not help but beat their chests and stamp their feet in regret.

If he had known that there would be such an exciting show, even if he went to the office to doze off during the day, he would have stayed up all night to watch it!

There were also some people who did not usually watch football, but when they saw the top trending search on Weibo, they could not help but click on it to take a look. Anyone who saw the video or gif of Xia ruofei’s three goals could not help but be amazed.

When Xia ruofei saw the most searched topic, he was already on the bus to the airport.

Xia ruofei was naturally in a good mood after his hat – trick and the team’s victory.

He casually took a close – up shot of the ball used in the game. The ball had the signatures of the Spanish team, as well as Xia ruofei’s own notes on the game time and goal time. He planned to keep it at home as a memento.

Xia ruofei posted the picture of the ball on Weibo. The content was one word: Cool! Then, he naughtily brought up the topic #Xia ruofei’s hat – trick in La Liga #.

Xia ruofei’s Weibo post increased the popularity of the top trending topic by a lot. Now, the number one spot was even more stable. The young man who had paid a lot of money to buy the top trending topic was firmly pressed at the second place. If he wanted to get the number one spot, he would have to wait until Xia ruofei’s popularity faded.

With Xia ruofei’s current momentum on the internet, it would be hard to get rid of him on the hot search list no matter how much money he spent.

As soon as Xia ruofei’s Weibo post was posted, a large number of fans and netizens flooded in. Everyone left comments, reposted, and liked excitedly.

As time went by, the major online platforms also welcomed the peak of users. At this time, many people were on the subway or bus to work. During this time, the majority of people used Weibo and forums.

Xia ruofei’s Weibo post and the video of Xia ruofei’s goal were reposted by a large number of netizens.

Everyone soon realized that the Weibo platform seemed to have become a little sluggish. They could not even download all the pictures they opened, and the videos they watched were also lagging. It was as if they had returned to the 2G era.

This kind of stagnation lasted for about half an hour before it began to slowly recover.

People didn’t notice it at first because there were many reasons for the network to be jammed, especially in the underground high – speed subway. The network itself wasn’t very good, so it was common for the network to be jammed, so many people thought that it was their mobile phone’s network card.

However, the official Weibo released a message very quickly: As there were too many visitors at the same time, there was a certain lag. Our technical team has already adjusted the bandwidth at the first moment, and the current access has been restored. We are deeply sorry for the inconvenience and bad experience we have brought to you.

There was nothing special about this message. After all, the other party did not say the reason. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

However, another Weibo post was quickly reposted by everyone.

The user ID of this Weibo post was “the lion that can attack the city.” The verification information showed that he was an engineer of the official technical team of Weibo. This ID was also quite famous and would answer technical questions from time to time on Weibo, so his identity was basically confirmed. It was said that this “the lion that can attack the city” was also the head of a certain group in the technical team.

“The lion that can attack the city” ‘s Weibo post made everyone finally know the “culprit” who had been stuck for more than half an hour.

He wrote on Weibo,”the server is stable, it’s all CEO Xia’s fault!” President Xia, can you inform us in advance the next time you want to do something? The nurse is here to put me on a drip!

“The lion that can attack the city” tagged Xia ruofei in this Weibo post and attached two pictures. One was of him wearing a patient’s garb while sitting on a hospital bed and working overtime on his laptop. The other was Weibo’s top search list. The top topic was about Xia ruofei’s hat – trick and it was circled in red.

The truth was finally revealed to the world!

It turned out that the Weibo server was stuck because of Xia ruofei’s hot topic.

The netizens who knew the truth laughed and shouted at Xia ruofei,”President Xia, quickly withdraw your divine power!
