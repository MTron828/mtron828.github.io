Chapter 580: Three delicacies of Yangtze River (2)

The kun fish was tender and delicious. It had a high fat content under the scales and was rich in saturated fatty acid. It had the effect of reducing cholesterol and was good for preventing vascular hardening, high blood pressure, and coronary heart disease.

Of course, the “King of fish” also recognized the deliciousness of the Chinese perch, so there was a saying,”braised Chinese perch is fresh on both sides, while steamed Chinese perch is attractive to the gods.”

Not only was pomfrets one of the three delicacies of the Yangtze River, but they were also known as the “four famous fish” in Chinese history along with Yellow River carp, noodlefish from Lake Tai, and Song River bass. They had become a delicacy as early as the Han Dynasty.

Since the Wanli period of the Ming Dynasty, the Chinese perch had become a tribute. By the time of the Kang Xi period of the Qing Dynasty, it had been listed as an important dish in the Manchu Han Imperial Feast.

Su Dongpo had once written a poem to praise the Chinese perch: With the spring air of peach flowers, this kind of flavor was better than bass.

After browsing through the information on the internet, Xia ruofei finally had a direct understanding of the preciousness of the Chinese perch that Ling Xiaotian had mentioned.

He searched for the price of Chinese perch and was shocked to find that the price of a man – made United States perch was around 300 to 500 yuan per catty. The pure wild Chinese perch had almost gone extinct in recent years, so he could not find a price for reference.

However, Xia ruofei knew that if it was a pure wild Chinese perch, the price would definitely be staggering.

At this point, Xia ruofei suddenly had an idea.

The farm’s big fish pond had been idle for a long time.

This was because Xia ruofei could not decide what kind of fish he wanted to raise. There was no point in raising ordinary fish for food. Whether it was the economic benefits or the reputation it would bring, it would not meet his expectations.

Xia ruofei would occasionally check the information of some precious fish. Some of the approval procedures were more troublesome. For example, salamander needed to be specially reported to the Ministry of fishery for multiple layers of approval before it could be cultivated. As one of the three delicacies of Yangtze River, Blowfish, because it carried a Strong Poison, it had to be cultivated without poison, which had an extremely high approval threshold.

Most of the more expensive fish were saltwater fish, and there had never been a suitable species of freshwater fish.

......

This time, when Ling Xiaotian mentioned the pomfrets, Xia ruofei’s heart was moved.

Without much hesitation, he immediately took out his phone and called Ling Xiaotian.

After Ling Xiaotian picked up, he asked curiously,””RUO Fei, what’s wrong? What’s the matter?”

“Uncle Ling, I suddenly want to know, how much did you spend to buy those two wild Chinese perch?” Xia ruofei asked.

Ling Xiaotian could not help but laugh,”just this?” I thought something had happened! RUO Fei, let me put it this way! Now, pure wild pomfrets are almost impossible to find, so there’s no clear standard for the price. I bought these two pomfrets at 3000 Yuan per 500 grams, so the total is about 15000 Yuan!”

Ling Xiaotian’s tone was unconcerned. 10000 Yuan for two fish was an unbelievable amount to an ordinary family, but as the head of Ling Ji restaurant, a billionaire, this amount of money was really nothing.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but take a deep breath and said,””So expensive!”

Ling Xiaotian chuckled,”ruofei, if you can buy two pure – wild Chinese perch for 15000 RMB, you can go ahead and laugh!” And this pair of pomfrets has been personally checked by my Executive Head Chef. They are definitely pure wild, and they were caught in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. They can’t be more authentic. ”

Xia ruofei’s eyes brightened. He took a deep breath and asked,””Uncle Ling, are these two pomfrets a female and a male? Are they still alive?”

Ling Xiaotian was a little curious as to why Xia ruofei was so insistent on getting to the bottom of things, but he still smiled and said,””You child ... If I didn’t go to see it in person today, I would have been stumped by your question! Ruofei, those two pomfrets are really a male and a female. They just happen to be a pair!”

At this point, Ling Xiaotian paused for a moment, then said with a trace of excitement,””And the two fish are alive! Do you know? This was a miracle! The Chinese perch was the most delicate. It was said that once a fisherman touched a fish’s scales, they would immediately stop moving. They were very timid and could easily be frightened to death by the slightest movement. But this pair of rays were alive! I couldn’t believe it when I saw them!”

Xia ruofei’s voice had changed. He asked,””Uncle Ling, then ... They haven’t been killed yet, right?”

“No, I didn ‘t! I told them to take care of it carefully and not to disturb them!” Ling Xiaotian smiled and said,”let’s eat and kill tomorrow! That’s the freshest, haha ...”

Xia ruofei heard Ling Xiaotian’s excitement and said embarrassedly,””That ... Uncle Ling, I ... Can I have a small request?”

“Why are you being so polite, child? Say what you have to say! Are you lacking money again?” Ling Xiaotian asked.

“No, no!” Xia ruofei quickly said,”uncle Ling, that pair of Chinese perch ... Can you give it to me?”

“Give it to you? RUO Fei, what do you mean?” Ling Xiaotian asked curiously.

“Just ... Just don’t eat them. I ... I have other uses for them.” Xia ruofei said, a little embarrassed.

However, Xia ruofei was no longer embarrassed after hearing the most difficult request.

He quickly continued with the reason he had thought of,”Uncle Ling, it’s actually like this. Didn’t you just tell me about the Chinese perch? “I went online to show it off to my friend, and my friend ... Oh, right, he was the one who helped cultivate paradise vegetables. He’s very good at planting and breeding techniques. My friend has been studying artificial breeding of Chinese perch recently. He heard that there was a pair of pure wild Chinese perch, so he wanted to study them. He said that they were living specimens and would greatly promote his research, so he asked me to help him with this ...”

“Is that so ...” Ling Xiaotian was slightly hesitant.

Xia ruofei quickly added,”uncle Ling, this friend of mine is only obsessed with technology. He has no interest in doing business. He has already agreed to continue working with our paradise Corporation after the development of the pomfrets cultivation technique. In the future, we will engage in high – Quality imitated wild pomfrets cultivation.”

Xia ruofei had already put it this way. Moreover, Ling Xiaotian was also a beneficiary of the peach Garden vegetables. He had heard that the person who wanted the pomfrets was the one who was cultivating the peach Garden vegetables with Xia ruofei. Although he was a little reluctant, he still agreed.

“Since that’s the case, I’ll give it to you!” Ling Xiaotian said straightforwardly.

Xia ruofei was a little embarrassed as he asked,””Uncle Ling, you didn’t invite any other guests tomorrow, right? Otherwise, it wouldn’t be good if I stood her up. ”

“It’s fine, I only called you!” Ling Xiaotian said,”ruofei, since you have use for it, take it! What’s wrong with me missing a fish meal?”

Xia ruofei said happily,”uncle Ling, I thank you on behalf of my friend!” When we’ve cultivated a simulated Chang Jiang Pomfret, you’ll be the first one to try it!” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Alright! I’ll be waiting for that day!” Ling Xiaotian laughed as he spoke.

To be honest, Ling Xiaotian had not tasted the Chang Jiang Chinese perch for 20 to 30 years. When he was young, Chinese perch was not that expensive, so he had naturally tried it before. The taste was still lingering in his mind, so he was full of anticipation this time. The fish had been taken away by Xia ruofei, so he would be lying if he said that he was not disappointed. However, since it was for the career of his future son – in – Law, his desire for food was nothing.

Xia ruofei was also worried that an accident would happen tonight and cause the deaths of the pomfrets, so he simply told Ling Xiaotian,””Uncle Ling, I want to come over and get the pomfrets now, can I?”

“No problem!” Ling Xiaotian laughed. These two Chinese perch are in my kitchen. Come over now!”

“Alright! Then I’ll see you later!” Xia ruofei quickly said.

He jumped up from the bed, put on his coat haphazardly, and jogged downstairs. He drove the Knight XV straight to Ling Xiaotian’s Villa.
