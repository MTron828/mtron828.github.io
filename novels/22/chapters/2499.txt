2500 Arrival at Barcelona (1)

Zhou leiyun also knew that Xia ruofei did not like Zhou Yuan very much. He had brought him to pick him up today to express his attitude. Thus, after greeting him, Zhou leiyun warmly welcomed everyone to board the car.

When the employees saw that Zhou leiyun, one of the richest men in the country, had personally come to pick them up, they could not help but feel flattered. Even Dong Yun could not help but take a few more glances at Xia ruofei.

Dong Yun knew that Xia ruofei’s trip to Spain was an invitation from Zhou leiyun. However, she did not expect Xia ruofei to be so close to Zhou leiyun. In the entire China, there were not many people who could make Zhou leiyun come to the airport to pick them up.

Xia ruofei introduced Dong Yun to Zhou leiyun as they walked side by side towards the car.

When Zhou leiyun heard that Dong Yun was the Managing Director of paradise Corporation, he was very friendly. He did not act arrogantly just because paradise Corporation was much smaller than glory world Corporation. Since she was going overseas with Xia ruofei, she must be a trusted subordinate. How could Zhou leiyun neglect her?

Xia ruofei, Dong Yun, and Zhou leiyun sat in the car in front. Shi wen sat in the back of the car while the other five sat in another Mercedes – Benz.

After the two cars left the parking ground, they went around to the other side. Zhou leiyun personally led Xia ruofei and the rest to complete the immigration procedures. Then, everyone got into the car again and left the airport, heading in the direction of the hotel.

Barcelona, a Southern European resort, had warm sunshine, beautiful beaches, and enthusiastic bikini girls all year round. Along the way, it was full of exotic scenery.

Xia ruofei asked,”by the way, director Zhou, there are two other employees from our company who took the Huaxia airlines ‘flight. They should have arrived earlier than us. Have you picked them up?”

“Don’t worry! Your two employees have already arrived at the hotel!” Zhou leiyun chuckled and said,”I arranged for Jiang Xiaochen to personally pick us up.”

...

Jiang Xiaochen was Zhou leiyun’s Chinese agent in the Spanish club and had been working there for several years.

“Thanks!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Zhou Yuan sat upright in the front passenger seat, not even daring to breathe loudly. Zhou leiyun and Xia ruofei sat in the middle row, while Dong Yun and shi wen sat in the back row.

The Mercedes – Benz business car had a longer wheel – Length, and there were three seats in the back, so it was not crowded with two petite girls sitting in the back.

Zhou leiyun was in high spirits and introduced the scenery to Xia ruofei along the way.

The city of Barcelona had a long history, and there were many historical sites in the city. The old buildings in Europe were well – preserved, and medieval – looking buildings could be seen standing on both sides of the road.

After Zhou leiyun had acquired the Espanyol club, he had frequently traveled between China and Spain. He was already quite familiar with the city of Barcelona and had no problem being Xia ruofei’s tour guide.

The car drove through the streets of Barcelona and finally arrived at the Grand Central Hotel in the Laocheng District.

The hotel was located in a building from the early 20th century. The furnishings were elegant, and the exterior was filled with a sense of historical heaviness. However, the interior was very luxurious.

Zhou leiyun asked Zhou Yuan to bring Dong Yun and the rest to handle the check – in procedures. Xia ruofei’s passport was also handed over to Zhou Yuan to handle while he and Xia ruofei sat on the sofa in the lobby and waited.

Zhou leiyun smiled.”Director Xia, this hotel doesn’t have a Presidential Suite. I’ve asked them to book a luxurious suite for you. I’ll have to trouble you for a while.”

...

Zhou leiyun owned a mansion in the wealthy district of Barcelona. He had originally wanted to invite Xia ruofei to stay at his house, but Xia ruofei had used the excuse of bringing his employees along as an excuse to reject him.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”a luxury suite?” I say, even a standard room would do! I’m not that spoiled. When I was in the Army, I lived in a row of rooms that could accommodate more than ten people. Didn’t I eat and sleep well?”

Zhou leiyun sighed and said,”that’s right!” Sometimes, it was not necessarily a good thing to have superior living conditions! President Xia’s experience in the military will be very beneficial to your future career development!”

Xia ruofei knew that Zhou leiyun was thinking about his good – for – nothing nephew, Zhou Yuan, so he smiled and said,””Everyone wants to live a more refined life. I have no choice. I was born with a silver spoon.”

Zhou leiyun laughed and said,”chief Xia, the conditions of this hotel are quite good!” The local food here was very authentic, and the fitness center was also great! I’m sure President Xia will like it there. By the way, there’s also an endless pool on the roof. In our country’s words, it’s an internet – famous attraction! Some of our wealthy compatriots who come to Barcelona for a vacation like to choose this hotel because of the endless pool on the roof!”

“Is that so?” Xia ruofei said,”I’ll find time to experience it!”

“I must go and experience it!” Zhou leiyun smiled and said,”there are many pretty girls in bikinis there too!” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Zhou leiyun continued,”that’s right. Wu Lei has also been arranged to stay in this hotel for the time being. However, once he has settled down, he should be going to rent or buy a house. After all, he will be staying here for a few seasons!”

“Wu Lei should be at the training base now, right?” Xia ruofei nodded.
