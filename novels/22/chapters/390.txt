Chapter 391: Chapter 358 – quietly spreading_2

Spicy grass Fish Pot, stir – fried cabbage, tomato egg soup, and a piece of Moo Shu Pork. Although there weren’t many dishes, the amount was enough for four people to eat.

The big grass carp weighed more than 10 catties and filled up a big pot. Xia ruofei had used salt, white wine, and ginger water to coat the grass carp inside and outside. He also stuffed some seasoning into the fish’s stomach and left it in the origin space for two to three minutes. In fact, it had been marinating for more than an hour and the flavor had already been fully absorbed.

In addition, all the water was used to cook the dish, so the fresh and tender grass carp was fragrant and delicious, and became the most popular dish on the table.

Not only Lu You and the rest, but even Xia ruofei himself had eaten quite a bit. He thought smugly,”It seems that although I haven’t been cooking much recently, my cooking skills haven’t dropped!

Lu You couldn’t care less about her ladylike image. Of course, she didn’t have much of a ladylike image to begin with. She ate in large mouthfuls, especially the plate of cabbage. Almost half of it went into her stomach. Of course, she also ate a lot of the delicious grass carp. In the end, her stomach was a little bloated before she put down her chopsticks.

Lu You, who had eaten and drunk her fill, left the farm with three portions of jaded skin cream in satisfaction. When she left, she even revealed a rare smile and did not mention anything about complaining to Ling Qingxue. Xia ruofei’s heart was completely at ease.

In the next few days, Xia ruofei resumed his carefree life.

He patrolled the farm and construction site every day, and occasionally took a stroll to the water tower on the mountain to add some petal solution. He spent most of his time reading in the villa.

Xia ruofei had bought a lot of Chinese medicine books and encouraged him to play the role of miracle doctor Xia. It was good to have more Chinese medicine knowledge. At least he could scare people and not be exposed.

It seemed that brain development was closely related to mental strength. Ever since Xia ruofei’s mental strength increased after consuming the soup, his efficiency in reading and learning had increased significantly. He could even understand some of the obscure Chinese medical books. Sometimes, he would sit for half a day and read the books with great interest.

Other than reading, Xia ruofei would also practice the movements demonstrated by the little golden man every day. Now that he had mastered the first set of movements, he would still practice for about half an hour every day before starting on the second set.

Just like the first set of movements, Xia ruofei had to suffer a lot for the second set of movements. The pain was unbearable for ordinary people, but Xia ruofei had a tough personality. He gritted his teeth and persevered. Now, he could hold on for about three minutes.

Sanshan University’s gardening club.

Jiang Yue was carefully tending to the pot of jade lion. This pot of jade lion that had won the gold Prize in the exhibition had become the treasure of the landscaper club after returning to Sanshan University after attending the exhibition. Other than Lu You and Jiang Yue, no one was allowed to get close to it. Even the president of the landscaper club, Xia Cheng, was no exception.

At this moment, a round – faced girl walked into the gardening club and greeted Jiang Yue. She then picked up a small flower shovel beside Jiang Yue and was about to start working.

However, her movements slowed down and she took a closer look at Jiang Yue.

Jiang Yue felt a little embarrassed by the girl’s stare. She lifted her head and asked,””Ye Juan, what’s wrong?” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

This time, ye Juan saw it clearly. She looked at Jiang Yue’s face and mumbled,””Yue ‘er, your skin is getting better! Even I can’t help but be moved by her watery appearance ...”

Jiang Yue’s face reddened and she smiled in embarrassment,””It’s not as exaggerated as you said. ”

Her heart was filled with sweetness because she had used the jaded skin ointment that Xia ruofei had given her. That was why her skin was so good.

In her eyes,”brother Xia” seemed to be omnipotent. Needless to say, his skills were amazing. He had bravely defeated several armed criminals. He was so skilled in medicine, and he was also an expert in flowers and vegetables. Now, he had actually created a cosmetic product, and the effect was so immediate.

This made Jiang Yue’s fanbase even deeper ...

“I’m not exaggerating!”Ye Juan said. Yue ‘er, tell me honestly, what cosmetics have you been using recently? I also want to buy one. ”

“I really don ‘t. I never use makeup. You know that ...” Jiang Yue replied.

“That doesn’t make sense ...” Ye Juan couldn’t figure it out. After a while, she suddenly said,”I know! Yue ‘er, you must be in love, right? It must be the nourishment of love that makes you so radiant! I didn’t guess wrong, right?”

“Ye Juan, don’t spout nonsense! I’m not in a relationship!” Jiang Yue blushed.

“You don’t have to hide it ...” Ye Juan winked and said,”Yue ‘er, tell me the truth. Is your boyfriend Mr. Xia?”

Xia ruofei was now very famous in the gardening club. Every student in the gardening club knew him. Ye Juan had also been to the flower exhibition that day, so she naturally knew Xia ruofei. She also knew the feelings Jiang Yue had for Xia ruofei.

Jiang Yue was even more embarrassed when she heard this and said,””No, no, no... Damn ye Juan, who told you to talk nonsense ...”

The two girls were playing around in the gardening club, and their Bell – like laughter could be heard from time to time.

At the three mountains Municipal Party committee’s compound.

Outside the office of the municipal Party Committee Secretary, Secretary Xiao Mei was handling official business in an orderly manner. There was a soft knock on the door, and Xiao Mei raised her head.
