62  Chapter 60: bearing Bramble and asking for forgiveness (1)

    The company's executives had obviously also gotten the answer, and they couldn't help but speak at the same time.

  "Chairman Ling, is the boss of paradise Corporation really Qingxue? Can we make contact with him directly?"

  "Chairman, since Qingxue has already agreed to work with him, even though it has been temporarily stopped due to he Dong's personal reasons, now that the misunderstanding has been cleared up, we can still continue working together!"

  "Yes, Chairman Ling! If we can establish a long - term supply relationship with the Paradise Corporation, our company will definitely be able to take down the Ming Hao restaurant in one fell swoop!"

  "Chairman Ling ..."

  "Alright! Be quiet!" Ling Xiaotian furrowed his brows and said loudly,"why are you all so noisy? Do you think this is a wet market?"

  The moment Ling Xiaotian was enraged, the company's higher - ups and managers immediately fell silent and shut their mouths. For a moment, the meeting room became very quiet.

  Meanwhile, Ling Xiaotian tried his best to adjust his expression and make it gentler. He then looked at Ling Qingxue and squeezed out a smile, saying,"

  "Qingxue, I was deceived by others and blamed you wrongly. Please don't take it to heart ..."

  Ling Qingxue pursed her lips and said after a moment of silence,"

  "Dad, I know what you want to say ... But I've told you before that the production of ruofei's new vegetable product is still very low. He chose to cooperate with us because of me. Now he has signed a supply agreement with the West River Moon Club ..."

  "I know that ... But aren't you his classmate? Can you discuss with him, even if it's just a small portion, it'll be good enough for us to use it in an emergency!"

  Ling Qingxue revealed a meaningful look and said,"

  "But ... Ruofei's vegetables still can't provide the test report from the authorities. At the moment, he doesn't have his own planting base ..."

  Ling Xiaotian laughed bitterly,"

  "Qingxue, don't say such things in a fit of anger. I know you're still angry with father. However, this cooperation is very important to our company. I hope you can look at the big picture and help the company tide over this crisis first ..."

  Ling Qingxue let out a soft sigh and said,"

  "Actually, ruofei already said on the phone that although the supply of vegetables is tight, I can still squeeze out some if I need it. But ... You have to talk to him personally!"

  Ling Xiaotian hurriedly said,"

  "I should! It should be! Qingxue, let's not waste any time, let's go over now!"

  It was unprecedented for the boss of a restaurant chain to rush to see a young man for dozens of catties of vegetables every day.

  This showed that the difficulties that Ling Ji F & B was currently facing weren't small. Furthermore, the appearance of paradise vegetables was so stunning, which was also an important reason why Ling Xiaotian placed so much importance on it.

  Ling Qingxue said calmly,"

  "Father, ruofei has another condition! When we go to negotiate, we must bring this manager he!"

  After she finished speaking, Ling Qingxue glanced at he Dong in disgust.

  He Dong also seemed to have somewhat recovered from the shock, and he asked warily,"

  "What does he want to do? I ... I don't want to see him!"

  Ling Xiaotian frowned. He had always had a good impression of his old comrade's son. He was good - looking and had good work coordination skills. In order to repay his old comrade's kindness, he had been nurturing him on purpose. He even had the intention to matchmake his daughter with him.

  It was just that today's matter had let Ling Xiaotian see another side of he Dong.

  This side of him was so unbearable that Ling Xiaotian could not help but sigh.

  "Xiao He, this matter was caused by you. It's reasonable for them to ask you to go to their house and apologize!" Ling Xiaotian said in a low voice,"this matter is settled. We will leave in ten minutes! Old Hong, go get the car ready!"

  Old Hong, the head of the group's office, quickly agreed and arranged for a car to go.

  Ten minutes later, Ling Xiaotian and Ling Qingxue walked out of the building and got into a black Mercedes - Benz. He Dong, who had lost his soul, also got into the car with a tearful face.

  The car started and headed straight for Xia ruofei's holiday villa in Changping.

  ……

  When he received a call from Ling Qingxue, who was still on the way, Xia ruofei was preparing dinner downstairs.

  So he stopped what he was doing and tidied up the living room a little.

  When the sky was about to turn dark, the black Mercedes - Benz of Ling Ji restaurant arrived at the holiday villa.

  This was Xia ruofei's first time meeting Ling Xiaotian.

  Because of what had happened last time, he did not have a good first impression of this tall, middle - aged man. However, Ling Xiaotian was Ling Qingxue's father, so Xia ruofei still gave him some face.

  He walked up to Ling Qingxue and exchanged a smile with her. Then, he greeted Ling Xiaotian with a smile," 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

  "Uncle Ling, how are you?"

  As for he Dong, who was timidly following behind Ling Xiaotian, Xia ruofei completely ignored him.

  Ling Xiaotian laughed heartily and said,"

  "Hello! Little Xia, I've heard Qingxue mention you before, but I've never had the chance to meet you! I'm sorry for believing what I heard about the cooperation last time!"

  Ling Xiaotian did not hide anything from the start and chose to be direct. This made Xia ruofei have a good impression of him.

  Xia ruofei smiled."

  "Uncle Ling, Qingxue, let's talk inside!"

  After he finished speaking, he made an inviting gesture and led the group into the villa. In the living room on the first floor, everyone took their seats according to their status. He Dong was the last to sit in the living room, not knowing whether to stand or sit, his face alternating between red and white.

  When Ling Xiaotian saw he Dong's cowardice, he couldn't help but furrow his brows. He said in a   Ling Xiaotian hurriedly said,"

deep voice,"

  "Xiao He, quickly apologize to RUO Fei."

  "I ..." He Dong opened his mouth and looked at Xia ruofei again with a trace of resentment in his eyes.

  Just as he was about to speak with difficulty, Xia ruofei waved his hand and said to Ling Xiaotian,"

  "Uncle Ling, there's no need to apologize. I don't need it ..."

  "Then ..." Ling Xiaotian looked at Xia ruofei in confusion.

  Since he didn't want he Dong to apologize, why did Xia ruofei specifically ask he Dong to come here to see him?

  Xia ruofei smiled and said,

  "Uncle Ling, I already know why you're here. Actually, I didn't intend to push the Taoyuan vegetables to the market so soon. It was Qingxue who strongly encouraged me after she tried these vegetables once ..."

  "What do you mean by encouraging ... That's encouragement, okay ..." Ling Qingxue pouted and rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei.

  "Qingxue, don't interrupt little Xia!" Ling Xiaotian said.

  Xia ruofei looked at Ling Qingxue in amusement and continued,"

  "In short, it's because of the clear snow that the peach Garden vegetables appeared in advance. I even discussed the details of the contract with Qingxue ..."

  Ling Xiaotian hurriedly said,"

  "Little Xia, we were wrong in this matter ..."

  Xia ruofei smiled and said,"

  "Uncle Ling, that's not what I meant. I'm actually quite an easy person to talk to. When I was discussing the collaboration with Xi jiangyue, I intentionally left some leeway because I was the first to agree to Qingxue ..."

  "Xiao Xia, I'm really grateful to you!" Ling Xiaotian said with great joy.

  "Uncle Ling, I'm not done yet!" Xia ruofei smiled faintly and said,"this time, it's all because of he Dong's personal revenge. We're all adults, and we need to be responsible for what we've done!"

  Xia ruofei glanced at he Dong coldly and said,"

  "So, the only condition for us to restart our cooperation is for Ling Ji restaurant to fire he Dong!"
