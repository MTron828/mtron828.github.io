Translator: 549690339

When Wu shuheng heard this, the huge stone in his heart finally fell to the ground.

“Thank you!” Wu shuheng said with some excitement.

Zhao Yongjun smiled and said,”ruofei, congratulations on buying a house that you like!” Brother Wu, congratulations on successfully raising the funds!”

“Thank you, thank you!” Wu shuheng said,”Yongjun, RUO Fei, young master Song, I’ll be the host tonight. I’ll treat everyone to a few drinks!”

“In this courtyard house, I guess!” Zhao Yongjun said. We’ll also let RUO Fei experience the life of a courtyard house in the capital!”

“Alright, alright, alright!” Wu shuheng said,”Yongjun, you know a lot of people. Help me hire a good chef!”

Song Rui interjected,”I think it’s not a bad idea to have a barbeque by the pool!” Get a few more friends to come over and have some fun! Let’s just treat it as a celebration for RUO Fei!”

Xia ruofei looked at song Rui and knew what he was thinking.

He even called a few more friends! The only person he wanted to call out was probably Zhuo Yiyi!

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”brother Zhao, song Rui, don’t make it so Grand. Let’s sign the house – buying contract first.” Brother Wu is still waiting for the money!”

“It’s fine, it’s fine, there’s no hurry ...”Wu shuheng quickly said.

Zhao Yongjun also said,”there’s no delay in the signing of the contract!” I’ll call my lawyer friend right away and ask him to come over to help draw up a contract. You guys just have to sign it. The transfer of ownership will be even easier, just leave it to me!”

“That’s right! There’s no conflict between signing the contract and eating!” Song Rui was very enthusiastic.

“Alright! You guys make the arrangements!” Xia ruofei smiled bitterly and said,”but don’t call so many people. It’ll be fine if we just gather in a small area!”

Song Rui welcomed Xia ruofei’s suggestion. He wanted to invite Zhuo Yiyi over. If all the bad friends in the circle of rich kids came, he would not be able to do anything. If the elders in his family heard about it, he would be in deep trouble.

Therefore, song Rui immediately agreed. How about this ... President Tang’s family is still in Beijing, right? You can invite them over, as well as the Australian star that your company’s CEO Feng is endorsing for you. That should be enough ... Um ... I ... Hehe ... I’ll call a friend over ...”

Xia ruofei glanced at song Rui and asked,””Do you want me to help you?”

“That’s good!” Song Rui blurted out.

He was still worried that he might not be able to invite Zhuo Yiyi!

Xia ruofei laughed and scolded,”get lost!” Take care of your own matters!”

Zhao Yongjun also smiled evilly and said,”ruofei, let’s see if we can invite director Tian’s daughter over too.” After all, you’re both from the three mountains, and you have a good relationship with each other!”

Song Rui looked at Zhao Yongjun pitifully and shouted in his heart,”‘No...’

Xia ruofei was also happy to see song Rui suffer. He immediately said,””That makes sense, makes sense! It’s all thanks to big brother Zhao’s reminder, or I would’ve really forgotten ...”

Song Rui suddenly felt like ten thousand alpacas were running through his mind ...

“Song Rui, I’ll give brother Tang and President Feng a call then.” Xia ruofei looked at song Rui with a half – Smile and said,”that friend of yours ... Do you want to invite him?”

Song Rui hesitated for a while, gritted his teeth, and said,””Please! You must!”

Zhao Yongjun and Xia ruofei gave song Rui a thumbs up at the same time. Xia ruofei smiled and said,””You’re a man! We’ll support you!” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Zhao Yongjun knew a little about song Rui’s past. He was very close to song Rui, so he would never betray him. That was why song Rui did not hide anything from Zhao Yongjun when he was talking to Xia ruofei about Zhuo Yiyi.

“Don’t forget to tell your friend that it’s a pool Party today,” Zhao Yongjun said with a smile.”Ask her to bring her swimsuit!”

Song Rui did not hesitate to give Zhao Yongjun the middle finger and said,””Get lost! You dare to go into the water in this weather?”

Xia ruofei and Zhao Yongjun raised their heads and laughed at the same time. It was already a little chilly at the end of September in the capital. This was not an indoor spa, so no one would go into the water to swim at this time.

After the discussion, everyone began to make their own phone calls.

Zhao Yongjun first called his lawyer friend and asked him to come over immediately to help with the purchase contract. Then he contacted his hotel friend and asked him to help the two chefs.

Xia ruofei contacted Tang Yitian and Feng Rao separately. When they heard that Xia ruofei had arranged a gathering that night, they naturally agreed.

Xia ruofei sent the location to the two of them and asked Feng Jing to bring Duff along.

Then, he gave Lu You a call. When Lu You learned that Xia ruofei had invited her to a friend’s gathering, she became very happy and happily agreed.

As for song Rui, he sneakily ran to the side to call Zhuo Yiyi.

“Yiyi, it’s me!” After the call was connected, song Rui said with anticipation.

Zhuo Yiyi, who had always treated song Rui as a good brother, said,””Eh? I’m at work!”

“Um ... Shall we have dinner together tonight?” Song Rui said.

“Why do you suddenly want to have a meal together?” Zhuo Yiyi yawned and said,”recently, there’s been a lot of work to do on the restoration of cultural relics. I’m about to die from exhaustion ... I’m getting ready to go home and catch up on sleep!”

“Don ‘t!” Song Rui quickly said,”I’m telling you, I’m not the one who invited you today! Do you still remember Xia ruofei? He’s the guy who helped you catch the car thief at San Shan ...”
