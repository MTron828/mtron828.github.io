Xia ruofei laughed and said,”it’s a subconscious reaction. Why do you have so many whys?” Besides ... Isn’t it natural for a boy to take care of a girl?” Lu You nodded silently. After a while, she said softly,””Thank you!” Xia ruofei grinned. He felt that this half – lying position was a little uncomfortable. He held the armrest and wanted to adjust it a little. However, with just a slight movement, he immediately felt a pain in the back of his waist. He couldn’t help but gasp. ‘Looks like he’s really hurt,’ Xia ruofei thought. It had been two or three minutes since he had drunk the petal solution. If it was an ordinary injury, he would have been much better. Now, he had only recovered slightly, but the pain was still very intense. This meant that the collision just now was very serious, and it was very likely that his bone was broken or even fractured. Seeing this, Lu You quickly asked,”how are you?” Will it work? Should I get the air stewardess to come over and take a look?” “Don ‘t, don’ t, don’t ...” Xia ruofei said hurriedly.”They’re so busy now. Don’t bother them. Besides, they can’t do anything even if they come.” “You’re pretty good at protecting women ...” Lu You looked at Xia ruofei and said. “This is one of my few good points ...” Xia ruofei chuckled. “Tsk!” Lu You looked at Xia ruofei with disdain and couldn’t help but burst out laughing. “I’m fine, don’t worry!” Xia ruofei said,”I think it’s just a hard injury. I feel better now. I don’t think my bones are hurt ...” “Really?” Lu You didn’t quite believe it. Xia ruofei did not look like he was suffering from a serious injury. It was as if his lumbar spine had been fractured and he could not move at all. “I know medicine, why Would I Lie to You?” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I saw that you were quite tired just now. You should take a nap now! Right, remember to put on your seat belt first ...” “No, I’m not sleeping anymore. I was scared just now, so I’m not sleepy anymore.” Lu You said,”I can take care of you if I’m awake. What if you need to go to the toilet or something ...” “Can you help me in?” Xia ruofei chuckled as he looked at Lu You. Lu You’s face blushed. She immediately stood up and said,””Sure! Who asked you to get injured while trying to save me? Do you want to go to the bathroom now? I can help you there now!” Xia ruofei quickly waved his hand.”No, no, no... I need to rest a little longer. It’s not easy for me to recover a little. Don’t break my back again ...” When Xia ruofei said this, he suddenly felt that it was inappropriate. This sentence was ambiguous! He hurriedly stole a glance at Lu You, but Lu You didn’t seem to hear anything. She just replied with an “Oh” and sat back down. ‘Man, it’s a good thing this girl is innocent ...’ Xia ruofei thought. “Then why don’t you sleep for a while!” Lu You said,”it doesn’t hurt so much when I’m asleep ...” “Alright, I’ll close my eyes for a while!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you should rest too! Even if you can’t sleep, you can just close your eyes and rest!” “En!” Xia ruofei closed his eyes. After a while, he felt uncomfortable all over and could not help but open his eyes. As expected, he realized that Lu You was staring at him. Seeing Xia ruofei suddenly open his eyes, Lu You blushed and quickly looked away. Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”why are you looking at me?” Didn’t I ask you to rest for a while?” “I’m just afraid that something might happen to you. ” Lu You’s face was slightly red as she said this. “I’ll call you if I need anything. I can’t sleep with you staring at me like this ...” Xia ruofei said, not knowing whether to laugh or cry. “I know, you should go to sleep!” Lu You said. After she finished speaking, she leaned back in her chair and closed her eyes. Xia ruofei shook his head with a bitter smile and continued to rest. As time passed, Xia ruofei could not fall asleep. He could feel the petal solution entering his body and healing his injuries. The back of his head and the other parts of his body that had been injured were basically no longer in pain. As for the back of his waist, which was the most seriously injured, the pain had also been greatly alleviated. There should not be any major problems. The plane finally descended slowly and finally landed smoothly at Changping International Airport. Probably taking into account the number of injured people on board, the captain was particularly careful with today’s landing. The landing process was very smooth, and there was almost no bump at the moment of contact. After the plane landed, a burst of applause sounded in the cabin. When they encountered the turbulence in the clear sky at an altitude of 10000 meters, many people thought that they would die Here. After experiencing those thrilling seconds, everyone felt like they had survived a disaster. The plane went through the runway and returned to the parking spot that was arranged in advance. Through the porthole, he could see that several ambulances had already stopped on the tarmac, and the gangway car was also the first to approach. After the cabin door opened, a group of medical staff in white coats quickly boarded the plane with first aid kits and stretchers. The air stewardess who had come over to dress Xia ruofei’s wound quickly brought a doctor over and said,””Doctor, this gentleman has injured his waist. Please give him a check.” Lu You also quickly stood up to make room for the doctor. In fact, Xia ruofei had already recovered by 70 – 80%. There was only a dull pain in the back of his waist. It was no longer as unbearable as the previous injury. His injured lower back spine must have recovered. Hence, Xia ruofei said,”doctor, I don’t think it’s a big deal. It was really painful when I hit my head. I’m much better now. I don’t think I hurt my bones.” “How can it be no big deal?” Lu You, who was at the side, immediately shouted,”you couldn’t even move just now!” The doctor immediately took it seriously and said,””Sir, let me check it first! This waist injury can be light or heavy. If it’s not treated in time, it may aggravate the injury and cause half of the body to be paralyzed ...” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’m really fine. It’s probably just a minor injury.” You see, there’s no problem for me to act now ...” Xia ruofei slowly stood up with the help of the armrest. The doctor came over and asked Xia ruofei where he was injured. He pressed down on his wound and asked Xia ruofei to do a few movements. Xia ruofei completed them easily and did not feel any pain. The doctor was also slightly relieved and said,””I don’t think your bones are injured, but to be safe, you should come back with us to the hospital for a checkup! Even if it’s just a normal muscle strain, it still needs to be treated!” “Forget it! “It’s not a big deal ...”Xia ruofei said. “How can we do that? You must go to the hospital!” Lu You said. The air stewardess also advised,”Sir, you should go to the hospital for a check – up!” Our airline will bear all the related expenses. ” “There’s really no need for that. I’ve studied Chinese medicine before. I’ll probably be fine after applying some ointment for injuries caused by falls and bruises.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it’s too troublesome to go to the hospital. I still have things to do when I get home!” “Xia ruofei ...” Lu You still wanted to persuade her, but Xia ruofei interrupted her and said,””Lu You, you still don’t believe in my medical skills? I said I’m fine, so don’t worry!” Lu You also thought of Xia ruofei’s miraculous treatment of Huanhuan’s autism and how he saved MA Xiong from a deep coma from a severe cerebral hemorrhage. She felt more at ease. After hesitating for a while, she nodded slightly to show that she respected Xia ruofei’s opinion. The doctor had examined Xia ruofei’s waist and had a general idea of the situation. He knew that the problem should not be too serious, so when he saw that Xia ruofei insisted on not going to the hospital, he did not try to persuade him anymore. There were still many injured people waiting to be treated! The air stewardess took the doctor directly to Economy Class. Before she left, the air stewardess even registered Xia ruofei and Lu You’s contact details. She said that when the investigation results were out, the airline would compensate the injured passengers. Although the air accident insurance would not necessarily compensate for the injuries caused by force majeure, as an airline company, it would definitely give an explanation to the injured passengers. Otherwise, it would really be the target of thousands of people. After the air stewardess and the doctor left, Lu You stared blankly at the mahogany armrests of the first – Class seats. She was in disbelief. She had fallen from such a high place and hit the edge of the armrests. Furthermore, both of their weights were on Xia ruofei. How could he be fine? The pained expression from before was not an act. Could it really be the “hard wound” that Xia ruofei had mentioned? A hard injury was a very painful injury, but it did not hurt the root. The pain would be greatly relieved after a while. Xia ruofei laughed and said,””Why are you in a daze? We can get off now!” “Oh ...” Lu You finally came back to her senses. “My back still feels a little uncomfortable. Please help me take my luggage down!” Xia ruofei said. “Alright, wait a moment ...” Lu You said. She stepped over Xia ruofei’s legs and opened the luggage compartment. She took Xia ruofei’s small suitcase down and then her own suitcase. She helped Xia ruofei to the seat at the cabin door and sat down. Then, she walked back to her seat and pushed their small luggage toward the cabin door. An air stewardess saw this and quickly came over to help with the luggage. Lu You supported Xia ruofei and carefully walked down the accommodation ladder. Lu You grabbed Xia ruofei’s wrist with one hand and supported the other under his armpit. This way, Xia ruofei’s large arm and half of his back were tightly pressed against Lu You’s chest. However, Lu You was completely unaware. She was afraid that Xia ruofei would fall again, so her body was very close to him. On one hand, Xia ruofei was reminiscing about the soft and bouncy touch. On the other hand, he felt a little guilty. His injuries had recovered faster than Lu You had imagined. Actually, if he was a little slower now, it should not be a problem for him to walk down the accommodation ladder alone. However, his current state was already unbelievable to Lu You. She felt that Xia ruofei’s injuries couldn’t be so light. If he appeared to be more relaxed, he would really scare her. Hence, Xia ruofei had to pretend to the end. Just like that, they got down the accommodation ladder and got on the shuttle bus. Then, they walked to the exit passageway. Along the way, Xia ruofei walked over with Lu You’s help. Their luggage was pushed over by the ground service personnel. As first – Class passengers, they were already entitled to VIP treatment. When they walked out of the departure hall, a Toyota nanny car sent by Hengfeng group’s Sanshan office was already waiting at the door. The driver was standing next to the car and looking around. When he saw Xia ruofei’s state, he quickly came over to help. The two of them helped Xia ruofei into the car. Xia ruofei’s farm and the airport were both in Changping County, so the car naturally dropped him off first and then sent Lu You back to the city. The Toyota was driving steadily on the way to Taoyuan farm. Lu You looked at Xia ruofei and suddenly said,””By the way, after school reopens, Yueyue would like to visit your farm.” “No problem! You’re always welcome to come!” Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”Oh right, why did you mention Jiang Yue at the auction yesterday?”
