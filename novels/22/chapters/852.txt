“No need, brother Xia, I already had dinner on the way here!” Lei Hu quickly replied. By the way, the daily rent for this car is 3000 Yuan. I’ll report it to you first. ”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,””No problem!”

If it wasn’t for the fact that this kind of nanny van was rarely used, Xia ruofei would have bought one without even blinking. This car only cost a few million.

Xia ruofei asked Lei Hu to park the car and told him to wait for Wanwan at the villa at 6 am tomorrow. The journey to Ganjiang province was nearly 400 kilometers, so they had to leave earlier.

At night, Xia ruofei first accompanied Hu Zi’s mother to watch TV in the living room. After she finished watching the drama and went back to her room to rest, she went upstairs to continue practicing the human – shaped jade talisman.

When it was past Teno’ clock, Xia ruofei left the medium and went to bed.

The next morning at 5:30 am, Xia ruofei got up on time, washed up, and went downstairs.

When they reached the first floor, Xia ruofei saw that Hu Zi’s mother was already up.

It turned out that she had woken up early to prepare breakfast after knowing that Xia ruofei would be leaving early.

“Godmother, why are you up?” Xia ruofei said,”I’ll just eat something on the way!”

Hu Zi’s mother laughed and said,”can’t you just eat something? breakfast is the most important thing!” Besides, his godmother was old and slept less! He’s already awake at 5 am!”

Hu ‘er’s mother then said,”quickly sit down and eat!” I’ve been putting the congee out for a while, it’s definitely not hot!”

Xia ruofei felt warm in his heart. He said,””Thank you, godmother ...”

“Silly child ... You don’t have to be so polite to your godmother.” Hu Zi’s mother looked at Xia ruofei lovingly and said,”hurry up and eat! You’ll only have the strength to drive when you’re full!”

“Swish!”

The Chinese had nothing but porridge, steamed buns, and pumpkin pancakes that Hu Zi’s mother had just made for breakfast. It was not a delicacy, but Xia ruofei enjoyed it very much.

This was because there was a sense of kinship in it.

After finishing the food quickly, Xia ruofei took out a food bag and put in a few steamed buns and pumpkin patties. He also took out a box of warm milk that Hu Zi’s mother had prepared.

After some thought, Xia ruofei grabbed a pumpkin pie and put it in his mouth. As he chewed, he mumbled,””Godmother, I’ll be leaving then!”

Hu Zi’s mother saw that Xia ruofei liked the breakfast she made so much and was very happy. She laughed and said,””Go, go! Be careful on the road!”

“I know!” Xia ruofei said.

When he walked out of the villa, the black Mercedes – Benz spint was already parked at the door. Lei Hu was sitting in the driver’s seat and playing with his mobile phone.

Xia ruofei walked over and knocked on the window on the side of the driver’s seat. Lei Hu then realized that he had come out and quickly rolled down the window.”Brother Xia!”

Xia ruofei passed the breakfast in his hands to Lei Hu and said,””Go to the side and have your breakfast! I’ll drive in front!”

“Woof! Thank you, brother Xia!” Lei Hu quickly took the breakfast and moved to the side of the car.

Xia ruofei opened the car door and got in. After setting up the navigation on his phone, he started the car and left the farm.

According to the GPS, it was 432 kilometers from the three mountains to the Luo Shan village where squad leader Luo lived. That was why Xia ruofei had asked Lei Hu to drive with him. It would not be too tiring for the two of them to switch places. The round trip was nearly 900 kilometers. Although Xia ruofei’s physical strength was beyond ordinary people, there was no need for him to suffer.

However, Lei Hu did not let Xia ruofei drive too far. Not long after he finished his breakfast, he suggested to take over Xia ruofei’s driving. At this time, the car had just entered the expressway.

Xia ruofei did not stand on ceremony with Lei Hu and exchanged seats with him at the next service area.

Then, Lei Hu did not let Xia ruofei sit in the driver’s seat. Xia ruofei did not force him. Anyway, it was not a big deal for a retired Special Forces soldier to drive a few hundred kilometers. At most, he would just drive a little longer on the return trip.

It took them more than five hours to travel 400 kilometers. They finally arrived at Luoshan village at nearly 11:30.

The road from the village entrance to the Luo family’s house was rather narrow. An ordinary car could pass, but it would be a little difficult for a nanny van. Hence, Xia ruofei had Lei Hu park the car on the empty space at the village entrance and the two of them walked over.

Along the way, they met many villagers. When they saw Xia ruofei, they all warmly greeted Jian Jia. After the fake reporter incident, Xia ruofei’s popularity in the Luo Shan village was quite high.

Although Xia ruofei did not know who these villagers were, he still greeted them with a smile.

Soon, the two of them arrived at the Luo family’s residence. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Sister – in – Law!” Xia ruofei shouted as he knocked on the door.

Soon, the door opened. However, it was not Lin Yue ‘e, but Nan Nan.

“Uncle Xia!” Nannan shouted happily. She then turned around and shouted,”Grandpa! Mother! Uncle Xia is here!”

Xia ruofei laughed as he carried Nan Nan and walked in. Lin Yue ‘e and uncle Luo also came out.

“Uncle Luo! Sister – in – Law!” Xia ruofei smiled and greeted him. He then asked,”is everything ready at home?”

Lin Yue ‘e nodded and said,”ruofei, you’ve had a hard journey!” Let’s go in and have a seat! I’ve already prepared lunch. ”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”okay, that’s good!” Let’s set off after dinner, and we’ll be able to reach the three mountains by evening!”

Uncle Luo and Lin Yue ‘e welcomed Xia ruofei and Lei Hu into the house with great enthusiasm. Lin Yue’ e then said,””Ruofei, take a seat first. There are two more dishes. They’ll be ready in a moment!”

“Alright!”

Xia ruofei sat down with Nan Nan in his arms and chatted with uncle Luo for a while in the central room.

After Xia ruofei’s treatment, uncle Luo was much more energetic. Nan Nan was also very happy with Xia ruofei’s arrival. The central room was also filled with laughter.

Lin Yue ‘e quickly prepared lunch, and everyone sat around the central room to eat.

During the meal, Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”Nan Nan, shall we go to the three mountains with uncle Xia later?”

“Uncle Xia, why do we have to go to the three mountains?” Nan Nan asked, puzzled. I still have to go to school! The summer vacation is almost over ...”

“Let’s go to San Shan to study. The schools there are very beautiful,”Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Ah?” Nannan revealed a hesitant look.

Although the little girl was still not very sensible, she was still a little unwilling to go to a strange place to study and leave the teachers and classmates she was familiar with.

Xia ruofei was a little surprised and asked softly,””Sister – in – Law, you haven’t told Nan Nan?”

“I’ve already told her once,” Lin Yue ‘e said with a bitter smile.”But she didn’t seem to be too willing ...”

“Oh ...” Xia ruofei nodded, then smiled at Nan Nan.”Nan Nan, mom is going to San Shan to work, so you have to go to school there too, understand?” When you arrive at Sanshan, you can stay with uncle Xia. Uncle Xia has a huge farm, a lot of dogs, and many fruit trees! In the summer, the trees will be full of cherries and lychees, so you can pick them as you wish ... By the way, uncle Xia’s farm is still by the sea. I can take you to the beach to pick up shells and go surfing, how about that?”

Xia ruofei described it vividly. After all, Nan Nan was just a child. After hearing it, she was immediately moved. However, when she thought of leaving her teachers and classmates, she showed a hesitant expression.

Xia ruofei smiled and continued,””Also! Nan Nan, it’s not like you’re not coming back from San Shan. If you miss your classmates and friends, I’ll get uncle Lei to drive you back. How about it?”

“Really?”

“Of course it is! I’m a man, I won’t lie to a child. ” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Oh right, I almost forgot to tell you. I have a lot of uncles on my farm. They’re all your dad’s comrades like me! They can also accompany you to play everywhere!”

“Really? And many of dad’s comrades?” The balance in Nan Nan’s heart finally tilted. She said,” I agree, uncle Xia, don’t lie to me!”

“Of course, we can make a pinky promise!”

“En!” Nannan stretched out her little finger excitedly.

Xia ruofei also extended his hand.

A child – like voice rang out in the central room.”You can’t change your mind for a hundred years ...”

After the solemn ceremony, Nan Nan said loudly,”Mother! Let’s eat quickly! After eating, we can go to the three mountains!”

Xia ruofei and the others looked at each other and smiled.
