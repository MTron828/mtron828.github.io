3050 The reunion of master and disciple (2)

Translator: 5496903Xia ruofei said,”brother Tang, Jennifer, I’m here to take Haoran to a place. It won’t take long. You can help him apply for a day’s leave. If everything goes well, I’ll send him back by tomorrow at the latest.”

Xia ruofei was also afraid that Tang Yitian and Jennifer would be worried, so he explained,””Don’t worry. It’s a good thing for Haoran. It’ll help him improve his cultivation!”

Ling Qingxue rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei. She and Song Wei had asked Xia ruofei a few times, but he refused to reveal anything. In order to take Tang Haoran away, Xia ruofei immediately revealed that he was here to help with his cultivation. He was really biased!

Tang Yitian and Jennifer only thought about it for a moment, and then immediately nodded in agreement without hesitation.

However, Tang Yitian still asked,”ruofei, are you really in such a hurry?” Even if you don’t stay for a night, you can leave after dinner! Otherwise, I’d feel really bad ...”

It was not even two in the afternoon. The time between dinner and dinner was enough for Xia ruofei to fly the black flying boat from Paradise Island to and from there. Besides, Song Wei and Ling Qingxue were on temporary leave, so Xia ruofei naturally did not want to waste so much time.

Therefore, he still said apologetically,””Big brother Tang, there’s really an urgent matter this time. How about this! If everything goes well, I’ll send Haoran back tonight! That precious ham of yours, just treat it as a midnight snack!”

Tang Yitian saw that Xia ruofei wasn’t just being polite, and her words were sincere, so he naturally didn’t ask her to stay.

He smiled bitterly and said,”alright then!” RUO Fei, I’ll order someone to prepare the carriage!”

Xia ruofei had said that if everything went well, he would be able to send Tang Haoran back by tonight. Thus, Tang Yitian naturally thought that the place Xia ruofei and the others were going to wasn’t far. It must be in Australia. Otherwise, there wouldn’t be enough time to travel. How could they rush back at night?

Therefore, Tang Yitian naturally thought of protecting the car.

Xia ruofei waved his hand and smiled.””You don’t need to prepare a car. Haoran, you can just come with me. Big brother Tang, it’s not convenient for me to disclose too many things about the cultivation world to you. In short, you can rest assured that I’ll take care of Haoran!”

“Of course I’m relieved!” Tang Yitian said with a smile. Alright! Then I won’t bother anymore ... Ruofei, are you ... Leaving just like that?”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes!” Let’s go!”

“Alright! Then I’ll send you guys out!” Tang Yitian said.

The group of people quickly took the battery – powered car and arrived at the manor’s entrance. Tang Yitian pulled Tang Haoran over and said,””Haoran, when you go out with your master this time, remember to be obedient. Don’t be naughty and don’t make your master angry, understand?” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

When Tang Haoran learned that Xia ruofei was going to take him out, he was already very excited. He didn’t listen to Tang Yitian’s advice and just kept nodding in agreement.

Xia ruofei held Tang Haoran’s hand and waved goodbye to Tang Yitian and Jennifer with a smile. Then, they walked in the direction where the airboat had just landed.

Jennifer and Tang Yitian stood at the entrance of the manor, watching them go away.

There was a hint of reluctance in Jennifer’s eyes as she asked,””Ethan, they’re leaving on foot? We’re in the suburbs, and there aren’t many cars on the road ... Why would Xia refuse you to arrange a car for him?”

Tang Yitian smiled.”Jennifer, RUO Fei has his reasons for doing so. These people are like the gods in the myths and legends. We shouldn’t ask too much about some things. As long as we know that RUO Fei would never harm Haoran, that’s enough!”

Jennifer took Tang Yitian’s arm and nodded,””Of course, I know that. It’s just that Haoran has never left my side since he was born. I’m not used to him leaving with Xia!”

Tang Yitian laughed,”didn’t RUO Fei say so?” If it was fast, it would be sent back by tonight, but it would only take half a day. Isn’t it good for us to have some alone time?”

“You’re right!” Jennifer said,”why don’t you go shopping with me this afternoon? I heard that Prada’s new bag arrived this year!”

“No problem!” Tang Yitian said straightforwardly.

……

Xia ruofei and the others were all cultivators. Although they were walking, they were still very fast.

Soon, they were far away from the manor. This was a small forest, and there were many similar manors in this area. All the residents were rich, so the space between the houses was very large, and the greenery was very well done. Such forests were everywhere. On the one hand, it was for the sake of greenery, and on the other hand, it was to ensure the privacy of the rich people living in this area.

“Master, where are we going?” Tang Haoran asked curiously.

“This is it!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Here?” Tang Haoran’s eyes widened. He was puzzled.”I come here often. There’s nothing special about it!”

Xia ruofei laughed and took out the flying boat. Then, he raised his hand and threw the flying boat out.

In the process of flying in the air, the flying boat also grew rapidly. In the blink of an eye, it became more than 20 meters long and floated above the tree.

Tang Haoran was stunned when he saw the magic – like scene.

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue were like fairy maidens. They held hands and jumped onto the flying boat. Then, they stood on the deck and looked at the dumbstruck Tang Haoran with a smile.

Xia ruofei knocked on Tang Haoran’s head and smiled.””Don’t just stand there! We should set off! I’ve promised your parents that I’ll send you home tonight!”

“Oh!” Tang Haoran came back to his senses.

Xia ruofei used his hand to support Tang Haoran’s armpit. Then, he exerted force on his feet. The two of them immediately rose from the ground and landed lightly on the deck.

“Master, this is ... A magic weapon?” Tang Haoran asked, his eyes filled with shock.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”to be exact, it’s a flying Dharma Treasure!” Alright, if you’re curious, you can stay on the deck and look at the scenery! I’m going in to control the flying boat! Qingxue, Weiwei, you two stay with Haoran!”

After the airboat was activated, it would automatically open up its protective shield. Hence, Tang Haoran would not be in any danger if he stayed on the deck. Xia ruofei could return to the control cabin without any worries.

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue had already passed the most curious stage. They also liked the cute little Haoran very much, so they simply stayed on the deck and introduced the black flying boat to Tang Haoran.

In fact, even Xia ruofei did not know much about the flying boat. He did not even know the name of the flying boat. Naturally, Song Wei and Ling Qingxue knew even less.

However, the fact that it could fly at an extremely fast speed and hide from the eyes of ordinary people and even the radar was enough to make Tang Haoran listen with great interest. He was constantly amazed.

The flying boat trembled slightly and began to rise rapidly. At the same time, it changed its direction and flew directly in the direction of the Peach Blossom Island.

Song Wei and the other two stood on the deck and saw everything clearly.

Tang Haoran could even clearly see his family’s Manor quickly becoming smaller in his field of vision, and at the same time, it quickly disappeared from his sight.

This airboat had a high elevation rate. Additionally, its flight speed could reach a level that could never be reached by common Commercial Airplanes in a short period of time. However, the passengers on the airboat were not affected by inertia at all as if they were hovering on the top of trees just now.

It only took slightly more than an hour to fly from Sydney to Paradise Island.

Based on Australia’s time, Xia ruofei’s Black flying boat was already within the range of the Taixu xuanqing formation at about three in the afternoon.

Xia ruofei skillfully maneuvered the flying boat through the protective layer of the formation. The formation did not react at all as if the flying boat did not exist.

He drove the flying boat to the rooftop of the Yanhuang building with ease.

When they were about to arrive at Peach Blossom Island, Xia ruofei had already asked Song Wei and Ling Qingxue to bring Tang Haoran into the cabin. They went straight to the cabin with the guest room function to wait.

After the flying boat stopped, Xia ruofei saw Li Yifu’s figure appear on the rooftop.

Therefore, he walked out of the cabin and stood on the deck, waving at Li Yifu, indicating him to board the airboat.
