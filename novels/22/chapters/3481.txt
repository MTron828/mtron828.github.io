Chapter 3482: How many are happy and how many are sad (2)

Translator: 549690339

Chen Nanfeng and the others had high hopes for this Mystic realm exploration.

The complex encryption method, the magical screening of music, the secret realm hundreds of thousands of miles away…

All of this meant that the mystic realm they were exploring this time was of a higher level than all the mystic realms they had explored before, and it was likely to contain huge opportunities.

Two to three months ‘time was nothing to golden core stage cultivators like Chen Nanfeng. Sometimes, even a casual closed – door cultivation would take longer than that. Hence, the three sect leaders stayed at the resort Manor and waited for Xia ruofei and the rest to return.

As a result, the reopening of the resort Manor was far away.

In such a large Manor, there were only three sect leaders living there. There were also some Qi refining disciples who were in charge of security work. The original staff of the manor had been temporarily dismissed. However, they were not fired and their salaries were still paid. However, while Chen Nanfeng and the others were living in the manor, ordinary staff were not allowed to enter the manor.

At this time, the empty resort was very quiet. In the three small villas, Chen Nanfeng, Mu Sheng, and Liu Mansha were all cultivating with their legs crossed.

In the secular world, the spiritual Qi was extremely heterogeneous. One could only cultivate at midnight and noon. At other times, one could only cultivate with the help of spiritual crystals and origin crystals, and could not absorb the spiritual Qi in the air at all.

Therefore, in order to save cultivation resources, the three sect leaders would start cultivating at midnight or noon. This way, they could more or less increase their cultivation, and they didn’t need to consume spirit crystals or origin crystals.

Chen Nanfeng was the first to notice the black Phoenix flying ship.

He, who had been cultivating, suddenly opened his eyes and released his spiritual power to check it out. Then, he stood up and walked out of the villa.

Chen Nanfeng’s face revealed a trace of excitement and anticipation as he looked up at the sky.

A few seconds later, Liu Mansha and Mu Sheng also flew over from two different directions on their flying swords.

“Sect leader Chen!” The two of them greeted.

“You guys noticed it too?” Chen Nanfeng asked.

Mu Sheng nodded with a smile and said,””If I’m not mistaken, it should be little brother Xia and the others who have returned.”

Liu Mansha’s expression was a little cold. She said indifferently, “It’s the black Phoenix flying ship! 1 can sense the airflow the Flying Ship is influencing, so I’m very sure of it!”

Half a minute later, the black Phoenix flying ship finally arrived above the resort.

Xia ruofei had already discovered Chen Nanfeng and the others, so he steered the black Phoenix flying ship directly towards the small villa.

There was no need to use spiritual energy to scan the area. Chen Nanfeng and the other two could clearly see the black Phoenix flying ship slowly approaching them in the sky with their naked eyes.

Soon, the airboat was hovering about eight meters above the ground. It was not that Xia ruofei wanted to stop at such a height, but the greenery in the resort was too good. There were trees and grass everywhere. If he flew any lower, he might scratch the trees in the courtyard.

Moreover, for cultivators, with the help of ropes, this height was nothing.

“My fellow Daoists! We’ve arrived!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”we’re at ye Yun resort. Sect leader Chen, sect leader mu, and valley master Liu are all waiting for us!”

In the endless darkness of the universe, the distance between the Earth and the Moon was actually very close. It was about 300000 kilometers. Light only needed a second to reach the moon from the earth.

However, it was a long journey for the black Phoenix flying ship and its spaceship mass that was travelling between the Earth and the Moon.

The black Phoenix flying ship dragged the spaceship mass through space for about a month before slowly approaching earth.

The Blue Planet grew larger and larger in everyone’s vision, and eventually took up the entire field of vision. However, they could still roughly see the outline of the earth from the huge arc in the distance.

Along the way, everyone took turns to be on duty and cultivate. The arrangements were done in an orderly manner.

As for masker’s Dragon Ship and combined cabin, they were also very impressive and did not have any problems.

Therefore, although the journey was lonely and boring, it was relatively smooth.

At this point, the black Phoenix flying ship and the spacecraft were already approaching low – Earth orbit. According to the plan, everyone should be transferred to the black Phoenix flying ship.

Xia ruofei controlled the black Phoenix flying ship and made an arc across the sky. At the same time, he slowed down the speed of the black Phoenix flying ship. The Flying Ship was not connected to the spacecraft. If he slowed it down, the spacecraft would definitely crash into it.

Finally, everyone put on their spacesuits and left the cabin in an orderly manner.

Xia ruofei was still the first to return to the black Phoenix flying ship.

Chen Xuan was the last to exit the cabin. After closing the cabin door, he untied the cables and returned to the black Phoenix flying ship.

With a thought, Xia ruofei kept the spaceship mass into the spirit map space. Although the spaceship mass was no longer useful, he could not let it float in low – Earth orbit for a long time. There were spacecraft and satellites from various countries everywhere in the sky. If it was captured, it would definitely cause a huge uproar. Furthermore, if the spaceship mass was not adjusted for a long time, it would eventually fall into the atmosphere. If it really landed somewhere on Earth, it would be a bunch of trouble.

Since masker had risked his life to provide Xia ruofei with spacesuits and spacesuits, Xia ruofei could not cause any trouble for him.

After everyone returned to the black Phoenix flying ship, Xia ruofei started the Flying Ship and continued to head towards earth.

Soon, the Flying Ship entered the atmosphere and flew across the sky.

When the altitude dropped to about 3000 meters, everyone took off their spacesuits. At this altitude, the oxygen content was more than enough. Even ordinary people could survive, let alone the cultivators.

Everyone took a deep breath at the same time. They had been breathing in the air on Earth for decades, but this was the first time they felt that the air was so familiar. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Everyone left the cabin and stood on the deck of the black Phoenix flying ship, looking down.

At this moment, the flying boat was flying across the sea at high speed, and below it was the Pacific Ocean.

When Xia ruofei was controlling the black Phoenix flying boat, he had deliberately avoided the traditional flight route. Even if an aircraft deviated and passed through this area, the cruising altitude of the cross – Ocean flight was more than 10000 meters. An altitude of about 3000 meters could be said to be very safe. At this altitude and area, the probability of colliding with other aircraft was much lower than winning the lottery.

Moreover, Xia ruofei had been releasing his spiritual power to explore the area. If something like that happened, Xia ruofei could avoid it with his current spiritual power and reaction speed.

Xia ruofei continued to control the black Phoenix flying ship as he said,””Fellow Daoists, we’ll be able to return to Huaxia after crossing this Sea area. You’ve had a hard journey!”

“Brother RUO Fei, you’re the one who’s been working the hardest!” Chen Xuan replied,”without you controlling the black Phoenix flying ship, we would never have been able to reach that secret realm!”

“That’s right! “Yang Liu said with a smile. Fellow Daoist Xia has also made great contributions in cracking the rising Dragon Order. Speaking of which, we’re all benefited from this!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”without the token provided by everyone, there’s no way to crack it. There’s no need to be so polite.” We can be considered to have gone through life and death together, this is not something that an ordinary friendship can compare to!”

As they talked, they enjoyed the scenery below the airboat. “That’s right! “Yang Liu said with a smile. Fellow Daoist Xia has also made great contributions in cracking the rising Dragon Order. Speaking of which, we’re all benefited from this!”
