Chapter 439: Past deeds (3)

“Oh?” Tian Huilan also revealed a strange expression, and then asked with concern, “What’s Xiao Rui’s attitude?”

Xia ruofei forced a smile and said,””He told me this because he wanted to confide in me. What do you think his attitude would be?”

Tian Huilan immediately looked very disappointed. She muttered,””How did this happen? Our parents have known each other for decades, and the two children are a perfect match! Why is Xiao Rui also ...”

Xia ruofei looked at Tian Huilan, and after a quick thought, he made up his mind and said,””Secretary Tian, I don’t know if I should say this ...”

“Tell me, I won’t blame you no matter if you’re right or wrong.” Tian Huilan immediately said.

When she heard Xia ruofei say that even song Rui was against this marriage, she was already very confused. At this time, she naturally wanted to hear Xia ruofei’s opinion.

Xia ruofei said,”Secretary Tian, this is your family matter. I shouldn’t have said anything. However, as song Rui and Lu You’s friend, I still want to be bold and give you a few words of advice ... You can’t force a melon to be sweet. Everyone knows this. Of course, I also understand the wishes of the older generation. I’m sure you all see song Rui and Lu You’s marriage as a continuation of your friendship ...”

Xia ruofei added in his heart,”There was definitely a consideration of political interests in this.

Of course, Xia ruofei was not stupid. He would not say that.

Tian Huilan nodded in agreement and said,”Su Mei and I had the same thoughts, but we didn’t expect ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I just didn’t expect Lu You and song Rui to not appreciate it.” Secretary Tian, I think that your wish is good, and it’s not a problem to work hard in this area. But at least for now, I personally think that we should try to let nature take its course. ”

“Oh? Why do you say that?”

“First of all, Lu You is still in University. It’s too early to talk about marriage.” Xia ruofei had completely let go. He said,”also, you know that Lu You is rebellious. The more you force her to do something she’s not willing to do, the more intense her reaction will be ...”

At this point, Xia ruofei paused for a moment, then said meaningfully,””For example, this time ... Lu You suddenly went to a bar to get drunk alone. I don’t think it’s an isolated incident. Instead of feeling sad and bitter, it’s better to find out the reason why she did this and prevent similar dangers from happening in the future.”

Actually, Xia ruofei knew that Lu You went to the bar most likely because of the argument they had at the restaurant the other day. However, Xia ruofei would not be so silly as to bring it up himself.

Tian Huilan immediately revealed a pensive expression. After a long while, she sighed and said,”RUO Fei, you’ve really enlightened me! I might have been a little too hasty in this matter ...”

“Secretary Tian, I’m just making a wild guess. Please don’t forget what I’ve said.” Xia ruofei quickly said.

Tian Huilan waved her hand.”I won ‘t. Your analysis is quite reasonable. Thank you.”

“You’re welcome. “Secretary Tian, if there are no other instructions, I’ll ...” Xia ruofei said.

“Alright, come visit us when you’re free. My father often talks about you!” Tian Huilan said with a smile.

“Definitely!” Xia ruofei stood up and said,”then I’ll take my leave.”

“Alright,” Tian Huilan nodded and said,”let Youyou in!” I need to talk to her ...”

“Alright,” he said.

After Xia ruofei finished speaking, he strode out of Tian Huilan’s office.

Outside, Lu You was sitting uneasily on the sofa. When she saw Tian Huilan’s office door open and Xia ruofei walk out, she stood up immediately and asked uneasily,””Xia ruofei, what did my mom say to you? She didn’t criticize you, right?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”no!” We were just casually chatting and asking about my recent situation. ” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Lu You didn’t really believe it, but seeing that Xia ruofei’s expression was normal, she was relieved.

“Secretary Tian wants you to go in!” Xia ruofei said,”I’m not going to wait for you. I have a lot of things to do at the farm. I have to hurry back.”

“Oh ... Alright!” Lu You said.

She took two steps towards Tian Huilan’s office and looked pitifully at Xia ruofei.””Xia ruofei, I ... I’m a little scared ... How am I supposed to tell my mom?”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but find it funny. He thought for a while and walked to Lu You’s side.

As Xiao Mei was still in the office, it would be inconvenient to say it directly. Hence, Xia ruofei leaned over to Lu You’s ear and whispered,””You can pretend to be pitiful and aggrieved later. If Secretary Tian asks, you can say that you were upset about the marriage, so you went to the bar ...”

Xia ruofei’s mouth was almost touching Lu You’s ear. The breath he exhaled made Lu You’s neck itch. Her body was hot and soft, and her face turned red.

However, when Lu You heard Xia ruofei’s words, she even forgot about her shyness. She widened her eyes and asked in a low voice,””This ... This will work?”

Xia ruofei winked at Lu You and said with a smile,””If you believe me, just say it like this. I guarantee that you’ll be able to get through this difficult time, and maybe you’ll even get a pleasant surprise!”

“Mm! I’ll listen to you!” Lu You nodded and said.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”go in!” I’ll be leaving first!”

After that, Xia ruofei bade Xiao Mei goodbye and left the office.

Lu You stood at the door of Tian Huilan’s office. She took a few deep breaths, gritted her teeth, pushed the door open, and walked in.
