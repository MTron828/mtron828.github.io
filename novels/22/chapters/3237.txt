In fact, what Mannu did not know was that there were countless Chinese medicine doctors who could use the smallest silver needle. This was not a great skill, but if the silver needle was not used well and the acupuncture point was chosen wrongly, it could lead to serious consequences. If this thin silver needle was used by a quack doctor, it could hurt one’s life. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Mannu didn’t even know the acupuncture points of Traditional Chinese Medicine, so naturally, he wouldn’t know these things.

Elon Musk looked at the silver needles. Although they were thin, they were not short. Thinking about how long they were, he was a little scared.

However, there were so many people watching, and his girlfriend, glams, was also there. He also wanted to use this treatment to test Xia ruofei’s medical skills, so he could not back down no matter what.

Elon Musk hesitated for a moment, then nodded and said,””Yes, doctor Xia, please treat him according to your Chinese medicine method! I have no objections. ”

Xia ruofei nodded.”Because little X’s subsequent treatment will also use acupuncture. I’m telling you in advance so that you can be mentally prepared.”

When Elon Musk heard that he was going to use the acupuncture technique on little X, he immediately burst out with fatherly love and said without hesitation,””In that case, try it on me first!”

When Xia ruofei saw that Elon Musk was like a warrior who had left and would never return, he could not help but find it funny.

“As long as the technique is correct, there is no danger in acupuncture,” he said.”Mr. Masker, please relax. If your muscles are tense, it is not conducive to acupuncture.”

Li Yifu also laughed and said,”Mr. Masker, Dr. Xia’s words are very important. If you keep tightening the muscles of your whole body, the silver needle may get stuck or even break inside. So you must relax!”

Elon Musk was even more nervous after hearing Li Yifu’s words, and it was difficult for him to relax.

Xia ruofei could not help but look at Li Yifu and shook his head, not knowing whether to laugh or cry.

He didn’t let Elon Musk relax. Instead, he opened a bottle of medical alcohol, dipped a cotton swab in the alcohol, and sanitized the silver needle.

Then, he also used cotton swabs dipped in alcohol to disinfect the acupuncture points behind Elon Musk’s ears.

After that, Xia ruofei picked up a silver needle with his fingers and said calmly,””Mr. Masker, we will start the treatment now. Please relax your body ...”

These words didn’t sound like much to grams and the others, but when they fell into elonmask’s ears, it seemed to have an invisible magic that made him relax involuntarily.

Of course, this was just a small application of the mental energy hypnotism technique. Now that Xia ruofei’s mental energy had increased greatly, this small technique could be said to be very familiar. There was no possibility of failure when used on ordinary people.

Just as Elon Musk relaxed, Xia ruofei’s right hand quickly stretched forward and then immediately retracted.

Elon Musk didn’t even feel anything. He only felt an itch behind his ear. It wasn’t painful at all. Even a mosquito bite was more painful than this.

When he saw that the silver needle in Xia ruofei’s hand had disappeared, he realized that Xia ruofei had completed the acupuncture process.

To Grims, Mannu, and the rest, Xia ruofei’s technique was even more amazing. The speed at which he inserted the needle was too fast, causing everyone’s vision to blur. They seemed to see Xia ruofei’s hand shake, and then they saw that the silver needle had already been inserted into a certain position behind elonmask’s ear, and it was still trembling.

Before the crowd could react, Xia ruofei had already picked up the second sterilized silver needle. Similarly, he did not need to identify the acupuncture points. He waved his right hand and the second silver needle was inserted.

Xia ruofei’s needle – inserting process was as smooth as floating clouds and flowing water. Everyone was dazzled by it.

In just a few breaths, Xia ruofei had already inserted the silver needles into six acupuncture points.

The order and depth of these silver needles were paid attention to, but gramus and the others naturally couldn’t see through it. Even Li Yifu didn’t know much about it, so at most, he was just watching for fun.

For Elon Musk’s problem of tinnitus, if he used the petals of the spirit Heart Flower, perhaps one – tenth of the petals would be enough to solve the problem.

However, to Xia ruofei, who had already integrated many lost and precious Chinese medicine books, this problem could be easily solved with Chinese medicine methods. Naturally, there was no need to waste precious petals.

What’s more, he was cured simply by drinking a medicinal paste, so how could he show his medical skills?

Hence, Xia ruofei still chose acupuncture, which had a strong “spectator” nature. This would also give elonmask and Glamus a greater shock and make them more determined to invite him to treat little X.

After inserting the needles, Xia ruofei began to gently twist the silver needles and sometimes flicked a certain silver needle with his fingertips.

If a Chinese medicine master were to see this long – Lost acupuncture technique, he would definitely be shocked.

It was a pity that there were no audience members who knew the industry.

Of course, even though they did not understand, they could still see that Xia ruofei’s movements were smooth and comfortable.

On the other hand, Elon Musk felt it more directly. Although he could not see Xia ruofei’s movements, he could feel an obvious soreness at the spot where the silver needle was inserted. It was as if someone had applied a hot towel on him. From the back of his ears to his neck, he felt warm.
