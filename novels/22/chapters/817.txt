Chapter 818: A wish (1)

Translator: 549690339

It was already evening when Xia ruofei woke up after a nap.

The employees of Qiantang Tongren Hall arrived at Taoyuan farm in their dusty cars. President Lin and Dr. Huang also woke up with a tired face. They had drunk a lot in the afternoon. Fortunately, the Drunken Eight Immortals wine had no side effects, so they didn’t have the headaches that they had after getting drunk.

Xia ruofei called everyone to the dining hall for dinner, then he ordered Qin Xiaojun to bring out the iron – hide Kaede Doudou that was provided to Tongren Hall.

This time, Xia ruofei only gave Tongren Hall 130 kilograms of iron – hide maple dourds, which was slightly less than the last time. Of course, even if they provided this amount every month, it would definitely be more than the agreed supply in a year.

In addition, he had gotten two precious wild ginseng today, so although President Lin was a little disappointed, he accepted it happily.

Mr. Lin and Dr. Huang had personally examined the tin Kaede roses, which was just a routine. In fact, the quality of the tin Kaede roses that Xia ruofei provided each time was far higher than the average special grade.

Then, he weighed it again to confirm the weight of this batch of iron – skinned maple buckets.

Then, President Lin readily signed his name on the list of supplies that pang Hao had drawn up and signed the supply agreement between Qiantang Tongren Tang and Tao Yuan co. The list of supplies was in effect with President Lin’s signature. The specific amount of money was transferred from a public account to a public account. Pang Hao would follow up on the details, so Xia ruofei did not have to worry about it.

Xia ruofei personally took out the two wild ginseng that CEO Lin had temporarily kept with him from the office safe. At the same time, he took out a small box of Dahongpao tea leaves that weighed about 50 grams and handed it to CEO Lin.

President Lin personally escorted the car back to Jiangsu and Zhejiang Province overnight.

The small truck from Tongren Hall disappeared into the night. Xia ruofei heaved a sigh of relief. This series of busy work had finally come to an end.

Over the past few days, Xia ruofei’s personal account had more than 25 million Yuan in it, mainly from the sale of the Blood Red Dragon and the wild ginseng.

The company’s 22 million from the tin Kaede fight would soon be transferred to the company’s account. In addition to the daily sales of Taoyuan vegetables, it was also a constant fixed income, so the company’s funds were still quite abundant.

Xia ruofei had heard Feng Jing and pang Hao’s financial reports the day before. There was more than 30 million Yuan in the company’s liquidity account, and it could be said that the company was in a very healthy state.

One had to know that paradise Corporation had never taken a loan from the bank since its establishment. Until now, it still had zero debt. This was rare among startup companies, and it could even be said to be the only one.

For the next two days, Xia ruofei stayed at the farm to handle some daily work. He also called for a few meetings with the various business heads in the company to make decisions on some development issues.

This was especially so for the pharmaceutical factory. The approval for the new drug had already entered the second phase of clinical trials. The work in all aspects was very cumbersome. Other than grasping the general direction, Xia ruofei also praised Xue Jinshan and the others and said many words of encouragement. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Of course, there were also material incentives. Xia ruofei also promised to give additional bonuses to the employees of the pharmaceutical company after the approval of the new drug was completed.

Xia ruofei had also considered that he would have to go out again, so before leaving the three mountains, he had to at least ensure that the company ran smoothly.

Xia ruofei spent the next few days with Ling Qingxue.

It was already three days later when he finished sorting out the farm work.

Xia ruofei carried a backpack and went on a long journey again.

Lei Hu drove Xia ruofei to the international airport of Sanshan city in his Mercedes.

However, his first stop wasn’t Tibet. His destination was Ganjiang province, next to the southeast province. Lin Yue ‘e, the widow of old Luo, had returned to her hometown with Luo’s ashes. Xia ruofei estimated that the funeral should be almost settled, so he was ready to go there personally to complete the task that Wolf King Guo Zhan had given him.

Of course, Xia ruofei had always hoped to do something for the deceased, especially when Lin Yue ‘e was the family of old Luo. During the years he had served lone wolf, Lin Yue’ e would bring a lot of good food whenever she visited. She would even rush to help the soldiers wash their clothes. Xia ruofei respected this sister – in – Law from the bottom of his heart.

Two hours later, Xia ruofei’s flight landed at the airport of Yuzhang, the capital of Ganjiang province.

After Xia ruofei left the airport, she immediately rented a taxi to head straight to squad leader Luo’s hometown, Linzhang city, guhuang County.

Guhuang County was about 150 kilometers away from Yuzhang city. However, the mountainous roads were not easy to walk on, so Xia ruofei only arrived at noon.

He had spent 800 Yuan on this car for the entire day. Hence, when they arrived at the county, Xia ruofei and the driver found a restaurant to have lunch. Then, they went to the nearby streets to buy some offerings before taking the car to the martyrs ‘Cemetery at the side of the county.

The martyrs ‘Cemetery in guhuang County was located in the Wenling mountain forest Park on the outskirts of the county.

Xia ruofei arrived at the entrance of the forest Park by car. He asked the driver to wait in the parking lot while he walked up the mountain with the offerings. He had only paid half of the fare, so he did not have to worry about the driver running away.

Of course, there was only one exit in Wenling mountain forest Park, so the driver did not have to worry about Xia ruofei running away. Besides, the 400 yuan fare was enough to book a car from Yuzhang to guhuang. However, the driver might not be able to make another 400 yuan when he returned now, so he naturally waited for Xia ruofei here with peace of mind.
