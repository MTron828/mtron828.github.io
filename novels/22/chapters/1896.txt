Chapter 1897: An inkling (1)

Translator: 549690339

Wang Chong’s speed of recording was extremely fast, and the book was filled with strange combinations of symbols and numbers. Even if this book was lost or picked up by someone else, it was impossible for them to understand the contents of the book. Only Xu Yougang and the others could grasp the patterns of these symbols.

The two cars followed Liu haojun’s car into San Shan city.

Liu haojun’s car drove straight into the provincial mansion’s compound. No matter how powerful Xu Yougang and the others were, it was impossible for them to follow him into the heavily guarded compound. They found a relatively hidden place not far away, but they could still see the provincial mansion’s Gate. They stopped the car by the side.

Wang Chong had also recorded the time Liu haojun entered the courtyard, but he didn’t know who he was meeting.

……

Half an hour later, Liu haojun came down from the office building in high spirits.

He had gained a lot from this trip to the provincial government. Although “uncle fan” didn’t give him any guarantees out of professional habit, he provided him with a seemingly reliable solution. At least, in Liu haojun’s opinion, there was still a lot of hope for the project to introduce Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory.

Liu haojun had buried his hatred for Xia ruofei deep in his heart. He only wanted to settle the project first. When Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory was really in Changping, it would be easy for him to control Xia ruofei with such a big business.

Even if he were to take a step back and let Xia ruofei off for the time being, allowing the construction and construction of the Tao Yuan pharmaceutical factory to go smoothly, it wouldn’t be a loss to him. On the contrary, the more successful Xia ruofei’s pharmaceutical factory was, the more political returns he would receive. Every cent that Xia ruofei’s pharmaceutical factory earned was an achievement for him.

It could be said that as long as the pharmaceutical factory project was settled in Changping, Liu haojun would be in an invincible position.

The driver drove the car to the front of the building. After Liu haojun got in the car, he let out a long breath, as if he wanted to vent out all the depression he had been feeling these days.

“Secretary, where should we go next?” The driver asked respectfully.

“Back to Changping!” Liu haojun said.

“Yes!”

The car started slowly and drove out of the courtyard.

Liu haojun leaned against the soft seat and closed his eyes to rest. Wu Liqian’s figure appeared in his mind from time to time.

Sometimes, men were like this. The more they couldn’t get something, the more they wanted it.

Wu Liqian’s resistance to him made him feel like his heart was being scratched. On this matter, his mentality had already developed in a serious direction of imbalance. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Wu Liqian was far away from the capital, so Liu haojun couldn’t launch an “attack” on Wu Liqian in a short time. It was because of this that the frustration in his heart didn’t reduce much after the meeting with uncle fan today.

On the contrary, he felt a ball of fire burning in his heart. If he didn’t vent out this ball of evil fire, he felt that he would be suffocated.

Liu haojun frowned and thought for a moment, then suddenly said,””Old Zhou, I’m not going back to Changping. Send me to the West Lake Mansion!”

“Yes, Secretary!” The driver, old Zhou, said.

Old Zhou was brought over by Liu haojun from Beijing. He had been working for the Liu family for a long time and was loyal to the Liu family. Liu haojun basically did not avoid him in many matters.

In fact, Lao Zhou was still paid by the Liu family. He was only responsible for driving Liu haojun in Changping County. He was not under the jurisdiction of the government vehicles and was basically Liu haojun’s private driver.

Of course, this was not in line with the regulations. However, everyone turned a blind eye to such a small matter. They would not nitpick and ask Liu haojun to rectify it.

Even though ol ‘Zhou had only been in the southeast province for a few months, he was still very familiar with the places that Liu haojun frequented.

The West Lake Mansion was a place that Liu haojun visited very often. After Lao Zhou drove out of the provincial mansion compound, he turned the car left with ease and drove in the direction of the West Lake Mansion.

West Lake Mansion was the name of one of the high – end buildings in Sanshan city. It was located next to West Lake Park in the heart of Sanshan city. The price of the second – hand houses in this building far exceeded the price of a new plot of land in the same area. Whether it was its geographical location or natural environment, there was nothing to be picky about. Even the plot of land was very good. It was suitable for a primary school directly under Sanshan city that had been in the top three in the city for a long time.

When the average price of real estate in Sanshan was only about 10000 Yuan, the average price of this building was already close to 20000 Yuan. With the rapid growth in the past few years, the real estate price in Sanshan city had reached about 30000 Yuan. The price of a second – hand house in West Lake Mansion was more than 50000 Yuan per square meter. It was definitely a high – end high – Quality real estate.

Xia ruofei’s deduction was also very accurate. A person like Liu haojun would never have a pure heart and few desires. He would never live an ascetic life. A dog would never change its habit of eating shit.

In fact, Liu haojun already had a woman not long after he arrived in the southeast province. For this reason, he even bought a penthouse apartment in the West Lake Mansion so that he could have a quiet, private, and very safe place to have fun when needed.

Xu Yougang and the others naturally followed him immediately.

In the car in front, Liu haojun didn’t avoid the driver, old Zhou. He took out his phone and dialed a number.””Where are you? If there’s nothing else, then get off work earlier! I’ll be waiting for you at the West Lake Mansion!”

On the City Channel of Sanshan TV station, the female host, Fang Chenchen, had just finished recording an episode of the show and was removing her makeup in the dressing room. When her phone rang, she asked the makeup artist to stop and took the phone to the bathroom to answer the call.
