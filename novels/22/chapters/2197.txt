2198 Chapter 1214 – willing to bet, willing to admit defeat (2)

Ling Qingxue chuckled and said,””Someone seems to have a bad start! Where’s the blue lobster?”

Xia ruofei was tidying up the net. He said without looking up,””What’s the hurry? If I can get a blue lobster with the first net, wouldn’t I be a God?”

“Even if I give you a hundred or a thousand chances, you still won’t be able to catch any more blue lobsters ... Oh, right, ruofei, should we set a number of times?” Ling Qingxue said rudely. You can’t keep casting your net without any restrictions, right? Then if we can’t fish it out, when will we get it?”

Xia ruofei smiled,”you can’t wait to win?” Then, my wife ... What if I lose if I can’t get anything?”

Ling Qingxue tilted her head and thought for a moment before saying,””It’s a bit of bullying if it’s too little, huh? After all, this was too difficult ... How about ... 50 times? However, you can only play the net 25 times today! The remaining half will come back tomorrow! We’re out at sea to play, not to fish ...”

Xia ruofei replied readily,”sure!” 25 times it is! Don’t wait until tomorrow, if I can’t get it today, I’ll lose! That’s good enough, right?”

“Really?” Ling Qingxue looked at Xia ruofei in disbelief.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”can I go back on my word?” Let’s set the limit at 25 times, and we’ll decide the winner and loser today!”

“You said it!” Ling Qingxue said,”let’s continue! There are still 24 more ...”

“What happened just now counts as well?” Xia ruofei widened his eyes and pretended to be calculative.

“Of course!” Ling Qingxue said.

“Okay, okay, okay ...” Xia ruofei said,”I’ll go easy on you!”

With that, he cast the net out again.

This time, he was serious. He didn’t cast the net far. At the moment he cast the net, he connected with space and instantly locked onto a blue lobster that was leisurely blowing bubbles at the bottom of the sea. He moved it to the outside world, making it appear directly in the sea, and right under the net.

The unlucky blue lobster didn’t even realize that it had changed its position before it was caught by the net.

Ling Qingxue leaned back and placed her hands on the affinity platform. Her long legs were still shaking when Xia ruofei took back the net.

Ling Qingxue glanced at him and said with a smile,””The harvest from this net seems to be very small ...”

Xia ruofei did not deliberately look for fish. This kind of random casting would not yield much.

However, it was enough as long as the blue lobster was there.

Ling Qingxue couldn’t see clearly through the net, but when Xia ruofei poured all the fish in the net onto the AGO, her eyes were immediately fixed on the pile of small fish and prawns. The big blue lobster was so conspicuous. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

It was more than 40 centimeters long and bright blue in color. Even an ordinary person could tell the difference between this lobster and an ordinary lobster at a glance.

Xia ruofei also pretended to be surprised and said,””Ya! I think I’ve fished it out!”

Ling Qingxue was dumbfounded. After a while, she muttered,””This ... How is this possible?”

Xia ruofei stretched out his hand and poked the blue lobster. He teased,””Wife, seeing is believing! Look at my character! You gave me 25 chances, but I only used two ...”

Ling Qingxue’s face was filled with disbelief. After she regained her senses, she pouted and said to Xia ruofei,””You must have cheated, right? How can there be such a coincidence?”

Xia ruofei put on an innocent expression and spread his hands.”Wife, have some conscience when you speak! How could I cheat? You saw me throw the empty net in and then you saw me bring the lobster up, right?”

“I don’t care!” Ling Qingxue said. This was simply impossible! There must be something wrong with this abnormal situation! Ruofei, tell me honestly, how did you cheat?”

Xia ruofei blinked his eyes and said gloomily,””Wife, even if you want to go back on your word, you should at least find a better reason ... Forget it, I know you’re competitive, so let’s call off our bet! I’ll just pretend that this never happened ...”

Ling Qingxue blushed and said,””No! Why can’t I afford to lose? What’s the point of calling off the bet?”

Xia ruofei spread his hands and said,”then you can’t just insist that I cheated!” I’ve already fished up the blue lobster, you can’t count it as my loss, right?”

“Then you win. Is that okay?” Ling Qingxue said reluctantly.

Xia ruofei immediately beamed with joy and said,””Of course! Wife, I remember that our agreement was that if I win, you must agree to one of my requests, right?”

Ling Qingxue replied, a little embarrassed,”yes, yes, yes!” Go ahead! Do you have any requests? I’m warning you! You’re not allowed to make such a dirty request!”

Xia ruofei looked at Ling Qingxue and asked,””What do you mean by a dirty request? Wife, don’t tell me you think I’m going to ...”

“You’re not allowed to say anything!” Ling Qingxue’s face was red as she interrupted Xia ruofei’s words.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”good, good, good!” I promise it’s a normal request ... But I can’t think of what I want to ask for at the moment, so I’ll just owe you!”

Ling Qingxue finally let out a sigh of relief and nodded in agreement.

Xia ruofei placed the blue lobster into a separate bucket and picked out the other fish and prawns. He threw the small ones back into the sea and placed the slightly bigger ones into another bucket.

Xia ruofei said,”it seems like the harvest is a little lacking!” It’s not even enough to make lunch, right? I’ll cast a few more nets!”

Xia ruofei cast the net two more times and got a bucket of fish and a precious blue lobster.

Satisfied, he stood up and put the fishing net on his body. Then, he picked up a bucket in each hand and said with a smile,””Today’s lunch and dinner are settled! My wife! Let’s go! Come and prepare lunch with me! Let’s have a taste of the blue lobster this afternoon!”

“Didn’t you eat it last time?” Ling Qingxue asked.

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment. He then remembered that he had told Ling Qingxue that he had eaten the blue lobster. Otherwise, there was no other explanation! After all, the existence of the spirit map space was his biggest secret. Even someone as close as Ling Qingxue couldn’t tell him.

“I thought you’ve never eaten it before?” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’m mainly here today to let you have a taste!”

Ling Qingxue smiled and nodded,”sure!” Then I’ll go help you too!”

The yacht had a well – equipped kitchen, and the cooking of the seafood was very simple. Most of them were boiled in water or boiled in white. The simpler the cooking, the more delicious the taste could be preserved ...

Soon, a sumptuous lunch was prepared. The ingredients were all from today’s fish, and the most important dish was naturally the steamed blue lobster ...

Xia ruofei even made a trip to the cabin and took out some wine from the medium and placed it in the wine cabinet. Then, he took a bottle of expensive sweet wine and returned to the dining room on the deck.

The two of them sat in the restaurant at the stern, facing the 360 – degree ocean view and a sumptuous seafood feast. They chatted while tasting the excellent white wine and seafood, and the atmosphere was quite warm and harmonious.

The blue lobster’s meat was very fresh and tender. Perhaps it was because it had grown up in the medium, but its taste was excellent, and it even had a faint hint of a special sweetness. The two ate with relish.

Although the blue lobster had caused Ling Qingxue to lose her bet, she still couldn’t help but give it a thumbs up, praising the taste of the lobster.

After lunch, the couple cleaned up the table together.

Xia ruofei said while washing the dishes,””Wife, we can’t just play on this trip. While no one is disturbing us on the sea, let’s cultivate together in the afternoon! This time, I’ll try to let you break through to refined Qi Level 3 in one go!”
