Elon Musk waved his hand and said,”Dr. Mannu, I am quite satisfied with your work. These few days, you and your team have done your best for little X. So, there is no need to resign.”

“Mr. Masker ...” Mannu felt a little ashamed and felt that he had no face to stay any longer.

Elon Musk waved his hand and interrupted Mannu’s words, saying,””I still hope that you can stay, Dr. Mannu, and continue to perfect little X’s treatment plan. We can be a backup option.”

At this point, elonmask looked at Xia ruofei and asked politely,””Doctor Xia, you don’t mind, do you?”

Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”of course! It’s better to be safe than sorry!” Even though I don’t think it’s necessary, I won’t interfere with your decision. ”

Elon Musk looked a little embarrassed, and Li Yifu, who was at the side, also looked unhappy. He felt that Elon Musk did not trust Xia ruofei enough. On the other hand, Xia ruofei remained calm and did not show any emotional fluctuations.

Elonmask hesitated for a moment and said,””Then please let Dr. Mannu’s team stay! After all, they still have to provide other medical services for me and my family. ”

Xia ruofei nodded with a smile and said,””I have no objections, but I hope that Mr. Mannu and the other members of the team can sign a confidentiality agreement ...”

“A confidentiality agreement?” Elon Musk was stunned for a moment.

“Regarding today’s matter and the patient’s subsequent treatment, I don’t want the outside world to make a big deal out of it. So, I think a confidentiality agreement is necessary.” Xia ruofei said.

Elonmask said in confusion,””Mr. Xia, if you can cure such a dangerous disease, you will definitely become famous around the world! And ...”

“I don’t want to be famous.” Xia ruofei interrupted Elon Musk’s words.

Elon Musk was very puzzled by Xia ruofei’s decision. There was actually someone in this world who would complain about his fame? He was in the internet and high – tech industry, so he had some deep – rooted ideas. Sometimes, good news or even an illusory concept could double the market value of a technology company. Therefore, he could not understand Xia ruofei’s low – Profile approach.

However, since Xia ruofei had made his decision, he would not object. After all, it was his freedom.

Therefore, elonmax nodded and said,””No problem!”

“Dr. Mannu, this confidentiality agreement ...”

“We’ll sign it!” Mannu said without hesitation. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Although he didn’t understand the Chinese ‘indifference to fame and fortune’, it was only good for him to keep this high – paying job. As for the confidentiality agreement, it was not a loss for him. Even if he didn’t sign any agreement, he was not willing to help Xia ruofei promote everywhere.

Elon Musk nodded, took out his mobile phone, and called his assistant to arrange the confidentiality agreement.

Elon Musk’s company had many cutting – edge technologies, and confidentiality was of utmost importance. Such confidentiality agreements had templates, and it was not difficult to make slight changes to the Terms based on the templates.

“Doctor Xia, I’ve already made the arrangements.” Elon Musk said,”after the confidentiality agreement is ready, Dr. Mannu and his team members will sign it as soon as possible!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.

Mannu felt that he had no face to stay any longer, and took the opportunity to say,””Mr. Masker, I’ll go and perfect the treatment plan first!”

“Alright, thank you!”

“Let’s go!” Manu left the room with his team members. He had come in aggressively, but not only did he not expose the “liar”, but he had also been slapped in the face. In the blink of an eye, their high – end medical team had become a backup. It was really heartbreaking ...

Xia ruofei said to Elon Musk,””Mr. Masker, regarding the problem of tinnitus, I have to tell you that acupuncture can only treat the symptoms ...”

“Treat the symptoms?”

Although Xia ruofei tried to explain the word ‘treating the symptoms’ in English in an easy – to – understand way, it was obvious that Elon Musk still did not understand.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”in simple words, it can only relieve the pain.”

“Ah?” Elon Musk was shocked. He didn’t want to experience the torture of tinnitus again.”That ... That means that such symptoms will appear in the future? Then can I do acupuncture once in a while?”

“This can be done, but it will only treat the symptoms and not the root cause.” Xia ruofei said,”so if you want to solve this problem completely, you need to take Chinese medicine.”

Elon Musk heaved a long sigh of relief. He had thought that this illness could never be cured!

“No problem!” He quickly replied. I’ll listen to you, doctor Xia! We’ll treat him however you want!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. He asked for a pen and paper from Elon Musk and started writing. After a while, Xia ruofei stopped writing and handed the piece of paper to him.

Elon Musk took it and looked at it. It was all in Chinese. Although the words looked very ethereal, even he, who did not understand Chinese at all, felt that these words were full of spirit, but the key was that he did not know what the content was!
