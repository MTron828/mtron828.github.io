Chapter 1507: A rare treasure (1)

“Master, this is a thorny vine root.” Xia Qing said,”didn’t you store some medicinal herbs at the Archean realm in the past? Coincidentally, there are still some rattan roots left ...”

“This thing can draw out the Mirage beast?” Xia ruofei asked in disbelief.

After Xia Qing’s reminder, he also remembered that among the Chinese medicinal herbs he had hoarded in the past, there seemed to be an herb called thorny vine root.

However, this was just an ordinary herb, just this thorn vine root alone could make the Mirage beast come out obediently? Xia ruofei felt that it was a little unreliable.

Xia Qing smiled and said,”master, it’s not to lure them out, but to force them out.” Magical beasts hate the smoke from burning the thorny vines. If you light the thorny vines and let the smoke enter the cave, it definitely won’t be able to stand it. ”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,””There’s no other way anyway, so this is the only way. I hope there’s no other exit!”

With that, Xia ruofei poured out all the thorny vines from the bag and piled them up at the small hole. Then, he lit them up with the Zippo lighter.

The thorny vine roots were extremely dry, and they almost caught fire.

These intertwined wild vines quickly produced smoke after burning. Xia ruofei sniffed it and didn’t feel any difference from the smoke from ordinary firewood.

However, he was still very confident in Xia Qing’s judgment, so he didn’t care too much. He directly added a true energy shield on top of the pile of burning Bramble roots, not letting a trace of smoke leak out. Then, he used his true energy to force all the smoke into the cave.

“Master, be careful of it escaping, the speed of a magical beast is still very fast.” Xia Qing reminded.

“Understood!” Xia ruofei grinned.

After the illusory formation lost its effect, Xia ruofei felt that the suppression of his spiritual power was not as strong as before. Hence, after he was forced into the smoke, he had already released his spiritual power and was fully focused on the situation in the cave.

In less than a minute, Xia ruofei felt some movement in the cave. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

His spirit was roused, and he focused his energy to guard the entrance of the cave. As long as the Mirage beast dared to come out, he would make it a one – way trip!

Suddenly, Xia ruofei felt his vision blur and a yellow shadow jumped out of the hole.

He subconsciously reached out and accurately grabbed the rear leg of the magical beast. Then without thinking, he swung the magical beast and heavily smashed it to the ground.

With a muffled sound, the Mirage beast was thrown to the ground by Xia ruofei.

“Master! Use that hidden weapon of yours!” Xia Qing said,”the Mirage beast’s skin is rough and its flesh is thick. We can’t hurt it like this!”

As expected, before Xia ruofei could finish his sentence, the Mirage beast had already rolled up from the ground.

Xia ruofei did not hesitate to take out a pistol from the spirit map space.

Xia ruofei’s movements were as smooth as floating clouds and flowing water. After a second, the bullet was accurately shot at the magical beast.

The magical beast ran forward quickly while changing its trajectory left and right, hoping to avoid Xia ruofei’s “hidden weapon.”

Unfortunately, it was no longer able to set up an illusion array after it was injured. Besides, Xia ruofei’s spiritual power was not suppressed by the array. Under the cover of his spiritual power, its movement trajectory could not be hidden.

Even though it was only a second and the Beast had already disappeared into the darkness, Xia ruofei could still “see” its figure clearly with the help of his spiritual power.

His bullets chased after the Mirage beast, and soon a bullet hit the leg of the Mirage beast, causing its speed to drop by a large amount.

Xia ruofei struck while the iron was hot. He did not hold back on his bullets at all as he fired at the mythical beast.

“Master, don’t hit the head!” Xia Qing reminded him again with some urgency.

Xia ruofei’s gun slightly lowered. The bullet that was supposed to hit the beast’s head went straight into the beast’s neck.

This shot was fatal, after the Mirage beast’s legs kicked a few times, it died in a pool of blue blood.

“You ambushed me and still want to run?” Xia ruofei mumbled to himself as he carefully approached the mythical beast with his gun.

At the same time, his mind power had almost enveloped the magical beast. If the magical beast was faking its death or had other conspiracies, it would be hard to escape Xia ruofei’s detection.

The Mirage beast was really dead.

Xia ruofei came closer and realized that the magical beast was not moving. He stretched out his leg and kicked it a few times but there was no movement.

Only then did Xia ruofei relax, but he was still holding the gun tightly.

“Master, the beast is already dead.” Xia Qing said,”there’s a tuft of hair under its neck, and it has now turned completely white. This means that its life force has completely dissipated.”

Xia ruofei observed for a while and found a tuft of white fur under the neck of the magical beast. This magical beast was yellow in color.

Xia ruofei felt that it was quite fresh, but he knew that Xia Qing would not lie to him, so he was completely at ease.

This was the most dangerous time for Xia ruofei since he got the spirit map. Especially when the magical beast changed into Song Wei’s appearance, Xia ruofei almost fell for it.

That was why he hated the magical beast to the bone. Now that he had finally destroyed the magical beast with his own hands, he felt quite relieved.

Now that he had killed the Mirage beast, Xia ruofei was ready to go and find Song Wei. In this underground Palace where danger lurked everywhere, Song Wei, who had no cultivation at all, was definitely in a very dangerous situation. Xia ruofei was also very anxious at this moment.

However, just as Xia ruofei was about to leave, Xia Qing said,””Master, don’t be in such a hurry to leave, the magical beast’s treasures haven’t been taken yet!”
