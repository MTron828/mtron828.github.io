“Hehe, there are people who don’t love money?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

“A gentleman loves money and takes it in the right way, okay ...” Feng Rao rolled her eyes.

“Isn’t it right for me to give you money?” Xia ruofei widened his eyes and asked,”I’m not your sugar daddy ...”

Feng Jing’s face turned red. Xia ruofei felt that his joke was a little ambiguous, so he quickly changed the topic.”Sister ran, let’s continue talking about work! Other than the news conference of the heart nourishing soup, what else is there?”

Feng Rao glanced at Xia ruofei with her watery eyes before she continued,””There’s still the company’s Annual Meeting. ”

Xia ruofei first handed the tea to Feng Jing, then sat up straight and said,””The annual party is more important, so we have to do it well!”

This was the first time that paradise Corporation had organized a formal Annual Meeting. Now that the number of employees had reached several hundred, and the company was getting bigger and bigger, this first annual meeting must be done well.

“I’ve already entrusted the details to a company that specializes in the ceremony,” Feng Jing said.”There are two problems we need to settle first. One is the time, and the second is the location.”

Feng Rao paused and took a sip of tea before continuing,””Ruofei, I suggest we do it after New Year’s Day and before the Spring Festival. After all, most people think that New Year’s Day is the last day of the year, and New Year’s Day is obviously not as significant as the Spring Festival.”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”sure. Many companies in China treat the Lunar New Year as the end of a year. Why don’t we do it on the eve of the Lunar New Year?” Let’s have a good time with the whole company. ”

“Alright!” Feng Jing jotted it down as she said,”it’s the holidays for the new year. We can’t delay the annual meeting so late. Many employees still have to return home for the new year!” It’s not bad for everyone to spend the new year together! But I don’t know if it’ll be easy to book a hotel ...”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Ask the administrative department to make the reservation as soon as possible. Let me know if they can’t make it. We’ll hold the annual meeting at the Ling Ji restaurant.”

Feng Rao looked at Xia ruofei with a half – Smile and said,””I almost forgot that your girlfriend’s family owns a hotel. I was worried for nothing ...”

“Then there shouldn’t be a problem with the location,” Feng Jing continued.”At least there’s the lingji restaurant as an alternative.”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”of course, it’s not that I don’t like Qingxue’s restaurant.” But if you can book a better hotel, and in a hotel at that, you don’t have to worry about the money. Everyone has worked hard for a year, and we can’t save the money that should be spent!”

After all, Ling’s restaurant was still a restaurant for the common people. The food was very authentic, but objectively speaking, the environment was definitely not as good as a star hotel. The quality of Ling’s private kitchen was higher, but the place was so small that it could not accommodate hundreds of employees.

The best place would naturally be the grand banquet hall of a star hotel.

“Alright!” Feng Jing nodded and said,”since the time has been set, I’ll get the administrative department to follow up on this.”

“Mm! Also, other than not saving money for the hotel, we should also give out better prizes for the annual meeting so that we can have a wider coverage. ” Xia ruofei said,”get the administration to come up with a proposal. I want to approve it personally!”

“Understood!” Feng Jing said,”there’s one more thing ...”

Xia ruofei forced a smile and said,”why isn’t it over yet?” Can’t we have some tea together?”

“One last thing!” Feng Rao said helplessly.

I’ve never seen such a lazy boss! Feng Jing thought to herself.

“Alright, alright!” Xia ruofei said listlessly,”hurry up and tell me. I’ll go home and take a nap after you’re done. I’m so sleepy after driving for hours ...”

“I thought our company’s management still hasn’t been fully equipped?” Feng Jing said,”actually, I’ve been asking a headhunting company to help me look for someone. I really did find something this time ...”

“Oh?” Xia ruofei also became more spirited and said,”tell me!”
