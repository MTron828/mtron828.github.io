Chapter 1756: Reunion after a short separation (1)

“Our family?” Ling Qingxue was stunned.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”yes!” I bought this courtyard house in Beijing, but you haven’t been there yet! Now, its mistress has finally arrived ...”

Ling Qingxue’s face heated up, but she was overjoyed. She bit her lower lip and glanced at Xia ruofei with her watery eyes.”Do you have a mistress in your house?”

“I don’t have a mistress in a Golden House, but I can finally hide her tonight!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“You’re so annoying!” Ling Qingxue pinched Xia ruofei as she blushed.

“Let’s go!” Xia ruofei put the car into gear and started the car.

In the end, the two of them did not eat the roasted duck at the cheap place. Ling Qingxue wanted to quickly see the courtyard house that Xia ruofei had mentioned to her several times. She also wanted to cook a meal for herself so that it would feel more like a home.

So, the two went to Walmart, bought some groceries at the supermarket, and then drove back to the liuhai Lane courtyard house.

As it was Ling Qingxue’s first time visiting the house, Xia ruofei did not walk from the backyard with the garage. Instead, he drove directly from the liuhai Lane to the entrance of the restaurant. There were two parking spaces in the front yard, but there was no garage.

The car stopped at the entrance. Xia ruofei pressed the remote control and the side door beside the main entrance for cars to enter and exit slowly opened.

Ling Qingxue sat in the car and couldn’t help but say,””Ruofei, this gate is so Grand!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”in the Qing Dynasty, only the Duke of Baylor could build such a door. If the rank wasn’t high enough, it would be a violation of the system. That’s a felony!” I was just lucky. The owner of this house had already migrated, and my business abroad was in urgent need of money, so I bought it at a cheap price. ”

“The value has risen quite a bit now, right?” Ling Qingxue asked with a smile.

“If I sell it now, I should be able to earn twenty to thirty million!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”but I’m not selling it! In the capital, such a detached courtyard house with three courtyards is a rare resource. You can’t buy it even if you have money!”

As he spoke, he turned the steering wheel and drove into the courtyard house.

The Land Rover reversed slowly into the parking space. Xia ruofei pulled the handbrake and turned off the engine. Then, he smiled and said,””We’re here! Qingxue, this is our home in the capital! How was it? Why don’t you get off the car and take a look?”

Ling Qingxue nodded her head.

The two of them got out of the car. Xia ruofei opened the trunk and took out the groceries he had bought at Walmart.

At this time, Wu Qiang, who lived in the backyard, also came to the front yard. His house had the Security Control System of the entire siheyuan. He was the first to know that the door of the front yard had been opened, so he came to check the situation.

Xia ruofei smiled and greeted,”Wu Qiang, come, come!” Let me introduce you, this is my girlfriend, Ling Qingxue!”

Then, Xia ruofei said to Ling Qingxue,””Qingxue, Wu Qiang is usually in charge of the security of the entire courtyard house. At the same time, he also serves as a driver, bodyguard, chef, and cleaner ...”

Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but laugh. She glanced at Xia ruofei and said,””You’re squeezing labor! Mmmm! It’s just like your usual style!”

Ling Qingxue then walked up to Wu Qiang and said,””Brother Wu, how are you?”

“I don’t deserve it!” Wu Qiang quickly replied. I don’t dare! Hello, miss Ling!”

Wu Qiang knew that Xia ruofei was going to the airport today to pick up his official girlfriend, so he was also very clear that this person in front of him was the mistress of the siheyuan. Thus, he was more or less a little reserved.

Xia ruofei could tell as well. He passed the bag in his hand to Wu Qiang and said with a smile,”You don’t have to worry about this. Help us put these vegetables in the kitchen refrigerator! But you don’t have to deal with it, we’ll cook our own food later!”

“Alright, director Xia!” Wu Qiang said.

“By the way, you haven’t eaten either, have you?” Xia ruofei asked.

“I’ve already eaten, chief Xia!”Wu Qiang quickly replied. I didn’t know what time you’d be back, so I went to the Hutong noodle shop to eat!”

In fact, Wu Qiang had not eaten. It was just that the young couple had reunited after a long time and would have to cook for themselves later. Of course, he could not be the third wheel. Anyway, there were still a few cups of instant noodles in the house. He would just make do with the dinner.

Xia ruofei didn’t think too much about it. He smiled and said,””Alright, then you can put the things in the kitchen and go rest! We’ll handle it ourselves!”

“Alright!” Wu Qiang replied,”director Xia, I’ll go over first!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. Then, he brought Ling Qingxue on a tour of the siheyuan. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Pomegranate trees, Lotus pots, lilacs, grape trells...Ling Qingxue wandered around the courtyard house that was filled with the rich atmosphere of the capital. She was in a very good mood.

Especially when Xia ruofei brought her to the basement. When she saw the recording room that was comparable to the VIP hall of a movie theater, she couldn’t help but cheer. If it wasn’t for the fact that she had to cook dinner with Xia ruofei, she would have immediately acted in a blockbuster movie.

In fact, Ling Qingxue loved to watch movies. It was just that she was always busy with work and rarely watched movies with Xia ruofei.

The two of them started from the first place they entered the courtyard and walked all the way to the backyard.

This place was mainly used by the staff. There was a small courtyard, two garages, kitchen, dining room, laundry room, servants ‘room, and so on. Wu Qiang had also connected the central security control of the courtyard to this place. The terminal was in his room.
