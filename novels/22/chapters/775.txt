Chapter 776: Heading straight for the target_2

After Xia ruofei entered the room, he said to Guo Zhan,””Wolf King, my farm is nearby. After the mission is over, let’s take a look!”

“Alright!” Guo Zhan said with a smile. Some of the soldiers I’ve trained became police officers, some became private bodyguards for their bosses, and some even started their own security companies. But you’re the first one to have such a big business! I have to go and study hard, maybe it will be useful when I change my profession in the future!”

Xia ruofei rolled his eyes and scoffed at the commander of the elite special Forces. If he dared to mention it, the military chief would kick his butt.

Before Xia ruofei retired from the Army, Guo Zhan was already a Reserve Officer for the Deputy Division Master position. In other words, he could be promoted to the Deputy Division Master position at any time.

Xia ruofei didn’t respond to Guo Zhan’s teasing. He just smiled and said,””Captain, I haven’t been back for two days. I want to go back to the farm in the afternoon to deal with some chores. I’ll come back in the evening to meet you, okay?”

Guo Zhan looked at Xia ruofei suspiciously and said,””You’re not thinking of acting on your own, are you? I’m telling you, those shorties have a lot of light weapons in their hands. It’s very dangerous, so don’t play with fire!”

Xia ruofei quickly said,”Wolf King, why would I act on my own?” There wasn’t even a single clue! Even if I want to fight them to the death, I have to know where they are, right? I’m really just going back to the farm!”

“Are you really just going back to the farm?”

“Really, really!”

“Alright! I’ll get Xiao Ling to bring you the car keys. ” Guo Zhan said,”you can drive our car back!”

Guo Zhan picked up the landline in the room after he finished speaking. He still remembered that Xia ruofei’s car was left at the Public Security Bureau.

Xia ruofei quickly said,”no need, no need. My farm isn’t far from here. I’ll just go downstairs and call a taxi.” Xiao Ling and the others might be asleep already, so don’t disturb them from resting! There’s a mission tonight!”

“Alright then, be careful!” Guo Zhan said.

......

He had been on high alert for the past two days and felt a little tired. After he finished speaking, he waved his hand to signal Xia ruofei to leave. Then, he lay on the bed and prepared to sleep for a while.

Xia ruofei gave Blackie a look, and the two of them quietly left the room.

Of course, Xia ruofei did not really want to go back to the farm. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

The company was operating normally and Feng Jing and the others were doing their best. It didn’t matter if he left for a few days. If he went back now, he would have to come out again in the evening. Wouldn’t he be torturing himself?

After Xia ruofei left the business hotel, he walked to a small hotel nearby and got a room.

After entering the room, he checked the room out of habit. After confirming that there was no equipment to secretly take photos, he immediately locked the doors and windows.

After saying a few words to Xiao hei, he took out the spirit map scroll and entered the space with a thought.

With Blackie’s protection outside, Xia ruofei was not worried that someone would suddenly break in.

After he made some preparations in the medium, he immediately came out to put away the spirit map scroll and left the hotel with Blackie.

When they were on the streets, Xia ruofei called for a taxi.

He carried Blackie into the car and said,””Master, let’s go to the entrance of Xiayang village in Lin Gang Town,”

The blue Buick minivan had gone missing after passing through the last Skynet surveillance camera on National Highway 218.

The surveillance camera was not far from Xiayang village in the direction of the city. It was a police security camera. In recent years, the police had installed a lot of such security cameras on the road in the urban – rural junction, making the nodes of the Skynet system more complete.

It was about two kilometers away from the next security camera.

In other words, the blue Buick minivan could only have left the National Highway at one of the intersections within these two kilometers.

There were a total of six intersections within this two – kilometer area. Three of them had been eliminated because there were surveillance cameras installed in the village less than 300 meters ahead, which were also connected to the police Skynet system.

Hence, Xia ruofei only needed to check the remaining three intersections.

The closest surveillance camera to the disappearance of the Buick was at the intersection of Xia Yang village.

Xia ruofei decided to start his investigation from here.

Soon, the taxi arrived at the intersection. The driver asked,””It’s still five li from here to the village! You really don’t need me to send you in?”

Xia ruofei smiled.”It’s okay. Just park here.”

After the car stopped, Xia ruofei took out a hundred Yuan note and handed it to the driver.””Keep the change. You won’t be able to get any work back to the county this time, so you must return empty – handed. Consider it as compensation for your loss!”

“Thank you, thank you!” The driver said happily. Take care!”

For this trip, it would only cost 30 to 40 yuan on the watch. It would not cost more than 60 Yuan to book a car. Xia ruofei gave him 100 yuan at once, so he was naturally overjoyed.

The car turned around at the intersection and returned to the county. Xia ruofei brought Blackie for a walk in the direction of Xiangyang village.

Actually, Xia ruofei had chosen to start the investigation from the intersection at Xia Yang village, not only because it was the closest intersection to the last surveillance camera.

They had analyzed it in the command center of the Public Security Bureau. There were a few places that were the most suspicious and needed to be investigated.

One of them was an abandoned brick factory near Xiayang village. From this intersection, about a kilometer in the direction of Xiayang village, there was a mechanical road that led directly to the brick factory. There were many dilapidated factories in the brick factory, so it was easy to hide a business car.
