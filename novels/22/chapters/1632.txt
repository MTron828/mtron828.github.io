Chapter 1633: Midnight operation (2)

Song Rui and Zhao Yongjun sat in two seats in the middle row, and Zhao Yongjun’s seat was behind the driver’s seat.

Xia ruofei turned to Zhao Yongjun and asked with a smile,””Brother Zhao, how was your rest?”

“I’m fine,” Zhao Yongjun said with a smile,”but Xiao Rui keeps causing some trouble next door, so I can’t really sleep ...”

Xia ruofei’s eyes widened. He turned around and asked song Rui,””Did you have an intimate encounter with fifth young lady in my room?”

“Go to hell!” Song Rui flew into a rage out of humiliation. Do I need fifth young lady? I can hook my finger and countless beautiful women will throw themselves into my arms, okay?”

Xia ruofei chuckled,”yes, yes!” But I just can’t get Zhuo Yiyi ...”

“Then I’ve also seen countless women in the past, okay?” Song Rui’s face froze and he said unhappily.

“You can’t handle Zhuo Yiyi!” Xia ruofei was calm.

“Can you not mention Zhuo Yiyi?” Song Rui was angry and anxious.

“Sure!” Xia ruofei quickly said,”you said it yourself! Don’t ever mention Zhuo Yiyi in front of me again!”

Song Rui had been repeatedly defeated in his pursuit of Zhuo Yiyi. He often called Xia ruofei to complain, ask for advice, or ask Xia ruofei to ask Song Wei for help. In short, Xia ruofei’s ears were getting calluses.

Song Rui smiled awkwardly and said,””Let’s not talk about this anymore ...”

“Tsk ...” Xia ruofei raised his hand in disdain and turned around.

Along the way, Wu Qiang drove the car quietly and smoothly according to the navigation route that he had set before departure.

In the second half of the night, the roads in the capital were naturally smooth. Even Zhao Yongjun sighed, saying that it had been a long time since he had seen an empty road.

It was for this reason that the one – hour drive during the day was cut in half, and they arrived at the place in about 40 minutes.

It was still a piece of barren land, and Liu haofan and Tang real estate had just bought it two days ago. Naturally, there was no one to guard the place because there was nothing to guard. There was nothing here, and no one could steal an entire piece of land, right?

Although this place was far from the main road and there would be almost no people or cars passing by in the middle of the night, Xia ruofei was still very cautious. He instructed Wu Qiang to drive the car to a place with higher grass to hide. This way, even if someone passed by here, it would be almost impossible to notice the car in such poor visibility.

The four of them alighted from the car and Xia ruofei directed everyone to unload the supplies from the car.

Song Rui asked,”ruofei, what are we going to do next?” When do we start?”

Xia ruofei said unhappily,”what method?” I’m not a Daoist priest!”

Then, Xia ruofei quickly assigned the tasks.””Brother Zhao, you and song Rui will stay here to guard the supplies. Wu Qiang will go with me to work! You guys stay hidden ...”

“Other than the few of us, who else would come to this godforsaken place in the middle of the night?” song Rui muttered.

“There’s no harm in being careful!”Zhao Yongjun said. RUO Fei, don’t worry about us!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes!” I’ll leave you a walkie – talkie, so we can contact each other if anything happens!”

“Alright!”

Xia ruofei nodded at Zhao Yongjun and said,””Wu Qiang, grab the shovel and follow me!”

“Okay, boss!” “Yes,” Wu Qiang replied. He found two shovels from the pile of supplies and quickly followed Xia ruofei.

It was a dark and windy night, and there was basically no moonlight. Although it wasn’t so dark that one couldn’t see their own fingers, the visibility was very low.

However, Xia ruofei had already explored the place and had the advantage of his mental strength. The darkness did not affect him at all.

He led the way with ease, and Wu Qiang followed closely behind him.

Xia ruofei stopped after walking for about 50 meters.

He looked around and used his mental power to check again. After confirming that there was no mistake, he took a shovel from Wu Qiang and drew a circle on the ground.

“Wu Qiang, dig a pit here. It’s a cylindrical shape with a diameter of 20 cm and a depth of 60 cm!” Xia ruofei said to Wu Qiang in a concise manner.

“Yes, boss!” Wu Qiang replied.

He rubbed his hands, picked up the shovel, and began to work.

They had all received training in the Army to dig fodders ‘pits, so this was naturally a piece of cake for him.

Xia ruofei picked up another shovel and said,””I’ll go to the next location. Contact me through the walkie – talkie after you’re done!”

“Understood!” Wu Qiang replied without even lifting his head as he dug.

He did not know why Xia ruofei had come here, but since it was his boss’s order, he would do his best. Furthermore, he had to keep his mouth shut after he left. Otherwise, how could he live up to the high salary his boss had given him?

Xia ruofei didn’t waste any time. He carried his shovel and walked in another direction.

A few minutes later, he arrived at the next location. After confirming the exact location, he began to work.

This was a simple task for Xia ruofei. He didn’t even need to use his true energy. His digging speed was even faster than Wu Qiang ‘s.

After a short while, a perfect round hole appeared in front of Xia ruofei.

At this time, Wu Qiang’s voice came from the walkie – talkie,””Boss, I’m done here!”

Xia ruofei picked up the walkie – talkie and said,””Head towards the Northwest, I’ll come over to meet you!”

“Understood!”

Xia ruofei picked up the shovel and walked over to help Wu Qiang.

Just like that, after about an hour, Xia ruofei and Wu Qiang had dug out nine holes in nine different directions.

Among them, Xia ruofei had five and Wu Qiang had four.

And this was under the circumstance that he had to lead the way for Wu Qiang and point out the excavation site. It was clear that his efficiency was much faster than Wu Qiang ‘s.

After that, Xia ruofei brought Wu Qiang back to where they parked their car.

When he got to the back of the car, Xia ruofei was elated. Song Rui and Zhao Yongjun must have been bored waiting, so they had arranged the supplies neatly. Even the spikes were erected like soldiers being inspected. The five Emperor coins were also arranged in a straight line.

“You’re finally back ...” Song Rui said as soon as he saw Xia ruofei.”If you had delayed any longer, I would have gone back to the car and taken a nap ...”

Xia ruofei chuckled,”who asked you to stay up all night?” You’re sleepy now? You deserve it!”

“I’m not sleepy!” Song Rui said,”isn’t this too boring? I say, ruofei, can’t we be more efficient?”

Xia ruofei said,”alright!” If it were you, you wouldn’t be able to finish it even by dawn, not to mention an hour. I’m letting you rest, but you’re still complaining. Then you should work more later!”

“No problem!” Song Rui said,”the thought of making Liu er feel uncomfortable makes me full of energy!”

“You said it yourself!” Xia ruofei said,”don’t say you’re tired later!” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

With that, Xia ruofei walked over and picked out nine Chinese scholar trees. He measured them carefully, took out a military dagger, and trimmed them before putting them aside.

Then, he went over and picked out another 63 children’s nails. He carried them in a bag and came to the locust tree.

Xia ruofei used his finger to measure the locust tree. After finding a spot, he picked up a nail and pressed it on the spot, gently exerting force.

Xia ruofei had used some of his true energy. He did not want to look for a hammer in the car in the middle of the night. Besides, if he really wanted to hit a nail, the sound would travel far in the silent night.

It was much more convenient to use genuine Qi. The locust tree wood was like tofu. Xia ruofei pressed it lightly and the nail easily pierced into the wood.

Xia ruofei’s movements were very fast. He quickly measured with his finger and found the next position. He grabbed a nail and pressed it in.

In a short while, he had already nailed seven descendent nails onto the locust tree.

Zhao Yongjun and the other two saw this scene under the faint flashlight. They were all stunned. Song Rui couldn’t help but pick up a nail and point it at a locust tree. Then, he followed suit and pressed it down ...
