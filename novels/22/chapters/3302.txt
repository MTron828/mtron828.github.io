3303 Record – breaking (2)

Just as the puppet dodged, the two flying swords drew an arc and changed their direction of attack, heading toward his next move.

Although the puppet tried its best to Dodge, it still couldn’t completely Dodge. It felt a cold sensation in its leg and looked down to find that its left leg had been cut off from the knee by the flying sword of qushuang.

Xia ruofei’s eyes were filled with killing intent. He lunged forward and kicked the puppet’s head.

This was a sure – kill move, and the puppet was no longer able to Dodge.

However, after Xia ruofei dodged his first attack, the puppet with braids immediately attacked Xia ruofei again. At this time, it was already behind Xia ruofei.

The puppet couldn’t save its companion in time, so it could only use this method to make Xia ruofei give up on attacking.

Xia ruofei knew that it would be very difficult to get rid of all three puppets in half a minute. Now was his best chance. If he missed it, he would have to run away and it would be impossible for him to break the record.

In a split second, he gritted his teeth and twisted his waist, using all his strength to avoid the attack from behind. However, his leg’s momentum did not decrease, and it kicked toward the puppet’s head with a whistling sound.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

The first sound was the sound of Xia ruofei kicking a puppet. Without any suspense, the puppet fell to the ground and was as dead as dead could be.

The second sound was the sound of the iron rod hitting Xia ruofei’s body.

Although he tried his best to avoid it, in order to maintain his center of gravity and make sure that the whip kick would not deviate, his range of dodging was very limited. In the end, he was still hit in the shoulder by one of the iron rods.

Xia ruofei had actually gathered all his vital Qi on his shoulder and back to defend himself. However, after being hit by the metal rod, he still felt a splitting pain. He suspected that his shoulder blades had been broken.

Xia ruofei felt that it was a good deal to exchange injuries for lives.

Sometimes, he just had this kind of ruthlessness.

After being hit by the iron rod, Xia ruofei did not fall. Instead, he used the force to lean back and came to the front of the last puppet. He turned around and used the inertia to hit his elbow behind him.

The three puppets looked like children. The last puppet with a braid was only a little taller than Xia ruofei’s waist. Hence, Xia ruofei’s elbow hit the puppet’s head directly.

The puppet was also stunned at the critical moment. He thought that Xia ruofei would definitely Dodge. He did not expect Xia ruofei to be so cruel to himself. He would rather take his iron staff head on to kill the puppet.

In that moment of distraction, Xia ruofei’s elbow had already arrived. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

The vital Qi – infused elbow struck the puppet squarely, and with a crack, the puppet’s neck snapped, and its head tilted to one side.

After Xia ruofei killed the last puppet, he immediately endured the pain and jumped onto the bent Frost Flying sword. He then quickly flew away. He could now control the bent Frost Flying sword to fly, and his escape speed was much faster.

97 puppets had been killed, so the number of puppets in the mini town had been reduced by more than half. Xia ruofei found a quiet alley with ease.

He took out the spirit map scroll and hid it before entering the spirit map space.

In order to save time, he directly came to the space of the Archean realm and immediately called Xia Qing.

Xia Qing immediately rushed to the Archean realm. When she saw Xia ruofei clutching his shoulder in pain, Xia Qing was shocked and hurriedly asked,””Master, are you injured?”

Xia ruofei said,”brew me some medicine immediately!” I’ll come in and use it later!”

“Yes!” Xia Qing quickly replied. Master!”

Xia Qing ran to the medicine cabinet to look for medicinal herbs, while Xia ruofei directly took out the preservation box that contained the petals of the spirit Heart Flower. After opening the lid, he used his spiritual power to lift a petal and pressed it directly on his injured shoulder.

A cool feeling spread from the wound to the whole body, and the burning pain disappeared without a trace.

Xia ruofei knew that one petal was definitely not enough. After all, the petal was very useful, and he definitely did not want to waste it. So he decided to use only one petal. Combined with Xia Qing’s medicine, the problem should not be too big.

After Xia ruofei used up a petal of the spirit Heart Flower, he immediately closed the safety box and put it back to its original place. Then, he left the spirit map space.

He didn’t have much time left. He still had to kill three more puppets, so he had to race against time.

As soon as Xia ruofei returned to the first level of the Tower of Trials, he immediately released his spiritual power to cover the entire town. He was surprised to find that there were two solitary puppets in two places. Judging from their auras, they did not seem to be in the nascent Soul Stage.

Xia ruofei didn’t hesitate. He stepped on his flying sword and flew close to the ground, quickly rushing over.

Three minutes later, he had successfully killed the two puppets.

One of the late – Stage golden elixir realm puppets took a bit of effort while the other one was killed by Xia ruofei in a second.

He was only one puppet away from completing the mission.

If he wanted to break the record, Xia ruofei had to finish the last strike as soon as possible.

He continued to release his mental energy to investigate, but the goddess of luck seemed to no longer care for him. After killing the 99th puppet, he did not find any more puppets that were alone.

They always acted in groups of at least three, and each group had a late – Stage golden core puppet.

Xia ruofei could only choose a small group that was closer to the true yang temple. This way, it would be much easier for him to escape. Moreover, there was only one late – Stage golden core puppet in this small group. The remaining two puppets were one at the early stage and one at the intermediate stage.

Xia ruofei’s target was the early golden core puppet.

There wasn’t much time left. Xia ruofei could only choose to end the battle quickly. He didn’t have much time to think.

The moment he appeared, he was discovered by the three puppets. They immediately swarmed and pounced on Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei calmly released the qushuang flying sword and the blue immortal sword, multitasking. On one hand, he controlled the qushuang flying sword and the blue immortal sword to attack the early gold core puppet. On the other hand, he had to use the graceful steps to avoid the other party’s attack.

Although his injured shoulder had mostly recovered, there were still waves of pain which affected Xia ruofei’s performance.

Even when the other two groups of puppets had almost arrived, he was still unable to kill the early gold core puppet.

Xia ruofei gritted his teeth. It seemed like he could only take the risk.

The mission had already progressed to this stage. He was aiming to break the record. Now, he was only one step away. How could he bear to give up?

Therefore, he simply ignored the attacks of the other two puppets and focused on attacking the only early gold core puppet.

This puppet was not as powerful as Xia ruofei, and now that Xia ruofei was taking care of it, it looked even more pathetic.

This early Aurous core stage puppet had the appearance of a young girl and looked very sweet. However, Xia ruofei was not so stupid as to treat a puppet with tender feelings.

Therefore, he finally killed the 100th puppet with a fierce attack and two injuries on his body.

The timer in the perceptual mirror’s field of view had also stopped moving. The time displayed on it had stopped at 1 hour and 55 minutes.

...

When Xia ruofei saw the time, he heaved a sigh of relief. He had hurried and finally broken the record. Even if it was only five minutes higher than the record, it meant that from now on, the best record for the Tower of Trials ‘first level mission would belong to him alone, unless someone amazing broke his record again.

After Xia ruofei killed the early gold core realm puppet, he naturally had no desire to continue fighting. Now that his mission was completed, the only thing he had to do was to go to the second floor as soon as possible.

Since he had decided to leave the first level, Xia ruofei had nothing to worry about. He didn’t even care about the two angry puppets. He stepped onto the bent Frost Flying sword and flew towards the valley behind true yang temple.
