Chapter 1105: The absolute main character (1)

Translator: 549690339

Other than song Rui and Lu You, who were familiar with the relationship between Xia ruofei and elder song, the young people at this table looked as if they had seen a ghost.

The other members of the song family who were sitting at the other tables, including some branch families and some leaders who were close to the song family in the capital, did not notice Xia ruofei who was sitting at the younger generation’s table. Now that elder song had said this, they all looked in the direction of the voice.

Although many people did not know Xia ruofei, they were very familiar with the younger generation at the table. The only person who was unfamiliar to them was Xia ruofei.

In an instant, Xia ruofei had become the center of attention.

At this time, a dignified middle – aged leader beside elder song also smiled and said,””Little Xia, what are you doing? The chief asked you to come over and sit!”

Liu Jian, who was sitting opposite Xia ruofei, could not help but gasp.

This was because the leader who spoke was none other than Liu Jian’s father, Liu Xiangbin. He was the executive Vice Minister of a certain Ministry. He was also qualified to talk to elder song in the central room in the backyard.

Liu Xiangbin had already seen Xia ruofei’s position in elder song’s heart from the backyard, so he naturally invited Xia ruofei.

However, his intimate words to Xia ruofei made Liu Jian’s heart tremble.

The rich kids at Xia ruofei’s table all looked at Liu Jian with strange expressions.

Even though Xia ruofei was very calm, he still felt a little uncomfortable under so many people’s gazes. He smiled bitterly to himself and stood up.””Chief, I’m fine here, but I don’t want to go to your place to join in the fun ...”

After everyone heard Xia ruofei’s words, they felt that it was even more unreal. Elder song had personally invited a young man, and he had actually rejected?

What was even more unbelievable was that elder song didn’t seem to be offended. He just waved his hand and said,”Hahaha! Whatever you want! Xiao Rui, drink a few more glasses for me and Xiao Xia!”

“Yes, Grandpa!” Song Rui replied respectfully.

In front of elder song, the unruly song Rui was a pure and obedient baby. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

At this moment, song Zhengping and Tian Huilan naturally noticed Xia ruofei’s strange seating arrangement. They looked at each other and saw a trace of helplessness in each other’s eyes.

It seemed that the one – sided love of the parents of both parties did not seem to be able to make song Rui and Lu You call. They could only smile bitterly to themselves.

However, the two ministry leaders would not blame Xia ruofei. Firstly, Xia ruofei had a good relationship with song Rui and Lu You, and they knew that. Secondly, song Rui and Lu You did not see eye to eye with each other. This was the main reason. It did not matter much whether Xia ruofei sat in that position or not.

If it was an ordinary wealthy family, the will of the younger generation would not have much effect on this political marriage, but this matter was a bit special.

Lu You’s father had passed away a long time ago, and Tian Huilan had been busy with work most of the time, so she had always felt that she owed her daughter. Although she really hoped to marry into the song family, she couldn’t force Lu You too much if she was strongly against it.

On song Rui’s side, elder song was more assertive in his children’s marriage arrangements. However, for his grandchildren, he was still relatively Democratic, perhaps because of the generational gap. If song Rui firmly disagreed with the marriage, elder song would probably make other considerations. There were many girls from other families of the right age, and they would eventually find someone that song Rui liked.

Of course, they did not know that song Rui had taken a fancy to Song Wei’s classmate, Zhuo Yiyi, who came from an ordinary family. Otherwise, they would have tried to stop him. Democracy was always relative. Marriage in a rich family should be based on a match between families of equal social status.

“Youyou,” said Tian Huilan with a smile,”you should also give RUO Fei some respect on my behalf.”

Lu You’s expression was calm. She nodded slightly and said,””I know ...”

Tian Huilan’s words made the young people at the table even more dumbfounded. They had originally wanted to watch a show and see how Tian Huilan and song Zhengping would react when they discovered the strange seating arrangement of the three. However, they had never thought that this was possible. Tian Huilan was not angry at all, and song Zhengping, who was beside her, was not surprised at all. Instead, he smiled and nodded.

The popinjays felt that their brains were lacking.

They were getting more and more confused about this young man who had suddenly appeared among them. As they got to know him better, the mystery surrounding Xia ruofei became thicker and thicker.

However, there was no doubt that Xia ruofei was not on the same level as them. Previously, they had thought that it was hard for Xia ruofei to be on the same level as them. Now, it was completely reversed. It turned out that Xia ruofei was really not on the same level as them. He was directly on the same level as their parents ...

Director Zhang of the central office saw this scene. Although he didn’t know Xia ruofei’s identity, elder song’s obvious attitude made him pay more attention to Xia ruofei. At the same time, he decided to go back and find out more about Xia ruofei’s situation. After all, a young man who could be so valued by elder song must be extraordinary.
