Xia ruofei was talking to Lin Qiao in a low voice when tan Lili’s voice came from the side,””Lin Qiao!”

The two turned around and saw Zheng Peng and tan Lili walking over with wine glasses in their hands.

Zheng Peng avoided Xia ruofei’s eyes but quickly regained his composure.

When he saw Lin Qiao, who was dressed in a white gown and looked like a flower Fairy, a trace of burning desire flashed in his eyes.

Xia ruofei frowned slightly. Zheng Peng’s burning gaze disappeared in a flash, but how could Xia ruofei not notice?

In fact, Xia ruofei’s five senses were now very sharp. He had already noticed Zheng Peng and tan Lili not long after he entered the banquet hall. However, he had never thought of paying attention to them. He did not expect them to take the initiative to approach him.

One shouldn’t hit a smiling person. Seeing tan Lili sitting down on the side sofa with a smile, Lin Qiao forced a smile and greeted them. Xia ruofei, on the other hand, nodded slightly.

Zheng Peng was sure that Xia ruofei would not dare to be violent in this situation. The trace of timidity disappeared without a trace.

Zheng Peng held his glass and showed a smile that he thought was very charming. He asked,””Little Xia, I didn’t expect to meet you here again! Tonight’s party is for the Mei ya group to entertain the regional suppliers of Hunter Valley. Do you have a business in Hunter Valley too?”

Xia ruofei glanced at Zheng Peng and said,””I bought a winery recently. Do you have any advice for me, President Zheng?”

Xia ruofei’s casual tone was the same as Zheng Peng’s in the Hunter Valley’s garden in the afternoon. Zheng Peng’s face froze.

Then, he pretended to be very interested and quickly asked,””Oh, really? It seems that we are still of the same profession! My family’s Wilkinson winery is one of the top wineries in the Hunter Valley region! Maybe we’ll have the opportunity to work together in the future! Oh right, I almost forgot to ask. Which winery did you buy, little Xia? There are hundreds of wineries in Hunter Valley, I’ve heard of them all. ”

“Have you heard of West Winery, President Zheng?” Xia ruofei asked indifferently.

“West Winery?” Zheng Peng deliberately looked like he was deep in thought. He pondered for a while and said,”I seem to have some impression. As far as I know, this should be a small winery, right? But little Xia, you’re so young and you already have a winery in Australia. It’s not bad!”

Zheng Peng’s tone was like that of an old man, as if his family’s Wilkinson winery was superior to others. He did not consider that Wilkinson winery was his father’s business and he was just a rich second generation, while Xia ruofei had bought a winery with his own ability.

Xia ruofei’s lips curved up slightly, but he did not respond to Zheng Peng.

At his level, he disdained to compete with Zheng Peng for the limelight. In his opinion, it was a very childish move.

Zheng Peng felt very proud and said in a guiding tone,””Xia, it’s not easy to do wine business in Australia these days! Especially for a small winery like yours, your brand awareness is not high, your production capacity is limited, and your distribution channels are strong. It should be difficult for you to survive, right? I’ll go back and tell my father to take care of you in the business! After all, we’re all Chinese!”

After Zheng Peng finished speaking, he couldn’t help but glance at Lin Qiao. He felt that his image had become much taller, as if he was saying,”Don’t think that your boyfriend looks rich, he’s still far from me!

Lin Qiao ignored Zheng Peng and held Xia ruofei’s arm tightly from the beginning to the end. She seemed to be focused on Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei smiled noncommittally and said to Lin Qiao,””Qiao’ er, are you hungry? Do you want me to get you something to eat?”

Lin Qiao slightly raised her head and smiled,”Alright! Let’s go together!”

Zheng Peng saw that the two of them ignored him and even completely ignored his existence. He couldn’t help but be a little angry, and his eyes revealed a bit of resentment.

At this moment, a voice rang out,””Beautiful Eastern lady, may I have the honor of being your friend?”

Tan Lili’s eyes lit up but quickly dimmed as she saw a tall and handsome white man looking at Lin Qiao with a smile.

Before Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao could say anything, Zheng Peng looked surprised and shouted,””Mr. Brodie! Hello, hello!”

Brodie, who was recognized by Zheng Peng, was about 27 or 28 years old. He had a handsome appearance and a head of blond hair. He was wearing a navy blue Kiton custom – made suit that fit him very well, which complemented his tall figure and Noble temperament.

Brodie looked at Zheng Peng, clearly not recognizing him. In the eyes of Westerners, all Easterners looked the same, except for beautiful women.

“Mr. Brody, I’m Zheng Peng from Wilkinson winery!” Zheng Peng quickly introduced himself. Zheng Daming is my father. We had a meal together two days ago ...”

Brodie finally revealed a look of realization, and said with a reserved expression,””Oh ... So you’re Mr. Zheng’s son.”

“Yup! Hello, Mr. Brody!” Zheng Peng suddenly felt very proud, and quickly nodded and bowed to greet him.

Brodie’s attitude was neither warm nor cold. He told him that his attention was mainly focused on Lin Qiao.

Brodie quickly asked,”Zheng, is this beautiful lady your Chinese friend?” Can you introduce me to them?”

Zheng Peng nodded repeatedly. Even a fool could see that Brodie was very interested in Lin Qiao. Zheng Peng had also been interested in Lin Qiao, but now he didn’t even dare to think about it.

“Of course, of course!” He quickly replied. Mr. Brody, please allow me to introduce you. This is Ms. Lin Qiao. She’s my girlfriend’s classmate!”

Zheng Peng’s eyes swept over Xia ruofei and ignored him. He felt a trace of pleasure in his heart. Although he couldn’t have Lin Qiao, he was happy to see Brodie try to get her. This kind of mentality was a bit perverted.

“Lin Qiao, this is Mr. Brody from the Golden Oak winery. His father is the owner of the winery, Mr. Robinson!” Zheng Peng immediately said to Lin Qiao. The Golden Oak winery is the largest winery in the entire Hunter Valley area. It sells up to 300000 boxes of wine every year. It’s not something a small winery like West can compare to. ”

Zheng Peng’s words were full of praise for Brodie. On one hand, the Golden Oak winery was indeed the number one winery in the Hunter Valley area. On the other hand, Brodie was not like him, who only knew how to eat, drink, and have fun. After graduating from university, Brodie had slowly taken over the winery’s business. Now, Brodie was in charge of many important businesses.

Of course, no matter how powerful Brodie was, Zheng Peng wouldn’t fawn on him like this. There was a more important reason, which was that their Wilkinson winery was looking to cooperate with Brodie winery. Both sides shared channels and technology. For this, Zheng Peng’s father, Zheng Daming, had made a lot of efforts, and was even willing to pay a certain amount of shares as the price.

Once he could climb up the Golden Oak winery’s tree, the Wilkinson winery’s business would definitely take a few steps up.

Therefore, in Zheng Peng’s eyes, Brodie was like his God of Fortune, and he couldn’t wait to worship him.

In order to show his respect for Brody, Zheng Peng introduced him to Lin Qiao in English.

When Brody heard the name ‘West’, he couldn’t help but frown and ask,””West Winery? Are their people here too?”

A few days ago, his father, Robinson, had bought the West Winery. He should have been able to get the winery for a very low price, but he didn’t expect someone to “cut him off.” So when Brodie heard the name of the West Winery, he frowned subconsciously.

Zheng Peng was stunned. He pointed at Xia ruofei and said,””Mr. Brody, Xia said he bought West Winery a few days ago, but I can’t verify whether it’s true or not.”

Brody narrowed his eyes and looked at Xia ruofei. He said indifferently,””It should be true. My father told me that a Chinese man bought West Winery for two million Australian dollars. As far as I know, Old West’s asking price is only 1.8 million Australian dollars. ”

Zheng Peng exclaimed exaggeratedly and looked at Xia ruofei as if he was an idiot. He said,”“why?The other party offered 1.8 million, so why did they end up buying it for two million Australian dollars?”

“It’s indeed incomprehensible,”Brody shrugged and said,” I think ... Only stupid and rich Chinese people would do something so stupid. Oh, Zheng, don’t get me wrong, I’m not talking about you ...”

Although Brodie said this, he was not sincere at all, and his face was filled with disdain. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Zheng Peng, however, said,””Yes, yes, yes ...”

Even tan Lili couldn’t help frowning, but she didn’t dare to say anything when she thought of Brodie’s status.

Xia ruofei said coldly,””Stupid but rich? At least the Chinese know what friendship is. They won’t take advantage of their old acquaintance when he’s in trouble and deliberately lower the price ...”

Brodie’s eyes flashed with anger. He narrowed his eyes at Xia ruofei and said coldly,””Chinese man, you’ve successfully angered me ... I think my father would be happy to suppress your pitifully small West Winery in business. I hope you didn’t put all your money on it, or be prepared to go bankrupt!”

“Australian, although you’re so weak that you can’t anger me, you’re indeed very annoying.” Xia ruofei did not back down and said,”go back and tell your father that the Golden Oak winery will close down because of your stupidity!”

Brodie was stunned for a moment, and then he burst into laughter as if he had heard the funniest joke in the world. He laughed so hard that he couldn’t breathe.

Xia ruofei, on the other hand, looked coldly at Brodie, who was laughing hysterically.

After a long while, Brodie sneered and said,”Stupid Chinese, do you think you’re Ethan? Tang? Do you know how big our Golden Oak winery is? Who gave you the courage to challenge us with your small West Winery?”

At this moment, Liang Qichao’s voice was heard,””What if we add Paradise Farm?”
