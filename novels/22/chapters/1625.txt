Chapter 1626: The bidding begins (2)

Every company that passed the preliminaries and participated in the bidding had five seats. Xia ruofei, Zhao Yongjun, song Rui, Liu Jian, and Xu Zixuan went in, while Hou Liang and Wei Jun went to the hot spring.

The resort’s environment was quite good, and the air in the suburbs was very fresh.

There would be no harm if there was no comparison. They had just come from the foggy downtown of Beijing. As soon as they got out of the car and took a deep breath, they suddenly felt relaxed and happy.

Xia ruofei and the others took the invitation and walked into the building. There was an eye – catching sign in the hall. They went up the side stairs and saw the obvious sign at the entrance of the conference hall.

Xia ruofei and the others walked over. Immediately, a staff member came over to check the invitation. After confirming that there were no mistakes, the staff member said politely,””Please come over and sign it!”

“Big brother Zhao, you go!” Xia ruofei smiled and pointed at the check – in counter not far away.

In order to set up this club, they set up a new company called Heng Rui, and Zhao Yongjun was the legal person of the company. It was only natural that Zhao Yongjun and Xia ruofei had the most shares in the company. Xia ruofei couldn’t be in the capital city all year round, so Zhao Yongjun took the role.

Zhao Yong Jun smiled and nodded,”sure!” Then wait here for a moment!”

After that, he went to check in under the guidance of the staff.

At this moment, a frivolous voice came from behind Xia ruofei and the others.””Song Rui, you really came to join in the fun! You’re quite persistent!”

Song Rui’s expression turned ugly. He was too familiar with this annoying voice. He didn’t need to turn around to know that it was Liu haofan.

“Liu er, you’re such a busybody!” Song Rui said coldly,”when did you have the right to tell me what to do?”

Liu haofan smiled nonchalantly and said,””I wouldn’t dare to give you any advice, young master Song! I’m just giving you a little advice on the account that we’re familiar with each other! I, Liu haofan, have already taken a fancy to this piece of land. If you want to get it, you’d better inspect other places as soon as possible! So as not to drag things out and delay your own matters!”

Song Rui snorted coldly and said,”don’t worry too much!”

“Oh yeah, I forgot to introduce you guys. This is Zhou Tianyu, the Senior Vice President of Tang real estate. He’s also my partner in this project!” Liu haofan said, pouting. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

In fact, song Rui and the others had long known that Liu haofan had joined hands with Tang real estate this time and was determined to get this land. However, seeing that it was true and that Tang real estate had sent a senior vice president to the scene in person, everyone’s face became a bit solemn.

Zhou Tianyu was a chubby middle – aged man who looked like Maitreya.

Although Tang real estate was cooperating with Liu haofan this time, he also didn’t want to offend a top young master like song Rui.

Hence, the moment Liu haofan said that, Zhou Tianyu walked up with a smile and politely handed over his business card, saying,””Young master Song, please take care of me!”

Song Rui took the business card and put it in his pocket. He said lightly,””Chief Zhou, you’re being too serious. With Liu er’s care, aren’t you going to do whatever you want in Beijing? You don’t need me to take care of you, do you?”

“You’re too kind ...” Zhou Tianyu said with a smile,”young master Song and young master Liu are both young talents. I hope that we will have the opportunity to work with young master Song in the future. Although we are here to get this land, I think that business is business. We can’t hurt our relationship ...”

Liu haofan furrowed his brows, but he didn’t say anything.

Firstly, he was a businessman who paid attention to amicability to make money. There was no reason for him to offend a top – notch rich man like song Rui.

Secondly, the project still relied on the financial resources of the Tang real estate company. Liu haofan was not a brainless hothead. Naturally, he could not turn hostile just because Zhou Tianyu softened his stance after speaking to song Rui.

“Then let’s do it based on our own abilities!” Song Rui said lightly.

“That’s right! That’s right!” Zhou Tianyu quickly said.

Then, he took out his name card and gave one to Xia ruofei and the others. He was very enthusiastic.

At this moment, Zhao Yongjun had already finished signing and walked over.

“Brother Zhao is here too ...” Liu haofan said with a fake smile.

Zhao Yongjun smiled.”Haofan, it looks like neither of us wants to back down. Let’s fight then!”

“That’s what I was thinking!” Liu haofan said. Then, he glanced at song Rui with a hint of provocation and said,”young master Song, I hope you don’t admit defeat too early! Otherwise, how boring would that be ...”

With that, Liu haofan walked into the conference hall. From the beginning to the end, he didn’t look at Xia ruofei, Liu Jian, or Xu Zixuan in the eye. In his eyes, only song Rui and Zhao Yongjun could barely be on equal footing with him.

Zhou Tianyu couldn’t help but smile bitterly. He thought to himself that this young master Liu was a little dumb, why did he anger him now? What if they casually raise the price for you? wouldn’t you be spending money for no reason?

However, Zhou Tianyu naturally didn’t dare to express his dissatisfaction to Liu haofan. He could only smile apologetically at Xia ruofei, song Rui, and the rest, then quickly followed.

Zhou Tianyu didn’t know that regardless of whether Liu haofan angered song Rui and the others, they had already made up their minds not to let Liu haofan take over the land so easily.

Song Rui snorted coldly and said,”I just can’t stand this girl’s attitude!” If he didn’t have the support of Tang real estate, would I be afraid of him in terms of financial resources?”

Xia ruofei almost burst out laughing. Besides, they’ve joined forces with Tang real estate, but you can’t afford it yourself. This company was founded by us!

Xia ruofei knew that song Rui was upset, so he didn’t bother to tease him. He just smiled and said,””Let’s go in too!”

Very quickly, Xia ruofei and the rest found the seats that the organizers had arranged for them.

Coincidentally, the seats were right next to Liu haofan’s and Tang real estate ‘s. In fact, the organizers were well aware of the origins of these two groups of people. It was inappropriate for them to stay in either group as they would offend people. Therefore, they simply arranged for them to stay in the first row, with the middle seats occupying half of the seats.

Song Rui snorted and sat in the seat furthest away from Liu haofan and the others. Zhao Yongjun walked over and smiled and nodded at them, then sat down beside Zhou Tianyu.

Xia ruofei and the other two took their seats one by one. Xia ruofei took the seat in the middle of the five.

Liu haofan couldn’t help but take another look at Xia ruofei.

He felt that Xia ruofei looked familiar, but he could not remember where he had seen him before. If he could not remember, he could not be bothered to think about Yingluo. Anyway, in his eyes, other than a few people from the big families, the rest were all nobodies.

Tang real estate was indeed famous. In a short while, several groups of people came to greet Zhou Tianyu.

Zhao Yongjun’s connections were also very wide. He would nod to people from time to time, and sometimes people would come over to chat with him.

Soon, the bidding for the land began.

This time, only that piece of land was given up as a whole. The land and resources Bureau of the Pingchang district government was responsible for the specific auction.

Although the land wasn’t very big, the land and resources Bureau had hired a professional auctioneer.

After the simple opening remarks, the auctioneer went straight to the point and said enthusiastically,””Next, we will officially start the auction of land no. CP 08 0601 0023. The base price of the land is 250 million, and each raise of the sign will increase the price by no less than 1 million. Everyone can start bidding!”

” 251 million!” As soon as the auctioneer finished speaking, a real estate company immediately raised their sign.

This starting price was not considered high, so everyone was very active in the bidding at the beginning. Their signs were also raised one after another.

The price quickly reached 270 million.

Neither Xia ruofei’s side nor Liu haofan’s side made a bid because they knew that it was still too early to make a bid.

But very quickly, Liu haofan seemed to be a little impatient with the increase of one to two million. He turned his head and whispered a few words to Zhou Tianyu. Zhou Tianyu nodded slightly.

Then, Zhou Tianyu casually picked up the sign in front of him and raised it up high, shouting,”” 300 million!”
