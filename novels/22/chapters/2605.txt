In fact, even if he drank all six bags of medicine at once, there would not be any problem. It would only make the illness recover faster. Xia ruofei had divided the six bags of medicine into three days for elder Liu to take in order to control the rhythm and make the treatment more difficult.

Now that old man Liu had woken up, his body was still rather weak. Moreover, his throat and windpipe would definitely be damaged to a certain extent after the tubes were inserted. Drinking the last bag of medicine at this time could not only replenish his energy, but also heal the damage to his throat and windpipe in time. It was easy to recover from small injuries like this, and it consumed very little of the spirit Heart Flower petals.

The operation of planet 301’s decaning was very simple, especially for this expert team, which was mostly composed of PhDs. There was no difficulty at all.

In a short while, professor Luo personally removed the ventilator for old man Liu and treated the wound. At the same time, the nurse followed Xia ruofei’s instructions and fed old man Liu the last bag of Chinese medicine in small mouthfuls.

When Xia ruofei entered the ward again, old man Liu was already in a much better state of mind. However, there was still an oxygen tube inserted into his nostrils for oxygen.

“Little Xia, did I pass another level?” “It’s all thanks to you again, isn’t it?” old man Liu said with difficulty.

Xia ruofei smiled.”It was quite dangerous this time. However, the fact that you’re awake means that the most dangerous period has passed. You can rest in peace now!”

Old man Liu nodded and said,””Thank you!”

“You’re welcome ...” Xia ruofei smiled.”I’m your doctor. It’s my duty to treat you!”

Old man Liu sighed with emotion and said,””How can there be so many things within our duty? Besides, even if it’s something within their duty, how many people can do it well, or even do it to the extreme like you?”

Just as Xia ruofei was about to persuade old master Liu to speak less, the old man suddenly asked,””Xiao Xia, tell me the truth. Can I still make it this time?”

“Chief, why are you suddenly asking this?” Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment before he smiled and said,”what you need to do now is to recuperate. Don’t let your thoughts run wild.”

However, old man Liu shook his head stubbornly and said,””I don’t feel good this time. I even feel like I’ve received an invitation from old master Ma ...”

“Old master Ma?” Xia ruofei was stunned.

“Old man Marcus!” Elder Liu laughed.

“Oh ...” Xia ruofei suddenly realized and then said, not knowing whether to laugh or cry,””You’re such a big bureau chief, you can’t be idealistic!”

“This is not called solemnity, but a human’s sixth sense.” Old man Liu said,”many people had a premonition before the final moment came. Little Xia, I believe in your judgment. Just tell me how much time I have left! This is very important to me!”

The Liu family was like an aircraft carrier. If old man Liu, the “carrier Captain,” was gone, the aircraft carrier would sail into the treacherous undercurrent zone, and it would sink if it was not careful. If there was really something he couldn’t do, elder Liu would definitely have to make some arrangements in advance.

Xia ruofei was silent for a moment before he said,””Chief, I really can’t give you a clear answer now. Because the treatment plan has been constantly being adjusted and some medicinal herbs are still being found, I can’t say how far this treatment will go. ”

Old man Liu thought for a moment and asked,”then what if we stop all treatment from now on?” How much time do I have left?”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but scratch his head. This old man was really persistent!

However, since he had asked, Xia ruofei had nothing to hide. With old man Liu’s current condition, if all treatment methods were stopped, the cancer cells would soon wreak havoc in his body. In today’s world, there was no effective treatment for him.

“One week at the fastest,” Xia ruofei said.”It won’t take more than half a month.”

Old man Liu closed his eyes slightly and said,””I understand ... Thank you, Xia! You must be tired, go rest first ... Right, please call the peaks in!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei stood up and said,”but as your doctor, I have to remind you that you are very weak now. It is best to talk less and rest more!”

“Okay, okay ...” Elder Liu said with a smile.”I’ll rest after talking to Qunfeng.” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Xia ruofei didn’t say anything more. He nodded and walked out of the door.

As soon as they left the room, Xia ruofei said to Liu Qunfeng, who had a look of anticipation on his face,””Elder Liu’s condition is not too bad. He probably has something to tell you since he asked you to go in now.”

“Alright! Alright!” “Thank you, Mr. Xia!” Liu Qunfeng said.

“You’re too polite!” Xia ruofei said lightly,”be careful not to talk for too long. He needs to rest.”

“I understand! I understand!” “Then, Mr. Xia, you can go and rest first. I’ll go in now!” Liu Qunfeng said.

……

Liu Qunfeng walked into the ward and saw his father lying on the bed. He couldn’t help but sob,””Dad! You’re finally awake ...”

Old Liu looked weak, but his eyes were still powerful. He glared at Liu Qunfeng and said,””How old are you? you’re already a top leader in your unit, so why are you still acting like a sissy?”
