Chapter 3666: The devil’s will and God’s will_2

Translator: 549690339

If that was the case, it was understandable. However, Xia ruofei had come out alone and was walking around aimlessly. He might have broken the rules.

A top sect like the first heaven society had very strict rules. If one wandered around and accidentally entered a forbidden area, they would lose their life.

As a subsidiary sect of the heavenly sect, the water element sect was invited even though Shen Hu was only a Qi condensation cultivator. Now that Shen Hu was treating Lu You like his ancestor, he would naturally bring Lu You along to such an event.

Before entering the first heaven society, Shen Hu had repeatedly warned Lu You to be careful with her words and actions. She should not speak nonsense and should not run around on her own. Otherwise, she might get into trouble.

It was also Lu You’s first time coming to such a top – notch sect. The moment she entered the first heaven society, she felt as if she had entered a large Manor. The rich spirit Qi and the antique – looking buildings left her speechless. This was especially so for the ordinary disciples she met casually on the way. All of them had very deep cultivation, which made her even more shocked.

Therefore, she remembered Shen Hu’s words. She did not dare to go anywhere after she moved in yesterday. However, she was really bored staying in the house. Today, after consulting the service disciple, she dared to take a walk around the vicinity of her residence. The courtyard she stayed in was not far from the viewing platform.

Lu You did not expect to see a familiar back view the moment she stepped out of the door.

She was deeply in love with Xia ruofei and could almost confirm that it was Xia ruofei with one look.

However, Lu You couldn’t believe that Xia ruofei would appear in the first heaven society.

So she called out to Xia ruofei tentatively. When Xia ruofei turned around, she was completely sure.

Seeing Xia ruofei looking into the distance by himself, Lu You was also very worried.

Xia ruofei chuckled,”the person who brought me in is very busy. I’m afraid he doesn’t have the time to take care of me.” But he’ll look for me in a while.”

Xia ruofei was talking about the young master of the first heaven society, Chen Xuan.

Lu You panicked and quickly said,””Then where do you live? 1’11 go with you! Ruofei, I’m telling you, you can’t just barge into a place like this, or you might even lose your life. I’m not joking with you, no matter how high your social status is, the people here don’t care!”

Xia ruofei knew that Lu You was concerned about him. He was actually a little touched. He said,””Don’t worry! I know what I’m doing! He won’t cause any trouble…”

“You don’t know how serious this matter is!” Lu You said,”I don’t know who brought you in. How could they be so irresponsible and just leave you behind!” “Yup! That guy’s a little unreliable. He doesn’t care about other things when he’s busy.” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“You still dare to laugh!” Lu You could not help but glare at Xia ruofei.

At this moment, a voice came from behind them,””Lu You, what are you doing here?”

Xia ruofei and Lu You turned around at the same time. The person who had just arrived was the head of the water element sect, Shen Hu. He had met Xia ruofei once in the capital. At that time, Shen Hu had specially flown back from United Kingdom to Huaxia to ask for Xia ruofei’s forgiveness.

“Teacher!” Lu You called out nervously.

After Shen Hu had met Xia ruofei in the capital, he had taken Lu You in as an in – Name disciple. Hence, the two of them had addressed each other as master and disciple.

Naturally, Shen Hu saw Xia ruofei who had turned around immediately. His eyes widened.

However, before he could speak, he heard Xia ruofei’s voice,””Don’t reveal my identity for the time being. Pretend that you don’t know me. Lu You still doesn’t understand the situation.”

Xia ruofei’s voice was very dignified. Shen Hu could not help but break out in a cold sweat. He forced himself to hold back the words “senior Xia”.

Lu You saw Shen Hu staring at Xia ruofei with his eyes wide open and quickly explained,””Teacher, this is a friend of mine from the secular world. His name is Xia ruofei and he was probably brought in by another cultivator. We met here just now, so we stopped to chat.”

“Oh, 1 see!” Shen Hu suppressed the shock in his heart and pretended to speak calmly.

In fact, there was already a huge uproar in his heart.

Xia ruofei had been invited to observe the ceremony and Lu You had actually run into him. Furthermore, Lu You still had not discovered Xia ruofei’s identity as a cultivator. This was really too late … Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

At the same time, Shen Hu was also very nervous.

This time, he had brought Lu You along to observe Chen Nanfeng’s breakthrough in order to broaden her horizons. After all, even golden core cultivators would only have a once – in – a – lifetime opportunity to observe such a thing. It could be said to be extremely rare.

However, Shen Hu had overlooked the possibility that Xia ruofei might be here to observe the ceremony, which led to Xia ruofei and Lu You meeting at the first heaven society.

He was panicking now. He didn’t know if Xia ruofei would blame him or if this matter would go out of control if it continued to develop …

On the other side, Lu You quickly introduced Xia ruofei and said,””RUO Fei, this is my cultivation teacher, Shen Hu. He’s a Qi level 9 cultivator. Since your friend brought you here, he must be a cultivator as well. You haven’t heard your friend talk about the cultivation levels of cultivators, have you?” “Yes, I have!” Xia ruofei smiled.

Then, he turned to Shen Hu and smiled,”So it’s sect Master Shen, it’s a pleasure to meet you!”

Shen Hu looked at Xia ruofei and did not know how to address him.

At this moment, Xia ruofei transmitted his voice.””You can just call me Mr. Xia!”

Shen Hu then let out a sigh of relief and quickly said,”Mr. Xia, nice to meet you!”

The two of them gently shook hands.

Xia ruofei continued,”sect Master Shen, do you and Lu You live nearby?” Is it convenient for you to take a look?”

When Lu You heard this, she could not help but feel anxious. She wanted to stop Xia ruofei from talking nonsense. However, before Lu You could speak, Shen Hu hurriedly said,””Of course! Of course it’s convenient! Mr. Xia, this way please!”

Lu You was dumbfounded.

Was this still the serious teacher he knew? Although Shen Hu had always been friendly in front of Lu You, he was rather dignified in the sect.

However, Shen Hu’s attitude was extremely humble. There was even a trace of respect.

Lu You even suspected that her sect leader had been replaced by someone else, and that this Shen Hu was someone else in disguise.

Of course, she also knew that this was simply impossible.

It was only when Xia ruofei and Shen Hu walked towards the courtyard not far away that Lu You snapped out of her daze and quickly followed them.

Lu You didn’t dare to go too far when she came out for some fresh air. Hence, the place where she lived was actually very close. The three of them only took two to three minutes to walk there.

Xia ruofei looked around. This courtyard was slightly smaller than the one he lived in, but the overall environment was quite beautiful.

Shen Hu pushed open the courtyard door and made an inviting gesture to Xia ruofei. He said,”Mr. Xia, please!”

“Sect Master Shen, you’re too polite!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

However, he didn’t decline. He nodded with a smile and walked in.

Shen Hu quickly followed, and Lu You followed closely behind.

Walking into the courtyard, Xia ruofei could tell the difference at a glance. The courtyard he lived in was twice the size of this one, and the rooms were very spacious. Besides the smaller courtyard, the rooms in this small siheyuan were also slightly smaller than the one Xia ruofei lived in.

At this moment, a bird’s cry came from the courtyard. A man in his thirties walked out unsteadily with a parrot cage and greeted loudly,””Sect Master Shen, did you go out just now? Yo! Did he bring a friend back? Don’t tell me that this is Lu You’s boyfriend!”

“Elder Liu must be joking.” Shen Hu said,”Mr. Xia is my friend. We met outside just now, so I brought him in to have a look..”
