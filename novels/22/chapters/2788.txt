2789 Chapter 1521 – the Army set off for norkanp.2

Everyone laughed out of goodwill, which made Wu Lei even more embarrassed.

Of course, even if bar?a and RCD Espanyol were mortal enemies, his teammates were not unhappy because Wu Lei had posted such a Weibo post.

Bar?a was known as the universe team, and its fans were all over the world. Moreover, the entire team knew that Wu Lei was an Arsenal fan. He only had pure admiration for bar?a, not to mention that it was many years before he joined Espanyol.

Everyone was not na?ve enough to think that Wu Lei had betrayed the team because of such a Weibo post. In fact, they just thought that it was quite funny and felt a little emotional about the magic of fate.

In addition, the Spanish players were also speechless when they saw that Weibo had millions of views and thousands of shares.

They used to know that China had a large population and that Wu Lei had countless fans in China, but they did not have a clear idea. Today, through the Weibo platform, which was mainly based in China, they had a clear understanding of the situation.

“Wu! I heard that you have tens of millions of fans in China. That’s so enviable!” Naldo said with a look of yearning.

Wu Lei had been learning Spanish recently. Although he couldn’t speak fluently, he had no problem communicating with others.

He smiled shyly and said,””Thank you!”

“Lei Zi,” Xia ruofei asked, grinning,”do you want me to help you tell him to pass the ball to you more? in the future, you can introduce him to China to play football!”

In recent years, the Chinese Super League had begun the golden era. The world’s top foreign players had been constantly pouring into the league and constantly breaking the record for the players ‘salaries. An annual salary of ten million euros was considered super high in the world of football. In the Chinese Super League, there were actually several top foreign players who received this level of salary.

Therefore, many players in the top league dreamed of going to China to make money.

The salary of domestic players also rose. Basically, the National players could get an annual salary of ten million Yuan. Of course, the ten million Yuan here was in Chinese dollars.

Even so, this income was still quite high, far beyond the reach of other industries.

With such a background, Wu Lei was able to make the decision to come out of China and fight for the Spanish team, which was a mid – tier team in La Liga. Even though it was rumored that his mother team Shengang and Espanyol shared his salary and his income did not decrease much, it was already very rare to take this step and give up the comfort zone of the domestic league.

“No, no, no!” Wu Lei quickly waved his hand. Please let me go! I don’t have that much power! Besides, Naldo is a center back. How can he pass the ball to me!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but burst out laughing.

Naldo seemed to have heard Wu Lei mention his name. He turned his head and asked,””Boss, what did Wu say about me?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”nothing!” It was nothing! He complimented your defensive skills!”

Naldo touched his shiny black bald head, grinned at Wu Lei, and said,””Brother! Thanks for the compliment!”

After this little episode, Wu Lei’s tension was greatly relieved. He had felt a little breathless just now, but now he felt much more at ease. Even if there were still a large number of bar?a fans booing loudly outside the window, he was not affected much.

“Thank you, brother Xia!” Wu Lei said in a low voice.

Xia ruofei was scrolling through Weibo with his head lowered. He waved his hand and said nothing.

After a while, the team bus entered nokapu Stadium. The players got off in turn and walked towards the away team’s locker room.

A lot of fans had already gathered here, but under the isolation of the security personnel, those who could appear in the away team’s locker room were Spanish fans in blue and white jerseys. The bar?a fans could only be isolated on the periphery and kept booing.

Xia ruofei and Wu Lei got off the bus one after the other. The fans immediately cheered.

Xia ruofei saw that there were six or seven yellow – skinned and black – haired fans among the fans. They were all wearing jerseys No. 24 or No. 25. One of the two numbers belonged to Wu Lei, and the other to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei knew that they must be Chinese fans. As for whether they came from China or were international students in Europe, he did not know.

Xia ruofei turned around and gestured to Wu Lei. Wu Lei quickly noticed the Chinese fans and both of them waved in their direction.

The fans were even more excited. They kept shouting Xia ruofei’S and Wu Lei’s names. Someone even took out a red flag with five stars and waved it.

“Let’s go! Go over and say hello!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Alright!” Wu Lei replied.

The two of them walked to the side of the Chinese fans. When they saw them walking over, the Chinese fans cheered even louder.

Xia ruofei and Wu Lei came to the isolation belt. Xia ruofei smiled and asked,””Hello!”

“President Xia! Good luck!”

“Wu Lei! Good luck!”

“President Xia, can we have your signature?”

“And a group photo! I also want a group photo!”

Not only the Chinese fans, but the Spanish fans around them also excitedly greeted Xia ruofei and Wu Lei.

Seeing the extremely popular Xia ruofei and Wu Lei, the other RCD Espanyol players could not help but look at them with envy when they passed by.

Xia ruofei and Wu Lei did not reject the fans ‘requests. However, the fans did not pester them as they were about to start the pre – Match preparations. After signing a few autographs, Xia ruofei and Wu Lei took a few photos with them. They waved to the fans and quickly followed the team into the tunnel.

Everyone went to nokapu’s slightly shabby away team’s locker room. After changing into their jerseys, the starting players went down to the field to warm up before the game at the assistant manager’s call.

It was also Xia ruofei’s first time in nokapu. Wu Lei was the same.

The moment the two men walked out of the players ‘tunnel with their teammates, they suddenly heard endless loud boos. The intensity of the boos was many times higher than the boos from the roadside fans that they had heard through the glass in the car.

Wu Lei could be considered to be a veteran. After coming to La Liga, he had also participated in away games. However, when he suddenly heard such loud boos, he could not help but tremble. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei, on the other hand, was not affected. He looked around the stands without a change in expression and was surprised to find that there were already a lot of fans in the stands, especially the North Stand where the die – hard fans were. The flags were flying in the air, and the stands were densely packed with people. The boos were mainly coming from this stand.

There was still an hour or two before the match started!

Xia ruofei smiled and said to Diego Lopez,””The bar?a fans are early enough!”

Diego Lopez had experienced this countless times, so he was also very calm. He chuckled and said,””It’s like this every time in tyteby. Whether it’s the players or the fans, everyone seems to be on stimulants!”

“Don’t worry.” Xia ruofei shrugged.”Be careful. The anti – doping Committee might find you for a urine test after the game.”

Upon hearing this, Diego Lopez froze for a moment before bursting into laughter.

Head coach Ruby also came to the side of the field. He happened to see the scene of Xia ruofei and Diego Lopez joking. Mr. Xia didn’t look nervous at all. What a big scene!

In contrast, Ruby saw Wu Lei’s slightly nervous expression. Of course, Ruby was not too worried. It was normal to be nervous in the face of tens of thousands of bar?a fans. As for Xia ruofei’s big heart, not everyone had it.

Every manager had their own set of ways to motivate the players, and Ruby was no exception. He would try his best to stimulate everyone’s fighting spirit after they returned to the locker room in a while. He would let everyone put down their tension and focus all their energy on the game.
