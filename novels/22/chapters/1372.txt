Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei drove along the school’s road. The scenery was beautiful on both sides. Students were walking in twos and threes with books in their hands. Some were pushing their bicycles. Not far away, there were many students sitting on the grass and reading seriously. The basketball court never lacked hormones. The boys were sweating like rain. As soon as they entered the school, they immediately felt the youthful atmosphere.

Xia ruofei parked the car by the roadside, rolled down the window, and stuck his head out. He called out to a girl who was passing by.”Fellow student, may I know how to get to the female dormitory in the School of Media and communications?”

Lin Qiao’s major in advertising was in the School of Journalism and Communication.

The girl saw the handsome Xia ruofei driving the luxury car and blushed. Then, she told Xia ruofei the way to the girls ‘dormitory in detail.

Xia ruofei thanked her politely and started the car again.

Song Rui said with a smile,”ruofei, you’re getting more and more charming!” I saw the girl blushing!” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Go!” Xia ruofei laughed and scolded him.”That’s because you hid your strength, young master Song. If you went down to ask for directions, he might even want to lead the way for you himself!”

“I like to hear that! “Hahaha ...” Song Rui grinned.

He didn’t know if the girl had said it wrong out of nervousness or if Xia ruofei’s understanding was wrong, but he followed the girl’s directions and couldn’t find the place.

Finally, they had to ask for directions again and finally arrived at Lin Qiao’s dormitory.

Xia ruofei had been here once when Lin Qiao came to register. He immediately remembered when he was near the dormitory building.

Xia ruofei stopped the car on the side and took out his phone to call Lin Qiao.

Hearing the dial tone from the phone, Xia ruofei thought to himself,”Don’t tell me this girl is not in the dormitory! Otherwise, his wish to create a surprise for her would be in vain.

In order to prepare for the surprise attack today, Xia ruofei even specifically told Hu Zi’s mother not to tell Lin Qiao that he was coming to Egret Island.

Soon, Lin Qiao’s happy voice came from the phone,””Brother ruofei! Why did you suddenly call me today?”

“I haven’t contacted you in a long time. I’m just showing you some concern!” Xia ruofei said with a smile. Then, he opened the door and jumped out of the car. He leaned against the door.

The Knight XV’s domineering appearance attracted a lot of attention. Most of the people walking in and out of the room were girls, so many of them couldn’t help but look at Xia ruofei curiously.

Lin Qiao pouted and said,”you also know that we haven’t been in contact for a long time?” I thought you had forgotten about me!”

“How can that be? I’d never dare to forget my sister!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’m calling you now, aren’t I? By the way, Qiao’ er, where are you now?”

“The dormitory!” Lin Qiao replied casually,”I don’t have any classes this morning. It’s too cold and I don’t want to go out, so I just stayed in the dormitory. I’m about to go out for lunch with my roommates!”

Xia ruofei was secretly glad that Lin Qiao would have gone to the cafeteria to eat if he had come a little later.

He chuckled and said,”you’re in the dormitory?” Did you miss ruofei bro?”

Lin Qiao replied without hesitation,”of course!” Brother ruofei, even I want to change my mind. I’m going back for the new year ... I miss my mom ... And you!”

Although Lin Qiao’s words were not emotional, there was a strong sense of attachment.

“Qiao’ er, go to the window now ...”Xia ruofei said, his heart warmed.

“What’s wrong?” Lin Qiao’s voice was a little nervous. She had guessed a possibility, but she was afraid that she had misunderstood it.

Xia ruofei laughed.”You’ll know when you walk over. I’ve prepared a surprise for you.”

Xia ruofei heard some light footsteps from the phone. Then, with his super eyesight, he immediately saw a figure flash by the window of Lin Qiao’s dormitory upstairs.

Then, Xia ruofei heard Lin Qiao’s surprised scream from the phone.””Ah ...”

Xia ruofei quickly moved the phone away from his ear so that his eardrums would not burst.

In fact, even without the phone, Xia ruofei could hear Lin Qiao’s surprised scream from downstairs. Many passing students looked up in confusion!

After a short while, Xia ruofei saw Lin Qiao’s figure rushing out of the dormitory building.

Lin Qiao was wearing a white down jacket, a pair of blue jeans, and white sneakers. Her ponytail swayed left and right as she ran, making her look youthful.

The smile on her face was like a flower. This was a kind of joy that came from the heart.

Lin Qiao threw herself into Xia ruofei’s arms like a young swallow returning to the forest. Xia ruofei subconsciously hugged Lin Qiao’s youthful body tightly. His expression froze for a moment as he could feel the ambiguous gazes from the two cars behind him ...

“Brother ruofei, why did you come here all of a sudden? you didn’t even tell me ...” Lin Qiao said excitedly, her voice even choked with emotion.

Xia ruofei could feel Lin Qiao’s strong attachment to him. He gently patted Lin Qiao’s back and said,””Qiao’ er, there are so many people watching ...”

“I don’t care. I’m carrying my brother. What can others do?” Lin Qiao said in a spoiled manner.

However, she quickly let go of Xia ruofei with a red face. At this time, many students at the dormitory door looked over with smiles on their faces, which made Lin Qiao’s face even hotter.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I’m just trying to give you a surprise.” If I had told you in advance, it wouldn’t have had such an effect! How is it, Qiao’ er? are you surprised?”

Lin Qiao glanced at Xia ruofei and said,””What a surprise! I’m even a little scared ...”

When she thought of how she had lost her composure when she saw Xia ruofei through the window, Lin Qiao couldn’t help but laugh with a red face.

“By the way, godmother also brought you a lot of thick clothes. The cold current has passed by recently, and the weather is rather cold. She specifically asked me to tell you to wear more clothes!” Xia ruofei replied,”Oh! She also made you a lot of marinade, I’ll bring it to you later, you can go back and give some to your roommates, let’s go for lunch first!”

“Yes, I’ll follow your arrangements!” Lin Qiao lowered her head and said softly.

At this moment, Lin Qiao finally noticed the two cars in front and behind, as well as the figure that she could vaguely see through the window. She couldn’t help but ask shyly,””Brother ruofei, did you bring people with you?”

Xia ruofei turned around and smiled.””A few of my friends from Beijing came to Heron Island for a vacation! You should know song Rui, and a few of his friends are also very nice. Don’t be so formal! We’re just having a meal together!”

“Mm! I won’t be nervous with you by my side!” Lin Qiao said mischievously.

Because of Xia ruofei’s special instructions, Zhao Yongjun, song Rui, Hou Liang, Xu Zixuan, and the others all stayed in the car. Otherwise, Knight XV was already eye – catching enough, and with a group of young masters wearing branded goods, it might be posted on the school forum.

“Then let’s go!” Xia ruofei asked,”Oh right, do you have any classes in the afternoon?”

“There are two elective classes!” Lin Qiao said mischievously,”but if brother Fei is here, I’m not going to go!”

“How can I do that? I still have to go to class!” Xia ruofei said.

“Aiya, brother ruofei, you don’t have to worry about it!” Lin Qiao said coyly,”professor Lu never takes attendance. I’ve studied all his courses by myself. I’m sure I can pass the exam!”

Xia ruofei was not an old – fashioned pedant. Although he had never been to college, he knew that it was not a big deal for college students to skip class, let alone an elective course. Since Lin Qiao had promised that she would pass the exam, he would not force her to go to class since he doted on her so much.

Hence, Xia ruofei said,”alright!” I’ll take you to Gulangyu in the afternoon, and you’ll be our tour guide!”

“That’s great!” Lin Qiao said happily,”brother ruofei is the best!”

“Just don’t do it again!” Xia ruofei said helplessly.

“yes sir!”Lin Qiao cheekily saluted Xia ruofei and said with a smile.

Xia ruofei rubbed Lin Qiao’s nose lovingly and said,””Get in the car!”

Just as Lin Qiao walked around the front of the car and opened the door of the passenger’s seat, a gentle voice suddenly came from behind,””Qiao’ er! Who is he to you?”
