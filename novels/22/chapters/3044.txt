Translator: 5496903After Xia ruofei finished speaking, he patted Li Yifu’s shoulder and said with a smile,””If everything goes well, I might be back in a day or two. I’ll give you a surprise then!”

Li Yifu didn’t try to keep him any longer and said respectfully,””Yes! Then this disciple will be waiting for martial granduncle on the Peach Blossom Island! Don’t worry, martial granduncle. I will take care of the house. As long as I’m here, the island will be there!”

“It’s not that serious!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”the cultivation world doesn’t even know about the existence of Paradise Island. The possibility of an enemy appearing is very small!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,””Then I’ll be leaving! I’ll try to go and come back early!”

“Yes! Disciple will see martial granduncle off!” Li Yifu quickly said.

The two of them quickly reached the rooftop from the stairs.

Li Yifu watched as Xia ruofei took out the black Swift Boat. In the blink of an eye, the swift Boat had become a small black dot in his vision. Its speed was so fast that it left one speechless.

Xia ruofei skillfully maneuvered the flying boat out of the range of the Taixu xuanqing formation on the Peach Blossom Island. Then, he quickly rose to a higher altitude and continued to accelerate until the speed of the flying boat stabilized at a speed that was a bit faster than that of an ordinary golden core cultivator. Only then did Xia ruofei control the flying boat to maintain a constant speed.

This time, his destination was to return to Huaxia and pick up Song Wei and Ling Qingxue.

In fact, if he wasn’t so eager to modify the Taixu xuanqing formation and verify his theory, he would have gone to find Song Wei and Ling Qingxue first. After all, the star Seizer sect was also located in Huaxia. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

However, he was concerned about the Taixu xuanqing formation, so he went straight to peach source island after leaving the star Seizer sect.

Of course, now that Xia ruofei had the black Swift Boat, it would only take him two to three hours to travel between Huaxia and peach source Island. Besides, one spiritual crystal was enough for him to fly several times, so it was not a big deal to take a detour.

Besides, the black airboat was a side flight. After setting the direction and speed, it could basically cruise at a fixed speed. Xia ruofei could cultivate during the journey without any delay.

The reason he went to find Song Wei and Ling Qingxue was to share the wild tea that Chen Xuan had given him with everyone.

When a Qi refining cultivator drank wild tea for the first time, it could steadily increase his cultivation by one level without affecting his Foundation. Xia ruofei certainly could not forget his two female friends.

The wild tea that Chen Xuan gave was enough to be shared by five people at most. In other words, it could be brewed once and split into five cups.

Therefore, in theory, the plan to maximize the efficiency should be Song Wei, Ling Qingxue, Li Yifu, Xia ruofei’s disciple Tang Haoran, and Song Wei’s father song Qiming. There were five people in total.

These were basically all the people close to Xia ruofei who had come into contact with cultivation.

However, considering song Qiming’s status in the system and the fact that song Qiming did not know much about cultivation, Xia ruofei did not want to reveal too much about the cultivation world to song Qiming.

If he were to bring the wild tea to the three mountains to share with everyone, Li Yifu would have to leave the Peach Blossom Island. This meant that there would be no one to take charge of the situation. Originally, Zheng Yongshou could also take charge of the Peach Blossom Island. His array Dao level was even higher than Li Yifu ‘s. However, the star Seizer sect was about to undergo a major internal reorganization. A disciple like Zheng Yongshou, whose loyalty would not be questioned, would naturally be heavily promoted by Luo Qingfeng. Thus, after the screening of the members, Luo Qingfeng asked for Xia ruofei’s permission. So, he transferred Zheng Yongshou back to the star Seizer sect from the Peach Blossom Island.

Under such circumstances, Li Yifu naturally couldn’t leave Paradise Island.

After weighing the pros and cons, Xia ruofei decided to share the wild tea this time and not include song Qiming.

He brought Song Wei, Ling Qingxue, and Tang Haoran to peach source Island. Then, he let the three of them share the precious wild tea with Li Yifu.

As for song Qiming’s side, Xia ruofei would not be biased. He just had to wait for a while.

Chen Xuan had already agreed to give Xia ruofei a few wild tea tree branches.

Xia ruofei was very confident that he could definitely grow the wild tea in his spirit map space.

By then, not only would song Qiming be able to use the wild tea to increase his cultivation, but Xia ruofei could also give some wild tea to Luo Qingfeng as a reward for the Qi refining stage disciples.

Xia ruofei had already made up his mind when he was on Peach Blossom Island. Hence, after the black airboat took off, it flew directly in the direction of Sanshan city.

While the black flying boat was flying, Xia ruofei was still cultivating in the spirit map space.

As usual, he checked the mysterious ore, but there was still no sign of scholar Yuntai waking up. Therefore, he sat cross – legged on the futon next to the ore and began to practice the great Dao Arts.

Two hours later, Xia ruofei stopped cultivating and left the spirit map space. He kept the scroll in his palm.

At this time, the black flying boat was already flying over the East China Sea. It had just passed by the southern end of the island in the southeast of China and was quickly crossing the Strait.

With the black airboat’s speed, they would naturally arrive at Sanshan city in no time.

It was eighto’ clock in the morning in Huaxia. Xia ruofei returned to the ‘cockpit’ of the airboat and released his spiritual power to observe the situation ahead.

In less than ten minutes, the black flying boat had crossed the Strait.

Xia ruofei didn’t fly directly to the San Shan city. Instead, he lowered his altitude and speed, found an open space between Heron Island and San Shan, and slowly lowered the flying boat.
