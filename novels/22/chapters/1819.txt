Chapter 1820: Successful deception (1)

Translator: 549690339

Ling Qingxue was no longer an ignorant little girl. How could she not know what Xia ruofei was thinking?

She blushed and glared at Xia ruofei.””RUO Fei, you didn’t trick me into coming to the farm on purpose, did you? And ... Is this really a Traditional Chinese Medicine that recuperates the body, and not some kind of medicine that urges ... That?”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment before he reacted and almost burst out laughing.

As he laughed, he pointed at Ling Qingxue and said,””Wife ... You ... Your imagination is too ... Too big!”

Ling Qingxue was embarrassed and annoyed. She reached out and pinched the soft flesh on Xia ruofei’s waist and said fiercely,””Don’t laugh!”

Xia ruofei kept begging for mercy, but he couldn’t help but laugh out loud. Ling Qingxue was even more stubborn. Her fists rained down on Xia ruofei’s body. Of course, she couldn’t bear to hit him too hard. The strength she used was more or less enough to tickle Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei grabbed Ling Qingxue’s soft hands and the two of them stopped. Ling Qingxue’s face was still blushing from embarrassment. Her perky chest rose and fell slightly, which made Xia ruofei’s heart beat faster.

The two of them did not speak, but they kissed each other in tacit understanding ...

After a round of sex, Ling Qingxue’s entire body was limp as she lay in Xia ruofei’s arms. She was not even willing to move her fingers. Xia ruofei also put his arm around Ling Qingxue’s smooth shoulder, his face full of satisfaction, and his palm gently rubbed her.

After a long time, Ling Qingxue felt that she had regained some of her strength. She struggled a little and raised her head to look at Xia ruofei.”RUO Fei, when are you going to teach me how to cultivate?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’ll check your body first. If it’s suitable, we can start today. If you’re not in your best condition, take another dose of medicine in two days. Anyway, we’re not in a hurry. It’s better to take things one step at a time!”

Ling Qingxue nodded and said,””Okay, I’ll listen to you ...”

Xia ruofei grabbed Ling Qingxue’s wrist, which was as white as snow, and placed his fingers on her pulse. His spiritual body quickly entered her body.

In fact, although Xia ruofei looked relaxed, he was actually very nervous.

Xia ruofei had no idea if the heart – concentrating grass would help Ling Qingxue improve her cultivation talent and how effective it would be.

He was slightly nervous as he closed his eyes and carefully examined Ling Qingxue’s cultivation talent.

After a while, Xia ruofei heaved a sigh of relief. At the same time, he was a little disappointed that the heart – concentrating grass had improved Ling Qingxue’s cultivation talent. It was just that Ling Qingxue’s Foundation was too weak, so the improvement did not meet Xia ruofei’s expectations. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

At the very least, Ling Qingxue was not as good as Song Wei after she had consumed the heart concentrating grass.

This also meant that in terms of talent, Ling Qingxue was not as good as Song Wei. The two of them had taken the same medicine made from heart – condensing grass, but the effects were completely different.

Of course, cultivation itself was going against the natural order of things. There were not many people who had the talent to cultivate. Even if most people were lucky enough to obtain a cultivation technique, they would not be able to get started in their entire lives.

If a cultivator were to see that Xia ruofei was able to transform a person who had no talent in cultivation into someone who could barely cultivate with just a dose of medicine, they would definitely be shocked.

In the long years, there were many cultivators who were talented and had a higher cultivation than Xia ruofei. However, they did not pass on their genes to the next generation. In this case, they could only let their children live a longer life than ordinary people, but they could not change their children’s bodies into cultivators.

However, Xia ruofei was not satisfied.

He already felt that he owed Ling Qingxue a lot. If Ling Qingxue could barely cultivate, but her talent was not as good as Song Wei ‘s, the feeling of guilt in his heart would be even stronger.

Now it seemed that Xia ruofei’s decision to ask Xia Qing to cultivate the second heart concentrating grass was the right one.

He used his divine sense to inform Xia Qing.”Operate the spirit gathering formation at full speed. Let the heart concentrating grass mature as soon as possible. The sooner, the better!”

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing replied in the space.

Seeing that Xia ruofei had not spoken for a long time, Ling Qingxue felt a little uneasy. She asked,””Ruofei, is my body not in good condition?”

Xia ruofei came back to his senses and quickly smiled.””No, no! The effect of the medicine just now was pretty good. Actually, there’s nothing wrong with your body. It’s mainly because you’re usually tired from work, so you might be a little weak. I’ve checked just now, and he’s already recovered quite well. However, in order to ensure that the first cultivation will go smoothly, we’d better wait a few more days!”

“We still have to wait?” Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but feel disappointed.

Xia ruofei smiled.”You haven’t fully absorbed this dose of medicine. I’m going to give you another one in three days. By then, I’m sure your body will be fine!”

“Alright! “I’ll listen to you ...”Ling Qingxue said.

Although she was looking forward to cultivation, Xia ruofei must have his reasons for saying that he needed more time to recuperate. She had absolute trust in Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei laughed and put his arm around Ling Qingxue’s shoulder.”Wife, since we’re not going to cultivate today, let’s do something interesting ...”
