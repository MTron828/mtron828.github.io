“En!” Xu Yougang nodded and said,”we have never dared to relax in our business!”

“Not bad! Not bad!” Xia ruofei nodded his head in satisfaction. Then, he continued to chat with Wang Chong, Zeng Liang, and Zhang Aijun.

“Brother Liang, these are my good friends. You have to make the necessary arrangements!” Xia ruofei turned around and asked.

Without waiting for Liang Qichao to speak, Xu Yougang quickly said,””Brother Xia, CEO Liang has been taking good care of us. He’s arranged our lives very well and we don’t have any worries!”

Liang Qichao said with a chuckle,”the farm has added quite a few more workers. Also, because the prices of our vegetables and fruits are relatively high, there have been cases of theft from time to time. After Yougang and the others came, I handed over the security work to them. They did a very good job!”

“Oh?” Xia ruofei asked with great interest,”old Xu, tell me how you guys started your work?”

“Yes!” Xu Yougang nodded and said,”brother Xia, the farm is very large, and the boundary is quite blurry, so it’s impossible for the four of us to cover all of it. After we arrived, we mainly did these things: “The first is to recruit personnel. We personally interviewed them and recruited a local security team of good quality. The second was to clear the boundaries of the farm and install security and surveillance facilities. The third was to purchase electric patrol cars, apply for firearms and other security equipment, and arrange for personnel to constantly increase the patrol of the edge of the farm. ”

Xu Yougang and his comrades looked at each other and continued,””After the work was in place, we caught a few groups of thieves in a row, which probably had a certain deterrent effect. After that, the theft of the farm was almost non – existent.”

Xia ruofei nodded approvingly and said,””Very good! It seemed like professional matters should be left to the professionals! Old Xu, I’m very satisfied with your work!”

“Thank you for your encouragement, brother Xia!” Xu Yougang said excitedly.

Their gratitude towards Xia ruofei came from the bottom of their hearts. Initially, they were chosen by Lei Hu to carry out the mission of tracking and monitoring Liu haojun for Xia ruofei. On the other hand, it was also because they all had their own family difficulties. Of course, everyone knew each other well during their years in the Army. Lei Hu had confidence in their character, which was why he recommended them to Xia ruofei.

After Xu Yougang and the others completed the task for Xia ruofei, Xia ruofei not only gave them a generous reward to help their families tide over the difficulties, but also put himself in their shoes. In order to prevent the Liu family from finding clues and taking revenge on them, he decisively arranged for them to work in Australia. If they were willing, they could even settle their families there. This made them extremely grateful to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei asked,”brother Liang, old Xu and the others have brought their families along. You have to ensure that they have food and accommodation!” As you can see, they’re all rare talents!”

“Don’t worry!”Liang Qichao said with a smile. When have I ever given any discounts on the things you’ve instructed me to do? “Our farm has a lot of new employees, so we’re building a staff apartment that can also function as a night shift resting room. I can give tomogang and his brothers a large apartment each! There’s no problem for a family of three generations to live together!”

Xu Yougang also said,”brother Xia, boss Liang takes great care of all of us!” The family members who came along with us have all been properly settled. The children have all been arranged to go to the Community School. ”

“Very good! Very good!” Xia ruofei said happily and then asked,”can they all adapt?”

“I wasn’t used to it when I first came, but I’ve gotten used to it after a long time.” Xu Yougang said,”children adapt faster. There’s a language environment here, and they can even speak English very well now!”

Xia ruofei nodded with relief. Then, he patted Xu Yougang’s shoulder and said,””Brothers, do your best here! We can expand the security team and slowly take over the security of the two wineries!”

“Yes!” Xu Yougang puffed out his chest and said,”I promise to complete the task!”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”old Xu, I still have something for you to do. Let’s talk in private later!”

“Alright, brother Xia!” Xu Yougang replied. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Let’s go! All of you, go in!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I can even smell the aroma of roasted suckling pig! It must be uncle Wester and Auntie cabalie who are preparing good food inside, right?”

“Your nose is so sharp!” “They wanted to give you a surprise!” Liang Qichao said with a smile.

Xia ruofei laughed out loud.”It was like this last time. This old man and old lady are nothing new!”

After that, Xia ruofei walked into the small villa first, followed by Liang Qichao, Liu Kuan, Xu Yougang, and the others.

As expected, the moment Xia ruofei entered the house, he saw West and Kelly busy in the open kitchen. Both of them were wearing aprons. When they saw Xia ruofei, they immediately called out happily,””Hey! The boss! I’m so happy to see you again!”

“Uncle Wester! Aunty cabalie!” Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”long time no see. I really miss your food!”

The old couple’s cooking skills were pretty good. Feng Rao and Xia ruofei were addicted to Old West’s apple pie last time. As for the roasted suckling pig, it was really tender on the inside and crispy on the outside. The aroma was overwhelming, and the Golden suckling pig was appetizing.

“Boss!” Cabbies chuckled. Then hurry up and wash your hands! It’ll be ready soon!”

After a while, the food prepared by the old couple was served one after another. Xia ruofei and the others sat around the table. Old West even brought a few bottles of Semillon wine that Xia ruofei and Feng Jing had personally brewed for Xia ruofei to try.

In all fairness, the wine from West Winery and gold oak winery was slightly inferior to the wine that Xia ruofei had brewed in the medium. However, if one were to compare them, they were on a higher level compared to the wine from the two wineries in the past.

“How’s the taste?” Old West stared at Xia ruofei and asked.

Xia ruofei gently put down his glass and gave a thumbs up.”Very good Semillon! Uncle Wester, it seems that it’s necessary to stick to the traditional brewing process!”

Old West was grinning from ear to ear.””It’s mainly because of the high quality of the grapes you brought in. The Semillon produced by our two wineries this year is second to none in the entire Hunter Valley area! The sales are very hot!”

“You’ve all worked hard!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Boss, don’t forget what you promised me!” Old West asked.

Xia ruofei was stunned and asked,”what I promised you?” What’s the matter?”

“You didn’t really forget, did you?” Old West shouted,”oak! You promised me that you’ll prepare enough oak for me this year for the high – Quality project last year. At least, I’ll be able to guarantee the required wine for this year!”

Xia ruofei suddenly remembered, but he disguised himself well and did not show any surprise. He just smiled and said,””How could I forget such an important matter? Don’t worry! I’ll naturally get it ready for you when the time comes!”

“Then we’ll have to hurry!” “There’s still about two to three months before the new round of grape harvesting begins!” This time, we’re mass producing oak barrels, so the wood needs to arrive at least a month in advance. Otherwise, it’s impossible to complete it before the wine brewing!”

“Don’t worry! Don’t worry!” Xia ruofei promised,”I promise you that you will see the wood within two months!”

“That’s great!” Old West happily said,”boss! I’ll toast you!”

Everyone had a happy lunch together and went back to work.

Liang Qichao had arranged a guest room for Liu Kuan on the first floor, while Xia ruofei’s room was on the second floor. Liang Qichao wanted to give Xia ruofei the largest guest bedroom with a balcony, but Xia ruofei thought it was too much trouble and insisted on a guest bedroom that was as good as the master bedroom.

Xia ruofei returned to his room. Not long after, he heard footsteps and a knock on the door.

“Come in!” Xia ruofei shouted.

Xu Yougang walked into the room and said,””Brother Xia, if there’s anything you need me to do, just let me know!”
