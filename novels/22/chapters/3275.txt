3276 Caught off guard (1)

Two minutes passed by quickly, and the light screen door was still standing there quietly. Shen tianfang did not appear again.

While they were waiting, everyone’s communication channel was silent. Obviously, after Shen tianfang entered the light screen portal, his communication with everyone was cut off.

This was expected. Everyone was a cultivator and they knew that although the entrance to the mystic realm appeared on the moon, it was possible that the mystic realm was not on the moon at all. Instead, it was located in a folded space. No matter how far the effective distance of radio communication was, it was impossible to transmit radio waves across space.

Everyone’s spacesuits came with multi – function wristwatches. Mu Hua raised his hand and looked at the countdown on his wristwatch. He secretly sighed and said,””Time’s Up, we can’t delay any longer! Jianfei, let’s go in too!”

“Alright!” Mu Jianfei answered without hesitation.

No one knew how long the light screen would last. So, since the agreed time of two minutes was up, mu Hua and mu Jianfei could not wait any longer even if Shen tianfang did not return.

Mu Hua and mu Jianfei stood in front of the light curtain Door. Mu Hua turned around and smiled faintly,””Fellow cultivators, we, uncle and nephew, will also take our leave first. If possible, I will come back to report the news in two minutes!” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Elder mu, brother Jianfei, take care!” Xia ruofei said seriously.

There were too many possibilities. He might have been caught in danger and couldn’t get out in two minutes, or he might have been killed as soon as he entered. It was also possible that the light curtain Door was a one – way passage, and there was no way to come back after entering. There were many other possibilities.

But no matter which possibility it was, it meant danger. Mu Hua and mu Jianfei were the second group to enter, so they naturally took a great risk, especially mu Jianfei, who was only a Qi refining cultivator, and his cultivation was too low.

Xia ruofei had a good relationship with mu Jianfei, so he was worried for him.

Mu Hua and mu Jianfei didn’t say anything more. They just smiled and waved at everyone, and then stepped into the light curtain Door without hesitation.

Xia ruofei and the others watched as mu Hua and mu Jianfei disappeared into the light curtain. The light curtain only shook a few times and quickly returned to normal. This time, Xia ruofei and the others tried to use their spiritual power to probe but as expected, they found nothing.

After mu Hua and mu Jianfei entered the door, there were only six people left outside. They were Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue, Chen Xuan and Xu yurou, Yang Liu and Yu xiner.

In fact, this group was divided according to the sect. Other than Shen tianfang, who was in the intermediate stage of the Golden core realm, who was the first to enter the Mystic realm alone, the other eight people were all in pairs from the same sect. The other group was Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue, the pair of cultivation partners. They were also a combination of one golden core realm cultivator and one Qi refinement realm cultivator.

This way, everyone would be more at ease when grouping, and they could also take care of each other.

Xia ruofei and the other five stood quietly outside, staring at the light screen door. After mu Hua and mu Jianfei entered the portal, Chen Xuan calmly turned on the timer on his watch, telling them that he and Xu yurou would be the next group to enter.

After a minute, Chen Xuan gestured for Xu yurou to get ready to enter the virtual screen. Then, he turned to Xia ruofei and the others and said,””Brother Xia, elder yang, I don’t think elder mu will be able to return. I think you can wait for a while after Xu yurou and I go in, but I don’t think it’s necessary to wait for two minutes.” Once I enter, if I can turn back, I will immediately turn back! In addition, if I can’t come out after I go in, I think there’s no need for the four of you to split up again. You might as well go in together! After all, we don’t know how long this door of light will last. ”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”that makes sense!” We’ll judge based on the actual situation! As for brother Chen ... We don’t know anything about the situation inside, so you must prioritize your safety and not enter rashly!”

“Don’t worry!”Chen Xuan nodded and smiled. I treasure my life the most!”

At this time, Chen Xuan’s watch showed that two minutes had passed, but the portal was still silent. After mu Hua and mu Jianfei entered, there was no more news from them.

“Haha!” Chen Xuan laughed and said,”it’s finally our turn! Yurou, get ready, we’re going in!”

“Yes! Young sect leader!” “Yes,” Xu yurou replied.

“Brother Chen, take care!”

“Young sect leader Chen, take care!”

Xia ruofei and Yang Liu said in unison.

Chen Xuan smiled and said,”we’ll meet again in the secret realm!” I wish everyone good luck! Yurou, let’s go!”

After that, Chen Xuan and Xu yurou strode into the light door without hesitation.

Xia ruofei watched as Chen Xuan and Xu yurou’s figures disappeared into the light curtain Door. He looked at the Willow and said,””Elder yang, what do you think of brother Chen’s suggestion?”

Yang Liu pondered for a moment and said,”Xin ‘er and I will be the last batch to enter!” We’ve been waiting for so long anyway, I think the light gate won’t collapse in another minute or two. “
