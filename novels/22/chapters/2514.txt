2515 The power of the East continues to show its might (Part 2)_1

Soon, Ruby finished his instructions and Wu Lei came to the sidelines to wait for the game. The fourth official next to him held the substitute card in his hand and waited for a dead ball to appear on the field before Wu Lei could be replaced.

The Chinese fans who stayed up all night to watch the game suddenly lost their sleepiness and stared at the computer screen in front of them. The broadcast screen was still the game scene, but at the bottom of the screen, Wu Lei could be seen exercising while watching the field. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

This scene brought tears to the eyes of many old fans.

The team doctor, Diego, followed the stretcher and went around most of the field to return to the substitutes ‘bench. Piatti was directly sent to the ambulance. Diego would also follow the ambulance to accompany Piatti to the hospital. The mysterious power of the East! It definitely was!

In the PP sports studio, Shen fangjian and Jia Tianning were also very excited.

“We saw that our Chinese player, Wu Lei, has been appointed to the role due to an accidental injury!” Shen fangjian said. He was now standing on the sidelines, ready to make his appearance. The Chinese fans have been waiting for this moment for too long!”

“I believe that once Wu Lei makes his appearance, he’ll definitely be able to bring a different content to the team’s offensive line!” Jia Tianning said. Especially his flexible running and keen sense of smell in front of the goal, he would definitely be of help to the team! Although Spain is now two goals behind, there’s at least an hour left including injury time. There’s definitely enough time!”

As soon as Jia Tianning’s voice fell, a loud cheer suddenly rang out in the hall!

It turned out that the Spanish team had made a pass in the opponent’s penalty area that was not a big threat. As a result, the opponent’s Center back kicked the ball to clear the siege. The football crossed an extremely strange arc and went directly into the goal. The goalkeeper did not react at all and just watched the football enter the goal.

1 to 2! Espanyol had pulled back one point!

It was an absolute accident. Not only were the opposing defenders and goalkeeper stunned, but even the Spanish players on the field were also stunned for a moment before they began to celebrate.

Wu Lei couldn’t help but raise his arms and shout.

“Oh! What did we just see?” Shen fangjian couldn’t help but shout excitedly,”Wu Lei hasn’t played yet, but the situation on the field has changed. An own goal by valekano has allowed the Spanish team to close the gap. Now there is only a one – point difference between the two teams!”

“The situation is very favorable for Wu Lei!” Jia Tianning analyzed,”after the Spanish team pulled back a point, their morale must be very high. Moreover, the opponent’s own goal is very demoralizing. After Wu Lei comes on, he will definitely get a chance!”

The fans watching the live broadcast on the internet were even more imaginative, and all kinds of commenters also appeared.

“Ball King Wu hasn’t even appeared yet, but the other side is already scared to death!”

“Ball King Wu is mighty! When the valekano players saw the famous Ball King Wu standing on the sidelines, their legs immediately went soft, hahaha!”

“Wu Lei is definitely the lucky star of Espanyol!”

“After the game, the valekano players were interviewed and said that when they saw Ball King Wu getting ready to play, they refused in their hearts. They only wanted to ask Ball King Wu one thing ... Can you introduce me to play in the Chinese Super League?”

“Pfft! What a godly turnaround!”

……

While the fans and commenters on the internet were reveling, Wu Lei finally made his appearance.

As piaty had already left the field, Wu Lei did not need to wait for the player to be replaced. The referee waved and he ran into the field. The fourth official also raised the substitute card.

When Wu Lei stepped on the turf, Shen fangjian said excitedly,””This is a historical moment! I believe that this scene of Wu Lei will be repeatedly mentioned a few years later! This was the return of Chinese players to the five major leagues after ten years! Who said that Wu Lei is looking after the water dispenser?”

At this moment, the live broadcast cut to the audience’s podium. Xia ruofei and Zhou leiyun’s smiling and clapping were captured in the camera and displayed in front of the fans all over the world.

“We saw that the chairman of glory World Group and the chairman of the Spanish club, Mr. Zhou leiyun, also came to watch the game. I believe Wu Lei must be in the mix.” Shen fangjian said,”after all, other than Wu Lei, this competition can’t be considered a particularly important one.”

Jia Tianning said,”everyone, pay attention. Next to Mr. Zhou leiyun is Mr. Xia ruofei, the overbearing President who is currently very popular on the domestic internet. A few days ago, President Xia and Wu Lei were interacting on Weibo. President Xia even posted a photo of the three of them eating together. Today, President Xia came to the stadium to watch the game. It can be seen that their relationship must be very good!”

“I hope that Mr. Zhou and Mr. Xia’s arrival will bring good luck to Wu Lei!” “Let’s take a look at the situation on the field,” Shen fangjian said.”Valekano has the ball now. They’ve pushed along the right side into Spain’s half of the field and are now passing the ball forward ... The pass is a Little Big. Wu Lei is rushing up from the back and has intercepted the ball!”

Shen fangjian’s voice suddenly raised a few octaves,””After Wu Lei intercepted the ball, he directly stepped forward with a big kick and a beautiful man passed the ball! Wu Lei bypassed Vallecano’s right midfielder ... The other side directly fouled and put Wu Lei down! It’s a human pass, but ...”
