Chapter 3814  Destruction before establishment (2)

  The three spirit Heart Flower petals floated in front of Xia ruofei. With a thought, these petals directly stuck to his lower abdomen, which was the closest to his dantian. Once the petals touched Xia ruofei's skin, they were immediately absorbed.

  In the next moment, Xia ruofei felt the injury in his dantian recovering rapidly.

  The entire process might have only taken two to three seconds. After absorbing the petals of the spirit Heart Flower, Xia ruofei immediately took out more purple Yuan crystals from the spirit map space and piled them all around him. Then, he continued to use the "great Dao Sutra".

  The Golden core was broken, and the nascent soul was formed.

  Destruction followed by establishment. Although the process of "destruction" was difficult and dangerous, it was finally completed.

  The next step was the most challenging part of the whole breakthrough process, which tested the cultivator's comprehension and ability. At the same time, it was also the stage that consumed the most cultivation resources.

  It was also the process of 'establishment' after destruction.

  This was also the most crucial stage in the entire process of breaking through.

  Xia ruofei's "great Dao technique" had been changed to a nascent Soul Stage technique. If he continued to use golden core stage techniques, it would be impossible to form a nascent soul.

  Therefore, some cultivators "cultivation methods were relatively ordinary, and some had only reached the jiedan stage, which meant that they would never be able to break through to the Yuanying stage. Unless they found a higher level cultivation method, even if they completed all the previous processes, it was absolutely impossible to complete the Yuanying stage.

  If he tried to break through rashly, he would end up in an awkward situation where his golden core would be broken, but he would not be able to form a nascent soul.

  Once the breakthrough process was stopped, he would naturally become a cripple.

  The "great way of the Dao" and the nascent Soul Stage techniques were still from the same line. Although the route and method of circulation were different, Xia ruofei had cultivated from the Qi refinement stage to the Golden core stage. He was about to break through to the nascent Soul Stage, so he had a very deep understanding of this technique. Thus, even though it was his first time circulating the nascent Soul Stage technique, Xia ruofei did not feel the slightest bit of awkwardness.

  After a few rounds, Xia ruofei was more familiar with the process.

  Next, he began to divide a bit of energy to control the circulation of the technique, while most of his attention was focused on his dantian.

  The cultivation technique of the Yuanying stage still cultivated the vital Qi.

  However, there was no longer any golden elixir in his dantian. The entire dantian was filled with the purplish - Gold golden Elixir's fragments. These fragments were floating in the liquefied elemental essence. Besides, Xia ruofei could also sense a few faint golden lights flickering in the liquefied elemental essence. He could tell that these golden lights were coming from the Dragon - shaped elixir patterns.

  He didn't expect that even though his purplish - Gold golden core had completely exploded, the Dragon - shaped patterns on the surface of the Golden core had been preserved in perfect condition.

  Xia ruofei tried to control the new vital Qi to push the purple - Gold golden core fragments to merge and reorganize.

  This was also the standard operation for forming a nascent soul in the process of breaking through from Jindan to Yuanying. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

  However, during this process, Xia ruofei felt an unprecedented difficulty.

  Xia ruofei felt that the process of accumulating, compressing, and breaking the purplish - Gold golden elixir was not that easy. However, the difficult part was that the workload was relatively heavy. In reality, there was not much resistance. However, at this stage, he clearly felt a great resistance.

  The purplish - Gold golden core fragments were like magnets. After they were broken, they produced a natural repulsive force. Xia ruofei had a hard time putting them together, let alone merging and reassembling them.

  Xia ruofei was caught off guard.

  He cultivated with all his might, constantly absorbing large amounts of spiritual energy to generate vital Qi, but the newly generated vital Qi was still like a cup of water on a burning cart of firewood. It basically couldn't move the purplish - Gold golden core fragments floating in the primordial liquid.

  Xia ruofei felt that the problem did not lie in the amount of vital Qi. He felt that perhaps the purplish - Gold Aurous core was too heaven - defying. The difficulty of forming the nascent soul in the future was exponentially higher than that of forming the nascent soul after the Golden core was broken.

  If he was stuck at this step, it would be a bit of a scam.

  Xia ruofei had already shattered his purplish - Gold golden core. If he could not form a nascent soul, his dantian would gradually dry up once he stopped cultivating. This was an irreversible process and it would happen very quickly. The final result would be that all his previous efforts would be in vain and he would become a cripple.

  Xia ruofei furrowed his brows and continued to practice for another half an hour.

  In this half an hour, Xia ruofei had naturally cultivated more vital Qi. However, it was not of much help in pushing and merging the purple - Gold golden core fragments. Up until now, he could not even let any two pieces of the purple - Gold golden core fragment come into contact.

  At this rate, Xia ruofei would not be able to form his nascent soul even if he cultivated for one or two years.

  This was clearly not a normal phenomenon.

  Xia ruofei sighed to himself. Then, he raised his hand and the Jade bottle not far away from him opened. A crystal clear pill flew out of the Jade bottle and Xia ruofei swallowed it.

  This pill was naturally the nascent formation pill.

  Originally, Xia ruofei didn't want to use the nascent formation pill. He wanted to save as much as he could. To his family and friends, one nascent formation pill might be able to create another original infant stage cultivator.

  However, at this point, Xia ruofei knew that if he did not use the nascent condensation pill, it would be very difficult for him to break through.

  Of course, he could not rule out the possibility that Xia ruofei would continue to cultivate. When his vital Qi had increased to a certain level, the driving force of the purple - Gold golden core fragment would have a qualitative increase.

  However, Xia ruofei didn't want to wait any longer. Since he had obtained the nascent condensation pill by chance, he had to use it when he needed to. He couldn't delay his breakthrough just to save it.

  Xia ruofei knew what was more important.

  The nascent formation pill, as its name suggested, was a pill that helped to condense the nascent soul. In fact, the effect of the nascent formation pill was only at this stage of condensing the nascent soul after the Golden core was broken.

  It was the perfect time for Xia ruofei to take the nascent condensation pill.

  After the soul condensation pill entered his stomach, it immediately turned into a warm current and entered Xia ruofei's dantian. The effect was immediate. Xia ruofei immediately felt that the resistance had become much weaker. He controlled his vital Qi and pushed slightly. The two pieces of the purplish - Gold golden pill touched each other. It was a world of difference compared to before.

  Xia ruofei was overjoyed but at the same time, he was very emotional. No wonder the nascent formation pill was so precious even during the peak of the cultivation world. This pill was a divine weapon for forming the nascent soul!

  He calmed his mind and tried to merge the two purple - Gold golden core fragments together.

  With the help of the nascent condensation pill, the fusion process was also very smooth.

  A few minutes later, the two purplish - Gold golden cores had completely fused into one.

  Xia ruofei continued to push another purplish - Gold golden elixir fragment over and fused it with the fragment.

  Xia ruofei was like a hard - working ant, pushing the purplish - Gold golden core fragments bit by bit and then merging them together.

  In the center of his dantian, in the sea formed by the essence liquid, the fused purplish - Gold golden core fragment grew larger and larger, while the number of purplish - Gold golden core fragments around it also decreased.

  However, after about one - third of the fragments had been fused, Xia ruofei felt the resistance increase again.

  He couldn't help sighing secretly. It was much more difficult for his purple - Gold golden core to break through to the nascent Soul Stage than for ordinary golden core cultivators. He knew very well that the medicinal effect of a nascent formation pill was about to be exhausted.

  Xia ruofei knew very well that it would not be so difficult for an ordinary cultivator to break through to the nascent Soul Stage. Otherwise, Chen Nanfeng would not have had any chance of success when he broke through.

  Xia ruofei did not hesitate. He took another nascent formation pill and swallowed it ...
