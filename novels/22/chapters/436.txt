Chapter 437: The past (1)

Tian Huilan was leaning back in her chair, resting with her eyes closed. Her hands were gently rubbing her temples, and her face revealed a tired expression.

She opened her eyes when she heard footsteps. Her gaze swept past Lu You and landed on Xia ruofei.

Tian Huilan revealed a kind smile and said,””RUO Fei is here!”

“Good day, Secretary Tian!” Xia ruofei said in a neutral tone.

He couldn’t help but take another look at Tian Huilan. Although Tian Huilan looked tired, she looked much younger than before. Lu You also used the jaded skin cream, but she was born beautiful and, more importantly, she was so young. Hence, the contrast wasn’t very obvious. Strictly speaking, this was the first time Xia ruofei had seen the magical effects of his jaded skin cream.

“Ruofei,” Tian Huilan said with a smile,”the cosmetics you gave me last time were very effective. Thank you!”

“You’re welcome. It’s just a small token of my appreciation. ” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Tian Huilan had been talking to Xia ruofei the entire time and completely treated Lu You as air.

Lu You felt uneasy all over. She knew that her mother must be very angry this time and had also expected to be scolded by Tian Huilan the moment she entered the office. However, there was nothing. Tian Huilan just treated her as if she did not exist.

This made Lu You’s heart feel even more uneasy, because this meant that Tian Huilan’s anger was stronger than any other time she had caused trouble.

“Mom ...” Lu You couldn’t help but call out weakly.

Tian Huilan was still smiling as she asked Xia ruofei about the farm’s recent situation. Xia ruofei was embarrassed. He didn’t know whether he should answer or not.

Lu You raised her voice and shouted,””Mom!”

Only then did Tian Huilan sweep a glance at Lu You. The smile on her face was completely wiped away as she said indifferently,””You go out first, I have something to say to RUO Fei.”

“Mom ...” Lu You lowered her head slightly and said,”if you’re angry, you can scold me ... Don’t ignore me.”

“I told you to leave, didn’t you hear me?” Tian Huilan’s tone was still calm.

“Oh!” Lu You answered pitifully. Then, she took another look at Xia ruofei before turning to leave the office.

After Lu You left, Tian Huilan sighed and said,””Ruofei, don’t just stand there. Come and sit ...”

Tian Huilan then pressed the call button on the table and ordered,”Little Xiao, bring in a cup of tea.”

Then, Tian Huilan stood up and brought Xia ruofei to the reception area in front of the French windows on the south side of the office. The two of them sat down on the sofa. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Xiao Mei quickly knocked on the door and entered the office with a cup of tea. She gently placed the cup in front of Xia ruofei and carefully turned the cup handle to Xia ruofei’s direction.

Then, Xiao Mei walked to the desk, picked up Tian Huilan’s Cup, and filled it up with water from the water dispenser. She also brought it to the reception area and placed it in front of Tian Huilan.

After that, Xiao Mei quietly left the office and gently closed the door.

It could be seen that Xiao Mei was getting more and more comfortable with the service guarantee work, and she had matured a lot in terms of dealing with people and other things. She was no longer the young and inexperienced new Secretary.

Working beside a big leader would improve one’s personal ability and quality very quickly.

After Xiao Mei left, Tian Huilan sighed and said,”RUO Fei, it’s all thanks to you again! Otherwise, Youyou will be in danger ...”

“Secretary Tian,” Xia ruofei said awkwardly,”I didn’t report Lu You’s matter to you in time. It’s my fault.”

“This is a small matter,” Tian Huilan waved her hand and said,”you saved Youyou. I can’t thank you enough!” Why would I blame you? Besides ... Youyou must have told you not to say it! This child is getting more and more worrisome!”

Xia ruofei laughed drily. He thought to himself,”since Secretary Tian is so preconceived, I’ll let Lu You take the blame. Anyway, Lu You doesn’t have to worry about her debts. Besides, they’re mother and daughter. There won’t be any overnight grudges.”

Tian Huilan continued,”although Youyou was a little unruly in the past, she was still a well – behaved child. This time, she actually went to a bar and was alone!” I’m so disappointed. How did she become like this? Could it be that I don’t care about her enough?”

Ever since Tian Huilan found out that Lu You almost got into an accident at the bar, she had been reflecting on herself in her office. As her position became higher and higher, her work also became busier and busier. Naturally, the time she spent with her daughter and family became less and less. She didn’t know if this was the reason why Lu You had become more rebellious.

Xia ruofei was a little embarrassed and didn’t know how to respond to Tian Huilan.

However, it was not appropriate to be silent at this time. Xia ruofei pondered for a while and said,””Secretary Tian, perhaps ... Lu You is just curious ... And wants to try something new! I don’t think it’s as serious as you said. ”

Tian Huilan sighed and waved her hand,”Forget it, let’s not talk about this ...”

Then, she calmed herself down and asked,””Ruofei, you seem to be on good terms with the child of the head judge of the province, Song Jin, right?”

Xia ruofei’s heart skipped a beat. He didn’t know why Tian Huilan would suddenly ask this question.

His mind turned quickly,”did she notice something?” I swear to God, I didn’t do anything at all in this matter. It’s mainly because both song Rui and Lu You were strongly against the marriage alliance and had no feelings for each other at all. It was all you elders who randomly matched the couple!
