Chapter 907: The aura of the world stone (1)

Translator: 549690339

After Xia ruofei entered the Archean realm, he didn’t see Xia Qing. He should be busy with work in the mountain and sea realm.

Now, Xia Qing’s work was also very heavy. She had to take care of the herb garden, cut the Dendrobium candids, expand the planting area, cut succulent plants, and take care of the two acres of land where the Cordyceps sinensis was cultivated.

Furthermore, Xia Qing would frequently travel between the mountain sea realm and the Archean realm. This was because the abalone reared in the Archean realm needed to change the seawater at regular intervals. Furthermore, there were many crops in the Archean realm that needed to be taken care of.

However, when Xia ruofei entered the space, Xia Qing would sense it. Hence, his figure quickly appeared at the Archean realm. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Master, you’re here!” Xia Qing greeted him respectfully.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”okay, go do your work!” I’m fine here. ”

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing said,”I was just about to change the water for these abalones.”

“How’s the abalone growing recently?”Xia ruofei asked with interest.

“Master, it’s growing very well.” Xia Qing replied,”at this rate, it should be able to reach the level of a one – headed abalone in a few days!”

“Good job!” Xia ruofei said happily,”go do your work! When the size of the abalone exceeds the standard size of a one – Head abalone, remember to inform me. At that time, you can directly put them in the sea of the mountain sea realm! This way, you won’t need to change the water frequently. ”

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing would definitely obey Xia ruofei’s orders.

The growth curve of abalones was more and more gentle. The bigger the abalones, the more difficult it was for them to continue growing.

The time it took to grow from a two – headed abalone to a one – headed abalone might be longer than the time it took to grow from an abalone fry to a two – headed abalone.

After reaching the standard of a one – headed abalone, the speed of growth would be even slower.

These 30 abalones were just experimental products in the Archean realm. When they grew to the size of a one – headed abalone, there would be no need to continue using the speed of time. Furthermore, Xia ruofei could not keep them forever. One – headed abalones were already a heaven – defying existence. He could find a time to cash them out.

Of course, one – headed abalone was extremely precious. As for how to sell it, he would have to plan it carefully.

Xia Qing walked to the big orange plastic box where the reticulated abalones were kept. Then, in a flash, she disappeared from the Archean realm along with the box. Xia Qing could also use part of the invisible spatial power to freely shuttle between two spaces.

Of course, he had to get Xia ruofei’s permission.

It was like a supercomputer. Although it was powerful, without instructions that were allowed to be executed, it could not even run the simple four – arithmetic operations.

After Xia Qing left, Xia ruofei’s attention was focused on the strange poison on his fingertips.

With a slight thought, he forced the poison out of his body without any effort.

In the spirit map space, Xia ruofei had absolute control over it. Hence, after the poison was expelled, it did not dissipate. Instead, it was wrapped tightly by an invisible force and hovered in front of Xia ruofei.

The target of the poison was very small, just a small black dot. Xia ruofei’s eyesight was amazing, or else he wouldn’t have found it so easily.

In fact, this black dot, which was about the size of a needle, was made up of dozens of tiny black particles. If they were scattered in space, they would not be visible to the naked eye.

That was why Song Wei and the other members of the archeological team had fallen for it without them knowing.

Xia ruofei extended his spiritual power and locked onto the tiny black particles. Then, he removed the spatial restraint on them.

He discovered that these black particles immediately became very active in an environment rich in spirit Qi, and began to dissipate in all directions.

In the process of dissipation, these black particles seemed to be absorbing the spiritual Qi in the space, allowing themselves to slowly grow.

Xia ruofei’s spiritual power was locked on to the black particles, so he could clearly feel the process of them growing.

Very quickly, the black particles had dispersed to a radius of five to six meters and were almost invisible to the naked eye. Xia ruofei did not use his spatial power to retrieve them and continued to observe.

After a while, Xia ruofei’s spiritual power finally noticed that one of the black particles had grown to a certain extent and then split into two identical particles.

In other words, these black particles could reproduce and grow in the spirit map space.

He just didn’t know if this phenomenon was caused by the rich spirit Qi in the space or if they had this ability.

Xia ruofei continued to observe for a while. Dozens of black particles started to split one after another. The number of poisonous particles had almost doubled.

At this moment, Xia ruofei’s mind moved. The invisible spatial force immediately bound these black particles and then rapidly compressed them.

Under the power of absolute control, the black particle had no chance of resisting. It was quickly compressed into a very small area by the spatial power, forming a black dot that was visible to the naked eye.

This black dot was about twice as big as before.

Xia ruofei was ready to return to his room in the outside world and release them to see if they would continue to grow.

If it could still be used in the outside world, then this poison would be a bit terrifying.

Although the archeological team had sealed off the main burial chamber, no one could guarantee that the invisible poison would not leak out at all.

If the poison were to slowly accumulate and grow in the outside world, it would cause great harm to the surrounding people.

The most terrifying thing was that this poison was invisible and odorless, and there was no way to guard against it.

Now, Xia ruofei could only use the petals of the spirit Heart Flower to get rid of the poison. If it caused a large – scale infection, he would not have enough petals no matter how many he had.

At the thought of this, Xia ruofei couldn’t wait any longer. He immediately prepared to return to the outside world and observe in a normal environment to see if the poison would reproduce on its own.

At this moment, Xia Qing brought the large orange plastic box back to the spatial spirit pond at the primal realm.

In fact, the time he took to change the water in the orange plastic box was very short. It was just that there was a 30 times difference in time flow between the two spaces, so Xia ruofei had to study it for a while before Xia Qing brought the plastic box with the water changed.

After Xia Qing placed the plastic box by the pool, she quickly walked towards Xia ruofei.

“Master, the water has been changed.” Xia Qing said.

Xia ruofei’s mind was focused on the unknown poison. He nodded and said,””You’ve worked hard ...”

He then prepared to leave the spirit map space.

At this time, Xia Qing’s eyes suddenly focused on the tiny black dot in front of Xia ruofei. She said in surprise,””Master, this ...”

Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows and quickly asked,””Xia Qing, do you recognize this thing?”

“I don ‘t, but ... I can feel the aura of a world stone on it ...” Xia Qing shook her head.

“This is impossible!” Xia ruofei cried out,”I’ve been wearing the sensing Jade Leaf! There’s no reaction at all. ”

“Master, the aura of the world stone inside is extremely weak. The formation I’ve set up won’t be able to sense it,” Xia Qing said.

Xia ruofei felt excited and asked,””In that case, these black particles might be substances that fell from the world stone?”

Xia Qing also revealed a perplexed expression and said,””I can’t be sure because its aura is extremely strange. Other than the faint aura of the world stone, there’s also a cold and evil aura. It’s impossible for the world stone to come with it.”

Xia ruofei said thoughtfully,”these strange particles come from the main chamber of an ancient tomb. There have been people who have been attacked by these black particles after entering the main chamber. They have shown symptoms of fainting. The most serious person has already passed away.”

Xia Qing also fell into deep thought, just like a computer entering search mode.

After a long while, he raised his head and said,”master, there must be a world stone in that tomb!” As for these black particles, there’s a possibility that the ancient tomb was located in an extreme Yin place. A portion of the matter on the world stone’s surface peeled off over the long years and became its current state after being contaminated with Yin Qi. ”

When Xia ruofei heard that there was a realm stone in the tomb, he was first overjoyed. Then, he asked in confusion,””As far as I know, it’s an ancient tomb from the Ming Dynasty, which is at most 700 to 800 years old. The world stone shouldn’t be unable to withstand even a few hundred years, right?”

Xia ruofei was well aware of the wonders of the world stone. Under that unremarkable black surface, it contained a large amount of energy and spiritual Qi. Such a magical thing should not be so fragile!

Xia Qing said,”master, it’s possible that the boundary stone already existed before the ancient tomb was built. The tomb of the Ming Dynasty was just built on top of it ... Moreover, the place of extreme Yin is not suitable to be a tomb. The existence of this tomb is very strange ...”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”if there’s a chance, I’ll go to the Ming Dynasty Tomb to take a look!”

“Yes, master,” Xia Qing agreed. At the very least, there’s a high possibility that there’s a world stone there. If the spirit map world can absorb another world stone, the possibility of completing this evolution is very high. ”

“Didn’t you say that the world stone was tainted with a cold and evil aura?” Xia ruofei asked.

“That should only be a portion of the material on the world stone’s surface.” Xia Qing said,”the world stone itself is extremely sturdy. It is very difficult for ordinary Yin Qi to corrode it.”

“Oh, right ...” Xia ruofei suddenly remembered and asked,”since these black particles also contain the aura of the realm stone, can the spirit map world absorb them?”

If absorbing the black particles helped the spirit map space evolve, Xia ruofei could continue to cultivate the Pi Xiu in the outside world. Even if they could not reproduce in the outside world, Xia ruofei could find some experimental animals, such as white mice, and implant the black particles into the bodies of the animals. When they reproduced to a certain scale, he could harvest them all at once for the spirit map space to absorb.

This was equivalent to having a fixed source of energy. It was much easier to obtain than the world stone that could only be found by chance.

More importantly, if the spirit map space could absorb these small black particles, Xia ruofei would have a way to deal with them even if the poison in the ancient tomb leaked out due to the last archaeological discovery and multiplied in the outside world.

This made Xia ruofei look forward to it.
