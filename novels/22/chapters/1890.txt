Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei also reminded himself to avoid going to the Western restaurant in the corner ...

To Xia ruofei’s fans on Tieba, today was obviously a good day. Not only did Xia ruofei’s real body appear on Tieba, but they also saw photos and autographs of him and his fans. There was enough information.

Xia ruofei had given everyone the impression that he was young, promising, and very responsible. Most of his fans had become fans because of the qishang incident. Through today’s posts, Xia ruofei’s image in their hearts had become more down – to – Earth and full of flesh and blood.

……

The next morning, when Xia ruofei arrived at the peach blossom building, he met Feng Jing at the elevator on the first floor.

As soon as she saw Xia ruofei, Feng Rao smiled and said,””Chairman, you’ve finally been enlightened ... Your interaction with your fans yesterday was great! You have to keep it up in the future!”

Maintain a string! Xia ruofei couldn’t help rolling his eyes.

However, he couldn’t say that all of this was Ling Qingxue’s doing, so he wisely remained silent and quickly changed the topic.

“President Feng, let’s not talk about me. Have you contacted Hengfeng?” Xia ruofei asked.

“I was just about to report to your office!” Feng Jing replied immediately.

At this moment, the elevator arrived. Xia ruofei said,””Let’s talk while we walk!”

The two of them walked into the elevator on the top floor and the elevator quickly went up. Feng Jing also said,””I got in touch with Hengfeng yesterday. Hengfeng’s Chairman MA is very interested in your proposal. He immediately said that Hengfeng auction house will do its best to support this auction! “Boss Ma also asked us to send a liaison over as soon as possible to participate in the preliminary preparation work ...”

Xia ruofei had expected the Hengfeng group’s attitude. He nodded and said,””Sure! It’s good that we send people over earlier to get involved in the preparatory work! But ... You don’t have to go early this time. After all, there are a lot of things to do at home, and it’s hard to go on a business trip. ”

“Then who do you think is suitable?” Feng Rao nodded slightly. Director Dong definitely can’t leave so early. The work in the headquarters building has just begun to get on track. As the Executive Director, she should be in charge of the company at this time. ”

“I’ll leave the problem of the candidates to you!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I’m not as familiar with the people below as you are!”

“Ruofei, it’s not just unfamiliarity, right?” Feng Rao pursed her lips and smiled. I see that you can’t even remember the names of many of the middle management!”

“Don’t tear it down when it’s hard, okay?” Xia ruofei smiled bitterly.”Do you have anyone in mind?”

“Ruofei, what do you think about letting Liu Qian go?” Feng Rao asked after some thought.

Xia ruofei looked at Feng Rao and asked,””Sister ran, are you going to put Liu Qian down?”

Feng Jing laughed,”that’s a thought indeed. There are pros and cons to working by my side. After all, she’s the CEO’s assistant right from the start, so she’s not very familiar with many of the positions under her. For her future development, it’s a good choice to train in other positions!”

Indeed, if one had been working with a leader all the time, they might have a better view of the overall situation than the bottom – Level employees, but they would be relatively lacking in specific work experience.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”you can make your own decision!” As for going to Hong Kong to meet with Hengfeng ... If you think Liu Qian is suitable, then let her go. Such a job is very good for improving coordination skills! It’s good to train in advance!”

Although Liu Qian was a little inexperienced, the task of going to Hong Kong to meet with Hengfeng was not particularly heavy. Hengfeng group would definitely cooperate well, so Liu Qian did not need to do much coordination work.

“Alright then! Just let Liu Qian go!” Feng Jing quickly made a decision,”Oh right, ruofei, when will the ingredients and herbs you mentioned yesterday be ready?” We’re going to shoot some material in advance to provide Hengfeng with publicity, as well as various materials and videos for the day of the auction!”

Xia ruofei said,”other than truffles, the other ingredients can be served at any time.” How about this! I’ll bring some samples to the company tomorrow, and you can let the photographer from the e – commerce Department shoot the materials!”

Truffles could only be kept for a short time, so they had to wait until the auction was about to start before they could be taken out. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

If they had taken it out ten days in advance, even if they had used the best preservation methods, most of the truffles would have gone bad by the day of the auction.

“Alright!” Feng Jing said happily,”I’ll arrange this work in the morning!”

When the elevator reached the top floor, Xia ruofei and Feng Jing returned to their respective offices.

Not long after work, a female employee who had been temporarily transferred from the administration department to be Xia ruofei’s assistant knocked on the door and came in to announce that Lei Hu had come and wanted to meet Xia ruofei.

“Then let him in!” Xia ruofei nodded.

Very quickly, Lei Hu strode into Xia ruofei’s office and said,””Brother Xia, the money has been transferred to their accounts as you instructed. They’ve already started the preparation work today. If the purchasing of equipment and used cars goes well, they’ll be able to devote themselves to work in a day or two at most.”

Then, Lei Hu took out a phone and handed it to Xia ruofei, saying,””Brother Xia, Xu Yougang asked me to pass this to you! For the sake of safety, you can use this phone to contact Xu Yougang and the others during this period! If anything happens, they’ll call this phone to contact you. Xu Yougang and the others ‘numbers are already saved in it. ”

Xia ruofei took a closer look. It was a very retro – looking Nokia phone. This type of phone was very rare. Other than making calls and sending text messages, it had almost no other functions. Nokia was once the Overlord of the mobile phone industry, but now it had gradually fallen to the second or third level.

Xia ruofei fiddled with the old Nokia phone and smiled.””Not bad! Xu Yougang is really cautious!”

“People in our line of work are all like this!” Lei Hu smiled and said,”brother Xia, if there’s nothing else, I’ll take my leave!”

“Okay, go do your work!” Xia ruofei said.

After Lei Hu left, Xia ruofei put his phone aside.

He was about to turn on his computer to browse the news when his phone rang.

Xia ruofei saw that it was Wu Liqian and immediately picked up. He laughed and said,””Good Morning, sister Qian!”

“You bad boy!” Wu Liqian said. Didn’t I tell you to keep my secret? Why did you tell Secretary Tian? I was scolded by her on the phone for half a day!”

Although Tian Huilan had been promoted, Wu Liqian was still used to calling her “Secretary Tian.”

“So, sister Qian, you’ve already received the notice for the training?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

“Mm! I’m flying off this afternoon. ” Wu Liqian said,”the training class is about to start. I have to go there as soon as possible!”

“This is a good thing!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”at least you can have peace and quiet for two months!”

“That’s true!” Wu Liqian was obviously in a good mood. She continued,”but don’t expect me to thank you! I haven’t even pursued the matter with you yet!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”yes, yes, yes!” It’s all my fault ... Sister Qian, this was all aunt Tian’s work. If you want to thank someone, you should thank her!”

“That’s for sure!”Wu Liqian said. But ... When I think about how Secretary Tian will definitely criticize me to my face when I go to Beijing, my heart is in a mess ...”

“What are you afraid of? Don’t tell me that Auntie Tian will eat you up?” Xia ruofei said,”Oh right, what time is your flight in the afternoon? I’ll send you off!”

“You don’t need to send me off. The airport is very close to my place, so I’ll just leave directly!” Wu Liqian said.

At this moment, Xia ruofei’s Nokia phone on the table started vibrating. Xia ruofei immediately said,””It’s settled then. I’ll send you off in the afternoon and prepare a few portions of jaded skin cream for aunt Tian. I don’t think she’ll be able to bear to criticize you anymore! Sister Qian, I still have something to do, so I’ll hang up first! Remember to send me your flight number!”

Then, Xia ruofei hung up the phone without waiting for Wu Liqian’s reply.

Then he picked up his Nokia and answered the call.
