Chapter 3800  Miniature Immortal Island (2)

  "Wei Wei, what do you think?" Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

  Song Wei pondered for a moment and said,"my opinion is similar to Qingxue 's. However, it doesn't seem easy to ensure safety. Not only do we have to avoid the ordinary people in the secular world, but if a cultivator happens to pass by, they may also detect green travel Immortal Island. I don't know how strong the defense of the immortal Island is ..."

  "I have an idea," Xia ruofei chuckled."It can ensure our safety and privacy while making it easier for us to enter and exit at any time."

  "What method? Quickly tell me!" Ling Qingxue asked impatiently.

  Xia ruofei smiled but did not say anything. He looked around and then brought Song Wei and Ling Qingxue to the balcony that was connected to the living room.

  Then, he took out the green Immortal Island, which had shrunk to the size of his palm, and threw it up. The green Immortal Island immediately began to expand slowly until it almost covered the entire terrace. Xia ruofei then controlled the mansion - guarding wooden token with his mind, and the green Immortal Island stopped changing.

  Then, green travel Immortal Island slowly descended and was firmly placed on the terrace.

  "What do you guys think of this?" Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

  "Ah?" Ling Qingxue was taken aback and couldn't help but say,"this is much smaller than the actual size of green travel Immortal Island! It's like a miniature model. Look ... The wooden houses built by the survivors are only the size of matchboxes. How are we going to get on the island?"

  "Where do you guys think I should put it?" Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

  Ling Qingxue replied without hesitation,"of course, it'd be best if it's near the Peach Blossom Island!" It'll be more convenient for us to go over! Of course, the premise is to ensure safety and not be discovered by ordinary people in the secular world. "

  "Wei Wei, what do you think?" Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

  "What do you guys think of this?" Xia ruofei asked with a smile.
