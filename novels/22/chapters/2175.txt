2176 Curve back to the country (2)

Tang Yitian immediately said happily,””That’s great! Haoran also often talks about you, his master! When will you be there? I’ll arrange for a car to pick you up at the airport ...”

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly and said,””Big brother Tang, I didn’t come by plane this time. I can’t explain the details in a few words. Let’s put it this way ... I didn’t enter the country through the proper channels ...”

Tang Yitian was stunned for a moment, then he lowered his voice and said,””RUO Fei, is there something that is inconvenient for you to enter the country? Don’t worry, I still have a lot of brothers in Australia! I can help you solve both the legal and illegal matters ...”

“That’s not it!” Xia ruofei quickly said,”big brother Tang, it’s like this ... I did come to Australia to settle some things, but I don’t need to trouble you. I can handle it myself. However, I need you to help me get a legal identity. It’s best if it’s an Australian Chinese identity.”

“No problem! Just leave it to me!” Tang Yitian said.

“For some reason, I’ll disguise myself. I’ll send the photo to your email in a while. I’ll leave the identity to you ... Oh, I also need this identity to enter China directly. Is that okay?” Xia ruofei asked.

“Of course, no problem!” Tang Yitian chuckled.”I’ll make you an employee of our company and send you to work in China. I have friends in the Embassy, you don’t even need to go there yourself, I can get the visa!”

“That’s great!” Xia ruofei said,”big brother Tang, I’ll be at POLH in about three to four days. I want to return to Huaxia as soon as possible ...”

Tang Yitian pondered for a moment, then said,””Three days is enough! Ruofei, ruofei, if you’re not in a hurry to go back, I’ll have someone wait for you in Persia and take you directly to Sydney. Haoran misses you a lot ...”

“Time is a little tight this time. I’ll go see him next time if I have the chance!” Xia ruofei said after some thought.

“Alright then! Since you’re in a hurry to go back, then how about this! After I’ve settled your identification documents, I’ll transfer my private plane to Persia, and you can fly back to the country directly from there!” Tang Yitian said.

Xia ruofei really wanted to return to Huaxia as soon as possible, so he didn’t stand on ceremony with Tang Yitian. He said,””That’s fine. Thank you, big brother Tang!”

“Why are you being so polite with me?” Tang Yitian laughed. RUO Fei, please send me the photos as soon as possible!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said.

After hanging up the phone, Xia ruofei immediately changed his appearance and took out a single-lens reflex camera from the space to take a few photos.

As the background of the photos was on a yacht, Xia ruofei took out his laptop and downloaded the photos. He used the Photoshop software to remove the background and only left the portrait.

Then, Xia ruofei sent the original files to Tang Yitian’s email. This way, he could adjust the background color of the photo whenever he wanted to make the ID.

After sending the photos, Xia ruofei used the maritime satellite phone to call Tang Yitian.

The next few days would be a lonely voyage.

In order to save time, the yacht did not stop almost every day. Just like that, it followed the set route and let the automatic driving system control the yacht to move forward.

Only when the fuel was almost used up would Xia ruofei stop to rest and reorganize. He would also take out an oil barrel from the medium to refuel the yacht.

On the third day, as they were close to Australia’s territorial waters, Xia ruofei became more cautious. He first filled the yacht’s mailbox on the International waters. By the time the yacht reached Australia, 90% of the fuel had been consumed. There were less than 10 tons of fuel left.

Then, Xia ruofei disconnected from the autopilot and switched to manual control, carefully sailing toward Persia.

Because after entering Australian waters, the Coast Guard’s ships could appear at any time.

A yacht of unknown origin and nationality would definitely be investigated.

Hence, Xia ruofei had to avoid the inspection as much as possible and get as close to the coastline as possible.

Therefore, he had chosen a section of the coast that was unpopulated. This place was densely covered with reefs and was not suitable for ships to sail at all.

Xia ruofei’s spiritual power could cover a larger area, which helped him avoid the inspection of the ship.

After going around in a circle, Xia ruofei finally got close to the shore.

Night had just fallen, and he could already see the outline of the coast.

The chart showed that the reef area was just ahead. If the yacht continued to move forward, it was likely to hit the reef or get stranded.

Hence, Xia ruofei stopped the yacht.

He first tidied up his things, putting the GPS, cell phone, satellite phone, and other items into a small bag and kept it in his interspace. In order to prevent being located, he even turned off his phone and took out the battery.

Then, Xia ruofei went to the deck and changed into a shark skin swimsuit from the medium.

He looked back at the coastline in the distance, then jumped into the sea in a beautiful arc.

At the same time, with a thought from Xia ruofei, the 30 – meter long yacht suddenly disappeared from the sea.

Xia ruofei shook his head to get used to the dizziness caused by the huge consumption of his mental power. Then, he swam towards the shore.

The sea in this area was full of reefs and high cliffs, so there were basically no patrols.

Xia ruofei swam for a full hour before he landed on solid ground at the bottom of the cliff.

Even though he had excellent physical strength, he couldn’t help panting slightly when he swam to the shore at low tide. In order to get ashore under the cover of the night, he could only choose this time. It just so happened that it was low tide time, and most of his physical strength was used to resist the power of the receding tide.

Xia ruofei took a break and took off his shark skin swimsuit at the bottom of the cliff. Then, he quickly changed into a set of clean clothes and took out the small bag that contained the satellite phone.

Xia ruofei dialed Tang Yitian’s number with the satellite phone.

This time, Tang Yitian picked up quickly,””Ruofei, have you arrived at Persia?”

“Mm! Big brother Tang! “My location is ...” Xia ruofei gave an address.

He had already chosen a landing point, so he didn’t need to check the GPS.

Xia ruofei said,”there’s a cliff here. We should be on Route 67 after crossing the cliff. I’ll be waiting by the road later.” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Alright!” Tang Yitian said, ” the car will be here soon! You can wait by the road.”

Xia ruofei had contacted Tang Yitian after confirming the landing point, so the people he had sent were already on standby nearby.

After Xia ruofei put the satellite phone away, he carried his backpack and agilely climbed up the cliff.

This cliff was hit by the sea water during high tide all year round. There were many holes on the cliff. Xia ruofei used these holes and the protrusions on the cliff to borrow strength. He was like an agile monkey as he quickly climbed up the cliff.

After a while, he arrived at the top of the cliff.

Xia ruofei looked around and saw a road not far away.

He ran over and easily climbed over the guardrail. Then, he walked along the road for a while and found a kilometer sign.

So Xia ruofei called Tang Yitian and told him where he was.

With this kilometer plate, the people sent by Tang Yitian would be easy to find.

Xia ruofei waited for about 20 minutes before he saw a Toyota Elfa commercial car driving over slowly.

The car stopped beside him. The driver rolled down the window and looked at Xia ruofei seriously. Then, he asked in Chinese, ” “May I ask if you’re Mr. Tang Fei? ”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment before he realized that’ Tang Fei’ was the name Tang Yitian had applied for for his new identity.

Hence, Xia ruofei nodded and said,” it’s me. Did big brother Tang send you here? ” You’ve worked hard!”
