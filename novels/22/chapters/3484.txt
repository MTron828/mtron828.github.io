Chapter 3486: It’s better to have less trouble (2)

Translator: 549690339

At this point, Chen Xuan paused for a moment before continuing,””Most importantly, with Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue’s strength, even if they were teleported to the same space as elder Shen, they would not be able to kill him. If a conflict were to break out between the two parties, the one who would die would definitely be Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue, not elder Shen!”

After listening to Chen Xuan’s analysis, Chen Nanfeng nodded his head slightly and said,””Xuan ‘er’s words make sense, but we can’t rule out the possibility of what yurou said. In theory, if Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue were teleported together, elder Shen would be teleported with someone else. It might not be Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue. What if it was a Willow? It was possible that elder Shen would be caught off guard and be ambushed. It’s even possible that he was teleported together with mu Hua from the vast waves sect and for some reason, the two of them got into a conflict and ended up perishing together. These are all possible.”

“Father, this is just a guess,” Chen Xuan replied with a bitter smile.”We’ll probably never get an answer.” Unless …”

“Unless we extort a confession from Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue,” Chen Nanfeng said,”if we can find out if they were teleported to the same space, we might be able to find new clues …”

After Chen Nanfeng finished, he shook his head and said,””This young man Xia ruofei gives me a very mysterious feeling. If it’s not necessary, 1 don’t want to be his enemy… Forget it, let’s put an end to this! Even if we find any clues, can we really use all the power of the sect to avenge elder Chen?”

Although Shen Tian’s position in the first heaven society was important, he was already dead. In Chen Nanfeng’s opinion, it was not worth it to fight for a dead person and even risk the sect’s strength to take revenge for him.

Of course, if Shen tianfang was clearly murdered, then even if the losses were huge, they would still take action when the time came. The dignity of the number one sect in the cultivation world still had to be maintained. Furthermore, if they were to hide in such a situation, the hearts of the people within the sect would be scattered. A sect without unity would not go far.

However, Shen tianfang had died in the secret realm, and according to everyone, there was no man – made factor at all. Thus, Chen Nanfeng naturally chose to go with the flow.

Chen Xuan and Xu yurou both nodded. They could guess that Chen Nanfeng would most likely make this decision.

Chen Nanfeng continued,”however, we still have to investigate what needs to be investigated. We can keep an eye on the people who returned safely. Other than Xuan ‘er and yurou, everyone else is a suspect. We have to keep an eye on these people. Perhaps we can find some clues … I have a feeling that elder Shen’s death isn’t as simple as it seems.”

“I understand, father.” Chen Xuan replied,”after we return to the sect, I’ll arrange for someone to look for clues.”

Chen Nanfeng nodded and said,”let’s do this first!” It’s getting late, you should all go rest!”

In addition to Chen Nanfeng’s side, the villa where Liu Mansha and Mu Sheng lived was also experiencing a similar scene.

Of course, there were no casualties in the soaring Flower Valley, so Liu Mansha was not too concerned about the cause of Shen tianfang and mu Hua’s deaths. She only asked for some simple details, but her focus was still on the gains from this trip.

Mu Sheng, on the other hand, had asked mu Jianfei about the whole incident in detail. Of course, they also had no clue about mu Hua’s death.

Fortunately, everyone’s harvest on this trip was very good, and Liu Mansha and Mu Sheng were also quite satisfied.

The black Phoenix flying ship was flying at high speed through the night sky.

Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue stood on the deck of the swift Boat. Ling Qingxue looked at the dark night sky and asked,””RUO Fei, the first heaven society won’t send people to follow us, will they?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”even if Chen Nanfeng had his suspicions, he wouldn’t have made it so obvious. Besides, with the speed of the black Blaze flying ship, we won’t be able to keep up with them!”

“We must keep our mouths shut about us clearing the stage together!” Ling Qingxue said,”both sects have lost their elders. If they find out that we can be teleported to the same space, they will definitely suspect us!”

Xia ruofei said,”in fact, we can’t rule out the possibility that the two of them really died during the mission in the Tower of Trials or that they were killed.” In theory, we could have teleported together, and the others could have done the same. However, only Yang Liu and mu Hua had the ability to kill Shen tianfang. Unless Shen tianfang was injured, he would have been the one to die. H

Ling Qingxue agreed and nodded.””So it’s best to stop this matter. If we say that cultivators can be teleported together, things will become very complicated, and it’s very likely that we’ll get burned. RUO Fei, you must remember not to let it slip.”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded,”! know!” The less trouble, the better! However, if there’s really trouble, we’re not afraid of it. Whoever dares to provoke us should be prepared to lose a layer of their skin!”

With Xia ruofei’s current strength, he was confident that he could seriously injure the first heaven society even if they attacked him with the entire sect.

If it was a one – on – one fight, Xia ruofei was confident that he could at least escape unscathed, even if he was up against Chen Nanfeng, who had the Golden armor and spiritual power of spiritualization realm.

“Where are we going now?” Ling Qingxue nodded and asked.

“Let’s go to Beijing first! Pick Wei Wei up and go directly to the Peach Blossom Island.” Xia ruofei said,”I haven’t been to Paradise Island for more than two months. I wonder how things are there now.”

“Good! 1 haven’t seen you for such a long time, and 1 miss you too!” Ling Qingxue said,”she must be worried about us every day! Ruofei, if there’s a town down there, please land the airboat first. I’ll send a message to Weiwei and tell her to come out and wait for us!” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

At a high altitude, there was basically no signal on the mobile phone, so if he wanted to send a WeChat message, he would definitely have to lower his altitude. It was best to do it in a town area, as the signal might not be so good in the wilderness.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”no problem!” There’s a small town ahead. I will land the airboat first!”

Soon, the black Phoenix flying ship began to slow down and slowly descended. It hovered above a barren land outside the town, about a dozen meters above the ground.

After the formation was opened, ordinary people would not be able to see the black Phoenix flying ship at all. Hence, there was no need to worry about being discovered by the people of the town at such a low altitude.

Ling Qingxue took out her phone and gave Song Wei a WeChat call.

Although it was already late at night, Song Wei was a cultivator. She could wake up quickly with the slightest movement. So, when she opened her eyes and saw that the call was from Ling Qingxue, she quickly stood up and picked up the phone.

Song Wei was staying in the school dormitory tonight. The postgraduate dormitory was two people to a room. However, her dormitory mate and boyfriend went out to play and didn’t come back to the dormitory at all, so she didn’t have to worry about what her dormmate might hear.

“Qingxue! You guys are back?” Song Wei asked excitedly.

Ling Qingxue chuckled and said,”that’s right!” Weiwei, we just came back and called you as soon as we landed. We were afraid that you would be worried!”

Song Wei had been very worried these days. Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue were going to the moon, which was hundreds of thousands of miles away! The universe was filled with all kinds of unknown dangers, and there was also a barren moon. Just thinking about it was terrifying.

The two of them had been gone for more than two months. Song Wei did not pass the music selection at all, so she could only stay on earth and wait anxiously. This feeling was quite torturous.

“It’s good that you’re back! It’s good that you’re back!” Song Wei mumbled, her eyes filled with tears of excitement.”Qingxue, it’s fine as long as both of you are safe and sound.. I’ve been worried about you two every day for the past two months!”
