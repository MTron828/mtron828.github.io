Chapter 1070: Accidentally on the hot search (2)

Translator: 549690339

The first few were talking about recent social events, as well as a few celebrities, including a Korean group who were about to come to China for a concert.

Weibo’s hot search had become a landmark list in the past two years. Those who could be on the hot search were definitely hot topics in society at a time and caused widespread discussion in the entire Internet Society.

There were often rumors that some celebrities spent hundreds of millions to get on the hot search, and there were also various operating companies, which were the so – called Internet Water Army, who took on the task of hyping up the news and helping people get on the hot search.

Weibo’s hot search list was really a strong topic. There were more than 100 million daily active users on the Weibo platform. To be able to be on the hot search list was better than spending millions or tens of millions on TV and newspapers to advertise.

Xia ruofei still couldn’t believe it. He clicked on the link to the sky – High price of abalone and saw that it was indeed related to the peach blossom company’s auction of abalones on Weibo. The news video from the National television was also frequently used.

Xia ruofei was relieved. It really wasn’t a mistake. He was really on the hot search list!

He then opened the official Weibo account of paradise Corporation. After Feng Jing became the General Manager, she had always attached great importance to the company’s image, so the company’s official Weibo and official WeChat account had been opened long ago.

Moreover, these social media platforms were operated by professionals in the company, and the marketing department was in charge.

However, the Paradise company wasn’t very famous in the past, so most of the time, it was just self – Entertainment and didn’t have much publicity effect.

But today, Xia ruofei saw it and thought,’good!’ The number of fans on his official Weibo was already close to a million!

And with every refresh, the number of fans could be seen increasing.

Obviously, most of the one million fans had increased in the past two days.

Xia ruofei also realized that the number of Weibo posts on the official Weibo account had increased significantly in the past two days. It was obvious that the marketing department was focusing on this.

The hot search could bring in a large number of fans, but whether it could maintain these fans or even continue to grow in the future depended on the usual operation and management.

Feng Jing must have made some special arrangements. It was obvious that the official Weibo was not a cold announcement platform. After every post was posted, there would be people watching the comments. They would even use the official Weibo account to interact with fans. Some of the replies were quite interesting and very down – to – Earth.

For example, some netizens left comments saying that it was useless no matter how good the abalone was because they couldn’t afford it at all. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

The official Weibo of the peach blossom company used a popular sentence some time ago to reply: People still had to have dreams. What if they were realized? [In addition to abalone, our company also deals in vegetables, fruits, white wine, iron – skinned fengdou, and other products, which are produced in Taoyuan. They must be of high quality!]

Besides, Xia ruofei realized that the official Weibo had a self – deprecating spirit. They had even specially created a set of abalones emojis, accompanied by adapted internet buzzwords such as “brother paradise of society, ruthless and quiet”,”old tie, it hurts ...”,”Your mother is calling you home to eat abalones”, and so on. It was also widely shared on Weibo.

After watching for a while, Xia ruofei was completely relieved. From the details of the management of the official Weibo, Xia ruofei could tell that Feng Jing had not been overwhelmed by the sudden increase in popularity. She was still calmly arranging various tasks and the company’s operations were still in order.

After calming down, Xia ruofei quickly guessed the reason why it was trending.

The destructive power of national TV Department 1 was really unparalleled. In the past few days, the number of discussions on paradise Corporation on the internet was already very large. After national TV Department 1 broadcasted that news, it was equivalent to adding oil to the fire, and the topic’s popularity suddenly soared.

The auction this time was really profitable! Xia ruofei thought excitedly.

Compared to the huge reputation that the Paradise Corporation had gained, the 70 to 80 million profit from the auction was not even worth mentioning.

The car arrived at the entrance of Taoyuan farm in no time. Xia ruofei noticed that there were a few more veterans on duty at the entrance, and there were a few barricades at the entrance.

Without waiting for Xia ruofei to ask, ye Lingyun explained,””Brother Xia, a lot of reporters have been coming here these days. Some of them even wanted to sneak in and take pictures, so I have strengthened the security of the farm. There will be two more people on duty at the entrance. In addition, the frequency of everyone’s patrol has increased.”

Xia ruofei nodded. He guessed that the reporters were here for Feng Jing.

If you wanted to interview the company, you could make an appointment through normal channels. This kind of camping and sneaky filming was mostly done by entertainment paparazzi.

Although there were barbed wire fences around the farm, if someone really wanted to sneak in, the barbed wire couldn’t stop them at all. Although there were alarm devices in key locations, the farm was too large, after all, so they could only strengthen the patrol and guard.

Xia ruofei thought for a moment and said,””Brothers, remember to bring the dogs on our farm with you when you’re patrolling. If a stranger sneaks in, they’ll definitely notice it at once.”

Lightning, Blackie, and Da Mao had a keen sense of smell, and they were very human. If they were sent out, it was basically impossible for anyone to get in.

“Alright, brother Xia!” Ye Lingyun said, then drove into the farm. When he passed the gate, he honked and greeted the veteran who saluted the car.

The Veterans at Taoyuan farm maintained the military’s style to a large extent, including the standard military posture at the gate guard. They also raised their hands to salute when the farm vehicles entered and exited.

Xia ruofei did not go home. He asked ye Lingyun to drive him to the company’s general office and then ran upstairs.

“Boss Feng, come over here for a moment!” Xia ruofei shouted from the corridor and opened the door to his office.

Soon, Feng Jing arrived at Xia ruofei’s office in her business suit.

“Chairman, have you seen the Weibo hot search list?” Feng Rao asked with a smile.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”boss Feng, we’ve really struck it big this time!”

Then, Xia ruofei hesitated and asked,””Boss Feng, you ... Didn’t find anyone to run it, did you? Why do I feel that this is so unreal? It’s on national television, on the hot search, and even the company’s general manager has become an internet celebrity ...”

Feng Rao couldn’t help but feel embarrassed and said,”Chairman, you’re just rubbing it in!”

As she spoke, she sat down across Xia ruofei’s desk and said,””If I find someone to run it, will I get myself involved? You don’t know how annoyed I am right now ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”those small stars do everything they can to hype themselves up in order to become famous!” I don’t know how many people who want to be an internet celebrity are secretly envious of you!”

“Whoever wants to be famous, go ahead!” Feng Jing said unhappily,”I’m going to change my phone number. Otherwise, I won’t be able to work!”

“I heard that there are a lot of reporters waiting at the entrance!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Isn’t it? “I’m so annoyed ...”Feng Rao pouted.

She didn’t expect that she would become famous on the internet just by hosting an auction.

He was really caught off guard!

After chatting for a while, Feng Rao reported to Xia ruofei about the response of the auction.

Xia ruofei had learned about the basic situation when he was in Hong Kong. However, Feng Jing’s report was a summary of the information. There were also statistics such as click rates, views, and interactions, which made it more direct.

“Chairman, that’s the basic situation.” Feng Jing closed her laptop and said,”all in all, this auction has achieved unprecedented success, far exceeding our expectations. The company’s brand awareness has rapidly increased nationwide, and it has also formed the initial impression that ‘paradise Corporation only deals with premium goods’ in the hearts of our target audience. This can be said to have played a very crucial role in our company’s future development!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”very good!” President Feng, I think we can strike while the iron is hot. Before this wave of hot topics has completely faded, we can take advantage of this opportunity to launch our new heavy new product, the Jade skin cream!”
