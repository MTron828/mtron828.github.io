Chapter 1758: Uninvited guests (1)

“Yo! Sister – in – Law is here!” Zhao Yongjun’s forthright voice came from behind the two.

Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue turned around and saw Zhao Yongjun, who was usually dressed casually, wearing a suit and leather shoes today. He was looking at the two of them with a smile.

“Big brother Zhao!” Ling Qingxue called out.

They had met each other before at the three mountains. Ling Qingxue knew that Xia ruofei’s friends were not ordinary people, so she was more or less reserved.

Zhao Yongjun smiled and nodded at Ling Qingxue, his attitude was very kind.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”brother Zhao, you did well!” It’s quite lively!”

“Isn’t this just to carry out your instructions?” Zhao Yongjun laughed,”if we don’t make it lively, wouldn’t today’s groundbreaking ceremony be meaningless?”

Ling Qingxue did not know about the twists and turns of this plot of land. Xia ruofei did not want her to worry, so he did not tell her the details. Thus, she was a little confused after hearing it. However, she was smart and did not interrupt.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you’ve all worked hard these days!” I’m the one who’s bored ...”

“We’re brothers, so don’t say such things!” Zhao Yongjun smiled and said,”your contribution is greater than all of us combined! When have we ever been polite to you?”

Xia ruofei chuckled.

Zhao Yongjun continued,”ruofei, sister – in – Law, let’s go over there!” We’re all here!”

Xia ruofei said,”brother Zhao, you still have to receive guests, right?” Don’t mind us ...”

“You and your wife are the most important guests!” Zhao Yongjun said with a smile.

“We’re the shareholders, okay? When did you become a guest?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

“Alright! Then you can go by yourselves!” Zhao Yongjun didn’t stand on ceremony and said,”the two guests I’ve contacted are about to arrive, so I won’t be accompanying you guys!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei nodded.

The two of them greeted Zhao Yongjun and walked towards the temporary stage.

Song Rui and the others were busy with their work. When they saw Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue, they came forward to greet them, especially Wei Jun, Hou Liang, and a few others. They called them “sister – in – Law” very sweetly.

They didn’t care that they had a lot of things to do and that they had to greet their invited guests after they arrived. Hence, they didn’t talk much and Xia ruofei let them go.

“Quite a few people have come!” Ling Qingxue said.

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Yes, and these people are all from influential families. Basically, brother Zhao and a few others personally invited them.”

“It’s just a groundbreaking ceremony. Why is it so Grand?” Ling Qingxue asked with a smile.

“Of course there’s a reason ...” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”but you don’t have to worry about it. We’ll take care of it. You just have to send some capable people to settle in.”

“Alright then!” Ling Qingxue didn’t ask further.

Ling Qingxue, who had been in the management of a company for a long time, was still very good at controlling the situation.

Soon, it was almost ten in the morning.

Zhao Yongjun also came over to introduce Xia ruofei to a few invited guests, including some influential figures in the rich and powerful circle, as well as some famous people in the field of metaphysics. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Among them were a Vice President and a director of the Huaxia Xuanxuan society, as well as a famous Fengshui master from Hong Kong. This Fengshui master was also an Honorary Director of the Huaxia Xuanxuan society.

Just as the groundbreaking ceremony was about to begin, another car drove in from the intersection.

Zhao Yongjun, who was about to go on stage, couldn’t help but show a puzzled expression. The guests and media reporters they invited were all here! Why was there someone else here?

The car stopped at the side of the venue. After the door opened, three people got out of the front and back seats.

Zhao Yongjun couldn’t help but frown.

The person who had come was Liu haofan, who had spent a huge sum of money to buy the land and then sold it to Xia ruofei at a discount. Beside Liu haofan were two energetic old men.

Song Rui also saw Liu haofan immediately. He snorted and was about to walk over.

But Zhao Yongjun pulled him back and said in a low voice,””Xiao Rui, where are you going?”

“This guy is clearly here to cause trouble! I’m going to teach him a lesson!” Song Rui said.

“Today is the big day of our club’s foundation. Are you trying to mess things up?” Zhao Yongjun asked sternly, then said,”he’s a guest. No matter what his purpose is, we can’t fall out with him first!”

Then, Zhao Yong Jun said to Xu Zi Xuan: “Zi Xuan, look after Xiao Rui. I’ll go meet Liu er!”

Zhao Yongjun’s words also carried a hint of dissatisfaction. Although he was reasonable with song Rui, he was also angry with Liu haofan.

They did not invite Liu haofan to the groundbreaking ceremony at all. Their purpose was to not aggravate the conflict between the two parties. They did not expect Liu haofan to come to them himself. He was willing to transfer the land to them. Although the price was a little low at that time, it was a matter of mutual consent. No one forced Liu haofan to sign the contract with a gun at that time.

Zhao Yongjun strode towards Liu haofan. Not far away, Ling Qingxue called out in surprise,””Ruofei, isn’t that uncle du? Why is he here?”
