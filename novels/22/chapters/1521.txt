Chapter 1522: Hard to resist_1

Translator: 549690339

A thought flashed across Xia ruofei’s mind. He had consumed the spirit nourishment soup many times. It might be beneficial to Song Wei’s recovery. After all, the spirit nourishment soup could help with her spiritual power cultivation. In essence, it was a form of nourishment for her soul.

“Xia Qing, quickly brew a portion of spirit nurturing soup!” Xia ruofei used his divine sense to communicate with Xia Qing.

Xia Qing, who was in the space, said with a bit of difficulty,””Master, I’m still lacking one more medicinal herb to make the spirit nourishment soup ...”

“How could there be a missing medicinal herb?” Xia ruofei asked in confusion,”didn’t I prepare a lot of these commonly used herbs?”

Xia ruofei bought a lot of the Chinese herbs needed to make body tempering soup, pregnancy soup, heart nourishing soup, and jaded skin ointment and stored them in his storage space.

And with the improvement of his cultivation, the supplementary effect of the soup on his spiritual power cultivation was getting smaller and smaller, so he hadn’t taken it much recently. Why did he suddenly run out of medicinal herbs? Xia ruofei was also very curious.

“I had enough medicinal herbs,” Xia Qing said with a bitter smile.”But ... Last night in the underground palace ... They were all used up!”

“You mean the thorny vine root!” Xia ruofei immediately shouted.

He suddenly remembered that the magical beast was hiding in a narrow cave at that time. Xia Qing thought that the smoke from burning the thorny roots could force the magical beast out, so she took out a lot of thorny roots for him to use.

Xia ruofei also knew that the thorny vine roots were one of the ingredients needed to make the spirit nourishment soup. He just didn’t expect Xia Qing to be so honest and take out all the thorny vine roots in the stock, not leaving a single one.

Xia Qing said with some embarrassment,””Master, I was also worried that the dosage wasn’t enough to force out the Mirage beast. Thus, I gave you all the thorny vines stored in the Archean realm ...”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”it’s okay!” Thorned vine root isn’t a precious herb anyway. This kind of common Chinese medicine can be bought in any pharmacy!”

“Yes! Master. ” Xia Qing said,”miss song’s soul injury shouldn’t worsen in a short period of time. But master, it’s better to treat your own injuries as soon as possible to avoid any lingering effects.”

Just now in the underground palace, Xia ruofei had entered the stone room for the second time and was severely injured by the spirit body. He did not even have time to deal with it and hurriedly set up a time formation to deal with the spirit body.

After that, when the senior in the coffin appeared, Xia ruofei was in a very nervous state the entire time. Only now that Xia Qing reminded him did he feel pain all over his body.

There was no doubt that at least a few of his bones were broken, and his internal organs were somewhat displaced.

Xia ruofei did not dare to let his guard down. He immediately took out Two Spirit Heart Flower petals from the space and absorbed them into his body with his palm. Then, he took out a bottle of the spirit Heart Flower petal solution and gulped it down. He was a little thirsty, so he might as well use the spirit Heart Flower petal solution as a drink to speed up his recovery.

If this small bottle of highly concentrated spirit Heart Flower petal solution was poured into the farm’s water tower, it could at least provide enough water for the entire farm to irrigate for a month. Xia ruofei drank it directly like it was a drink to quench his thirst. Only he had the confidence to be so extravagant.

After all, there were still hundreds of spirit Heart Flower petals in the medium!

Xia ruofei did not notice that when he took out the item from the spirit map space, the White sector Fox, which had been lying lazily at the side, immediately perked up and raised its head to look at him with a burning gaze.

The white fox could feel the familiar spatial fluctuations. This was one of the reasons why it was willing to stay by Xia ruofei’s side.

Xia ruofei didn’t seem to notice it. After drinking the petal solution, he kept the bottle back in the medium, not wanting to waste it.

The White realmfox was originally lying on the ground, but now it could not help but stand up.

Xia ruofei looked at the realm Fox strangely, but he did not take it to heart. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Master, the realm Fox must have sensed the existence of the spirit map world ...” Xia Qing suddenly said.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but jump in shock. He quickly asked with his spiritual will,””No way? I’ve never taken out the painting!”

“The realm Fox is very sensitive to spatial fluctuations,” Xia Qing said.”I noticed that every time master saves and collects items from the spirit map world, the realm Fox would react.”

“F * ck! “I was too careless ...” Xia ruofei said. He then asked,”Xia Qing, is there any danger of the spirit map world being exposed?”

Xia ruofei knew that although the realm raccoon looked like a raccoon, it was actually very intelligent. If it could speak after it evolved, there was a chance that it would reveal its secret.

The spirit map space was Xia ruofei’s top secret. He couldn’t even reveal it to his family, so he was very concerned about this secret.

Xia Qing thought for a moment and said,”as long as the realm Fox is always by master’s side, there should be no problem.” The world Fox is very sensitive to the power of space, and the spirit map world is a space of its own. I think the reason why it is willing to stay is probably because of the spirit map world. ”

Xia ruofei glanced at the realm Fox and revealed a malicious look. He asked with his divine sense,””Xia Qing, is there a contract that allows the spirit beast to recognize a master and not betray it for life? For example, with a thought from the master, the spirit beast will bleed to death from its seven orifices ...”

Xia Qing couldn’t help but stare blankly for a moment before she forced a smile and said,””Master, how can there be such an overbearing contract? It’s not that there’s no such thing as a spirit beast recognizing a master, but it must be of the spirit beast’s own free will. Moreover, this kind of soul contract only makes the spirit beast extremely loyal, and the spirit beast’s master can’t simply decide the life and death of the spirit beast. ”
