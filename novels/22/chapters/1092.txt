Chapter 1093: Elder song’s birthday (2)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei leaned against the head of the bed and thought about it. His main focus was naturally the specialty products in his Qzone. However, he could not think of any suitable gifts.

Just as he was feeling vexed, a light suddenly flashed in his mind and he thought of a way.

Xia ruofei thought of the Jade leaves that he had given to Huanhuan and Haoran and had an idea. He felt that he could give elder song a gift like this. It was much better than wild ginseng and iron – Skin maples.

Of course, the gift for elder song couldn’t be in the shape of a Jade Leaf, and the formation carved inside couldn’t be a protective rune.

After all, with elder song’s status, no matter where he went, there would be extremely tight security. A protective talisman might not be of much use to him.

Of course, this was not a problem for Xia ruofei.

He had been training his mind power whenever he had the time. He could now draw the protective rune as he wished, so he used another rune to practice.

This talisman was similar to the formation that Xia Qing had arranged around the spirit heart tree, and it could gather spirit Qi.

In today’s world where spiritual Qi was scarce, if elder song could wear a jade pendant engraved with spiritual gathering runes, he would be able to gather spiritual Qi around him at all times. It would definitely be beneficial to his body and prolong his life.

Xia ruofei was very familiar with the spirit – gathering runes and was confident that he could carve them into the jade pendant.

The only problem now was that he didn’t have any good Jade in his hands.

If he were to give elder song a gift, the best gift would be the jade pendant that he carved himself. Moreover, the effect of the spirit – gathering rune was the best. Xia ruofei would definitely not buy a ready – made jade pendant.

He pondered for a while and then took out his phone to call Ma Zhiming, who was far away in Hong Kong.

“Xia Sheng! Good evening!” Ma Zhiming’s voice was very enthusiastic.

Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”Mr. MA, did you take the energy gathering pills on time last time?” How do you feel about the effect?”

Ma Zhiming immediately said,”xiasheng, I can feel that my body is gradually getting better, but ... Didn’t you say that it’s best not to sleep with Huixin while she’s taking the medicine?” So, I’m not too sure about the specific effects ...”

Ma Zhiming was a little embarrassed when he said this. After all, Xia ruofei was his junior. It was indeed a little unnatural to talk about this topic in front of Xia ruofei.

In fact, not only was Ma Zhiming embarrassed, but Xia ruofei was also not any better.

However, he had to at least show his symbolic concern for her when he called her in the middle of the night. Otherwise, it would be a little rude to ask for help as soon as he came up.

Xia ruofei laughed dryly and said,”it’s good that you can feel better!” That essence gathering pill was a recipe that was passed down hundreds of years ago, so there’s no need to doubt its efficacy. You just need to take it according to the doctor’s advice on time. ”

“Alright, alright!” Ma Zhiming quickly said.

In fact, even if he had not “tested” the effects with Tian Huixin, Ma Zhiming was still well aware of the effects. Ever since he had a problem in that area, he had not experienced the feeling of waking up in a “tent” for a long time. However, after eating the energy gathering pill that Xia ruofei had provided, he had found a familiar feeling in just a few days.

If Xia ruofei had not specifically instructed him to abstain from taking the medicine, Ma Zhiming would definitely have been eager to have an in – depth discussion with Tian Huixin about medicine.

Ma Zhiming naturally knew that Xia ruofei would not call him at such a late hour just to show concern for his health. Hence, he quickly asked,””Xia Sheng, did you call me for something?”

“Mr. MA, I’d like to ask if Hengfeng jewelry has a branch in the capital?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

“Of course I do!” Ma Zhiming said with a smile,”our branch in Beijing is one of the biggest flagship stores in the country!”

Xia ruofei said,”that’s great!” Mr. MA, I’m in the capital right now because I have to attend an elder’s birthday banquet in two days. I didn’t prepare a gift ...”

“I see!” Ma Zhiming immediately said. Xia Sheng, I’ll call the branch in the capital right away and ask them to prepare the best jade ware suitable for the birthday gift. You can go and choose at any time!”

Xia ruofei quickly said,”no, no, no, I don’t need a finished product!” Mr. MA, I hope that this birthday gift is processed by myself. This way, it will be unique and at the same time, it will show my sincerity. So ... I want to buy high – Quality Jade from your branch in the capital ...”

Ma Zhiming understood it as soon as he heard it.

The Jade Leaf that Xia ruofei had given Huanhuan previously was obviously the work of an expert. He felt that Xia ruofei probably knew a master in jade carving, so he wanted to buy the best Jade material to process it himself.

After all, Ma Zhiming had personally tasted the Jade Leaf. He and MA Xiong both thought that even the best sculptors in Hengfeng jewelry could not make such a natural and full of natural charm.

If Xia ruofei knew such a master, it was normal for him to look down on the finished products in his shop.

However, Ma Zhiming changed his mind and said with some doubt,”Xia Sheng, did you just say that the elder’s birthday is in two days? If you buy jade to process it, you won’t have enough time!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I have my ways!” Mr. MA, please help me check if there are any good Jade materials in the branch in the capital. The higher the quality, the better. Price is not a problem!”

“No problem!” “Yes!” Ma Zhiming agreed immediately.

After Xia ruofei thanked Ma Zhiming, he hung up.

Then, he stood up and opened the window. He lit a cigarette and took a puff. He looked at the heavy traffic outside the window and fell into deep thought.

In fact, Xia ruofei was checking the vast amount of information in his mind. These were all the ancient books and cultivation techniques contained in the human jade talisman.

He remembered that when he was separating the precious information, there was a visualization picture that left a deep impression on him.

Xia ruofei was preparing to use the image in the visualization picture as a blueprint to carve the Jade.

He could also find some pictures on the internet, and with his spiritual power cultivation, he could carve the Jade even by looking at the pictures.

However, the images that could be found on the internet were rather rigid, so they were not the most suitable choice.

However, the visualization picture was different. Anything that could be kept in the human jade talisman must be good stuff.

The information was already stored in Xia ruofei’s mind and he had some impression of it, so he found it quickly.

This was a visualization picture of Guan Yin. Compared to the image of Guan Yin that could be found everywhere on the internet, the Guan Yin in this visualization picture seemed to have a divine charm. One look and you could tell that it was not an ordinary item.

Xia ruofei’s face revealed a trace of joy. With his spiritual power, with a little practice, he should be able to perfectly present the image of Guan Yin Bodhisattva on the jade pendant.

Moreover, men wear Guanyin and women wear Buddha, so it was very suitable to give elder song a Jade Guanyin.

Xia ruofei immediately strengthened his memory and engraved this image into his memory.

At this moment, his phone rang. It was Ma Zhiming who had called the manager of the branch in the capital city overnight. After understanding the situation, he immediately sent Xia ruofei back.

“Mr. MA!” Xia ruofei picked up the phone and smiled.”Have you found out?”

Ma Zhiming said happily,”yes, the flagship store in Beijing just imported a piece of glass – Type jade two days ago. The quality is quite high. They were planning to make it into an ornament and take out a few sets of jade bracelets, but the sculptors didn’t have time to do it yet, so I asked the flagship store in Beijing to keep this piece of Jade. There are also a few pieces of ice – Type jade. You can go and pick any one you like tomorrow. You can take it directly!”

“That’s great!” Xia ruofei was very happy.”Mr. MA, thank you very much!”

Ma Zhiming quickly said,”xiasheng, you don’t have to be so polite with me!” It’s just a small matter, it’s my honor to be able to serve you!”

“Alright, alright, alright. I won’t stand on ceremony with you then.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’ll treat you to a drink when you return to the mainland!”

“Hahaha! Alright! I’ve long heard that you’ve hidden a lot of good wine, Xia Sheng!” Ma Zhiming said with a smile.

“You’re still thinking about my private collection of good wine?” Xia ruofei laughed.”No problem! When the time comes, you can go to my Peach Blossom Farm. I’ll have enough good wine and food!”

“Then it’s a deal!” Ma Zhiming laughed and said,”Xia Sheng, I’ll send you the contact information of the General Manager of the Beijing branch later. You can go and look for him at any time tomorrow!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said.

After solving the problem of the raw materials, Xia ruofei secretly heaved a sigh of relief. He went to the bathroom to take a shower and then fell asleep.
