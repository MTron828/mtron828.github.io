Chapter 541: Name shaking the three mountains (1)

Lin Shengnan’s eyes were filled with joy. She straightened her back and said,””Class monitor Xia, thank you!”

Xia ruofei smiled gently and pointed at the sofa.””Don’t be so restrained, sit down and talk!”

“Yes!”

Lin Shengnan sat down on the sofa opposite Xia ruofei. She was sitting upright with her back straight and her hands on her knees. This was the standard sitting posture in the Army.

Xia ruofei leaned back on the sofa in a relaxed manner and smiled.””Sheng Nan, the wolf King should have told you before, right? Come to my side, your job is to protect my girlfriend’s safety. ”

Lin Shengnan nodded.”Yes, Mr. Xia. I’ll do my best. I won’t make a single mistake!”

“I’m very confident in my comrades,”Xia ruofei nodded. Sheng Nan, to the public, you’ll be Qingxue’s assistant, and you’ll also need to help her with some work matters in the company. Of course, your main task is to ensure her safety. I hope you can stay by her side as much as possible, especially when she’s out. You must protect her well. Also, for the convenience of your work, you don’t have to look for a place to stay. I’ll get Qingxue to arrange a room for you at her house. ”

“Alright,” he said. Lin Shengnan nodded and said.

“As for the salary, I don’t know much about it. I’ll pay them according to their salary.” Xia ruofei said,”I’ll give you an extra 20000 Yuan every month. There’s no need to talk about the welfare benefits during the holidays. I’ve never been stingy with my employees. Are you personally satisfied with this treatment?”

Xia ruofei had seen copies of Lin Shengnan’s file. He knew very well that with Lin Shengnan’s skills, it was normal for her to earn two to three hundred thousand Yuan a year if she applied for a private bodyguard job. A monthly salary of twenty thousand Yuan was not too outrageous for a senior bodyguard.

Of course, the prerequisite was that he had to be able to find such a job.

If there was no other way, it would be impossible to get in with only good skills, especially when Lin Shengnan was a girl.

Xia ruofei’s 20000 Yuan was equivalent to paying for the bodyguard’s fee. He had long decided that he would pay for this part of the money. This little money was nothing to Xia ruofei. He couldn’t ask his father – in – Law to pay for a bodyguard for his girlfriend!

Lin Shengnan’s eyes flashed with a hint of surprise. She said sincerely,””Mr. Xia, I’m very satisfied with the salary, I even think it’s a little too high ... But I’m in urgent need of money at the moment, so ...”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,””This salary is not considered high! It’s in line with your ability and quality!”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and continued,””By the way, you said you needed money urgently?”

Lin Shengnan hesitated for a moment, but she still nodded.

Xia ruofei said,”then I’ll give you an advance payment.” How much do you need?” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Lin Shengnan quickly said,”no need, no need. Mr. Xia, the salary will be settled on a monthly basis. How can you get your salary before you start working?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”we’re all comrades. We should help each other when we’re in trouble.” Besides, you were recommended by the wolf King, so it’s my duty to take good care of you. Besides, I’m helping you solve your worries so that you can work more peacefully!”

Xia ruofei did not ask Lin Shengnan why she was in urgent need of money. Everyone had their own secrets. If Lin Shengnan wanted to tell her, she would. There was no need to force her.

Lin Shengnan opened his mouth, but Xia ruofei quickly continued, “It’s settled then, I’ll give you a hundred thousand in advance! Is it enough? If it’s not enough, you can add more!”

“Mr. Xia, there’s no need for that much!” Lin Shengnan quickly said. I ... I only need 70000 ...”

“Then I’ll take an advance of 80000 Yuan. That’s exactly four months ‘salary!” Xia ruofei said immediately.

“Well ...” Lin Shengnan hesitated for a moment, as if she was struggling with her thoughts. Finally, she raised her head and said,”alright! Thank you, Mr. Xia! I’ll definitely work hard!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. After getting Lin Shengnan’s account number, he forwarded it to pang Hao. He then called pang Hao and asked him to transfer 80000 Yuan to Lin Shengnan’s account as soon as possible.

Lin Shengnan looked at Xia ruofei with gratitude and asked,””Mr. Xia, when do I start work?”

Xia ruofei said,”anytime!” You have a personal matter to deal with, so you can take a few days off. ”

“No, no, I can go to work now!” Lin Shengnan said.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”alright!” I’ll take you to my girlfriend’s company now!”

“Yes!”

Xia ruofei had already convinced Ling Qingxue to agree to a female bodyguard. Two days ago, when the wolf King Guo Zhan recommended Lin Shengnan to Xia ruofei, he had immediately talked to Ling Qingxue, so he would just bring Lin Shengnan to meet Ling Qingxue.

Now that Feng Jing was in the company, Xia ruofei had more freedom. He drove the Knight XV SUV with Lin Shengnan and left the farm for the city.

……

Li Jing had been a little depressed recently, feeling that the year was not smooth.

He used to be the backbone of the lingji F & B sales department, so it shouldn’t be a problem for him to become the deputy manager with some more experience.

However, two months ago, he was transferred to the Dingfeng winery, which was newly acquired by the boss, as a Sales Manager without any warning.
