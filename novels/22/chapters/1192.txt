Chapter 1193: The joy of family (1)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei stayed in the capital for three days. After attending the press conference, he had a small gathering with song Rui and other friends. Then, he hurriedly took a flight back to Sanshan.

He had promised Lin Qiao that he would try his best to go back before the holiday.

Of course, things in the capital were almost done. Feng Jing stayed behind to finish some follow – up work and should be back in a few days. Xia ruofei was just going back first.

It was ten in the morning when they returned to Sanshan. Xia ruofei returned to Taoyuan farm to get a brief understanding of the company’s situation. During the period when Feng Jing was not at home, the marketing director, Xiao Qiang, was temporarily in charge of the company’s operations. Especially after the release of the jaded skin cream, which was extremely popular, there was a lot of work to be done after that. Xiao Qiang was the one who led people to work overtime day and night.

Xia ruofei listened to Xiao Qiang’s report and focused on understanding the production situation and stock situation at the pharmaceutical factory. After all, it was going to be sold on several e – commerce platforms at the same time. From the pre – orders, it could be predicted that the sales would be explosive.

Of course, not everyone who made a reservation could buy it. There would definitely be a limit to the number of sales. This was not an intentional hunger marketing, but limited by the current production capacity.

Of course, the rarer something was, the more expensive it would be. An appropriate limited sale would still stimulate the consumers ‘desire to buy it. This was a method that had been tried and tested time and time again.

This was also the reason why some cell phone brands were always criticized for the limited purchase, but still insisted on this approach.

Xia ruofei didn’t have the habit of holding a long meeting. After listening to Xiao Qiang’s report, he simply gave a few instructions and let everyone continue with their work. Yingluo was very busy now. Since everyone was working according to schedule, Xia ruofei certainly wouldn’t give them any instructions.

Of course, it was almost time for lunch. This was also a very important reason. Ran ran had already told Lin Qiao that she would be there for lunch.

11:30 am, daguantian District.

Xia ruofei drove the Knight XV into the underground parking lot of the community. When he bought a house for Lin Qiao, Xia ruofei bought a parking space.

Parking spaces were in high demand. If he had not had a good relationship with jianda group, he would not have been able to buy one at the end of the day.

Lin Qiao and Hu ‘Zi’s mother didn’t drive, and they rarely came over to stay. This time, it was the National Day holiday, and Lin Yue’ e had brought her daughter, Nan Nan, back to the farm’s staff dormitory. Therefore, the mother and daughter moved to the new house to stay for a few days.

However, Xia ruofei felt that he would need a parking space in the future. Since he did not have much money, he would just treat it as an investment.

As a matter of fact, it was very convenient to have a parking space when he occasionally came over. He could directly enter the community and the underground parking lot by swiping the car owner card.

After he parked the car, he took the elevator from the underground parking lot with two large bags of things and went directly to the high – end residential area on the 18th floor, the Grand view of the world. There was one unit per elevator, and only by swiping the owner card could he enter the corresponding floor, which was quite safe.

Of course, Xia ruofei also had a business owner card.

One of the bags was the Taoyuan vegetables that Xia ruofei took out from the medium. The other bag was some special pastries and Beijing Opera masks that he bought for Lin Qiao in the capital.

Coming out of the elevator, there was a wide corridor directly. The elevator was used by a card, and the escape passage of the corridor was one – way and could only be opened from the inside to the outside. So, this corridor was actually the private space of the owner.

Xia ruofei took a few steps to the door and moved the two big bags to one hand. Then, he reached out and pressed the doorbell.

Hu’s mother’s happy voice came from inside the house.””They’re coming!”

After the door opened, Xia ruofei smiled and said,””Godmother!”

“RUO Fei, come in quickly!” Hu Zi’s mother was wearing an apron. She personally took out a pair of slippers for Xia ruofei from the shoe cabinet at the entrance and called him into the house. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Godmother, how’s your health recently?” Xia ruofei put the bag on the ground and asked with a smile as he changed his shoes.

“Very good!” Hu Zi’s mother laughed and said,”now, besides picking Nan Nan up every day, I also have to go to zuohai Park for a walk and sing with the group of old ladies. Didn’t you say that walking more is good for the body? See, I’ve been wearing the bracelet you bought for me! More than 10000 steps a day!”

Before Hu Zi’s mother moved back to the city, Xia ruofei bought her a smart bracelet online and spent a lot of money to teach her how to synchronize data with her phone. Now, the old lady was quite fashionable and even knew how to share her steps on her WeChat moments. Although she didn’t have many friends on WeChat, she still enjoyed it.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I know, I know. You can see it on your WeChat moments!” You’ve done well ...”

As the two of them were talking, there was the sound of hurried footsteps coming from the stairs.

Although it was a flat – Floor house, it was on the top floor, which was higher than the other floors. The roof was two stories high, so it was only separated by an attic during the renovation. The entire upper floor was Lin Qiao’s boudoir.

After all, Hu Zi’s mother was old and it was not safe for her to go up and down frequently, so her room was downstairs.

“Brother ruofei!” Lin Qiao’s voice was full of joy.

Xia ruofei changed his shoes and walked into the living room. He saw Lin Qiao rushing down the stairs and into his arms.
