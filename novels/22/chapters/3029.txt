3030 The end of closed – door cultivation (1)

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but ask.”Senior Yuntai, when you were alive ... Uh, no, before you separated from your spiritual body, what was your cultivation?”

Layman Yuntai said with some embarrassment,””I was already in the immortal soul Stage then. I didn’t expect to be crushed by a little kid like you in terms of the rules of space ...”

Speaking of this, layman Yuntai asked,”by the way, little brother, what era is it now?” I don’t know how long I’ve been sealed in the space rock. I’ve always been in a dormant state. ”

“Senior Yuntai, it’s 20 ad this year ...” Xia ruofei said.

Halfway through, Xia ruofei stopped. The A.D. Calendar originated from Western Christianity. The first year of A.D. Was actually the year that Jesus was born. Master Yuntai was an Eastern cultivator and existed much earlier than the first year of A.D. How could he know the A.D. Calendar?

Hence, Xia ruofei thought for a while and asked,””Senior Yuntai, what era do you live in? can you tell me about it? This way, I can calculate how long you’ve been sealed in the space Stone. ”

“Oh ... Let me think!” Scholar Yuntai said,”in our era, what major events happened in the secular world? Let me think ... Oh! I think there’s a kid called Ji Fa who joined forces with a few vassals to suppress the king of Shang, Di Xin, of the secular world, and established a dynasty or something ...”

“The Zhou Dynasty?” Xia ruofei asked tentatively.

Actually, Xia ruofei already had an answer when master Yuntai said Ji FA’s name. However, Xia ruofei felt that it was unreal when a person from thousands of years ago was talking to him with confidence.

“Yes, yes, yes!” Scholar Yuntai said,”let’s call it Zhou Dynasty!”

“Senior Yuntai,” Xia ruofei said,”according to our current age, King Wu’s attack on the king happened in 1046 B.C., Which is more than 3000 years ago ...”

“A martial King attacking a King?”

“It’s Ji FA’s crusade against King Xin. In history, it’s known as King Wu’s crusade against King Xin!” Xia ruofei said,”that is to say, senior, you have lived for more than three thousand years!”

“Three thousand years?” Layman Yuntai was stunned for a moment and muttered to himself.

It was obvious that it took much longer than he had expected.

“Senior Yuntai, are you okay?” Xia ruofei asked with concern.

“I’m fine! I’m fine!” Scholar Yuntai said,”but I need to rest for a while. My spirit body is incomplete, and I was seriously injured this time. I’ve only just started to recover ...”

“Oh, then have a good rest! I’ll try to recover my spirit body as soon as possible!” Xia ruofei said,”senior Yuntai, you can stay here in peace!” I’ve stored this ore in a small space, so it’s absolutely safe. As long as you’re careful not to fall into the space overlapping area, and even more so not to be accidentally drawn into the chaotic flow of time, it’ll be fine!” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Hahaha! Don’t worry! I’m a cultivator of the primordial soul realm, how could I make such a low – Level mistake?” Said layman Yuntai.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel strange. He felt that scholar Yuntai’s words were mocking him.

However, he also knew that he must have thought too much. With his cultivation in the Golden core stage, he could have such an achievement in the rules of space. Even layman Yuntai admired him. As for the time turbulence, layman Yuntai himself had said that it was almost impossible for cultivators in the Golden core stage to be involved in the rules of time, so how could he ridicule him?

After saying that, there was no more sound from scholar Yuntai. He probably went to absorb the spiritual energy seriously.

Xia ruofei left the mysterious ore in the stone room of the cave. At the same time, he wrapped the ore in three layers of spatial energy, completely cutting off its connection with the spirit map space.

At first, Xia ruofei was still in a dilemma. He wanted to let the spirit map space absorb and devour this mysterious ore, but he felt that it was a pity.

He had a premonition that if the spirit map space could devour this mysterious ore, there was a high chance that he would be able to evolve once.

However, there were still many uses and functions of this mysterious ore that had yet to be explored. Xia ruofei had not fully understood the rules of those small spaces. To him, it was still useful.

However, Xia ruofei didn’t have to worry about it anymore. Since scholar Xuanji had already moved into the ore space, it was impossible for him to give the ore to the spirit map space to swallow!

Xia ruofei left behind a small formation. Once layman Yuntai tried to communicate with him through spiritual energy, even if Xia ruofei was outside, he could use this small formation to know in time and communicate with layman Yuntai on the spiritual energy level.

After making the necessary arrangements, Xia ruofei left the cave.

In fact, he still had many questions to ask master Yuntai. However, he had said that he was very weak and needed rest. Xia ruofei naturally could not force him.

Xia ruofei returned to the Archean realm and spent some time in the small square in front of the Linglong Pagoda to get used to his mental energy. At the same time, he cultivated the “great Dao Sutra”.

He had been trapped in the ore space for 1000 years. Although only a short period of time had passed since he entered the Archean realm, Xia ruofei could feel that he had truly been trapped for 1000 years.

When he was in the spirit body state, Xia ruofei could not cultivate.

Therefore, he was more or less unfamiliar with the great Dao Arts.

However, after cultivating for a while, that familiar feeling returned
