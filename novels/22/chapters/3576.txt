Xia ruofei hung up the phone and said to Xue Jinshan,””Kanayama, everyone has worked hard during the new year! The staff’s meals must be well prepared!”

“Don’t worry, President Xia!” Xue Jinshan said,”the company has allocated some money to improve the staff’s meals during the spring Festival! We’ve prepared this for our employees according to the highest standards!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes!” Then you guys go ahead! I have something to do, so I’ll be leaving first!”

“President Xia, I’ll send you off!” Xue Jinshan quickly said. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Xue Jinshan didn’t call for any other subordinates. He accompanied Xia ruofei to the Knight XV SUV. Xia ruofei started the car and rolled down the window. He stuck his head out and said,””Alright, you can go! I’m leaving!”

“Take care, President Xia!” Xue Jinshan waved his hand.

Xia ruofei drove through the factory and left through the main entrance of the factory.

In a short while, Xia ruofei drove to the village entrance where Hu Zi’s mother had alighted in the morning. However, he did not see Hu Zi’s mother waiting there.

Xia ruofei took out his phone and wanted to call Hu Zi’s mother. However, after thinking for a while, he put his phone away. The village was not that big. He decided to release his spiritual power and explore the surroundings.

Very quickly, Xia ruofei found Hu Zi’s mother.

She was not far from the village entrance. She was standing in the yard of a house and talking to a few people.

Xia ruofei stopped the car by the road and jumped out. He walked towards Hu Zi’s mother.

After passing through a winding alley, Xia ruofei could see Hu Zi’s mother from afar.

Just as Xia ruofei was about to greet Hu Zi’s mother, he heard her shout angrily,””Jiang Hua! How could you do that? That’s my and Qiao’ er’s money!”

In front of Hu’s mother stood a man in his thirties. He wore a black leather jacket and a thick gold chain around his neck. He held a cigarette in his hand and had a nonchalant expression on his face.

He laughed and said,”aunt, I didn’t say that it wasn’t your money!” I’m short on money, so I’m borrowing it for a while. Don’t tell me you won’t even help me with this little favor!”

Hu ‘Zi’s mother looked resentful and said,””What did you say back then? Help me get the money back and call me immediately! I’ve been waiting for so long and you still haven’t turned it over. Now that I’m here to ask for it, you’re still trying to reject me!”

Hu Zi’s mother then turned to an old man in his sixties and said,”Third uncle! You’re the party secretary, so what do you think we should do about this?”

The old man took a puff of his tobacco and said with a sad face,””Cuihua, I called you about this. You agreed to let Jiang Hua sign on your behalf. There’s no use looking for me now…”

“I’m only saying that he’ll sign on your behalf. You can transfer the money to me directly!” Hu Zi’s mother asked,”why did you even give him the money?”

“This …” The old man was at a loss for words. He sighed and said,”cuihua, this is between you and your aunt. Jiang Hua has always been the one planting your family’s land. This time, you agreed to let him sign the papers for you. If Jiang Hua wants to help you collect the money, I… 1 can’t say anything!” Cuihua, it’s useless for you to come to me for this. You should talk to Jiang Hua!”

Xia ruofei furrowed his brows and walked forward quickly.””Godmother, what’s going on?”

When Hu Zi’s mother saw Xia ruofei, she quickly said,””RUO Fei, you’re here!

It’s nothing… Let’s go back!”

Then, Hu Zi’s mother pulled Xia ruofei away.

Xia ruofei stood still and looked at the man in the black leather suit named Jiang Hua.””Godmother, if there’s anything, it’s better to be clear. Why did I hear you talking about money just now? what money is it?”

When Hu Zi’s mother was about to leave, Jiang Hua’s eyes were filled with pride. However, Xia ruofei was not going to let this go so easily. This made Jiang Hua angry. His eyes were filled with ferocity as he asked,””Who the hell are you? Is it your turn to speak in Jiangying village as an outsider?”

The village where Hu Zi’s mother’s family was located was called Jiangying village. Most of the people in the village had the surname Jiang. Hu Zi’s mother’s name was Jiang Cuihua, and she was also a member of the Jiang family in the village.

Xia ruofei frowned and said,””I’m Lin Hu’s comrade! Godmother’s matters are my matters, why can’t I interfere?”

Then, Xia ruofei ignored the hooligan – like Jiang Hua and turned to Jiang Cuihua,””Godmother, tell me, what’s going on?”

At this moment, the old man that Jiang Cuihua addressed as third uncle cleared his throat and said,””Young man, this is cuihua’s family matter. It’s best if you don’t interfere as an outsider…”

Xia ruofei saw that the old man and Jiang Hua were calling him an outsider. He couldn’t help but laugh.

“I’m an outsider. Can’t 1 interfere in godmother’s matters?” Xia ruofei said sarcastically,”then what have you family members done? Are you joining hands to bully a single mother and daughter?”

“Young man, you can’t say such things! You don’t even understand the situation clearly!” Third uncle said calmly,”cuihua is also responsible for this, don’t blame me!”

Xia ruofei no longer paid attention to this old man who was obviously biased.. He looked at Jiang Cuihua and said,””Godmother, tell me, what’s going on? If you don’t make it clear today, I’m not leaving!”
