Xia ruofei had already expected that Ling Qingxue would definitely ask this question. He deliberately said in a relaxed manner,””Don’t worry, I still have to prepare a few medicinal herbs for you to recuperate. It’s very important to be in contact with cultivation for the first time. You have to recuperate your body to its best condition before you can succeed in one try!”

Ling Qingxue asked,”are the herbs expensive?” Do you have enough money? I still have ...”

“Silly girl! Your boyfriend’s company is now valued at 2 billion!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”would you be short of money to buy medicine?”

In fact, Xia ruofei’s heart ached for the five crystals! He would not be willing to change it no matter how much money it was.

In terms of economic benefits, the spiritual Qi contained in five spiritual crystals could produce countless precious medicinal herbs. If it was converted into money, it would definitely be an astronomical figure.

Ling Qingxue giggled and said,”two billion and you’re already cocky!” Why don’t you compare it with our Ling Ji F & B?”

Xia ruofei rolled his eyes and said,”How long has paradise Corporation been established? Ling Ji restaurant is my future father-in-law’s life’s work. How can you compare it? If we really want to compete, let’s wait until I’m at uncle Ling’s age, then we’ll compete again?”

“If you can’t win, then you can’t win. Why do you have to find so many excuses ...” Ling Qingxue said with a smile.”Go to flying Snow Pavilion! I’ll look at the accounts here, then I’ll go look around!”

“En!” Xia ruofei patted Ling Qingxue’s head and said,”you don’t have to work too hard. Take care of your health ... Also, when I’ve prepared the medicinal herbs, you’d better ask uncle Ling for a few days ‘leave and stay at the farm. We’ll help you get through the entrance gate wholeheartedly. It’ll be much easier in the future ...”

Ling Qingxue nodded.”Okay, I’ll let my father know in advance. I’ll just ... Just tell him that I’ve been too tired recently. I want to rest for a few days and relax my body and mind!”

“Mm! “I’ll go first ...”Xia ruofei said.

Xia ruofei strode towards the backyard, and the store manager finally let out a sigh of relief. He walked up to Ling Qingxue and said,””Miss, let me report to you the recent business situation of the private kitchen ...”

On the way to flying Snow Pavilion, Xia ruofei thought of picking a date to relocate the headquarters. Suddenly, he had an idea. He took out his phone from his pocket and found a number in his contact list. After a moment of silence, he dialed it.

The call was quickly connected, and a hearty voice came from the phone,””Mr. Xia! Why are you so free to think of this old man today?”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Hello, uncle Xu. I have something to ask you ... It’s like this. Our company is planning to move our headquarters to a new building and we want to pick a good day. So ... We came to ask you, an expert!”

Xia ruofei was calling Hong Kong’s Feng Shui Master, Xu lang. At the groundbreaking ceremony in the capital, Xia ruofei and Xu lang had a good conversation. Xu lang even offered to be the cultural and environment consultant of The Peach Blossom Spring Gathering, which gave Xia ruofei a big surprise.

The two of them naturally exchanged contact information.

Xu lang laughed and said,”Mr. Xia, you’ve given me a difficult problem!” It’s related to the location of your company’s new headquarters, as well as the current headquarters. Without going to your company to investigate, even if I have the ability of the heavens, I can’t calculate the most suitable date!”

Hearing this, Xia ruofei realized that he had taken it for granted. Indeed, he did not have any concept of Feng Shui metaphysics. He thought that it was like flipping through the Almanac and seeing the words “today is suitable for moving”, he could choose an auspicious day.

Just as Xia ruofei was about to give up on asking Xu lang to pick a date, Xu lang changed the topic and said with a smile,””Mr. Xia, I’m going to Heron Island to attend a metaphysical exchange tomorrow. If you have time, I’ll go to the three mountains the day after tomorrow to check it out and give you my advice. How about it?” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Xia ruofei was surprised and happy. He quickly said,””That’s the best, of course! But ... Wouldn’t this be too much for you?”

Xu lang laughed and said,”the three mountains are very close to Heron Island!” I’ll just treat this as a vacation. You’ll treat me to a taste of the three mountains “specialty food, no problem, right?”

“Of course, no problem! Uncle Xu, I’ll definitely make you feel like you’re at home!” Xia ruofei said happily,”uncle Xu, I’ll arrange a car to wait at Heron Island tomorrow. We’ll bring you to Sanshan after the exchange meeting!”

Xu lang smiled.”There’s no need to go through so much trouble ... I heard that the high – speed rail in the mainland is very convenient now. It only takes more than an hour to get from Egret Island to Sanshan. It’s much faster than driving. Besides, I want to experience the speed of Huaxia in our motherland!”

Xia ruofei felt a little embarrassed. Xu lang was a Feng Shui Master in Hong Kong. Even tycoon li listened to him. It was a little rude of him to invite someone to come and pick a date. It was not proper to ask him to come by high – speed rail.

Xia ruofei’s mind whirred and he said,””Since uncle Xu wants to experience the high – speed rail in the mainland, I’ll make the arrangements in advance. I’ll get someone to contact you tomorrow!”

Xu lang didn’t reject her this time. He smiled and said,””Then, thank you, Mr. Xia!”

“Uncle Xu, please don’t say that. I should be the one thanking you!” Xia ruofei said hurriedly.
