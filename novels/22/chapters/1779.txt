Chapter 1780: Get your wish (1)

“What?” “Your boss hasn’t even decided if he’s going to treat me and Xiao LAN, and he’s already buying us clothes?” Wu Xiujuan asked, feeling a little confused.

“Didn’t I already tell you?”Wu Qiang said with a smile. The boss was a very good person! “But, sister – in – Law, Xiao LAN, the flight is late, so we might have to change our original plan. I can only take you to Chang ‘an Street and show you the gate of serenity and the monument. Then, we’ll find a place to buy some clothes and have a meal before we go back. We can’t keep our boss waiting for too long!” In the future, if you stay and work, there will be plenty of opportunities to take you out for sightseeing!”

“Qiangzi, since it’s so late, let’s go back!” Wu Xiujuan quickly said. It’s not good to keep the boss waiting ...”

“Yup! Brother Qiang!” Xia Xiaolan chimed in,”serious business is more important.”

“Just listen to my arrangement!” Wu Qiang said with a smile. I understand President Xia’s temper. If he doesn’t complete his orders, he will definitely be very angry! Don’t worry, the boss’s house isn’t far from the Tian ‘an gang’s Guang Quan square. If we hurry, we’ll definitely be back before 8:30, and the boss won’t be asleep by then!”

As Wu Qiang spoke, he skillfully drove the Land Rover and turned on the radio.

Soon, the car entered the busy city center of Beijing.

It was Wu Xiujuan and Xia Xiaolan’s first time in the capital. It was also their first time seeing so many cars, as well as the rows of high – rise buildings and colorful lights on both sides of the road. Their eyes almost popped out.

The car drove to Chang ‘an Street. When they passed by the square that every Chinese person was extremely familiar with, Wu Xiujuan and Xia Xiaolan did not even blink. They looked at the gate and then at the monument opposite it. They were very excited.

Wu Qiang had stayed in the capital city for many years and was very familiar with the place. Therefore, he was responsible for explaining while driving. Even when the car had left the square, the two of them were still somewhat unsatisfied.

Xia Xiaolan sat in the back seat and looked at Wu Qiang, who was talking with fervor and assurance. Under the flickering street lamp, the side of his face was clearly angular. An inexplicable feeling seemed to gradually grow in her heart ...

Xia Xiaolan had heard of Wu Qiang back in her hometown, but she only knew some superficial information. For example, Wu Qiang’s family situation was rather difficult, and Wu Qiang went out to serve in the Army for a few years before working in the capital. He seemed to have earned some money recently and often sent money back home ...

After getting to know him for real today, Xia Xiaolan realized that Wu Qiang was a little different from what she had imagined. His calmness after the military experience had given him a lot of bonus points. Besides, Xia Xiaolan could also see that Wu Qiang’s job was not bad. From some details, she could tell that Wu Qiang’s boss valued him very much.

Unconsciously, Wu Qiang was no longer the poor village boy who had no way out. Even in their hometown, Wu Qiang was definitely considered a successful person.

Such a man would naturally be more attractive to girls.

Moreover, Xia Xiaolan had a very good impression of Wu Qiang after a period of contact with him. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

After leaving Tiangang gate’s Square, Wu Qiang drove to the vicinity of Wangfujing. After parking the car, he brought the two of them to the shopping mall to buy clothes.

A set of clothes that cost more than 1000 Yuan per person, including jackets, pants, and shoes, could be said to be very ordinary. It was not quite possible for a slightly well – known brand in the country to buy a set of clothes with that little money.

However, Wu Xiujuan and Xia Xiaolan were still dumbfounded by the price. They quickly declined, thinking that it was too expensive and dared not accept it.

After much persuasion, Wu Qiang finally brought up Xia ruofei, their boss, saying that this was the work uniform that the boss had given them and that he would be angry if they did not accept it. Thus, the two of them accepted it uneasily.

However, it was a woman’s nature to love beauty. Both of them held the bags of clothes tightly, and the joy in their eyes could not be hidden.

After they left the mall, Wu Qiang brought the two of them to eat at Quanjude.

The roast duck in Beijing was very unique, and Quanjude was the most famous restaurant. Although the roast duck of bianyi square had a long history and was loved by the locals, Quanjude was not as famous as it was.

It was Wu Xiujuan and Xia Xiaolan’s first time eating Beijing roasted duck, and it was from the famous Quanjude restaurant. Both of them were very happy and ate with relish.

However, when they saw the bill of more than 500 yuan, the two were shocked again.

He was only 70 – 80% full from this little roasted duck, but it cost more than 500 yuan! With so much money, he could eat several meals in his hometown, and he would definitely be full!

But no matter what, from the moment they got off the plane until now, it was an eye – opening experience for the two.

They were about to return to the courtyard house in liuhai Lane, and the two of them began to feel nervous again.

On the way back, Wu Qiang kept talking to them, trying to make them relax. However, this kind of tension came from the bottom of their hearts. Before they met Xia ruofei, it would be difficult to relieve them. Wu Qiang could only try his best to make them relax.

Soon, the car arrived at the courtyard house. Wu Qiang drove in from the back door and parked the car.

After the three of them got out of the car, Wu Qiang helped them to carry their luggage and said,””Sister – in – Law, Xiao LAN, please leave your things in my room! If the boss agrees to let you stay and work, you will have your own room in this yard!”
