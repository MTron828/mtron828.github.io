Chapter 1803: High morale (1)

Translator: 549690339

“Loan?” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be stunned.

To be honest, it was a coincidence that Xia ruofei owned a big company with more than a billion Yuan in assets. When he first got the spirit map space, he just wanted to earn more money to improve his life. He didn’t expect the company to grow bigger and bigger.

In fact, Xia ruofei was not a qualified company manager. His philosophy was different from that of ordinary businessmen. He even had the simple idea of not having any debts.

In addition, the core competitiveness of the Paradise company actually came from the spirit map space, so the operating costs were very low. In the early stages, they had never needed to use loans to develop.

Hence, Xia ruofei did not take the initiative to look for loan funds.

Feng Jing found it funny, but she had to protect Xia ruofei’s authority during the meeting. Hence, she thought for a while and said,””Chairman, the most important thing for a company’s development is capital. If you have the money, you can expand in minutes and turn the money in the bank into the company’s total assets. Although the debt rate has increased, the company’s scale has expanded.”

In fact, most companies operated this way. Otherwise, if they were like Xia ruofei, who only relied on his own money to expand production and scale, how long would it take for a company to develop?

“Chairman,” said Dong Yun.”Many companies have a debt ratio of more than 50%, 70%, and 80%. As long as the capital chain is healthy, the bank is more than happy to lend us money.”

Xia ruofei nodded and asked,””Is there any difficulty in applying for a loan?”

“With our zero debt and so many high – Quality assets, there shouldn’t be any problems with the loan review.” Feng Jing said,”in fact, ICBC President Zhou even half – jokingly told me that if every business was like us, the bank would have to close down!” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“President Zhou even took the initiative to ask me if we need a loan!” Pang Hao said with a smile.

The salary of paradise corporation’s employees was paid through ICBC, and the company’s accounts were also opened by ICBC, so the relationship between ICBC and the company had always been quite good.

Xia ruofei scratched his head and said with a smile,””Are there still banks rushing to give money these days?”

“Then who’s going to get the points!” Pang Hao said,”as long as one’s brain isn’t damaged, they can see the development prospects of the Paradise Corporation. The bank will definitely not make a loss by lending us a loan. Furthermore, we still have many high – Quality assets as collateral.”

Xia ruofei was no longer biased against loans. He thought for a while and asked,””If we apply for a loan from ICBC, how much do you guys think we can get?”

” 500 million is definitely not a problem,” said pang Hao. If we work hard to coordinate, six to seven hundred million or even seven to eight hundred million won’t be a problem!”

“So many!” Xia ruofei was also shocked.

Xue Jinshan said proudly,”Chairman, it’s definitely not a problem to mortgage 500 million Yuan from Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory. The Jade skin cream project is simply a hen that lays golden eggs!”

Xia ruofei glanced at Xue Jinshan and teased,””I was wondering why old Xue was so arrogant! He’s talking about projects worth more than a billion Yuan, like a nouveau riche!”

Everyone laughed when they heard this. They were in a good mood because they could see that Xia ruofei had been persuaded.

As expected, Xia ruofei pondered for a while and said,””Regarding the expansion of the sub – Plant, we can do some preliminary research. I need to see the detailed plan and budget, including the one – time investment needed in the early stage, the follow – up fund requirements, the time of payment, and so on! After all, it’s a project that involves so much money!”

Xia ruofei did not want to cause problems in the company’s capital chain because of his radical strategy. Even if the company went bankrupt, he could still live a carefree life. However, the company was built by him after all, and the hundreds of people under him now depended on the company for their livelihood!

Xia ruofei’s request was very reasonable. Xue Jinshan said excitedly,”No problem! Chairman, I’ll get it done as soon as possible!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes!” If the plan is feasible, I’ll talk to the government personally and try to get as much land as possible!”

“Thank you, Chairman!” When Xue Jinshan heard this, it was as if he had eaten a calming pill.

Xia ruofei looked around at the crowd and said,””You guys won’t ask for more money, right? Good fellow! After a meeting, I’m going to owe the bank a few hundred million ...”

“Hahaha ...” Everyone laughed in unison.

In fact, Xia ruofei was just joking. If the pharmaceutical factory’s expansion plan was implemented, the company’s total assets would more than double. Furthermore, the annual revenue would increase greatly. By then, would they care about the debt of hundreds of millions?

Using the bank’s money to develop the company, using the bank’s money to make money for himself, just having to pay a little interest, how good was this!

Other enterprises would be eager to take out as many loans as possible!

After Feng Rao laughed, she said in embarrassment,””Chairman, supervisor Cao has mentioned the farm to me a few times. He also hopes to expand the scale of planting ...”

Cao tieshu could not be considered as one of the company’s top executives. He was only the supervisor of Taoyuan vegetables, so he did not participate in the meeting. However, he had looked for Feng Jing several times, and he always talked about the problem of the farm’s production capacity.

Xia ruofei said helplessly,”it’s not impossible to expand the scale of the farm, but to connect it with the existing land, it may involve coordination with different towns and villages. You guys get a plan first. If it’s feasible, contact them first!”
