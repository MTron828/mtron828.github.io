The seven raw gemstones that Xia ruofei had chosen were not as popular, so there were fewer bidders. Xia ruofei kept an eye on the situation in the bidding boxes as he “strolled”.

On the other hand, the big rough stone with the lowest starting price of 5 million Yuan was more popular. People had been looking at it carefully, especially as it was approaching the bidding deadline. From time to time, people would put in their written forms.

Hence, Xia ruofei’s main focus was on this raw stone.

Yu mingdong and he Ping were also nervously paying attention to the few targets they had chosen. Among them, there were a few pieces that had not been decided on the final price, so naturally, they had no time to care about Xia ruofei.

Time passed by.

When the live broadcast indicated that there were ten minutes left before the bidding deadline, Xia ruofei started to act.

He quickened his pace and came to the first raw stone he had chosen. After using his spiritual power to probe it, he quickly wrote down a price and tore the first couplet off before putting it in.

Xia ruofei did not stop and continued to walk towards the other raw stone he had chosen.

In a short while, Xia ruofei had thrown the first seven raw stones.

If he could get all seven raw gemstones as he wished, Xia ruofei would have to pay about 3.3 million.

In the end, Xia ruofei returned to the front of the largest raw stone.

Of course, he had been paying attention to the first seven raw gemstones. He would be a little nervous when someone passed by the raw gemstones. Fortunately, these seven raw gemstones were really unpopular, so no one bid for them in the last few minutes.

As for the large raw stone that Xia ruofei was most concerned about, there were still new orders coming in in the last few minutes.

Hence, Xia ruofei’s main focus was still on this side.

Fortunately, this bidding model was not an open bidding, so everyone had their own judgment on the value of the raw stone and the bidding strategy of potential competitors. Therefore, although there were many people competing, the highest price would not be too outrageous.

Xia ruofei was standing right next to the raw gemstone. His spiritual power was covering the bidding box, so he knew everyone’s bid.

It was like other people were fighting a battle of wits and courage in this bidding model, while Xia ruofei was facing a completely open and transparent card.

There were still three minutes before the bidding deadline, and the highest bid for the raw stone was 8.52 million.

Xia ruofei did not hesitate. He wrote a price of 8.6 million Yuan, tore off the first couplet, folded it, and stuffed it into the bidding box.

There was no rule that one could only bid once, so Xia ruofei first wrote a price to ensure that he would win the bid. If someone else offered a higher price in the last three minutes, he would raise the price again.

After Xia ruofei threw the stone, he stood near the stone and observed the eight stones he had chosen.

The seven raw gemstones were still uninterested, but there were still people who came to bid for the largest stone in the last few minutes.

The performance of this raw stone might really be good, and there were many people who thought highly of it.

However, people in the industry had a general standard of judgment, and this was a raw material that was all gambled on, so everyone’s bid was not too outrageous.

Up until the bidding deadline, no one had offered a price higher than 8.6 million.

Xia ruofei heaved a sigh of relief when he heard the announcement and the staff came to maintain order.

If nothing unexpected happened, he would have all eight raw gemstones!

The organizer’s staff began to clear the venue. They needed to put all the bidding boxes together and calculate the bidding situation under the supervision of the notary.

Xia ruofei quickly found Yu mingdong and the rest. Yu mingdong had a relaxed smile on his face and looked very confident.

“Mr. Xia, let’s go find a place to have dinner!” Yu mingdong laughed and said,”at 7:30 p.m., The bidding results will be announced one after another. We’ll come again then!”

“Alright, I’ll follow your arrangements, President Yu!” Xia ruofei smiled.

Except for the organizer’s cars, special vehicles such as escort vehicles and ambulances, no other cars were allowed to enter jadeite Street. Therefore, the bosses with assets worth hundreds of millions walked out.

Xia ruofei and the rest chatted as they walked.

“Mr. Xia, what do you think of the public Jade bid?” Yu mingdong asked with a smile.

“It’s my first time here, so I can’t really describe the feeling. But the scale is really quite big.” Xia ruofei said.

“That’s right! This is one of the largest public Jade auctions in Dian province, and all the jewelers and Jade businessmen in the country are gathered here!” Yu mingdong said with a smile, and then asked casually,”did Mr. Xia bet a few pieces to play?”

“I did join in the fun and place a few orders for fun ...” Xia ruofei smiled faintly.

Yu mingdong asked with some interest,””Oh? How much did Mr. Xia invest?”

Xia ruofei thought for a moment and said,”more than 20 million!” I didn’t calculate the exact number. ” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

He had made a higher bid because he was sure that the eight raw stones he had invested in would definitely win the bid after spending about twelve million Yuan.

Otherwise, if he said that he had invested more than 12 million Yuan and won the bid for every piece, it would be a little hard to explain.

What Xia ruofei did not expect was that the number he reported would give Yu mingdong a big shock.

“More than 20 million!” Yu mingdong was speechless.

He had only invested less than 40 million Yuan today. After all, a small and medium – sized Jade merchant like him could not compare to the Hengfeng group.
