Chapter 1372: Surprised and happy (1)

Translator: 549690339

Song Rui had been in the southeast province for a long time, so it was not his first time coming to Egret Island. He looked at the road outside and asked in confusion,””Ruofei, where are you planning to go?”

Xia ruofei answered while driving,””Go to Heron Island University! My godsister is studying here, so godmother asked me to bring her something. I’ll also take her out for dinner!”

“I know! You’re Lin Qiao, right?” Song Rui said,”your sister who sacrificed her comrades!”

Xia ruofei nodded with a smile. Thinking of Lin Qiao, he had a doting look on his face.

Zhao Yongjun had never heard of this before. He was once an excellent soldier and immediately asked song Rui.

Song Rui briefly introduced Lin Qiao’s family to Zhao Yongjun. Zhao Yongjun was silent for a while before he gave Xia ruofei a thumbs up and said,””Ruofei, you’ve done a good job in this matter!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Brother Zhao, Hu Zi sacrificed himself to protect me. It’s my duty to do anything for godmother and Qiao’ er!”

“Good man! You’re responsible!” Zhao Yongjun patted Xia ruofei’s shoulder in admiration.

At this time, song Rui suddenly said,”Oh right!” I heard that Heron Island University is only open to tourists. Only a certain number of people can go in every day, and they won’t accept any more people!”

“Is that so?” Zhao Yongjun raised his eyebrows and said,”Xiao Rui, go and find someone you know. Don’t let us be stopped at the school gate and delay ruofei’s matters!”

“Alright!” The song family’s power was deeply rooted in the southeast province. Naturally, song Rui had some acquaintances on Egret Island. As he spoke, he took out his phone and looked through his address book, thinking about who to call.

After all, this was just a small matter. There was no need to alarm the higher – ups.

At this moment, Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”no, no, no! Why did he have to find an acquaintance! We’ll find our own way in!”

“Think of a way?” Song Rui said in confusion,”December is the peak season for tourism on Heron Island. If the number of tourists reaches the upper limit, we definitely won’t be able to enter the campus ...” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Xia ruofei smiled mysteriously and said,”anyway, you guys don’t have to worry about it. I’ll find a way!” Brother Zhao, song Rui, you guys should change your way of thinking sometimes. Don’t try to find connections to mediate when you’re in trouble ...”

Zhao Yongjun was stunned for a moment, then he laughed and said,””Fine! Then we won’t care anymore and will listen to your command!”

Zhao Yongjun and the others were used to this. No matter what they encountered, they could find someone they knew who could solve the problem. One or two phone calls were all it took for the problem to be solved. Zhao Yongjun felt that Xia ruofei’s suggestion of finding a solution by himself was a little fresh.

Everyone chatted as they drove. The commercial vehicle that Hou Liang and Xu Zixuan were in naturally followed the Knight XV.

“Ruofei, this doesn’t seem to be the way to Heron Island University, right?” song Rui asked hesitantly.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you mean the main entrance of Heron Island University and the Botanic Garden, right?” We’re not going in from there! The security at the entrance is the tightest ...”

In fact, he had heard from Lin Qiao that Egret Island University was not open to the public. So last night, he had gone online to look for a ‘School Guide’. With the help of the GPS, Xia ruofei quickly drove to a school gate near the bus stop of Egret Island University Hospital.

This was a small door that many foreigners didn’t know about, and there were fewer tourists.

Xia ruofei drove to the car stop at the school gate. An obviously lazy security guard walked over. Xia ruofei rolled down the window and smiled.”Hello, Sir. We’re from the three mountain paradise Corporation. We’re here to consult professor Chen Siming on some legal issues!”

Zhao Yongjun and song Rui watched with interest as Xia ruofei tricked the security guards. They thought it was interesting.

Sure enough, the security here was not as strict as the main entrance. The security guard asked casually,””Which building are you going to?”

“Professor Chen said he’s in the law school building ...” Xia ruofei answered smoothly.

The security guard nodded and said,”please register here!” Both cars need to be registered!”

“Alright! Thanks!” Xia ruofei quickly registered the license plates of the two cars on the notebook.

Then, the security guard gave them a simple guide on which way to go to the law school. After Xia ruofei expressed his gratitude, he slowly started the car and entered the interior of Heron Island University.

He looked back at song Rui and Zhao Yongjun proudly and said with a smile,””How is it? My method will work, right?”

“It’s quite interesting!”Zhao Yongjun laughed.

In fact, these guides were all available on the internet. Many ordinary tourists used all kinds of methods to get into Heron Island University. This was the simple and real life of ordinary people. Zhao Yongjun and the others felt very fresh.

In fact, as long as one drove here, it was easy to enter the campus. They just had to register, get a pass, and return it when they left the school. Most of the time, one could enter and leave the school by car. That was why Xia ruofei did not ask song Rui to find someone to coordinate with.

The main reason why Heron Island University limited the number of tourists was that too many people came to play, which would affect the normal teaching order. This also reflected the excellent environment and beautiful scenery of Heron Island University.
