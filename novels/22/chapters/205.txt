“Ha! “Pingzi, I think I found something ...” Xia ruofei laughed evilly. Guan Ping’s eyes dodged, but he acted as if nothing had happened,””I don’t know what you are talking about! Hey! Anything else? If there’s nothing else, I have to go back to the company! I sneaked out ...” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”little ping, sister Zhao is indeed pretty!” If you don’t mind being in a relationship with an older brother, you can go after her boldly!” “Kid, do you still have anything to do?” Guan Ping said,”if you continue to talk nonsense, do you believe that I won’t care about the transfer of ownership?” “I don ‘t.” Xia ruofei laughed evilly.”As long as the agent is Zhao Xueqing, you can’t just ignore this matter!” “I ...” Guan Ping was so angry that he closed his laptop. He wanted to say something but stopped himself.”Ruofei, don’t say anything in front of sister Zhao! It’s just that he’s more to my liking. Besides ... He’s obviously a rich man, how can we be a good match?” Xia ruofei patted Guan Ping’s shoulder and said,”Pingzi, don’t belittle yourself. If you like her, then be bold and chase her! I’ll back you up! But then again, we don’t know anything about this sister Zhao! If she already has a family, then forget it, but we can’t be a third party!” “Ruofei, do you think I’m that kind of person?” Guan Ping smiled bitterly. “That’s good!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it just so happens that we’re going to transfer the ownership soon. You’ll have many opportunities to interact with each other. You should get to know each other first. As long as she’s single, you’re free to do it!” “Let’s understand it first!” Guan Ping said without much confidence,”love at first sight ... Even I don’t think it’s reliable!” “Mm! You can handle this kind of thing yourself!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”let me give you a sentence: He would attack when it was time! Otherwise, it’ll be too late for regrets in the future. ” “I know ...” Guan Ping said,”ruofei, don’t worry about the transfer! I’ll call you when I need you to sign the papers, and I’ll take care of the rest. ” “Alright! You’ve worked hard!” Xia ruofei said with a smile. The two of them paid the bill and Xia ruofei drove Guan Ping back to the company. On the way, Xia ruofei asked,”Oh right, pingzi. You’ve been in the three mountains for so many years. You’re more familiar with all aspects. Do you know if there are any good wineries in the three mountains?” I want to buy a batch of white wine. ” Xia ruofei suddenly remembered his idea of getting some white wine to store in the spirit map space. With the difference in the flow of time and the unique environment, he could easily get his hands on precious old wine. Guan Ping replied without thinking,”Ding Feng wine factory!” Although the price is very affordable, the people of the three mountains basically love to drink the rich and abundant Drunken Eight Immortals white wine. They are not even used to the Maotai Wuliangye that costs a few hundred or even a few thousand per bottle!” Xia ruofei nodded and agreed. I’ll go back and understand the situation first!” Guan Ping’s recommendation was exactly what Xia ruofei wanted. This kind of well – known local time – honored brand might not have any star products, but it won in its long history and the quality of the wine was generally good. It was the kind that was good and cheap. After sending Guan Ping to the company, Xia ruofei decided to go to Ding Feng winery to take a look. Xia ruofei found the location of Ding Feng winery on the car navigation system and drove to the suburbs. The Dingfeng winery was located in Lingshui District, West of Sanshan city. Xia ruofei drove for more than 20 minutes before the GPS accurately brought him to the entrance of Ding Feng winery. He told the guard that he was here to talk about business. The guard saw that Xia ruofei’s car was extraordinary and his attitude was more polite. He called the factory and soon a man in his early thirties came out. The man looked at Xia ruofei’s car and said enthusiastically,””Hello, Sir! I’m the deputy manager of the sales department of Ding Feng winery, my surname is Qi!” “Hello, manager Qi.” Xia ruofei smiled gently and said,”I want to buy a batch of white wine, so I came to understand the situation.” “Alright, alright, alright. Please come in, please come in!” Manager Qi said quickly. “Take my car!” Xia ruofei said. The two of them got into the car. Xia ruofei started the car and under manager Qi’s guidance, he drove to a building in the factory and parked the car. Manager Qi enthusiastically led Xia ruofei to his office and personally made tea for him. Then, he sat down and asked,””What’s your name, Sir?” “My surname is Xia.” “So it’s Mr. Xia.” Manager Qi asked,”what kind of white wine would you like to buy, Mr. Xia?” The Drunken Eight Immortals and white brew produced by our factory are very popular among consumers. ” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”manager Qi, if I wanted to buy those bottles of Drunken Eight Immortals, I could have just gone to the supermarket. Why would I come to the winery personally?” So ... I’m here to ask if your winery has a large jar of white wine for sale?” “Wine in bulk?” Manager Qi was stunned for a moment before he said,”this is available for sale, but the quality is ...” Manager Qi was a little disappointed, but at the same time, he was also very puzzled. This person in front of her was obviously rich! How could someone without money drive such a luxury car? But why did this rich guy buy wine in bulk? Those were for small village Stores and small supermarkets. Although the bottled wine from Ding Feng winery wasn’t expensive, it was still just a bottle of wine. People with a little bit of money wouldn’t even drink it. “Manager Qi, you’ve misunderstood,” Xia ruofei said with a smile. I mean ... For wine like Drunken Eight Immortals, can you guys just sell it to me in a big jar?” “You mean custom – made?” Manager Qi also came to his senses. “That’s what it means, right? By the way, what’s the price of an ordinary Drunken Eight Immortals in your market? I don’t want aged wine. ” Xia ruofei asked. “The one that sells the most. It’s 18 Yuan a bottle, and it’s 500 ml.” Manager Qi said immediately. “I want this type!” Xia ruofei asked,”can we order the big jars here?” A jar ... A hundred or two hundred catties will do. ” “Then ... If I may ask, how much do you need?” Manager Qi asked carefully. If the demand was low, they might not do this business. After all, it would require changing the production process, which would be more or less troublesome. “The first batch should be around 5000 catties!” Xia ruofei said indifferently. “No problem! Mr. Xia, we’ll accept this business!” Manager Qi immediately said,”but ... You also know that it’s more troublesome to order a custom order, so the price ...” “State your price first!” Xia ruofei said calmly. ” 200 catties per jar, 4500 per jar!” Manager Qi said,”Mr. Xia, this price is really not too expensive. The cost of a large wine jar is about 400 to 500 yuan. In total, we’ll only charge you 20 yuan for 500 grams ...” “Sure!” Xia ruofei said,”but you must ensure the quality of the wine. Don’t take cheap wine in bulk to replace the good quality!” “I wouldn’t dare!” Manager Qi quickly said,”please don’t worry. Our Dingfeng winery has been around for decades and we have always been honest. At that time, you can inspect the goods as you wish. If there’s a problem with the wine, we’re willing to compensate you ten times the amount!” [PS] it’s raining cats and dogs outside today. Steel gun was completely “wet” from head to toe when he returned home from work. He didn’t even have time to change his clothes before he turned on his computer to look at the rankings for next month. The gap is getting smaller and smaller. Brothers and sisters, let’s have more firepower! Whether the steel spear will successfully defend its honor or lose its integrity, it’s all up to you ...
