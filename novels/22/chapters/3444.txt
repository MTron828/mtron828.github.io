Chapter 3445: Fighting on their own (1)

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but say,”wife, you’ve seen through it, but don’t say it…”

Ling Qingxue was so happy that she couldn’t stop laughing.

Just as the two of them were talking, a rumbling sound rang out, and the entire square began to shake gently.

Xia ruofei quickly pulled Ling Qingxue to his side. This way, if anything dangerous happened, he would be able to protect Ling Qingxue at the first moment.

There was no danger, but the two of them still had their eyes wide open as they looked ahead.

On the ground of the square not far in front of the two, steps began to appear, and they continued to extend upward.

There were two steps in total, about two meters apart.

Each step was made of Obsidian, and it was about two meters wide and 15 to 20 centimeters tall.

A flight of steps seemed to appear out of thin air, constantly growing upward. There was no support at the bottom, but it could stand firmly. It was a rather strange scene.

“What’s the situation?” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but Mutter to himself.

Ling Qingxue said,”it seems like the mission to reach the eighth level of the trial Pagoda will fall on these two steps. Let’s wait and see!” When the steps are stabilized, I think the mission for the eighth level will be released!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes!” It should be like this …”

The two of them slowly raised their heads, because the steps were rising higher and higher, and gradually became smaller and smaller in their field of vision, as if they were directly leading to the sky.

There was no day or night in the trial Pagoda, and of course, there was no sun or moon.

The sky above them always maintained the same brightness, which was gentler and not dazzling. At the same time, it made the entire space in a more comfortable light.

Xia ruofei didn’t fly high on his sword. After all, he had always been traumatized and felt that there was a fatal danger hidden high up.

Hence, Xia ruofei did not know how high they were.

However, he knew very well that these were all small spaces in the Tower of Trials, and there was definitely a limit to the height. In theory, as long as he kept flying up, he would definitely touch the space membrane wall.

From the looks of it, the Obsidian steps had extended to five or six hundred steps, and its height was almost a hundred meters. It didn’t seem to have touched the spatial membrane. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Just as Xia ruofei was wondering how high this small space was, the extension of the Obsidian steps seemed to have stopped. The square had stopped shaking and the rumbling sound had gradually disappeared.

Xia ruofei looked up and saw that the end of the Obsidian steps was at least a hundred meters high. There was a familiar light screen door.

What was this situation? This thought flashed through Xia ruofei’s mind.

He subconsciously looked at the mission bar in his perceptual mirror, but there was no hint.

“RUO Fei, look!” Ling Qingxue shouted.

Xia ruofei turned his attention to the direction Ling Qingxue was pointing at. He looked up and saw a stone tablet slowly rising up between the two steps. At the same time, a smaller stone tablet rose up on both sides of the two steps. More accurately, the small stone tablets were more like signs.

“Let’s go and take a look!” Xia ruofei said.

He and Ling Qingxue walked towards the two steps.

On both sides of the signboard – like stone steles, the left side had the words “Jindan” and the right side had the words “Qi refining.”

Xia ruofei suddenly had a bad feeling. Did Wanwan want him and Ling Qingxue to go through the test separately?

In fact, he already had a bad feeling when the two steps appeared. The two signs were already very obvious.

If Ling Qingxue could take the test with him, he was confident that he would be able to carry her all the way.

However, if the two of them were to break through the levels separately, then he would not be able to help at all.

How could the mission of the 8th level of the trial Pagoda be so easy to complete?

Xia ruofei knew very well that even though Ling Qingxue’s cultivation had increased greatly, especially her spiritual power, she would only be able to reach the sixth level of the trial Pagoda at most. It would be very difficult for her to go any further.

If Ling Qingxue had been alone, it would have been very difficult for her to pass the eighth level’s test.

Xia ruofei’s expression turned ugly, but he still held on to a glimmer of hope. He looked at the stone tablet between the two steps.

As expected, the stone tablet had the instructions for this mission.

This time, the mission was directly posted on the stone tablet, but the mission bar in the field of vision of the perceptual mirror did not have any movement.

Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue read the words carefully.

Xia ruofei’s expression was getting uglier and uglier. Ling Qingxue, on the other hand, was very calm. She even seemed to be relieved of a burden.

Just as Xia ruofei was worried about, he and Ling Qingxue had to take the test alone. They had to walk up the Obsidian steps on the left and right.

The content of the mission was very simple. If he successfully reached the top, the mission would be considered complete.

In fact, the light screen door at the top of the Obsidian steps was the passage to the top of the tower of Trials.

The stone tablet even clearly stated that this was the final test of the trial Pagoda.

This was because the ninth level of the trial Pagoda, which was also the top level, actually did not have any tests arranged..
