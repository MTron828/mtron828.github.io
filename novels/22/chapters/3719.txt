“Otherwise?” Ling Qingxue said,”so don’t think that the nascent Soul Stage is too far away now. Who knows, you might accidentally break through as you practice? I still need to make plans early!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.”Qingxue is very confident in me! Fine! Then we’ll plan when we have time. But 1 definitely won’t be like sect leader Chen, who made a big fuss just because 1 broke through to the nascent Soul Stage. We have to keep a low profile …”

“That’s because the cultivation world has been in decline for the past few years. There isn’t even a single original infant stage cultivator.” Song Wei continued,”sect leader Chen’s breakthrough was mostly due to the opportunity that Chen Xuan brought back from the mystic Luna realm. He’s inviting all his friends and family to spread the name of the first heaven society!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yeah!” After all, he’s the head of a sect, and his perspective on the problem is different from ours … Let’s not talk about this. Speaking of going out, 1 really thought of a place?”

“What place? Is it very interesting?” Ling Qingxue asked impatiently.

Xia ruofei laughed and looked at Song Wei,””Wei Wei should know about this place.”

“Me?” Song Wei was stunned at first, but she quickly thought of a place.

From Xia ruofei’s words, it was easy to tell that this place had something to do with her and probably had nothing to do with Ling Qingxue. However, it had something to do with cultivation. The answer was obvious.

“RUO Fei, you mean … The ancient tomb of Mount Yu?” Song Wei asked after a moment of hesitation.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””At that time, my cultivation was too low, and there were still many places that 1 hadn’t explored. 1 also felt that there seemed to be some secrets hidden there. Now 1 should have some ability to protect myself, so it’s time to go back and take a look!”

Ling Qingxue, who was listening at the side, was dumbfounded. She couldn’t help but say,””What Mount Yu tomb? Are you two still hiding your little secret from me?”

“Don’t talk nonsense. What secret is there?”Song Wei blushed.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I should have told you, but you might have forgotten.” Back then, Wei Wei accompanied me to explore the ancient tomb on Mount Yu. Later on, an accident happened and she was in a coma. I thought of many ways to wake her up. It was also because of this accident that Wei Wei’s physique improved, and that’s why she was able to embark on the path of cultivation.”

Ling Qingxue came to a sudden realization and said,””Yes, yes, yes, you did tell me that, but I was too angry at that time …”

At this point, Ling Qingxue felt a little embarrassed. At the same time, it also brought back memories of the past.

At that time, Xia ruofei was still her boyfriend! Because of the accident in the Yu mountain tomb, Song Wei started to cultivate. Later, she cultivated together with Xia ruofei by accident, which led to the subtle relationship between the three of them today.

Thinking of this, Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but glare at Xia ruofei, her expression a little resentful.

Song Wei was a little embarrassed. Although it had been a long time and the relationship between the three of them was more harmonious now, when she faced Ling Qingxue, she couldn’t help but feel a little guilty. After all, no matter what the reason was, from the end result, she was the third party.

Today, Xia ruofei brought up the past and Song Wei’s guilt naturally increased.

Xia ruofei saw that the situation was not right! She quickly changed the topic.”Vivi, you should remember that there were some areas in the tomb that we didn’t dare to explore. There was a very powerful spirit there, and we almost lost our lives. 1 don’t care if we get anything this time, 1 must get back at you!”

As expected, Ling Qingxue and Song Wei’s attention was immediately drawn to the tomb of King Yu.

Song Wei was more of a quiet person, but Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but say,””How can 1 miss out on such an exciting thing? RUO Fei, 1’11 let go of what happened last time, but you two can’t leave me behind this time!”

“We’re going to explore an ancient tomb, not on a date …” Xia ruofei could not help but mumble.

“I don’t care! In any case, the two of you can go out in pairs, and I can’t stay in the Peach Blossom Island alone to guard an empty room!” Ling Qingxue said.

Song Wei blushed and said,”what do you mean by going out in pairs!” Qingxue, don’t spout nonsense.”

Then, Song Wei said to Xia ruofei,””RUO Fei, why don’t you … You go by yourself. Qingxue and I will stay on the Peach Blossom Island to cultivate.”

Song Wei’s original intention was to avoid suspicion. After all, if she and Xia ruofei went to King Yu’s tomb together, even with the black Phoenix flying boat, the round trip would take at least two days. After all, they still had to explore the ancient tomb. They could not just turn back after they reached the place.

If it was really just her and Xia ruofei, there was no guarantee that Ling Qingxue would not have other thoughts.

Therefore, she decided not to go herself. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

However, as soon as Song Wei finished speaking, the first person to disagree was Ling Qingxue.

“No, no, no, you can’t not go!” Ling Qingxue shouted. That place has a special meaning for you. This is considered a revisit to an old place, so how can you not go? I wanted to say that the three of us should go together!”

Ling Qingxue was a lively person by nature. She had to stay on peach source Island and in the Yan Huang tower all day long. Although the cultivation environment was so good that it made people envious, she still felt bored.

This time, Xia ruofei finally decided to go out for a walk. Furthermore, it was an exciting ancient tomb exploration. How could she be willing to stay? she definitely wanted to go with him.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and nodded.””Alright! Then the three of us will go together! I’ll let my adopted husband know in a while. I’m not worried about him staying here to look after the house. Let’s have a good rest today and set off early tomorrow morning!”

“Awesome! It’s decided then!” Ling Qingxue immediately cheered.

Song Wei was helpless and could only nod,”Alright, then we’ll do as RUO Fei says!”

After the three of them cleaned up the kitchen, Song Wei and Ling Qingxue went back to their rooms to take a nap. Xia ruofei took the elevator down to Li Yifu’s room.

He first tested Li Yifu’s cultivation, and at the same time, he cleared Li Yifu’s doubts.

Xia ruofei did not tell Li Yifu that he had broken through to the advanced stage of the Golden elixir realm. In fact, he did not think there was a need to publicize it. It was enough for his two close female friends to know.

After Xia ruofei’s guidance, Li Yifu was naturally grateful.

In fact, at his age and with such a poor cultivation Foundation, he was able to break through to the Golden core stage in his lifetime. It could be said that Xia ruofei was the one who nurtured him. To Li Yifu, this was the grace of rebirth. He definitely respected and respected Xia ruofei from the bottom of his heart.

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,””Foster husband, since you call me martial granduncle, then 1 can’t just have an empty title. Guiding you in your cultivation is also part of my duty. You don’t have to thank me so solemnly every time. It makes me a little embarrassed …”

“Yes, I will remember.” Li Yifu said.

Xia ruofei felt a little helpless. He knew that Li Yifu would always say that he remembered it, but he would definitely repeat it the next time. There was no suspense at all.

Xia ruofei shook his head and said,”foster husband, I’m going to take my two cultivation partners with me tomorrow. I’m very assured that you’ll be in charge of the peach source Island.” If there’s anything that you think is troublesome, please contact me on the phone!”

“Yes! Don’t worry, martial granduncle, this disciple will look after the house!” Li Yifu said.

In the past, when he had stayed behind to guard the Peach Blossom Island, he had felt a little apprehensive. Without Xia ruofei here, he had lost his backbone.

However, with the passage of time, his understanding of the Taixu xuanqing formation had deepened. Most importantly, he had now broken through to the Aurous core stage and was considered a figure at the top of the pyramid in the cultivation world. Naturally, he was more confident in his own strength.

Xia ruofei patted Li Yifu’s shoulder and said with a smile,””Alright! I’m at ease with you handling things! Then we’ll leave tomorrow morning. You don’t have to send us off..”
