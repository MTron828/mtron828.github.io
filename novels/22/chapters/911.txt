Chapter 912: Innate blocked meridians (1)

Translator: 549690339

Lin Qiao, who was sitting next to Jennifer, was the first one to stand up and asked eagerly,””Jennifer, what happened to little Haoran?”

Jennifer, who was very easy to approach at the airport, had no time to answer Lin Qiao’s question. She just squatted beside her seat and kept calling little Haoran’s English name.

At this time, Tang Yitian, who was sitting in the business class behind the first class cabin, also rushed in with an anxious face.

He quickly checked his son’s condition and then shouted,””Flight attendant! Train attendant! My child’s illness is acting up, please return the plane immediately!”

At this time, the purser, who had heard the commotion, rushed over and said,””Sir, please calm down. I’ll immediately broadcast the search for a doctor. In addition, we also have Emergency Medicine on our plane. You ...”

“The medicine is useless. Get the plane to land nearby!” Tang Yitian shouted,”I’ll bear everyone’s losses and your airline’s losses!”

Xia ruofei quickly took off his headphones and walked to the other side of the corridor.””Don’t worry, Mr. Tang. I have some medical skills. I’ll take a look at little Haoran first ...”

Hearing this, Tang Yitian felt as if he had grasped onto a life – saving straw, but he soon revealed a disappointed look. He said with a bitter smile,””It’s no use. Haoran ...”

He then turned to the purser and said,”I’m sorry, I was too excited just now. You ... You should go and ask the captain first!” If you really can’t ... Then forget it ...”

Jennifer said in a sobbing tone,” We can’t just ignore Allan! He ... He’s in a very dangerous situation ...”

Tang Yitian’s eyes revealed a trace of despair, and he said sorrowfully,”Jennifer, I know, I know ... But the doctor can’t save Haoran ...”

Xia ruofei glanced at little Haoran. His eyes were tightly shut and his teeth were clenched. His entire body was trembling and his exposed skin was flushed. Beads of sweat were forming on his forehead. Although he had lost consciousness, he still looked like he was in pain.

Xia ruofei didn’t dare to delay. He quickly squatted down and put his hand on little Haoran’s wrist.

As soon as Xia ruofei’s hand touched little Haoran’s skin, he felt a burning sensation. He quickly touched little Haoran’s arm and felt that the temperature was very high. It was even higher than the temperature of a normal child with a high fever. It was as if he had touched charcoal and it was very hot.

Xia ruofei took a deep breath and placed his hand on little Haoran’s wrist again. Then, without hesitation, he used his strong mental energy to check little Haoran’s pulse. The accuracy of a normal pulse was not high, and Xia ruofei’s medical skills were not at this level. Only by using his mental energy to directly check the condition of the meridians could he find the cause of the illness the fastest.

However, when Xia ruofei’s spiritual energy entered little Haoran’s meridians, he immediately felt a block, as if it had entered a thick layer of oil. It was very difficult for him to continue.

Xia ruofei had once used his spiritual power to check Song Wei’s meridians and it was a completely different feeling.

How did this happen? Xia ruofei frowned.

Little Haoran’s condition seemed to be very critical. If he was given the solution of the spirit Heart Flower petals, Xia ruofei was not sure if it would be effective.

The condition of little Haoran’s meridians was too strange. Xia ruofei had studied so many Chinese medicine books, but he had never found any book that recorded such a condition.

If little Haoran was sick, there was a high possibility that the spirit Heart Flower petal solution would be effective.

But what if he wasn’t sick? A sentence appeared in Xia ruofei’s mind.

He hesitated for a moment, then directly used his spiritual sense to contact Xia Qing, who was in the spirit map space, hoping that Xia Qing could provide him with some useful information.

Xia Qing wasn’t a real human being. All of his knowledge was implanted into him by the previous or previous master of the spirit map space. If there were records in his “database”, then he was naturally knowledgeable and experienced. But if there were no records, then he was completely and utterly ignorant.

Therefore, it was a matter of luck.

Xia ruofei transmitted little Haoran’s condition to Xia Qing using his divine sense.

Xia Qing muttered to herself for a moment in the spirit map space before she replied with her spiritual sense,””Master, the situation you’re talking about is very similar to a congenital Meridian blockage!”

“Congenital Meridian blockage?” Xia ruofei muttered to himself.

Moreover, while he was communicating with Xia Qing with his spiritual sense, he couldn’t help but say this sentence with his mouth.

Tang Yitian, who was standing on the side, was already disheartened, but when he heard Xia ruofei say the words “congenital Meridian blockage,” his eyes suddenly lit up. He grabbed Xia ruofei’s arm and said,””Yes! Yes! Little brother, you can see that Haoran has a congenital blocked Meridian, so you must have a way to save him, right?”

In fact, congenital blockage of meridians was not a disease. Tang Yitian had come to this conclusion through a highly respected elder. So when Xia ruofei said that he knew medicine, Tang Yitian didn’t have any hope. But when Xia ruofei accidentally said the words “congenital blockage of meridians”, Tang Yitian seemed to come back to life.

Since he could find the cause of little Haoran’s illness so quickly, Xia ruofei probably had a way to treat Haoran. This was what Tang Yitian thought.

Xia ruofei glanced at Tang Yitian and said,””Don’t worry, Mr. Tang. I’ll give little Haoran a careful examination first. ”

“Right! Irene, don’t disturb Dr. Xia’s work!” Jennifer quickly said.

Tang Yitian quickly let go of Xia ruofei’s arm and said,””Okay, okay, okay. Doctor Xia, I’ll leave everything to you.”

“I will definitely do my best.” Xia ruofei nodded slightly and continued to communicate with Xia Qing using his divine sense.

“Master, when everyone is born, their meridians will contain innate Qi.” Xia Qing quickly explained,”most people will have their innate Qi slowly dissipate not long after they are born. Only a very small part of it will nourish the body and meridians. “However, there are a few people who have too much innate Qi in their bodies. In addition, the meridians of newborns are narrow. Before they can dissipate it in time, it will form a blockage in the meridians. This is almost fatal. People with innate blocked meridians will not live past four years old ...”

“I think little Haoran is at least six or seven years old.” Xia ruofei said to Xia Qing with his divine sense.

“Then he must have reached a very dangerous level.” Xia Qing said with certainty,”the situation of blocked meridians becomes more and more serious as one grows older. This is because the innate Qi has been deposited in the meridians for a long time and will gradually solidify. If the meridians are completely blocked and the qi and blood can’t be circulated at all, then you’re not far from death.”

“Then, why is little Haoran’s body so hot?” Xia ruofei asked, puzzled. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Xia Qing said without hesitation,”it’s very likely that the innate Qi in his body is yang. It might even be the rare innate pure Yang Qi. If that’s the case, then the danger is even greater.”

Xia ruofei quickly used his spiritual will to ask,”he’s in a critical situation. What can I do to save him?” Are the petals of the spirit Heart Flower effective?”

Xia Qing said,”master, congenital blocked meridians are not a disease. The petals of the spirit Heart Flower can’t work.” If it’s a temporary solution, you can use your spiritual force to forcefully clear the most serious or even completely blocked parts of his body. However, this can only treat the symptoms, not the root cause. After a long time, it will become blocked again. ”

“I can’t care so much anymore, saving my life is more important!” Xia ruofei said.

“Master, please wait a moment!” Xia Qing anxiously said. In fact, there is a better way to solve the root of the problem. It’s just that it will take a longer time, but it will be of great benefit to you. ”

“Then hurry up and tell me.” Xia ruofei frowned slightly.”Little Haoran’s condition seems to be very dangerous. If we don’t save him in time, his life might be in danger.”

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing quickly said,”in fact, if you want to completely solve the hidden danger in his body, the best way is to guide this innate pure Yang Qi out of his body. Moreover, the innate pure Yang Qi is not enough for that child, but it is a great supplement for you. If you can absorb this pure Yang Qi, it will be of great help to your future cultivation of the ‘great Dao Arts’.”

“But I don’t know what to do!” Xia ruofei used his spiritual will to communicate.”I should be able to use my spiritual power to slowly guide them out of my body. But How do I absorb them?”

“If master had already practiced the great Dao Arts, he would naturally be able to easily absorb the innate pure Yang Qi. But now, it is indeed a bit troublesome ...” Xia Qing hesitated as she spoke.

Just as Xia ruofei couldn’t wait any longer and was about to use his spiritual power to clear little Haoran’s meridians, Xia Qing suddenly said,””Master, I’ll teach you a simple technique that will allow you to temporarily store the innate pure Yang Qi in your dantian. When you start cultivating the great Dao Arts, you’ll be able to get twice the result with half the effort.”

“I thought you couldn’t teach me anything outside of my ability?” Xia ruofei asked, surprised.

Xia ruofei still remembered what happened clearly. Xia Qing knew a lot about the spirit map space, including the origin and effects of the items inside the transparent protective shield. However, because Xia ruofei was not strong enough, he could not reveal a word due to the rules.

Xia Qing said,”strictly speaking, this is not something outside of your ability. You now basically have the strength to open the human – shaped jade talisman and cultivate the first three levels of the” great Dao Sutra “. Compared to the” great Dao Sutra “, the magic art I’m going to teach you is very insignificant.”

The situation was urgent, and Xia ruofei did not have time to explain in detail. He said directly,””Alright! There’s no time to waste, you have to teach me this technique now! I’m going to start unblocking little Haoran’s meridians and allowing him to absorb the pure Yang Qi!”
