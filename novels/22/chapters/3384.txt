Chapter 3385: Unfathomable (1)

Translator: 549690339

When Ling Qingxue heard Xia ruofei say that the time formation was ineffective, her heart was already in her mouth.

After Xia ruofei said a few words to her, he went straight into the stone pillar array. Her gaze naturally followed Xia ruofei’s to the stone pillar array.

To Ling Qingxue, the stone pillar array was so densely packed that just the distribution of the stone pillars was enough to make her dizzy, not to mention the fact that each stone pillar had different levels of complexity of array patterns on it.

It could be said that Ling Qingxue knew nothing about arrays. To her, seeing those array patterns was no different from reading a heavenly book.

Hence, in this stage, she could only watch from the side. She could not even give Xia ruofei any advice.

The messy array patterns in Ling Qingxue’s eyes were like treasures in Xia ruofei’s eyes. It was as if he had opened up a new world.

Xia ruofei’s array skills were considered high in the modern cultivation world.

After all, due to the change in the cultivation environment and the collective concealment of high – Level cultivators, there had been a shortage of talents in the cultivation world hundreds of years ago, and the inheritance had been cut off. Even if there were a few talented cultivators in the array Dao, without a good teacher and enough books, it was impossible for them to become successful by themselves.

On the other hand, Xia ruofei had obtained a large number of array diagrams and ancient array books from the Jade talisman of inheritance. He had also spent time sorting out and studying these array theories. His starting point was much higher than other cultivators in the modern cultivation world.

But even so, when Xia ruofei saw the complicated stone pillar array in front of him, he could not help but feel that it was unfathomable.

The distribution of these stone pillars contained very profound array Dao laws, and when combined with the array patterns on each stone pillar, there were even more changes.

Xia ruofei could basically confirm that the fifth level of the trial Pagoda was a test of a cultivator’s array Dao level.

Even though the first segment of the mission, which was to pass through the star Fern thorn ring, seemed to have nothing to do with array Dao, when he thought about it, using a large – scale flame area attack array should be the only way to crack the star Fern thorn ring.

Of course, there were also cultivators at the original infant stage or higher who could rely on their own strength to break through.

However, Xia ruofei was also very clear that if a nascent Soul Stage cultivator or even higher came to the fifth level of the Tower of Trials, the difficulty of the star Fern thorn Ring Ring would definitely not be like what he had encountered. Every test in the Tower of Trials was tailored for the cultivator s cultivation level. It would not be so easy to pass.

In the second part of the quest, he needed to use a flame attack spell formation with a small area. If he continued to use the spell formation from the first part of the quest, he would not have enough time.

In the first and second parts of the task, there was also a possibility that a cultivator might not understand the theory of array Dao at all, but he was a treasure boy with ready – made array flags on him or a one – time magic weapon that could create a large number of flame attacks. He could also pass the test.

However, in the third segment of the mission, they couldn’t compete with their wealth. There was no chance of taking advantage of the situation. They could only rely on their solid basic knowledge of array Dao to make a judgment.

When Xia ruofei thought of this, he couldn’t help but click his tongue.

The scope of this trial Pagoda’s test was really comprehensive. Even if one could pass the first few stages by luck, once they reached the fifth level, most cultivators who did not have a solid foundation in array Dao would probably stop at the third stage of the mission.

At the very least, among the people who entered the mystic realm this time, it was likely that more than half of them would not be able to pass this segment of the test.

This included people like Ling Qingxue, who had no knowledge of arrays at all.

Of course, Ling Qingxue’s luck was good enough to meet up with Xia ruofei in advance. The two of them could move together after that. As long as Xia ruofei could pass this level, Ling Qingxue could be guaranteed entry to the next level of the trial Pagoda.

Xia ruofei cleared his mind and started to study the stone pillar array.

He wasn’t confident but the stone pillar array was very exquisite and complicated. It was far more complicated than any array he had ever set up. Even among the array diagrams that Xia ruofei had, there was no array that could be compared to the stone pillar needle in complexity. Therefore, even if he could not complete the task, he could still study the stone pillar array for ten hours. It would be a great boost to his array Dao level.

The quest itself was a great opportunity. This design concept seemed to run through all the quests in the Tower of Trials. At least so far, the quests in the first few levels of the Tower of Trials were all like this.

Xia ruofei didn’t study the formation patterns at first. Instead, he analyzed the height, distribution, and relative positions of each stone pillar.

The more he looked at it, the more he felt it was exquisite, and he couldn’t help but secretly praise it. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

The Dao of formations was as vast as the ocean.

Only by entering this ocean would one be able to feel the vastness of the ocean even deeper.

For someone who didn’t know anything about arrays, he couldn’t understand it at all. They were both formations, but the difference between the two could be infinitely close.

Xia ruofei studied it for about half an hour. The distribution of the array, the shape, position, and direction of each stone pillar were all engraved in his mind..
