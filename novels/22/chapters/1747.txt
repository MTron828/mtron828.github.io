Chapter 1748: Xia ruofei’s request (2)

Of course, before designing the overall plan, Lu Yifan still needed to have in – depth communication with the customer, mainly Xia ruofei. Only by fully understanding the customer’s needs and preferences would he be able to achieve twice the result with half the effort when designing.

Otherwise, the design would not be to the customer’s liking and would be faced with endless revisions. Those who had done design before knew that sometimes, revisions were even more torturous than redone the design, especially if it was revised a few times. The feeling was simply sour.

Lu Yifan didn’t need to worry about the specific surveying work. He walked side by side with Zhao Yongjun and looked around with great interest.

Lu Yifan laughed and said,”Sir, you guys have really picked up a treasure!” I really don’t understand why second young master Liu transferred this land to you at such a low price before he even heated it up. Is it because of those boring rumors? How could this place be as gloomy as the rumors said? It’s clearly a treasured land with good feng shui!”

As an architect, especially one from Huaxia, the metaphysics of Feng Shui was also a compulsory course for Lu Yifan. Although he couldn’t be compared to the other fengshui experts, he at least knew a little about it.

Zhao Yongjun turned to look at Xia ruofei and chuckled,””How are we supposed to know what the young master is thinking? Since he won the bid and doesn’t want it, we’ll just take it!”

Zhao Yongjun was well aware of the cause and effect, but he naturally wouldn’t tell Lu Yifan that much.

“Sir,” Lu Yifan sighed.”You’re taking advantage of me!”

Zhao Yongjun heard this and couldn’t help but laugh. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

The group of people chatted as they walked. Soon, they arrived at the lake. Lu Yifan asked,””Director Xia, do you have any requirements for the overall planning of this land? The more detailed, the better. This way, when we consider the design plan, we can have a target in mind. ”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,””In short, we’re going to build a Leisure Club, so the design just has to follow this theme. It’d be best if we could have more diversity, such as having both Eastern and Western elements, and also combining them together so that people wouldn’t feel out of place ...”

Lu Yifan nodded.”No problem. I’ll take it into consideration when I design it.”

Xia ruofei continued,”I’ll let brother Zhao and the others discuss with you the specific function requirements!” I only have a slightly more specific request, and that is, in this area, from here ... About the location of the Crooked Tree in front, this circle is about 300 square meters. I hope to design a small independent villa ...”

Xia ruofei said as he walked to the eye of the array. He lifted his foot and stepped on it a few times before saying,”We need to arrange a big room for this position, with a large floor – to – Ceiling glass facing the lake, open a glass door, extend from here to the lakeside, and make a terrace ... That’s roughly it.”

Xia ruofei’s request was very specific, so Lu Yifan immediately jotted it down in his notebook. He also called for the staff to do a precise survey of the place and mark the key points that Xia ruofei had just pointed out.

This request wasn’t difficult for a designer. After all, they hadn’t started designing yet. It was like a piece of white paper. It wasn’t difficult for the customer to draw a specific pattern on a certain position on the paper.

“Alright, I’ll remember it.” Lu Yifan asked,”Mr. Xia, do you have any other requests?”

Xia ruofei said,”that’s all for now. I have a new idea. I’ll contact you as soon as possible.”

In fact, the layout of the entire plot of land had to fit the aura of the nine turns universe formation. However, Xia ruofei could not design for Lu Yifan, so he could only wait for their design plan to come out and then make adjustments according to the specific plan.

Fortunately, Xia ruofei had already understood this natural formation. Besides, the layout of the building was only a supplementary function. When the time came, he just had to make some adjustments to the parts that were out of line and the other parts of the design. It would not be difficult to make it fit the aura.

“No problem! You can contact me anytime, President Xia!” Lu Yifan said.

Then, he took out a business card and handed it to Xia ruofei. This beige business card had Lu Yifan’s name written on it, followed by his phone number, WeChat QR code, and other contact information. There was no title. It was obvious that this was Lu Yifan’s personal contact information. He must have had another set of business cards at work.

Xia ruofei also gave his business card to Lu Yifan, and then the group walked in another direction.

In the end, song Rui’s turn came to Zhuo Yiyi. This lady really didn’t mind that song Rui didn’t pick her up. The reason she was late was purely because ... She had overslept. When they met, she kept apologizing to song Rui.

Song Rui also heaved a sigh of relief.

Actually, Zhuo Yiyi did not have much work to do today. She was mainly here to check on the antique architecture and the interior design after the design proposal was out to prevent common mistakes. She had not started on the design yet, so naturally, she did not have much work to do.

However, song Rui wanted to see Zhuo Yiyi, and when Zhuo Yiyi heard that the architectural design company was coming over to look at the venue today, she immediately took the initiative to come over and take a look at Yingluo. She was already getting paid by the club, so she felt bad if she just took the money without doing anything.

When song Rui appeared in front of Xia ruofei and the others with Zhuo Yiyi, Xia ruofei also introduced Zhuo Yiyi to Lu Yifan. He also told Lu Yifan that in the future, Zhuo Yiyi would be in charge of anything related to ancient architecture, ancient decorations, and cultural relics.

Everyone naturally exchanged pleasantries again.

After the staff completed the survey work, the group quickly got into the car and left the place. It was still a wasteland with no entertainment. No one would stay here for long if there was nothing to do.

However, they didn’t go straight back to the city. Instead, they went to the nearby hot spring resort to soak in the hot spring for a while, then had lunch at the resort before returning to the capital.

On the way back, Zhao Yongjun pulled Xia ruofei and Wu Qiang into the coaster. The Land Rover that Xia ruofei drove was naturally lent to song Rui so that he could send Zhuo Yiyi home.

The brothers were trying their best to create opportunities for song Rui, but song Rui himself was too weak.

After sending Lu Yifan and the others back to the architectural design office, the Toyota Coaster drove toward liuhai Lane.

The group of people arrived at Xia ruofei’s courtyard house. Xu Zixuan arranged for a familiar private restaurant to send over a table of food and wine. Xia ruofei once again felt that there were too few staff in the courtyard house. He couldn’t help but urge Wu Qiang to quickly confirm the recruitment.

Zhao Yongjun sent Liu Jian and the rest to the entertainment room in the basement. He and Xia ruofei were making tea under the grape trellis in the yard.

Zhao Yongjun took a sip of the tea that Xia ruofei had made and couldn’t help but exclaim,””Your tea leaves are still the best!”

“Brother Zhao, that’s a little guilty!” Xia ruofei laughed.”I gave you a lot of tea leaves! It’s the same as the one I’m drinking!”

“That means your tea – making skills are good!” Zhao Yongjun laughed and rounded up his words,”ruofei, I really envy you! Every day, I have good tea, good wine, good cigarettes to drink, and live in such a big courtyard ... Compared to you, I really have a hard life!”

“A man’s heart is not content,” Xia ruofei said lazily.”A snake that tries to swallow an elephant when it’s not satisfied ... When you can be as indifferent to fame and fortune as me, you can also get rid of the fate of hard work!”

“Go! “You’re a big star now, and you’re still indifferent to fame and fortune ...” Zhao Yongjun said,”you’re just standing there and talking!”

Xia ruofei laughed and asked seriously,””By the way, brother Zhao, how are you going to deal with the rumors?”

“You don’t say,” Zhao Yongjun said,”that kid Hou Liang came up with a pretty good idea ...”
