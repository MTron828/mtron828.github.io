Wu Liqian’s face didn’t show any expression. She just opened her laptop silently, but there was a faint trace of excitement in her heart.

She also glanced at Liu haojun, who was sitting diagonally opposite her. She realized that Liu haojun didn’t seem to have noticed anything. He had his usual frivolous smile and even glanced at her.

Zeng jianzhang, who was sitting in the middle, laughed and said,””Today, I’ve organized this meeting for only one topic, and that is to discuss the investment problem of Changping County. County Head Zhu, please explain the situation to our comrades!”

Zhu zhihang glanced at Wu Liqian, then nodded. He opened his notebook and said,””Comrades, first of all, I would like to share a piece of good news with everyone. That is, the Paradise Corporation intends to expand the production scale and build a pharmaceutical factory branch. This project is very likely to be located in our Changping County!”

As soon as Zhu zhihang said this, the Standing Committee members were surprised. He looked around and then said,””As a celebrity company, I don’t think I need to introduce too much to paradise Corporation, especially paradise pharmaceutical factory. In the past few months, whether it’s the Jade skin cream or the heart – nourishing soup, they’ve both created a sales legend. Every time the Jade skin cream is sold in a centralized manner, the sales easily break 100 million. As for the heart – nourishing soup, there’s no need to talk about its social effect. Even the central media specifically wrote articles to praise it. Now, paradise pharmaceutical factory is going to build a branch factory, and it’s very likely to be located in Changping. I don’t think I need to go into the meaning behind this. Fellow Standing Committee members should be very clear about this!”

The Standing Committee members all nodded, and a Colonel in military uniform said directly,””This is great news! County Head Zhu, we have to think of every possible way. We can’t let this project go!”

The Colonel was the head of the armed forces and the only member of the military uniform Standing Committee. He had no conflicts of interest with the members of the Standing Committee. He was usually only responsible for the matters of the armed forces and only appeared when he was in the Standing Committee. Therefore, he didn’t need to weigh too much when he spoke, so he was the first to express his position. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Zhu zhihang nodded and said,”director Shen is right. If a branch of the Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory can be located in Changping, the economic and social benefits will be obvious. In order to ensure the introduction of this project, I have drawn up a preliminary plan for preferential policies. I will discuss it with the Standing Committee members here.”

After that, Zhu zhihang took out the draft that he had prepared and introduced some of the preferential policies that he and Zeng jianzhang had decided on together.

He then said,”I need to make two points clear here. First, compared to other investment – attracting projects, the preferential margin we give this time is the largest within the scope of the county’s authority. This is mainly based on the project itself. It’s pure green, pollution – Free, high revenue, and good social effects. Such high – Quality projects can be said to be serendipitous. Giving a larger preferential margin is also due to this consideration.”Second, the preferential policies that I mentioned just now are only the largest concessions that our County can give. As for the actual operation, it will still depend on the situation of the negotiation. We don’t need to reveal all our assets to paradise Corporation at once ...”

Zeng jianzhang nodded with a smile and said,””Everyone is clear about the situation, so let’s express our opinions! If you have any questions, you can ask them at the same time. In short, just say whatever you want!”

Minister Shen from the armed forces Department, who was the first to express his opinion, immediately said,”I agree. This project is too significant. Giving such a discount is reasonable!”

Wu Liqian glanced at the expressionless Liu haojun and immediately said,””I agree with this plan!”

Now, Wu Liqian just hoped that this plan would be passed as soon as possible without any changes.

Soon, the Standing Committee expressed their opinions. Those who had nothing to do with it simply expressed their opinions, while the leaders who were related to the project said a few more words. However, they basically emphasized the importance of this project. In the end, they all agreed.

Wu Liqian’s mental state gradually relaxed from the initial tension.

In fact, from a purely work perspective, the possibility of this proposal not passing was extremely low. Not to mention, the county Head and Secretary had already reached a consensus before this. Although Zeng jianzhang didn’t state his stance in advance, everyone actually knew it in their hearts.

Liu haojun remained silent until all the members of the Standing Committee had finished speaking. Zeng jianzhang looked at Liu haojun and asked with a smile,””Secretary Liu, what’s your opinion?”

Liu haojun seemed to have just come back to his senses. He threw the pen in his hand away and raised his eyebrows.”I don’t have any objections! To introduce a project with an investment of more than a billion Yuan and a future annual revenue of billions, and it’s pure green and pollution – Free, how can I not agree to such a good thing? We must support him!”

Wu Liqian was completely relieved. She didn’t know if Liu haojun expressed his support because he knew it was the general trend and that there was no point in opposing it, or if it was because Liu haojun didn’t know that she was the one promoting the project. But in any case, from the moment Liu haojun expressed his position, the Standing Committee had already formed a decision. The preferential conditions that Zhu zhihang mentioned before would be implemented one by one.
