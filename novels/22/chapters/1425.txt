Chapter 1426: Not a single one less (2)

Translator: 549690339

Two percent of 100 million was exactly two million. This figure was one to two hundred thousand more than the dividends that pang Hao, Xiao Qiang, and the other company executives could get, which was exactly in line with President Feng Jing’s status.

It could be said that Xia ruofei had put in great effort.

Xia ruofei smiled.”Mr. Feng, I really need the money. Of course, we’re both shareholders, so we’ll have to split the profits accordingly. I’ll take 98 million and you’ll take 2 million. It’s fair!”

Xia ruofei’s motive was obvious, but he would never admit it.

He had his own considerations. Feng Jing had worked hard for a year. If there was no bonus at the end of the year, Xiao Qiang and the others would have received one or two million Yuan in year – end bonus happily. As the president, Feng Jing would be empty – handed. Even if Feng Jing did not have any thoughts about it, Xia ruofei would not be able to get over it!

Of course, this year was a special case.

This year, there were fewer senior executives who participated in the dividends, and the personnel grading system had not yet been implemented, so relatively speaking, everyone received more money. By this time next year, there would be no difference between ordinary employees and senior executives. When they reached a certain level, they would be able to get dividends according to the corresponding ratio. By then, the Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer would be in place, and the money that senior executives could get would be diluted.

Of course, if the company’s profits increased several times next year, everyone would definitely be able to get more money, but that was another matter. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Chairman, isn’t this a little too much?” Feng Jing said, not knowing whether to laugh or cry.

“How can this be a game? The Company Law has stipulated the way for shareholders to pay dividends!” Xia ruofei pretended to be confused and said,”I’m the major shareholder. As long as it doesn’t affect the company’s normal development, I have the right to ask for dividends. Even if it’s a vote, I have 98% of the voting rights. That’s an overwhelming advantage!”

“Chairman ... Aren’t you being a scoundrel?” Feng Jing stomped her foot. I really don’t need that much money! Besides, wouldn’t he be able to earn more money if he kept the money for the company’s development? You said it yourself, I’m also a shareholder of the company! How can you be so short – sighted?”

Xia ruofei didn’t give him any room to explain.”This is a special case. We’ll talk about the future later!”

“You ...”

Pang Hao, who was standing at the side, could not even get a word in. When he saw that Feng Jing was rendered speechless by Xia ruofei’s words, he said,””President Xia, President Feng, can I say a few words?”

“Don’t tell me that 80 million isn’t enough!” Xia ruofei shot a threatening look at pang Hao.

“Chairman, you can’t use your power to oppress others!” Feng Jing said,”you have to respect the opinions of the professionals. The company has to be standardized. First of all, you can’t mess around as the chairman!”

At this point, Feng Rao turned to pang Hao and said in a friendly manner,””President pang, don’t worry and speak your mind. As long as it’s an objective opinion, the chairman won’t dare to do anything to you!”

The way Feng Jing addressed him as ‘President pang’ made pang Hao burst with joy. It was the same as reminding him that he was now one of the company’s leaders.

“Director Feng,” pang Hao said with a grin.”Actually, I wanted to say ... 80 million in liquid capital is more or less enough!”

“Ah?” Feng Rao hadn’t expected this to be pang Hao’s opinion.

All her efforts had been in vain ...

“It’s really enough!”Pang Hao quickly explained. Of course, the premise was that the company didn’t have any major spending plans in the near future! In fact, our company’s cash flow has always been very abundant, and our partners can return the money very quickly, so there’s no need to keep too much money. I’ve calculated that 60 to 80 million is enough!”

“President pang, don’t give up on your principles just to please the chairman!” Feng Rao asked doubtfully. The problem with the capital chain is very serious!”

In fact, it was not that serious. The boss of the company, Xia ruofei, was a nouveau riche himself. He could easily transfer hundreds of millions of funds.

If the company’s capital chain was in danger, it would be easy for Xia ruofei to inject capital into it.

However, Feng Jing did not want Xia ruofei to spend so much money on her. That was why she had hoped that pang Hao could help to persuade Xia ruofei. She had not expected this to happen.

“Director Feng, you shouldn’t doubt my professional integrity ...” Pang Hao said with a smile.

“President pang, that’s not what I meant ...” Feng Jing quickly explained.”I’m just thinking that the next step is for the subsidiary company’s finance department to be independent. That way, only the e – commerce Department will be left at the headquarters to generate cash flow ...”

“Just because the company’s finance department is independent doesn’t mean that it’s completely divided!” Pang Hao said with a smile. “By then, the profits generated by the two branch companies will have to be handed over to the head office with sufficient development funds left. Furthermore, it will be settled on a monthly basis, so there shouldn’t be much difference in the capital chain ...”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.”President Feng, did you hear that? We have to trust the professional’s opinion!”

Feng Rao didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. Her previous words had dug a hole for herself.

“Alright, it’s decided then!” Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”fatty, oh no... I should call you President pang now!”

“Aren’t you making fun of me, ruofei?”pang Hao said with a bitter smile. I don’t dare to call myself ‘boss’ in front of you!”

“You’re already the company’s leader! You have to establish your prestige!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”President pang, as the major shareholder, I would like to ask for a bonus of 100 million Yuan. Please settle the relevant documents and procedures when you go back. I hope that President Feng and I will have our bonus in our private account before the Spring Festival!”

“No problem!” Pang Hao immediately nodded in agreement.

Seeing that Xia ruofei had already made his decision, Feng Jing did not try to persuade him anymore.

Although she kept rejecting him, Feng Rao felt warm inside because Xia ruofei was very considerate of her feelings. It felt good to be noticed and cared for, especially when the person who cared about her was the person she liked.

The three of them arrived at the parking lot as they talked.

When Xia ruofei reached out to open the car door, he suddenly smacked his head and said,””Aiya! I forgot to call her Qiao’ er ...”

Feng Rao couldn’t help but laugh,”you just remembered! It seems like your sister doesn’t hold a high position in your heart ...”

Xia ruofei couldn’t be bothered to argue with Feng Ye. He hurriedly took out his phone and was about to call Lin Qiao.

“Chairman, stop calling!” Feng Rao said with a smile. Lin Qiao had already been dragged away by Luo Xing and other colleagues from the e – commerce Department to sing! They wanted to celebrate the e – commerce group’s official upgrade to a Department directly under the head office! Lin Qiao is also a senior member of the e – commerce Group, so she definitely has to participate!”

“This girl, why didn’t you tell me?” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but say.

“Luo Xing told me about this. Lin Qiao should have sent you a WeChat message, right?” Feng Jing laughed.”Could it be that you’ve muted your phone?”

Xia ruofei looked at his phone and smiled in embarrassment.””It really is ...”

Lin Qiao told him on WeChat that she was going to go to karaoke with her colleagues after the annual meeting and asked him not to wait for her.

Xia ruofei had been on the stage the whole time during the last stage of the annual meeting. After the event, Lin Qiao was dragged to the KTV that they had booked, so she sent a WeChat message to Xia ruofei in a hurry.

Xia ruofei replied to Lin Qiao’s message on WeChat, reminding her to be careful and to go home early.

Besides, Xia ruofei also sent a WeChat message to Luo Xing, asking him to ensure Lin Qiao’s safety and to send her home safely after the gathering.

After sending the WeChat message, Xia ruofei opened the car door and said with a smile,””Get in the car! Let’s go home!”

Xia ruofei, Feng Jing, and pang Hao drove back to Taoyuan farm. What they did not know was that what had happened at the annual meeting had already spread rapidly on the internet.

In this day and age, everyone had a smartphone, so employees would naturally take photos and record videos at the annual meeting. Some people shared them on their WeChat moments, and those who won prizes would inevitably show off on Weibo and forums.

As a result, the content of the annual peach blossom company party quietly spread ...
