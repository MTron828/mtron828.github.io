Chapter 255: Cooperation between the husband and the wife (1)

Ling Xiaotian couldn’t help but sniff. Even Ling Qingxue, who rarely drank, could not help but ask in surprise,””Ruofei, what kind of wine is this? Why does it smell so good?” Ling Xiaotian took a deep breath and said,””This wine is very special. It’s not as rich as the Moutai wine or the Wuliangye wine, but it’s unique. It gives people a feeling of relaxation and floating like an immortal ...” As he spoke, he poured a glass into the small glass, then picked up the glass with his thumb and middle finger, brought it to his mouth steadily, and drank it in one gulp. Ling Xiaotian closed his eyes, his face revealing a reminiscing expression. After a long time, he opened his eyes and let out a long breath, praising,””Good wine!” Ling Qingxue giggled and asked,”dad!” Can you tell what wine it is?” Ling Xiaotian thought for a moment and said with uncertainty,””It’s a bit like the famous Drunken Eight Immortals of three mountains, but it doesn’t have the smell of smoke and fire like the Drunken Eight Immortals. The taste is rich and smooth, not burning the throat at all, and it also has a lingering fragrance. This wine ... Should not be sold in the market, at least I’ve never drunk it before!” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but admire him. His future father – in – Law was indeed an expert in wine country! He could actually tell the truth after drinking a cup. Ling Qingxue also looked at Xia ruofei. “Uncle Ling, to be able to taste the flavor of the Drunken Eight Immortals, it shows that you are indeed an expert!” Xia ruofei smiled. “Oh? Does that mean ... This wine is really the Drunken Eight Immortals?” Ling Xiaotian said in shock,”that’s impossible! I’ve been drinking drunken eight immortal’s wine for more than twenty years. I’ve even drunk the wine in bulk, but it’s never tasted this good!” Ling Xiaotian, like many other natives of the three mountains, loved Drunken Eight Immortals more than high – end wines like Wuliangye and Maotai. In Ling Xiaotian’s words, this was the taste of feelings, memories, and youth. Hence, he was very familiar with the taste of Drunken Eight Immortals. When Xia ruofei said that it was Drunken Eight Immortals, he was shocked. “Uncle Ling, this wine is an improved version of the Drunken Eight Immortals.” Xia ruofei said with a smile. “Could it be that medicinal ingredients were added?” Ling Xiaotian asked in surprise. “Almost! However, it won’t have the pungent smell of the medicinal wine. ” Xia ruofei said. Seeing that Xia ruofei did not elaborate, Ling Xiaotian tactfully did not press further. Instead, he smiled and said,””RUO Fei, I didn’t expect you to have this ability! This drunken eight immortal was simply reborn after being improved! Those expensive bottles of wine can’t even compare to your wine!” “Uncle Ling, you’re too kind ...” Xia ruofei said, smiling. Ling Xiaotian thought for a moment and asked again,”ruofei, is it difficult to mass produce this wine?” If we can mass produce it, the market prospects should be very good!” Xia ruofei thought for a moment and said,”the wine I brought today is the special edition. It’s a little difficult to mass produce, but we have another one. It might not taste as good as this, but it’s still much better than the original Drunken Eight Immortals. It’s relatively easy to mass produce this wine.” The wine that Xia ruofei had brought to Ling Xiaotian was one that had been infused with the petals of an exotic flower. Furthermore, two hundred catties of wine had used up one of his petals. Naturally, he could not use such precious petals to brew wine. No matter how big the profit was, it would not be worth it! As for the other type of wine that Xia ruofei mentioned, it had zero cost. It only needed to be stored in the realm for a while and ‘mass production’ would not be difficult at all. Ling Xiaotian’s eyes lit up when he heard this. He muttered to himself for a moment before saying,””Ruofei, why don’t we work together to set up a winery? The Dingfeng winery that produces the Eight Immortals drunk has been having a hard time operating for the past few years. Recently, I heard that the boss is planning to sell the winery ...” Ling Xiaotian himself was in the food circle, so he was naturally more well – informed in this aspect. When he first heard the news, he felt that it was a pity. After all, Drunken Eight Immortals was a wine that he had loved since he was young, and he still loved it to this day. After selling off the decades – old brand, it was hard to say if the brand would be able to survive. Now, Ling Xiaotian saw a new business opportunity. If Xia ruofei had a way to make Drunken Eight Immortals wine turn over a new leaf, they could join hands and buy the winery. This old and established brand would definitely have a second spring. And the profit margin would be huge. Ling Xiaotian continued.”Ruofei, as long as you agree, I’ll pay for the acquisition. You’ll be the technology shareholder. How about we each take half the shares?” Xia ruofei didn’t expect to get a cooperation project out of drinking. He thought for a while and asked,””Uncle Ling, it’s not cheap to buy a winery, is it?” Ling Xiaotian didn’t seem to mind,””The Dingfeng winery is not a big one, and many of its equipment are relatively old. I think we can get it with about ten million!” “So expensive?” Xia ruofei quickly asked. Uncle Ling, I can’t just take half of the shares for free!” Ling Xiaotian laughed and said,”ruofei, you must know that your skills are the key to the winery’s revival. Besides, if you have money, you can do it on your own. So, five million is not expensive at all!” Besides, we’re on the same side, is there a need to be so calculative?” “Uncle Ling, it’s still too early to talk about the share distribution. Let’s not talk about this for now.” Xia ruofei smiled bitterly. I’ll bring some of that wine over for you to try tomorrow, and you can decide after you’ve tasted it! You haven’t even seen the wine yet! It’s a little too hasty to buy the winery ...” Ling Xiaotian laughed and said,”how can I not trust you?” But since you’ve said so, I’ll wait for you to bring the wine over. It’s good to try it!” “Alright! We’ll make a decision after you drink that wine!” Xia ruofei said with a smile. “I have confidence in you! You’re a young man who’s good at creating miracles. ” Ling Xiaotian chuckled and said,”ruofei, remember this! Bring the wine over as soon as possible. Once it’s decided to purchase, there’s still a lot of work to be done! Don’t let anyone else get there first. ” “Alright!” Xia ruofei replied. At that moment, Ling Qingxue said coyly,””Dad! Why did they suddenly talk about business? Don’t you think your life is boring? talking about work during a meal at home?” Ling Xiaotian was stunned for a moment before he burst out laughing,””Occupational disease, occupational disease, hahaha ... Come, let’s not talk about work. Let’s drink!” After he finished speaking, Ling Xiaotian personally poured Xia ruofei a glass of wine and poured himself a glass. “Qingxue, why don’t you have a taste?” Ling Xiaotian said with a smile. “Alright!” Ling Qingxue pouted and said,”I’ll try it too and see if it’s as magical as you say ...” After Ling Qingxue poured the wine, Ling Xiaotian raised his glass and said,””Come! Let’s have a drink together! RUO Fei, from now on, I’m handing my daughter over to you. You must treat Qingxue well and not bully her, understand?” “Uncle Ling, I’ll remember this!” Xia ruofei said seriously. Ling Qingxue glanced at Xia ruofei affectionately. The three of them clinked their glasses and drank together. Xia ruofei and Ling Xiaotian both finished their drinks in one go, while Ling Qingxue took a small sip. “Great! Good wine ... It’s really good wine!” Ling Xiaotian smacked his lips, revealing an expression of reminiscence. Ling Qingxue was also surprised,”this wine tastes really good!” It’s not choking at all, and it even has a sweet fragrance ...” White wine was spicy and pungent. Generally speaking, girls didn’t like to drink it. Even when Ling Qingxue was socializing, she would at most drink red wine. However, after drinking the spatial wine that Xia ruofei had brought today, she actually liked the taste very much. “Even my precious daughter can’t stop praising it. This wine is really good!” Ling Xiaotian laughed. The three of them chatted as they ate, and the atmosphere was very harmonious. Xia ruofei and Ling Xiaotian also clinked their glasses. The two former soldiers drank very quickly and downed their glasses. Ling Qingxue had also drunk two small cups. Her pretty face was slightly red, and there was a hint of red in her white skin, making her even more beautiful. After the meal, they had drunk two out of three bottles of wine. Most of them were drunk by Xia ruofei and Ling Xiaotian. Each of them had drunk about half a kilogram. Ling Xiaotian’s alcohol tolerance was very good. After drinking so much, he didn’t feel drunk at all. After the three of them finished their meal, Ling Xiaotian stood up and said,””Ruofei, Qingxue, I’m going back to the company! Qingxue, don’t go to work in the afternoon. Stay at home and rest with RUO Fei!” With that, Ling Xiaotian grabbed his bag and left. His chauffeur was already waiting at the villa’s entrance. It seemed like Ling Xiaotian had already made arrangements. From the start, he had planned to give his daughter and future son – in – Law some alone time after lunch. After Ling Xiaotian left, Xia ruofei looked at Ling Qingxue and chuckled.””Hehe! Wife, father – in – Law asked you to accompany me to rest for a while. Why don’t we go back to our room now? Time is precious ...” ~
