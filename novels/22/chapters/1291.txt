Chapter 1292: Chapter 779 – not playing by the rules -2

Translator: 549690339

Xu Jiahui’s offer was indeed much higher, but this was their usual tactic. If they negotiated with such a high price, even if the price was lowered a little, it would definitely exceed their expectations when the final deal was made.

Xia ruofei stopped in his tracks. The corner of his mouth twitched as he said indifferently,””Of course, it’s normal to have differences, but it should be within a reasonable range. Boss Xu’s offer is too different from what we’re expecting. I personally think there’s no need to continue the discussion. ”

Xu Jiahui smiled bitterly and said,”Mr. Xia, shouldn’t you at least tell us your offer?” To be honest, the reason why we bid this price is not to ask for an exorbitant price. This is a valuation carried out by a professional organization. The area where the balance power building is located is the core area of the city center. Even if we don’t take into account the help these industries provide to your company’s integration resources, their actual value is still there. Moreover, the planned subway No. 5 ...”

Xia ruofei laughed.”Boss Xu, line 5 is still not a thing. Even if it’s really planned, from the approval, bidding, exploration, and construction, it’ll take at least five years, right? What if there were any changes? You’ve taken into account all the favorable factors that may appear in five years. This is really a little unbelievable ...”

“Okay, okay, okay, let’s not talk about the subway.” Xu Jiahui smiled bitterly and said,”Mr. Xia, can we sit down and talk calmly?”

Peace was the most important thing in business. Xu Jiahui had rarely met someone like Xia ruofei who stood up and left without saying a word.

“As I said, if boss Xu insists on the 500 million offer, there’s really no need to continue the discussion.” Xia ruofei replied indifferently,”because that would only waste both parties ‘time. I think everyone’s time is precious.”

Xu Jiahui sighed and said,””Alright! I can see that President Xia is a forthright person, so I don’t have to hide it. Our Board of Directors has decided on a price of 450 million Yuan. ”

Xu Jiahui’s face was sincere as if he was saying,”You see, I really didn’t even hide the base price from you. I’m sincere enough, right?

“It’s still outrageously high!”Xia ruofei shook his head.

Of course, he wasn’t in a hurry to leave. Instead, he stood at the door of the conference room and said with a confused look,””Boss Xu, if this is the collective decision of your Board of Directors, there are only two possibilities. One is that you’re treating me, Xia ruofei, as a fool who knows nothing. The other possibility is that the members of your company’s Board of Directors are collectively hallucinating ...”

As soon as Xia ruofei said this, Xu Jiahui felt embarrassed. A young man beside him couldn’t help but frown and say,””President Xia, don’t say such ugly words! Weren’t business negotiations all about asking for a sky – High price and paying on the spot? If your company is really not interested, why did you come today? Since we’re here, why don’t we just discuss the conditions of both sides? why do you need to say such strange words?”

Xia ruofei looked at the young man indifferently and said,””Did I say something wrong? We’re being so enthusiastic about helping bojun real estate solve their problems. Even if we don’t offer help in the middle of a snowstorm, we’re at least being warm – hearted, right? In the end, I didn’t see any sincerity in your offer. It was even full of malice. If it wasn’t for the Board of Directors ‘collective brain damage, they would really think that I, Xia ruofei, was a hothead!”

Xia ruofei looked at Xu Jiahui deeply after he finished speaking.

Xu Jiahui’s heart skipped a beat, and his expression changed. He looked at Xia ruofei in surprise and said,””President Xia, you must be joking ... This project sale is a win – win situation. I don’t think it’s a solution, right?”

“Yes or no, boss Xu should be very clear about that,” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Xia ruofei didn’t waste any more time and said directly,””Boss Xu, I won’t beat around the bush. We have no problem buying your company’s 9th floor, but our offer is 320 million!”

As soon as Xia ruofei said this, not only did Xu Jiahui and his team members ‘expressions change drastically, but even Feng Jing and Liu Qian felt that it was unbelievable.

The value of bojun real estate’s assets should be relatively clear, because not long ago, Tao Yuan company had just bought the assets on the 10th floor and 15th floor of Hengli building from the provincial state assets administration for a total of 270 million Yuan. If this price was used as a reference, bojun real estate’s assets were about 400 million Yuan.

Xia ruofei’s bid of 320 million was really too low.

Unlike the negotiation team, Xu Jiahui’s first emotion was not anger, but shock. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

The starting price was 320 million. Of course, Xia ruofei did not expect the deal to go according to this price.

As a veteran in the business world, Xu Jiahui could almost predict that Xia ruofei’s psychological price might be 350 million.

This price was practically the bottom line of bojun real estate.

Of course, this did not mean that bojun real estate was willing to accept such a price. Their ideal price was above 400 million, and at the very least, it could not be lower than 380 million.

Of course, if there was really no other way, the minimum must be 350 million, and the cash must be received as soon as possible.

Otherwise, it would be meaningless if the money from selling the building was not enough to get through this capital chain crisis.

Originally, Xu Jiahui thought that Xia ruofei and Feng Jing were young, so he was very confident in this negotiation. This could be seen from the 500 million he offered. This was a very good strategy to deal with newbies.

However, Xia ruofei’s shrewdness was beyond Xu Jiahui’s expectation.

Xia ruofei did not play his cards according to common sense. He even stood up and left the table before the negotiation even started. Then, he did not care about how exaggerated Xu Jiahui’s words were. He immediately threw out the extremely low price of 320 million as if everything was under his control.

In addition to Xia ruofei’s profound words, Xu Jiahui had a vague feeling that today’s negotiations would be very difficult. The opponent might have some hidden cards.

He quickly stabilized his emotions and squeezed out a smile.””President Xia, isn’t this price a little too outrageous? Your company spent 270 million to acquire the power construction group’s assets, and our assets are three levels more than the power construction Group!”

Xia ruofei shrugged.”That’s why ... I’ve said it from the beginning. Actually, there’s no need for us to continue this discussion. It’s because the differences between us are too great.”

“This ...” Xu Jiahui was at a loss for words.

When negotiating with Xia ruofei, he had a feeling that he had no place to use his strength. It was as if he had punched the air. It was an unspeakable discomfort.

However, Xu Jiahui was also well – versed in negotiation skills. He knew that he could not show too much urgency at this time. Otherwise, the other party might insist on this price and even fail to negotiate with 350 million in the end.

After thinking for a while, Xu Jiahui said helplessly,””President Xia, let’s end the negotiation here! But we are very sincere, I will report to the Board of Directors as soon as I come down. Please consider the price carefully, I hope that we can reach a consensus in the next negotiation!”

Xia ruofei nodded.”Okay, boss Xu. We’ll be leaving now. I also hope that your company’s next offer will not be as outrageous as today ‘s.”

Xu Jiahui could not help but smile bitterly. He could only nod helplessly.

This negotiation was really frustrating. It was also a weird one. From the moment Xia ruofei came in to the moment he stood up and left, it took less than three minutes. For the second half of the confrontation, Xia ruofei and the other two stood directly at the door of the conference room. This was extremely rare in a negotiation.

After they walked out of bojun building, Feng Jing asked,””Chairman, isn’t your offer too low? Bojun won’t accept it. ”

Feng Jing had been holding it in for a long time, but she couldn’t question the Chairman’s decision in the bojun building, so she couldn’t wait to ask.

Xia ruofei turned around to look at the bojun building and said with a smile,””Of course they won’t accept 320 million, but it should be enough with an additional 20 to 30 million.”

” 350 million?” Feng Jing couldn’t believe it. “That’s impossible, right? Bojun’s in the real estate business, so he’s very clear on how much this half of the building is worth. ”

“Boss Feng, do you want to make a bet with me?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.
