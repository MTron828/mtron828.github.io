Chapter 782: Chapter 517 – Capture them all in one fell swoop (2)

In order to prevent the Japanese from hurting professor Liang Qiming, Guo Zhan also constantly used sign language to command the troops to speed up their operation.

Xia ruofei took the lead and rushed to the front.

After killing the Japanese machine gunner, he didn’t stop at all. He jumped out from behind the tree. When the Japanese’s gunshots stopped for a moment, he stomped his feet and pounced toward the entrance of the brick kiln.

Xia ruofei’s speed was extremely fast. His body almost left an afterimage. It seemed that he had exceeded the limits of a human’s explosive power.

The Wei nation agent in charge of guarding this direction was in a bad position to avoid the sniper. Xia ruofei was already on the steps of the brick kiln entrance before he reacted and quickly turned his gun.

However, the submachine gun in Xia ruofei’s hand had already started to glow.

Tap tap tap tap ...

The Japanese man was hit by several bullets and fell to the ground without a sound.

Just as Xia ruofei shot the Wei nation agent, a Japanese man not far away also reacted quickly. He quickly turned around and pointed his gun at Xia ruofei.

However, Xia ruofei did not stop at all. He used one hand to control the submachine gun. His left hand quickly pulled out the type 92 9mm pistol from the holster. He aimed at the Japanese and fired a few shots. The two guns fired almost at the same time. His movements were smooth and he killed the Japanese without any suspense.

At this moment, Xia ruofei rolled on the ground to reduce the impact of the sudden attack and quickly jumped into a temporary shelter.

The small team led by Guo Zhan also rushed into the brick kiln.

When Guo Zhan was commanding the battle, he had been counting the number of people on the other side. After Xia ruofei had killed the two Japanese, there should be one person left.

......

Therefore, after he led the small team into the brick kiln, he immediately ordered everyone to form a search formation and slowly approach the depths of the brick kiln.

As for the six team members on the side, other than two snipers who stayed on guard, the remaining four also began to carefully search around the brick kiln to prevent any fish from escaping.

This time, the lone wolf assault team had sent out experienced veterans to deal with this completely one – sided situation.

Inside the brick kiln.

Xia ruofei and the rest advanced carefully with their guns in hand.

Xia ruofei could still remember professor Liang Qiming’s position clearly. If the enemy had not moved his position, he should be in the twelveo’ clock direction, about ten meters away.

However, there were a lot of obstacles in the brick kiln, and no one knew where the only Wei nation agent was hiding, so everyone was not completely relaxed.

Step by step, the brick kiln was so quiet that only the sound of breathing and light footsteps could be heard.

Suddenly, a figure stood up, and everyone subconsciously raised their guns.

However, Xia ruofei immediately raised his right hand to signal everyone to lower their guns. He had already seen clearly in the dim environment that the person who stood up was professor Liang Qiming. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

A thick arm was wrapped around professor Liang’s neck, and a gun was pointed at his temple.

The thing he was most worried about had still happened.

Professor Liang had been taken hostage by the last Japanese. The Japanese was very cunning. He was almost completely hiding behind professor Liang, and behind him was a solid wall. Not far away from him was a ventilation hole that could not be passed through at all. It was also blocked by professor Liang. Even if there was a sniper outside, they could not aim at him.

The atmosphere in the brick – kiln immediately became tense.

The Japanese agent who was hiding behind Liang Qiming shouted,””All of you, put down your weapons and leave the brick kiln!”

This Japanese kid’s Chinese was very fluent. If it was someone else, they wouldn’t be able to tell that he was a Wei nation Special Agent who was sent to China to carry out a mission. Most of them could speak fluent Chinese, otherwise, they would be exposed.

Guo Zhan shouted with a sullen face,”quickly let professor Liang go!” We won’t shoot you. We’ll give you a chance to accept the trial of Chinese law!”

The Japanese man laughed strangely and said,”you’re just coaxing a child!” Come back and tell me this when China has completely abolished the death penalty!”

After that, the Japanese man tightened his grip on Liang Qiming.

Professor Liang was already in his 70s and had been tortured for the past two days. His body and spirit were both very weak. Now, his face was pale and his mouth was wide open as if he would suffocate at any time.

Guo Zhan quickly shouted,”let go of professor Liang first!” If Madam Liang has any problems, you won’t be able to escape, right?”

“We didn’t plan to go back alive when we came to Huaxia. It’s the honor of every warrior of the Empire to die for the great Qian Empire!” The Japanese said arrogantly. It’s just a pity that I haven’t had the time to complete my mission ...”

Then, the Japanese man changed the topic and laughed strangely,”I know you guys didn’t get professor Liang’s experimental data. If I shoot now, won’t the location of the experimental data become a secret forever?”

Guo Zhan’s face slightly changed as he shouted,”Stop!”

The Wei nation agent sneered and said,””Immediately put down your weapons and leave the brick kiln! Don’t force me into a life and death struggle! At that time, if my Empire can’t get the experimental data, you Chinese can forget about getting it! I, Inoue Junyan, can be considered to have completed half of my mission, and have not disgraced my noble Inoue family! Hahaha ...”
