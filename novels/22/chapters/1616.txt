Chapter 1617: Unified thinking (1)

Zhao Yongjun was driving quietly and didn’t say anything immediately.

Song Rui’s objection and avoidance were within his expectations. Song Rui had never been on good terms with Liu haofan since they were young. It could be said that the two of them had been fighting since they were young. Although song Rui followed his father to Xiang Nan Province later on, the enmity between the two of them would not be offset because of that. Now that song Rui had returned to the capital, if he kept his distance when he saw Liu haofan, he would lose all his face.

Wasn’t face the most important thing for rich people like them?

However, Zhao Yongjun didn’t expect Xia ruofei to object to the re – Selection of the site. In Zhao Yongjun’s impression, Xia ruofei was still a steady person. Was the plot of land really suitable, or was there some other reason?

Zhao Yongjun wouldn’t say anything before he was clear.

The reason why he had such a high reputation among the rich Playboys in the capital for so many years, other than being forthright and righteous, was also because he was meticulous in his work. Otherwise, with his father Zhao Cheng’s status, he would not have been able to win the respect of song Rui, even an arrogant person like Liu haofan would not dare to be too presumptuous in front of him.

Liu Jian and Xu Zixuan looked at each other with a bitter smile. They didn’t know how to refute Jian Jia after hearing song Rui’s words. In fact, they couldn’t go against song Rui’s thoughts too much. Otherwise, song Rui might really fall out with them.

Finally, Xia ruofei cleared his throat and said,””Brothers, let me ask first, what is the bidding model for this plot of land?”

Xu Zixuan immediately said,”this has basically been decided. The model of land bidding is already very mature. After the preliminary qualification review, we’ve already done all these. The base price of this bid is 250 million. According to the latest regulations, the bid security is set at 125 million. We’ve already transferred the money to the special account set up by the Pingchang district government a few days ago.”

Xu Zixuan paused and continued: “the final bidding is set for the day after tomorrow. Only the shortlisted companies can participate. Of course, we naturally have no problem ...”

When he said this, Xu Zi Xuan couldn’t help but reveal a proud expression.

Song Rui rolled his eyes and said,””Little Xuan, let’s see what you can do! We didn’t even notice that Liu er was colluding with Tang real estate. If Liu er didn’t come to see us today, would we have to wait until the day after tomorrow to find out about the bidding?”

Xu Zi Xuan was a little embarrassed. He had been the one handling these specific matters, and it was really his dereliction of duty.

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Song Rui, let’s not talk about this. Zixuan, continue.”

Xu Zi Xuan looked at Xia ruofei gratefully and continued,”The final bidding is to raise the bidding sign on the spot. According to the bidding documents we have, each raise of the bidding sign is no less than a million. In the end, unless there are special circumstances, the highest bidder basically wins.”

“Basically, there won’t be any special circumstances,” Liu Jian added. “As far as I know, the land auctions in Beijing don’t have a circuit breaker mechanism.” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The so – called circuit breaker mechanism meant that the government would set a maximum price. If the bidding process was too intense and exceeded this price, the land transfer would be terminated, and all the bids would be void.

The original intention of this system was to encourage developers to take land rationally, hoping to have the effect of suppressing real estate prices. After all, the higher the land transfer fee, the more money the developers would make, and the cost would naturally be transferred to the buyers. The price of flour had increased, so naturally, bread had become more expensive.

However, this system had always been criticized by public opinion, because the essence of the rise in real estate prices was still the strong demand. This was related to the consumption views of the people. Developers were also willing to pay high prices because they predicted that the real estate prices would rise to their psychological expectations.

Hearing this, Xia ruofei nodded slightly. Without this circuit breaker, it was very likely that the final price would be much higher than the bidding base price.

He pondered for a moment and said,”brothers, this is what I think!” No matter how rich this Liu haofan or Tang real estate is, and no matter if we can get this land in the end, we can’t lose in terms of momentum!”

Xia ruofei’s words were what song Rui was thinking. He immediately said,””Well said! RUO Fei, I’ve known you for so long, and this is the only sentence you’ve said that truly touches my heart! It makes so much sense!”

Xia ruofei glanced at song Rui and said,””This is what I’m thinking ... Since we’ve already paid the bid deposit, we’ll go there the day after tomorrow. It’ll be best if we can get the land within our expectations, but if we can ‘t, we can’t let Liu haofan take the land away so easily. Let’s increase the price a few times. Even if we have to give up in the end, we have to make them pay!”

Song Rui laughed out loud and said,”I’m not convinced by the wall, but you!” Little Xuan, Jian! Listen to this, this is what a man should do! It’s so embarrassing to retreat when you hear Liu er’s name!”

Liu Jian and Xu Zixuan looked at each other and smiled bitterly. They thought to themselves,”who did we offend? we’re clearly the most rational, how did it become a disgrace?”

They couldn’t help but look at Zhao Yongjun.

Zhao Yongjun had been driving the whole time and didn’t say anything. He said calmly,””What RUO Fei said is not without reason! We’re all respected people, even if we lose, we have to lose in a grand way! “There’s just one thing. Once the price exceeds our expectations and we continue to raise the price for Liu haofan, we have to control it. Don’t end up with this piece of land in our hands ...”
