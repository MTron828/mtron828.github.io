1984 Monica’s news (1)

It turned out that in just two to three days, the popularity of the Paradise company had spread all the way to the European continent with the spread of the online media and the European buyers who had won the auction items they wanted.

Europeans might not have much interest in abalone and ginseng, but they would definitely go after the best truffles.

And now, paradise corporation’s truffles had become synonymous with top – grade truffles. Several Michelin – starred restaurants had unexpectedly become popular because they had won a bid for paradise truffles. Many people with financial ability had called to inquire, hoping to book truffles in advance. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Most of the things in the world were like this. Because many super – rich people had gathered in Hong Kong and the auction’s transaction price had reached an astonishing 100 million US dollars, the Paradise Corporation had become unparalleled in its glory. On the other hand, the Paradise Corporation became famous, and the restaurants that won the Taoyuan truffle also rose in price.

The European headquarters of the corner Western food chain also constantly raised the priority of the Taoyuan truffle.

Therefore, when the sales Director of corner Western restaurant chain heard that Bastian had obtained a certain amount of Taoyuan truffle through his personal connections, he was naturally very happy and agreed to his suggestion to increase the price without hesitation.

Bastian also let out a long sigh of relief. He said,””I understand! I’ll get it done immediately!”

Putting away the phone and walking into the living room, Bastian’s face was already full of a warm smile. He said,””Mr. Xia, our head office has already prepared the funds. I need to fax a contract back. Our finance staff will transfer the money to your account as soon as possible!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””There’s a fax machine in the study. You can use it as you wish!”

“Thank you very much!” Bastian personally walked to the study with the signed contract and sent the purchase agreement back to the company’s headquarters in Europe.

The company also quickly replied,”the finance staff will deal with it with the highest priority, and the funds will be transferred to the account very soon.”

Bastian returned to the living room and chatted with Xia ruofei while waiting.

About ten minutes later, Xia ruofei’s phone received a notification about a change in his account. He checked on his computer and saw that the 418600 euros from the Western restaurant chain had been transferred.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Mr. Bastian, the funds have been transferred!” We have a deal!”

“Thank you for your generosity!” Bastian quickly shook Xia ruofei’s hand and said,”I’ve booked a flight back to Europe at noon. Mr. Xia, we’ll take our leave first! After sending this batch of truffles back to the headquarters, I should be returning to San Shan to work soon. I hope that you can give me a chance to be the host. I have to thank you properly!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.”I’ll definitely visit you.”

“President Xia, thank you so much for this!” Cheng Xiaoxiao also said.

“You’re welcome!” Xia ruofei smiled.”Oh right, Xiaoxiao, are you going to Europe with Mr. Bastian?”

“No, Mr. Bastian gave me two days off, but I’m going back to the three mountains today. I’ll spend some time with my family during my break.” Cheng Xiaoxiao said.

Xia ruofei nodded.”I’m going back to the three mountains in the afternoon. I have an empty seat on my plane. If you haven’t booked a ticket, I don’t mind giving you a ride.”

“Really?” Cheng Xiaoxiao asked in surprise. President Xia, your plane ... You’ve already bought a private plane?”

“Something like that ... But I only have the right to use it.” Xia ruofei didn’t explain much. He smiled and asked,”how is it? Do you want to experience a public jet?”

“Of course!” Cheng Xiaoxiao said without hesitation,”President Xia, then I won’t be polite with you.”

In fact, Cheng Xiaoxiao had already booked a return ticket, but to be able to return with her idol on the legendary luxurious business jet, Cheng Xiaoxiao of course wouldn’t hesitate.

As for the tickets, they could just refund them. Although there would be a cost for changing the refund of discounted tickets, compared to taking a business plane with his idol, this loss was insignificant.

“What’s there to be polite about? the plane is very spacious anyway, so you can join us.” Xia ruofei said,”then it’s a deal. Pack your luggage at noon and I’ll call you when I check out!”

“Mm! MMH! Yes!” Cheng Xiaoxiao nodded repeatedly.

Xia ruofei personally sent the two of them to the door of the Presidential Suite. He watched them enter the elevator before returning to the house.

He found a movie on the computer in the study and watched it for a while. At around 11 O’ clock, old Blake also came to the Presidential Suite as promised.

Xia ruofei had prepared a total of 78 kilograms of truffles for old Blake. Among them, 30 kilograms were black truffles and 48 kilograms were white truffles.

Old Blake was overjoyed when he saw the box full of truffles. He kept thanking Xia ruofei.

This batch of truffles had far exceeded old Blake’s expectations in both quantity and quality.

As for the purchase price, old Blake offered 10000 euros for each kilogram of black truffle, and 25000 euros for white truffle.

This price was much higher than the high price Bastian had just offered.

Xia ruofei was naturally satisfied with the price.

Of course, he wouldn’t tell old Blake that he had just sold another batch of truffles at 8000 and 20000 euros per unit.
