Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei quickly said,”it’s my fault!” It’s my fault! How about this! Tell the winery to pick up the stock in the afternoon and bring some new wine over! In the future, I’ll try my best to arrange everything in advance, so that such a situation won’t happen again!”

Xia ruofei continued.”Oh, right. The wine this time should be better than the previous ones. We can get the winery to appraise it. We can have more high – end wine.”

Xia ruofei had been busy challenging the trial Pagoda for the past two months and did not care about the wine stored in the Archean realm. The storage time had naturally exceeded his expectations. Hence, this batch of wine was naturally more mellow and of a higher quality than before.

LingXiaotian chuckled,”it’s alright!” It didn’t matter! In fact, although the profit of the winery was very high, if you had difficulties and couldn’t take care of them, you could just close it down. The money would never be enough! But some of my old friends always ask me for wine, and I’m almost out of stock. You know, if I can’t take it out, I’ll lose face!”

“I understand, 1 understand!” Xia ruofei said,”I was thoughtless this time. Don’t do it again!”

Ling Qingxue pouted and said,”dad!” Why are you talking about work again? Can’t you just eat properly?” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“My good daughter has an opinion!” Ling Xiaotian laughed and said,”I won’t say anymore! I won’t say anymore! Let’s eat! Come, come, come, let’s have a drink together! This wine is really fragrant!”

“Cheers!” Xia ruofei also smiled and picked up his cup.

“I’ll take a sip, you guys do it!” Ling Qingxue said with a smile.

The three of them had a Happy Meal. Xia ruofei accompanied Ling Xiaotian to make tea and chat. They only got up to leave at two in the afternoon.

Ling Xiaotian personally stood up to send him off. Xia ruofei took out a porcelain bottle from his bag and passed it to Ling Xiaotian, saying,””Uncle Ling, these are some nourishing pills that I’ve concocted. They’re good for your body. Just take one pill every day before bed. It’ll help you sleep.”

Xia ruofei had obtained a lot of inherited knowledge from the Jade talisman of inheritance and the ninth level of the trial Pagoda. Among them, there were many prescriptions that could prolong one’s life and were even effective for cultivators. Coincidentally, he had planted many Chinese medicinal herbs in the spirit map space, so Xia ruofei directly created a simplified version of the prescription that was effective for ordinary people in the secular world. He used oneo’ clock in the morning to make this bottle of pills.

If Ling Xiaotian could persist in taking it for a long time, he would not be sick or in pain for a lifetime, and it would not be a problem for him to live over a hundred years.

Ling Qingxue knew what was good, and her eyes lit up. She quickly said,””Dad! Hurry up and keep it! This is a good thing, it can extend one’s life!”

Although Ling Xiaotian did not know the value of these pills, this was a child’s filial piety after all. He happily took the porcelain bottle and said,””Ruofei is so considerate! Thanks a lot!”

“Dad! Please don’t take it lightly!” Ling Qingxue said,”the pills that RUO Fei personally concocted are very effective!” You must take it every day. Tell RUO Fei in advance after you finish it and ask him to make more!”

“Yes, yes, yes!” Xia ruofei quickly said,”if you had told me earlier, 1 would have continued to make more for you. This is very good for the body in the long run!”

Ling Xiaotian chuckled and said,”good, good, good!” I’ve remembered it all. Take it every day before bed, right? I’m just about to take some blood pressure medicine, so we can just take it together!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be stunned.””Uncle Ling, you’re still taking blood pressure medicine?”

“Yup! I’ve been eating it for a few years …”Ling Xiaotian said,” what’s wrong? Is there a problem?”

“Um … Don’t you keep measuring your blood pressure every day?” Xia ruofei asked with a strange expression.

After he had helped Ling Xiaotian recuperate, chronic diseases such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol should have almost been cured. However, Xia ruofei was planning to do it slowly and did not use the spirit Heart Flower petals to cure them all at once. After all, that would be too shocking, so the process was a little slow.

“I haven’t felt any dizziness recently, and 1 haven’t taken my blood pressure!” Ling Xiaotian said indifferently.

His high blood pressure wasn’t particularly serious, so he only took a small amount of it. However, he had to take it for life, so he was used to taking it every day.

“You didn’t go for a physical examination recently?” Xia ruofei asked.

“I haven’t had a physical examination for almost a year. I’ve been quite busy recently.” Ling Xiaotian said. He couldn’t help but look at Ling Qingxue. If it wasn’t for the fact that Ling Qingxue was becoming more and more reluctant to manage things, why would he be so busy?

Ling Xiaotian could not help but ask,””RUO Fei, what’s wrong?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said!”lt’s nothing! Uncle Ling! Why don’t you go for! Physical examination when you’re free!! Also, don’t continue taking the blood pressure pills!”

“What’s the situation?” Ling Xiaotian was a little nervous because of Xia ruofei.”! feel that my body has been quite good recently! Don’t scare me!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”uncle Ling, you’ve misunderstood!” There’s nothing wrong with your body. That’s why 1 said you’d better not take any more painkillers, or you’ll have low blood pressure … However, just to be safe, it’s necessary for you to do a physical examination to confirm it.”

Actually, with Xia ruofei’s current level of spiritual power, he could tell if Ling Xiaotian had any illness with a simple glance. However, from Ling Xiaotian’s point of view, he would definitely believe the hospital’s test data more. He couldn’t be so careless, especially when it came to stopping taking blood pressure medication.

Ling Qingxue knew what Xia ruofei was capable of. She understood immediately and said,””Father, ruofei is right. You can check it when you have time. Also, you should take your blood pressure at home! If your blood pressure is normal, then don’t take any painkillers!”

“Oh! 1 know, I know!” Ling Xiaotian was a little confused, but he still nodded in agreement.

Xia ruofei then bade farewell and drove to the warehouse in the northern part of the city.

He had not been here for a long time, and the warehouse was covered in a thick layer of dust.

However, Xia ruofei was only using this place as a resource transfer station, so he did not care much.

After he took out the Drunken Eight Immortals wine from the spirit map space, the winery’s car arrived as promised, bringing more new wine than before.

The workers of the winery were all experienced. They quickly unloaded the new wine and loaded the “improved wine” that Xia ruofei had prepared.

Xia ruofei placed the new wine in the spirit map space and locked the warehouse door. Then, he drove back to the jiangbin villa district.

After all this work, the sky outside was almost dark.

Just as Xia ruofei was about to go to the kitchen to prepare something to eat, Ling Qingxue called ran ran. She had already prepared dinner and Ling Xiaotian asked him to go over and have a drink or two.

Naturally, Xia ruofei was happy to be at ease. He strolled to Ling Qingxue’s Villa. The father and daughter had already prepared dinner. A portion of the dishes were left unfinished in the afternoon, and Ling Xiaotian had added two or three more dishes, filling up the entire table.

Ling Xiaotian smiled and greeted,”RUO Fei!” Come and sit! Let’s have a few drinks tonight to celebrate!”

Xia ruofei was stunned and asked,”celebrate?” What are we celebrating?”

“To celebrate the disappearance of my high blood pressure!” Ling Xiaotian said with a smile,”! took blood pressure three times in the afternoon, and it was normal! I didn’t take any blood pressure pills today!” The father and daughter had already prepared dinner. A portion of the dishes were left unfinished in the afternoon, and Ling Xiaotian had added two or three more dishes, filling up the entire table.

Ling Xiaotian smiled and greeted,”RUO Fei!” Come and sit! Let’s have a few drinks tonight to celebrate!”

Xia ruofei was stunned and asked,”celebrate?” What are we celebrating?”

“To celebrate the disappearance of my high blood pressure!” Ling Xiaotian said with a smile,”i took blood pressure three times in the afternoon, and it was normal! I didn’t take any blood pressure pills today!”
