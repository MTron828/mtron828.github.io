Xia ruofei answered the call and laughed.”Young master Song, how come you’re so free today?”

On the other end of the phone, song Rui snorted and said,”If I didn’t make the call, you wouldn’t have to care about the things here, would you? You’re the major shareholder! Do we owe you something after all this running?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”we’re all brothers. There’s no need to be so formal!” Beijing is your territory, unlike me, who is unfamiliar with this place. Shouldn’t you do more?”

“That’s true, but you should at least put on an act! Even if it’s just a call to show some concern!” Song Rui said unhappily,”you’re good. It’s as if this never happened!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”Okay, okay, okay!” I’m in the wrong, alright? Speak! Why are you looking for me this time?”

“Of course it’s about the club!” Song Rui said,”brother Zhao and I have basically confirmed the target of the land. The shooting of that land will start soon. Brother Zhao asked you to come and give us some advice!”

Xia ruofei said casually,”you guys can decide on this!” I’m a blood amateur, I don’t know anything about it!”

“You have to come even if you don’t understand!” Song Rui said angrily,”didn’t you buy a big siheyuan in liuhai alley? If you don’t come back to stay, you’re going to go moldy!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”you don’t have to worry about this. I have Wu Qiang to help take care of it!” If you’re moldy, my courtyard house won’t be moldy either!”

“F * ck! You’re deliberately angering me, right?” Song Rui wailed,”are you coming or not? Give me a word!” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei felt that he had teased her enough, so he said lazily,””Alright! I’ll arrange some work in the next two days, then I’ll come to Beijing! Sigh ... I’ve just returned from a business trip for more than ten days, and now I have to travel again. What a tiring life ...”

Song Rui was so angry that his lungs were about to explode. [You’ve thrown all these things to us. I’m living like a god on the three mountains. How can you say this ...]

Before Xia ruofei could finish, song Rui hung up the phone.

Xia ruofei laughed and put away his phone. He then said to Ling Xiaotian and Ling Qingxue,””Song Rui is furious. He said that I’m not involved. They’ve basically decided on the location of the club. They’ll start shooting on that land in a few days. They want me to go to Beijing too!”

When Ling Qingxue heard this, she felt a little disappointed. Xia ruofei had just returned from a trip of more than ten days. The two of them had not even properly expressed their feelings of parting! They were going to Beijing soon.

However, she was also a strong woman, so she knew that men should put their career first, so she didn’t show it. Instead, she smiled and said,””I’d be angry too! Why do you have a share in the money – making, but when it’s time to work, you’re the hands – off boss! Since they want you to go, you should go and take a look!”

Ling Xiaotian also said,”that’s right, ruofei!” This is a big deal, and you’ve invested so much money. It’s only right for you to go and check it out!”

In reality, Ling Xiaotian was still envious of Xia ruofei. He wondered what kind of status song Rui had. Ordinary people would not be able to talk to him at all, but Xia ruofei could laugh and curse so casually. This showed that the two of them were very close.

It was also because of this that Ling Xiaotian was full of confidence in the group’s prospects of entering the capital.

The three of them chatted in Ling Xiaotian’s office for a while. Seeing that it was almost time to get off work, Ling Xiaotian smiled and stood up,””Ruofei, I have a lunch appointment with a friend this afternoon, so I won’t be accompanying you. You can have dinner with Qingxue! Or we can go home and cook together ... I won’t be going back at noon, I’ll come to work directly after I’m done with the business. ”

After he finished speaking, Ling Xiaotian packed his things and left his office.

Xia ruofei looked at Ling Qingxue with a smile that was not a smile.

Ling Qingxue naturally knew that her father was just making space for the two of them! She could feel the flirtatious look in Xia ruofei’s eyes and could not help but pinch Xia ruofei’s arm.

Xia ruofei laughed heartily. He put his arm around Ling Qingxue’s shoulder and lowered his head to kiss her.

......

In the afternoon, Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue naturally did not want to disappoint Ling Xiaotian. The two of them drove straight back to the Ling family’s jiangbin villa.

After having lunch at home, Ling Qingxue gave the housekeeper a break with a slightly red face.

When Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue were the only ones left in the villa, the two of them could not hold it in any longer and kissed each other tightly.

After a long time, Xia ruofei carried Ling Qingxue by the waist and strode upstairs. He pushed open the door to Ling Qingxue’s room.

For a time, the room was filled with the feeling of spring ...

The rain had just stopped. Ling Qingxue snuggled up to Xia ruofei and said softly,””Ruofei, you’ve just returned, but you’re leaving so soon ...”

Xia ruofei caressed Ling Qingxue’s soft hair as he asked gently,””Wife, you can’t bear to?”

“En!” Ling Qingxue nodded her head and said,”we live in the same city, but we’ve been apart more than together ...”

Xia ruofei sighed and said,””It’s mainly because we’re both too busy, each with our own business! But the next step is to move our company’s headquarters to the city, so we should have more opportunities to meet ...”
