2990 Asking for humiliation (1)

“Uncle Feng, what’s the matter now?” Wu Ming said impatiently. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Young sect leader, this isn’t how you calculate your debts!” Luo Feng said with a bitter smile. This was an auction, so naturally, the cultivator who entrusted the auction had the right to make the decision. The firecloud pill might not be worth 1000 spirit stones per pill, but the problem was that even if they had spirit stones, they could not buy the firecloud pill! If a cultivator who sells matching rings happens to be in need of firecloud pills but can’t find a way to buy them, they’ll definitely choose to add spirit stones to the firecloud pill rather than ask for more spirit stones!”

Wu Ming pouted and said,”how can it be so coincidental?” What that kid took out just happened to be what the other party needed, and it’s something they urgently needed?”

As soon as Wu Ming’s voice fell, Hao Qingsong, who was on the main auction stage, said, “I’ve already spoken to the fellow Daoist who entrusted me with the auction. He’s willing to accept the offer of fifty thousand spirit stones and firecloud pills! However, the premise is that the quality of the firecloud pill must pass the test. Even if it’s not newly refined but excavated from the ruins of ancient cultivation, it can’t be the kind that has lost most of its medicinal properties. ”

Some relatively rare medicinal pills and medicines in the modern cultivation world could often be excavated from ancient cultivation ruins. However, due to the different storage environments, the degree of medicinal properties loss was also greatly different. Some could even perfectly retain all the medicinal properties. Therefore, the quality of the medicines excavated from the same ancient cultivation ruins would be greatly different.

In room 20, Xia ruofei smiled confidently and said,””Of course! The quality of the firecloud pill could definitely be guaranteed, and the medicinal properties would not be lost in the slightest. If you can’t meet this standard, I’m willing to compensate you ten times the amount, which is five hundred thousand spirit stones. ”

Xia ruofei had already expected this outcome. He had done his homework after getting some inside information from Liu chengfeng.

The person who entrusted the auction of the pair of Phoenix rings was Mu Sheng, the head of the surging waves sect. He needed to buy a spirit herb to cure the damaged meridians of his only son, mu Jianfei, but he didn’t have enough spirit stones, so he reluctantly gave it up.

After Xia ruofei heard the news, he immediately understood the situation of the surging waves sect.

He found that Mu Sheng and his son’s main cultivation method was water attribute, and there was a high probability that mu Jianfei had accidentally injured his meridians while cultivating water attribute cultivation method.

Although water attribute cultivation techniques were generally more gentle, if one’s meridians were damaged due to improper cultivation, it would be extremely difficult to recover.

This also indirectly confirmed that even Mu Sheng, a golden core stage cultivator who was the sect leader and had a certain healing attribute in his cultivation method, was helpless and had to seek medical advice everywhere.

After getting hold of this crucial information, the first thing that came to Xia ruofei’s mind was the fire cloud pill.

Just as the cultivators had discussed, the firecloud pill had a unique advantage in repairing the meridians damaged by water attribute cultivation techniques, and the effect was immediate.

Xia ruofei didn’t know if there was anyone in the modern cultivation world who could make the fire cloud pill, but he guessed that the prescription should have been lost. Otherwise, if Mu Sheng tried to use the fire cloud pill to treat mu Jianfei, it should have worked. After all, mu Jianfei was only a Qi refining stage cultivator. Even if he lost control of his true Qi due to improper cultivation, the consequences should not be too serious.

If Mu Sheng had already tried the fire cloud pill and it still didn’t work, then Xia ruofei had no other choice. He could only rely on his own judgment to make the best plan.

Of course, Xia ruofei had also mastered many formulas that were more advanced than the firecloud pill. However, they were all real elixirs. Xia ruofei had not broken through to the intermediate stage of the Golden core realm and could not make them.

This was even taking into account the advantages of the great Dao Arts. For ordinary cultivators, they could only try to refine real medicinal pills at least in the late – Stage of the Golden core stage.

Therefore, even though there were better medicines, Xia ruofei could not make them and there was nothing he could do.

Since the start of the auction, Xia ruofei’s new arrival had basically made it impossible to find any high – Quality Qi – gathering pill formula in the modern cultivation world. The even more difficult to refine fire cloud pill was most likely lost. Moreover, he had earned so many spirit stones. If he had to get this pair of storage rings, he could just throw them away with spirit stones. In the end, the winner would definitely be him.

Other cultivators would consider the cost – Performance ratio, but Xia ruofei did not care much about spiritual stones.

However, the development of the matter did not exceed Xia ruofei’s expectations. After he proposed the spirit stones plus firecloud pill, Mu Sheng quickly transmitted a message to Hao Qingsong and accepted it without the slightest hesitation.

In room 15.

Wu Ming’s face alternated between red and white. As soon as he finished speaking, he was ruthlessly slapped in the face by Hao Qingsong’s words.

When he heard that Xia ruofei had “used the same old trick” again, demanding compensation of ten times if there was a problem with the firecloud pill, he was even more furious.

Even though Luo Feng had already explained to him, he still couldn’t help but shout,””Elder Tong, isn’t this a little inappropriate? I’m offering 55000 spiritual stones! Were five firecloud pills worth five thousand spirit stones? Even if each firecloud pill was worth a thousand spirit stones, there should be a first come, first served basis, right? I’m the one who bid 55000 first!”

“Young sect Master Wu, this is the rule of the auction,” Hao Qingsong said with a faint smile. “When a fellow Daoist uses an item to pay spirit stones, the client has the right to decide whether to choose the item or the pure spirit stones. After all, the price of an item is different in the eyes of different people. Naturally, the client’s judgment will be the deciding factor. ”

Hao Qingsong’s explanation was plain, but it left Wu Ming speechless.

Luo Feng couldn’t help but smile wryly. He had already said that Wu Ming was a bad guy, but he just didn’t believe him!

Wu Ming’s face was as calm as water. He gritted his teeth and said loudly,””Elder Tong, since it’s an auction, I can still continue bidding, right?”

Hao Qingsong stared blankly for a moment, before saying with a bitter smile,”Of course, but ...”

“Since I can offer a higher price, I’ll take it that the star Seizer sect’s offer of 50000 spirit stones and five firecloud pills is higher than my 55000 spirit stones offer!” Wu Ming snorted coldly and said,”now, I’ll bid again. 80000 spirit stones! Let the fellow Daoist who entrusted the auction to me choose for himself!”

Beside him, Luo Feng’s expression changed drastically when he heard this. Wu Ming had completely lost his mind after being provoked repeatedly.

80,000 spirit stones were all they had brought with them on this trip. Wu Ming threw all of them in.

Now that things had developed to this point, no matter what the final result was, the spirit Vulture mountain would become a joke.

If the person who entrusted the auction to him didn’t want the 80000 spirit stones and still chose the 50000 spirit stones plus five firecloud pills, it would be a real slap in the face.

If the other party chose 80000 spiritual stones, it meant that the treasure had not even been auctioned off. The spiritual stones that the lingjue mountain had brought out this time had all been used up. Moreover, their young sect master had used 80000 spiritual stones, which was at least twice the normal price, to buy two storage rings back just to make the beauty smile. This would also become a huge joke.

Hao Qingsong’s expression slightly changed. After a quick thought, he said,”I need to communicate with the fellow Daoist who entrusted the auction of the pair of rings. Before that, I’d like to ask fellow Daoist Xia in room 20 if you’d like to change your offer. ”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,” 50000 spiritual stones and five firecloud pills. That’s my final offer.” I feel that my offer is already very sincere. If I still can’t buy back that pair of storage rings, it means that I’m not fated to be with them. By the way, my firecloud pill is not for sale. I won’t sell it no matter how many spirit stones you give me after the auction. ”

Xia ruofei was now very sure that Mu Sheng was in urgent need of the firecloud pill. Moreover, in the current cultivation world, it seemed that no one could refine the firecloud pill.

Thus, he was very confident.

The value of an item was never determined by the market price alone. In many cases, the relationship between supply and demand played a decisive role. Of course, in a broad sense, this was also a factor of the market situation.

“I understand.” Hao Qingsong said with a smile.

Then, he directly began to communicate with Mu Sheng.

The cultivators of the surging waves sect were all arranged to be in room 10. Other than Mu Sheng and the pale – faced mu Jianfei, there was also elder mu Hua. He was also an early golden core cultivator in his early sixties, which was considered relatively young among the Golden core cultivators.

“Sect leader, 80000 spirit stones can buy quite a lot of medicine to warm the meridians in addition to the red flame Grass.” Mu Hua said.

He was obviously a little tempted by Wu Ming’s crazy offer. Under normal circumstances, it would be a miracle if the ring could be sold for 50000 spirit stones. After all, it only had one function.

However, Mu Sheng calmly asked,”can the red flame Grass definitely cure Fei ‘er’s injury?” Even if you add in some ordinary medicine that nourishes the meridians, how much effect will it have?”

Mu Hua hesitated for a moment and said,”but the firecloud pill might not be able to completely cure him. Moreover, five pills seem to be too little. With young sect leader’s injuries, I’m afraid it’s not enough ...”

Mu Sheng smiled and said,”at least the firecloud pill is the most appropriate. Moreover, the hope of recovery with the firecloud pill is much greater than with the red flame Grass.” As for if five firecloud pills aren’t enough ... Maybe we can continue to buy from him ...”

“Father, you mean they ...” Mu Jianfei’s eyes lit up.

“En!” Mu Sheng nodded and said,”it’s rare to see a container that can perfectly preserve the medicinal properties. They are so confident in the medicinal properties of these five firecloud pills. It’s very likely that they refined these firecloud pills themselves!”
