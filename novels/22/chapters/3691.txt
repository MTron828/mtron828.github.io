Chapter 3692: RUO Fei’s banquet (1)

Translator: 549690339

“That’s good!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Then, he cast a questioning gaze at Liu Mansha. In his impression, Liu Mansha was a relatively cold senior. She had never spoken to cultivators from other sects, especially male cultivators.

Liu Mansha’s attitude towards Xia ruofei was pretty good. However, Xia ruofei felt that Liu Mansha would probably reject drinking, so he did not expect her to agree to go with him.

Unexpectedly, Liu Mansha did not hesitate and said with a smile,””How could 1 miss such a good opportunity to taste fellow Daoist Xia’s cooking? Fellow Daoist Xia, I would like to bring my disciple Xin ‘er with me, would that be too much of a disturbance?”

Xia ruofei looked at Yu Xin ‘er, who had her head slightly lowered, and chuckled. “You’re too kind, Valley master Liu. Miss Xin ‘er, brother Chen, and I are teammates who have gone through thick and thin together. I’d be more than happy to welcome you if you were to bring her along!” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Mu Sheng laughed and said,”in that case, I’ll bring my son along. He’s also your teammate!”

“No problem!” Xia ruofei said readily.

Chen Xuan pondered for a moment before he leaned over to Xia ruofei and whispered something into his ear.

Xia ruofei was slightly stunned, but he quickly nodded and said,””Alright! It’s more lively with more people!”

Chen Xuan nodded his head and smiled,””Alright!”

Following that, Chen Xuan cast his gaze down to the lower level of the grandstand and found Shen Hu’s figure.

“Sect Master Shen, please bring your disciples and accompany me to tonight’s banquet!” Chen Xuan said loudly. Maybe if brother Fei gives you a few pointers, you’ll be able to break through to the Golden core stage!”

Shen Hu could not help but be surprised and happy when he heard this. He quickly nodded and said,”Yes! Thank you for your guidance, young sect leader! Thank you for your guidance, young sect leader!”

The cultivators beside Shen Hu couldn’t help but look at him with envy and jealousy.

Originally, Shen Hu’s sect was isolated in the ocean and his cultivation was not at the Golden core stage. Among the many cultivators who came to watch the ceremony, he was considered ordinary.

However, Chen Xuan’s unexpected invitation had instantly turned him into a lucky man in the eyes of the Qi condensation cultivators.

Many people were also secretly thinking that this unremarkable sect leader of the water element sect seemed to be very close to young master Chen of the first heaven sect! If there was a chance in the future, he would definitely make friends with them.

They were not on the same level as Xia ruofei and Chen Xuan, but Shen Hu was only a Qi layer cultivator. Even though he was the sect leader, his status was not much different from the Qi layer cultivators who attended the ceremony. There was still a chance to get to know him.

Only Shen Hu himself knew that the only reason he was personally chosen by Chen Xuan to accompany him was because of this female disciple with a low cultivation.

At this moment, Xia ruofei looked around and smiled gently. He raised his voice and said,””When 1 was listening to sect leader Chen’s lecture just now, 1 had a sudden feeling and involuntarily entered a state of cultivation. I’ve wasted everyone’s time, so I’d like to apologize to everyone.”

“Fellow Daoist Xia, you’re being too serious.”

“I don’t dare! I don’t dare!”

“It is our honor to witness fellow Daoist Xia’s extraordinary talent!”

“This matter will definitely become a good story in the future!”

The cultivators on the grandstand said one after another, their words revealing a trace of awe.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded to thank everyone. Then, he made an inviting gesture and walked down the grandstand with Mu Sheng, Chen Xuan, Liu Mansha, and the others.

Shen Hu hurriedly followed along with Lu You.

The cultivators on the grandstand sat on the spot until Xia ruofei and the rest disappeared around the corner of the mountain road. Then, they got up and left.

On the way back, the cultivators were also discussing in low voices with their acquaintances.

Xia ruofei brought everyone back to his courtyard and smiled.””Seniors, fellow Daoists, please take a rest in the living room. I’ll go and prepare the ingredients now!”

“Brother RUO Fei, do you want me to get a disciple to send it over?” Chen Xuan asked.

Xia ruofei waved his hand.”No need, no need. I’ve prepared the ingredients. Everyone, just wait for the meal!”

Liu Mansha looked at Yu xiner without saying anything.

Yu Xin ‘er immediately understood, but she hesitated for a moment before saying shyly,””Fellow Daoist Xia, I’ll go help you!”

Lu You also reacted immediately. She stood up and said,””RUO Fei, I’ll go help too!”

The way Lu You addressed Xia ruofei made Mu Sheng, Liu Mansha, and the rest look at Lu You deeply. They had all sorts of guesses in their hearts.

“Sect leader mu, Valley master Liu, 1 forgot to introduce you. This is Lu You, a disciple of the water element sect. She and brother ruofei were good friends in the mortal world before they embarked on the path of cultivation.” Chen Xuan chuckled.

Mu Sheng and the others suddenly came to a realization.

Liu Mansha smiled.”A friend from the secular world. Both of you have embarked on the path of cultivation. It seems that fellow Daoist Xia and miss Lu are really fated!” She said.

When Lu You heard Liu Mansha’s words, she couldn’t help but feel a hint of sweetness in her heart.

Since Chen Xuan had said so, Xia ruofei had nothing to hide. He smiled and said,””Seniors, please take care of Lu You in the future! She hasn’t been cultivating for long, so whether she can break through to Jindan in the future will still depend on the guidance of the seniors!”

“Little brother Xia, you’re being too serious. With your care, miss Lu’s future will naturally be limitless. She won’t need our help!” Mu Sheng said with a smile..
