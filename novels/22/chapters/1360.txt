Chapter 1361: Song Wei’s conditions (1)

Translator: 549690339

Song Wei fell into silence.

If Xia ruofei had asked her for help because of something else, she would have done her best to help him without any hesitation.

However, the Ming Dynasty Tomb incident had formed a huge psychological shadow in her heart. Most importantly, she did not want Xia ruofei to take the risk.

However, since Xia ruofei had already made it clear, it would be unreasonable for Song Wei to reject him.

“Ruofei, must you go?” she asked with a sigh.

Xia ruofei said without hesitation,”I have to go!” Song Wei, even if you don’t help me, I’ll still go. At most, I’ll have to spend more time to investigate the specific location of the tomb ...”

“That place is constantly guarded. Even if you find it, you won’t be able to enter.” Song Wei said.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”as long as we can find the place, I have my ways.” Of course, if you’re willing to help coordinate and make these connections work, that would be the best. If it doesn’t work, I can only look for song Rui ...”

Song Rui’s father, song Zhengping, was now the head of the xiangnan province. Song Wei had mentioned that the Ming Dynasty Tomb was in xiangnan province. If Xia ruofei wanted to find out more, it would not be too difficult.

Song Wei had also thought of this. She hesitated for a moment and said,”I can take you there ...”

She was worried that if Xia ruofei could not get help from her, it would be even more dangerous for him to explore the terrifying tomb.

Song Wei felt that no matter what, she had been inside the tomb before and had some understanding of the situation. It was better than Xia ruofei barging in without thinking.

Xia ruofei was overjoyed,”that’s great!” Song Wei, thank you! I owe you a favor!”

“I still owe you my life!” Song Wei said with a bitter smile. RUO Fei, don’t be happy too early. I have conditions!”

“Speak!” Xia ruofei replied readily,”as long as it’s within my means, I will definitely agree!”

“I can bring you there, and I can also pull some strings so that we can enter the tomb smoothly. But you have to bring me along ...” Song Wei said without hesitation.

Xia ruofei was stunned. He only wanted Song Wei to show him the way. After all, he did not even know that the tomb was located in xiangnan province before he made the call today. Besides, he wanted Song Wei to help him to coordinate things so that he would be able to avoid a lot of trouble.

However, no matter what, he had never thought of bringing Song Wei down to the tomb.

After all, the colorless and odorless poison formed by the tiny substances peeled off from the world stone’s surface could have filled the entire tomb, and Xia ruofei himself didn’t know how concentrated it was. In addition, Xia Qing had told him that the tomb was likely to be located in an extreme Yin place, and there might be unknown dangers.

Song Wei was just an ordinary person. It was extremely dangerous for her to follow him into the tomb.

“Song Wei, wouldn’t it be better if you brought me to the place and waited for me outside?” Xia ruofei said,”you also know that it’s very dangerous in the tomb.”

“I only have one condition. If you want my help, you have to agree to it,” Song Wei said stubbornly.

“Why bother?” Xia ruofei smiled bitterly.”I’m just going in to find something. I’ll be out soon ...”

“That’s my condition. If you don’t agree to it, I won’t take you there ...” Song Wei said without giving in.

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly. He thought for a while and said,””Alright! Since you insist, then let’s go together!”

He believed that with his abilities, it should not be a problem to protect Song Wei.

Most importantly, his mental energy was a few realms higher than his own cultivation. He was also very sensitive to unknown dangers in the tomb. As long as he kept his nerves on edge, there should not be any problems.

“Alright, when do you plan to go?” Song Wei smiled.

Xia ruofei said,”it’s easy to arrange my time. It mainly depends on your time.”

Song Wei thought for a while and said,”I still have to go back to school to take an exam before the winter break. After the winter break, it will be the Spring Festival soon. How about ... We go after the spring Festival?”

Xia ruofei did some calculations. It was only about a month, so he nodded and said,””No problem. We’ll do as you say!”

“Then let’s set the date to after the spring Festival and before the Lantern Festival!” Song Wei said. We’ll see when the exact date is!”

“Alright! Then it’s a deal!” Xia ruofei said,”Song Wei, you should rest early too. We’ll contact each other again.”

“Okay, good night!” Song Wei replied softly.

“Good night!”

After hanging up the phone, Song Wei’s expression was complicated.

She didn’t know why she agreed to Xia ruofei’s crazy request. She even insisted on going to the tomb with him.

Could it be that the nightmarish experience last time was not enough to make her avoid the tomb?

Moreover, Song Wei realized that she was actually looking forward to the xiangnan trip that would take place in a month’s time.

What was wrong with him? Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Song Wei was lying on the bed with her phone in her hand, but her eyes were not focused at all. Her mind was in a mess.

That night was destined to be a sleepless one for Song Wei ...
