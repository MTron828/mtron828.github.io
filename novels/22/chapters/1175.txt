In fact, Xia ruofei had also tasted it. Although they were the same tea leaves, the tea leaves made by ye Lingyun were still a little different from the tea leaves made by Xia Qing in the medium.

Of course, Xia Qing’s cooking skills were not worse than li Zhifu ‘s. Moreover, there was such a rich spiritual energy in the space. It was already very good that ye Lingyun was able to do this.

At least, compared to the Da Hong Pao that cost thousands of Yuan per 500 grams outside, it didn’t taste bad at all. Moreover, it was less flamboyant, which was very rare.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it’s already very good!” Ling Yun, I’ll prepare some Tea Green for you in two days. You can try it out. ”

“Good! Thank you, brother Xia!” Ye linyun said happily.

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”these are all additional work. You’re contributing to the company! I’ll provide you with more tea leaves when the quality of the tea leaves is stable. Our company can also launch our own brand of tea leaves!”

“Yes! Brother Xia, I’ll definitely complete this mission beautifully!” Ye linyun patted his chest and said.

He had been learning the ancient tea – making methods from li Zhifu for a long time and had fallen in love with this industry. He was so happy in Xia ruofei’s company. If he could do the job he loved, it would be perfect!

In the next few days, Xia ruofei brought some tea leaves to make tea for ye Lingyun.

Ye linyun was indeed talented.

The quality of the tea leaves he made got better and better, and his control of the fire also quickly stabilized.

In the past few days, they had produced a total of seven to eight catties of tea leaves. Xia ruofei asked ye Lingyun to distribute them to the farm employees so that they could have a taste and give more suggestions.

Although the tea leaves made by ye Lingyun didn’t have beautiful packaging, they were very fragrant. When they were brewed, the room was filled with the fragrance of tea. Even the villagers who didn’t know how to taste tea couldn’t stop praising them.

Of course, they didn’t give any suggestions. In fact, even Xia ruofei couldn’t give any suggestions.

There was still a certain difference between these tea leaves and the ones made by Xia Qing, but it was all determined by the technique and the fine control of the fire. It couldn’t be improved in one or two days.

In any case, the tea leaves made by ye Lingyun had completely reached the market sales standard and could definitely be called high – Quality.

Xia ruofei was very satisfied with ye Lingyun’s work. He immediately ordered the finance department to give ye Lingyun and a few other employees a bonus for participating in the tea – making.

He was prepared to provide ye Lingyun with a large number of tea leaves in a while and let him set up a relatively fixed team to handle the tea.

Of course, he still had to hold the position of head of security.

The main reason why they did not start mass production immediately was that Xia ruofei needed time to prepare the tea leaves.

Although there were many tea trees in the mountain sea realm, without the flow of time, even if the environment was far better than the outside world, they could only be harvested three to four times a year.

On the other hand, tea trees at the Archean realm could be harvested once every ten days or so. However, the number of tea trees was relatively small, so he needed some time to stock up on the tea leaves. After all, once the tea leaves were harvested and placed in the origin space, as long as they didn’t come into direct contact with the soil in the origin space, they could be kept fresh for a long time. Once they were taken out, they would be the same as when they were just harvested.

Of course, there was another reason. Xia ruofei had to go to the capital city again. The preparation for the launch of the Xuanji jaded skin cream had been completed and they were ready to hold a new product launch.

Therefore, he planned to deal with the tea production after he returned from Beijing.

After all, to market the tea leaves, they also needed to promote it, design the packaging, contact the sales channels, and so on. It was not as simple as producing the product.

Feng Jing had been staying in the capital. After the post – production of the promotional video was completed, she sent it to Xia ruofei for review. The results were very good.

At first, Xia ruofei was worried that Duff was a Westerner and would not match the Chinese style of the promotional film. After watching the film, his worries disappeared.

The background was an ancient town that looked like an ink painting. In the midst of the flying petals, a white – robed Duff walked up the river barefooted, looking like a flower Fairy.

The team provided by Jennifer was indeed a gold medal team in Hollywood. Even an advertisement was shot with the effect of a blockbuster.

Xia ruofei was very satisfied.

After about half a month, Xia ruofei took a plane back to the capital.

As soon as he walked out of the airport, Wu Qiang, who had been waiting for a long time, quickly walked up to him.

“Boss!” Wu Qiang greeted Xia ruofei respectfully as he took Xia ruofei’s small suitcase.

“You’ve worked hard!” Xia ruofei smiled. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

After getting into the car at the parking lot, Xia ruofei asked,””How’s the renovation of the courtyard house going?”

“The old platoon leader had personally informed us, and there aren’t many areas that you need to change, so the progress is still very fast.” Wu Qiang said while driving,”most of them are done, but there are still some work left to clean up. I’ll ask them to stop for two days so as not to disturb your rest.”

“Good! You’ve worked hard during this period of time. ” Xia ruofei said.

“You’re welcome. This is my job!” “Boss, where are we going now?” Wu Qiang quickly replied and asked.

“Let’s go back to the courtyard house first!” Xia ruofei said,”I’m going to take a nap. Call me when we’re there.”
