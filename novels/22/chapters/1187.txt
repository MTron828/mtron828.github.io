Chapter 1188: Feng Jing’s surprise (2)

Translator: 549690339

Feng Jing was standing in the shadows, but her eyes were very bright. Xia ruofei could immediately feel that Feng Jing was looking at him. He could even see Feng Jing giving him a cheeky smile.

This was clearly the ‘surprise’ Feng Jing was talking about.

Once the video was played, Xia ruofei’s heart was at ease.

With this, it was hard for the jaded skin ointment not to become popular.

The jaded skin cream was a rare good product, and its skin care effects far exceeded those expensive similar products on the market.

What it lacked was brand awareness. If it were to develop step by step, with the quality of the jaded skin cream, it would naturally be able to develop and grow quickly. However, Xia ruofei felt that the speed was too slow, so he had today’s press conference which seemed to be a little self – important.

From the looks of it, due to Feng Jing’s ample preparation, the results of this press conference would far exceed their expectations.

For the media, with so many international female stars promoting a domestic skin care product, this in itself was a hot topic worth hyping up.

Besides, Xia ruofei also believed that the internet must be in an uproar.

And that was the truth.

Feng Xiaolong was a technical staff member of the well – known video website youdou. It was his turn to be on duty this afternoon.

He saw that in the background monitoring data, the traffic of a certain live broadcast link continued to rise, especially towards the end. More and more data requests flooded in, and it was simply growing exponentially.

Feng Xiaolong subconsciously thought that the website had been hacked.

He quickly typed on the keyboard and checked the status of the various ports on the website, but he did not find any traces of intrusion.

Xiaolong clicked on the data related to the livestream link, feeling a little strange. With his rich experience, he quickly realized that these were all normal connection requests, not an attack by hackers.

He quickly picked up the phone and asked for instructions from his superior while he began to allocate the server and bandwidth resources. After getting permission from his superior, he quickly doubled the server resources for this live stream channel and tilted the bandwidth resources to it.

The difficult situation of the interview began to ease quickly, and Feng Xiaolong was slightly relieved. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

After he took a sip of water, his curiosity was piqued, so he clicked on the live link and pulled the progress bar back to the time when the traffic had clearly peaked.

Feng Xiaolong almost spat out the water in his mouth when he saw it.

He quickly swallowed his saliva and dragged the progress bar forward. Then, he stared at it without blinking.

A similar situation was happening at the same time on several major video websites that paradise Corporation had bought advertising spots for.

At the Beijing University of Technology’s Stadium.

After the short video finished playing, Feng Jing walked up to the stage with a smile.

She gently pressed the PowerPoint Remote control, and two large words appeared on the big screen.

There was a big question mark behind the two words.

The finale of the press conference was naturally the price announcement.

The audience had been excited by the waves of surprises. The audience who had come with the mentality of a bystander were now sitting up straight, concerned about the final price of this magical skin care product.

The experienced reporters also raised their cameras and video cameras.

Feng Jing smiled.”I’m sure everyone’s interested in the introduction. How much will we be selling this product that’s made from all – Natural Chinese medicine ingredients?”

At this point, Feng Ye paused and deliberately kept her in suspense.

“Our jaded skin ointment uses 35 kinds of precious Chinese medicinal materials, of which at least ten are very rare,” she said.”Moreover, the production environment is extremely harsh. If there’s a slight flaw, the entire batch of jaded skin ointment must be thrown away, which also causes our cost to be extremely high.”

The audience and netizens couldn’t help but sigh in their hearts. There was no such thing as a free lunch in this world. If the effect of the jaded skin cream was really as good as what the celebrities said, then the price would definitely be quite touching. It was definitely not something that ordinary people could afford.

“Our sales team had a heated discussion about the pricing plan,” Feng Jing continued with a smile.”Some of our colleagues felt that if the price is lower than 3000 Yuan, we’ll be out of business. But ...”

Feng Jing looked at the audience and continued,””Our company’s principle has always been to walk the path of quality products, but we also hope that good products can be used by more people and let more people enjoy the effects of the magical Chinese medicine. Therefore, we would rather reduce our profits and at the same time, strive for perfection in the production process to reduce the waste rate and reduce costs.”

“Alright, let’s cut to the chase. Let’s reveal the price!” Feng ke said.

She pressed the PowerPoint Remote control, and a set of numbers floated over from the distance. They quickly combined and froze on the screen at 588 Yuan!

The moment this price was announced, it immediately caused another wave of exclamations.

Feng Jing had made so much preparation, and even though the final price wasn’t cheap, it was far lower than what everyone had expected.

“That’s right,” Feng Rao said with a smile.”The final price for our basic Jade skin cream Series is 588 Yuan a bottle. Our purpose is to let more people enjoy the miraculous effects of Chinese medicine!” Because you don’t have to use it every day, one bottle is enough to use normally for two to three months. After using it, you basically don’t need to use other essence water, moisturizer, face masks, etc., So I believe that even the working class can afford this price!”
