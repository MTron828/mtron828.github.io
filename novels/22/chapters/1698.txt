The expression on his face also became more and more colorful as the examination went on.

Finally, Carl stood up and looked at Old West excitedly. He asked in a hurry,””West, where did you get this oak tree? Why are there only two of them?”

“You don’t have to worry about that! I’m asking you if you’ll take this job or not. ” Old West asked smugly.

“Answer! Of course I’ll take it!” Carl said without hesitation.

Old West winked slyly and said,””We’re in a hurry and hope to get the barrels within a week. If that’s the case, you might have to stop all your other work. I’ll ask wahill if it’s not possible ...”

“Don’t you dare!” Carl glared at him and said,”West, we’ve known each other for decades! If you dare to hand this job over to wahill, I’ll cut off all ties with you immediately, do you believe me?”

Old Wester laughed out loud and patted Carl’s shoulder.””I’m just joking with you! Didn’t I call you as soon as I got the wood yesterday?”

Old West then said seriously,””But I wasn’t joking when I said I’d deliver it within a week. Are you sure you can complete it?”

“Of course!” Carl patted his chest and said,”stop the other orders for now. I’ll deal with these two logs personally. I’m sure it’ll be done within a week!”

“Uncle Carl, how many barrels can these two logs be made into?” Xia ruofei asked.

“How do you know?” Carl frowned. We can only come to a conclusion after going back and doing some precise calculations!”

Old West said,”Carl, don’t say I didn’t warn you, the owner of this wood is not me, it’s Xia ...”

Carl said nonchalantly,”I know. Didn’t you say so?” He’s the new boss of West Winery ...”

“You didn’t understand what I meant!” Old West smiled and said,”I mean ... This wood was obtained by Xia, and ... Next year, we will replace all the oak barrels in the winery with new barrels made of this oak. It will be the West Winery and the gold oak winery!”

Carl was stunned for a moment. Then, he looked at Xia ruofei. The cocky expression on his face disappeared and was replaced by a warm smile. With his unkempt beard, he looked like the master of a beggar sect when he smiled.

Xia ruofei felt a little scared and couldn’t help but say,””Uncle Carl ...”

Carl immediately said,”Mr. Xia!” Mr. Xia looks like a young and successful man. No wonder you were able to buy West Winery ...”

Old West reminded him,’Carl! Xia also bought the Golden Oak winery ...”

Carl choked for a moment, then immediately put on a smile and said,””Mr. Xia, let me introduce myself. My name is Carl ...” He said.

Xia ruofei was not used to it. He waved his hand and said,””Mr. Carl, I know that you’re the best bucket – jingling craftsman in the Hunter Valley area, right?”

“Hehe ... That was everyone’s honor ...” Karl said,”I apologize for my offense just now! Mr. Xia, I didn’t expect you to have such a way ... It’s not easy to get such top – grade oak ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Mr. Carl, if you have something to say, just say it!” I’m not used to this ...”

Feng Rao couldn’t help but burst into laughter. She was quite amused by Carl’s change in attitude.

Carl didn’t take it to heart. He continued to smile and said,””Mr. Xia, I have a presumptuous request. If you can get such oak next year, can you give me priority if you want to make oak barrels ...”

Xia ruofei looked at Feng Rao and old West, then said,””Uncle Carl, uncle Wester said that you’re the best bucket – jingling craftsman in the Hunter Valley area. If I can buy oak next year, I’ll definitely consider you first!”

Carl was overjoyed and quickly said,””Good, good, good! Mr. Xia was a straightforward person! Then we have a deal! I’ve decided on your winery’s oak barrel business for next year!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””No problem! However, these two logs of wood ...”

“Don’t worry, Mr. Xia,”Carl said quickly,”I’ll stop all the orders and give priority to your two logs!” By the way ... You just asked ...”

“How many oak barrels can these two logs be used to make?” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Yes, yes, yes!” Carl quickly said,”I’ve done a preliminary calculation. At least Five Oak barrels can be made. If the wood is conserved, it’s possible to make six more ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Uncle Carl, do as you see fit!” In any case, you should first ensure the quality of our oak barrels, don’t force yourself ...”

As if he had been insulted, Carl immediately said,””Don’t worry about that. My brand has been around for decades. Even if you don’t tell me, I’ll guarantee the quality of the barrels first. If you don’t believe me, you can ask West.”

Xia ruofei turned to look at Old West, who nodded and said,””Xia, don’t you worry about Carl’s character! He’s been making oak barrels in the Hunter Valley area for decades. It’s definitely the best quality!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said with a smile,””Uncle Carl, I’ll have to trouble you!”

“It’s no trouble, no trouble at all,” old Carl said with a smile.”It’s my honor to be of service to you!”

Then, he immediately said to Old West,””West, what are you doing? Why aren’t you calling a truck?”

“Oh oh oh oh! Just wait! I’ll call for it immediately!” Old West quickly said.

After a while, a flat truck drove over, and under Carl’s command, the workers loaded the wood into the truck and transported it away.

Xia ruofei and Feng Jing had also started working on the West Winery, mainly on the early stages of peeling off the skin and removing the stem. The later stages of the brewing process took too long, and Xia ruofei and Feng Jing might not be able to wait that long.

At noon, the workers finished processing the White grapes they had harvested today and went home.

Xia ruofei and Feng Jing also bade farewell to the West couple and prepared to Return to Paradise Farm.

Xia ruofei got into the Mercedes – Benz of Paradise Farm. Just as he was about to start the car, his phone rang.

Xia ruofei looked at the caller ID. It was Tang Yitian’s private number.

He pressed the answer button and said with a smile,””Hello, big brother Tang!”

“Ruofei, where are you now?” Tang Yitian asked from the other end of the phone.

Xia ruofei hesitated and said,””I’m sorry, big brother Tang ... I’m in the Hunter Valley now! I didn’t contact you as soon as I arrived at sutsune two days ago because the winery business here is more urgent ...”

“You’re really something, brother Xia!”Tang Yitian said after hearing that. You didn’t contact me even after you arrived in Australia, you’re treating me like an outsider!”

“No, no... Brother Tang, you’ve misunderstood ...” Xia ruofei quickly replied.

“Hmph!” Tang Yitian pretended to be angry. I saw the news and knew that the flight you were on was forced to surrender in Saipan. I thought you were in Saipan to cooperate with the investigation! Who knew that you would secretly come to Australia! You didn’t even greet me. It seems like you really don’t put me in your eyes!”

Xia ruofei smiled apologetically.”Big brother Tang, you’ve misunderstood ... The winery is about to harvest the grapes, so they’re waiting for me to come back and host the wine ceremony. That’s why I rushed back to the Hunter Valley as soon as I arrived in Australia. I haven’t had the time to contact you yet, right?”

Tang Yitian snorted and asked,””Are you free now?”

“I’ve been busy for the past two days.” Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment.”Big brother Tang, I’ll go to Sydney to visit you this afternoon!”

“That’s more like it!”Tang Yitian laughed. Brother Xia, I’ll ask Tiger to send a car to pick you up! I have a friend who wants to introduce you to him!”

Xia ruofei quickly said,”no, no, I’ll drive by myself!” Big brother Tang, you tell me the time and place, and I promise to be there on time!”
