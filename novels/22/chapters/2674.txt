After the goods were transported into the warehouse, Xia ruofei said to Liu Qingfeng,”Alright, there’s nothing for you to do here. You can go back and rest!”

Liu Qingfeng was stunned for a moment, and quickly asked,”Mr. Xia, what about you?”

“Me? I still have something to do at the warehouse, you don’t have to worry about me. ” Xia ruofei said indifferently,”be careful of bainilatti when we get back ... Forget it. Send him to the warehouse tomorrow morning. I’ll watch over him personally!”

“Alright!” Liu Qingfeng replied,”Mr. Xia, don’t you want to go back and rest for a while?”

“I’ll rest here in the warehouse. Get someone to send two camping beds over.” Xia ruofei said,”also, send more men to the periphery. Don’t let anyone get close to this warehouse.”

“Alright!” Liu Qingfeng said,”Mr. Xia, I’ll go back first.”

Liu Qingfeng could naturally see that Xia ruofei attached great importance to this batch of goods, and it seemed that he did not want more people to know about the situation of these goods, so he was very tactful. After Xia ruofei gave his orders, he immediately left.

The workers left after transporting the goods, so after Liu Qingfeng left, only Xia ruofei and Li Yifu were left in the warehouse.

“Disciple greets senior granduncle!” Li Yifu immediately greeted him respectfully.

“Mm! You’ve worked hard, foster husband. ” Xia ruofei said indifferently and continued to ask,”have you found all the materials I need?”

“It’s all here. I’ve even bought ten percent more than the amount on the list in case there’s a shortage of materials,” Li Yifu said.

Xia ruofei nodded. In fact, he had already considered this problem when he was making the list. He had added more of each material. However, Li Yifu did this out of responsibility, so Xia ruofei did not say anything else.

“You didn’t attract any attention when you bought these materials, did you?” he asked.

“Don’t worry, senior granduncle. ” Li Yifu smiled and said,”although it was a little rushed, I still didn’t buy it directly. Instead, I bought it anonymously through different agents and scattered it in several warehouses. Then, I sent people to gather it in the warehouses and put it in a unified box, so I came a little late.”

Xia ruofei nodded.”Very good. You’re indeed experienced and reliable. You’re so reliable!”

“Martial granduncle, you’re overpraising me.” Li Yifu said as he bowed slightly. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Xia ruofei said,”foster husband, this is an island I bought. It’s called Paradise Island. This Island is very important to me. It’s also very useful for your future cultivation.” I’ll need you here in the near future to carry out the island’s transformation plan. Is there any problem? Can you make arrangements for your own business?”

When Li Yifu heard that, he said without hesitation,””I have no problem with that! It’s my honor to be able to work for you. I basically don’t care about business anymore. When I was in the United States, I rarely asked about business, so it won’t affect me. Even if it does, how can a mere business be more important than martial granduncle’s matter?”

Xia ruofei nodded and casually set up a sound – proof formation.

Although Li Yifu’s knowledge of arrays was average, he could still feel the profoundness of the array that Xia ruofei had casually set up. He could also vaguely sense the function of the array.

Seeing Xia ruofei being so cautious, he couldn’t help but feel a chill in his heart. He asked,””Martial granduncle, do you have any secret matters to announce?”

Xia ruofei said indifferently,”adopted husband, I have to explain to you in detail about Paradise Island.” This Island and the surrounding seas and the environment form a natural formation called the Taixu xuanqing formation ...”

Xia ruofei briefly introduced the functions of the Taixu xuanqing formation to Li Yifu and said,””To put it simply, this is a natural formation at the level of a sect – protecting formation. And as far as I know, the sect – protecting formations of some cultivation sects on earth are far inferior to the Taixu xuanqing formation. Once the formation is activated, the Paradise Island will undoubtedly become a Holy Land for cultivation. At that time, even without the help of spirit crystals, the cultivation speed will be several times faster than normal. ”

After Li Yifu heard this, he was stunned as if he had been electrocuted. His mouth was wide open unknowingly. He was obviously shocked by the news.

“My adopted husband!” Xia ruofei called out with a frown.

Li Yifu came back to his senses and quickly said,””Senior granduncle, please forgive this disciple for losing my self – Control ... This disciple really didn’t expect that there would actually be such a blessed paradise.”

Xia ruofei said indifferently,”the work of nature is beyond the imagination of ordinary people. Before this, I didn’t dare to believe that there was a place that could form a natural formation like the Taixu xuanqing formation. However, it does exist. I have checked it carefully. It is indeed a natural formation. There are no traces of man – made things or any marks left by cultivators.”

Then, Xia ruofei changed the topic.””However, fortune may be the root of misfortune, and such a paradise may not necessarily be a good thing. If some sects in the cultivation world set their eyes on us, it’ll be very difficult for us to protect the Paradise Island with our current strength. Even with the help of the Taixu xuanqing formation, it’ll be difficult for us to resist the siege of those big sects. ”

“Martial granduncle, although this disciple’s cultivation is low, I’m willing to defend the Peach Blossom Island with my life!” Li Yifu said in an impassioned tone.

In his eyes, the Peach Blossom Island was the foundation of a sect. Although Xia ruofei had no intention of establishing a sect, Li Yifu felt that the relationship between him and Xia ruofei’s master had already formed the embryonic form of a sect. As the successor of Shanhai Zhenren, they had the obligation to develop the sect. With the Peach Blossom Island, all of this was possible.

If someone wanted to take the Peach Blossom Island, they would be snatching someone’s Foundation! No matter how strong the other party was, they had to fight them to the death!

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,””It’s not that serious. This is the South Pacific Ocean, and cultivators rarely appear in this Sea area. With the current situation of Paradise Island, even if cultivators who have studied arrays a little can’t see the Taixu xuanqing formation, they will definitely be able to detect the abnormality of this Island. Therefore, if cultivators often pass by this Sea area, the secret of Paradise Island would have been discovered a long time ago, and it wouldn’t have taken until today to ... Forget it, we’ll talk about this later! In any case, the situation isn’t too bad. ”

“I understand.” Li Yifu nodded and said.

“Once we successfully activate the array on the Peach Blossom Island, it will cover up the aura of the great array. At that time, even if a cultivator appears here, they basically won’t be able to detect any abnormalities unless they observe closely and touch the great array.” Xia ruofei said and then added,”even a cultivator in the original infant stage would find it hard to notice the abnormality if he didn’t look carefully.”

When Li Yifu heard this, he was immediately relieved. The cultivation world on earth was so withered that it was doubtful whether there were any nascent soul old monsters alive. Moreover, the South Pacific Ocean was too remote for the cultivation world. How could there be a nascent soul old monster here so coincidentally and even use spiritual power to investigate carefully?

In this case, the safety of the Paradise Island was still very high.

Li Yifu didn’t expect Xia ruofei to immediately change the topic and say,””I was planning to set up the Taixu xuanqing formation slowly, but do you know why I asked you to bring all the materials and come here as soon as possible?”

“I’m slow – witted, please enlighten me, senior granduncle,” Li Yifu bowed and said.

“The reason is very simple. Just yesterday, I have confirmed a piece of news. Our peach source Island has been discovered by a cultivation sect. They have set their eyes on this Island.” Xia ruofei said calmly,”of course, I can’t just hand the Paradise Island over to someone else. Therefore, there is only one choice in front of me, and that is to activate the Taixu xuanqing formation as soon as possible. Only then will we have a chance to fight against that cultivation sect.”
