Chapter 3414: The Vermillion Jade Fruit (2)

Translator: 549690339

Of course, scholar Yuntai knew that if an Aurous core stage cultivator put up a Yuan Qi barrier, they could go deep into the poisonous mist. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

However, this was definitely a very dangerous act. Once a small crack appeared on the protective shield, the poisonous mist would enter the protective shield. The cultivator only needed to take a breath, and his body would rot from the inside out. It would be a very miserable death.

Even if the protective shield did not crack, if they were to explore in the poisonous fog, and their mental strength was also greatly limited, they would basically die if they were to get lost in the fog. This was because a Yuan Qi protective shield naturally required Yuan Qi, and a cultivator’s yuan Qi couldn’t be unlimited. It would be used up eventually. This was especially true for cultivators in the Aurous core stage, who were of a lower cultivation level. The total amount of vital Qi they had was relatively low to begin with. Once it was exhausted, they would be in a situation where they would die without a doubt.

What master Yuntai didn’t know was that Xia ruofei’s vital Qi protective shield was much tougher than that of ordinary golden core stage cultivators. Under normal circumstances, it would not be broken. Not to mention, if he really returned to the cloud area, Xia ruofei would put on his EVA suit. Even if the vital Qi protective shield was broken, he could still use the EVA suit to buy some time. Sometimes, in just a few seconds, he could change the outcome.

As for the amount of vital Qi, with Xia ruofei’s current cultivation, it was impossible for him to fill up the bottomless pit. However, with the elemental storage Pearl, Xia ruofei’s vital Qi was many times more than that of an ordinary golden core stage cultivator. Naturally, he could maintain the vital Qi protective shield for a relatively long time.

Therefore, in the eyes of layman Yuntai, it was very dangerous to go down with the help of the yuan Qi protection.

However, he felt that Xia ruofei was confident because he was highly skilled and bold, so he did not say anything more.

Ling Qingxue saw Xia ruofei suddenly stop in his tracks and stand there in a daze, not making a sound for a long time. After waiting for a while, she could not help but ask curiously,””RUO Fei, what’s wrong?”

Xia ruofei then hurriedly informed scholar Yuntai, and then smiled at Ling Qingxue.'”‘! suddenly thought of something.”

“What is it?”

“We’ve dealt with the goldthread nether snake, but we haven’t collected the loot yet!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Did you receive the latest notification?” Ling Qingxue’s eyes brightened.”The reward for completing the sixth level of the trial Pagoda?”

“I haven’t seen the mission reward yet, but it doesn’t affect us from collecting the loot!” Xia ruofei said.

When Xia ruofei mentioned the spoils of war for the second time, Ling Qingxue finally reacted. She asked in confusion,””It’s not a mission reward? What kind of spoils are they?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”you’ve seen it too!” Let me give you a hint… Below, in the misty area …”

“You mean the two fruits?” Ling Qingxue suddenly understood.

“You’re right!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”let’s go! Let’s go down again and collect the spoils! We’ve already killed the goldthread nether snake, so there shouldn’t be any danger this time!”

Ling Qingxue hesitated for a moment before saying,””RUO Fei, we can’t bring anything out of this trial space…”

“I didn’t say I was going to bring it out!” Xia ruofei said as he took out his spacesuit and started to put it on.”Why don’t we just eat it? Have you forgotten about the yellow jade essence?”

“Directly eat it?” Ling Qingxue exclaimed,”we don’t even know if the fruit is edible! And … That fragrance is really too strong, and it can even lure people to go there without caring about their own safety. I feel… That fruit is a little strange! We’d better be careful!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”don’t worry!” That was a genuine spiritual fruit, and eating it would only bring benefits and no harm! If you don’t take what the heavens give you, you’ll get your retribution!”

Ling Qingxue had always had blind trust in Xia ruofei. Seeing that Xia ruofei was so certain, she naturally dispelled her doubts. She smiled and said,””Since you’re so sure, let’s go down!”

“Let’s go!”

After Xia ruofei finished speaking, he took Ling Qingxue’s hand and walked to the side of the rope. Then, the two of them stepped onto the qushuang flying sword hand in hand.

In the majestic hall of the mysterious space enshrouded in purple mist, the elder in the green Daoist robe had seen the entire process of Xia ruofei killing the goldthread nether snake through the mirror in front of him. He had even seen the situation in the nine – turn space splitting formation clearly.

When Xia ruofei and the goldthread nether snake met face to face, it could be said that he was in a precarious situation at the beginning.

However, Xia ruofei made use of the difference in the flow of time between the spirit map space and the outside world. With the addition of the time array flags, he had won a lot of time. He used this time to successfully prepare the nine turn space splitting formation and turned the situation around. He killed the goldthread nether snake easily.

The green – robed elder saw all of this.

When the huge body of the goldthread nether snake fell to the ground, the green – robed elder couldn’t help but stroke his beard and praise,””Sharp eyes! Meticulous as a hair! To forcefully turn the situation around in a near – hopeless situation, and to have such high attainments in the array Dao and spatial aspects, this little doll was really not bad! To be able to do it so perfectly at the Aurous core stage, it seems that brother mountain and river’s spirit map world was not entrusted to the wrong person…”

The green – robed elder didn’t notice Xia ruofei’s conversation with master Yuntai.

After all, the two of them were communicating through spiritual power, and the level of the spirit map scroll was extremely high. Even if the elder in the green Daoist robe used the mirror, he couldn’t see the situation inside the space. Not to mention that layman Yuntai was living in the mysterious ore space in the state of a spirit, so it was even more impossible for the elder to detect it.

When Xia ruofei pulled Ling Qingxue along to collect the “spoils of war,” the green – robed elder could not help but smile bitterly. He muttered to himself,””It seems that I can’t keep the two Vermillion Jade fruits … This little kid’s eyes are really sharp! You even know about the Vermilion Jade Fruit? could it be recorded in the ancient records left behind by brother mountain and river?”

Xia ruofei naturally didn’t know that his every move was being watched by the green – robed elder.

He and Ling Qingxue rode on the flying sword and went down.

The last time she went down, Xia ruofei had to climb the rope for safety reasons. Now that the golden thread nether snake had been killed, the greatest danger on the cliff had been eliminated. Hence, Xia ruofei decided to fly down on his sword.

Of course, he was still going down along the rope. His purpose was to prevent any unexpected situations from happening. When the time came, he could still use the rope to borrow strength.

Very quickly, Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue reached the end of the rope. Below them was the rising clouds. If they had not experienced it and seen it with their own eyes, Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue would not have believed it. This seemingly ordinary cloud was actually highly toxic and corrosive.

Without another word, Xia ruofei activated his Yuan Qi barrier and communicated with Ling Qingxue with his eyes. Then, the two of them rode their flying swords and entered the misty area.

The poisonous fog was pushed away by the yuan Qi barrier. Not even a single wisp of the poisonous fog could reach within three meters of Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue.

Xia ruofei immediately controlled his flying sword and flew down the same path that he had taken earlier.

Since they had chosen to fly on their flying swords this time, and they were more familiar with the route than before, the two of them descended much faster than before. In a short while, Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue arrived not far from the Vermillion Jade Fruit tree.

In fact, after descending for a while, they could smell the unique fragrance of the Vermilion Jade Fruit again. However, Xia ruofei already knew that it was the unique fragrance of the Vermilion Jade Fruit, so he was not nervous and did not hold his breath.

Xia ruofei stood on the bent Frost Flying sword and looked at the Vermillion Jade Fruit tree in front of him.. He laughed and said,'”‘Qingxue! Our spoils look really delicious!”
