3172 The nation’s treasure (2)

Translator: 5496903The signature was “Xia ruofei”. Any fan of Xia ruofei would be familiar with it.

Xia ruofei carefully dried the ink and put the card into the Jade skin cream box. Then, he stood up and handed it to Deputy Director Wei.

Deputy Director Wei took the heavy gift with both hands and said with a grateful expression,””President Xia, thank you so much!”

He had seen the two sentences that Xia ruofei had written. He was sure that these simple and honest words would be a great encouragement to his daughter.

Of course, his daughter was also quite well – behaved, so he didn’t have to worry too much about her academic performance.

But who wouldn’t want their own children to be better?

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it’s nothing. You’re welcome, director Wei!”

Deputy Director Wei thought for a while and asked carefully,”By the way, President Xia, can I take a picture with you?”

After he finished, he immediately explained,””Our Supercomputing Center is a secret unit. Under normal circumstances, family members are not allowed in. I’m helping my daughter fulfill her wish ...”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. It was rare to see someone helping their daughter chase a star.

However, Deputy Director Wei’s request was not too much, so Xia ruofei naturally would not reject it. He smiled and nodded.”Of course, no problem! However, your Center is a confidential unit ...”

“Oh, oh! The hall was fine! It’s mainly because the management of the computer room is more strict!” Deputy Chief Wei quickly said,”confidentiality management is also divided into regions! We can use our phones outside the computer room!”

After he finished speaking, Deputy Director Wei took out his phone, unlocked and opened the camera, and handed it to Ling Qingxue.””Can I trouble you to help me take a photo with President Xia?”

Ling Qingxue giggled and said,”no problem!” I love to help others! President Xia, quickly smile! This is a photo for your fans to see!”

Xia ruofei looked at Ling Qingxue helplessly and showed a smile.

Deputy Director Wei quickly stood beside Xia ruofei. He looked a little reserved, but the overall photo – taking effect was not bad.

Xia ruofei even saw Song Wei taking a photo from a similar angle as Ling Qingxue.

“Thank you! Thank you!” Deputy Director Wei held Xia ruofei’s hand tightly and expressed his sincere gratitude.

“You’re welcome, director Wei!”Xia ruofei smiled.

“By the way, director Xia, I’ll show you around the computer room!” Director Wei quickly said. That’s the core of our Supercomputing Center!”

“Alright! I’ve long admired the famous light of Taihu territory, which is an important weapon of the country! It’s my honor to be able to see its true appearance in person!” Xia ruofei said.

Therefore, Deputy Director Wei brought Xia ruofei and the other two to the elevator and went to the third floor. The famous supercomputer, the light of Taihu territory, was located on this floor.

Such an important weapon of the country was naturally heavily guarded.

First of all, the elevator to the computer room floor required a card. If it wasn’t for Deputy Director Wei’s card, Xia ruofei and the others wouldn’t have been able to take the elevator up.

Naturally, the three – story staircase was also one – way locked. It would not affect the escape in an emergency, but it could prevent others from entering this important floor from the stairs.

After getting out of the elevator, they also had to face heavy inspections when they entered the computer room. Moreover, mobile phones were not allowed to be brought into the computer room. They had to be left outside and placed in a metal – shielded cabinet.

The people brought by Deputy Director Wei were no exception.

He took the three of their identification cards and went to register the visitors personally.

Xia ruofei and the rest took out their phones and were about to put them away.

At this moment, Xia ruofei heard a WeChat notification ring on his phone. He picked it up and saw that it was a message from Song Wei.

Xia ruofei could not help but turn to look at Song Wei. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“I’ll send you the photo I took just now!”Song Wei said with a smile.

“Oh!” Xia ruofei unlocked his phone and opened WeChat.

Sure enough, Song Wei had sent him the photo of him and Deputy Director Wei in the living room. The words “new Wu Supercomputer Center” could be seen on the wall behind them.

Xia ruofei looked at the photo. He and Deputy Director Wei both had pretty good expressions. They didn’t frown or close their eyes, so this photo was definitely up to standard.

He remembered that he hadn’t updated his Weibo for a while. Also, Deputy Director Wei had just said that the lobby downstairs wasn’t a secret area. Since the photos could be taken with an internet phone, they could naturally be posted online.

Those celebrities would have to choose from many photos and Photoshop them. Xia ruofei naturally did not need that.

After he started cultivating, his skin was so good that even girls would be envious of it. As for wrinkles and dark circles, they naturally wouldn’t appear on his face.

Moreover, his figure was also quite standard, and he had a trace of the unique temperament of a cultivator. He was naturally quite good, so there was no need to Photoshop it!

Hence, Xia ruofei saved the original picture and opened the Weibo app. After adding the picture, he wrote a few words:

Today, I was fortunate enough to visit new Wu’s National Supercomputer Center and see the world’s top national treasure, the “divine power” light of Taihu territory. I only have five words to say,”the” divine power “is amazing, my country!”

After checking the grammar and typos, Xia ruofei pressed the “publish” button.

Xia ruofei didn’t care what kind of discussion his new Weibo post would cause. After he posted, he put his phone back into the signal cabinet and put the key in his pocket.

The cell phone cabinet was divided into many small grids, and each grid had its own door. After putting the cell phone in it, it could be locked separately and the key could be kept by itself.

At this time, Deputy Director Wei had also completed the procedures. He walked over and locked his phone in the screen cabinet. Then, he smiled and said,””President Xia, you’ve been waiting for a long time, you can go in now! Please come in!”

Under the guidance of Deputy Director Wei, Xia ruofei and the other two changed into their shoe covers at the door and entered the computer room that housed the light of Taihu territory.

Deputy Director Wei explained,”director Xia, this computer room is 605 square meters in total. There are 20 computer cabinets and storage cabinets on both sides of the front. The row in the middle is the network system cabinet ...”

Xia ruofei looked in the direction of Deputy Director Wei’s finger and said in surprise,””The famous light of Taihu territory only takes up so little space?”

Deputy Director Wei laughed and said,””Household laptops these days are already super ultra thin and small, and some tablets are even more portable to the extreme. The divine power engine light of Taihu territory is also a computer in essence! It’s already very exaggerated to occupy such a large room!”

“That’s true ...” Xia ruofei said as he watched.

Deputy Director Wei brought Xia ruofei and the others to a cabinet and said loudly through the metal grid,””This is our computer cabinet!”

The noise was very loud when he got close to the equipment cabinet, so Deputy Director Wei couldn’t help but increase his voice.

Deputy Director Wei pointed at the cabinet in front of him, which was slightly larger than a double – door domestic refrigerator, and said,””Mr. Xia, each cabinet has four super – node units. Each super – node unit is made up of 32 computing plug – ins, and each computing plug – in contains four computing node boards. Each computing node has two high – performance ‘Shenwei 26010’ processors!”

Xia ruofei calculated silently and said,””Director Wei, does this mean that this equipment cabinet alone has 1024 processors?”

“Yes, I am!” Deputy Director Wei said,”there are a total of 40 equipment cabinets like this!”

...

“That’s a total of 40960 processors!” Xia ruofei was speechless.

“That’s right!”Deputy Chief Wei nodded. President Xia, this ‘Shenwei 26010’ processor is a processor that was completely independently developed by our country after the UA issued a chip ban on United States! Each processor has 260 cores ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and did some quick calculations. He then said,””That is to say, right now, in front of us, is actually a computer with 10649600 cores! Am I right?”
