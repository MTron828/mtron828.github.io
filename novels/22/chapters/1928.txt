Chapter 1929 A bolt out of the blue (2)

What Xu Yougang was worried about did not happen. Fang Chenchen just sat on the ground quietly with a blank expression. She did not even look at Liu haojun, who was lying beside her like a dead dog.

Soon, the ambulance arrived at the neighborhood. The medical staff carried Liu haojun into the elevator on a stretcher and sent him to the ambulance. Fang Chenchen had to follow the ambulance, so Room 1902 was empty.

Xu Yougang immediately picked up the walkie – talkie and said,””Dong Liang, you can go and clean up ...”

“Understood!” Wang Chong said crisply.

Wang Chong walked down the stairs and headed straight for unit 1902.

Although Da Liu had already used the Tesla coil to reset the fingerprint lock’s system, allowing any fingerprint to easily open the door, Wang Chong did not choose to do so. He did not want his fingerprints to be recorded by the fingerprint lock.

Thus, Wang Chong chose the same method as Xu Yougang’s when he first came to unit 1902. He used a metal wire to insert into the hidden lock hole at the bottom of the fingerprint lock control panel. After a few tries, the fingerprint lock, which was said to have excellent security features, was easily unlocked.

Wang Chong entered the room and quickly closed the door.

He was here to retrieve the monitoring equipment, mainly to avoid leaving any traces. Once Liu haojun came back to his senses and sent someone here to carry out a blanket inspection, the monitoring equipment would definitely be exposed. Although it might not involve Xu Yougang and the others, it was naturally safer to be more cautious in such matters.

Moreover, the equipment was very advanced and expensive. They could be used for similar missions in the future.

Wang Chong was very clear on the location of every micro camera and eavesdropping device. Xu You had just drawn a rough sketch for him. In addition, he had seen surveillance footage of his rented apartment more than once, so it wasn’t difficult for him to deduce the exact location of the cameras.

Wang Chong deftly removed the surveillance cameras and monitoring devices from the living room and bedroom, and then quickly restored them to their original state.

Xu Yougang watched the image on the computer screen shake a few times before it disappeared completely. After a while, he could not hear the voice in the headphones anymore.

Following which, Wang Chong’s voice sounded from the walkie – talkie.”Boss, it’s done. I’ll come back now?”

“Okay, be careful!” Xu Yougang said.

……

Provincial television station, Haixi satellite TV.

After Liu Yuan’s interview team returned, the first thing they did was to export the material they had just taken to the computer. Then, Liu Yuan personally sat in front of the computer and began editing.

As a reporter, it was far from enough to just show off in front of the camera and write a few articles that did not hurt.

The pace of work in the media industry was very fast, and there was never enough manpower, so reporters were multi – talented. Basically, every reporter could do things like video editing, but their proficiency was different.

Liu Yuan’s work efficiency was very high, and she quickly edited a news video that was more than three minutes long. Then, she went to the recording room to record a few narration and synthesized the audio track into the news video. This was basically the finished product.

Liu Yuan sent the news video to the review stage, then called the editor on duty and asked him to review it quickly and add it to the live news at 10 O’ clock tonight.

The editor on duty read it a few times seriously and didn’t find any problems.

The whole news was very clear, and the tone was very objective. In addition, the parties involved had a thin mosaic on their faces, so it basically did not constitute a violation of privacy.

Thus, the editor on duty immediately marked it as approved, and the news video would be automatically pushed to the Deputy editor on duty tonight.

The Deputy editor – in – chief on duty was in the office. When he heard the notification from the review platform, he immediately opened it to take a look.

The news was quite normal, but there was a lot of truth to it. The Deputy editor read it back and forth a few times, but he didn’t see any content that violated national policies. Even the privacy of the parties involved was well protected.

Therefore, the on – duty deputy editor – in – chief immediately gave this news video a mark of approval. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

At the same time, the Deputy editor – in – chief on duty also commented on the manuscript in the review platform,”The evening news program will include this social news in the urban intelligence station segment. In addition, the new media Group can push it on Weibo in advance.

Just like that, Haixi satellite TV’s official Weibo posted the news video on the Weibo platform five minutes after the on – duty Deputy Chief editor’s final approval.

Moreover, the evening news program, which would start live in ten minutes, would also broadcast this news.

……

At the emergency department of the provincial Hospital.

Liu haojun woke up from the pain again when the orthopedist who came for consultation was setting his bones.

What happened at the West Lake Mansion was like a nightmare.

However, the pain all over his body, especially the piercing pain in his leg, told him that it was not a nightmare, but something that had really happened.

Liu haojun knew that he had been sent to the hospital when he saw the busy people in white coats beside him.

He struggled to search his body for his phone. The doctor Who was working immediately frowned and said,””If you don’t want to be in pain again, don’t move! And then the bones were dislocated!”

Liu haojun was so scared that he quickly lay down obediently, but his eyes were still looking around.

‘Old Zhou has already returned to Changping. I wonder if Fang Chenchen has informed him ...’ Liu haojun thought.

His heart was filled with anger, and he secretly swore that he would make the hooligan who broke his leg pay a painful price.

However, no matter how much he gritted his teeth, he could only lie on the medical bed without moving.

After the orthopedist treated his fracture, he put a thick cast on his leg. Then, the doctor from the emergency department came to help him deal with the trauma. In addition to the fracture on his leg, he was also beaten and kicked by Da Liu’s underlings for a few minutes. There were bruises all over his body, and he was in a very sorry state.

After a full 30 to 40 minutes, the doctor was done. He left Liu haojun behind, pulled open the curtain of the emergency treatment room, and walked out.

Fang Chenchen was sitting on a bench outside. When she saw the doctor come out, she quickly stood up and went to him.

“Are you the patient’s family?” The doctor asked.

Fang Chenchen had a complicated look in her eyes. She nodded and asked,””Doctor, how’s the situation?”

“His leg is fractured, and he has many external injuries.” The doctor asked,”do you need us to call the police?”

“No need, no need!” Fang Chenchen said quickly.

The doctor nodded. Since the patient didn’t plan to call the police, they didn’t want to interfere. If Yingying had been shot, the hospital would call the police immediately. There was no need to force her to do so.

The doctor said,”we’ve already taken care of the external injuries. His most serious injury is a fracture in his leg, so I’ve arranged for him to be transferred to the orthopedics department for follow – up treatment. Go and settle the procedures. In addition, deposit 10000 Yuan in advance for the medical expenses!”

“Okay, thank you, doctor!” Fang Chenchen said.

At this moment, Liu haojun, who was in the emergency treatment room, also heard the noise outside. He could not help but call out,””Chenchen! Come in for a moment ...”

Fang Chenchen quickly greeted the doctor and walked in quickly.

There were many people coming and going in the emergency department. Liu haojun asked in a low voice with a gloomy face,””Is it your husband who came today?”

Fang Chenchen nodded her head lightly, her expression exceptionally bleak.

“And those hooligans, did your husband call them over?” Liu haojun asked hatefully,”I’ll definitely make them regret being born into this world! Have you informed old Zhou?”

“Not yet ...” Fang Chenchen replied in a low voice.

“Motherf * cker! I’ll make the call myself!” Liu haojun asked,”where’s my phone? Hurry and give it to me ...”

Fang Chenchen was worried about Liu Dong when she saw how Liu haojun was gritting his teeth in anger.

However, she thought of something even more serious and quickly said,””Jun bro, when you ... When you were unconscious ... A bunch of reporters from the TV station came to our house ...”

Liu haojun’s expression changed drastically, and he cried out,””What? Can you repeat that?”
