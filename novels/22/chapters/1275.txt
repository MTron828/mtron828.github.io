Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”Didn’t I tell you yesterday?” I will do my best to restore the star of Hong Kong! Since he had fully recovered, he had to be able to meet the competition’s standards and his level of competition hadn’t dropped! But I wasn’t so sure yesterday, but now that I’ve seen the effect of the treatment, I’m even more confident. ”

Guo Hongjiang was so excited that he was incoherent.”This ... This is really ... Mr. Xia, to be honest, I didn’t even have confidence in its recovery at first. After seeing your medical skills, I thought that it would be fine as long as it could recover. I could keep taking care of it ... I didn’t even think about it playing in the game ...”

Xia ruofei laughed.”Director Guo, you can think about it now. I think there’s still a good chance!”

Guo Hongjiang nodded and said,”thank you so much, Mr. Xia!” If it wasn’t for your insistence, the star of Hong Kong would have been euthanized last night ...”

Speaking of this, Guo Hongjiang couldn’t help but look at the “star of Hong Kong” again. He was also afraid.

Xia ruofei smiled.”It’s not considered a successful treatment yet. The specific results will depend on the treatment effect over the next two days.” By the way, director Guo, have you prepared the herbs I need?”

“I’ve prepared everything. I’ll get them to buy more if the amount isn’t enough!”Guo Hongjiang quickly said. Mr. Xia, let’s have breakfast first! I’ll get someone to send the herbs over later!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes!” It was better to hurry! It’s not a good idea to keep the star of Hong Kong tied up like this, I want to put it down as soon as possible. ”

“Will untying the rope ...” Guo Hongjiang asked worriedly.

“Of course, I will only undo it when I’m confident.” Xia ruofei smiled.”Otherwise, wouldn’t all the work before be in vain?”

“Yes, yes, yes. This Mr. Xia must have a well – thought – out plan. I won’t say anything more.” Guo Hongjiang laughed.

He stood up and said,”Mr. Xia, please have your breakfast first. I’ll have someone send the herbs over later. I still have a few documents to deal with. I won’t disturb you any longer, Mr. Xia.”

Although Guo Hongjiang was at the horse training base, there were many documents coming and going every day for such a large Real Estate Group, many of which needed him to make the final decision, so there was no way to hide here.

In fact, he had a lot of other work in addition to dealing with documents. He was the backbone of the entire group. His schedule was almost full this morning. At least four or five groups of senior executives of the group had to come to report their work. It was almost the same as going back to work.

“Please help yourself, director Guo!” Xia ruofei stood up and said.

The staff quickly sent breakfast over. Not long after Xia ruofei finished eating, the Chinese medicine he needed was also sent over.

Guo Hongjiang was worried that the quantity would not be enough, so he bought a lot of each medicinal herb and piled them in the corner of the room.

After everyone had left, Xia ruofei locked the door and smiled at the ‘star of Hong Kong’.””Alright, I’ll untie you now, but you have to be good. You can only stay in the room for the next two days.”

The “star of Hong Kong” seemed to understand Xia ruofei’s words and obediently lowered his eyes.

Xia ruofei laughed and quickly untied the rope.

The “star of Hong Kong” obediently came down from the shelf. Without Xia ruofei’s order, he stood quietly in the room and snorted from time to time.

If the trainer of the “star of Hong Kong” saw this scene, he would be shocked by the wild nature of the horse. Other than the trainer and the cavalrymen who were with it all the time, it was very difficult for strangers to get close to it.

Xia ruofei picked out the herbs he needed and started to boil the medicine. Although the star of Hong Kong had almost fully recovered, he still had to apply the medicine every day.

Moreover, this ointment could also consolidate the healing effect. After all, the bone injury had just healed, and compared to before, the broken parts were definitely not as strong as before.

For the next two days, Xia ruofei stayed in the house with the “star of Hong Kong” during the day. At night, after resting, he would send him into the spirit map space at the beginning stage. He would make use of the difference in the flow of time and the rich spiritual Qi to further restore his condition.

For three consecutive nights, the ‘star of Hong Kong’ had stayed in the Archean realm for about a month.

Other than the fact that his leg injury had completely healed, his spirituality was also much stronger than before.

Although it was not as good as little black and the others, it could quickly understand some simple instructions. As long as the language was not particularly complicated, it could basically understand it.

The “star of Hong Kong” was probably the smartest horse in the world.

Guo Hongjiang had probably specifically instructed that no one would come and disturb Xia ruofei as long as he locked the door, day or night.

Hence, from the next day, Xia ruofei no longer kept the title of “star of Hong Kong” on the shelf.

Xia ruofei had also concocted the medicinal herbs that Guo Hongjiang had sent into ointment for bruises and injuries. Except for a small portion for the “star of Hong Kong”, he had kept the rest in his interspace. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

As for the useless herbs that were used to confuse the judgment, Xia ruofei also randomly picked some and mixed them with the original dregs. This way, even if someone found the dregs, they would not be able to analyze and restore his prescription.
