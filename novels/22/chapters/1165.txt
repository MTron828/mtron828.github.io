Chapter 1166: As if three autumns had passed (2)

Translator: 549690339

Ling Xiaotian asked about Xia ruofei’s business trip to the capital.

Xia ruofei felt a little guilty for no reason, but he had a strong mentality and did not show any unnatural expression. He quickly talked about the search for the spokesperson.

“So, your new product is going to be on the market soon?” Ling Xiaotian asked as he took a sip of wine.

“Mm! The approval process is almost complete. ” Xia ruofei said,”the advertisement is also in the process of post – production, probably in the next one or two weeks! We’re going to hold a new product launch in Beijing! Because our spokesperson will be joining the crew soon, we won’t be coming back to San Shan!”

“The capital is not bad either!” Ling Qingxue interjected,”there are a lot of media there, and they have a lot of influence.”

“RUO Fei is the best!” Ling Xiaotian said with some emotion,”it’s only been a year, and you’ve already made the company so impressive. You’re producing one fist product after another!”

“How could I dare to call myself powerful in front of you!” Xia ruofei replied humbly,”you’ve been in the business world for decades. You’ve crossed more bridges than we have walked!”

“Hahaha! You really know how to talk, kid!” Ling Xiaotian said,”come, come, come. Let’s have another one!”

......

After more than an hour, Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue gently closed the door to Ling Xiaotian’s bedroom and walked away quietly.

Back on the second floor, Ling Qingxue grabbed Xia ruofei’s ear and said,””Xia ruofei, you’re really something! He drank too much as soon as he came back! He’s getting on in years, if he drinks too much, I won’t let you off!”

Xia ruofei quickly begged for mercy,”let it go, let it go ... Weren’t we happy this afternoon?” I didn’t drink much ...”

“Not much?” Ling Qingxue raised her eyebrows and said,”you two drank two and a half catties of white wine! Do you think my dad is the god of wine? Didn’t you see that he was struggling to walk in the end?”

“But I’ve also been drinking a lot.” Xia ruofei said,”I drank at least half of it!”

“Can my dad be compared to you?” Ling Qingxue didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.”How old is he? how old are you? and your body is as strong as a bull. You won’t get drunk even if you drink another 500 grams!”

“Hehe, so you know that I’m physically strong?” Xia ruofei looked at Ling Qingxue and chuckled.”If I don’t get our dad drunk, how can we have our own space?”

Xia ruofei even raised his eyebrows at Ling Qingxue.

Ling Qingxue’s face turned red, and her heart started to beat faster.

She glared at Xia ruofei and said,””I knew you had bad intentions.”

“How could I not have good intentions?” Xia ruofei turned around and looked at Ling Qingxue.

Ling Qingxue took a step back subconsciously. Behind her was the wall of the corridor. Xia ruofei immediately leaned closer to her and put his hand on the wall to push her.

Xia ruofei moved his face close to Ling Qingxue’s ear and said,””I’m being very kind! We haven’t seen each other for so many days, don’t you miss me?”

Ling Qingxue’s face heated up and she said in a low voice,””Don’t ... The housekeeper hasn’t left yet!”

“She’s on the first floor, she can’t hear you!” As Xia ruofei spoke, he held Ling Qingxue’s hand and lifted her up by the waist when she was not prepared.

As Ling Qingxue exclaimed in shock, Xia ruofei chuckled.””Let’s go to your room and see if I’m doing this out of good intentions!”

With that, Xia ruofei carried Ling Qingxue, opened the door to her room, and strode in.

......

More than an hour later, the low, blood – curdling singing in Ling Qingxue’s room finally stopped.

Ling Qingxue snuggled into Xia ruofei’s arms and said shyly,””You’re getting worse and worse. You actually ... Got my dad drunk because of this ...”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”I told you. I was too happy to see my father – in – Law. I accidentally drank too much!”

“You think I don’t know what you’re thinking?” Ling Qingxue pouted and glanced at Xia ruofei.

“Hehe, wife, don’t be so hung up on this!” Xia ruofei said,”I even brought you a gift!”

“Really! Where is he?” Ling Qingxue immediately asked,”why didn’t you take it out just now?”

“You’re really funny. How can I think of anything else when I’m facing such a delicate and beautiful woman like you?” Xia ruofei said.

“Virtue!” Ling Qingxue rolled her eyes.

Then, she stretched out her long legs and gently touched Xia ruofei.””What are you doing? Didn’t you say you brought a gift? Hurry up and get it!”

“Oh, right, right, right, wait a minute!” After Xia ruofei finished speaking, he jumped off the bed, naked. Ling Qingxue could not help but blush again.

Xia ruofei started to search through the clothes that were scattered on the ground.

Of course, in reality, he was only using his back to block Ling Qingxue’s line of sight. Then, he took out a protective Jade Leaf from his space and held it in his hand.

“Clang clang clang! Do you like it?” Xia ruofei walked to the bed and asked.

Ling Qingxue’s eyes widened when she saw the lifelike Jade Leaf. She said in surprise,””What a beautiful jade pendant! RUO Fei, did you buy this especially for me?” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Xia ruofei’s eyelids twitched when he heard the word ‘specialized’.

This really wasn’t “specialized.” He had prepared quite a few! Furthermore, he had already given Lu You and song Rui one each.
