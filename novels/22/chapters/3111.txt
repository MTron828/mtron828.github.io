  Xia ruofei didn't say anything. He just stared at Chen Xuan quietly.

  The office was extremely quiet. Chen Xuan felt that the atmosphere was a little strange. He could not help but look at Xia ruofei and asked,""Chairman, I wonder what instructions you have for me?"

  Xia ruofei slowly revealed a smile, but he did not answer Chen Xuan's question. Instead, he asked,""You haven't been at the three mountains for long, have you? What was his impression of the city of San Shan? How do you feel about the Paradise Corporation?"

  Chen Xuan pondered for a moment before replying,"the three mountains border the ocean. At the same time, it's also situated beside a mountain and a River. The degree of greenery here is one of the best among all the provincial capital cities in the country. Naturally, it's a very livable city. It's not bad to live here."

  Chen Xuan was lying through his teeth. In reality, in the eyes of cultivators, it didn't matter how good the natural environment was. With the current state of the spiritual energy, the three mountains were definitely not a place to live in.

  "As for paradise Corporation ..." Chen Xuan did not notice Xia ruofei's half - Smile and continued,"the feeling it gives me is ... Everyone is very energetic and motivated. Everyone in the company seems to be full of energy. I think everyone's happiness and sense of achievement should be very strong, definitely better than most companies. "

  Xia ruofei nodded and said,"that's an objective assessment, but ... Do you really think the three mountains is a good place to live?" Brother Chen!"

  Chen Xuan was stunned. The way Xia ruofei addressed him had changed, which confused him. At the same time, he felt a strange sense of familiarity.

  Before Chen Xuan could react, Xia ruofei continued,""Brother Chen, could it be that the first heaven society's food isn't good? Why did you suddenly come to my small place to make a living?"

  This time, Xia ruofei used the voice he used when he moved as Xia Tian.

  To a cultivator, changing one's voice was a simple matter. All they had to do was to use true energy or vital energy to slightly change the shape and position of their vocal cords. Xia ruofei was already very familiar with the position of Xia Tian's voice, so he could easily produce Xia Tian's voice.

  Chen Xuan was taken aback as a look of disbelief appeared in his eyes. After a long while, he cried out,""Brother Xia? You're brother Xia Tian?"

  Before Chen Xuan could scream, Xia ruofei had already set up a soundproof barrier.

  At the same time, he began to change his appearance right in front of Chen Xuan. In the blink of an eye, he had taken on Xia Tian's appearance. Chen Xuan had witnessed the entire process. His entire being was like a clay sculpture with his mouth wide open. He did not have the demeanor of the young master of the number one sect at all. However, he was completely oblivious to it.

  When Xia ruofei asked yang Xincheng to call Chen Xuan up for a private conversation, he had elders who were not as strong as Chen Xuan could not stop Xia ruofei.

  Unless they hid in the sect and did not come out, it would be easy for Xia ruofei to deal with them.

  Hence, Xia ruofei had no intention of playing hide - and - seek anymore. He decided to confront Chen Xuan face to face and see what the heavenly sect was up to.

meet again so soon, and in such a setting ... I think brother Chen must have a lot to say to me! You can start now, I'm all ears!"

  When Chen Xuan saw Xia ruofei's cold expression, he suddenly came back to his senses.

  Even though he had no idea why his father had sent him here to train, the moment he saw Xia ruofei in Xia Tian's appearance, he immediately understood many things. At the same time, he began to change his appearance in front of Chen Xuan. In the blink of an eye, he had taken on Xia Tian's appearance. Chen Xuan had witnessed the entire process.

  When Xia ruofei asked yang Xincheng to call Chen Xuan up for a private conversation, he had already made up his mind. He didn't intend to hide anything from Chen Xuan. Instead, he was going to get straight to the point and ask him directly.

  If the first heaven society really wanted to deal with him, he wouldn't be afraid.

  His greatest reliance was naturally not the peach blossom company, nor was it the star Seizer sect, but the Peach Blossom Island that he managed well, as well as the spirit map and painting scroll hidden in his palm.

  Perhaps the Paradise Corporation would suffer heavy losses, and even his close friends would be in danger. However, once Xia ruofei decided to go all out, he naturally could not care so much.

  If the first heaven society really dared to target ordinary people, they would have to be prepared for Xia ruofei's crazy revenge.

  Xia ruofei might not be able to kill Chen Nanfeng, and even Chen Xuan might not be able to kill him. After all, as the young sect master of the first heaven society, Chen Xuan had many life - saving treasures on him.

  However, the Qi refining disciples of the first heaven society and even a few early golden core elders who were not as strong as Chen Xuan could not stop Xia ruofei.

  Unless they hid in the sect and did not come out, it would be easy for Xia ruofei to deal with them. Hence, Xia ruofei had no intention of playing hide - and - seek anymore. He decided to confront Chen Xuan face to face and see what the heavenly sect was up to.

  When Xia ruofei's appearance was Xia Tian 's, Chen Xuan was stunned.

  Xia ruofei had a faint smile on his face and continued,""Brother Chen, I didn't expect that we would meet again so soon, and in such a setting ... I think brother Chen must have a lot to say to me! You can start now, I'm all ears!"

  When Chen Xuan saw Xia ruofei's cold expression, he suddenly came back to his senses.

  Although he still did not know why his father had sent him here to train, the moment he saw Xia ruofei turn into Xia Tian, he suddenly understood many things ...
