2475 Invitation to invest (2)

Zhao Yongjun couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows.

Even though he did not know much about football, as Zhou leiyun’s friend, he had an impression of the acquisition.

“Brother Zhou, if I remember correctly, you only have about 50% of the shares in that team, right?” Zhao asked.

“That’s right. We spent more than 60 million euros and got about 54% of the shares!”Zhou leiyun said with a smile.

Zhao Yongjun couldn’t help but ask,”that’s just past the holding line! If you give some of your shares away, you won’t be able to have absolute control of the company, right? Don’t tell me that glory world Corporation is short of money! This isn’t funny at all ...”

For the scale of shengshi group, tens of millions of euros was nothing. If the group was in financial difficulties, even if they sold all of the Spanish shares, it would not be enough.

Zhou leiyun chuckled.”We’re all on the same side. What’s the difference between giving the shares to you and keeping them in my hands?” Besides, we can sign an agreement to act together! If you trust me, you can just give me the voting rights. I can still have absolute control!”

“That’s true ...” Zhao Yongjun shrugged,”but I’m not interested in that! I don’t know much about football, and after investing in Paradise Club, my funds are a little tight, so I’ll forget about investing in a Football Club. You can ask ruofei, this guy is also a small nouveau riche!”

Zhou leiyun himself did not put this small investment project in his heart. He made this suggestion only because he wanted to get closer to Zhao Yong Jun and Xia ruofei, and at the same time, he wanted to mend the rift created by Zhou Yuan.

Hence, Zhou leiyun replied without hesitation,””It doesn’t matter if you don’t have money for now! I’ll give you some dry shares ...”

“Don ‘t!” Zhao Yongjun waved his hand and said,”brother Zhou, I’ve never done something that’s not worth it. I’m really not interested.”

Although Zhao Yongjun didn’t really watch football, he knew that investing in football was slow and that it needed to continue burning money. Besides, it didn’t conform to his principles to take dry shares without investing money, so he firmly rejected it.

Xia ruofei did not show much interest, but since Zhou leiyun was so enthusiastic, he could not reject him directly. He asked,””Director Zhou, how many shares do you plan to sell?”

Zhou leiyun smiled and said,”that will depend on how interested you are, CEO Xia. Since brave army is not interested, we can split it equally. Of course, if you want less, that’s fine too. Anyway, we’re just throwing in some money to play.”

Xia ruofei looked pensive. He did not want to reject Zhou leiyun’s suggestion so quickly. He also needed to think about what to say to reject Zhou leiyun’s suggestion.

At that moment, Zhou leiyun revealed a mysterious look and said,””President Xia, it’s not a bad idea to invest in RCD Espanyol now! We’re going to make a big move in the transfer market soon!”

“Oh?” Xia ruofei was also curious. He smiled and asked,”director Zhou, have you taken a fancy to some world – Class star player? Could it be that the Spaniards are planning to do something big at the winter window?”

Zhou leiyun chuckled and said,”I don’t have any world – Class star players. My philosophy in running this team is not the kind of money – burning, I still want to play steadily and steadily, and the water flows slowly. However, for China, this transfer might cause as much of a stir as buying a superstar!”

“Is that so?” Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows and said,”so ... CEO Zhou is getting our Chinese players to join the team?”

Since it was not one of those hot superstars who could cause a sensation in China at the same time, the answer was obvious. They were most likely going to bring in a Chinese player!

It must be known that China’s football had just experienced the Dark Age, and it could be said that its vitality had been greatly damaged. In the past few years, because some big companies had entered the circle and started a money – burning mode, the popularity of the China League had begun to slowly return. The broadcasting rights of the China Super League had also become more and more hyped up, and everyone’s attention to football had naturally increased.

However, those dark years had a long – term impact on Chinese football. The problem of a shortage of football talents was very serious. In recent years, the ability of Chinese players was obviously not as good as the group of players who had entered the World Cup in 2002. It had been a long time since Chinese players had a firm foothold in the five major leagues, not counting those who looked at water bottles and sold cars.

If they could bring in a capable Chinese player and maintain a certain number of appearances, it would undoubtedly cause a stir.

China’s football market was quite huge, and the fan base was also coveted by teams in small European countries. If a Chinese player really joined the Spanish team, then the Spanish team could undoubtedly become the LA Liga team with Chinese fans second only to Barcelona and real Madrid. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

They might even surpass Barcelona and real Madrid to become the most popular team in La Liga.

It would be a great boost to the team’s popularity and subsequent commercial development.

Zhou leiyun smiled and said,”director Xia, you’re really quick – witted!” I guessed the main point at once!”

“Director Zhou, can you tell us which Chinese player you’re going to bring in?” Xia ruofei asked with great interest.

Before the transfer was completed, everything would be kept a secret. However, Zhou leiyun did not plan to hide it. He said,””You should know about Wu Lei, right?”

Xia ruofei nodded.”Of course! He’s the best shooter in the Chinese Super League!”

Zhou leiyun laughed and said,”it seems that director Xia has not been watching the Chinese Premier League for a long time. This season, you can remove the word ‘local’. It should not be a problem for him to win the title of best shooter in the Chinese Premier League!”

“Oh? Is that so?” Xia ruofei looked surprised.”He’s in such a good state?” Even those big – Name foreign players can’t beat him?”

After the Chinese football Super League started burning money, many of the big star players in their Prime changed teams and came to China. Because of the limited foreign aid quota, teams generally gave priority to bringing in mid – and front – Field players. The efficiency of these players scoring was much higher than that of the local Chinese players.

This also led to many domestic strikers slowly beginning to change their positions. They were either pulled to the side to become assaulters or simply changed to playing in the backfield.

Wu Lei’s physical condition was not particularly outstanding, but he was able to stand firm in the front field of a strong player like Lin. This was not easy in itself. No one expected him to be able to beat so many popular star players with an annual salary of more than ten million euros this season and become the best striker in the entire league.

“Yeah!” Zhou leiyun said with a smile. Wu Lei’s characteristics were very distinct. He was very agile in running and had a very sensitive sense of smell in front of the door. With so many excellent foreign players feeding him the ball, his scoring efficiency will definitely be much higher!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.””His positioning is top – notch, but his last kick seems to be lacking something!”

Wu Lei was often criticized for missing a single – handed ball, especially when he was in the national team. The support from the backfield was not as good as the club ‘s, so the efficiency of scoring was reduced.

Zhou leiyun also knew that Xia ruofei was teasing Wu Lei about how he often missed a knife ball. He gave a bitter smile and said,””No one is perfect! Even Messi could not guarantee that he would score with a single knife! Besides, the fact that he could lose so many single – Blade attacks meant that his running was amazing! He also has a very keen sense of smell in front of the door. Otherwise, why haven’t I seen other people get so many chances to fight alone?”

“That’s true ...” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”regardless of whether Wu Lei is a solo player or not, at least among the domestic players, he is really good. Moreover, his characteristics are quite suitable for playing in La Liga! After all, La Liga is more technical. It’s not a big problem to be a little worse in physical confrontation!”

“Great minds think alike!” Zhou leiyun said happily.

When Xia ruofei heard that Wu Lei might join RCD Espanyol, he had originally planned to reject Zhou leiyun, but now he was a little tempted.

“Director Zhou,” Xia ruofei asked,”can you tell me what’s the possibility of this transfer?”
