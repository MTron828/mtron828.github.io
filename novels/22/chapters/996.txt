Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei had already grabbed the phone, but put it down when he heard the knock on the door. He raised his voice and said,””Please enter!”

“Brother Xia!”

Xia ruofei heard a familiar voice and immediately looked up.

It was ye Lingyun, who had been learning tea – making skills from li Zhifu on Mount Wuyi for the past few months.

Xia ruofei immediately smiled. He stood up and took a few steps forward. He extended his fist and lightly punched ye Lingyun’s chest. Then he said, “You’re finally back!”

“Brother Xia, I’m back to report for duty!” Ye linyun laughed.

When Xia ruofei returned from Australia, Lei Hu informed him of ye Lingyun’s return. However, he stayed in the office for a while the next day and left after listening to Feng Rao’s report. After that, he was busy preparing for the Buddha Jumps Over the Wall for the entire day. Including this time, ye Lingyun had actually come three times and finally found Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei sized him up and said with a smile,””You brat, you’ve turned black!”

“Hehe! I often go to the tea mountain with master!” Ye linyun smiled.

Xia ruofei took out the special Agent cigarette that elder song had given him and threw one to ye Lingyun. He then took out a cigarette for himself. Ye Lingyun skillfully took out a lighter first and lit Xia ruofei’s cigarette. He then lit his own.

Xia ruofei took a deep breath and exhaled a cloud of smoke. He then pointed at the sofa with the cigarette in his hand and said,””Sit down and talk!”

After the two of them sat down, Xia ruofei asked,””How much of old Mr. Li’s tea – making skills have you learned?”

Ye Lingyun stuck out his chest.”Brother Xia, I don’t know how much I’ve learned, but master said that I can finish my apprenticeship. Although I’m still a little lacking, I need to accumulate experience continuously. It’s impossible to achieve it overnight.”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”it seems that you’ve learned well!”

Then, Xia ruofei looked at ye Lingyun meaningfully and asked,””Ling Yun, since you’ve graduated from old Mr. Li’s tutelage, I believe that the tea factories on Mount Wu Yi will be fighting to have you as their chief tea master!”

Mr. Li Zhifu was like a living monument in the tea industry of Mount Wuyi. He was the absolute authority in the ancient Da Hong Pao production. However, he had publicly announced that he would not leave the mountain again.

Then, ye Lingyun, the last disciple that old Mr. Li had accepted publicly, and a qualified one at that, would definitely be fought over by the tea factories to hire him.

Ye linyun smiled in embarrassment.”There are a few that have this intention.”

“The salary is very high, right?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

“En!” Ye Lingyun nodded.”The highest offer is five hundred thousand!”

“This is incredible!” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but whistle. Then, he smiled and asked,”then why did you come back? He might as well stay there and develop his career! Otherwise ... Why would he come back and continue to be the head of security after learning all that?”

“Brother Xia, I was sent out by the company to learn. Of course I’m coming back now that I’ve finished my studies!” Ye Lingyun replied without hesitation. Besides ... No matter how high the salary offered by those tea factories was, how could they have a future as bright as working for brother Xia? Not to mention that there are so many comrades here!”

Xia ruofei laughed.”You little rascal. Should I praise you or call you stupid?”

“I’m going to stay in the company until brother Xia kicks me out!”Ye Lingyun chuckled.

Xia ruofei patted ye Lingyun’s shoulder and said,”Good brother! Then, he could work hard at paradise Corporation! I, Xia ruofei, will definitely not mistreat my brothers!”

“Of course ...” Ye linyun said with a smile.

“By the way, you’ve been away for a few months. I have to test you!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

After saying that, he reached out and took out a small tea can from the small ice bar next to him and said,””You make tea! Pinpin, what do you think of my tea leaves?”

“Yes!” Ye Lingyun said bluntly.

Then, he opened the can of tea leaves, picked up a wooden spoon from the coffee table, and skillfully scooped out a spoonful of tea leaves and put it into the purple clay teapot. He looked at the ordinary barrelled water connected to the tea tray, and a hint of hesitation appeared in his eyes.

Xia ruofei knew what ye Lingyun was hesitating about, so he smiled and said,””There’s nothing wrong with the water. It’s spring water!”

On the surface, the water in Xia ruofei’s office did not look like that. However, in reality, he had thrown away the original pure water and replaced it with the spirit pool water in the spirit map space. If this water was used to make tea, it would definitely improve the quality of the tea.

Ye linyun didn’t hesitate and immediately pressed the button. The spirit pond water in the bucket was drawn into the kettle and began to heat.

Ye Lingyun had not only learned how to make tea from li Zhifu, but his skills in making tea were also not bad.

After the water was boiled, ye Lingyun’s movements were as smooth as floating clouds and flowing water. Soon, the office was filled with the strong fragrance of tea.

Ye linyun couldn’t help but sniffle before he even tasted it, revealing a look of surprise.

Ye Lingyun quickly prepared two small cups of tea and placed one in front of Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei smiled and gestured for him to taste the tea first.

So ye Lingyun picked up the teacup with his fingers, first leaned close to smell the tea, blew on it, and then poured all the tea into his mouth.

The tea stayed in his mouth for a while before ye Lingyun swallowed it all. He then said in surprise,””Brother Xia, your Da Hong Pao is of very high quality! It’s almost the same as the tea that master made last time, but the taste seems to be a little different ... Where did you get such good tea leaves!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”the main thing is that Cha Qing is good!”

Then, Xia ruofei looked at ye Lingyun and asked,”The company’s security Department can’t do without you. I’ve always kept the position of head of security for you, but ... If you’re willing, you can get a set of tea – making tools on the farm. I can get some of these tea leaves. Are you interested in trying your skills?”

Ye linyun replied without hesitation,””What else is there to say? He would definitely be interested! This kind of Tea Green was something that could only be encountered by luck! Brother Xia, can you really get Tea Green of the same quality?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”why Would I Lie to You?” Since you’re so enthusiastic, don’t blame me for squeezing you dry. There are still some empty rooms at the Ironhide fengdou production workshop. I’ll get them to give you two rooms, and you can start buying the tea – making tools today! I’ll talk to the finance department, and you can directly advance the funds from the account! When you’re ready, let me know and I’ll prepare tea leaves for you!”

“Yes!” Ye Lingyun stood up excitedly and saluted Xia ruofei. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”Alright, alright, look at how happy you are!” Don’t say I didn’t warn you, and don’t complain about being tired!”

“Don’t worry, brother Xia! I’m not afraid of being tired! “I’m just afraid that I have nothing to do ...”Ye Lingyun said with a smile.

“That’s good!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”by the way, you can find a few smart comrades to help you. Then, consciously bring them along. If the quality of the tea leaves is good, I will consider increasing the business of tea leaves.”

Hearing this, ye linyun became even happier and said impatiently,””Alright! Brother Xia, I’ll go and make the preparations ...”

“Go on, go on!” Xia ruofei waved his hand and said with a smile.

Ye Lingyun left in high spirits, so Xia ruofei got up and called Feng Jing to ask her to gather the supervisor in charge to the meeting room for a meeting.
