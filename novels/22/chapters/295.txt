Chapter 296: Here comes the opportunity (1)

The car quickly arrived at the scenic Area of Mount Wu Yi. Although elder song had instructed them not to make things special, they couldn’t just walk around like ordinary tourists. They couldn’t let elder song get off at the entrance of the scenic Area, line up with the ordinary tourists to buy tickets, and then wait for the bus in the scenic Area, right? Out of safety considerations, Xia ruofei would not agree to this. Therefore, elder song acquiesced to du Xiaohai’s arrangement and drove directly into the scenic Area. The Mount Wu Yi Scenic Area was made up of many parts, and each part had its own system. Everyone’s destination today was the Da Hong Pao Scenic Area inside. The Mercedes – Benz business car drove directly to the entrance of the Da Hong Pao tourist area. If they went any further, they would have to walk, and the six Da Hong Pao parent trees were at the end of the road. It was a good thing that elder song was full of energy now, and the Da Hong Pao Scenic Area wasn’t that big, so walking for a while wasn’t a problem. Everyone alighted from the car. The air in the mountain was filled with the fragrance of the earth and the faint fragrance of tea leaves, making people feel relaxed and happy. Two or three people who looked like government officials were already waiting at the entrance of the scenic Area. They quickly walked up to them. Du Xiaohai introduced them to elder song. One of them was the director of the city’s tea industry Bureau, another was the director of the city’s Tea Research Institute, and the last was the director of the scenic area’s Management Committee. Eccentric song smiled and nodded at them very kindly. He took the initiative to extend his hand to them and said,””You’ve worked hard, comrades!” These few people were only section – Level cadres. When had they ever seen a Big Chief like elder song? All of them were very excited and came forward to shake hands with elder song. “Chief, this is our Da Hong Pao Scenic Area. There’s our ecological tea garden and a experimental nursery of the Tea Research Institute,” said du Xiaohai. “Let’s go!”Elder song smiled. Let’s go in and take a look!” “Please, chief!” The group of them passed through the Da Hong Pao attraction’s ticket gate and entered. After entering the scenic Area, there was a stone path. This path passed through tea gardens, and along the way, there were green tea trees. “Chief, this year’s tea leaves have already been picked. A new batch of tea will be released after the spring Festival. That’s why the tea garden is currently in a recuperating stage. ” Du Xiaohai smiled and explained,”these tea gardens are owned by the local tea farmers. When the scenic Area was built, the tea farmers all moved to the foot of the mountain, but the management rights of the tea gardens are still reserved for them.” “En!” Elder song nodded. It’s a good thing for the government to engage in development and construction, but you can’t invade the interests of the people and fight for benefits with them. You’ve done well on this point!” “You’re too kind, chief,”du Xiaohai said modestly. Along the way, the fresh smell of soil and the faint fragrance of tea leaves assailed their nostrils. All that entered their eyes was a lush green Scene. It contrasted with the layers of strange peaks and rocks in the distance, making one feel a lot more open – minded. Du Xiaohai also introduced the situation of the tea plantations in the Da Hong Pao Scenic Area. The focus of his introduction was, of course, the ecological tea plantation of the city tea industry Bureau and the experimental nursery of the Tea Research Institute. Du Xiaohai was very familiar with the business. The director of the tea Bureau and the director of the Tea Research Institute basically didn’t need to be supplemented. Elder song also nodded frequently and asked one or two questions from time to time. Obviously, he was quite interested in what du Xiaohai was introducing. Du Xiaohai was naturally overjoyed. He carefully organized his words and answered elder song’s question. The group walked and talked, and soon reached the end of the road. From afar, he could see the three red words “Da Hong Pao” on the rock wall. Beside the stone carving, there were six tea trees growing in the cracks of the steep cliff. “Chief, there are six famous Da Hong Pao parent trees up ahead. The stone carvings on the rock wall were carved by the monks of Tianxin temple during the Republic of China ...” Du Xiaohai introduced. Eccentric song listened with great interest. Suddenly, he saw a shop under the cliff in front of him. The signboard was quite eye – catching. Elder song laughed and pointed to the front.”The world’s number one egg! That’s an interesting name ...” “Chief, they’re actually selling herbal tea eggs, but the tea leaves used to make the herbal tea eggs are Da Hong Pao. The shop sign is just a gimmick ...” Du Xiaohai said, a little embarrassed. The scenic Area management Committee Director came over and said,””Chief, this shop has been open for many years and is one of our old tenants. Although the signboard is a little exaggerated, we still run it with good faith. One herbal tea egg is only three Yuan.” After hearing that, song Rui asked with interest,”a tea egg that costs three Yuan ... It’s not made from the Dahongpao tea leaves from the mother tree, right?” Otherwise, wouldn’t we lose all our capital?” The Administrative Committee Director laughed.”You must be joking ... The Da Hong Pao parent trees have stopped being harvested since 2007. However, the tea leaves used in this shop are also quite authentic. They are the Da Hong Pao tea leaves produced in our tea garden in the scenic Area.” “Then let’s go and try the ‘world’s first egg’!” Eccentric song nodded. “Alright!” Du Xiaohai quickly said. Chief, there’s a teahouse up ahead, we can go and have some tea. ” “Alright!” Elder song said heartily. Xiao Rui, go buy a few herbal tea eggs and bring them to the teahouse!” “Alright!” Song Rui replied. “Chief, we’ll go buy it ...” Du Xiaohai said hurriedly. Elder song waved his hand.”No need, no need. It’s good to let Xiao Rui run the errands. My grandson is usually too lazy. It’s not easy for him to come out. I have to order him around ...” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh. Song Rui pulled a long face and didn’t dare to refute. As for du Xiaohai and the others, they wanted to laugh but didn’t dare to. They could only laugh awkwardly. As the group walked forward, the smile on elder song’s face gradually disappeared, and his brows furrowed. Because his view was blocked by the shop, elder song only saw a whole team of armed police standing at the bottom of the cliff after he got closer. “Secretary du, what’s going on?” Elder song’s tone was a little bad.”Didn’t I tell you not to make a big scene? Why did you transfer the troops over?” “You’re mistaken, chief!”Du Xiaohai quickly explained. Today is the day for the Tea Research Institute to carry out routine maintenance and trimming of the six Da Hong Pao parent trees. These armed police soldiers are also here to maintain order. Every time we carry out maintenance on the parent trees, we will ask the Armed Police Force to send a squad of soldiers to help maintain order. ” Eccentric song’s face brightened a little and asked,””Is that really the case?” “Yes, yes,” Du Xiaohai said,”chief, at first, the comrades in the team were asking if we should postpone the inauguration, but I said there was no need. What you want to see is our real situation, so I made the decision to let the comrades in the tea leaves Bureau and the Tea Research Institute work as usual.” Eccentric song finally smiled and nodded. Du Xiaohai was secretly relieved. Xia ruofei’s heart started to beat faster when he saw this. Along the way, he had been thinking about how to get some branches from the mother tree. He didn’t expect that today would be such a coincidence. The staff was trimming and maintaining the branches, so some branches would definitely be cut off. The opportunity was right in front of him! Xia ruofei took a deep breath and calmed himself down. Then, he asked in a calm tone,””Secretary du, I’m very interested in these six tea trees. May I go up and take a look? Don’t worry, I won’t affect the work of my comrades!”Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com
