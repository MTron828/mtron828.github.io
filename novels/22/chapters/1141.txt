Seeing Liang Chongshan’s expression, Xia ruofei and Zhao Yongjun looked at each other, and a smile flashed in their eyes.

Song Rui, on the other hand, did not mind the drama and deliberately said,””Mr. Liang, quickly expose us! We can’t wait any longer ...”

Liang Chongshan snorted and ignored song Rui. Instead, he looked even more carefully.

MA Xiong and Ma Zhiming’s expressions became more and more awkward.

“Old Liang, how’s the reading going?” MA Xiong urged.

Liang Chongshan raised his hand and used his sleeve to wipe the sweat on his forehead. He looked a little embarrassed. In fact, he had already begun to waver in his heart. Facing the large square card in his hand, he had a feeling of palpitations.

“Chairman MA, this ...” Liang Chongshan started to stammer.

“What’s this?” MA Xiong was getting impatient.

Even though Liang Chongshan was an old Hengfeng official and had made great contributions to the group, his performance today was a little too much. He had also repeatedly challenged his authority, which made MA Xiong a little unhappy. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Chairman MA, I’m not too sure ...” Liang Chongshan took a deep breath and said with difficulty,”the flaws are not very obvious ...”

“Mr. Liang, you’re so experienced, how could you not see it?” Zhao Yongjun said sarcastically. You’ve been looking at it for a long time, what did you see? tell us!”

“You ...” Liang Chongshan was speechless.

In fact, after such a long time of inspection, he had basically confirmed that this King’s Green square card was the real deal. However, he had been too confident before, and now there was no room for negotiation.

“Old Liang, tell us your judgment!” MA Xiong’s face darkened.

Liang Chongshan was now in a dilemma. He was forced into a corner with no way to escape.

In fact, Liang Chongshan was deeply involved in the jewelry and jade industry, especially in the study of jadeite. If there had not been the previous farce, he would have loved this piece of King’s Green very much.

But now, as he looked at the large square tablet in his hand, he wished it could immediately disappear from the world.

Xia ruofei looked at Liang Chongshan, who was struggling as if he was constipated. He could not help but be wary of Wanwan. This old man would not smash the square card in his anger, would he?

Xia ruofei mumbled to himself as he increased the intensity of his spiritual power.

It turned out that Xia ruofei’s worry was unnecessary.

No matter how unhappy Liang Chongshan was, he wouldn’t do something so crazy. Since the king’s Green square tile was real, it was worth at least hundreds of millions. If he really did that, he wouldn’t be able to afford it even if he sold himself!

Under MA Xiong’s gaze, Liang Chongshan felt even more pressured. However, he had nowhere to retreat to, so he could only say with difficulty,””Chairman MA, I ... I can’t determine the authenticity ...”

Song Rui saw that Liang Chongshan was still being stubborn even under such circumstances. He could not help but say sarcastically,””Is it because you can’t judge, or do you not want to say it, or do you not dare to say it?”

Liang Chongshan’s face turned red, but he did not say anything.

MA Xiong already knew the answer. He shook his head helplessly and said,”Alright, old Liang, you can leave first! Manager Chen, bring old Liang to the company’s hotel to rest. ”

The General Manager of Hengfeng group’s Beijing branch, Chen Zhilin, quickly said,””Yes, Chairman.”

Liang Chongshan’s expression changed and he said quickly,””Chairman MA, I can’t leave! This piece of Jade is priceless. I have to help you keep an eye on it to prevent him from demanding an exorbitant price!”

Fine! In a moment of panic, Liang Chongshan blurted out the answer that he had been holding back for a long time. In fact, he had already confirmed the authenticity of the square plate.

After feeling everyone’s strange gazes, Liang Chongshan came back to his senses. He blushed and explained,””Chairman, I ... I think ...”

However, at this time, no matter what he said, it would be useless.

MA Xiong shook his head and said,”old Liang, you should go and rest!” It’s not like I’m a newbie in the jewelry business for the first time. I know the price!”

MA Xiong’s tone was still gentle, but it carried a hint of unquestionable authority.

No matter how arrogant Liang Chongshan was, he was still an employee of the Hengfeng group. His respect for MA Xiong was in his bones. He knew that MA Xiong was really angry when he heard that. He didn’t dare to get himself into trouble at this time. He could only nod helplessly and say,”Alright then!”

After Liang Chongshan left Xia ruofei’s room dejectedly, MA Xiong smiled bitterly and said,””Xia Sheng, young master Zhao, young master Song, I’m really sorry. Old Liang ...”

“Mr. MA, I can see that Mr. Liang is still loyal to your company,” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“If not for that, I would have fired him long ago!” MA Xiong said helplessly.

“Xia Sheng, uncle Liang is one of the founding members of the company. Actually, he’s just a little antisocial, but ...” Ma Zhiming carefully explained.

After saying that, Ma Zhiming hesitated for a moment, but he still continued,”Uncle Liang’s hometown is in the capital. When he was young, he went to Hong Kong through some channels for some well – known reasons. He has been living in Hong Kong since then. So, he may have some prejudice against the mainland, especially against young masters like you two ...”

“Actually, elder Liang’s past was quite rough. I hope the three of you can be magnanimous and not hold it against him,” MA Xiong said with a nod.
