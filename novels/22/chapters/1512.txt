Chapter 1513: Realm Fox (1)

Translator: 549690339

Rather than a cave, it was more like a stone room.

After Xia ruofei stepped in, his eyes first fell on the platform in the middle of the stone room. Then, he could not take his eyes off it.

There was a pile of black stones neatly placed on the stone platform. A conservative estimate would be more than ten of them. These black stones were all realm stones that Xia ruofei could not find.

It was no wonder that even though they were separated by the formation, the induction Jade Leaf was so hot that it seemed like it was about to explode.

After entering the cave, the sensory Jade Leaf was frighteningly hot. Xia ruofei had to use his spiritual power to completely isolate it from the outside world.

Xia ruofei’s heart was trembling. With so many world stones, how many levels could the spirit map space level up? What would the space look like after the upgrade?

However, his excitement only lasted for two seconds before his expression changed.

That was because the little white beast that had entered the cave earlier than him had also targeted the pile of world stones on the stone platform.

The speed of this little white beast was astonishing.

Xia ruofei didn’t even have time to react before he saw a white flash. Then, the White beast pounced on the pile of realm stones.

The next scene made Xia ruofei’s heart turn cold.

The little white beast impatiently used its forelimbs to pick up a world stone and stuffed it into its mouth. Then, it began to chew with crunching sounds.

While Xia ruofei was still in a daze, it had already devoured the entire realm stone at an extremely fast speed ... Down ... Down ... Down ...

Just as the little white beast picked up the second realm stone without any hesitation, Xia ruofei finally regained his senses. His heart ached as he cried out,””Stop! No... Shut up!”

Xia ruofei sprinted over and pounced on the pile of realm stones. His posture was extremely unsightly, like a dog protecting its food ...

It was not that Xia ruofei did not think of storing the world stone into the spirit map space. However, after trying it out, he realized that the space around the world stone seemed to be locked and he could not retrieve it from a distance.

At this moment, the little white beast had already started eating the Second World stone. That was why Xia ruofei had lost his composure.

The little white beast was enjoying its meal and was startled by Xia ruofei’s sudden pounce.

When it saw Xia ruofei’s actions, it realized that Xia ruofei was going to snatch the world stone from it. Instantly, all the fur on its body stood up and it bared its teeth at Xia ruofei, looking extremely fierce.

However, the little white beast had witnessed Xia ruofei’s powerful combat ability along the way. The puppets that had chased it were often killed by Xia ruofei with a single wave of his hand.

The little white beast weighed its options and felt that it was no match for the black “hidden weapon”. Hence, its fierce expression immediately changed into a look of grievance. It whined and gestured at Xia ruofei.

Of course, even though it was ‘negotiating’ with Xia ruofei, it did not forget to gobble up the Second World stone.

This was a delicacy that it had been looking forward to for a long time. For the sake of these world stones, it had wandered around this underground Palace for over a month. There were a few times when it had almost lost its life from being chased by the puppets. Even so, it was reluctant to leave.

Now that they had finally entered the cave, how could they bear to give these realm stones to Xia ruofei?

Xia ruofei glared at the little white beast.””No way! I’ve spent so much effort just to find world stones, and you actually want to eat them? isn’t this a waste of heavenly resources?”

It was at this moment that Xia Qing, who was in the spirit map space, suddenly cried out,””Master, I know what this little white beast is! It’s a realm Fox!”

Now, only the space around the world stone had been locked. Xia ruofei’s connection with the spirit map space was still normal.

“A realm Fox? What the hell?” Xia ruofei said unhappily,”I don’t care what kind of Fox it is. I won’t allow it to snatch my world stone!”

Xia Qing explained,”master, the realm Fox is an extremely rare beast. Its kind is naturally very sensitive to spatial power. I think this realm Fox must have been attracted here by the aura of the realm stone.”

“You’re saying ... This little fellow is an enlarged version of the sensing Jade Leaf?” Xia ruofei asked hesitantly.

Under Xia ruofei’s fierce gaze, the little white beast did not dare to touch the Third World stone. That was why Xia ruofei had the time to ask.

Xia Qing said,””Master, the world Fox’s favorite food is the world stone. They are very sensitive to the world stone. Even if they are a thousand miles away or buried deep underground, they can still find it. This is because they grow by eating things with spatial attributes. All the world foxes have spatial attributes. This world Fox should still be a Cub, so it is only outstanding in speed. If it continues to evolve, it might even be able to master the ability of spatial teleportation. This is their innate talent.”

“In other words, this realm Fox was also attracted here by these realm stones and didn’t originally live in the underground palace?” Xia ruofei asked.

“The possibility is very high!” Xia Qing said.

When the White realm Fox saw Xia ruofei mumbling to himself, it couldn’t help but secretly reach out its forelimbs to a realm stone.

However, the sharp – eyed Xia ruofei did not hesitate to open its front leg and said,””Little guy, don’t be greedy! You’ve already eaten two pieces, so at least leave some for me!”

There were at least ten to twenty world stones in the pile. However, they were too important for the upgrade of the spirit map space. Xia ruofei’s heart ached even if One World stone was missing.

The White realm Fox protested and chirped a few times, gesturing at Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei was half – guessing and half – confused, but he still managed to understand what it meant. Xia ruofei was both angry and amused as he said,””You’re saying that you discovered these world stones first? I’ll go! Do you still have any shame? If I didn’t spend so much effort to break the formation, would you have been able to enter? I think even if you wander outside for a hundred years, you can only drool at the sight of these world stones!”

The little white beast felt that Xia ruofei’s words made sense. It had indeed relied on his help to enter the cave. Otherwise, the puppets outside would have been enough to deal with it, let alone enter.

However, these world stones were all extremely delicious in its eyes, so how could it bear to give them to Xia ruofei?

The white fox made a gesture at Xia ruofei pitifully.

This time, Xia ruofei understood. He smiled and said,””You’re saying that we should split this batch of world stones? I’ll reluctantly agree to this! However, you’ve already eaten two pieces. I feel that it’s not bad for you to get two pieces according to the amount of effort you put in. Therefore, the remaining world stones are all mine!”

Xia ruofei then emphasized,””Don’t think that I can’t find this place without you leading the way! I’ve come here to find the world stone, and at such a close distance, I have my own way of sensing the location of the world stone, so even without you, I can still find them. As for you, if I hadn’t cracked the formation, you wouldn’t even be able to enter the door!”

Xia ruofei did not lie to the White realm Fox. Although the range of the Jade Leaf could not be compared to the realm Fox’s sensing ability, Xia ruofei would be able to find this place sooner or later with the help of the Jade Leaf. It was just that he might take a few detours.

The White realmfox was naturally unwilling to accept Xia ruofei’s harsh distribution plan. It stretched out its forelimbs and gestured while chirping, as if it was trying to argue with him.

At this time, Xia Qing suggested in the space,””Master, why don’t you ... Give it a few more? The realm Fox is very sensitive to spatial – Type items. If it is willing to follow you in the future, it will be much easier for you to find the realm stone!”

After Xia ruofei heard Xia Qing’s words, he thought for a moment and said,””Alright, alright, just tell me how to distribute it! Little guy, don’t ask for too much!”

The white fox immediately made a gesture. Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows and said,”” 30 – 70? Although you want 30% is a little too much, who asked us to be fated? 30 – 70 it is! Let me calculate, there were originally a total of twenty – One World stones here, so thirty percent would be six. You just ate two, so I’ll give you four more!” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

The white fox panicked and gestured a few times. Xia ruofei saw this and shouted,””What? 70% for you and 30% for me? Why don’t you just Rob someone! It’s impossible!”

The White realmfox changed its hand gesture again.

” 50 – 50? No, no, no!” Xia ruofei said,”you didn’t do anything. Why did you take half of it?”

The man and the Beast continued to haggle in the cave.

In the end, both parties agreed to a 40 – 60 split. The White realm Fox would get 40%, and Xia ruofei would get 60%.

Although Xia ruofei’s heart ached for the world stone, since Xia Qing had suggested to give the White realm Fox some benefits, he might as well be generous and accept 40 – 60.

After coming to an agreement, the White realm Fox immediately pulled the seven world stones in front of it and looked at the remaining world stones longingly for a long time. Then, it protected the seven world stones tightly, afraid that Xia ruofei would snatch them away.

Xia ruofei did some calculations and couldn’t help but laugh.””Damn, isn’t 40% 8.4 Yuan? According to the rounding calculation, you should have eight Yuan! Including the two you ate, you can only take six!”

The White realm Fox didn’t care about the cost and protected its realm stone tightly, not willing to give another one out.

Xia ruofei saw this and smiled.””Forget it, I’ll give you an extra piece! Who asked me to be so kind! However, the remaining world stones are all mine!”

The White realmfox looked at the remaining 12 world stones and almost drooled. However, it still nodded unwillingly.

Xia ruofei immediately grabbed the 12 world stones. He was extremely excited. Yingying had really reaped a great harvest this time! Although he had lost nine world stones for no reason, this was still the biggest gain he had ever gained from the spirit map space.

He just didn’t know how many levels these world stones could upgrade the space. Xia ruofei said in his heart.

At this moment, he suddenly realized that the spatial seal around the world stones had disappeared. He quickly kept all 12 world stones into the spirit map space.

Now, Xia ruofei’s control over the spirit map space was far better than before. Without Xia ruofei’s instructions, these world stones would not be immediately absorbed even if they were put into the space.

Now that Xia ruofei was in this dangerous underground Palace, he could use the spirit map space at any time. Hence, he did not let the spirit map space absorb the world stones immediately. After all, the process of upgrading might take time, and he could not use the spirit map space during this time.

Xia ruofei did not notice that when he was storing the realm stones into the space, the White realm Fox, which was very sensitive to spatial fluctuations, had also noticed it. Its eyes could not help but shine ...
