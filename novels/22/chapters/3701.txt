Xia ruofei did not get angry at the chubby baby’s weapon Spirit’s attitude. He smiled and asked,””If 1 take out the seven stars order, will sect leader Chen outside notice? Will he be able to recognize this seven stars order?”

The chubby baby’s Artifact Spirit curled his lips and said,””You little kid, you’re really too cautious! Don’t worry! That old man must be confused now because he can’t sense the situation inside the seven Star Pavilion at all!”

“You did it?” Xia ruofei asked.

“Of course!” The chubby baby’s weapon spirit said with a smug look on his face,”this is related to the core secret of the seven Star Pavilion. How can we let that old man spy on us at will? He’s not the master of the seven Star Pavilion!”

Xia ruofei nodded. Although he did not completely believe the chubby baby’s weapon spirit, he knew that if the chubby baby wanted to block Chen Nanfeng’s detection, it should be a very simple matter. Besides, if the seven stars order was really the core that controlled the seven stars Pavilion, it would make sense logically.

Of course, even if the chubby baby’s weapon spirit had lied to Xia ruofei, he would not have suffered any greater losses.

He quickly understood the pros and cons of this matter and nodded,””Alright, 1 got it! Then we’ll do as you say!”

With that, Xia ruofei immediately removed the suppression force on the seven stars order. When the seven stars order flicked up, he took advantage of the situation and moved the seven stars order out of the spirit map.

Xia ruofei was observing the seven stars order with his naked eyes. The mysterious lines on it were more intuitive than sensing them with his spiritual power. He was already very accomplished in array Dao, so he subconsciously began to analyze these lines.

The chubby baby’s Artifact Spirit shouted at the side,’what are you doing?

Hurry up and bind it with blood! 1 don’t think the old man outside can hold on for much longer!”

Xia ruofei finally came back to his senses. Now was not the time to study this. He quickly circulated his vital Qi and squeezed out a drop of blood from his finger. He waved his hand and dropped the blood on the seven stars order.

The card – shaped seven stars order quickly absorbed the drop of blood without leaving any trace. However, the mysterious lines on it seemed to flash slightly and then went silent.

However, Xia ruofei was keenly aware that there was a very close connection between him and this seven stars order. He could easily use this magical order token with just a thought.

At this time, Xia ruofei also secretly heaved a sigh of relief, because the chubby baby’s weapon spirit did not lie to him. After taking control of the seven stars order, he could indeed control the seven Star Pavilion.

Of course, as the weapon spirit had not fully acknowledged him as its master, it was only in a state of partial acknowledgment. Hence, Xia ruofei could not fully control the seven Star Pavilion, let alone control it as easily as he controlled the spirit map.

Even so, this was still a dream for everyone in the first heaven society, including Chen Nanfeng.

Xia ruofei could easily sense most of the space in the seven Star Pavilion. There were still 58 cultivators in the seven Star Pavilion, and Xia ruofei could see them clearly.

He even knew what benefits they had obtained.

This feeling was much clearer than what Chen Nanfeng could sense outside.

In other words, Xia ruofei’s control over the seven Star Pavilion was even stronger than Chen Nanfeng’s.

Moreover, the reason why Chen Nanfeng could control part of the seven Star Pavilion was entirely because the chubby baby’s weapon spirit had gone easy on him. If the chubby baby’s weapon spirit had really gone all out to fight back, Chen Nanfeng would very likely have lost control of the seven Star Pavilion.

For example, just now, the chubby baby’s weapon spirit only needed to think a little, and the situation inside the seven stars Pavilion became a fog in Chen Nanfeng’s eyes. He couldn’t see through it at all. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

And Xia ruofei’s control of the seven stars Pavilion was completed through the seven stars order.

After the blood contract, even the chubby baby weapon spirit would not be able to stop Xia ruofei from controlling part of the seven Star Pavilion’s functions.

Of course, the weapon spirit was a part of the seven stars Pavilion, and so was the seven stars order.

Xia ruofei was able to control the seven stars order because he had already obtained the partial recognition of the chubby baby Artifact Spirit, so it was impossible for the artifact Spirit to go against Xia ruofei.

With the seven stars order, Xia ruofei could even keep the seven stars Pavilion in his dantian.

This was something that Chen Nanfeng could not achieve even after decades of hard work. To date, the seven Star Pavilion’s smallest state was what everyone had just seen today. Therefore, the first heaven society had specially set up a heavily guarded and highly guarded place for the seven Star Pavilion.

If Chen Nanfeng knew that Xia ruofei could shrink the seven Star Pavilion and store it in his dantian, he would probably spit out blood. He had worked hard for so many years and even broke through to the nascent Soul Stage, but he couldn’t do it at all. On the other hand, Xia ruofei could do it so easily. It was really infuriating to compare.

Of course, as he had not been fully acknowledged by the weapon spirit, Xia ruofei did not have complete control over the seven Star Pavilion.

For example, there were a few spaces in the seven Star Pavilion, but Xia ruofei could not sense the situation in them at all. Just like Chen Nanfeng, when he sensed these spaces, all that appeared in his mind was an endless fog. He could not see through it at all. Chapter 2001: the final battle!
