Chapter 248: You’re in big trouble (1)

Everyone looked in the direction of the voice and saw Lin Feng’s figure appearing at the door of the office. Ling Qingxue gritted her teeth, her eyes filled with disgust. Lin Feng maintained his gentle and refined appearance with a faint smile on his face. He didn’t even look at Dao BA and the others who were wailing on the ground and walked straight to Xia ruofei and the other two. When Lin Feng’s gaze swept past Ling Qingxue, a hint of lust flashed in his eyes. After that, his gaze went past Ling Qingxue and landed on Ling Xiaotian. “Hello, uncle Ling,” Lin Feng slightly bowed. Ling Xiaotian’s expression was complicated as he said,”so it’s young master Lin!” May I know what business you have here?” “I came to your company’s upper floor to handle some matters,” said Lin Feng with a smile. “I heard it was so noisy here, so I came in to take a look.” Uncle Ling, what happened?” Seeing Lin Feng’s pretense, Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but snort coldly and turn her head away. She felt like she would puke if she looked at him any longer. Ling Xiaotian stared into Lin Feng’s eyes and said,””Young master Lin should be very clear about what happened, right?” Lin Feng laughed,”I just came in. How can I be clear? However, I’m quite familiar with little Shen, old Liu, and the others. If there’s any misunderstanding in the middle, I can help to mediate. We’ll have to see if uncle Ling is sincere or not. ” After speaking, Lin Feng turned his head and asked,”little Shen, tell me!” What happened here? How come someone’s injured?” Xiao Shen immediately said,”young master Lin, we came to check the company’s accounts today according to the law. We didn’t expect them to resist the law so barbarically. Not only did they not let us take the accounts away, but they even injured our staff!” “Oh? He actually hit someone? This is too much!” Lin Feng said exaggeratedly,”by the way, didn’t you all bring along your law enforcement recorder? Did you take a picture?” Xiao Shen glared at Xia ruofei and said,””I’ve recorded it all!” When the two sides were arguing, the officer in charge of the recording had turned on the law enforcement recorder. The scene of Xia ruofei teaching the hooligans a lesson was also recorded. “Ah, that’s not good ...” Lin Feng said to Ling Xiaotian with a smile,”uncle Ling, this is already a crime. If little Shen hands these videos over to the police, I’m afraid that the person beside you will have to bear the consequences!” Lin Feng’s original intention was to use scar and the others to teach Xia ruofei a lesson and make him suffer some physical pain to relieve the hatred in his heart. But he didn’t expect scar and the others to be so useless. Over ten of them were directly abused by Xia ruofei. Fortunately, all these scenes were recorded. If Xia ruofei’s previous action of stopping Shen was considered extreme, then what happened just now was definitely a criminal act of beating others. With these videos, Lin Feng felt that he had already caught Xia ruofei’s weak spot. He could do whatever he wanted to him with just a word. “Young master Lin, what exactly do you want? let’s be straightforward and not resort to insinuations!” Ling Xiaotian said with a dark expression. “Uncle Ling, the current situation isn’t in your favor!” Lin Feng said with a proud smile. If little Shen and the others take it seriously, the kid next to you will be in jail for at least a few years, and your company will receive a large fine, or even close down for reorganization. That will be a huge loss. ” Ling Xiaotian quietly looked at Lin Feng, waiting for him to continue. Lin Feng’s scorching gaze turned to Ling Qingxue as he said,””Uncle Ling, you know that I’ve admired Qingxue for a long time. If Qingxue can be friends with me, then we’ll be a family. I think little Shen and the others will still give me face. Then, what happened today won’t be a big deal anymore ... Right, little Shen?” “Yes, yes, yes! Young master Lin’s girlfriend’s family’s company, we definitely have to take care of it. ” Xiao Shen quickly nodded and bowed. Lin Feng nodded in satisfaction, thinking that this little Shen wasn’t bad. His mind was quick and he was also very understanding. He could nurture him later. Ling Qingxue’s expression changed, and she coldly said,””You’re dreaming! I’ll never like a despicable person like you in my life!” A hint of ruthlessness flashed in Lin Feng’s eyes, but he quickly concealed it. He revealed a gentle smile and said,””Qingxue, it seems that you have some misunderstandings about me. I think you’ll understand me after we get to know each other more. ” Ling Qingxue coldly snorted, not hiding her disgust for Lin Feng at all. “Young master Lin, Qingxue has to make her own decisions in matters of the heart. Even if I am her father, I can’t help her make this decision,” Ling Xiaotian said in a low voice. “So you’re saying that uncle Ling has rejected me?” Lin Feng’s face turned cold. Ling Xiaotian calmly looked at Lin Feng. He didn’t say anything, but his meaning was clear. Right now, Ling Xiaotian’s heart was also filled with anger. To think that I used to think that this Lin Feng was a modest gentleman. I didn’t expect him to be no different from those popinjays! He was just better at disguising himself! Ling Xiaotian said angrily in his heart. Lin Feng’s smile turned cold as he calmly spoke,””Shen, call the police!” “Alright!” Xiao Shen responded excitedly and directly took out his phone to call the police. “Young master Lin, Xiao Xia’s attack was a little heavy, but it was this group of people who spoke rudely first!” Ling Xiaotian said with great difficulty,”you ... Can you have mercy ...” No matter how the company was messed up, Ling Xiaotian could still bear the consequences. However, Xia ruofei was not an employee of his company. Today, he had helped out for the sake of justice. No matter what, he could not let anything happen to Xia ruofei! Hence, Ling Xiaotian could only lower his face and beg Lin Feng. The warm smile on Lin Feng’s face was long gone. It was replaced by an icy expression as he said,””You can save these words for the police!” Ling Xiaotian’s expression changed a few times. It was obvious that he was trying his best to suppress the anger in his chest. If it wasn’t for Yi Shan’s accident some time ago, I wouldn’t have been humiliated like this by a little brat like you ... Ling Xiaotian thought angrily. Ling Xiaotian and Duan Yishan, the former deputy Mayor of Sanshan city, had a very close relationship. They were not in a relationship of power and money, but they were good Brothers who had played together since they were young. Ling Xiaotian started his business after he retired from the Army, and it could be said that the support of Duan Yishan was indispensable for his business to develop to its current scale. However, Duan Yishan was suddenly removed from his position during an Anti – Corruption campaign a few months ago. Now, he was in the stage of a judicial trial. It was said that the amount of money involved was over ten million. What awaited him was a long life in prison. While Ling Xiaotian felt pained that his good brother had not been able to withstand the temptation, he had also begun to keep a low profile in his business. Other than the more than half completed Lingyun hotel project, the lingji restaurant had stopped expanding. However, unexpected disasters like today were still hard to guard against. Ever since the first lingji restaurant chain was suddenly inspected, Ling Xiaotian had been calling for help from some of his acquaintances in the system. However, those people who had called him brother when Duan Yishan was still in office were all trying to avoid him, especially when they found out that this matter might involve the municipal Party committee’s Deputy Secretary Lin. The fickleness of human nature made Ling Xiaotian extremely emotional. Ling Xiaotian retracted his thoughts. He looked at Lin Feng and then at Xia ruofei. He gritted his teeth and said,””Little Xia, you go first! The things here have nothing to do with you!” “What does uncle Ling mean?” Lin Feng said leisurely,”are you instigating the suspect to escape? Shen’s law enforcement recorder wasn’t turned off!” Ling Xiaotian coldly snorted and ignored Lin Feng. He continued to speak to Xia ruofei,””Little Xia, uncle thanks you for today. But I don’t need your help here anymore, so you should leave!” Xia ruofei looked at Ling Xiaotian with a hint of admiration in his eyes. He smiled and said,””Uncle Ling, don’t worry about me. They’re just a few hooligans. It’s fine if I beat them up.” “RUO Fei ... Why don’t ... You leave first ...” Ling Qingxue said, a little worried. “Qingxue, I promised you that I would help you solve your problem once and for all. How can I leave now?” Xia ruofei held Ling Qingxue’s hand and smiled gently.”Don’t worry! It was just a small mistake before, but the person we’re looking for this time will definitely be fine!” “Hmph! “What a shameless boast ...” Lin Feng coldly laughed. Xia ruofei smiled at Lin Feng,””Do you dare to make a bet with me?” “What are we betting on?” Lin Feng coldly asked. “I bet that you’ll be in big trouble when I count to three ...” “Hmph, you don’t know your place!” Xia ruofei did not care about Lin Feng and started to count. Because he had exceptional hearing, he had already heard a series of footsteps. He was quite familiar with one or two of them. “1!” “2!” “3!” As soon as Xia ruofei finished his sentence, another group of people appeared at the entrance of the finance department ...ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m
