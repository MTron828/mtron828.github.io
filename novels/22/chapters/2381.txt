Seeing another “person” who could fly, the captives were almost numb. Of course, what followed was despair, and they couldn’t even have the heart to resist.

Naturally, the captives did not know that the “manager Xia” beside Xia ruofei was not a person of flesh and blood.

After Xia Qing got Xia ruofei’s permission, she said with a cold expression,””Everyone, split into five groups! Bao Guijun, the five of you will be promoted to group leaders, each of you will lead a group!”

Speaking of this, Xia Qing pondered for a moment and said,””Team leaders are mainly in charge of management. Their basic points are 30% higher than normal team members!”

Xia Qing could only speak Chinese. Xia ruofei saw this and said to Manzila,””Manzila, you’ll be in charge of translating for manager Xia!”

“Yes!” Manzila did not dare to neglect, and quickly translated Xia Qing’s words into English.

Even though his hands and feet were broken and he could not stand, he was still a level 3 Qi refining cultivator. His voice was full of energy, and everyone present could hear him clearly.

Bao Guijun and the first batch of free laborers were surprised and happy. They didn’t expect to have such a benefit when they were first caught. They quickly said with tears of gratitude,””Thank you, manager Xia!”

Only then did the captives notice Bao Guijun and the other four people standing in the herb garden. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Bao Guijun and the others belonged to the dark shadow Squad. The higher – ups of modr like Manzila and Boak didn’t know them at all. The new recruits of the training camp didn’t know who these five people were.

On the other hand, the person in charge of the training camp, Metatron, as well as the instructors and guards who were stationed at the training camp, had some impression of them.

Merendo immediately realized that the extermination of the Morde organization by the powerful Eastern Immortals was most likely the doing of Bao Guijun and his men. He couldn’t help but reveal a murderous look.

Bao Guijun and the others also felt the killing intent from Metatron. They couldn’t help but shrink their necks subconsciously. Metatron was notorious in the organization. The modr training camp was not an ordinary camp. The prospective mercenaries trained here did not have any human rights protection. Beating, scolding, and physical punishment were common. Even when Metatron was in a bad mood, it was common for him to kill people.

In particular, all the mercenaries had to undergo anti – interrogation training. This training was to take turns as prisoners and face all kinds of torture from the training camp instructors. This was to train their tolerance to torture. Mercenaries who had undergone strict anti – interrogation training would even develop a certain resistance to some nerve drugs. However, there was no doubt that this training was a nightmare for everyone.

The anti – interrogation training in the training camp was personally handled by merendo.

Metatron’s mind seemed to be twisted. Every time he saw his students being tortured to death, he felt an inexplicable joy.

Therefore, most of the people who left the training camp would have a certain amount of psychological trauma, especially when they saw Metatron. They would subconsciously feel a fear that came from the bottom of their hearts.

Xia ruofei, who was standing in the sky, naturally noticed this detail immediately.

He furrowed his brows and grabbed at the air, pulling Metatron out of the crowd and into the air.

Metatron was so scared that he almost peed.

Only then did he realize that he was no longer a high – ranking member of the modr organization, and this was no longer his training camp. He was now a prisoner.

Xia ruofei said coldly,”I don’t care who you were in the past!” Whether it’s the higher – ups of the modr organization or the new recruits who haven’t left the training camp, they’re all the same to me. They’re all laborers! If any of you dare to make a fuss, I don’t mind breaking this thorn off! Do you understand?”

“Yes, yes, yes ...” The captives saw Xia ruofei’s methods and didn’t dare to have any other thoughts.

Metatron’s limbs were frozen stiff, afraid that the force that was holding him down would disappear. If that were the case, how could he still be alive after falling from a height of more than ten meters?

Xia ruofei then said coldly to Metatron,””I don’t want there to be a second time, understand?”

“I understand! I understand!” Merendo said in a trembling voice.

Xia ruofei then waved his hand and threw Metatron down.

“Arghh!” Metatron screamed in fear. He was getting faster and faster, and the ground was getting closer and closer. He felt like his heart was about to jump out of his chest, and he was almost suffocating.

Just as he was about to touch the ground, Xia ruofei waved his hand and used some strength to support him. Even so, he still landed firmly on the ground.

Merendo felt a slight warmth between his legs. The sharp – eyed captives around him had already noticed that the once high and mighty person in charge of the training camp had wet his pants ...

The captives around merendo sneaked away from him, mainly because they couldn’t stand the stench.

Xia ruofei glanced at the captives and with a thought, the captives felt an irresistible force. They could not help but be moved by this force.

When this force disappeared, the captives found that they had been divided into five distinct groups, each group with 22 to 23 people.
