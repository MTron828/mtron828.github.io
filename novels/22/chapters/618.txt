Chapter 619: Chapter 454 – helping the world (1)

If it was any other child, they would at least look up if someone was looking at them from such a close distance. However, Chengcheng was still playing with the teddy bear in his hands as if no one was around and ignored Xia ruofei.

“Chengcheng?” Xia ruofei tried to call out.

He had been observing Chengcheng’s reaction. His voice was quite loud, but Chengcheng didn’t even blink, as if nothing had happened, completely immersed in his own world.

Xia ruofei wasn’t surprised. Huanhuan had been like this too.

He muttered to himself for a moment and reached out to pull the teddy bear in Chengcheng’s hands.

Chengcheng immediately hugged the teddy bear tightly, but he finally raised his head and glared at Xia ruofei with hostility. Then, he sprawled on the ground and pressed the teddy bear tightly under his body.

Xia ruofei sighed in his heart.

The last time he saw Huanhuan’s condition, his heart had been greatly shaken. Today, seeing Chengcheng’s condition, which was even more serious, Xia ruofei felt that his heart had been hit hard.

The children of these stars were all very cute and more delicate than ordinary children. If one did not have deep contact with them, one would not have noticed anything wrong with them.

However, if one observed them carefully, they would discover that their eyes were different from ordinary children. They lacked that kind of agility and almost never looked at people in the eye, as if they never had a focus.

Xia ruofei could imagine the suffering of the Star Child’s parents.

Moreover, this kind of suffering was not temporary. Every day as the child grew up, this kind of suffering was everywhere. As the child grew older, the best period of correction would pass, and the deep despair would become heavier and heavier.

Many families would try their best to help their children recover when they were young. However, during the long run, due to the lack of obvious recovery effects or financial reasons, people would constantly give up. In the end, most of the people with autism could only be raised at home, without the ability to live independently. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

......

This was also why most of the children in the rehabilitation centers were two to four years old.

Because these children did not have the basic ability to survive, and their social skills were basically zero, most of them could not go to school normally. Those who were slightly better off might go to special schools, while the severe patients could only stay at home.

If it was accompanied by violent tendencies, it would be an incomparably heavy burden to the family, both physically and mentally.

And when the parents of these patients gradually grew old, or even passed away, their conditions could be imagined.

Xia ruofei looked at Chengcheng with a heavy heart. His mind was no longer on how to treat Chengcheng, but the survival of the whole group of people with autism.

When one was poor, he would be good to himself, and when one was good, he would help the world.

Xia ruofei had the ability to cure Huanhuan and Chengcheng, but thousands of people with autism and their families were still in a helpless, desperate, and endless darkness.

In recent years, the proportion of people with autism had been increasing year by year. Research showed that there would be one in every 150 newborns with autism. This was an extremely huge base.

For the first time, Xia ruofei had the thought of doing something for this group of people.

Of course, he might not have such an ability yet, but he believed that with the upgrade of the spirit map space or the continuous unlocking of the contents of the booklet, he might be able to find a complete solution. He would not need to rely on the petals of the spirit Heart Flower, or only need a very small number of them, to effectively treat autism.

If they could develop a cure for autism, it would be a really great thing.

It’s even more meaningful than curing cancer. Children are the future of this world!

Xue bi Yun was also nervously watching Xia ruofei. She saw that after Xia ruofei had a simple exchange with Chengcheng, he fell into silence. Her heart was extremely nervous and her heart was clenched.

When Xia ruofei stood up, Xue bi Yun quickly stepped forward and asked,””Doctor Xia, how is it?”

Xia ruofei had a warm smile on his face.””Auntie Xue, don’t be nervous, I just want to know Chengcheng’s situation.”

“Doctor Xia, I’ll show you Chengcheng’s medical record then!” Xue bi Yun nodded repeatedly.

Xia ruofei nodded slightly. Although he didn’t need to look at the medical records, Xue bi Yun would feel even more uneasy if he didn ‘t.

Most of the time, Xia ruofei was very considerate of other people’s feelings.

When Xue Biyun went to look for the medical records, Tian Huixin told Xia ruofei sincerely,””Little Xia, I’m really sorry to trouble you this time! It’s not easy for Biyun to take care of her child alone. She’s suffered a lot all these years. She’s also from Mt. Three, so after I got to know her at the rehabilitation Center, we became very good sisters. You have to help her! This is her last hope ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”aunt Huixin, don’t worry!” Since I’ve promised you, I’ll definitely do my best! And ...”

At this point, Xia ruofei looked at Huanhuan who had fallen asleep on the sofa and said, “Didn’t I already have treatment experience before? I don’t think it’ll be a big problem this time!”
