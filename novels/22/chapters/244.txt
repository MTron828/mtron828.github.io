“They’re too rampant! He’s simply lawless!” “Everyone, attack! Does he really dare to hit people?” “That’s right. There are five of us. Are we afraid of him?” The few tax officers shouted angrily. On the other hand, long – haired Shen, who was about to rush over, hesitated. Others might not know, but he had personally experienced Xia ruofei’s terrifying strength. He had no doubt that if Xia ruofei had used just a little more strength, his wrist would have broken. Most of these people had been trained. On the other hand, the five people on his side were either big – bellied or sallow – faced, all sitting in the office all year round. If they were to fight, they would not be enough. The oldest Section Chief, old Yao, did not act rashly. He just stared at Xia ruofei darkly for a while, then gathered everyone and walked to a corner of the office. “Brothers, today’s matter is a little out of our control.” Section Chief Yao frowned and said,”Shen, you should call President Lin and tell him about the situation!” To put it bluntly, Section Chief Yao was still not confident. He had come here on purpose to find trouble, and there was no evidence at all. Even this written notice was printed by him on the office computer, and then he used the official seal for his own use. The procedures were simply not valid. Once the matter was blown up and the higher – ups investigated it thoroughly, they would all be in trouble today. In fact, what happened today was arranged by that long – haired young Shen. Section Chief Yao’s original intention was to form a good relationship with him. After all, Lin Feng was the son of the Deputy Secretary General of the municipal Party Committee. He was also familiar with knocking down a private enterprise and causing them some small trouble. However, he didn’t expect to encounter such intense resistance. Moreover, the other party’s hotheaded youth was completely unmoved by force or persuasion. Therefore, Section Chief Yao naturally didn’t want to make a big deal out of it, for fear of accidentally getting himself involved. Little Shen nodded and took out his phone to call Lin Feng. “Brother Feng, it’s me, little Shen!” Xiao Shen said respectfully. Although Lin Feng wasn’t in front of him, he still had the appearance of a subservient servant. “Oh, Shen!” Lin Feng indifferently asked,”how’s the matter?” “Brother Feng, it was going quite well at first,” Xiao Shen said, a little dejected.”The accounts and computers were all sealed. Just as we were about to move out, their Finance Manager came back with a hotheaded young man ...” “Wait, the manager of the finance department?” Lin Feng replied,”is it Ling Qingxue?” Lin Feng had been eyeing Ling Qingxue for some time now, so he naturally knew about her situation. He knew that she was the Finance Manager of Ling Ji restaurant. “I don’t know her name, but she’s a beautiful long – legged beauty. Oh, she’s the daughter of the boss of this company.” Shen said. “That’s her!” Lin Feng said,”you said that she brought along a hothead?” “Yes, a young man with short hair ...” Then, Shen described Xia ruofei’s appearance. When Lin Feng heard this, he snorted coldly. He knew in his heart that this hotheaded young man was the one he had seen with Ling Qingxue at noon. “What’s wrong with this person?”he asked coldly. “Brother Feng, he’s stopping us from taking the account book and computer away.” Xiao Shen said,”I was even beaten up by him. This man is very barbaric, and he seems to be very good at fighting. Now, both sides are in a stalemate!” Lin Feng’s eyes brightened when he heard this. He hurriedly asked,””You said he made a move?” “Mm! My wrist is still bruised!” Xiao Shen said with some grievance. He was also trying to take credit for his work. He had been entrusted by you to do this, and now he was beaten up because of you. Shouldn’t you return the favor in the future? Lin Feng didn’t care about little Shen’s complaints. Instead, he anxiously asked,””I told you to bring the law – enforcement recorder with you. Did you record the process of his attack?” “I’ve recorded it all!” Xiao Shen quickly said,”we started recording as soon as we entered. We recorded the entire process of the kid violently resisting the law!” “That’s great!” Lin Feng slapped his thigh and said excitedly,”little Shen, with this video, regardless of whether there is a problem with the accounts, we can punish them to death!” “Definitely! Don’t think that Ling Ji F & B will have a good life!” Little Shen said hatefully, then asked tentatively,”brother Feng, should we retreat now? Anyway, with that video, we can do whatever we want to them!” At this moment, the scene of Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue hugging on the street in the afternoon appeared in Lin Feng’s mind. The fire of jealousy in his heart began to burn. A hint of ruthlessness flashed in his eyes as he snorted coldly,””Retreat for what? He hadn’t taken the account book away yet! You guys wait here! I’ll bring people over to help you! Hmph! No matter how good he is at fighting, he’s just one person. If ten isn’t enough, then twenty will come at him together. I don’t believe he can take it!” “Ah?” Xiao Shen hesitated for a moment and said,”brother Feng, this ... Wouldn’t this be too big of a deal ...” “What are you afraid of!” Lin Feng said,”you guys are in the right now, okay? That kid started it first and beat up a government official. No matter what he says, he’s still in the wrong!” “This ... Alright!” Xiao Shen said,”we’ll wait for you here then ...” “Don’t worry! I’ll be there in a moment! Be careful not to let them transfer the account books!” Lin Feng replied. Lin Feng didn’t know that the moment he made this irrational decision, he had already started to run madly on the road to death ... “I know, brother Feng!” Old Yao saw little Shen hang up the phone and quickly asked,””What did President Lin say?” “He’ll immediately bring some people over. ” Xiao Shen said,”brother Feng said that he must take the account book away today. Let’s wait first ...” Old Yao was also a little dumbfounded. He hesitated and said,””He still brought people?” Little Shen frowned and said,”old Yao, brother Feng has spoken, so let’s just wait!” Anyway, if anything happens, he’ll be there to take care of it, what are you afraid of?” Old Yao frowned and sighed before helplessly nodding. This was the only way. If they retreated now, it would be equivalent to them not being on good terms. They would have to bear the risk and not only would they not get any benefits, but they would also offend Lin Feng for no reason. That wouldn’t be worth it. Moreover, old Yao also felt that little Shen’s words made sense. In any case, if anything happened, Lin Feng would be the one to bear the brunt. Wanwan’s father was the Deputy Secretary General of the municipal Party Committee. Hence, the officers of the tax bureau quickly decided to wait for Lin Feng here. On the other side, Xia ruofei called Ling Xiaotian and Ling Qingxue to his side to ask about the situation. Ling Xiaotian told them about the series of events that happened this afternoon, and then told them his own judgment that all of this was due to Lin Wanshui’s methods. Xia ruofei frowned and asked,””Uncle Ling, regarding the preliminaries of the designated reception unit, was there ... No turning point after that?” Ling Xiaotian was stunned for a moment before he smiled bitterly,””What can we do? We also tried to get some people to help, but all of them rejected us. This must be the instructions of the leader, and no one dared to help!” Ling Qingxue gave Xia ruofei a strange look. Xia ruofei naturally understood the meaning behind Ling Qingxue’s gaze and revealed an awkward expression. Xia ruofei felt embarrassed too. Although he did not promise anything, he had already said it. Now that there was no reaction at all, it was a little awkward. What’s with this Xiao Mei? Why was there no movement at all? There must be something fishy about this! Xia ruofei frowned and thought. Now, the situation of Ling Ji F & B had become very critical. It was no longer a problem of just receiving a designated reception unit from the municipal Party Committee. If they didn’t think of a solution soon, it might even cause a great loss to their vitality. Hence, Xia ruofei thought for a moment, took out his phone, and dialed Tian Huilan’s number. ~
