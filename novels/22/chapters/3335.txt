3336 Encounter (2)

And there was still nearly an hour left.

Xia ruofei finally heaved a sigh of relief. He finally had more time this time.

When Xia ruofei first received the task, he felt that it was really difficult to find a Mirage beast on the third level of the trial Pagoda. Later on, as he became more and more proficient in using the trap and kill array to deal with the Mirage beast, his luck seemed to be getting better and better, and the speed of finding the Mirage beast was getting faster and faster.

Based on the speed just now, this trial mission would be completed in 20 minutes at most.

This had greatly increased the time needed to record it, directly cutting it down by about 40 minutes.

Naturally, Xia ruofei was in a good mood. At the same time, he was already looking forward to the rewards that he would receive next.

He checked it out of habit. Just as he was about to put away the materials for the trap and kill array and continue to look for the Mirage beast in another direction, he suddenly saw a figure appear about 800 meters to his right in front of him from the corner of his eye.

Xia ruofei immediately stopped collecting the trap & kill array and looked into the distance with excitement.

Very soon, Xia ruofei could not help but sigh. Even though he was still quite far away, he was too familiar with Ling Qingxue and knew her too well. So, just by looking at the figure from afar, he could already tell that the figure was not Ling Qingxue.

As for whether it was his other companions who had been randomly teleported to this small trial space, he needed further verification.

Not only did Xia ruofei stop collecting the formation, but he also put back the only set of formation materials that he had just collected.

Then, Xia ruofei stared at the direction of the person.

The other party had obviously noticed Xia ruofei as well. He slightly changed his direction and flew straight towards them.

As the distance between them closed, Xia ruofei’s hope was slowly extinguished. He could already see the other party’s face clearly. It was indeed not Ling Qingxue, but elder Shen tianfang of the first heaven society.

Shen tianfang was a veteran elder of the first heaven society. He was a mid – Stage golden core cultivator and his cultivation was very close to the late – Stage golden core.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but smile bitterly. The probability of one in eight was still too small.

This time, things did not go as he wished. He even sacrificed the opportunity to upgrade the energy storage Pearl. In the end, he did not bring Ling Qingxue here. Instead, he brought Shen tianfang along!

However, no matter what, he was an elder of the first heaven society, and he was only a few steps away from completing his mission. This was all thanks to Shen tianfang’s help. Although Shen tianfang’s cultivation was much higher than Xia ruofei ‘s, his actual strength was probably not much stronger than Xia ruofei’ s.

If this task was used as a test, Shen tianfang would obviously fail. Out of the 29 intermediate – Level Mirage beasts that were killed, only four were killed by elder Shen. The rest were completed by Xia ruofei alone.

But no matter what, he had made a contribution, and there was a one in eight chance of meeting him. It could only be said that it was fate!

Hence, Xia ruofei did not stand still. Instead, he quickly walked up to them.

Shen tianfang walked up to Xia ruofei and asked in surprise,””Fellow Daoist Xia, I saw someone here from afar, so I came over to take a look. It’s you, my brother!”

“Nice to meet you, elder Shen!” Xia ruofei smiled.

“Hello, hello!” Shen tianfang smiled and said,”Daoist Xia, how did you get here? Just a second ago, I was still painstakingly searching for the Star Beast, but suddenly, it was as if the stars had shifted, and I arrived in this new space ...”

“It’s a long story. ” Xia ruofei said,”elder Shen, you must have encountered an illusionary formation the moment you entered, right?”

“Isn’t that so?” Shen tianfang said,”I was not careful and almost fell for it! Fortunately, I have some experience in dealing with illusionary formations, so I passed through it without any danger ...”

Then, Shen tianfang said,””Fellow Daoist Xia, after I broke the illusory formation, I received a mission to kill the Mirage beast ... As soon as the illusory formation was broken, a stone tablet appeared in front of me. It was the same as the one I received on the second level of the Tower of Trials. On it was written the mission for this trial. Only then did I know that I had already reached the third level of the Tower of Trials, but I clearly didn’t complete the mission on the second level ...”

Xia ruofei was a little embarrassed as he said,””Elder Shen, this has something to do with me. When I completed the second level of the Tower of Trials, I triggered a hidden reward. I can randomly send one of my companions to the same small space on the third level of the Tower of Trials. I didn’t expect to disrupt the rhythm of elder Shen’s completion of the mission. I’m really sorry ...”

If Shen tianfang had completed the second level’s mission normally, he would have been able to get a reward. Now that he was halfway through the mission and was directly sent to the third level, the second level’s mission reward was naturally gone.

Therefore, Xia ruofei should still express his apology. After all, he had only wanted to meet up with Ling Qingxue as soon as possible, but objectively speaking, he had affected Shen tianfang.

Shen tianfang waved his hand and said,””Fellow Daoist Xia’s words are too serious. I’ve been doing the second level of the Tower of Trials for a long time. Those star beasts are not easy to deal with! I’m still far from completing my mission! Moreover, if he encountered a high – Level Star Beast, he might even lose his life. To be able to directly experience the third level of the Tower of Trials, I have to thank fellow Daoist Xia!”

“I don’t dare! It’s my fault that you didn’t get the reward for the second level mission. It’s already very good that you don’t blame me. ” Xia ruofei said.

Shen tianfang laughed and said,”but fellow Daoist Xia is indeed very powerful!” He completed the second level of the Tower of Trials so quickly and even got a hidden reward ... Besides, the third level of the Tower of Trials should require both of us to work together, right? I’ve just checked the mission stone stele and found that the mission is almost completed!”

Then, Shen tianfang took out a small stone tablet from his storage treasure. The mission content of the third level of the trial Pagoda was recorded on it, and it would also update the mission progress in real – time.

Xia ruofei’s perceptual mirror showed the same mission progress, 29/30.

Shen tianfang smiled bitterly and said,”I’m ashamed to say this. In this mission, more than half of it was completed by fellow Daoist Xia. The Mirage beasts that I killed were not even a fraction of what fellow Daoist Xia did! If I can break the record and complete this mission, then I’ll be taking advantage of fellow Daoist Xia!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”elder Shen, you’re too kind. We’re here to explore the mystic realm together. Of course, there’s no distinction between us. We can’t talk about who’s benefiting from who.”

Shen tianfang took two steps closer and said with a smile,””Fellow Daoist Xia is truly magnanimous! In fact, fellow Daoist Xia’s help was also indispensable in our lunar expedition this time! On the third level of the trial Pagoda, fellow Daoist Xia’s performance was still so amazing. His future was bound to be boundless! In addition, I’m afraid that fellow Daoist Xia will be the one with the biggest stake in this exploration of the secret realm!”

Shen tianfang paused for a moment before he continued,””If the missions on the first two levels are different in terms of cultivation level, then the difficulty will be different. However, the stone tablet clearly states that the missions on the third level are set according to the cultivation level of the person who is higher, and the number will double based on that Foundation. However, fellow Daoist Xia was still able to complete it so outstandingly. I’m truly ashamed of my inferiority!”

“Elder Shen, you flatter me!” Xia ruofei said,”I’m just lucky to have some skills in dealing with the Mirage beasts. If it were star beasts, I might not be as efficient.”

Shen tianfang replied,”Daoist Xia, speaking of star beasts, I did discover some secrets on the second level of the Tower of Trials!” It’s a pity that I didn’t have the chance to explore it further ...”

“Oh?” Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows.”What secret did elder Shen find out?” If you don’t mind, can you tell me a little?”

“Of course, no problem!” Shen tianfang looked around. Although there were only the two of them, he still lowered his voice and said,”I’m on the second level of the trial Pagoda ...”

As he spoke, his voice became softer and softer, and Xia ruofei could not help but pay attention. At this moment, Shen tianfang suddenly burst into action. A flying sword appeared in his hand, and he threw it at Xia ruofei, who was a few steps away.

Under the effect of his mental strength, the flying sword was extremely fast. With a sharp whistling sound, it arrived in front of Xia ruofei in the blink of an eye ...
