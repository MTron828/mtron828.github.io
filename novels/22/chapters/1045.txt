MA Xiong was stunned when he heard that. He asked,””I didn’t expect Xia Sheng to have such a good relationship with brother Tang!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”It’s just a business deal. When your employees went to the farm to appraise the abalones, elder Tang was also a guest at my place. He liked the abalones very much and bought two from me on the spot.”

MA Xiong nodded and said,”Alright! Xia Sheng, since you’ve already said so much ... Then we’ll do as you say!”

After he finished speaking, MA Xiong gave Ma Zhiming a look. Ma Zhiming immediately took out his checkbook, wrote down the numbers, and signed his name.

Xia ruofei took the check and put it in his pocket without even looking at it. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

After MA Xiong got the two abalones, he was also eager to go home. After chatting for a while, he stood up and said,”Xia Sheng, I’ll take my leave first. I’ve arranged a welcome dinner tonight. Please attend it with Chief Steward Feng!”

“Thank you, old Mr. MA!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

After sending MA Xiong and Ma Zhiming off, Feng Jing and Xia ruofei were the only ones left in the huge Presidential Suite.

Feng Jing’s heart started to race as she was alone with Xia ruofei in the hotel room.

Fortunately, the Presidential Suite was very large, unlike ordinary hotel rooms, which only had a bed and a few chairs.

Feng Rao glanced at Xia ruofei and said,””Chairman, I’ll report to you the preparations for the auction these few days and the main process for tomorrow!”

Xia ruofei waved his hand.”I’ll leave the details to you. I’m not worried.”

“But tomorrow, you’re going to ...”

“You’ll be in charge of everything on behalf of the company tomorrow. I won’t be getting involved!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Ah?” Feng Rao couldn’t help but open her mouth wide.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”ah what?” You’re the company’s general manager, can’t you represent the company? Don’t tell me you’re having stage fright?”

In fact, Xia ruofei had already made up his mind before he left. He would avoid such an event as much as he could. There would be so many media reporters there tomorrow. If he appeared on stage, he would be completely exposed in the spotlight. It would not be easy to live a low – Profile life in the future.

Feng Jing was the company’s general manager, and as a woman, she had an innate advantage. Not to mention, Feng Jing had a beautiful image and a good temperament, so she was the most suitable person to attend such an event.

“I won’t have stage fright!” Feng Rao replied without even thinking.

“Then isn’t it settled?” Xia ruofei lay down on the soft leather sofa and said lazily,””You were the one who volunteered to come to Hong Kong ...” He said.

Feng Rao could not help but glare at Xia ruofei and said in a low voice,””You only know how to be lazy ...”

With Xia ruofei’s hearing, he naturally heard it clearly. However, he still pretended to be confused and asked,””What did you just say?”

“It’s nothing!” Feng Rao looked at Xia ruofei unhappily.

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Director Feng, you can handle the details yourself. I have absolute trust in your ability!”

“Okay ...” Feng Jing said.”Chairman, I’ll go back to my room. The auction will start tomorrow, and I still have a lot of things to prepare.”

“Alright, thank you for your hard work, President Feng!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“By the way, there are many rooms in this Presidential Suite. The conditions should be much better than the guest room you’re staying in. Do you want to move in?” he asked.

Xia ruofei regretted it the moment he asked that.

Although the Presidential Suite was surprisingly large, with seven or eight bedrooms of various sizes, a study, a living room, a small kitchen, and so on. It was bigger than most people’s homes, but it could only be considered a hotel room! How could he invite a girl to live with him?

As expected, Feng Rao’s face turned red after hearing his words.
