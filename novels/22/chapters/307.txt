Chapter 308: Elder Tang’s decision (1)

When Liang Weimin said this, elder Tang couldn’t help but be taken aback. Since when did Phoebe zhennan and Chinese cabbage become common? He couldn’t find it after searching for so long, and now he found two? After Liang Weihua heard this, he revealed a mocking smile and said,””For the people, are you sure it’s really big news? I heard that you’ve been trying hard to find one through all kinds of channels this year, but you still couldn’t find one! I just found one here and you immediately found one too, is there such a coincidence?” When Liang Qichao heard this, he didn’t wait for his father, Liang Weimin, to speak. He pouted and said,””Uncle Wei Hua, isn’t this just a coincidence? The Golden Phoebe zhennan material that I found is not only a big material, but also an old material. It seems to be of a higher quality than yours!” Liang Xiaojun, who was at the side, immediately laughed and said,”Qi Chao, are you blind? Now that the price of the Phoebe zhennan was rising, many illegal merchants were using yellow heart Phoebe zhennan or even maple wood to fake it! This piece of material that our family found is already very rare. To say that there’s something bigger than this ... Tsk tsk! I don’t think it’s possible!” After Liang Weimin heard this, he said in a slightly displeased tone,”Xiaojun, you didn’t even see anything. Isn’t it too early to make a conclusion?” “Uncle, I’m just worried that Qi Chao might be cheated!” Liang Xiaojun said,”I know that you guys are more anxious. This will inevitably lead to mistakes in judgment. If you make a wrong judgment, the losses will be huge!” “Xiaojun, you don’t have to worry about this!” Liang Qichao snorted. Liang Weihua chuckled and said,””Qi Chao, you can’t say that! Uncle is so busy. If you ask him to make a trip for a fake you found randomly, wouldn’t that be a waste of time?” Then, Liang Weihua asked again,”brother Weimin, the material you mentioned just now, have you all personally appraised it?” Did you get an expert to examine it?” Liang Weimin furrowed his brows and said,”I didn’t see it, but I’ve seen the photos. It’s indeed a Phoebe zhennan! And the quality is very high!” “A photo?” Liang Xiaojun immediately said exaggeratedly,”uncle, can photos still be trusted these days? Photoshop software can create anything, what’s the use of just looking at photos?” “Xiaojun, be careful with your words!” Liang Qichao said unhappily,”it wasn’t easy for my friend to help me find this material!” He had even gone over to take some photos early in the morning. My friend isn’t that kind of person!” “Qi Chao,” Liang Weihua said with a smile,”your friends aren’t very reliable!” Liang Weimin snorted coldly and said,”Weihua, I don’t like what you’re saying. Why don’t you tell me why Lil Chao’s friends are so unreliable?” It’s not good to make irresponsible remarks!” “Brother Weimin, you should know very well what kind of people Qi Chao’s friends are, right?” Liang Weihua pouted and said. Liang Weimin’s expression was very unsightly. He snorted coldly and said, “I’m too lazy to talk to you guys! Let uncle make his own decision!” Then, Liang Weimin turned to old master Tang and respectfully said,””Uncle, you make the decision! This piece of material had also been found by little Chao with great difficulty, and it had now been transported to San Shan city, which was not far from here. If you’re interested, let’s go and have a look. If you don’t think it’s necessary, then just pretend I never said anything about it. ” Elder Tang chuckled. He had lived for more than 70 years. How could he not see the infighting between the younger generation? However, he naturally wouldn’t show his inclination. After all, Liang Weihua had already found an old material of Phoebe zhennan that barely caught his eye, which could be considered a great achievement. However, Liang Weimin’s family was also sparing no effort in this matter, so of course, they had to be fair. So, even though elder Tang didn’t have much hope for the Golden Nannan material that Liang Weimin was talking about, he still smiled and said,””Then let’s go together! For the people, Qi Chao, it’s been hard on you this time ...” “Uncle, you’re too polite!” Liang Weimin said excitedly,”it’s our honor to be able to help uncle! Then ... When do you think we should go?” When Liang Weihua heard this, he immediately said,”it’s almost mealtime, we can’t let uncle go on an empty stomach, can we?” Besides, I’ve already booked a restaurant! Uncle, why don’t we ... Go and eat first?” Of course, he didn’t want elder Tang to see the Phoebe zhennan that Liang Weimin was talking about. Even though he didn’t think the possibility was high, he was still a little worried, so he tried to delay it as much as possible. However, elder Tang smiled and said,””There’s no hurry to eat. Let’s go and take a look first!” Liang Weihua’s expression froze for a moment, then he smiled awkwardly and nodded. Liang Weimin, on the other hand, was extremely excited. He quickly asked Liang Qichao to contact Xia ruofei. The group of people got into the car and headed towards the warehouse that Xia ruofei had rented. The relatives of the Liang family also followed them. They were not willing to miss out on such a lively event. Liang Weihua’s family even got into their cars, waiting to see Liang Weimin and Liang Qichao make a fool of themselves. As the car drove on the road, Liang Weimin’s heart started to race again. This big talk had been released, but if there was really something wrong with the gold Phoebe material, it would be really embarrassing. “Little Chao, that material ... Is it really fine?” Liang Weimin asked, frowning. Elder Tang and Liang Weihua were in the same car, and Liang Weimin’s family was in it, so he didn’t hold back when he spoke. “Dad, didn’t you see the photos this morning?” Liang Qichao asked. What problems could there be?” “I’ve seen the photos, but I still feel a little uneasy!” Liang Weimin said. He was indeed a little worried. If he did this well, he would undoubtedly gain a lot of points in the old man’s heart. However, if he messed it up, he would lose a lot of points. Liang Qichao said,””Dad! Don’t you worry! Although I have some friends who are not very reliable, RUO Fei is definitely not one of them. He is still very reliable. ” Liang Weimin nodded, but the worry between his brows still hadn’t disappeared. …… In the warehouse that Xia ruofei had rented in the northern suburbs of Jinning District. Xia ruofei had already taken out the Phoebe zhennan material from the medium and placed it in the middle of the warehouse. He took out a recliner from his interspace and was lying on it leisurely, playing games on his tablet. There was a small coffee table beside him with a cup of hot tea on it. After going to Wuyi Mountain, Xia ruofei also started to taste the tea. He felt that the tea seemed to contain all the flavors of life. The more he drank, the more the taste and the more he tasted it, the more he felt. Xia ruofei only returned to the warehouse after receiving Liang Qichao’s call. He had been shopping at the seafood market, hoping to find fish that were suitable for Taoyuan farm. However, after shopping for half a day, Xia ruofei still did not have any clues. He felt that the fish in the market were too ordinary and could not reflect the quality of Taoyuan farm. However, this matter was not very urgent. He had plenty of time to slowly look for one. After about half an hour, Xia ruofei’s phone rang again. It was Liang Qichao. He knew that old master Tang should be arriving soon. He stood up unhurriedly, and with a thought, the recliner, the coffee table, and the teacup on the coffee table disappeared into thin air. They were directly stored into the spirit map space. Everything was placed firmly on the floor of the medium, not even a drop of tea spilled. It was clear that Xia ruofei’s control of the medium was getting better and better. Xia ruofei picked up the phone as he walked towards the entrance of the warehouse after he had kept everything.Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates
