2702 Chapter 1477 – in full swing (2)

After Xia ruofei, Li Yifu, and the others finished their greetings, Liu Qingfeng stepped forward and said gratefully,””Mr. Xia, thank you! My family gave me a call and arranged a very good position for me. ”

Xia ruofei had mentioned Liu Qingfeng’s matter to old master Liu yesterday afternoon. Old master Liu had also attached great importance to it. In the evening, Liu Qingfeng had received a personal call from Liu Qunfeng. Liu Qunfeng’s words were full of praise for his work. At the same time, he had also said that he had prepared a position as the chairman of a subsidiary company for him. He would take the position immediately when he returned home.

Liu Qingfeng knew that the position of the subsidiary company in the group was very important, and the headquarters was in Beijing. It was definitely a rare and lucrative position. In the past, he didn’t even dare to think about such a position, but he didn’t expect to get it.

Naturally, Liu Qunfeng also told him that it was because Xia ruofei had strongly recommended him to the old man that the family had given him this opportunity and platform.

Therefore, Liu Qingfeng was extremely grateful to Xia ruofei. After receiving the news that Xia ruofei was going back to Peach Blossom Island, he ran to the airport before dawn and waited on the tarmac for more than an hour, regardless of the strong wind on the island.

Xia ruofei was slightly stunned. Then, he smiled.””This is what you deserve! Besides, your ability and quality are definitely worthy of the position they’ve given you. ”

“Thank you for your encouragement!” Liu Qingfeng said.

“By the way, although you’ve been assigned to your post, you can’t relax on the affairs of peach source Island! I won’t let you go until I’m done here!” Xia ruofei said half – jokingly,”it’s fine if you’re in Cao’s camp and your heart is in han, but you must be loyal to your duty.”

“Don’t you worry about that!” Liu Qingfeng quickly said,”you know very well what kind of person I am. Everything I do must have a beginning and an end!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”alright, I’ve seen your intentions.” This wind is so strong, don’t stand here and let the cold wind blow. Hurry back to your posts and do what you should be doing!”

Thus, the group of people left the airport by car.

Liu Qingfeng and the others all returned to the project department building, and Tang Hu also directly went to the construction site.

Xia ruofei sat in Li Yifu’s car and returned to the warehouse beside the airport. The warehouse had become the command center of the island transformation project. It was the actual Center of Paradise Island. As for the project department building, it was just a matter of daily administrative work.

In the past two days, Liu Qingfeng had tried his best to persuade Li Yifu to move the island transformation command center to the project department building.

However, Li Yifu knew that there were a lot of things that ordinary people couldn’t know about, so he still declined Liu Qingfeng’s good intentions and insisted on staying in the airport warehouse.

The driver for them was benilatti, so Li Yifu didn’t have to avoid anything. In the car, he couldn’t wait to ask,””Martial granduncle, did everything go smoothly when you returned?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,””The fish has already taken the bait. With a push, the plan can be successfully implemented!”

“That’s great!” Li Yifu slapped his thigh and said excitedly.

Although Xia ruofei did not reveal his plan to him, he had a blind trust in Xia ruofei. Even if he knew that his opponent was a golden core cultivator, he had never doubted him. At most, he was a little worried.

Xia ruofei said,”now, everything is going according to plan. You can’t drop the ball when you’re in charge of the transformation project.” Otherwise, no matter how smooth things are in the beginning, everything will be equal to zero!”

“Don’t worry, senior granduncle!”Li Yifu said with a serious face. This disciple guarantees it with his head! I definitely won’t drop the ball!”

“It’s not that exaggerated. I’ll also stay on Peach Blossom Island for a few days. If there’s anything I miss, I’ll remind you in time.” Xia ruofei said with a smile. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“What’s the progress of the modification project?”he asked.

“According to the construction plan you gave us, the brothers of the Hong sect have been divided into five teams and are working on the construction at the same time!” Li Yifu said,”I’m in charge of the entire transformation project with Tang Hu assisting me. In addition, each construction team has a special person in charge of commanding. The current progress of the project is faster than we expected. By a conservative estimate, it will definitely be completed within two to three days!”

“Very good! I’ll go to all the locations and do a thorough check!” Xia ruofei said,”if there are any problems, we can fix them in time and try to complete the array in three days!”

“Yes! Senior granduncle!” Li Yifu said.

“Benilatti, did Wang Boshan contact you these two days?” Xia ruofei suddenly asked.

Benilatti, who was driving, quickly said,””Mr. Xia, he didn’t contact me!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”if everything goes well, he’ll call you today ... Or tomorrow at the latest!” If he asks about my performance after I arrived at Peach Garden Island, just tell him that I didn’t even have time to rest when I got to Peach Garden Island. I immediately took a helicopter to the capital Island of agate Island!”

“Yes, Mr. Xia, I’ll remember!” Beniladi said.

“Of course, you can’t be too straightforward ...” Xia ruofei chuckled.

“I understand! This is valuable information!” “Of course I can’t tell him for free!” Benilatti immediately said.

“Smart!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”in short, you have to act as yourself. You can’t let him have any doubts!”

“Yes!”

Xia ruofei then said to Li Yifu,””In order to prevent Wang Boshan from having eyes in the agate, I have to go to the capital Island today. Anyway, we will take root in the future, so it is necessary to build a good relationship with our neighbors. I will take it as a way to build up our relationship!”

“Understood, then I’ll inform Liu Qingfeng and ask him to arrange a helicopter to get ready!” Li Yifu said.

The warehouse was very close to the airport, and it didn’t take long for the car to arrive.

This place was now heavily guarded, and without Li Yifu’s permission, Liu Qingfeng could not enter this area at will.

Xia ruofei called the ponautu Minister of Internal Affairs, Evian, and expressed his intention to visit him.

Evian readily agreed to Jian Jia’s request. He had received a lot of benefits from the Liu family over the years and knew that Chinese people were very generous. Xia ruofei was the new Master of Paradise Island, and there would be many opportunities for them to interact in the future. He naturally welcomed the other party to take the initiative to build a relationship.

Although Evian was the Minister of Internal Affairs in name, in a poor country like carnade, he was not particularly busy with government affairs. Evian did not have any particularly important schedule in the morning, so the two sides agreed to meet in the morning. Evian also expressed that he hoped to have lunch with Xia ruofei.

Hence, Xia ruofei gave benilatti a few more words of advice before driving to the project department building.

After Liu Qingfeng received Li Yifu’s call, he immediately made arrangements. Now the helicopter was ready, and the pilot was still Wu Wenhan.

After learning that Xia ruofei was going to visit Evian, Liu Qingfeng volunteered to accompany him.

Although Liu Qingfeng was definitely not a mole, Xia ruofei did not want others to know the contents of his conversation with Evian, so he politely declined.

He took Wu Wenhan’s helicopter and quickly arrived at evates Island, the capital Island of ponautu.

Evian welcomed Xia ruofei warmly, and the two of them went to Evian’s office.

Xia ruofei did not have any other purpose this time. It was purely to bond.

Of course, if Wang Boshan had really planted a spy in the government department of Carnelian, he would get the news that Xia ruoxin had visited Evian as soon as she flew back to Paradise Island, and then they would have a discussion behind closed doors and have lunch together.

This way, he was even more convinced that Xia ruofei was actively coordinating to get the official approval of the transfer of ownership of Peach Garden Island.

The gift that Xia ruofei had prepared for Evian was not tea leaves or porcelain. It was a simple and crude check for 50000 US dollars.

Evian saw the amount on the check and the smile on his face immediately became much warmer. The two of them had a good conversation and even had lunch together. Evian also patted his chest and promised that if Paradise Island needed the official help of the Cornelian Empire, he would spare no effort.

Naturally, Xia ruofei also expressed his thanks.

After lunch, Xia ruofei took a helicopter back to Peach Blossom Island.

...

He didn’t even take a break. Accompanied by Li Yifu and Tang Hu, he immediately began to patrol the locations where construction had been completed.
