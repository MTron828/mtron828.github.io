Chapter 669: Chapter 472 – domineering (1)

“Ah, bureau chief he, I’m really sorry ...” The leader, a man in his thirties, said with a fake smile.”When we were about to leave, chief Lin stopped us and said that he had a plan ... This ... The leader summoned us, so we didn’t dare to disobey!” I’m really sorry ...”

Since he had said so, he kun’s displeasure was not in the best place to show it. He laughed and said,””Haha, chief Qi, it seems that director Lin thinks highly of you! Your future is limitless!”

“You’re too kind ...” Chief Qi waved his hand.”Director Lin is just caring for his subordinates. As his subordinates, we should know our limits!”

Why are you pretending to be a big – tailed Wolf! He kun cursed in his heart, but the smile on his face didn’t fade. He said,””Come here, Section Chief Qi. Let me introduce to you, this is the chairman of the southeast province’s Tao Yuan company, Xia ruofei, CEO Xia. Brother Xia, this is Section Chief Qi Min from the medicine and cosmetics registration division’s Chinese medicine and ethnic Medicine Division. Both of you are young and promising talents. We should get to know each other better later!”

Xia ruofei had been watching coldly from the side for a while. Seeing he kun introduce him, he smiled and reached out his hand.””Section Chief Qi, it’s a pleasure to meet you!”

Qi Min looked down at Xia ruofei, snorted, and nodded slightly as a greeting. He ignored Xia ruofei’s outstretched hand.

Xia ruofei could not help but frown.

The impression that Section Chief Qi gave him was really bad. He had agreed to someone’s dinner party, but he had only arrived at eight or nineo’ clock. Moreover, he was full of nonsense, as if he was the king and he was second. In addition, he greeted them with an arrogant look, which made him feel even more disgusted from the bottom of his heart.

Seeing this, he kun quickly gave Xia ruofei a look and then continued to introduce the other two people to Xia ruofei.

Even though the two of them were neither too friendly nor too cold, they were much better than Qi Min.

One of them was called Lu Ping, a Head of the Department. The oldest was called Guo Ziyang, and he was the Deputy researcher in the Department. His rank was half a rank higher than Qi Min, but it was obvious that Qi Min was the leader among the three of them.

This wasn’t uncommon in the system. A Deputy researcher’s power might not be as strong as a real department head ‘s, and his voice wasn’t as strong as the other party’ s. When he came out, he would naturally follow the other party’s lead.

Moreover, he kun’s main purpose this time was to invite Qi Min to dinner.

......

As the heart – nourishing soup was a type of Traditional Chinese Medicine preparation, after the materials were submitted, the final decision to set up the project would be made by the pharmaceutical and cosmetic Registration Division, the Traditional Chinese Medicine Division, and the Department that Qi Min was in charge of.

He kun quickly invited everyone to take their seats. As for Xue Jinshan and the others, he kun did not even introduce them.

However, Qi Min’s gaze swept over Bai He, and he couldn’t help but take a few more glances. A strange light flashed in his eyes.

Xia ruofei could not help but frown when he saw this.

He kun raised his glass and said,”come, chief Qi, leaders, let’s have a drink together!” It’s fate that we’re able to meet in the capital!”

Qi Min smiled and nodded,”director he, you’re giving me face by thinking of me first when you came to the capital!” We must finish this cup of wine!”

After he finished speaking, Qi Min clinked his glass with he kun ‘s. Then, he turned a blind eye to Xia ruofei and the others and raised his head to finish the glass of wine.

He kun saw all of this and could not help but frown. He felt that Qi Min’s attitude today was a little off. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

He kun had done something similar in the past. After all, the profits of Chinese medicine were considerable. In recent years, many pharmaceutical factories had been developing Chinese medicine.

The authority of the National medicine management Office of Traditional Chinese Medicine naturally rose with the tide.

Director Lin from the National Chinese medicine management Office, which was easy to get in the past, directly refused this time. It was not easy to get Qi Min. Although this small section – Level cadre’s words were relatively polite, the sense of rejection was quite obvious.

Especially when he was with Xia ruofei, Qi Min’s eyes were on top of his head and he did not even take Xia ruofei seriously.

He kun had hinted over the phone that Xia ruofei was different from other pharmaceutical factory bosses. It was the southeast Provincial Party Committee leader who had personally asked for help.

However, Qi Min still didn’t give him any face, which was indeed a little unusual.

He kun was also a shrewd man, so he didn’t show it. He put down his wine glass and laughed,””Leaders, everyone, eat more! Eh? Why hadn’t the Wang Residence’s medicinal cuisine arrived yet? I’ll go and urge him ...”

With that, he kun gave Xia ruofei a look, indicating for him to make a few more toasts. Then, he took his phone and walked out of the room.

He kun walked for more than ten meters and stopped after turning a corner. He took out his phone and made a call.

“Secretary Li, I’m little he!” He kun said enthusiastically.

The person he was looking for was director li of the second food safety supervision division of the general Administration. This was he kun’s long – time friend. Director li used to work in the southeast province’s Food and Drug Administration Department all year round and was also he kun’s old superior.

He kun’s many connections in the headquarters were built up step by step through Secretary li.

Secretary Li’s voice carried a trace of fatigue as he said,””Little he ... What’s the matter?”

He kun’s heart skipped a beat. He suddenly remembered a rumor that he had heard not long ago. In the food safety incident of Yuanshan pharmaceutical, the second division of the food safety supervision had violated the rules many times in the process of handling it, which had caused a very bad impact on society. As the Head of the Department, Secretary li was likely to be held accountable.
