Chapter 1443: Dong Yun’s visit (2)

Translator: 549690339

Dong Yun also heaved a sigh of relief and said,”Alright, if it’s convenient, let’s do it at 9 a.m. Tomorrow!”

“No problem!” Feng Jing said happily,”see you tomorrow!”

“See you tomorrow!”

After hanging up the phone, Feng Jing looked at Xia ruofei meaningfully.

Xia ruofei stared at Feng Rao and said with a bitter smile,””Sister ran, you don’t seem to have asked for my opinion ...”

“A beauty like Dong Yun came to visit you, and you’re going to reject her?” Feng Rao asked. It’s not wrong for me to help you agree to this, right?”

Xia ruofei was speechless and said,”what the hell is this?!” I say ... What is this miss Dong up to?”

“I should be the one asking you that!” Feng Rao smiled and said,”when we met this afternoon, Dong Yun didn’t mention you at all. Why did she suddenly ask to visit you at night ... Ruofei, you didn’t bewitch her, did you?” Or ... For the sake of the company, you didn’t hesitate to sacrifice yourself and used the beauty trap?”

Feng Rao’s words made Xia ruofei speechless. After a long while, he said,””Sister che, your imagination is too rich! “I’ve never seen this elite Dong before. Moreover ... Our company is actively recruiting her. She can make her own choice, but it’s not like we don’t want her! Do I need to use some beauty trap?”

Feng Rao couldn’t help but giggle. She could tell that Xia ruofei didn’t seem to know what had happened either.

“No matter what, this is a good thing,” Feng Jing said. “Who knows what might happen tomorrow?” And I still need to correct you. Looking at the current situation, she’s really the most suitable candidate for our company’s CAO position. It’s not that we don’t want her, but if there’s a chance, it’s best to work hard!”

Feng Jing winked at Xia ruofei and said,””So ... It’s all up to you tomorrow! When it’s necessary, use handsome men ...”

“Stop, stop!” Xia ruofei said hurriedly,”let’s end this topic here!”

Feng Jing couldn’t help but laugh out loud when she saw Xia ruofei’s embarrassed look.

......

The next day, Xia ruofei was still clueless about Dong Yun.

He didn’t even notice the article by the Sanshan Evening News. In fact, the influence of the Sanshan Evening News was still limited. Moreover, due to the angle of the video, although some netizens had raised their own speculations, saying that the brave young man was very similar to Xia ruofei, there were only a few responses and it did not become a hot topic of public opinion.

Since Feng Rao had agreed to meet with Dong Yun, Xia ruofei went to the company’s cafeteria for breakfast after his morning cultivation. Then, he returned to the office to handle some daily matters.

At around 8:50 am, Feng Jing knocked on Xia ruofei’s office door and said with a smile,””Dong Yun has already arrived. Shall we go down and welcome her?”

“There’s no need to make such a big fuss!” Xia ruofei raised his head and said,”we’re a Chairman and a President. Even if she were to join our company, she’d still be a subordinate! What kind of boss welcomes his subordinates?”

“He hasn’t been hired yet, has he?” Feng Rao said nonchalantly,”we’re just taking a few steps. Wouldn’t that make us look like we’re treating the wise with respect?”

“Alright, alright, alright, what you said makes sense!” Xia ruofei smiled bitterly and stood up.

When the two of them arrived downstairs, Dong Yun’s Beetle car had just arrived at the complex.

“Miss Dong, welcome to our company!” Feng Jing took a few steps forward and introduced him with a smile.”This is our company’s Chairman, Mr. Xia ruofei!”

Dong Yun smiled at Xia ruofei and shook hands with him.””President Xia, I’ve heard a lot about you!”

Xia ruofei also smiled and said,”miss Dong, you’re too kind!” Upstairs, please!”

The group came to the reception room next to the chairman’s office. The staff of the administration department had already prepared tea, and the three of them took their seats.

“Miss Dong, may I know why you’re here today?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

Dong Yun looked at Xia ruofei and Feng Jing and said,””President Xia, I’m here to express my gratitude to you!”

Feng Jing and Xia ruofei were stunned by Dong Yun’s words.

Xia ruofei was even more confused. He smiled and said,””Miss Dong, why are you thanking me out of the blue? Is there any misunderstanding here?”

Dong Yun looked at Xia ruofei and said,”of course it’s not a misunderstanding.” President Xia, did you have lunch at the stone pot grilled fish restaurant next to the Wanda Square in the east of the city yesterday? While saving a cleaner, you even got injured?”

In fact, when Dong Yun saw the bandage and gauze on Xia ruofei’s hand, she was very sure.

Xia ruofei was slightly surprised, but he still nodded and said,””There is such a thing, but ...”

“That cleaner is my mother!” Dong Yun said calmly.

“Ah?” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be stunned. Could it be such a coincidence?

Feng Rao’s mouth was wide open as she stared at Xia ruofei. She was in awe of Xia ruofei. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Wasn’t this a little too magical? He went out for a meal and saved a person, and it turned out to be Dong Yun’s mother?

Moreover, it was a little unbelievable that the mother of a famous elite who had returned from abroad would actually be a restaurant cleaner.

In the past, Feng Jing was used to Xia ruofei’s miracles. However, today’s incident had refreshed her understanding of Xia ruofei.

It turned out that this boss who didn’t like to manage things was not only capable, but also very lucky!

Originally, the matter of recruiting Dong Yun had already reached a dead end, and there was basically no hope. But now, with this incident, could it be that there was a glimmer of hope?

Feng Rao’s mind was filled with thoughts while Xia ruofei was still in a daze from the news.

Dong Yun continued,”director Xia, I’m here to express my gratitude!” I know that President Xia is much richer than me, and I can’t give you more gratitude financially. If there’s anything you need me to do, I’ll do my best!”

Feng Jing was screaming in her heart, tell her to join our company! What was there to hesitate about?

Unexpectedly, Xia ruofei smiled and said,””Miss Dong, this is just a small matter. I didn’t know that the cleaning lady was your mother at that time, and I didn’t save her because of your gratitude. In fact, I didn’t have time to think so much at that time, so...I’ve already received your kind intentions. You don’t have to do anything to thank me!”

Feng Jing almost couldn’t help but shout,”Yingying, you didn’t even grab such a good opportunity. What are you trying to do?”

Then, she thought about it again. Could it be that RUO Fei was playing hard to get? It must be like this, this guy has always been full of tricks ...

“Director Xia, it may be a small matter to you, but to me, my mother is more important than anything else!” Dong Yun was also a little surprised. President Xia, I know your company is lacking a boss. If you don’t mind ...”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”Miss Dong, our company is not only short of a Chief Operating Officer, but also a Vice President. We are in desperate need of talents. Moreover, director Feng has communicated with me many times about your situation. We naturally hope that you can join our company. However ... All of this needs to be built on the foundation of your recognition of our company. What we want is a business partner with a common goal, not someone who gives up his career plan to repay a debt of gratitude and is forced to join the company. ”

Xia ruofei looked at Feng Jing with determination and continued,””Last night, President Feng already reported to me about your meeting. I understand your decision very well, miss Dong. So, there’s no need for you to change your career plan because of what happened yesterday. Really, there’s no need for that at all!”

Xia ruofei’s tone was very sincere. Feng Jing and Dong Yun could tell that he was sincere and not playing hard to get.

Feng Rao was a little disappointed, but at the same time, she was deep in thought.

Meanwhile, Dong Yun was in a daze because things had developed in a completely different way from what she had imagined.
