Chapter 1469: Caught on the spot (1)

Translator: 549690339

In fact, Xia ruofei had already seen the fleet of cars, but he didn’t realize that the license plate number of Provincial Party Committee car No. 1 might not necessarily be Xiang A00001. Only people from the local government would be able to recognize song Zhengping’s car at a glance.

When Xia ruofei saw the formation of police cars, he realized that it might be the provincial Party leader’s car. However, it was too late to avoid it.

Song Zhengping was also surprised to see Xia ruofei. He even rubbed his eyes, and the car slowly drove past Xia ruofei.

“Stop the car!” He quickly shouted.

The experienced driver stepped on the brakes subconsciously, and the red flag sedan slowly came to a stop.

The Bureau chief’s car could be said to have a domino effect. The cars behind him naturally stopped one after another. The police car that was leading the way also stopped quickly after driving for a short while.

The security guards all got out of the car and walked towards the red flag car. According to the normal procedure, the car would not stop at this time. Something must have happened.

Song Zhengping ignored the nervous attendants and immediately rolled down the car window.

When Xia ruofei saw the red flag car stop, he already had a bad feeling. When the window slowly rolled down and song Zhengping’s figure was revealed, Xia ruofei smiled bitterly to himself.

He and Song Wei had deliberately kept a low profile. They even pretended not to know each other at Sanshan airport, making it seem like an underground meeting. They did not expect to be caught red – handed by song Zhengping the moment they landed in Tanzhou. This was awkward ...

Song Qiming was also a capable member of the song Department. As a provincial official, he definitely had some connection with song Zhengping. If song Qiming found out about this, how big of a misunderstanding would it cause?

He could only hope that song Zhengping wasn’t that gossipy ...

Xia ruofei took the initiative to bow and said,””Hello, uncle song!”

Song Zhengping could not help but laugh,”so it’s really you, ruofei!” I couldn’t believe it when I saw it just now. Why didn’t you call me first before you came to tan Zhou ... Eh? Wei Wei is here too? You guys are ...”

Song Zhengping’s Secretary sat upright in the front passenger seat. When he heard this, his heart couldn’t help but skip a beat. He couldn’t help but glance at the two people outside the car from the corner of his eye. Someone who could make Secretary song speak in such an intimate and casual tone must have an extraordinary background.

Xia ruofei and Song Wei were embarrassed and did not know how to answer.

Song Wei was a little embarrassed and said,””Hello, uncle song!”

Then, she glanced at Xia ruofei with a blushing face, obviously throwing the difficult question to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei looked even more embarrassed. He said,””Uncle song, we’re just here for a vacation. We don’t have a clear destination, so we’ll just go wherever we want. We didn’t want to disturb you ...”

A meaningful look appeared on song Zhengping’s face as he looked at the young man and woman in front of him. This was undoubtedly the best interpretation of a perfect couple.

Although song Zhengping had heard that Xia ruofei already had a girlfriend, he naturally would not ask.

From the bottom of his heart, he even hoped that Xia ruofei and Song Wei could be a couple. After all, Song Wei was half a member of the song family. In that case, Xia ruofei’s relationship with the song family would be closer.

Xia ruofei was definitely a capable person. His miraculous deeds had shocked song Zhengping. In addition, elder song also liked Xia ruofei, so song Zhengping naturally hoped that Xia ruofei could get closer to the song family.

Now, it seemed that this was about to become a reality.

A young man and a young woman travelling together to a strange place thousands of miles away, and they were very low – Key, obviously not wanting others to know. How could there be no story behind this?

At this thought, song Zhengping couldn’t help but smile.

Xia ruofei saw song Zhengping’s smile and smiled bitterly in his heart. He quickly explained,””Uncle song, it’s not what you think ...”

Song Zhengping chuckled and replied,”I know!” He knew! RUO Fei, since you’ve already met him, you can’t pretend that you’ve never been to tan Zhou! Let’s get in the car!”

Song Zhengping also knew that it was not good for the convoy to stay here for too long, so he invited Xia ruofei to board the car first.

Xia ruofei knew that song Zhengping had caught him red – handed, so it was impossible for him to come and leave quietly. He nodded at Song Wei and the two of them walked over.

Song Zhengping’s Secretary was also very quick – witted. She quickly turned around and said,””Secretary, I’ll go to the back of the car!”

Although the back row could seat three people, he couldn’t occupy the front passenger seat alone and let the Secretary and his two juniors squeeze in the back, right?

“Alright!” Song Zhengping nodded slightly. Tell the driver not to go back to the Provincial Party Committee and to go home directly! Also, call home and ask aunt Huang to prepare some good dishes!”

“Yes, Secretary!” The Secretary replied immediately.

Then, he opened the door and got out of the car. He gestured for Xia ruofei and Song Wei to enter. He was very polite.

Song Wei sat in the front passenger seat while Xia ruofei sat in the back to accompany song Zhengping.

The convoy started moving slowly again and left huanhua airport. They changed their plan and headed for the villa of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee.

As an official of song Zhengping’s rank, and someone from a prominent family, his emotional intelligence was naturally not too low. Therefore, after the two of them got into the car, song Zhengping did not continue asking about their sudden appearance in xiangnan province.
