The Secretary quickly said,”District head he, the district Committee has informed us that Secretary song is about to end his conversation. They have asked the members of the team to go to the hospital to send Secretary song off.”

“I know!” He Feng said.

He immediately tidied up his clothes and quickly left the office.

The district Committee and the district government were in the same compound, but they were in two different office buildings. The distance between the two buildings was not very far. After he Feng took the elevator down, several district government leaders had also come down. Everyone walked in the direction of the district Committee Office building.

After a while, a lot of people gathered in the lobby of the district committee’s office building. These were the Deputy leaders of the district government, People’s Congress, and Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference. Everyone stood there in groups of two or three and chatted, their eyes looking at the elevator from time to time.

As they chatted, many people looked at he Feng with curious and envious eyes. The scene at noon had long been seen by these political – sensitive leaders.

After waiting for more than ten minutes, someone received a call to inform them that song Qiming and his group had come out.

Everyone also saw that the elevator had stopped on the floor of the small conference room of the district Party Committee and was starting to go down.

As a result, the leaders who were scattered in the hall immediately lined up in two rows, as if there was an invisible hand directing these people. They found their seats according to their positions and ranks without any error.

When everyone stood still, the elevator reached the first floor. Song Qiming took the lead and walked out of the elevator. Behind him were the main leaders of the district Party Committee and accompanying staff. The group of people walked out in a grandiose manner.

When they reached the hall, song Qiming stopped and said to the district Committee Secretary, Jiang Changhe,””Comrade Changhe, let’s stop here!”

“Secretary, don’t you want to stay for dinner?” asked Jiang Changhe. The canteen has already ...”

“No, no, no!” Song Qiming waved his hand and laughed heartily.”My wife and my girl just arrived at San Shan today. I have to report to them as soon as possible!”

The district leaders immediately cooperated and let out just the right laughter.

“If that’s the case, then we won’t dare to keep you!” Jiang Changhe said with a smile. Secretary, take care!” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Song Qiming smiled and nodded. He shook hands with Jiang Changhe and the others, then walked to the door with his Secretary and attendants.

The district leaders who had received the notice and rushed over were waiting near the entrance. When song Qiming walked over, he shook hands with them one by one.

When song Qiming walked to he Feng and extended his hand, he Feng quickly held song Qiming’s hand tightly and said in a low voice,””Secretary song, I’ve done what you asked me to do. I’ll accompany Mr. Xia to the school tomorrow morning to complete the registration procedures.”

Song Qiming stopped in front of he Feng. He smiled and nodded.”Alright, comrade he Feng, thank you for your hard work ...”

He Feng was overjoyed and quickly said,””Secretary, you’re too kind. It’s nothing ...”

“En!” Song Qiming nodded and said,”I’ll leave this to you. Remember, you must satisfy Mr. Xia. This is my only request.”

“Understood, I will remember your instructions!” He Feng quickly said.

After hearing what song Qiming said, Xia ruofei’s image in he Feng’s heart grew even higher.

Song Qiming nodded, then walked over to the other district leaders who were waiting to shake hands.

He Feng was still standing in the line, and his expression was also very calm, but his heart was already surging with emotions.

Song Qiming purposely stayed by he Feng’s side for a while and said a few words to him. Even though the two of them had lowered their voices and no one could hear what they were saying, he Feng could clearly feel that the district leaders were looking at him with a meaningful look.

This included the head of the district party, Secretary Jiang Changhe.

He Feng was already overjoyed ...
