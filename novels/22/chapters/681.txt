Chapter 682: Miracle doctor Xia conquered a new field (2)

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment, then he laughed.

He stood up and said,””Alright, general Zhao, the inspection is complete!” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“This is it?” Zhao Cheng could not believe it. “Aren’t you going to take a look at my huge stack of reports?”

“It’s a report from Western medicine. I don’t understand it either.” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”let’s go! I’ll go and prepare the prescription now. By the way, do you have the common Chinese medicine here?”

“There are!” Zhao Cheng said,”I’ve set up a Chinese medicine room on the first floor. You can go and get whatever you need!”

“That’s much more convenient!”

The two of them walked out of the door together. Jin Feng and song Rui both came up to them.

“How is it?” Song Rui asked.

“No problem,” he said. Xia ruofei said calmly,”I’ll start taking the medicine today.”

“By the way, general Zhao.” Xia ruofei suddenly turned around and asked,”does your rule say that anyone with diabetes must be transferred from the front line of combat, or does it have to be serious to a certain extent? Do you have a specific standard?”

Zhao Cheng laughed bitterly.”There are no specific standards for this. However, generally speaking, if it can be controlled by taking the medicine, then it’s not a big problem. However, for someone like me who even has an insulin pump installed, I will definitely have to be adjusted.”

“I understand.” Xia ruofei nodded and said,”in other words, my top priority is to reduce the severity of your diabetes. As long as you don’t need to use an insulin pump, then at least the higher – ups won’t have any reason to transfer you away, right?”

“Yes, yes!” Zhao Cheng said agitatedly,”doctor Xia, do you really have a solution? Then ... How long do you need?”

......

Xia ruofei smiled.”If you want to be cured, it will take a little longer. However, it’ll only be separation from the insulin pump. It’ll take a week at most!”

“That’s great!” Zhao Cheng clapped his hands and said excitedly,”Jin Feng, immediately bring Dr. Xia to the pharmacy downstairs to get the medicine!” If doctor Xia has any requests, you must fully cooperate!”

Jin Feng also revealed an excited expression. He tried his best to stick out his chest and said,””Yes!”

Then, he made an inviting gesture to Xia ruofei.””Doctor Xia, please!”

Xia ruofei said to Zhao Cheng,”general Zhao, you should have an empty room here, right?” For the convenience of treatment, I’ll be staying at your place for the next week. ”

Xia ruofei was still thinking about that realm stone! Before he got his hands on the world stone, Xia ruofei did not dare to leave the villa. He had to prevent the world stone from leaving the sensing range of the spirit map.

It was better to be safe than sorry.

If something had really happened to the world stone in the past few days, such as Zhao Cheng losing it on a whim or a guest suddenly leaving ...

Although the possibility of such an accident was extremely low, Xia ruofei would not allow it to happen.

“Yes, yes, yes! There are plenty of rooms!” Zhao Cheng laughed heartily.”I’ve already prepared it for Dr. Xia. You can stay as long as you want!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said to song Rui,””Song Rui, you don’t have to keep an eye on this side. Go and do what you have to do. When you’re done, you can go back to the three mountains! I’ll go back by myself after the treatment here is over. ”

“Alright!” Song Rui nodded and said,”then I’ll leave uncle Zhao in your care!”

“Don’t worry!” Xia ruofei said,”when we go back, tell elder song not to worry. I will definitely be able to cure general Zhao’s illness!”

“No problem! Go and prepare the medicine first! The earlier he’s cured, the earlier uncle Zhao can be at ease. ” Song Rui said.

“En!”

Jin Feng brought song Rui to the first floor.

He opened a large room and immediately smelled a familiar scent of Chinese medicine. A row of large cabinets almost took up an entire wall. There were small drawers on the cabinet, and each drawer had the name of the medicine written on it.

It was the Traditional Chinese Medicine cabinet.

Xia ruofei suspected that Zhao Cheng had really moved the Chinese medicine room from a military hospital here.

However, he didn’t care much. It was fine as long as he had the Chinese medicine he needed.

“The Yimu grass ... Is here! Where was the red peony? What the hell ... That high! Where’s the ladder? Atractylodes, arrowroot, haha, they’re all here! Let me see, there’s also prepared land, wood, Chinese yam ...”

Xia ruofei mumbled to himself as he searched for the herbs he needed.

When he came across some herbs that were hard to buy or often used, Xia ruofei did not stand on ceremony and kept them in the spirit map space.

Xia Qing, who was in the space, naturally sorted them out on the medicine rack.

Not only was the variety of Chinese medicine here more complete, but the quality was also obviously higher than those bought from other Chinese medicine shops. Xia ruofei was even more certain that these were from the military hospital.

There was a full set of medicine – decocting tools in the room.

Xia ruofei quickly made a medicinal soup with the selected herbs. It was a prescription for improving blood circulation and lowering blood sugar. It was also beneficial for ordinary diabetes patients.

Of course, after Xia ruofei added some ingredients, the soup was different.

A bowl of blood – promoting and blood – lowering soup had become a “miracle medicine” that could cure diabetes.

Xia ruofei pretended to be tired and opened the door.

Jin Feng immediately came up to him.

Xia ruofei turned around and pointed at the bowl of medicinal soup on the table.””Find someone to bring it to general Zhao to drink. Colonel Louis, where’s my room? I’m a little tired and need to rest. ”
