Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei briefly reported the situation to Guo Zhan over the phone. When Guo Zhan heard that Xia ruofei had gone to Luo Jiashan in person and that Lin Yue ‘e had agreed to work at the peach blossom company, and that Xia ruofei had brought the whole family to the farm, he was very happy.

He laughed and said,”Blood Wolf, you did a good job this time!” The next time we meet, I’ll give you a toast!”

“Do you think I would dare to not do my best to complete the task assigned by the wolf King?” Xia ruofei said lazily.

Guo Zhan was silent for a moment, and then seriously said,”Blood Wolf, thank you ... I thank you on behalf of all the brothers of lone wolf. At the same time, I would like to thank you personally!”

Squad leader Luo had followed Guo Zhan out on a mission and had sacrificed himself to protect him, so Guo Zhan had always felt a little guilty in his heart. He really wanted to help squad leader Luo’s widow, but Lin Yue ‘e insisted on not accepting it.

Now that Xia ruofei had helped him fulfill this wish, Guo Zhan was very excited.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Wolf King, we’re brothers for life. Don’t say such polite words! Don’t worry, sis – in – Law is in my company, I’ll take good care of her family. Come and visit them when you’re free ...”

“Alright! I’ll try to take a few days off!” Guo Zhan said straightforwardly.

After talking to Guo Zhan, Xia ruofei also walked to the entrance of the villa.

As soon as he entered the house, Hu Zi’s mother and Lin Qiao both stood up and asked him about the situation.

When they found out that Xia ruofei had settled Lin Yue ‘e and her family, Hu Zi’s mother nodded and said,””Ruofei, invite their family over for a meal tomorrow!”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and nodded.”Alright! I’ll tell sister – in – Law about it tomorrow. ”

Xia ruofei continued,”Godma, Qiao’ er, you guys can continue watching TV!” I’ve been sitting in the car the whole day, so I’m going up to rest ...”

“Go, go! Don’t forget to do it tomorrow!” Hu Zi’s mother said,”I have to see what else is in the refrigerator. If not, I’ll go to town tomorrow to buy some ...”

Xia ruofei saw Hu Zi’s mother so eager to prepare the dishes for tomorrow. He couldn’t help but smile and shake his head. He greeted Lin Qiao and quickly went upstairs.

After returning to his room, Xia ruofei went to the bathroom to take a shower to wash away the dust and fatigue. He changed into a clean set of short – sleeved shirt, shorts, and home clothes. He sat in front of the computer and lit a cigarette. After browsing the news for a while, he turned off the computer and went to sleep.

After a long day of driving, Xia ruofei felt a little tired. He decided not to practice drawing the human – shaped jade talisman in the medium.

……

The next morning, Xia ruofei came to the mixed – use complex and invited Lin Yue ‘e and her family to the canteen for breakfast. He also helped them apply for a meal card and asked pang Hao to top up 600 Yuan.

Lin Yue ‘e asked for money. Xia ruofei smiled and said,””Sister – in – Law, just deduct it from your salary. The finance department will take note of it!”

“Yeah, sis – in – Law!” Pang Hao nodded. You’ll know when the payslip comes. ”

Lin Yue ‘e nodded.”That’s fine. Don’t forget to deduct the money!”

“That won’t happen!” Pang Hao said with a smile. If I forget to deduct this money, then the account balance will not be fair. Won’t I have to pay for it myself? So I will never forget. ”

From the very beginning, Xia ruofei had been emphasizing on the concept that the company was doing things according to the system and had not given Lin Yue ‘e any special treatment.

Of course, in reality, Xia ruofei still gave her some care. For example, she took on the position of a supervisor as soon as she joined the company. This was almost impossible for a newbie without work experience.

It was the same for the apartment. This kind of two – bedroom apartment was usually reserved for the company’s top management. However, Xia ruofei had given the empty apartment to Lin Yue ‘e with just one word.

This was the advantage of being a private company. The whole company belonged to Xia ruofei. No one would tell him what to do, and there would be no rumors.

After the meal, Xia ruofei drove a small electric car that Lei Hu and the rest usually used to patrol and brought Lin Yue ‘e and her family on a tour of the farm.

When Lin Yue ‘e arrived at the farm the day before, it was already dark. Furthermore, she couldn’t tell anything from the view outside the car window. She only felt that the farm was huge.

After today’s visit, they found out that the level of modernization of Taoyuan farm was so high. Rows of expensive, professional, constant – Temperature greenhouses, brand new cold storages, beautiful park planning, and magical pomfrets cultivation workshops ... All of these had shocked them again and again.

On the way, Xia ruofei told Lin Yue ‘E that his godmother had invited them to lunch.

When Lin Yue ‘e heard that Xia ruofei’s godmother was Lin Hu’s mother, and that Lin Hu’s younger sister was living on the farm, she immediately agreed without hesitation.

Lin Yue ‘e still remembered that soldier who was in the same year as Xia ruofei. Back then, he had also called her’ sister – in – Law ‘very sweetly. When she heard that Lin Hu had sacrificed himself, Lin Yue’ e had been sad for a long time.

And now, class monitor old Luo had also sacrificed himself, becoming a martyr like Lin Hu. Lin Yue ‘e felt the same way as Hu’ er’s mother, and she also felt a sense of closeness to Lin Hu’s family.

After Lin Yue ‘e agreed to have lunch with them, Xia ruofei called home and informed Hu Zi’s mother.

In the end, Xia ruofei brought them to the orchard that Lin Yue ‘e would be in charge of in the future. They sat in the battery – powered cart and made a round. This allowed Lin Yue’ e to have a general understanding of the place where she would work.
