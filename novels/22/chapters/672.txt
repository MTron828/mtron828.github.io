Chapter 673: Things don’t happen overnight (1)

As a senior leader, he kun naturally had a good grasp of propriety.

Therefore, he did not exaggerate and started with the project with Xia ruofei. After briefly introducing the heart – nourishing soup project, he kun went straight to the point. He told him how he had been rejected by chief Lin and had gone for the second best to invite Qi Min and the others, as well as how Qi Min and the others had arrived late, and how arrogant and domineering they had been.

Song Rui was still leaning against the door of the private room with a harmless and casual smile on his face. No one could tell the change in his mood.

On the other hand, fourth brother’s expression was getting uglier and uglier. It was so dark that it was about to drip water. The gaze he shot at Qi Min and the other two was like a sharp sword, as if he wanted to cut them up alive.

This time, young master Song has returned to the capital, and I’ve finally managed to invite him to the Prince’s Mansion to have a drink with me. This is a heaven – sent opportunity! How could it be so easy to invite a God like young master Song?

Although fourth brother and song Rui were both children of officials, they were not on the same level.

Fourth brother’s father was only a Deputy – Level cadre, and he wasn’t even a high – ranking local official. Compared to a behemoth like the song family, Deputy bureau chief Zeng’s background was simply not enough.

To put it more realistically, if Deputy bureau chief Zeng wanted to take the initiative to get close to him, the song family would have to consider whether to accept him or not.

Moreover, Deputy bureau chief Zeng was now on the verge of making progress. Whether he could cross the threshold of the Ministry level would depend on the recent period.

Therefore, when his fourth brother reported to his father that he had invited the song family’s young master, song Rui, Deputy bureau chief Zeng was quite surprised. He repeatedly urged him to receive young master Song well and to build a good relationship with him step by step.

Initially, everything was going quite smoothly, but now, it was suddenly ruined by Qi Min and the other idiots. Fourth brother really wanted to kill them!

After he kun finished telling the truth, he shut his mouth.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”song Rui, that’s the basic situation. Brother he has explained it very comprehensively.” I originally wanted to use the normal method to get things done, but I didn’t expect the difficulty to be so much greater than I imagined. ”

......

“It should be!” Song Rui said,”who told you to seek death? Don’t even talk about informing our family’s old master, even if you were to tell me, wouldn’t it only take a sentence? Now do you know what it means by “the King of Hell is easy to see but the little devil is hard to deal with”?”

“Woof! So elder song is the King of Hell in your eyes?” Xia ruofei said with an exaggerated expression.

Xia ruofei joked with song Rui casually. With their relationship, there was no need for them to fawn on each other. Besides, in song Rui’s eyes, he had always treated Xia ruofei as an equal. Just Xia ruofei’s superb medical skills alone was worth making friends with.

Moreover, song Rui knew how important Xia ruofei was to elder song.

This scene fell into fourth brother’s eyes, but it set off a turbulent wave in his heart.

It turned out that CEO Xia was not only on good terms with young master Song, but he was also on good terms with the entire song family, and even elder song himself!

This elevated Xia ruofei’s status in fourth brother’s heart by several levels. He was even elevated to the same status as song Rui. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

After all, for an outsider to be able to speak directly to elder song and maintain a good relationship with a political family like the song family, this person must be extraordinary.

Song Rui ignored Xia ruofei’s deliberate misunderstanding. He turned to fourth brother and said calmly,””CEng Xiao si, the drug Administration is your territory. How you want to give my brother a satisfactory explanation is up to you.”

Fourth brother quickly nodded and said,”don’t worry, young master Song. I’ll do it well. Otherwise, I’ll jump into Yongding River myself without you and President Xia asking!”

Fourth brother’s words were full of killing intent. Basically, he was bringing his head to see her.

However, the heads mentioned here were obviously the heads of Qi Min and the others.

Before fourth brother could say anything, Qi Min’s legs turned to jelly and he almost collapsed to the ground. He stumbled a few steps forward and pleaded with a crying face,””President Xia, we were blind. We didn’t recognize Mount Tai! I beg you to forgive us and let us go this time ...”

Lu Ping and Guo Ziyang’s faces were also drained of color as they pleaded pitifully at the side.

If Xia ruofei had not seen the faces of these three people just now, he might have felt a little pity for them. However, he had just experienced the domineering scene of several officials of the National Ministry. Furthermore, Qi Min had even set his eyes on the female employee, Bai He. How could Xia ruofei let them go just because they begged for mercy?

Xia ruofei frowned, but before he could speak, fourth brother chided,””Qimin, don’t you think you’ve embarrassed yourselves enough? Get out of here!”

“Fourth brother, we ...” Qi Min said with a long face.

“Get out!” Fourth brother shouted in a low voice, his face as dark as water.

Qi Min and the others could only leave the private room in despair.

Just as they were walking out, Xia ruofei said indifferently,””By the way, Section Chief Qi just said that as long as he is in the National Medicine Department, my project will not pass. I also said at the time that I would just kick him out of the National Medicine Department ...”

Fourth brother said without hesitation,”President Xia is reasonable!” That’s how it should be done!”
