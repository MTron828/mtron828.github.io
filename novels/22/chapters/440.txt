Chapter 441: Housewarming (2)

At this time, Xia ruofei was sitting in the taxi. The car was about to reach Taoyuan farm. He looked at the caller ID and picked up the phone with a smile.

“Xia ruofei, guess what my mom told me?” Lu You asked happily.

Xia ruofei smiled.”Miss Lu, I can feel your joy even through the phone. It must be something good, right?”

“Mm! Not only did my mom not scold me, but she also promised me that she would stop urging me to date song Rui during my university days. ” Lu You said happily,”Xia ruofei, that trick of yours worked! It seems that my mom is really scared this time ...”

Xia ruofei was speechless. He had scared his mother so badly, yet he was still so happy. This was the legendary naughty child!

“Don’t talk nonsense! When have I ever given you any advice?” Xia ruofei said,”this is all your own idea!”

He couldn’t admit to this even if he was beaten to death. If Tian Huilan found out, wouldn’t she hate him to death?

Lu You chuckled and said,”you’re the one who taught me this!” Xia ruofei, why don’t you just stay on the farm? let’s have a meal to celebrate!”

Xia ruofei quickly said,”let’s not eat!” I have a lot of things to do at my farm, and I’m almost there. Do you have the heart to make me go back?”

Lu You’s eyes flashed with a hint of disappointment. She pouted and said,””If you don’t come, I’ll tell my mom that you were the one who taught me to say those words today!”

Lu You was in a rather good mood today. She felt as if a heavy rock that had been weighing down on her for the past few days had been lifted. When she spoke to Xia ruofei, she was a little unruly like before.

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly and said,”miss Lu, you can’t be like this!” Aren’t you burning the bridge after crossing the river and killing the donkey when the grinding is done?”

Lu You chuckled and said,”aren’t you a donkey?” And it’s a dumb donkey!”

At this point, Lu You’s eyes could not help but have a strange look.

However, even someone as smart as Xia ruofei did not understand the hidden meaning behind Lu You’s words. He only smiled bitterly and said,””Lu You, I really can’t do it today. Lei Hu knows that I’m in jail. My brothers must be worried about me now! Another day! I’ll treat you to a meal some other day!”

If it was in the past, Lu You would not have let Xia ruofei off so easily.

But today, she acted differently. She thought for a moment and said,””Alright! Then it’s a deal! I’ll be waiting for your treat!”

Xia ruofei felt like he had been granted Amnesty and quickly said,””Good, good, good! I’ll treat you to a private meal another day!”

When Lu You heard the word ‘alone’, her eyes immediately lit up and she said,””Mm! I’ll hang up first ...”

After she finished speaking, she quickly hung up the phone and held the phone in front of her chest. Her heart was still beating fast and a bright smile appeared on her face. After a long time, she put the phone away and hummed a song softly before driving away from the municipal Party Committee compound.

Xia ruofei alighted at the entrance of Taoyuan farm. Lei Hu, who had been guarding the entrance, immediately came out from the security room and asked,””Brother Xia, the police didn’t make things difficult for you, right?”

Xia ruofei smiled.”It’s nothing. They’re just here to understand some things.”

Lei Hu thought to himself,”he’s even handcuffed. How can he just understand the situation?” However, since the boss didn’t say anything, he naturally wouldn’t get to the bottom of it.

Xia ruofei then asked about the farm.

Fortunately, Lei Hu followed his instructions and did not spread the news of him being taken away by the police. Even on pang Hao’s side, Lei Hu only said that Xia ruofei had something to do and had put him in charge of the farm temporarily. Hence, everything on the farm was running as usual and there was no chaos.

Only then did Xia ruofei relax. He praised Lei Hu and then walked towards the villa on the farm.

……

In the following days, Xia ruofei’s life returned to normal.

Other than inspecting the construction site, the greenhouse, and the orchard on the farm, he rarely interfered with the general specific Affairs. He spent most of his time reading books, surfing the internet, and of course, taking care of the animals and plants in the interspace.

Lei Hu still drove to Mount Wuyi to deliver medicine to li Zhifu regularly. Every time, he would bring back news that ye Lingyun was studying at Mount Wuyi.

What made Xia ruofei happy was that under li Zhifu’s hands – on teaching, ye Lingyun’s learning progress was very fast. The facts proved that he was indeed quite talented in making tea. Li Zhifu’s unique skills could be considered to have a successor, and Xia ruofei was about to gain a great master.

Xia ruofei would also return to the city from time to time, mainly to go on dates with Ling Qingxue.

People in love would love to stick together all day, but they both had their own careers, so they could only meet occasionally.

Of course, this did not affect their relationship. On the contrary, almost every time, absence makes the heart grow fonder, and they would have sex in the hotel room that Xia ruofei had booked in advance. Every time, it would end with Ling Qingxue panting and begging for mercy.

The body tempering soup strengthened Xia ruofei in all aspects, including his ability in that aspect.

During this period of time, Xia ruofei would take the body tempering soup and the spirit nurturing soup on time when the time was right. His body and spiritual power were constantly improving.

However, after drinking the soup twice, Xia ruofei was still unable to restore the contents of the fourth page of the booklet. As for the spiritual spirals described on the third page, Xia ruofei was still unable to see the whole picture.

However, according to the information he had now, this “soul puppet” seemed to be different from anything that Xia ruofei had obtained before. He could feel the magic of this thing from the description in the booklet.

Xia ruofei’s appetite had been whetted, and he was looking forward to the contents of the fourth page.

The days passed uneventfully for more than ten days. The new complex on the farm was finally completed. Liang Weimin personally asked about it and sent the best team. The workers worked in almost three shifts, so the progress of the project was surprisingly fast.

This was Tao Yuan farm’s first new building, so Xia ruofei still held a ribbon – cutting ceremony.

He had invited quite a few special guests.

Xia ruofei invited his future father – in – Law, Ling Xiaotian, the chairman of the Ling Ji F & B, President Zheng of Xi Jiang Yue, Liang Qichao’s father, Liang Weimin, and others. In addition, the executive deputy head of Changping County, Wu Liqian, the deputy head of jianggang town, Wu Gang, and the director of Dongkeng village, ruan Fugui, were also on the list.

The words “Taoyuan farm complex’s ribbon – cutting ceremony” were pasted on the inflatable arch. Rows of chairs were placed neatly below. The main participants of the ribbon – cutting ceremony were the construction workers, the workers of Taoyuan farm, and the guests invited by Xia ruofei.

The workers had all changed into clean and tidy clothes, and each of them was sitting in their seats excitedly. There were more than 30 apartments in this complex building. Even the local workers, such as Cao tieshu and the others, were given a room for lunch, but it was the kind where a few people lived together.

As for Lei Hu and the others, each of them would be given a small apartment with one bedroom and one living room. Although the area was not large, it was already super good compared to the security guards of other companies.

There was also a staff cafeteria on the first floor of the complex. When it officially opened in the future, all employees would be able to enjoy a free lunch.

There were many flower baskets on both sides of the arch. They were all sent by President Zheng, Ling Xiaotian, and the others in the name of their respective companies. Dongkeng village and jianggang town were also very supportive and sent flower baskets.

Xia ruofei had also changed into a well – ironed suit today. He was standing in front of the building to welcome the guests personally.

Just as Xia ruofei was chatting with Wu Gang and ruan Fugui, a black Passat car silently drove into the small square in front of the building.

Before Xia ruofei could react, Wu Gang’s eyes had already lit up. He quickly walked up to them with ruan Fugui.

Xia ruofei took a closer look and saw Wu Liqian, who was dressed in a beige business suit, getting out of the car with a smile on her face. At this time, Wu Gang had already jogged over to Wu Liqian. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but exclaim,”these officials are really good at reading people and their reaction speed is too fast!”

Wu Liqian responded to Wu Gang and ruan Fugui’s greetings with a reserved smile on her face. Then, she walked towards Xia ruofei, the smile on her face gradually spreading.
