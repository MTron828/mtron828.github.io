3349 Thousand illusionary array (1)

Bason stood in the array in a daze. The moment the thousand illusion array was activated, Bason suddenly felt his vision turn black. The clear sky turned into a pitch black environment.

Bason screamed in fear.

It was really pitch black. Ong put his hand in front of his eyes, but he couldn’t see a single trace.

Ong thought he was blind and shouted in fear,””Master, please spare me! Master, please spare me! I don’t want to be blind ...”

As soon as he finished speaking, the environment in front of him immediately changed again.

Bason found himself standing under the bright sun. There was green grass under his feet. He could even smell the fragrance of the grass. Everything was peaceful and warm.

A few seconds later, Bason’s vision blurred and the environment changed again. This time, it was a World of Ice and snow. He was only wearing a thin shirt. He shivered from the cold and his teeth chattered.

In a short while, ice had appeared on his eyebrows, and his whole body trembled and curled into a ball. If this went on any longer, he would probably freeze to death here.

Fortunately, the ice and snow environment only lasted for a while. Soon, he was surprised to find that the boundless ice field had turned into a tropical jungle. There was even a hot spring in the jungle, gurgling water and steaming hot air.

The tropical forest environment was maintained for more than ten seconds, and then a new environment appeared ...

Ong was completely dumbfounded. How could the surrounding environment change so much? It was like a movie.

Besides, how could a movie be so real? It was like he was in this world. Those so – called 3D and 4D movies simply couldn’t be compared to it.

Ong didn’t know what had happened, but he knew it had something to do with Xia ruofei. No matter how much pain and panic he felt, he only dared to scream and not curse.

To an ordinary person, this was indeed an unbearable torture.

After more than a dozen scenes, just as Bason was about to have a mental breakdown, everything finally came to an end.

Bassoon’s vision blurred, and he was back in his original environment. Xia ruofei was standing not far away from him with an indifferent expression. The bright sun shone on him, making him feel exceptionally warm.

Although he was just standing in the same place, almost motionless, it was as if he had just run a ten – kilometer cross – country run with a heavy load. His whole body was soaked in sweat, as if he had been fished out of the water.

Xia ruofei beckoned to Ong. Ong felt like he had been granted Amnesty. He jogged to Xia ruofei and said weakly,””Master, do you have any orders?”

Xia ruofei said indifferently,”you’ve basically completed your task. There’s only one more task left. I want you to tell me what you’ve just experienced in detail. You’re not allowed to miss out on any details!”

A trace of fear flashed in Bason’s eyes. Everything that he had just experienced was like a nightmare. He could not help but tremble when he recalled it.

However, since it was Xia ruofei’s request, he did not dare to disobey. He quickly nodded and said,”Yes! Master! This subordinate just ...”

Bason suppressed his fear and described the scene to Xia ruofei in detail. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Master, that’s the general situation,” Bason said.”If there’s anything else you want to know, just ask!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”not bad!” Bason, you can go back. Of course, if you want to stay here, you can. After all, you have helped me a lot just now, so I can set you free. If you go back, I’ll ask Xia Qing to give you an extra hundred points. ”

A hint of struggle flashed in Bason’s eyes. He had been locked up in the spirit map space to do hard labor every day. That kind of life had lasted for two years. It was impossible for him to not want freedom.

However, he had been a top – tier assassin before. Although Xia ruofei’s tone was calm, he could hear a trace of killing intent.

Therefore, Ong only hesitated for a moment before saying,””Master, I’m willing to go back and serve you for the rest of my life! This is your subordinate’s honor!”

Xia ruofei’s eyes flashed with satisfaction. He nodded and said,””Alright, since you’ve chosen to go back, I’ll send you back. Don’t worry, the 100 points I promised you, Xia Qing will immediately honor it. ”

If Bason had chosen to be free, Xia ruofei would not have killed him. He would have kept his promise and let Bason stay.

However, Bason’s fate would be even worse if he did that.

This was because this place was essentially the same as the spirit map space. They were both small spaces. Even if Bason stayed here, he would not be able to return to the mortal world.

Moreover, this was the small trial space, where there were Mirage beasts of all levels. Bason was an ordinary person. He would definitely die if he encountered a Mirage beast.

Even if he was lucky enough not to encounter the Mirage beast, he would soon starve to death in such a small space.

If he returned to the spirit map space, although he would lose his freedom and still have to work every day, at least his life would not be threatened. Even if the days were difficult, he would at least be able to survive.

Xia ruofei also wanted to test Ong.

Fortunately, Bason was tactful. He did not know that he had saved his life.

After hearing Xia ruofei’s words, Ong quickly said,””Thank you, master! Thank you, master!”
