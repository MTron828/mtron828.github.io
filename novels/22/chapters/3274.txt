The ultimate secret of the rising Dragon Order, everything he had experienced in the illusionary realm, had finally come to the final scene. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

At that time, the illusionary realm that everyone had experienced had their consciousness rapidly sucked back to Earth after this light screen had appeared. Then, the entire illusionary realm experience had ended.

And now, they had finally seen the formation of this light screen in reality.

In fact, even though the journey was tiring, it was very smooth overall. It was so smooth that Xia ruofei and the others could not believe it.

They didn’t encounter any danger, nor did they encounter any major difficulties. Just like that, they steadily made it to the final step.

In the beginning, everyone had made sufficient preparations for the difficulties, but they did not expect that none of them would be used.

Seeing that the light curtain had already stabilized, the next step was naturally to enter the portal. Otherwise, everyone had worked so hard to come here just for sightseeing?

Moreover, no one knew how long the door would be open, so they naturally had to enter as soon as possible.

At this moment, Willow also came back to her senses. She put Tao Feng away in her storage magic treasure.

Even though everyone did not know if this Tao Feng would still be of use, Yang Liu had done a great job this time. She had kept Tao Feng away, and no one said anything. In any case, someone had to keep him. They couldn’t just leave Tao Feng here again, right?

Then, everyone came to the light screen.

“Fellow Daoists, I think we must enter in batches,” Xia ruofei said.”Let’s quickly discuss the order!”

Chen Xuan nodded and said,”that’s right!” We don’t know how long this gate will be open. It’ll be troublesome if we delay for too long and the gate closes again. ”

No one knew if the door would open again after it was closed, so everyone nodded in agreement.

At this moment, the only mid – Stage golden core cultivator in the exploration team, Shen tianfang, cleared his throat and said,””I’ll tell you first! We can discuss the order of these people again. Elder Willow, I hope you can take the rear. ”

Yang Liu immediately realized Shen tianfang’s intention. She smiled and said,””No problem, I’ll be the last one! This way, if anything happens to the door, I might be able to use Tao Feng’s music to stabilize it!”

“I think so too.” Shen tianfang smiled and nodded. In addition, my cultivation is the highest among us, and I have more experience than all of you. Why don’t you let me go first? I’ll go in first to explore. If there’s any danger inside and I can still go back, I’ll come back to warn everyone!”

Shen tianfang’s suggestion was reasonable, and everyone nodded in agreement.

Even though the first one to enter might have the highest chance of obtaining an opportunity, it was also the most dangerous. As an intermediate golden core cultivator, Shen tianfang took the initiative to ask to be the first one to explore the way, and no one had any reason to refuse.

Next was the order of the others. Because of time constraints, no one was particularly conflicted about who was first.

After a short discussion, the order to enter the door was decided. Except for Shen tianfang, everyone would be in pairs.

Shen tianfang was the first to enter, followed by mu Hua and mu Jianfei. The third was Chen Xuan and Xu yurou, the fourth was Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue, and the last was Yang Liu and Yu xiner.

There were two minutes between each group.

Shen tianfang cautiously released his flying sword and used his spiritual power to control the sharp flying sword to circle around him. He then took a deep breath and said with a smile,””Fellow Daoists, I’ll go in first!”

“Elder Chen, take care!” Chen Xuan called out with a grave expression.

Shen tianfang cupped his hands at Chen Xuan and said,””Thank you, young sect master!”

After that, Shen tianfang cupped his hands at everyone again, then turned around and strode into the light curtain Door.

Shen tianfang’s vital Qi was exposed, and his flying sword was circling around him. He was ready to deal with any danger.

Xia ruofei and the others also looked at Shen tianfang nervously.

In the blink of an eye, Shen tianfang had already walked to the light screen without any danger. After Shen tianfang stood still, he took another deep breath and maintained a high state of vigilance. He first reached out his right hand to the door formed by the light curtain.

Xia ruofei and the others did not even dare to breathe as they looked at Shen tianfang without blinking.

No one, including Shen tianfang, knew how to enter the door. They also did not know what kind of danger they would face when they passed through the door. This was because the illusion that everyone experienced did not involve these things. After the door was opened, the illusion ended very quickly.

However, even Shen tianfang did not expect that his right hand would pass through the light curtain without any resistance.

Shen tianfang had been prepared to use force to break the spell, but he did not expect that there was no need to do so.

What was even stranger was that after his palm reached into the light curtain Door, he could not sense his own palm at all. It was clearly a part of his body, but it seemed to be missing. Furthermore, he could not sense the existence of his palm with his mind power at all.

Shen tianfang was shocked. He subconsciously retracted his hand.

He turned it over and looked at it for a while. His palm was intact, and he was secretly relieved.

Since the door did not have any resistance, Shen tianfang had nothing to worry about. Even though he still did unknown what would happen after he entered, he had already come this far. There was no reason to retreat.

Furthermore, Shen tianfang had already reached a bottleneck in his cultivation. If he did not have any good opportunities, it would be extremely difficult for him to break through to the late – Stage of the Golden elixir realm. The secret realm in front of him was not simple at all. There might be a super great opportunity inside. For Shen tianfang, it might be an opportunity to break through to the late – Stage of the Golden elixir realm. Even if he knew that there might be fatal dangers inside, he would not retreat.

Shen Tian calmed himself down and did not probe any further. Instead, he filled his body with Yuan Qi and walked into the light screen.

Xia ruofei watched Shen tianfang’s movements intently. At the same time, a wisp of spiritual power was also locked on Shen tianfang.

Shen tianfang stepped into the light curtain Door and disappeared.

Xia ruofei’s spiritual energy was blocked outside the door. The moment Shen tianfang entered the door, he could only vaguely sense the dense spiritual Qi and nothing else.

Besides Xia ruofei, mu Hua, Yang Liu, and Chen Xuan also released their spiritual power.

However, everyone was the same as Xia ruofei. They did not find anything.

Moreover, after Shen tianfang entered the door, everyone tried to use their mind power to check it out. However, they realized that although the light curtain did not block Shen tianfang, their mind power could not penetrate it at all. It was as if they had encountered an impenetrable iron wall.

Soon, Xia ruofei and the others gave up trying and stood still.

According to the previous agreement, the second group to enter the portal would be mu Hua and mu Jianfei, and they would enter in two minutes.

The reason why they waited for two minutes was that they hoped that Shen tianfang would be able to Scout the way for them. If there was any danger, they also hoped that Shen tianfang would come back to warn them.

Just now, Shen tianfang had also said that if everything was safe inside, he would come back in time to inform everyone so that everyone could enter together.

Of course, if Shen tianfang was instantly killed after entering, or if there was no way back, then everyone’s waiting would be meaningless.

However, the situation inside was completely unknown, so this arrangement was also a relatively cautious approach.

Time passed by, and everyone was very quiet. No one spoke, and everyone stared at the light screen door, hoping to see Shen tianfang again.
