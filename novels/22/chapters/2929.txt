2930 Listening to his words and observing his actions (1)

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,””I agree with this plan in principle. But there’s a Chinese saying,’listen to what he says, watch what he does’. I’ve remembered every word that Goodman said. If he doesn’t do it in the future, or if he’s just doing it on the surface, then I won’t be polite to him anymore. I’ll do it myself!”

Xia ruofei was referring to the promises that Goodman had made to the Chinese.

Naturally, Xia ruofei did not have a good impression of these drug gangs. However, he was also clear that there would be no fish in a clear water. There were too many evil people in the world and he could not kill all of them. Take the Bay group as an example. It was almost impossible for Xia ruofei to completely annihilate such a huge drug gang.

Perhaps Xia ruofei could kill all the leaders of the group, but it was such a big drug gang with tens of thousands of people. He couldn’t possibly find and kill every single one of them, right? These people were the cornerstone of the drug trafficking gang. Even if the leaders were killed and the Bay group collapsed, so many grassroots people would eventually embark on the road of drug trafficking. They might set up their own business or join other drug trafficking gangs, but in any case, it was impossible to expect these people to turn over a new leaf.

Instead of killing Goodman and his confidants in exchange for the destruction of the Gulf Group and the birth of many small drug trafficking gangs, it was better to leave the Gulf Group a way out and greatly improve the living environment of The Chinese in Mexico.

When one was poor, he would be good to himself, and when one was good, he would help the world.

In Xia ruofei’s mind, even if he wanted to help the world, he should first help the Chinese.

“Understood!” Charlie cohe quickly replied. Mr. Xia, I’ll emphasize this to Goodman again. I’ll keep an eye on the situation of The Chinese in Mexico. If Goodman goes back on his word, I won’t let him off without you!”

Xia ruofei nodded. He suddenly had an idea and said,””Right, Charlie, add one more request to Goodman!”

“Please give me your orders!” Charlie cohe quickly said.

“From now on, as long as the Bay group exists, their drugs are not allowed to be sold to the Chinese market!” Xia ruofei said sternly,”this must be strictly followed. Goodman can’t even think of using some second – tier distributors or changing his appearance to deceive the world. Otherwise, once I find out, he’ll be in serious trouble!”

Charlie Koch replied without the slightest hesitation.”Alright! I’ll make a request to him immediately! Mr. Xia, I’m sure he’ll agree to it without hesitation! In fact, the biggest market for Mexico drug trafficking groups is in the United States. More than 90% of the ice, Coke, and cannabis in the United States come from Mexico. As far as I know, the annual drug transaction between the United States and Mexico is as high as 20 to 30 billion US dollars. In contrast, in the European and Asia – Pacific drug markets, the proportion of Mexico drug trafficking groups in the market was very small, and they had only begun to gradually enter the Asia – Pacific market in recent years. I believe that Goodman won’t risk his life for the Asia – Pacific market!”

Actually, Xia ruofei’s request was a huge loss for Bay group. After all, the drug market in the Asia – Pacific region was quite huge, and the profits were higher than if they were sold to the United States and Europe. The current sales were not high only because they had not seriously explored this market before, but it did not mean that the potential of the Asia – Pacific market was low.

However, Charlie Koch believed that Goodman would weigh the pros and cons and eventually agree to withdraw from the Chinese market. After all, in the Asia – Pacific region, other than China, they could still expand into other vast markets. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Mr. Xia, there’s one more thing I need to report to you!” Charlie cohe continued. Goodman sent me two videos, one of them executing ERAD, and the other one was recorded by Goodman himself. He personally expressed his apology and goodwill to his Chinese friends, and made a promise. Do you think ... We should forward these two videos to you?”

Xia ruofei pondered for a while. He was not interested in the video, but he felt that the video was still meaningful. At least, it could easily dispel Zhang Chao’s concerns. Otherwise, with the Bay group’s fierce reputation, it would take a lot of effort to make Zhang Chao believe that the problem had been completely solved.

Everything would be much simpler if Goodman came to explain himself.

Thinking of this, Xia ruofei smiled and said,””Send it to me! I’ll give you an email box number, you can write it down. ”

“Mr. Xia, please wait a moment!” Charlie Koch hurriedly found a pen and paper from the study table before saying,”Please tell me, I’ll write it down now!”

Xia ruofei gave an email address to Charlie cohe and said,””Just send it to this email! I’ll receive it later. ”

“Understood!” Charlie cohe quickly said.

After Charlie Koch hung up, he immediately contacted Pierre and got him to transfer the email from Goodman to the email box that Xia ruofei had provided.

Then, he personally called Goodman.

After Goldman reported to Charlie cohe and sent the videos and photos to Pierre, he had been waiting anxiously, as if he was waiting for fate’s judgment.
