After hanging up the phone, Guan Ping told Xia ruofei that he had decided to let store manager Liu go. Xia ruofei naturally did not have any objections. This time, he had done it to stand up for Guan Ping. Otherwise, Guan Ping could have just resigned. It would not have affected him at all.

Soon, Liang Weimin called Xia ruofei and told him about the situation with store manager Liu and Bai Jingjing.

Xia ruofei expressed his sincere gratitude. At the same time, he also said that store manager Liu was an accomplice. He could just let him resign on his own accord. As for the ban on the entire industry, he could forget about it.

Liang Weimin naturally agreed. As for Bai Jingjing, who Xia ruofei didn’t even mention, Liang Weimin naturally knew what to do.

It didn’t take long for the car to arrive at the neighborhood where pang Hao’s house was located.

Pang Hao’s parents were already waiting downstairs. They could not help but grumble when they saw how drunk pang Hao was. However, Xia ruofei was pang Hao’s good friend and boss, so they could not blame Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei, on the other hand, apologized to pang Hao’s parents in embarrassment. After all, the three of them had gone out for a drink and pang Hao was the only one who had drunk too much. It was inevitable that his parents would misunderstand.

Fortunately, pang Hao’s parents knew about the relationship between the three of them. On top of that, it was the New Year’s Eve, so they naturally wouldn’t say anything. They only took pang Hao over from ye Lingyun’s side and helped him up. They even invited the few of them upstairs to sit.

Naturally, Xia ruofei and the rest declined politely. They watched as pang Hao and his family entered the elevator before they got in and left.

Then, Xia ruofei asked ye Lingyun to drive Guanping home.

At the entrance of Guan Ping’s neighborhood, Xia ruofei said to Guan Ping,””Pingzi, rest well at home for the next few days and calm down. Go to work after the new year and resign. I’ll talk to Xianfeng real estate. They definitely won’t make things difficult for you. After you submit your resignation letter, you can report to my company directly. I’ll make arrangements in advance. When the time comes, you can just look for pang Hao.”

“Alright!” Guan Ping nodded and said,”ruofei, you don’t have to assign me any duties. I’ll start from an ordinary employee!” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I have my own plans. You don’t have to worry about it.” Alright, it’s getting late, let’s go in! I should go back too!”

With that, Xia ruofei got into the car and gestured for ye Lingyun to drive.

Guan Ping watched the Knight XV walk further and further away before he turned and walked into the community.

......

On the fifth day of the first lunar month, Sanshan airport.

Xia ruofei was dressed in low – Key casual clothes and a pair of Ray – Ban aviator sunglasses. He dragged a simple suitcase out of the car.

He refused ye Lingyun’s help with his luggage and said with a smile,””Ling Yun, let’s stop here! This is a temporary parking area. If you Park too long, you’ll be photographed. You can just go back to the farm. ”

“Okay, brother Xia, I’ll be going then!” Ye linyun nodded.

“Okay. If anything happens at the company, give me a call.” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

He waved at ye Lingyun, then dragged his small suitcase into the China departure hall.

Today’s journey was smooth and there was still some time before the boarding time. Xia ruofei found a long chair and sat down to rest for a while.

He was a little excited. Two days ago, he had contacted Song Wei. The two of them had agreed to go to xiangnan to explore the ancient tomb that had poisoned Song Wei.

Xia ruofei knew that there was a high possibility that the realm stone was in the ancient tomb, so he was full of anticipation for this trip. The Xuanji spirit map space had not been upgraded for a long time. At its current scale, the consumption of Jade to upgrade each level was huge. Even with Xia ruofei’s current financial resources, he could not afford it.

Even if Xia ruofei had enough money to buy jade, Jade was a non – renewable resource that had been formed after countless years of earth’s crust transformation. It was not realistic to rely on Jade to upgrade the space. After all, the amount of Jade that could be bought on the market was limited.

Moreover, if he continued to buy a large amount of Jade in the long run, it would definitely arouse suspicion.

Hence, the best way to upgrade the space was to find world stones. Not only was it more efficient, but it would also not attract attention.

The existence of the boundary stone had no rules to follow. Even if Xia Qing had engraved a sensing array for Xia ruofei, it would only react within a few kilometers. For the vast world, this was like looking for a needle in a haystack.

Hence, an accurate clue about the world stone like the ancient tomb was extremely valuable. Xia ruofei had to hold on to it no matter what.

In order to not attract attention, Xia ruofei told his friends and even Ling Qingxue that he was going to inspect a project in another city. He even booked his own plane tickets. Ye Lingyun, who sent him to the airport, did not know where his destination was, much less that he would be going with Song Wei.

Xia ruofei sat on the bench for a while. Then, he received a WeChat message from Song Wei. I’m already out of the car, have you arrived yet?

Xia ruofei immediately replied,”I’m at the departure hall. I haven’t registered yet. I’m waiting for you!”

He raised his head and looked at the entrance of the departure hall. Through the glass door, he saw Song Wei getting out of a black car.

Song Wei also refused the driver’s help to carry her luggage. After taking out the boarding device from the trunk, she asked the driver to go back.

Song Wei dragged her luggage into the departure hall and immediately looked around.
