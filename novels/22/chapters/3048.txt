3049 The reunion of master and disciple (1)

Translator: 5496903The three of them alighted from the flying boat. Xia ruofei immediately kept the flying boat.

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but be amazed when they saw the 20 – meter – long flying boat shrink to an inch.

The three of them chatted and laughed as they walked towards the manor’s entrance.

In reality, with Xia ruofei’s abilities, he could easily bring Song Wei and Ling Qingxue into the manor on his flying sword.

However, out of respect for the host, Xia ruofei would definitely not do that.

“Ruofei, this should be considered illegal entry, right?” Song Wei suddenly asked with a smile.

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment, then he laughed and said,””Oh yeah! Then you guys have to be careful, if you get caught you’ll be sent back to your country!”

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue burst into laughter.

In the manor, Tang Haoran, who had just woken up from his afternoon nap, was drinking a glass of water. Jennifer had personally prepared a schoolbag for him, and it seemed that she was going to send him to school.

Tang Yitian had just woken up from his afternoon nap. He was sitting on a recliner in the garden and reading the newspaper.

At this time, a young man in a white shirt and black trousers walked over quickly and whispered a few words to Tang Yitian.

Tang Yitian raised his eyebrows and said,”What?”

Then, he took the iPad from the young man’s hand, which was showing the surveillance footage of the manor’s entrance.

When Tang Yitian looked at the screen, Xia ruofei seemed to have sensed something. He smiled at the camera above the gate and waved.

Tang Yitian quickly sat up from his chair and ordered,””Open the door and welcome the guests!”

“Ah long!” Tang Yitian called out again. Tell the kitchen to prepare a banquet! They were prepared according to the highest specifications! Steam that precious half of the ham I have!”

“Yes! Mr. Tang!” Another young man in a white shirt and black suit pants quickly responded.

Jennifer also heard the noise. She put her bag on Tang Yitian’s back, then walked out and asked,””Ethan, what happened?” he asked.

Tang Yitian immediately came back to his senses and said,”Jennifer, don’t send Haoran to school first ... No! Call Ms. Jessica and ask for half a day’s leave for Haoran!”

“What’s going on?” Jennifer was confused.

When Tang Haoran, who had sharp ears, heard this, he immediately put down his bag and ran out. He shouted happily,””Daddy! Don’t I have to go to school today? That’s great!”

Tang Yitian directly said to Jennifer and Tang Haoran,””It’s brother RUO Fei. Let’s quickly go and welcome him! Let’s go! Haoran, don’t just stand there, go and pick up your master!”

Tang Haoran also came back to his senses and cried out in surprise,””Master is here! Really?”

After saying that, he turned around and rushed toward the door.

Tang Yitian and Jennifer quickly reminded him to be careful. In fact, Tang Haoran’s cultivation was already close to the third level of the Qi refining realm. In terms of strength, even eight Tang yitians couldn’t beat Tang Haoran. Moreover, with the reaction speed of a cultivator, how could he fall for no reason?

Tang Yitian and Jennifer also quickly caught up.

Tang Yitian’s Manor was very big, so when the staff at the gate received the notice, they immediately opened the gate and sent Xia ruofei’s group of three in with an electric car.

When they were approaching the main building, Xia ruofei saw Tang Haoran rushing out. He quickly called the driver of the electric car to stop and jumped off.

“Master!” Tang Haoran rushed into Xia ruofei’s arms and hugged him tightly.

Xia ruofei ruffled Tang Haoran’s hair affectionately and asked with a smile,””Little Haoran, I haven’t seen you for so long. Did you miss master?”

Tang Haoran nodded heavily and said,””Of course, Haoran misses master every day!”

Then, he said as if he was asking for a reward,””Master, I’m already close to refined Qi Level 3, and I feel like I can break through at any time! You just so happen to be able to teach me the cultivation method for the third layer first!”

Xia ruofei was surprised. He checked and found that Tang Haoran’s cultivation had reached the peak of refined Qi Level 2. He could break through at any time.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be surprised. After all, Tang Haoran was too young to cultivate with him. He relied on his self – awareness and had no one to guide him if he had any problems. Moreover, the cultivation resource was a spiritual crystal that Xia ruofei left behind. Under these conditions, the little guy’s cultivation progress was quite fast.

“Not bad! Not bad!” Xia ruofei said happily.

At this moment, Jennifer and Tang Yitian had caught up.

Tang Haoran’s running speed was too fast, so much so that Tang Yitian and the other two were slightly breathless.

“RUO Fei! Why didn’t you tell me you were coming?” Tang Yitian said happily,”it’s a good thing I still have some in my Manor! Today, I’ll ask the kitchen to steam my precious ham. You must try it!”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment and then said apologetically,””Big brother Tang, I might not be able to stay for dinner!”

“What’s the situation? You’ve just arrived and you’re already leaving?” Tang Yitian asked in confusion.

“Xia,” Jennifer said,”you’ve already been an uninvited guest today. Are you going to leave without saying goodbye again?”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.””Jennifer, you still like to use Chinese idioms so much!” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Jennifer smiled at Xia ruofei and said,””I’ve been learning Chinese! Xia, Ethan’s right, it’s not easy for you to come to Sydney. You should at least stay for a meal before leaving!”
