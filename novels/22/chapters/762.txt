Chapter 763: Squad leader Xia returns to the team (2)

If they had already been targeted, then it would be a situation where the enemy was in the dark while they were in the light. It was always easier to destroy than to protect, and they were in a completely passive state.

Therefore, Guo Zhan immediately organized the backbone to study the mission implementation plan and drafted a mission candidate. The most elite force of the lone wolf assault team was included, including the squad leader old Luo. There were a total of seven people, led by Guo Zhan himself.

At the same time, he also chose another seven people to form a reserve team. The two teams split up and headed to the three mountains.

In this way, when necessary, the reserve team could be used to set up a diversion and also provide support at any time.

Guo Zhan gathered the members of the two teams overnight and studied a detailed plan, including the entire escort route, mode of transportation, methods to deal with all kinds of emergencies, emergency contact codes, and so on.

It could be said that the plan had already been done to the extreme. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

However, plans never changed as fast as changes. This was an irrefutable truth.

In fact, Liang Qiming’s team had already been targeted by the enemy forces.

After Liang Qiming discovered the alpha 6 material, he had taken a lot of precautions. At the same time, he had sorted out and controlled the core data of the experiment. He was the only one in the entire team who had complete control of the experiment data.

However, due to the lack of strict confidentiality measures in the early stages, the news still leaked out.

After Guo Zhan led the elite team to San Shan University, he even got in touch with Liang Qiming. However, just as they arrived at Liang Qiming’s laboratory at San Shan University, they were suddenly attacked.

Completely caught off guard, Guo Zhan’s small team was caught off guard.

It was in this split second that squad leader old Luo pounced in front of Guo Zhan and blocked the Fatal Bullet for him.

......

Guo Zhan and the others quickly returned fire. The other party’s firepower was very strong. In the process of exchanging fire, Jin Gang was unfortunately shot.

Due to the suddenness of the incident and the fact that the other party had an absolute advantage, in addition to the fact that they were on campus, Guo Zhan and the others were a little cautious and worried that they would accidentally hurt innocent teachers and students. Therefore, although Guo Zhan’s small team also killed two of the other party’s people, they still allowed the group to escape successfully.

And they even took the two bodies away.

While Guo Zhan was organizing his team members to perform emergency rescue on squad leader old Luo and Jin Gang, he rushed into Liang Qiming’s laboratory with two other people. However, the inside was already a mess. Liang Qiming and his laboratory staff were all gone.

This was the first time Guo Zhan had suffered such a heavy blow in his twenty years in the Army. The target he was protecting had disappeared right under his nose, and he didn’t know if the experimental data had fallen into the hands of the enemy. One of his own had been sacrificed, and another had been seriously injured. It was a complete and utter failure.

Speaking of this, Guo Zhan couldn’t help but punch the wall heavily. He gritted his teeth and said,”Blood Wolf! If we can’t catch these people and save professor Liang and the experimental data, I really don’t have the face to go back and report to the Bureau chief, and I don’t have the face to explain to monitor old Luo ...”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but click his tongue after hearing this. The other party was too bold. They actually started a gun fight on the university campus.

This also reflected the importance of alpha 6. This unexpected product of the experiment had risen to a strategic position and become an important target for hostile forces.

Yesterday, Xia ruofei had been busy arranging the protection of Lin Qiao and had no idea that such a big thing had happened in Sanshan University.

Of course, after the incident, Guo Zhan must have already coordinated with the relevant military and local units, so the possibility of this news being exposed was actually not high.

After listening to Guo Zhan’s story, Xia ruofei pondered for a long time before he said,””Wolf King, the most important thing now is to stop this group of people from leaving the three mountains, especially from leaving the country!”

Guo Zhan nodded and said,”yes, I’ve already coordinated with the relevant units to block the airport, ports, and other important roads. At the same time, the military chief has also issued orders to the garrison units in the southeast province. The officers and soldiers of the 36th Mechanized Infantry Division have entered Level 2 combat preparation state. The division’s reconnaissance team and special Combat Team have also been fully deployed to search for these armed men without disturbing the order of society! I don’t think they’ll be able to escape so quickly!”

Xia ruofei thought for a moment and nodded.””The second thing we need to confirm is professor Liang’s safety and the safety of the experimental data.”

Guo Zhan had obviously already analyzed this and said without thinking,”Judging from the current situation, professor Liang’s life should not be in danger for the time being. Of course, this is based on the premise that the experimental data is safe. The other party is obviously here for the experimental data. Before they get all the data, professor Liang will be fine. At most, he will suffer some physical pain.”

“How can you be sure that the data is safe?” Xia ruofei asked immediately.

“Of course I can’t be sure about that,” said Guo Zhan,”but when I contacted professor Liang yesterday, I could feel that he was a little uneasy. Perhaps he’s aware of the danger.” Although it was not convenient to say too much over the phone, professor Liang told me that he would take me to a place after the meeting. I think he probably hid the data in a secret place in advance. ”

Guo Zhan paused and said,”our people have checked the computers in the laboratory and found that all the hard drives of the computers have been completely physically damaged. It’s almost impossible to repair them with our current technology. So, the group of attackers didn’t take them away at all because they were useless to them.”

Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows and said,””Obviously, professor Liang deliberately destroyed the data. If it was done by the enemy, they would have either taken the hard drive or copied the data. There was no need to destroy the hard drive in such a tight time.”

“Yes, I am!” Guo Zhan said,”based on the analysis of these situations, I think that professor Liang is safe for the time being. It is also very likely that the enemy has only kidnapped professor Liang and has not obtained the experimental data!”

“Captain, have you found anything useful about the background of these people?” Xia ruofei asked.

Guo Zhan shook his head slightly and said,”it was an encounter yesterday. Both sides were caught off guard, but the other side was obviously more prepared. Not only did they have strong firepower, but everyone was masked. In the end, they even took the corpses with them when they retreated. We didn’t get much useful information.”

Speaking of this, Guo Zhan changed the topic and said,”However, according to the comprehensive analysis of the information we have so far, the group of people yesterday were either from the East or the South. These two are the most likely.”

Hearing this, Xia ruofei’s eyes lit up.

To the East were the Wei nation people, and to the South were the Lu Song monkeys.

Xia ruofei did not have a good impression of these two countries.

“No matter where they come from, this time, they won’t be able to return!” Xia ruofei said coldly.

“Captain,” he continued,”let’s analyze where they’re most likely hiding, or which direction they’re escaping from.”

“Mm! I’ll tell you first!” Guo Zhan had been thinking about this question since yesterday, so he directly said his analysis,”the possibility of taking a plane is the lowest. After all, although their identities have not been exposed, it is basically impossible for them to leave the country without being noticed with professor Liang. In addition, we’ve also arranged for people to monitor the exits of the land road. The possibility of them escaping by car is not high, so ...”

“There are two other possibilities!” Xia ruofei continued,”there are many mountains and forests in the southeast province. If I were them, I would probably choose to take professor Liang and escape into the mountains. It would be easier to hide in the forest. They could also use this time difference to extort a confession from professor Liang. Once professor Liang can’t hold on and confesses, they could directly get the core experimental data. By then, professor Liang would be of no use to them. They could completely silence him and leave the country in batches. After all, we don’t have detailed information on these people yet!”

“My judgment is the same,” said Guo Zhan with a worried expression. I hope professor Liang can realize that if he clenches his teeth and doesn’t say anything, he might still have a way out, but once he confesses, he’ll be dead ... Ruofei, I’m going to coordinate the 36th Division to send two regiments of troops to conduct a net – like search of the forest around the city with Sanshan University as the center!”

“I agree!” Xia ruofei nodded and said,”but ... Wolf King, they have another possible choice. We must not ignore it!”
