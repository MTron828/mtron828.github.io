Chapter 1716: Unfathomable_2

No matter how he looked at it, the text message was flirtatious and flirtatious. Xia ruofei felt guilty and hid in a corner. He copied the address into the text box and sent it out.

At the qishang headquarters, next to the Office of the Senior Vice President, Tony, a blonde, blue – eyed Western beauty looked at the address displayed on her phone, and her beautiful little mouth could not help but turn into an O shape.

As a native of xiutani, Ivy was naturally familiar with the well – known wealthy area of vaucluuse. Those who lived there were all well – known rich people in Australia. The cheapest villa there was in the tens of millions of Australian dollars. An ordinary white – collar worker like her could not afford such a house even if she worked for eight lifetimes.

The address that Mr. Xia had provided was actually there. In addition, she had already known about the content of the reward for Xia ruofei from qiuhang in advance. This made avy, who was in charge of receiving Xia ruofei the next day, have some wild thoughts ...

Xia ruofei naturally didn’t know that he had become the best candidate for a rich husband. After sending the address, he continued to eat breakfast with Tang Yitian and the others.

“Ruofei, I’ll go with you tomorrow!” Tang Yitian said with a smile. I’ll help you back up ...”

“Don’t scare the people from Quto!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Didn’t you say that they would announce the reward plan tomorrow?” Tang Yitian said,”if the reward isn’t good enough, don’t blame me for dissing them on the spot!”

How did he look like a super – rich man with a net worth of tens of billions?

Tang Yitian’s image was directly pulled down to the level of a rich young master like song Rui ...

Li Yifu, who was at the side, also said seriously,””Senior granduncle, this disciple will accompany you tomorrow!”

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly.”There’s a press conference tomorrow. What are you all doing there?”

Tang Yitian smiled and said,”I’m here to support you!” Grandpa Li’s family business is spread all over the world, and I think he has some shares in Quto, right?”

Tang Yitian looked at Li Yifu as he spoke.

Li Yifu really nodded and said,””There are some. Although it’s not much, if they sell all of it, it can still impact their stock price!”

Xia ruofei was shocked and quickly said,””Don ‘t! Don’ t! Who would rush to someone and ask for a reward? I don’t care about the reward at all! If you guys want to go, then follow me, but don’t do anything stupid. You have to listen to me!”

“Yes, martial granduncle!” Li Yifu immediately said.

Xia ruofei broke out in a cold sweat. She wanted to sell their shares without saying a word. Who did the A.I. Airlines offend?

What he did not know was that Li Yifu was also very well – connected in the business world. Otherwise, he would not have been able to earn such a huge fortune. However, since it involved Xia ruofei, Li Yifu would not care about the money spent in the secular world.

It was not an exaggeration to say that Xia ruofei was almost like a god in Li Yifu’s heart.

After breakfast, Tang Yitian arranged a car to take Xia ruofei and Feng Rao to sightsee. It was the weekend, so Jennifer and Tang Haoran naturally followed. Even Li Yifu insisted on going with them. In the end, Xia ruofei let Xu Ziyuan get in the car and asked everyone to leave. It wasn’t appropriate to leave him alone.

Fortunately, under Xia ruofei’s strict orders, Li Yifu did not follow him closely. He maintained a certain distance during the tour.

That day, with Tang Yitian as their tour guide, Xia ruofei and Feng Rao visited a few of the famous tourist spots in sithiny, such as the Opera House, the harbor Bridge, and Saint Mary Cathedral. They enjoyed a sumptuous dinner at the revolving restaurant in the Sydney Tower before returning to the manor.

At night, Feng Rao and the rest went back to their rooms to rest after a day of sightseeing. Xia ruofei brought Tang Haoran to the tea room.

He taught Tang Haoran the second level of the <>. First, he asked him to remember the mental cultivation method. Then, he personally guided him to practice it a few times until he completely mastered it.

Tang Haoran’s talent was excellent, and the second and first layers of the “fierce yang Scripture” were connected by the same vein, so he was able to master it very quickly. It was just that he was not as familiar with the newly involved meridians as the first layer.

Xia ruofei observed from the side for a while and soon felt relieved. He took out another spiritual crystal and sat cross – legged to cultivate. He was about to break through the bottleneck of Qi disciple Level 5 and could not slack off in his cultivation.

It was not until around 12 o’ clock at night that the master and disciple finished their cultivation and returned to their respective rooms to rest.

......

At around eighto’ clock in the morning, a black Mercedes – Benz car arrived at the entrance of the manor villa.

Avril, who was sitting in the front passenger seat, looked at the vast and incomparably luxurious Manor. Her eyes were almost shining with golden light, and she felt her breathing become a little rushed.

She had only heard of the wealthy Vaucluse District in the past. It was also Ivy’s first time in Huahua. It was all thanks to Xia ruofei. Otherwise, she would not have been able to enter the house.

Only after experiencing it on the spot did she know how luxurious the place where the rich lived was. This was the prime location of the qitiny! DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Poverty had really limited his imagination.

Xia ruofei and the others had already walked out to ask Ai Wei to give Xia ruofei a call when she was at the door. Without the owner’s permission, the car could not enter.

Ai Wei recognized Xia ruofei at a glance.

Recently, Xia ruofei could be said to be the darling of the media! Many local media in Australia were reporting about the forced landing of the Australian Airlines plane. This news incident could not avoid the protagonist, Xia ruofei.

She quickly tidied up her clothes and hair, and quickly walked up to him. She revealed what she felt was her most charming smile, stretched out her hand, and said,”Hello, Mr. Xia, I’m Ivy!”

“Hello, Miss Ivy!” Xia ruofei smiled and shook her hand.

Ai Wei felt that Xia ruofei’s hands were not rough at all. In fact, they were very warm. Her heart could not help but flutter and she almost could not help but scratch Xia ruofei’s palm.

However, just as she was hesitating, Xia ruofei quickly let go.

Ivy stopped her random thoughts and said,”Mr. Xia, please get in the car!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Miss Ivy, a few of my friends would like to go with us. We’ve prepared our own cars. Can you please use your car to lead the way?”

Ivy hesitated for a moment before immediately nodding and saying,”No problem!”

Soon, the car arranged by Tang Yitian drove over slowly, making Ivy’s breath Quicken. It was a long Bentley. In her memory, there were only a few of this kind of limited – edition long Bentley in the whole sutterni.

Then, Ivy quickly recognized the middle – aged man beside Xia ruofei. Wasn’t he Ethan Tang, the boss of the Australian retail giant, Maya Group?

Ivy felt that her brain was not enough. She had thought that Mr. Xia was only very capable, but she did not expect that she only knew the tip of the iceberg. He actually had a super – rich friend like isendon.

There was no doubt that this Manor should belong to isendon. Mr. Xia was able to stay here for the night, and Mr. Tang had personally accompanied him to the press conference, which showed that the relationship between the two was quite close.

Ai Wei didn’t dare to neglect him, so she politely greeted Tang Yitian. She didn’t recognize Li Yifu, a small shareholder of qishang, since he spent most of his time in the United States.

Then, Ivy said to Xia ruofei,”Mr. Xia, this is the arrangement for the morning. Mr. Tony will have a short meeting with you at about nineo’ clock. The press conference will start at nine – thirty sharp.”

“I’m fine with it. I’ll follow your arrangements. ” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Ivy, can we go now?”

Ivy then came back to her senses and said somewhat embarrassedly,””Yes, Mr. Xia!”

She quickly returned to the car. The Mercedes – Benz led the way in front, and the extended Bentley followed closely behind. They slowly left the villa.
