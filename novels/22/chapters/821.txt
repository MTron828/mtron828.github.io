Before Lin Yue ‘e could speak, uncle Luo, who was lying on the bed, asked in a weak voice,””Little descendant, you are?”

Xia ruofei quickly took two steps forward and said,””Uncle Luo, my name is Xia ruofei. I’m a former comrade of squad leader Luo and a soldier that he used to lead.”

“Oh ... Xia ... Thank you ...” Uncle Luo nodded slightly.

Xia ruofei quickly said,”uncle Luo, your body is weak. Don’t talk. Lie down and rest for a while.” Don’t worry, I’ll definitely cure your illness ...”

Uncle Luo smiled bitterly and said,”I can’t be cured ... This has been an old illness for many years!” Besides ... Without my son and my wife, what’s the point of me living?”

Lin Yue ‘E’s tears were about to flow when she heard that. She said,””Dad! Please don’t think that way, mom and Zhicheng are watching from the heavens, they definitely want you to be healthy!”

Squad leader Luo’s sister also said with red eyes,””Dad, what are you saying? Mom and brother are gone, but don’t you still have us? You’re the pillar of this family. If something happens to you, won’t this family fall apart?”

Uncle Luo let out a long sigh and closed his eyes. His face was full of misery.

Xia ruofei went up to him and said,”uncle Luo, sister – in – Law is right. Squad leader Luo’s spirit is in heaven. He definitely hopes that you will be well.” Uncle Luo, what you need to do now is to have a good rest and take good care of your body. Squad leader Luo can only be at ease if you are healthy and live a long life! Besides ... Nan Nan is still so young. Can you bear to see her lose her grandparents and father at the same time?”

At first, uncle Luo had lost all interest in life. He had become numb from his sadness. However, when Xia ruofei mentioned Nan Nan, his wrinkled face finally moved slightly. He slowly opened his eyes, sighed, and nodded gently.

Xia ruofei knew that uncle Luo had taken his words to heart. With Nan Nan as a tie, he should not continue to be so depressed and lose the will to live.

Xia ruofei had a way to cure all the physical diseases. However, if the old man could not get over it, Xia ruofei could not do anything.

Such a huge pain could only be slowly smoothed over with time.

Xia ruofei gave Lin Yue ‘e a look, and the two of them left the East Room. Squad leader Luo’s sister was still waiting on him in the room because she was worried about her father.

In the central room, the Daoist priest that had been invited from outside was chanting Sutras and playing suonas. It was extremely noisy. Xia ruofei and Lin Yue ‘e arrived at the room on the west side.

“Sister – in – Law, what’s the condition of uncle Luo’s body?” Xia ruofei asked.

Lin Yue ‘e sighed and said,”my father – in – Law has had asthma for many years. However, he’s managed to control it well these few years. He basically doesn’t have any relapses. Usually, his health is better than my mother – in – Law’ s.” A few days ago, when the reporter went to my sister-in-law’s house, my mother – in – Law passed out and never woke up again. My father – in – Law ... Also had an asthma attack and kept coughing. We found the village’s barefoot doctor and he said that there might be a tumor in his lungs ...”

“Didn’t you go to a big hospital to get a diagnosis?” Xia ruofei asked.

Lin Yue ‘e shook her head.”I’ve been busy with mother-in-law’s funeral arrangements for the past few days. I didn’t have the time.”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,””Sister – in – Law, uncle Luo’s illness is not a big problem. I should be able to treat him, but he may need some time to recuperate ... Also, he must maintain a good mood, otherwise it will be very difficult to treat him.” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Lin Yue ‘e said,”ruofei, sister – in – Law thanks you first!” But with the current situation at home, how can my father – in – Law be in a good mood?”

Xia ruofei did not answer her question directly. Instead, he asked,””Sis – in – Law, before I came back from the Army, the captain told me that the local government would arrange a suitable job for you in your family’s situation. Has this matter been confirmed yet?”

Lin Yue ‘e lowered her head and said,”ruofei, there are arrangements, but I didn’t accept them ... Listen to me first. Little Guo has also advised me on this matter, but ... I have an agreement with old Luo. He told me that his job is very dangerous. If he were to die one day, he hoped that I wouldn’t be sad. Also, I should try my best not to cause trouble for the organization and make any requests ...”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be stunned. He didn’t expect that old Luo would have such an instruction. What kind of thinking realm was this?

In this world, there were some people who were perfect in spirit, such as class monitor old Luo. Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel inferior in this regard.

However, Lin Yue ‘e did not accept any work arranged by the organization, which was to Xia ruofei’s liking. After all, the work arranged by the local government was at most an idle job in a public institution. The salary was not too high, and it was already good enough that she could sustain her life.

“Sister – in – Law, since you don’t have a fixed job, I have a suggestion ...” Xia ruofei said after some thought.

“Go ahead,” Lin Yue ‘e raised her head and looked at Xia ruofei as she spoke.

Although Lin Yue ‘e didn’t know the details of the mission, she knew that Xia ruofei had personally killed the person who had killed squad leader Luo. Hence, Xia ruofei’s words still carried a lot of weight in her heart.

Xia ruofei said sincerely,”sister – in – Law, you may have heard that I started a company in San Shan city of the southeast province after I retired. After a year of development, the company is now very large. Since you don’t have a permanent job here, I would like to ... Invite you to work in my company. What do you think?”
