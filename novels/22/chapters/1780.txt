Chapter 1781: Get your wish (2)

“Sure!” Wu Xiujuan nodded. Qiang Zi, since we are here, we will listen to you!”

Xia Xiaolan, on the other hand, looked at the antique siheyuan with great interest and exclaimed,””Brother Qiang Zi, this courtyard is so big! I think it’s even bigger than the big houses in our hometown!”

“Of course,” Wu Qiang chuckled and said,”why else would the boss hire so many staff members?” Xiao LAN, this courtyard has three entrances in total. This is only the third one, and it’s the smallest one. You’ll know when you see the front. It’s big!”

Xia Xiaolan’s eyes widened as she asked,””Brother Qiang, have you been working here all this time?”

“Yup! An old leader in the Army introduced me to this job!” Wu Qiang said,”I’m just lucky to have met such a good boss like President Xia!”

As they spoke, the three of them arrived at Wu Qiang’s room. Wu Qiang put down his things and said,””Sister – in – Law, Xiao LAN, change into the clothes you just bought, and then we’ll go see President Xia! I’ll wait for you guys outside!”

“Alright!” Wu Xiujuan replied.

Wu Qiang stood in the courtyard and smoked a cigarette. He saw Wu Xiujuan and Xia Xiaolan, who had changed into new clothes, walk out. The two women did not have the habit of putting on makeup. If it were a girl from the city, she would probably need at least half an hour to change her clothes.

Wu Qiang led the two of them through the corridor and arrived at the second courtyard where Xia ruofei was staying.

Xia ruofei was sitting on the sofa in the living room of the suite, watching TV.

In fact, Xia ruofei had also estimated that Wu Qiang would be back soon, so he sat here to kill time. He did not expect to wait for more than two hours.

Wu Qiang gently knocked on the door. Xia ruofei looked up and saw Wu Qiang standing outside the door through the glass window. There were two women who looked a little uneasy beside him.

Xia ruofei beckoned to Wu Qiang, who quickly pushed the door open and entered. Wu Xiujuan and Xia Xiaolan also followed suit.

Wu Qiang explained,”President Xia, my sister-in-law’s flight was late. They only picked them up at Sixo’ clock. That’s why they were delayed and only came back now. I’m sorry!”

Xia ruofei looked at the two people who had obviously changed into new clothes and nodded with satisfaction.””It seems that you’re very determined to carry out orders. It doesn’t matter if you’re late. Come and sit!”

Wu Qiang quickly invited Wu Xiujuan and Xia Xiaolan to sit down.

Xia ruofei’s courtyard house had an antique appearance but was very modern on the inside. The two of them sat on the soft sofa and looked at the obviously high – end decorations in the house. They were so nervous that they did not know where to put their hands.

Xia ruofei looked at the two of them with a pleasant expression. He first looked at Wu Xiujuan and smiled.””You must be Wu Qiang’s sister – in – Law!”

Wu Xiujuan quickly nodded. She was so nervous that she did not know how to answer Xia ruofei.

“President Xia, my sister-in-law’s name is Wu Xiujuan,” Wu Qiang said.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”then I’ll call you Auntie Wu!” Aunt Wu, I heard from Wu Qiang that in the village, which family is willing to invite you to cook for their wedding?”

“Yeah!” Wu Xiujuan quickly nodded. Boss Xia, although I’ve never learned how to cook, I’m still very good at cooking! The villagers are also more supportive. ”

Xia ruofei nodded and turned to Xia Xiaolan. He smiled and said,””Wu Qiang, aren’t you going to introduce your partner?”

Xia ruofei’s words caused Wu Qiang and Xia Xiaolan to blush.

Their relationship had not been confirmed yet and they were both thin – skinned people. After hearing Xia ruofei’s words, they quickly looked at each other and then immediately looked away.

“President Xia, her name is Xia Xiaolan. She’s ... She’s not my partner yet!” Wu Qiang said.

Xia ruofei teased,”yo!” We’re still from the same family! Maybe they were one family five hundred years ago!”

Xia ruofei’s friendly attitude made Xia Xiaolan less nervous. She said,””Hello, boss Xia!”

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”our Wu Qiang is quite outstanding. Xiao LAN, you have to seize the opportunity!” If it’s taken away by someone else, you won’t even have a place to cry!”

Xia Xiaolan’s face turned red from embarrassment, but Wu Qiang quickly said,””President Xia, I’m not the kind of person who would two – time!”

Xia Xiaolan was even more embarrassed when she heard this. She glared at Wu Qiang and lowered her head to look at her toes, not daring to look at Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei exchanged some pleasantries with the two of them and said seriously,””Aunt Wu, Xiao LAN, I believe Wu Qiang has already told you that I need two staff members. One of them will be in charge of buying groceries and cooking, while the other will be in charge of the hygiene and taking care of the flowers, birds, insects, fish, and so on.” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Xia ruofei looked at the two people who were looking at him nervously and continued,””I believe in Wu Qiang’s judgment. Since he recommended you guys, I think you guys will definitely be able to do the job. The monthly salary is 6000 Yuan, with food and accommodation, five insurance, and one housing Fund. At least double pay at the end of the year. If you think it’s suitable, you can start work officially tomorrow!”

Wu Xiujuan and Xia Xiaolan didn’t know about the five insurance and one housing Fund, or the year – end double pay, but when they heard that the monthly salary was 6000 Yuan and that food and accommodation were provided, they were more than willing to do it.

In the beginning, they were worried that the boss would not like them. They did not expect Xia ruofei to be so easy to talk to. The so – called interview was actually just a casual chat. He did not even mention the probation period and hired them directly.
