“Mr. Xia, you’re too kind. It’s just a few hours.” The capable young man said respectfully,”you can enjoy your lunch to your heart’s content. If you have any needs, you can ask. We will do our best to satisfy you!”

Xia ruofei and Tang Yitian’s relationship wasn’t ordinary, so he didn’t try to be pretentious. He nodded and said,”Alright, thank you!”

“You’re too polite! This is our job!” The capable young man said respectfully. After he finished speaking, he bowed slightly to Xia ruofei and retreated to the side to make sure that he would not disturb Xia ruofei and the others while being able to be at his beck and call.

Xia ruofei, Feng Jing, and Dong Yun were standing at the edge of the pool, looking at the Sydney Opera House. Xia ruofei smiled and said,””The location of this hotel is really good. The view from the top floor is really good!”

“This is one of the most expensive hotels in Sydney, so of course it’s good!” Feng Rao grinned. According to the standard of our business trip, we certainly can’t stay in such an expensive hotel, but Mr. Tang insisted on this arrangement, and he even covered all the expenses. It’s hard to refuse such kindness!”

“Big brother Tang is one of us, so there’s no need to have any psychological burden.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’ll return all the favors the company owes anyway! Sister ran, you can’t say that I abandoned the company again! Look at how well the security work is done.” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“That’s because Mr. Tang did a good job …” Feng Jing said.

“Big brother Tang, you’re just giving me face. Therefore, my contribution can not be erased!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

The three of them chatted for a while, and then Liu Qian brought the second batch of staff to the top floor.

When everyone saw the borderless pool and the beautiful scenery, they couldn’t help but shout and wail. Everyone was very excited.

Xia ruofei smiled and invited everyone to find a place to sit. Then, he walked over and said,””My dear colleagues, you’ve all traveled thousands of miles to Sydney for a business trip. For this afternoon, on my behalf, 1 would like to thank everyone for their hard work! Everyone, please don’t be so reserved. We’ve booked the entire place, so you can enjoy all the good food and wine as you wish!”

“Long live the chairman!”

“Thank you, Chairman!”

The young employees all cheered.

“This is the Chairman’s concern for everyone,” Feng Jing said. “Everyone must work harder to repay the chairman!” We’re supposed to rest today, so you can drink some wine at noon, rest in the hotel for a while in the afternoon, or go out for a walk. But for safety reasons, you must leave the hotel together and not go out alone. You must report to Liu Qian and keep communication open, understand?”

“Understood!” The employees responded in unison.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”President Feng, you don’t have to be so serious!” We’re all adults, and those who were sent abroad must be outstanding. Don’t treat them like children …”

“Chairman, 1 brought them out, so I have to be responsible for them and their families …” Feng Jing said.

“Yes, yes, yes, you’re right, President Feng!” Xia ruofei quickly waved his hand and said,”I won’t interfere with the company’s specific Affairs. We’ll do as you say!”

Then, Xia ruofei said to the staff,””Everyone, you must remember what boss Feng said, understand?”

“I’ll remember that, Chairman!” The employees responded.

Seeing this, Feng Rao couldn’t help but burst out laughing. Everyone was used to Feng Rao’s stern look, so they couldn’t help but be a little dazed when they saw her acting like a little girl.

Feng Rao cleared her throat and said,”alright, everyone can enjoy your lunch!” This is the Chairman’s kind intentions, everyone must not let him down!”

The lunch banquet at noon was not the kind of banquet that was commonly seen in China, but similar to a pool party. The hotel’s Executive Chef and a few other chefs were busy cooking a variety of food, and everyone could take a plate and eat according to their own preferences. The hotel had also arranged for many waiters to shuttle through the venue. The waiters ‘trays had all kinds of wine, juice, and so on, which could also be taken at will.

“Mr. Xia, you’re too kind. It’s just a few hours.” The capable young man said respectfully,”you can enjoy your lunch to your heart’s content. If you have any needs, you can ask. We will do our best to satisfy you!”
