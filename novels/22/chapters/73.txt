Chapter 74: Deputy County Head Wu (1)

The succulent saplings produced by Taoyuan butcher shop were far more popular than Xia ruofei had imagined. Many succulent players who had not bought them left comments in the online store, strongly requesting the store owner to replenish his stock. Xia ruofei fell into deep thought. He felt that he should change the model a little in the future. The next time he cut, he would definitely cultivate more succulent seedlings. This time, he had reserved more than 20 pots to cultivate into the mother plant. When the next batch of products was put on the shelves, they couldn’t put them all out in one go. They had to be separated into batches. Otherwise, they would have to wait for ten to twenty days every time they ran out of stock, and the consumers ‘patience would soon be worn out. Moreover, the succulents would grow with every day they stayed in the medium. Xia ruofei could definitely sell them at a higher price. However, it was already like this. No matter how capable Xia ruofei was, it was impossible for him to produce new succulents. Hence, he could only put up another announcement to inform everyone that there would be a new round of sales in 15 days. Then, Xia ruofei downloaded the express form template from SF Express’s official website and filled in the order information one by one. Then, he printed the express form that he had retrieved last time and printed the order. Xia ruofei took out a stack of printed orders, took out the spirit map scroll, and entered the space. He started to pack them according to the order information. More than 160 pots of succulents were divided into about 60 orders. Xia ruofei had to work for more than three hours in the interspace before he could finish all of them. More than 60 paper boxes were tightly sealed. Every box was stuffed with shockproof foam strips, and the succulent plants inside were also tightly wrapped in bubble bags. A printed express delivery form was directly pasted on the outside of the box. After Xia ruofei left the spirit map space, he kept the painting close to his body. Then, he went to the garage downstairs and took out all the boxes that he had packed. Then, Xia ruofei called Shunfeng express’s Changping County branch and asked them to send a car over as soon as possible. At the same time, he asked them to bring some blank express forms over. Today, he had used up more than half of the 100 express forms he had collected last time. By the time the express delivery company took away the boxes, the morning had passed. Xia ruofei looked at the delivery company’s small truck as it drove away. Thinking that he would be able to earn 150 to 160 thousand Yuan very soon, he was naturally in a good mood. After lunch, Xia ruofei started to consider renting the surrounding villas. He thought that Wu Liqian’s relative was able to get a piece of land here probably because of Wu Liqian’s relationship. That was why the other party was so forthright when he rented the house. It seemed that he had to ask Wu Liqian about this matter. After Xia ruofei made up his mind, he took out his phone and called Wu Liqian. “Hello, little Xia!” Wu Liqian answered the phone and said enthusiastically. “Sis Wu, you sound like you’re on cloud nine. Are you going to be promoted soon?” Xia ruofei asked half – jokingly. Wu Liqian laughed and said,” “I’m just a Secretary, how high can I be promoted?” Then, Wu Liqian lowered her voice and said,” “But there might be some changes in work recently ... The boss’s matter has basically been decided, and the organization has already spoken to him.” Xia ruofei was stunned. He didn’t expect that his joke would hit the mark. Tian Huilan’s promotion to the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee and the three mountain Police had always been popular. Now it seemed that this matter was already set in stone. Otherwise, no matter how good his personal relationship with the Tian family was, Wu Liqian would not have leaked such news. Xia ruofei then thought of something else. Usually, when a leader was transferred out, the Secretary wouldn’t be taken away. In Tian Huilan’s case, she was promoted on the spot. Logically, Wu Liqian could also follow Tian Huilan to the municipal Party Committee. However, from Wu Liqian’s tone, it didn’t seem to be as simple as transferring from the government to the municipal Party Committee. Xia ruofei thought for a moment and then smiled.””Sis Wu, are you going to be released? Then I must congratulate you in advance!” Wu Liqian was obviously in a good mood. She smiled and said,””Yo! Your nose is quite sharp!” “They’re really being released! Congratulations!” Xia ruofei quickly said,”sis Wu, is it convenient for you to reveal where you’re going?” Xia ruofei knew that the mayor’s Secretary would not be too bad, especially since Tian Huilan had raised her rank on the spot. Sure enough, Wu Liqian smiled and said in a low voice,””The organization is preparing to let me take on the position of deputy head of the Chang Ping District, but it hasn’t been decided yet.” Xia ruofei immediately said,”then I really have to congratulate you!” Sis Wu, you’ll be like a dragon entering the ocean, you can do whatever you want now!” In general, the position arrangement of the mayor’s Secretary would be different according to the level of the Secretary. Wu Liqian should be at the Deputy level. At her level, there was a lot of attention paid to the position arrangement. An ordinary Deputy position in the administrative Bureau was naturally different from the Deputy position in the county below. It was already a good arrangement to be appointed as a Deputy County Head, not to mention that Wu Liqian was also an executive Deputy County Head. She was directly promoted to the Standing Committee of the county party Committee, which was naturally worthy of congratulations. Anyone with a discerning eye could tell that Wu Liqian’s position was only a transition. With Tian Huilan’s help in the city, it wouldn’t be difficult for her to make achievements in the position of executive Deputy County Head. By then, she would naturally be adjusted to the main level and even have experience in holding a position at the grassroots. “I’m counting on your blessings!” Wu Liqian said with a smile, then asked,”Oh right, Xia, did you need something from me today?” “There’s something I need to trouble you with. ” Xia ruofei said,”but ... If you want to take up a position in Changping County, I don’t know if it’ll be convenient ...” “What’s the matter first?” Wu Liqian laughed.”Even if I work in Changping County, I still have connections with the municipal government ...” “Sis Wu, you’ve misunderstood.” Xia ruofei said,”I wanted to rent the land near this holiday villa to build a vegetable base. I wanted to ask you about the situation. Now that you’re coming to Chang Ping County to take up a position, and it’s at this time, I’m just afraid it’ll be a little inconvenient. ” Wu Liqian laughed and said,”so that’s what it is!” Xiao Xia, you’re worrying too much ... You want to invest in Changping County and support our economic development. This is a good thing! What’s so inconvenient about it?” “Sis Wu, you’re getting into the situation pretty quickly!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”as expected of the mayor’s Secretary. You have a high level of insight!” “You bastard! If you dare to laugh at me again, I won’t help you!” Wu Liqian said angrily. Xia ruofei quickly replied,”I don’t dare!” In the future, my vegetable base will be in your Changping County, and you will be my official! I wouldn’t dare to laugh at you!” “Alright, alright, let’s not joke around anymore. The land you’re talking about belongs to the Dongkeng village of jianggang town. ” Wu Liqian smiled and said,”how about this, Xia? I’ll talk to the people in charge of jianggang town and give you a call. You can contact them directly. It’ll be fine!” “Alright! I’m relieved to hear that. ” Xia ruofei said happily,”thank you, sis Wu!”Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com
