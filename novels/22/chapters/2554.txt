2555 Super elevator ball (1)

Woos couldn’t help but loudly defend himself, while at the same time he kept making diving movements, indicating that Wu Lei was “diving,” which meant a dive.

However, the main judge was unmoved. He walked straight to worthy, reached into his pocket, and took out a card, flashing it at him.

It was only then that everyone saw that the hand of the referee was actually red!

The home fans in the stadium immediately booed loudly, and all of Valencia’s players on the field surrounded them. Voss was even more agitated, blocking in front of the referee and trying to explain himself. His saliva was almost on the referee’s face.

“Mister! How could this be a red card!” Weiss had an innocent expression on his face.”I didn’t even touch him! This Chinese man is a shameless liar!”

The referee shook his head and then pointed to the outside of the field with a firm look, indicating that woos should stop pestering him and leave the field as soon as possible.

In fact, everyone knew that when the main referee made a decision, it was extremely unlikely for him to overturn his decision and change the judgment, unless it was a major misjudgment related to a goal, penalty kick, or red card. According to the rules, the assistant referee could remind the main referee through the walkie – talkie, but the final decision was still in the hands of the main referee.

Like this ball, if there was a problem with the referee’s decision, the video assistant referee would remind him over the walkie – talkie. After all, it involved a red card.

No matter what the result was, every time there was a penalty that was not conducive to their side, the players would certainly rush forward to appeal. At this time, everyone was as innocent as a little white rabbit.

In China’s capital, PP sports studio.

Shen fangjian said,”I don’t know what’s there to argue about.” The action of pulling him up was so obvious that Wu Lei’s Jersey was deformed! Also, Wu Lei has a chance for a one – on – one shot, and woos is the last defender besides the goalkeeper. According to the rules, this is definitely a red card!”

Jia Tianning said with some regret,”Xia ruofei’s pass just now could be said to be wonderful. It’s a pity that such a good one – on – one opportunity was wasted!” Even though Valencia paid the price of a red card, she managed to secure the lead in the score. In the next 20 minutes, they will definitely be more determined to defend. After all, it’s 10 against 11. ” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Shen fangjian said,”the most infuriating thing is this place!” If Wu Lei advanced another ten meters, he would at least get a good free kick. Of course, it would be even better if he could break into the penalty area! But now ... The goal is nearly 35 meters away from the goal. This excellent chance to score can be said to be far away from the RCD Espanyol!”

On the internet, the Chinese fans ‘imaginations were running wild. The most liked comment was as follows:

Woos didn’t do enough homework before the game! He definitely didn’t know Wu Lei’s characteristics! Otherwise, he would have just let the ball go. Now, he was sent off with a red card ...

He was ridiculing Wu Lei’s impenetrable defense.

On the court, Valencia’s players gradually accepted the result. Woos, under the persuasion of his teammates, slowly walked off the court with a wronged expression. Since it was already an irreversible fact that he had been sent off, he could only make one last contribution to the team, which was to leave the court as slowly as possible. It was good to buy some time.

Instead of going straight back to the locker room after leaving the field, vos stood at the players ‘passageway and looked around.

On the other side, the Spaniards were ready to take the free kick.

In the PP sports studio, Shen fangjian said in surprise,””Xia ruofei is the main penalty?”

“It looks like it. Xia ruofei is standing in front of the ball alone. There’s no one to cover him.” Jia Tianning said.

“I didn’t expect Xia ruofei to become the first free – kick player the moment he joined the team!” Shen fangjian said with a smile.

Jia Tianning said,”the distance of the ball is too far. The possibility of a direct shot is very low. From today’s game, Xia ruofei’s footwork is still very outstanding. I think he will be the one to hang the ball into the penalty area. As for whether to snatch the nodding ball to attack the goal or to do it back and then shoot, it will depend on the tactical arrangement of the Spanish team.”

In fact, Jia Tianning was not the only one who made such a judgment. The Valencia players on the field thought so too. Youyou only sent two players to form a symbolic human wall. Most of their forces were concentrated in the penalty area, ready to grab the first drop point.

The Spaniards also sent a considerable number of players to wander back and forth in the penalty area, making it look like they were fighting for the drop point.

The referee showed the whistle in his hand to Xia ruofei, indicating that he wanted to hear the whistle for the penalty shot.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. The main judge then ran to the side and blew the whistle.

“Let’s take a look at this free kick!” Shen fangjian said,”Xia ruofei’s run – up distance is not far. It seems that coach Jia’s judgment is right. This ball will not be shot directly.”

For such a long – ranged free kick, if he were to shoot directly, he must retreat a sufficient distance. Only through a sufficient distance of run – up could he ensure that the kick had enough initial speed.

Now, Xia ruofei had only taken three or four steps back. He had no intention of directly opening the door.

Valencia’s goalkeeper, Neto, was also focused on the penalty area. His biggest advantage in the penalty area was that he could use his hands. After the ball was hung into the penalty area, he would rush up immediately. It would be best if he could pick it up directly. If it was not easy to get, he would at least drive the ball out of the penalty area and keep it away from the danger zone.
