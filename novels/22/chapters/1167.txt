Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei had returned to the farm after dinner.

Ling Xiaotian had been drunk for the entire afternoon. He did not even have much energy during dinner. The two of them did not drink at night. Instead, they made some tea and chatted for a while after dinner.

Ling Xiaotian also suggested that Xia ruofei should not go home tonight. However, Xia ruofei felt that he was not married to Ling Qingxue yet, and it was not appropriate for him to stay in a lady’s boudoir in front of his future father – in – Law. Besides, Ling Qingxue looked shy, and the two of them had already been intimate for the entire afternoon, so he rejected him tactfully.

The next evening, Xia ruofei arrived at a private restaurant on jiangbin road as promised.

Private restaurants had become more popular recently. Of course, the most famous one was still the Ling’s private restaurant.

However, Song Wei knew about Xia ruofei’s relationship with the owner of Ling Ji’s private kitchen, so she did not set the meeting place there. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

This private restaurant, called Chen family cuisine, was quite famous in Sanshan city. Its dishes were very unique, and there was an endless stream of customers.

When Xia ruofei arrived at Chen family cuisine’s Jinyue Pavillion, Song Wei and her friends had already arrived.

Song Wei was more careful. She had arranged to meet her friends 15 minutes earlier than Xia ruofei.

As soon as Xia ruofei entered the door, Song Wei stood up with a smile and said,””RUO Fei is here! Quickly come in and sit!”

Seeing this, Song Wei’s friends exchanged glances.

Before she came, Song Wei had repeatedly told them that her guest today was very important and that they should not be throwing tantrums. Otherwise, it would mean that they were not giving her face and that they should not come.

After everyone had arrived, Song Wei brought up this matter again. She seemed to take it very seriously.

Now, Song Wei was the 1st daughter of the family in Sanshan city. Even in the entire Southeast province, she was one of the top few.

The only person who could be more arrogant than her was none other than the son of the provincial government.

However, the Secretary was an official who had been demoted from Beijing. His son did not follow him to the southeast province. Instead, he continued to stay in Beijing.

Song Wei’s father, song Qiming, was not only the Secretary of the Sanshan provincial government, but also the Deputy Secretary of the southeast province. He was the third most powerful person in the province.

The Secretary of the provincial Judicial Committee, master Zhu Ji, was in the capital all year round, while the head of the provincial Court had no children. He had two nephews in the southeast province, but they were not as close as Song Wei.

Therefore, Song Wei was a well – known figure in the circle of rich Playboys in the southeast province.

Even if it was due to her personality, plus she was a girl and didn’t have many bad friends, her words still carried weight.

Therefore, after Song Wei’s repeated reminders, everyone took it very seriously. At the same time, they were also guessing who the mysterious guest was that could make lady song so concerned.

When Xia ruofei appeared, everyone saw that it was a young man and Song Wei immediately stood up to welcome him personally. They could not help but have some wild thoughts.

Song Wei didn’t realize that her actions had caused a misunderstanding. She smiled and went up to them,”Ruofei, come here. I’ll introduce you to some friends!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. His eyes swept across the faces of the young masters and young ladies on the sofa. Suddenly, his eyes stopped and he couldn’t help but exclaim,””Lu You?”

Lu You already knew that Xia ruofei would be coming today. Song Wei knew that she was close to Xia ruofei, so she naturally wouldn’t keep her in suspense.

From the moment Xia ruofei entered the door, Lu You’s gaze had never left Xia ruofei.

Seeing that Xia ruofei had noticed her, Lu You stood up from the sofa with a smile and walked to Xia ruofei unhurriedly. She said graciously,””Xia ruofei, I bet you didn’t expect us to meet so soon!”

Xia ruofei touched his head and said with a bitter smile,””I’m indeed a little surprised ...”

“Ruofei, I know that you’re close to Lu You. That’s why I invited her today. It’s your first time meeting these friends. You might feel too restrained ...” Song Wei said with a smile.

Xia ruofei sighed in his heart, sister! It would be fine if you didn’t ask Lu You to come, but I’d be more reserved if you asked her to come!

However, he could only clench his teeth and say,””Thank you, Song Wei ...”

“Hi!” Song Wei said with a smile. What’s there to be polite about? Come, come, come, everyone, take a seat! I’ll introduce them to everyone after we sit down!”

Naturally, Song Wei sat in the main seat. Xia ruofei sat on the seat to her right.

Originally, even if Xia ruofei was the main guest today, Lu You would definitely be sitting on the seat to the left of Song Wei. This was the second seat among the guests, so the first seat would naturally be Xia ruofei ‘s.

This was because Lu You’s mother was song Qiming’s ex, and her current rank was even higher than song Qiming ‘s.

If it wasn’t for the fact that Tian Huilan had already gone to the capital to become an official, Song Wei’s position would have been Lu You ‘s.

However, Lu You didn’t wait for Song Wei’s arrangements. She walked straight to the seat beside Xia ruofei and sat down.

This way, it wouldn’t be good for the children of the hall and Bureau leaders to sit in the taxi. No one dared to sit in front of Lu You!

Song Wei was stunned for a moment, then she immediately smiled and said, “It’s fine to sit there and talk to ruofei more! Everyone, feel free to sit! It’s not like this is a government meeting, why would they care about the ranking?”
