Translator: 549690339

At noon, Xia ruofei carried a small jar of Drunken Eight Immortals wine stored in the spirit map space to Ling Xiaotian’s house.

After Xia ruofei pressed the doorbell, Ling Qingxue’s voice came through the intercom system at the door.””RUO Fei, quickly come in!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the iron door opened with a click.

Xia ruofei pushed the door open and walked through the courtyard to the entrance of the villa. Ling Qingxue had already opened the door. She stood at the door and waved at Xia ruofei with a bright smile.”Come in!” “You’re wearing this pair of shoes!” Ling Qingxue smiled and said,”new slippers. No one has used them before.”

“Thank you, my wife!” Xia ruofei chuckled and asked,”where’s uncle Ling?”

“The kitchen! My dad insisted on cooking for us, and he’s been busy for an hour or two!” Ling Qingxue said with a smile.

Xia ruofei changed into his slippers and walked into the villa. Ling Qingxue called out,””Dad! RUO Fei is here!”

Ling Xiaotian, who was wearing an apron, quickly walked out of the kitchen with a spatula in his hand. When he saw Xia ruofei, he greeted him with a smile,””RUO Fei is here!”

“Uncle Ling, how are you?” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Good, good, good!” Ling Xiaotian chuckled and said,”ruofei, sit in the living room for a while and have some tea with Qingxue. Two more dishes will be ready!” Let’s have a good drink this afternoon!”

Xia ruofei put down the jar of Drunken Eight Immortals and said,””Uncle Ling, let me come over and help!”

“No need, no need, no need!” Ling Xiaotian said,”the dishes will be ready soon, and there’s also a soup that’s still being stewed. 1’11 stir – fry some more vegetables and it’ll be done. The kitchen is filled with oil and smoke, so don’t come in!”

Ling Qingxue chuckled and said,”ruofei, just let my dad do his work!” It’s rare for him to personally cook a meal all year round, so let him do his best!”

“This…”

“Don’t say that! Come and have some tea!” Ling Qingxue pushed Xia ruofei into the living room. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Ling Xiaotian chuckled and returned to the kitchen to continue cooking.

In a short while, Ling Xiaotian carried a bowl of soup out of the kitchen. He placed it gently on the dining table and called out,””Ruofei, Qingxue, come and eat!”

Xia ruofei quickly stood up and said,””Uncle Ling, I’ll help serve the dishes!”

He did not help out with the cooking. Now that the dishes were ready, Xia ruofei definitely had to go and help. This fiancee – in – Law had to be more diligent.

Ling Xiaotian didn’t stop them, and the three of them quickly brought out the dishes that Ling Xiaotian had meticulously prepared.

Ling Xiaotian wiped his hands on his apron, then took off the apron and put it aside. He chuckled and said,””Ruofei, I saw you bring good wine. Let’s not drink my wine this afternoon!”

“Mm! Uncle Ling, have a taste of the wine I brought, it’s the best Drunken Eight Immortals!” Xia ruofei said with a smile. Then, he placed the jar of Drunken Eight Immortals on the dining table and deftly opened the lid. Immediately, a strong aroma of wine wafted out.

Ling Qingxue took the wine divider and Xia ruofei poured some of the wine in the jar into it. Then, he sealed the jar.

Ling Xiaotian took the wine container, but he was not in a hurry to pour the wine. Instead, he brought it to his nose and sniffed it, revealing a trace of an intoxicated expression.

Then, he poured himself a small cup and took a sip. He closed his eyes and savored the aftertaste for a long time before sighing.”This taste is really rich! Ruofei, if we’re talking about good wine, then your wine is really the best!”

“Uncle Ling likes it. I’ll bring a few more jars over in the afternoon. You can take your time to drink!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Ling Xiaotian smiled and waved his hand.”I don’t need that much. 1 don’t drink much now. I only drink a small cup every day.” Daughter said that drinking too much is harmful to the body!”

“It’s good that you remember!” Ling Qingxue smiled and said,”but it’s a happy day today, so you can make an exception and drink a few more glasses. But you’re not allowed to get drunk!”

“Hahaha! Since my daughter has given special permission, I’ll drink two more glasses today!” Ling Xiaotian said happily.

The three of them sat down around the dining table. Ling Qingxue poured Xia ruofei a glass of wine. After some thought, she poured a glass of Drunken Eight Immortals for herself.

Ling Qingxue didn’t usually drink white wine, but she had been away for so long this time. It was rare for Ling Xiaotian to be in such a good mood, so she decided to have a drink with everyone.

Ling Xiaotian looked at the wine in his cup and said,””Ruofei, speaking of this Drunken Eight Immortals wine, 1 can’t help but complain … You’ve been out for more than two months, and the winery is going crazy with anxiety!”

Xia ruofei looked a little embarrassed. The reason why the Drunken Eight Immortals wine was so popular in the country was because of the rich spiritual energy in the spirit map space and the difference in time flow. Hence, Xia ruofei would collect the freshly brewed wine from the winery every month and put it in the spirit map space. Then, he would take out the wine that had been stored in the spirit map space for a period of time and have the winery transport it back, seal it, and sell it.

This time, Xia ruofei had been aw^ay for more than two months. The winery must have been the most affected. They might have run out of stock.

Xia ruofei scratched his head in embarrassment and said,””Uncle Ling, I’m sorry! This time, 1 haven’t finished dealing with some things and can’t get aw^ay. Did it affect the winery’s operation?”

Ling Xiaotian waved his hand and said,”the wine factory has always kept some stock in case of an unexpected situation!” It’s not that we’re completely out of stock, but w^e’re really running out of stock.. If you’d come back any later, the winery would’ve had to close down for the time being!”
