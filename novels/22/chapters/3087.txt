3088 A strange request (2)

Chen Nanfeng muttered to himself for a moment before saying,””Then ... Let’s go with this ... PhD! Xuan ‘er, use this skill and apply for a technical position in the secular world. Go to a company in the secular world and gain some experience!”

Chen Xuan felt that this was a little ridiculous as he laughed bitterly in his heart. However, he still nodded his head and said,””Yes! Father, I’ll leave tomorrow!”

“Alright, it’s good to go for experience earlier.” Chen Nanfeng nodded and said,”by the way, Xuan ‘er, for your training this time, go directly to a company in San Shan city, Southeast province for an interview! It’s called paradise Corporation. ”

Chen Xuan couldn’t help but be taken aback. He was well aware that this company didn’t belong to the first heaven society. Based on his understanding of the cultivation world, it didn’t seem to belong to any other sect in the secular world either.

It was very likely that this was really just a company in the secular world.

However, his father had been cultivating in the first heaven sect and had almost never left the sect. Why did he suddenly pay attention to a company in the southeast province? Moreover, he had specifically asked him to go there to gain experience ...

Chen Xuan knew that his father had a deeper meaning, but since Chen Nanfeng didn’t want to say it, he couldn’t ask for more details. He could only nod and say,””Okay, then I’ll go to this paradise Corporation ...”

Even though Chen Xuan didn’t know what his father’s intentions were, training was still training. Chen Xuan felt that all he had to do was to follow his father’s instructions. As for what his father’s intentions were, he would find out when the time came. “Xuan ‘er,” Chen Nanfeng said,”I’ll remind you again. If you go to this company for an interview, you can only use the PS you mentioned just now ...”

“PHP!”Chen Xuan said.

“Yes, this is the same PhD technology.” Chen Nanfeng said,”other than that, you are not allowed to show any of the other abilities you have learned in business management. You are also not allowed to use the methods of cultivators. Only this kind of training will be effective.”

Chen Xuan was already immune to Chen Nanfeng’s strange request. He replied without hesitation,””Yes! The child would obey his father’s instructions! You can send an elder to supervise the child ...”

“There’s no need for that!” Chen Nanfeng chuckled and said,”of course, I believe in you, Xuan ‘er. This experience might have a profound impact on your cultivation career. I hope you can cheer up and calm down to go to that company to train!”

“Yes!” Chen Xuan replied.

“Then you go! It’s getting late, and you’re going to the three mountains tomorrow. Don’t cultivate tonight and rest early. ” Chen Nanfeng said,”take the Clearwater flying boat with you. You don’t have to come here tomorrow to say goodbye!” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Yes! Father, you should rest early too! This child will take his leave!” Chen Xuan stood up and bowed slightly to Chen Nanfeng.

“Go!” Chen Nanfeng said.

However, just as Chen Xuan was about to reach the door, Chen Nanfeng spoke again,””Wait!”

Hearing this, Chen Xuan stopped in his tracks and turned around.””Father, do you have any other orders?”

With a flip of his hand, Chen Nanfeng took out the two five Saints tokens from his storage ring. With a wave of his hand, the two tokens floated towards Chen Xuan.

“Take these two tokens with you,” Chen Nanfeng said.”You can study them more when you’re free. I have a feeling that the last five Saints token will be born soon ...”

Chen Xuan reached out to receive the five Saints token. With a look of hesitation, he could not help but ask,””Father, if I take the token away, does that mean that elder Chen and the others won’t be able to study it?”

There was a group of people in the heavenly sect whose main business was to study the five sacred writs, and elder Chen, who was a mid – Stage golden core cultivator, was the leader.

“I’ve been researching for so many years,” Chen Nanfeng waved his hand and said.”I haven’t had any results. Let them all rest for this period of time! It was a good time to change his mind. You didn’t study the five sages token much in the past. You should use the time you have during this experiential learning to study it more when you have the time!”

Even though Chen Xuan felt that it was strange, he did not dare to question Chen Nanfeng’s words.

Thus, Chen Xuan carefully kept the five Saints token into his storage ring and said,””I understand! Father, if there are no other instructions, then I will take my leave!”

“Go!” Chen Xuan waved his hand.

In truth, there was still a certain risk to Chen Xuan bringing the five Saints token out of the sect.

However, Chen Xuan was an early – Stage golden core cultivator. As the young sect master, he had many ways to protect himself. He also had many more Dharma Treasures than ordinary cultivators. Under normal circumstances, even a mid – Stage golden core cultivator wouldn’t be able to do anything to him.

Therefore, as long as it wasn’t a premeditated Alliance of some sects and powers to deal with Chen Xuan, his safety could still be guaranteed.

The safety of the five Holy badges would naturally not be a problem.

As such, even though Chen Xuan felt that it was a little strange, he was not too worried about the fact that he would not be able to keep the five Holy badges.

After Chen Xuan took his leave, Chen Nanfeng sat behind his desk in a daze. After a long time, he sighed and muttered to himself,””Danger and opportunity co – exist in the southeast. I hope that Xuan ‘er will be able to break through the fog in his life Providence and walk a bright path ...” Even though Chen Xuan didn’t know his father’s intentions, he felt that he just had to follow his father’s instructions. As for what his father’s intentions were, he would naturally find out when the time came. “Xuan ‘er,” Chen Nanfeng said,”I’ll remind you again.
