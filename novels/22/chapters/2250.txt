2251 The happy times of master and disciple (1)

Everyone came to the spacious living room below the mushroom house and sat around the tea table to chat.

Huang Lei and the others were very interested in the relationship between Xia ruofei and Tang Yitian’s family. Tang Yitian didn’t hide anything and told them about the first time they met Xia ruofei.

Of course, he knew what he should say and what he shouldn ‘t, so he certainly wouldn’t say anything about Tang Haoran’s special physique. He only said that they had met by chance on the flight to Sydney, and that Tang Haoran suddenly fell ill on the plane and was in a very dangerous situation. Xia ruofei happened to know how to perform first aid and saved Tang Haoran’s life in time.

With Xia ruofei’s military experience, it was normal for him to have some first aid knowledge. Even if this part was broadcasted, it would not affect Xia ruofei much.

The Huaxia families who knew about Xia ruofei’s amazing medical skills did not need to get information through a program.

After listening to Tang Yitian and Jennifer’s story, He Jiong, Huang Lei, and the others couldn’t help but sigh, sighing at the wonder of fate between people.

According to Tang Yitian, there weren’t any other doctors on the plane at that time. Whether it was to return or to find the nearest airport to land, there wasn’t enough time. If Xia ruofei hadn’t acted in time, Tang Haoran’s life would have been in danger.

It was this accident that caused Xia ruofei and Tang Yitian’s family to have an unsolvable fate.

After chatting for a while, He Jiong began to assign work to everyone again.

Huang Lei’s task today was more important. Jennifer volunteered to stay behind to help with the kitchen, Peng Chang was in charge of the fire and helping out, while he Jiong brought Zhang Xing and Tang Yitian to town to buy groceries.

Xia ruofei’s task was to take care of the greenhouse with Tang Haoran and pick some vegetables for lunch.

Xia ruofei had already gone to the vegetable greenhouse yesterday. The greenhouse was originally built with the help of Tao Yuan company and all the vegetables inside came from Tao Yuan farm. In the eyes of He Jiong and the others, Xia ruofei was the most professional, so there was no need for the permanent guests to accompany him today.

Tang Haoran had lived in a rich environment since he was a child. The opportunity to be close to nature and do manual labor could be said to be very rare. He was quite excited in the vegetable greenhouse.

Although the little guy was still young, he was a cultivator after all. Naturally, he was not as weak as an ordinary child. He could complete the watering and cultivating work in the vegetable greenhouse as long as Xia ruofei gave him a few instructions.

The master and disciple cooperated very well, and the work was quickly completed.

Xia ruofei held Tang Haoran’s hand in one hand and carried a big basket of fresh vegetables in the other. The two of them returned to the mushroom hut.

After the vegetables were brought back, Peng Chang, who was in charge of assisting, immediately took over the task of washing and picking the vegetables.

Xia ruofei and Tang Haoran had nothing to do since he Jiong and the others who went to town to buy groceries had not returned yet.

Xia ruofei strolled around the mushroom hut for a while. Seeing that he could not help much in the kitchen, he strolled to the tool shed.

He immediately saw the fishing rod leaning against the wall of the tool shed and was immediately interested.

“Haoran!” Xia ruofei called out.

“Teacher, I’m here!” Tang Haoran said as he stuck his head out of the door.

Xia ruofei pointed at the fishing rod and said,”how about I bring you fishing?”

“Great!” Tang Haoran said excitedly. Good!”

There was a full set of fishing equipment here. Xia ruofei carried two fishing rods on his back, a plastic bucket and two small folding stools in his hands, and a bag of bait in his pocket. Tang Haoran carried a net bag. The two of them beckoned to Huang Lei and Jennifer in the kitchen and walked towards the lake.

The lakeside on the side of the mushroom house had been built with a landscape Plank Road. The plank Road was curved along the lakeside, and some places even protruded out. It was a bit similar to the three – sided water – surrounded intimate platform on a yacht, but there was an additional railing.

The railings of this kind of Plank Road were also very low, not even reaching the height of an adult’s knee. It was more for people who were taking a stroll to sit on it at any time to rest.

Xia ruofei and Tang Haoran found a Plank Road platform.

The small folding stool he brought was of no use, so the master and disciple sat directly on the railing.

Xia ruofei skillfully prepared the fishing tools. He and Tang Haoran each held a fishing rod. They sat on the railing and started fishing.

He didn’t use his spiritual power to check the situation of the fish in the water. Just like an ordinary fisherman, he stared at the buoy on the water and came here to relax his body and mind. As for whether he could catch any fish or how many fish he could catch, Xia ruofei didn’t care.

This was the mentality of “fishing is better than fishing” as mentioned in the books.

There were quite a lot of fish in the lake, and the festival team had specially set up a large area of water near the mushroom house to keep a lot of fish. After all, the environment here was so good that it was perfect for fishing. There would be so many programs in the future, and the guests could all experience the fun of fishing.

Moreover, the pictures taken here were quite beautiful.

Even though he did not care about the catch, some fish took the bait very quickly. Xia ruofei saw the buoy on the water surface shaking slightly. He ignored Tang Haoran’s excited hand gesture and kept his calm as he stared at the buoy. Usually, at this time, the fish were just testing the waters and did not really take the bait.

The buoy trembled a few times before it suddenly sank. Xia ruofei then held the fishing rod with both hands and swung it backward. A struggling carp was pulled out of the water.

The carp was about the size of a palm and was firmly hooked by the hook. Its tail was still wagging wildly, making a futile struggle.

Tang Haoran excitedly put down his fishing rod, picked up the net bag next to him, and caught the fish.

Xia ruofei kept the fishing rod and the master and disciple unhooked the carp in the net together.

Xia ruofei picked up the plastic bucket behind him and filled it with water. Then, he threw the carp into the bucket.

“That’s a good start!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”Haoran, you have to work hard too!”

“En!” Tang Haoran nodded his head heavily.

He pulled up the fishing rod to take a look and found that the bait on the hook had been eaten. It must have been in the short time he put down the fishing rod.

Tang Haoran pulled his fishing rod back gloomily and asked Xia ruofei to help him hook the bait.

The bait on Xia ruofei’s hook had been used up, so he put on another bait on his own hook. The master and disciple started fishing again.

There must be a lot of fish in the lake. After a while, another fish bit the hook on Tang Haoran’s side. Unfortunately, the little guy was too anxious. He pulled the fishing rod impatiently, but the fish came out of the water. It only struggled a few times before it escaped the hook. It fell into the water with a splash and swam away without a trace.

Xia ruofei chuckled as he explained the essentials of fishing to Tang Haoran. After a few words of advice, he helped him to put on the bait again. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Tang Haoran’s comprehension was still very strong. After reigniting the flag and drum, he really caught a chub very quickly.

This fish wasn’t too big either, about the same size as the carp that Xia ruofei had caught.

Tang Haoran was so excited that he almost jumped up. This was the first time in his life that he had caught a fish with his own hands. Xia ruofei patted his head lovingly and said,””Haoran, let’s keep it up! Catch a few more and you can eat the fish you caught yourself at noon!”

“Yes, yes!” Tang Haoran nodded and said.

Just like that, the master and disciple sat by the lake for more than an hour and caught more than a dozen fish. Although they weren’t particularly big, they definitely wouldn’t be able to finish it in one meal.

Xia ruofei saw that it was almost time to take the fish back and give Huang Lei some time to cook. If he took it any later, he would have already finished preparing lunch.

He called out to Tang Haoran, who was still unsatisfied, and packed up his things.

Tang Haoran was very strong. He had to personally carry the bucket of fish. The master and disciple talked and laughed as they walked back, like a general who had returned victorious.

He Jiong, Tang Yitian and Zhang Xing had already returned to the mushroom hut.

Zhang Xing might have gone to help out in the kitchen, while he Jiong and Tang Yitian were sitting under the gazebo, making tea and chatting.

Before Tang Haoran even entered the house, he could not help but shout,””Dad! Mother! My teacher and I caught so many fish! We can have an extra lunch!”

Everyone came out to greet him, including Huang Lei, who was very curious. He turned down the fire for the soup and walked out.

Huang Lei wiped his hands on his apron and said with a smile,””I’m here to see if our Haoran’s harvest is enough for a dish. ”

“There are more than ten of them!” Tang Haoran was not afraid of strangers. He proudly showed the bucket to everyone.

Huang Lei and the rest looked at the dozens of fish in the bucket and couldn’t help but show their admiration. They all looked at Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”at least half of the fish here were caught by Haoran!” We’re going to have a good meal at noon! Teacher Huang, I’ll have to trouble you to make one more dish!”

“No problem! No problem!” Huang Lei quickly said.

Seeing their son so happy, Tang Yitian and Jennifer were also very happy. They felt that it was the right decision to accept xiangnan TV’s invitation to participate in the show.

Originally, they had only agreed to xiangnan TV’s invitation because they wanted to help Xia ruofei promote Paradise’s products. Now, it seemed that Tang Haoran liked this place very much. Moreover, he was able to find happiness that was impossible to find in a mansion in Sydney, Australia. Such precious childhood experiences were also very precious.

“Haoran, you’re awesome!” Tang Yitian and Jennifer both gave him a thumbs up.

He Jiong and the rest naturally did not hold back their praises. The courtyard of the mushroom hut was filled with a cheerful atmosphere.

Jennifer carried the bucket to the pond to kill the fish, while Huang Lei and the others returned to the kitchen.

Xia ruofei carried Tang Haoran and sat on the bamboo chair under the pergola. He was making tea and chatting with He Jiong and Tang Yitian.

Tang Haoran also liked Xia ruofei’s aura very much. He obediently sat on Xia ruofei’s lap and listened to the adults ‘conversation, not fully understanding.

After another half an hour or so, Huang Lei finally finished preparing lunch for the day. This was also Xia ruofei’s last meal in the mushroom house. According to the program’s schedule, Xia ruofei would have to take the Buick minivan provided by the program team to return home after lunch.

Tang Yitian’s family would stay here for the night.

The guests for the new episode would arrive the next morning. Tang Yitian’s family stayed in the mushroom house for another half a day, just like Xia ruofei did today. They left after lunch to complete their recording tasks.

At He Jiong’s call, everyone got up and went to the kitchen to help serve the food.
