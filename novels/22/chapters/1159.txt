Translator: 549690339

“Alright!” Song Rui laughed. RUO Fei, I’ve successfully completed the task you gave me! Don’t you think you should treat everyone to a meal today?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”no problem!” We’ll eat here today, I’ll cook!”

Then, Xia ruofei said to Zhao Yongjun,””Big brother Zhao, do you think this arrangement is okay? Take Wu Qiang to hand over his resignation and bring his things along. Also, buy some personal items, bedsheets, and blankets. I’m going to buy some ingredients to cook, so let’s eat here tonight!”

“No problem!” Zhao Yongjun said,”Xiao Rui, come with us!”

“Alright!” Song Rui replied.

After the division of labor was completed, everyone left the courtyard and set off separately.

Wu Qiang’s job had been arranged by Guo ruchao. Song Rui had informed Guo ruchao, and his resignation from the security company went smoothly. Xia ruofei did not have to worry.

After he walked out of the alley, he used his phone to search the nearby supermarket and found that Walmart’s Sam’s Club was not far from here.

So, he hailed a taxi at the entrance of the alley and went straight to the Sam’s shop.

In the supermarket, Xia ruofei was surprised to find that on the shelf in the vegetable section, there were some vegetables and fruits produced by the Paradise Corporation.

After Paradise Corporation expanded its production capacity, it also started to cooperate with some large super – Commercial channels, and Walmart was an important partner of paradise Corporation.

Sam’s Club was a high – end supermarket under Walmart, so it naturally got the supply of Taoyuan vegetables as soon as possible.

The location of the Taoyuan vegetables was naturally very conspicuous. Of course, the price was also quite touching. It was more than ten times more expensive than the general vegetables of the same kind.

Even so, the near – perfect appearance of Peach Garden vegetables still attracted many people to stop and watch.

Sam’s supermarket was a membership system. Every year, one had to pay more than 200 yuan for membership fees to enjoy the membership treatment. The shopping environment here was better than the general supermarket, and the purchasing power of the consumers was also relatively stronger.

Therefore, even though the price of Taoyuan vegetables was extremely high, there would still be people who would go to buy them from time to time.

Xia ruofei looked on with interest for a while, and his heart was slightly moved.

Since the hill maiden’s shop in the capital sold Taoyuan vegetables, he could say that he bought them from this place when he took out the stock in the medium!

Thinking of this, Xia ruofei smiled. He was more confident about the dinner that night.

He left the vegetable section and bought some organic mountain Black pork, beef and mutton, as well as some seasonings and cooking oil. Then, he went to the alcohol section.

Just as he had expected, there was also Drunken Eight Immortals wine for sale here.

Compared to the intimidating prices of the peach Garden vegetables, the prices of the Drunken Eight Immortals were much more affordable. Of course, this was only in comparison to the prices of white wines such as Maotai Wuliangye.

Perhaps it was because he had just expanded his business to the North, but the sales of Drunken Eight Immortals were not as good as in the southeast province. At least there were still goods on the shelves, unlike in Sanshan city, where the new goods were sold out not long after they were put on the shelves.

Since the Sam’s Club also sold Drunken Eight Immortals, Xia ruofei could take out the wine from the medium.

He had also stored a few boxes of the newly packaged Drunken Eight Immortals white wine, which were sent over by the winery’s staff Under Ling Xiaotian’s orders.

Of course, these wines had been stored in the medium for a long time, so the taste was naturally much better than the Drunken Eight Immortals series of white wine sold outside.

Xia ruofei took a taxi back to the courtyard house in liuhai Lane, carrying some meat and braised dishes that he had bought from the supermarket.

Before Zhao Yongjun and the others returned, Xia ruofei went to the kitchen in the third entrance.

When Wu shuheng renovated the house, he did spend a lot of money. The kitchen was very well – equipped. The double – door refrigerator, electric oven, microwave oven, range hood, and so on were all top brands. Even the knives and anvil were all made Germany brands.

Xia ruofei put down his things and took out the Paradise vegetables, a huge carp, and a few bottles of Drunken Eight Immortals wine from the medium.

Then, Xia ruofei put on an apron and started to work in the kitchen.

The sky gradually darkened. Xia ruofei finished the last carp soup. The rice in the rice cooker was just done and had jumped to the thermal mode.

At this moment, the LED screen on the kitchen wall lit up. Someone was ringing the doorbell.

Xia ruofei wiped his hands on his apron and walked over to take a look at the screen. He saw song Rui waving at the camera.

Xia ruofei smiled. He reached out his finger and pressed on the fingerprint scanner to hand over the house. Wu shuheng had already handed over the entire smart home system to Xia ruofei.

After the system confirmed the access, Xia ruofei pressed one of the buttons. The side door in the front yard for vehicles to enter and exit opened.

Xia ruofei took off his communication device and said with a smile,””You guys come directly to the backyard! Let’s get ready for dinner!”

“Alright!” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Xia ruofei brought the dishes to the dining room one by one. After a few steps, he heard footsteps. Zhao Yongjun and the other two walked into the backyard.

Xia ruofei placed the bowl of soup on the dining table and asked with a smile,””Big brother Zhao, did things go smoothly?”

“I’m done!” Zhao Yongjun smiled and said,”I also bought some personal items for Wu Qiang!”

Xia ruofei saw that Wu Qiang was carrying bags of various sizes and said to song Rui,””Song Rui, there are still a few dishes in the kitchen. Help me bring them over!”

“Wu Qiang, you will be staying in this courtyard from now on. Now, go pick a room and put your things down!” He said to Wu Qiang.
