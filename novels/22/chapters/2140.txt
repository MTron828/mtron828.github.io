2141 A pool (2)

Ollis’s strength was not much different from pyol ‘S. He used to be a sailor on a cruise ship. When pyol was in power, he was mainly roped in. Basically, he was pyol’s assistant in this survivor camp.

It had not been easy for Ollis to “become a proper leader”, but Puyol had returned. Of course, he was not satisfied. In addition, he had also used benefits to rope in a few people. Moreover, his own strength was not much weaker than Puyol ‘s. Hence, a conflict occurred as soon as Puyol returned.

It was during this conflict that Puyol kicked Ollis in the abdomen and sent him flying a few meters. His entire abdomen caved in, and he died on the spot.

Only then did Puyol realize that his power had suddenly increased by many times.

Puyol didn’t want to kill Ollis at first, but this unintentional kick ended Ollis’s life. In the eyes of the other survivors, this was undoubtedly very brutal, and it also displayed Puyol’s absolute strength.

Since then, Puyol had completely taken control of the small society formed by the survivors and became the absolute king of the camp.

Of course, Puyol still had a lingering fear of that pool, especially that terrifying Python. It made Puyol flinch. He also strictly ordered the other survivors not to get close to that area. That small pool had also become an absolute forbidden zone on the island.

Xia ruofei’s eyes lit up when he heard this.

Puyol did not know what had happened, but Xia ruofei could roughly make out the situation from his description.

He was almost certain that the pond that Puyol had mentioned was protected by an array. The fruit that Puyol had eaten was definitely not simple. It could actually produce true energy in an ordinary person’s body. This was definitely a very precious spirit fruit in the cultivation world.

Xia ruofei guessed that the reason why Puyol was able to take one or two steps forward and pick the fruit was that the boundary had been in existence for too long, causing some minor problems in the operation of certain parts.

At the thought of this, Xia ruofei was filled with curiosity and anticipation about the pool that Puyol had mentioned.

However, he did not rush to the pool to check it out. Instead, he continued to ask,””Puyol, other than this, did anything strange happen to you after living on the island for so many years?”

Puyol thought for a moment and said,”we’ve been mainly active on this side of the island these past few years. There are many places on the island that we haven’t set foot on. We’ve been like this every day. We’re just struggling to survive ... If there’s anything strange ...”

Puyol frowned and thought hard, then said,””There’s one thing ... I don’t know if it counts ...”

Xia ruofei took out a bowl of noodles from his backpack and handed it to Puyol. He said with a pleasant expression,””It doesn’t matter, tell me first! What you said just now was very helpful to me. This is your reward!”

Puyol took the ordinary instant noodles in a barrel as if he had obtained a treasure. He repeatedly expressed his thanks and then said,””Great immortal, it’s like this ... On a few days every month, there will be a very strange sound coming from the forest. It’s a little like the cry of a beast, but not very much like it ... At first, we were quite afraid, but we slowly got used to it ...”

Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows and said,”Oh?” What was the exact date? Are there any patterns?”

Puyol smiled bitterly and said,”great divine immortal, we didn’t record the time and date on this deserted island. I don’t know the exact date. However ... I’m sure that when the beast roar appeared, the moon in the sky was very round.”

Xia ruofei nodded thoughtfully. This meant that it was the night of the full moon. Were there any exotic beasts out on the night of the full moon?

Things were getting more and more interesting ...

Xia ruofei thought for a moment and said,””Pjoll, I’ll have to trouble you to bring me to that pool to take a look!”

Puyol’s face turned pale when he heard that. He said,””Lord Divine immortal, that Python is really very terrifying. My legs go soft when I think about what I experienced that day ... It’s better not to provoke it for no reason, right?”

It was obvious that Puyol had been scared out of his wits by the Python.

Xia ruofei smiled.”Don’t worry. Just lead the way for me. As long as you can see the pool, you can come back. I won’t let you take the risk.”

Although Xia ruofei’s tone was gentle, it did not leave room for discussion. No matter how unwilling Puyol was, he did not dare to go against Xia ruofei’s wishes. He could only nod with a bitter face.

“Very good, let’s set off now!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Yes!”

Puyol stood up and pulled out an old backpack from under the simple wooden bed. He put the Cola and the noodles in it and carried the backpack on his back before leaving the wooden house with Xia ruofei.

The other survivors, including the three women of Puyol, stood in the open space in the middle of the camp, waiting uneasily.

The moment Puyol came out, he said to everyone,””You guys go do what you should be doing! I’ll take this Lord to a place!”

With a faint smile on his face, Xia ruofei walked out of the shabby camp with Puyol. The survivors looked at Xia ruofei in awe. It was not until the two of them disappeared into the woods in front of the camp that they started to work again with a nervous mood.

On this isolated island surrounded by the sea, it was impossible for these people to even escape. There were no laws or morals here to restrict them. Whoever had the bigger fist was the boss.

Without a doubt, Xia ruofei’s fist was the biggest. These survivors were used to the rule of Puyol. Although their days were tough, at least they didn’t have to worry about their lives for now.

Now that it was Xia ruofei’s turn, they did not know what their fate would be like. Hence, they were all very uneasy.

Xia ruofei naturally did not care about the thoughts of the survivors. His mind had long flown to the mysterious pool.

Puyol led Xia ruofei through the dense forest. As they had not dared to come near this area for many years, Puyol could only remember the general direction. Hence, their speed was not particularly fast. He would stop from time to time to observe the surrounding environment. He would continue after a careful identification.

Xia ruofei didn’t rush him and just followed unhurriedly behind him.

Of course, with so many mysterious things happening on this Island, Xia ruofei did not dare to let his guard down. He was on high alert the entire time and his mind power was spread out at any time. Once there was any movement in the forest, he would be able to detect it immediately.

To Xia ruofei’s great anticipation, the white fox in the space was also very excited. Through its rich body language, it told him that as he continued to move forward, the aura of the world stone became stronger and stronger. Obviously, if Puyol did not lead him the wrong way, that pool could very well be where the world stone was.

Xia ruofei followed Puyol and fumbled through the dense forest for about an hour. Puyol parted a patch of grass and suddenly stopped in his tracks. His face revealed a trace of fear.

Xia ruofei saw that Puyol had stopped and immediately peeked over to take a look. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

There was a pool of water about five to six meters in diameter about twenty to thirty meters ahead of him.

The water in the pool was just as Puyol had said. It was dark blue in color, like a pure sapphire embedded in the forest.

It was very quiet around the pool. There was no sound of insects that could be heard in the forest at any time. It was as if this was a forbidden area. Even the small animals in the forest stayed away from it, which was a little strange.

Puyol said in a trembling voice,””Daoist immortal, it’s that pool in front ...”
