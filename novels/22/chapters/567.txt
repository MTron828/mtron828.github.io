Chapter 568: The mysterious Mr. Xia (2)

“What did you just say?” Boss Qian asked.

“Sir, it’s such a pity to let such a large amount of cash depreciate in your bank account, so I would like to recommend a few financial management options to you ...” The bank manager said enthusiastically.

“There’s no need for that for now. I’ll contact you if I need anything.” Boss Qian interrupted the bank manager.

His mind was still in a mess, how could he be in the mood to buy a financial management product!

Besides, boss Qian was also a businessman. How could he let his money lie in his account and eat interest? with this large sum of money, the expansion of the iron – Skin Dendrobium base and several projects that he had wanted to invest in for a long time could be launched. Where would he have the spare money to invest and manage his finances?

“Alright, I won’t disturb you any longer!” The bank manager quickly said and handed over a business card.”If you need anything, you can call me at any time. We will definitely provide you with the best service.”

“Thank you.” Boss Qian took the business card and said.

He casually put the business card into his pocket, and then looked at Liu Jinsheng who was beside him.

Liu Jinsheng looked at his 80 million Yuan that had been transferred into boss Qian’s account. Although his heart ached as if it was being cut by a knife, he still had to put on a flattering smile on his face.

“Old Qian, I didn’t lie to you, right ...” Liu Jinsheng said with a smile.

Boss Qian nodded his head coldly.

Although he did not know why Liu Jinsheng had returned the money this time, boss Qian would not be nice to Liu Jinsheng because of this.

The money was originally his, but Liu Jinsheng used his trust to cheat him out of it. His business almost went bankrupt because of it, and he only paid one million Yuan in interest after so many years. How could he forgive Liu Jinsheng just because of this?

“Let’s go!”Boss Qian said to the two workers.

With that, he strode out of the bank, and the two workers naturally followed him quickly.

Liu Jinsheng was dumbfounded as he stood rooted to the ground. After he regained his senses, he quickly chased after her and shouted,”Old Qian, wait, wait!”

Liu Jinsheng had rushed all the way to Jiangsu and Zhejiang to return the money because he was forced to do so. Now that boss Qian had finally taken the money away, he definitely needed boss Qian to give him an answer. Otherwise, if he were to return to xiangnan just like that, would he still be able to live?

During this period of time, Liu Jinsheng really felt like he was having a nightmare.

Originally, he had made a huge sum of money from boss Qian and could almost live without having to worry about food and clothing for the rest of his life. In fact, it had been the same for the past few years. He had been living an extremely carefree life.

However, more than ten days ago, the industries that he secretly controlled were constantly being troubled. At first, he didn’t pay much attention to it and tried to smooth things over through some friends in the system.

He didn’t expect that those people who used to call him brothers would all avoid him like a plague when they saw him.

Only then did Liu Jinsheng realize that things did not seem to be so simple.

What made Liu Jinsheng even more afraid was that not only were there all kinds of inspections and fines, but there were also some young men from society who often wandered around his hidden properties, making him nervous.

Such days continued for more than ten days, and finally, a very important figure in the business world of xiangnan province took the initiative to meet Liu Jinsheng.

He also learned from this Big Boss that he had almost gone bankrupt in just ten days because of old Qian Qianqian from Jiangsu and Zhejiang Province, an old fool who he had laughed at countless times.

The old man had the help of a noble, and it was a person from xiangnan province who could shake the ground with a word.

As for who it was, the Big Shot didn’t say it clearly.

However, the big boss said that even he didn’t dare to act presumptuously in front of the noble, which made Liu Jinsheng break out in a cold sweat.

What kind of Big Shot did he offend?

The big boss was obviously the spokesperson of the mysterious noble behind boss Qian. He also clearly told Liu Jinsheng that the only way to solve this problem was to return the money and give old Qian some compensation.

And the big boss also emphasized that Mr. Xia had to agree, otherwise his nightmare would continue until he really went bankrupt.

Liu Jinsheng didn’t dare to have any other thoughts, and he quickly and obediently mobilized all his strength to raise funds.

Moreover, he was extremely in awe of the ‘Mr. Xia’ that the Big Shot had mentioned.

Liu Jinsheng was very clear that when he met a Big Shot, he had to be respectful to him. A character like him did not have the ability to resist at all. Not to mention resisting, now that he was being watched, he had no chance to even escape.

He had no choice but to pay up.

Liu Jinsheng still remembered the words of the big boss, that he must get the understanding of “Mr. Xia,” so how could he let boss Qian take the money and leave?

Wouldn’t all his efforts be in vain then?

However, boss Qian ignored him and went straight to the parking lot near the entrance to open the car door.

At this time, Liu Jinsheng caught up with him, panting. Two workers immediately stepped forward and blocked boss Qian, staring at Liu Jinsheng vigilantly.

Boss Qian asked coldly,”Liu Jinsheng, you’ve already paid back the money you owe me. In the future, you can go your own way and I’ll go my own way. We’ll never see each other again!” Is there anything else you need?”

Liu Jinsheng was panting as he smiled bitterly and said,”Old Qian, look at me. I’ve traveled thousands of miles to pay you back. You can say that I’ve used up all my wealth to gather this money. Is this a sign of sincerity?”

Boss Qian pouted and did not say anything.

“Old Qian!” Liu Jinsheng said. If I had known that you had such a powerful backer, I wouldn’t have dared to ... Hai! Let’s not talk about the past, it’s all my fault. Old Qian, you’ve already paid me back and apologized. Do you think ... You can talk to Mr. Xia and ask him to let me off ...”

Boss Qian frowned.”I don’t even know what you’re talking about. What Mr. Xia? I don’t know him at all!”

Liu Jinsheng smiled bitterly and said,”old Qian, I won’t beat around the bush in front of an honest person. I’ve been messed up enough these days. I was wrong in the past, but I’ve already exchanged money for gifts and paid for it. You should calm down, right?” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Boss Qian said unhappily,”I told you I don’t know any Mr. Xia!” Liu Jinsheng, do you have problems with your ears?”

Liu Jinsheng had a look of disbelief on his face as he said,”Old Qian, I won’t hide it from you. The reason why I’m doing everything I can to pay you back this time is because there’s a noble person helping you from behind.”

“You mean ‘Mr. Xia’?” Boss Qian asked.

Liu Jinsheng nodded.”I don’t know exactly what kind of noble person it is, but the other party said that if I want to solve this problem, in addition to returning the money, I also need to get Mr. Xia’s understanding ...”

“Liu Jinsheng, it looks like you’ve been forced quite badly this time ... If you knew this would happen, why did you do it?” boss Qian asked sarcastically.

“Old Qian, I’m begging you. Think about it ... Do you have any friends with the surname Xia?” Liu Jinsheng said with a bitter smile.

Then, Liu Jinsheng’s eyes lit up and he said,”By the way, if I’m not mistaken, this Mr. Xia should be from the southeast province!”

Originally, boss Qian would never have thought that it was Xia ruofei. After all, he wasn’t familiar with Xia ruofei. Although his son, Qian Lijun, was Xia ruofei’s comrade, he had only fought with Xia ruofei once or twice.

Moreover, Xia ruofei was still so young and was only a veteran. He did not seem like someone with such power, so how could boss Qian have thought of him?

However, when Liu Jinsheng mentioned the southeast province, boss Qian’s heart moved, and Xia ruofei’s figure flashed through his mind.

Liu Jinsheng saw boss Qian’s strange expression and quickly asked,””Old Qian, did you remember?”

“I’ll go ask!”Boss Qian said coldly. I can’t be sure if it’s him ...”

“Okay, okay ... Old Qian, then I’ll leave it to you ...” Liu Jinsheng quickly said,”I’m staying at the Four Seasons Hotel in Anyue city. If you have any news, please let me know!” If Mr. Xia doesn’t say anything, I don’t dare to go back to xiangnan province ...”

Boss Qian looked at Liu Jinsheng coldly. For the sake of the eighty million Yuan, he still nodded his head gently, then opened the car door and sat in.

Liu Jinsheng stood obediently on the side of the road and watched boss Qian drive away. Then, he let out a long sigh, stopped a taxi, and went straight to the hotel he booked.

As boss Qian drove, he pondered for a moment. Then, he took out his mobile phone and dialed his son, Qian Lijun’s number ...
