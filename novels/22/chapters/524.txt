Chapter 525: Immortal farm (3)

Actually, the seeds that were soaked in the spirit Heart flower’s petal solution would definitely be able to survive and grow successfully in Australia. However, Xia ruofei could not be so sure.

“It’s a good way to import seeds. “Tang He nodded and said,” Australia imports all kinds of seeds from China every year, so the relevant procedures should not be difficult to handle. ”

“Mr. Tang, there’s something I need to tell you in advance,” said Xia ruofei. Our current research shows that the hereditary traits of paradise vegetable seeds will disappear in the second generation, which means that Paradise Farm will not be able to breed them independently and can only continue to import seeds from paradise company ...” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Tang He could not help but frown slightly. This meant that he had no autonomy at all! However, on second thought, he realized that the major shareholder of Paradise Farm was Xia ruofei himself. His share was not even as high as Xia ruofei ‘s! Therefore, the risk could be ignored.

Xia ruofei seemed to have guessed Tang He’s thoughts. He smiled and said,””Mr. Tang, Paradise Farm can sign a supply contract with paradise Corporation. Paradise Corporation will guarantee a sufficient supply of seeds and guarantee that they will supply them exclusively to Paradise Farm in Australia. They will no longer seek other partners. This way, with a formal contract, the interests of both parties can be guaranteed ...”

Tang He’s brows immediately relaxed. He nodded and said,”I agree. If we do this, Paradise Farm can give 20% of the profits to the Paradise company as the transfer fee for the technology ...”

“No, no, no, we can negotiate the price of the seeds, but we don’t need to pay the technology fee.” Xia ruofei said,”when I invested, my technology was already sold for five million US dollars. Paradise Farm can use this technology for free.”

“Brother Xia, in the long run, the profit generated by this technology is far more than 5 million US dollars!” Said Tang He with a bitter smile. I’m taking advantage of you again ...”

He didn’t know that he needed the peach blossom company to provide him with seeds. He thought that as long as he had Xia ruofei’s cultivation technique, the Australian farm could develop their own vegetable cultivation. In that case, the price of five million USD was still appropriate, and Xia ruofei could even make a profit.

However, the situation was different now. It was no exaggeration to say that if Xia ruofei wanted to, he could take these high – Quality vegetable seeds to cooperate with any vegetable farmer in the world. Even if he wanted 30%, 40%, or even 50% of the net profit, there would be a lot of people fighting to cooperate.

The Paradise vegetables were definitely a phenomenal product, a big killer that could subvert the market!

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Mr. Tang, let’s do it according to my plan.” What I value more is our long – term cooperation, not the small profits in front of us. ”

Tang He was stunned for a moment, then he laughed and patted Xia ruofei’s shoulder.””Good! Brother Xia, we’ll do as you say!”

“Qi Chao, go and handle the relevant procedures for the import of the seeds immediately.” Tang He turned to Liang Qichao and said,”you have to personally keep an eye on the introduction of seeds and the experimental planting. This is the top priority of Paradise Farm!”

“Yes!” Liang Qichao said seriously.

After they were done talking about business, the group took the open – Top off – Road vehicle around the farm. Xia ruofei once again had a direct view of the vast Paradise Farm. Even if Paradise Farm in the country expanded again, it could not be compared to Paradise Farm.

Then, Xia ruofei was invited to visit Tang He’s breeding base for purebreds. He saw more than 20 high – Quality horses, especially that fjortle. Tang He even asked the cavalrymen to ride it on a professional track for a few rounds, which was an eye – opener for Xia ruofei.

However, Xia ruofei also knew that horse racing was a game for the rich. For the time being, he did not have the time, energy, and money to participate in horse racing.

Tang He stayed with Xia ruofei on the farm for half a day. In the evening, he left the farm with his bodyguards and assistant and returned to Sydney. That night, they took a private plane back to the United States.

This time, he was here to accompany Xia ruofei. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have needed to be here personally.

Just to accompany Xia ruofei to inspect the farm, he had wasted an entire day. This showed how much Tang He valued Xia ruofei.

Before Tang He left, he repeatedly suggested that Xia ruofei stay for a few more days and have fun in Australia. At the same time, he also said that he would return to the Sydney Airport after he returned to the United States for Xia ruofei to use when he returned home.

Xia ruofei felt a little flattered. Tang He still insisted after a few rejections, so he had to let him be.

After watching Tang He’s car drive away under the setting sun and finally disappear from sight, Liang Qichao said with a smile,””Ruofei, I’ll take care of the arrangements for the next few days. I’ll bring you to experience the Australian culture! Especially the style of the Australian girls, hahaha ...”
