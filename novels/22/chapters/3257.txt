10 kilometers.

100 kilometers ...

Unlike rockets, the black Phoenix flying ship did not require a powerful thrust to overcome the effects of gravity. Hence, it maintained a very high elevation speed. Without realizing it, the black Phoenix flying ship had already risen to an altitude of about 400 kilometers above the ground.

At this height, the atmosphere was already very thin, close to the state of vacuum.

Moreover, everyone was already in a state of weightlessness.

For Xia ruofei and the others who were wearing the spacesuits, they felt more at ease in the zero – Gravity state. Although the cumbersome spacesuits still looked bloated, they seemed weightless.

Sound couldn’t be transmitted in a vacuum.

However, Xia ruofei and the others did not need to use their spiritual power to communicate as the spacesuits all had an intercom system. They had set the frequency to the same channel in advance, so they could communicate directly through the same frequency.

Xia ruofei said,”we’re just testing the flight. I think we should just maintain this altitude. It’s almost the same altitude as the Tiangong experiment module in our country.” Brother Chen, what do you think?”

Chen Xuan made an ‘OK’ gesture and said,””Sure!”

This time, Xia ruofei was the main person in charge of the flight verification. Naturally, no one had any objections.

“Then I’ll release the spaceship!” Xia ruofei said.

With that, he used his spiritual power to control the control panel of the black Phoenix flying ship, expanding the protective barrier of the ship by about twenty meters. This was almost the limit of the protective barrier. Maintaining such a large area for such a long time would consume crystals at a much faster rate. However, Xia ruofei still had to do this. If he released the spaceship rashly, many big countries would probably notice the sudden appearance of an unknown spaceship in the 400 – kilometer orbit. Hence, he had to keep the spaceship within the range of the shield. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

After adjusting the barrier of the black Phoenix flying ship, Xia ruofei took out the Dragon God ship from the spirit map space.

The Dragon Ship appeared beside the black Phoenix flying ship in an instant. At this time, the black Phoenix flying ship was already maintaining an altitude of four hundred kilometers, flying around the Earth. The Dragon Ship and the black Phoenix flying ship were in a relatively stationary state.

Xia ruofei used two straps to connect the Dragon Ship and the black Phoenix flying ship together. The straps were the safety ropes used by astronauts when they went out of their spacesuits. There were several of them in every EVA suit’s accessory box. Now that the two spacesuits were still and there was no pulling force, it was enough to use the straps to make a simple connection.

Furthermore, even if the black Phoenix flying ship and the Dragon Ship were to drift far away in space, Xia ruofei could still control the black Phoenix flying ship to chase after them. He would definitely not get Lost in Space.

“Fellow Daoists, I’ll be going first!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

With that, Xia ruofei lightly stepped on the deck of the black Phoenix flying ship and flew towards the Dragon Ship.

Xia ruofei did not take any safety measures. Instead, he grabbed onto a fixed rod on the exterior of the spaceship and waved at Chen Xuan, Ling Qingxue, and the rest who were on the deck of the black Phoenix flying ship behind him.

It was basically impossible for an ordinary person to enter a sealed spaceship in space.

In fact, in space flight, if the cabin door was opened directly from the outside, the strong internal and external pressure difference would probably blow the cabin door out directly. When astronauts went out of the cabin, they would first come to the sealed cabin and depressurize it so that the cabin would become a vacuum without any pressure difference from the outside. Only then could the hatch be opened.

Of course, this was not a problem for cultivators.

Xia ruofei grabbed the pole outside the Dragon Ship with one hand, then extended his spiritual power into the return cabin. The return cabin was also the cockpit of the spaceship, and all the control was completed here.

Although the power system of the spaceship had been dismantled, some of the basic control units were still kept. Otherwise, the spaceship would be a big can and would not be able to meet the needs of space life.

Xia ruofei followed the operation manual and used his spiritual power to remotely control the outside of the spaceship. He turned on the main power supply of the spaceship and unfolded the solar sails to ensure that the spaceship had sufficient power.

Then, he pressed the button to depressurize the cabin he was about to enter.

After that, Xia ruofei used his spiritual power to pull the handle of the hatch and opened the airtight hatch.

Then, Xia ruofei easily pushed the door and entered the spaceship.

Xia ruofei did a simple check and said,””Everyone, come over!”

Chen Xuan and the others also leaped off the black Phoenix flying ship and made their way to the top of the Dragon Ship with ease. They then filed into the ship.

Five people in spacesuits entered the cabin, making it a bit crowded.

Xia ruofei quickly closed the hatch and extended his spiritual power to the cockpit to check the seal of the cabin. After making sure that the hatch was closed and there was no problem, he began to apply pressure to the cabin.

Soon, the air pressure in this cabin was the same as that of the other cabins.

Xia ruofei opened the door to the other cabins and said,””Alright, everyone can take off your spacesuits now. However, the Qi condensation cultivators, please wait for a moment. Brother Chen, elder yang, and I will go first!”
