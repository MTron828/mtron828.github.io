3062 I don’t dare to reject the elder’s gift (1)

The next morning.

On the large bed in the bedroom upstairs, a fair and delicate arm stretched out from the messy quilt.

Song Wei rubbed her sleepy eyes and reached for her phone from the bedside table. It was already past nine in the morning.

Her sleepiness was greatly reduced.

At this time, she also remembered the madness last night and couldn’t help but feel a little hot.

Then, Song Wei turned her head and realized that there was no one beside her.

She quickly sat up, picked up her pajamas from the ground, and put them on.

At this moment, Song Wei had already heard the commotion from the kitchen downstairs. A sweet smile appeared on her pretty face.

Song Wei dragged her slippers and walked down the stairs. Halfway down, she leaned on the railing and looked down. As expected, she saw Xia ruofei in an apron, busy in the kitchen.

“You’re awake!” Xia ruofei heard the noise and looked up. His eyes met with Song Wei ‘S. He laughed and said,”I remember you said yesterday that you had taken leave today. I didn’t wake you up in the morning so that you could sleep more!”

Song Wei realized that her appearance must be unkempt. She could not help but scream and quickly retracted her body. Then, she quickly went down the stairs and rushed into the bathroom with her head lowered.

Xia ruofei looked at the tightly shut bathroom door and muttered to himself,””What’s the situation?” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

After a while, Song Wei walked out of the bathroom after she was dressed up.

At this time, Xia ruofei had already prepared breakfast. He brought it to the small dining room that was connected to the living room. Although it was called a dining room, because the room was too small, it was actually just a dining table at the edge of the living room.

Xia ruofei saw Song Wei and smiled.””You’re done washing? Come and eat! It’s not very sumptuous! After all, my cooking skills are average, so I’ll just make do with it!”

Song Wei looked at the table and saw that Xia ruofei had baked a few pieces of bread, two glasses of warm milk, two fried eggs, and a very thick porridge. There should be some pumpkin and millet in it. The fragrant smell was very appetizing.

“This is already sumptuous enough!” Song Wei said with a smile. What fusion of Chinese and Western?! But ... I remember that I’ve already finished all the eggs in the refrigerator. I didn’t prepare any pumpkins either! Did you go out to buy groceries?”

Xia ruofei laughed,”have you forgotten that I have a storage treasure too?” I’m used to carrying some ingredients with me in case I need them. Look, I’ve used them today, haven’t I?”

“Yes, yes, yes!” Song Wei patted her head and said. You really reminded me! I’m on leave today anyway, so I might as well stay at home and tidy up my things. In addition, I’ll go out and buy some things. It’ll be a waste if I don’t make use of such a large storage space!”

Xia ruofei found it funny that Song Wei, who had always been calm and steady, became so excited at the mention of the storage ring.

He laughed and said,”eating is more important than anything else!” Let’s eat breakfast first! Also, I have to go back to Paradise Island, so I’m afraid I won’t be able to accompany you shopping today!”

Song Wei sat down at the table and smiled,”I don’t need your company! You can go back to your business!”

Then, Song Wei tasted the fragrant pumpkin millet congee. She couldn’t help but give him a thumbs up and said,”So delicious! RUO Fei, I’ve noticed that your cooking skills have improved greatly, just like your cultivation! With your cooking skills, you can even get a job at Qingxue’s restaurant!”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”You’re a graduate student after all. You’re so good at complimenting others. Although I know you’re not being sincere, I’m still happy to hear it!”

“How could I not be sincere? It’s really delicious!” Song Wei picked up another fried egg and took a bite.”The heat is just right, and it’s sweet! It smells so good!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”if it’s delicious, then eat more. I made extra porridge today. It’ll be a waste if you can’t finish it!”

“Yes, yes!” Song Wei nodded as she ate.”Don’t just look at me. Eat it yourself!”

“Good, good, good!” Xia ruofei said.

It was obvious that Song Wei really thought that Xia ruofei’s breakfast was delicious. Soon, the food on the table was swept clean by the two of them. She even scooped an extra bowl of porridge.

After the meal, Xia ruofei helped Song Wei to clear the dishes. Then, he took off his apron and said,”Weiwei, I have to go. You have to take care of yourself in Beijing! I’m sure you can deal with most situations easily, but if ... I mean, if there’s a threat from a cultivator, you must tell me at once and make sure you’re safe!”

“I know!” Song Wei smiled and said,”actually, I also want to cultivate with you on Peach Blossom Island. However, I also like the profession I’m currently studying. I want to work in archeology for a few more years. After a few years, when my father retires, we can live on Peach Blossom Island together!”

“Yes, yes!” Xia ruofei nodded and said,”no matter what your choice is, I will respect it. I will also do my best to create the best cultivation conditions for you!”

Song Wei hugged Xia ruofei and pressed her face against his chest. She mumbled,”I know ... In the future, no matter what others think, in my own opinion, meeting you is the luckiest thing in my life! RUO Fei, when you’re dealing with people in the world of cultivation, you must pay attention to your safety. Don’t make me worry about you! Also, don’t take any risks. You must always remember that there are many people who are worried about you, including Qingxue and me ...”
