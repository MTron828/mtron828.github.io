……

The person who was talking to Xia ruofei was yang Wanxin, the Vice President of the airport Group, whom he had met once during the flight test of the business jet.

It could be said that yang Wanxin had a deep impression of Xia ruofei. Not only was Xia ruofei in the limelight recently, but his rise to fame was also because of the major events in the aviation industry. More importantly, Xia ruofei had such a close relationship with the Super – rich Li Yifu. Even the public jet that was still under the Kyushu group’s name was now parked at San Shan airport. The Kyushu group had directly rented an exclusive hangar. Yang Wanxin heard that this public jet was specially used to serve Xia ruofei.

A plane that was worth hundreds of millions was just given to Xia ruofei for free. There were also a lot of additional costs, including the crew’s salary, airport rent, management fees, aircraft maintenance fees, and so on. One could imagine how important Xia ruofei was to Li Yifu.

Therefore, when yang Wanxin saw Xia ruofei from afar, he immediately took the initiative to come over and greet him.

When he found out that Xia ruofei was sending a friend to the plane, yang Wanxin immediately asked Wu Liqian about her flight and class.

As a member of the Standing Committee of the county party Committee, Wu Liqian could travel by plane, but she could only claim the expenses of the economy class, so she naturally booked the economy Class.

“President Xia, County Head Wu, please wait for the security check. Please follow me to the check – in counter,” yang Wanxin immediately said.

Xia ruofei thought that yang Wanxin was going to arrange for a VIP staff member to take Wu Liqian through the security check at the VIP passage. Actually, there was still plenty of time. Since the security checkpoints were open, there weren’t many people in line. Xia ruofei didn’t think it was necessary, but he couldn’t resist yang Wanxin’s enthusiasm. At last, he exchanged a look with Wu Liqian and followed him.

Xia ruofei’s mind power had been locked on Liu haojun. When he left, Xia ruofei did not even turn his head but he knew it clearly. Even Zeng Liang and Zhang Aijun, who were following Liu haojun, could not escape his detection.

He believed in the abilities of Xu Yougang and the other three. Unless Liu haojun was as clean as a piece of white paper, he would definitely give himself away.

As long as they had enough ingredients, there would be many possible choices for the next step. The initiative was completely in Xia ruofei’s hands.

Xia ruofei looked through the glass in the lobby and saw the van parked in the opposite parking lot. Then, he quickly looked away.

At this time, the three of them had arrived at the check – in counter. The staff saw yang Wanxin and quickly stood up to greet him.

Although the check – in staff at this counter was a staff member of Heron Island Airlines and strictly speaking, he wasn’t under the jurisdiction of the airport. However, the airline rented this counter and yang Wanxin was a senior executive of the airport Group. As an ordinary check – in staff, he naturally didn’t dare to neglect him.

Yang Wanxin told him Wu Liqian’s flight number and asked,””Check if there are any empty seats in the business class and first – Class cabin!” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

It was obviously not the first time the staff member had to deal with such a situation. He immediately entered the flight number on the computer and checked it. Then he looked up and said,”Mr. Yang, there are still empty seats in the first class and business class.”

“I’ll get this lady to first class!”Yang Wanxin nodded.

Then, he said to Wu Liqian with a smile,””County Head Wu, could you please provide your boarding pass?”

Wu Liqian was stunned for a moment and quickly said,””President yang, there’s no need to upgrade! It’s only a two – hour flight, so Economy Class will do!”

“Mr. Yang,” Xia ruofei said tactfully,”sister Qian is traveling for official business. It’s over the limit to take the first class!”

Before yang Wanxin could speak, the staff member explained with a smile,””Sir, Madam, we’re upgrading your cabin for free. There’s no cost and we won’t change your itinerary, so there’s no impact on your subsequent reimbursement.”

“Free of charge?” Xia ruofei was stunned.

He knew that since yang Wanxin had helped with the upgrade, Wu Liqian definitely wouldn’t have to pay for the cost. However, if the itinerary was changed to first – Class, Wu Liqian wouldn’t be able to claim the ticket, which meant that she would have to pay for the cost of the economy Class. The flight was only two hours long, so it wasn’t worth it.

If it was Xia ruofei himself, he would not care about such a small amount of money. In fact, when he went on a trip, he had basically booked a first – Class ticket. However, this involved Wu Liqian’s future reimbursement, so he had some concerns.

Yang Wanxin smiled and explained,”director Xia, County Head Wu, unless it’s peak travel season, the airline’s tickets are rarely sold out, especially the relatively expensive first – Class seats. There are often empty seats. These resources are idle, so the airline will use these resources to provide free upgrade services for high – Quality passengers. This is completely in line with the regulations.”

In fact, those who could enjoy a free upgrade were generally regular travelers or Platinum customers of some banks. Of course, there were also ordinary passengers who were sometimes hit by a pie that fell from the sky, but this situation was very rare.

After Yang Wanxin’s explanation, Xia ruofei thought for a while and didn’t try to be pretentious. He smiled and said,””In that case, thank you, President yang!”
