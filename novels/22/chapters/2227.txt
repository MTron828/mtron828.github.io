“Aren’t you going to ask about the price?”song Rui asked with a smile. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Xia ruofei replied nonchalantly,”it’s just a business car. How expensive can it be?” Go ahead! How much is it?”

“The official price is about 800000 Yuan!” Song Rui said. The price of the car. ”

800,000 was nothing to Xia ruofei. He said without thinking,””I can accept this price! And didn’t you say it already? Is the overall price – Performance ratio of this car not bad?”

“So, it’s decided?” song Rui asked with a smile.

“I’ve decided!” Xia ruofei said,”I believe in your judgment.”

“It’s rare for me to be praised!” Song Rui smiled and asked,”how are you going to buy it?”

Xia ruofei was slightly stunned and said,”how else can I buy a car?” Go to a 4S shop! Don’t tell me there’s no Toyota 4S shop in the capital?”

“Of course, there’s a Toyota 4S shop!” Song Rui smiled and said,”but if you go directly to a 4S store to buy it, I’m afraid you won’t be able to buy it!”

“Don’t keep me in suspense, what’s going on?” Xia ruofei asked.

“I’ll put it this way! This car is very popular in China, and many local tycoons are scrambling for it. Moreover, the Japanese are deliberately doing hunger marketing. ” Song Rui said,”do you know how much quota the Toyota headquarters gives to the entire Greater China region every month?”

“How much?” Xia ruofei asked.

” 800 units!” Song Rui said,”be careful! This is the quota for the entire Greater China region, including Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan!”

“So little?” Xia ruofei was slightly surprised.

“Things are precious when they are rare! Don’t many local bosses like this?” Song Rui smiled and said,”I can’t deny that the comfort of this car is absolutely first – Class. It’s also very good – looking and has a sense of future. However, the Japanese’s hunger marketing is indeed quite disgusting!”

Song Rui paused and said,”the effect of this hunger marketing is that if you go directly to a 4S store to buy a car, there will definitely be no new car!” This model of car was now being sold at a higher price, and it was a large price increase! And even if we increase the price, we’ll have to wait for at least a month!”

“A large increase in the price?” Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”what’s the extent?”

“Let’s put it this way! This car is purely imported, and the price of the top version in Wei nation is about 400000 Chinese dollars. Because of tariffs, the price in our country is about 800000 dollars. ” Song Rui said,”but in fact? The top – end version would have to be at least 400000 or even 600000 more! Including the purchase tax, insurance, and other expenses, it’ll cost at least 1.6 million!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but click his tongue when he heard this. After a long while, he said,””A 400000 Yuan car is going to be sold for 1.6 million Yuan in our country? Four times more?”

“What do you think?” Song Rui smiled and said,”this is it. You might not be able to buy it! You’ll still have to wait in line for the bus ...”

“That’s crazy ...” Xia ruofei was speechless.”Who would be such a spendthrift?”

“You don’t say. There are quite a lot of rich people nowadays who are silly.” Song Rui smiled and said,”you know that they are doing hunger marketing, but you still want to buy it even if you have to pay more! It’s just because this car will make you look good!”

Xia ruofei frowned and said,””If that’s the case ... Then I’ll change the brand! I think Buick has a pretty good business car ...”

It wasn’t that he couldn’t afford 1.6 million Yuan. To him, this amount of money was really just a drop in the ocean. It was just that he felt that this money was not worth it at all! Moreover, if he drove this car out in the future, it would be easy for people to misunderstand him as a rich man. It was not good to think about it.

“Don’t mind me!” Song Rui said,”didn’t I just say it? Objectively speaking, it was a very good car model! Besides, not all the nouveau riche would buy this car! Many big entrepreneurs like this car!”

“I just don’t think it’s necessary ...” Xia ruofei said.

“Spending 1.6 million to buy a car that’s only sold for 400000 in Wei nation, of course it’s not necessary, only an idiot would buy it!” Song Rui said with a smile,”but since I recommended this car to you, I won’t let you be a fool!”

Xia ruofei suddenly realized and smiled.””I understand. Does our young master Song have a way to get a cheap car?”

“Not only is it cheap, but you don’t have to wait too long!” Song Rui laughed.

“Oh?” Xia ruofei was also tempted.

“I told you just now!” Song Rui said. The Li family’s Xiao si ‘er specialized in reversing cars! He had a way to get the original car from the Wei nation! And ...”

Song Rui lowered his voice and said,””You can even save on tariffs ...”

Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows.”Xiao Rui, it’s just a car. There’s no need to do all this. What if something happens ...”

“Don’t you worry!” Song Rui smiled and said,”although they are not imported through legal channels, Xiao si ‘er’s cars are all fully processed and absolutely legal! I won’t go into the details with you, but all in all, every cat has its own way. This is what he does for a living, and most of his customers are people in the circle. If there was a problem with the car, would he dare to sell it?”

The Li family’s old master had passed away early, so the family had been on the decline in recent years. Their influence had also declined year by year. The Li family could not be compared with the song family, which was a rich and powerful family. In the entire capital, they could only be considered a second – rate family. Li Xiao Si was selling imported cars to people in the industry, so he definitely didn’t dare to make any mistakes in the procedures, otherwise, it would be easy to offend people.

Hearing this, Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,””How much would it cost to buy it from him?”

Song Rui said proudly,”it’s definitely not that cheap for others, but if I ask, I should be able to get it for 500000!” This car costs 400000 Yuan in the Wei nation, and there’s also the transportation cost, including opening up some joints, so 500000 Yuan is basically a guaranteed cost price!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said,”help me understand the situation first. If there’s one, I’ll order one!”

“Alright!” Song Rui smiled and said,”even if he doesn’t have an existing car, he can transfer the goods at the last minute. If I were to step in, he would definitely do his best to send the car to you in the shortest time possible!”

“Then I’ll leave this matter to you.” Xia ruofei said, then smiled and asked,”we’re done with the business. Now, it’s time to care about your personal issues! How have you been with Zhuo Yiyi recently? Did you make any progress?”

The last time Zhuo Yiyi came to siheyuan, Xia ruofei had even helped song Rui find out more about her. He felt that Zhuo Yiyi did not hate song Rui and had some feelings for him. However, song Rui’s family background had given her a lot of pressure and made her more apprehensive. Hence, Xia ruofei had also counseled Zhuo Yiyi.

However, he didn’t know if Zhuo Yiyi had actually taken his words to heart.

Song Rui chuckled and said,”look at what you’re saying!” How can I fail when I’m taking action? I have a name! He’s known as the Jade – faced Playboy in the pugilistic world. Wouldn’t it be a piece of cake for him to deal with a mere Zhuo Yiyi?”

“Woof! You’ve become so arrogant!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”it sounds like you’ve won it!”

“It’s a must!” Song Rui said triumphantly,”the lack of progress before was my strategy. If I were to launch an all – out attack, how could she resist my romantic attack?”
