Chapter 586: Contract achieved (1)

Xia ruofei looked at Feng Jing with a smile and said to CEO Lin,””Big brother Lin, if President Feng isn’t good, how could he be our company’s general manager at such a young age?”

Xia ruofei knew that Feng Jing must have been overbearing in the negotiation earlier, so he decided to change the subject.

In fact, this was also the reason why Xia ruofei let Feng Jing be in charge of the negotiation.

After all, he had a good relationship with President Lin. It was a little embarrassing for him to refuse to give up an inch of land on the negotiation table for the sake of profit. However, he let Feng Jing take charge of it and follow the rules. That was why he hid himself so thoroughly.

President Lin shook his head with a bitter smile. He pointed at Xia ruofei and said,””Brother Xia, you’re really cunning ...”

Xia ruofei pretended to be confused and said,”big brother Lin, did CEO Feng make things difficult for you?” Tell me, I’ll criticize her later!”

President Lin’s stomach full of words was suddenly swallowed back. He couldn’t possibly say that the General Manager was a Negotiation Expert and that he was losing at the negotiation table today, right?

Feng Rao also smiled and said,””President Lin, although there are still some small differences between us, the negotiation is still going smoothly!”

President Lin smiled bitterly and thought,”it’s going well for you guys, but I’m already retreating step by step. I’m just short of losing my power and humiliating my country.”

However, President Lin was also very clear that paradise corporation’s products were their biggest reliance. Tongren Hall was already the weaker party in this cooperation, so as long as Feng Jing’s ability wasn’t too bad, she would take the opportunity to make demands. This was also human nature.

Xia ruofei laughed and tried to smooth things over,””Big brother Lin, today’s work has come to an end. We’ll talk about the unfinished business tomorrow. It’s mealtime now. A man is made of iron and rice is made of steel. Let’s not talk about work and go to the restaurant to eat! You have to drink more today!”

President Lin was also in a good mood. He immediately smiled and said,””Alright! I’ll drink to my heart’s content if I lose on the negotiation table! I’ll make you broke with one meal!”

“I can’t ask for more!” Xia ruofei raised his head and laughed.

......

When they arrived at the restaurant, pang Hao had already arranged for the employees to tidy up a round table. Many dishes were already semi – finished in the kitchen and were just waiting for Xia ruofei and the others to take their seats. Therefore, once everyone was seated, the dishes were served very quickly.

A large pot of tofu stewed with grass carp, with some purple perilla added on top, was steaming hot and fragrant, which immediately increased one’s appetite.

Next, there was fish head tofu soup and braised grass carp. Xia ruofei took three large grass carps and ordered them to be used as the main dish. Therefore, Cao tieshu’s wife also cooked in a different way. Although they were all home – cooked, the ingredients were really good. In addition, Cao tieshu’s wife’s cooking skills were also very good, so the taste, color, and fragrance were all present.

The other dishes were also home – cooked dishes. In addition to meat dishes such as dried pot yellow beef and red – braised mutton, there were several vegetarian dishes, all of which were cooked with paradise vegetables as ingredients.

“Big brother Lin, have a taste of Mrs. Cao’s cooking!” Xia ruofei greeted him with a smile.

President Lin had been talking for an entire afternoon and was already physically and mentally exhausted. Now that he saw this table full of delicious food, his stomach couldn’t help but growl. Hearing this, he didn’t stand on ceremony and picked up his chopsticks with a smile.

At this moment, the two young ladies from the finance department, who had been called over by pang Hao to act as temporary waitresses, opened the bottle of Drunken Eight Immortals ‘wine. Immediately, a rich and intoxicating aroma of wine filled the entire restaurant. Even President Lin’s hand, which was reaching for the pot of stewed fish, stopped in its tracks.

President Lin took a few deep breaths and said with a shocked expression,””Brother Xia, what kind of wine is this? This is too fragrant!”

“Big brother Lin, this is some good wine that I’ve specially prepared for you. Try it first ...” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Xia ruofei then gestured for the two girls to pour him some wine.

After the Drunken Eight Immortals wine was poured out of the bottle, its fragrance became even more intense. Even Feng Rao, who rarely drank, couldn’t help but purse her lips.

Soon, everyone’s glasses were filled with wine. Xia ruofei laughed and raised his glass,””Brother Lin, thank you for your warm hospitality in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Province. Since you’re here in Sanshan today, I have to do my best as the host. For the first glass of wine today, let’s toast to the guests from Tongren Hall with our colleagues from Taoyuan company!”

“Thank you, brother Xia!”

“Cheers!”

“Cheers!”

After finishing the glass of wine, Xia ruofei did not rush to propose a toast. Instead, he invited everyone to eat.

It was the first time President Lin and his assistant had eaten Taoyuan vegetables, and they couldn’t help but praise it.

Feng Rao, Xiao Qiang, pang Hao, and the others had never eaten the spatial carp before. This was their first time tasting it, and they were immediately conquered by its delicious taste. They couldn’t help but take a few more bites.

For a moment, everyone only cared about eating, and no one actually toasted.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but find it funny. He suggested,””Boss Feng, brother Lin came all the way here. Shouldn’t you give a toast on behalf of the company?”

Only then did Feng Rao come back to her senses. She couldn’t help blushing slightly as she quickly raised her glass and said,”President Lin, welcome to the three mountains! I’ll toast you this glass of wine alone and wish us a successful cooperation! In order to show my sincerity, I’ll finish this glass of wine, and you can do as you please!” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Although Feng Jing didn’t like to drink much, she was still a capable woman who had been working hard for many years.

After she finished speaking, she raised her head and finished the glass of wine before Mr. Lin could say anything. Then, she showed Mr. Lin the bottom of the glass.
