Chapter 1888: If you want to do something, do it big_2

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei shouted from behind her,”hey, you haven’t answered me.” Do you want me to pick you up after work?”

Ling Qingxue really wanted to reject this bad guy, but she couldn’t resist the temptation of cultivation. In the end, she turned around and said,””I’m going to work overtime, come back later ...”

“Sure!” Xia ruofei beamed.

After teasing Ling Qingxue a little, Xia ruofei felt that being cheeky for a while was quite fun. He hummed a song and drove back to Taoyuan building.

Xia ruofei recalled the thought he had at the Western restaurant around the corner. He called Feng Jing and Dong Yun to his office as soon as he returned.

When the two of them arrived, Xia ruofei went straight to the point and said,””Director Feng, director Dong, the truffle season is ending soon. What do you think if we hold another auction in Hong Kong?”

Feng Jing immediately asked,”the chairman can get that kind of truffle?” If we can hold another auction, it will definitely be very beneficial to our company! It just so happens that the company has been very popular on the internet recently, so we’re striking while the iron is hot!”

Although Dong Yun hadn’t been employed during the last auction, she had heard about the Hong Kong auction held by the peach blossom company. She said,””Chairman, if possible, the more auctions like this, the better. It’s good for building our company’s high – end brand image. The benefits are self – evident!”

Like Feng Jing, Dong Yun didn’t mention anything about the profits.

She had read the company’s information after joining the company. She knew that the proceeds from the Hong Kong auction were not transferred to the company’s account but to an overseas company that Xia ruofei had full control of.

However, Feng Rao and Dong Yun did not think that there was anything wrong with this. After all, the top – grade abalones and truffles were not produced by the Paradise Corporation. Xia ruofei had obtained them from other channels and was only selling them under the name of the Paradise Corporation.

Although most of the shares of paradise Corporation belonged to Xia ruofei, he still gave some to Feng Jing. The other senior executives also received a small amount of reward shares. Therefore, it was reasonable that these profits would not go into the company’s account. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

To put it simply, in their opinion, the fame was given to the Paradise company. They couldn’t transfer the money they earned to the Paradise company. If that happened, Xia ruofei would have to pay Feng Jing and the other senior executives dividends. It didn’t make sense!

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I want to make this auction bigger. Not only truffles, but also top – grade abalones. I can also get a few hundred – year – old mountain ginsengs, as well as our best iron maple and Cordyceps sinensis. I’m thinking that since we’re going to do it, we might as well make it bigger and make our name known!” In the future, whenever people mention high – end food ingredients and Chinese medicinal herbs, they will think of our paradise Corporation!”

“Chairman, can you guarantee the highest quality of the ingredients and herbs you just mentioned?” Feng Rao couldn’t help but say excitedly,”if that’s the case, that’s great!”

Other than the tin can, which was produced by paradise Corporation, the other items, including the Cordyceps, were actually provided by Xia ruofei himself. Feng Jing only knew that Xia ruofei had a strong network of channels and could get a lot of good stuff. In fact, even the iron – Skin fengdou was only processed at the peach blossom company. The iron – Skin Dendrobium, which was the raw material, was also provided by Xia ruofei.

“No problem!” Xia ruofei said,”just leave the auction items to me! What I’m worried about now is that the company has just moved its headquarters. Will you have enough energy to take care of it?”

“No problem!” Feng Jing said,”our company’s team is getting more and more mature. With the support of Hengfeng group in Hong Kong, it’s definitely not a problem to prepare for an auction like this!”

“Chairman!” Dong Yun also said. We promise to complete the mission!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”that’s good!” This matter was temporarily settled like this! President Feng has dealt with Hengfeng many times. This time, you’re still in charge of communicating with them. Let them know our intentions first. What items are being auctioned, including the specific number, I’ll let you know as soon as I’ve confirmed it!”

“Alright!” Feng Rao said.

Then, Xia ruofei turned to Dong Yun and said,””As for the coordination between the front and back, including the specific work of the early preparation, I’ll leave it to director Dong!”

“No problem!” Dong Yun said,”I will do my best to assist chief Feng in making the preparations for the auction very detailed!”

“OK!”Xia ruofei said,”if there’s time, I hope that the auction can be held in Hong Kong in a week or two, no more than half a month! The overall plan, including how to hype up the early stage, how to promote, and what guests to invite, will be up to you to communicate with Hengfeng. I won’t be involved in this matter!”

Feng Rao was already used to Xia ruofei’s way of doing things. She smiled and said,””Leave it to us!”

……

In the evening, Xia ruofei first drove to Walmart to buy some groceries, then went to the Ling Ji restaurant headquarters to pick up Ling Qingxue. The two of them returned to Paradise Farm together.

After dinner, the two of them immediately went upstairs to cultivate again. They ended their cultivation at eight or nineo’ clock in the evening. In fact, they had been cultivating together for almost three or four days.

Just as Xia ruofei had expected, Ling Qingxue’s cultivation level had broken through to Qi disciple Level 2, and her Foundation was quite solid.
