“Aowu ...”

On the highest rock, the largest Wolf raised its head and let out a fierce roar.

The alpha Wolf’s cry was like a charging horn. In an instant, more than ten wolves pounced on Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei’s expression was serious, but he was not flustered at all. He held the military dagger tightly and advanced instead of retreating, facing the ferocious wolves.

Xia ruofei turned his body slightly. His body was like a strong bow that was pulled to the maximum. No one knew the strength that was contained in his seemingly thin body.

Although wolves were cunning animals, they were not humans. When they saw that Xia ruofei had revealed an opening, they immediately pounced on him without hesitation.

Xia ruofei sneered. He turned around and kicked a strong Wolf in the air, sending it flying a few meters away.

After the wolf landed on the ground, it was already motionless. Xia ruofei did not hold back at all in his kick. The Wolf’s internal organs were all crushed. While it was in mid – Air, the wolf was already dead.

This kick was the prologue to Xia ruofei’s attack.

At this moment, two more wolves had pounced on Xia ruofei at the same time. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

He strode forward as if he was taking a stroll in a courtyard and easily avoided one of the wolves. At the same time, he gently waved the military dagger in his hand, and the dagger flashed in the dark night, directly cutting off the head of the wolf.

Cang Lang’s body continued to fly forward due to inertia. As it flew, a large amount of blood spurted out from the wound on Cang Lang’s neck. The warm wolf blood splattered on Xia ruofei’s body and completely aroused his murderous intent.

At this moment, a few wolves had arrived at the same time. The wolf that had dodged earlier also turned around and pincered Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei sprinted forward a few steps, then stomped on the ground and leaped into the air. In the air, Xia ruofei aimed for a position and stomped on the head of a Wolf. His body overcame gravity and flew into the air again.

Just like that, Xia ruofei stepped on the heads of three wolves in a row. They all fell to the ground and died after letting out a miserable howl. Xia ruofei only had to step on them lightly and their heads were all crushed.

Xia ruofei did not linger in the battle. He chose to attack from the air. His actual target was the alpha Wolf, who had been standing quietly on the rock.

After a few tricks, Xia ruofei’s feet never touched the ground. He was already in front of the alpha Wolf.

The alpha Wolf had obviously realized the danger that Xia ruofei was in. It howled even more ferociously and crazily. The wolves ‘attack speed increased as well, surrounding Xia ruofei from all directions.

Xia ruofei’s body was obviously exhausted in mid – Air, but he still turned his body fiercely and used the strength of his waist and abdomen to change his direction. He kicked out with both legs and kicked away three or four wolves. At the same time, he finally stood on the rock that was occupied by the alpha.

It was as if Xia ruofei had eyes on the back of his head. He turned his hand and accurately grabbed the front paw of a Wolf. Then, he threw the wolf, which weighed more than a hundred pounds, with a back throw. It hit the rock wall heavily.

At the same time, the military dagger in Xia ruofei’s right hand drew a cold arc in the air and quickly slashed at the head Wolf’s neck.

The alpha Wolf howled and nimbly avoided its vital parts. Its huge body was extremely agile. In the blink of an eye, it opened its bloody mouth and bit towards Xia ruofei’s neck.

At the same time, at least five other wolves had already pounced on Xia ruofei.

Due to inertia, Xia ruofei’s right hand that was holding the knife was still slashing at the Alpha’s position. However, he did not panic at all. He used the momentum to turn his body and avoided the Alpha’s fatal blow. At the same time, he leaned his shoulder heavily against the alpha.

The alpha Wolf whimpered and staggered a few steps back from Xia ruofei’s collision.

Xia ruofei also took the opportunity to swing his hand back and took the lives of two more wolves in an instant. At the same time, he did not linger in the battle. With a kick of his feet, he rushed towards the direction of the head Wolf.

He swung his blade as fast as lightning.

The alpha subconsciously dodged to the right, but it did not know how cunning humans could be. Xia ruofei’s attack was a feint, and its center of gravity did not move with the attack.

The alpha dodged to the right, which was also within Xia ruofei’s calculations. He had already prepared his left fist and struck out heavily.

This was completely out of the Alpha’s expectations. In a flash, it had no time to react and Xia ruofei’s Iron Fist had hit its head.

The alpha Wolf howled and fell to the ground, blood flowing out of its mouth and nose. It kicked a few times with its four legs and died ...

Xia ruofei had used all his strength in this punch. Its power was no different from a heavy truck. Moreover, the area affected was so small that the explosive force instantly turned the head of the alpha into a paste.

After taking care of the alpha, Xia ruofei turned around. His body was covered in warm wolf blood. His right hand was holding the military dagger in reverse. He stood on the high Rock like a god of death. Under the moonlight, he looked murderous.

There were only five wolves left in the pack. At first, they were all aggressive and unreserved as they pounced on Xia ruofei. However, once the alpha Wolf died, the five wolves seemed to have lost their momentum. They subconsciously stopped and looked at Xia ruofei with vigilance.
