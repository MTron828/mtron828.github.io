Chapter 609: Chapter 450 – surpassing (2)

“Alright, get up!” Li Zhifu said indifferently.

“Yes, master ...”

Li Zhifu looked at Xia ruofei and said,””Little Xia, the tea – making matter has been settled. You see ...”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”old Mr. Li, I want Ling Yun to take me to Yan Xiaodong’s martyr’s grave in the afternoon. You must be tired from staying up all night. You can go home and rest. How about we leave after dinner?” This way, there will be fewer cars on the road, so we can reach San Shan in about three hours. ”

“Alright, I’ll listen to you!” Li Zhifu said with a smile.

“Master, boss Xia, have dinner at my place!” Said yang tree root quickly.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Mr. Yang, there will be a chance next time!” We’ve already troubled you a lot this time. We’ll have a simple meal at uncle bull’s place and then we’ll be on our way. ”

“Gen ‘er, don’t worry about it,” li Zhifu said.”We’ll talk about it when I come back from the three mountains!”

“Alright! Master, take care ...”

Xia ruofei first drove li Zhifu back to Niu Yusheng’s house, then he drove to xiangkeng village with ye Lingyun.

He came to the martyr Yan Xiaodong’s grave and took a look. The small grave had completely changed. Ye Lingyun found an engineering team to clear the weeds and the grave was also repaired with cement and marble.

The open space in front of the grave was also covered with a stone to prevent the weeds from growing again.

In front of the grave, there was a newly built small offering table with traces of incense on it. This was left behind by ye Lingyun when he paid respects to the martyrs after the grave was repaired.

......

The gravestone was still the same, but the words on it had all been drawn in red.

Xia ruofei took out the joss sticks, paper money, and offerings that had been prepared in advance from the car. He placed the offerings on the table one by one, then lit the joss sticks with ye Lingyun and inserted them into the incense burner in front of the tombstone.

Then, Xia ruofei took out three more cigarettes and lit them up. He placed them side by side in the incense burner. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Then, the two of them burned all the paper money they had brought. Throughout the whole process, Xia ruofei and ye Lingyun did not speak. They just burned the paper money quietly.

Xia ruofei said in his heart,”martyr Yan Xiaodong, elder song is too old to come here personally. I’ve come to visit you on his behalf ... I’ll come to pay my respects every Qingming Festival. Even if I can’t come, I’ll send someone over. Rest in peace here!”

After burning all the paper money, Xia ruofei poured three more glasses of white wine and said,””Yan Xiaodong, we’re going back now. Let’s give you three more toasts!”

Xia ruofei picked up the wine glass and slowly poured it on the ground.

Then, Xia ruofei took out his DSLR and took a few photos before packing up with ye Lingyun. Finally, they looked back at Yan Xiaodong’s tombstone and left in their car.

After returning to Niu Yusheng’s house, Xia ruofei asked Li Guizhi for a few sealed iron boxes for tea leaves. Almost every family in Wuyi Mountain had a container for storing tea leaves. Li Zhifu, who had been making tea for decades, naturally had one at home.

This kind of small sealed iron box could hold about 50 grams, and one box of tea leaves could be used to make seven or eight tea leaves.

Xia ruofei had filled five boxes, and almost half of his can of tea leaves had been consumed. There were only five or six taels left.

Li Zhifu woke up after two to three hours of sleep. He was packing his clothes and luggage.

Xia ruofei walked over with a box of tea leaves and said with a smile,””Old Mr. Li, this is for you. There aren’t many tea leaves, please have a taste.”

Li Zhifu didn’t reject it and took it directly, saying,””Thank you, Xia.”

He then opened the cabinet and carefully locked the tea leaves inside.

“You’re going to San Shan tonight. Didn’t you bring the tea leaves?”Xia ruofei asked curiously.

Li Zhifu didn’t even raise his head as he said,”can’t you give some of these tea leaves to little song when you go back?” I’ll just drink his when I get to the provincial capital! Of course, I have to hide such precious tea leaves well!”

Xia ruofei was speechless.

This old man who loved tea as much as his life looked honest, but he knew better than anyone else!

Xia ruofei beckoned ye Lingyun over and gave him a small box of tea.””Ling Yun, this is for you!”

“I don’t want to!” Ye linyun quickly waved his hand. You’d better keep such expensive tea leaves for yourself!”

“There will be more in the future!” Xia ruofei nudged ye Lingyun’s hand and said,”just take it! What are you waiting for?”

At this moment, li Zhifu said without raising his head,””Ling Yun! If you want to learn how to make tea, you must first learn how to taste tea. Since Xiao Xia gave it to you, you can just take it! Besides ... Even if you don’t drink it yourself, you can use it to show your respect to your master!”

Ye Lingyun and Xia ruofei looked at each other and thanked him while holding back their laughter. They took the tea box from Xia ruofei and walked to li Zhifu.

“Master, this is for you ...” Ye linyun said.

“You’re not going to keep it for yourself?” Li Zhifu declined symbolically.

“No, no, I can’t taste anything with my level!” Ye Lingyun quickly said,”besides, I’ve been learning from you. You can just bring me along when you drink tea. It’s most suitable to leave it here!”

“Mm.” Li Zhifu accepted the tea box and took out the key to open the small cabinet. After putting the tea leaves in the cabinet, he locked it carefully.

Xia ruofei, who was watching from the side, also found it funny.

This was the first time he had seen li Zhifu show his cunning side. This showed that li Zhifu really liked the tea leaves he had made this time. From another perspective, it showed that the Da Hong Pao tea leaves this time were really of good quality.
