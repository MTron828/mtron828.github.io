2023 Counterattack (2)

As an experienced sniper, when choosing a sniping position, he would definitely arrange the retreat route in advance.

It took Edmund five seconds to reach the guardrails on the other side of the rooftop. There was a steel cable hanging there, connected to a slightly shorter building opposite.

Edmund quickly took out a lock from his bag, one end fixed under the pulley, and the other fixed to his waist.

Then, Edmund jumped over the guardrail, grabbed the pulley with both hands, and pushed hard on the guardrail. His body immediately slid out in the direction of the opposite building.

The whole evacuation process only took a dozen seconds. Edmund finally relaxed a little. He said to himself, I’ll definitely not accept such missions in the future! That guy was simply a pervert!

He had never seen such an agile person. Under the aim of three or four sniper rifles, he could actually Dodge and Dodge without being injured. This was simply too terrifying!

Edmund slid to about half the position when he heard Monty’s slightly frightened shout from his earpiece,Edmund! He’s here! He’s here!

Edmund was stunned for a moment. He tried to turn his head back and saw a figure appear on the roof of the building. The figure even had the time to smile at Edmund. Then, he reached out and drew a line on the steel rope, lowering his body to avoid the bullets that were coming from other directions.

Edmund suddenly felt his body sink, and then he fell uncontrollably. He was terrified and grabbed the steel rope with all his might.

However, this was just a last – ditch struggle. Although he avoided falling directly from the sky, he had no way to reconnect the steel cable, so the next moment, he crashed straight into the opposite building.

Edmund howled in despair. The outer wall of the building rapidly enlarged in his eyes.

Bang! Bang! With a muffled sound, Edmund crashed into the building. At this speed, with such a huge impact, even a kui cow would not be able to withstand it, let alone a fragile human body.

Edmund had died almost at the moment of impact.

Before he fell into eternal darkness, Edmund’s last thought was,How could he be so fast I just need five more seconds and I can escape ...

After Xia ruofei broke the steel rope with his bare hands, he didn’t care about Edmund anymore because he knew that Edmund was dead for sure.

After he dodged a sniper bullet, he used the concrete fence of the building as cover and quickly arrived at the spot where Edmund had sniped.

Xia ruofei glanced at the sniper rifle that Edmund had abandoned and couldn’t help but whistle. He muttered to himself,”M82! This gang of yakuzas is really well – equipped!

The M82A1 large – caliber sniper rifle produced in the United States was known as the King of snipers. On the 12.7mm sniper rifle market, the M82a1 almost dominated the market for its long range, high accuracy, and powerful performance. The military and police forces of at least 30 countries were equipped with this sniper rifle.

The Chinese army had their own domestic sniper rifle, which was also of excellent performance. The ordinary soldiers of the reconnaissance team naturally had no chance to come into contact with foreign firearms. However, the lone wolf assault team was different. Although they used the same standard equipment in actual combat, the soldiers of the lone wolf had the opportunity to come into contact with and learn from some of the famous foreign firearms. Xia ruofei had naturally used open fire guns like the M82A1 before and was very impressed with the performance of this sniper rifle.

He lay on the rooftop and deftly removed the magazine to check. There were six bullets left. The standard magazine could hold ten bullets. In other words, Edmund had fired four times but did not even touch a hair on Xia ruofei’s head.

In addition, there were two magazines filled with large – caliber sniper bullets on the ground. Edmund was in a hurry and didn’t have time to take these things away.

Xia ruofei immediately loaded a fully loaded magazine and quickly loaded it. He moved his eyes to the scope and adjusted the direction of the muzzle.

Sean Gelman had already retreated to the outside of the construction site under the protection of a large number of bodyguards and was about to board his bulletproof Mercedes – Benz.

Xia ruofei was not in a hurry to shoot. He knew that as long as he did not hit his target with the first shot, he would not have a second chance. The bodyguards would immediately form layers of meat shields. Even if he ran out of bullets, he would not be able to kill Sean.

Xia ruofei held his breath and placed his finger gently on the trigger. He kept adjusting the direction of the muzzle according to what he saw through the scope.

A bodyguard pulled open the car door, and under the heavy protection of the bodyguards, Sean Gehrman got down to the side of the car and lowered his head to get into the car.

When they were closing the door, one of the bodyguards moved slightly to the side, leaving a small gap.

He had been waiting for this opportunity! Xia ruofei quickly adjusted and stabilized the muzzle. Then, he pulled the trigger without hesitation ...

The bodyguard felt a chill in his ear, and then he heard a pfft. He quickly turned around and saw Sean Gehrman’s eyes wide open as he collapsed on the car seat.

There was a huge bullet hole on the left side of Sean’s forehead. It had almost pierced through his head, and red and white liquid was gurgling out of it ...

The bodyguards immediately surrounded the car and screamed in horror.

Only the bodyguard who felt a chill in his ear was stunned. He reached out to touch his ear and found that his hand was covered in blood. Obviously, the bullet just flew past his ear.

As a professional bodyguard, he knew very well that the angle of the shot just now was very small. If the other party’s hand had trembled slightly, the one whose head would have been shot would not have been Sean, but him ...

This caused him to feel a sense of fear, and his back was already drenched in cold sweat.

The bodyguards were not afraid of death as they surrounded the important person that Jian Jia and the others were responsible for protecting. The person was assassinated in front of everyone. If they couldn’t kill the murderer, they would die even if they returned.

Xia ruofei was not in a hurry to leave. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

There were at least three snipers just now. He had to get rid of them in passing to prevent these snipers from sniping Lu zhengfeng and the rest when they were fighting with the Mafia.

In fact, after the three of them saw Xia ruofei kill Edmund, none of them hesitated for even a second. They all chose to retreat decisively.

Every sniper had shot at Xia ruofei more than once, so Xia ruofei knew their sniping positions like the back of his hand.

After killing Sean, his eyes did not leave the scope. He turned the head of the gun at an angle.

It was an eight – story building about 400 meters away, and one of the snipers was hiding in the building.

Xia ruofei accurately found the window where the sniper had laid in ambush. The sniper’s gun was still in front of the window, but the person was gone.

He looked left and right through the scope, and soon a figure running at full speed appeared in the scope’s field of view.

The sniper had obviously been professionally trained. He kept changing his position as he ran, and he deliberately chose walls, pillars, and other obstacles to seek protection.

If it was an ordinary sniper, under such circumstances, they would most likely not have the chance to make a move.

However, Xia ruofei’s reflexes were much better than the best snipers. Besides, he had also undergone strict sniper training and was very familiar with this model of sniper rifle.

Many factors determined that the sniper would not be able to escape.

Xia ruofei was highly focused. The muzzle of his gun kept following the trajectory of the sniper’s movement. Then, he fired decisively.

This shot seemed to be aimed at a gap and fired, not at anyone at all. However, in the next moment, the figure of the sniper appeared in that gap, as if he had delivered himself to the door.

The sniper bullet accurately hit his head, and his eyes revealed a look of disbelief as he softly fell to the ground.

Two more! Xia ruofei said emotionlessly. He turned his gun around and looked for his next target.

A minute later, with two crisp gunshots, the four snipers sent by the Gehrman family had been completely eliminated by Xia ruofei.

At that moment, Sean’s bodyguards had already rushed to the bottom of the building.

They knew very well how terrifying the killer Upstairs was, but they still chose to charge into the building with no way out.

Xia ruofei clapped his hands and stood up.

He put the sniper rifle and the remaining bullets into the spirit map space, then rushed to the other side of the roof. Without hesitation, he jumped over the guardrail and jumped down from the building like a ROC spreading its wings ...
