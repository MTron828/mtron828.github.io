2842 An unintentional Willow (2)

A video that was posted on Weibo had to go through a manual review process. Generally, videos that did not have any tendency to make mistakes would also pass the review. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

After Xia ruofei posted the video, he didn’t bother about it anymore. He met up with Song Wei and Ling Qingxue and walked towards the training ground for the first team.

Wu Lei and a few players who had come to the training ground earlier were already jogging to warm up. When they saw Xia ruofei and the other two, they all waved and greeted them.

Xia ruofei saw the old goalkeeper, Diego Lopez, the center back, Naldo, and Wu Lei’s forward partner, iglesias. He smiled and waved to everyone.

Xia ruofei turned to Song Wei and Ling Qingxue and said,””Why don’t you guys take a walk by yourselves? I told you guys to just rest in the hotel. Isn’t it boring to watch us train here?”

Ling Qingxue giggled and replied,”I wouldn ‘t!” It’s so sunny today. It’s not boring to watch you train on the green field!”

“Alright! Then you guys can do as you please!” Xia ruofei said,”I’m going to warm up too!”

“Do you still need to warm up?” Song Wei asked, speechless.

With Xia ruofei’s current strength, he could play two or three high – intensity games in a row without any warm – up.

In front of ordinary people, his physical fitness was a bug that could not be solved.

“When in Rome, do as the Romans do!” Xia ruofei smiled and waved at the two of them. At this moment, Wu Lei and the others had just finished another round and came over. Hence, he jogged to catch up and joined the running team.

Soon, the players arrived at the training ground one after another. The first thing they saw was naturally Song Wei and Ling Qingxue, who were by the side of the field. The players were no longer unfamiliar with these two Oriental beauties because they had come here to visit with Xia ruofei. Moreover, when they were playing against Barcelona, these two beauties were in the private room with the club’s owner, Zhou leiyun, to watch the game.

Therefore, although the beautiful woman was beautiful, this group of football players with excessive hormones did not dare to have any improper thoughts. They just nodded at the two of them and rushed into the training ground.

Xia ruofei was wearing the team’s training uniform and running laps in the team. The players who came later did not notice at first. When they saw that Xia ruofei was also in the team, they were all shocked.

Even Ruby, who had arrived at the training ground on time, was surprised to see Xia ruofei.

However, Xia ruofei was a member of the team, so he could naturally attend the training. Ruby did not say anything. Due to Xia ruofei’s special identity, Ruby was especially serious in organizing the training today, for fear that he would have an improper working attitude in front of the shareholders of the club.

Xia ruofei followed the team to warm up and then participated in the entire training.

It had been a few days since the last game, and the league tournament was about to start on the weekend, so today’s training had begun to increase. The team’s training was carefully arranged to ensure that the players were in their best form on the day of the game.

Of course, Xia ruofei had no problems and completed the training easily.

He didn’t know that during the half – day he had been training, the video he had posted on Weibo had once again attracted a large number of netizens to watch, and that the topic had suddenly become a hot topic.

Because of the time difference, the video was released at about two or threeo’ clock in the afternoon in China. At this time, there were still quite a lot of people online.

Xia ruofei was now an out – and – out Weibo verified account. The news that he posted on his account would be seen by many netizens at the first moment.

After everyone saw the video, they all started to comment.

“As a public figure, Wu Lei knows how to protect the country and the national flag’s dignity at all times. He has good professional ethics and good citizen qualities!”

Some netizens were obviously more familiar with Wu Lei and wrote in the comments,””It reminds me of the national team Backpack with the national flag printed on it when Wu Lei joined Espanyol! I like Wu Lei’s patriotism!”

There were also netizens who commented,’what I’m more concerned about is, why did CEO Xia post this video? It seems like my President Xia and Wu Lei are going to form a couple!”

They were obviously Xia ruofei’s loyal fans.

In short, although everyone’s comments were different, most of them were compliments. Everyone was praising Wu Lei for his “high IQ and EQ.” Of course, there were also a few trolls who criticized Wu Lei for rejecting the fans because he was acting like a big Shot. Such brainless comments were naturally drowned out by comments such as “watching football costs electricity” and “if you have the ability to understand, don’t come out and go online”. They were quickly scolded by many netizens and did not dare to come out.

What was even rarer was that “Huaxia daily”,”national television news”,”Tuan Tuan”, and other mainstream media and party media all reposted Xia ruofei’s Weibo post and wrote short comments praising Wu Lei’s behavior.

It was also because of these mainstream media platforms that this matter quickly rushed to the Weibo hot search list, and the ranking shot up like a rocket.

After Xia ruofei posted on Weibo, he went straight to training. He had no idea that the video he posted would cause such a huge reaction in the domestic public in just one or two hours.

Wu Lei had no idea that he had become famous again. He didn’t even know that Xia ruofei had captured this scene and uploaded the video on a whim.

After the morning training, Xia ruofei had wanted to organize a small game with a few people. However, considering that the training today was not small, even Wu Lei, who had been practicing the first set of the Golden Man body refining movements, was so tired that he was panting. Besides, he had promised Wu Lei that he would send gifts to the women’s ladder team after the training, so he gave up the idea of playing a small game.

Hence, Xia ruofei followed the players back to the locker room to sort things out. He did not say why he suddenly joined the training. Ruby did not ask too much either. Anyway, Xia ruofei was one of the bosses of the team and had the right to be willful.

The facilities in the locker room were very complete. The players could take a shower after training, then change into clean clothes and leave. The professional clubs in Europe had a training system. The players were similar to the general white – collar workers. According to the team’s arrangements, they trained at the same time every day and got off work and went home at the same time. The only difference was that they played one or two games every week during the season, sometimes at home and sometimes away.

Professional players were used to this kind of life. While Xia ruofei was still in the shower, Wu Lei had already changed into his casual clothes.

He sat on a chair in the changing room and waited for Xia ruofei. The other players were faster and waved goodbye to him one after another before leaving the changing room.

The waiting time was always boring. Wu Lei took out his phone from his bag, wanting to play something.

As soon as he turned on his phone, he saw a few missed calls and dozens of unread messages on WeChat. He couldn’t help but be stunned. Did something happen?

He didn’t rush to return the call. Instead, he checked his WeChat messages first. He had to wait for the other party to pick up and ask about the situation. He might be able to find out if he just looked at the message on WeChat. Naturally, the latter was more efficient.

Wu Lei opened his WeChat and found that the messages were all from domestic coaches, teammates, and even national team leaders.

He clicked on the top one. It was the WeChat ID of his first coach, Xu Genbao. He had pinned it at the top and it would always be at the top. This little detail showed how irreplaceable Xu Genbao was in his heart.

Xu Genbao had sent a voice message. Older people tended to type slower, so voice messages were much more convenient.

Wu Lei clicked on the voice message, and a familiar voice came out of the phone.””Leizi! You did the right thing! The national flag was not to be blasphemed! I saw Huaxia daily and the National television praising you for protecting the national flag! I’m so proud of you! When you play alone overseas, you have to pay more attention to maintaining the country’s image at all times! Do you know that?”
