Xia ruofei replied indifferently,”not bad!” If Wang Boshan continues to contact you, do you know what to do?”

“I’ll follow your instructions and feign civility with him! Let him be as patient as possible. ” Benilatti said without hesitation,”and we are ready to contact him and give him false information according to your latest instructions!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”very good!” You have to continue to familiarize yourself with the countermeasures I’ve instructed you to take, so that no matter when Wang Boshan calls you, you can skillfully respond. And even if the questions he asks are beyond the scope of the plan I’ve set for you, you have to be able to deal with them properly. ”

“Yes!” “Yes,” benilatti replied.

“You should go and rest!” Xia ruofei said. Then, he looked at Li Yifu and said,”Yifu, you should also go and familiarize yourself with the transformation plan! I’m going to continue processing the raw materials!”

“Alright, martial granduncle!” Li Yifu said. Then, he took the island transformation plan that Xia ruofei had personally drawn up and walked to the side to read it carefully.

Xia ruofei continued to process the materials.

Now that the nine Jade pillars had been processed, the processing of the other materials was relatively simple. Hence, Xia ruofei was very efficient.

Of course, Xia ruofei had not started to carve the core formation plate yet.

In fact, the details of the plan had already been confirmed. Xia ruofei could start to inscribe the array disc. However, inscribing the array disc required a high level of concentration. There could not be any interruption or interruption in the middle. It would take a long time, so it was not suitable for him to inscribe it now.

Besides, the core array disc was so important that Xia ruofei had to be in his best condition before he could start carving it. He had stayed up for two nights and was not in his best condition.

It wasn’t a big problem to process ordinary materials in this state, but it wasn’t suitable for carving the core array disc.

In fact, Xia ruofei had already planned it out. He decided to carve the core array disc in the spirit map space. After he processed the materials, he would have to return to China. Otherwise, Wang Boshan and his martial uncle Zheng would not be able to wait indefinitely.

Li Yifu was in charge of the island’s transformation, and as long as it was completed step by step according to his plan, there was basically no possibility of any problems. On the other hand, Xia ruofei had to meet Wang Boshan and martial uncle Zheng in person to find out more about them. At the same time, he had to buy as much time as possible for the transformation of the Paradise Island. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

After returning, Xia ruofei could find time to enter the spirit map space. The environment there was unique, and he could make use of the difference in the flow of time to complete the core array disc without delay.

Xia ruofei spent the entire afternoon processing the materials.

The processed materials were stored in a special place and carefully marked. In two days, when Li Yifu presided over the island’s transformation, he could directly take the materials according to the labels.

After dinner, Xia ruofei continued to work on the materials for the formation. At around nineo’ clock in the evening, the first batch of 50 people that Li Yifu had recruited from Australia to Peach Blossom Island was about to land. Li Yifu personally went to the airport to pick them up, while Xia ruofei did not move away and was still busy working on the materials.

Most of the materials were for the appearance and size. A small portion of them required simple array patterns. To Xia ruofei, it was not difficult at all. It was just a tedious and repetitive labor.

Li Yifu returned with his men at around 10 pm.

Only then did Xia ruofei put down his work and got up to meet everyone.

Of course, Xia ruofei was meeting everyone as paradise corporation’s Human Resources Department’s Commissioner Xu. These brothers from the Australian Freemasons naturally did not recognize him. Even Tang Hu, who had dealt with him a few times, did not recognize him. Instead, he kept asking if Xia ruofei was there.

When Tang Hu received the news from “Commissioner Xu” that Xia ruofei was currently not on Peach Blossom Island, he was very disappointed and immediately lost interest in continuing the conversation with “Commissioner Xu.”

Since Xia ruofei did not reveal his identity, the brothers from the Australian Tang sect naturally followed Li Yifu’s lead. Although they had heard of Xia ruofei’s name, they did not treat him so well. Li Yifu was one of the founding members of the Hong sect and was also the idol of many young members. Hence, he was much more popular than Xia ruofei, who was pretending to be ‘Commissioner Xu’.

During the day, Liu Qingfeng had arranged for people to build two rows of mobile temporary houses next to the airport warehouse. The facilities in the temporary houses were equipped from the island’s material reserve warehouse. Every bed was covered with brand new sheets, quilts, tables, chairs, benches, and other furniture.

In addition, Liu Qingfeng also asked the chef to prepare in advance, for the brothers of the Hong sect who had just gotten off the plane, to prepare hot supper.

Everyone had been on the plane for a long time and were already exhausted. Xia ruofei would not be so heartless as to screen these people overnight. However, just in case, he still arranged for the guards of the Paradise Island to stand guard around the mobile houses. If someone really wanted to sneak out, they would definitely be stopped.
