Xia ruofei hesitated for a moment. After all, this pot of orchid did not belong to him. It would not be appropriate to use someone else’s item as a bet. Chen Song sneered when he saw this,”this junior has already agreed, what else do you have to consider?” Could it be that you’re bluffing, but you don’t actually dare to bet?” Xia ruofei was not even interested in responding to such a low – Level goading. He only glanced at Chen Song indifferently before he turned to Lu You and said with a smile,””What if I lose by accident? I can’t find an identical Mo Lan to compensate you ...” Lu You pouted.”It’s a loss. You don’t have to compensate me for the orchids.” “How can I accept that?” Xia ruofei chuckled. “If you’re embarrassed, then ...” Lu You glanced at Xia ruofei and said,”if you lose, you’ll have to compensate Yueyue by being her boyfriend!” “Youyou ...” Jiang Yue’s face was red with embarrassment. She clenched her teeth and bashfully hit Lu You. You Jun, who was standing at the side, was almost on fire when he heard this. He was an admirer of Jiang Yue and had been pursuing her for a long time. Through these few interactions, even a fool could tell that Jiang Yue had feelings for Xia ruofei. Naturally, you Jun had also felt it long ago. Xia ruofei was even more dumbfounded. He thought to himself, this miss Lu really dares to say anything! He actually ... Lu You pouted and said,”alright!” I was just joking with you! If you want to bet, then bet. Anyway, if you lose, it’s on me, and if you win, you can have it!” “No additional conditions?” Xia ruofei asked carefully. “I’ll go back on my word if you continue ...”Lu You glared at him and said. “I’ll bet on it!” Xia ruofei said firmly. Then, he looked at Chen Song and asked,””Speak! What kind of bet?” Chen song’s eyes revealed a trace of joy. He quickly calmed his mind and said proudly, “It’s very simple. Your jade lion ...” Chen Song looked at the flower pot in Xia ruofei’s hand that was covered by a big black plastic bag. He said cautiously,””That’s right, there’s a condition. The pot of flowers you’re holding must be the pot of Molan from three days ago. If you change it to another flower, then the bet is void!” “Don’t worry!”Xia ruofei laughed. It was the pot of Mo Lan from three days ago! If I switch, don’t void the bet this time, just consider it my loss!” Only then did Chen Song nod his head in relief. He continued,”Then there’s no problem. The rules are very simple, your pot of jade lion and the Yang family’s lotus flower that our school is exhibiting, whoever wins the gold Prize. ” Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows and said,”what if they don’t get the gold Prize?” I heard that there are three silver prizes in this exhibition. What if both pots of flowers win the silver Prize?” “This is impossible!” Chen Song said without hesitation,”if our Yang family’s Su He can’t win the gold medal, then no pot of flowers in this exhibition is qualified to win the gold medal!” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.”According to what you’ve said, there’s no need to make this bet! You’ve already decided on the gold Prize, so we should just give you this pot of mo orchid ...” The students of Sanshan University’s Garden Club could not help but burst into laughter. Although Xia Cheng and the others were not confident at all, this matter had already involved the face of Sanshan University’s and Agriculture and Forestry University’s gardening club. It could even be said that it had escalated to a battle between the two schools. Naturally, everyone had a common enemy. Chen song’s expression turned ugly. However, in terms of eloquence, he was far inferior to Xia ruofei. Just now, Xia ruofei’s “everyone in the world is your mother” had choked him so much that he could not speak for a long time. Xia ruofei shrugged.”I’ll still say the same thing. Since we’re going to bet, we should make the rules clear first. This is called ‘gentleman comes after villain’. Otherwise, it’ll be meaningless to wrangle in the end. ” “Hmph!” Chen Song coldly snorted.”As you wish then. This time, we’ll win a higher prize than the other two pots. If they win the same prize, then we’ll ask the organizing committee of the Expo to give a higher prize for the two pots of flowers!” Xia ruofei snapped his fingers and said, “Couldn’t you have said so earlier? I’ll bet! Take good care of that strange stone of yours. Don’t lose and be unable to take out the bet!” “Leave this sentence for yourself!” Chen Song sneered. Help me take care of this jade lion!” After he finished speaking, Chen Song flicked his sleeves and left. “Big brother Xia, this man is really arrogant!” Jiang Yue looked at Chen song’s back and said unhappily,”it’s as if they’re going to win for sure ...” Xia Cheng, on the other hand, looked worried and said,””Mr. Xia, I heard that the Yang family’s lotus flower in the exhibition is a rare treasure. Our jade lion ...” Xia ruofei laughed in a relaxed manner. It’s fine. This pot of flowers belongs to Lu You anyway. I won’t lose anything if I lose ...” Xia Cheng and the others were sweating profusely ... Lu You couldn’t help but roll her eyes and cast a sidelong glance at Xia ruofei without hesitation. They started to walk toward the campus of Agriculture and Forestry University. The southeast province University flower exhibition was held once every two years. It had been held five times, and this year was the sixth. The universities in the southeast province took turns hosting the exhibition, and it happened to be the Agriculture and Forestry University’s turn this time. At first, the flower Fair was just an exchange event between the gardening clubs and other student clubs of various universities. As the number of events increased, its influence increased day by day. Every opening would have many journalists interviewing them, and the universities also paid more and more attention to it.
