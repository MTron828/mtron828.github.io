2372 Difficult win_The high priest Manzila’s face turned extremely ugly, and the warm smile on his face became a little ferocious.

He didn’t open his mouth to explain. Since Xia ruofei had said the word “Satan”, it meant that he had already discovered his identity. Any explanation now would be in vain.

Manzilla was shocked because the identity of “Satan” was a top secret. No one knew about it except for boa constrictor. There was no need to doubt the loyalty of Boak. His mind was in a mess. He could not believe that this Eastern man had exposed his secret identity.

However, Manzila was also a fierce and ambitious person. He was very decisive and ruthless in dealing with problems.

After Xia ruofei said the word “Satan”, Manzila was only dazed for a moment. Then, he did not hide the murderous aura on his body at all and hit Xia ruofei with his palm.

Xia ruofei was already prepared. He could feel the violent energy fluctuation in Manzila’s palm, so he slightly tilted his body to avoid it.

Xia ruofei felt a scorching hot air brush past him and hit the brick floor, causing many small stones to fly up and leaving a small pit on the brick.

From the first contact, Xia ruofei could tell that Manzila was at refined Qi Level 3. Although he felt very strange that an African Black man had cultivated the Daoist techniques of Huaxia, at least for now, this cultivator could not threaten him.

That was enough. As long as Manzila was suppressed by Xia ruofei, he would be imprisoned for life.

A faint smile hung on Xia ruofei’s lips as he moved like lightning. The short distance between the two of them disappeared in the blink of an eye, and in the blink of an eye, he had already arrived beside Manzila.

Xia ruofei’s palms, which were filled with true energy, slammed towards Manzila’s face.

Manzila immediately sensed danger, but Xia ruofei’s speed was too fast. He did not have time to react or dodge. He could only grit his teeth and cross his arms, hoping to block Xia ruofei’s attack.

At that moment, Xia ruofei’s palms were firmly imprinted on Manzila’s forearms. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

With a crack, Manzila let out a muffled groan, and his whole body flew out and knocked into the simple table next to him. The pots and pans on the table fell to the ground with a clatter.

Manzila also fell to the ground. His face was very serious. He did not expect Xia ruofei to be so strong. Both of his arms were broken after the first exchange, and he had lost half of his combat power.

After Xia ruofei’s attack, he didn’t stop at all. He stomped on the ground and shot towards Manzilla. Then, he stomped on Manzilla’s thigh. Unlike the other members of the modr organization that Xia Rufei had dealt with in the past two days, Manzilla was a true cultivator. Hence, Xia ruofei didn’t hold back at all. The first thing he wanted to do was to make Manzilla lose the ability to resist.

Manzila’s arms were broken, and his mobility was affected. Facing Xia ruofei’s continuous and fierce attacks, he could only roll awkwardly to avoid the kick.

Xia ruofei’s foot stomped heavily on the floor tiles, leaving a deep footprint.

He fell in Manzila’s direction, turned around, and elbowed Manzila’s leg.

Xia ruofei’s movements were too fast, and Manzila had no way to Dodge. Another bone – chilling crack was heard, and Manzila’s right leg was twisted in an irregular way.

Manzila suddenly felt a sharp pain, and a large amount of cold sweat appeared on his forehead. He could not help but scream, and the muscles on his face trembled.

Xia ruofei did not show any mercy. He stretched out his hands from the ground and grabbed Manzilla’s other leg. With a twist, he broke Manzilla’s leg.

In just a few seconds, Manzila had completely lost the ability to move, let alone fight.

Xia ruofei stood up and looked at Manzila coldly.

The muscles on Manzila’s face were twisted because of the pain, and his teeth were chattering uncontrollably. This was not because of fear, but because of the intense pain.

Manzila panted heavily as he squeezed out a smile at Xia ruofei. He said in a trembling voice,”Amazing! I ... Admire you ...”

Xia ruofei was not in the mood to talk nonsense with Manzila. He directly followed the spiritual hypnosis method and shrouded Manzila with his spiritual force.

Xia ruofei had thought that this would be a piece of cake and was ready to start the interrogation. However, to his surprise, Manzila’s eyes only showed a brief moment of confusion, but he quickly regained his clarity.

“Eh?” Xia ruofei mumbled to himself,”interesting ...”

“You ... What did you ... Do to me?” Manzila asked in horror.

Xia ruofei did not care. He increased the intensity of his spiritual force and tried to hypnotize Manzila for the second time.

This time, Manzila was on guard and did not even lose focus for a moment. There was only a trace of panic in his eyes.

Xia ruofei did not believe it. Once again, he gathered his spiritual power and continued to attack Manzila.
