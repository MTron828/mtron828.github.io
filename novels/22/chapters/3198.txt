3199 This song should only be played in the heavens (2)

Moreover, he was also a little impatient to hear what song it was that had to be hidden so well.

If he could find the right song, would he be able to discover some shocking secret?

Xia ruofei asked Ling Qingxue and Song Wei to freshen up as soon as possible while he walked out to the courtyard to stretch his muscles and breathe in some fresh air.

The main thing was that he knew that as long as he appeared in the courtyard, Mu Sheng, Liu Mansha, and the others would also come out very quickly.

As expected, just as Xia ruofei was about to move his limbs and sit down at the stone table, Chen Xuan, Mu Sheng and the rest walked out of the room.

“Morning!” Xia ruofei greeted him with a smile.

“Thank you for your hard work, brother Xia!” “You didn’t sleep last night?” Chen Xuan asked with a smile.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””I can’t stop once I’ve done something. I might as well finish it in one go!” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“So, little brother Xia has already finished?” Mu Sheng asked.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””Yup! I formed different music sheets from the various possibilities that we discussed and entered them into the software one by one. More than 20 songs were generated. As for the secret we want to know, I’m not sure if it’s in these 20 songs ...”

“That’s great!” Mu Sheng said happily,”little brother Xia, thank you for your hard work!”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Actually, it’s all repetitive work without any technical content. It’s mainly a test of patience. It’s not hard work ...”

Mu Sheng deliberately put on a bitter face and said,”little brother Xia, we old men don’t know anything about the job that you said has no technical content!” After hearing what you said, we feel even more useless!”

“That’s not what I meant ...” Xia ruofei explained.”It’s easy for sect leader mu to learn these things. It’s just that there’s no need to!”

In terms of learning ability, Mu Sheng and Liu Mansha, who were in the intermediate stage of the Golden core realm, only needed a few hours to master the basic knowledge of computer operation and the use of a software. However, as Xia ruofei had said, they did not need to use it at all, so it was naturally unnecessary.

Xia ruofei continued.”I plan to listen to these songs now. I won’t be having breakfast. What do you think?”

“Just what I wanted!” Mu Sheng said.

“I can’t wait either!” Liu Mansha said with a smile.

“I agree!” Chen Xuan replied.

For cultivators, three meals a day was more of a continuation of a habit. Their bodies had already exceeded the scope of ordinary people, and they did not need to eat every day.

In fact, it was a relatively low – Level method to obtain energy through eating food. It was much more direct for cultivators to absorb the spiritual energy of heaven and earth than eating.

“Then it’s decided!” Xia ruofei said.

He called Wu Qiang directly and told him that he and the guests would not be eating breakfast today. In addition, there was a more important matter in the master’s courtyard, and he asked him to tell everyone not to enter the courtyard.

Then, Xia ruofei brought everyone to the basement.

The siheyuan had a large basement, and there was a very professional movie and music Hall in it, which was basically the configuration of a small cinema.

The sound system in the theater was very professional, so the effect was naturally much better than the computer.

Xia ruofei wanted to listen to more than 20 songs today. The first thing he thought of was to come to the recording studio.

In addition to the sound effects, the sound insulation was also very good. Basically, once the door was closed, no sound could be heard from the outside.

The group walked into the movie hall. There were a total of two rows of eight very comfortable leather couches placed in a semicircle, facing the movie screen in front of them.

Xia ruofei asked everyone to find a place to sit down first. Then, he went to the small screening room in the studio, connected the computer to the mixer, and made some simple adjustments. The sound effect was very good.

Then, Xia ruofei walked out of the screening room and said to everyone,””Everyone, please wait for a moment. I’ll set up a sound – proof barrier, and then we’ll start to listen to the music!”

With that, Xia ruofei walked out of the recording hall and skillfully set up a formation barrier around the area, covering the entire Hall.

This way, not a single sound could be heard.

Xia ruofei had also considered the fact that the music score was heavily protected. It was encrypted and recorded on the token. He did not know if there would be any special effects. If the sound leaked out and was heard by the staff outside or even the passersby in the alley, it would be difficult to deal with it.

In short, there was no harm in being careful.

After setting up the barrier, Xia ruofei returned to the recording hall.

Mu Sheng and the others were already a little impatient. Xia ruofei smiled and said,””I’m going to start playing the songs in order. There are a total of 26 songs, and I’ve already numbered them!”

“Let’s start!” Mu Sheng said,”we’re all ready!”

Xia ruofei nodded and walked into the small screening room. His heart was filled with anticipation. He selected the song numbered 1 on the music arrangement software and played it.

A melodious tune rang out in the recording hall. The top – notch sound system created a very good surrounding effect, causing people to involuntarily immerse themselves in the atmosphere of listening.

Xia ruofei stood at the door of the screening room, listening to the song with his eyes closed.

He had to admit that the melody was beautiful. Even though the score looked simple, the music had a unique quality to it. It was similar to the Chinese folk music style, but it was better than any of the folk music that Xia ruofei had ever heard.

After a long time, the song ended.

Xia ruofei finally opened his eyes and looked at the crowd.

“How do you feel, Valley master Liu?” Xia ruofei asked.

“It’s a beautiful melody, but I don’t think it’s the correct version ...”Liu Mansha said with a smile.

Mu Sheng nodded in agreement and said,””The melody is indeed very beautiful, but I keep feeling that there are some places that are not particularly coordinated. As for the specific reason, I can’t tell!”

“Brother Chen, what do you think?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

Chen Xuan pondered for a moment before saying,””I have the same feeling as the two seniors, this song is probably not the best version!”

Xia ruofei nodded and smiled.””Looks like everyone’s feeling is the same as mine.”

When Xia ruofei listened to the song, he also felt that although the melody was very nice, he could more or less feel a trace of disharmony. Especially when he used his spiritual power to listen, this feeling was more obvious.

Xia ruofei had recorded more than 20 versions of the song. In fact, the difference between each version was very subtle, and there might only be a few minor adjustments.

Therefore, he was pretty sure that this song wasn’t the answer they were looking for.

“Then let’s continue with the second song!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

...

Then, he walked into the screening room and clicked on the second song.

This song also made people feel that it was a bit uncoordinated, and it was what everyone felt.

Then, the third song, the fourth song ...

Xia ruofei and the others listened to 18 songs in a row.

Everyone couldn’t help but feel a little emotional. The overall melody of the song was basically the same, but after some minor adjustments, it gave people a different feeling.

What was even rarer was that these 18 songs were definitely the best of the best. If any of these songs were to be uploaded onto the internet, it would definitely be crazily sought after by people who loved folk music. Even people who didn’t usually like to listen to pure music would be attracted by it.

But to everyone’s disappointment, these 18 songs still felt a little off. It felt like they were just a little bit away from perfection, but they were just a little bit off.

Of course, after listening to the 18 songs, although they still didn’t gain anything, their confidence increased.

These 18 songs had fully proved that the combination of numbers obtained by solving the floating point pattern of the token through supercomputing was not a meaningless pile of numbers.

This also confirmed their conclusion that Yingying had really found the right direction this time!

Xia ruofei was not discouraged. After exchanging opinions with everyone, he played the 19th song.

...

This time, it was the same melody that everyone was familiar with. However, when the melody played in the recording room, Xia ruofei’s body trembled slightly.

His mouth was slightly open, and although his eyes were focused ahead, they were clearly not focused.

The moment the song was played, Xia ruofei had already entered a wonderful state ...
