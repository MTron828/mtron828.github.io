“Haha, I’ve captured a wild flower addict alive!”

As everyone chatted, they unknowingly went off topic ...

It was impossible for such news to be spread in a small circle all the time. The convenience of the internet made the speed of information spread infinitely faster. In fact, it was only a few mouse clicks away in the San Shan and Jing.

Soon, someone posted the content of the post on Weibo and even took some pictures of the controversial comments.

Originally, on such a national platform, the content produced every day was countless, and most of the content would quietly sink to the bottom without causing any waves.

However, there had been a lot of news about the peach blossom company recently, and the person who reposted the post also often used Weibo. Not only did few big V ‘s, but he also added a few topics related to the peach blossom company, such as #jadeshi cream #, which really attracted a lot of traffic.

Coincidentally, the editor on duty on the Weibo platform also happened to see this Weibo post in the vast back – end content.

The editor still remembered how popular the topic of the Jade skin cream was last time. When he saw that the content on Weibo was related to the Paradise company, and it was an eye – catching content like the nouveau riche’s Annual Meeting, he immediately gave a hot recommendation.

All of a sudden, the number of views on this Weibo page shot up.

Unlike the Banyan Tree forum, Weibo’s audience came from all over China, so its influence was naturally much greater.

Xia ruofei and the others had just returned to the farm and were still unaware of what was happening on the internet. On Weibo, the topic #peach blossom company’s annual gathering of local tycoons #had already reached the top ten most searched topics.

The number of views on the first Weibo post went from 10000 to 100000 to 1000000, and it took less than an hour.

There were also countless new Weibo accounts that used this topic to discuss.

The content on Weibo’s hot search naturally radiated its influence. For a time, the content of the annual meeting of paradise Corporation appeared on all the platforms such as today’s headlines, Tianya forum, Mao PU forum, Phoenix News, and so on.

Xia ruofei had no intention of hyping up the content of the annual meeting. In his opinion, everyone had worked hard for a year, and the Spring Festival was coming soon. It was very normal and necessary to show some sincerity to everyone.

However, the peach blossom company once again ignited the hot topic of public opinion, which was unexpected. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Xia ruofei sent Feng Jing and pang Hao back to the dormitory and returned to the small villa. Just as he was about to take a shower, change his clothes, and go to bed, Feng Jing called.

“Sister che, don’t tell me you’re going to talk about the dividends?” Xia ruofei smiled as soon as he picked up the phone.”I’m telling you, there’s no room for discussion! I’ve already decided!”

“I can’t be bothered to tell you!” Feng Rao said, pouting. It’s a good thing to have money!”

“Then why are you looking for me?”

“I can tell you don’t know anything!” Feng Jing chuckled on the other end of the phone.”I suggest you turn on your computer and go to the Banyan Tree forum to take a look ... Or you can just scroll through Weibo’s Trending Searches on your phone!”

“What’s the situation?” Xia ruofei asked in confusion.

“You’ll know when you see it!” Feng Rao said with a mischievous smile before hanging up the phone.

“Why are you being so mysterious?”

Xia ruofei mumbled to himself as he opened the Weibo APP on his phone. After clicking on the hot search list, he scanned it from top to bottom and couldn’t help but exclaim,””What the hell!”
