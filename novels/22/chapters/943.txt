Chapter 944: Super courteous reception (1)

Translator: 549690339

Brodie’s phone call was naturally from his father, Robinson.

On the phone, Robinson was scolding Brody in a fit of rage. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Just like Zheng Peng’s father, Robinson had just received a call from the Maya Group. The representative from the Maya Group informed him emotionlessly that they would take down all the wine from the Golden Oak winery.

This wasn’t the worst. After all, the Golden Oak winery was a large business. In addition to the domestic market in Australia, it also had some export business. Even if it was affected by the comprehensive suppression of the domestic channels, it was not in a desperate situation.

However, after Robinson’s call with the Maya Group, he immediately received calls from two companies that had overseas trade cooperation with the Golden Oak winery. They both mercilessly terminated all cooperation with the Golden Oak winery.

To make matters worse, the calls from the bank came one after another, demanding Robinson to recover the two loans that were about to expire.

In the past, Robinson would have been able to deal with it easily. He just needed to use the money from domestic and international trade to make a turnover. He had always maintained a good relationship with the bank, so even if he had some cash flow problems, it would not be a problem to extend the deadline for a few days.

But now, the bank had no room for negotiation. They said that if the money was not returned by the time limit, they would have to go through legal procedures and auction off the mortgaged assets of the Golden Oak winery.

Whether it was the Maya Group, the bank, or the overseas trading company, all of them had mentioned a piece of information over the phone. That was, Robinson’s son, Brody, had offended the chairman of the Maya Group, Ethan. This is Mr. Tang’s punishment for Tang Hao, the most distinguished guest of Tang.

Robinson felt as if the end of the world had arrived. He called his son Brody to ask about the situation.

Brodie miserably explained what had just happened. When Robinson heard that the Chinese man who had bought West Winery was actually Tang Yitian’s friend, his heart sank to the bottom.

After being defeated at the West Winery last time, Robinson had been thinking about how to suppress the West Winery these days! He didn’t expect that the other party would make the first move before he could.

And such a fierce means at the start, it was simply going to make the Golden Oak winery go bankrupt!

Robinson was no longer in the mood to chat with Brody. He sternly ordered him to return to the winery, as there were still a lot of things waiting for him to deal with.

Brodie and Zheng Peng left the hotel banquet hall in a daze.

The other farm owners and winery owners in the Hunter Valley area who were at the reception saw the scene with their own eyes. Although they could not hear what was said on the phone, they could guess what had happened from Brodie and Zheng Peng’s words and expressions.

In particular, the words “taken down” and “bank” could provoke their sensitive nerves.

It had only been ten minutes since Xia ruofei left the banquet hall and the two of them received the call. The two large – scale wineries were suddenly facing a disaster.

Even the connections of banks and overseas trading companies were mobilized to strike down the Golden Oak winery.

This made the farm owners and winery owners respect Xia ruofei even more.

It wasn’t easy for even Tang Yitian to launch such a lightning attack in such a short time. He could use so many connections in such a short time to avenge Xia ruofei, which showed how noble Xia ruofei was in his heart.

They had all heard Brody’s words and knew that Xia ruofei was the owner of the West Winery. Thus, they all secretly reminded themselves to maintain a good relationship with the West Winery and to restrain their men so that their subordinates wouldn’t offend the West Winery.

Brodie was not far from Zheng Peng!

At this time, the person – in – charge of the Maya Group’s Hunter Valley area, Anthony, received a call. He answered the call with a respectful expression, then immediately walked up to the stage and picked up the microphone.

“Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Tang Hu said that the Honorable Mr. Xia doesn’t want tonight’s incident to be publicized, and he doesn’t want you to disturb him at the West Winery. I think you should know what to do!” Anthony said.

Anthony had a friendly smile on his face when he said this, but his eyes were extremely sharp. He scanned the crowd from left to right, and everyone could not help but avoid his gaze.

“Mr. Anthony, don’t worry. We will keep our mouths shut!”

“We understand what to do. The Honorable Mr. Xia will not be disturbed ...”

Everyone expressed their opinions, and Anthony nodded in satisfaction as he walked off the stage. He picked up a glass of wine from the waiter’s tray and raised his glass to everyone.”Alright, gentlemen, the interlude is over. Now, everyone can freely communicate ...”

……

In the lounge next to the banquet hall, Tang Hu whispered something in Tang Yitian’s ear. Tang Yitian nodded and told Xia ruofei about how they had handled the two wineries.

“Thank you for your help, Mr. Tang,” Xia ruofei nodded with a smile.

“Mr. Xia, you’re being too serious,” Tang Yitian quickly said.”It’s just a small matter for me. It’s our honor to be able to help you solve a small problem!”

Tang Hu’s expression also turned cold. He could feel Tang Yitian’s respect for Xia ruofei from the bottom of his heart. He couldn’t help but feel a great disturbance in his heart. It had been many years since he had seen Tang Yitian maintain such a respectful attitude towards a young man.

In fact, Tang Yitian’s position in the Yixing society was also very high. Even when he saw the big shots of the Yixing society and the overseas Hong sect, he still maintained a bit of reservation.

What was so special about this ordinary – looking young man that made fifth uncle value him so much? Tang Hu was also puzzled.

Xia ruofei smiled.”By the way, Mr. Tang, let me introduce you. This is my good friend, Liang Qichao. He’s also the person in charge of Paradise Farm.”

Then, Xia ruofei said to Liang Qichao,””Brother Liang, you don’t need me to introduce Mr. Tang to you, do you?”

“No, no!” Liang Qichao quickly said. Mr. Tang’s name is well – known in Australia. Who doesn’t know about him?”

“President Liang, you’re too kind. Nice to meet you!” Tang Yitian said with a smile.

Liang Qichao felt like he was in a dream. Before this, he was still working hard to establish a relationship with the person in charge of the Maya Group’s Hunter Valley area for the sales channels of Paradise Farm. He did not expect that in the blink of an eye, he would be able to have a good chat with the chairman of the Maya Group, the legendary figure of the Australian retail industry, Tang Yitian.

Liang Qichao thought that Xia ruofei was amazing. Not only did he have a lot of power in China, but he also knew such a powerful person in Australia. This powerful person even treated him with respect.

Even though he had thought about it for many years, Liang Qichao still said enthusiastically,””You’re too kind, Mr. Tang. You can just call me Xiao Liang. ”

“You’re Mr. Xia’s friend, so I don’t dare to be arrogant. “Tang Yitian said seriously. But I’m a few years older than you, so I’ll call you Qi Chao!”

“Alright, alright, that’s a good name.” Liang Qichao quickly said.

Although Xia ruofei didn’t say anything, Tang Yitian still turned to Tang Hu and said,”Tiger, pass down the order. From now on, Paradise Farm and ...”

Speaking of this, Tang Yitian looked at Xia ruofei and asked with a smile,””Mr. Xia, I just heard them say that you’ve bought a winery in the past few days? I wonder if it’s convenient for you to tell me the name of the winery?”

Xia ruofei laughed.”Of course it’s convenient. It’s called West Winery. I’ll be counting on you to take care of me in the future, Big Boss Tang!”

“I’m flattered, I’m flattered. It’s my honor to be able to serve you!”Tang Yitian quickly said.

Tang Yitian continued to speak to Tang Hu,”Tiger, from now on, the products of Paradise Farm and West Winery must be displayed in the most prominent positions in all of our stores!”

“I understand! I’ll immediately give the order!” Tang Hu said seriously.

“Mr. Tang, Paradise Farm is experimenting with our company’s new vegetables,” Xia ruofei quickly said.”I’m also preparing to improve the grape variety after acquiring West Winery, so for the time being, we’re not ready to put our products on the market on a large scale ...”

He had introduced Liang Qichao to Tang Yitian only because he was thinking about the large – scale planting of paradise vegetables in the future. He didn’t expect that Tang Yitian would directly order Tang Hu to leave the most prominent shelves in their supermarket for the products of Paradise Farm and West Winery.

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. Tang Yitian valued him too much ...

“Mr. Xia,” Tang Yitian said with a smile,”Paradise Farm and West Winery must be selling their products now, right? Display it in the best position in our supermarket first, and it’s also to build a good reputation for future large – scale sales!”

“That’s right, Mr. Xia. When your company is ready to launch the products on a large scale, let us know at any time. Our supermarket will plan a few promotional activities to cooperate with the promotion. You can rest assured that all the promotion costs will be covered by our supermarket!”

Tang Yitian looked at Tang Hu with appreciation and nodded.”Tiger is right. When the time comes, all of Australia’s Maya supermarkets will hold a National promotion event. Your brand will definitely be famous!”

“Mr. Tang, how can I accept this?” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“It’s my pleasure, Mr. Xia is our family’s benefactor!” Tang Yitian quickly said,”to us, it’s just a small matter within our capabilities. It’s not worth mentioning.”

Liang Qichao felt like his brain was not working properly. How was this a small matter? Occupying the best shelves in Maya before the large – scale launch, and having to carry out a National promotion in the future, with the cost of the promotion being borne by the supermarket, even the top – tier brands in Australia did not have such treatment!

Did RUO Fei give Tang Yitian a spell? This was the only real thought in Liang Qichao’s mind.
