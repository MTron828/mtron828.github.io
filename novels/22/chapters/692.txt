Chapter 693: Spatial herb garden (3)

“Everything is normal!” Feng Jing said,”the expansion project will be completed in about a week. Our company’s account has sufficient funds, so it won’t be a problem to pay for the project.”

“That’s good!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I have to prepare the seeds in advance! With so many vegetable greenhouses, the supply of seeds would have to keep up!”

“Yes! Cao tieshu has already looked for me, but you have always been personally in charge of the matter of the seeds, so I told him to wait for you to come back. ” Feng ke said.

“Don’t worry! There’s no time to delay!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Also, after the expansion of the farm is completed, there will be a shortage of manpower in the greenhouse.” Feng Rao said,”I have already asked Cao tieshu to release the news of the recruitment. They are mainly recruiting people from their village. Now, many villagers have signed up. Everyone is very enthusiastic!”

“That’s for sure!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”the exemplary effect of Cao tieshu’s batch of workers is amazing! Everyone in the village is envious of their current income and welfare!”

Xia ruofei was not going to care about the recruitment. He was only going to recruit a few greenhouse workers. He was going to be the hands – off manager and let Feng Jing take care of it. He would let Cao tieshu take charge of the specific matters.

After all, Cao tieshu was the one who used and managed the recruitment. Moreover, if he delegated the appropriate authority, Cao tieshu would have more prestige in the village. At the same time, his loyalty to the company would naturally increase.

Next, Xia ruofei asked about the preliminary review of the new medicine, which he was most concerned about.

Feng Jing told Xia ruofei that the provincial Food and Drug Administration was very efficient in the preliminary examination of the heart – nourishing soup. The preliminary examination process had already started on the second day after Xue Jinshan’s return.

Moreover, he kun, the Deputy Director of the Food and Drug Administration, had personally come forward to coordinate with the provincial health and planning Commission to arrange Peking Union Medical College Hospital, which was more authoritative in the field of child neurosurgery, to be the Clinical Trial Unit.

At present, Peking Union Medical College Hospital was selecting suitable test subjects and control groups in accordance with the requirements of the clinical trial. They were preparing to conduct the first phase of the clinical trial in a double – blind situation.

The so – called double – blind test was to divide the test subjects into an experimental group and a control group. They would take the experimental drug, the control drug, or a placebo drug respectively. The researchers and the test subject would not know which group the test subject was assigned to or what drug he took.

......

“What a fast progress!” Xia ruofei said in surprise.

“Who said it wasn ‘t?” Feng Jing said,”according to the regulations, the first review must be done through a technical review, and then an on – site inspection of the trial – Production environment. The samples must also be tested. These links have not been completed yet! We haven’t even prepared the drugs for the clinical trials ...”

After the establishment of the pharmaceutical company, they did not have their own pharmaceutical factory, so what Feng Jing said was naturally impossible. The drugs used in Xia ruofei’s own experiments were all made by Xia ruofei at the last minute. Xia ruofei had been in Beijing these days, so Xue Jinshan naturally could not make heart – nourishing soup.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it seems that our work is lagging behind!” President Feng, you have to speed up the progress on your side. How’s the inspection coming along these days? He had to buy a pharmaceutical factory as soon as possible! We still have to make adjustments to the production line, fix the production process, reset the parameters, and so on. Finally, we still have to carry out a trial production for a period of time. If we don’t speed it up, I’m afraid that even the progress of the clinical trials will be affected. ”

“I already have my eyes on the two pharmaceutical factories,” Feng Jing said.”I’ve also made some preliminary contact with them. I’m just waiting for you to come back and make the final decision!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”then what are we waiting for?” Now, please tell me about the situation! Let’s go to the meeting room and call Xue Jinshan and the others!”
