Ling Qingxue glanced at Xia ruofei with a half – Smile and said,””Ruofei, I didn’t expect you to have hidden it so deeply!” “Youyou, what illness did Xia ruofei cure you of?” Ling Qingxue asked. Lu You’s pretty face could not help but blush. However, she looked at Jiang Yue and then at Xia ruofei. She suppressed her embarrassment and said,””It’s just that aunty hurts! His medicine is very effective. After drinking it, I don’t feel pain anymore. And this month ... I don’t feel pain at all!” “Youyou ...” Jiang Yue’s face was as red as a ripened Apple. She tugged at Lu You’s sleeve, trying to stop her from continuing, but Lu You still finished her sentence in one breath. Ling Qingxue was stunned after she heard what Xia ruofei had to say. After a long while, she turned to look at Xia ruofei and walked to his side. She held his arm and said in a sweet voice,””RUO Fei, I didn’t expect you to be able to ... Cure this kind of illness. You’re amazing!” The muscles on Xia ruofei’s face couldn’t help but tremble. Because Ling Qingxue’s sweet voice seemed to be filled with murderous intent. In fact, it was so. Ling Qingxue’s fair hand grabbed a little soft flesh on the inside of Xia ruofei’s arm and pinched it hard. Xia ruofei gasped in pain. This girl was too ruthless! Xia ruofei cried in his heart. The flesh on his arm had probably turned black! Xia ruofei could only bear with the pain and force a smile. He smiled and said,””That ... I happen to have a folk prescription passed down from my ancestors. It’s very effective for that ... That disease, so I tried to make some medicine for Lu You ...” Lu You had actually noticed Ling Qingxue’s small actions. A hint of a smile flashed across her eyes. Then, she smiled sweetly at Xia ruofei and said,””Xia ruofei, Yueyue is my best friend. She’s in pain every month just like me. Please help her!” Xia ruofei was a little dazed. Three women made a show, and this matter seemed to have completely gone out of control. Even if he was very capable, his mind was in a mess. He only came back to his senses when Ling Qingxue pinched him again.””Ah? What?” Ling Qingxue looked at Xia ruofei with a half – Smile and said,””Great Divine Doctor! Youyou asked you to prescribe some medicine for Yueyue! Why are you in a daze?” “Oh, then ...” Xia ruofei looked at Ling Qingxue hesitantly and said,”I’ll drive a little ...” Hiss ... Ling Qingxue pinched him again without a trace. “Then I’d better not open it ...” Xia ruofei said with a bitter smile. Hiss ... Another one. Xia ruofei couldn’t help but cry,””Should I ... Open it or not?” Jiang Yue looked at Xia ruofei with pity and said softly,””Brother Xia, don’t be so hard on me. I ... Don’t need to take any medicine.” “Youyou, let’s go back first!” Jiang Yue said to Lu You. Lu You didn’t want to leave at first, but when she saw the pleading look in Jiang Yue’s eyes, she couldn’t help but sigh and nod silently. Just as the two of them were about to turn around and leave, Ling Qingxue smiled and said,””Don’t go! My two little Sisters, you’ve just arrived! Why are you leaving?” Then, Ling Qingxue nudged Xia ruofei and said,””What are you still doing? Hurry up and prepare the medicine for Yueyue!” Xia ruofei came back to his senses and quickly nodded.””Oh, Okay, okay, okay ...” “Do you have any medicinal herbs at home? Do you want to drive outside to buy some?” Ling Qingxue asked. “Yes, yes, yes, I’ll be done very soon!” Xia ruofei said. With that, Xia ruofei turned around and walked back to the villa. “Big brother Xia, there’s really no need ...” Jiang Yue called out from behind him. Ling Qingxue walked over with a smile and held onto Jiang Yue’s arm,””Yueyue, why are you being so polite with your brother Xia? Don’t worry about him, just let him prepare the medicine! Didn’t you guys want to visit the farm? I’ll Take You There, let’s go!” Xia ruofei was already at the entrance of the villa when he heard Ling Qingxue’s words. He could not help but stop in his tracks. When he turned back, he saw that the three girls were already walking hand in hand towards the farm outside the villa. Xia ruofei couldn’t help but Pat his forehead and smile bitterly. What the hell is this! Ye Lingyun and Li Zhifu, who were not far away, had also stopped their lessons. The old and the young looked at Xia ruofei with sympathy. Even lightning, who was lying by ye Lingyun’s feet, seemed to be smiling with its bright eyes. Of course, this was just Xia ruofei’s illusion. He shook his head helplessly and smiled awkwardly at li Zhifu and ye Lingyun. Then, he walked into the mansion. Xia ruofei went to the kitchen and locked the door. He took out some Chinese herbs from the medium and started to brew the Chinese medicine according to the prescription for period conditioning. In fact, the flower petal solution was the most effective. Xia ruofei could have used something like herbal tea to make a bottle of “Chinese medicine” for Jiang Yue. However, Xia ruofei really did not want to go out and face the situation that was giving him a headache. He simply hid in the kitchen and slowly brewed the medicine. He dawdled for more than half an hour before he finally divided the medicinal soup with the flower petal solution into six portions and put them in sealed Chinese medicine bags. Then, Xia ruofei took the two days ‘worth of Chinese medicine and walked out of the kitchen with a face that looked like he was ready to die. His hearing was far beyond that of ordinary people. He had long heard the sound of Ling Qingxue, Lu You, and Jiang Yue returning to the villa.
