After hearing Li Yifu’s words, mark nodded.

He bowed slightly to Li Yifu and said,””Mr. Li, according to your instructions, I started the investigation immediately. According to the initial information we received, Mr. Elonmask went to Los Angeles ... He has a mansion in Los Angeles. According to reliable sources, he urgently returned to the mansion this time ...”

“This should be an unplanned arrangement,” Li Yifu said lightly.”Have you found the reason why he rushed to Los Angeles?”

Mark respectfully said,”it hasn’t been long, so the information I got isn’t very accurate. But what I can be sure of is that his sudden departure from Silicon Valley has something to do with his newborn child. It should be that the child has some serious health problems. We are still trying to find out the specific situation, but you know, the medical information of rich families is highly confidential. It will be quite difficult to find out the exact information.”

After saying that, mark quickly handed over the briefcase and said,”The specific information is here, please take a look!”

Li Yifu took the briefcase and nodded,””Well done! Ma ke, continue to understand the specific situation. If there is any news, remember to inform me immediately!”

“Understood!” Ma ke said.

Li Yifu took out a check from his shirt pocket and handed it to mark. He then said indifferently,””Thank you for your hard work! If you can get more useful information, the reward will definitely not disappoint you!”

Mark quickly glanced at the amount on the check, and his eyes revealed a trace of joy. He was full of energy.

He said,”don’t worry!” Dear Mr. Li, our law firm is the best in the United States! I’ll definitely be able to complete your Commission!”

“Mm! Then you can go!” Li Yifu said.

Mark nodded and bowed slightly to Xia ruofei and the rest. Then, he left the room without a sound.

Li Yifu and mark conversed in English, but Xia ruofei and the rest could understand.

Xia ruofei’s English was good enough for a normal conversation. Song Wei and Ling Qingxue’s English was not bad either. Yu xiner had lived in the secular world for many years and even had a postgraduate degree. She had no problem communicating in simple English.

On the other hand, Chen Xuan had never studied English before. He had only picked up some English for the sake of convenience when he was learning computer related knowledge. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Therefore, out of the few of them, Chen Xuan was the only one who had a rough idea of what was going on. The rest, including Yu xiner, had already understood the situation.

After mark left the room, Li Yifu immediately said to Xia ruofei respectfully,””Martial granduncle! The situation isn’t very clear yet, but the information provided by mark is definitely correct. His Detective Agency has a high reputation in the industry. ”

Xia ruofei replied,”yes!” If that’s the case, it seems like elonmask really left in a hurry because of his family matters. ”

Xia ruofei thought of what mark had said and suddenly had an idea. He asked,”Foster husband, do you know this son of Elon Musk?”

Li Yifu said,”I’ve really learned about it in the past two days. After all, it’s best to know your enemy and yourself if you want to negotiate with him!” This son of Elon Musk was born a few months ago, and his girlfriend is a Canada pop singer, grams, who is seventeen years younger than him!”

Xia ruofei said,”F * ck!” An old cow eating young grass! It seems that this Mr. Mersk is also a Playboy!”

Li Yifu laughed and said,”this guy has two ex – wives. One of them got married, got divorced, got remarried, and got divorced again. It took quite a long time. Well ... He should have more girlfriends. After all, he has a good image. Most importantly, he’s rich!”

“Amazing ...” Xia ruofei said casually.

Ling Qingxue glanced at Xia ruofei and said,””You seem to be quite envious of him!”

Xia ruofei could not help but feel a chill. He turned around and saw Song Wei and Ling Qingxue staring at him with unfriendly eyes. He laughed dryly and said,”I was just saying! I look down on people who go around womanizing just because they have a bit of money! Why would I be envious of him?”

“Hehe!” Song Wei and Ling Qingxue laughed in unison.

Xia ruofei was a little embarrassed and quickly changed the topic.””Foster husband, this Elon Mask must be around 40 to 50 years old, right?”

“I think I’m 48 years old this year!” Li Yifu said.

“That’s barely considered having a child at an old age!” Xia ruofei said,”he must be very concerned about this son of his!”

Li Yifu thought for a while and said,”it’s definitely true that he has a child at an old age, but this isn’t his first child.” He and his first wife had five children ...”

“Ah?” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but exclaim,”this guy can give birth so well?”

“Test – Tube baby!” Li Yifu smiled and said,”to be exact, he and his first wife had a total of six children, but the first child died not long after birth due to sudden death syndrome. After that, he seemed to believe that science could bring him healthy children, so he wanted a pair of twins through test – Tube baby technology. Later on, he might have thought that this method was quite good, so he wanted triplets! So, out of the five children, she actually had two!”

Li Yifu had obviously done his homework, and was very familiar with the situation of Elon Musk.

Xia ruofei nodded thoughtfully and said,””This guy has so many children. Now that his newborn son has health problems, he still left a lot of work and rushed back. It seems like he cares a lot about his child ...”

Li Yifu nodded and said,”at least from the information in the public report, Elon Musk should be considered a good father!” He worked more than 100 hours a week, but even if he was overwrought, he still insisted on staying at home every weekend to play with his child. He also took time to take his child on a trip. I remember that when he visited China a few years ago, he even brought the child with him. In order to take care of the child more conveniently, even his ex – wife accompanied him to China. ”

Li Yifu paused again and continued,””In addition, he often posts on his social media about the gifts his child gave him and so on. He also takes his child to his company. What’s more, he felt that the schools in the United States were far from reaching his standards, so he set up a school for five children ...”

Hearing this, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but click his tongue and said,””As expected, the rich can do whatever they want! However, from the public disclosure of this information, he did care about his child. Of course, we can’t rule out the possibility that it’s a character setting ...”

“I don’t think so!” Li Yifu smiled and shook his head. With masker’s wealth and status, he didn’t need to set up any character! Moreover, he had always been a forthright person, so he would not deliberately create an image of a good father for the public when it came to the issue of children. Martial granduncle, this disciple feels that this should be a more genuine expression. ”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,””If that’s the case, we might be able to find a breakthrough from his child!”

Li Yifu was shocked. He hesitated for a moment, but he still couldn’t help but say carefully,””Martial granduncle, this ... I’m afraid it’s not very appropriate! As the saying goes, the wife and children should not be implicated. His children were innocent! Besides, he didn’t do anything wrong. He just didn’t want to trade with us because of various concerns. ”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry,”adopted husband, what kind of person do you think I am?” Do I look like that kind of brutal person?”

Li Yifu quickly stood up and said in fear,””Martial granduncle, this disciple deserves to die! This disciple is so slow – witted, I shouldn’t have guessed martial granduncle’s thoughts so carelessly, please forgive me, martial granduncle!”

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly.”I’m just joking. It’s my fault for not making it clear. That’s why there’s a misunderstanding.” Sit down first, then we’ll talk!”

“Yes!” Li Yifu sat down uneasily.

Xia ruofei said,”I mean, doesn’t his newborn child have serious health problems?” Maybe we can help him. In exchange, he’ll help us out a little. Isn’t that logical?”
