Chapter 476: A roundabout strategy (3)

Although she knew that Xia ruofei was just teasing her, Lu You still felt very good about it.

She couldn’t help but smile and said,””Didn’t you say you would treat me to a meal alone? It’s been so many days and you still haven’t contacted me. Aren’t you being too insincere?”

Xia ruofei was stunned. He looked at his watch and said with a bitter smile,””Miss Lu, it’s not mealtime yet, is it? Don’t tell me you haven’t eaten yet?”

“What time is it already! How could you not have eaten?” Lu You said in a bad mood,”I’m looking for you for something else. Where are you? It seems to be quite noisy nearby ...”

“Oh, I’m at the Jade Market.” Xia ruofei said casually,”I told you not to come here for no reason! What’s the matter ...”

“We’ll talk when we meet! I’m coming over now!” Lu You said. Then, she hung up the phone.

Actually, Qin Xiao Yu’s matter could be explained in a few sentences over the phone, but Lu You did not do so. Especially when she knew that Xia ruofei was in the city as well, she decided to meet him without hesitation.

Xia ruofei was confused. He didn’t know what this miss Lu was up to this time. However, it wasn’t good for him to call back and ask. Besides, there was nothing else to see in this Jade Market. Hence, he decided to go back and wait for Lu You at the entrance.

After about ten minutes, he saw Lu You’s BMW MINI.

Actually, Lu You had already seen Xia ruofei from afar. Her heart started to race against her will. After taking a deep breath, she slowly parked the car beside Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei opened the car door and sat inside. He smiled and asked,””What’s the rush?”

“It’s a good thing!” Lu You said,”I heard that you helped the Public Security Bureau catch a fugitive?”

Xia ruofei was surprised and said,”eh?” You sure are well – informed! You’ll know about it an hour or two ago!”

Lu You raised her chin proudly and said,””I have inside information!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.”Qin Xiao Yu told you, right? Speak! Why did she come in such a big circle to find me? Don’t tell me you’re giving me a bonus!”

Lu You couldn’t help but widen her eyes. She turned to look at Xia ruofei and said,””How ... How did you know?”

This time, it was Xia ruofei’s turn to be shocked. He said,””They’re really giving me a bonus! What the hell ... When did the Public Security Bureau become so efficient? Under normal circumstances, they are always the last to arrive at the scene!”

“It’s not as bad as you say!” Lu You couldn’t help but roll her eyes at Xia ruofei and said,”sister Xiaoyu doesn’t have your contact information, so she asked me to tell you to contact the Public Security Bureau’s publicity department tomorrow. They will arrange for you to receive the award.”

“Oh, okay.”

Lu You then asked curiously,””Xia ruofei, did you really help them catch the fugitive? Tell me! The Public Security Bureau has given you a reward, so this fugitive must not be simple, right?”

“That’s true!” Xia ruofei immediately made up a story.”When I was walking on the road today, I could tell that that guy wasn’t a good person. I think we’re good citizens! It’s also my duty to maintain Social Security, right? So I followed him to see what was going on. I didn’t expect that the fugitive would actually become suspicious and turn around to attack me! Hehe ... You know how good I am. I subdued him without any effort and beat him until he knelt down and begged for mercy! After that, your sister Xiaoyu appeared. After some investigation, I found out that this guy is not a good person. He is actually a wanted criminal! The police officers were extremely grateful! You’re not even letting go of my hand ...”

As Lu You listened, she could not help but cover her mouth and laugh. She knew that Xia ruofei was just spouting nonsense. The real situation would not be so exaggerated.

However, she did not expect that the process of Xia ruofei subduing Zhao he was even more exaggerated than he had described. If it was someone else, they might really have been crippled by Zhao he.

However, she would listen to whatever Xia ruofei said. Anyway, as long as she listened to Xia ruofei, she would feel happy.

“Oh right, what are you doing at the Jade Market?” Lu You asked.
