Translator: 549690339

Tang Wei Ran’s eyes flashed and her expression became serious.

Could it be that something bad had happened to the chain companies?

Normally, the chain companies were under Wei Jianming’s control, and they were under Tang weiran’s charge. If he really wanted to burn his past three fires, he wouldn’t do it to the chain companies!

Wei Jianming saw Tang weiran’s expression and immediately knew what he was thinking.

Wei Jianming smiled kindly and said,”Wei Ran, don’t be nervous. It’s like this ...”

Then, Wei Jianming repeated what he had learned to Tang weiran, and then said with a serious expression,””Wei Ran, this Mr. Xia is not an ordinary person. His background is far beyond our imagination. So, if this matter is not handled well, it may even bring a lot of trouble to the whole group!”

“Also...Putting aside Mr. Xia’s identity,” he said seriously,”in our chain company’s business strategy, high – end Chinese medicinal herbs that represent our brand image are very important. Under normal circumstances, even if we have to pay a certain premium, we must get this high – Quality Cordyceps!”

Wei Jianming took a sip of water and continued to speak with a dark expression,”What is this purchasing manager called Chen shun doing? Was he not capable enough, not sensitive enough, or ... Was he deliberately going against the company’s strategy? What is his intention?”

Wei Jianming’s tone had already turned cold when he said the last few words.

These words were already a little harsh.

Tang Wei Ran’s forehead was covered in sweat. He said carefully,””President Wei, this matter is indeed very serious, but we still don’t know enough about the situation. Should we investigate it in detail?”

Wei Jianming didn’t know Chen shun well, but as the head of the chain company, Tang weiran knew him. After all, Chen shun’s uncle, Chen Weinan, was the Vice President of the chain company. He was a member of the chain company’s leadership team, so he had a lot of opportunities to deal with Tang weiran directly.

However, Tang weiran didn’t have a good relationship with Chen Weinan. On the contrary, Chen Weinan was close to another vice President of the group. In many businesses of the chain company, he had caused a lot of constraints to Tang weiran.

If she could use this incident to get rid of Chen Weinan, Tang weiran would be more than happy to do so.

At the very least, he could knock on the mountain to scare the Tiger.

Therefore, Tang weiran didn’t shirk her responsibility, nor did she plead for Chen shun. Instead, she suggested a detailed investigation of the matter. This was the rhythm of a serious investigation.

Wei Jianming was very satisfied with Tang weiran’s attitude.

He gently nodded and said,””An investigation will definitely be carried out, and those that need to be dealt with must be dealt with seriously! However, the most important thing now is not to find out who is responsible. ”

Wei Jianming paused and continued,”Right now, the Paradise Corporation is ready to completely terminate their cooperation with our Tongren Tang ...”

Tang Wei Ran was also shocked and said,””It’s that serious? If I remember correctly, the quality of this company’s iron – skinned fengdou is very good, and the supply is very stable. In the internal rating of the chain company, this company has a very high weight. It’s just that they have been working with the Qiantang store before, so not many people in the group know about it. ”

Tang Wei Ran swallowed her saliva and continued,””We’ve already formed a certain brand effect by selling paradise brand’s Ironhide Kaede fight on our behalf. We’ve gathered many high – end customers with strong spending power. If we stop all cooperation, we’ll suffer a huge loss!”

Wei Jianming’s face darkened.”That’s not all. According to a reliable source, the other party might turn to seek cooperation with the year of the crane Hall. Wei Ran, if this matter really comes to this, it will be a heavy blow to the chain companies, and even the entire group!”

“Yeah!” Tang Wei Ran’s face slightly changed. President Wei, we must try our best to keep this business partner!”

Wei Jianming nodded and said,”Wei Ran, this is also the reason why I asked you to come here today. You don’t have to worry too much. I’ve also negotiated with some people on my side. The other party will not contact the year of the crane Hall for the time being. As long as we lower our stance and show our sincerity in cooperating, it is very likely that paradise Corporation will stay as a business partner.” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“President Wei, I got it. I’ll handle it myself!” Tang Wei Ran nodded.

“That’s what I meant,”Wei Jianming nodded. Go to the Chinese Medicine Research Institute and ask for an experienced researcher to accompany you. Book an afternoon flight to San Shan city immediately. I don’t think I need to teach you the specifics, do I?”

“Understood!” Tang Wei Ran nodded. As long as the quality of the other party’s aweto is above the standard, we will buy it at a premium! Don’t worry, President Wei, I’ll definitely humble myself and apologize sincerely!”

Wei Jianming nodded in satisfaction and said, “That’s what I meant! In addition, investigate Chen shun at the same time. Arrange for someone you trust to do it! It’s best if you can come up with a preliminary solution when you’re negotiating with the Paradise Corporation at San Shan!”

“Alright!” Tang Wei Ran nodded.

“Wei Ran, when you’re dealing with Mr. Xia, you must be polite. We can’t afford to offend him ...” Wei Jianming couldn’t help but remind her again.
