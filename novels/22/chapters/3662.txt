Xia ruofei chuckled.’This ceremony is a big event for the first heaven society. Sect leader Chen won’t be able to leave. As the young sect leader, you must be busy with a lot of things. Do you still have time to drink with me?”

Chen Xuan laughed and said,”the specific matters are handled by the disciples below. The important guests that I need to personally welcome have basically all arrived. The others are the sect leaders of the first heaven society’s subsidiary sects or some mid – tier sects. Let the elders handle them!”

At this point, Chen Xuan added,”that’s right. This time, we’ve also invited Valley master Liu of the soaring Flower Valley. She has already arrived at the first heavenly sect this morning. I was the one who personally went to welcome her.” Valley master Liu only brought one disciple to observe, and he’s an old acquaintance of yours!”

“Oh?” Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows and asked,”Yu xiner?”

Xia ruofei only knew three cultivators from the soaring Flower Valley. They were the valley Head, Liu Mansha, elder Yang Liu, and Liu Mansha’s personal disciple, Yu xiner. Since Liu Mansha had only brought one disciple with her and Chen Xuan had claimed to be an old acquaintance of Xia ruofei, the answer was obvious. It could not be anyone else but Yu xiner.

“That’s right! “Chen Xuan chuckled. Brother RUO Fei, fairy Yu is about the same age as you, and you’re both from prestigious families. If there’s a chance, you can exchange more information. Although the cultivators of the flying flower Valley don’t have any interest in male cultivators, fairy Yu has always been kind to you, and 1 can see that she also admires you!”

Xia ruofei laughed bitterly,”brother Chen, don’t randomly match a couple!” I already have two Dao – companions, and I’m currently engrossed in cultivation. I have no interest in the relationship between men and women.” “You don’t have to become Dao companions! It’s not a bad idea to be friends!” Chen Xuan chuckled.”! think that fairy Yu … Might have already fallen in love with you at first sight!”

“Don’t make such a joke!” Xia ruofei quickly said,”the female cultivators of the flying flower Valley never get too close to men. If they hear it, it will cause a commotion! You’re the young sect master of the first heaven society, and they’re all your guests. It won’t be good if something unpleasant happens.” Chen Xuan thought about it and felt that Xia ruofei’s words made sense. He smiled and said,””I was just joking! I originally wanted to take you to visit Valley master Liu, but since you’ve said so, let’s forget it…”

“It’s better to avoid trouble.” Xia ruofei said,”I’ll definitely see him at the ceremony tomorrow anyway. I’ll just go over and say hello.”

“That makes sense!” Chen Xuan smiled and said,”let’s go! Brother RUO Fei, I’ll take you to your residence to settle down!”

Chen Xuan led Xia ruofei along the mountain path and arrived at a small courtyard.

This courtyard was similar to the one that Mu Sheng and mu Jianfei had just been assigned to. Although the layout was basically the same, the environment seemed to be better, and the location was also more superior. It happened to be at a prominent position on the hillside, and standing in the courtyard, one could overlook half of the first heaven Gate.

The two of them walked into the courtyard. It was a small siheyuan with two side rooms on each side. In the middle was a large bedroom with the layout of a suite. There was a small courtyard in front of them with stone tables and chairs in the courtyard. Every piece of furniture was exquisitely furnished.

“Brother ruofei, you can stay here for the next few days.” There are service disciples nearby. If you need anything, just tell them!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said casually.

“Then I’ll go do some things first!” Chen Xuan replied,”I’ll come over to have a drink with you this afternoon!”

“If you’re too busy, you don’t have to come personally.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’ll be here for the next few days anyway. When sect leader Chen breaks through successfully, you’ll have more free time.”

“It’s fine. No matter how busy I am, I still have to eat!” Chen Xuan chuckled.”Brother ruofei, you should rest first. We’ll meet at noon!”

After Chen Xuan left, Xia ruofei walked around the small courtyard.

He looked around every room. Familiarizing himself with the environment was secondary. The main thing was that he was worried that there might be some spying array here.

He wasn’t trying to measure a gentleman’s heart with his own mean measure. After all, Chen Nanfeng’s attitude was unclear, and one had to be cautious. It was better to be careful.

Xia ruofei’s spiritual power was equivalent to the spiritual transformation realm of the original infant stage. His array skills were also very high. If there was really a hidden spying array or trap array, it would not be able to escape Xia ruofei’s detection.

He searched very carefully, using his spiritual power to check inch by inch, even the deep underground layers were not missed.

Although this would consume a lot of mental energy, Xia ruofei did not skimp on it and meticulously completed the investigation of the entire courtyard.

The result made him slightly relieved. Everything was normal in the courtyard, and there were no hidden means or formations.

On one hand, he was sure that he was safe. More importantly, there was no formation in this courtyard, which meant that the first heaven society was less likely to suspect him.

Of course, this possibility could not be completely eliminated. Xia ruofei was very afraid of Chen Nanfeng. He felt that this number one cultivator was unfathomable. Sometimes, the methods of such a person were not so easily discovered. They would not just appear on the surface and directly do something to Xia ruofei’s residence..
