2107 Happy decision_1

“Ah? “Ruofei, this price is too expensive ...” Feng Jing blurted out.

The moment she said this, she immediately realized that something was amiss. After all, Ling Xiaotian had only agreed to sell the house because he wanted to give her face. Even though she had not known the average price of the houses in this area beforehand, Ling Qingxue would definitely not lie to her about this. So, saying this in front of Ling Qingxue made it seem very inappropriate.

“Qingxue, don’t misunderstand me,” Feng Jing quickly explained.”I’m not saying that the house is expensive. What I mean is ... I don’t have enough money ...”

“Sister ran, you don’t have to explain. I’m not that petty,” Ling Qingxue said with a smile.

Ling Qingxue then looked at Xia ruofei with a smile and said,””It doesn’t matter if you don’t have enough money! A wild tycoon was here! Just ask him to lend you a little! You’ve been working day and night for his company, how could he not help you with this little favor?”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.”Qingxue, what are you talking about ... What do you mean by a wild tycoon?”

“Don’t tell me you’re raised by your family?” Ling Qingxue chuckled.

“You ...” Xia ruofei was speechless.

It was not a wise choice to argue with a woman, so he decisively shut his mouth.

“It’s fine ... Qingxue, I can’t live in such a big house by myself. It’d be a waste to buy it. “Feng Rao replied awkwardly. I think I’ll go and look for a suitable small apartment ...”

Hearing this, Xia ruofei quickly said,”how can we do that?” You’re the CEO of paradise Corporation, how can you live in a small apartment? Wouldn’t it be embarrassing for our company if this gets out? Sister che, this matter is settled!”

“I ... It’s such a waste for me to live alone in such a big villa.” Feng Rao said weakly.

“Then I’m also alone! Wasn’t the one just now bigger than this?” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”these are not reasons.”

“There are five or six floors in total! I don’t have the time to clean up!”

“That’s even less of a problem! Who in the world cleans their own villas these days?” Xia ruofei chuckled.”Can’t you just contact a housekeeping company and send someone over to clean the house regularly?”

Then, Xia ruofei said,”sister ran, stop finding excuses!” I can see that you’re very satisfied with this house. You just don’t have enough money, right? You can pay 10 million. I’ll help you pay the remaining 3 million. Just consider it a loan from me! Anyway, your annual salary and bonus are already a few million a year. Not to mention that you still have the company’s shares! I’m not afraid that you won’t be able to return it!”

Xia ruofei’s last words were mostly meant for Ling Qingxue. After all, Ling Qingxue was his girlfriend. If he lent three million Yuan to another woman, even if the woman was the most capable subordinate in his company, she would inevitably think too much.

Feng Jing knew that she couldn’t reject Xia ruofei’s offer. Besides, she really liked the house. When she had visited the villa earlier, she had already imagined how it would look after the renovation.

So, Feng Jing thought for a while and finally nodded.””Then ... Okay then ... But you don’t have to lend me that much. Other than the ten million in dividends, I still have some savings ...” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“You can keep the money for now!” Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”don’t you still have to renovate this house after you buy it? It’s such a big villa, it’ll cost a lot to renovate!”

Feng Rao thought that it made sense, so she nodded and said,””Alright! Thank you, ruofei!”

Ling Qingxue giggled and said,”sister ran, you don’t have to be so polite with him!” A few million Yuan was nothing to him! It was really good! After we buy this house, we can be neighbors!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”then it’s decided!” Qingxue, please ask uncle Ling to contact the other party as soon as possible. After the transfer of ownership of this house, sister ran still needs to renovate it!”

“Mm! Just leave it to me!” Ling Qingxue said.

The three of them chatted as they walked towards the Ling family’s Villa. On the way, Ling Qingxue gave Ling Xiaotian a call and told him about the situation with the house viewing.

Before the three of them even reached the Ling family villa, Ling Xiaotian called back.

After Ling Qingxue finished the call, she smiled and said,””Success! Uncle Jiang’s lawyer came back in the afternoon, and he would be able to handle the transfer tomorrow morning! By the way, I have to pay the full amount to uncle Jiang before the transfer. My dad asked if I should find a Guarantee Company as an intermediary. ”

During a real estate transaction, a guarantee account would be opened in the bank. The buyer would transfer the money to the account, and then both parties would go through the transfer procedures. After all the procedures were completed, the buyer would go to the bank for confirmation, and the bank would transfer the money to the seller’s account to ensure the safety of the funds.

Of course, the disadvantage was that the seller could not get the money immediately.

Another way was to find a Guarantee Company to do this. The guarantee Company could pay the seller directly. Once there was any problem with the transfer of the house, such as property rights disputes or the seller’s debts causing the house to be frozen by the court, the buyer would only lose some processing fees, but the funds would not be lost.

And the money paid by the guarantee Company would naturally be asked for by them.

What they earned was the High Commission fees. As for debt collection, those who opened guarantee companies had their own ways. There were endless means of both the black and white sides, so they were not worried that someone would dare to renege on the debt.
