“Of course I’m interested!” Xia ruofei asked excitedly,”old master Ma, when does the truffle tasting auction start?” “The third day of the first month!” MA Xiong said,”the traditional truffle production season in the Alba region of Italy is around November and December, but truffles grow in March. I heard that there will be white truffles of very good quality in this auction. It should be the last truffle auction this season. The next time we want to try it will be at the end of the year! That’s why we can’t miss it!” “Then all the more I want to participate!” Xia ruofei said with a smile. “We’ll arrive at Sanshan city tomorrow. We’ll fly to Shen Cheng the day after tomorrow!” MA Xiong asked,”xiasheng, is your schedule easy to arrange?” “I’m fine with it!” Xia ruofei said without hesitation. “Hahaha! Then I’ll see you tomorrow!” MA Xiong said happily. “See you tomorrow!” After hanging up the phone, Xia ruofei’s mind began to wander. According to the time in the medium, it had been almost a year since the last truffle cultivation. If his method worked and he successfully cultivated a high – Quality truffle, he might be able to make a lot of money from this auction! Even if the truffle was not successfully cultivated, it would still be good to attend the tasting meeting with MA Xiong. The taste of the truffle, especially the alluring fragrance, was still lingering in Xia ruofei’s mind. Xia ruofei didn’t want to wait any longer. He went straight back to the villa and locked the door and windows in his bedroom. After making sure it was safe, he summoned the spirit painting from his palm and entered the medium. He strode to the oak Forest. The oak trees grew very quickly. They were all about 20 centimeters in diameter, and the whole forest was lush. Xia ruofei came to an oak tree and started digging with a shovel. Truffles were actually a type of fungus. They were associated with the roots of oak and beech trees. Hence, if Xia ruofei wanted to find truffles, he had to dig down and find the roots. Truffles produced in winter usually grew half a meter to one meter deep under the soil. Xia ruofei dug a few spots and found the roots. However, he did not find any truffles. When there were no truffles around a meter, he would fill the hole with soil and continue digging in another place. On the fifth time, when Xia ruofei had dug more than 70 centimeters, he suddenly found a black block at the root of the oak tree. He quickly stopped and carefully pushed away the surrounding soil with his hands. Very quickly, a black lump the size of a tennis ball appeared in front of Xia ruofei. He carefully pulled it out and cleaned the dirt on its surface. Its surface was uneven and looked like a pine fruit, but its texture was finer and not as hard as a pine fruit. The most obvious thing was the smell. After digging it out, Xia ruofei smelled a special fragrance. People who liked it would be fascinated by it, and those who didn’t would feel nauseated. Xia ruofei had only touched truffles in Hong Kong previously. Obviously, he was one of the former. Without a doubt, it was a piece of black truffle. Xia ruofei’s mood relaxed. Although this black truffle was of average size and weight, its appearance confirmed one thing – the soil method he used to cultivate truffles previously was effective. Since he had found one, it meant that there were more and better ones underground. On this point, Xia ruofei had an almost superstitious belief in the spirit map space. Moreover, the roots would be infected with truffle fungus, so they would be able to produce truffles continuously in the future. However, Xia ruofei was a little worried. Truffles were half a meter to a meter deep underground. It was too inefficient to dig aimlessly and he might miss a lot. No matter what, Xia ruofei could not accept letting the precious truffles rot underground. He had done some research before. In foreign countries, truffle hunters would bring specially trained truffle dogs to look for truffles. In the early days, some people took sows to search for it, because the hormonal smell of truffles was a fatal temptation to sows. Even if it was buried one meter deep underground, it still could not escape the noses of sows. However, once truffles were found, the sows would dig up the soil with all their might. Many times, The Truffle Hunters were unable to stop them in time, and the precious truffles would be eaten by the sows. As a result, they slowly switched to using specially trained truffle dogs. A better truffle could be sold for thousands of dollars. Xia ruofei thought for a while and decided to let lightning try. Although lightning was not a professional truffle dog, it had absorbed the petals of a strange flower and was more intelligent than ordinary dogs. Its sense of smell must be more sensitive than ordinary dogs. Xia ruofei placed the black truffle in an empty box and left the spirit map space. He didn’t store the painting in his body. Instead, he put it in his pocket. Then, he opened the door and walked to the balcony. He whistled toward the courtyard. Lightning, who was basking in the sun by the wall, heard Xia ruofei’s whistle and immediately stood up. She looked up at the second floor. Xia ruofei beckoned to lightning. Lightning immediately understood and rushed into the villa. It ran up the stairs to the second floor. Xia ruofei opened the door and lightning immediately rushed in. It stood up and pounced on Xia ruofei affectionately. Xia ruofei patted Lightning’s head and said,””Come down, come down. Wait for me to lock the door. I have an important task for you!” Lightning let go of Xia ruofei obediently and lay on the floor. Xia ruofei went over to lock the door and draw the curtains. Then, he took out the spirit map scroll and entered the spirit map space with lightning in his arms. Lightning had been to the spirit map space before, so when it entered and felt the rich spiritual energy, it was very happy. It began to run around Xia ruofei’s feet and wagged its tail at Xia ruofei, expressing its excitement. Xia ruofei smiled and said,”follow me!” I have work to do!” With that, Xia ruofei walked towards the oak Forest with lightning following closely behind him. Xia ruofei walked to the box and picked up the black truffle. He put it in front of Lightning’s nose and smiled.”Take a good sniff of this smell. It’s all up to you if you can find all the truffles underground!” Lightning could understand such simple instructions. It sniffed the truffle very carefully, then looked at Xia ruofei and wagged its tail a few times. “This is it?” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”then let’s go! Find all the truffles in this forest!” Lightning immediately sneaked out and circled around an oak tree a few times, sniffing with its nose. Soon, it came to a position and started to dig with its front paws. “I’ll do it, I’ll do it. You just have to be responsible for finding the location!” Xia ruofei quickly said. He picked up the shovel and began to dig at the spot where lightning was digging, while lightning lay quietly on the side. Ten centimeters, twenty centimeters ... This time, Xia ruofei dug for a full meter and finally saw a huge truffle. This time, it was the more precious white truffle ...
