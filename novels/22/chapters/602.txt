Chapter 603: The tea King takes action (1)

Everyone in the room was stunned by Xia ruofei’s words.

Li Guizhi said carefully,””Mr. Xia, it takes a lot of physical strength to make tea. My father’s current body ...”

Li Zhifu glared at Li Guizhi and said, “Didn’t you hear what Xiao Xia said? I’m in great health now!”

“But ... The entire process takes more than ten hours ...” Li Guizhi said anxiously.

Xia ruofei then realized that he had not thought it through. However, he had already said what he wanted to say and he really hoped that li Zhifu would make it himself. Only then would he be able to test the quality of the space red robe.

Hence, Xia ruofei pondered for a while and said,””Aunt Guizhi, I’m here. If old Mr. Li feels any discomfort, I can take care of him in time. I’ve also concocted some nutrient fluids that are very beneficial for physical recovery. I don’t think it’ll be a big problem. ”

Li Guizhi didn’t say anything else after hearing Xia ruofei’s words. After all, Xia ruofei was their family’s Savior!

Although ye Lingyun was also worried about li Zhifu’s health, he was more confident in Xia ruofei. Since Xia ruofei had even prepared the nutrient solution to recover his strength, ye Lingyun was even more at ease.

Li Zhifu himself was a little surprised. He smiled and said,””Little Xia, if you want to see how tea is made, there are many tea trees on Mount Wu Yi. Can’t you just pick some fresh leaves? Did he even need to bring it? Besides, the tea leaves in this season ... Are not of good quality ...”

Li Zhifu said it tactfully, but his meaning was clear.

Xia ruofei pretended not to hear him. He smiled and said,””Mr. Li, the fresh leaves that I brought ... How should I put it ... They might be a little different from ordinary tea leaves. You’ll know once you see them!” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Li Zhifu’s interest was piqued when he heard that. He said,””Then what are we waiting for? Let’s go take a look!”

After that, li Zhifu took the lead and walked toward the stairs. He walked with vigor, and it was impossible to tell that he had been diagnosed with late – Stage cancer not long ago.

......

Everyone went downstairs together. Xia ruofei took two steps forward and smiled.””Old Mr. Li, please wait here for a moment. The tea leaves are on the way.”

“Brother Xia, I’ll go get it!” Ye linyun quickly said.

“No need, no need ...” Xia ruofei said repeatedly.

He didn’t give ye Lingyun a chance to help. He quickly walked to the side of the car and opened the trunk. With a thought, a large bag of fresh leaves was taken out from the space and appeared in the trunk.

The bag of fresh leaves weighed six to seven catties. Xia ruofei reached out and easily picked up the bag. He turned around and walked towards the electrical appliance repair shop.

Xia ruofei placed the bag in front of li Zhifu and opened it. He smiled and said,”Old Mr. Li, what do you think of the quality of these fresh leaves?”

Li Zhifu grabbed a handful of fresh leaves with interest. When he saw the Emerald green leaves, his eyes couldn’t help but narrow. Then, he put his head close to them and took a deep breath. He immediately revealed a look of enjoyment.

Li Zhifu looked at it for a long time before sighing,””Little Xia, your tea leaves ... Are the most beautiful tea leaves I’ve seen in so many years!”

Xia ruofei didn’t understand why li Zhifu used the word “beautiful.” However, he was relieved to be acknowledged by li Zhifu. Then, he asked,””Old Mr. Li, you’ve handled the fresh leaves of the mother tree, Da Hong Pao, before, right? How does my tea compare to the mother tree Da Hong Pao?”

Li Zhifu said seriously,”the quality of the fresh leaves is definitely on par with the mother tree Da Hong Pao. The natural fragrance of the tea leaves is also stronger. However, the tea – picking technique seems to be a little lacking. Of course, this doesn’t affect much!”

Hearing this, Xia ruofei’s face blushed. This old man’s eyes were too sharp! It seemed that the seemingly simple work of picking tea leaves actually required a lot of knowledge!

Xia ruofei asked,”how is it?” Old Mr. Li, are you interested in making a move?”

“Of course!” Li Zhifu was obviously very interested in these fresh leaves.”I haven’t made tea by myself for many years. These fresh leaves are of such high quality. I ... Really want to do it!” Xiao Xia, if you trust me, then let me handle them. I promise to make a good Da Hong Pao for you!”

“Thank you, old Mr. Li!” Xia ruofei was overjoyed.

Li Guizhi and Niu Yusheng looked worried, but they opened their mouths and didn’t say anything in the end.

This was because they knew li Zhifu too well. This old man was very stubborn. Once he had decided on something, no one could pull him back. It was useless to say anything.

“It’s been a while since these fresh leaves were picked, right?”asked li Zhifu. We have to deal with it quickly! Xiao Xia, Xiao Ye, let’s go ...”

“Where are we going?” Xia ruofei asked subconsciously.

“Just get in the car, I’ll show you the way!” Li Zhifu said.

Then, he picked up the bag of fresh leaves. Ye Lingyun quickly took the bag from his hand and walked to the back of the Knight XV SUV, putting the large bag of fresh leaves into the trunk.

The chassis of the Knight XV was quite high. After ye Lingyun put the fresh leaves, he jogged to the back door, opened it, and helped li Zhifu in.
