2793 A dream start (2)

In the eyes of the mesis, this game was just a regular way to get points.

But now, the cruel reality told them that bar?a had fallen behind.

The substitutes ‘bench in Barcelona were also full of dumbfounded faces. The head coach, valvertyé, could not believe his eyes. He grabbed his hair with both hands, his mouth wide open, and stared at the field in shock.

The substitutes ‘bench for the away team, RCD Espanyol, became a sea of jubilation. The substitutes who had just taken their seats all rushed out at once, while the manager, Ruby, jumped up and waved his fists in excitement.

There was nothing more dreamy than this opening! It was equivalent to the Spaniards starting the game with a score of 1 – 0! Who would dare to think of such a thing before the game?

Ruby looked at Xia ruofei and Wu Lei in the arena, his heart filled with emotions.

Loud cheers could also be heard from the private room where Song Wei and Ling Qingxue were. The sound was from Zhou leiyun, who was dancing with joy.

Ling Qingxue and Song Wei did not feel that way. Even though Xia ruofei was the one who assisted, the one who scored was Wu Lei! So, the two of them only clapped for a while in the room.

On the other hand, Zhou leiyun and Zhao Zhenghao, the full – time Vice President of the Chinese Football Association, were so excited that they hugged each other.

China was also in an uproar because of this ball.

In the PP sports studio, when the goal was scored, Shen fangjian and Jia Tianning did not even have time to complete the routine operation of the broadcast. Jian Jia introduced the starting lineup of both teams.

“Dear audience members of PP sports, with the whistle of the referee, the eye – catching Catalan derby has pulled open the curtain of the battle! We saw Wu Lei pass the ball back to Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei quickly dribbled the ball and took two steps forward. Xia ruofei was a little clingy! Busquets and lakitik had already formed a siege on him! He continued to dribble the ball forward, and the ball was a Little Big! If you want to throw ...”

“Wait! Xia ruofei suddenly sped up like a fighter jet with its Afterburner on! He touched the ball first and dodged Busquets with a wave! Xia ruofei made a long pass! Wu Lei is plugging in at high speed, he caught up with the ball and is going solo!”

“Terstegan decisively abandoned the goal and went out. Wu Lei looked up and observed, and Wu Lei shot! The ball ... The ball went in! The ball went in! It had only been 23 seconds since the start of the match, and the two Chinese players had formed a line. In the end, Xia ruofei had dealt the fatal blow! This opening is way too dramatic!”

Jia Tianning looked at the broadcast and smiled.””Look! After Wu Lei scored, he rushed to Xia ruofei and hugged him tightly. This scene was simply too beautiful! A few months ago, we didn’t even dare to imagine such a scene!”

“Bar?a’s star players are dejected. It’s clear that the flash goal has hit them hard. Messi looks very confused. He clearly doesn’t know what happened in those short 20 seconds!” Shen fangjian said.

At that moment, the television broadcast began to replay the goal.

“I think 80% of the credit for this goal should go to Xia ruofei!” Shen fangjian said,”his pass was so accurate that it was like a guided missile! Alright, let’s take a look at the slow motion ...”

“After Xia ruofei receives the ball, it’s crucial for him to get past Busquets!” Shen fangjian continued,”of course, his pass was also of a very high level! Wu Lei is very comfortable when he catches the ball!”

After the slow – Motion replay from multiple angles, Shen fangjian smiled and said,””Alright! I take back what I just said. Wu Lei also played at a very high level in this goal. The angle of the shot was already very small, and at the moment of his shot, bar?a’s Center back, pique, who chased back to the penalty area, did not hesitate to shovel! The space left for Wu Lei was already very small, but the result was that Wu Lei’s shot went through the narrow only passage and sent the ball into bar?a’s goal! This shot is not easy!”

At this time, Wu Lei had finished celebrating the goal and was walking towards the field with his teammates.

Wu Lei, who was still feeling a little dizzy, had just scored a goal? And the one who was broken was bar?a, whom he had once envied.

In the PP sports studio, Shen fangjian said,””We want to congratulate Wu Lei for becoming the first Chinese player to break through Barcelona’s goal!”

“I was more optimistic about Xia ruofei.” “I didn’t expect Wu Lei to be the first to complete this achievement!” Jia Tianning said.

“As long as our Chinese players score, it’s something to be happy about!” Shen fangjian said with a smile,”every touch they made today is history!”

……

The football was placed in the center circle again. None of the players on the field had touched the ball just now, and they had not even sweated in such a short time, but the score had fallen to 0 – 1. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

After a brief moment of shock, the bar?a players were burning with anger.

Since when could a small club like RCD Espanyol arm – wrestle with Barcelona? We have to show them what we’re made of!

This time, it was bar?a’s turn to kick off the ball.

Suyass and Messi stood in front of the ball, while the other mid – Field players all stood behind the center line. They were lined up in a charging posture, waiting for the referee to blow the whistle.

The message conveyed by the bar?a players ‘attitude was very obvious, which was to bombard and set off wave after wave of attacks to beat the Spaniards into the mud!

The whistle sounded, and the match resumed.

After bar?a kicked off, the players in the middle and front fields immediately rushed past the center line, and the football was quickly sent forward.

Bar?a was a team that was very good at control. It could be said that the ball was at their feet, and it was very difficult for the opponent to snatch it. Their conduction was too skilled.

The RCD Espanyol players did their best to defend, and even iglasias retreated to their own half to participate in the defense. Xia ruofei and Wu Lei retreated even deeper, to the front of their own penalty area.

Bar?a’s little cooperation played well. The ball was at their feet and the Spanish players had a hard time snatching it.

For a time, the Spanish team’s penalty area was jittery.

Xia ruofei could see that his teammates were a little nervous. After all, they were facing the powerful bar?a.

As he cooperated with his teammates to defend, he used his mental power to observe the situation on the field and constantly changed his position.

In just five minutes, bar?a had already completed two shots at the goal.

Every kick was quite threatening, and one of them was a slide shot from suyass who had fallen to the ground near the penalty spot. The other shot was even more threatening. After Messi got the ball on the right side, he cut inside along the line of the penalty area and deftly dodged mark Roka’s upgrab. He found space to shoot at the goal and did not hesitate to make a shot.

The football drew a large arc and flew toward the far corner of the goal.

Seeing that the ball was about to go into the net, the Spanish goalkeeper, Diego Lopez, rose into the air and flew towards the ball with all his might. His body was completely stretched out, and when his fingertips touched the ball a little, the trajectory of the football changed a little, causing it to hit the crossbar and fly out of the end line.

It could be said that if Diego Lopez had not touched the ball, the ball would definitely have gone straight into the dead end of the goal!

After Diego Lopez dedicated such a godly save, he got up from the ground amidst the loud sighs of the bar?a fans in the stadium. He raised his arms and shouted,”Get your spirits up. We can’t give the other team a chance to shoot!”

Messi held his head in his hands, and his face was filled with disbelief.

The moment he made his move, he felt that the ball was there. He did not expect that Diego Lopez would be able to pounce on it. This goalkeeper was getting more and more demonic!

Bar?a issued a Tactical Corner kick and reorganized the attack.

Xia ruofei was still roaming around the periphery of the restricted area. He kept adjusting his position like a hungry wolf looking for an opportunity ...
