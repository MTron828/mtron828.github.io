When Xia ruofei entered the alley on his flying sword, he had already used his spiritual power to investigate. He immediately discovered a crack under the stone slab that crossed the ditch at the back door of the house.

As he flew over, he had already summoned the spirit painting scroll from his palm, and then accurately threw it into the gap and clamped it.

Immediately after, Xia ruofei entered the spirit map space and kept the qushuang flying sword.

After entering the spirit map space, Xia ruofei immediately released his spiritual power to check the situation outside.

In just a few seconds after he hid in the spirit map space, three town resident puppets had already found the alley.

The three puppets were very fast, but they did not know that Xia ruofei had already hidden himself. Hence, the three puppets did not notice him at all. They only did a routine search and left through the alley.

Xia ruofei secretly heaved a sigh of relief. That was close!

The speed of these puppets was much faster than he had imagined.

……

In the center of the mini – town, old Daoist Zhen Yang was standing on the bluestone Street with a smile on his face. At this moment, there was a hint of slyness in his eyes, and the dullness unique to puppets that couldn’t be concealed had long disappeared.

When Xia ruofei entered the spirit map space, Taoist Zhen Yang’s smile froze. He couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows and mumble to himself,””This little guy is quite interesting!”

At that moment, Taoist Zhen Yang could no longer sense Xia ruofei’s whereabouts. However, he knew that Xia ruofei could not have disappeared into thin air, much less left the first level of the Tower of Trials.

It was precisely because of this that old Daoist Zhen Yang found it even more inconceivable.

To be able to conceal himself in such a short time and escape his search was truly unbelievable.

Old Daoist Zhen Yang muttered to himself for a moment before stepping on the bluestone Street. His body then turned into a shadow that was almost impossible to catch with the naked eye as he searched the entire first level of the Tower of Trials at an extremely fast speed.

If Xia ruofei were to see this scene, he would be so shocked that his jaw would drop. Daoist lang wo Zhen Yang didn’t use sword Kinesis flight but relied on the explosive speed of his physical body. However, his speed was much faster than Xia ruofei’s sword Kinesis flight. There was even a faint sound of thunder and his aura was majestic. One look and one could tell that he was a cultivator with extremely high cultivation. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

After a fruitless search, Daoist Zhen Yang returned to the center of the mini town and laughed,”Scholar Xia’s methods are impressive, this Daoist is impressed! However, I still have to remind you that you can’t just hide in the first level of the Tower of Trials. Even if you can sneak to the entrance to the second level, it’s still impossible to open the entrance. Only when you kill more than 100 puppets on the first level will the entrance to the second level be activated. Therefore, you still have to work hard to kill the enemies from now on, scholar Xia!”

Although Xia ruofei was in the spirit map space, he had been releasing his spiritual power to pay attention to the outside world. Therefore, he heard every word that Taoist Zhen Yang said.

Hearing this, Xia ruofei’s expression couldn’t help but change.

The requirement to kill more than a hundred puppets to pass one test was a little too harsh.

One must know that every puppet in this mini town was not weak. The weakest one was at the Golden core stage and there were even some at the nascent Soul Stage. It was not a problem for Xia ruofei to defeat one or two golden core puppets, but it was too difficult to defeat a hundred of them.

After all, these puppets were not made of wood. They would not just stand there and wait for him to kill them. Furthermore, killing one might attract many more. When he was surrounded, it would be difficult for him to escape even if he had many trump cards.

If he caused too much of a commotion and attracted the attention of nascent soul cultivators, Xia ruofei would not be able to escape.

The space on the first floor of the Tower of Trials was too small. It was only a few acres. In such a small space, it was difficult for a cultivator to move around. Especially if an original infant stage cultivator targeted Xia ruofei, he would have nowhere to run.

Xia ruofei also thought of another problem. Did Ling Qingxue have the same experience as him? if Ling Qingxue had entered the Tower of Trials and faced so many golden core puppets on the first level, she would definitely not have survived.

Xia ruofei’s expression turned even uglier at the thought of this.

Of course, there was also a possibility that these puppets were set up according to the cultivation level of the cultivators who entered the Tower of Trials. Perhaps the Qi condensation cultivators who entered the Tower of Trials would also face Qi condensation cultivators as their main opponents.

But even so, it was still extremely difficult for Ling Qingxue.

Thinking of this, Xia ruofei couldn’t wait to rush to the higher floors and find a way to meet up with Ling Qingxue as soon as possible.

However, the situation in front of him was very awkward. It was impossible for him to rush out rashly. If he were to go out and risk his life with his hot – bloodedness, that would be the behavior of a reckless man.

Just as Xia ruofei was caught in a dilemma, he heard old Taoist Zhen Yang’s voice.

Old Daoist Zhen Yang chuckled and said,”scholar Xia, please make your decision as soon as possible. The second floor of the trial Pagoda is much more exciting than the first floor. The earlier you enter the second floor, the more benefits you’ll get!” That’s right, please be at ease, benefactor Xia. This Daoist won’t participate in the hunt for you, so you just need to focus on dealing with the puppets. There’s no need to worry about this Daoist. ”

Xia ruofei mumbled to himself in the spirit map space,””The word” hunting “is really well used! I’ve really become the prey of a bunch of puppets now ... But you’re a bad old man, so there’s no way I’d believe you!”
