Chapter 1271: Magical hands that can bring back spring (2)

Translator: 549690339

He did not doubt Xia ruofei’s technique or medical skills. He also believed that the bone should have been connected. However, the recovery period of the bone fracture was the most critical problem that could not be avoided.

The effect of the anesthetic would only last for a few hours. When the “star of Hong Kong” woke up, he would move around due to the pain. If he was a human, even if he was a child, he could at least comfort him with words. However, the “star of Hong Kong” could not understand human language and was so irascible. If he kicked his legs a little, Xia ruofei’s hard work of adjusting his bones would have been in vain.

Even if Xia ruofei had the magical ability to calm the “star of Hong Kong” down, it would take a hundred days for him to recover from a serious injury. Did Xia ruofei stay with the “star of Hong Kong” for more than three months and kept him company without rest?

This was obviously not realistic.

Xia ruofei didn’t care about what the others thought. He was focused on applying the ointment evenly on the broken part of his calf.

In order to maximize the efficacy of the ointment, he even scraped off a little bit of the ointment from the bottom of the bowl and applied as much ointment as possible on the star of Hong Kong’s injured leg.

After doing all this, Xia ruofei heaved a sigh of relief. He turned to Guo Hongjiang and said,””Director Guo, I’m done. Let’s rest here for a while and wait for the star of Hong Kong to wake up!”

Guo Hongjiang nodded slightly and said sincerely,””Mr. Xia, thank you for your hard work!”

Regardless of whether Xia ruofei would succeed or not, Guo Hongjiang’s gratitude came from the bottom of his heart. He could tell that Xia ruofei was trying his best to treat the “star of Hong Kong”. Besides, he had witnessed the magical medical skills that MA Xiong had mentioned. Hence, he was even more determined to befriend Xia ruofei.

“You’re welcome,” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Guo Hongjiang beckoned Xia ruofei to sit on the field outside the stables. After all, the smell there was not particularly pleasant.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and nodded.”Alright then! Dr. Li, one of you will stay here to observe the star of Hong Kong’s condition. When he’s about to wake up, come out and let me know. ”

“Okay, I’ll stay here!” Doctor li quickly said.

“That’s fine too,” Xia ruofei said,”remember, do not touch the ointment on the star of Hong Kong’s body. Do not use any equipment to check it. Just watch!”

“I understand! Don’t worry!” Doctor Li said immediately.

Xia ruofei, Guo Hongjiang, and MA Xiong walked out of the stables. The staff had already brought in tables and chairs for the picnic. They had also brought out some pastries, snacks, and of course, the red wine that they had not finished for dinner. Everything was placed on the table.

Although it was already winter, the weather in Hong Kong was not too cold. Even if they were outdoors, they would not feel uncomfortable.

Xia ruofei and the other two sat down and chatted with their glasses of red wine. They would occasionally take a sip of wine.

Guo Hongjiang did not continue the topic of “the star of Hong Kong” because he felt that if he said too much, Xia ruofei would misunderstand that he did not trust his ability. Besides, the “star of Hong Kong” was injured and he was in a bad mood. So, he changed the topic and changed his mood.

Those who could thrive in the business world and had a net worth of tens of billions would not have low emotional intelligence. Be it Guo Hongjiang or MA Xiong, they had their own unique charm, so Xia ruofei did not feel bored.

Xia ruofei found everything interesting, whether it was about business or the anecdotes of the rich in Hong Kong.

An hour passed quickly.

When it was almost Teno’ clock in the evening, doctor Li Ran over and said,””Director Guo, director MA, Mr. Xia, it’s about time. The star of Hong Kong will wake up soon.”

Xia ruofei, MA Xiong, and Guo Hongjiang looked at each other. The three of them stood up at the same time and walked towards the stable.

The star of Hong Kong was still lying there quietly.

MA Xiong took a glance and said in surprise,”Eh? The swelling seems to have gone down!”

Guo Hongjiang’s eyes widened when he heard this. He hurriedly walked over to take a closer look and said in surprise,””It really does seem to have subsided a little.”

Doctor li found it a little unbelievable. When a bone was fractured, it would cause great damage to the muscle tissue and capillaries. How could the swelling go down so easily?

He couldn’t help but walk forward to take a closer look. Then, he seriously recalled the situation of the “star of Hong Kong” just now. He couldn’t help but be a little shaken. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

It seemed like ... It had really dissipated a lot?

However, it didn’t seem to make much of a difference!

Doctor li was also very conflicted.

In the past hour, doctor li had been staring at the star of Hong Kong. The swelling was a slow process that was not easy to notice.

It was just like a child. If the parents saw him every day, they wouldn’t feel that he had changed much. However, if others saw him after a period of time, they would immediately realize that the child had grown up a lot.

So, as the only person who stayed in the stables, doctor li was the last to notice the change.

Everyone couldn’t help but turn to look at Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei knew that the spirit Heart Flower petals must have taken effect.

One had to know that the unremarkable ointment just now was actually a whole petal of the spirit Heart Flower! It would be strange if there was no effect at all!

“Xia Sheng, why don’t you ... Go over and check?” MA Xiong’s voice was filled with excitement.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.

He walked over to the star of Hong Kong and glanced at the fracture.

The black ointment still had a strong smell of Chinese medicine. However, Xia ruofei knew that the “star of Hong Kong” must have absorbed all the petals of the spirit Heart Flower.

The substance would be absorbed by the skin. At first, Xia ruofei was worried that the star of Hong Kong might not be able to absorb the composition of the petals. Now, it seemed like he was overthinking.

With just a glance, he could clearly feel that the swelling had subsided a lot.

Unlike the others, Xia ruofei had used his spiritual energy to examine the entire leg. Even the smallest change could not escape his eyes.

Moreover, the swelling was quite obvious, otherwise, MA Xiong would not have noticed it at first sight when he entered the stable.

Xia ruofei put his hand on the “star of Hong Kong” ‘s back and released his spiritual power to check.

When the situation was reflected in his mind, he could not help but smile.

The petals of the spirit Heart Flower did not disappoint him.

During the examination, Xia ruofei could clearly “see” that the broken part of the bone had started to join back together, especially the small pieces of broken bone. They had already grown together with the calf bone. If one did not check carefully, they would not even find any traces of the fracture.

The recovery of bones was the slowest. As for the strained muscles and even the torn tendons, they had already recovered.

The effect of using an entire petal of the spirit Heart Flower in one go was simply too heaven – defying!

“What do you think, Mr. Xia?” Guo Hongjiang asked impatiently when he saw Xia ruofei lift his head after the examination.

“The situation is similar to what I expected. The effect is very good!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”director Guo, I’ve increased the confidence of the ‘star of Hong Kong’ in recovering his power!”

“That’s great!” Guo Hongjiang couldn’t help but feel a little excited.”Mr. Xia, thank you so much! As long as the ‘star of Hong Kong’ can survive, I will reward you handsomely!”

When Guo Hongjiang heard the good news, he was so excited that he didn’t notice that Xia ruofei had used the word “recovered”.

In fact, Xia ruofei’s initial goal was to restore the “star of Hong Kong” to his peak condition so that he could compete directly and even compete for the championship.

After a while, the “star of Hong Kong” moved slightly and slowly opened his eyes.
