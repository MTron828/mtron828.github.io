Chapter 734: The “conspiracy” has succeeded (1)

“Didn’t you say you were going to buy books? “Why are you suddenly showing me the renovation plan ...” Lin Qiao rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei and mumbled.

She felt that Xia ruofei was acting weird today and did not know what he was up to.

However, Xia ruofei maintained the posture of handing her the proposal with a bright smile on his face. She thought about it and took it.

Hu Zi’s mother also felt that Xia ruofei was a little strange today. He was going to accompany Lin Qiao to buy some books, but he had to bring her along. After returning to the city, he did not go to the bookstore but came to a real estate and even let Lin Qiao see some renovation plan.

Hu Zi’s mother could vaguely guess Xia ruofei’s intentions, but she did not say anything. In her heart, she thought that no matter what Xia ruofei said, she would firmly reject it.

Lin Qiao was already looking through the three plans that the gold – medal designer of jianda group had worked overtime to come up with.

“It’s so beautiful ...” Lin Qiao couldn’t help but praise when she saw the magnificent design.

Since Liang Weimin knew that Xia ruofei had bought it for Lin Qiao, he would naturally tell the designer to design it according to the style that young girls liked.

It was also very important to understand the customer’s attributes. If this house was designed in a Chinese style, Lin Qiao would not be interested in it no matter how perfect the design was.

All three plans adopted a fresh style, and the master bedroom was decorated with many girlish elements and pink decorations. The whole house was simply like a dream house.

Lin Qiao couldn’t stop fondling it, especially the design of the small attic.

Perhaps every girl had a dream in her heart, to own such a dreamlike attic, and this dream was so vividly reflected in the design draft today.

Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”what do you think?” Which plan do you like the most?”

......

For the first time, Lin Qiao felt that she had difficulty choosing. She looked at the three plans over and over again and said after a long while,””Brother ruofei, these three plans are all very good. If I had to choose ... It’s really hard to choose ...”

The three designers standing behind Liang Weimin couldn’t help but look proud.

Lin Qiao thought for a while and said,”I think this set is the best in terms of the overall design, but the bedroom design seems to be more heartwarming!” However, I still prefer the last one. It’s really amazing!”

Liang Weimin and Xia ruofei looked at each other and couldn’t help but laugh.

Liang Weimin laughed heartily and said,”isn’t that simple?” Little song, the three of you will work together and combine the three plans according to what Lin Qiao just said. Is there a problem?”

One of the designers immediately said,””No problem, President Liang!”

Of course, it was not as simple as changing the bedroom and attic design of the previous plan to the other two. This involved the coordination of the overall style, and there must be many details to be dealt with.

Of course, this wasn’t a problem for the gold – medal designers of jianda group. Although this kind of work was more cumbersome, since the chairman had personally spoken, the designers would naturally do their best to perform. If they didn’t perform now, when else would they do it?

Lin Qiao was stunned and asked,”Brother ruofe...What...What’s going on?”

Xia ruofei laughed and stood up. “Qiao’ er, you don’t have to worry about this! I’ll take you and Auntie to a place. ” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“RUO Fei ...” Hu Zi’s mother frowned and said,”this ...”

“Auntie, I know what you want to say.” Xia ruofei chuckled and interrupted Hu Zi’s mother, saying,”let’s talk about it later, okay? For now, you guys come with me, okay?”

Hu Zi’s mother muttered to herself and nodded helplessly.

Thus, the group got on the electric car and, accompanied by Liang Weimin, arrived at Building 1.

They were in the process of handing over their houses these few days, and many owners were also at the real estate area. It was much more lively than the last time.

Xia ruofei and the rest took the elevator to Room 1801 on the 18th floor. The manager of the sales department opened the door with the key.

Xia ruofei entered first and then called Hu Zi’s mother and Lin Qiao in.

As soon as Lin Qiao entered the door, she looked around and said in surprise,”Brother ruofei, this is the apartment in the renovation plan we just saw, right?”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””That’s right! If this house was renovated according to the plan just now, would you like it?”

Without waiting for Lin Qiao to speak, Hu ‘Zi’s mother said,””Ruofei, this house costs a few million, we can’t ...”

Xia ruofei chuckled and interrupted Hu Zi’s mother,””Auntie, I understand what you mean. We’ll talk about this later.”

Hu Zi’s mother wanted to decline twice, but she was interrupted by Xia ruofei before she could say anything. She could only smile bitterly and shake her head. No matter what ruofei said later, she had to reject him with a firm attitude.

Xia ruofei looked at Lin Qiao again, waiting for her answer with a smile.

Lin Qiao thought for a moment and said,”if I renovate it according to that plan, it will definitely be very, very beautiful ... But this has nothing to do with me. After I get a job, I will work hard to earn money to buy such a house!”

Lin Qiao was not stupid. She could guess Xia ruofei’s intention. This lady was using this method to reject Xia ruofei’s good intentions.
