Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh when he heard this. Cao tieshu’s wife had actually used the erudite word “report”.

Actually, the moment she came, Xia ruofei knew that she must have something to discuss with him. She did not hide her thoughts. It was written all over her face!

Although Cao tieshu’s wife was only a canteen staff, Xia ruofei had never put on any airs. He asked with a pleasant expression,””Mrs. Cao, what’s the matter?”

Mrs. Cao hesitated for a moment and asked,””President Xia, the company’s headquarters is moving to the city. Does that mean the cafeteria here will be closed?”

“Who did you hear that from?” Xia ruofei asked, stunned.

He then turned to look at Feng Rao, who shook her head slightly, indicating that she had no idea.

“That’s what everyone’s saying ...”Mrs. Cao said.

Xia ruofei said with a pleasant expression,”Mrs. Cao, don’t worry!” The staff cafeteria will still be preserved. After all, there are still many people working on the farm!”

Some of the villagers who worked near the farm were also used to eating in the staff cafeteria. On one hand, it was clean and hygienic, especially for couples who worked here. After eating in the cafeteria, they didn’t have to cook when they went home, which was very convenient.

More importantly, the company would subsidize the meals in the staff cafeteria. Everyone only had to spend 5 yuan to eat two meals, and the actual consumption was at least 20 yuan. The rest of the money was subsidized by the company, so everyone was naturally willing to enjoy such benefits.

“President Xia,” Mrs. Cao said,”if there are fewer people eating, does that mean the cafeteria won’t need so many employees?” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

In fact, Cao tieshu’s wife was not worried about layoff. The two of them had joined the company at the beginning stage and could be considered as the company’s founding members. Cao tieshu was also in the middle level of the company and was in charge of the farm business. She would not be the one getting laid off. She was mainly asking on behalf of the other young employees in the cafeteria.

Feng Rao chuckled and said,””Don’t worry! Everyone has signed a formal employment contract with the company, so even if the cafeteria staff is reduced, the company will make appropriate arrangements. ”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes!” And the company still had to study whether or not to reduce the size of the cafeteria! Just tell everyone to relax! I definitely won’t let everyone lose their jobs!”

Cao tieshu’s wife said happily,”I understand. Thank you, director Xia!” Thank you, President Feng! Then ... Then I won’t disturb your meal ...”

After she finished speaking, she happily walked back to the kitchen. Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh again.”Sister che, have you noticed that big sister – in – Law Cao’s words are a lot more advanced now?”

In the past, as a peasant woman, she would never have been able to say words like “report” or “eat.”

Feng Rao rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei and said,””Your focus is really strange ...”

Xia ruofei scratched his head and said,”it seems that the relocation of the headquarters is urgent!” Even the basic level employees are spreading it ...”

“You only just found out!” Feng Rao snapped. If you don’t come back soon, the employees will start a rebellion!”

“Is it that serious?” Xia ruofei laughed.

“Why not? The headquarters building is ready, we’re just waiting for you to come back and host the relocation!” Feng Jing said,”there are a few young people who have rented a place near the building in advance. The company has not moved yet, and they have wasted the rent for nothing. Their faces are turning green ...”

“It’s decided today!” Xia ruofei said.

It turned out that the relocation of the headquarters was what everyone was most concerned about.

In the morning meeting, the first thing the Executive Director Dong Yun reported was this problem.

Dong Yun, who had officially taken office, still had short hair and was dressed in a fitting black business suit. She looked very neat.

She opened the folder and gestured to Feng Jing before saying,””Chairman, while you were away on your business trip, the headquarters ‘renovation has been completed. The relevant office equipment has also been purchased. We have hired a professional organization to conduct a Comprehensive Environmental test of the building. All aspects have met the standards and we can move at any time.”

Xia ruofei nodded.”After the meeting, I’ll go to the headquarters building to take a look. Then, we’ll set a date and move the headquarters there!”

Although everyone had already known about the relocation of the headquarters, when Xia ruofei finally made the decision, the company’s senior officials present were still excited.

The relocation of the headquarters meant that the company had moved out of the remote suburbs and was officially on the road to great development.

In the heart of Sanshan city where every inch of land was worth its weight in gold, owning an entire building was definitely a reflection of the company’s strength! As the company’s senior management, everyone was also honored.

Next, the marketing director, Xiao Qiang, reported to Xia ruofei about the company’s overall operation.

In fact, the Paradise corporation’s products had always been in a state of supply falling short of demand. Needless to say, paradise vegetables, which was the first company to establish a brand, had a rather mature cooperation channel. For example, they also had a stable distribution channel. In addition to supplying it to cooperative channels such as Tongren Hall, the company’s sales in e – commerce channels were also quite hot.

It was worth mentioning that the sales of the Chinese perch were also very smooth.

In the beginning, Xia ruofei had asked them to arrange for some soft articles to be published on the internet. It had indeed evoked many people’s memories of delicious food. Although fresh Chinese perch was only sold in the three mountains area and was frozen in other areas, the taste of the Chinese perch had quickly won over a large number of gluttons. The expensive Chinese perch was often out of stock.
