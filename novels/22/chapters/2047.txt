In fact, the cooking process of Pomfret was not complicated. It could be steamed and steamed. In fact, top – grade ingredients did not have so many complicated procedures in cooking. The simple cooking process could highlight the taste of the ingredient itself.

Xia ruofei asked Wu Xiujuan to remove the gills and internal organs of the Chinese perch. After that, Xia ruofei put the Chinese perch in boiling water to remove the fishy smell.

Then, Xia ruofei spread ham slices, mushroom slices, bamboo shoots and other auxiliary materials on the fish body. Then, he added the cooked lard, white sugar, refined salt, shrimp, cooking wine, chicken essence soup and other seasonings.

After that, Xia ruofei smiled and said,””It’s done. Later, we’ll directly steam it in the steamer for 20 minutes and then it can be served directly on the table. Sister – in – Law, just pay attention to the timing. Serve the steamer after the guests arrive. ”

“It’s that simple?” Wu Xiujuan asked in surprise.

“Of course! Pomfrets are a top – tier delicacy, and they don’t require so many complicated cooking techniques!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”then I’ll leave this place to you?”

“Good, good, good!” Wu Xiujuan quickly said,”boss, you can go!”

Xia ruofei nodded and walked out of the kitchen. As he was walking out, he heard Wu Xiujuan muttering the keywords “steam it over a fire” and ” 20 minutes”. He couldn’t help but smile at Wu Xiujuan before leaving the kitchen.

Zhao Yongjun and the others arrived very early. Xia ruofei had just come out of the kitchen and sat down on the wicker chair under the eaves in the backyard to rest for a while when he heard song Rui’s noisy voice outside the door.

“RUO Fei, open the door, open the door!”

Xia ruofei smiled as he stood up. He pressed a button on a control panel not far behind him and the door to the backyard opened.

There were many control panels like this in the courtyard. Each panel had an LCD screen so that no matter where the owner was, he could easily see who the visitors were and control the opening and closing of the courtyard door.

The three cars entered in a single file. Wu Qiang quickly went over to direct the cars to Park in the parking space on the side of the courtyard.

Zhao Yongjun, song Rui, Hou Liang, and the others all got out of the car. Xia ruofei’s group of brothers in the capital all came.

Xia ruofei was surprised to see Zhuo Yiyi in the same car as song Rui.

Could it be that the two of them had finally made substantial progress? Xia ruofei could not help but look at song Rui and Zhuo Yiyi.

This was also a pair of jokers. Zhuo Yiyi was a little insensitive when it came to relationships between men and women. Song Rui was so obvious to her, and everyone around her knew it, but she just treated song Rui as her male best friend. Song Rui was once the number one profligate young master in the capital. However, after meeting Zhuo Yiyi, he had turned into an innocent young man. His ability to pursue girls had deteriorated to the negatives. The relationship between the two had always been at a very awkward distance. Even Xia ruofei, Zhao Yongjun, and the others, who were outsiders, could not help but feel anxious for them.

“Boss Xia, I’m here to freeload a meal. Any objections?” Zhuo Yiyi asked casually.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”why would I have any objections?” I’m more than happy that beauty Zhuo is willing to do me a favor! As long as you’re willing, you can come here every day ...”

When Xia ruofei said this, he could feel song Rui’s murderous gaze. He immediately changed his words.””I don’t even mind you freeloading with song Rui every day!”

“You can talk!” Zhuo Yiyi said happily.

Xia ruofei greeted Zhao Yongjun, Hou Liang, Wei Jun, and the others one by one and led them into the dining room in the backyard.

In the kitchen, Wu Xiujuan saw that the guests had arrived and immediately placed the Chinese perch that Xia ruofei had prepared into the steamer and started to steam it.

As for the other dishes, some of them were already being simmered and could be served at any time. Some of the ingredients had already been prepared and were about to be stir – fried.

Xia Xiaolan also went over to help, and the kitchen was in full swing.

Wu Qiang followed everyone to the restaurant and helped Xia ruofei entertain the guests.

After everyone had taken their seats, Wu Qiang went to open the wine.

Xia ruofei smiled.”I’ve prepared a bottle of half – Lon. It’s for the ladies. The men will drink white. Is that okay?”

“I’ll listen to you!” Song Rui said,”we don’t plan to leave today anyway. We can drink to our hearts ‘content!”

“No problem! We’ll get drunk tonight!” Xu Zi Xuan also said with a smile.

“Straightforward!” Xia ruofei gave him a thumbs up and said to Wu Qiang,”Wu Qiang, all the men will use white wine. Give each of them a small Zha Hu and everyone will take their own wine. It’s fair and just!”

“Alright!”

Xia ruofei then looked at Zhuo Yiyi and asked,””Yiyi, you’re fine with drinking white wine, right? If you can’t drink, I’ve prepared some fruit juice. ”

“Drink some! You guys are all drinking, it’s such a killjoy for me to drink juice alone!” Zhuo Yiyi said.

“You’re bold!” Xia ruofei complimented.

Very quickly, everyone poured the wine and a few cold dishes were already placed on the table. Wu Qiang then ran to the kitchen, and soon, one or two hot dishes were served.

Xia ruofei raised his glass and said,”come, come, come!” It’s rare for us brothers to be together again, and beauty Zhuo is here to support us. Let’s drink together!”

“Cheers!”

“Cheers!”

A burst of laughter came from the dining room in the backyard.

After eating for a while, Wu Qiang served a large plate with the steamed kun fish on it. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Xia ruofei immediately put down his chopsticks and said with a smile,””Come, come, come. Everyone, try this dish. I made it myself!”
