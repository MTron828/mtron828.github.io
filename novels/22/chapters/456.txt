Chapter 457: The General Manager is in place (1)

Feng Jing’s attention was completely drawn to the beautiful Taoyuan vegetables. Of course, what attracted her even more was the shocking profit rate that Xia ruofei had told her about.

Hence, after hearing Xia ruofei’s words, Feng Rao replied casually,””Oh ... Ten million US dollars is not a small amount ... What? 10 million US dollars!”

Feng Rao suddenly raised her voice. She was staring at the vegetables in paradise, but she suddenly looked up at Xia ruofei. Her eyes were wide open, and her face was full of disbelief.

Xia ruofei nodded with a calm expression.

Feng Rao quickly calmed herself down and said,””Director Xia, your company’s products are very competitive, and there’s no doubt about their potential. You don’t have to exaggerate the company’s assets.”

As she said that, she took out some documents from her bag and quickly looked through them.”According to the scale of your company ... Mm, and the situation that I’ve just observed, although the construction standards of the hardware facilities are very high, the total assets should be ... Not more than ten million. There’s still a big difference between that and US $10 million!”

Feng Jing was referring to the situation of Tao Yuan farm. In fact, this valuation had already taken into account the factor of Tao Yuan vegetables. If it was just the hardware facilities, even if the newly built building was included, it should be less than ten million HxB.

Xia ruofei scratched his head and looked embarrassed.

When Feng Rao saw this expression, she naturally thought that Xia ruofei was embarrassed because she had exposed him.

Initially, Feng Jing had been interested in this small company because of Taoyuan vegetables. However, Xia ruofei ‘s’ exaggeration ‘had made Feng Jing’s impression of him worsen.

“I’m sorry, miss Feng,” Xia ruofei said.”The information I provided to sis Wu was not complete. In fact, our company’s assets are more than that.”

Feng Jing’s eyes flashed with a hint of mockery. She felt that Xia ruofei was obviously stubborn. It was obvious that paradise corporation’s focus was on this farm, and the farm’s value was at most ten million HxB. Could it be that the company had more assets that could be claimed to be worth more than ten million USD? Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Then, director Xia, please give me a good introduction!” Feng Rao said with a smile.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”there are currently three assets under the name of the Paradise Corporation. One of them is the Paradise Farm that we’re currently in. This is also one of the areas that I’m focusing on developing. I’ve already planned to rent more land from the local government to further expand the scale of our farm.”

Feng Rao nodded and listened quietly.

Xia ruofei continued,”the second is that we have invested in a winery with the lingji F & B group. The total assets are about 10 million Yuan. We have 50% of the shares, which is about 5 million Yuan.”

Feng Rao nodded and thought to herself,”this is far from ten million dollars!” Besides, the environment was not good. Many wineries in the country were operating at a loss. It was not a good idea to invest in wineries at this time.

Xia ruofei did not explain the situation of the winery to Feng Rao in detail, nor did he tell her the excellent market prospects of the improved Drunken Eight Immortals.

Xia ruofei noticed Feng Rao’s expression and could guess what she was thinking. He smiled and continued,””The third asset is that we’ve cooperated with Mr. Tang He, the chairman of the shengbang group in the United States, to acquire a farm called padink in Australia. Well ... It has now been renamed Paradise Farm. Our paradise Corporation owns 51% of the shares. This farm in Australia is valued at about 20 million US dollars, so the assets of paradise Corporation are definitely more than 10 million US dollars!”

Feng Rao’s eyes widened in shock. Xia ruofei’s words had indeed shocked her.

To be honest, 10 million USD wasn’t a big company in Feng Jing’s eyes. At least, it was still small compared to the two companies she had worked for.

However, compared to the impression she had of the Paradise Corporation, this was far beyond her expectations.

Moreover, the words ‘Australian farm’ and United States’s shengbang Corporation ‘naturally had a huge impact on Feng Jing’s mental state.

Feng Jing’s first impression of the company was that it was a small farm in the outskirts of a rural county. However, with the disclosure of information such as paradise vegetables and the Australian cooperative farm, Feng Jing knew that her judgment seemed to be quite off.

In this invisible confrontation, Xia ruofei had clearly gained the upper hand.

Of course, Xia ruofei was satisfied with Feng Jing’s ability. Otherwise, he would not have told her so much.

Xia ruofei walked to his desk confidently, picked up a stack of documents, and walked back. He handed it to Feng Jing and smiled.””Miss Feng, these are the copies of the winery and Australian farm investment documents that I just introduced to you. There are also some copies of our company’s recent sales orders. You can take a look first.”

Feng Rao received the documents mechanically. She was still in a daze as her mind was filled with thoughts about the 10 million US dollars in assets.

Feng Rao quickly flipped through the information provided by Xia ruofei.

In fact, she had already believed that Jian Jia and Xia ruofei would not lie about such an obvious and easily exposed matter.
