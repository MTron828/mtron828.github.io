Xu lang called himself a glutton, so he naturally had a good eye for good food and wine. His eyes lit up slightly as he asked,””Mr. Xia, I don’t think I’ve seen this wine before!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”It’s from my winery in Australia. I hope uncle Xu Can give me a taste.”

“I’m looking forward to it!” Xu lang laughed and said,”the delectable Buddha Jumps Over the Wall soup, coupled with the best wine, is truly the most enjoyable thing in life!”

“Uncle Xu, I’m under a lot of pressure now!” Xia ruofei said half – jokingly,”what if my wine doesn’t meet your expectations?”

“Hahaha! I believe in Mr. Xia!” Xu lang laughed.”Your company’s products have never disappointed us. I was fortunate enough to taste the top – grade abalones of your paradise Corporation with Mr. MA. It’s simply an endless aftertaste!”

Xia ruofei laughed. He opened a bottle of wine and took out the freshly brewed noble rot wine. He had never tasted it before. This was the first time that the noble rot wine was being presented to the public, and he was looking forward to it.

To cultivate the heart concentrating grass, Xia ruofei removed the time array flags around the precious rot wine and used it on the heart concentrating grass instead.

However, after calculating the time, the precious rotten wine had been ripened in the oak barrel for about 50 years, which was definitely the best tasting period.

Xia ruofei personally poured half a glass of expensive rotten wine for everyone.

Xu lang picked up the glass. The wine was golden in color and had a thick texture. Xu lang was secretly surprised by its appearance.

He brought the wine cup to his nose and sniffed it. A faint fragrance assailed his nose, making him have an impulse to drink it immediately.

At this moment, Xia ruofei raised his glass and said with a smile,””Uncle Xu, CEO Feng, let’s raise our glasses! Thank you for coming all the way here, uncle Xu!”

Everyone raised their glasses. After Xu lang clinked glasses with everyone, he took a small sip with a sense of urgency.

The unique rich aroma of the noble rot wine immediately filled his mouth. The sweetness that far exceeded that of ordinary wine made every taste bud in Xu Lang’s body jump for joy. The wine stayed on the tip of his tongue for a while before he closed his eyes and swallowed it.

“Uncle Xu, how’s the wine?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

Xu lang opened his eyes and exclaimed in admiration,””Mr. Xia, if I’m not wrong, this should be a top – grade noble rot wine!”

A bottle of wine that was golden in color did not necessarily mean that it was expensive rotten wine, but after tasting it, Xu lang, who was well – versed in this, was a hundred percent sure.

In fact, he had tasted the noble rot wine from the IMU winery in Germany before. This was one of the top three noble rot wines in the world. However, putting the fame aside, he felt that the noble rot wine that Xia ruofei had brought out tonight seemed to be better.

It should be known that the noble rot wine produced by the Yimu winery was known as the withered and selected noble rot wine, or the <anno data – annotation – ID =”333d08f -108f -4d3f – B3d1 – A1d3d00393d”> CBA </anno> for short. Wine grapes had to be picked by hand, and on average, at least 10 trees were needed to make a bottle of wine.

The average price of this type of expensive rotten wine is over 50000 Chinese dollars per bottle. The top quality ones can only be bought through auctions, so the price is even more ridiculous.

Xu lang only took a sip and he could almost tell that Xia ruofei’s bottle of expensive rotten wine was not inferior to the expensive rotten wine from the IMU winery that he had tasted before. It was even slightly better.

If Xia ruofei knew about Xu Lang’s comment, he would be overjoyed.

“Uncle Xu, what’s this expensive rotten wine?” Feng Rao asked curiously. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Xu lang did not put on any airs. He chuckled as he explained the origin of the expensive rot wine and introduced a few famous types of expensive rot wine in the world.

In the end, Xu lang said,”Mr. Xia’s noble rot wine is better than all the top noble rot wine I’ve ever had. Whether it’s the sweetness, taste, or aroma, it’s all close to perfection!” Just this bottle of wine is enough to make this trip worth it!”

Feng Rao and Liu Qian could not help but click their tongues. When Xu lang was introducing the expensive rotten wine, he said that a bottle of top – grade expensive rotten wine cost tens of thousands of Yuan. Not to mention that this bottle of wine was better than those top – grade expensive rotten wine, even if the quality was the same, it would still be impressive!

Liu Qian looked at the wine glass in front of her, then stuck out her tongue and said,””So this glass of wine costs one or two thousand? I just drank a few hundred Yuan in one gulp?”

“Almost ...” Xu lang laughed.

“Chairman, isn’t this too extravagant?” Liu Qian said with a bitter face. Can I return the wine to you and Exchange it for cash?”

Liu Qian’s antics made everyone overjoyed. Naturally, Xia ruofei was in a good mood. He smiled and asked,””You’ve already taken a sip, and you’re giving it back to me? Is this the rhythm of that indirect thing?”

Liu Qian’s face turned red. Feng Rao could not help but glance at Xia ruofei and said,”Chairman, don’t tease the little girl! Qianqian is embarrassed!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”she said it herself!” Liu Qian, do you still want to convert it to cash?”

Liu Qian quickly waved her hand and said,”no, no!” I’ll drink it myself!”

Everyone burst into laughter again.

Naturally, the meal was enjoyable for both the host and the guests. Whether it was the secret Buddha Jumps Over the Wall or the stunning top – grade noble rotten wine, they were all praised by the picky Xu lang, who repeatedly said that the trip was not in vain.

After the meal, Xia ruofei personally drove Xu lang and his assistant, ah Yuan, to the Shangri – La hotel that they had booked in advance.
