2499 On the hot search again_2

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but shiver and said,””Xiao Shi, please don’t speak in such a tone. I’m getting goosebumps!”

Dong Yun and the other five staff members who were watching the show laughed so hard that their bodies convulsed. The cabin was filled with everyone’s laughter.

Xia ruofei quickly found shi Wen’s Weibo and clicked on her main page.

Xia ruofei took a look and saw that shi wen had indeed posted two Weibo posts related to Taoyuan.

The first post was about the blue sky and white clouds at the airport, the appearance of peach origin, and the group photos taken in front of paradise. There was a short sentence attached. Immediately fly to Spain! And we’ll be taking the Chairman’s private plane. With such benefits, I just want to ask: Who else was there?

The second Weibo post was obviously just posted, and it was accompanied by photos of Paradise’s interior. There were exquisite leather aviation seats, shiny crystal lights, soft wool carpets, and a high – tech display screen ...

In this Weibo post, shi wen wrote: We just landed in Dubai to refuel, and now we are taking off again. Barcelona, we are here!

Shi wen had tagged the official Weibo account of Tao Yuan company and Xia ruofei’s Weibo account in both Weibo posts.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and reposted shi Wen’s first Weibo post with a short paragraph of text: A small team from the company recently completed a beautiful siege battle. In order to reward them, and since I’m going to Spain for business, I’ll take everyone on a vacation. It seemed that the girls and boys were already having fun before they even reached Barcelona!

Shi wen had been staring at her own Weibo. Once Xia ruofei’s post was posted, she received news that someone had tagged her. She didn’t have many Weibo fans and usually didn’t have any news backstage, so she saw it the moment Xia ruofei reposted it.

...

Shi wen opened the platform and saw that Xia ruofei had indeed reposted it. She said excitedly,”Chairman! Thank you! I’m sure I’ll have a big wave of fans this time!”

“Only one fan?” Xia ruofei teased,”my influence can’t be that bad, right?”

“Not one, I mean a big ...” Shi wen corrected.

At this point, shi wen suddenly reacted and her face heated up.”Chairman, you’re too evil! He actually ...”

Xia ruofei also felt that it was inappropriate to make such a perverted joke with a young lady. In fact, he had blurted it out without thinking too much.

To Xia ruofei’s surprise, shi Wen’s reaction was so fast.

Xia ruofei awkwardly scratched his head and said,””I must have heard it wrong ... The engine must have been too loud! It seems that the Gulfstream G650’s sound insulation is not very good!”

Dong Yun and the other employees knew that Xia ruofei was driving, so they all smiled knowingly.

Fortunately, Xia ruofei had his authority as the chairman, so no one exposed his explanation.

As for shi wen herself, her attention was not on this at all. In less than a minute after Xia ruofei reposted her Weibo, the number of views on her Weibo account was increasing rapidly. The comments below were also popping up like bamboo shoots after a rain. Moreover, there were constant notifications of new fans appearing in the background. It was too much for her to take in.

“Awesome!” Shi wen said excitedly,”Chairman, it’s only been a minute or two, but I’ve already gained hundreds of fans!”

...

“Look at you! What’s the big deal with a hundred fans?” Xia ruofei said with a smile. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“No! It had just been forwarded! The number of fans increased so quickly!” Shi wen said,”it’s still rising! And it’s even faster now, there’s no way to stop it!”

Shi Wen’s eyes did not leave the phone screen for even a second as she kept refreshing the background news.

Seeing this, Xia ruofei smiled and said,”take your time!” I really don’t understand ... So what if I have a lot of fans? Can it be eaten as food?”

“You’re a verified user with millions of fans, don’t attract hatred here!” Shi wen said without raising her head.

“Chairman, this wave of publicity is pretty good!” Dong Yun said with a smile. I think it’s very likely that it’ll make it to the hot search again! We’ve saved so much advertising fees this way!”

After all, Dong Yun was a senior executive in the company. Naturally, her perspective was different from that of a young lady like shi wen.

Although it was just a simple interaction with Xia ruofei, she keenly felt that this kind of down – to – Earth content might be what the netizens would like to see the most.

Let’s not talk about Xia ruofei’s previous Weibo post about magic. After all, the topic of ran ran was already ranked third on the hot search. It was already very popular. Just shi Wen’s Weibo post alone would definitely have a different effect if Xia ruofei reposted it.

It was a simple Weibo post, but it revealed a lot of information: First, the Paradise company’s benefits were very good. They would reward their employees with an overseas trip and even use the boss’s private plane to send them there. Second, Xia ruofei was a friendly boss and had good interaction with the ordinary employees. Third, the private jet was really beautiful and luxurious ...

Different people would have different interpretations of this Weibo post.

...

It was just that this Weibo post had just been posted, and it would take time for it to make it to the hot search.

However, with the popularity of the magic show, Xia ruofei’s Weibo post would definitely be more well – known than usual. In addition, Xia ruofei’s “hot search physique” made thousands of celebrities envious. It wouldn’t be long before he made it to the hot search list.

Shi wen was completely immersed in the joy of the rapid growth of her fans. The other employees also joined in the fun and started to scroll through Weibo and TikTok. Although the in – Flight WiFi speed was not very fast, it was much faster than some Commercial Airplanes that were equipped with Wi – Fi. After all, Commercial Airplanes often had hundreds of people sharing the same Wi – Fi, and there would never be so many people sharing the same WiFi on the peach source.

Xia ruofei sat with him, sipping red wine and chatting.

More than five hours passed by quickly.

Finally, the peach origin landed smoothly at the Barcelona Airport and slowly glided to the private jet parking spot.

Due to the time difference, it was only threeo’ clock in the afternoon in Spain.

Xia ruofei and the staff expressed their gratitude to the two captains for the long flight that lasted for 11 to 12 hours. It was a great test of the pilot’s physical strength.

The two pilots, Liu An and Zheng Daming, personally sent Xia ruofei and the others off the plane.

Xia ruofei took his login case from Zheng Daming’s hands and said,””Captain Liu, Captain Zheng, after you’re done with the follow – up matters, you should also go to the hotel to rest as soon as possible! We shouldn’t be returning so soon. You can have fun in Barcelona and wait for further notice!”

“Alright, President Xia. We’ll be on standby!” Liu An nodded and said.

...

At this time, a warm voice came from not far away,””President Xia! You’ve had a long journey!”

Xia ruofei looked up and realized that Zhou leiyun had come to the tarmac personally. There were two Mercedes – Benz MPVs parked not far away. It was obvious that Zhou leiyun had brought them over.

Xia ruofei quickly walked up to him and said,””Chief Zhou, why did you come to the airport in person? How can I accept this?”

Zhou leiyun laughed heartily and said,””President Xia, a friend from afar has come. Of course, I have to welcome him personally!”

Then, he frowned and looked at the young man beside him who had his head lowered. “Aren’t you going to greet the guest?”

The young man then raised his head somewhat unnaturally.

Only then did Xia ruofei see that the person who had his head buried in his chest was Zhou leiyun’s nephew, Zhou Yuan. This kid had probably been taught a lesson by Zhou leiyun recently. He no longer had the high – spirited attitude he had at the peach blossom Association. Instead, he was a little submissive.

“Good ... Good day, President Xia!” Zhou Yuan looked at Xia ruofei in fear and stuttered.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but secretly shake his head. Zhou leiyun was a little resentful towards this nephew of his for failing to live up to his expectations, and Zhou Yuan was obviously very afraid of Zhou leiyun. Under such pressure, how could Zhou Yuan be successful? The only result was that he was like this now. He was like a grandson in front of Zhou leiyun, but once he went out, he would be arrogant and domineering, afraid that people would not know that he was rich.

This emotion was like a spring. The more tightly it was suppressed by Zhou leiyun, the stronger the rebound after leaving Zhou leiyun’s side.

Xia ruofei could even somewhat understand this good – for – nothing second generation Zhou Yuan.

...

However, this was Zhou leiyun’s family matter, so Xia ruofei naturally would not meddle in it. He only lightly greeted Zhou Yuan.
