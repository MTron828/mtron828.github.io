2336 An unexpected surprise (2)

After some small talk, Xia ruofei sat down and examined song Qiming.

The external injuries were mainly fractures in several places. There was nothing much to say about that. Xia ruofei’s next stage of treatment would also focus on that.

He was mainly concerned about song Qiming’s soul and sea of consciousness. Therefore, after a simple examination of the external injuries, his mental power directly probed in the direction of song Qiming’s sea of consciousness.

Although the medicinal power of the heart – concentrating grass was strong, it was basically used up after a few days of absorption.

Xia ruofei realized that song Qiming’s sea of consciousness had almost recovered. The vigorous sea of consciousness was completely different from a few days ago when it was riddled with holes and filled with an aura of defeat. It was as if he had been reborn.

This made Xia ruofei feel at ease. Although the sea of consciousness had not fully recovered and the effect of the heart – concentrating grass had been used up, the remaining small part of the injury could slowly recover over time without any intervention. After all, the human body’s self – Recovery ability was very powerful.

Besides, Xia ruofei still had the spirit nourishment soup and the spirit pool water. They were enough to deal with the small damage.

Just as Xia ruofei felt a little relieved and was about to withdraw his spiritual power, he suddenly had a new discovery. He couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows and used his spiritual power to check carefully. Then, he withdrew his spiritual power and opened his eyes.

Song Qiming, Fang Liyun, and Song Wei had been paying attention to Xia ruofei’s expression. When they saw Xia ruofei open his eyes, Song Wei immediately asked,””RUO Fei, what’s the situation?”

Xia ruofei glanced at song Qiming and smiled.””You’re recovering well! It seemed that uncle song’s physique was very good! I’m more confident in the next stage of treatment. ”

“That’s good ...” Song Wei said as she looked at Xia ruofei.

Song Qiming also heaved a sigh of relief. He chuckled and said,””Ruofei, I’ll leave it to you!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”uncle song, we’ll start the treatment after lunch.” I’ve also made some preparations in advance these two days. Later, I’ll refine the treatment plan according to your specific situation. In general, it’s still acupuncture and external application to treat external injuries, and at the same time, you must take Chinese medicine to assist. ”

“Alright!” Song Qiming said,”your Auntie Fang has prepared a lot of good food. Let’s eat first!” Liyun and Weiwei, please give a toast to ruofei for me!”

“Let’s not drink for now. We’ll have a good drink after you’ve recovered, uncle song!”Xia ruofei quickly said.

Then, Xia ruofei said to Song Wei,””Song Wei, I still have some things in my car, come with me!”

“Alright!” Song Wei said.

Xia ruofei nodded at song Qiming and left the room with Song Wei.

When the two of them went downstairs, Song Wei suddenly asked,””Ruofei, I saw your strange expression just now. Could it be that my father ...”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.”Our Wei Wei is quite observant! That’s right, uncle song’s situation is beyond my expectations ...”

When Song Wei heard that, she could not help but exclaim. Then, she asked impatiently, “What’s wrong?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”don’t worry!” It was not a bad thing and it would not affect his recovery. It’s just that ... It’s really a little unexpected ...”

Song Wei could not help but hit Xia ruofei and said,””Why are you still keeping me in suspense? What’s going on?”

Xia ruofei thought for a moment and said,””Wei Wei, do you remember what I told you before? Uncle song was unconscious at the time. His condition was very similar to the time you came out of the ancient tomb on Mount Yu. ”

“Of course I remember, and you also concluded that his sea of consciousness was damaged!” Song Wei said.

“Yup! I’ve tried a more conventional treatment, but it didn’t work. ” Xia ruofei said,”in the end, I had to pay a price and use a precious medicinal herb. This herb is the same as the one I gave you, but the effect is quite good. Uncle song woke up that day ...”

“I know that you must have paid a huge price to wake my father up.” Song Wei said gently.

“That’s not the main point,”Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Then what are you trying to say?” Song Wei asked in confusion.

“Think carefully,” Xia ruofei reminded.”What changes have you undergone since you woke up?”

When Song Wei heard this, she came back to her senses and an idea flashed through her mind. She could not help but ask,”Ruofei, you’re not trying to say...My dad can also ...”

“That’s right!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”when I was checking uncle song just now, I noticed the changes in his body. To be more precise, his affinity to Reiki had greatly increased, and his soul had also become much stronger. If he was 30 years younger, he would definitely be able to achieve great things on the path of cultivation!”

“Heavens! “This is unbelievable ...” Song Wei covered her mouth as she spoke, her eyes filled with disbelief.

Song Wei was no longer completely clueless about the path of cultivation. At least, she knew that there were not many people with the physique to cultivate. It could be said that 90% of them were ordinary people. Only a small number of people could go far on the path of cultivation because of their strong affinity with spiritual Qi and the strength of their souls.

Otherwise, he wouldn’t even be able to cross the threshold of cultivation.

Song Qiming’s ability to cultivate after being severely injured was like winning the lottery.

Xia ruofei smiled.”I don’t know the reason either. The herb I used can indeed improve the user’s cultivation talent, but the extent won’t be so great. Besides, many people don’t have obvious effects after taking it.”

Back then, in order to forcefully change Ling Qingxue’s talent and let her embark on the path of cultivation, Xia ruofei had also tried to use the heart – concentrating herb. In the end, the effect was not obvious the first time he used it. Later on, he had to grit his teeth and continue to cultivate the heart – concentrating herb at a high price. After another try, Ling Qingxue’s physique had completely improved.

Xia ruofei paused and continued,””I think it might have something to do with uncle song’s injury. He was injured on his head, and according to my examination, his sea of consciousness was severely damaged. His soul was completely sealed off for self – Protection. The repair of his sea of consciousness seems to be very suitable for the situation of destruction and reconstruction. In short, this kind of small probability event just happened like that ...”

Hearing this, Ling Qingxue’s eyes flashed with anticipation. She couldn’t help but ask,””Ruofei, do you think it’s possible for my father to cultivate?”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,””I can’t say for sure. After all, he’s too young to be a cultivator. He’s already missed the best time to cultivate. I think he won’t have much energy left even if he cultivates ...”

“Is that so ...” Song Wei said, slightly disappointed.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Weiwei, don’t be disappointed.” Nothing is absolute! But we’ll talk about this later. The most important thing now is to let uncle song recover!”

“What you said makes sense!” Song Wei said,”I was too greedy. Given my dad’s condition, it’s already a blessing from our ancestors that he could keep his life.”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”after the treatment is over, I’ll pick a suitable martial art for uncle song and find a suitable opportunity to teach him!” Don’t worry! I have quite a few cultivation techniques, so I’ll be able to find a suitable one for uncle song. But before that, don’t mention this to him!” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“I understand!” Song Wei smiled and said,”even if I tell him now, he won’t believe me!”

“Yes, I am!” Xia ruofei said.

As they were talking, the two of them had already arrived at the courtyard downstairs. Xia ruofei opened the trunk of the Knight XV. Song Wei took a look and couldn’t help but say,””You ... Why did you bring so many things? did you move your entire house here?”
