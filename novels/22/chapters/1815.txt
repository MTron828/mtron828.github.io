Chapter 1816: The heart – condensing grass ripened (1)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei’s last gift was an abalone.

It was obviously not an ordinary abalone, because there was only one heavy dry abalone in such a large vacuum package. It weighed more than 600 grams and was a one – Head abalone.

Xu lang took in a breath of cold air and said,””Mr. Xia, I’ll take the wine and pomfrets, but this one – headed abalone is too expensive. You’d better take it!”

The last time it was auctioned in Hong Kong, the cheapest one, Bao Cheng, was sold for nearly three million Hong Kong dollars. It was indeed quite precious.

Speaking of which, Xu Lang’s pay for reading Feng Shui for the rich in Hong Kong was also very high. Although it was not as high as three million Hong Kong dollars every time and it was not as simple as the three mountains trip, it was still very common for him to be paid one or two million Hong Kong dollars.

Of course, it was one thing to do things for money, but it was another thing to do it out of friendship.

This time, Xu lang did not intend to accept Xia ruofei’s reward. Now that the money was confiscated, he felt that it was inappropriate for Xia ruofei to give him a gift that was worth more than the normal reward.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”uncle Xu, this is a token of my appreciation. If you don’t accept it ... Then I really don’t dare to ask for your help next time!” Also, our capital’s peach blossom Association doesn’t dare to trouble you to take action ...”

Xu lang smiled bitterly and said,”Mr. Xia, even if I’m just looking at Feng Shui normally, I don’t charge that much!” Your company’s one – headed abalone is very famous in Hong Kong. I know that at the Hengfeng auction last time, such a one – headed abalone could not be bought without three million Hong Kong dollars. ”

Xia ruofei shrugged.”As you said, this is only the auction price. This abalone is a product sold by my company. The cost is far from that high. It’s just that the rarer something is, the more expensive it is!”

Then, Xia ruofei continued,”besides ... Didn’t you just say that we were friends?” Since we’re friends, there’s no need to be so calculative! It’s only natural for friends to be rich. Just take it as a visit between friends. The fruit trees in my house just happened to be ripe, so when you went back, I picked some fruits for you ... In fact, that’s the nature of it!”

Although Xia ruofei’s analogy was very vivid, how could ordinary fruits be compared to the precious one – headed abalone?

Even though Xia ruofei had repeatedly emphasized that 3000000 Hong Kong dollars was only the auction price, the problem was that this was a seller’s market. There was no market for one – headed abalone. If Xia ruofei wanted to, he could exchange the one – headed abalone for at least 3000000 Hong Kong dollars in a minute.

Xu lang thought for a moment and said,”Mr. Xia, this is really too expensive ... If you treat me with this abalone, I’ll accept it shamelessly. But if you give it to me directly ...”

Xia ruofei said meaningfully,”uncle Xu, you’re treating me like an outsider!” If we were to calculate it that clearly, then uncle Xu’s words at our paradise society’s foundation laying ceremony would be worth more than 3 million Hong Kong dollars. This is this Junior’s little token of appreciation, you can accept it with a peace of mind!”

At the groundbreaking ceremony, Xu lang took the initiative to stand up for the peach blossom society and praised that piece of land to the heavens, instantly dispelling the negative effects brought about by the previous rumors.

Although what Xu lang said was the truth, his status in the field of metaphysics was transcendent. His words were equivalent to an advertisement for the Paradise society. If one were to really count, even if Xia ruofei and the others took out three million HxB to promote it, it would definitely not be as effective as Xu Lang’s words.

“I’m just telling the truth, Xia ...”Xu lang said.

Xia ruofei interrupted Xu lang and said,”Uncle Xu, let’s stop pushing it around! At most, you can treat me to a big meal the next time I go to Hong Kong! Courtesy demands reciprocity! If you delay any longer, you’ll miss your flight! In any case, if you don’t accept it today, don’t even think about leaving the three mountains!”

Then, Xia ruofei put the one – headed abalone into the thermal container and handed it to ah Yuan.””Let’s go! We still have to handle the shipping of fresh food! We’re a little tight on time!”

Seeing Xia ruofei’s firm attitude, Xu lang could only say,””Alright! Thank you, Mr. Xia ... I’ll accept it!”

“That’s the way!” Xia ruofei was all smiles.

The reason why Xia ruofei gave such a precious gift was that he did not want to owe anyone a favor. On the other hand, he wanted to be on good terms with Xu lang. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Furthermore, this one – Head abalone might seem precious, but to Xia ruofei, he could get it whenever he wanted. Especially now that he had the time array flag, which was combined with the power of the Archean realm, allowing time to flow 2000 times faster, he could “ripen” the abalone in a short time.

The abalones in the space ocean would continue to reproduce, and the “raw materials” would be inexhaustible. Hence, to Xia ruofei, one – Head abalones were really nothing.

The three of them left the parking lot and walked into the airport lobby.

A ‘Yuan quickly got the boarding pass. At the same time, she packed the fresh seafood in the thermal container and the two bottles of expensive rot wine into the thermal container.

Xia ruofei waited for Xu lang and a ‘Yuan to pass through the security check before waving goodbye to them. Then, he turned around and left the airport.

Back in the Knight XV SUV, Xia ruofei started the engine and communicated with Xia Qing using his divine sense,””Xia Qing, how’s the nurturing of the heart concentrating grass?”
