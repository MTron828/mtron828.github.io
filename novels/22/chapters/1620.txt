Chapter 1621: Heart to heart (1)

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment. He did not expect elder song to ask this question.

To be more precise, Xia ruofei did not expect elder song to be such a gossiper.

Furthermore, there was only one possibility for elder song to have heard of this news. It was his eldest son, song Zhengping, who had informed him of this.

At this moment, Xia ruofei was speechless. One of you is a well – respected leader of the older generation, and the other is a political star and a high – ranking official. Even if it’s a conversation between father and son, shouldn’t it be about national affairs? What was there to talk about this kind of gossip between the younger generation?

However, Xia ruofei was only dazed for a moment. Elder song was still waiting for his answer with a smile! Naturally, he could not be too impolite.

So Xia ruofei quickly organized his words in his mind and said,””Grandpa song, I did go to Xiang Nan Province with Song Wei after Chinese New Year, but it wasn’t what you guys think ... There’s nothing between me and Song Wei ...”

Elder song laughed and pointed at Xia ruofei,””You! I didn’t say anything about you and Song Wei! If you explain so quickly, it will only make things worse!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel embarrassed. Elder song smiled and said,””RUO Fei! If this was in the early years, it wouldn’t be strange for a young man like you to have three wives and four concubines. The policy doesn’t allow it now, but you’re not married yet, are you?”

Xia ruofei was a little shocked. He did not know what elder song meant by that.

Before Xia ruofei could reply, elder song said with a smile,””It’s fine for young men and women to admire each other, but you can’t play with a girl’s feelings! Especially Song Wei, she’s Qiming’s precious daughter. If something were to happen, even I wouldn’t be able to persuade Qiming ...”

Xia ruofei quickly said,”don’t worry!” Why would I play with Song Wei’s feelings ... No! Grandpa song, you’re trying to beat around the bush! There’s nothing between Song Wei and me, we’re not even together!”

“It doesn’t matter if you’re together or not. I’m just giving you a reminder. Old people can’t help but nag a little!”

“I understand, Grandpa song. I will remember your words!” Xia ruofei said seriously.

Xia ruofei was not an ungrateful person. He knew that elder song was really thinking for him.

And to be honest, from elder song’s words just now, he was actually very tolerant in this aspect. He even indulged Yingluo and even said that he had multiple wives.

Elder song had experienced that era. Of course, elder song had nothing to say to Xia ruofei.

Elder song’s grandchildren were not around him. Even those in the capital were in awe of him. They would not come if they could. Song Rui was one such example.

Xia ruofei, on the other hand, was able to remain calm in front of him. He was not as cautious as song Rui and the others. This was rare among the younger generation, so elder song naturally liked him.

“I don’t think it’s teaching, just chit – chatting,” replied eccentric song with a chuckle.

Xia ruofei chatted with elder song for a while before manager Lu came over and said,””Chief, dinner is ready. Is it?”

“Alright!” Elder song stood up and said. Then let’s go eat first!”

Although elder song was already in his 30s, he still walked with a majestic gait. He led the way, followed by Xia ruofei and manager Lu. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Manager Lu looked enviously at the overly young man sitting beside him and having dinner with the Bureau chief. This was not an honor that everyone had. Only song Rui, the son of the song family’s first wife, and others had such treatment.

Of course, song Rui didn’t think that it was an honor. Elder song’s presence made him feel like he was losing his appetite.

Elder song’s mood was obviously much better when he heard that Xia ruofei would be coming today. He even specially asked the staff to add a few more dishes for dinner. To manager Lu, this was a huge favor!

The group of people came to the dining room set up in the back wing. The staff had already served the prepared food on the table.

“Come, come, come, sit anywhere you like!” Elder song chuckled and said,”Xiao Lu, you sit down and eat too!”

“Thank you, chief!” Manager Lu said with a smile.

As an employee of elder song, it was common for him to eat at the same table as the chief. He couldn’t just sit with elder song and Xia ruofei while he, a Minister, waited on them, right?

After elder song sat down, Xia ruofei and manager Lu took their seats on either side of him.

Elder song turned to the waiter and said,”Xiao Qi, go and open the bottle of Drunken Eight Immortals that RUO Fei gave me last time. I want to drink two cups today!”

“Yes, chief!” Xiao Qi said and quickly went to prepare the white wine.

Elder song laughed,”ruofei is really capable!” Let’s not talk about other things, just this white wine that your company is operating really suits my taste!”

“Grandpa song, if you like it, I’ll send you some more later!” Xia ruofei smiled.

“No need, no need! I don’t like wine!” Elder song waved his hand and said,”I’m happy that you’re here today, so I only drank a few glasses. I usually follow the doctor’s advice and hardly drink! This Xiao Lu can be my witness!”
