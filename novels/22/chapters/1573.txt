Chapter 1574: Another wave of earnings_1

Translator: 549690339

Jade Street wasn’t far from the hotel. They soon arrived at the scene of the public Jade bid.

It was Song Wei’s first time seeing so many raw jadeite stones. In her eyes, these old raw stones were no different from ordinary stones, and the prices were all terrifyingly high. She couldn’t help but be a little speechless.

“RUO Fei, this stone has a starting price of a few hundred thousand. Is there really someone who wants to buy it?” Song Wei could not help but ask.

Yu mingdong laughed and said,””Miss song, a few hundred thousand Yuan is considered cheap here. Yesterday, Mr. Xia bought a raw material. Can you guess how much he spent?”

“How much?”

“Eight million six hundred thousand!” Yu mingdong said with a smile.

Song Wei took a deep breath and looked at Xia ruofei.””I know you’re rich, but I didn’t expect you to be so rich ...”

“Since I’m here, of course I’ll buy two to play with ...” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Yu mingdong asked,”miss song, although Mr. Xia doesn’t play much in stone gambling, his luck makes us very envious!” Guess how much Mr. Xia’s raw material was sold for after it was cut out?”

“Ten million?” Song Wei tried to guess a number. She felt that she was bold enough.

“Haha!” Yu mingdong laughed and said,”this number is five times more, and it’s not just that!”

“What?” Song Wei cried out,”more than 50 million? Who’s so stupid! Wasn’t this raw stone for bidding? Wouldn’t it be better to just spend one or two million to compete?”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but burst out laughing.

Yu mingdong’s expression was a little strange, as if he was constipated.

“Miss song, that stupid person ... Is me ...” He said with a bitter smile after a while.

Song Wei was also stunned. Then, she said in embarrassment, “I’m sorry, Mr. Yu, I was just saying. I didn’t expect you to ...”

Yu mingdong waved his hand and said,””Mr. Xia even gave me a friendly price! There were a lot of people competing for it, and I have to thank Mr. Xia for buying that piece of top – grade Jade for 50 to 60 million Yuan!”

He then explained,”the value of a piece of Jade is transparent after it is cut out, but who can guarantee that there is Jade inside when it is still a raw stone?” In fact, Mr. Xia’s price was already higher than expected. Even if I were to bid, it might not exceed seven million, so ...”

Song Wei looked at Xia ruofei in surprise and smiled,””RUO Fei, I didn’t expect you to have such a skill. Then why don’t you just stop running a farm? how much money do you make?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it’s pure luck!” If we’re really talking about stone gambling, I can’t even compare to brother Shi Lei ...”

“I hope Mr. Xia can continue to have good luck today. I can also benefit from it ...” Yu mingdong said with a smile. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“I hope so! However, don’t get your hopes up, President Yu. ” Xia ruofei said,”the goddess of luck can’t just take care of me forever.”

“Mr. Xia, shall we ... Split up and look?” Yu mingdong asked.

On the last day of the public auction, the number of raw stones was fewer than the previous batch. However, some raw stones that the organizer was more optimistic about were left for the finale. Therefore, Yu mingdong naturally wanted to take a good look. Yingluo was different from Xia ruofei, who had “good luck”.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded,”okay!” Song Wei and I are just here to watch the show. Mr. Yu, please make your choice. You have more than enough money now anyway. ”

“Hahaha! That’s all thanks to you!” Yu mingdong said happily.

The group split up. Yu mingdong didn’t hire another stone gambling consultant. He brought Shi Lei and personally began to choose the raw stones. Meanwhile, Xia ruofei and Song Wei were strolling around the venue and picking raw stones.

The last batch of raw stones would be displayed for a day and a half. The bidding would end at noon the next day, so Xia ruofei was not in a hurry. He seemed to be wandering aimlessly, but in fact, he was trying to look at every single raw stone.

With Xia ruofei’s current memory, he could remember some raw gemstones that performed well without the help of notes.

Therefore, this afternoon would be a rough screening. The real decision would be made tomorrow morning.

After watching for a while, Song Wei started to feel bored.

After all, for people who didn’t know anything about stone gambling, it was boring to see so many people surrounding stones that looked similar, looking and touching them.

Xia ruofei saw this and laughed. “Don’t look down on these black stones, they may contain beautiful jadeite! You can never judge a person by their appearance. You can’t judge a person by their appearance!”

Xia ruofei touched a raw stone beside him casually and continued,””The Doraemon pendant you’re wearing right now, the Jade used was found on this public bid yesterday. Before it was revealed, it was hidden in this seemingly ordinary stone!”

Song Wei could not help but pull out the Doraemon jade pendant from her clothes. After looking at it for a while, she said,”Although I know that there might be Jade in the raw stones, otherwise people wouldn’t be so eager to get it, I still can’t believe that such beautiful jade was actually extracted from such black stones ...”
