3141 Breakthrough point?_

Xia ruofei said calmly,”it’s not necessarily that optimistic. First of all; the supercomputer is only responsible for calculations; we have to build our own models and databases to crack the password; otherwise, even with the supercomputer; it can’t help us solve it out of thin air; In addition, supercomputers are generally found in large national scientific research institutions or large technology companies. The time of supercomputers has always been very tight, and we may not be able to coordinate it. There’s also the issue of confidentiality. Whether this token is called the five Saints token or the rising Dragon Token, even in the cultivation world, we should keep our mouths shut. Otherwise, it will inevitably cause a great uproar. As for the secular world, we can’t reveal it. ”

Mu Sheng and Liu Mansha could not understand the part about supercomputers that Xia ruofei had mentioned. However, they agreed with the third point that he had mentioned.

“Fellow Daoist Xia is right,” Liu Mansha said directly,”no matter what method we use to crack it, the premise is that we must ensure that the secret won’t be leaked out. Otherwise, it will definitely cause a great uproar in the cultivation world!”

Chen Xuan nodded his head,”brother Xia is right, but at least we have a direction to go in!” We’ll just solve the problems you mentioned one by one. ”

Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”the timing is not a problem. I know some influential friends in the secular world. I can ask them to help coordinate it. It should be fine.” However, How do I build the mathematical model to crack the floating point password? Which Chinese characters should he choose? What were their weights? We have to solve these problems ourselves. We can’t let others do it. ”

“Brother Xia,” Chen Xuan said,”we can learn! I know a little about Computer Science, and I believe you know a lot too. Compared to the ordinary people in the secular world, our greatest advantage is that we can learn knowledge quickly and have a strong ability to understand. I believe that it won’t take too much time to solve these problems. At least, it’s faster than us calculating with the human brain!”

“That’s true ...” Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.”But don’t forget, all of this is based on my previous deduction that each floating point represents a word! If I’m wrong, then all our work will be for nothing. ”

“Research is a process of constant trial and error!” Chen Xuan replied nonchalantly,”besides, this won’t take up too much of our time. I think it’s completely worth it! What do you think, seniors?”

Liu Mansha and Mu Sheng also nodded without hesitation. The two of them said in unison,””I completely agree!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh. He stood up and said,””Since everyone has the same opinion, let’s give it a try!”

In fact, Xia ruofei was inclined to this judgment.

Compared to the cultivators of the present, the nascent soul and primordial spirit stage experts in the ancient cultivation world were much stronger in all aspects of cultivation. If they couldn’t crack the code, how could the cultivators of the modern cultivation world do it?

Xia ruofei felt that the only way to find a difference was from the speed of calculation.

He believed that even the nascent soul and immortal soul Stage cultivators in the ancient cultivation world would be crushed by the Super computer in terms of computing speed!

Perhaps, their cracking work this time could really use modern technology to find a breakthrough!

Xia ruofei looked at the token on the table and pondered for a while before saying,””Two seniors, brother Chen, I think the first thing we need to do is to scan this floating point image, and it must be done with extremely high – definition scanning equipment!”

Mu Sheng also stroked his beard and laughed.”Nephew Chen is right. We didn’t have any clue before. But now, at least we have a research direction.”

Liu Mansha’s expression was somewhat excited as she said,”Fellow Daoist Xia’s discovery has indeed allowed us to take a big step towards the truth! If we continue to research in this direction, we might be able to make a breakthrough soon!”

Xia ruofei saw how excited everyone was and wanted to pour cold water on them.

The black dots on the surface of the floating point sphere might be undetectable to ordinary people, but under the detection of a cultivator’s spiritual power, they were completely undetectable. Xia ruofei didn’t believe that the nascent soul or even the immortal soul Stage cultivators in the ancient cultivation world wouldn’t notice it.

Such an obvious clue, yet they were unable to make any substantial discoveries. What did this mean?

It meant that it would not be easy to decipher the content of the floating point.

Furthermore, Xia ruofei had some basic knowledge of cryptography during his military service. From a cryptography point of view, even if Xia ruofei’s guess was correct, each floating point represented a word. The black spots on the surface of the floating Points corresponded to different words according to the style of the different sections. It was extremely difficult to decipher the meaning of the floating Points based on these.

Over three thousand Floating Points were equivalent to over three thousand samples.

And some of them were repeated.

They could start with these repeated Floating Points and list out the possible words. Then, they could make an arrangement according to the level of the possibility and replace these Floating Points with the corresponding words. Then, together with the context, they could deduce the words represented by the other Floating Points.

This was a process of constant trial and error and constant trial and error.

In theory, the first step was the most difficult. As more and more Floating Points were deciphered, the speed of cracking the later steps would also become faster and faster. This was because there would be more Floating Points converted into context as a reference. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

No matter what, the amount of calculation required was an astronomical figure.

Xia ruofei made some speculations and finally understood why the ancient cultivation world had been unable to produce any results after 50 years of research.

“Two seniors, brother Chen, I’m afraid things aren’t as simple as they seem. There are countless possibilities to deduce the content of more than 3000 words from these Floating Points alone. To try all of these possibilities, it might take decades. ”

Mu Sheng found it unbelievable and said,””Little brother Xia, I don’t think it’s that exaggerated! It’s only a total of three thousand plus Floating Points!”

Mu Sheng thought from the perspective of a golden core stage cultivator. Because they had strong spiritual power and high brain development, their thinking speed was much faster than ordinary people. He felt that it wouldn’t take long to try it word by word.

Three to five years would be the maximum!

How could it be impossible to complete it in decades?

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”sect leader mu, let me give you an example.” Currently, there are about two to three thousand Chinese characters that are commonly used. If it is the ones that are used more frequently, there are at least one to two hundred of them. In other words, even if he only checked for high – frequency Chinese characters, there were one to two hundred possibilities for these Floating Points that had appeared many times. And for every single floating point deciphered, we will have to multiply it by two to three thousand. In addition, we will have to take into account the age of this token and the difference between the words of that time and the words of today ... The final amount of calculation may be beyond our imagination!”

“Uncle mu, brother Xia is right,” Chen Xuan added. I’ve heard that some organizations in the secular world that study code – cracking use super – computers with extremely fast computing speed to do their work because it’s completely human ...”

Suddenly, Chen Xuan stopped and looked at Xia ruofei. Both of their eyes lit up and they shouted in unison,””Supercomputers!”

“What chicken? Wasn’t chicken supposed to be eaten? How can you help us solve the secret of the token?” Mu Sheng was confused.

Mu Sheng did not know much about the secular world, and he was not interested in modern technology.

In comparison, his son Mu Jianfei was still a young man, so he was more or less familiar with the secular world.
