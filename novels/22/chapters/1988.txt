1989 Departure (1)

Not only in China, but in most places in the world, the rich always had more convenience than ordinary people, and Hong Kong airport was no exception.

Xia ruofei and Cheng Xiaoxiao quickly went through the relevant procedures and finished the security check. In fact, the security check was basically just a formality. If you took your own plane, people wouldn’t care what you brought. Anyway, it wouldn’t endanger the safety of others.

Captain Liu An had already been waiting on the tarmac with the crew.

When Cheng Xiaoxiao saw the luxurious Gulfstream G650 business jet, she couldn’t help but let out an envious exclamation. Then, she directly threw down her suitcase and took out her mobile phone to take a series of photos.

Liu An and the others had already received Xia ruofei’s advance notice and knew that there was a new passenger today, so they didn’t stop Cheng Xiaoxiao. Even when Cheng Xiaoxiao raised her phone to take a selfie with Liu An, who was wearing the captain’s uniform, Liu An smiled cooperatively.

“Xiaoxiao, let’s board the plane!” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but say.

“Oh!” Cheng Xiaoxiao stuck out her tongue and said a little embarrassedly,”President Xia, it’s my first time sitting in a business jet, so I’m a little excited.”

Xia ruofei laughed.”It’s okay. If you’re not in a hurry, you can do whatever you want!”

Xia ruofei also knew that Cheng Xiaoxiao would definitely post the photos on Weibo and Tieba after taking them, but he didn’t care about these things now that he was in debt.

Moreover, the loyalty of the fans on the forum was very high. These fans really liked Xia ruofei, and Cheng Xiaoxiao was a typical representative. Xia ruofei felt that there was no need to cover himself up in front of these fans.

After boarding the plane, Cheng Xiaoxiao was like a grandmother entering a Grand View Garden. What was commendable was that she didn’t hide her envy at all and took photos of the luxurious interior and various advanced facilities in the cabin in surprise, not caring if others would laugh at her for being a country bumpkin in their hearts.

It wasn’t until the plane was pushed out and taxied in the direction of the runway that Cheng Xiaoxiao sat down in the wide and soft leather seat and fastened her seat belt.

The plane waited at the runway for a few minutes before taxiing again. Captain Liu An also reported to Xia ruofei through the cabin broadcast that the plane had been approved to take off.

The Gulfstream G650 plane nimbly turned around at the end of the runway and aimed at the center line of the runway.

After a slight pause, the plane began to accelerate rapidly on the runway.

The plane’s speed was getting faster and faster, and then everyone felt their feet sink. The plane had already glided up lightly and continued to climb into the sky.

After about 20 minutes of climbing, the plane finally entered a cruising altitude far higher than that of a civilian airliner and began a level flight.

The flight attendants of the cabin crew also started to serve Xia ruofei and Cheng Xiaoxiao.

As it was not mealtime, the crew mainly provided drinks and some fine desserts.

Xia ruofei was not in the mood to eat, so he only asked for a glass of red wine.

He had ordered a lot of food for Cheng Xiaoxiao.

Cheng Xiaoxiao maintained a strong curiosity throughout the whole process, constantly taking pictures here and there with her mobile phone. Sometimes, she would even shoot the sea of clouds below the plane through the porthole that was much larger than ordinary commercial flights.

After the exquisite food was served, Cheng Xiaoxiao’s first thought wasn’t to eat, but to take pictures.

She wanted to record as much of this wonderful journey as possible and share it with Xia ruofei’s fans.

Xia ruofei kept thinking about Monica and didn’t talk much to Cheng Xiaoxiao.

Cheng Xiaoxiao knew her limits and didn’t disturb Xia ruofei. She just enjoyed the journey alone.

The flight from Hong Kong to San Shan was not long, and the Gulfstream business plane’s cruising speed was much faster than ordinary commercial planes. So, after more than an hour, the plane had begun to descend.

Cheng Xiaoxiao was still a little unsatisfied even when the plane landed lightly on the runway of Sanshan airport and began taxiing.

When they got off the plane, Xia ruofei said to Liu An,””Captain Liu, I might have to trouble you to fly to Beijing for the next two days. After that, you can rest for a while.”

“Please don’t be so polite, President Xia!” Liu An quickly said. This is our job! If there’s anything you need, you can just let me know in advance. ”

In terms of work intensity, Liu An and the others were already countless times more relaxed than Civil Aviation pilots.

They had only flown such a short distance for several days, while Civil Aviation pilots had to fly several take – off and landings a day. The former could be said to be an enjoyment of flying, while the latter was really very hard.

Xia ruofei patted Liu An’s shoulder and said,””I’ll let you know in advance. You guys be prepared.”

After they left the airport, Cheng Xiaoxiao politely declined Xia ruofei’s offer to send her back to the city and went to take the airport bus.

Xia ruofei did not force him. He got into Lei Hu’s Knight XV SUV and returned to the farm.

On the way back to the farm, Xia ruofei could see some engineering vehicles already working. That piece of land was where the head of Taoyuan pharmaceuticals was divided into two factories. Of course, a part of it was reserved for the expansion of the farm. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Xia ruofei was surprised,”they’re already entering the venue?” You’re quite efficient!”

“Brother Xia, it’s been lively since yesterday. I heard from factory manager Xue that the Changping government is very supportive of us. The land acquisition was handled by them officially, and it was settled very quickly!” Lei Hu said with a smile.
