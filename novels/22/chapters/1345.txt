Chapter 1346: This is the three mountains (2)

Translator: 549690339

Thus, Tian Xiaojun quickly calmed himself down.

He looked at Xia ruofei and said,”Mr. Xia, isn’t this a little too much?” Xia Ling’s tone was just a little harsh, and you hurt him like this? Is there still any law?”

Xia ruofei sneered.”When I was talking to you about the law, you were being shameless. Now that I’ve taught a piece of trash a lesson, you’re talking to me about the law?” So the law is your house’s trash can? Open it whenever you want to use it?”

“General manager Xia, aren’t you afraid that we’ll call the police and Sue you for intentional assault?” Tian Xiaojun said with a dark expression.

Xia ruofei smiled brightly and said,””Deputy Director Tian, this is San Shan ...”

Tian Xiaojun coldly snorted and said,”This is indeed the three mountains, but the three mountains are not outside the law. These are the three mountains of Huaxia!”

When Tian Xiaojun heard Xia ruofei’s words, he was even more certain that he was relying on song Qiming’s daughter, Song Wei. He was furious.

If Song Wei really wanted to protect Xia ruofei, he could not do anything to Xia ruofei with Xia Ling’s injuries.

As for the “three mountains of China,” he was just saying it for show.

Xia ruofei did not even bother to respond to such childish words. He just smiled and shrugged.

Tian Xiaojun knew that there was no point in staying any longer.

He could not do anything to Xia ruofei at San Shan, but when he returned to the capital, he would have a way to deal with a small company in the local area.

After making up his mind, Tian Xiaojun looked deeply at Xia ruofei and said,”President Xia, in that case, we’ll take our leave first! I hope that Tao Yuan company will always be so smooth – sailing ...”

“Don’t worry, Deputy Director Tian, I will. ” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Tian Xiaojun coldly snorted and said with a dark face, “I’m sure CEO Xia will take the initiative to talk to us about financing soon, but by then, 51% of the shares will not be enough ...”

He didn’t wait for Xia ruofei’s reply and said to Zhong Zixin and Xia Tian,””Let’s go!”

Tian Xiaojun strode out of the private room. Zhong Zixin and Xia Ling glared at Xia ruofei hatefully before quickly following him.

Liu Zhe cupped his hands at Xia ruofei and smiled apologetically. He did not say much and turned to chase after Tian Xiaojun. No matter what, he had to receive Tian Xiaojun well. Otherwise, with Tian Xiaojun’s vengeful personality, he might cause some trouble.

The lively private room was suddenly empty, leaving only Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue.

“RUO Fei, will these people cause you trouble?” Ling Qingxue asked, a little worried.

Xia ruofei laughed,”silly girl, do you think I’m someone who can be bullied by others?” It’s already good enough that I didn’t find trouble with them, and they still dare to find trouble with me?”

In fact, Xia ruofei would not let the three of them go so easily. However, Liu Zhe had sent him a very detailed message with their names and backgrounds. They could run but not their temple. Otherwise, Xia ruofei would not have let them go.

Ling Qingxue was still a little worried. She said,””These people all have powerful backgrounds in Beijing. If they really want to cause trouble for the Paradise Corporation, I’m afraid ...” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Xia ruofei put his arm around Ling Qingxue’s shoulder and said,””Wife, you don’t have to worry about this. I know what to do. A few little brats can’t turn the world upside down! It’s not like we don’t know anyone in Beijing, right?”

“Stronger than them?” Ling Qingxue asked.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.”We’re not on the same level at all. So, don’t worry!”

“Oh ... Then I don’t care. It’s good that you’re confident,” Ling Qingxue said, sticking out her tongue.

......

Tian Xiaojun and the other two walked through the courtyard angrily and left, ignoring Liu Zhe who was following them.

At this moment, a lady from the opposite side led three people over. The Ling’s private kitchen’s backyard was designed to be a winding path, and the roads were relatively narrow. If someone were to walk in front of them, they would have to turn slightly to avoid each other.

Tian Xiaojun’s heart was burning with anger, and he could not help but raise his head and glare at the hostess.

However, when he saw the person behind the welcoming lady, his eyelids couldn’t help but Twitch, and the bitter hatred on his face instantly turned into an almost flattering smile.

“Young master hou! What a coincidence! You’ve come to the three mountains as well?” Tian Xiaojun quickly stepped to the side. He wished he could stand in the middle of the flowerbed and make way for them.

The person opposite him was Hou Liang. Beside him was Wei Jun, the son of Wei Jianming from Tongren Hall.

Hou Liang looked at Tian Xiaojun with a puzzled expression. He felt that this guy looked somewhat familiar, but he could not remember where he had seen him before.

Tian Xiaojun quickly introduced himself,”young master hou, I’m Tian Xiaojun from the state – owned assets Supervision and Administration Commission!” My father is Tian Xudong from the housing and construction department!”

Hou Liang was still a little confused. If it was a leader from a large Ministry, Hou Liang would at least know his name. However, Tian Xiaojun’s father was only a Secretary. Hou Liang only felt that the name sounded familiar, but he still couldn’t match it with the person.

“Liang bro, Tian Xiaojun’s father is the Secretary of the xxx division in the Ministry of Housing and Construction ...” Wei Jun said.

“Yes, yes, yes!” Tian Xiaojun quickly said,”young master Wei, we even drank together the last time ...”

Tian Xiao Jun was quite envious of Wei Jun. One had to know that Wei Jun had been in a similar circle to him in the past, and they had often crossed paths.

However, Wei Jun had managed to cling onto a powerful backer. Everyone knew that he was close to Hou Liang. Even when Hou Liang went out to the capital to do business, he brought Wei Jun along. It was obvious that Wei Jun had already gradually mixed into Hou Liang’s circle.

What Tian Xiaojun did not know was that Wei Jun had been able to be accepted by Hou Liang and the others so quickly because he had helped Xia ruofei.

At this moment, another young man beside Hou Liang chuckled and said,””Liangzi, you need to learn more. Director Tian has quite a bit of influence in the Ministry of Housing and Construction ...”

This young man had been standing behind Hou Liang the entire time, blocking Tian Xiaojun’s line of sight. When he saw him, he couldn’t help but be shocked. He quickly said,”So young master Xu is here too! Today was really a good day! All of you influential people from the capital have come to the three mountains!”

The young man who was called “young master Xu” by Tian Xiaojun was called Xu Zixuan. He was also on good terms with Zhao Yongjun and song Rui. Unlike Hou Liang, Xu Zixuan was a standard third generation. He was famous and professional. His grandfather had made great contributions in the Army and was promoted to Lieutenant General before retirement.

With such a family background, Xu Zixuan was naturally an influential figure in the circle of rich Playboys, and Tian Xiaojun could not even fawn on him.

Only then did Hou Liang understand Tian Xiaojun’s situation. He nodded slightly and said,”So you’re Secretary Tian’s son, how are you!”

“Young master doesn’t dare to accept such an honor! Hello, young master hou! Hello, young master Xu!” Tian Xiaojun said as he nodded and bowed. He was no longer as arrogant as he had been in the private room.

As for Zhong Zixin and Xia Tian, they didn’t even have the right to speak. In front of a good – for – nothing like Hou Liang, these two wouldn’t even dare to breathe loudly.

“Young master Xu, young master hou, it’s rare for us to meet each other in the capital, but today, we’ve met by chance in the three mountains. This is definitely fate!” Tian Xiaojun asked carefully. Why don’t I treat everyone to a gathering tonight?”

“I’m sorry,” Hou Liang said with an indifferent expression.”We’re meeting a friend tonight. Let’s talk again next time!”

Tian Xiaojun was disappointed, but he quickly replied,”Okay, okay, okay, then we won’t disturb you any longer. I’ll be staying at the three mountains for a few more days. If you’re free, you can come and have a drink with me! Young master Wei has my number. ”

“Let’s see what the arrangements are!”Hou Liang said noncommittally. We’ll go in first ...”

Tian Xiaojun quickly bowed and made an inviting gesture, saying,”Young master hou, young master Xu, be careful. The road isn’t smooth ...”

Only when Hou Liang and the other two walked past him did Tian Xiaojun straighten his body. He looked at the backs of the three people with a hint of yearning in his eyes.

Zhong Zixin and Xia Ling also had the same expression.

Especially Zhong Zixin. When she saw Hou Liang and Xu Zixuan, she couldn’t wait to get close to them. However, she didn’t have the courage and wasn’t confident in her own looks.

“Let’s go ...”Tian Xiaojun said.

He had only taken a step when Tian Xiaojun suddenly stopped. He turned his head back and muttered to himself,”I remember that there was only one private room in that courtyard! Could it be ...”
