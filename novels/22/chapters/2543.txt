2544 Receiving orders in the face of danger (2)

Soon, the players from both sides, under the lead of the referee, walked out of the players ‘passage with the ball boy.

The originally enthusiastic atmosphere in the home team’s stands was instantly ignited at this moment. The cheers and applause instantly increased by several levels.

The sudden cheers and applause jolted Xia ruofei awake. He turned to Wu Lei in a daze and asked,””Lei Zi, who scored? Is it our team or the opponent?”

Wu Lei did not know whether to laugh or cry.”Brother Xia, it was the players who came in just now. The game hasn’t even started yet ... You’re sleeping too soundly, aren’t you?”

Xia ruofei rubbed his eyes and said,””Why hasn’t the competition started yet? This was too slow! I’ve already taken a nap ...”

Wu Lei couldn’t help but laugh out loud. The tension before the game had disappeared unknowingly.

After a while, the players on both sides were in position in their respective half of the field. The referee blew the whistle and the game officially began.

Due to the strength of his opponent, Ruby had been standing on the sidelines since the start of the match, nervously watching the situation on the field. He had no intention of returning to his seat.

“Alright, dear audience and fans of PP sports! The match officially began with the whistle of the referee! Today’s commentary is still from Jia Tianning, director Jia, and I, Shen fangjian!” Shen fangjian said with familiarity.

“Hello, everyone!” Jia Tianning also said in cooperation.

“We’ve just introduced the starting lineup of the valentian team. Now, let’s take a look at the starting lineup of the visiting Spaniards.” Shen fangjian said,”first of all, I have to tell everyone that Wu Lei is still on standby for this game. At the same time, we have to pay attention to the suspected Chinese player, number 25, who has been discussed on the domestic internet for the past few days. He has also appeared on the squad list today. Like Wu Lei, he is also on the bench for this game ... Everyone can pay attention to this player. I just observed him. In the few shots given by the broadcast, We did not notice the existence of this mysterious player ...”

After Shen fangjian briefly explained the situation that everyone was concerned about, he began to introduce the starting lineup of the Spanish team.”As we can see, the goalkeeper position is still the number one veteran, Diego Lopez, and the center back is the partner of Naldo and elmosa. They are currently the main force of the Spanish team. The two full – backs are separately ... Wait! Let’s look at this ball first!”

Shen fangjian had not even finished introducing the starting lineup when the situation on the field had already changed.

Espanyol kicked off the game. After the kick – off, the Spaniards ‘players were used to passing the ball back and forth in the backfield, looking for opportunities.

They were already familiar with such a routine. Even though the valentian team pressed hard on the entire game, even forcing the defenders to pass the ball back to the goalkeeper, the Spanish team did not panic. The goalkeeper, Diego Lopez, did not nervously make a big kick. Instead, he gently passed the ball to Naldo when the opposing striker pressed up.

Naldo looked up and quickly observed before he passed the ball to puado. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Puador had been holding back for a long time, he wanted to perform well and shut up those who doubted him.

Therefore, after receiving Naldo’s pass, pouado did not think about it and rushed along the side with a medal, running all the way to the opponent’s half of the field.

However, puado had just dribbled the ball past half of the field. In the face of the opponent’s fast – paced rush, he still kept his head down and dribbled the ball forward, trying to use his personal ability to breakthrough.

However, he had clearly overestimated his personal ability. The opponent’s defender did not take any of his feints. With a clean tackle and a save, he simply intercepted the ball from under his feet. He quickly got up and passed the ball out with a straight pass.

The valentian team’s offensive and defensive switch was very fast. After a successful interception, they quickly pressed forward.

This was in sharp contrast to the Spanish team’s slow pace.

The Spanish players in the middle and front field had been following puador s to run and receive the ball. However, puador s low – Level mistake led to the loss of the ball, and everyone had not had time to return to their defensive positions.

It was quite dangerous for the ball to be suddenly intercepted during an attack.

The valentian team quickly formed a situation of more players than players in the front field. They did not hesitate. After the two passes from the triangle, the football had already advanced to the front of the Spanish penalty area.

From the moment puardo s lost the ball, he had been desperately chasing back in the hope of making up for it.

While Valencia’s front field players were stunned at the front of the penalty area, puadoré was already in position to defend.

He saw that Valencia’s players seemed to be ready to kick him, so he did not even think about it and shoveled from the side.

However, what puado didn’t expect was that the other side played a fake shot and a real hook, easily bypassing his defense and directly breaking in.

As soon as the opposing player entered the penalty area, the Spanish players were even more afraid to make any moves, for fear of giving the other side a chance to “dive” to cheat the penalty kick.

However, at this moment, the Valencia team’s striker, Rodrigo, did not hesitate to shoot at an angle. With a swish, the football stuck to the inner side of the pillar and flew directly into the goal.

The scene immediately burst into a huge wave of noise.
