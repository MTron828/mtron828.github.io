When Pablo walked out of the newspaper office in a daze, The Sports Daily finally released a statement overnight. It was directly hung on the headlines of websites and apps, and it was also pinned on social media accounts.

The statement said,”

We’ve noticed the controversy on the internet regarding our reporter Pablo’s recent post on social media. After investigation and verification, it was found that Pablo’s interviewee, Mayers, did not speak the truth in front of the camera in order to protect the home team. Pablo also posted the content on Facebook without rigorous verification.

Although Facebook was Pablo’s private platform, out of trust in his professional behavior, the newspaper also reposted some of the content. At this point, this newspaper would like to express our sincere apologies to the public for the negative impact caused by this matter. We deeply regret Mr. Mayers ‘actions. Our newspaper has always followed the principle of authenticity of news, and we also strongly condemn dishonest behavior.

Due to a serious mistake at work, Mr. Pablo has resigned from the newspaper and has been approved. We wish Mr. Pablo all the best in his future career!

“Finally, I would like to thank public opinion once again. In the future, we will strengthen our content review to prevent similar mistakes from happening again.

It was around fouro’ clock in the morning in Barcelona when The Sports Daily published the statement of apology. Not many people saw it first. Xia ruofei also went back to his bedroom to rest after browsing the news.

Xia ruofei only saw the statement from The Sports Daily the next morning after he woke up.

In fact, in the reports of the major European Sports Media, the daily sports had been criticized thoroughly, especially the Madrid region’s Maca and as, which were even more sarcastic and sarcastic. But in any case, The Sports Daily had found a way to justify itself. As for whether others believed it or not, it was no longer important. At least it would not go bankrupt.

Last night, the news came out late. Other than the media industry, which had people monitoring public opinion, many people only saw the news in the morning. From this perspective, although The Sports Daily released its statement a few hours later, it was not too late.

However, in the face of the overwhelming coverage by the European Sports Media, the statement of sports daily appeared so weak. More and more people saw the news in the morning and participated in the discussion.

Of course, the bar?a fans were the most upset. When Pablo posted the video of the interview with Meyers, the bar?a fans were really proud. However, the next day, they found that it was completely fake news. Whether Pablo had deliberately fabricated it or Meyers had lied, the content of the interview was fake. There was no doubt about it. The most important thing was that Ruby’s accusations at the press conference were all true. For the bar?a fans, this was really terrible.

Therefore, the storm of public opinion was still blowing, and it was getting more and more intense.

However, when Xia ruofei saw the statement from The Sports Daily, he was quite unhappy.

Xia ruofei was not surprised that The Sports Daily was trying to get away with it. Anyone would do the same.

What Xia ruofei could not accept the most was that in the statement of The Sports Daily, there was no apology to Espanyol and Ruby, nor did they mention that they had ridiculed Xia ruofei and Wu Lei. The Sports Daily had first reposted Pablo’s fake video two days ago and had even written a review article to ridicule the Spanish team. Their words were even more sarcastic and mean. Now that the situation had reversed, they were pretending to be deaf.

Although The Sports Daily also expressed its apology in a statement, it was just a casual sentence, and the target of the apology was “the public.” There was no sincerity at all.

Xia ruofei looked at the comments on the official Facebook page of The Sports Daily with a sullen face. The bar?a fans must be in an awkward silence at this time, while other neutral fans were making comments one after another. Many people said that the statement of The Sports Daily was a continuation of the lie and the apology lacked the most basic sincerity. The one who should be apologized was Espanyol, but they did not say a word. Their arrogant and rude faces were nauseating.

Seeing that the netizens ‘comments were mostly criticizing The Sports Daily, Xia ruofei felt a little better.

At this moment, his cell phone on the bedside table rang.

Xia ruofei did not get up. He reached out and took the phone from her.

It was a call from Zhou leiyun. After Xia ruofei picked it up, he said calmly,””Director Zhou, you’re up so early!”

“Director Xia, did you see the statement released by The Sports Daily?” Zhou leiyun asked.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,” This bunch of grandsons really had no sincerity! Not only is he trying to shirk his responsibility, he’s even playing word games with an apology ...”

Zhou leiyun also scolded,”the media that is on Barcelona’s side are all like this. They look down on us Espanyol clubs from the bottom of their hearts!”
