Seeing that it was almost time, Xia ruofei returned to the villa to prepare dinner.

However, he didn’t plan to do it himself. He went to the kitchen, connected to the space with his mind, and took out a pile of vegetables, fruits, and two fish. Then, he called ye Lingyun out and asked him to prepare dinner.

There were a lot of people having dinner today. Besides Xia ruofei, li Zhifu, and ye Lingyun, pang Hao was also working here. Naturally, he could not be absent. Including Madam song and her son, there were a total of six people. They had to prepare a few more dishes.

Xia ruofei saw that pang Hao did not have much to do today, so he called him over and let him help ye Lingyun in the kitchen. Xia ruofei went to the courtyard to chat with li Zhifu and the others.

After chatting for a while, song Rui asked for a tour of the farm. Xia ruofei invited Mrs. Song and Li Zhifu to the living room for tea while he brought song Rui to tour the farm.

The two brothers had not seen each other for some time. Xia ruofei smiled as he walked and said,””Young master Song, you’ve been living quite a carefree life in the three mountains, haven’t you?”

“Don’t even mention it!” Song Rui said with a bitter face,”I have to go to work at my family’s company during the day and stay overnight outside. I have to go back to my residence in guling. It’s no different from going to jail. I thought I could be free in Sanshan, but I was too naive! This is a huge loss ...”

“Come on! What are you going to do in your own company?” Xia ruofei sneered.”I guess you’re only focused on harming the young girls in the company?”

“Bullshit! I’m very dedicated to my work, okay?” Song Rui stiffened his neck and said.

However, he quickly put on a long face and said,””Brother, I also want to talk about life and ideals with the girls in the company! “But my old man transferred two people from Beijing to the company in San Shan. These two hotheaded young men are in charge of me every day. Although they’re members of the song family’s external branch, they’re still my elders. The key is that if I do anything out of line, they’ll report it to my father. I can’t afford to hurt them ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,” You’re just digging your own grave! Who was the one who said that he wanted to train in the company at San Shan and spend more time with elder song?”

The two of them had unknowingly reached the top of the orchard. They stood on the stone that Xia ruofei and Wu Liqian had sat on earlier today and looked out at the sea in the distance.

Song Rui said gloomily,”brother, can you stop mentioning it?” I’m so regretful that my intestines are turning green ...”

Then, song Rui said with grief and indignation,””And RUO Fei, do you know? My mom also came here with a mission ...”

“I know!” Xia ruofei said,”your mother must be here on behalf of your father to show her filial piety!”

“I’m not talking about that!” Song Rui said gloomily,”my family has arranged a marriage for me. Don’t you think that’s nonsense? I haven’t played enough yet! I don’t want to get married at all ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”brother, the wedding night and the Golden roll’s inscription are all good things in life!” Even if you’re not grateful, at least you don’t have to frown! It’s not like I’m sending you to the execution ground, is there a need to?”

“Why not? I met the girl yesterday, and she’s also a beauty! But he’s not my type at all! I don’t feel anything at all!” Song Rui said excitedly. Then, he looked up at the sky at a 45 – degree angle and said sadly,””And ... I’m still a kid ...”
