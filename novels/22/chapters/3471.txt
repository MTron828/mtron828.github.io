Fortunately, Ling Qingxue had been eliminated early on, so Xia ruofei kept these thoughts to himself. Since there was no one around him, he naturally did not say it out loud. Otherwise, perfected mountain river would be very depressed. It was clearly a big gift for his disciple, but in the end, he owed it to Taoist Qing Xuan.

Xia ruofei did not know the inside story and thought that this was the reward for completing the Tower of Trials mission. Naturally, he did not hold back and immediately acknowledged the treasure as its owner. Then, he took off his shirt and put on the Golden soft armor. Although he had already reached the top of the tower of Trials, by right, the entire mission should have been completed and there should not be any new tests. But wasn‚Äôt that normal? When did this powerful senior who designed the Tower of Trials ever act according to common sense?

Therefore, he didn‚Äôt want to waste a second with this kind of life-saving magic treasure. He immediately equipped himself with it.

After putting on his shirt, Xia ruofei turned his attention to the small Jade bottle. Alll ùíçùíÇtest novùíÜlùíî on novelbùíän/(.)cùíêm

This time, he had the experience. He didn‚Äôt try to figure it out by himself, but directly used his mental power to investigate.

Sure enough, as soon as his spiritual power touched the bottle, a message was transmitted.

Xia ruofei‚Äôs eyes brightened and the joy on his face could not be concealed. This small Jade bottle actually contained the legendary nascent formation pill!

He had obtained three Jade talismans of inheritance in the spirit map space, among which there were some famous and precious elixirs recorded in ancient books, including this nascent condensation pill, so he was very clear about the magical effects of the nascent condensation pill. He also knew that for golden core stage cultivators, having a nascent condensation pill was equivalent to having a ticket to the nascent Soul Stage, and the probability of breaking through to the nascent Soul Stage would increase a lot.

Although Xia ruofei was only in the intermediate stage of the Golden core realm, he had more and more cultivation resources now. His cultivation speed in the later stage would not be slow. If nothing unexpected happened, he would soon face the problem of breaking through to the nascent soul realm.

He didn‚Äôt want to be like Chen Nanfeng, stuck at the peak of the Golden core stage for many years and unable to break through the bottleneck.

However, a top-notch cultivation technique like the great Dao Arts was indeed much better than an ordinary cultivation technique. His golden core was also a Supreme-grade golden core that was different from ordinary cultivators. The only problem was that the bottleneck he faced would be particularly stubborn. Once he broke through, he would naturally be much stronger than cultivators of the same level. The problem was that it would be particularly difficult to break through.

Small realms were easy to break through, but it was much more difficult than ordinary cultivators to cross the threshold from the Golden core stage to the original infant stage.

Sometimes, Xia ruofei couldn‚Äôt help but worry about whether he would face a similar problem as Chen Nanfeng. This bottle of nascent condensation pills was like a pillow sent to him when he was sleepy, like charcoal in the snow!

It could be said that with this bottle of nascent formation pills, Xia ruofei‚Äôs breakthrough to the original infant stage was a matter of course.

This was because it wasn‚Äôt just one pill, but an entire bottle.

If he couldn‚Äôt form a nascent soul after taking a bottle of nascent soul pills, Xia ruofei might as well give up on cultivation.

Of course, it would be even better if he could break through to the original infant stage without using the nascent formation pill. After all, Xia ruofei‚Äôs family and friends were all cultivating, including Ling Qingxue, Song Wei, Li Yifu, song Qiming, and the others. They were all about to break through. Even if Xia ruofei could not use the nascent formation pill, it would be great to keep it for them.

Xia ruofei carefully kept the nascent formation pill.

In the end, his gaze naturally fell on the purple crystal.

There were many more of these purple crystals in the storage ring, and they were piled up into a small mountain in the storage ring.

The purple Crystal‚Äôs energy was very pure and was more than one grade higher than origin crystals. However, Xia ruofei did not know what this purple crystal was and whether it could be directly absorbed for cultivation.

Other than that, he did not know how to use the purple crystal. If it could be absorbed, what was the absorption and transformation efficiency? all of these were unknown.

Hence, Xia ruofei was eager to know what kind of treasure it was.

With this golden soft armor, Xia ruofei could really be said to be very confident in his journey in the world of cultivation. Even if he were to meet an expert like Chen Nanfeng, he would be able to ensure his safety.

Xia ruofei was really surprised that the reward for completing the Tower of Trials would be so generous.

Xia ruofei could not believe that it could even block part of the attack of an immortal soul Stage cultivator. Was it really not a waste to give such a high ‚Äì Level Dharma Treasure to a golden core intermediate stage cultivator like him?

The senior expert who designed the Tower of Trials mission really didn‚Äôt play by the rules! Even the reward setting was so unique. However, Xia ruofei liked it very much that it was not a routine this time.
