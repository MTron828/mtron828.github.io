1958 Arrival in Hong Kong (2)

“President Feng, we’re old acquaintances!”MA Xiong said with a smile.

“Hello, Chairman MA! We meet again!” Feng Rao said with a smile.

Xia ruofei introduced Dong Yun and pang Hao one by one. Naturally, MA Xiong also welcomed them warmly.

Then, Xia ruofei asked again,” Oh right, old Mr. MA, all the auction items have been shipped over. Are you ready to receive them? ”

“Everything’s ready!”MA Xiong said.

Ma Zhiming, who was at the side, understood and waved his hand. The small refrigerator Van immediately reversed, and several staff members got out of the car and quickly walked forward.

Xia ruofei gestured for Liu An to bring a few people to the back cabin to retrieve the things. Ma Zhiming also personally boarded the plane and supervised them from the side.

Although the items Xia ruofei brought were priceless, they were not too big. The few big boxes were moved in a short while and were all placed in the refrigerated compartment.

” Xia Sheng, we’ve also hired the best security company in Hong Kong. They’ve sent five cars and dozens of elites to wait outside the airport. They’re in charge of escorting this batch of auction items! ” MA Xiong said. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Xia ruofei nodded and said,” thank you!” Old master Ma, are these items to be sent to the hotel? Then let’s follow the convoy!”

The auction would be held at the Hengfeng Jiahua flagship hotel in Hong Kong. Xia ruofei and the others would be staying there as well. Therefore, the cars should be going the same way.

Xia ruofei also wanted to be as close to the auction items as possible. It was not that he did not trust the guards that MA Xiong had hired with a huge sum of money. However, there was always a “what if”. With Xia ruofei’s current cultivation, as long as he was in the convoy, the “what if” would definitely not exist.

“Good! Let’s talk in the car!” MA Xiong said,”everything has been arranged at the hotel. Please rest for a while after you arrive. I’ll treat you to dinner tonight. I’ve also invited a few old friends from Hong Kong to accompany me. Xia Sheng, CEO Feng, and the two directors, please do give me the honor of coming!”

“We definitely wouldn’t dare to refuse old Mr. Ma’s hospitality!” Xia ruofei joked.

“Come, Xia Sheng, please get in the car!” MA Xiong laughed.

Xia ruofei and MA Xiong got into the Rolls – Royce Phantom. Huanhuan naturally wanted to stay with Xia ruofei. MA Xiong doted on his granddaughter a lot, so she got into the Rolls – Royce Phantom as well.

Ma Zhiming personally sat in the refrigerator Van, while Tian Huixin brought Feng Rao, Dong Yun, pang Hao, and Liu Qian, who had come to pick them up, to sit in the Mercedes – Benz Wittes commercial car.

The three cars drove out of the airport’s restricted area in a single file. Outside, five bulletproof cars were lined up in a row. The people in the cars were all big Men in Black suits and sunglasses with cold expressions.

When the convoy drove out, the five cars immediately started. One of them led the way, two protected the flanks, and two covered the back, forming a larger convoy. They drove out of the airport and headed in the direction of Hengfeng Jiahua Hotel.

The accident that Xia ruofei was worried about did not happen. The fleet of cars arrived at Hengfeng Jiahua Hotel smoothly. The auction items were immediately taken out of the car and sent upstairs by the elevator.

In the magnificent hotel lobby, publicity materials for tomorrow’s auction could be seen everywhere, including brochures that could be taken away and read at will, as well as signs and promotional posters in eye – catching positions. From time to time, well – dressed guests would stop in front of these promotional posters, and people would constantly take away the brochures from the shelves. They seemed to be the guests of tomorrow’s auction.

“Xia Sheng, I’ve already told the hotel to stop accepting reservations for meetings and large – scale events from three days ago,” MA Xiong said with a smile.”We don’t want to affect the auction tomorrow.”

A high – end hotel like Hengfeng Jiahua had a few conference rooms and banquet halls of various sizes. Moreover, there were almost no breaks in the orders for all kinds of conference activities. In order to prevent the hotel from having many activities at the same time tomorrow, MA Xiong directly cleared the hotel in advance.

“Mr. MA, your hotel will suffer a huge loss this way!” Xia ruofei said.

“Hahaha! It’s just a small amount of money, not worth mentioning!” MA Xiong said,”in addition, there have been many guests coming from all over the world over the past few days. The hotel’s check – in rate has also increased a lot compared to the same time last year. This is all because of the auction! Therefore, there’s no loss to speak of!”

Even though MA Xiong said that, Xia ruofei still said,””You’re so considerate!”

He knew that even during the off – season, the check – in rate of Hengfeng Jiahua Hotel would not be low. If they undertake a few fewer activities, the hotel would suffer a real loss.

“Let’s not talk about this ...” MA Xiong waved his hand and said,”xiasheng, I have an afternoon tea appointment with director Guo, so I’ll take my leave first!” Zhiming and the others will arrange everything. We’ll meet at dinner!”

“Alright, you can go now!” Xia ruofei said immediately.

As a rich man, MA Xiong’s schedule was usually very full. Xia ruofei already felt that it was troublesome for him to make a special trip to the airport to welcome him.

After MA Xiong left, Ma Zhiming and his wife brought Xia ruofei and the rest to the Presidential Suite on the top floor in the special elevator.

This was how the MA family welcomed Xia ruofei. As long as Xia ruofei stayed in any of the hotels under Hengfeng, the best room would be reserved for him. Hengfeng Jiahua was a high – end brand under Hengfeng Hotel Group, so the best room was naturally the Presidential Suite on the top floor.

From the moment they boarded the plane at San Shan, pang Hao felt that his eyes were dazzled.

A private jet worth hundreds of millions, the arrival of the Super – rich in Hong Kong at the airport, the luxurious Presidential Suite ...

After all, pang Hao was a senior executive in the company. He had seen a lot of things with Xia ruofei in the past two years, but he still felt like he was in the Grand View Garden.

The big boxes of items that Xia ruofei had brought had already been sent to the Presidential Suite.

Ma Zhiming had arranged for someone to renovate one of the staff’s bedrooms in the Presidential Suite in advance. He had cleared out everything inside and then placed two huge refrigerators to store these precious auction items.

“Xia Sheng, everything is here. You can check it!” Ma Zhiming carried Xia ruofei to the room where the auction items were placed.

Xia ruofei scanned the boxes with his spiritual power and knew that they had not been touched. He left a faint mark on each box with his spiritual power. If the boxes had been opened, he would have sensed it long ago.

Not to mention ordinary people, even cultivators might not be able to discover this spiritual mark. Therefore, it was basically impossible for anyone to avoid the spiritual mark and open the box to steal things without anyone knowing.

If he was really that capable, he wouldn’t be interested in the things in the box.

Top – grade truffles and abalones were simply priceless in the eyes of ordinary people, but in the eyes of cultivators, perhaps only a few old mountain ginsengs had some value and could barely play a little role in the formulation of spirit herbs. However, this little value was relative. In fact, the value was very limited. After all, they were not spirit herbs or spirit herbs.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”there’s no need to check!” How can I not trust you?”

Thank you, Xia Sheng, for your trust!” Ma Zhiming said.

He had been keeping an eye on this batch of boxes the entire time. Naturally, he was confident that they would not be swapped. However, his confidence was his own business. These boxes were worth over a hundred million. He was very touched and happy that Xia ruofei trusted him so much.

Ma Zhiming and his wife knew that Xia ruofei and his team must have something to do, so after leaving the room cards of pang Hao and the others, they took Huanhuan and left.

Huan Huan was naturally very reluctant to leave, but she was much more sensible than before. Tian Huixin told her that uncle Xia was busy and that she would be able to see uncle Xia again at dinner. She did not act coquettishly and obediently followed her parents to wave goodbye to Xia ruofei.

After Ma Zhiming’s family left, Xia ruofei brought Feng Jing and the others to the small conference room in the Presidential Suite. They wanted to have a short meeting.

“Chairman, isn’t it a little unsafe to leave the items in the room like this?” Feng Jing asked as soon as she sat down. Do you want Boss Ma to arrange for a few guards to stay here?”
