Chapter 625: Temporary healer (1)

“Huh?” Feng Jing was dumbfounded.

She looked at the adorable Huanhuan in the front passenger seat and said with uncertainty,””I ... Maybe ... I can?”

“Quick, quick, get in the car!” Xia ruofei said hurriedly.”President Feng, you’ve helped me a lot today!”

In fact, Feng Rao was only an unmarried young woman. How could she have any experience in taking care of a child? When Xia ruofei asked her that question, she didn’t know if she was out of her mind or what, but she actually agreed.

Now that he had said it, he could not take it back.

It’s just giving a child a bath. It shouldn’t be too difficult, right? Feng Rao said in her heart, lacking confidence.

After Feng Jing got into the car, Xia ruofei started the car again and drove for a short while before reaching the small villa.

Xia ruofei got out of the car first, then went to the side of the passenger seat to unbuckle Huanhuan’s seat belt. He carried her down. He had no choice. The chassis of the Knight XV was too high. A four or five – year – old child would not be able to get down without the help of an adult.

At this moment, a black shadow flashed past.

Huan Huan’s eyes brightened and she shouted happily,””Lightning!”

Then, she slid down from Xia ruofei’s body and wrapped her arms around Lightning’s neck. She stroked its smooth fur and rubbed her pink little face against Lightning’s face.

Lightning seemed to enjoy it as well. It even stuck out its tongue and licked it gently.

Feng Rao got out of the car and saw the big dog and a cute four – or five – year – old girl hugging each other. Her heart was slightly touched and she felt especially warm.

......

Xia ruofei thought to himself,”no wonder he takes a shower every day...He just goes straight to lightning!” I think Lightning’s tongue licked Huanhuan’s face just now ...”

“Alright, alright, Huanhuan, let’s go upstairs!” Xia ruofei said,”lightning, go back to your nest! I’ll play with Huanhuan tomorrow!”

Lightning wagged its tail at Xia ruofei and looked at Huanhuan as if it was waving goodbye to her. Then, it slowly returned to its nest.

Xia ruofei carried Huanhuan easily with one hand and the bag of clothes with the other.

“Boss Feng, please come upstairs with us!” He said to Feng Jing. Help Huanhuan take a bath later, I really don’t know how to do this ...”

Feng Rao smiled, nodded, and followed Xia ruofei.

After returning to the room, Xia ruofei put down his things and went to the bathroom to fill the tub with water. Fortunately, the bathroom in the master bedroom of the villa had a bathtub. If it was a shower head, it would be more difficult to bathe the little loli.

Xia ruofei did not have a child’s bathtub at home.

After filling the tub with water, Xia ruofei checked that the temperature was just right. He then found a new towel and bath towel from the cabinet in the bathroom and placed them beside the tub. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

There were no brands that were exclusive to children such as shampoo and body wash, so they could only make do with ordinary brands. Xia ruofei also found them and placed them beside the towel.

After the preliminary preparations were done, Xia ruofei came out and asked Huanhuan to take a bath.

Just as Xia ruofei had been worried about, the little girl asked brother ruofei to help her wash up.

After much persuasion and Feng Rao’s friendly attitude, Huanhuan finally pouted and reluctantly agreed to this “unfair treaty” and followed Feng Rao into the bathroom.

After the bathroom door closed, Xia ruofei finally let out a long sigh of relief. He thought to himself that he had finally settled the shower.

However, Xia ruofei had been too naive.

The whole bath process was full of twists and turns. It could simply be written into a novel.

Feng Rao kept coming out to ask for help. The little girl was going to fish for a toy in a while. It was the kind of fish that floated in the bathtub with a magnet in its mouth and a toy that had a magnet hanging on the fishing rod. Later, she would ask him to wear a waterproof hat when washing his hair. And then he didn’t like the smell of shower gel and insisted on strawberry – flavored ...

Xia ruofei was having a headache and was far away from The City in the Middle of the Night. Where could he go to meet the little ancestor’s many strange requests?

In the end, he could only follow Feng Jing into the bathroom and “convince” her. In the end, he barely managed to solve the problem of taking a bath.

When Feng Jing helped Huanhuan dry herself and changed her into the coral fleece pajamas with cherry meatballs, Xia ruofei, who had moved a plastic stool to sit beside the bathtub, exchanged glances with Feng Jing. Both of them could read the same meaning in each other’s eyes. Yingying was really a terrifying creature ...

Feng Rao’s gaze carried a hint of pity. She had successfully retreated, but Xia ruofei had to sleep with little Huanhuan. How many more problems could there be in the long night? Only the heavens knew!

Huan Huan ran out barefooted and used Xia ruofei’s computer to watch cartoons.

Both Xia ruofei and Feng Rao were “wet”. Yingying was extremely restless in the shower. One moment, she would splash herself in the water without any warning. The next moment, she would rub herself against Feng Rao’s body. If it were summer, Feng Rao’s curvy figure would probably be completely exposed ...

Fortunately, she was wearing a coat today, so she was not exposed.

Even so, she was already in a sorry state. Even Xia ruofei, who was helping at the side, was splashed with water.

“President Feng, thank you so much ...” Xia ruofei said.
