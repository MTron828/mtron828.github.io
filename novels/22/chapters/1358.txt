“Do business together?” Xia ruofei was stunned.

“Don’t get me wrong, ruofei!”Zhao Yongjun laughed. We’re not like Tian Xiaojun, who has his eyes on your company ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand,”why would I?” Besides, if brother Zhao really wants to invest, I can give up some of the company’s shares!”

Zhao Yongjun chuckled.”No need, no need. We’ve seen the potential of paradise Corporation. We won’t take advantage of this!” Otherwise, my dad will break my legs when I get back!”

“Is it that serious? It’s normal for brothers to help each other out. ” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

He wasn’t actually willing to sell the company shares, but if Zhao Yongjun really asked, he could accept a small amount of shares.

However, if that was the case, the friendship between everyone would more or less change.

Zhao Yongjun was well aware of this. At his level, he no longer craved for money. He valued Xia ruofei more, so he naturally wouldn’t request to invest in paradise Corporation.

“We definitely won’t touch the Paradise Corporation!” He said without hesitation.

Xia ruofei laughed and shrugged.”Then do as you wish! But don’t blame me for not being loyal! By the way, What do you mean when you said we’ll work together?”

Zhao Yongjun laughed.”It’s Liang’s idea. We all have some spare money and want to use it to do something. Just treat it as having fun!”

“Oh? Do you have any specific ideas?” Xia ruofei asked.

“Liang’s trying to start a bar! In fact, it’s more convenient for us to have a gathering and drink. Earning money is secondary. ” Zhao Yongjun said,”but I feel that the bar is a little too low class. If you follow my plan, it’s best to set up a comprehensive Leisure Club. Of course, it’s mainly to serve the brothers themselves.” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Zhao Yongjun turned around and smiled at Xia ruofei.””But I still want to ask for your opinion and see if you have any better ideas! Your business is the best among us!”

Xia ruofei forced a smile.”Actually, I don’t know how to do business. Our paradise Corporation mainly relies on our products to win. If it were someone else who could develop such a product, the company might be able to run better.”

Xia ruofei wasn’t being modest. If he was really a business genius, with Xia ruofei’s qualifications, paradise Corporation might be much better than it was now.

It was mainly because Xia ruofei’s own business strategy was not very radical. Besides, he was a little lazy and was not very keen on the expansion of capital.

Otherwise, it would be impossible for the company to develop to a value of more than one billion and still not have a single cent of bank loans.

Doing business was about money begets money. Basically, they would borrow as much money from the bank as possible and then use it to develop the company.

Compared to the dividends brought about by the company’s expansion, that little bit of bank interest was nothing.

It could be said that there were almost no big companies that had zero debts. Strictly speaking, Lao Godma’s family was probably the only one in the whole of China!

“Woof! You’re really not humble!” Zhao Yongjun said with a smile.

“I’m not being humble?” Xia ruofei was stunned.

“I’m saying that you’re not humble at all when it comes to paradise corporation’s products!” Zhao Yongjun said with a smile.

“It’s the truth!” Xia ruofei said,”I didn’t lie about the jaded skin cream, did I?”

“That’s true! This is truly a phenomenal product!” Zhao Yongjun had nothing to say about this solid evidence.

Xia ruofei smiled proudly and said,””Brother Zhao, I agree with you on the whole. If we really want to do something together, the bar would seem a little small. It’s not bad to have a comprehensive club. It doesn’t matter if we make money or not. I’m quite attracted to a good environment, safe, and well – equipped place to eat, drink, and have fun!”

“Yeah!” Zhao Yongjun nodded. Besides, for a business like a Leisure Club, the main point isn’t profit. Although profit is inevitable, I value its added value more. ”

Xia ruofei nodded in agreement. He knew what Zhao Yongjun meant.

Zhao Yongjun continued,”and I have another idea. I had a meal at my sister-in-law’s private restaurant tonight. I think the food is quite good, especially the two dishes you recommended. It’s so much better than the Royal food and Palace food in the capital!” That’s why I suggested that you open a branch in Beijing, right?”

Xia ruofei nodded and looked at Zhao Yongjun, waiting for him to continue.

“If we all work together to build a club,” Zhao continued,”actually, sister-in-law’s private restaurant can be part of the club!”

Xia ruofei said hesitantly,””As his future father – in – Law, I might not agree. His food and beverage group is also a chain business, and all of them are directly operated. There are no alliance Stores. If he wants to open a branch in Beijing, he must have absolute control over the branch. If he wants to join a club ...”

“What are you thinking?” Zhao Yongjun smiled and said,”I’m not talking about making Ling’s private kitchen a part of the club. In fact, many star – rated hotels and private clubs ‘restaurants are independent or outsourced. We can also do this! The Ling’s private kitchen is still independent, but they chose to store it in our club and only provide services to the club’s members. The financial side will settle the bill with the club. This is also a strong Alliance!”
