Chapter 1689: Hello, lady boss (1)

Xia ruofei looked up and saw that it was Old West’s wife, Kelly. He couldn’t help but say in surprise,””Auntie cabalie! What are you doing here? I was going to visit you at the winery after I settled down here!”

Liang Qichao got out of the car and said with a smile,””Uncle Wester is here too! He’s cooking his best dishes inside! The two of you wanted to give you a surprise, so you deliberately didn’t go to the door to pick you up!”

“Xia! When you weren’t around, we all missed you!” Auntie Kelly came up and gave Xia ruofei a warm hug.

At this time, Old West, wearing an apron, walked to the door with a plate of apple pie. He laughed and said,””Boss! Welcome back to Australia!”

Xia ruofei was also in a good mood. He smiled and said,””Uncle Wester, you’ve all worked hard these past few months!”

“By the way, sister che, let me introduce you!” Xia ruofei said,”this is uncle Wester and this is his wife, Auntie cabalie! They’re the ones who help me manage my two wineries in Australia!”

Due to the language barrier, Xia ruofei had introduced the couple in English out of respect for Old West and Kelly, as well as Feng Jing’s excellent English.

“Uncle Wester, Auntie caitley, this is ...” He continued.

Kelly laughed heartily and said,””Xia, this beautiful lady must be your girlfriend!”

Xia ruofei and Feng Jing blushed. Xia ruofei quickly explained,””No, no, no! You’ve misunderstood. She’s the president of a company in my country and my business partner! Of course, we’re also very good friends!”

Feng Jing couldn’t help but feel a little disappointed.

However, Old West immediately said,””I know, I know! I heard from Liang that the two of you were coming together, so I even learned some Chinese from him!”

“Oh?” Xia ruofei was a little surprised.”You’ve also learned Chinese!”

“Of course, don’t look at my age, my learning ability is still very strong!” Old West said proudly.

Then, he walked up to Feng Jing and spoke in strange Chinese,””Lady boss, reverse your name!”

Xia ruofei and Feng Rao were both dumbfounded. Liang Qichao could not help but laugh. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but glare at Liang Qichao and said in Chinese,””Brother Liang, aren’t you being too mean?”

Old West felt a little strange when he saw everyone’s reaction. He quickly asked,””Xia, is there a problem with what I said?”

Xia ruofei glanced at Liang Qichao and asked,””Uh ... Uncle Wester, do you know what this means?”

“Of course!” Old West said,”boss, it’s nice to see you! (Hello, boss!)”

Old West wasn’t very clear about Xia ruofei’s asset structure. He didn’t know that Paradise Farm and the two wineries were actually Xia ruofei’s private investments. Strictly speaking, they weren’t peach blossom company’s assets.

Hence, when he heard Liang Qichao say that Xia ruofei, the chairman, and Feng Jing, the company’s CEO, were coming to Australia together, he learned this Chinese sentence from him.

On the other hand, Liang Qichao deliberately translated “boss” as “lady boss” to make Xia ruofei and Feng Jing feel awkward.

Xia ruofei glared at Liang Qichao, then said to Old West,””Uncle, your pronunciation is still a little off. Boss, how are you?”

“I understand! There’s no ending note, right?” Old West had never learned Chinese before, so he thought that the word “mother” was like a suffix in English.

The more he explained, the messier it would be. Hence, Xia ruofei simply nodded and said,””Almost!”

Old West said very humbly,””It seems that Chinese is really difficult! Then I’ll try again!”

“Uncle West, there’s no need ... I’m not your boss!” Feng Rao quickly replied in English. RUO Fei! You can just call me by my name!”

“Alright then!” Old Wester nodded and said,”then I’ll call you ... Feng?”

“Mm! Your pronunciation is very accurate!” Feng Rao nodded.

“Feng, it’s nice to meet you! Come, let’s go! Dinner is ready!” Old West said enthusiastically,”tonight’s dinner was prepared by me and Kelly. This apple pie is my best dish. You must try it!”

“Good, good, good! I’m starving, let’s go in!” Xia ruofei quickly said.

As they walked in, Xia ruofei was the last one to leave. He pinched Liang Qichao hard and said in a low voice,””Brother Liang, if you do this again, I’ll ask Mr. Tang to transfer you back to United States! Let him change Liang Xiaojun to manage the farm!”

Liang Xiaojun was the one who was competing with Liang Qichao for the right of inheritance. When he was selling the Phoebe zhennan wood for Tang He, the two families had been fighting openly and secretly. Now, Liang Xiaojun’s performance in Tang He’s company was average, but Liang Qichao had shown a bright result in the farm. The balance of victory was tilted in his favor.

Liang Qichao quickly smiled and said,”I’m just trying to lighten the mood!” I won’t do it next time! Besides ... You wouldn’t be at ease if Liang Xiaojun came over, would you? Such a big business needs to be managed by one of our own who knows the roots!”
