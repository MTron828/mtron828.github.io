Chapter 721: High – end atmosphere, high – end grade (3)

Lin Qiao said,”of course!” Brother ruofei was really domineering. He said something like ‘Paradise’s products are definitely of the highest quality’, and these lychees were going to be sold for 100 yuan per kilogram! Cherries are going to be sold for 300 yuan per kilogram!”

Hu ‘Zi’s mother was shocked and quickly said,””So expensive! Then let’s not waste the good stuff, we should sell them!”

Xia ruofei looked at Lin Qiao with blame and said,”Auntie, don’t listen to Lin Qiao’s nonsense. It’s one thing how much they sell for, but these fruits are our family’s property. Besides, the total output of the two fruits was more than 100000 catties! It’s fine to eat as much as you want!”

“Auntie,” Xia ruofei said,”you should eat more cherries. It’s easy to get heaty if you eat too many lychees!”

Under Xia ruofei’s persuasion, Hu Zi’s mother ate a few more cherries. Then, she said that she would not eat anymore and started to serve rice for everyone.

After lunch, Lin Qiao went back to her room to study the pile of Apple Electronics. Hu Zi’s mother also went back to her room to rest. Xia ruofei went back to his bedroom and took out his phone to contact the sales market for fruits.

The first person he contacted was Ma Zhiming, who was far away in Hong Kong.

After the call was connected, Ma Zhiming said with great enthusiasm,”Nice to meet you, Xia Sheng!”

“Mr. MA, how are you?” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

The two of them exchanged some pleasantries before Xia ruofei cut to the chase.””Mr. MA, it’s like this. Our farm’s harvest this year is good, mainly lychees and cherries. The quality is quite high. I would like to ask if Hengfeng group is interested?”

“Of course there is!” Ma Zhiming quickly said,”xiasheng, Hengfeng group will buy all the production you have!”

Ma Zhiming didn’t hesitate to cooperate with Xia ruofei at all. On one hand, he had a high degree of trust in the products of Tao Yuan company. The Hengfeng group was now the biggest partner of Tao Yuan vegetables. The quality of Tao Yuan vegetables had long conquered the MA family. How could the fruits produced by a company that could make vegetables close to art be bad?

On the other hand, Ma Zhiming wanted to repay Xia ruofei’s kindness. Not only did Xia ruofei save MA Xiong’s life, but he also successfully cured his precious daughter, Huanhuan’s autism. Ma Zhiming was always grateful to Xia ruofei.

......

Xia ruofei chuckled.”I’m afraid I can’t take care of everything. We have quite a few business partners now. We have to leave some for the others!”

Of course, Xia ruofei was doing this out of consideration for the brand strategy. Only by entering a large super – Commercial company could he spread the reputation of paradise Corporation more widely. After all, Hengfeng group was a high – end company and had a narrow audience. Hence, Xia ruofei had to leave some fruits for the major super – Commercial channels no matter what.

“That works too! In any case, leave as much as you can for us!” Ma Zhiming said with a smile,”xiasheng, we’ve been friends for a long time. The cooperation with Taoyuan vegetables has always been very pleasant.” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“No problem!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Mr. MA, if you’re free in the next two days, I suggest you come to our farm for an inspection. Besides, Huanhuan should be on summer break, right? Bring her along! I already promised her that I’d bring her to pick the fruits when they ripen! If I miss the picking season, she’ll definitely blame me for breaking my promise!”

Ma Zhiming muttered to himself for a while and then said,”No problem. I’ll take a look at my recent work schedule and try to find time to bring Huanhuan back to the mainland tomorrow or the day after.”

“Alright then!” Xia ruofei said,”then let’s talk in detail when we meet!”

After hanging up, Xia ruofei called the sales manager of the winery, Li Jing, and told him about the situation. He asked him to contact the people in charge of the various super – Commercial channels. It would be best if he could form a small inspection team and get the people in charge of the fruit counters through the Super – Commercial channels to come to the farm for an inspection.

Li Jing knew that Xia ruofei was the major shareholder of the winery and was also the future son – in – Law of Ling Xiaotian. He naturally agreed to Xia ruofei’s instructions and promised to carry them out immediately.

In fact, Li Jing was very popular as a Sales Manager now. It was all the Super – Commercial channels who begged him to give them more quotas, so it was easy for him to coordinate Xia ruofei’s work.

In the end, Xia ruofei called President Zheng from the Moon Club in the West River and his future father – in – Law, Ling Xiaotian.

The two of them were very interested in the fruits of Tao Yuan farm. The vegetables of Tao Yuan had already brought them a lot of surprises, so they were full of confidence in the fruits of Tao Yuan. They would naturally not refuse a business that would only make them a sure profit.

Just like that, Xia ruofei settled the sales problem of the fruits with a few phone calls.

In the afternoon, Xia ruofei took a nap and got up at threeo’ clock. He entered the spirit map space to take a look at Xia Qing’s progress in opening the herb garden.

With the help of a divine tool like an agricultural excavator, and the unique environment in the spirit map space, Xia Qing’s work efficiency was greatly improved.

In order to save time, Xia Qing had placed the work of growing the seedlings at the Archean realm where time flowed thirty times faster. Now, the dozens of herb gardens had been planted with Chinese medicine. He believed that it wouldn’t be long before the spirit map space could produce large amounts of high – Quality Chinese medicine.

When it was past fouro’ clock, Xia ruofei washed up and went downstairs.

When they reached the stairs, Xia ruofei saw Lin Qiao walking out of the room with a brand new Apple laptop.

Lin Qiao raised her head and saw Xia ruofei. She quickly said,”Brother ruofei! The college entrance exam’s answer is out!”
