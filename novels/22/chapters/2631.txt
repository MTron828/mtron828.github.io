2632 Returning to Hunter Valley (2)

“This is unbelievable!” A reporter exclaimed and then asked,”Mr. Xia, is what Captain Brook said very true?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I indeed didn’t receive any notice beforehand.” However, I’d like to use a phrase that we Chinese people often say to describe this coincidental encounter with Yingluo as fate that brought us here at the same time!”

The reporters ‘flashlights kept flashing, and another reporter asked loudly,””Mr. Xia, today is a special day for Captain Brook. Do you have anything to say to him?”

Xia ruofei was used to dealing with the media’s attention. He said,””I’ve already congratulated you, Captain Brook. I would also like to say that to be able to recover from that degree of psychological and physical trauma, Captain Brook is an amazing person! Once again, I congratulate him on regaining his flying qualifications! I’m also very willing to take his flight! Of course, I’m afraid that my ride won’t bring any benefits to qiuhang. After all, I’m an ‘honorary passenger’ of qiuhang!”

Xia ruofei’s words made everyone smile kindly. Even Captain Brook could not help but grin.

Standing on the side, Quto’s senior vice president, Tony, smiled and said,””No matter what time it is, we welcome Mr. Xia to board Quto’s flight! In fact, Mr. Xia is the first ‘lifelong honorary passenger’ of quodan and has taken quodan planes countless times. We want to express our respect to him, but we have no opportunity to do so!”

A reporter pointed at the nearby Peach Garden and said,””I don’t think Mr. Xia will have many opportunities to take quodan in the future.”

Everyone couldn’t help but burst out laughing.

Today’s main character was still Captain Brook. After asking Xia ruofei a few questions, the reporters turned their attention to him.

After regaining his flight qualification, Captain Brook was in a good mood and answered all the questions from the media. Xia ruofei stood at the side and waited with a smile.

After the media interview, Quto’s staff pushed out the cake that had been prepared.

Captain Brook invited Xia ruofei to cut the cake with him.

After sharing the cake with everyone, Xia ruofei bade farewell to the staff of quodan and prepared to go through the immigration procedures.

Qplease airlines even prepared a small buffet party for Brook. Tony and Brook’s family sincerely invited Xia ruofei to join them, but Xia ruofei had already informed Liang qishao, who was in charge of Paradise Farm, to pick them up. He was already delayed for a while, so he didn’t want to stay too long, so he politely declined.

Xia ruofei told Brook that he would be staying in Australia for a short time and had some things to do. The next time he came to Australia, he would take the initiative to meet up with him.

Tony personally arranged for the staff of qiuhang to assist Xia ruofei and Liu Kuan with the departure procedures.

As for Liu An and his crew, they still had to stay behind to do some cleaning work. The traffic at the airport was very busy, so paradise still had to be transferred to a remote plane. In addition, necessary inspections, refueling, and other operations had to be carried out.

After the flight crew finished their work, they would find a hotel near the airport to check in. They would continue to fly to China the next day.

Xia ruofei and Liu Kuan went through the VIP passage and successfully entered the country.

When Xia ruofei first came to Australia, he had personally experienced the difficulties of the customs officers when he entered the country. This time, however, the treatment was completely different. The staff of the Australian Airlines personally accompanied them, and the customs staff obviously still remembered Xia ruofei, the well – known hero of Australia. Their attitude was quite enthusiastic, and they handled the entry procedures for Xia ruofei and Liu Kuan as quickly as possible.

After walking out of the airport, Xia ruofei saw Liang Qichao waiting anxiously.

“Brother Liang!” Xia ruofei smiled and waved at him.

Liang Qichao and Daphne, who had accompanied him to the airport, turned their heads at the same time. When they saw Xia ruofei, they quickly walked up to him.

“Ruofei, what’s taking you so long?” Liang Qichao said,”I thought you were in trouble when you entered the country!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I met a few old friends just now and we had a chat.” Sorry to keep you waiting!” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“It’s fine to wait a while!” Liang Qichao said,”it’s good that you’re not in trouble!”

Xia ruofei said,”by the way, let me introduce you. This is Liu Kuan, uncle Liu. He’s here with me.” Uncle Liu, he’s Liang Qichao, the person in charge of Paradise Farm. ”

“Hello, uncle Liu!”

“Hello, CEO Liang!”

The two of them exchanged a few words before the group walked toward the parking lot.

Xia ruofei nudged Liang Qichao’s arm and pouted at Daphne. He said with a smile,””It looks like you’ve already taken it down?”

Liang Qichao chuckled and said,”what do you think?” This brother still has some skills, right?”

“It’s alright!” Xia ruofei pursed his lips and said,”it’s been two years. If you can’t even win this, you can go eat sh * t!”

“Can you not say such disgusting things?” Liang Qichao said with a look of disdain,”you’re the National hero of Australia, after all, and you’re worth at least a few billion, right? Be more civilized!”

“This is already very civilized!” Xia ruofei blinked and said,”otherwise ... I wouldn’t have said sh * T. I would have said ...”

“Stop! Stop!” “Didn’t you say it was about Daphne?” Liang Qichao quickly asked. How did we end up talking about such disgusting things?”

Xia ruofei laughed and patted Liang Qichao’s shoulder.””Right, I haven’t asked you yet! What happened between you and Daphne ... Did you get over your father?”

Liang Qichao’s face turned bitter when he heard this.””It’s not like you don’t know my father. He’s an old – fashioned man! How would I dare to tell him?”

“Do you want a brother to give you some advice?” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“You say it! You tell me!” “I know you have the most wicked ideas!” Liang Qichao said.

“It’s simple! Work harder, you two, and try to make a human as soon as possible!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“What kind of stupid idea is this?” Liang Qichao couldn’t help but exclaim,”if my dad finds out about this, he’ll skin me alive!”

“You don’t understand, do you?” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”although uncle Liang is against you finding a foreign woman, he doesn’t have any solid evidence, does he? Moreover, you’re so far away from him, he can’t possibly come here and monitor you every day, right?”

“That’s true, but what does that have to do with having a child?” Liang Qichao asked.

“What I’m saying is, you have so many advantages but you don’t know how to make use of them. Aren’t you stupid?” Xia ruofei said,”there’s an irrefutable truth that you have to remember, and that is cross – generational marriage! Don’t be fooled by your father’s curses. If you and Daphne really give birth to a fat grandson for him, do you think he’ll be happy? Besides, the mixed – Blood child is so handsome. Your dad will be so happy that he won’t be able to close his mouth. He’ll want to hold his grandson every day and not let go! Do you believe me?”

“It does make a little sense!” Liang Qichao mumbled.

“You can’t go wrong by listening to me!” Xia ruofei said,”I don’t think the ladies in Australia are so traditional that they have to get a marriage certificate before giving birth, right?”

“It’s normal for people here to fall in love and have children. Some people only get married when their children are quite old!” Liang Qichao said.

“Then isn’t it settled?” Xia ruofei said,”you can discuss this with Daphne. As long as she agrees, it’ll be easy!”

The two of them chatted as they walked, and they soon arrived at the parking lot.

Liang Qichao drove the farm’s Black Mercedes – Benz. He was the driver, with Daphne in the front passenger seat, while Xia ruofei and Liu Kuan sat in the back.

The car drove out of the airport quickly and headed in the direction of Hunter Valley.
