2968 Who’s the fool

Luo Feng said helplessly,”let me finish first!” Young sect leader, even if you want to bid, there’s no need to rush!”

After all, Luo Feng was a golden core stage cultivator and could be considered Wu Ming’s senior. No matter how disgraceful Wu Ming was, he would not not show him no respect.

He waved his hand and said,”uncle Feng, tell me!” Long story short! Don’t miss the time to bid!”

Seeing that Wu Ming still wanted to bid, Luo Feng couldn’t help but smile bitterly and said,””Young sect leader, I suspect that this is a trap set up by someone to waste our spiritual stones!”

“Set up a trap?” Wu Ming couldn’t help but frown.

“Yeah!” Luo Feng quickly replied. You’ve already spread the word that you want that pair of storage rings. Storage rings are so rare these days, and this time they’re in pairs. I’m sure there’ll be a lot of competition! Think about it, young sect leader, if someone were to use this opportunity to provoke you and make you bid at all costs, using up a large amount of your spirit stones, wouldn’t you be powerless when the auction for the storage ring starts?”

When Luo Feng mentioned the pair of storage rings, Wu Ming finally sobered up a little. He indeed valued this pair of rings very much. He had just gotten to know a pair of twin female cultivators some time ago, and now was the time to court them! Wu Ming had the idea of taking the two female cultivators into his room. When he thought of the scene of the beautiful sisters serving him together, he couldn’t help but feel his heart waver. This pair of storage rings was the gift he was going to give to the Twin female cultivators, so he couldn’t afford to lose them. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Uncle Feng, I don’t think it’s possible! It’s only a few thousand spirit stones, it’s far from enough to buy a storage ring. ” Wu Ming said suspiciously.

Luo Feng was a little resentful, but he didn’t want to show it. He could only be patient and say,””A few thousand spirit stones may not be a lot, but if the competition for the storage ring reaches the stage of white heating, these few thousand spirit stones may play a decisive role. What if we end up losing the storage ring because we don’t have enough spirit stones after using up these several thousand spirit stones? wouldn’t that be a great pity?”

“If that’s the case, then I’ll snatch my storage ring!” Wu Ming said with a fierce look in his eyes. It’s not like it’s the first time we’ve done something like murder and robbery!”

Luo Feng said,”if it could be won normally, why would there be any more trouble?” Young sect leader, it just so happens that the other party has offered the highest price. If we stop now, not only will we save a few thousand spirit stones, but we can also let the other party consume a few thousand more spirit stones. That’s more than ten thousand spirit stones in total! It was enough to determine the final ownership of the storage ring! Besides, this price is enough to show our sincerity to the heavenly sect. It’s no longer important whether we’re really going to get the ore or not. ”

Wu Ming was obviously moved, but he was still a little unwilling, mainly because his face had been smacked, and he was very indignant.

It could be said that Luo Feng had watched Wu Ming grow up, so he knew Wu Ming’s character very well. He knew that his persuasion had worked, so he quickly struck while the iron was hot. He leaned close to Wu Ming’s ear and whispered,”Young sect leader, if we stop now, not only will we not lose face, but we will also make the other party a joke! “Besides, we only need to say a few words to get them into trouble ...”

Hearing this, Wu Ming’s eyes immediately lit up and he said,”Oh? Uncle Feng, tell me, what method do you have to make the kid in room 20 a laughing stock?”
