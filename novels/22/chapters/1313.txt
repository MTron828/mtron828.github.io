Wei Jun was both excited and nervous as he followed Hou Liang into the private room.

This private room was not big, but the environment was very elegant. The faint sound of guzheng music lingered in the private room.

Wei Jun saw a middle – aged man sitting behind a simple tea table. There was a chessboard and an incense burner on the table. The air was filled with the faint smell of sandalwood and tea. In the smoke, the middle – aged man’s face was not very clear.

“Big brother Jun!” “Wei Jun!” Hou Liang called out respectfully. Then, he frowned slightly and lightly tugged on Wei Jun’s sleeve.

Wei Jun came back to his senses and quickly greeted Zhao Yongjun respectfully.

Zhao Yongjun was focused on making tea. He looked up with a gentle smile on his face.””Liang, Wei, you’re here! Sit down!”

“Thank you, Jun bro!” Hou Liang quickly said.

Then, he pulled Wei Jun to the seat opposite Zhao Yongjun and sat down.

“Big brother Jun, I’ve already spoken to Wei Jun. If you have any orders, you can just tell Wei Jun directly. He’ll definitely do his best!” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“That’s right, brother Jun!”Wei Jun quickly said. It’s my honor that you need my help!”

“Wei, I heard from Liang that your father is the chairman of the Tongren Tang Group. Do you know a purchasing manager called Chen shun?” Zhao Yongjun asked.

Wei Jun’s face revealed a trace of shame as he said,”Big brother Jun, I don’t know many of the internal staff of Tongren Hall. This Chen shun you’re talking about ... I’ve never heard of his name.”

“But I can go and ask around after I get back. It’s more convenient for me to do things in Tongren Hall,” he added.

“Big brother Jun, if there’s anything you need, just tell me!” Hou Liang said. No matter how difficult it is, as long as it’s related to Tongren Hall, Wei Jun will definitely be able to help you settle it properly!”

Zhao Yongjun slightly widened his eyes and said,””Do I look like the kind of person who would make things difficult for others?”

Hou Liang quickly smiled apologetically and said,”what are you saying?” Who in the industry didn’t know that brother Jun was the most loyal? To his own brother, there’s nothing to say!”

Zhao Yongjun glanced at Hou Liang, then turned to Wei Jun and said,””Little Wei, I’m looking for you this time for something. It’s related to Tongren Hall. It’s a matter of a good brother of mine. I’ll tell you what it is first. If you think you can do it, then please help me. If you have any difficulties, don’t be embarrassed. Just tell me. I won’t blame you!”

“I know, Jun bro!” Wei Jun quickly said.

Zhao Yongjun pondered for a moment, then said,””This friend of mine has a batch of quality Cordyceps. I’m not very familiar with this area, but I’m sure that it’s definitely better than the so – called special herbs sold in the market. He had already reached an agreement with Tongren Hall’s East China region to purchase it ...”

Zhao Yongjun briefly explained the situation.

When Hou Liang heard this, he couldn’t help but interrupt,””F * ck! You’re not talking about ruofei’s company, are you, Jun bro?”

Zhao Yongjun nodded and said,”congratulations, you’re right!” I called ruofei today to tell him that we’re going to the three mountains in two days, and only then did I find out that something like this had happened. As a brother, how can I not do anything about it?”

“Who cares! He had to! This is too F * cked up!” Hou Liang said.

Then, he immediately said to Wei Jun,”Wei Jun, you have to help me with this no matter what!” RUO Fei’s identity is a little special, and he’s on very good terms with us. He’s even a life – and – Death friend of brother Jun. If you do this well, I, Hou Liang, will owe you a favor!”

Zhao Yongjun nodded,”what liangzi said is also what I wanted to say.” Little Wei, if you’re confident, I hope you can help us with this. After this, I, Zhao Yongjun, will owe you a favor!”

Wei Jun quickly stood up and said,”brother Jun, brother Liang, you’re too polite ... What’s with the” favor “?!” Don’t worry, brothers, leave this to me! Just tell me to what extent you’re going to do it. I’ll definitely implement it to the letter!”

Zhao Yongjun pondered for a while and said,”that Chen shun will definitely be taught an unforgettable lesson!” However, the most important thing now was to help RUO Fei solve the problem of funds. Tongren Hall was being too mean! I’ve already made an appointment with old Wang of the year of the crane Hall to see if they can buy this batch of goods. You can decide what to do after I’ve talked to old Wang ...”

Wei Jun almost panicked when he heard this. He quickly said,”Brother Jun, aren’t you slapping my face? This matter was caused by the people under Tongren Hall, so the aftermath would definitely be handled by Tongren Hall! Isn’t it just a batch of aweto? Plus, Jun bro said that the quality of this batch is so good, how can we let an outsider have it?”

The year of the crane Hall was also a large medicine Hall in the capital. It had a long history, dating back to the Ming Dynasty. It could be said to be as famous as Tongren Hall in China. It was just that its development in recent years was slightly inferior to Tongren Hall, and its reputation was not as great as Tongren Hall. However, it was still very powerful.

Moreover, the two companies were absolute competitors in the field of Chinese medicine sales. Wei Jun’s father was the chairman of Tongren Hall, so he naturally knew more about the industry. So when he heard that Zhao Yongjun was going to hand the business to he Nian Hall, he immediately became anxious.
