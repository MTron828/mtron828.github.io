Chapter 1743: Leniency to those who confess (1) Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Xia ruofei was chatting with Wu Qiang. He turned to Song Wei and asked,””What’s going on?”

Song Wei revealed an awkward smile and said,”I think ... I think it’s because we were each other’s fans just now ...”

Xia ruofei also took out his phone. After Song Wei’s explanation, he realized that anyone could see the people he followed on Weibo.

And now, the only “Vivi” account on the following list was very eye – catching.

Since there were so many bored people online all day long, it was not hard to explain why so many people flocked to the only account that Xia ruofei followed.

Xia ruofei saw the endless notifications and private messages on Song Wei’s phone and was a little dumbfounded.

“What do we do?” Xia ruofei asked.

Song Wei replied innocently,”I don’t know ... At most, I won’t use this account anymore. It’s not verified anyway. I don’t usually post anything about my personal Weibo. It’s not like no one can find out!”

As the daughter of a senior leader, Song Wei was very aware of this. Although she had registered a Weibo account a few years ago, she spent most of her time watching and rarely posted anything herself.

In fact, if Song Wei’s historical Weibo had been searched by the public, if there were any traces left behind, they would have been dug out long ago.

Xia ruofei laughed bitterly to himself. Although there was no problem with Song Wei, he could easily cause trouble in his own backyard!

As expected, Xia ruofei had just used WeChat to inform Feng Jing to arrange for a Weibo operator to follow the company’s official Weibo, the pharmaceutical factory’s official Weibo, and the verified Weibo accounts of some of the company’s senior executives. Then, he received a WeChat message from Ling Qingxue.

The content of the WeChat message was very simple, just four words: “You’re on Weibo?”

These four simple words sent a chill down Xia ruofei’s spine. He smiled bitterly as he informed Wu Qiang and Song Wei. Then, he took his phone and left the backyard to return to his own courtyard.

Then, Xia ruofei gave Ling Qingxue a call.

Ling Qingxue did not throw a tantrum and quickly picked up Xia ruofei’s call. She smiled and said,””Xia yingxiong, you reacted faster this time!”

Although Xia ruofei had been away from the three mountains for a long time, he had been in frequent contact with Ling Qingxue through WeChat and phone calls. After the qishang incident, he had been in contact with Ling Qingxue as soon as possible. He had called her at least once a day when he was in Saipan, Australia, and after he returned to Beijing.

However, the Weibo incident was too sudden. Moreover, the other party involved was Song Wei. Xia ruofei was more or less guilty. Although nothing had happened between him and Song Wei, he was not completely clueless about Song Wei’s thoughts.

Xia ruofei smiled,”Qingxue!” I need to explain to you about the Weibo incident ...”

“Explain what?” Ling Qingxue pretended to be confused.

“The account that I’m following!” Xia ruofei said honestly,”that’s song Wei’s account. “The company helped me apply for a real – Name verified Weibo account for marketing purposes. It was just opened today and the company wanted me to send a Weibo message to inform the netizens. Song Wei and the others happened to be hanging out with me and Song Wei kept saying that she wanted to follow me. I didn’t think too much and followed her, but I didn’t expect the netizens to overinterpret it ...”

Xia ruofei did not know what he was thinking, but when he explained to Ling Qingxue, he said “Song Wei’s group” instead of “Song Wei.” Perhaps he subconsciously felt that if Song Wei was alone, it would be easier to cause a misunderstanding with Nannan, even though that was the truth.

By saying that, Ling Qingxue could at least feel that there were a lot of guests here and Song Wei was not alone.

Ling Qingxue chuckled and said,””I’m not thinking too much, why are you in such a hurry to explain?”

Xia ruofei thought to himself,”you didn’t think too much. Why would you send me a WeChat message so quickly?” However, he still had this bit of emotional intelligence, so he naturally wouldn’t expose him.

“After all, this matter has caused quite a stir on the internet,” he said with a smile.”I’m worried that you’ll misunderstand!”

Ling Qingxue was silent for a moment, then said,””Ruofei, you’re different than before. You’re being watched by so many people. You’d better pay attention to your movements from now on ...”

“Yes, yes, yes!” Xia ruofei said,”I was careless this time. I’ve never used Weibo before! This time, the company mentioned it to me a few times, and I couldn’t persuade them otherwise, so I agreed to open it. Who knew that such a big mistake would happen on the first day!”

Then, Xia ruofei asked politely,””Qingxue, what’s your Weibo account?”

“Why do you ask?” Ling Qingxue smiled and said,”I don’t really use Weibo.”

“You have to tell me first!” Xia ruofei said,”don’t tell me you don’t have a Weibo account!”

Ling Qingxue hesitated for a moment, but still told Xia ruofei her Weibo account.

Xia ruofei memorized the Weibo name and said,””Qingxue, I’m almost done with my business here. I should be back at the three mountains in a week at most.”

“Oh ...” Ling Qingxue was a little happy, but she still pretended to be nonchalant and said,”it’s time for you to come back and take a look. I’ve never seen a boss who doesn’t do his job properly like you. It’s fortunate that your employees can bear with it ...”

Xia ruofei asked,”are you busy?” We’re not going to rest for a few days, so let’s go overseas for a trip?”
