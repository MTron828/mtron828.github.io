1951 Small trick (2)

He didn’t speak very quickly because he had more time to think and to prevent himself from saying the wrong thing.

The female reporter didn’t want to let him go so easily and immediately asked,””But, according to the rumors on the internet, the adulterous affair should have happened when Liu haojun was the Deputy Secretary, right? Shouldn’t the Changping District Committee be involved in the investigation?”

“The investigation will definitely be carried out,” Zeng jianzhang said with a smile.”It’s just that comrade Liu haojun has already returned to his hometown in Beijing, and the person involved in the incident you mentioned can’t be contacted for the time being, so the investigation has not made any progress. Even if ... I’m just assuming! “Even if the rumors on the internet are true, it’s still within the scope of a lifestyle problem and not related to a crime. According to the organization’s discipline, the most severe punishment is punishment from the party. Now that comrade Liu haojun has resigned from his position, it’s much more serious than punishment from the party ...”

Zeng jianzhang paused for a moment before he continued,””Here, I also sincerely hope that all media friends here will pay more attention to the achievements of our Changping County, instead of focusing on some groundless news. If they only report these after – Dinner gossip, I think it will be difficult for such a media to have any big development. There are still many things worth reporting in our Changping County! For example, the introduction of the Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory project this time can greatly promote the development of the county’s economy and provide more and more employment positions ...”

Regarding the introduction of the project, the county party Committee had arranged the information and thought of some possible questions from the media in advance. They had also prepared the answers in advance, so when Zeng jianzhang spoke about this, he was obviously much more fluent.

“That’s my answer. I hope this reporter friend will be satisfied. ” Zeng jianzhang ended his answer with a smile.

“Thank you, Secretary Zeng,” the female reporter said.”I still have one last question. Is that okay?”

At this moment, Zeng jianzhang definitely had to show a friendly attitude. He smiled and raised his hand.””Ladies have special privileges! I don’t think the other reporters would mind, so please go ahead!”

The female reporter had a faint smile on her face and asked,””Secretary Zeng, it’s said that the project to bring in Tao Yuan pharmaceutical factory was previously handled by Deputy Secretary Liu haojun, but there wasn’t much progress. However, after it was changed to Deputy County Head Wu, this project was easily won in just two to three days. Is there any inside story behind this?”

Zeng jianzhang’s face showed a hint of displeasure.

He didn’t know what the female reporter’s purpose was, but all the questions she asked involved Liu haojun. The question just now was not a question, but a checkmate.

If there was such a thing, didn’t it mean that he didn’t know people well and made a mistake in his decision? If there was no such thing, the female reporter might be able to come up with other evidence to refute him.

Moreover, the female reporter’s questions were all about Liu haojun, which made Zeng jianzhang feel that something was wrong.

He stared at the female reporter for a few seconds before he slowly said,””I don’t know where you got this information, but what I want to say is that comrade Liu haojun was indeed in charge of this work when he was in office. Deputy County Head Wu thought that she had been studying in Beijing before, and this time, it was for the organization’s needs, so he asked her to take a temporary leave to come back and take charge of this work. This was just the normal division of work, there was no inside story. “In addition, no work can be done overnight. Deputy County Head Wu was able to discuss this project in such a short period of time because of comrade Liu haojun’s effective work. His work has laid a solid foundation for the subsequent negotiations!”

Even though Liu haojun did nothing, Zeng jianzhang had to pinch his nose and praise him a little. Otherwise, it would be difficult to answer this question full of traps.

Of course, Liu haojun had already packed up and left, so there was no harm in giving him a few free praises. It was like a person who had passed away. The life announcement at the memorial service would be full of words of praise. Even if the person’s life was full of misdeeds, no one would criticize him at his funeral.

After Zeng jianzhang answered the question, Wu Liqian immediately said,””Friends from the media who are going to ask questions later, please be careful not to stray from the topic. Let’s continue with the questions. The man in the striped suit on the left of the third row, please ask!”

This time, Wu Liqian specifically picked a reporter she knew, because she was worried that the situation just now would happen again.

Zeng jianzhang had responded appropriately just now and didn’t leave any evidence for the media to say.

After all, he was an old Secretary who had been in a leadership position for so many years, and his words were watertight.

The male reporter stood up and said,””Thank you, host. I’m a reporter from the Sanshan megacity newspaper and the Sanshan megacity network. This question was for director Xia. I would like to ask why the Paradise Corporation chose to invest and build a factory in Changping County? Would the company’s strategic focus shift to cosmetic production in the future? Thank you!”

Xia ruofei had been watching the show.

Actually, when the female reporter asked the second question, Xia ruofei also felt that something was wrong. He thought of the female reporter’s company, Yanjing E family network, and his heart was moved. It was a website under the Beijing newspaper group. Liu haojun’s father, Liu Qunfeng, was a Deputy Minister of the publicity department and also the chairman of the Beijing newspaper group.

It seemed that Liu haojun was not willing to lose. Even if he had been pulled down from the stage, he still wanted to mess things up! Xia ruofei said in his heart.

The only reason why the people from Changping knew so little about Liu haojun’s background was that they would not have arranged for the female reporter to sit in the center of the room. Wu Liqian would also not have asked her questions.

In that case, he could only ask Zeng jianzhang questions after the press conference. However, this way, the impact would not be as great as the questions at the official press conference, and Zeng jianzhang could continue to play Tai Chi.

Xia ruofei’s mouth twitched. Liu haojun was too narrow – minded. He could only resort to such disgusting tricks. In reality, no matter how much Yanjing’s E family spread the news, it would be difficult to cause any substantial damage to Changping and the Tao Yuan company.

Xia ruofei’s mind was filled with these thoughts, so he couldn’t help but be a little distracted.

Xia ruofei came back to his senses after the reporter asked his question. He touched his nose awkwardly and said,””I’m sorry, I didn’t hear you clearly just now. Can you please repeat it again?”

“Alright! I want to ask Chairman Xia, why did you choose to build a factory in Changping County? also, does the launch of this project mean that the strategic Center of paradise Corporation will shift to cosmetics production in the future?”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”actually, you have two questions.” The first question is very simple. Whether it’s the geographical location or the investment environment of Changping, it meets our requirements. In addition, everyone knows that our paradise Corporation has a farm located in Changping. This time, we plan to expand the farm’s scope at the same time, and have optimized the land acquisition plan. In the future, the factory and the farm can be connected together, which will be more conducive to management ... Of course, there’s a more important reason, and that is that Changping County has given us many preferential measures. It could be said that he was full of sincerity! Once again, I would like to thank Secretary Zeng, County Head Zhu, and Deputy County Head Wu for their support and help to the Paradise Corporation!”

Xia ruofei paused and continued,””The second question. Do you want to move the company’s strategic Center? In fact, the pharmaceutical factory is only one of the core businesses of our paradise Corporation. I can’t deny that this is very profitable, but I think our company’s determination to develop in multiple ways will not change! And after the new factory is built, half of the production line will be used for the production of the heart – nourishing soup. I hope it can help more children with autism!”

“Right, Speaking of which, let’s also announce a piece of news!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m
