Chapter 925: The daylilies are getting cold (1)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei and the others could not help but look over. They saw the white man rolling forward like a meatball. His sparse yellow hair shook up and down, making him look very comical.

As he walked, he said loudly,””Carter, cabeli! I was delayed by something on the way. Sorry to keep you waiting! I’m sorry ...”

However, looking at the expression on his face, there was not the slightest sense of guilt. Instead, there was a trace of pride.

Old West and his wife heard the sound and came out of the house.

Old West looked at the ‘meatball’ and said with a hint of dissatisfaction,””Robinson, we agreed to meet at three in the afternoon. You’re two and a half hours late!”

The fat Robinson said indifferently,””There’s something going on at my winery. You know ... A big winery like mine is very busy. Alright, alright, Carter, let’s not bother about these details. Where’s cabalie ...”

At that moment, Kelly came out of the house and stood beside Old West.

Robinson showed an exaggerated expression and said,””Oh! My Dear Kelly, you’re still as beautiful as you were when you were young!”

Xia ruofei, Lin Qiao, and Liang Qichao all had strange expressions on their faces. They really couldn’t tell what was so beautiful about Auntie kabeli. Not to mention other things, just her bucket – like waist was probably not something that ordinary people could enjoy!

However, looking at Robinson’s chubby body, he was a ton heavier than aunt Capella.

This person’s aesthetic sense was somewhat unique.

Old West’s face turned even uglier. He snorted and said,””Robinson, punctuality is the most important quality of a businessman!”

“Alright, alright,” Robinson said with a shrug.”I already apologized, didn’t I?”

His attitude was still so nonchalant, without any sincerity at all.

“Carter, let’s talk about the winery!” Robinson said. You know, my winery is really too busy, I don’t have that much time to waste. ”

Old West and cabalie looked at each other and then opened their mouths.

However, before he could speak, Robinson said,””Actually, I’ve already made it very clear on the phone. We’ve carefully evaluated and think that the situation of West Winery can barely meet our acquisition requirements. However, 1.5 million Australian dollars is the highest price we can offer.”

“Robinson, actually ...” Old West said.

“No, no, no, Carter, let me finish first!” Robinson waved at Old West and said,”I’m here today to give you a final offer. 1.65 million Australian dollars! After all, my dear cabalie was once my dream lover when I was young ... Oh, Speaking of which, I still feel regretful now! “Kelly, reality has proven how wrong your choice was back then! If you had chosen me instead of Carter, you would have owned the largest wine Manor in the entire Hunter Valley ...”

“Enough! Robinson!” Old West finally couldn’t take it anymore and loudly interrupted Robinson’s mumbling.”Please stop talking about cabalie! Also, our West Winery doesn’t welcome you. Please get out!”

Robinson couldn’t help but be stunned for a moment, then said,””Carter, have you thought it through? Other than me, no one else would offer such a high price!”

Auntie caitley’s expression was also very ugly. She looked at Robinson with disgust and said,””You don’t have to worry about it, Robinson! We’ve already found a new buyer!”

In the room, Xia ruofei and the other two were trying their best to hold back their laughter. They had not expected to hear such an interesting thing.

It seemed like uncle Carter, aunt cabalie, and that fat pig – like Robinson had a lot of stories when they were young!

However, Xia ruofei did not dare to imagine what aunt kabeli looked like when she was young.

Of course, many Western women’s figures would start to go out of shape after they were middle – aged. Even though Auntie kaberli’s waist was as thick as a bucket and her face was full of meat, she might have been a hot beauty when she was young!

Outside, Robinson was dumbfounded. After a while, he said,””A new buyer? You’re not joking, are you?”

“We don’t have time to joke with you,” Old West said impatiently. Robinson, we’ve already signed the merger and acquisition contract. ”

“Even if we can’t find a buyer, it’s impossible to sell the winery for 1.65 million Australian dollars,” added Kelly. Robinson, I’m afraid you’ve made a wasted trip!”

This time, it was Robinson’s turn to have an ugly expression.

In fact, even though he acted like he didn’t care and was deliberately late, it was just a business trick. In fact, he was still very interested in the West Winery.

Robinson was the owner of the largest winery in the Hunter Valley area, the Golden Oak winery. Just as Xia ruofei and the others had guessed, Robinson and old West were good friends when they were young. Back then, both of them were chasing after Kelly.

In the end, she naturally chose Old West.

Although the size of Robinson’s winery was far larger than West ‘s, West’s centuries – old heritage, especially its unique Semillon brewing technique, made Robinson drool with desire.

This time, Old West was in a hurry to sell the winery for cash. Robinson thought that his chance had come. At first, he deliberately lowered the price, but this time, he increased it a little. He knew that Old West had no other choice but to sell the winery.

What he didn’t expect was that he was only two hours late, and the West Winery had already changed owners.

Is Carter trying to trick me? A few days ago, he was still looking for buyers everywhere like an ant on a hot pan! Even if someone was interested in the winery, how could they sign an acquisition agreement in such a short time? Robinson said to himself in his heart.

Purchasing a winery was a rather complicated process, and the intended buyer had to do a lot of inspection and evaluation in advance. Robinson knew everything about West Winery, so he had even arranged for a professional to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the winery.

Of course, this kind of evaluation was different from the evaluation of a third – party organization. They analyzed the value of West from the perspective of gold oak winery, as well as the weaknesses of the negotiation and so on. They provided Robinson with suggestions on the acquisition.

With that thought in mind, a devious smile appeared on Robinson’s face.””Carter, we’re all smart people. Let’s just skip these little tricks! I know you guys hope to sell it for a better price, but I’ve already shown my greatest sincerity. The price of 1.65 million can’t be any higher. ”

“You think I’m lying?” Old West said with a strange expression,”Robinson, you’re too confident ...”

“Oh, really? Could it be that someone really settled on an acquisition for two million Australian dollars in such a short time?” Robinson shrugged and said,”that sounds more like a fantasy! Carter, can you tell me what your final price was?”

“I’m sorry, but that’s a business secret!” Old West didn’t have the chance to speak, but Auntie Kelly spoke up first.

Robinson whistled and said,””Business secret, that’s a good excuse ...” He said.

At this moment, a young voice was heard.””It doesn’t matter if I tell you. Our deal was two million Australian dollars!”

“Xia!” Old West saw Xia ruofei coming out and said,”I’m sorry to have disturbed you and your friend ...”

Xia ruofei shook his head with a faint smile, then looked at Robinson with a mocking smile.

“Two million Australian dollars!” Robinson exclaimed,”my friend, as far as I know, Carter’s offer is only 1.8 million Australian dollars!”

“I know. But I think the West Winery is worth that much. ” Xia ruofei said indifferently.

“You’re Chinese?” Asked Robinson.

In the eyes of Westerners, Chinese, Wei nation, and Koreans all looked the same, and it was impossible to tell their nationality apart.

This was the same feeling that Chinese people had when they saw Europeans and Americans.

Robinson had a bad feeling. He had lived in the Hunter Valley for a long time, so he knew that there were rich people everywhere in China. Rich people from all over the world could be seen waving checkbooks and buying businesses.

If this young man was Chinese, it would not be impossible to buy West Winery for two million Australian dollars.

Xia ruofei nodded.”Yes, sir. What can I do for you?” he asked.

Have you really signed the merger and acquisition agreement?” Robinson said, unwilling to give up.

“I’m very sure!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”and it was lawyer heinte who personally helped us to draft the merger and acquisition agreement.”

“F * ck ...” Robinson cursed in his heart.

Robinson knew that his plan had failed this time. He looked at the old westerns unwillingly and thought that they were really lucky to have met a rich Chinese man who was stupid!

Robinson said with a smile,””Then, congratulations, Mr. Xia! However, it’s not easy to run a winery. Every year, there are wineries in the Hunter Valley area that close down, and many of them were purchased by your Chinese compatriots, so ... I still wish you good luck!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Mr. Robinson, even if all the wineries in Hunter Valley close down, my winery will not. In fact, we will grow bigger and bigger. Who knows, one day, we might come to your house and buy it!”

Then, Xia ruofei added,””By the way, I’ve hired uncle Carter and aunt cabalie as the managers of our winery with a high salary. I’m sure uncle Carter will definitely come to visit us on time!”

Xia ruofei emphasized the word ‘on time’ to mock Robinson for being late by two to three hours.

When Robinson heard that Xia ruofei had not only bought the winery at a high price, but had also paid a high salary to keep old Wester and his wife working in the winery, his face turned even uglier.

“Alright!” He said with a cold face. I’m looking forward to that day. Goodbye!”

“I won’t send you off!” Xia ruofei said indifferently.

He was already speaking as the owner of West Winery.

The fat on Robinson’s body trembled, and he turned around and left without a word. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Laughter also came from the West Winery, and this laughter reached Robinson’s ears. He couldn’t help but slap the steering wheel, and then he sucked in a breath of cold air in pain. He kept rubbing his hands ...
