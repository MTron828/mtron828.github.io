Chapter 784: The return of the loyal soul (1)

The members of the lone wolf assault team were cleaning up the battlefield in an orderly manner. Guo Zhan had already sent someone to inform the local police and relevant military departments. The bodies of these Japanese and other follow – up work would naturally be taken care of by the corresponding departments.

The comrades from the intelligence Department were also rushing to the three mountains, mainly to confirm the identity of these Japanese and to check if they had any useful information on them.

As for negotiating with the Wei nation, under normal circumstances, they wouldn’t do that.

Moreover, it was impossible for the Wei nation to recognize these people as special agents, which was also a common practice in the intelligence departments of various countries. If special agents were sent overseas to carry out missions, once they were caught in an accident or killed, the country would definitely not admit it, and at most, they would privately compensate their families.

However, the loss of seven or eight elite agents was not small, and the Wei nation could only suffer in silence.

Xia ruofei slowly walked out of the brick kiln, took off his helmet, and held it in his hand. He looked at his former comrades cleaning up the battlefield. This familiar scene made him feel very emotional.

“Do you miss the old days?” Guo Zhan’s voice came from behind Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei turned her head and saw Guo Zhan holding the helmet in one hand and the cigarette box in the other. He tapped the helmet lightly, and a cigarette jumped out in half.

Guo Zhan passed the box of cigarettes to Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei took out the cigarette and put it in his mouth. On the other side, Guo Zhan also had a cigarette in his mouth.

Xia ruofei took out a lighter and lit Guo Zhan’s cigarette before lighting his own.

After taking a deep breath, Xia ruofei let out a long breath of smoke, as if he was sighing heavily.

“Yup!” Xia ruofei sighed.”I miss the barracks, the brothers, and the battles we fought together ...” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“You’re quite poetic, kid!” Guo Zhan smiled and said,”alright, let’s cut the crap. Let me ask you, do you want to go back to lone wolf? As long as you say the word, I’ll take care of the procedures for your second enlistment. ”

......

Xia ruofei’s ability in this operation made Guo Zhan’s eyes light up.

Although it was only a very short battle, Guo Zhan, who was good at grasping the details, noticed that Xia ruofei’s abilities in all aspects had not deteriorated after his retirement. On the contrary, the current Xia ruofei seemed to have improved in all aspects compared to the Xia ruofei who had served in lone wolf more than a year ago.

This caused Guo Zhan to develop a love for talent.

He knew Xia ruofei’s background very well. In the past, he had trained Xia ruofei as a backbone. If Xia ruofei had not been diagnosed with an incurable disease, he would not have let such a talent go. He might have been promoted to a Senior Sergeant or promoted.

Now, not only was Xia ruofei’s depression gone, but his ability was even better than before. Guo Zhan hoped that Xia ruofei could return to the lone wolf assault team through his second enlistment.

Xia ruofei was moved by Guo Zhan’s suggestion.

He was different from most retired soldiers. He wasn’t forced to leave the Army due to limited development, nor did he strongly request to leave the Army. If he hadn’t fallen ill, he would definitely have continued to serve in lone wolf.

The seven years in the Army were the most memorable days of Xia ruofei’s life.

However, the thought of going back was only a fleeting thought in his mind. Soon, he sighed and shook his head.

Now, he definitely couldn’t go back. The Paradise company was growing stronger and stronger, and it was no longer his business alone. There were hundreds of employees who relied on him to eat. Moreover, he also had a divine weapon like the spirit painting scroll. In the collective living environment of the military camp, it was inconvenient to use it.

“Wolf King, we can’t go back ...” Xia ruofei said with a bitter smile.

Guo Zhan’s expression slightly froze,”Why? Don’t you like the life in the military? With your ability, I can even guarantee that I’ll help you rise in rank within two years. This can become a lifelong career. Or are you reluctant to part with the local wealth and glory?”

Xia ruofei said in a low voice,”none of them ... Now that my company is getting bigger and bigger, this is no longer my personal problem. If I leave the company and go back to the Army, what about my employees?” Besides ... There are other reasons. It’s not realistic to return to the Army ...”

Guo Zhan was silent for a moment before he nodded.”Understood.”

Seeing Xia ruofei’s low mood, Guo Zhan patted his shoulder and said,””Blood Wolf, you will experience different things at different stages of your life. For you, lone Wolf’s story is over. You should start a new chapter!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,””Mm! Captain, no matter where I am, I will always be lone Wolf’s soldier! I’m willing to go to war for the country whenever there’s a need! It’s still the same ...”

At this point, Xia ruofei looked at Guo Zhan. The two of them smiled at each other and said in unison,””If there’s a battle, I’ll return!”

The two of them lightly hammered their chests, and then two hard fists collided.

……

Soon, a large number of police and military vehicles arrived at the scene. All kinds of vehicles were parked all over the road, and the cars that arrived later even stopped on National Highway 218.

The usually quiet lower poplar village had suddenly become lively.

However, the Army had already imposed control on the scene. There was a guard every three to five steps, separating the onlooking villagers from the scene.

General Guo gave a simple report of the situation, and after a brief handover, he quietly left the scene with the members of the lone wolf assault team.
