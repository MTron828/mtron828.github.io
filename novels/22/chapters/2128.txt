2129 Set sail (2)

Qin Lan could only try to persuade him. Seeing that Xia ruofei insisted on doing so, she had no choice but to say,””Alright then! Mr. Xia, you’re alone at sea, so you must be careful ...”

Qin Lan had a very good impression of this bright and rich young man. Of course, she didn’t want anything to happen to him.

For some reason, a scene from a movie appeared in Qin Lan’s mind uncontrollably. In that movie, a group of friends drove a yacht out to sea. When they reached the calm open sea, everyone jumped into the sea and swam. Even a girl with deep sea phobia was thrown into the sea by everyone like a prank, leaving only an infant on the yacht.

Then, to everyone’s horror, they realized that they had not lowered the accommodation ladder. They could not exert their strength on the sea, and no one could reach the side of the boat. After that, a series of terrifying things happened.

Although this was a horror movie, Qin Lan’s deepest impression was that everyone was soaked in the sea. There was only a yacht around them that could be seen but could not be boarded, and then there was the vast sea. As long as she put herself in that position, she could feel the helplessness.

Of course, Xia ruofei did not know what was going on in Qin Lan’s mind. Even if he did, he would just laugh it off. For a cultivator, it was easy to fly onto a boat in the situation in the movies.

Of course, the power of nature was awe – inspiring. Even cultivators who were much stronger than Xia ruofei could lose their lives in the face of the power of nature. Xia ruofei would not let his guard down.

The staff untied the cable and threw it onto the yacht. Xia ruofei skillfully tied the cable and waved at Qin Lan. Then, he walked into the cabin with his big backpack.

He casually placed his backpack on the circular sofa in the reception area, then continued to walk forward a little bit and entered the cockpit.

Qin Lan stood on the dock and watched as the yacht started to move slowly towards the direction of the open sea.

She didn’t leave immediately. Instead, she waited until the yacht became smaller and smaller in her field of vision until it was completely out of sight. Then, with a trace of worry, she got on the electric car and returned to the Yacht Club.

On the yacht, Xia ruofei was sitting in the driver’s seat leisurely. He was not controlling the yacht but it was still moving forward steadily.

After the yacht was delivered, Xia ruofei not only upgraded some of the equipment but also added a global autopilot system.

Generally speaking, yachts were mainly used for offshore travel, so even some luxury yachts were not equipped with global autopilot systems. This system was mainly used on some ocean ships.

The system was very expensive and needed to be updated regularly. However, Xia ruofei did not hesitate and chose to install it.

This time, Xia ruofei had experienced the convenience of the system on the yacht.

After the route was set on the main control computer, the yacht would follow the GPS positioning and travel along the set route. When it reached the set turning point, it would automatically turn, and it would also adjust its error according to the weather, wind, and other factors.

At the same time, there were also some other auxiliary functions, such as maintaining a flight path for a long time, warning off course, warning of approaching targets, and so on.

It could be said that after the installation of this system, the yacht pilot’s hands were greatly liberated.

Just like now, Xia ruofei was sitting in front of the driver’s seat with a glass of fresh fruit juice in his hand. He just had to monitor the data from time to time. It was very easy.

After leaving the coastal waters, there were fewer and fewer ships in the surrounding area. The land was also left far behind and finally disappeared from sight.

The last thing he could see was the endless sea, as if he was the only one left in the world.

The route that Xia ruofei had set was very simple. After going out to sea from the three mountains, they would head east. They would make a slight turn North of taisheng Bay Island, pass through the entire East China Sea, and enter the Pacific Ocean. After that, there was no further route set.

After all, it was at least a few hundred nautical miles across the East China Sea. With the yacht’s cruising speed, it would take at least more than 20 hours to sail continuously.

Since there was no specific destination for this trip, Xia ruofei decided to take it one step at a time and enter the Pacific Ocean first.

After the yacht set sail, Xia ruofei released the restrictions on the spirit map space. This way, the white fox could sense the outside world without any obstacles.

Usually, Xia ruofei would seal off this kind of feeling. He did not want the White realmfox and Xia Qing to watch him in the space when he was having sex with Ling Qingxue.

The scenery of the ocean was extremely beautiful and vast. The boundless scene of the sea and the sky merging into one could make one’s heart unconsciously open up.

However, as time went by, he would gradually find it boring. Humans were social animals. After being away from the hustle and bustle of the world, it was as if he was the only one in the world. Even someone as powerful as Xia ruofei could not avoid that sense of loneliness.

Of course, Xia ruofei had undergone strict training in the Army. He did not have any psychological problems. He just felt a little bored.

Fortunately, in order to increase the probability of finding the realm stone, Xia ruofei did not blindly approach the island when he set the route. Instead, he deliberately let the yacht pass by some uninhabited islands. This way, with the white fox’s sensing ability, if there were really realm stones on those deserted islands, it would be able to detect them in time.

Therefore, after the yacht sailed for a while, they would occasionally see an Island.

After Xia ruofei went out to sea, the White realmfox no longer looked sickly. Instead, it perked up and sensed the aura of the realm stone that might exist in the outside world.

However, the probability of encountering a realm stone on such a lucky voyage was very low. The White realm Fox had not discovered anything yet. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei set off at around 11 am. Other than the small part of the ship that was manually driven, the rest of the ship was left to the autopilot system. At about 5 pm, Xia ruofei saw the ship’s flight path on the main computer. The ship had already traveled more than 160 nautical miles and was far from land. It had passed by a few deserted islands along the way, but the white fox did not find anything.

Xia ruofei was already mentally prepared for such a situation, so he was not in a hurry.

It was almost evening. Xia ruofei turned off the autopilot and stopped the yacht. In order to prevent the yacht from drifting away with the current, Xia ruofei carefully anchored it.

After the engine was turned off, the yacht became even quieter, and the sound of waves gently hitting the hull could be heard.

Xia ruofei took out some lychees, cherries, bread, and milk for dinner.

He came to the stern deck and sat on the soft recliner, eating while looking at the sun in the west.

After Xia ruofei left the harbor from the three mountains, he had been heading east. It was already evening and the sun was in the direction he had come from. It was no longer as hot as it was at noon. It looked like a huge red fireball, dyeing the sea red.

The white fox was squeaking anxiously in the medium. It was very unhappy that Xia ruofei had stopped the yacht. However, Xia ruofei enjoyed his dinner on the sea unhurriedly and enjoyed the rare sunset on the sea. He only stood up and walked to the cockpit when the sun had completely fallen below the sea level and the sky was getting dark.

Xia ruofei said as he walked,”little guy, don’t be so anxious!” Haste makes waste ... Besides, it’s so dark tonight, how dangerous would it be to sail the ship! I’ve decided to continue for a while on your account, but you must stop the ship and sleep before eighto’ clock! I’ll only have energy tomorrow if I rest well!”
