Translator: 549690339

Just as he had guessed, two abalones were missing from one of the freezers, and the abalones in this one were all ten to twenty grams short of the standard of a one – headed abalone.

Although Xia ruofei did not listen to any reports regarding the arrangements of the auction, he had worked with Feng Jing for a long time and had a good understanding of each other. Hence, he could guess Feng Jing’s intentions almost immediately.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but praise Feng Jing’s idea and looked at her with admiration.

Feng Jing happened to look at Xia ruofei at this moment. Their eyes met and they smiled at each other.

When the guests and reporters below the stage saw the moving stove being pushed up, they couldn’t help but discuss it.

At this time, Feng Rao smiled and said,”in order to let everyone have a direct understanding of the top – grade abalones for today’s auction, our paradise Corporation has specially prepared two top – grade abalones. We have invited the Michelin star chef, Mr. Liu fuwang, to personally cook them. In a while, everyone seated in the VIP area, as well as the 30 lucky guests, will personally taste the top – grade abalones personally prepared by Chef Liu!”

With a boom, it was as if the audience had exploded. Everyone suddenly revealed an expression of surprise and then began to discuss.

Even the wealthy people in the VIP area had a strange expression on their faces, feeling that it was a little unbelievable.

Each of the guests and media reporters received an introduction booklet. They knew very well that although some of the abalones put up for auction today had not yet reached the standard of a one – headed abalone, they were actually very close to it. They were definitely much bigger than the typical two – headed abalone.

Even if the top – Quality abalones, which were only 10 to 20 grams short of the standard of a one – headed abalone, were taken out for everyone to taste, they would still be worth a lot.

As the saying goes, it’s hard to buy two – headed abalones with a thousand pieces of gold, not to mention that these were basically one – headed abalones.

“This paradise Corporation is really going all out!”

“I didn’t expect this mainland company to be so bold!”

“Did any of you win the prize just now? My number is only missing one character ...”

Everyone was talking animatedly, and the 30 people who had won the lottery were all overjoyed. They had been nonchalant just now, but now they were both surprised and happy.

This was especially true for the media reporters. Their entire fortune might not even be enough to buy such an abalone at today’s auction, but because they won the lottery, they actually had the opportunity to taste the legendary one – headed abalone!

Moreover, with such a gimmick, it would be easy to write a draft when he went back!

Those 15 lucky reporters could definitely write a very convincing article. After all, they had personally tasted this precious auction item!

Some of the reporters couldn’t help but stand up and ask,””Miss Feng, are you sure the abalones cooked in the steamer are the same as the ones being auctioned later?”

“Of course,” Feng Rao replied without hesitation. Every single one of our items for today’s auction has a serial number and a record of their weight. We’ve even taken a photo for safekeeping. The two abalones that have already been cooked are still packaged. When they’re ready to be cooked, you can send a representative to verify them with the photo in the brochure!”

Feng Jing paused for a moment before she continued,””Of course, the two abalones we’re using are the lightest of all the items for today’s auction. However, they’re still more than 500 grams each, far exceeding the standard of a two – headed abalone!”

After Feng Jing finished speaking, the reporter immediately asked,””Then, are the abalones that are slightly below the standard and the abalones that exceed the standard of a one – Head abalone of the same quality?”

“All the abalones are raised in the same batch and are from the same place!” Feng Rao smiled and said,”but there are also tall and short brothers and sisters. We can’t guarantee that every abalone is the same, right? However, I can tell everyone responsibly that their quality is definitely the same, and there won’t be any major fluctuations!”

“Miss Feng, may I know ...” Another reporter stood up.

“I’m sorry, we’ll arrange a Q & A session for the media after the auction. ” Feng Rao smiled and said,”I can’t answer everyone’s questions now! I believe that after everyone has tasted it personally, they will definitely have an intuitive understanding of our paradise corporation’s abalone! This is much better than what I said. ”

Feng Jing’s words drew friendly laughter from the audience.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but smile. It seemed that Feng Jing knew that if she didn’t stop these reporters from asking questions, they would continue to ask questions and the entire venue would be in chaos.

After all, Feng Jing had seen a lot of things. Xia ruofei was not worried about her ability to control the situation.

Soon, Liu fuwang nodded at Feng Ye, indicating that the abalones were ready.

Hence, Feng Jing followed her promise and randomly picked a few guests and reporters to come on stage to check the abalones.

In fact, when everyone saw the huge size of the abalone that Liu fuwang took out, they already believed in Qianqian. Besides, it was impossible for the Paradise Corporation to cheat in such a situation. Wouldn’t that be ruining their own reputation?

However, the representatives still looked at the abalones carefully and noted down the serial number on the packaging. They checked the photos through the brochure and finally confirmed that these were indeed the two abalones in today’s auction.

Many of the people below the stage could no longer sit still. They all excitedly stretched their necks.

The 30 lucky ones were even more excited. They sat in their seats with anticipation and looked at the top – grade abalones on the stage.

Liu fuwang started to process the steamed abalone. He was going to make abalone with chicken sauce.

Liu fuwang was very familiar with the process. He had prepared all the seasonings beforehand and had a few assistants to help him. Soon, the two abalones were ready. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

The fragrance of the top – grade abalone began to spread throughout the venue. Everyone couldn’t help but inhale, their hearts filled with anticipation.

Liu fuwang picked up the knife and started to cut the abalone. The assistants kept passing him small plates. Liu fuwang moved the knife quickly. Soon, the huge abalone was cut into thin slices and placed on the plate. Then, he poured a spoonful of soup on it.

Plates were already placed on the table beside them. Every time a set was prepared, the assistants would take it and place it on the plate neatly.

Liu fuwang was very fast. In a short while, he had divided the abalone into 60 equal portions.

There were at least seven to eight pieces of abalones on each plate, which showed how big the two abalones were.

After all the abalones were cut up, the ceremonial ladies began to line up, each holding a plate, and walked down the stage to the VIP area to begin distributing.

There were also six ceremonial ladies standing on both sides of the stage, also holding plates in their hands.

Feng Rao picked up the microphone and said with a smile,”Now, let’s invite the guests and media friends who won the prizes earlier to come up and collect the abalones with their tickets!”

The winners who couldn’t wait any longer immediately stood up from their seats and walked up with their tickets under everyone’s envious eyes.

On one side was the reception area for media reporters, and on the other side was the reception area for guests.

There were staff members on both sides who were in charge of verifying the vouchers and distributing the small plates with the top – Quality abalones.

In a short while, all sixty abalones were distributed.

Without Feng Jing’s words, the rich and ordinary guests in the VIP area, as well as the 15 reporters who had won the lottery, all eagerly picked up their chopsticks and began to taste the precious abalones.

As soon as he chewed, the chewy texture and fresh fragrance bloomed in his mouth. It was as if every taste bud cell was cheering for joy.

“It’s too delicious!” An ordinary guest couldn’t help but exclaim,”this is what a real abalone is!”

“The taste is so special!”

“I can’t believe I got to taste the top – grade one – headed abalone. My life is really worth it ...”

The guests and reporters who had tasted the abalone couldn’t help but praise it. One of the guests even said loudly,”I just wanted to join in the fun, but I didn’t expect this abalone to be beyond my imagination. I must bid for one today and let my wife and children have a good taste!”

For a time, the sound of praise rang out from every corner of the venue.
