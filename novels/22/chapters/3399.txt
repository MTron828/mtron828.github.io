Chapter 3400: Tracking by the incense (2)

Translator: 549690339

Just like that, the two of them slowly climbed down another hundred meters. During this period, Xia ruofei was on high alert. Even though his spiritual power could not extend far, he did not dare to carry it for even a second.

The two flying swords were also by his side at all times, ready to be activated at any time if anything happened.

However, it was strange that apart from this terrifying poisonous fog, the two of them did not encounter any other dangers along the way. Even though this fog was terrifying, any cultivator in the Golden core stage would be able to form a protective Yuan Qi barrier. Therefore, even though the poison seemed dangerous, it could not cause any harm to cultivators in the Golden core stage.

However, after climbing more than 100 meters, the source of the fragrance was still below the two of them, and they didn’t know how far it was.

In total, he had spent almost two hours.

A third of the six hours had passed without them realizing it, but the two of them had not even seen the shadow of the goldthread nether snake.

Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but feel anxious. Xia ruofei, on the other hand, was very calm. He followed the scent down bit by bit. He believed that this mission wouldn’t run out of time without even seeing the goldthread nether snake. This didn’t match the original intention of the trial tower.

Xia ruofei had a feeling that the trial Pagoda was mainly used to select talents. He did not know how long the trial Pagoda had existed, but at least it was used to select talents at a certain time.

The two of them continued to descend bit by bit. In such terrain, their speed could not be increased, and no matter how anxious they were, they could only climb down step by step. Moreover, the situation below was unclear. Even if they could increase their speed, the two of them did not dare to rush into each other.

Just like that, they climbed down another 60 meters or so. Xia ruofei felt that the fragrance was much stronger.

He didn’t know if it was his illusion, so he couldn’t help but ask,””Qingxue, don’t you think the fragrance is getting stronger?”

“Yeah!” Ling Qingxue replied. 1 thought I was hallucinating! RUO Fei, do you think… We’re very close to the source of the fragrance?”

In fact, this fragrance becoming stronger was a gradual process. However, after arriving at this location, there seemed to be a sudden change, making the two of them clearly feel that the fragrance was stronger.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”it’s possible!” Let’s keep up the good work! Even if 1 can’t complete the mission, at least let me see a real goldthread nether snake! Otherwise, it would be too cowardly!”

“The golden thread nether snake is a late – Stage golden core cultivator, and it’s extremely poisonous,” Ling Qingxue said. If we really meet, if we can’t defeat it, it’ll be easy to escape!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”it’s poisonous. 1 have a formation.” Late Jindan … I might be able to deal with them, but no one knows if I’ve fought them before!”

Shen tianfang, who was killed by Xia ruofei, was very close to the late – Stage of the Golden core realm. As a human cultivator, he would have more means than a demonic beast. The Dharma Treasures and life – saving cards on Shen tianfang were not something a demonic beast could have.

Of course, according to the perceptual mirror, the snake’s cultivation was equivalent to a cultivator at the peak of the advanced stage of the Golden core realm. It was probably more powerful than Shen tianfang.

However, Xia ruofei’s strength had improved a lot compared to when he fought Shen tianfang.

There was no need to say anything about the doubling of his mental energy. His improvement in array Dao was also very obvious. He also had several ready – made fire attack array techniques. In addition, his sword control was more flexible and smooth. This was practice makes perfect because he had been using the flying sword of the bent frost this entire time.

There was also the elemental energy. This was one of Xia ruofei’s biggest advantages. Because of the elemental storage Pearl, Xia ruofei’s elemental energy was very abundant. The elemental storage Pearl alone contained all the elemental energy of an early – Stage nascent soul cultivator. Hence, in terms of the total amount of vital Qi, Xia ruofei’s vital Qi was definitely stronger than the golden thread nether snake’s. This meant that he did not have to worry too much about the consumption of vital Qi. He could also use some of the more powerful but also more exhausting ultimate moves and techniques as he wished.

In addition, his biggest trump card, the spirit map space, allowed Xia ruofei to more or less have the strength to fight against the golden thread nether snake.

“In any case, you must be careful! Safety first!” Ling Qingxue said.

“No, it should be your safety first!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”l have to ensure your safety first!”

Ling Qingxue’s heart was filled with sweetness. She couldn’t help but sigh and say,””Actually, it’s not necessarily a good thing for me to be with you. I feel like I’ve become a burden to you. If it weren’t for me, you would still be able to focus on completing the mission … If only 1 wasn’t randomly assigned to you. At most, I’d just be eliminated a few levels earlier!”

Xia ruofei said,”silly girl, what nonsense are you talking about?” When you weren’t by my side, 1 was always worried about you, do you know that? That kind of distraction was even more serious! With you by my side, my heart is much calmer, and 1 can display my strength better, right? Besides, who said you were a burden? you reminded me several times and provided me with new ideas. Otherwise, 1 would have walked into a dead end!”

Ling Qingxue knew that Xia ruofei was comforting her. In reality, she had not played a big role in the process of completing the mission. She had also repeatedly become Xia ruofei’s burden, making him unable to go all out.

However, Ling Qingxue still smiled sweetly and said,””I’m not as powerful as you say! But now that fate has tied us together, no matter how difficult it is, we can only walk down this path together!”

“That’s the right way to think!” Xia ruofei said,”let’s go down together and see how powerful that goldthread nether snake is!!”

“We still don’t know if that fragrance is guiding us to the goldthread nether snake!!” Ling Qingxue said with a smile.

“I have a feeling that if we follow the scent, we’ll definitely find the goldthread nether snake. Let’s make a bet if you don’t believe me!” Xia ruofei said.

“I’m not betting with you!” Ling Qingxue’s face turned red.”Every time you propose a strange bet, it’s so embarrassing!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but burst out laughing.

The two of them rested for a while before continuing to climb down the cliff.

Sure enough, as the altitude decreased, the fragrance became stronger.

This land of fragrance that directly affected the soul was even more intense than the fragrance that one could smell with the nose.

It was just like when Xia ruofei, Ling Qingxue, or Song Wei combined their spirit bodies to cultivate. The feeling was several times more intense than when they had sex in real life.

The fragrance was getting stronger, and the temptation was getting stronger.

Ling Qingxue, whose mental power was slightly weaker, actually couldn’t help but increase her climbing speed. This was a sign that she was being attracted by the fragrance.

Fortunately, Xia ruofei was strong enough and was not affected at all. He even used his spiritual power to wake Ling Qingxue up in time.

The two of them climbed another 20 to 30 meters before they stopped at the same time.

Because at the lower left of the two, the cliff was no longer bare. An unknown green plant grew on the cliff, as if it was full of life.

This plant was about two feet tall. It reached out from the cracks in the cliff and then grew upward.

The leaves of this plant were thin and long, and there were sharp teeth on the side. At the top of the plant, there were already two Vermilion fruits.

Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue’s gazes fell on the fruits. It was obvious that the alluring fragrance came from these two fruits. They were the ones who had led Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue here. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but take a few more looks at the Vermillion fruit. He realized that the fruit seemed to have ripened. On the Vermillion skin, there were some golden stripes. It looked very attractive and made people want to take a bite.

Even Xia ruofei felt that his desire to eat the two fruits was quite strong, and he could barely control it….
