Feng Jing was slightly taken aback, but she maintained a faint smile on her face and did not say anything. She knew that Liu Qian would definitely convey Xia ruofei’s orders to her in the shortest possible time.

Sure enough, Liu Qian immediately said,””The chairman said to arrange for President Liu of kyokuboku group to give a speech on stage.” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Feng Rao nodded and smiled.”Next, let us welcome the founder and CEO of kyokuboku group, Mr. Liu Dong, on stage with a warm round of applause!”

Feng Rao looked in Xia ruofei’s direction.

As the lights were dim, she could not see clearly. She could only see a faint smile on Xia ruofei’s face.

Liu Dong, who was standing beside Xia ruofei, stood up and buttoned his suit as he strolled towards the stage.

At the entrance of the stage, he took the microphone from Liu Qian and then strode to the center of the stage.

Liu Dong smiled at Feng Jing and said,””Congratulations, Mr. Feng. Today’s press conference was very successful. I think your jaded skin cream will be popular before it’s even sold!”

“Thank you, boss Liu!” Feng Rao replied with a smile.

She didn’t know Xia ruofei’s intention of arranging for Liu Dong to go on stage, so she didn’t say anything more and just let Liu Dong take control of the stage.

Liu Dong quickly turned to the audience and spoke into the microphone,”Just now, in the audience, the bosses of Jumei group, Weiping shopping mall, Gold Rush Group, and several other e – commerce companies have reached a preliminary consensus with Chairman Xia of peach blossom company. Now, on behalf of these e – commerce companies, and of course, our jingbei shopping mall, I am very honored to announce something!”

At this point, Liu Dong paused and looked around the audience, then continued,””That is ... Peach blossom company’s Jade skin cream will be sold at the same time in our five e – commerce companies! For the specific online time, you can pay attention to the official website of paradise Corporation or the website of our five companies ‘shopping mall. Our jingbei group will open a reservation channel at midnight tonight. Friends who are interested can make a reservation first! You’ll get first – hand information on the sale of the jaded skin cream!”

Feng Rao was surprised and overjoyed. She was immersed in joy.

Products, publicity, and channels were all indispensable.

The Paradise Corporation didn’t lack good products. Now, their funds were much richer than before, and the funds for publicity were also much more abundant. This press conference was a very good example, and it could be said that they had put in a lot of money.

However, the construction of the channel was not done overnight.

E – commerce companies like kyokuboku group and gold Rush Group controlled the largest sales channels in China.

Nowadays, online shopping had become a part of life. As long as one could keep up with the times, they were used to buying things on the gold – Rush group’s Taobao and Skycat. A considerable number of people relied more on kyokubei mall when buying home appliances, office computers, mobile tablets, and other products.

The sales of the cosmetics in Jumei mall, Weiping mall, and so on were also quite amazing.

The fact that these e – commerce sites could sell the jaded skin cream at the same time solved a big problem that had been troubling Feng Jing for a long time.

Moreover, looking at Liu Dong’s state, it was clear that this was not as simple as providing channels. It was obvious that e – commerce websites such as jingbei group would invest a lot of resources such as advertising spots on the front page to promote the Yushi cream.

With a good product, an explosive and hot news conference, and now an invincible channel, the popularity of the jaded skin cream was irreversible ...

After the audience stopped clapping, Liu Dong continued,””I’ve just talked to director Xia in the audience. Not only will our jingbei shopping mall provide jaded skin cream at three prices, but the limited edition skin password series will also be the first sale on our five websites worldwide! If you are interested, don’t miss this opportunity. You should know that there are only 100 bottles of secret Jade skin cream sold in China every year!”

After speaking, Liu Dong smiled at Feng Jing and left the stage.

Feng Rao quickly recovered from her joy and quickly said,””Dear guests and media friends! That’s all the content we’re going to release today! Next, everyone can enter the experience area that we have specially set up from the East Passage. We have prepared a large number of jaded skin cream experience equipment for everyone. You can try the magical effects of jaded skin cream for yourself!”

“Friends who wish to leave, please take the West corridor. Don’t forget to collect your gifts at the entrance counter. Our company has prepared two Jade skin cream experience suits and one of miss Dave’s new album for everyone!” Feng Jing bowed to the audience and said,”alright, thank you for coming! Thank you! Thank you!”

As soon as Feng Jing finished speaking, the lights on the stage dimmed. She walked towards the entrance of the stage and removed the microphone.

In just a few minutes, Feng Jing felt like she had just taken part in a long race. She felt completely exhausted.

Fortunately, the press conference went well and the results were far better than expected, so she felt relaxed at the moment.

“Boss Feng, well done!” Xia ruofei personally stood at the entrance to welcome Feng Jing.

Feng Rao glanced at Xia ruofei and said,””What’s the use of saying it now when you’re lazy and refused to do it? I’m willing to do anything for you, capitalist!”
