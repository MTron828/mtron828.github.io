With a bang, the puppet fell to the ground and stopped breathing.

Xia ruofei looked up and saw that the puppet’s head had been shot by a bullet at close range. Although there was no blood flowing out, it was likely that the core had been destroyed, so it naturally lost its ability to move.

Xia ruofei felt much more at ease now that he could deal with the puppet with a pistol.

Although he had cultivated a top – notch technique like the great Dao Arts, he had not dabbled in any techniques that involved fighting between cultivators.

Just like when he was fighting with the puppet, he relied more on his strong physical fitness and special Forces combat skills. In this case, it was not a big problem to protect himself, but it was also difficult to cause damage to the rough and thick – skinned puppet.

In comparison, Xia ruofei had more confidence in using guns to solve the problem.

After being in the Special Forces for a few years, Xia ruofei was familiar with all kinds of firearms, not to mention this standard pistol. In addition, he still had a lot of bullets stored in his interspace. Even if he encountered multiple puppets, he was confident that he could escape unscathed.

Xia ruofei checked the bullets in his magazine and then squatted down to check the puppet.

The more he looked, the more familiar he felt. He couldn’t help but Mutter to himself,””Why does this Golem look so much like the sculptures on the two sides of the corridor? Don’t tell me those sculptures ...”

When he thought of the dense sculptures on both sides of the corridor when he first entered the underground palace, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel a chill in his heart. If these sculptures were all fearless puppets, what a terrifying force it would be!

Xia ruofei felt that the underground palace was getting more and more mysterious. He started to doubt Song Wei’s speculation that it was a Ming Dynasty Tomb.

Even if it was the Tombs of the Nobles or even the Imperial tombs, it was impossible for there to be mythical beasts or puppets, right?

At this moment, Xia ruofei felt a strong gust of wind.

He was still crouching on the ground to check on the puppet, so he quickly rolled forward. At the same time, he quickly scanned the surroundings from the corner of his eye, and sure enough, he saw another puppet appear.

This time, the two puppets attacked him together, one from the front and one from the back.

Xia ruofei looked at the clothing and facial features of the puppets. He felt that they were the statues on the two sides of the corridor. Perhaps they were usually in a petrified state. He did not know what triggered them to wake up and start attacking the intruders.

Xia ruofei used his agile movements to deal with the two puppets while thinking quickly in his mind.

If all the statues were to wake up, Song Wei would be in even more danger.

Xia ruofei was a little anxious. He didn’t want to continue fighting. He took the opportunity when he passed by the two puppets and rushed forward.

The two puppets were obviously not like Xia Qing, who had a certain level of self – consciousness. When they saw Xia ruofei escape, they didn’t say a word and flashed in Xia ruofei’s direction.

As Xia ruofei was charging forward, he saw two more puppets appear in front of him. They formed a pincer attack with the previous two puppets.

Xia ruofei frowned. It seemed like he couldn’t just hide. If he did that, he would attract more and more puppets. Even if he had a gun, he might not be able to deal with them!

Xia ruofei made up his mind. Since that was the case, he would kill one if one came, and kill two if two came.

After he made up his mind, he no longer hesitated. As he ran, he raised his hand and fired two shots.

Although he was running at a high speed and did not aim at all, Xia ruofei’s marksmanship was not that simple. He had been trained to shoot tens of thousands of bullets every year. One of the two bullets directly blew up a puppet’s head, and the other shot missed because the puppet stopped in its tracks by accident and hit its neck.

The puppet whose head had been blown off fell to the ground, but the puppet whose neck had been shot looked as if nothing had happened. A fatal injury to a normal human had no effect on the puppet. His eyes were red as he surrounded Xia ruofei with the two puppets behind him.

At this moment, the two puppets had already caught up to him. Xia ruofei could even feel the sharp killing intent behind him.

He was very calm and didn’t even look back. He raised his hand and fired a shot behind him, while his body moved sideways.

The puppet in front of Xia ruofei was pouncing towards him. After losing its target, it could not change its direction. The puppet behind him happened to pause after being shot, so the two puppets collided and fell to the ground at the same time.

Although it did not cause any harm, Xia ruofei was waiting for this fleeting opportunity.

Two of the puppets fell to the ground, and the path of the other puppet was blocked.

Xia ruofei had won a few seconds. For a Special Forces elite like him, a few seconds could do a lot of things.

Xia ruofei raised his gun and aimed at the only puppet that was standing. He took a quick aim and fired.

Bang! Bang!

The bullet accurately entered the puppet’s forehead and flew out from the back of its head.

There was only a small hole on the puppet’s forehead, but there was a large hole on the back of its head.

The puppet maintained its forward charging posture, but its upper body involuntarily leaned back under the impact of the bullet, and it fell to the ground face up.
