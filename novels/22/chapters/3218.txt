3219 The fragile blue water flying boat (2)

Chen Nanfeng waited for his two friends to finish before he said,””I remember fellow Daoist Xia also said that the environment in outer space is not only extremely cold, but also extremely hot. Under the alternation of cold and hot, I’m afraid it will be more difficult for the jadewater flying boat to withstand it.”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,””That is indeed the case. In addition to the extreme cold and heat, the universe is filled with all kinds of cosmic rays that are invisible to the naked eye, which can also damage the materials of the Flying Ship. If the materials used to build the Flying Ship are not strong enough, there is indeed a risk of collapse. ”

In fact, only high – Level cultivators like Chen Nanfeng, Mu Sheng, and Liu Mansha would have been killed by the cosmic rays if they were ordinary people exposed to outer space like this. Or, they would have been frozen into popsicles or frozen mummies before they were killed by the cosmic rays.

“Looks like I’ll have to change my plan!” Mu Sheng said with a sigh. Then, his eyes lit up and he said,” Just now, brother Chen said ... There’s a Space Station in the sky that orbites around the Earth all year round, and there’s always ordinary people living inside?”

Xia ruofei nodded.”To be precise, there’s an International Space Station. Our country also has the Tiangong experiment module. Of course, it’s smaller than the space station, but it’s also designed for long – term stay.”

Mu Sheng clapped his hands and said,”then isn’t it settled?” If we steal the International Space Station, wouldn’t it be great to take this Space Station to the moon?”

Liu Mansha’s eyes lit up when she heard this.”Sect leader mu, that’s a good idea! Since even ordinary people can survive in there, cultivators naturally have no problem!”

Even Chen Nanfeng couldn’t help but show a hint of interest.

The Clearwater flying boat had only flown out for a short while, but it had already caused a certain degree of damage. Chen Nanfeng was very distressed. After all, no one had the ability to repair the flying boat now.

Moreover, at this rate of damage, the Clearwater flying boat would completely collapse before it could reach the moon. At that time, everyone would die in the vast space.

Therefore, it was necessary to find another way. Mu Sheng’s suggestion provided another way of thinking.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but smile bitterly. He didn’t know how to explain it to these “science – ignorant” people. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

In the end, Xia ruofei tried his best to explain in layman terms,””Three seniors, I’m afraid that’s not realistic. Whether it’s our country’s Tiangong or the International Space Station, they can only fly around the Earth. They rely on the effect of gravity to orbit the earth, but if they want to fly to the moon, they must break free from Earth’s gravity, which is something space stations don’t have. ”

The International Space Station naturally had a propulsion system, but it was prepared for orbital fine tuning when necessary. It wasn’t enough to break away from Earth’s gravity and fly to the moon.

Of course, Xia ruofei did not tell the three golden core seniors about the International impact.

If the International Space Station disappeared, it would probably cause global panic.

However, Xia ruofei felt that Chen Nanfeng and the others would not care much about it.

After hearing Xia ruofei’s words, Chen Nanfeng asked in disappointment,””Fellow Daoist Xia, is this method really not going to work?”

“It definitely won’t work!” Xia ruofei said with certainty.

“Then what should we do?” Mu Sheng said,”since the methods of the cultivation world are useless, we can only rely on the technology of ordinary people!”

“That’s right!”Chen Nanfeng nodded. I remember fellow Daoist Xia saying that the Americans landed on the moon 50 to 60 years ago. We’ll go to the United States let them send our people to the moon!”

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly.”Three seniors, I’m afraid the United States doesn’t have any ready – made rockets and spaceships ... Those were the products of the struggle between the United States and the Soviet Union decades ago. At that time, the Apollo program cost a lot of money. In fact, as of now, landing on the moon is more symbolic than practical. Therefore, for the past few decades, the United States has not launched any moon landing programs. In other words, even if the Americans want to return to the Moon, they don’t have any ready – made equipment. They have to build it from scratch. This is a systematic project, and I’m afraid it won’t be completed in a year or two. ”

“This can’t do, that can’t do ...” Mu Sheng frowned and said,”are we just going to watch the moon above us and know that there may be a top – tier treasure land and secret realm, but we can’t go there at all?”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Seniors, please calm down ... Actually, I have an airboat too. I think we can try to see if my airboat can withstand the outer space environment before we make any plans.”

Mu Sheng was not in high spirits. He said,”little brother Xia, brother Chen has already tried his Clearwater flying boat. I’m afraid it’s meaningless to try your flying boat again!” You’ll even damage your flying ship for no reason, isn’t that not worth it?”

Liu Mansha’s thoughts were similar to Mu Sheng ‘s, so she also nodded and echoed,””I think it’s more appropriate to think of other ways.”

However, Chen Nanfeng’s heart moved and he said,””I think ... There’s no harm in trying!”

Mu Sheng was a little anxious when he heard this. He said,””Brother Chen, you’ve just experienced it yourself. You know how bad the environment outside is. The jadewater flying boat was damaged in such a short time. It’s a bit inappropriate for you to ask brother Xia to take the risk with the treasure!”

In the current cultivation world, flying ships were considered extremely precious treasures.

Although flying boats couldn’t assist in cultivation or help people fight back, flying magical treasures were very rare. Compared to riding a flying sword, it was much more comfortable. In the current situation where the highest cultivation level in the cultivation world was not even at the Yuanying stage, the flying boat was still a divine tool for escape. The speed of most cultivators ‘flying sword was not as fast as the flying boat.

Mu Sheng had always been fond of Xia ruofei, so his words were also quite protective of Xia ruofei. Even when he was facing Chen Nanfeng, the top master in the cultivation world, he did not speak with false courtesy.

Of course, this was also because Mu Sheng and Chen Nanfeng had a good personal relationship. The two would not fall out over such a small matter.

Xia ruofei looked at Mu Sheng gratefully and then smiled.””Thank you for your kind intentions, sect leader mu. However, I’m still very confident in my Black Blaze flying ship. Besides ... We’ll only know if it works after we try!”

Chen Nanfeng looked at Mu Sheng with a smile and said,””Brother mu, did you hear that? Fellow Daoist Xia is very confident! Also ... Do you think that I’m the kind of person who would harm others without benefiting myself? Since fellow Daoist Xia proposed this plan, I believe he must have his own reasons. Shouldn’t we show our support?”

Actually, what Chen Nanfeng said wasn’t important.

He didn’t say the most important reason.

He had once sent someone to investigate Xia ruofei in secret and knew that Xia ruofei’s Black flying boat was extremely fast. At least in terms of performance, it was much better than the Clearwater flying boat.

Therefore, Chen Nanfeng was also looking forward to seeing if Xia ruofei’s airboat could withstand the harsh environment in outer space if the Clearwater airboat could not do the job.

Regardless of whether it worked or not, Chen Nanfeng at least knew that Xia ruofei’s Black Swift Boat would not be as fragile as the Clearwater Swift Boat.

Moreover, everyone was experienced this time and would not be caught off guard. Even the black flying boat could not withstand such an extreme environment. Chen Nanfeng felt that he could at least ensure that Xia ruofei’s Black flying boat would not be damaged as badly as the Clearwater flying boat.

Mu Sheng said helplessly,”since you’ve said so, what else can I say?” Let’s try it!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”in that case, let’s go now!” Strike while the iron is hot!”
