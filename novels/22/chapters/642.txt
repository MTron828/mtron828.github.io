Chapter 643: Chapter 462 – advancing side – by – side_2

Moreover, the recruitment process was the first to make progress.

The first employee of the pharmaceutical company’s research Institute was a master’s student from the southeast Chinese medical University. His name was Xue Jinshan. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

His major was acupuncture and massage. As a master, he was involved in clinical Chinese Medicine Research. He met the recruitment requirements of Xia ruofei’s company.

What was even rarer was that Xue Jinshan had come into contact with drug approval work in one of his tutor’s projects when he was a graduate student, so he could be considered to have relevant experience.

At the moment, Chinese medicine – related majors weren’t very popular. Xue Jinshan couldn’t stay in school after graduation, and it wasn’t easy for him to find a job. He couldn’t get into the big hospitals in the provincial city, and he wasn’t willing to return to his hometown’s Chinese medicine hospital to waste his time. On the other hand, the salary offered by paradise company was quite good, and it was no less than the income of a tertiary Grade A hospital in the provincial city. So, after some hesitation, he finally accepted Feng Jing’s recruitment.

After Feng Rao and Xue Jinshan had reached an initial agreement, they reported to Xia ruofei.

She knew that Xia ruofei placed great importance on the release of the new drug, so he would report any progress as soon as possible.

Xia ruofei also knew that his company was not attractive enough at the moment, so he did not have high hopes for recruitment. He knew very well that those industry leaders with academic achievements would not be interested in paradise pharmaceuticals. Hence, Xia ruofei was very satisfied with the fact that he was able to recruit a Graduate student who was specialized in this field so quickly.

He immediately took time out to meet Xue Jinshan. Of course, manager li and Jiang Hua had not come up with the budget yet, so Xia ruofei would not be too busy for the time being.

That afternoon, Xia ruofei saw Xue Jinshan in his office.

This was a young man who looked quite spirited. He wore a pair of gold – rimmed glasses and looked refined.

Xia ruofei’s attitude was very gentle. He smiled at Xue Jinshan and said,”Mr. Xue, please sit!”

Xue Jinshan was a little reserved. After the two of them took their seats in the reception area of the office, the General Manager’s assistant, Liu Qian, served Xue Jinshan a cup of tea and left.

......

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”Mr. Xue, did CEO Feng talk to you?” Are you satisfied with the treatment our company is offering?”

“Director Xia, the benefits and benefits of paradise Corporation are very good, even beyond my expectations. I’m sure I’ll be very satisfied,” Xue Jinshan immediately said.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”we’re thirsty for talents!” Although our paradise pharmaceuticals is a newly established company and the relevant procedures are still under approval, our company is very confident in the development of paradise pharmaceuticals, and this confidence comes from our products. We’re about to launch a brand new Chinese medicine preparation. This is a product that will fill in the gaps, so we definitely won’t have to worry about sales!”

Xue Jinshan’s expression slightly changed as he asked,”President Xia, this is also something that I’m very interested in. May I ask ... What is the main function of the new medicine that the company is preparing to launch on the market?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,””A special medicine for autism.”

Xue Jinshan couldn’t help but take in a breath of cold air. He looked at Xia ruofei with a strange expression and his heart was in turmoil.

Could he have met a scammer? Xue Jinshan said in his heart.

As a medical graduate student, Xue Jinshan was well aware of what kind of disease autism was. He was also well aware that there was no medicine that could effectively treat it.

This was a newly established company, and a completely layman boss actually said that he had developed a special medicine for autism? And he even ambitiously wanted to sell it on the market? Xue Jinshan felt that his brain wasn’t enough to process this.

However, he did not think that Xia ruofei was a liar.

The company was right there, and such a big farm couldn’t be rented, right? Spending so much money to trick me? What did he have that was worth being lied to? He wouldn’t get much money even if he sold himself!

Moreover, Xue Jinshan had done his homework when he received the invitation. He had a certain understanding of paradise Corporation, and Feng Jing’s career history could be found online.

How could he be a scammer!

Then there was only one possibility, and that was that the boss had been cheated! He had been bewitched by someone and bought an unreliable prescription, thinking that he could make a fortune from it.

Thinking of this, Xue Jinshan looked at Xia ruofei and said,””President Xia, with all due respect, where did you buy the formula from? So many years of research have shown that autism can’t be cured with medicine. This is the common understanding of the medical world ...”

He had not even been officially hired yet and he was already questioning his boss, suspecting that his boss had been cheated and became a spendthrift. This Xue Jinshan was really stupid. However, Xia ruofei did not take it to heart. Instead, he admired Xue Jinshan.

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Mr. Xue, I didn’t buy the formula. It’s an ancient formula that was passed down from my family.”

“The ancient prescription says it can treat autism?” Xue Jinshan asked with a strange expression.

“Of course not! Its main function is to strengthen the spleen and Qi, improve intelligence, warm the kidney and nourish the brain, nourish the liver and kidney, dispel phlegm and open apertures, and clear meridians. ” Xia ruofei said,”however, there is an obvious improvement after the autistic patient takes it. I won’t hide it from you. The effect of the drug has been tested by a seriously autistic patient ...”
