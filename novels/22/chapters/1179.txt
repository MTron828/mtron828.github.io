Xia ruofei smiled.”It’s okay. Just give me the statistics by tomorrow morning. Tell me how many more viewers we need.”

Feng Rao looked at Xia ruofei and smiled.””So, even though you’re not in the capital, you’ve already planned a strategy and decided a victory from thousands of miles away!”

“That’s right! I can’t let CEO Feng do a one – man show on stage!” Xia ruofei laughed.

“You’re still talking about it!”Feng Rao pouted. This kind of occasion should be attended by a Big Boss like you, but now you’re pushing it all to me ...”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Capable people do more work. Capable people do more work. I’ll be responsible for being your strong backing!”

Feng Rao’s face turned red for no reason.

Xia ruofei didn’t notice it. After teasing her, he smiled and asked,””Is everything settled for the live broadcast?”

Feng Jing nodded.”I’ve already discussed with a few big video websites. We’ve bought the first tier advertisement spots on their front page. Also, our official website has temporarily added a server. We’ll be broadcasting the video live at the same time.”

Actually, Feng Jing didn’t think it was necessary at all.

Big companies ‘new product launch conferences were usually live – streamed on the Internet, and they would usually only choose a large video website. This was a win – win cooperation, and generally, the website would not charge a fee, or only charge a small fee.

However, their peach blossom company’s press conference was all about spending money to buy advertising space, and they even had to hire a professional production team, so the money spent was simply too much.

The press conference this time could be said to be the biggest investment paradise Corporation had ever made in publicity since its establishment. This was under the premise that the spokesperson, Duff, was helping for free. Otherwise, it would have cost even more money.

Although Feng Jing knew the importance of publicity, she didn’t expect Xia ruofei to make such a big move at once. In total, he had spent two to three million Yuan, which made her a little scared.

“Very good!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”CEO Feng, don’t be afraid of spending money. Our product is good, but if we want to create a strong public opinion effect in a short time, we can’t save money!”

“I know, don’t worry! There won’t be any mistakes at the press conference!” Feng ke said.

She was also very clear that the jaded skin cream would become an important profit point for the Paradise Corporation. According to cost calculation, this was the first profiteering product of the Paradise Corporation, so she could understand Xia ruofei’s thinking of throwing money into publicity.

However, she was worried that the money spent would not have any effect, especially if there were only a few people present. When the time came, she would not know how to set up the live broadcast machine. Was it possible to face the empty stands?

Of course, since Xia ruofei had said that he could handle the audience, Feng Jing did not have to worry about it.

“Is everything alright with the gifts and the experience area?” Xia ruofei asked.

“They were all in place yesterday!” Feng Jing said confidently,”the pharmaceutical factory rushed to make a batch of experience suits, and each one can be used two to three times. In addition, we also rushed to make 100 sets of formal suits at different prices, so we made an extra 500 sets basic style. These products were sent to Beijing through the logistics channel the day before yesterday.”

“OK! That means everything is ready except for the crucial wind!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”President Feng, it’s all up to you tomorrow!”

“As long as the audience is taken care of, there won’t be any problems.” Feng Jing smiled bitterly.”But I can’t guarantee the publicity ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”don’t worry!” I’m here for everything! It’s getting late, you should go back and rest! I’ll be busy tomorrow!”

“That’s great. Chairman, you should rest early too!” Feng Rao stood up after speaking.

After Feng Jing left, Xia ruofei took out his phone and made a few more calls. He then went back to his room to rest.

......

The next afternoon, at the entrance of the Beijing University of Technology’s Stadium.

Flags with the LOGO of the Paradise Corporation and the image of Duff were placed on both sides of the road, fluttering in the wind.

It was around oneo’ clock in the afternoon, more than an hour before the press conference.

From time to time, there would be people walking on this road, and their destination was the stadium ahead.

Most of them were carrying camera bags, wearing waistbands, holding recording pens, and wearing waistbands or recording pens. There were also various media symbols on their waistbands, recording pens, and microphones. At a glance, one could tell that these were reporters known as the uncrowned Kings.

Other than the reporters, there were also some people walking towards the stadium in groups of two or three.

These were the audience members who were participating in the press conference. They had all obtained an electronic invitation through online recruitment.

Many of them knew each other and started to greet each other from a distance.

Huang Yu was a professional moneymaker. Every day, he would search for all kinds of prize – winning activities on online forums. Whether it was a competition that required voting, some big promotions on e – commerce platforms, or events like today’s conference where the organizers would provide gifts, he would actively participate.

Huang Yu happened to see the news of peach blossom company’s new product launch on Weibo. When he saw that the venue of the launch was the capital University of Technology’s Stadium, he immediately took the attitude of giving it a try and helped to repost Qin Zhuan’s registration requirement on Weibo. The only requirement was to repost friends.

From Huang Yu’s point of view, anyone who could hold a press conference in a big Stadium like the capital city University of Technology’s Stadium was usually very generous. If they could get an invitation, they would definitely get a lot of rewards.
