2795 A Dragon (2)

After passing Messi and artil in a row, Xia ruofei took a big step forward and then rushed forward like a fully – wound spring.

Bar?a had just maintained their offensive formation. The moment they turned from attack to defense, there would definitely be a loophole. Xia ruofei’s movements were extremely fast as he passed Messi and artil. There was no pause in his opportunities. Therefore, although several of Barcelona’s players in the middle and backfield also quickly moved closer to them, they were still a little far away.

Xia ruofei wanted to kick the ball out before they could surround him.

Xia ruofei’s speed was very fast. Before Busquets and lakitik could form the door, he passed through the gap between the two like a flash of lightning.

There was a wide expanse of flat land ahead!

No one could stop Xia ruofei’s speed.

At this time, Xia ruofei was the person closest to Barcelona’s goal. His teammates, including Wu Lei and iglasias, were all behind him.

Hence, Xia ruofei did not have any other thoughts and rushed forward with the ball.

Xia ruofei’s speed was very fast. In the blink of an eye, they had already crossed half the stage. At this time, the right back, Semedo, rushed over from the side with a very strong momentum. He had obviously made up his mind that even if the ball passed, he would not let him pass! Even if it meant getting a yellow card.

Bar?a’s rear defensive line was not in place yet, and Xia ruofei was already facing the defensive players directly. It could be said to be very dangerous.

However, he still miscalculated.

Some people couldn’t be kept even if they wanted to.

Xia ruofei first made a rough jump to the ball and dodged the ball that was coming for him. Then, he passed by the other side of the ball and ran in a big arc toward the ball.

The experienced Semedo used his shoulder to RAM into Xia ruofei.

At this moment, Xia ruofei’s body was leaning very hard to resist the centrifugal force.

If it had been any other player, he would have lost his balance and fallen.

If he could do that, he would be satisfied.

What’s more, there was a possibility that the referee would think it was a reasonable collision. In that case, he wouldn’t even need to take a card and could resolve the opponent’s most incisive attack.

However, after he hit Xia ruofei, it was as if he had hit a steel plate. He could not help but fly out.

He had thought that if he could not break Xia ruofei’s balance, he would throw Xia ruofei down and stop him from going deeper into the territory. However, not only did the collision not knock Xia ruofei down, but he was also sent flying backward. Naturally, he did not have the chance to commit a tactical foul.

However, Xia ruofei did not seem to have been affected by the foul. He did not slow down at all and caught up with the ball very quickly.

Xia ruofei’s kick was very powerful. It was more like a pass than a man – ball pass. However, the target of the pass was not any of the Spanish players, but himself two or three seconds later.

Previously, Xia ruofei had only wanted to get the ball as far away from the penalty area as possible to give the team some breathing space. But now, Xia ruofei had an even bolder idea.

Now, the only one in front of him was the bar?a Center – back, pique, who was jokingly called “see through by pique” by the Chinese fans.

There was an interesting story behind the nickname that Chinese fans had given him,”see through the skin.”

12-13 At the start of the season, Real Madrid played against Barcelona. Before the game, pique said in an interview that he could see through all of Crick’s feints. As a result, Crick was able to heel through him during the game, so his nickname of pique seeing through became famous!

In an interview with the reporters yesterday, piker said,””I know that Spain has brought in more than one Chinese player. What I want to say is that the strength of the Chinese players can not meet the requirements of La Liga at all. The Spanish team brought them in just for marketing, for the huge Chinese market! Wu Lei and Zhang Chengdong from valekano are the same!” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

When pique’s words spread to China, it naturally caused strong dissatisfaction among the Chinese fans.

Although Wu Lei’s strength was not particularly strong in European football, he could not be ridiculed by others. Not to mention that Wu Lei had a certain ability, and it was not entirely a product of marketing, as piker said.

Of course, pique himself did not care about Gong Jie’s big mouth. It was not the first day or two that he had offended so many people. He did not care about another group of Chinese fans.

Now, when Xia ruofei, a Chinese player, was facing piker, the live broadcast room was still very lively even though it was already past two in the morning. Everyone wanted Xia ruofei to teach piker a lesson!

Pique also knew that he was the team’s last line of defense. He looked at Xia ruofei, who was dribbling the ball and quickly approaching the penalty area. He gritted his teeth and went up to tease him. He knew that Xia ruofei’s feet were hard and extremely accurate. If he did not rush up in time and let Xia ruofei have the chance to shoot calmly, the team was likely to be behind by two goals in just ten minutes. That would be terrible.

Therefore, pique had no other choice but to face it head – on.

The distance between Xia ruofei and pique was rapidly shrinking. Pique stared at the ball under Xia ruofei’s feet and did not rush to make a move. He did not want to take the risk to intercept the ball. In fact, he only needed to block the angle of Xia ruofei’s shot and delay Xia ruofei for a moment. Then, the Barcelona players who were chasing back would be able to return to their positions, and the opportunity for a quick attack would disappear.

Xia ruofei’s feet swept over the football and he did three bicycle – riding actions in a row. However, pique did not kick at all. At this time, the football’s rolling speed had slowed down.

Xia ruofei kicked forward again, and pique took a step back, maintaining the best defensive distance.

At this time, Xia ruofei’s right foot kicked the football to the right, as if he was going to break through from the right side. Pique immediately moved two steps sideways, still not thinking of intercepting the ball. He still focused on blocking the angle.

However, it was these two steps that exposed his weakness.

After Xia ruofei’s right leg kicked the ball, he immediately landed on the ground and used it as a support. His left leg knocked back and used a very gaudy flower – arranged move to knock the football to the left.

If Xia ruofei had used the action of a bicycle, then piker would have been able to predict it in advance. However, Xia ruofei had chosen the flower – arranged feet this time, and the trajectory of the football was exactly the opposite.

The ball was knocked to the left by Xia ruofei. Piker did not expect Xia ruofei to do this, so when the ball passed by him, he did not react at all.

Xia ruofei stomped on the ground and his body shot out like an arrow from a bow. He ran past piker’s right side and caught up with the ball in two steps.

Xia ruofei dribbled the ball into the penalty area. At this time, Barcelona’s goalkeeper, telstergen, immediately abandoned the goal and went out, hoping to expand the defensive area by closing the distance.

At this moment, Xia ruofei had a chance to fight alone.

Facing the attacking telstergen, Xia ruofei did not use any fancy moves to pass him. Instead, he directly dodged to the side.

Telstergen quickly got off the ground and chased after the football, hoping to destroy the Spanish team’s attack. However, he was still a little clumsy. Even though he had tried his best, the football only touched his fingertips. Other than making a little bounce, it did not change direction.

By the time Xia ruofei had stopped the ball, the opportunity had already reached the end line and the angle of the shot was already very small.

And another bar?a defender, Alba, finally arrived.

Telstergen had already been shaken off, and Xia ruofei was now facing an opening.

With such a small angle, Xia ruofei simply dribbled the ball two steps into the penalty area.

Alba was more than happy to do so, so he immediately shoveled over.

Xia ruofei pulled the ball and did a beautiful mark spin. Alba slid directly into the goal.

Because of the Marseille turn, Xia ruofei’s angle of shot was a little wider.

At this time, telstergen had already pounced over again, but it was too late. Xia ruofei gently pushed with the arch of his foot and the football slowly rolled into the goal ...
