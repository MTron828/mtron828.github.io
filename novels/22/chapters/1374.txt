“I still have two more classmates to introduce!” Xia ruofei added.

Xia ruofei had just finished speaking when the short – haired girl on he he’s right laughed and said,””I’ll do it myself! Brother Xia! I’m Chen Xi! He was from Guangdong! She was Qiao’ er’s dormmate and best friend! Brother Xia, please take care of me in the future!”

Chen Xi looked like a lively girl. She didn’t mind strangers at all. She called “brother Xia” very sweetly, and with a slight accent in Mandarin, it sounded very comfortable.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”sure!” Please also take care of Qiao’ er. This girl can be careless at times, and she’s easily forgetful ...”

“I didn ‘t!” Lin Qiao mumbled for a while and then said,”brother ruofei, there’s still one more! This was Cheng Juan! She was from xiangnan province! The four of us are in the same dormitory!”

Cheng Juan looked gentle and quiet. She was not as shrewish as sister Xiang and blushed easily. When Xia ruofei’s gentle gaze swept over her, her face instantly blushed. She smiled shyly at Xia ruofei as a form of greeting.

“Brother Xia!” Chen Ying said. It’s not easy for you to come to Heron Island, shouldn’t you treat us to a big meal?”

“Hanxi!” He he quickly pulled on Chen Xi’s sleeve, using her eyes to stop her from continuing.

Xia ruofei did not mind and said,””No problem! You’re all Qiao’ er’s good classmates and friends. I’ll treat you to lunch!”

“Yay! He could finally improve his life! I’ve had enough of the food in the school canteen!” Chen Xi called out happily.

He he shook her head helplessly, then turned her gaze to Xia ruofei and said,””Mr ... Mr. Xia, let’s forget it! You and your sister are reunited, so we won’t cause any trouble ...”

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”how can you call having a meal together causing trouble?” Besides, I’m not alone. I have a few friends with me! We’re all young people, there’s no need to be so formal, right?”

“This ...”

“It’s decided then!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”let’s ... Have lunch at Gulangyu! We can also enjoy the beautiful scenery of Heron Island!”

Originally, Xia ruofei was planning to bring Zhao Yongjun and the others to eat some Heron island’s specialty snacks before going to Gulangyu. However, he couldn’t treat Lin Qiao’s classmates to a meal so casually. Besides, they studied here and must have tasted the heron island’s specialty snacks. If he was treating them, he had to be a little more high – Class.

The food and accommodation at Gulangyu were all arranged by Liu Zhe, so the reception at the state – owned assets Supervision and Administration Committee would definitely be good.

Lin Qiao also smiled and persuaded her sisters. After she and Chen Xi’s urging, he he and Cheng Juan finally agreed.

Hence, Xia ruofei opened the car door and told Zhao Yongjun and song Rui to call Liu Zhe and ask him to arrange for lunch.

Considering that there were already four people on Lin Qiao’s side, Zhao Yongjun and the other two got off the car and squeezed with Hou Liang and the others in the back of the van. The dock wasn’t far from here anyway.

When Zhao Yongjun and Xia ruofei got off the car, Xia ruofei smiled at Lin Qiao and said,””Qiao’ er, let me introduce you. You know song Rui. This is Zhao Yongjun, big brother Zhao. You can call him big brother Zhao!”

“Brother Zhao, brother song, how are you?” Lin Qiao said generously.

“Hello!” Zhao Yongjun said with a smile. I’ve heard about you from ruofei. Your brother is an amazing person! As a former soldier, I must express my respect!”

“Thank you, brother Zhao ...” Lin Qiao said with red eyes.

“There are some friends in the car over there. I will introduce them to you at the dock!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”let’s go!”

Chen Xi and the others were very new to the mighty and domineering Knight XV off – Road vehicle. The three girls sat in the second and third rows respectively, and Lin Qiao naturally occupied the co – Driver seat.

For a moment, four young and beautiful female university students got into the luxury SUV together. This scene also attracted a lot of attention, especially many male students who pretended to look over unintentionally, unable to hide the envy in their eyes.

Xia ruofei put on the Aurora glasses on the dashboard. With the classic pilot glasses on, he looked even more unruly. The gentleness that was originally brought about by his pale skin was immediately neutralized.

Lin Qiao, who was sitting beside Xia ruofei, couldn’t help but secretly look at Xia ruofei’s side profile. Her heart was beating wildly.

After the two cars started, they drove out of the campus of Heron Island University and then along the island Road to the ferry pier.

Gulangyu was very close to Heron island’s city center. One could see the situation on the opposite Island from the dock, especially the huge statue of Zheng Chenggong, which was very clear.

Xia ruofei and the others found a place to Park their cars and then headed towards the pier together.

Xia ruofei also introduced Hou Liang and the others to Lin Qiao.

Zhao Yongjun had briefly explained Lin Qiao’s situation to everyone on the way here. Since Lin Qiao was Xia ruofei’s sister, everyone was naturally very friendly to her and even her roommates.

When Xia ruofei and the rest reached the ticket office, a young man in a black jacket hurried over and asked politely,””Are you Mr. Xia? I’m Mr. Liu Zhe’s friend! Heron island’s state – owned Resources Commission. ”

This young man was arranged by Liu Zhe to receive Xia ruofei and the others. When song Rui called Liu Zhe just now, he immediately called the people at Egret Island. As Xia ruofei and the others were supposed to go to Gulangyu in the afternoon, the state – owned assets Supervision and Administration had already left someone there to receive them. After receiving the call, they immediately took the fastest ferry back to the dock.

Liu Zhe had already told the reception staff on Egret Island about Xia ruofei and the four girls. He had even sent Xia ruofei’s photo over. Thus, when the Group of Seven men and four women walked over, their target was very obvious.

The young man even secretly checked the photos before he quickly walked over.

“I’m Xia ruofei!” Xia ruofei smiled gently and asked,”what’s your name, Sir?”

“My surname is Zhang, you can just call me little Zhang!” The young man quickly said.

“Director Zhang, you’ve worked hard ...” Xia ruofei said.

“I’m flattered, Mr. Xia. I’m just an errand boy. Please don’t kill me ...”Xiao Zhang quickly said. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Xia ruofei and Zhao Yongjun looked at each other and laughed,””Then I’ll call you little Zhang! You don’t have to call me Mr. Xia. Those who are younger than me call me brother Xia!”

“Good, good, good! Brother Xia!” Xiao Zhang immediately changed his words.

He was originally in charge of reception, so he was naturally smooth in dealing with people.

Xiao Zhang continued,”brother Xia, I’ve already booked two speedboats. Let’s not take the ferry. Let’s take a speedboat there directly. We can also take a few laps around the island to see the scenery before we go over for dinner. How about it?”

It was mainly because Xia ruofei and the rest had decided to go to Gulangyu for lunch at the last minute. The hotel would need some time to prepare. Besides, the experience of taking a speedboat was naturally much better than riding on a steady turn. When the time came, they would let the speedboat make a few more rounds and they would have more time.

Xia ruofei readily agreed,”I have no problem with that!” I’ll listen to your arrangements when I’m here!”

“That’s good!” Xiao Zhang heaved a sigh of relief and said,”this way please!”

Chen Xi and the other girls had been studying at Egret Island for half a year, so they had come to Gulangyu more than once, but they had always taken the cheap ferry back and forth. They didn’t spend money on wallets or speedboats, so they were both excited and fresh.

The group followed Xiao Zhang to the pier. There were many speedboats parked beside the big ferry, and each of them could seat six to seven people. Two of the speedboats had a bridge, waiting for Xia ruofei and the rest to board.

Xia ruofei made a simple arrangement. Lin Qiao and the other three were in the same boat as him. He also asked song Rui to come over so that there were six people in the boat. Xiao Zhang was assigned to Zhao Yongjun’s side, so there were also six people.

After everyone boarded the boat and fastened their seat belts, the driver immediately started the engine. The speedboat quickly parted the water surface and sped forward at high speed, causing a large splash on both sides ...
