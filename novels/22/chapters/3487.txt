Chapter 3488: Meeting again (2)

Translator: 549690339

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue’s faces turned red. Song Wei couldn’t help but say,”Do you want to die? You’re so rude …”

Ling Qingxue chuckled and hugged Song Wei.””We’re in love! And I’m going to show off in front of you and anger you to death …”

Song Wei struggled away shyly and said,”Qingxue, don’t mess around …”

In fact, although it was rare for three people to sleep together, it had happened before. However, Song Wei was more or less unable to let it go. In comparison, Ling Qingxue was much more generous and joked along with Xia ruofei without any pressure.

Ling Qingxue let Song Wei go this time. She pushed Song Wei towards Xia ruofei and said,””Go, go! You haven’t seen each other for more than two months. Just now, although you were looking at me, your mind was on that guy! Don’t think 1 can’t tell…”

“Where?” Song Wei said with a red face.

Xia ruofei laughed and held Song Wei’s hand,””Let’s go! Let’s talk in the cabin! The wind is strong here!”

The three of them walked into the cabin of the black Phoenix flying ship. Xia ruofei then controlled the Flying Ship to rise up quickly. After reaching an altitude of one to two thousand meters, he allowed the black Phoenix flying ship to suspend in the air.

In reality, even though it was floating, the black Phoenix flying ship was still consuming energy at every moment. However, Xia ruofei was rich now and did not care about this little consumption.

Song Wei looked at Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue and asked,”Did everything go well on your trip to the moon?”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”it’s going well overall!” We didn’t encounter any particularly dangerous situations, and although the return trip took a long time, it was generally calm and peaceful.”

Ling Qingxue said,”Weiwei, it’s a good thing you didn’t go with us. There were still some risks.” Elder Shen tianfang of the first heaven school and elder mu Hua of the surging waves school had both perished in the mystic realm on the moon. When we went there, there were nine of us, but when we returned, there were only seven of us left!”

Song Wei was shocked and said, “There’s a risk to your life when exploring that secret realm? The two elders are both at the Golden core stage! Even an Aurous core stage cultivator has fallen, this secret realm …”

From Song Wei’s point of view, an Aurous core stage cultivator was already an incredible existence. Even if they could not fly, they could at least ride a flying sword! This was completely beyond the laws of nature of ordinary humans. In the eyes of ordinary people in the secular world, some of the Aurous core stage cultivators “magical powers were the means of gods! Such an expert had actually fallen in the secret plane. That was simply too terrifying … Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Even though she had seen Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue and knew that they were both safe, Song Wei still felt a wave of fear.

Xia ruofei glared at Ling Qingxue, then said gently,””Wei Wei, don’t listen to Qingxue. There are definitely risks in exploring the secret realm, but it’s not as dangerous as you think. The two elders must have met with an unexpected situation, or they were particularly unlucky to have died. In fact, all the Qi condensation cultivators who went this time came back alive. On the other hand, two Aurous core cultivators died, so it doesn’t have much to do with cultivation.”

Song Wei nodded and said,”if I had known that it would be life – threatening, 1 would never have agreed to let you go up!” We’d rather not have any fortuitous encounters, just be safe.”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”That’s true. However, wealth comes from danger. The path of cultivation is full of thorns and bumps. It’s hard for a cultivator to achieve great things without experiencing life and death.”

“Yeah!” Ling Qingxue also agreed. Although this trip was a little dangerous, the rewards were also very generous! Wei Wei, we brought back a few good things for you!”

With that, Ling Qingxue took out a storage ring from her pocket. Inside the ring was the reward from the eighth level of the trial Pagoda, a total of 800 yellow jade essences.

She then took out the Vermillion Jade Fruit.

The yellow jade essence and the Vermillion Jade Fruit had always been Under Ling Qingxue’s care. One could increase one’s cultivation level, while the other could increase one’s spiritual power. Both of them were the kind that could be seen immediately.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”Qingxue, you’re too anxious!” 1 think we should go to the Peach Blossom Island first! Wei Wei will be able to cultivate in peace over there, and I’ll be able to focus on protecting her! After all, this place isn’t completely safe…”

In the sky, Xia ruofei had to divert some attention to control the black Phoenix flying ship. Especially in such a suspended state, there might be cultivators passing by. Even if Xia ruofei’s current strength was not much of a match in the cultivation world on earth, he was not absolutely safe.

However, it was different on the Peach Blossom Island. With the protection of the Taixu xuanqing formation, even a nascent Soul Stage cultivator would not be able to break into the island for a while.

“Then what are we waiting for?” Ling Qingxue asked. Let’s hurry up and set off!”

“I just wanted to talk to Weiwei…” Xia ruofei said with a bitter smile.

“No delay! Let’s get the flying boat moving first, the journey to Peach Blossom Island is not short!” Ling Qingxue said. Then, she put her arm around Song Wei’s shoulder and pulled her to the side to sit down. “Weiwei, let me tell you, this thing is called the Vermillion Jade Fruit. It’s really magical…”

Ling Qingxue started to introduce the yellow jade essence and the Vermillion Jade Fruit to Song Wei. Xia ruofei started the flying boat again and turned it around to fly towards the sea.

Peach Blossom Island was located in the depths of the ocean.

Although the black Phoenix flying ship was extremely fast, it still took more than two hours to fly from China to Peach Blossom Island.

Of course, this speed was already unbelievable. If he took a normal commercial plane, even a private one, it would take more than ten hours. In the past, when Xia ruofei took the peach blossom public jet to Peach Blossom Island, he had to land in Australia to refuel, which took even more time.

Now that he had the black Phoenix flying ship, he would be able to reach any location in the world within two to three hours.

After Xia ruofei had confirmed the direction to Peach Blossom Island, he had the black Phoenix flying ship fly at a high speed in a straight line towards Peach Blossom Island. This was also one of the reasons why the black Phoenix flying ship saved time. Commercial planes had to follow a certain route, but the black Phoenix flying ship could fly in a straight line, which saved a lot of time.

Furthermore, the black Phoenix flying ship was equipped with detection formations on all four sides. If there was a small chance that there were other flying vessels on the same level, the Flying Ship would be able to give a timely warning and even automatically fly up and down to avoid them.

Therefore, as long as the direction and speed were set, it could basically be like an aircraft’s autopilot without too much interference from the operator.

Xia ruofei only needed to use a bit of his spiritual energy to look after the flying boat.

While Xia ruofei was adjusting the altitude, speed, and direction, Ling Qingxue was already eagerly telling Song Wei everything that happened on the moon.

Of course, Xia ruofei had already told Ling Qingxue in advance that he would not tell Song Wei about the two of them clearing the stage together. It was not that he did not trust Song Wei. However, this matter was not important to the big picture. It was better to avoid unnecessary trouble. If one more person knew about it, even if Song Wei could not betray Xia ruofei, he could not rule out the possibility that she would let it slip!

Even so, this trip to the mystic realm could be considered to be full of ups and downs.

This included everyone wearing spacesuits in space and being exposed to the outer space environment. Then, they had to fix the spaceship and take the spaceship for a long space journey. To Song Wei, this was a very novel experience.

In the Tower of Trials, the exquisitely designed stages made Song Wei’s eyes light up.

“Qingxue, how did you manage to pass such a trial? He’s too powerful!” Song Wei did not hide her admiration at alL’Tf I were to encounter the star Fern thorn that you mentioned, I would definitely not be able to pass it!”

Ling Qingxue’s face heated up. She had really forgotten about this. Most of the later stages were passed with Xia ruofei’s help. If she had to do it herself, she might not have been able to pass it.

Of course, if she was alone, the difficulty of the trial for Qi condensation cultivators would be much lower, but it was not entirely impossible for her to pass..
