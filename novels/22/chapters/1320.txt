Chapter 1321: Both parties are satisfied (1)

Translator: 549690339

After Tang weiran finished speaking, she couldn’t help but secretly observe Xia ruofei’s expression.

He was a senior executive of a large state – owned enterprise, but he felt uneasy in front of a young man like Xia ruofei. Wei Jianming’s words had a great impact on him.

In addition, Xia ruofei always had a calm temperament. This temperament could not be faked, and it could not be cultivated by money. Tang weiran was familiar with this temperament. He was lucky enough to attend a high – Level dinner party in the past, and at the dinner party, a second generation child with a very powerful father gave him the same feeling.

To Tang weiran’s relief, Xia ruofei finally showed a faint smile after hearing his words.

“President Tang, it seems that the leadership of your Tongren Tang Group is quite competent,” said Xia ruofei.”Especially the courage to cut the knife into the inside. It’s admirable!” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“You’re too kind, President Xia. ” Tang weiran said humbly,”I apologize to your company again on behalf of the group!”

“President Tang, let’s talk about our cooperation!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Then, Xia ruofei said to Liu Qian, who was taking notes,””Liu Qian, there’s a bag of aweto samples in the first right drawer of my desk. Go get it for President Tang and researcher Zheng to identify.”

“Yes, Chairman!” Liu Qian immediately put down her pen and stood up.

Tang weiran quickly said,”President Xia, didn’t comrade Zhongming already do a full test?” I don’t think it’s necessary. ”

Xia ruofei glanced at Zheng Xu, the researcher that Tang weiran had brought with her, and said,””Brother Lin has appraised it, but it’s better to take a look at President Tang’s side again!”

Tang weiran didn’t bring a senior Chinese medicine researcher here just for show, right? This was a sales contract worth hundreds of millions of Yuan. Even if Tang weiran came with the mission to repair their relationship, it was impossible for her to sign it without even looking at it.

If there were any problems in the middle, the lightest punishment would be losing one’s position, and the heaviest punishment might even be imprisonment for a few years. Causing the loss of state – owned assets was not a light crime.

Therefore, Xia ruofei didn’t take Tang weiran’s polite words to heart.

Tang Wei Ran awkwardly smiled and said,””Then ... Let’s also take a look at the products of the Paradise company!”

Xia ruofei nodded and motioned for Liu Qian to get the bag of Cordyceps that he had left in the office as a sample.

Soon, Liu Qian brought it over. It was a small sealed bag with about three or four hundred Cordyceps.

Through the transparent sealed bag, Zheng Xu could vaguely see the Cordyceps inside, and his eyes couldn’t help but light up. These Cordyceps were too big.

The strength of Tongren Hall’s Chinese Medicine Research Institute was still very strong. Some of the precious Chinese medicine that was difficult to buy on the market could be obtained in their Research Institute. After all, they were only doing research and didn’t use much.

As a senior researcher, Zheng Xu had come into contact with many precious Chinese herbs. He had naturally seen many top quality wormgrass, but it was rare to see one as big as this.

Such aweto, not to mention selling in bulk, even if a few occasionally appeared, it would be regarded as a treasure.

Zheng Xu opened the sealed bag and began the appraisal with such excitement.

Tang weiran wasn’t very good at this. He didn’t put on a show like Chen shun and didn’t participate in the appraisal at all.

It was a necessary skill for a leader to leave professional things to professionals.

Xia ruofei sat on the chair calmly. Zheng Xu’s shocked expression was within his expectations. To be honest, this batch of aweto had been appraised by Dr. Huang, who was brought by Lin Zhongming, the purchasing Specialist by Chen shun, and Zheng Xu, the researcher by Tang weiran. Xia ruofei was almost tired of seeing such a shocked expression.

Tang weiran was very concerned. Although he didn’t look at the aweto, he saw Zheng Xu’s expression.

When Zheng Xu reluctantly put down the wormgrass in his hand, Tang weiran immediately asked,””Elder Zheng, how is it?”

“President Tang, it’s definitely the pure Cordyceps!” Zheng Xu exclaimed excitedly. Moreover, the quality of the Peter grade is much higher. It’s simply a top quality item that can only be encountered by luck!”

Tang Wei Ran heaved a sigh of relief. It was fine as long as there was no problem.

And now, not only was there no problem, but it had far exceeded his expectations.

In fact, Wei Jianming had also said that as long as the quality of this batch of wormgrass was above the standard, they could buy it at a premium. Now it seemed that their quality was not only above the standard, but also beyond the standard. This was simply a pleasant surprise!

Zheng Xu, on the other hand, asked with a strange expression,””President Lin, how did you guys negotiate? Why aren’t we taking down these wormgrass? are the people Chen shun brought blind?”

Zheng Xu was a typical technical talent. He was even a bit of a bookworm, and he spoke without any scruples.

“Researcher Zheng, I’m offering 750000 Yuan per kilogram for this batch of Cordyceps ...” Lin Zhongming said with a bitter smile.

“Yes!” Zheng Xu immediately nodded and said,”in terms of the quality of the wormgrass, this price is quite reasonable!”

“Who said I wasn ‘t?” Lin Zhongming smiled bitterly. “We’ve already agreed on the conditions and only needed to sign the contract. Because our East China District doesn’t have enough authority, I reported to the leader of the chain company as usual to apply for authority. I didn’t expect the chain company to immediately send a purchasing manager over ...”
