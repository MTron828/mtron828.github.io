2879 A super – grade golden core (1)

After hearing Xia ruofei’s words, immortal mountain river raised his eyebrows and said,””Earth? This name is quite fitting ... So you already know that the place we live in is actually a very large sphere?”

Xia ruofei was speechless. This was common sense, okay? Even a three – year – old would know, right?

However, on second thought, he realized that Daoist master mountain river had lived at least hundreds or thousands of years ago. Even if Daoist master mountain river had accepted Li Yifu’s Grandmaster, li beihuai, as an in – Name disciple, it had been more than 300 years ago. It should be during the Kangxi period of the Qing Dynasty. After that, Daoist master mountain river disappeared. He had probably left earth at that time.

The real proof that the earth was round was Magellan’s global voyage in the 16th century. This scientific theory was brought to China by missionaries at the end of the Ming Dynasty, but it was only widely accepted by the Chinese at the beginning of the 20th century. In addition, cultivators probably didn’t care much about the scientific theories of the secular world. Therefore, immortal Shanhe might not know that as early as the 16th century, someone had already confirmed that the earth was round.

Hence, Xia ruofei nodded.”Yes. In fact, more than 500 years ago, there were people who sailed in one direction and eventually returned to the starting point. This proved that the earth is round.”

“Oh, really? I didn’t think that the ordinary people of the secular world would have such a way. ” Daoist master mountain river said with a smile and then asked,”Oh right, what era is it now?”

“Senior Shanhe, it’s 2019 A.D. This year ...” Xia ruofei said.

Immortal mountain river calculated silently and said with emotion,””So it’s been over 300 years ...”

Xia ruofei saw that immortal mountain river was sighing, so he did not disturb him and just stood aside silently.

Immortal Shanhe quickly adjusted his emotions and smiled at Xia ruofei.””You just asked ... Whether I left ... Earth? Actually, I don’t know either ...”

Xia ruofei looked at immortal mountain river in confusion.

“I don’t even know if I’m still alive ...” Immortal mountain river said with a smile.

He laughed and looked at Xia ruofei.””Is this hard to understand? You’ll understand when your cultivation base is high enough to separate a thought. ”

“Senior, please advise me.” Xia ruofei said respectfully. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Immortal mountain river nodded and said,””I’ve already said that I’m just a thought left behind by immortal mountain river. When he left this thought behind, he was indeed preparing to leave the earth you speak of. Before he left, he left behind this mountain and river Spirit map and sealed my thought here. As for what happened after that, I naturally have no way of knowing. ”

Xia ruofei suddenly realized that the thought that immortal mountain river had left behind also carried his previous memories. However, the thought itself would not know what would happen after it separated from the thought.

Xia ruofei was just caught in a thought process. He instinctively thought that the shadow in front of him was immortal mountain river. In fact, strictly speaking, this was not the actual immortal mountain river.

“I understand. Thank you for your explanation, senior!” Xia ruofei said respectfully,”I would like to ask you why senior Shan He left earth more than 300 years ago. Moreover, according to my observation, the spiritual energy on earth is very heterogeneous and not suitable for cultivation at all. If it weren’t for this space treasure left behind by senior, I wouldn’t have been able to cultivate to the Golden core stage in such a short time. I also know that the cultivators on earth are generally not very good. What about those high – Level cultivators? Did they all leave earth?”

With a smile, immortal mountain river said,””You’re right. More than 300 years ago, most of the cultivators above the nascent Soul Stage left the divine continent in batches, which is what you call earth. As for the reason ... The most direct one is what you said just now, the cultivation environment of the divine continent has suddenly deteriorated. Of course, the experts “departure wasn’t simply to avoid disaster, so I can only explain it to you in simple terms. As for the deeper reasons, with your current cultivation, knowing them will only bring you harm.”

Xia ruofei was a little speechless. He didn’t expect that a senior expert like Daoist master mountain river would play this trick.

It was as if immortal mountain river had seen through Xia ruofei’s thoughts. He laughed and said,””Little friend, it’s not that I’m deliberately tantalizing you, but knowing too much won’t do you any good! I can only tell you that the deterioration of the cultivation environment in the divine continent is not a natural development, nor is it caused by the cultivators on the continent. If you want to understand all of this, you must first possess the basic strength to interfere in this matter. ”

“Then may I ask senior, what cultivation level do I need to reach?” Xia ruofei asked.

“At least the nascent Soul Stage, or more accurately, the advanced stage. And I must practice the ‘great Dao Arts’ to reach the advanced stage.” Daoist master mountain river said seriously,”I can also tell you that the deterioration of the cultivation environment has not stopped. I estimate that more than 300 years have passed, and the cultivation environment on the divine continent is probably even worse now. This deterioration will continue, and the speed will get faster as time goes on. By then, it will not only affect cultivators, but even the living environment of ordinary people will be affected ...”

Xia ruofei suddenly felt a sense of danger. He knew that immortal mountain river would not lie to him, and there was no need for him to lie to him.
