2066 Meeting (2)

In fact, it was quite uncomfortable to lie in bed for an entire day. However, Rousey saw the real hope of standing up and did not take this little inconvenience to heart at all. Even if he were to lie down without moving, he would gladly endure it.

This was because he could feel the slight coolness coming from his legs. The feeling in his legs was becoming more and more obvious, like a withered tree coming back to spring. This allowed his already despairing heart to gradually have a chance of survival.

After lunch, Xia ruofei smiled at Monica and said,””Monica, I’m planning to go out in the afternoon. It’s not easy to come to Italy, so I have to take a look at Turin’s beautiful scenery. Otherwise, it’ll be a pity.”

Monica said without thinking,”okay!” I’ll go with you!”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”don’t go out. You’ve been with me for the past two days. You’ve just taken over the position of the family head. There must be a lot of things waiting for you!” We’ve already delayed quite a lot of things these past two days ...”

“It’s okay, I can work overtime at night to deal with it!” Monica said,”you’re in Turin. Of course, I have to be a good guide for you!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”girls shouldn’t stay up late. Besides ... You have a more important task at night!” How Can you work overtime?”

Monica couldn’t help but giggle.””It’s okay. I can work overtime after I finish the ‘important task’!”

“Come on, you!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”who was the one who turned into a pile of mud last night?”

Monica’s face heated up and she couldn’t help but glance at Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”alright, you can settle your work in the afternoon. You can take care of Rousey when he’s at home. I’ll get ah Yong and Ah Hua to accompany me. We’re all Chinese, so we have a common language.”

Monica pondered for a moment, then smiled and nodded.””That’s good too!”

“Alright! Just arrange a car for us!” Xia ruofei said,”by the way, if Rousey feels any discomfort, you must contact me immediately.”

“Alright!” Monica said.

Ten minutes later, a Mercedes – Benz arranged by Monica slowly drove out of the manor.

Xia ruofei sat in the back seat. Ah Yong was driving while Ah Hua, who was more talkative, sat in the passenger seat.

After the car left the manor, Hua turned around and asked respectfully,””Mr. Xia, where do you want to go first?”

Xia ruofei said indifferently,”we’ll go to your place first!” Isn’t your boss here? I’m going to meet him. ”

“Understood!” Hua said quickly.

The car soon entered the city and arrived at the building where the Hong sect’s branch was located.

On the way there, Hua had already texted lui hai, so he was already waiting in the yard with Lu zhengfeng and some backbone members of the branch in Turin.

Before the car stopped, lui hai walked up quickly and opened the back door for Xia ruofei.

“Mr. Xia, Hello!” Lui hai said with enthusiasm,”welcome to Turin!”

Xia ruofei had a gentle smile on his face as he asked,””You must be ah hai?”

Last night, Xia ruofei had talked to Li Yifu on the phone. He knew that Li Yifu just told the Italy Freemasons to respect him, but he didn’t tell Lu hai that Xia ruofei and Xia Tian were the same person.

Lui hai was slightly stunned, and then asked,””Mr. Xia, you know me?”

“Xia Tian told me everything.” Xia ruofei said indifferently,”thank you for the troubles of the Grao family. I thank you on behalf of Monica!”

Since Li Yifu did not point it out and even said that “Xia Tian could only be considered Mr. Xia ruofei’s subordinate”, Xia ruofei decided to carry out this persona to the end. It would make more sense.

Sure enough, after hearing Xia ruofei’s words, lui hai immediately started to imagine why Mr. Xia had spared no effort for the sake of the Grao family. Although he cared about Monica very much, he had never shown any intimate relationship with her. It turned out that everything he had done was instructed by Mr. Xia! In fact, Monica was Mr. Xia’s woman!

Everything could be explained in this way. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Lui hai broke out in a cold sweat when he analyzed the situation. He even reported this to Li Yifu and called him “pretty boy”. If Mr. Xia knew this ...

However, seeing Xia ruofei’s friendly attitude, he knew that Li Yifu had not told Xia ruofei about it, so he felt a little more at ease.

Lui hai calmed down and said,”you’re welcome!” In fact, the Hong sect stands to gain more from this. ”

“Let’s benefit and win!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Then, he turned his eyes to Lu zhengfeng and said with a gentle smile,””This must be the person in charge of the Turin branch, Lu zhengfeng!”

“Hello, Mr. Xia!” Lu zhengfeng also quickly came forward to greet him.

“You’ve worked hard!” Xia ruofei nodded.

After some small talk, lui hai and lui zhengfeng welcomed Xia ruofei in.

They arrived at the small meeting room that Xia ruofei was familiar with. Everyone took their seats. Xia ruofei said,””Ah hai, zhengfeng, I hope that our relationship, including my relationship with Xia Tian, will be kept to ourselves. I don’t want Monica to know about this, do you understand?”

“Don’t worry, we’ll definitely keep our lips sealed!” Lui hai said,”I’ve reminded ah Yong and Ah Hua. They won’t let it slip!”

Lui hai didn’t feel strange. He understood that Xia ruofei didn’t want Monica to know what he had done for her. It meant that Xia ruofei had deep feelings for Monica and didn’t want her to feel too much pressure.

“How’s the situation in Turin?”Xia ruofei asked.

Lui hai said with a smile,”I’ll go back to Milan after this. Let zhengfeng report the situation.” He has a more comprehensive grasp of it. ”

After saying that, lui hai gestured to LV zhengfeng, who immediately said,””Okay, Mr. Xia. The Gehrman family was uprooted overnight, and the other forces in Turin were also shocked. Although the nihilians also took the opportunity to seize some territory, most of it is under our control. The most powerful force in Turin is undoubtedly the Hong sect!”

Lu zhengfeng was very excited. He took a sip of water and continued,”In the beginning, the police’s actions were quite big. It was mainly because we had too many flowers that night, and half of the city was in chaos, so the police were more nervous. Although the underworld knows that we were the ones who did it that night, the police didn’t have any evidence to directly accuse us, so they only increased the intensity of their patrols and dealt with some cases of street fighting and group trouble more seriously. We’ve already restrained our men in advance, so basically, we weren’t affected. ”

Xia ruofei nodded.”It’s good that you’re fine. I was worried that the police in Turin would take special care of you!”

“We’re the biggest force in Turin, and we’re Chinese. It’s normal that we’re being watched,” anfey said. Lu zhengfeng said indifferently,”it doesn’t affect us much.”

“I’m relieved to hear that,” Xia ruofei said.”Since you’ve taken over the territory and assets of the Gelman family, I have to give you a few words of advice.”

“Please!” Lui hai said respectfully.

“It turns out that you should never get involved in the heartless business of the Italy Mafia!” Xia ruofei said sternly,”drugs, firearms, and even the prostitution business may make money quickly, but it’s beyond our principles. We don’t care what other forces do, but not the Hong sect!”

Li Yifu was one of the leaders of the Hong sect. As Li Yifu’s senior uncle and Xia ruofei had helped the Hong sect to conquer Turin, he felt that it was necessary to remind them.

Lui hai hurriedly said,”Mr. Xia, don’t worry. Hong sect has strict rules. We won’t touch any of the businesses you mentioned!” You can investigate as you wish, but if you find out that our Italy Freemasonry brothers have touched those businesses, you don’t have to deal with them according to the sect rules. Just say the word and I’ll chop them up myself!”

Lui hai said with killing intent. Xia ruofei smiled,””That’s good. I’m just giving everyone a heads up. Even if he was making a living in the underworld, he had to have his own principles and bottom line. By the way, what was the reaction of the glory society?”
