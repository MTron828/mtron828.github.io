“Mr. MA, how are you?” Xia ruofei greeted him with a smile.

This auction had brought the Paradise Corporation great fame. Xia ruofei was very grateful to MA Xiong and his son. Hence, he was very enthusiastic when he received Ma Zhiming’s call.

However, just like Ma Zhiming, he had also forgotten what had happened that day.

After the huge success of the auction, Xia ruofei accompanied Huan Huan during the day and went to the hotel at night to pay attention to the follow – up reactions of the auction. He had really forgotten about Ma Zhiming.

The main reason was that Ma Zhiming’s problem wasn’t complicated in his eyes. There was a prescription for it in the large number of medical books stored in his mind, which was the essence gathering pill.

Xia ruofei had given the task of making the gathering elemental pills to Xia Qing. Therefore, after the impact of the auction, he had no impression of it.

“Nice to meet you, Xia Sheng!” Ma Zhiming also felt a little embarrassed. After all, it was a secret that was hard to say. He didn’t know how to say it. After thinking about it, he stammered and asked,”that ... When we were eating that day, you asked me to look for you after the auction ...”

As soon as Ma Zhiming mentioned this, Xia ruofei immediately remembered.

He couldn’t help but Pat his forehead and reveal a bitter smile.

“I was busy with the company for a few days, so ... I forgot about it ...” Ma Zhiming continued.

“Haha, that’s right ... I forgot about that too ...” Xia ruofei said awkwardly.

“Then ...” Ma Zhiming looked at Tian Huixin, who kept giving him meaningful looks at the side. He didn’t know how to start.

On the other hand, Xia ruofei did not know what to say either. After all, Ma Zhiming and Tian Huixin were his elders. He could not just ask Ma Zhiming directly if there had been any disharmony between the couple’s life recently.

The atmosphere was a little awkward ...

In the end, it was still Tian Huixin who pinched Ma Zhiming hard. Ma Zhiming then stammered and asked,”Xia Sheng, I wonder ... Why did you look for me that day?”

“Mr. MA, have you been feeling unwell lately?” Xia ruofei asked tactfully.

Ma Zhiming’s phone was on speaker mode. Tian Huixin, who was at the side, immediately nodded heavily after listening to him and kept winking at Ma Zhiming.

Although Ma Zhiming felt a little embarrassed, he still said,””Xiasheng, I won’t hide it from you. I’ve been having some problems with my body recently, mainly ... In terms of sex ...”

Xia ruofei heaved a long sigh of relief. Since the other party had taken the initiative to say it, it would be easy.

“Mr. MA,” he quickly said,”I did find something when I observed your complexion that day. It seems that my judgment was right!”

After Ma Zhiming and Tian Huixin heard this, they opened their mouths wide in unison. They were so shocked that they even forgot about the awkwardness.

That day, Xia ruofei had only glanced at him a few times, and he could actually see through such a hidden problem? His medical skills were too terrifying, right?

At first, Ma Zhiming was at his wits ‘end. He was only thinking about whether he could ask Xia ruofei to help treat him. After all, Xia ruofei’s previous display of medical skills had convinced them. Furthermore, Western medicine could not detect any problems at all. This kind of difficult and complicated illness was often more effective to use Chinese medicine to treat it.

He did not dare to imagine that Xia ruofei had already noticed the problem that day.

“Xia Sheng, do you have a way to help me?” Ma Zhiming didn’t care about the awkwardness and asked eagerly,”to be honest, I’ve already found the best urology doctor in Hong Kong, but he couldn’t find the cause ...”

Xia ruofei could hear the urgency in Ma Zhiming’s voice. He immediately consoled him,”Mr. MA, since I can find the problem, I naturally have a way to treat it.”

“Actually, I had already prepared the medicine that day ...” Xia ruofei said, a little embarrassed.”It’s just that you didn’t come to look for me after the auction and I forgot about it ...”

“Xia Sheng, I’ll fly over immediately today!” Ma Zhiming said anxiously.

“Uh ... Actually, I can mail the medicine to you.” Xia ruofei said,”there’s no need to make a special trip, right?”

At that time, Xia ruofei had half – jokingly said that he had prepared a gift for Ma Zhiming. In fact, it was to treat this unmentionable disease. Although Ma Zhiming himself had forgotten about it later on, Xia ruofei would still feel a little apologetic if he had to make him fly over just because of this. After all, he had also forgotten about this matter. Otherwise, it would not have been delayed. 1

“It’s fine, it’s fine. It’s very convenient for me to come back,”Ma Zhiming quickly said.

He didn’t want to wait any longer. Besides, he would be more at ease if Xia ruofei could help him take a look in person.

Xia ruofei had no choice but to say,”alright then ... After you land on the three mountains, come to the farm!” I’ll help you check it again since I didn’t take your pulse that day. ”

“Alright, alright!” Ma Zhiming said excitedly,”I’ll arrange the flight right away. Xiasheng, let’s talk when we meet!”

After hanging up the phone, Ma Zhiming and Tian Huixin hugged each other excitedly. The haze that had been pressing on their hearts these days had also dissipated. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

......

Ma Zhiming had already arrived at the farm at around three in the afternoon.

Calculating the time, he should have arranged for a private jet immediately after the phone call. He might have even used some of his connections when he booked the flight route. He basically came to San Shan without stopping.
