Chapter 666: Tian Huilan’s support (3)

Tian Huilan personally stood up and sent Xia ruofei to the door of the office. Then, she said,””Xiao Xia, if you have time, come over to our house. My dad always talks about you ...”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei quickly said,”please wait!”

After leaving Tian Huilan’s office, Xia ruofei bade Xiao Mei goodbye and hurried downstairs. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

After getting into the car, Xia ruofei was not in a hurry to drive away. Instead, he took out the piece of paper that Tian Huilan had given him and dialed the phone number written on it.

The phone rang for more than ten times. Just as Xia ruofei thought that the other party did not bring his phone or that it was on silent mode and was about to hang up, the other end finally picked up.

A voice with a hint of reservation was heard.””Who is it?”

“Are you director he from the Food and Drug Administration?” Xia ruofei asked politely,”I’m Xia ruofei from the peach blossom company. Secretary Tian of the municipal Party Committee asked me to call you.”

The voice on the other end of the phone suddenly became more enthusiastic.””Oh, it’s President Xia! Hello, hello! Secretary Tian has already given you specific instructions. Don’t worry, our provincial Food and Drug Administration will do our best to assist you!”

Xia ruofei was used to the officials ‘change in attitude and did not feel unhappy. He smiled and said,””Bureau chief he, I wonder if you’re free now? I wanted to visit you and give you a detailed report on the approval of the new medicine. ”

“Well ... President Xia, I have to attend a National Drug Administration conference in five minutes,” he kun said awkwardly.”It’s estimated to be a long conference, so ...”

“Oh! That’s fine, I’ll find time to come back next time!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

He kun seemed to be worried that Xia ruofei would misunderstand and think that he had neglected him on purpose. After a moment of silence, he said,””President Xia, I personally think that the first thing your company needs to do for this project is to establish a project. We can only help you if the National Food and Drug Administration officially sets up a project and sends our provincial Food and Drug Administration to conduct a preliminary review of the drug!”

“Thank you for your advice, bureau chief he.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”do you have any suggestions about the project, chief he?”

......

He kun had already made up his mind. He immediately said,””President Xia, do you think this is okay? I’m going to Beijing to attend a seminar in the pharmaceutical industry tomorrow. Why don’t you come with me to Beijing tomorrow? I have quite a few acquaintances at the State Food and Drug Administration, so I’ll personally coordinate with them. I think we should be able to speed up the project!”

This matter had been personally assigned by Tian Huilan, and it wasn’t as simple as a simple greeting. She had called him to the office and personally instructed him to do so. How could he kun dare to neglect it?

I, the Deputy Director of the provincial Bureau, personally went to Beijing to help you coordinate the project. This should be enough sincerity, right? He kun said in his heart.

In fact, the so – called pharmaceutical seminar was just an excuse. If he kun wanted to attend, there would be people fighting to invite him to such seminar every day.

His trip to Beijing this time was purely to help Xia ruofei coordinate the project.

He had to spare no effort in carrying out Secretary Tian’s instructions!
