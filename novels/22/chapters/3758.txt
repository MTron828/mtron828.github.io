Every time Xia ruofei entered a cave, he would return to the square from the exit and greet Song Wei and Ling Qingxue. Then, he would use the formation on the Jade platform to teleport to the next cave. Although his two female friends were worried about his safety, they did not have to wait for six to seven hours.

After going through all the caves that senior copper coffin had pointed out, Xia ruofei had no intention of exploring the other caves.

Xia ruofei spent six to seven hours to walk through all three caves that senior copper coffin had pointed out.

It had to be said that the locations that senior copper coffin had pointed out to Xia ruofei were all within his capabilities. Ordinary late Stage golden core cultivators might not be able to obtain all the opportunities. However, Xia ruofei was much stronger than ordinary late Stage golden core cultivators and had many more tricks up his sleeve. Thus, even though the three caves were not smooth sailing, he still managed to obtain the opportunities successfully.

He had obtained a piece of purple Gold Cloud iron, a mysterious fog grass, and an illusion gold elixir from each of the three caves.

The purple Gold Cloud iron was a top grade material for refining weapons, especially when it was used to refine flying swords. If a small amount of purple

Gold Cloud iron was added, the grade of the flying sword would increase by at least one grade. The purple Gold Cloud iron that Xia ruofei had obtained was the size of an adults fist. It was evident how precious it was.

The mysterious fog grass was a rare spiritual herb in the cultivation world. It was a necessary ingredient when refining many precious medicinal pills. What was even rarer was that this mysterious fog grass had grown directly in that cave and was not dry grass that had been processed. In the spiritual herb garden in the spirit map space, although there were countless precious spiritual herbs and spiritual herbs, there was no black mist Grass. Hence, Xia ruofei dug out the soil without hesitation and transplanted it to the spiritual herb garden in the heart Island of the mountain sea realm.

As for the illusion gold Mystic pill, it was also a very precious finished elixir that could only be consumed by nascent Soul Stage cultivators. Other than increasing cultivation, it could also stabilize the sea of consciousness and increase the power of the will. To nascent Soul Stage cultivators and even immortal soul Stage cultivators, it was an extremely precious cultivation resource. A single illusion gold Mystic pill was equivalent to two years of cultivation for an early nascent soul realm cultivator.

Of course, in Xia ruofeis opinion, the treasures in these three caves were not as precious as the primordial soul pill in the lava cave.

The foundation of a cultivators heaven defying cultivation was naturally cultivation. The primordial soul elixir could greatly increase the success rate of a nascent soul advanced stage cultivator breaking through to the primordial soul Stage. This was something that other precious materials and elixirs could not compare to.

Naturally, Xia ruofei had experienced some danger in these three caves. However, he had the spirit map space as a life saving weapon and was proficient in arrays. In addition, his mental strength was far beyond that of ordinary late Stage golden core cultivators. In addition, he also had two flying swords that could be considered of the highest quality and many arrays and talismans that could be used directly. Finally, he managed to obtain the opportunities in each cave without any danger.
