Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei had thought that the post would either be scoffed at by fans, or it would be deleted by the moderator. However, the truth was the opposite of what he had imagined.

This post had already been highlighted at the top, and there was a reply from the moderator: I’ve confirmed that this is our President Xia. Brothers and sisters, come and say hello to our overbearing President!

Xia ruofei was dumbfounded. He looked at the data of the post again. In just one afternoon and half a night, there were already more than a million visits and more than 3000 pages of replies. There were at least tens of thousands of replies.

How did this happen? Xia ruofei could not understand.

He began to search for answers in the replies.

The first few pages were similar to what he had expected. Most of the replies were disdainful. No one believed that Xia ruofei had posted it himself.

However, Xia ruofei soon found the answer in the replies.

One of the netizens with the ID “moonlight cat” occupied the sofa floor and replied almost instantly. He wrote in the post, The daily posts were here again! If it’s true, the manager will livestream him eating shit!

There were already a lot of replies below this post.

The Story Master! Does your face hurt?

Waiting for the floor master’s live broadcast!

The Story Master! Your mother is calling you to go home and eat shit! DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Hahaha! I’m from Weibo, let’s take a look at the internet celebrity floor master!

It was also from Weibo! President Xia is very naughty today! The Story Master was in a sad state ...

Xia ruofei quickly found a high – frequency keyword from the replies,”” Weibo!

He raised his eyebrows and immediately opened the Weibo APP on his phone. As expected, he saw that his latest Weibo post was posted this afternoon.

The content was – Heart – sanguinity! She had just gone to Tieba to say hello to her fans, but in the end, she had been treated as a fake ...

There were three pictures attached to the Weibo post. They were a screenshot of the background interface of the ID “real Xia ruofei” that had just registered today, a screenshot of the main post, and a photo of eating at a Western restaurant in the corner!

Needless to say, this Weibo post was definitely posted by Ling Qingxue. Xia ruofei did not even notice when this photo of them eating was posted.

No wonder Ling Qingxue’s smile was so strange. Even after the night’s cultivation, Xia ruofei always felt that her gaze was strange. So that was the problem!

Not only was the post on Tieba flooded by fans, but this Weibo post also became a hot topic very quickly. It had already been read over a million times and had more than ten thousand replies.

Xia ruofei’s down – to – Earth style was well – liked by everyone. Most of the replies expressed that they were happy to see this and then arranged to form groups to go to the Tieba to watch the fun.

Actually, Xia ruofei rarely posted on Weibo. Occasionally, he would post a few from the company’s operations team. However, this Weibo post was obviously posted by him, so it was especially closely followed by fans. The popularity that had cooled down a little suddenly rose again.

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. He had never been used to such a high – Profile style. In comparison, he preferred a plain and low – Key life. Perhaps it was an occupational habit left behind by the lone wolf assault team. He always lacked a sense of security under the spotlight. Even though he had already achieved success in his cultivation, he still subconsciously wanted to be low – Key.

However, things always turned out contrary to his wishes.

Of course, this had already become a reality. Xia ruofei naturally would not be bothered by it. Anyway, his life was very simple. Basically, he just had to go to the company and the farm. After that, he would go on a date with Ling Qingxue. As his girlfriend, Ling Qingxue had already made it public on the internet. The two of them did not need to hide their relationship, so it basically did not affect much.

Xia ruofei browsed through his own post Bar with great interest.

Soon, he saw Cheng Xiaoxiao’s post. This post was also highlighted in red because she had put a photo of the two of them in the post.

Cheng Xiaoxiao’s ID was “falling wood Xiaoxiao,” and she wrote in the thread: Wahaha! Guys, guess who I met today? Clang clang clang clang! I actually met our overbearing President! Are you guys envious? Was he envious?

There was a photo of her and Xia ruofei below the message.

In the photo, Xia ruofei had a gentle smile on his face, while Cheng Xiaoxiao’s face was filled with happiness and satisfaction. When Ling Qingxue took the photo, the composition and lighting were on point, and the corner restaurant’s environment gave off a petty feeling, so the photo looked very beautiful.

Cheng Xiaoxiao continued to write,”President Xia came to the restaurant where I work for a meal today, and he even brought” The King’s Woman “with him!” Don’t you think I’m too lucky? Let me tell you, our overbearing President is not overbearing at all. He’s actually a warm man with a gentle attitude! I asked for an autograph and a photo, but the manager found out. President Xia even pleaded for me! Oh yes, there’s also President Ling, he’s a really nice person! She was the one who helped us take the photo above!

It could be seen that Cheng Xiaoxiao was still very excited, so the post was a little incoherent.

But even so, this post was full of content.

At the end of the post, Cheng Xiaoxiao even took a photo of Xia ruofei’s signature and put it up.

Naturally, this post became a hot topic very quickly. Its popularity was only second to the post that Ling Qingxue had posted on her behalf.

Those who were active on this forum were definitely Xia ruofei’s fans, so they were extremely envious of Cheng Xiaoxiao’s luck. Many people even asked what the name of the restaurant Cheng Xiaoxiao worked at was. It seemed that many local fans were ready to “wait for an opportunity.”
