With that, Xia ruofei raised her other hand and slapped him.

Pa!

A crisp sound rang out, and this slap landed solidly on Huang Zhenyu’s face.

Xia ruofei hit him very hard. Huang Zhenyu’s head turned to the other side and he spat out a mouthful of blood along with two molars.

“This slap is for squad leader Luo! I’ll let you make venomous accusations!”

Pa!

“This is for aunt Luo!”

Pa!

“This slap is for sister – in – Law!”

Pa!

“I’m helping the villagers!”

In the blink of an eye, Xia ruofei had already slapped him four times in a row. Huang Zhenyu did not have any ability to resist at all. His head was subconsciously turned to the left and then to the right along with Xia ruofei’s slaps. He seemed to be in a daze.

In fact, if Xia ruofei had used all his strength, four slaps would have been enough to kill him. Xia ruofei had still held back.

However, even so, a slight concussion was definitely not a small matter.

Huang Zhenyu’s teeth were almost all knocked out, and his face swelled up at a speed visible to the naked eye. His originally pretty face had now become like a pig’s head.

Xia ruofei let go of his hand and Huang Zhenyu fell to the ground.

“You ... You ... Kill me if you dare!” He shouted like a madman. Otherwise, I will never let you off! You can just wait to go to jail!”

These words were originally quite imposing, but unfortunately, a few of his teeth had fallen out, his mouth was swollen, and his words were leaking air. It looked a little comical.

After the villagers saw this, they felt very relieved and applauded.

Huang Zhenyu had been very arrogant since he entered the village, and everyone already knew that it was this unscrupulous reporter who had killed aunt Luo, so they were all filled with righteous indignation. However, the simple villagers were intimidated by Huang Zhenyu’s so – called “right of interview” and the two cameras with red lights on, so they did not dare to act rashly.

In fact, they didn’t know that there was no law that stipulated the right to interview, and that the people had the right to refuse interviews.

Now that Xia ruofei had come out to teach Huang Zhenyu a lesson, the villagers suddenly felt that they had gotten their revenge.

Of course, everyone was whispering among themselves. They were all worried about Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei did not feel any pressure. He turned around and looked at the two cameramen.

The two cameramen quickly avoided his gaze. Facing this God – like man, they didn’t even have the courage to come up and help.

Moreover, Huang Zhenyu had just joined the company, and the cameramen did not have much of a relationship with him, so they naturally would not stand up for him.

Xia ruofei pouted, squatted down, and stared at Huang Zhenyu, asking,””I just want to know why you won’t let me go. How are you going to make me go to jail?”

Huang Zhenyu snorted coldly and said,”we’ve taken photos of everything. That’s the evidence!” I’ll call the police!”

“Evidence?” Xia ruofei chuckled and stood up. He walked to the two cameras that the cameramen had placed on the ground.”Are you talking about these?”

As soon as Xia ruofei finished speaking, he immediately lifted his foot and stomped on the ground. The two expensive cameras immediately broke into pieces.

Xia ruofei found two memory cards from the pile of junk and broke them in front of Huang Zhenyu.

“Not anymore!” He asked with a smile.

“You ... You ...” Huang Zhenyu trembled with anger.”How dare you damage our interview equipment!” He’s simply lawless!”

Xia ruofei shrugged and asked,”where’s the evidence?” Did you guys see that?”

Xia ruofei’s last sentence was directed at the villagers.

The villagers immediately laughed, and a few young men replied loudly,””We didn’t see anything!”

Someone else said,”I saw it!” These reporters started fighting among themselves and broke the machine!”

“Hahaha ...” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Huang Zhenyu was even more seething with anger. He said in exasperation,””Don’t think that you can distort the truth! I’m telling you, I’m a reporter from the provincial television station! Let’s see if the police will believe you or me!”

“Inverting black and white? Grandson! Isn’t that what you’re best at?” Xia ruofei sneered.”You can’t take it anymore? The more satisfying part is yet to come!”

With that, Xia ruofei walked to Huang Zhenyu’s side to look at the villagers. They were relieved, but Xia ruofei had not!

Slandering squad leader Luo, angering aunt Luo to death, pushing Lin Yue ‘e away – this unscrupulous reporter had done so many evil things that were hated by both man and God, how could a few slaps be enough?
