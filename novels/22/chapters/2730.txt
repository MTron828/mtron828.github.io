2731 The heavenly network (2)

“Senior granduncle, you’re too risky!” Li Yifu couldn’t help but say,”I was so scared just now that my heart almost jumped out of my throat!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”you’re a cultivator. How can your heart be so weak?” I won’t believe it even if you beat me to death! Alright, alright! I only boarded the helicopter because I’m confident in my ability to protect myself. I’ve learned how to operate a helicopter in the Army!”

“It was a little dangerous when I saw you landing just now!” Li Yifu muttered.

Xia ruofei pretended not to hear him. He walked towards the stairs and said,””I just observed from the sky and found a few flaws. Godfather, come with me to arrange it.”

Li Yifu only complained out of concern for Xia ruofei. Otherwise, he would not have dared to go against Xia ruofei. Now that he heard that there was a serious matter, he quickly said,”Yes! Senior granduncle!”

Xia ruofei continued,”Wang Boshan, continue to guard the phone. If there is any news from Zheng Yongshou’s side, you must report to me immediately!”

“Yes! Master!” Wang Boshan replied respectfully.

Xia ruofei and Zheng Yongshou took the elevator to the underground parking lot and left the building in an off – Road vehicle.

There were a few places that needed to be checked and filled. Xia ruofei had already memorized them, so he went straight to those places after getting in the car.

After a series of camouflaging arrangements, Xia ruofei flew the Super Jaguar for a few rounds of patrol in the air and finally felt relieved.

This time, the landing process was unusually smooth, and he succeeded in one try.

After he got off the plane, he said to Li Yifu,””There shouldn’t be any loopholes now. Let’s wait for sect leader Luo!”

Li Yifu secretly clenched his fist and nodded heavily.

He knew in his heart that success or failure depended on this one move. If they could successfully subdue Luo Qingfeng as planned, the safety of the Peach Blossom Island would no longer be a threat in the short term. However, if the Taixu xuanqing formation could not defeat Luo Qingfeng, a golden core cultivator, even if it could not trap Luo Qingfeng and let him escape, there would be endless trouble in the future, and there would be no peace.

Xia ruofei had made all the necessary preparations and was very calm. He even took the time to guide Li Yifu in his cultivation.

Although Xia ruofei had never cultivated the Guiyuan Scripture, his explanations often pointed directly to the great Dao. It could be said that the whip had penetrated deep into the wood. Often, a simple sentence or two could make Li Yifu feel enlightened.

Under Xia ruofei’s guidance, Li Yifu’s cultivation had steadily increased by a large margin. He had already touched the barrier of refined Qi Level 5.

One could imagine that once the danger of the Peach Blossom Island was resolved, the Taixu xuanqing formation would begin to operate normally, and he would soon usher in another breakthrough in his cultivation.

……

On Peach Blossom Island, Xia ruofei and Li Yifu had prepared a huge trap for Luo Qingfeng. On the other hand, Zheng Yongshou accompanied Luo Qingfeng on the flight from Ye City to Kuala Lumpur.

After a few transfers and flying through the night, the two finally landed at the airport in the capital of ponautu, evates Island.

Qingfeng Luo and Zheng Yongshou walked out of the simple and crude terminal. Even though Qingfeng Luo was an Aurous core stage cultivator, after such a long night flight, he could not help but show a trace of fatigue on his face.

It wasn’t that he couldn’t support it physically, but that he wasn’t used to the feeling of not being able to control his own life and death in the air.

Even though Wang Boshan had booked first – Class tickets for them, Luo Qingfeng still felt a little breathless to stay in a closed cabin with some ordinary people.

In fact, Zheng Yongshou wasn’t any better. After this long – distance flight, he also felt that there was something wrong with his whole body. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

When the plane landed, it was already past midnight, so Zheng Yongshou said to Luo Qingfeng,””Master, you’ve had a hard journey. Martial nephew Boshan has purchased a property here. Do you want to go there and rest? We’ll go to Peach Blossom Island tomorrow?”

Qingfeng Luo felt much better after taking a few breaths of fresh air. He waved his hand and said,””No need, we’ve already walked over ten thousand Li, I want to see our Immortal Island immediately! Let’s go there directly!”

Zheng Yongshou was also hoping that Qingfeng Luo would go over immediately. After all, the visibility was at its lowest. It was definitely better to go now than during the day. Qingfeng Luo would not be able to easily notice anything wrong when he was not on guard.

Therefore, Zheng Yongshou immediately said,””Yes! Master! Then I’ll give martial nephew Boshan a call and have him prepare to receive you. ”

Qingfeng Luo nodded and said,”alright!” I’ll make the call while I walk! Let’s find a place where there’s no one and go there on our flying swords!”

Zheng Yongshou’s face couldn’t help but shiver when he heard that he had to ride a flying sword again. He recalled the sour and cool feeling of riding a flying sword during the day.

“Okay, master, let’s head south after we leave the airport! There’s a beach up ahead. There aren’t many people during the day, and it’s already midnight. There shouldn’t be anyone!” Zheng Yongshou said.

“En!” Luo Qingfeng nodded and walked toward the South.

Zheng Yongshou quickly followed and took out his mobile phone to call Wang Boshan.

Their itinerary was arranged by Wang Boshan, so Xia ruofei and the other two knew their approximate arrival time. Moreover, Wang Boshan had been paying attention to the flight status of Luo Qingfeng and Zheng Yongshou through the internet, so Xia ruofei and Wang Boshan did not rest. They knew as soon as the plane landed.

As for Li Yifu, Xia ruofei had already arranged for him to leave Peach Blossom Island in the evening.

The reason was simple. With Luo Qingfeng’s golden core cultivation, as long as his spiritual power cultivation reached the spirit gathering realm, it should be enough to cover the entire Paradise Island. If there was one more person on the island, it would easily arouse Luo Qingfeng’s suspicion.

When Li Yifu first heard that Xia ruofei wanted him to leave Peach Blossom Island at this time, he was strongly against it. In his opinion, this was no different from running away at the last minute. Moreover, he was leaving his senior granduncle alone in danger. It was simply disgraceful!

Li Yifu refused to listen to Xia ruofei no matter what he said. In the end, Xia ruofei had to use his status as a senior granduncle and force Li Yifu to leave. He also repeatedly assured that he had a secret concealment technique that could ensure that he would not be discovered by Luo Qingfeng. Even if there was danger, he was absolutely confident that he could escape. Only then did Li Yifu reluctantly obey the order.

However, Li Yifu was determined not to go far. He stopped in the sea between peach source Island and another island, pretending to be a night – Fishing tourist, and kept an eye on the situation on peach source Island.

The phone rang and Wang Boshan immediately picked it up. He still turned on the Hands – Free and said,””Junior Master Zheng.”

“Bo Shan, the head Master has decided to come to the island overnight!” Zheng Yongshou directly said,”have you prepared the room for master?”

“Don’t worry! Junior uncle Zheng!” Wang Boshan replied,”I’ve already prepared it.”

Zheng Yongshou heaved a sigh of relief when he heard this. In fact, this was a secret message, which was to ask if the array on the island was ready. Wang Boshan gave him a definite answer, so he was relieved.

“That’s good!”Zheng Yongshou continued. Head Master, bring me here on my flying sword. We’ll go ashore from the west side of the Peach Blossom Island, and I’ll take master to the ruins where we found the crystal containing the spiritual energy. ”

Zheng Yongshou said as he looked at Luo Qingfeng with a questioning look.

Qingfeng Luo was obviously satisfied with this arrangement and nodded lightly.

On the Peach Blossom Island, Wang Boshan saw that Zheng Yongshou had already passed on the information in such detail, and he was slightly happy in his heart. He nodded and said,””Alright, I’ll be waiting for you in the building!”

“Mm, that’s it then!” Zheng Yongshou said,”that’s right, prepare something to eat. We’ll serve master some supper later.”

“Yes! Junior uncle Zheng!” Wang Boshan said.

After hanging up, Xia ruofei immediately stood up and said,””There’s no time to waste. I’ll immediately rush to the core of the formation. Wang Boshan, your task is to guard the phone and never miss any information from Zheng Yongshou. If there’s a situation, use the walkie – talkie to contact me!”

“Yes! Master!” Wang Boshan replied respectfully.

Xia ruofei knew that cultivators could fly very fast on their flying swords. They were not far from evatz Island, so he could not afford to waste any time. He quickly took the elevator to the underground parking lot and drove the Land Rover to the West of Peach Blossom Island.
