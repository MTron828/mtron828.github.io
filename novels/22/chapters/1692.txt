After Xia ruofei had gotten used to it, his work efficiency had increased. He quickly removed the grape stalks and looked no different from those skilled workers.

For the entire morning, everyone was busy with work, processing more than half of the grapes they had picked two days ago.

Xia ruofei was worried that Feng Jing would be tired and advised her to rest at the side. However, Feng Jing insisted on working with everyone and refused to rest.

Xia ruofei’s heart ached a little when he saw Feng Rao’s forehead covered in sweat.

After finishing his work in the morning, he immediately went over to pour Feng Jing a glass of water. After blocking everyone’s view, he secretly took out a few drops of the flower petal solution from his interspace and dripped them into the water. Then, he brought the glass to Feng Jing.

“Sister che, drink some water!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Yo! Why do I feel a little overwhelmed by the boss’s personal service?” Feng Rao said with a smile.

“Still joking? Hurry up and take a break! “Look how tired you are ...” Xia ruofei said.

Feng Rao smiled sweetly, took the cup, and gulped it down. She then blinked at Xia ruofei and said,””I’m not tired! Let’s come back in the afternoon!”

“Don’t try to show off!” Xia ruofei said,”just stay on the farm and rest in the afternoon ...”

“I’m really not tired!” Feng Rao said,”I think it’s quite interesting! In China, sitting in the office all day, my cervical spine and lumbar spine are damaged. Now that I’ve done physical work, I feel relaxed all over!”

Old West walked over and gave the two a thumbs up.””Xia, Feng, your skills in ridiculing people are already very good! Thank you for your help!”

Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”uncle Wester, I should be the one thanking you!” Auntie caitley already told me that you’ve all been working hard during this period!”

Old West chuckled and said,”it’s hard work, but it’s a great sense of accomplishment! Xia, the quality of the grapes you’ve provided is really great! Not only did it grow grapes that met the standards of wine brewing in the first year, but the quality was even higher than the Semillon grapes I’ve seen in the past few decades! I can’t wait to see the quality of the wine made with them!”

“Ruofei, did you provide these grape seedlings?” Feng Rao asked curiously in Chinese.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”yes!” I happen to know of a better type of Semillon grape, so I imported a batch of them to the Hunter Valley. Then, I asked uncle Wester to dig out all the grapes that were originally planted and plant them with the new species that I provided!”

“You’re too bold!” Feng Rao said,”what if there’s a problem with the grape Tree? Wouldn’t that be a delay of several years?”

Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”uncle Wester thought the same way, but ... Hasn’t the truth been proven?” This is indeed a high – Quality Grape Tree!”

After the two of them chatted for a while, Xia ruofei said to the two of them,””Uncle Wester, aunty cabalie, we’ll head back to the farm first. We’ll come back in the afternoon!”

“Let’s eat here!” “I’ll make you guys something delicious!” Said Auntie kaberel hurriedly.

“No, no, no!” Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”it’s ready at the farm. Let’s go back and eat!”

The two elders had been working so hard these past few days. Xia ruofei really did not want to trouble them. If they stayed for lunch, aunt Capella would definitely prepare a sumptuous lunch. They were already so tired from work, how could they bear to do that?

“Alright then!” Old West said,”but you can rest on the farm in the afternoon! You don’t need to come over and help ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and pointed at Feng Rao.”I originally planned to do the same, but sister che wasn’t willing! She likes the working atmosphere here!”

“Hahaha! Then bring it on!” Old West said happily,”but pay attention to rest. You can’t work as hard as you did in the morning!”

In the morning, Xia ruofei and Feng Rao worked even harder than the workers. The two of them processed more than 20 baskets of grapes. Even old West and his wife were secretly impressed. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“I know!” Xia ruofei said,”the afternoon sun is very strong. You guys should rest and not work too early!”

The two of them left West Winery and returned to Paradise Farm for lunch.

At Paradise Farm, Xia ruofei met the full – time Deputy Manager of the farm, Daphne, again. Although Liang Qichao tried to hide it, he could tell from some small details that Liang Qichao and Daphne were already together.

While helping to clean up the dishes, Xia ruofei muttered in Liang Qichao’s ear,””Good job, brother! You’re here in Australia to show off our country’s might! This Western girl is not bad. Think about how to get past your father and then marry her!”

Liang Qichao said with a bitter face,”things aren’t even set in stone yet!” Besides, you know how old – fashioned my dad is ... How could he possibly agree to me marrying a foreign woman? Why don’t you ... Help me think of a way?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I’m sorry, but I can’t help!” You’d better think of a way yourself! Haha.....I’m going to take a nap!”

“Hey!” Liang Qichao called out, but Xia ruofei did not stop. She quickly ran up the stairs. Liang Qichao was so angry that he threw the cloth in his hand into the sink and said,”you’re not loyal ...”
