Chapter 1097: Glass – Type jade (2)

Translator: 549690339

After she received Ma Zhiming’s call last night, she was a little nervous. The matter that young master Ma from the headquarters personally called must be very important. Ma Zhiming also specifically said on the phone that this Mr. Xia was an important guest of their family and must be received well, which made her pay more attention to him.

Xiao Xiaohong even informed the employees to come to work half an hour earlier that night. She cleaned the store inside and out, then repeatedly emphasized the need to pay attention to the image and service attitude.

She was just worried that this Mr. Xia would have a bad impression of the Beijing branch. If he casually mentioned it to Ma Zhiming later, she, as the manager, would be in trouble.

Actually, Xia ruofei didn’t have that kind of free time! His only purpose for coming here today was to choose a piece of good Jade.

Xiao Xiaohong personally led Xia ruofei into the store.

The storefront’s decorations were very high – end. Two large rows of glass counters were filled with all kinds of jewelries and Jade of different grades. There was even a display cabinet against the wall. Some high – end Jade was placed inside, and under the illumination of the spotlight, it looked beautiful.

The staff greeted Xiao Xiaohong and Xia ruofei one after another. Xiao Xiaohong led Xia ruofei through the store and up the stairs to the office on the second floor.

In Xiao Xiaohong’s huge office, she took out all four pieces of jade that she had prepared from the safe.

Then she smiled and said,”Mr. Xia, all the high – grade Jade in our store is here. The rest have either been cut and carved by the master or are of poor quality.” Let me introduce you to these pieces of jade!”

“Manager Xiao, I’ll take a look first!” Xia ruofei waved his hand.

“Alright, please do as you please!” Xiao Xiaohong said.

She didn’t think much of it. Xia ruofei was so young that she couldn’t tell the quality of Jade. However, Ma Zhiming had personally told her to treat Xia ruofei well, so she didn’t dare to neglect him.

Xiao Xiaohong did not know that Xia ruofei did not distinguish jades by experience. When the painting was close to the jadeite, he would naturally sense it. Xia ruofei had bought a lot of good jadeite in the early days through this method and had never failed.

Although Xia ruofei rarely used jades to upgrade the spirit map space, the identification function was still very useful.

Xia ruofei walked closer to the pieces of jade and looked at them. He even reached out to touch them.

Xiao Xiaohong looked at Xia ruofei and was even more certain that he was an amateur.

She didn’t expect Xia ruofei to point at a fist – sized piece of Jade and say,””Manager Xiao, I’ll take this one!”

This piece of Jade looked very clear and pure. However, compared to the other three ice – Type green jades, the one that Xia ruofei chose was colorless. To an outsider, it did not look the best. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Xiao Xiaohong’s beautiful eyes revealed a trace of surprise as she said,””Mr. Xia, you have good eyes! This is the only glass type jade we have in our store!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Actually, I don’t know much. I just felt it.”

“You can choose so accurately based on your feelings. You can go stone gambling now,” Xiao Xiaohong said with a smile.

Xia ruofei laughed and asked,”manager Xiao, how much does this Jade cost?” I want this!”

“Mr. Xia, this glass – Type jade has a pretty good water head,” Xiao Xiaohong said.”The only flaw is that it’s a colorless Jade. If it had a color, or even reached the standard of King’s Green, the price would be different ...”

After a brief introduction, Xiao Xiaohong said,””The purchase price of this piece of Imperial Jade is 2.8 million Huaxia dollars. Mr. MA has told me that if you want it, I will give it to you according to the purchase price!”

Ma Zhiming was also very clear that Xia ruofei would not accept it if he gave it to her for free, so he simply told Xiao Xiaohong that no matter which piece of Jade Xia ruofei liked, she should give it to him according to the purchase price, and she was not allowed to make a single cent.

Xia ruofei replied without hesitation,”no problem!” Let’s go to the bank and transfer the money now!”

He also knew that if the purchase price of this piece of Jade was 2.8 million Yuan, plus other transportation, security, taxes, and other costs, it would definitely be more than this. However, he couldn’t calculate it so clearly, or he would be regarded as an outsider.

“Alright!” Xiao Xiaohong said.

Then, she quickly called the finance staff and the two accompanied Xia ruofei to the bank to transfer the money.

Before they left, Xia ruofei said,”manager Xiao, please find a bag and help me put this piece of Jade in.” I won’t be coming back later ...”

“Ah?” Xiao Xiaohong was taken aback.”Mr. Xia, I’m afraid ... This isn’t very safe!”

This Jade was worth two to three million Yuan! If it was carved into Jade, its value would even increase by several times. If he were to carry it out in a bag, what if it was robbed?

Xia ruofei laughed.”Don’t worry about safety. If we’re unlucky enough to be robbed, I’ll pay for it!”

Xiao Xiaohong tried to persuade him, but Xia ruofei had already walked out.

This was a guest that Ma Zhiming had personally instructed her to receive. Xiao Xiaohong didn’t dare to say anything. She quickly found a bag and put the Jade in it. Then, she quickly followed Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei looked back at Xiao Xiaohong and took the Jade with a smile. Then, the three of them went downstairs together.

Xiao Xiaohong had already asked the store’s driver to wait for them downstairs. The three of them got in the car and went straight to the bank.

Xia ruofei quickly finished the transfer. He declined Xiao Xiaohong’s offer to drive him home. He took the Jade that was worth a few million Yuan and hailed a taxi to return to the hotel.

Only then did Xiao Xiaohong let out a sigh of relief. Just now, her heart had been hanging in the air, afraid that something would really happen and the Jade would be raped.

Xiao Xiaohong thought to herself,”Boss Ma’s friend is really not an ordinary person. He’s so calm even when he’s carrying an Imperial Jade worth a few million Yuan. I guess this amount of money is nothing in his eyes!”

......

After Xia ruofei returned to the hotel, she locked herself in her room, locked the door, and turned on the ‘Do Not Disturb’ light.

He went straight to the bedroom, locked all the doors and windows, and then carefully checked the room again.

Xia ruofei was very experienced in anti – reconnaissance, and now he had the help of strong spiritual power. So, he quickly checked the entire room. After making sure that there was no listening or monitoring device, he summoned the spirit map scroll.

He carefully lifted the quilt and stuffed the painting inside. Then, he entered the medium with a flash.

This way, even if someone barged into the room, they wouldn’t be able to notice anything unusual.

At the same time, as the owner of the spirit map space, Xia ruofei could also release a trace of his spiritual power at any time to keep an eye on the situation outside.

After all, they were not at home. It was impossible to be too cautious when it came to protecting the secrets of the spirit map space.

After Xia ruofei arrived at the Archean realm, he waved his hand at Xia Qing, indicating for him to do his own thing and not to worry about him.

Xia ruofei walked to the side of the spatial spirit pond and sat down cross – legged.

Then, he waved his hand, and a small toolbox on a shelf not far away floated over and landed in front of him.

Inside was a full set of carving tools.

Xia ruofei took the transparent jade and looked at it for a while.

Perhaps in the eyes of an expert, this piece of glass – Type jade was not of the best quality at all, because it was colorless.

However, that was only the value of the jewelry. Xia ruofei paid more attention to the quality of the Jade. The color of the Jade was only for decoration and not the quality.

This piece of Jade was exquisite, pure, and flawless. In terms of quality, it was definitely of the highest grade.

The better the quality of the Jade, the stronger the ability to carry the runes, and the longer the time of use.

From this point of view, this piece of Jade was undoubtedly the most suitable.

With the help of his spiritual power, Xia ruofei’s brain was much faster than before. He quickly planned out how to use the whole piece of Jade. Then, he picked up a carving knife and cut it without hesitation ...
