“I’ll try!” Xia ruofei said without hesitation.

The brush, ink, paper, and inkstone were all ready. Xia ruofei went to the table, picked up the brush, and began to draw a picture.

Xia ruofei finished the drawing in no time.

Under normal circumstances, these two diagrams would take a lot of time to deduce, and one would also need a strong mathematical talent to be able to draw them out. Especially the 20 – line diagram, which was actually drawn with the help of a computer. However, these two atlases were stored in Xia ruofei’s mind. He didn’t even need to think and could just draw them out.

Taoist Zhen Yang held the two pieces of paper with ink still wet and looked at them seriously for a long time. Finally, he confirmed that Xia ruofei had really come up with the arrangement of the 18 and 20 lines.

He said in a surprised tone,”scholar Xia is truly a genius. This humble Daoist is full of admiration!” I wonder if you can draw more lines?”

Xia ruofei smiled.”In theory, there is indeed a way to arrange more lines. However, it will take a lot of time to deduce. I can’t do it in a short time.”

Xia ruofei knew that with the computer’s complicated calculations, more lines could be deduced. 20 lines was not the limit. However, he had never seen such a diagram before, so he naturally knew when to stop. He couldn’t really deduce it on the spot, and he didn’t have the ability to do so.

Besides, Xia ruofei had heard that arranging the lines was not limited to the two – dimensional space. It could only be done in the three – dimensional space. Even Taoist Zhen Yang might not be able to understand it if it was drawn on a piece of paper.

Hearing this, old Daoist Zhen Yang smiled and said,”It doesn’t matter. Master Xia’s performance has already exceeded my imagination!”

“In that case, I can get an extra reward?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

Old Daoist Zhen Yang nodded and said,”Naturally!”

After saying that, Daoist Zhen Yang paused for a moment before continuing with a serious expression,”Scholar Xia, thank you for solving the question that has troubled me for many years! In order to express my gratitude, I have a few gifts for you!”

Xia ruofei’s spirits were lifted. The mission reward was about to be released! Of course, he would not pretend to decline politely, because he did not know if the NPC in front of him would really go along with the flow and not give the reward because of his refusal. If that was the case, he would be in deep trouble.

“Thank you!” Xia ruofei said with a bright smile, then looked at old Taoist Zhen Yang with anticipation.

With a flip of his hand, old Daoist Zhen Yang took out a long wooden box from his storage treasure and handed it to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei took the wooden box and opened it. It was a flying sword that was as clear as autumn water. The blade was as thin as a cicada’s wing and it had an extremely sharp aura.

The flying sword was obviously a good item, but Xia ruofei was a little disappointed.

The reason was very simple. He had already tried it. Flying swords could not be used in this Mystic realm at all. No matter how good a flying sword was, if it could not be controlled, its function would be reduced by ninety percent. It could only be used as a relatively sharp weapon. It was simply a waste of God’s gift to use his mental power to grab and slash.

If Xia ruofei had obtained such a flying sword on earth, he would naturally be very excited. However, in this secret realm, the most important thing was to improve his ability to survive. Besides, he already had a flying sword. If he had another flying sword, it would only be left in the spirit map space to eat dust. He would basically have no use for it.

Old Daoist Zhen Yang seemed to have seen through Xia ruofei’s disappointment. He smiled and said,”Layman Xia, this sword is called ‘curved frost’. Its most unique characteristic is that it can be used normally in this small world.”

“Thank you, Taoist priest ...” Xia ruofei said absent – mindedly. Then, he immediately came back to his senses. His eyes widened as he exclaimed,”what? The sword can be used here?” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Yes!” Old Daoist Zhen Yang nodded with a smile. Of course, the prerequisite was that scholar Xia had to be able to master the special sword – controlling technique of this sword. That’s right, the incantation is also in the case. Scholar Xia can take a look first!”

Xia ruofei quickly put the flying sword aside and picked up the wooden box. There was indeed a piece of yellowed paper in the box. Xia ruofei had been so focused on the flying sword that he did not notice this piece of paper.

Xia ruofei carefully picked up the piece of paper and looked at it. It really recorded the sword control technique.

This technique was clearly designed for the flying sword. Perhaps it was also to adapt to the special rules of this secret realm. Hence, it was very different from the sword control technique that Xia ruofei had previously mastered. As a result, Xia ruofei did not understand it at all when he first read it. He was completely confused.

However, Xia ruofei was not discouraged. On the contrary, he was very excited.

Although he couldn’t immediately understand this Sword Art, he could still see that if he really grasped this sword controlling technique, he really could control the flying sword of the bent frost in this secret realm.

To be more precise, as long as one mastered this sword controlling technique, in theory, they could also control other flying swords.

Of course, if the flying sword was specially made for this secret realm, it would definitely fit the rules of this space better. On the other hand, this technique might be able to control other flying swords refined on earth, but it definitely wouldn’t be able to control them as easily as controlling the qushuang flying sword.

Xia ruofei couldn’t care less about the fact that Taoist Zhen Yang was right beside him. He grabbed the paper that recorded the sword control technique and started to read it carefully. He even released his spiritual power to simulate it from time to time.
