2829 Throwing out the real hammer (2)

After returning to the hotel, the three of them went back to their rooms to rest.

Xia ruofei did not lie to Zhou leiyun. After he sent the email, he did not turn on his computer again. At this time,”letting the public opinion fly” was undoubtedly the best choice.

He still used origin crystals to practice the “great Dao execution” for a while, and then went to bed early to rest.

……

Madrid, Spain’s capital, the headquarters of Maca.

Fernandes, the editor on duty, returned to his desk with a cup of coffee. He took a sip of the coffee, then put the cup on the table and grabbed the mouse to start working.

The work of an editor on duty was actually very boring. A professional football media outlet like Maca had a large number of reporters interviewing outside every day, especially on match days. The articles written by these reporters after the interviews would be uploaded to an internal platform. The editor on duty had to review and check the manuscripts one by one, then label them according to their importance according to his own judgment, and inform the editor – in – chief in charge of this internal platform to review them for the second time.

To put it bluntly, the work of the editor on duty was actually to review the manuscript.

Of course, in addition to reviewing manuscripts, there were also a lot of work emails in the editorial department. The newspaper often received some news leaks in the mailbox, which also needed the editor on duty to check in time.

Today wasn’t the match day, so there weren’t many drafts on the platform.

Fernandes first opened the newspaper’s public mailbox. Every time he opened the mailbox, there would be a lot of unread emails, most of which were of little value, and a considerable number were even advertising emails.

Fernandes opened the emails one after another. Some of them were labeled as advertising emails. The next email from the same email address would be classified as “advertising email” and would not appear in the mailbox.

When it came to e – mails that obviously didn’t match the news, Fernandez simply marked them as read and ignored them. If Yingying replied to every e – mail seriously, then the editor on duty wouldn’t have to do any other work. She’d be busy replying to emails during work hours until she got off work.

At this time, an email titled “scandal of famous Catalan media< daily sports daily>” caught fernández’s attention.

Although he had seen this type of headline party email countless times, the title of the email mentioned Catalonia and The Sports Daily, which immediately increased his interest.

As a senior editor who had been working for Maca since he graduated from school, Real Madrid’s genes flowed in fernández’s blood. He had a natural hostility toward the teams and media in Catalan.

With a hint of anticipation, he opened the email and muttered to himself,””I hope it’s not a prank! Life was boring enough! It’s best to give me a little surprise!”

The email was not long, only a few words: The complete video has been released. Please click on the link.

There was a link to the address.

In addition, there were several screenshots of the video in the email.

Fernandes clicked on the picture and looked at it on the whole screen. He suddenly narrowed his eyes and became even more curious.

“Sports daily” Pablo had been very popular on Facebook for the past few days. He was a little well – known in the sports media circle. This time, he had posted many articles to criticize the Spanish clubs, accusing Ruby of being a liar and mocking Xia ruofei and Wu Lei’s goals for being dogshit. They were not worthy of La Liga at all. In short, he was criticizing the sky, earth, and air.

Fernandes had heard about Ruby’s criticism of Camp Nou’s petty behavior, as well as Pablo’s several Facebook posts to refute Ruby. He also knew that the football circle was only so big, and everyone basically knew what was going on in the industry.

Today, however, Fernandes saw a screenshot of a video that was completely contrary to Pablo’s statement.

The screenshots that Xia ruofei had chosen were also very representative. There was the moment when the water spray system was suddenly activated, the scene of the Spanish players being caught off guard and dodging in panic, as well as the scattered Barcelona fans in the opposite stands and the scoreboard in the background.

Two or three screenshots had fully reflected the real situation of the whole thing.

Fernández thought of an interview video that Pablo had released that day. In the video, the so – called bars annual ticket member had vowed that there was no water spraying on the field at all. He also said that he had seen the Spanish players swagger into the players ‘passageway after their celebration.

Fernandes could not help but show a playful smile.

According to that bar?a fan, meyes, the Spanish players were not drenched at all. It was impossible for them to not go back to the locker room to change after entering the players ‘passageway, but run back to the field to wait for the water to spray out!

However, Ruby said that every Espanyol player had become a drenched chicken.

These were two completely contradictory statements, and one of them must have lied.

From the screenshots, it was obvious that the fan, Meyers, had lied.

And why did Mayers lie through his teeth? And the one interviewing him had to be Pablo, who had been using this matter to beat up the Spanish clubs for the past two days. Fernández, a veteran of the media industry, knew all too well about the dirty tricks of the press. He could even imagine the dirty deal behind this.

Fernandes realized that this was a good opportunity to damage the reputation of The Sports Daily. As for Pablo, as long as the situation was proven to be true, one could only imagine what would happen to him. A so – called reporter with a broken reputation would basically be unable to continue in this line of work.

Fernandes was filled with anticipation for the “complete” video in the email. He clicked on the link without hesitation, not caring if it was a fishing document or if the computer would be infected by a Trojan horse after clicking on the link. After all, it was the computer on duty in the editorial department. If it really was a prank, he would just have to reinstall the operating system. There was almost no loss.

Of course, this did not happen.

After Fernandes clicked on the link, the page jumped to a Facebook page.

He didn’t care how many people followed this Facebook account or how much content was posted. In fact, this Facebook account only posted one piece of content, which was the video that Song Wei recorded.

Therefore, Fernandes did not need to search for it at all. He saw the video at first sight.

With a hint of excitement, he clicked the play button.

There was a noisy background sound from the slightly, which resounded in the away fans ‘area not far from the podium. The Spanish fans had not left the stadium. They were still reveling in the stands at Camp Nou. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Fernandes simply turned it to silent, because he only cared about the content of the picture.

The video played quietly, and Fernandes also stared at the computer screen without moving.

Fernández did not even blink during the whole video. He just sat there without moving, and all his attention was focused on the video.

Fernandes didn’t move at all until the end of the video, and the player automatically exited the full – Screen state. He sat there in silence for two or three seconds, and the joy on his face bloomed little by little. In the end, he couldn’t help but laugh a few times, which made a female reporter who was working overtime not far away look at him.

Fernandes quickly downloaded the video and then engraved it on the CD.

As an experienced media person, he knew the importance of saving information in time. What if the video posted on Facebook was deleted? If he didn’t save it in time, where would he find such explosive news material?

After carefully putting the CD into the drawer, fernández stood up, pulled off the power supply and mouse of the laptop, and then picked up the laptop and strode to the editor-in-chief’s office.
