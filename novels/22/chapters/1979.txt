1980 Fire across the horizon (2)

In addition to some mainstream websites in Hong Kong, the discussion about the auction on the local forums was also very heated. The netizens in Hong Kong had different opinions about the sales miracle of such a Chinese company.

Most of them were in awe. After all, they were all companies owned by their Chinese compatriots. The products they sold were fought over by rich people in Europe and the United States. Everyone felt a sense of pride.

Of course, there were also a small number of young netizens who were prejudiced against the mainland and made sarcastic remarks. Arguments such as fake data and hype also appeared from time to time.

However, such voices were not mainstream.

Especially after the news from Hong Kong spread back to the mainland, the netizens who were concerned about paradise Corporation were in an uproar. A large number of them were Xia ruofei’s fans, and they were also very concerned about the news of paradise Corporation.

The internet media in the mainland also reposted it immediately.

Originally, there was a certain audit requirement for the sharing of news from Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, and overseas media. However, this was obviously a song of praise for the mainland companies, so there was no concern for people to share it.

Therefore, a “paradise craze” was quickly set off on the mainland’s internet.

If the Jade skin cream or heart – nourishing soup launched by the peach blossom company in the past had also set off a trend, then the trend this time was obviously much bigger, and it almost swept the whole country.

After all, the Paradise Corporation had already formed a rich product line and had become very famous in Hong Kong. In addition, the auction this time was very eye – catching with words like ” 100 million US dollars” and “European and American rich people”. So, compared to any other auction in the past, the crowd this time was much bigger.

As the “people’s daily” and “national TV news”, two major verified accounts, published the news of the auction on Weibo and WeChat, the reputation of paradise Corporation officially reached a peak.

It could be said that peach blossom company had now become a true internet celebrity company. Although its assets could not be compared to a large internet Group like BAT, its reputation was not any weaker.

This was a little similar to the boss who’ endorsed ‘his products back then. The difference was that although Xia ruofei was also the media’s favorite and now had a large number of loyal fans, he didn’t rely on his face to achieve success. Paradise corporation’s products were too hard to accept. Even people who didn’t like them could not find any flaws in this aspect.

WeChat articles about the peach blossom company’s auction were widely circulated in WeChat moments and WeChat groups; Weibo topics related to the peach blossom company’s auction quickly reached the top ten most searched. The number of posts on the peach blossom company’s auction was increasing exponentially in all major forums, communities, and Tieba. Memes about paradise Corporation and Xia ruofei also emerged ...

It was definitely a miracle that such a huge storm had formed in the public’s opinion in just one day without hiring any water Army to add fuel to the fire.

Some of the more capable and skilled mainland netizens also poured into Hong Kong, hoping to see first – hand news.

As a result, the small number of young Hong Kong netizens who were prejudiced against the mainland and wanted to defame them were in a tragic state ...

A mainland internet celebrity wrote on his ins: I really don’t know what the young people in Hong Kong are thinking these days. It’s fine that they chose to ignore the impressive achievements of paradise Corporation, but they even said that it’s just a publicity stunt and that the data is fake. I just want to ask, which company can get the Hong Kong magnates MA Xiong, Guo Hongjiang, Zheng jianian, the United States King of shoes, lofis, the Romania magnate Nikola, the United Kingdom telecommunication magnate Higginson ... If paradise Corporation can get these super – rich people with a total net worth of over a trillion to help them with their publicity ... They even took out real money to help them create fake data, then they were really awesome! It was much more impressive than an auction with a transaction amount of over 100 million US dollars! Finally, I really want to say this to these people: A brain is really a good thing. I hope you can get it back!

This internet celebrity had taken screenshots of similar brainless comments and posted them on the internet. At the end, he even added a helpless emoji with a shrug that was popular on the internet.

This news from ins was originally shared in his circle of friends, but as long as it was public and linked to a hot topic, how could it not spread? Very quickly, someone took a screenshot and posted it on some forums in Hong Kong.

At this time, there was a large influx of netizens from the mainland. What else was there to say? everyone swarmed forward and replied to those posts and comments that sourly questioned the peach blossom company.

At first, those accounts were still clamoring and dissing each other like dead pigs unafraid of boiling water, but soon they were scolded to the point that they did not dare to show their faces.

On Xia ruofei’s Tieba in the mainland, the most popular post was not about the auction or the foreign media reports that had climbed over the wall, but a post by Cheng Xiaoxiao.

Cheng Xiaoxiao wrote in the thread,’hahaha! I’ve met my overbearing President again, and in the Presidential Suite of a five – Star hotel in Hong Kong! Are you guys envious? Let me tell you, President Xia is really a very good person. He doesn’t put on any airs at all and even helped me solve my problems at work. If I didn’t know sister Qingxue, I wouldn’t have been able to help myself from poaching him!

Cheng Xiaoxiao posted a whole set of pictures in the thread, all of which were taken in Xia ruofei’s Presidential Suite yesterday.

Of course, in order to prevent people from deliberately distorting the truth, she also put in some effort in choosing the pictures. Bastian could be seen in all the pictures, most of which appeared in the background. There were also group photos of the three of them at dinner and so on.

After all, even though the Presidential Suite was unbelievably large, it was still considered a private space. If she went to the Presidential Suite alone to meet Xia ruofei, it was inevitable that some people with dirty thoughts would gossip.

Cheng Xiaoxiao was originally an active user of Tieba, especially the post she had made about her encounter with Xia ruofei at the Western restaurant, which made her even more famous on Tieba. Therefore, this post was immediately highlighted by the moderator.

In a short while, there were hundreds of comments.

No one had made an appointment, but everyone sent a drooling emoji in unison. The formation was extremely neat, and the scene was spectacular.

Some of the social media’s Weibo accounts, headline numbers, and Baijia accounts also downloaded those pictures and processed them according to the content of Cheng Xiaoxiao’s post, making them popular on their respective platforms.

Xia ruofei was happily browsing through the various reports about the auction on the internet in Hong Kong and the mainland. On his desk were the major newspapers in Hong Kong that were published today. They were all reports about the peach blossom company. Although the content was similar, perhaps only the focus was different, Xia ruofei still read them with great interest.

At this moment, his phone rang.

Xia ruofei took a look and swiped the screen to answer.””Director Xiao, that Short Video has been released?”

The person who called was Xiao Qiang, the marketing director who had stayed behind at San Shan. Xia ruofei had just asked him to upload the Short Video from fortune Chinese network to the official website and account of the Paradise Corporation.

“All of that has been arranged!” Xiao Qiang said,”director Xia, I’m calling you because I have something else to report!”

“Oh? Go ahead!” Xia ruofei said.

“It’s like this. Since this afternoon, the company’s publicity department has been on the phone non – stop. All of them are requests for interviews from the news media.” Xiao Qiang said,”our preliminary statistics show that there are at least more than 100 media outlets, including some very influential central media outlets. President Xia ...” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Director Xiao, I’m still dealing with some matters in Hong Kong these few days.” Xia ruofei interrupted Xiao Qiang and said,”President Feng is already on the plane. You can ask President Feng for instructions on how to deal with the media.”

“Ah?” Xiao Qiang was stunned for a moment. He knew that Xia ruofei usually didn’t care about things, but today’s matter was not a small one! Xia ruofei was actually a hands – off shopkeeper?

“Is there a problem?” Xia ruofei asked.

“Oh! No! I don’t have any!” Xiao Qiang quickly said,”by the way, the company’s official website has a surge in traffic today. Our server equipment can’t bear it, so the website’s traffic speed has started to slow down ...”

“Then increase the number of servers!” Xia ruofei said,”make a rough budget plan immediately and report to President Feng as soon as she gets off the plane. If there are no problems, buy immediately!” This matter can not be delayed!”

Fine! Before Feng Jing even got off the plane, Xia ruofei had already arranged a pile of work for her. She wondered if Feng Jing would cry if she found out the truth ...

“Understood!” Xiao Qiang said helplessly,”President Xia, I won’t disturb you any longer! You can go back to your work!”
