Translator: 549690339

The ladies all chose half – Lon. Ever since Xia ruofei brought out this white wine for the first time, they had fallen in love with its rich flavor. Even Hu Zi’s mother, who did not usually drink, poured a glass for herself.

“Uncle Ling, say a few words?” Xia ruofei looked at Ling Xiaotian with a smile.

Ling Xiaotian smiled,”I’m here as a guest today!” It should be the in – laws who say it!”

Hu’s mother waved her hand.”I’m not very good with words. In – Law, you can do the talking!”

“If you guys keep pushing me around, I won’t even be able to eat my New Year’s Eve dinner ...” Ling Qingxue chuckled.

“Alright, then I’ll say a few words!” Ling Xiaotian raised his wine glass and said,”today, our two families are spending the new year together. This is fate! Here, I also hope that the children can live in harmony and love each other. As for the elderly, they should try their best to maintain a healthy body and not cause trouble for the children! Come, everyone, let’s raise our glasses and wish you a better Annual Meeting!”

“Cheers!”

“Cheers!”

After drinking the first glass of wine, the New Year’s Eve dinner officially started.

According to tradition, the first dish everyone ate was the swallow of peace. Hu Zi’s mother also personally served a bowl for everyone. In addition to the swallow of meat, there was also a boiled duck egg in everyone’s bowl. In San Shan, this was called “the egg of peace.” It also had an auspicious meaning.

He had to eat every dish for the New Year’s Eve dinner. He could have a taste of the other dishes, but he had to finish this bowl of Taiping swallow.

The people present were all born and raised in the three mountains, so they didn’t need anyone to teach them about these things. They all picked up their bowls.

The swallow skin made by Hu Zi’s mother was extremely chewy, and the sweet potato flour mixed in was just right. It was soft, smooth, and fragrant in the mouth. The meat filling was also very flavorful, and Trotter’s hoof was also added. There was a bit of crunchy in the fresh and fragrant taste. After eating it, everyone was full of praise. Even Ling Xiaotian, the head chef with a very picky taste, couldn’t help but give a thumbs up.

Seeing that everyone liked the swallow she made so much, Hu Zi’s mother was so happy that she could not close her mouth.

“In – Law, I still have two pounds of swallow skin left. If you like it, you can bring it back. If you want to eat it, you can make some for yourself!” She said with a smile.

“Mom!” Lin Qiao said with a smile. Uncle Ling is a Top Chef, and they sell swallow skins in their shop. Why would they need us to give them to them?”

However, Ling Xiaotian immediately replied,”yes, yes, yes!” This swallow skin is much better than the one made by the chef in our shop! In – Law, I won’t stand on ceremony then! Haha, it’s embarrassing to eat and take ...”

“We’re family, don’t be so formal!” Hu ‘er’s mother said happily.

After eating the swallow of peace, everyone would choose the dishes they liked according to their taste.

The steamed Chinese perch and Buddha Jumps Over the Wall were still the most popular dishes. Lin Qiao’s mouth was full of oil, and even Ling Qingxue, who always paid attention to her image, took a few mouthfuls.

Ling Xiaotian was so happy that he grinned when he saw that his dish was well – received. The main credit for this dish came from the ingredients provided by Xia ruofei, but that did not affect his sense of achievement at all.

Sanshan wasn’t like the North. The New Year’s Eve dinner usually started earlier. After everyone had their fill, the Spring Festival Gala had yet to begin. It was only a warm – up live broadcast.

Hu Zi’s mother, Ling Qingxue, and Lin Qiao began to clean up the mess. Ling Xiaotian and Xia ruofei were once again excluded by the women. The Father – in – Law and son – in – Law simply sat in the living room, making tea and watching TV.

Ling Xiaotian and his daughter were not in a hurry to leave Yingluo after dinner. After all, it was New Year’s Eve today. It was inevitable that they would feel a little lonely if they returned home and stayed in the cold villa. It was better to stay here and watch the Spring Festival Gala together.

At eighto’ clock sharp, the Spring Festival Gala on the National television station, which was said to have the highest viewership in the world, began.

The two families sat on the sofa in the living room, drinking tea and chatting while eating melon seeds. They watched the Spring Festival Gala at the same time, and the atmosphere was harmonious.

In fact, the entertainment industry was very developed now. In order to balance the needs of various aspects, the Spring Festival Gala also had a lot of song and dance programs. The language programs that people liked had been constantly edited after rounds of approval because of broadcasting standards, so the level of excitement was greatly reduced.

However, watching the Spring Festival Gala during the new year was more of a habit. It was as if something would be missing during the new year if one didn’t watch the Spring Festival Gala.

Lin Qiao was watching TV and scrolling through Weibo on her phone.

Every year during the spring Festival Gala, it was also the time when the flamers were the most active. Many programs had just finished broadcasting when there were already an endless stream of flamers on the internet of all colors.

When she saw an interesting joke, Lin Qiao would also read it out loud, making everyone laugh. They felt that the joke was more interesting than the party.

Ling Xiaotian and his daughter did not finish watching the Spring Festival Gala. They got up and left at around 11 am.

Although the three mountains also had the custom of staying up for the new year, Hu Zi’s mother and Ling Xiaotian were, after all, old. If it wasn’t for the new year, they would have already gone to bed at this time.

Ling Xiaotian considered the fact that he and Ling Qingxue would have to stay here, and Hu Zi’s mother would have to force herself to stay with them. In addition, he was also feeling a little sleepy, so he took the initiative to bid them farewell.

Xia ruofei had picked her up when she came, so she naturally had to send her back.

“Ruofei, why don’t we call a designated driver?” Ling Qingxue said,”you drank quite a bit tonight!”

Although they had watched the Spring Festival Gala for a few hours, Xia ruofei had shared a bottle of white wine with Ling Xiaotian during the New Year’s Eve dinner. He had drunk at least five taels, so Ling Qingxue was a little worried.

In fact, when Xia ruofei got up to send them back, he had already used his true energy to force out the remaining alcohol in his body.

He smiled and said,”it’s the new year, Where can I find a designated driver?” Don’t worry! It’s been so long, and you’ve drunk so much tea. A little wine would have long dissipated!”

In fact, Xia ruofei had always been sober. After his cultivation, his alcohol tolerance seemed to have increased a lot. He could not get drunk from one or two catties of white wine, not to mention that he had only drunk five or six taels tonight.

However, just in case, he still forced the alcohol out of his body, which would make it even less of a problem.

Ling Xiaotian, on the other hand, was a little tipsy. He said,””It’s fine! I know RUO Fei’s alcohol tolerance! Just let him do it!”

Initially, Hu Zi’s mother wanted to persuade him as well. However, since Ling Xiaotian had already said so, she could only say to Xia ruofei,””Ruofei, drive slowly on the road. Come back and rest after you drop off the in – laws and Qingxue!”

Xia ruofei was definitely going to stay at the Grand View tonight. This house had four bedrooms and two living rooms. In addition, the complimentary attic was Lin Qiao’s boudoir. Even if Ling Xiaotian and his daughter were both staying, it would be able to fit in.

Hu Zi’s mother had already tidied up the room. In fact, there was a room in the house that had been reserved for Xia ruofei. All the bedsheets, blankets, pillows, and the like were already ready.

“I know, godmother!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you should rest early too. You don’t have to wait for me! Qiao’ er won’t be sleeping for a while, so she can just open the door for me!”

“Alright!” Hu Zi’s mother said with a smile.

The mother and daughter sent the three of them off at the door. Xia ruofei took Ling Xiaotian and Ling Qingxue to the elevator and went directly to the underground parking lot. They drove out of the daguantian community and headed towards Ling Xiaotian’s jiangbin villa.

There weren’t many cars on the street on New Year’s Eve. At this time, most people were at home watching the Spring Festival Gala with their families. Knight XV’s roar echoed on the empty street. They were unimpeded, and soon they approached the villa community by the river.

However, after turning into a Street, the road slowly narrowed. The rows of cone – shaped roadblocks slowly narrowed the two lanes into one lane.

Xia ruofei was still confused when he saw a few police officers in reflective vests waving their electric batons at him, signaling him to pull over.

“The police are actually so dedicated?” Xia ruofei mumbled to himself,”they don’t go home to rest during the new year?”

Ling Qingxue, who was sitting in the front passenger seat, had a worried look on her face.””Don’t tell me they’re checking for drunk driving?”
