“Did I say that?” Xia ruofei asked, confused.

“Yes, you jokingly said that Yi Tian is a nouveau riche who owns a private jet. Later on, I asked Yi Tian and found out that you don’t have your own private jet yet, so ...” Li Yifu said with certainty.

“Wait!” Xia ruofei interrupted Li Yifu’s words and asked with a strange expression,”don’t tell me you’ve gotten a plane for us!”

Li Yifu nodded and said,”senior granduncle is wise!” “The small gift I prepared for you is indeed a Gulfstream G650 commercial plane. It was a coincidence this time. A Mexico tycoon customized this plane, but he later canceled the order for various reasons. After I found out about it, I contacted the Gulfstream side and took over this plane.”

Speaking of this, Li Yifu was worried that Xia ruofei would think that it was second – hand, so he quickly explained,””The Mexico tycoon’s order has not been delivered, so this is still a brand new plane. In terms of the interior, Gulfstream has also rearranged it according to my requirements and made some changes ...”

Li Yifu said a lot before Xia ruofei came back to his senses. He quickly said,””Stop, stop! What kind of nonsense was this! Why would I want a plane? Don ‘t, don’ t!”

Ling Qingxue was also shocked. She already knew that Li Yifu must be very rich and was very respectful to Xia ruofei. However, it was too shocking for him to give a private jet worth hundreds of millions and call it a “small gift”.

What Ling Qingxue didn’t know was that even if Xia ruofei wanted the entire nine states Corporation, Li Yifu would give it to him without hesitation.

The Kyushu group was a large group with a market value of ten billion US dollars. However, after Li Yifu inherited li Jiuzhou’s inheritance, he had absolute control over the group. Money was nothing to Li Yifu. In his opinion, a few words of advice from Xia ruofei were worth more than the entire Kyushu group.

“Uncle – Master, this is my own decision,” Li Yifu said with some fear.”However, if you are not satisfied with the plane, you can tell me at any time. The Gulfstream will improve it according to your requirements at the first moment ...”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry,”is it a question of whether you’re satisfied with the plane?” I don’t even need a private jet, okay? Besides, even if you give me a Gulfstream, I can’t afford it! There’s no need to discuss this, I won’t accept it!”

“Of course!” Li Yifu quickly said,”Grand – martial uncle, the Kyushu group is naturally in charge of the rental of the hangar, maintenance, and the salary and benefits of the aircraft. You don’t have to worry about anything! I was thinking that with a private jet, it would be much more convenient for martial granduncle to travel ...”

Xia ruofei was speechless.”Foster husband, I’m usually a homebody and rarely go out. Even if I go out, I’ll only go to the capital. I rarely go out of the country. It’s such a waste for you to give me a long – distance business plane ...”

Li Yifu pleaded.”Senior granduncle, I’ve received a great favor from you, but I have nothing to repay you with. It’s just a secular object. It only represents a little bit of my sincerity. I sincerely hope that you don’t refuse it, and also give me a chance to show filial piety to you ...”

As he spoke, Li Yifu’s eyes turned red and his body trembled slightly. It was as if he would kneel down if Xia ruofei did not agree.
