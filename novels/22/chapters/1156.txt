Chapter 1157: Veteran Wu Qiang (1)

Translator: 549690339

This siheyuan had been completely transformed by Wu shuheng four or five years ago. It had a complete set of functional facilities, such as central air conditioning, floor heating system, and so on. They were still very advanced today and would not be out of date at all.

Hence, Xia ruofei only suggested some changes to the details according to his preferences.

For example, he could open a door in the third courtyard and turn the two empty rooms into a garage. This way, he could drive in and out from the back road instead of using the relatively crowded liuhai Lane.

Also, Xia ruofei came from the southeast province and liked Osmanthus trees, especially in autumn when the osmanthus flowers bloomed. The yard was filled with the fragrance of osmanthus flowers, so he was planning to plant a few Osmanthus trees in all three yards.

As for whether it could survive in the cold North, it was not within Xia ruofei’s consideration. As long as Yingluo was willing to give up the solution of the spirit Heart Flower petals, how could it not grow? Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Now, Xia ruofei had accumulated a lot of spirit Heart Flower petals. Other than pouring some into the farm’s water tower and the water tower in the pomfrets cultivation workshop on a regular basis, he did not need to use much in other places. Therefore, the reserves had been increasing steadily.

There were also some other small changes, but he felt that some places were more damaged and needed to find similar old wood to replace them.

Xia ruofei did not want to change the huge wine cellar in the basement for the time being because he had not thought of what to change it into. The courtyard house was already fully equipped with functions, so he might as well leave it there.

The changes that Xia ruofei suggested were not too difficult. Zhao Yongjun wrote them down and smiled.”No problem, my friend can definitely do it. He’s done a lot more complicated work than this!”

Xia ruofei grinned and said,”brother Zhao, I’ll leave the modification to you!” I definitely can’t wait In Beijing all the time, so I’ll have to trouble you to help me keep an eye on him!”

“Alright! Don’t you worry!” Zhao Yongjun said.

The two of them walked around the courtyard house. After Xia ruofei finished looking at it, he confirmed that there was nothing that needed to be changed.

The two of them sat in the yard and chatted for a while before they closed the door and left.

At first, Xia ruofei was prepared to treat Zhao Yongjun to a meal at the courtyard house, but he changed his mind. Those super ingredients were all stored in the spirit map space, and he couldn’t possibly take them out to use. Otherwise, it wouldn’t make sense.

Xia ruofei had no interest in buying ordinary ingredients to cook.

Just as they were about to leave, song Rui called.

“Ruofei, are you in siheyuan?” As soon as the call connected, song Rui asked in a loud voice.

“He’s here!”

“Open up, open up, open up!” Song Rui shouted,”I’m at the door!”

He hung up the phone after he finished speaking.

Xia ruofei kept his phone and smiled at Zhao Yongjun,””Song Rui, that kid, is here. I wonder what’s going on ...”

“Let’s go and take a look!” Zhao Yongjun said.

The two of them walked through the door and entered the first courtyard. Xia ruofei opened the door and saw song Rui standing at the door. Beside him was a man in his thirties with a square face. He was very strong and had a threatening aura.

“Why are you so slow!” Song Rui complained.

“You came looking for me in such a hurry, what’s the matter?” Xia ruofei looked at the strong man beside song Rui and asked with a smile.

“Didn’t you want to find someone to help you look after the courtyard?” Song Rui pointed to the brawny man beside him and said,”I helped you with this early in the morning. Here, I’ve brought you the person!”

Zhao Yongjun, who was standing behind Xia ruofei, noticed the person beside song Rui. He was stunned for a moment before he said in surprise,””Strong martial artist?”

The brawny man beside song Rui also raised his head. After looking at Zhao Yongjun for a few seconds, he cried out in surprise,””Platoon leader! What are you doing here?”

Zhao Yongjun was a little excited,”I was going to ask you!” Why are you in the capital? And you were even found by that brat song Rui?”

“I’ve been in Beijing all these years!”

“Then why didn’t you come and find me?” Zhao Yongjun said unhappily,”you don’t treat me as a brother, do you?”

Xia ruofei and song Rui were dumbfounded.

Wasn’t song Rui the one who introduced Xia ruofei to a guard? How did it become Zhao Yongjun and this Wu Qiang’s family meeting?

“Stop, stop, stop!” Song Rui called out,”big brother Zhao, you know Wu Qiang?”

“More than just knowing?” Zhao Yongjun laughed,”he’s a soldier I’ve led before!”

Xia ruofei also felt that it was a little magical. Was the world really so small?

“Don’t just stand at the door,” he said with a smile.”Let’s talk inside!”

“Yes, yes, yes, let’s talk inside the house!” Zhao Yongjun quickly said.

He was also a little excited to meet the soldiers he had led before here.

The group came to the second courtyard. The early autumn weather in the capital was not too cold, and the afternoon sun was warm, so everyone sat down at the stone table in the courtyard.

Xia ruofei went into the house and made a pot of tea.

The tea leaves didn’t take up much space and could be put in his bag, so it didn’t attract any suspicion.

Da Hong Pao was supposed to make kungfu tea, but there weren’t many people who drank kungfu tea in the North. Wu shuheng’s house didn’t have any decent tea sets, so he could only use a large teapot to make a pot.
