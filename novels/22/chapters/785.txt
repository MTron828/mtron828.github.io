Chapter 786: Second – Class hero (1)

Qin Hongwei’s speech was short, but he had a very high evaluation of Luo Zhicheng.

At the end of the speech, Qin Hongwei said,”for decades, squad leader Luo Zhicheng has been the same. He sweated on the training ground and used his blood and life to fulfill the oath that a veteran had made when he first joined the Army. He didn’t even have time to look at the lights of thousands of homes that he had protected for decades! Comrades, this is how a modern Revolutionary soldier should look like! All the soldiers of lone wolf must inherit comrade Luo Zhicheng’s last will, turn grief into strength, train hard to kill the enemy, and be ready to fight for our country at any time!”

With red eyes, the soldiers of lone wolf shouted in unison with all their strength,””Use me in the first battle, use me to win!”

After the welcoming ceremony, class monitor old Luo’s wife and daughter came up.

Squad leader Luo’s daughter looked at her father’s black and white photo, as if she still didn’t understand the meaning of life and death, and his wife had long been crying.

Guo Zhan bit his lips and said guiltily after a long time,”Sister – in – Law, I’m sorry ... I took squad leader Luo out, but I didn’t bring him back safely ...”

Squad leader Luo’s wife’s name was Lin Yue ‘e. Because she had been living in two different places for a long time, she had taken care of the elderly and children at home by herself. She also did housework all day, so she looked a little older than her actual age.

Lin Yue ‘e shook her head with tears in her eyes and said,””Captain Guo, you’re not to blame for this, it’s all fate ... Old Luo Sheng told me before he died that as a soldier, he was ready to sacrifice himself at any time! As his wife, I’m actually mentally prepared for this ...”

“Sister – in – Law, if you have any difficulties at home, just tell us. The organization will do its best to solve them. If the organization can’t solve it, I will help you solve it personally.” Guo Zhan said in a low voice.

Lin Yue ‘e shook her head.”We don’t have any requests for the organization. However, I hope that old Luo can return to his hometown and return to his roots.”

“We will respect your opinion and immediately contact the relevant Department in Ganjiang province to arrange a place for old Luo to be buried in the martyrs ‘Cemetery in his hometown,” Guo Zhan immediately said.

Lin Yue ‘e nodded and said,””Thank you ...”

Then, Lin Yue ‘e looked at Xia ruofei.

......

Xia ruofei quickly stepped forward and called out,””Sister – in – Law ...”

Squad leader old Luo and Lin Yue ‘e had been married for many years. Although they had been separated for a long time, Lin Yue’ e would still come to visit them every year. Hence, the Veterans were very familiar with this sister – in – Law.

Lin Yue ‘e squeezed out a smile and said,””Little Xia, you’ve been discharged from the Army for almost a year, right? This time, you even specially returned to the Army for old Luo’s matter. Thank you. ”

“Sister – in – Law, please don’t say that!” Xia ruofei said,”squad leader Luo is the most respected former squad leader in our entire team. We will not shirk our duty for his sake!”

Lin Yue ‘e said,”little Xia, the military chief has told me about the situation. Although I don’t know what mission you’re carrying out this time, the chief told me that the enemies who caused old Luo’s death have all been eliminated by you. You’ve even personally avenged old Luo. Thank you!”

“But no matter what, squad leader Luo ...” Xia ruofei’s expression darkened.

Speaking of this, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel a little choked up. He thought about how he had spent most of his time in the Army. Every bit of his life seemed to be filled with the shadow of old Luo, the squad leader. This loyal elder had trained him from an ordinary soldier to a Special Forces elite.

Now, the old class monitor had left forever.

After the funeral ceremony, Xia ruofei felt more and more empty.

Guo Zhan gave Xia ruofei a look and whispered,””RUO Fei!”

Xia ruofei immediately came back to his senses. At this time, the family members were already very sad and painful. He should not show such emotions.

“Sister – in – Law, I’m sorry ...” He quickly apologized.

“I’m fine ...”Lin Yue ‘e replied with reddened eyes.

“Let’s go, sis – in – Law!”Guo Zhan came over and said. The hearse is waiting in front!”

“Alright!” Lin Yue ‘e wiped her tears and said,”Nan Nan, hold onto dad’s photo properly ...”

The daughter of the squad leader old Luo, Nan Nan, nodded sensibly. She took the deceased photo of the squad leader old Luo from Guo Zhan’s hand and slowly walked toward the hearse under the lead of two female soldiers.

Guo Zhan walked to the front of the coffin and patted Tian Feilong’s shoulder, indicating for him to return to the team.

Then, Guo Zhan held the corner of the coffin and gave the order. The other seven officers, including Xia ruofei, lifted the coffin with him.

Everyone followed Lin Yue ‘e and Nannan with heavy steps, carrying the coffin toward the hearse.

Guo Zhan chose to personally carry the coffin and revive the spirit of his most respected old squad leader, sending off the last journey of his guide at the beginning of the Army.

The Requiem sounded on the training ground.

All the soldiers saluted in the direction of the coffin.

Under the orders of a platoon leader, the soldiers who participated in the war loaded their Type 95 submachine guns and pointed the muzzles at the sky.

Da da da! Da da da!

The most familiar gunshot of squad leader old Luo resounded throughout the training ground to send off the veteran.

Xia ruofei, Guo Zhan, and the rest of the Group of Eight carried the coffin of old Luo to the hearse. Lin Yue ‘e and Nan Nan also got on the car.

Apart from Jin Gang, who was still unable to get out of bed, all the soldiers who had participated in the battle this time took another coaster and followed the hearse to the funeral parlor.
