3123 The door to a new world (1)

Translator: 5496903Song Qiming had clearly not recovered from the shock.

Xia ruofei’s few words had subverted the world view that he had built up over the past few decades. All his knowledge of the world had changed in just a few minutes.

Even if it didn’t collapse completely, at least it had been proven to be incomplete.

Moreover, it was his own personal experience.

After a long while, song Qiming raised his head and asked,””Ruofei, you’re also a member of the cultivators, right? What about your cultivation?”

“Early gold core realm!” Xia ruofei had no intention of hiding it. “Actually, the cultivation environment is not very good now. The whole cultivation world is in a very depressed state. The Golden core stage cultivators are considered powerful. The nascent Soul Stage and even the primordial spirit stage have not appeared in the cultivation world for two to three hundred years.”

To make it easier for song Qiming to understand, Xia ruofei explained further,””Uncle song, if you didn’t have this opportunity, you would only be at the first Qi layer. This time, the spirit tea allowed you to break through continuously, and now you’re already at the third Qi layer, and you can break through to the fourth Qi layer at any time. The whole Qi refining stage was divided into nine stages, from Qi refining Level 1 to level 9. After breaking through the bottleneck of Qi refining level 9, the next big realm was the Golden core stage. However, even if you break through the bottleneck, there is still a process to reach the early jiedan stage. The time taken for this process varies from person to person. Some can take a few months, some can take several years. ” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

With this explanation, song Qiming had a general understanding of the cultivation realm.

He nodded slightly and then asked,””By the way, you said that the cultivation environment is not good. Why?”

Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”no one knows. It’s an unsolved mystery in the world of cultivation.” However, the objective reality was that the cultivation environment had been deteriorating. This deterioration had started about 300 years ago. It was a very long but continuous process. For example, uncle song, you can probably feel that the spiritual energy in the air is very chaotic and violent. It can’t be absorbed by cultivators, so most of the day, they can’t cultivate. Only during the four hours of midnight and Seveno’ clock will the spiritual energy slightly stabilize, allowing cultivators to cultivate. The environment has already become like this, and even normal cultivation can’t be guaranteed. One can only imagine the overall strength of the cultivation world. ”

Xia ruofei took a sip of wild tea and continued,””That’s why I asked you to use the crystal I gave you when you cultivate. It’s called a spirit crystal, and it contains a large amount of concentrated spiritual Qi, which can be absorbed by cultivators at any time. It’s because you have a spirit crystal that you can practice the ‘Qi – nurturing technique’ I mentioned earlier. In fact, you only absorb the spiritual Qi inside the spirit crystal, and the spiritual Qi in the environment can’t be absorbed at any time except at midnight and dawn. If a cultivator forcefully absorbs it, it can lead to various situations. The worst situation is that the violent spiritual energy can’t be controlled after being absorbed into the body, and the body will explode and die. ”

Xia ruofei had also considered that song Qiming did not understand cultivation at all. He was worried that he would not know the severity of the situation and try to absorb the violent and impure spiritual Qi in the air for any reason, which would lead to serious consequences. That was why he had specifically pointed out this point.

Song Qiming suddenly realized what was going on. He said fearfully,””It’s a good thing I’ve been carrying out your instructions to the letter ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.

In fact, even if song Qiming had tried to absorb the free spiritual energy in the air, the consequences would not have been too serious. His cultivation level was too low back then, and the violent spiritual energy in the air was not easy to absorb.

However, now that song Qiming’s cultivation had increased, the risk of absorbing the spiritual Qi in the air had naturally increased. Hence, Xia ruofei decided not to point it out.

Song Qiming continued,”ruofei, since this spiritual crystal is so precious, isn’t it a waste for me to use it?” I’m already so old, even if I cultivate, it’s unlikely that I’ll have any great achievements. You should keep it for your own use!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”uncle song, spiritual crystals are only relatively precious in the world of cultivation!” For ordinary cultivators, a spiritual crystal is indeed quite precious, but I still have a lot of spiritual crystals on hand, and I even have a lot of origin crystals that are one grade higher than spiritual crystals. As long as you can absorb them, I can supply them to you without any problem!”

“Moreover, speaking of age ... You’re not even 60 yet, are you?” he continued after a pause.

“En!” Song Qiming nodded and said,”however, it’s a little late to start cultivating at this age, right?”

Xia ruofei laughed.”That depends on the person. If a rogue cultivator or a cultivator from a small sect starts cultivating at the age of 60, it’s definitely too late.” But you’re different. First of all, you’ve profited from a disaster after that accident. You’re quite talented in cultivation, which means you’ll have more stamina. In addition to talent, the most important thing in cultivation was resources. In terms of resources, with my full support, it’s not too late for you to start cultivating at your age! I have a cultivator by my side who is now nearly ninety years old, but his cultivation is still stuck at the Qi layer!”
