Guo Zhan’s dark face couldn’t help but reveal a smile. He said,”Xiao Lin, there’s no such thing. With me around, would this brat dare to make a fuss?”

“That’s good, that’s good ...” Ma Jia’s wife, Lin Yue, said. She then asked,”brother Guo, is there something you need from me?”

“Oh! “There’s such a thing ...” Guo Zhan muttered to himself for a moment before asking,”this reform ... Ma Jia has been left behind, and he may have to take off his military uniform. Did you know about this?”

Lin Yue said,”he told me about it ... Big brother Guo, are you trying to persuade the family members of the cadres?” ‘There’s no need for that ... I think it’s pretty good!’ All these years, he’s been away from home in the Army, and I have to take care of all the big and small matters at home. Moreover, the two of us only see each other for less than a month in a year ... After he transferred to another job, at least he can accompany me more often ... Do you know? He’s in the Army all year round and almost never comes back. The aunties in my unit even think that I’m divorced! You’re already trying to introduce me to someone! Later on, there was a time when Ma Jia was on leave, and I took him around the unit. I introduced him to everyone I met, saying that he was my husband and that I wasn’t divorced, nor was I a widow!”

When Lin Yue said this, the few men in the private room became silent, and Ma Jia’s eyes began to turn red.

Lin Yue continued,”so ... Brother Guo, since it’s the organization’s need, we will definitely obey it!” The organization asked him to take off his military uniform. As his family, I can’t be ignorant, can I? You don’t need to persuade me, I understand!”

Guo Zhan looked around at everyone and then said to the phone,”Sister – in – Law, we all know that you’re a righteous person. This time, we’re not trying to persuade you. By the way, did you know that Ma Jia chose to choose her own career?” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“He said that I think it’s pretty good!” Lin Yue said,”you don’t have to go to work, and the country gives you a retirement allowance every month. What a good thing! He did the math with me, and his retirement pay is higher than my salary! You play at home every day, but you get more money than me, a person who goes to work every day. That’s why I said, the country is already good enough to us, we should know when to be content!”

Guo Zhan couldn’t help but reveal a smile and said,”It seems that Ma Jia is quite honest to have reported all this to you! Sister – in – Law, then I’ll get straight to the point ... It’s like this ... A veteran in our unit started his own business after he retired from the Army, and now his business is quite big. You should have heard of his business, it’s called paradise company. ”

“I know! This is the company that produces the jaded skin cream. ” Lin Yue said,”I heard that the effect is extremely good, but we, the working class, can’t afford it. Moreover, we have to rush to buy it ...”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but sweat. He leaned over to the phone and said loudly,””Sister – in – Law, I’ll give you two sets of jaded skin cream. I’ll ask the old company commander to send them to you personally!”

On the other end of the phone, Lin Yue clearly did not expect that there was someone else besides Guo Zhan and ma su. She was stunned for a moment before she said a little unnaturally,””Then ... Then thank you. May I know who you are?”

When ma su saw that Guo Zhan and Xia ruofei were chatting with his wife, he couldn’t help but lean over and say,””Wife, the one who just spoke was Xia ruofei. You’ve met her before. She’s Xiao Xia from class one when I was the company commander! He’s amazing now! The company’s market value is in the billions, and we make so much money every day that our hands are tired. So, you don’t have to be polite when he said he would give you the jaded skin cream! That’s what their company sells!”

Lin Yue pouted and said,”What do you mean you’re welcome?” Didn’t they need to pay for this business? You, go to the side! I’m talking to brother Guo and Xiao Xia!”

Ma Jia was immediately frightened by his wife’s words. He dejectedly returned to his seat and sat down, his face full of resentment.

Lin Yue continued,”little Xia!” I remember now. At that time, you and Lin Hu were the two youngest soldiers in the company. Every time I went to visit my relatives, you two would be the ones fighting to help me carry my bags!”

“I told you, sister – in – Law, you can’t forget me!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Ruofei, don’t interrupt me,” Guo Zhan said.”Let me talk to Xiao Lin about serious matters!”

Then, Guo Zhan continued,”little Lin!” It was like this ... RUO Fei’s company had a project that needed to set up a guard team, and it just so happened that they needed talents in the Special Forces. Wasn’t ma Jia preparing to choose her own career? So I recommended him to RUO Fei. Now that we’ve basically decided, Ma Jia will work for RUO Fei in the future. ”

“Is that so ...” Lin Yue said with some hesitation,”I thought that after he changed his career, he would be able to accompany me at home every day ... But it’s fine. Since you recommended him and he’s going to little Xia’s company, it can’t be wrong! He was a man! I still have to put my career first. ”

“I knew you would support me!” Guo Zhan chuckled and said,”but you’ve been living separately for a long time. Now that you’ve changed jobs, you still have to live in different places. Ruofei and I can’t bear it. RUO Fei still remembers that you major in Meteorology, and he needs people in that field as well. He wants you to work with him, so that your income will be much higher than your current job. You and your wife won’t have to live in two different places anymore. ”

After Guo Zhan finished speaking in one breath, he paused for a moment before he continued, “That’s the main reason I called today. I wanted to ask for your opinion. “
