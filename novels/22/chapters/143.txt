Xia ruofei’s expression changed slightly. He quickly followed the voice. Very quickly, he arrived at the door of a hospital ward. He saw that this hospital ward was packed with seven to eight people. Cao tieshu and a few people who looked like farmers were in a confrontation with a few people in police uniforms. A middle – aged woman was lying on the bed with a pained expression. Her leg was in a thick cast and there were bruises on her face. Xia ruofei noticed that the men in uniforms did not have official ranks. From their armbands, he could tell that they were Auxiliary Police officers. The leading auxiliary police officer was in his early twenties. He didn’t wear a police hat and had long hair. His black police uniform jacket was unbuttoned, and the tie on his shirt was crooked. With a cigarette in his mouth, he didn’t look like a police officer but more like a bandit. The auxiliary police officer took a puff of his cigarette and frivolously blew the smoke in his mouth towards Cao tieshu. Then, he pointed at Cao tieshu with the cigarette between his fingers and said,””Old man! Don’t be so ungrateful! It’s already very easy for you to pay. If you continue to talk nonsense, I’ll arrest all of you!” Cao tieshu straightened his neck, and his eyes were about to spew fire. He was so angry that his body trembled and he shouted,””If you have the ability, then arrest all of us! I don’t believe that there’s no place for reasoning!” “Yo! You’re quite unreasonable, aren’t you?” The auxiliary police officer threw away the cigarette butt, pointed at Cao tieshu, and said,”come with us to the police station! Motherf * cker, I can’t deal with you! Brothers, handcuff him!” A few Auxiliary Police officers behind him immediately came forward to arrest Cao tieshu. Xia ruofei couldn’t take it anymore and shouted,””Stop! What are you guys doing?” After he finished speaking, he strode into the ward and stood between Cao tieshu and the other police officers. Cao tieshu was also surprised to see Xia ruofei. He asked,””Boss, what are you doing here?” Xia ruofei nodded at Cao tieshu, then looked at the police officers and coldly asked,””What are you guys doing?” The leader of the police officers glanced at Xia ruofei and asked,””Who are you? I’m warning you! Don’t get in the way of our official duties, or we’ll arrest you as well!” Xia ruofei’s lips twitched and he asked,””Executing official duties? You still want to arrest people? Do you have the relevant documents? Did the auxiliary Police have the power to independently enforce the law? Where’s your police captain? “Also, he’s disheveled and isn’t well – dressed. He’s smoking in the ward while wearing a police uniform. What kind of character is this?! Is this how your leader leads his team?” The series of questions confused the leader of the auxiliary Police. He saw that Xia ruofei’s manner was extraordinary, and he spoke with a sense of justice, so he suddenly lost his confidence. “Who are you?” he asked hesitantly. Xia ruofei smiled faintly and pointed at Cao tieshu,””Didn’t you hear me just now? I’m his boss. ” “Boss? Where are you from?” One of the auxiliary Police officers behind the leading police officer asked bravely. “We’re from Taoyuan farm!”Cao tieshu said with his head held high. The leading police officer was stunned for a moment. He opened his eyes wide and then sneered,”Fuck! I thought it was some Big Shot! So you’re just a F * cking farmer! Why are you pretending to be a big – tailed Wolf! That big tone ... People who don’t know you might think you’re the director of the Public Security Bureau! F * ck ...” At first, he was not sure about Xia ruofei’s background, so he was a little apprehensive. Now that he heard that the other party was the owner of a small farm that he had never heard of, he suddenly felt that he had been too careful. When he thought about how he had been intimidated by a farmer, the leader of the auxiliary Police felt that he had lost a lot of face in front of his brothers, so he also became angry from embarrassment and began to curse. The group of Auxiliary Police officers behind him also laughed. “I thought you were some Big Boss! So you’re a vegetable farmer!” “This guy ... Is really quite scary!” “Haha, farm owner, I’m so scared ...” Xia ruofei looked at the group of police officers quietly, as if he was watching a group of clowns. “Hey, Big Boss, listen up! These few people killed my Alsatian!” The leader of the auxiliary Police said loudly,”you’re such a Big Boss, why don’t you help them pay! It’s not expensive, only 50000 Yuan!” Xia ruofei said indifferently,”so it’s a private matter?” Then, you brought so many people here in police uniforms, and just now you were shouting about taking them to the police station. Is this considered private use?” “Private, your mother! Do you really think you’re a big leader?” The leader of the auxiliary Police officers ‘expression changed and he cursed,”get out if you don’t have money to pay! I’ll catch you as well if you continue to talk nonsense!” Xia ruofei’s expression turned cold as he chided,””You’re the ones who should get out! This is a hospital, you can’t do as you please!” “Motherf * cker! You refuse a toast only to drink a forfeit!” The leader of the auxiliary Police said with a fierce look,”brothers, handcuff this kid first! Didn’t he like to talk big? Let him slowly tell you at the Bureau!” The auxiliary Police officers agreed and surrounded Xia ruofei. One of them was holding a pair of handcuffs. Seeing this, Cao tieshu also became anxious. He loudly said,”Stop! What right do you have to arrest my boss?” Those Auxiliary Police naturally did not pay attention to Cao tieshu’s shouts. Xia ruofei remained calm until one of the auxiliary Police officers reached out to grab his arm. He shook his hand lightly and his body flashed like a ghost. Muffled sounds of fists hitting bodies could be heard. No one could even see Xia ruofei’s movements clearly. It felt like in a few blinks of an eye, the police officers were lying on the ground and groaning in pain. All of them had bruises on their faces, and they looked extremely miserable. Xia ruofei calmly clapped his hands, walked over, grabbed one person in each hand, and threw them all out of the ward in no time. The leader of the police officers stood at the side and could not believe his eyes. It was only when Xia ruofei walked towards him that he shuddered and shouted,””You dare to attack a police officer!” “You think too highly of yourself. Are you a police officer? “It’s not even enough to assault a police officer ...” Xia ruofei pouted and said,”besides ... So what if I assault a police officer?” Xia ruofei said as he walked towards the police officer. With every step he took, the police officer felt more pressured and couldn’t help but take a few steps back. “Don’t come over! Don’t come over ...” Xia ruofei’s display of skill had scared the police out of their wits. Xia ruofei looked at him in disgust and said,””Your mouth is too smelly. Slap yourself ten times and then get lost!” “What? You ... You ... Don’t go too far!” The auxiliary police officer said as he retreated. He was no longer as arrogant and domineering as before. Now, he was just thinking about how to escape. Xia ruofei snorted and said,”since you’re so unconscious, I’ll do it for you!” With that, he rushed forward, grabbed the assistant policeman’s collar with one hand, and quickly waved his other hand. Pi Li pa la! The crisp sound of a slap was heard. Xia ruofei slapped the police officer ten times, and the police officer’s face swelled up at a speed that was visible to the naked eye. He was stunned by the ten slaps and even forgot the pain on his face. He just stood there in a daze with a look of disbelief on his face. Xia ruofei threw him out of the door and said indifferently,””Get lost!” The auxiliary Police officers looked at each other and showed a look of fear. Then, they helped each other and fled. At the end of the corridor, the leading auxiliary police officer turned around and shouted,””Just you wait! Don’t run if you have the guts!” Xia ruofei did not care about his hollering. He turned around and looked at Cao tieshu, asking,””Old Cao, tell me! What’s going on?” [PS] announcing the VIP Reader group number: 295848872, welcome to the group (screenshot of full subscription needed to be verified), please continue to ask for everyone’s support, monthly votes, tips, recommendations ...
