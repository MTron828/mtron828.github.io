2051 Brother, I can only help you this much (2)

“Dating without marriage in mind is considered being a hooligan?” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”in terms of traditional values, this is not wrong. And I believe that most people with normal values don’t think about breaking up in the future when they’re in love, right? It was just that after a period of time together, she realized that the two of them had different personalities, living habits, and even values. That was why she chose to separate in the end! This kind of love can’t be called being a hooligan, right?”

Zhuo Yiyi nodded.”I’m not that extreme either. But ... Song Rui’s situation is a little different.”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”I understand.” I’m probably under a lot of pressure when I’m with song Rui, and this pressure mainly comes from his family, am I right?”

Zhuo Yiyi nodded silently. Actually, she had heard most of song Rui’s family situation from Song Wei. She had also heard about the marriage arrangements of the younger generation in these big families, which was why she had hesitated for so long.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”it’s not unreasonable to have such concerns.” “However, Xiao Rui is a determined person. He won’t give up easily once he’s set his mind on something. You don’t have to be so pessimistic about their future. Also, how much he can decide on his own marriage, in addition to his own determination, also depends on his achievements. This is also one of the reasons why he’s working so hard now. ”

Zhuo Yiyi was slightly moved, and she nodded silently.

“Also, as his brother, I will support him unconditionally.” Xia ruofei said,”although I can’t say that I have much influence on the song family, I can still help him!”

At this point, Xia ruofei stood up and said,””Of course, as I said before, outsiders can’t help in matters of the heart. The decision is still up to you. Just take it that I’ve had too much to drink and said a few words. Don’t take it to heart!”

Zhuo Yiyi said seriously,”I understand. I will seriously consider it!” Thank you, ruofei!”

At that moment, the drunk song Rui mumbled,””Yiyi ... I don’t want to ... Be your good brother ... I never wanted to ...”

Zhuo Yiyi’s face heated up, and she said in a flustered manner,””Ruofei, I’ll be leaving first! Don’t get someone to send me off!”

“How can I do that?” Xia ruofei said and then shouted,”Wu Qiang! Strong martial arts!”

Wu Qiang, who had been on standby not far away, immediately pushed the door open and said,””You called for me, boss?”

“Drive Zhuo Yiyi home. Be careful on the road!” Xia ruofei said.

“Yes!” Wu Qiang said,”miss Zhuo, this way please!”

“Ruofei, you should help big brother Zhao and the others settle down first before sending me off,” Zhuo Yiyi said hurriedly.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”don’t worry!” With me around, song Rui won’t sleep in the dining room. You can go back without worry!”

Zhuo Yiyi’s face reddened, and she lowered her eyes.”I don’t care if he’s Dead or Alive!”

After saying that, she left the dining room in a hurry.

Xia ruofei patted the unconscious song Rui and said to himself,””Xiao Rui, this is all I can do for you. You’ll have to rely on yourself for the rest!”

With that, he strode out of the restaurant and sent Zhuo Yiyi to her car. After waving goodbye, he turned around and left.

Xia ruofei held one person in each hand and carried the two of them to the front yard.

Wu Xiujuan had already prepared the guest room in advance. The bedsheets were all new, and the smell of sunshine permeated through the room.

Xia ruofei made a few trips back and forth and sent Zhao Yongjun and the others to their respective guest rooms. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The good thing about the Drunken Eight Immortals was that even if one got drunk, they would not get drunk the next day.

However, in order to prevent them from vomiting at night, Xia ruofei used his true energy to force out a portion of the alcohol in their bodies.

Of course, he didn’t completely help them get rid of the alcohol. He still kept them in a dazed state, the kind that could sleep all the way until dawn.

After settling down Zhao Yongjun and the others, Xia ruofei returned to the master’s yard to rest. Wu Xiujuan and Xia Xiaolan would take care of the mess in the backyard.

Xia ruofei used his genuine Qi to dispel the alcohol in his body. He took a hot bath and went back to his room to take out spiritual crystals to cultivate for a while before going to bed to rest.

The next morning, Xia ruofei was woken up by song Rui before he even got up.

He realized that he was sleeping in the guest room. He had drunk too much last night and had no memory at all. He quickly ran to the middle courtyard to look for Xia ruofei.

“RUO Fei, where’s Yiyi?” Song Rui’s loud voice could be heard from outside the alley. Naturally, Xia ruofei was woken up.

He put on his clothes helplessly and came out, saying,””I went back last night! Don’t worry, I asked Wu Qiang to drive her home and only came back after she entered the house!”

Song Rui heaved a sigh of relief. Then, he asked nervously,””By the way, brother, you didn’t say anything last night, right?”

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”it’s alright.” He only held the girl’s hand and confessed about seventeen or eighteen times!”

“Ah?” Song Rui was shocked.”Why didn’t you stop me! Is Yiyi scared?”
