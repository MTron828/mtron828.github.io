“Then why are you still dawdling! Quickly answer it!” Fang Liyun said hurriedly.

Song Wei also looked at her father nervously. After all, this was directly related to her and her teammate’s health.

Song Qiming nodded and answered the call. He greeted her warmly,””Professor Zhu, how are you?”

“Secretary song, I hope I’m not disturbing you.” Professor Zhu asked with a smile.

“No, no!” Song Qiming said,”professor Zhu, is there any new progress in the research you mentioned this afternoon?”

“Hehe, you can say that!” Professor Zhu said,”actually, they already found this direction a few days ago, but they basically verified the experimental results tonight!”

Song Qiming immediately perked up and said,””Professor Zhu, could you please tell me more about it?”

“Secretary song, it’s like this ...” Professor Zhu began to briefly introduce the work of the research team to song Qiming over the phone.

It turned out that after the research team of Room 301 had conducted an in – depth analysis of the blood sample of Song Wei’s teammate, they found that one of the trace elements was abnormal.

Of course, the content of this trace element in the blood was very small, and it did not have a symbolic effect on most diseases, so the normal test would not detect its content.

Even in a laboratory, to analyze the trace elements from blood samples required expensive and highly accurate equipment.

With this discovery, the research team confirmed the direction of their research.

They mainly analyzed the content of this trace element. At different times, they collected different blood samples from the patients, and at the same time, they also collected blood samples from patients with different diseases and healthy people.

After a large number of comparisons and data analysis, the research team finally came to the conclusion that the content of the trace elements was indeed the only indicator of the strange poison in the body.

In other words, whether it was a healthy person or a patient with various diseases, the content and proportion of this trace element in their blood was very fixed. Only Song Wei’s teammate and the blood samples of her teammates who had died for the same reason had an abnormal proportion of this trace element.

The research team had even analyzed the blood samples left behind by Song Wei when she was in Room 301. The situation was the same.

Professor Zhu tried to explain their research results to song Qiming in easy – to – understand language, and then said,””In other words, we can now basically determine whether the patient has been infected with this strange poison through these trace elements indicators. At the same time, it can also provide a guide for the patient’s recovery ...”

Professor Zhu said guiltily,””Secretary song, it’s a pity that ... We haven’t found an effective treatment for now. The only progress is that we can use this index to confirm the case and determine the severity of the condition ...”

“Professor Zhu, your research is very important and timely!” Song Qiming said excitedly. How about this! I’ll tell my family about this good news first, I’ll call you later!”

“Alright, alright, I’m free anytime tonight!” Professor Zhu smiled and said,”I’m working overtime in the laboratory with the boys! Everyone is also very excited!”

“Thank you, professor Zhu!” Song Qiming said.

After he hung up the phone, he told his wife and daughter what professor Zhu had said.

Fang Liyun was also very excited after hearing the news. She quickly said,”Old song, what are we waiting for? Immediately arrange for Wei Wei to go to the capital for another blood test!”

Song Qiming said calmly,”Liyun, don’t be anxious. Xiao Xia should have returned to San Shan by today. I think it’s safer for Weiwei to stay at San Shan. If her illness suddenly acts up, she won’t be helpless. Also, if Xiao Xia comes to visit Weiwei for a check – up in the next two days, it won’t be good if Weiwei isn’t home.”

“But if we don’t do a test, we’ll ...” Fang Liyun said in confusion. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“I didn’t say I don’t want to do the test,” said song Qiming while waving his hand. The 301 Hospital only needs a blood sample to do the test and data analysis immediately. Weiwei is staying at San Shan, but the blood sample can be sent over!”

Fang Liyun’s eyes lit up and said,”yeah!” We just need to send the blood sample over!”

Song Qiming finally made up his mind. He nodded and said,””I’ll make the arrangements immediately!”

Then, song Qiming returned to the study and made a series of phone calls.

First, he called professor Zhu in Beijing and told him that he would fly the latest blood sample of his daughter to Beijing overnight. He hoped that they would work overtime tonight to do a data analysis.

Naturally, professor Zhu would not reject song Qiming’s request. He readily agreed.

Then, song Qiming called his Secretary, Guangzhi Cao, and asked him to contact the People’s Hospital, the airport, and the air traffic control center.

Song Qiming was the Secretary of the Sanshan municipal government and the Deputy Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee. He was the third most important person in the southeast province. If he wanted to do something, his subordinates would naturally be very efficient.
