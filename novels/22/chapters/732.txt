Chapter 733: Affectionate and righteous (2)

Xia ruofei returned the ID card to Lin Qiao as soon as he got home.

“Brother ruofei, why did you take my ID card?” Lin Qiao asked.

“You’ll know in a few days!”Xia ruofei laughed.

“Tsk! You only know how to keep me in suspense ... I’m not going to talk to you!” Lin qiaojiao said angrily.

Then, he immersed himself in his laptop.

Xia ruofei took a look. Lin Qiao wasn’t watching a TV series or playing games. The computer screen was photoshopped.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but smile. It seemed that this girl had taken his words to heart. She had found a design software so quickly and started to self – study.

“Qiao’ er, I’ll bring you to the city in a few days to buy some self – study materials for the commonly used graphic design software!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it’s always faster to learn from books than to figure it out by yourself!”

“Alright!” Lin Qiao said happily,”when you’re done with this!”

She also knew that the Taoyuan fruits were being harvested these few days and the company would be very busy. As the boss of the company, Xia ruofei naturally could not slack off alone.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. He didn’t disturb Lin Qiao’s study and went straight to his room.

In the next few days, the farm entered a busy state.

......

Cao tieshu organized the farm employees and temporarily hired villagers to start harvesting the lychees and cherries.

After Cao tieshu found out about the selling price of these fruits, he was also very careful. He repeatedly emphasized this to the staff who participated in the harvesting. During the harvesting process, he also constantly reminded them, afraid that everyone would be careless and cause harm to the fruits.

The exterior packaging that Lin Qiao had been involved in the design from the beginning to the end was also produced and transported to Taoyuan farm.

Cao tieshu had temporarily found some women from the village to take on the task of packing.

After the fruits harvested from the mountain were transported, these women would do a simple screening of the fruits and then weigh them to ensure that the weight of each fruit was roughly the same.

Then, she wrapped the fruits in anti – collision foam bags and put them into a box.

Of course, in consideration of the transportation problem, the fruits for Hengfeng group were not packaged.

It was the same as the previous cooperation with Tongren Hall to sell iron – skinned fengdou. The fruits provided to Hengfeng group were packaged in large packages and then shipped together with the outer packaging. Hengfeng group would then send them to various places according to their plan, and then they would package them themselves.

Of course, there was a clear clause in the supply and marketing contract between the peach blossom company and Hengfeng group. That was, Hengfeng group must use the packaging provided by the peach blossom company and was not allowed to change the packaging of the peach blossom fruit without permission.

It was the same for the other super – Commercial channels that they cooperated with, and they had to use the packaging of the Paradise Corporation.

Xia ruofei’s main purpose was to promote the brand name of Taoyuan. If they changed the exterior packaging, what was the point?

To be honest, the fruit industry only had a revenue of 10 to 20 million a year. To Xia ruofei, it was not a big deal.

It was a busy scene in Taoyuan farm.

The cold chain trucks went in and out, transporting the harvested organic fruits from the peach Garden to various partners.

It was not until the last cart of fruits was transported away that everyone finally heaved a sigh of relief.

The past few days had been like a tough battle. Whether it was the harvesting workers or the administrative team responsible for coordinating the delivery, transportation, and other matters, everyone felt exhausted.

Xia ruofei expressed his gratitude to everyone for their hard work over the past few days. Then, he announced on the spot that the company had decided to give everyone a 1000 – Yuan bonus for their outstanding performance in this surprise mission.

Including the temporarily hired villagers, they received a bonus of 1000 Yuan in addition to the normal salary.

Everyone laughed and cheered. Some of the older employees even jokingly shouted,”President Xia is wise”,”long live President Xia”, and so on. The atmosphere was quite relaxed and happy.

After the fruit harvesting work, the farm work returned to its previous track.

The preliminary examination of the heart – nourishing soup was still in progress.

There was a time period for clinical trials, so there was no point in rushing it.

The provincial Food and Drug Administration had already given them the greatest support, and all the procedures had been completed as soon as possible.

If it was another pharmaceutical company, the cost might be several times or even more than ten times.

The expansion and transformation project was also coming to an end. The small and medium – sized professional cold storage that was completed the earliest had been completed and could be put into use soon. The new vegetable greenhouse was basically completed. Now, only some cleaning works such as environmental control were left.

There were professionals in charge of all these. Feng Jing was also in charge of the company’s operations, so Xia ruofei had some free time.

At that moment, Liang Weimin called Xia ruofei and told him that the house’s renovation design plan was ready. There were three plans in total, and he asked Xia ruofei to go over and take a look when he had the time.

Xia ruofei immediately decided to go today. He also told Liang Weimin that he would meet him at the sales office of the Grand view of the world.

Since this house was for Hu Zi’s mother and Lin Qiao, the specific renovation plan still had to be decided by them, especially Lin Qiao.

This way, he could meet them directly at the sales office and take them to see the real estate.

After making an appointment with Liang Weimin, Xia ruofei went downstairs to look for Lin Qiao. He smiled and said,””Qiao’ er, didn’t I say I’d go with you to buy some design tutorials a few days ago? Let’s go now!”

“Alright!” Lin Qiao said,”brother ruofei, wait for me. I’ll leave after I change my clothes!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”where’s Auntie? Let her come along?”

“We’re buying books. What’s my mom doing there?” Lin Qiao asked in confusion.

“It’s boring to stay at home all day. Let Auntie go out for a walk!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Lin Qiao looked at Xia ruofei suspiciously. She felt that there was a conspiracy behind this. However, she still said,”Alright then! My mom should be in the room. Go talk to her!”

“Alright, then hurry up and change!”

Xia ruofei went to the guest room next door, knocked on the door, and went in to inform Hu Zi’s mother. At first, Hu Zi’s mother did not want to go, but she could not stand Xia ruofei’s persuasion and finally agreed.

Xia ruofei insisted on bringing Hu Zi’s mother along. The reason was simple. If Lin Qiao was alone, she would not dare to accept a house. Hu Zi’s mother had to be present.

As for how to convince Hu Zi’s mother, Xia ruofei had already thought of a way.

The three of them got into the car. Xia ruofei drove away from the farm and headed towards the Grand View Real Estate in the city.

After the car entered the city, Lin Qiao found that something was wrong. She said,””Brother ruofei, there’s a Xinhua Bookstore on gudong road. Why are you driving in the opposite direction?”

Xia ruofei stared at the road and said with a smile,””Let’s not go to the bookstore yet. I’ll take you somewhere?”

“What place is it?”

“You’ll know when we get there!”

“So annoying! Keeping us in suspense again!” Lin qiaojiao said angrily.

Soon, Xia ruofei drove the Knight XV SUV to the Daguan world sales office.

As usual, Liang Weimin attended the event in person, accompanied by three of the best interior designers from the interior design company under the jianda group. They had each brought their own carefully designed interior design plans.

“RUO Fei!” Liang Weimin greeted Xia ruofei with a smile.

“Uncle Liang, thank you for your hard work!” Xia ruofei said.

“Auntie, Qiao’ er, this is uncle Liang, the chairman of jianda Real Estate Group, Liang Weimin,” he introduced.”Uncle Liang, these are the people I told you about before. They’re my comrades ‘mother and sister.”

“I know!” Liang Weimin smiled and said,”Lin Qiao, right?”

“Hello, President Liang!” Lin Qiao took the initiative to greet Liang Weimin.

Then, she asked in a low voice,””Brother ruofei, why did you bring us here?”

Xia ruofei and Liang Weimin looked at each other and smiled. Then, Xia ruofei said,””Let’s go! Let’s go inside and talk!”

When they arrived at the sales office, everyone sat down on the soft and spacious sofas. Xia ruofei received three concept art designs from Liang Weimin.

He flipped through it and passed it to Lin Qiao, asking, “Qiao’ er, there are three designs here. If you were to renovate the house, which one would you like best?”
