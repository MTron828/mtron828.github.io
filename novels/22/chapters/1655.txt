Chapter 1656: Going to Australia together (1)

With a conflicted heart, Feng Jing picked up the phone,””Is there anything else, ruofei?”

“Haha, I forgot to remind you just now!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”remember to send me your flight number to Beijing. I’ll arrange for someone to pick you up. Stay in my courtyard house tonight!”

Feng Rao’s heart skipped a beat as she said in a panic,””I know ...”

“Alright, hurry up and book the tickets!” Xia ruofei said.

“Got it ...” Feng Jing prepared to hang up.

Unexpectedly, Xia ruofei suddenly said,””Wait!”

Feng Rao was shocked and couldn’t help but ask,”What is it now? Why are you so surprised today?”

Xia ruofei laughed in embarrassment and asked,””I suddenly forgot something. You don’t seem to have applied for a visa to Australia, right? Then I might not be able to leave tomorrow ...”

It was Xia ruofei’s first time going to Australia. He had applied for a three – year round trip visa, so he would not need to go to the Embassy again in three years.

It was only then that he remembered that if Feng Jing didn’t apply for a visa, even if they went to the consulate the next day, they wouldn’t have enough time.

“I applied for a three – year traveler’s visa two years ago, but it hasn’t expired yet!” Feng Rao said angrily.

Feng Rao thought to herself,”if there was a problem with the visa, I would have mentioned it earlier. Why would I wait for you to remind me?”

Xia ruofei heaved a sigh of relief and said,””Then there’s no problem! You should hurry up and arrange your work! Let’s meet tonight in Beijing!”

After Feng Jing hung up, she didn’t feel sleepy at all.

She gave up on her nap, got up, changed her clothes, and went to the office downstairs.

Feng Jing turned on her computer and sorted out some of the important work that she had recently done. She made a document and was prepared to emphasize it during the meeting later and appoint someone to take charge of it.

The moment she got to work in the afternoon, Feng Jing went to the meeting room and told everyone that she was going overseas. She also made arrangements for her work for the next few days.

Although everyone was surprised by Feng Jing’s sudden decision to go to Australia, they were relieved after she explained that she was going to Paradise Farm.

Even Xiao Qiang, pang Hao, and a few others wanted to go to Australia! After all, the company’s overseas business was so big, and as a senior executive, he had never been there before. It was a bit unreasonable!

This time, as the company’s CEO, Feng Jing was there. Who knew, the executives might have a chance next time!

Also, when Feng Jing announced that Dong Yun would be temporarily in charge of the company’s daily affairs while she was away, the other executives didn’t have any objections. However, the sales Director, Xiao Qiang, was a little uncomfortable.

After all, he had his eyes on the vice president’s position! Ever since Dong Yun had joined the company, he had always felt a sense of crisis.

However, Feng Jing’s prestige in the company was very high, so Xiao Qiang didn’t dare to raise any doubts about her decision.

Feng Jing quickly arranged her work and got off work early. She went upstairs to pack her luggage and told Liu Qian to book her a flight at around 5 p.m., Which meant that she had to leave at around 3:30 p.m.

The seasons in Australia were the exact opposite of China. It was currently summer, so Feng Jing didn’t need to bring too many thick clothes. She quickly finished packing.

......

At around eight in the evening, Feng Jing dragged her suitcase out of the terminal of Jing City International Airport.

“Sister Che!”

When Feng Rao heard this voice, her face lit up with joy. She quickly turned her head and saw Xia ruofei, who was not far from her left, walking towards her with a smile.

“Ruofei, didn’t you say that you’d send someone to pick us up? Why did you personally come over?” Feng Rao was a little surprised.

“I don’t have anything to do at home.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”since sister che is here, of course I have to welcome her personally. That’s the only way to show my sincerity!”

“You’re so talkative!” Feng Rao pouted.

At this moment, Wu Qiang, who was behind Xia ruofei, came forward to take Feng Jing’s luggage.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”sister ran, let me introduce you. This is Wu Qiang. He’s in charge of managing the siheyuan in the capital. He’s also my driver and bodyguard!”

Then, Xia ruofei turned to Wu Qiang and said,””Wu Qiang, this is Feng Jing, the CEO of our paradise Corporation!”

“Hello, chief Feng!” Wu Qiang quickly greeted.

Wu Qiang’s labor relationship was linked to the peach blossom company, so Feng Jing naturally knew him.

“Hello, Wu Qiang, thank you for your hard work ...” Feng Rao said with a smile.

“You’re welcome. This is my job!” Wu Qiang said in a tone that was neither haughty nor humble.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”let’s go!” Let’s talk in the car!”

The three of them walked to the parking lot not far away and got into the land Rover.

Xia ruofei and Feng Jing sat in the back seat. He smiled and asked,””Sister che, I didn’t eat on the plane, okay? Why don’t we find a place to eat first?” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“No need! No need!” Feng Rao said,”Air China’s in – Flight meals are pretty good! I’m quite full, and I can’t eat anything now!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said straightforwardly,”Wu Qiang, go home directly!”

“Okay, boss!” “Yes, sir!” Wu Qiang replied in a concise manner as he drove.

Feng Jing couldn’t help but sigh as she looked out of the car window at the passing street lights and the bustling night scene of the capital. Just a few hours ago, she was still in the quiet farm in the suburbs of Sanshan! They had already arrived in Beijing, and they were flying to Australia the next day ...
