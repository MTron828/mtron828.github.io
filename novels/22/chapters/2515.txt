2516 The power of the East continues to show its might (Part 2)

“The referee blew his whistle!” Jia Tianning said. And he even showed a yellow card! It was an obvious tactical foul! The other party had already extended his leg to trip Wu Lei while he was passing by. Otherwise, there would be a large open space in front of Wu Lei, so he could have picked up his speed!”

Shen fangjian said,”this was Wu Lei’s first touch of the ball. He gave everyone a beautiful tackle, followed by a very elegant man – ball pass. In the end, he even created a yellow card for the opponent. This series of performances can be said to be very eye – catching!”

“Yes!” Jia Tianning said. It could be seen that Wu Lei was very confident! I believe the manager on the sidelines, Ruby, must have seen it ...”

Shen fangjian said,”Piatti was sent to the hospital by an ambulance right after he left the field. His injury is probably not optimistic. Although it’s a little unkind to think this way, objectively speaking, Piatti’s injury did give Wu Lei an opportunity. With Wu Lei’s performance after he came on, I think Wu Lei is very likely to be in the starting lineup in the next game!”

“If Piatti had rested for a while, Wu Lei might have been able to sit firmly in the main position!” Jia Tianning said.

“But we still hope that Piatti is fine. After all, people who really love football don’t want to see any player get seriously hurt, even if the player is Wu Lei’s rival,” Shen fangjian said with a smile.

The two of them continued to talk. Although Shen fangjian, as a commentator, couldn’t speak too much, everyone could feel from his relaxed tone that piati’s injury had made Shen fangjian and Jia Tianning very happy. It was just that they couldn’t say it out loud.

The fans began to discuss one after another. They did not need to suppress their emotions and expressed their joy for Piatti’s injury.

“Did Ball King Wu have the help of the gods? Piatti’s injury was too timely!”

“The first game was a substitute, the second game was a main force, and then he scored a lot of goals! Ball King Wu is mighty!”

Some fans also felt that the two commentators were exaggerating.

“It was just an ordinary interception and breakthrough, and it was in their own half of the field. Even if they broke through, it wouldn’t be much of a threat. Shen fangjian and Jia Tianning can actually play such a trick. They are really drunk!” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

It just so happened that at this time, Jia Tianning said in the commentary that Wu Lei’s style was a bit like gregtman, which made some fans even more unbearable.

“This is so embarrassing! Could the two of them be a little more objective? Are you comparing Wu Lei to gregzman?”

“No. Extra, Wu Chui Tang is officially established today! Hall Master Shen fangjian! Vice Hall head Jia Tianning!”

“I beg the two Hall Masters, please show mercy! What if Ball King Wu goes back to look at the water dispenser again in the next game?”

……

The live broadcast room was filled with bullet comments, and the game was still going on. Soon, the first half of the game was coming to an end.

Other than that breakthrough, Wu Lei didn’t get any good opportunities. Maybe it was because they hadn’t gotten used to each other yet, so his teammates rarely passed the ball to Wu Lei. Sometimes, when Wu Lei ran out of an opening, his teammates couldn’t pass the ball in time. He remembered Shen fangjian and Jia Tianning sighing.

After listening to their commentary, they felt that it was a crime for the Spanish players not to feed Wu Lei the ball.

And a few times when his teammates passed the ball to Wu Lei’s feet, he did not hold the ball to attack, but directly transferred the ball with a kick, and then immediately turned around to run for an empty space.

However, at this time, the ball would not be sent back to Wu Lei and would start to develop on the other side, so Wu Lei returned to nothing again and again.

The first half of the game went into injury stoppage time, and Wu Lei finally got a good chance.

He received a straight ball from his teammate on the left side of the penalty area. This time, he finally did not move out with a kick. Instead, he took two steps and then changed direction to sweep into the penalty area.

The vallekano team’s Center back quickly leaned over, and Wu Lei’s left front, the opponent’s right back also leaned over to help with the defense.

Wu Lei was very calm when he took the ball. With a light poke, he passed the ball through the gap between the opponent’s right back and center back.

The opponent’s Center guard subconsciously stretched out his foot to intercept, but there was a deviation in his judgment of Wu Lei’s speed. As a result, he did not touch the ball, but it just scraped Wu Lei’s foot.

Wu Lei was tripped by his opponent and lost his balance. He fell forward and fell on the grass.

It was a foul in the penalty area.

A quick whistle sounded and the referee in a good position did not hesitate to point his finger at the penalty spot. He also showed a yellow card to the center back who had committed the foul.

A penalty kick! And it was a Yellow Point set!

The players of the valekano team quickly surrounded him to explain, and some even jumped into the water, indicating that Wu Lei had dived.

However, the referee was very determined. He motioned for the players to back off while walking into the penalty area, ignoring the pleas of the valekano player.

In PP sports’s live broadcast room, the two leaders of Wu Chui Tang, Shen fangjian and Jia Tianning, were in high spirits.

“A penalty! The referee is pointing at the penalty spot!” Shen fangjian said agitatedly,”the opposing players are still surrounding the referee. What else is there to explain? It was a very obvious foul, and it was right under the referee’s eyes. How could he have escaped punishment?”

“Wu Lei’s debut was perfect!” Jia Tianning said,”he’s only been on the field for a dozen minutes so far, but he’s managed to create a penalty kick and two yellow cards! Spain had really made a big profit by bringing in Wu Lei! He has attracted the huge Chinese market, and Wu Lei’s ability is definitely on point. In a small and medium – sized club like RCD Espanyol, he will definitely have no problem getting a main position!”

The netizens also started to discuss in the bullet screen. This time, there were a lot less sarcastic voices, and the screen was full of “Ball King Wu is mighty” comments.

Although Wu Lei did not have many opportunities to perform, he had deftly broken through the joint of the two players in the face of the opponent’s backline defense and successfully created a penalty kick and a yellow card. This series of performances could be said to be quite perfect. Even the most demanding fans could not ask for more from Wu Lei at this time.

The efforts of the valekano players were in vain, and the referee’s decision was very decisive.

The broadcast also quickly played the slow – Motion footage, which showed that the other side did not touch the ball. After the football passed, he stretched out his foot and tripped Wu Lei.

The referee asked both players out of the penalty area and then stood on the side to let the Spanish players take the penalty kick.

To everyone’s disappointment, the penalty kick was not initiated by Wu Lei, but by the number one penalty scorer, iglasias.

When the “Panda” iglasias walked to the penalty spot with the football in his arms, Wu Lei was already standing outside the penalty area, ready to rush up and make up the shot at any time.

However, iglasias did not give him a chance to make up for the shot. He was very stable in his penalty kick and instantly turned the score into a 2 – 2 score. The two teams were back at the same starting line.

After the penalty shot, iglasias even came over to touch Wu Lei’s head. The two men walked towards their own half with their arms around each other’s shoulders.

The fans at the scene were all excited. Many international students were waving Chinese flags and shouting Wu Lei’s name as they jumped.

Those who did not know better would have thought that it was Wu Lei who had just scored!

The first half of the game was over not long after the penalty shot.

In the second half, the two sides changed sides and fought again. Neither side was able to score again. After a dull second half, the RCD Spain and valekano shook hands and made peace, each getting a point.

The Chinese fans had all kinds of comments about the game, and the online media was not stingy with praise for Wu Lei’s performance.

Wu Lei did not care about the outside world. After he returned to the hotel, the first thing he did was to visit Xia ruofei and express his gratitude to’ miracle doctor Xia ‘.

Xia ruofei beckoned Wu Lei to sit down and asked with a smile,””Wu Lei, through this match, where do you think your weakest link is?”
