3124 The door to a new world (2)

“You’re still cultivating at such an old age?” Song Qiming exclaimed in surprise.

“It’s alright!” Xia ruofei said indifferently,”cultivators live longer than ordinary people. It’s normal for high – Level Qi refinement cultivators to live to 150 or 160 years old. 80 years old is equivalent to middle – aged! If you break through to the Golden core stage, you can live up to at least three hundred years. Relatively speaking, eighty years old is even younger!”

“Three hundred years old!” Song Qiming exclaimed in shock.

This was completely beyond his knowledge. Because in the secular world, a hundred – year – old man was already quite long and could be regarded as an “auspicious person.” If a Jindan stage cultivator could live up to three hundred years, then wouldn’t one hundred years be equivalent to an ordinary person in their early thirties?

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””This is just a conservative estimate. As one’s cultivation level increases, one’s lifespan will be even longer! That was why everyone in the cultivation world was desperately trying to improve their cultivation! The desire for longevity is also an important driving force for these cultivators to work hard in their cultivation!”

Song Qiming nodded. He understood Xia ruofei’s words.

Even he couldn’t help but feel moved after hearing it. Who wouldn’t want to live as long as their quality of life didn’t decline?

Xia ruofei continued,”let’s talk about the problem of cultivation resources. Some rogue cultivators with very little resources may have started cultivating at a very young age. However, at your age, their cultivation may only be at Level 3 or Level 4 of the Qi refinement realm.” And because you have the spiritual crystals and the spiritual tea this time, you have easily reached the level that they could only reach in decades in such a short time. Moreover, your future development space is much higher than theirs! Therefore, your age is definitely not a problem. You can rest assured about this!”

Song Qiming was shocked.

Although Xia ruofei’s tone was calm, he could feel the cruelty of the survival of the fittest in the world of cultivation. Some low – Level cultivators had to spend decades to reach his level of cultivation, but he was just as Xia ruofei said, he had achieved it easily.

Before today, song Qiming had treated the martial arts that Xia ruofei had taught him as a “Qi – nurturing technique”. To put it bluntly, it was a way to maintain his health. He would take some time out every day to practice. Sometimes, when he was busy with work, he might not be able to persist in practicing every day.

This time, it was the ‘spiritual tea’ that Xia ruofei had brought. He drank a cup of tea and entered that mysterious state. It only took him twenty to thirty minutes to reach his current cultivation.

It was really as simple as eating and drinking!

Song Qiming immediately felt the huge difference in cultivation resources.

At the same time, he also realized that even in the world of cultivation, the cultivation resources that Xia ruofei had were not something that most cultivators could have.

“I understand ...” Song Qiming nodded and said,”ruofei, you’ve opened the door to a new world for me!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it’s a coincidence!” Your accident last time was a blessing in disguise. If your body can’t cultivate, I won’t be able to help you even if I wanted to ...”

Song Qiming suddenly remembered that when he first practiced the “Qi – nurturing technique” and felt the obvious effect, he seemed to have asked Xia ruofei if he could teach this technique to his wife, Fang Liyun.

Song Qiming remembered that Xia ruofei had said that even if he taught her, Fang Liyun would not be able to learn it.

Back then, he had absolute trust in Xia ruofei, so he did not think about this matter anymore. He also did not teach Fang Liyun how to cultivate.

Now that he thought about it, he suddenly understood that Qianqian’s cultivation talent was a problem. It seemed like Fang Liyun’s physique was not suitable for cultivation.

At the thought of this, song Qiming could not help but feel dejected.

He and Fang Liyun had been husband and wife for twenty to thirty years, and their relationship had always been very good.

If Fang Liyun was unable to cultivate, then one day, Fang Liyun would die before him. He had heard from Xia ruofei that the lifespan of a meditational cultivator was about 150 years old. Fang Liyun was just an ordinary person. She would not be able to live that long.

Xia ruofei seemed to have read song Qiming’s mind. He smiled and said,””Uncle song, you don’t have to think too much about aunty Fang ... Her current physique is indeed not suitable for cultivation, but there might be more opportunities in the future, so it’s not impossible for her to change her physique. Moreover, even if she is unable to cultivate, I have the confidence to let her live as long as possible. At least a hundred years is not a problem! One must know that there were many spiritual herbs in the world of cultivation. For ordinary people, they were definitely miraculous elixirs that could prolong their lives! For example, the tea that you just drank can also prolong a normal person’s life. I’ve already asked Weiwei and Qingxue to send it over to aunt Fang. ”

When song Qiming heard that, he immediately looked grateful and said sincerely,””Ruofei, you’re so considerate ...”

As Xia ruofei had mentioned Song Wei and Ling Qingxue, song Qiming realized that there was an explanation for the weird expressions on Song Wei and Ling Qingxue’s faces. The answer was obvious.

Song Qiming’s eyes widened. He looked at Xia ruofei and asked,””Ruofei, did Wei Wei ...”

“Yes, I am!” Xia ruofei did not wait for song Qiming to finish his sentence. He nodded and said,”not only is Weiwei a cultivator, my girlfriend Qingxue is also a cultivator. I was the one who taught her the cultivation technique!”

Song Qiming felt a sense of relief when he heard that his wife, Fang Liyun, could not cultivate. He was still a little depressed when he found out that his daughter was now a cultivator like him. This meant that Song Wei could also live for at least 150 years. This was even more comforting than him and Fang Liyun being able to live to a hundred years old.

This was the feeling of licking one’s child from the bottom of one’s heart.

“Ruofei, it’s our family’s fortune to be acquainted with you!” Song Qiming exclaimed.

“Oh right, about Weiwei’s cultivation ...” Song Qiming continued.

Xia ruofei looked at song Qiming and smiled.””She has already reached refined Qi Level 5 and has also touched the bottleneck. She will soon break through to refined Qi Level 6!” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Song Qiming’s expression froze for a moment. Then, he laughed at himself and said,””So, as a father, I’m still inferior to my daughter? Hahaha! However, this was nothing. The new generation always surpassed the old! The more powerful Wei Wei is, the happier I am!”

Xia ruofei smiled and consoled her.”Actually, the difference is not that big. If you work hard, you might be able to surpass her.”

This was only a consolation. In reality, it was almost impossible for song Qiming to surpass Song Wei’s cultivation progress.

Song Qiming’s cultivation level was lower than Song Wei ‘s, and he was older. Since their cultivation talents were similar, it all depended on their cultivation resources and techniques.

Xia ruofei was willing to provide them with resources. In terms of cultivation techniques, the ‘if Heart Sutra’ was inferior to the ‘nichang Heart Sutra’.

Therefore, the gap between the two of them would only get bigger and bigger.

Unless song Qiming had a greater opportunity in the future. Song Qiming’s expression froze for a moment. Then, he laughed at himself and said,””So, as a father, I’m still inferior to my daughter?
