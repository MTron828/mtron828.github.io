Chapter 1641: One after another_1

Chen Dazhuang saw a pale face peeking out of the dark hole in the squat pit. After looking into Chen Dazhuang’s eyes, the face grinned at him, showing an extremely horrifying smile.

Chen Dazhuang’s hair stood up all of a sudden. He was stunned for two seconds before he let out a hysterical scream. He then pushed open the toilet door and fled.

However, Chen Dazhuang had forgotten that he had already pulled his pants down to his ankles. In addition, his legs had long gone soft after being shocked, so he took a step forward and fell directly to the ground.

Chen Dazhuang didn’t bother to wipe the blood from his injured lips. He desperately crawled away from the toilet, screaming as he crawled.

The workers upstairs quickly heard the commotion and ran out one after another.

As soon as the few women at the construction site came out, they saw Chen Dazhuang’s hairy legs and two white buttocks. They couldn’t help but cover their eyes.

However, there were still people who peeked through the gaps between their fingers, muttering in their hearts,”He didn’t expect that this silly big guy would be so dark, but his other side was quite white ...

The workers quickly ran downstairs and asked Chen Dazhuang what had happened.

Chen Dazhuang was so scared that he trembled all over. He couldn’t even speak properly. He pointed to the toilet weakly and said in a trembling voice,””G-g-there’s a ghost in the toilet ...”

Zheng Hua also heard the noise and rushed over. Seeing this, he couldn’t help but frown and said,””Da Zhuang, what nonsense are you spouting?” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“I ... I’m not talking nonsense ...” Chen Dazhuang stammered.”There really is a ghost in the toilet!” A pale woman’s face ...”

Zheng Hua didn’t believe it at all. He walked over and pushed open the door of the toilet. Chen Dazhuang screamed in fear and covered his eyes.

Zheng Hua looked around and said angrily,””What ghost? Dazhuang, don’t scare yourself!”

To be honest, Chen Dazhuang’s words made the workers a little nervous.

However, the more people there were, the more courageous they became. So, everyone also went over and looked around the toilet, but they didn’t find anything.

Chen Dazhuang was like an ostrich. He buried his head in his chest and refused to look up.

Zheng Hua frowned and said,”Dazhuang, put on your pants first!” Like what!”

Chen Dazhuang realized his embarrassment. He hurriedly pulled up his pants and said,””Uncle, I’m really not lying to you! In the toilet, I really saw ...”

“Enough!” Zheng Hua said sternly,”Dazhuang, if you continue to talk nonsense, you can leave this place!”

Zheng Hua had been working at construction sites for more than ten years, and he knew that such things could not be spoken carelessly. Once the news of the haunted land spread, the house might not be able to be sold in the future.

This was a big taboo for the boss.

Zheng Hua also wanted to scare Chen Dazhuang, but he didn’t expect Chen Dazhuang to immediately say,””Uncle, I don’t want to work here anymore, let me go! I ... I’ll leave now ...”

Zheng Hua couldn’t help but be stunned. He saw that Chen Dazhuang didn’t look like he was lying, but was really scared out of his wits.

Zheng Hua couldn’t help but look back at the toilet. Although there was still nothing in the toilet, he couldn’t help but feel a chill in his heart.

However, he quickly regained his senses and chided,””Nonsense! Where could they find a car to go back to? If you don’t want to work here anymore, I’ll send you off tomorrow morning!”

“But ...”

“Don’t say ‘but’ s!” Zheng Hua said,”there are so many of us living together, and the Yang Qi is so strong. What’s there to be afraid of?”

“Then ... Alright!” Chen Dazhuang said after he recovered,”uncle, I really don’t want to work here anymore. Help me find another construction site tomorrow!”

Ever since Chen Dazhuang entered the construction site, he felt uncomfortable. He didn’t think it was an illusion when he saw such a terrifying face in the toilet. It was too real. He didn’t want to stay in the construction site any longer.

Zheng Hua waved his hand impatiently and said,””Let’s talk about it tomorrow!”

Then, he said to the workers,”disperse!” Disperse! What was there to see? Hurry up and prepare for dinner!”

The workers also knew that this silly man was a relative of the foreman, so they didn’t say much. However, they couldn’t help but mock Chen Dazhuang for being so timid like a woman.

After dinner, the workers went back to their rooms to take a stroll in the wilderness. There was no wifi or any other entertainment, and they had heavy physical work to do the next day, so everyone went to bed early.

Chen Dazhuang was like a frosted eggplant. He had not said a word since dinner. After dinner, he quickly hid in his room.

The conditions at the construction site were simple. Everyone slept on the shared bed, but there was an advantage. There were many people, which gave Chen Dazhuang a sense of security.

Soon, there was the sound of snoring in the room, but Chen Dazhuang was not sleepy at all. When he closed his eyes, he could see the pale face and the creepy smile.

He hid under the blanket and didn’t dare to stick his head out, afraid that he would see that human face again from the window.

Chen Dazhuang stayed up all night. He was so anxious to pee that his bladder almost burst. He didn’t dare to get up until the sky was bright. He got up with everyone and rushed downstairs to solve the emergency problem.

Of course, Chen Dazhuang didn’t dare to go to the toilet again. He didn’t dare to run far. He didn’t care that there were women in the construction site. He went around to the back of the mobile house to release water.
