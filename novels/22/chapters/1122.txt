Song Rui rolled his eyes and reached out to hold Xia ruofei’s shoulder. Xia ruofei was so scared that he quickly shook off song Rui.

Xia ruofei said,”if you have something to say, say it. Don’t touch me!” If I didn’t know better, I would have thought that there was something wrong with your sexual orientation!” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Pei Pei Pei!” Song Rui said,”I’m very normal!”

Then, song Rui put on a smile and said,””Ruofei, do me another favor!”

“What’s the matter first?”Xia ruofei asked, his face alert.

“Zhuo Yiyi’s best friend is Song Wei. If Song Wei is willing to help, the success rate will increase greatly ...” Song Rui said cheekily.

“Stop!” Xia ruofei interrupted song Rui and said,”don’t look for me for this! Song Wei is your little niece! If you just say so, would she not help you?”

Song Rui smiled and said,”my words are not as effective as yours.” This girl will definitely listen to you! Besides ... In terms of seniority, I’m her uncle. How can I ask for this?”

Xia ruofei looked at song Rui and suddenly laughed.”So you’re saying that you want to be that and also want to build a good reputation?”

“Can’t you ... Say something nice?”song Rui said with a depressed look. Fine! As long as you help me with this, you can insult me however you want!”

Song Rui’s logic was rather strange. He and Xia ruofei were good friends. No matter how Xia ruofei mocked him, it was not embarrassing. However, if he went to see Song Wei personally, it would not be effective. The matter itself made him feel very embarrassed.

Xia ruofei shook his head helplessly and said,””Alright! I’ll help you ... But just this once! Don’t look for me for this matter in the future! I’ve never heard of a man asking for help from his own brother to chase a girl!”

“Alright, alright, alright!” Song Rui quickly nodded and said,”ruofei, just help me talk to Song Wei. I’ll take care of the rest myself!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei agreed readily.

After Xia ruofei finished speaking, he saw that song Rui was still looking at him. He couldn’t help but ask,””Do you still have anything else?”

“You ... Aren’t you helping me and Song Wei ...” Song Rui said.

Xia ruofei did not know whether to laugh or cry.”I said I’ll help you talk to Song Wei when we get back. Not now!”

Song Rui felt that he couldn’t wait any longer and said,””Just give her a call!”

“Song Rui, I made a call just for this. No matter how slow – witted Song Wei is, she’ll know that you’re behind it. What’s the difference between this and you looking for her directly?” Xia ruofei said. I’ll find an opportunity to mention it when I get back so that it won’t be too abrupt! This isn’t something that can be settled in a day or two, you don’t have to be in such a hurry!”

Song Rui thought about it and felt that Xia ruofei’s words made sense, so he said,””Alright ...”

With his emotional intelligence, he should have been able to understand such a simple truth. However, it was not only women who were less intelligent in the face of love, but men were also not that smart.

Xia ruofei shook his head helplessly when he saw song Rui’s awkward smile.

Song Rui thought for a while and said,”ruofei, when are you going back to the three mountains?” I see that you’ve finished your business in Beijing, so you should go back!”

Xia ruofei said on purpose,”brother Zhao said he wanted to buy me a drink!” And didn’t your old man ask you to accompany me to play in the capital for a few more days? There was no hurry to return to the three mountains! Anyway, my company is running well now, and I don’t need to keep an eye on it every day. ”

“You’re not in a hurry, but I am!”Song Rui replied. I’m still working at the southeast Branch! It’s impossible for me to stay in Beijing forever, and Zhuo Yiyi is working in Beijing, so I have to end this as soon as possible!”

“You really value your lover over your friends! “Okay, okay ...” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.”I’ll be back in a day or two at most!”

“Then hurry up and find Song Wei!” Song Rui was worried and reminded him again.

“If you continue to be so long – winded, do you believe I won’t wash my hands of this matter?” Xia ruofei said.

“No, no, no, I won’t say anymore ...” Song Rui waved his hands frantically.”Ruofei, since you’re not leaving today, I’ll call brother Zhao out and accompany you to tour the capital!”

“Alright! I’m not familiar with this place, so you can arrange it. ” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Song Rui smiled and said,”then ... Why don’t I take you to the Yanjing Museum?” It’s a modern comprehensive Museum, and there’s even a thousand treasures exhibition ...”

“Get lost!” Xia ruofei rudely interrupted song Rui and scolded him with a smile.”Are you playing with me or picking up girls?”

“Hehe, it doesn’t affect either of us ...” Song Rui smiled shamelessly.

“I’m not going!” Xia ruofei said,”if you want to go, go by yourself. I’m not going to be a third wheel!”

“Alright! “Fine, I won’t go ...” Song Rui said in a daze.”I’ll call brother Zhao first! Let’s see what’s the arrangement today. ”

Song Rui gave Zhao Yongjun a call. After a short conversation, song Rui hung up and turned to Xia ruofei.””Big brother Zhao said that he’ll arrange for you to go to summer Palace in the morning, and he’ll treat you to lunch in the afternoon!”

“I’m fine with anything!”Xia ruofei smiled.

“Then let’s go!” Song Rui said,”we will meet up with brother Zhao at Summer Palace!”

“I haven’t had breakfast yet!” Xia ruofei said.

“What’s there to eat in the hotel’s breakfast buffet?” Song Rui said,”we’ll treat you to authentic Beijing breakfast!”

After that, song Rui pulled Xia ruofei out of the room without saying anything.

They picked up the Phaeton from the hotel’s parking lot and drove Xia ruofei to Summer Palace.

After meeting up with Zhao Yongjun, the two of them brought Xia ruofei to have breakfast together.

It wasn’t a high – end hotel or club. It was just a simple roadside stall, but according to song Rui, it was the most authentic Beijing breakfast.

Fried liver, steamed buns, jerkies, soy milk ... These were all local snacks from the capital. The other food was fine, but Xia ruofei was not used to the taste of soy milk. He frowned after taking a sip.

Looking at song Rui and Zhao Yongjun drinking with relish, Xia ruofei really couldn’t understand how this sour, swill – like soy milk could be so delicious.

Song Rui and Zhao Yongjun also knew that most foreigners were not used to the taste of soy milk, so they did not make fun of Xia ruofei.

After breakfast, they lined up to buy tickets to Summer Palace.

Xia ruofei’s time was more relaxed. The three of them chatted and strolled in the garden.

The Royal Garden of the Qing Dynasty was built according to the design of Jiangnan gardens. It covered nearly 300 hectares and the scenery in the garden was excellent, especially the rippling blue waves in the lake of Kunming. From a distance, you could see groups of pavilions and buildings. The breeze wrinkled the surface of the lake and the branches of the weeping willows by the bank swayed slightly. It was a carefree scene.

The three of them strolled around for a while before Zhao Yongjun received a call.

After he answered the call, he walked over to Xia ruofei and said,””RUO Fei, I have a friend who wants to ask me to help look at some antiques. Are you interested in joining in? If you don’t want to go, I’ll decline this matter ...”

Zhao Yongjun’s main task today was to accompany Xia ruofei. Although he was itching to go over and take a look after receiving a call from his friend, he still followed Xia ruofei’s opinion.

“Brother Zhao has a good eye for antiques. Many people have been looking for him to take a look!” Song Rui said with a smile.

They’d had two drinks together, so Xia ruofei had some understanding of Zhao Yongjun. He knew that after a few years in the military, he didn’t become an outstanding officer as his father had hoped. After he retired, he started to dabble in antique calligraphy and painting. He had been in this line for more than ten years and had made a name for himself.

Especially in the circle of rich kids, Zhao Yongjun was already an expert in antiques. When people couldn’t make a decision, or when they thought they had received something good, they would ask him to go and take a look.

Zhao Yongjun was also obsessed with this line of work, so whenever someone told him there was something good, he couldn’t help but want to go and take a look.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”sure!” Since I don’t have much to do, I’ll go with brother Zhao to join in the fun!”

“Brother Zhao, where is your friend?” Song Rui also asked.

“Pan family garden!” Zhao Yongjun said happily,”it won’t be too far by car. Ruofei, song Rui, let’s go now!”

When Xia ruofei heard the words “pan homeland,” he was slightly moved ...
