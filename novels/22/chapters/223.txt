Xia ruofei returned to elder song’s room to check on his condition. When it was close to noon, he brewed another Chinese medicine and sent it over. According to song Zhengping’s arrangements, song zhenglin and Song Zhiping bade elder song farewell in the morning. One returned to Ludong, while the other returned to Beijing. The song family was very efficient. The report drafted by director Lu had been sent back to Beijing through an encrypted Telegram in the morning. With song Zhengping’s personal intervention, the response from Beijing was also very fast. The entire medical team that Liang Haitao was in charge of was called back urgently. Liang Haitao, who had been insufferably arrogant the day before, was covered in dirt as he led the entire medical team back to Beijing under the “escort” of a squad of soldiers. Originally, all they needed to do was to replace the doctor, but this matter was already politically involved, so the entire medical team, including the nursing staff and technical support staff, were all withdrawn. Because of his own headstrong personality, Liang Haitao would not only suffer a serious setback in his official career when he returned to the capital, but he would also have to bear the anger of his family. His future days would definitely not be good. However, Liang Haitao must have hated Xia ruofei because of this. One of the leaders in charge of the health Bureau personally called song Zhengping to express his sincere apologies. He also promised to strictly control the political situation and strictly select new medical team members according to the request of song Zhengping and his sister. The new Medical Group was set up quickly and would leave Beijing in the afternoon. They were expected to arrive in Hongzhou at night. Prior to this, the health Bureau had also coordinated with Jiangnan provincial People’s Hospital and sent several senior nurses to provide temporary support. These were all experienced head nurses from the provincial People’s Hospital and had rich nursing experience. The news of elder song’s recovery spread like wildfire, and many people in Beijing and Lu Dong felt like a storm was brewing. With the return of song zhenglin and Song Zhiping, a storm was brewing ... In the Western mountain area of Hongzhou. In the heavily guarded courtyard. Eccentric song had already woken up, but his body was still weak. As his daughter, song Zhilan had been serving elder song by the bed. The dose of Chinese medicine that Xia ruofei had given him was also personally fed to him by song Zhilan in a clay bowl. After elder song took the medicine, his physical condition improved and his mental state was much better than in the morning. However, Xia ruofei did not let song Zhengping and the others stay in the room for too long as elder song needed to rest. Even if he did not speak, it would still be very tiring to listen to song Zhengping and manager Lu’s reports. In the afternoon, Tian Huilan came to elder song’s room and said goodbye to him. As the Secretary of the provincial government of the provincial capital, Tian Huilan had a lot of work to do. She had already accumulated a lot of work after taking two days off. Now that she saw that elder song was gradually recovering, she felt a lot more at ease and naturally rushed back to the three mountains. Before she left, Tian Huilan specially looked for Xia ruofei to express her gratitude. In the evening, Xia ruofei finished brewing the fourth dose of Chinese medicine. Song Zhilan didn’t ask the head nurse to do it. She still fed elder song the medicine personally. Elder song’s mental state was already very good before he took the medicine. He even took the initiative to smile at Xia ruofei. It was a miracle in the medical world that almost one – third of the petal of the strange flower had helped elder song recover from his dying state to his current level. Not long after Xia ruofei returned to the doctor’s lounge, manager Lu knocked on the door and entered. “Doctor Xia, the chief wants to see you.” Manager Lu said. “Oh? Didn’t you tell him to rest?” Xia ruofei stood up and said in surprise. Manager Lu smiled bitterly.”After drinking the medicine in the evening, the old man’s mental state has improved a lot. He was just talking to provincial judge song for a long time, and now he wants to see you ... I can only follow the chief’s orders!” Xia ruofei smiled.”Alright, I’ll talk to him later. He’ll listen to the doctor, right?” “Yes, yes, yes, doctor Xia. The chief will definitely listen to you.” Manager Lu said. Xia ruofei and manager Lu walked into elder song’s room. The siblings, song Zhengping and song Zhilan, were also sitting by the bed, talking to the old man. Seeing Xia ruofei come in, Master Song smiled and waved at Xia ruofei,””Doctor Xia, come and sit ...” This legendary General’s voice was still rather weak, but one could still sense a wisp of the aura of an Iron Horse in his calm voice. This was a killing intent that had naturally developed over many years of life – and – Death battles, an aura that had been nurtured from being in a high position for many years. Song Zhengping and song Zhilan both stood up. Song Zhengping said respectfully,””Dad, we’ll go out first. You should rest early later.” Eccentric song nodded with a smile. Song Zhengping nodded at Xia ruofei and even patted his shoulder. Then, he left the room with song Zhilan. Manager Lu also left quietly and closed the door behind him. “Good day, chief!” Xia ruofei said as he stood at attention in front of the bed. Eccentric song had a kind smile on his face, and his muddy eyes seemed to have a strange look. He raised his hand and said,””Please have a seat, doctor Xia.” “Yes! Thank you, chief!” Xia ruofei sat down on the stool in front of the bed, his back straight. In front of this legendary general, Xia ruofei subconsciously put himself in the position of a soldier. Although the old man on the bed was like a candle in the wind, Xia ruofei still felt like he was looking up at a tall mountain. Elder song leaned on the bed and looked at Xia ruofei. He smiled and said,””Doctor Xia ...” “Chief, you can just call me Xiao Xia!” Xia ruofei quickly said. “Alright, I’ll call you little Xia then ... Little Xia!” Elder song chuckled. I really have to thank you this time. I thought I would have to go down and play the bridge Card with the old political commissar. I didn’t expect that my old bones would actually make it through again. It’s all thanks to your miraculous hand that can bring me back to life!” The old political commissar that elder song was talking about was a great man. He was the political commissar of the field army that elder song was in. After the founding of the country, he went through a few ups and downs and eventually became the core of China’s leadership. Among the ten hobbies of this great man, one of them was playing the bridge. A great man had passed away at the end of the last century, so elder song’s words were actually a funny expression. He was trying to say that he thought he couldn’t make it this time and was going to die. “Chief, you don’t have to be so polite!” Xia ruofei said,”you’re my idol! I’m very honored to be able to contribute to your health!” Elder song laughed heartily.”I almost forgot that you were once an excellent soldier. Now, you’ve become an excellent doctor. In this regard, you and I have a lot in common!” Elder song had once been an outstanding soldier, and after transferring to another place, he had also made a great career. Xia ruofei quickly said,”chief, I can’t be compared to you!” In the Army, you’re the general and I’m the soldier. When I go back to work, you’re the leader of the country. I’m just doing a small business ... To be honest, I’m not even qualified to practice Chinese medicine!” “There’s no need to belittle yourself, Xiao Xia. The old political commissar once said,”I’m sorry. “Regardless of whether it was a black cat or a white cat, a good cat was one that could catch mice! Practice is the only standard to test the truth. Your medical skills have already been tested by practice, so how can it be denied by a medical qualification certificate?” It could be seen that elder song also admired his old political commissar very much. He was able to speak some of the famous sayings of that great man. “But ...” Elder song changed the topic and said,”without this certificate, it’s easy for people to find fault with you. I’ve already asked Xiao Lu to get it done as soon as possible. I’ll get you the qualification certificate in two days. Then, you’ll be in charge of my treatment.”
