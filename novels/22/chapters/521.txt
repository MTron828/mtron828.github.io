Chapter 522: A deep sense of powerlessness (2)

Smith shrugged his shoulders and spread his hands.”Good luck!”

“Mr. Smith ...” He said.

Smith ignored Horton’s plea and quickly left the airport Hall. Horton almost fell to the ground as if his bones had been pulled out.

He stood in the lobby of the airport in a daze. The feeling of falling from the clouds to hell was too uncomfortable. When he thought about how he was about to face unemployment, court lawsuits, and a Super Lawyer like Lucas, he felt as if a mountain was pressing down on his heart.

It was like an ant standing in front of an elephant, feeling a deep sense of powerlessness.

In the past, he had always been the one who made things difficult for the Chinese. His sense of superiority in front of Chinese tourists had made him feel more and more superior. This time, he had finally kicked an iron plate.

If Houton was Chinese, he would definitely sigh in his heart. This was the cycle of the heavens and retribution!

When the Chinese girl and the old couple saw this, they were filled with joy.

Especially when the black – haired and yellow – skinned Tang He and Xia ruofei completely ignored Smith and turned around to leave, the Chinese people at the scene suddenly felt a sense of exaltation.

They ran out of the airport Hall at the same time. In addition to the Chinese girl and the old couple, there was also a young woman in her late twenties, Qianqian, who was the daughter of the old couple. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

The old couple had originally wanted to help their daughter take care of her confinement, but the application to go abroad had been delayed again and again. By the time they arrived, their grandson was already a month old.

Her daughter, who had just finished her confinement, also came to pick her up. She had just heard the Chinese girl’s story about what had happened at the customs inspection, and she was also filled with righteous indignation.

An extended Bentley that had been strictly modified was parked quietly by the side of the airport exit.

When Tang He and Xia ruofei walked to the car, the bodyguards had already opened the door in advance.

Just as the two of them were about to get into the car, a voice rang out from behind them.

“Gentlemen, please wait a moment!”

Tang He’s bodyguard immediately moved a few steps forward, ready to stop the uninvited guests.

When Jorgensen saw who it was, he immediately reported to Tang He.

Tang He smiled and said,””Don’t stop them. ”

The bodyguards immediately made way for him.

The Huaxia girl walked over quickly. She was still panting a little, and her pretty face was blushing.

Behind her, three other people were walking towards them. It was the old couple’s family.

The old man was not as strong as the young man, so he was left behind.

The Chinese lady came to Tang He and Xia ruofei and bowed.””Thank you for today!”

The Chinese girl didn’t know Tang He’s background, but their behavior today made her feel sincere respect.

In a foreign country where Chinese people were generally treated differently, this kind of support from their own kind was more able to move the hearts of these foreign travelers.

Tang He chuckled and said,”if you want to thank someone, thank little Xia!” My original intention was only to stand up for him ...”

The Chinese lady looked at Xia ruofei from head to toe and thanked him with a blush on her face.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you’re welcome. All the Chinese in the world are one family!” Overseas, we Chinese have to be United!”

“Well said, young man!”

The old couple had also walked over. It was the old man who had just spoken.

He walked in front of Xia ruofei and said,””When the Australian was making things difficult for you, we saw it from the back of the line. We were all very angry, but when it was our turn, he became even more aggressive ...”

“Elder brother, if you want to win others” respect, you have to have a bigger fist!” Tang He suddenly said with emotion,”today, our fists were bigger than theirs, so they gave in. However, if we want to change this situation, we need a strong country. Our country is the strongest backing for everyone!”

Tang He had been working hard in Chinatown since he was young and had earned a huge family business. He had tasted all the ups and downs, all kinds of discrimination and eye – Rolling, so he was particularly touched.

It was the same for Xia ruofei. He had once represented the Chinese military in an International Scout competition. At that time, the tall and strong Western Special Forces looked down on the Chinese military. However, Xia ruofei and his comrades had used their strength to teach them how to be good people. In the end, the Chinese military team that had won many gold medals had also received sincere respect from the participating teams of various countries.

Xia ruofei thought of this and smiled.””Mr. Tang, our national power is getting stronger and stronger. I believe that in the near future, the situation of the overseas Chinese will be greatly improved!”

Although China did not have the words “no matter where you are, the US government and Army will always support you” written on your passport like in the United States, China’s protection of the Chinese overseas was also very solid and step – by – Step.

In recent years, the evacuation of overseas Chinese nationals had also reflected the gradual growth of China’s overall National Strength. For the overseas Chinese, such an evacuation operation was undoubtedly like a shot in the arm.

After hearing Xia ruofei’s words, everyone nodded in agreement.

The old couple’s daughter also came forward and expressed her sincere gratitude to Xia ruofei and Tang He.

She had heard the story of her parents from the Chinese girl outside. After knowing what had happened to her parents, she was so heartbroken that she shed tears. The old woman had moved from place to place to take care of her and her child at such an old age. Not only had she been exhausted from the journey, but she had also been deliberately picked on and even insulted when she entered the country. As a daughter, she felt extremely guilty and sad.

Therefore, she was very grateful to Xia ruofei and Tang He.

Everyone had never lived in peace, but because they were from the same country, they naturally felt a sense of kinship in this foreign land.

They chatted for a while at the entrance of the airport before splitting up.

When they were bidding each other farewell, Xia ruofei smiled and said,””By the way, Mr. Tang and I have opened a farm in the Hunter Valley called Paradise Farm. You can go there for a vacation when you have time! This is manager Liang, the person in charge of Paradise Farm. You can just contact him when the time comes!”

The old couple’s daughter said happily,””That’s great! I’m planning to bring my parents to the Hunter Valley for a trip!”

The Hunter Valley was not far from Sydney and was a famous tourist attraction. It was not easy for the two elders to come to Australia, so she was prepared to take them on a trip.

Hearing this, Liang Qichao immediately gave each of them a name card and said,””Just find me at the Hunter Valley! We’ll take care of all the food, accommodation, and transportation ...”

After bidding farewell to their fellow countrymen, Xia ruofei and the rest got into the car and left Sydney’s Kingsford Smith Airport.

The Hunter Valley was located about 160 kilometers north of Sydney. It was the largest Valley in New South Wales and was a famous tourist spot in Australia. It was also the most historical grape – producing area in Australia.

There were more than 120 wineries and all kinds of exquisite resort hotels in the Hunter Valley area. It was only a two – hour drive from the central city of Sydney, which made the Hunter Valley an endless stream of tourists all year round.

The extended Bentley quickly drove away from downtown Sydney and onto the highway.

There were many private cars on the way to the Hunter Valley, but they could not pick up their speed. However, the blue sky and the vast grassland outside the car window made them feel relaxed and happy. It did not matter if they were slow on such a journey.

In all fairness, even though he had encountered many unpleasant things when he entered the country, the environment of Australia had left a very good impression on Xia ruofei.

Sydney’s Blue sky and natural scenery along the way was a rare experience for Xia ruofei, who was used to traffic jams and haze in China.

He even saw little koalas quickly crossing the highway, and as the car got closer to the Hunter Valley, kangaroos could be seen everywhere.

They weren’t afraid of people at all. When the car drove past them, they would look at the black metal guy with curious eyes. Then, they slowly stood up on their hind legs and jumped away from the roadside with their strong hind legs.

More than two hours later, the extended Bentley finally arrived at its destination.

Looking at the English sign ‘Paradise Farm’ hanging at the entrance of the farm, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel a little excited.

This is my first overseas business!
