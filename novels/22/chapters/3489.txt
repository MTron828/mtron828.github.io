Ling Qingxue happily stood guard at the side. Xia ruofei also split some of his spiritual power to observe the flying state of the black Phoenix flying ship while keeping an eye on Song Wei.

Xia ruofei’s spiritual power had already reached the spiritualization realm, so he could easily sense Song Wei’s current state.

As the Topaz essence was absorbed, Song Wei’s spiritual power was also rising at a rapid pace.

The black – armored flying ship flew through the night sky at high speed, and below it was the boundless ocean. It was quiet in the cabin of the airboat. Song Wei was completely immersed in the pleasure of her soaring spiritual power. Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue did not say anything and just watched over Song Wei quietly.

When the black Phoenix flying ship neared the waters of Paradise Island, Song Wei had finally finished absorbing the last piece of Topaz essence.

She let out a long breath before slowly opening her eyes.

Song Wei’s eyes lit up and her face revealed a look of disbelief. She said,””RUO Fei, Qingxue, my… My spiritual power has increased so much …”

“What’s the level of your spiritual power now?”Ling Qingxue asked with a smile.

“I… I can’t be sure, but I’m sure he’s broken through a major realm.” Song Wei was still in a daze.

From Ling Qingxue’s previous introduction, she knew that the yellow jade essence was very beneficial for the improvement of one’s spiritual power, but she did not expect it to be so magical.

It was very difficult to improve one’s spirit power. Without a top cultivation technique that could improve one’s spirit power at the same time, many cultivators ‘spirit power realm would fall behind their cultivation. It was already very impressive to be able to synchronize with their cultivation.

Generally speaking, if a cultivator’s spiritual power realm could surpass their cultivation realm, then they were very talented and their cultivation speed would definitely be very fast.

Song Wei had never experienced the spiritual power of the Spirit gathering stage, so she could only be sure that she had broken through a major realm. However, she really did not have an intuitive judgment of the exact level of her spiritual power.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I’ve been paying attention to Weiwei’s condition!” Your spiritual power has already reached the intermediate stage of the spirit gathering realm, which is similar to Qingxue’s!”

“Spirit gathering stage … Intermediate stage!” Song Wei gasped,”that’s equivalent to the mental power of an intermediate stage golden core cultivator?”

Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue both smiled and nodded.

Song Wei’s face was filled with disbelief as she said,””How can it improve so much? Qingxue just said that the yellow jade essence has a great effect on improving one’s spiritual power. He even said that his spiritual power has also improved by leaps and bounds. I thought that it would only be a small breakthrough at most… This … This is a huge breakthrough …”

The improvement in her mentality was obvious to Song Wei. Her senses had become sharper in all aspects. The biggest change was that her brain had become more sensitive. In the words of the secular world, it meant that her brain development had greatly improved.

In this state, whether it was cultivation or fighting with others, he would definitely have a great advantage over cultivators of the same level.

“Weiwei, do you know how much we’ve gained from the trial Pagoda?” Ling Qingxue asked with a smile.

Song Wei nodded and said,”you just said that there’s still a lot of this yellow jade essence in the trial Pagoda, but you can’t bring it out?” This secret plane must be of a very high level!”

Ling Qingxue giggled and said,”of course, there are a lot of yellow jade essence. However, there is a time limit on that floor. RUO Fei and 1 happen to have a way to quickly find the yellow jade essence. It is impossible for an ordinary cultivator to obtain so many yellow jade essence.”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Weiwei, you’ve just absorbed the energy of the Topaz essence. You can use your spiritual power more to adapt to your current state. Or you can sit down and cultivate to feel the difference before and after the improvement of your spiritual power.”

“Yes, yes, yes!” Ling Qingxue said,”when we reach Paradise Island, we have even better things for you! You should first get used to your spiritual power realm!”

Song Wei’s eyes were red as she said,”RUO Fei, Qingxue, thank you!”

Ling Qingxue rolled her eyes at Song Wei and said,”Wei Wei, I’m going to get angry if you keep saying such things! What is our relationship! Is there a need to thank me?”

“It’s my fault…” Song Wei smiled and said,”then I won’t be polite with you guys. I’ll cultivate for a while …”

Song Wei could feel that her current state was very different from before. Even if she were to cultivate normally, her efficiency would definitely be much higher than before. Therefore, she could not wait to experience the specific changes.

“En!” Xia ruofei nodded and said,”Qingxue, protect Weiwei! I’ll be in charge of controlling the flying boat. We’ll be arriving at the Peach Blossom Island soon. H

At this moment, the black Phoenix flying ship was already approaching the waters of the Paradise Island. It was still about three to four hundred nautical miles away from the island.

Xia ruofei checked his handheld GPS and adjusted the course slightly. He then released his mental strength to check the surroundings. The closer they got to Peach Blossom Island, the more cautious Xia ruofei became. Although the possibility of being followed was very small, to Xia ruofei, Peach Blossom Island was a strategic location second only to the spirit map space. He could not be too careful.

When they were about a hundred nautical miles away from the Peach Blossom Island, Xia ruofei controlled the black Phoenix flying boat to make a few turns and make a few feints. After a few rounds, they flew straight towards the Peach Blossom Island from another direction.

A few minutes later, the black Phoenix flying ship had already neared the outer perimeter of the Taixu xuanqing formation.

Xia ruofei released his spiritual power and connected to the core control of the formation.

The Taixu xuanqing formation was currently in a normal state of alert and had not been fully activated. However, if someone came close or barged in, the formation would react in an instant, warning the controller and activating most of the defense functions.

It could be said that this state was a relatively safe daily state, and the consumption was also the smallest.

Xia ruofei’s understanding of the Taixu xuanqing formation was much deeper than Li Yifu and the others. He had set up this formation himself and knew every detail like the back of his hand. Hence, even if he was outside the formation, he could still easily control the formation and make way for them.

The black Phoenix flying ship didn’t slow down at all as it flew straight through the gap in the array formation.

After the black Phoenix flying ship flew past, the crack in the formation quickly closed and the formation returned to its usual state of alert.

Xia ruofei maneuvered the black Phoenix flying ship nimbly through the array and flew above the skyscraper.

At this moment, Xia ruofei’s spiritual power had almost covered the entire Paradise Island. Everything that happened on the island was instantly fed back to his mind.

The camp of the guards was in good order, and the open and secret sentries distributed by the sea each had their own duties, vigilantly guarding against foreign enemies. Due to the time difference, it was currently afternoon on Peach Blossom Island. The ordinary staff of the airport, control tower, meteorological station, and other places were all working at their respective posts. Because the black Phoenix flying ship had its own concealment array, ordinary people had no way of discovering this huge flying ship.

Li Yifu was still on Peach Blossom Island. After helping Xia ruofei with the spaceship and spacesuits, he had returned to the island immediately. Now, he was permanently stationed on Peach Blossom Island. After all, he was already old. Only by cultivating in such a superior cultivation environment could he have a breakthrough before the end of his life and increase his lifespan.

To Xia ruofei’s surprise, the sect master of the star Seizer sect, Luo Qingfeng, was also on the Peach Blossom Island.

Luo Qingfeng was the first to notice the abnormality. As soon as the black Phoenix flying ship entered the array formation’s range, he, who had been cultivating, suddenly opened his eyes and revealed a vigilant look.

But soon, he heard Xia ruofei’s voice,””Qingfeng, don’t be impatient. It’s me!” “Master!” Luo Qingfeng was overjoyed.

“You and your adopted husband can both stay on the roof of the building! Don’t alert the others!” Xia ruofei said indifferently..
