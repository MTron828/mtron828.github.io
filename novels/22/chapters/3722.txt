Ling Qingxue was the first to jump down from the hole. Xia ruofei immediately held her in his arms, followed by Song Wei. Xia ruofei easily held his two close female friends in his arms. He stepped on the blue travel immortal sword and the three of them were suspended in the corridor full of eerie sculptures. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Song Wei looked at the statues and the scene from when she entered the tomb of Mount Yu appeared in her mind. She said with fear,””Ruofei, be careful. We circled here for a long time and couldn’t get out… There were also traps and hidden weapons…”

Xia ruofei smiled and said, “”That was in the past, but I’m no longer the little cultivator I was back then. In terms of array Dao, I’m much stronger than I was back then.”

Xia ruofei then pointed to a spot in the corridor and said,””At that time, I had indeed just come into contact with array Dao and was confused by this kind of trap and kill array! Now, he could basically see the flaws of the array with a glance. Even if it can’t be easily broken, it’s still relatively easy!”

Then, Xia ruofei took out a spiritual stone from the spirit map space and handed it to Song Wei. He smiled and said,””Did you see the tile I pointed at just now? Can you inject true Qi into it and directly hit the spirit stone in the center of the floor tile?”

“I’ll try!” Song Wei said after some hesitation.

“If… I accidentally miss, will there be any serious consequences?” she asked.

Back at the ancient tomb on Mount Yu, she was the one who let her guard down and ran straight for the rope that was hanging down. In the end, she stepped on a tile and triggered the array. If Xia ruofei had not reacted in time, she would have been shot to death by the arrows.

That was why she was already traumatized.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”don’t be afraid. I’m here.” Don’t worry, just do it. It doesn’t matter even if you’re wrong!”

“Alright!” Song Wei said after taking a deep breath.

She held the spiritual stone tightly in her hand and looked deeply at the tile that Xia ruofei had pointed out. After aiming, she poured her genuine Qi into the spiritual stone and threw it out.

To a cultivator’s eyes, this was a child’s play. The main reason was that Song Wei had a psychological trauma, so she was very careful.

Song Wei was so careful that the spiritual stone could not miss. The spiritual stone hit the floor tile accurately. The spiritual stone was infused with true energy and moved very fast. It made a whistling sound as it touched the floor tile. It quickly shattered. Song Wei had used all her strength. If the spiritual stone hit a human body, it would definitely leave two holes.

After the spirit stone shattered, a wave of energy spread out.

The floor tiles looked completely undamaged, and the material was definitely of good quality.

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue stared at the corridor in front of them, but they could not see any changes.

However, in Xia ruofei’s eyes, the entire trap & kill array had already been broken.

This floor tile was not the main array eye of the entire trap & kill array, but it was a weak link that was not very obvious. If it was the Xia ruofei of the past, he might not have been able to find it even after studying it for a long time. However, he had inherited so many array Dao inheritances and had gone through a lot of practice. His eyesight was no longer the same as before. He found it almost at a glance.
