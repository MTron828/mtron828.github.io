Since the big boss had personally given the order, Xue Jinshan naturally carried it out with great efficiency. In the afternoon of the same day, he made arrangements to stop one of the jaded skin cream production lines. Then, he organized people to thoroughly clean the production line in preparation for the trial production on the next day.

In fact, from an economic point of view, the best choice was to stop the production line of the heart – nourishing soup. After all, the price of the jaded skin cream was so high, and the heart – nourishing soup was a semi – Charity project in the country. In order to allow more patients to afford the medicine, the profits had been reduced to a very low level.

However, Xia ruofei had specifically instructed that the production of the heart – nourishing soup must not be stopped.

The heart – nourishing soup was still in short supply in the domestic market. Many people with autism were waiting to use it. Xia ruofei knew this very well. He would rather the company make less money and sacrifice some short – term benefits than see the production of the heart – nourishing soup decrease.

The next day, Xia ruofei personally came to Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory.

Xue Jinshan had already purchased the required medicinal herbs according to Xia ruofei’s request yesterday and had made the preliminary preparations.

Xia ruofei personally replaced the control program of the production line with the new program he had written yesterday morning and then pressed the start button.

The highly automated production line immediately began to run, and the herbs that were well – matched in proportion were put in through the feeding port.

The production team followed Xia ruofei’s design strictly. After more than an hour, the first batch of medicine was produced.

The medicine was automatically sealed in a transparent, environmentally friendly Chinese medicine bag, 500 ml each.

Xia ruofei randomly picked one and tore a small hole in the package. He took a light sip and closed his eyes.

Although the medicine was produced for the goose, Xia ruofei did not have any psychological barriers because he knew that it was pure Chinese medicine. It was effective for humans too, but it might cause a weak body and not lead to a serious fatty liver.

Unless he drank it like water every day, drinking ten to twenty bags a day. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Xia ruofei did not intend to conduct a more detailed test on the medicine as it did not need to be so precise. Besides, with his current strength, even if he tasted it with his mouth, he would be almost certain. This was enough for the breeding of the Strasburg goose.

The reason for the first small – scale experimental production was mainly to prevent obvious process errors that would cause changes in the composition of the medicine.

It turned out that Xia ruofei’s design was very rigorous. The produced medicine was basically the same as the one he made by hand.

Xia ruofei randomly took a few more bags of medicine and checked them carefully. Finally, he was relieved.

He clapped his hands and said,”alright!” There was no problem with the control program! Kanayama, let everyone rest for ten minutes, then we’ll start production. Once we’ve used up all the raw materials, the jaded skin cream production line will be able to resume production. ”

“Yes, Chairman!” Xue Jinshan quickly said.

Xia ruofei had estimated that the raw materials prepared by Xue Jinshan could produce about a thousand bags of medicine. This amount was enough to last the six Strasburg geese for two months.

As for the storage of these drugs, there was a very advanced cold storage on the farm. After the production factory produced them, they could be directly transported to the cold storage for storage. It was very convenient to take and use them when feeding.

After Xia ruofei explained the follow – up production and transportation matters to Xue Jinshan, he left the pharmaceutical factory.

When he drove back to Taoyuan farm, Cao tieshu was busy at the small hill near the orchard. A plot of land had been marked out for the breeding of the six Strasburg geese.

It was only a temporary place for raising six geese, so it was not troublesome to set up.

The main thing was to dig a pond here as the activity place of the Strasburg geese.

Cao tieshu directly coordinated a small excavator from the nearby farm expansion site and dug out the pond in no time. He also specially dug a small water channel from the small river next to the pond to ensure that the water in the pond was running and would not turn into stinky puddles.

Xia ruofei walked over and saw Cao tieshu directing the workers to clear the weeds in the field. On the other side, there were a few Masons laying bricks and applying cement for the small water channel. There was also a master who was in charge of building the goose House with bamboo. Everyone had their own duties and were busy.

Seeing that Xia ruofei was approaching, Cao tieshu hurriedly went up to him and greeted him,””Chairman!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””Big brother Cao, you’re progressing very quickly!”

“The work here is very simple, and we even have the help of excavators. It’s done in a few moments!” Cao tieshu laughed.

“En!” Xia ruofei asked,”how long more before it can be put into use?”

Cao tieshu said,”now, the pond has been dug. The cement for the water channel will be done today. It may take a few days to dry.” The rest of the work can definitely be done in the next two days. The goose House will be built today, and the field will be cleared. Then, we can transplant some grass that the goose will eat by the pond, and then tie the fence. Everything will be done!”

Xia ruofei said,”aren’t you guys going to take turns to keep watch?” How do we do it if we don’t have a place to sleep?”

“It’s fine. We just need to find a place to shelter from the wind and set up a military bed and a thick coat!”Cao tieshu said with a smile.
