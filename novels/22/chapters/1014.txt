“Mr. Tang,” Xia ruofei said with a smile,”the production of these tea leaves is not high. I don’t plan to sell them ...”

“I see ...” Tang He said with some regret, and then looked at the tea leaves in the purple clay teapot.

Xia ruofei continued,””This tea is for you and your friends, so I’m only giving it away! It’s rare that you like it so much. I still have some in stock, you can bring it back to drink!”

With that, Xia ruofei took out a box that he had prepared earlier from his bag. There was about half a catty of top – Quality Da Hong Pao in it.

Now that the Da Hong Pao tea trees in the interspace had been planted with a larger area, and Xia Qing’s Da Hong Pao tea making skills were also very good, Xia ruofei’s current stock of tea leaves had also increased. He could always have a few catties in the interspace.

Of course, although these tea leaves were produced from the third generation “descendants” of the mother tree, the unique environment of the space meant that the quality of the tea leaves produced was actually not inferior to that of the mother tree’s Da Hong Pao tea leaves. In fact, they were even slightly better.

If he were to sell it, every gram of Xia ruofei’s tea leaves would be extremely precious in the eyes of those who truly understood tea. He had given away about 250 grams at one go. It was definitely a big deal.

Tang He was also surprised and happy. He happily took the box containing the tea leaves and immediately opened it. Then, he carefully opened the sealed bag and took a deep breath.

The dried tea leaves had a refreshing fragrance that made Tang He reminisce.

Then, Tang He said with some embarrassment,””Ruofei, this gift of yours is too expensive. Tea leaves of this grade can’t be sold on the market, but if you were to sell them, I’m afraid they could be sold for millions! Why don’t ... I buy it from you!”

Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand,”it’s not worth that much!” Besides, I’m not planning to sell these tea leaves for the time being. If you’re willing to pay, then I won’t be giving them to you!”

Although 20 grams of the parent tree Da Hong Pao tea leaves had once been sold for a sky – High price of 198000 Yuan, which was equivalent to more than 4 million Yuan per 500 grams, this was an auction! Moreover, there were many gimmicks. Just the thick history and various allusions of the mother tree Da Hong Pao, as well as the last time it was picked at an auction, were enough to raise the price beyond imagination.

If Xia ruofei were to sell the tea leaves in bulk, even if the quality of the tea leaves was comparable to the Da Hong Pao tea leaves that were auctioned previously, the price would not be so high.

Of course, Xia ruofei had no intention of making a profit from the tea leaves.

Furthermore, although this tea leaf was comparable to the mother tree, Da Hong Pao, it wasn’t that precious to Xia ruofei. One had to know that the mother tree, Da Hong Pao, was a tea tree that could be harvested at the Archean realm. In the outside world, one could harvest tea leaves once every ten days on average. If Xia ruofei wanted these tea leaves, it would be relatively easy.

“Alright, alright, alright. I won’t stand on ceremony with you then!” Tang He said.

Xia ruofei smiled.”Mr. Tang, you’ve helped me a lot. This is a small token of my appreciation.” The production of these tea leaves is not high, so please don’t think that I’m stingy. I’ll save more for you next year when we have new tea leaves!”

Xia ruofei definitely had to say this to Tang He. The more difficult it was to get the tea leaves, the more precious they were. Otherwise, if you gave them away, they might not even accept your favor. Wouldn’t that be a thankless effort?

“Okay, okay, okay, then I’ll thank you in advance!” Tang He was so happy that he could not close his mouth.

Xia ruofei and Tang He chatted while making tea. After a while, the middle – aged man in the Tang suit, ah – Zhong, came to Tang He’s side with an excited expression. He bowed slightly and said,””Young master Tang, I’ve already taken a good look!”

“Oh?” Tang He raised his eyebrows and asked. The material isn’t bad, right?”

Ah – Zhong suppressed his excitement and said,””It’s not bad. Master Tang, do you want to ... Talk to me in private?”

Ah – Zhong even shot a quick glance at Xia ruofei.

Tang He knew what ah – Zhong was thinking. He said lightly,””We’ll talk here. RUO Fei is not an outsider, so this material should have its value. There is nothing to hide!”

Ah – Zhong did want to avoid Xia ruofei and talk to Tang He about the two pieces of golden Nannan material. He was worried that Xia ruofei would demand an exorbitant price after hearing it because the two pieces of material were too good.

But to Tang He, the money for buying the Phoebe zhennan wood was nothing. What he valued more was his friendship with Xia ruofei. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

In his opinion, it was not easy for Xia ruofei to find the wood for him. No matter how much the wood was worth, Xia ruofei deserved it.

Furthermore, Xia ruofei had given him a box of top – grade Dahongpao tea leaves. This was a huge favor!

Ah-Zhong’s face reddened and he quickly said,””Yes, Master Tang!”

Then, he took a deep breath and stopped suppressing his excitement. He said,””Master Tang, these two pieces of gold threaded nanmu are of the highest quality. Nowadays, it’s very difficult to find such a large piece of gold threaded nanmu, but this time, two of them appeared at once! What’s even rarer is that the ratio of the cores of these two pieces of material is very high. The diameter of the material is about 1.1 m, and 1.02 m is the core. This is almost the limit of perfection!”

Tang He could not help but be slightly moved after hearing this. He put down his teacup and stood up, saying,””Let’s go and take a look together!”
