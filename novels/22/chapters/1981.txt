1982 Cleaning up inventory (2)

“Yes! Disciple will definitely work hard in cultivation and strive to have the ability to share martial granduncle’s worries one day!” Li Yifu said with some shame.

He felt that his cultivation level was too low and he couldn’t help Xia ruofei much. Besides, their talents were so different that the gap between them would only get bigger in the future. He really couldn’t help Xia ruofei.

As for worldly wealth, Li Yifu had always felt that the reason his grand uncle – Master started a company was more to cultivate in the secular world. His wealth of tens of billions was not worth mentioning at all in front of his grand uncle – Master.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”go!” If I haven’t left Hong Kong in a few days, I’ll answer your questions again. ”

“Thank you, senior granduncle!” Li Yifu said,”then, this disciple will take his leave first!”

After Li Yifu left, Xia ruofei looked up at the clock in the living room. It was almost midnight.

A few hours had passed unknowingly during the lecture and Xia ruofei was not aware of it.

He also felt a little tired, so he went to the bathroom to take another shower, then went back to the master bedroom and went to bed.

……

The next day, Xia ruofei brought Huanhuan to the Ocean Park in Hong Kong.

It was another busy day. Huanhuan had an extremely happy weekend, while Xia ruofei was exhausted. He realized that taking the brat out to play was even more tiring than explaining cultivation to Li Yifu. It was really not a job for humans.

However, every time Huanhuan called him “big brother” with her soft and cute voice, he felt all the fatigue in his body disappear. It could be said that he was tired but happy at the same time.

After sending Huanhuan home, Xia ruofei returned to the hotel. The sky had already turned dark. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

He decided to take care of the truffles and then prepare to return to the company. Everyone was busy, and he felt bad to be out alone. In addition, the young goose that old Blake had contacted for him had been completed. It would be air – flown to Sanshan airport in two days, and he had to go back in time to receive it.

After Xia ruofei returned to his room, he called old Blake and Bastian to tell them that the truffles had been shipped to Hong Kong and could be traded tomorrow.

Xia ruofei had arranged for them to meet at 9 am and 11 am respectively.

The two of them were naturally overjoyed when they heard the news. They quickly expressed that they would prepare the funds in advance and come to trade on time.

Then, Xia ruofei gave Captain Liu An a call and asked him to apply for a flight route back to Sanshan the next afternoon.

After contacting them, Xia ruofei took out all the truffles he had collected this year from his storage space.

There was a refrigerator in the Presidential Suite. Xia ruofei divided the truffles into two parts, put them in a box, and placed them in the refrigerator.

About 25 kilograms of truffles were given to Bastian, and the remaining 70 kilograms were left for old Blake.

The quality of these truffles was almost the same as the ones that appeared in the auction, but they were lighter. He believed that Bastian and old Blake would be satisfied.

Of course, it was relatively light. Compared to the potato – sized truffles sold in the market, this batch of truffles was considered “big.” The heaviest ones weighed more than a thousand grams, so the price would definitely be much higher than the ordinary truffles.

After Xia ruofei packed the truffles, he took a shower and took out a spiritual crystal to cultivate for a while before going to bed.

The next morning, Xia ruofei finished his breakfast in the Presidential Suite and rested for a while. Bastian then brought Cheng Xiaoxiao to the Presidential Suite. At this time, the clock on the wall had just passed nineo’ clock. They had arrived on time.

After some small talk, Xia ruofei walked into the room where the cold cabinet was and took out the box that he had prepared in advance.

“Mr. Bastian, there’s a total of 25 kilograms of truffles in here. 18 kilograms of white truffles and 7 kilograms of black truffles.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”take a look and see if you’re satisfied with the quality!”

Bastian said in surprise,”great!” Mr. Xia, I’m so grateful to you!”

Xia ruofei had only promised him that it would not be less than 10 kilograms, but in the end, it was more than double the guaranteed weight. This was already a surprise for him. As for the quality of the truffle, Bastian was not worried at all. With the reputation of the Paradise company, it would not be an exaggeration to say that the Paradise company was the most popular company in Hong Kong.

Who didn’t know that the products of the Paradise Corporation were a symbol of quality?

He had sold it for 100 million US dollars at the auction. How could Xia ruofei ruin his own reputation for such a small amount of money?

But Bastian, who was full of anticipation, quickly opened the box. He saw the huge truffles in the box. The weight of a single truffle was far beyond his imagination, and after a little closer, the unique and complex fragrance of truffles immediately assailed his nose. The quality of this batch of truffles was obviously much higher than the ordinary truffles on the market.

Bastian said excitedly,”Mr. Xia, the quality of this batch of truffles is far beyond my imagination!” You’re such a generous gentleman! Truffles like this can be sold in small auctions!”

Cheng Xiaoxiao also said gratefully,””Thank you, President Xia!”

Xia ruofei laughed.”You’re welcome. You’re helping me with my business!”
