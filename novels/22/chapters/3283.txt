Xia ruofei had a strange look on his face. From afar, he had seen that this mini – town was dead silent without any signs of life. However, the moment he stepped on the road of the town, it was as if he had pressed the play button and the whole town suddenly came to life.

This was naturally very sudden.

Besides, Xia ruofei observed as he walked. He soon realized that the town was bustling with people and the stalls on both sides of the street were in a mess. This was what most small towns were like. However, Xia ruofei could still feel that there was an invisible order in the town.

The townspeople and street vendors, regardless of whether they were white – haired old men or yellow – haired children, seemed to have planned their every move. There was a precise order in the chaos.

As such, Xia ruofei felt that his appearance in this mini town was very sudden. It was as if he had thrown a bomb into a pool of stagnant water. The balance of the mini town seemed to have been destroyed.

Of course, this was entirely Xia ruofei’s personal feeling. However, his intuition had always been very accurate.

Xia ruofei did not interact with the townspeople. He just followed the little Daoist through the street and observed quietly.

The street wasn’t very long, and it didn’t take long for them to cross from one end to the other, leaving the mini – town.

After observing for a while, Xia ruofei had determined that the residents of the small town were not real people. They were man – made puppets, just like the little Daoist in front of him. Not only that, but even the horses they led, the dogs they raised at home, and even the crickets that a few children played with were not real living things.

Although it was very realistic, under Xia ruofei’s spiritual power, nothing could be hidden.

Although these puppets could block out the detection of mind power and Xia ruofei could not directly check their internal structure, under the monitoring of mind power, no small action could escape Xia ruofei’s eyes, including the small animals mentioned earlier.

Xia ruofei’s spiritual power cultivation was already stronger than the average late – Stage golden core cultivator. Therefore, his brain development was far more developed than ordinary people. Even when he processed so much detailed information at the same time, he could still make an accurate analysis in the shortest time.

In short, the words and actions of the townspeople and the lifelike little animals were strictly bound by logic. Their seemingly casual movements were actually arranged, like a large – scale stage play that had been rehearsed countless times and could be easily performed by the actors with their eyes closed.

Xia ruofei’s curiosity grew. However, he knew that it would be difficult for him to get any useful information from the little Daoist, so he held back his questions and decided to follow him to the true yang temple.

This little Daoist was equivalent to an “NPC” in the game. If he was treated as a real person and communicated with, even the best – tempered person would be furious. Xia ruofei did not want to make things difficult for himself.

After leaving the town, they set foot on a winding mountain road.

Of course, the road wasn’t long, because the hill wasn’t steep at all. At most, it was just a little uneven.

Even so, this was already the highest point on the first floor of the tower, and true yang temple occupied this position.

In a short while, Xia ruofei followed the little Daoist to the entrance of true yang temple.

Xia ruofei walked closer and finally saw the true appearance of true yang temple. It was indeed a dilapidated Daoist temple. The walls of the courtyard were slightly crooked as if it would collapse at any time. The door might have been painted red before, but the original color had faded away after so many years. Besides, the temple was very small. Xia ruofei scanned it with his spiritual power. Other than some places that he could not see through, he had a general idea of the temple. There were only two entrances into the temple, the front hall and the back hall. The front hall had the statue of the Three Pure Ones and was filled with incense. The back hall looked like a living area. It was a small siheyuan structure with only a few rooms.

The little Daoist boy came to the front of the temple and pushed open the two old and broken doors. He turned around and bowed to Xia ruofei.”This scholar, we’ve arrived, please come in!” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Xia ruofei nodded and asked casually,””Little Daoist priest, how many people cultivate in your temple?”

Initially, Xia ruofei thought that this question would be useless. Unexpectedly, the little Daoist actually answered him,””Only little Daoist and honored master are here, relying on each other. Scholar, master has been waiting for a long time, please come in quickly!”

Xia ruofei was speechless. He had initially thought that this magnificent tower was the so – called true yang temple! He didn’t expect to see that true yang temple was only a very small Daoist temple on the first floor, and there were only two Daoist priests, one old and one young. He didn’t know what was going on with the old one, but he was sure that the young one was a puppet.
