2761 An unexpected reunion (1)

“It’s good that I can help you,” Ma Jia said with a smile.

Then, Ma Jia couldn’t help but sigh,””RUO Fei, you are the most promising soldier I have ever led! Of course, it’s not only because you’ve made such a big career, but also because I, the old company commander, have benefited from you. More importantly, after you left the Army, you still made such a great contribution to the country and the Army, and you even have the honor of receiving second – Class merits. I’m sure I won’t be able to do what you’re doing in the future!”

“You’re overpraising me, old company commander. ” Xia ruofei revealed a look of reminiscence.”When I learned of the news of old Luo’s death, blood also rushed to my head. In addition, it happened in the three mountains, so I’m responsible for it!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,””Oh right, I’ve asked Lei Hu to arrange a meal for you tonight. I’ll let you meet someone!”

“Oh? Who’s there?” Ma Jia asked.

“You’ll know tonight!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“You brat, you’re still keeping me in suspense!” Ma Jia laughed and scolded,” You’re the boss now, I’ll follow your arrangements!”

Since Xia ruofei had arrived, Ma Jia had the Veterans end their training early and return to the dormitory together.

The ex – soldiers had been away from each other since they were discharged from the Army. It was rare for them to get together, so they naturally had endless topics to talk about. In particular, a few of the ex – soldiers who were more familiar with Xia ruofei asked the questions that everyone was very concerned about, which was their future work.

Xia ruofei did not hide anything from everyone and gave them a brief introduction of the situation on the Paradise Island. Of course, he did not mention anything about the world of cultivation or the Taixu xuanqing formation.

The guards were mainly responsible for the daily Defense of the island. The Liu family had already set up a lot of weapons and equipment on the island, which needed professional people to operate. The guards were dealing with ordinary security threats, including Pirates and the like. In the event of civil strife in the agate, Paradise Island, which was relatively close, might be affected by the chaos.

If cultivators invaded, there would naturally be a large array to deal with it. When the time came, all the ordinary people would be transferred to the sanctuary in the mountain.

Regarding the weapons and equipment that the ex – soldiers were very concerned about, Xia ruofei also readily expressed that everyone could make a list according to their needs. As long as it was not too exaggerated, he would be able to satisfy them.

Everyone was naturally cheering. After being in the Army for so many years, especially in the Special Forces, they had come into contact with a lot of weapons and equipment. The Veterans were also very familiar with some foreign military equipment and had long been fascinated by some famous weapons. Thinking that they could use these weapons in the future, everyone was naturally happy from the bottom of their hearts. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

After everyone chatted for a while, the 20 – odd veterans that Xu Yougang brought arrived at Taoyuan farm.

These were all his old comrades in the Army, and he knew them well. Their military quality was also very good.

Xu Yougang had gathered everyone together and then took the high – speed rail to come here.

According to Xia ruofei’s instructions, Xu Yougang had contacted Lei Hu in advance, so the peach blossom company had sent a bus to Sanshan South Station to pick up everyone.

Xia ruofei looked at the travel – worn Xu Yougang and gave him a few words of encouragement. He then asked him to quickly bring the Veterans to the dormitory to settle down.

Soon, Xu Yougang came over and explained to Xia ruofei the situation of the recruitment of veterans.

He had brought a total of 23 comrades, all of whom used to be excellent Scouts. He had also carefully made a roster, listing everyone’s basic information and service status.

Xia ruofei also trusted Xu Yougang very much. After a brief understanding, he accepted all the Veterans.

Of course, Xia ruofei still had to conduct a routine screening of everyone before he entered the island, including the old captain ma su. It was not that he did not trust them, but Peach Garden Island was too important to Xia ruofei. He could not allow any mistakes to happen.

Xia ruofei introduced Ma Jia and the other veterans from lone wolf to Xu Yougang. They were all from the military, so there was a natural sense of closeness between them. Soon, the two groups of veterans got along well and started to chat with each other.

In the Army, there would always be all kinds of relationships, such as fellow soldiers, common comrades, or the martial arts competition that they had participated in, and so on. Moreover, lone Wolf’s team members were mainly selected from various reconnaissance troops, and many of them could also interact with old troops.

Therefore, everyone soon began to chat with great enthusiasm.

Of course, they were all old comrades who had been trained by the Army for many years. Even though they had already retired, they still remembered the confidentiality regulations in their hearts. As for the secret missions they had carried out during their service, if they had not passed the confidentiality period, they would definitely not mention them.

The sky was getting dark. Lei Hu walked over and said to Xia ruofei,””Brother Xia, the canteen is ready!”

In order to ensure the food of the Veterans, Lei Hu had specially invited the wife of Cao tieshu, who was originally in charge of the canteen, back to be in charge of the cooking.

After the peach blossom company’s headquarters moved, the number of people eating at the farm’s cafeteria had also decreased. Now, it was mainly the farm workers who ate lunch here. The company’s headquarters ‘cafeteria for the employees had also been built. Therefore, Cao tieshu’s wife had already gone to work in the headquarters’ cafeteria, leaving only a chef here.

This time, Xia ruofei had ordered to prioritize the food and lodging of the Veterans, so Lei Hu had transferred Cao tieshu’s wife, who had the best cooking skills, back.
