Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows and asked with a smile,”Oh? You’ve made a decision so quickly? Then tell me!”

Feng Rao looked at Xia ruofei deeply and said,””Chairman, I don’t want to choose any of them. I think the current reward plan is already very generous. There’s no need to change it.”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be stunned. There was money that was sent to the door?

“President Feng, since I’ve mentioned it, it means that your job is worthy of this remuneration.” Xia ruofei said seriously,”you don’t have to decline. This is a proposal that I proposed.”

“I’m not being polite, Chairman,” Feng Jing said sincerely.”As the company’s general manager, I know better than anyone else that whether it’s the 3% bonus or the 2% shares, they’ll be unimaginable wealth in the future. I don’t deserve a reward ...”

“Nonsense!” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but swear.”What do you mean by ‘I don’t deserve it’? You have the highest position in the entire company other than me. There are a lot of work that you don’t need to do personally, but you took the initiative to do it. The company’s development in the past year has been obvious to all, and the results are extremely eye – catching! This was still ‘useless’? Do you need me to praise you?”

Feng Rao couldn’t help but smile and said,””Chairman, I didn’t mean that ...”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”then accept my proposal!” I’m telling you! This is the first of the two options. If there is no third option, you are not allowed to refuse!”

Xia ruofei’s words were a little overbearing, but Feng Jing felt a warm current in her heart. She lowered her head and thought for a moment before saying,””Then I’ll choose the shares!”

“You made the right choice!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”CEO Feng, you’re very visionary! When I’m done with this, I’ll transfer the shares to you when it’s worth it at the company’s Annual Meeting!”

Although if he chose shares, he would lose 1% of his dividends every year, with the development speed of paradise Corporation, it was only a matter of time before its market value exceeded 10 billion. By then, 2% of the shares would be hundreds of millions, and years of dividends would not be as valuable as this.

“Then I’ll thank you first, Chairman,” Feng Jing said with a smile.

“Why are you being so polite with me? This is what you deserve. ” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”but if you want to cash out in five years, you have to give me priority. I don’t want outsiders to have shares in my company!”

Feng Jing’s heart was filled with sweetness. Even though Xia ruofei did not mean it, to Feng Jing, it meant that Xia ruofei did not treat her as an outsider. This made her even happier than the 2% shares. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

In fact, Feng Jing had chosen to take the shares with this mentality. In the future, she would be tied to Xia ruofei. Even if her shares were pitifully small, she would still be a shareholder!

Furthermore, the moment she chose the shares, she had already made up her mind that no matter what happened to Yingluo in the future, she would never sell the two percent of shares and would keep them in her hands.

After they finished their discussion, Xia ruofei stood up and said,””Boss Feng, I’ll go back first. You’ve been busy recently. The personnel structure adjustment plan and the bonus reward plan have to be done as soon as possible. You’ll have to work hard!”

“Don’t worry! I’ll get it out as soon as possible!” Feng Rao put away her feelings and stood up.”I’ll report to you immediately if there’s any news from bojun real estate.”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”sure!” Then go do your work! I’m leaving ...”

In the afternoon, Xia ruofei made a trip to the city. This time, he had been away in Hong Kong for a few days. When he returned, the first thing he wanted to do was to find Ling Qingxue and cuddle with her. They were both at the age where they were full of vigor. Although he had another romantic encounter with Monica in Hong Kong, once he returned to the three mountains, Xia ruofei could not help but miss Ling Qingxue’s long and alluring legs ...

After spending the entire afternoon at the hotel, the two of them went to Ling Ji’s private kitchen for dinner. Xia ruofei drove Ling Qingxue home before driving back to the farm.

The business of Ling’s private kitchen was very good, and it was full almost every day.

Xia ruofei ‘s’ Buddha Jumps Over the Wall ‘had also become a Golden Brand. People who wanted to eat this dish had to make reservations many days in advance. Even though it was expensive, it was still hard to get a jar.

Of course, when Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue went to eat, there would naturally be a surplus for this dish when they prepared the ingredients every day. After all, the privileged class would never disappear. When the water is clear, there will be no fish!

......

In the next few days, Xia ruofei resumed his peaceful life.

He walked around the farm and added some diluted spirit Heart Flower petal solution to the water tower in the farm and the Pomfret cultivation workshop.

Under Cao tieshu’s management, the vegetable greenhouse was also thriving. Now, its production capacity had reached its maximum, and there was a long line of vegetable trucks coming to transport vegetables every morning. The monthly output value had already reached close to eight million.

This was mainly because the price of Taoyuan vegetables was more than ten times or even dozens of times higher than that of ordinary vegetables. In addition to the labor, the only cost was the daily maintenance of the greenhouse and the money for the seeds. The profit rate was quite high.

There was also good news from the pomfrets cultivation workshop. The first batch of pomfrets had basically reached the selling standard.

The person in charge of the workshop, Jiang Hua, suggested that they raise the Pomfret for another month or so and sell this batch of pomfrets during the peak season before the Spring Festival. By then, they would have a large income.
