2991 Getting his wish (1)

In room 15, Wu Ming’s expression was extremely ugly.

He kept cursing,”what the hell is this!?” He would rather have five firecloud pills than 80000 spirit stones. Was he out of his mind? Uncle Feng, I suspect that there’s a conspiracy behind this! Could it be that the star Seizer sect had deliberately directed and acted out this? It’s just to ridicule us!”

Luo Feng didn’t know whether to laugh or cry,”young sect leader, you’re thinking too much!” They shouldn’t be that bored. As I said earlier, it’s possible that this person has long taken a fancy to this pair of storage rings, so he did a lot of research in advance. He knows what the cultivator who entrusted the auction of the pair of rings urgently needs, so he has a target to target and took out the firecloud pills!”

In fact, Luo Feng’s current mood was very conflicted. On one hand, the spirit Vulture mountain had been slapped in the face. As an elder of the spirit Vulture mountain, he naturally couldn’t be happy. On the other hand, this result allowed him to keep the 80000 spiritual stones he had brought out this time. Although the chances of winning the treasure with these 80000 spiritual stones were still very slim, at least there was still a glimmer of hope. At least he would not completely lose his qualification to compete.

Wu Ming looked indignant and said,””That brat from the star Seizer sect looks like a treacherous fellow ...”

“Young sect leader, forget it ...” Luo Feng consoled,”more than half of the famous people in the cultivation world are here. We can’t do anything to them. We’ll just find another chance to get back at them ...”

The speaker didn’t mean it, but the listener took it seriously.

After hearing Luo Feng’s words, Wu Ming’s eyes flickered a few times, then he sat down without a word.

In room 20.

The head of the fallen leaf sect, Shao Qingyang, was still fully absorbed in reading the first handwritten copy of the “glittering jewel true understanding.” He had naturally noticed what had happened during the auction just now, but now he had to devote himself to memorizing the contents of the handwritten copy, so he naturally had no time to care about other things.

After the auction’s results were settled, Shao Qingyang reluctantly shifted his gaze away from the handwritten book and said with a smile,””Fellow Daoist Xia is really full of hidden abilities! Chi – amassing pill, firecloud pill ... These are all long – Lost medicines in the cultivation world, and you can actually take them out so easily. ”

Because Shao Qingyang was present, Xia ruofei and Luo Qingfeng had communicated through telepathy. However, Shao Qingyang could still see that Xia ruofei had been the one making the decisions from the beginning to the end. Luo Qingfeng, the dignified sect leader, was just a bystander here. Thus, Shao Qingyang was even more certain of his judgment. His attitude toward Xia ruofei became even more affable, and it was obvious that he wanted to befriend him.

Xia ruofei smiled faintly.”You flatter me, sect leader Shao. I’m just a senior. I don’t have that kind of ability!”

Xia ruofei had deliberately spoken ambiguously. He did not lie. All of this had been left for him by immortal mountain river.

However, the way he described it easily led to other associations.

Sure enough, Shao Qingyang’s first impression of the young man in front of him made him even more certain that he was most likely the direct disciple of a Yuanying stage senior. Otherwise, how could he have such a deep foundation? Moreover, he seemed to have admitted it himself just now.

What Shao Qingyang didn’t know was that even though master Shanhe, who was behind Xia ruofei, was a Senior Master with a cultivation level that was far beyond the nascent Soul Stage, he had left earth a long time ago and could no longer be Xia ruofei’s backer.

Xia ruofei’s current strength was not at the top of the cultivation world, so when necessary, he would still use the Tiger’s skin as a banner.

If all these big shots in the world of cultivation had the impression that he had the support of a nascent soul old monster behind him, then those who harbored evil intentions would have to first measure their own strength before they wanted to deal with the star Seizer sect.

Shao Qingyang’s expression changed slightly, but he immediately returned to normal. He revealed a more friendly smile and said,””Fellow Daoist Xia is too modest ... Our Fallen Leaf sect and the star Seizer sect have always had a friendly relationship. We can be said to be of the same breath and branch. We should keep in touch more often in the future!” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Definitely!” Xia ruofei said indifferently.

Shao Qingyang didn’t want to waste too much time. After all, his top priority was to memorize the contents of the first volume of the glittering jewel Wonderland. So, after a few polite words, he immediately said,””Fellow Daoist Xia, I’ve just told Qing Song that the auction will continue as usual. After I’ve finished reading the handwritten copy, I’ll personally invite sect leader mu over, and we’ll trade face to face.”

Xia ruofei had directly used the firecloud pill to pay for the spiritual stones during the auction. Shao Qingyang naturally understood that Xia ruofei had already known who the person who entrusted the auction of the flying Phoenix ring was in advance. Moreover, everyone would be examining the goods in person later, so Shao Qingyang naturally would not hide Mu Sheng’s identity anymore.

Shao Qingyang’s reading time was already past half, so it would only take another half an hour for him to finish reading. Hence, Xia ruofei naturally did not mind. He smiled and said,””Then we’ll follow your arrangement, sect leader Shao.”

“Alright!” Shao Qingyang quickly nodded. Then I’ll Continue reading ...”

“Please go ahead, sect leader Shao!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

The following auction was uneventful. One treasure after another was brought up to the main auction stage, and after everyone had bid, they all found a suitable owner.
