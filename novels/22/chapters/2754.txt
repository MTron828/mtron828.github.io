2755 The storage ring (1)

This plan was much simpler than the modification of the activation formation.

The activation of the Taixu xuanqing formation had to be precise to the point of no error. Otherwise, it would affect the effect of the formation.

This time, Xia ruofei planned the island. He only needed to make reasonable arrangements according to the existing functional zones of Peach Blossom Island and draw out some forbidden areas. This was because some of the defensive formations of the Taixu xuanqing formation could be adjusted according to the actual situation.

Hence, Xia ruofei spent about an hour to complete the task.

At this time, the sky outside the window had already revealed a trace of white. Xia ruofei stood up and stretched lazily. He moved his hands and feet, then sat cross – legged on the bed and cultivated for a while.

The Taixu xuanqing formation had always been running, so the concentration of spiritual Qi on the Peach Blossom Island was much higher than the outside world. Although it couldn’t be compared with the inside of the spirit map space, it had at least met the conditions for cultivation.

The most important thing was that after the purification of the Taixu xuanqing formation, the spiritual energy in the formation was not as heterogeneous and violent as the outside world. The cultivators on the island could directly absorb the spiritual energy for cultivation.

Xia ruofei had just broken through the shackles of the Qi refining stage last night and consolidated his cultivation in the spirit map space. However, at least 90% of the genuine Qi in his dantian had not been converted into primordial Qi. There was no bottleneck at this stage. As long as he cultivated steadily, he would be able to succeed naturally.

Xia ruofei also hoped to reach the Golden core stage as soon as possible, so he was more active in his cultivation.

The second level of the “great Dao Arts” was even more mysterious and complicated. Fortunately, Xia ruofei had obtained the information from the Jade talisman of inheritance, so there was no problem with his proficiency. However, the spiritual Qi gathered by the Taixu xuanqing formation was not dense enough. For Xia ruofei, who was used to using crystals or cultivating in the spirit map space, he was not used to it. He always felt that the amount of spiritual Qi He absorbed was too little, and his cultivation speed was very slow.

In fact, even if the spirit Qi gathered by the Taixu xuanqing formation had not reached its optimal state, the cultivation environment here was better than most places on earth. Even some small cultivation sects might not be able to reach such a concentration of spirit Qi.

Moreover, Xia ruofei’s cultivation speed was far beyond that of ordinary cultivators. This was also the reason why Luo Qingfeng was so surprised when he saw that Xia ruofei had only consolidated his cultivation for such a short period of time but had already transformed 10% of his vital energy.

However, Xia ruofei was used to the speed and environment of his cultivation. He was like a person who was used to eating delicacies. He was not used to having a simple meal.

Xia ruofei finished his cultivation at around eight in the morning. He checked and realized that the amount of genuine Qi that had been converted into vital Qi after two hours of cultivation was not even one percent. He could not help but shake his head.

He got up and went to the bathroom to wash up, then walked downstairs.

Luo Qingfeng, Zheng Yongshou, and Wang Boshan were already waiting for Xia ruofei on the first floor. Li Yifu had also woken up early and was also waiting on the first floor.

Wang Boshan even prepared everyone’s breakfast. There was a staff cafeteria in the building, and there were many ingredients stored in the refrigerator. Wang Boshan didn’t need to leave the building to prepare breakfast. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

They did not dare to leave the building as the formation was still in operation. Only Xia ruofei knew where was safe and where was full of danger.

Seeing Xia ruofei walk out of the elevator, Li Yifu quickly went up to him and greeted him respectfully,””Senior granduncle!”

Luo Qingfeng and the others also quickly came forward to greet him.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”everyone’s up early!” Let’s have breakfast first!”

After the meal, Xia ruofei said to Luo Qingfeng and the others,””Then let’s follow my arrangements yesterday. Everyone, go and do your work! Qingfeng, go back to the sect directly. Wang Boshan, go back to your stars Corporation. Both of you must keep in touch!”

“Yes! Master!” “Yes!” Luo Qingfeng and Wang Boshan responded in unison.

Xia ruofei then said to Li Yifu,”Yifu, go with them to evatz Island and bring back Liu An’s crew. I’ll be preparing to return to China in two days.” Oh right, bring back bainilatti as well. ”

During the evacuation, Liu An’s crew naturally could not stay on Paradise Island. Xia ruofei had arranged for them to be on standby at the nearby evates Island. Now that the crisis had been averted and Xia ruofei was preparing to return to his country, he naturally had to bring the crew back.

“Alright, martial granduncle!” Li Yifu replied.

“Come back as soon as possible after you’ve picked them up.” Xia ruofei said,”there are still some things I need you to do.”

“Yes!” Li Yifu said.

Xia ruofei led everyone out of the project department building. He took a deep breath of the air that was filled with spiritual essence and said,””You can go directly to the dock to take a boat! The island’s great formation is only activated to gather spirit energy. I’ve already shut down all the other defensive formations, so there’s no need to worry about safety!”

“Yes!” “Yes, master,” Luo Qingfeng replied.”I’ll take my leave then!”

“Go!” Xia ruofei waved his hand and said.

From the corner of his eye, he saw the ancient ring on Luo Qingfeng’s hand, and his heart skipped a beat. Xia ruofei had already noticed it when they fought yesterday. He saw that things often appeared out of thin air in Luo Qingfeng’s hands. Naturally, he knew that Luo Qingfeng definitely had a storage treasure.

“Qingfeng, are you wearing a storage ring?” Xia ruofei asked after some thought.
