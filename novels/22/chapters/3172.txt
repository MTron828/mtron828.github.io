Deputy Chief Wei was slightly stunned when he heard this. Then, he laughed and said,”In a sense, you can say that.”

Xia ruofei’s comparison was not accurate, but it was easy to understand. Everyone’s home computer CPU was based on the number of cores. The comparison of more than 100000 cores was indeed shocking.

As expected, Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but say,””That’s amazing!”

Deputy Director Wei smiled and said,”the peak performance of the light of Taihu territory reaches 125.436 pflpos, ranking third in the world. Its continuous performance is 93.015 pflpos, ranking first in the world. At the same time, its performance and power consumption ratio is also ranked first in the world.” At the 2016 Frankfurt world supercomputer conference, our light of Taihu territory supercomputer system topped the list. It’s almost twice as fast as Tianhe -2, which is in second place, and its efficiency is three times higher. ”

As the world’s top supercomputer, the light of Taihu territory had indeed brought glory to the country of Wei. Therefore, Deputy Director Wei was also very familiar with this data.

“Our scientific and technological workers are really amazing!” Xia ruofei looked at the neatly arranged equipment cabinets in front of him and said sincerely.

Xia ruofei had learned a lot about supercomputers during this period of time. Therefore, he was naturally very interested in the world – leading supercomputer in front of him. He pulled Deputy Director Wei along and started discussing the system architecture diagram on the wall of the computer room.

Deputy Director Wei wasn’t a pure technical staff. His knowledge in the field of supercomputing was only enough to introduce the results to the audience. Therefore, when faced with more professional and in – depth questions, he seemed to be a bit beyond his power.

Hence, he called one of the staff over and asked him to talk to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei stayed in the engine room for a few hours and still wanted more.

However, he didn’t want to affect other people’s work. Besides, he didn’t know how Wang Chi was doing. If he stayed in the computer room for too long, it wouldn’t be good to let the old academician wait for him.

Hence, Xia ruofei expressed his gratitude to the person on duty and left the engine room.

The person on duty and Deputy Director Wei were a few steps behind Xia ruofei and the other two. The person on duty could not help but ask in a low voice,””Director Wei, which school is this scholar from? He’s so young!”

Deputy Director Wei did not know whether to laugh or cry. “You’ve misjudged! He’s not a scholar, don’t you think he looks familiar?”

“I don’t think so!” The on – duty officer was confused.”Director, could it be an expert who has returned from abroad?” I don’t think I’ve seen this person before!”

Deputy Director Wei knew the workers on duty very well. He knew that many of them did not care about entertainment news, let alone the cosmetics industry, so he did not find it too strange.

“He’s the chairman of the peach blossom company, Xia ruofei, CEO Xia. Have you never heard of him?”

“Chairman?” The staff on duty said in surprise,”he’s really not an academic? Then his professional Foundation was too solid! I thought we were in the same field ... Director, Xia ruofei ... This name sounds familiar!”

“You can search for it online when you have time,” Deputy Director Wei said with a smile.

He patted the Guard’s shoulder and quickly chased after Xia ruofei and the other two.

The staff on duty walked out of the computer room with a confused expression. At this time, Xia ruofei and the other two, accompanied by Deputy Director Wei, had already taken off their shoe covers, retrieved their phones from the screening cabinet, and went to visit other places.

The guard took out his phone from the cell phone screen cabinet and searched for Xia ruofei’s information.

After a long while, the guard couldn’t help but shout,””Damn ... That’s really 666!”

There were many bosses who were richer than Xia ruofei in China. There were many more celebrities who were more popular than Xia ruofei. After all, Xia ruofei was not in the entertainment industry and never created hype. However, it was rare to see a rich, handsome, and popular Chairman like Xia ruofei. Such a winner in life who knew so much about supercomputers was like a fairy tale.

……

Deputy Director Wei accompanied Xia ruofei on a tour of the Supercomputing Center’s other facilities. However, after a while, the phone in his pocket vibrated.

Deputy Director Wei took it out and saw that it was his daughter, Wei Xue. He frowned slightly. It was working hours now, and he was accompanying a guest on a tour, so it was naturally not convenient for him to answer the phone.

After hesitating for a while, Deputy Director Wei chose to hang up the phone.

However, just as he was about to put his phone back into his pocket, he saw a notification on the lock screen. There were 18 missed calls and more than 10 unread WeChat messages. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

When he came out of the computer room just now, Deputy Director Wei took out his phone from the screen cabinet. He didn’t check it and just put it in his pocket.

That was why he had only just realized that he had so many missed calls.

In addition, his daughter had called him just now. Deputy Director Wei immediately became nervous. Could something have happened at home?

His mother had always been in poor health, and her legs were not very convenient. He was worried that his mother had fallen at home.

Under such circumstances, Deputy Director Wei could not care about anything else. He quickly said to Xia ruofei,””President Xia, I’m sorry. I have something to do at home, so I have to make a call ...”

“Please go ahead, director Wei!” Xia ruofei pointed at the long chairs along the corridor and smiled.”We’re tired from walking, so we’ll sit down and rest for a while.”
