Chapter 1444: the first Prince!

At the Liu family’s residence.

Liu Qunfeng had been waiting in the courtyard. When Liu Kuan came back last night, Liu Qunfeng knew that under normal circumstances, Xia ruofei would come over today. After all, he had been away for three or four days. It was reasonable for Xia ruofei to come and check on old master Liu. Besides, the medicine left behind last time had been used up. If he didn’t come back, the medicine would run out. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Liu Qunfeng was secretly looking forward to Xia ruofei’s success. He hoped that Xia ruofei would be satisfied after seeing the island, and then he would choose this plan.

Compared to old master Liu, Liu Qunfeng hoped that Xia ruofei would choose Qingyun Island.

As the eldest son of the Liu family, he still had enough potential to continue to develop and find the last way out for the family in the ocean thousands of miles away. In his heart, he was somewhat disapproving. If it were not for old man Liu’s insistence, he would not have agreed to the family to invest so much money in green cloud Island.

In Liu Qunfeng’s opinion, this plan wouldn’t cost him too much cash. Most importantly, it would protect his family’s shares.

After Liu Kuan came back, he went directly to report to Grandpa Liu. Then, he stayed in Grandpa Liu’s room for a long time before coming out. Grandpa Liu didn’t take the initiative to call him, so he didn’t want to disturb him.

As for Liu Kuan, he had always been directly responsible for elder Liu. Liu Qunfeng didn’t ask Liu Kuan about it, so he didn’t want to be embarrassed.

Therefore, Liu Qunfeng’s heart was like a cat scratching at it. He was both excited and nervous.

When Xia ruofei’s Toyota Elfa slowly drove into the courtyard, Liu Qunfeng subconsciously went up to him.

“Mr. Xia, you’ve had a long journey!” Liu Qunfeng said enthusiastically.

Xia ruofei smiled.”Chief Liu, you’re being too serious. The scenery at Qingyun Island is beautiful. It’s like I’m going on a vacation.”

“It’s at least 20000 kilometers to and fro!” Liu Qunfeng said,”it must have been tough on the plane!”

The moment Liu Qunfeng said that, he regretted it. Wasn’t Qianqian reminding Xia ruofei that Qingyun Island was too far away? It was located deep in the South Pacific Ocean! Every time he went there, he had to fly for more than ten hours. If Xia ruofei felt that there was not much use for the green cloud Island because of his reminder and was tired from the long journey every time he went for a vacation, wouldn’t he be shooting himself in the foot if he changed his mind?

Fortunately, Xia ruofei did not seem to have much of a reaction to this sentence. The smile on his face did not weaken either. He only said casually,””It’s alright, I’m still young. Besides, it’s quite convenient to fly now!”

Then, Xia ruofei said,”chief Liu, the old man should be awake by now, right?” I’ll give him a checkup first!”

“Alright! Alright!” Liu Qunfeng quickly said,”by the way, Mr. Xia, the Chinese medicine you prepared last time has been used up ...”

“I prepared some last night, don’t worry! The raw materials and medicinal herbs are still sufficient for the time being, so we won’t run out of medicine. ” Xia ruofei said indifferently.

At this time, Wu Qiang had already gotten out of the car and brought out a thermal container from the trunk. It contained the Chinese medicine that Xia ruofei had asked Xia Qing to brew last night. Of course, it was also diluted with the petal solution of the spirit Heart Flower.

Xia ruofei took the thermal container and said to Wu Qiang,””Wait for me in the car!” He said.

“Yes!” Wu Qiang replied.

“Let’s go!” Xia ruofei said to Liu Qunfeng, holding a thermal container.

Liu Qunfeng wanted to ask his men to help Xia ruofei carry the bag, but after thinking about it, he gave up on the idea. Even he did not have the intention to help Xia ruofei carry the bag. He was reminded of the time when Liu Lifang had ruined the medicine. Once bitten, twice shy. He was a little oversensitive now.

Xia ruofei walked up the stairs with great familiarity. He went to the room next door and personally took out the bags of Chinese medicine from the thermal box and put them into the refrigerator. Then, he said to Liu Qunfeng,””Chief Liu, please get someone to send the thermal container to my car and tell my driver to go back and wait for orders.”

“Alright! Alright!” Liu Qunfeng quickly said.

Then, he beckoned for a big Man in Black and gave Xia ruofei’s orders.

Then, Liu Qunfeng immediately sent people to guard the room, especially the refrigerator that contained the Chinese medicine.

Xia ruofei was already very familiar with this place and naturally did not need anyone to lead the way. He went straight out and walked to the door of the room next door. After knocking on the door gently, he pushed the door open and walked in.

Old man Liu was lying on his bed, watching the morning news on the TV. Although Youyou had retired many years ago, old man Liu still watched the news broadcast every night. He would also sometimes pay attention to the news that was broadcast at different time periods in the day.

Seeing Xia ruofei enter, old master Liu smiled and waved at Xia ruofei, saying,””Little Xia is here!”

“Mr. Liu, I’m here to bring you your medicine. I’ll also help you check up.” Xia ruofei walked to the head of the bed and asked casually,”how have you been these few days?”

“I feel fine,” said old Liu. “I don’t feel like I’m getting better every day like before, but at least my condition hasn’t worsened. It’s just that I’ve been feeling uneasy. I think ... You’d better give me a calming pill today!”

Xia ruofei chuckled,”I can’t just say something I’m not sure of!” In short, you must believe me. I’ll definitely do my best to treat you. “
