Such a large piece of truffle was directly divided and eaten? Everyone was in disbelief. One had to know that at the Grao family’s truffle auction, that 580 – gram truffle had been sold for 10000 US dollars! This truffle was also more than 500 grams, but Xia ruofei had actually taken it out for everyone to share! Regarding the preciousness of white truffle, someone had once described a scene: In a Western restaurant with an elegant environment, a truffle fanatic sat upright and still, and beside him stood an Italy chef with a serious expression. There was a bowl of Italy in front of the customer. He reached out and gestured to the chef. The chef took a piece of white truffle and used the truffle to peel off four pieces of truffle that were as thin as paper. Then, the chef said expressionlessly,”” 100 dollars, Sir!” The customer’s facial muscles twitched. He took a deep breath of the strong smell of the truffle and gestured again. The chef then scraped off another four light truffle slices and said,”” 200 dollars, Sir!” The special truffle slices could cut the truffle into extremely thin slices. These four pieces of truffle were almost weightless, and they cost 100 dollars in Western restaurants. The preciousness of white truffle could be seen clearly. And Xia ruofei had actually taken out a whole truffle of more than 500 grams for everyone to taste for free. How generous was that? Everyone thought of one possibility, and that was that the remaining truffles still covered under the red silk on the stage would not be any lighter than this piece. However, everyone felt that it was a little unbelievable. Even at the auction held by the Grao family, it was impossible to make all the truffles more than 500 grams. Such a large truffle was usually hard to come by. How could so many of them appear at once? “This Mr. Xia is really generous!” “My God ... 512 grams of white truffle, free to taste ...” “I’m suddenly filled with anticipation for this auction!” The guests were discussing spiritedly. At this time, the Michelin star chef, Mark Lawrence, had already arrived below the stage. He first came to MA Xiong, took out a small truffle from the pocket of his chef’s suit, and continuously peeled six or seven pieces of truffle and put them on MA Xiong’s plate. The truffle came to the crowd at a close distance. Especially after it was cut open, the special smell immediately permeated the crowd. The gluttons sniffed at the same time, and then revealed an intoxicated look. In terms of appearance, quality, and fragrance, Xia ruofei’s truffle was not inferior to the alasuo family’s Alba truffle. In fact, it might even be better. At first, some people had the same idea as Blake. They thought that even if Xia ruofei’s truffles were heavy, they were not as good as the grazo truffles. Many people even thought that Xia ruofei’s truffles were the so – called cheap Chinese truffles. Now, these people’s thoughts had begun to waver. Blake’s face was getting more and more unsightly. Mark Lawrence’s movements were very skillful. He quickly added truffles to MA Xiong, Ma Zhiming, Tian Huixin, Lu You, and even Huan Huan’s plates. Then, he shuttled through the guests without stopping and added pieces of white truffles to everyone’s plates. The unique smell of the White truffle was getting stronger and stronger, and the entire banquet hall was filled with this special fragrance. Soon, Mark Lawrence came to Blake. Mark Lawrence’s movements were smooth and natural, but he stopped when he reached Blake. Mark Lawrence shrugged and said,””I’m sure Mr. Blake wouldn’t want to taste such cheap truffles!” After that, Mark Lawrence walked past Blake and went to the next guest. Seeing this, the guests from China all laughed. Lu You even took the lead to applaud. Although Lu You often did not like Xia ruofei, when Xia ruofei was taunted by Blake on the stage just now, Lu You was extremely angry and almost stood up to scold Blake without caring about her image. Mark Lawrence’s actions made Lu You and the Chinese people present feel very relieved. Blake’s face turned extremely ugly. He put down the unsightly plate and was about to leave the table in anger, but he sat back down with a livid face after a few changes of expression. Blake gritted his teeth and said in his heart, I’d like to see how much this cheap truffle of yours can fetch! Under everyone’s mocking gaze, Blake refused to leave. He still stubbornly believed that Xia ruofei’s truffle was not presentable. Other than Blake, the entire Hall was filled with a happy atmosphere. Soon, everyone was given six or seven truffles. Mark Lawrence still had half of the truffles left, so he didn’t hesitate and started the second round of distribution. In the end, all the truffles were distributed, and everyone got about ten truffles on average. Everyone saw that the White truffle slices cut by Mark Lawrence had marble – like patterns on the surface. The unique fragrance of the top – grade truffle was extremely rich. After adding a few pieces of truffle to an ordinary omelet, it had the effect of Turning Stone into gold, making all the gluttons drool with desire. “Please enjoy the taste!” Xia ruofei said with a smile. There were at least a hundred people in the entire Hall. Everyone was tasting a piece of white truffle together. The scene was spectacular, especially in the midst of the rich truffle fragrance. Everyone revealed an intoxicated expression. Many people picked up their plates and took a deep breath first. They started to taste the White truffle omelet amidst the strong aroma. Soon, the hall was filled with gasps of admiration. “An unparalleled pure flavor!” “I swear to God that this is the most delicious white truffle I’ve ever tasted in my 20 years of being in the industry!” This was the sigh of a chef from a top Western restaurant. “What an incredible taste!” “I feel like my taste buds are going to explode ...” “This white truffle is definitely a top – grade item ...” The rising and falling praises made Blake’s face turn uglier and uglier. In his eyes, this was absolutely impossible. Blake’s face turned green as he thought,”could it be that these people were hired by that kid?” Of course, this thought only flashed through her mind for a moment. Anyone with even a little bit of rationality would know that this was absolutely impossible. Everyone in the room was a super – rich and famous chef. No one in the world would be able to buy all of them over. Soon, this “small segment” was coming to an end. Xia ruofei saw that everyone was almost done eating and smiled. He walked straight to the two long display tables and pulled down the red silk cloth covering them one by one, leaving only five truffles in the middle. The rest of the truffles were revealed. Looking at the huge truffles neatly arranged on the stage, the guests were all silent. It was as if they had stopped breathing
