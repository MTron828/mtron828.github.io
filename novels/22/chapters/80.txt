All this while, the painting would only react when Xia ruofei touched the raw gemstones or jadeite. Now, the painting started to shake on its own. What did this mean? Xia ruofei could only think of one possibility, and that was that there was something that the painting scroll urgently wanted in the pile of raw stones. It was very likely that this was a high – Quality Jade that could promote its evolution. Xia ruofei’s thoughts started to run wild, but his face remained expressionless. He walked over and squatted down casually, picking up the raw gemstones with ease. Boss Chen happened to look over and said with a smile,””Brother Xia, that pile of raw stones was prepared to be sent next door as a gift. There’s nothing to see! If there aren’t any that you’d like, there’s still a lot of them here. You can come over and pick. ” In fact, he was just giving them a kind reminder. After all, this pile of raw gemstones was of very poor quality and had been picked by many customers before. It was impossible for anyone to want them in the shop, so he was going to take them as gifts. Xia ruofei smiled and turned around.””Boss Chen, I buy raw stones more because I like them! Besides, isn’t the raw stone that rose in price the last time a free gift from the neighbor?” Boss Chen was stunned for a moment, then he laughed and said,””That makes sense! Brother Xia, you can pick whatever you like. I’ll give you whatever you like!” Xia ruofei grinned and said,”sure!” Then I’ll thank you first!” After that, Xia ruofei really squatted down and continued to pick the raw stones. Boss Chen only smiled and shook his head. He then started chatting with the familiar customers beside him. It was obvious that he did not care about the pile of raw stones at all. Xia ruofei reached out to search. Throughout the entire process, the spirit map was shaking slightly. Xia ruofei could even feel a trace of longing from the spirit map. When Xia ruofei’s hand touched a raw stone, the spirit painting scroll suddenly shook more violently. The intensity of the vibration was no less than the raw stone that was priced at more than two million. Xia ruofei knew that it was definitely this stone. He looked at the black raw stone quietly and remembered its shape in his heart. Then, he continued to search. However, the spirit painting did not shake as violently as before. Xia ruofei was sure that it was the black raw stone from earlier! However, he did not pick it up immediately. Instead, he stood up and walked to the other shelf. “Brother Xia,” boss Chen laughed,”there’s nothing in that pile that you like, right?” Xia ruofei chuckled.”I’ll go over here and pick first. I’ll come back later to get a piece no matter what. It’s a free gift from boss Chen anyway!” Boss Chen laughed and said,””No problem! You can pick a few more later!” Xia ruofei nodded with a smile and walked to another shelf. If he could not find a suitable raw stone here, Xia ruofei could only buy one randomly and ‘conveniently’ take the black ‘gift’. Xia ruofei walked between the shelves with a relaxed expression. He looked like he was casually looking at the goods but in fact, he did not miss a single raw stone. The situation on this shelf was similar to the previous one. There were not many raw stones that could cause the spirit map scroll to shake, and there was no violent reaction at all. Just as Xia ruofei thought that he had to settle for the second – best option, his hand brushed past a raw stone. The spirit painting scroll suddenly vibrated. Judging from the vibration, the Jade contained in the raw stone should be worth at least two million Yuan. Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows and looked at the price tag next to the raw stone. 250 thousand Yuan. The price was also appropriate, so it was this! Xia ruofei was excited. However, Xia ruofei was still very calm. He did not take the raw stone immediately. Instead, he continued to choose raw stones as if nothing had happened. In the end, he randomly picked two raw stones that definitely did not have Jade. Then, he took them to the counter for payment with this one that was priced at 250000 Yuan. “Little brother, you’ve chosen?” Boss Chen asked with a smile. Xia ruofei smiled and said,”yes!” I don’t know anything about it, so I’ll just buy a few pieces based on my feelings. ” “It feels good!” Boss Chen laughed and said,”brother, didn’t you also make a big profit last time based on your feelings? This time, it’ll definitely rise greatly!” “Haha, then I’ll be counting on your blessings!” Xia ruofei said. At this time, the shop assistant had finished calculating. Including the two raw stones that Xia ruofei had randomly picked up, it was a total of four hundred thousand. Xia ruofei paid with his card and said,””Boss Chen, I’ll have to trouble your master to help me cut the stone!” Boss Chen nodded and turned around.””Old Xu, you go and help Brother Xia cut the stone!” “Yes, boss!” The master of cutting stones, old Xu, said quickly. “Brother, old Xu is the most experienced stonecutter in our shop.” Boss Chen smiled at Xia ruofei and said,”tell him how you want to solve it!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I’m just an amateur who knows nothing. How would I know how to solve it?” Master Xu, you can solve it based on your experience! If it really increases, I’ll give you red packets!” Master Xu smiled and said,””Then I’ll thank the boss first!” With Xia ruofei’s permission, master Xu started to cut the stone. The one that cost 250000 Yuan was the most expensive, so he put it aside first and picked one from the other two raw stones. He carefully observed it for a while and then fixed it on the stone cutter. The machine started to make noise, and the few customers in the shop also came over. As long as someone was cutting the stone, they would definitely be there to watch. Master Xu operated the machine, and with a sharp grinding sound, a corner of the raw stone was cut off. Then, master Xu found some clean water to clean the cut surface. A series of sighs could be heard. There was no green in the Kasaya. Master Xu was already used to this. He continued to adjust the angle and opened a new window. There was still no sign of green. After opening three windows in a row, master Xu fixed the raw stone in place and then cut it open at the waist. It was still all grey. “It’s broken!” “This raw stone is worth tens of thousands, this young man has made a loss ...” The spectators began to discuss. On the other hand, Xia ruofei still had a faint smile on his face as if losing tens of thousands of Yuan was not a big deal. Boss Chen observed Xia ruofei’s expression and was even more certain that Xia ruofei was a rich young master. Next, the process of cutting the second raw stone was similar. Master Xu first cut a few Windows, but when there was no green, he cut it directly. Naturally, this piece had also been cut. The onlookers sighed even louder. Some of them even looked at Xia ruofei sympathetically. In just a short while, hundreds of thousands of Yuan had gone down the drain! Of course, there were also some people who were gloating. Xia ruofei’s face was still as calm as an ancient well without any fluctuations in emotion. Master Xu saw that he had cut two pieces in a row and couldn’t help but look at Xia ruofei questioningly. Xia ruofei smiled and said,”master Xu, please continue!” There’s still one more that hasn’t been opened!” Master Xu didn’t say anything. He nodded and began to carefully observe the 250000 – Yuan raw stone. This raw stone weighed more than 30 pounds and was about the size of a washbasin. However, its appearance was not very good, and there was a groove – like crack on the surface. Perhaps for this reason, the price was a little low. The onlookers shook their heads when they saw this raw stone. They felt that it was not as good as the previous two raw stones in all aspects, except that it was bigger than the previous two. Everyone felt that this raw stone would probably be cut into pieces. At this time, master Xu had almost finished looking. He adjusted the angle of the machine, moved the raw stone up and fixed it in place, and then started the machine to cut along the crack. After a short while, the cracked stone Skin was cut off into a very thin piece. The price of this raw stone was relatively high, so master Xu was relatively cautious. After removing the raw stone from the stone cutter, master Xu went to find clean water to clean the cut surface. In fact, no one, including master Xu himself, had much confidence in this stone. However, when the clear water washed over the cut surface, an intoxicating green color appeared in front of everyone. At this moment, the scene suddenly quieted down, and only the sound of heavy breathing could be heard ...
