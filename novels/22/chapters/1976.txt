Hearing this, Xia ruofei’s spirit was lifted. He said in surprise,””You’re done so quickly? Isn’t it troublesome to import live animals?”

Old Blake laughed and said,”Mr. Xia, please rest assured. The black family will take care of all the procedures. You just need to wait for the goods to be received. We can ship them to any port in China. You just need to state your needs!”

“That’s great! Thank you very much, Mr. Blake!” Xia ruofei said,”by the way, the truffles for you may take one to two days to prepare. Please wait patiently!”

“Wow! It’s already much more efficient than I thought! Mr. Xia, I’ll have my family send the truffles back first. I’ll be in Hong Kong waiting for your good news!” Old Blake said happily.

“OK!”Xia ruofei said,”I’ll send you the delivery address later. I’ll have to trouble you with the batch of young geese!”

“No problem at all!” Old Blake said.

After hanging up the phone, Xia ruofei thought for a while and decided to receive the batch of young geese at Sanshan airport. He sent a text message to old Blake.

Next, Xia ruofei gave pang Hao a call. He wanted to invite him for dinner, but he was sweeping the streets with Feng Jing and the others. As the only two men in the team, Feng Jing and the others could not order Xia ruofei around, so he had to take on the glorious task of carrying bags.

His subordinates were not at the hotel, so Xia ruofei decided to order and eat in the Presidential Suite.

Just as he was flipping through the menu, the Butler of the Presidential Suite, Tony, knocked on the door and entered. He bowed slightly and said,””Mr. Xia, there’s a Mr. Bastian and Ms. Cheng Xiaoxiao outside asking for an audience. They say they know you.”

Xia ruofei knew that Bastian must be thinking about the truffles. If he remembered correctly, the corner Western restaurant chain almost got nothing at the auction.

“Yes, let them in!” He nodded and said.

“Understood!” Tony bowed and turned to leave.

“Wait a moment!” Xia ruofei stopped Tony.”Tony, please bring me three sets of the set meal and send them here directly!”

“Alright!” Tony said.

After a while, Tony led Bastian and Cheng Xiaoxiao in. The two of them were shocked by the luxury of the Presidential Suite, and their expressions were a little reserved.

Xia ruofei sat on the sofa in the living room and smiled.””Mr. Bastian, Xiaoxiao, please take a seat!”

Bastian finally came back to his senses.

The two of them sat opposite Xia ruofei, and Bastian said,””Mr. Xia, congratulations. This auction was a great success!”

“Thank you!” Xia ruofei smiled.”Mr. Bastian, don’t worry. The truffle I promised you will be ready. Do you want to do the trade in Hong Kong or after we return to the three mountains?”

Bastian’s spirit was immediately roused, and he hurriedly said,”We can all do it! Let’s see how Mr. Xia can do it more conveniently!”

“It’s convenient for both. I’m going to trade truffles with the black family in Hong Kong in two days.” Xia ruofei said,”if you don’t have any problems, we can do the transaction in Hong Kong. However, we will have to wait for a day or two!”

“Yes! I can!” Bastian quickly said,”we’re staying at Hengfeng Jiahua Hotel. We’ll be waiting for your news!”

Truffles were in high demand at this auction. Although Bastian had made preparations for the difficult situation, he still did not find anything. There were one or two truffles that he felt had a chance of winning, but in reality, he knew that there was no chance at all when he first started bidding. The price was rising too quickly.

Therefore, Bastian had placed all his hopes on the truffles that Xia ruofei had promised him. Although the company’s headquarters did not have much hope for this auction, if they really did not get anything, they would be labeled as incompetent. Then, it would be impossible for him to be promoted and transferred back to the headquarters.

Hence, Xia ruofei’s words were like a calming pill for him. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Then, Bastian asked carefully,””Mr. Xia, if you don’t mind me asking, how much truffles can we buy this time? Can you give me a rough number? I need to give a reply to the headquarters and prepare the funds for the acquisition in advance ...”

Xia ruofei did some calculations and said,””Ten or twenty kilograms! A minimum of ten kilograms! I’ll prepare as much as I can for you, but it shouldn’t be more than 30 kilograms. I wonder if such a quantity ...”

“It’s enough! That’s enough!” Bastian quickly said,”Mr. Xia, thank you so much!”

This amount had already exceeded Bastian’s expectations. Even if it was only ten kilograms, with the high quality of the truffles from paradise Corporation as always, it would definitely not be a problem for Bastian to go back and report on his work. It could even be said to be an unexpected surprise.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Mr. Bastian, you’re too polite. I’m just doing business!” It’s a mutually beneficial thing. I can also make money by selling it to you! Besides, Xiaoxiao is my die – hard fan, so we’re not outsiders. ”

This was the second time Xia ruofei had specifically mentioned Cheng Xiaoxiao in front of Bastian. Bastian was a smart person, so how could he not understand?

He understood what she meant and glanced at Cheng Xiaoxiao, saying,””Mr. Xia, Cheng is a very outstanding employee in our Western restaurant. She has done her job very well, so I have decided to promote her to the foreman of the restaurant when I return!”
