Chapter 1418: Personally on stage (2)

Translator: 549690339

“Oh ...” Lin Qiao stuck out her tongue and walked up to the stage with a red face under everyone’s kind laughter. She received the prize with several other lucky employees.

“Brother ruofei, how about ... I give you this phone!” When Lin Qiao passed by Xia ruofei’s table, she stopped and said,”my phone is still new. I don’t need to change it ...”

“I don’t need it either ...” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I think you should just get a new phone!” You can give godmother the one she used before. Teach her how to use the internet and video chat while you’re at it. I think it’s necessary for her to get a new smartphone so that she can video call you when she misses you in the future. ”

Lin Qiao felt that Xia ruofei’s suggestion was good, so she smiled and said,””Alright then! I’ll listen to you!”

The annual meeting continued and the lucky draw segment came one after another. Everyone was both nervous and excited.

The employees who had won the prize before were also laughing and watching the show, paying attention to whether their colleagues around them had won.

After the 15 iPhone 8s, the third prize was 10 Mac laptops. The value of the prize had reached more than 10000 Yuan.

As expected, Feng Jing was right. For the next few awards, the off – site staff’s winning rate also increased. Out of the 10 Apple laptops, five of them were won by off – site staff.

The number of staff present today was almost twice that of the staff who were not present. Half of the third prize was drawn by the off – site staff, which was a very high probability.

After the third prize was given out, Liu Qian returned to the stage.

She looked at the staff in the banquet hall with a smile and said,””My dear colleagues, I can see that the atmosphere of the annual meeting is already very lively! Next, let’s add some fuel to the fire! Let’s give a round of warm applause to the company’s chairman, Mr. Xia ruofei. President Xia will be personally bringing a performance to everyone!”

As soon as Liu Qian’s voice fell, thunderous applause sounded in the hall, accompanied by screams, as if a big star had appeared.

Xia ruofei smiled and stood up. He adjusted his suit and buttoned it up. Then, he walked onto the stage and took the microphone from Liu Qian.

Xia ruofei didn’t say anything. He only nodded at the staff in charge of the mixer.

A melodious folk song started playing. Xia ruofei slowly brought the microphone to his mouth and his expression became extremely calm.

Mom was sitting in front of the door.

Humming the flower and youth

Although many years had passed,

He remembered her tears.

......

This was a familiar folk song by Xu Wei. Xia ruofei’s voice was a little low, similar to Xu Wei ‘s, but not a complete imitation.

Especially after he had cultivated the great Dao Arts, his voice had naturally become more touching. It was just like how his appearance was not considered handsome, but it made people feel very comfortable.

Everyone was unknowingly attracted by Xia ruofei’s voice.

Soon, they came to the chorus. Xia ruofei, who had been singing in a low voice, suddenly raised his pitch.

Life is not as simple as the present.

And poetry and the distant fields

You came to the world empty – handed Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

In order to find that sea, he would do anything.

......

I walk further and further away alone

There’s a teenager at my knees.

The young man grew up day by day.

One day when I have to leave home

......

When Xia ruofei sang this part, Feng Jing and Lin Qiao, who were in the audience, felt their hearts skip a beat as if they had seen the future. Their hearts started to beat faster and their minds were controlled ...

It wasn’t until the song ended and the staff applauded that the two of them came back to their senses, and their faces were flushed.

The reviews for this song on the internet were mixed. The main criticism was because of the lyrics, and many people began to make fun of it, such as “life is not just a temporary one,””a long – term one” and so on.

However, it was undeniable that the song had a positive meaning and Xia ruofei’s performance was very successful. The applause was not because of his status as the chairman, but from the bottom of their hearts.

Xia ruofei waited for the applause to die down before he smiled and said,””This song is dedicated to all of our colleagues. I also hope that we can accompany each other all the way and walk together into the distance that belongs to our paradise Corporation!”

“Thank you, director Xia! Well said!” Liu Qian said.

Then, she revealed a sweet smile and said,””Next, we will invite President Xia to draw the five second prize winners for us. Of course, before that, I would like to ...”

“Student Liu Qian, if you keep us in suspense, you’re going to anger the public!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”that’s why I’ve decided not to give you the chance. I’ll announce the second prize myself!”

“Hahaha!”

“There’s finally someone who can deal with her!”

“Well done, President Xia!”

The employees were also making a ruckus.

Liu Qian pretended to be aggrieved and said,”President ... I’m doing this for the show’s effect,”

Then, she immediately smiled and said,”President Xia, please tell everyone what the second prize is tonight!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”okay!” I’m sure everyone has seen the special glass room next to the stage, right?”

There was a small glass room at the side of the stage. It was similar to a shower room in the bathroom. Everyone noticed it as soon as they entered the banquet hall, and many wondered what it was for.

Now that Xia ruofei had mentioned it, it seemed that the second prize was related to The Glass Room.

The employees started to make guesses.

Xia ruofei didn’t beat around the bush and said directly,””Our second prize will be given out in cash directly. However, how much you can get will depend on your ability!”

Xia ruofei pointed at The Glass Room and said,””The colleague who is chosen will get a chance to enter The Glass Room to’ fish for money ‘. We will put in at least 150000 Yuan in cash. The winning colleague needs to use a net bag. However much money he can get in 30 seconds is his!”

“Waa!”

“Awesome!”

“President Xia really doesn’t lack money! This award is interesting!”

The employees all started clapping.

Xia ruofei laughed.”This award is purely about giving out money. There won’t be any air blower or anything like that. There won’t be any net either. In short, there’s no trick. How much you earn will depend on your skills!”

Everyone laughed out loud, and a bolder employee said,””President Xia, let’s draw the lottery! We can’t wait!”

“God, please let me hit the jackpot!”

“I was wondering why I didn’t win anything earlier. So this award was waiting for me!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”let’s cut the chit – chat and start the lottery!” Liu Qian, bring the prize box over!”

“They’re coming!” Liu Qian quickly walked to the center of the stage with the lottery box in her arms.

Xia ruofei took the lucky draw box and shook it a few times. Then, he reached in and stirred it a few times before he finally pulled out a ticket.

Xia ruofei pretended to pass the lottery ticket to Liu Qian. Just as Liu Qian reached out her hand, Xia ruofei pulled it back.

“I’ve decided to announce the winning numbers myself!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Seeing Liu Qian, who had been keeping everyone in suspense the whole night, being played by Xia ruofei, the staff felt that it was especially funny.

Liu Qian also showed a wronged look and said,””President Xia, if you don’t want to give me the lottery ticket, can you not reach out to me?”

Xia ruofei blinked and said innocently,””I just wanted to raise my hand to see what time it was ...”

“Hahaha!” The staff couldn’t hold it in any longer and burst into laughter.

After making a small joke, Xia ruofei returned to the main topic. He switched the ticket to his left hand and reached in with his right hand. He stirred a few times and drew the second ticket.

Then, the third, fourth, and fifth.

All five vouchers were drawn out. Everyone’s heart started to beat faster and their eyes were all on the vouchers in Xia ruofei’s hands.
