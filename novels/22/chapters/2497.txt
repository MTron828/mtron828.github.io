2498 On the hot search again (1)

When the plane took off again, there were about five hours left on the flight. Xia ruofei did not return to the bedroom in the back cabin to rest. He sat in his seat with Dong Yun and the other staff, enjoying the red wine that was prepared on the plane and chatting casually.

The employees had been on the plane for five to six hours, but they didn’t feel tired at all. However, everyone had passed the initial stage of novelty and no longer looked around like they were visiting a Grand View Garden.

The bravest of them all, shi wen, was sitting on the long sofa beside Xia ruofei. She blinked her big eyes and said,”Chairman, your performance in life to look forward to was great! Especially the magic show, it was simply too magical! A lot of people on the internet said that it was edited for the show’s effect, but teacher he, teacher Huang, and Pengpeng all vouched for it with their integrity. The magic show’s process was not cut at all, and now the internet is in an uproar!”

“Has the show started broadcasting?” Xia ruofei asked, surprised.

“You didn’t see it yourself?” Shi wen asked in surprise.

Xia ruofei laughed dryly,”no one told me!” I guess the Jie Ji group has forgotten about me ...”

“That’s not right!” Shi wen said,”I even saw you interacting with the festival Group on Weibo yesterday!”

Xia ruofei was even more embarrassed. At this moment, Dong Yun turned to him and said,””The Chairman’s account is maintained by Qin Yanan and the others. I guess the chairman hasn’t logged in to his Weibo for a long time!”

Xia ruofei nodded unnaturally and said,””It’s true that I don’t really use social media ...”

“Chairman, please take a look now!” Shi wen quickly said. The topic of your magic show has even made it to the top search on Weibo! By the way, I just posted a photo with paradise and tagged you! Please forward it or reply to it! This way, I can also gain some fans!”

“Xiao Shi,” Xia ruofei said with a half – Smile,”the latter part is your main purpose, right?”

“It’s just ... Just by the way ...”Shi wen pursed her lips and smiled.

Xia ruofei stretched and said,””Alright! I’m free anyway ...”

After saying that, he took out his phone and opened the Weibo app. Although the Wi – Fi speed on the plane was not as fast as the 4G network on the ground, as long as he was not watching videos, the average page could be opened after loading for a short while.

Xia ruofei took a look. As expected, there were so many messages that he couldn’t count them. The red corner sign no longer showed the specific number.

He checked his Weibo first and found that he had indeed reposted the news released by the life I’m looking forward to the night before. He also had an interaction with Peng Peng about how Peng Chang kept pestering him to learn magic.

And the topic #President Xia’s magic show #had actually reached the third most searched spot on Weibo.

Xia ruofei clicked on the topic page and saw that it was indeed in full swing. There were thousands of Weibo posts about this topic today. Both sides had their own arguments. Everyone had their own reasons. They analyzed the magic technique, the principle of the three Immortals return to cave, and so on. In the end, they came to opposite conclusions.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but mumble to himself,’how free are people these days? Such a small thing actually made it to the hot search ...”

“I’ve realized that anything related to the chairman can easily get on the hot search list. Is the chairman the legendary ‘hot search physique’?” Dong Yun said with a smile.

Shi wen pursed her lips and smiled.”Chairman, your words will attract hatred. I don’t know how many celebrities have tried to stir up scandals and scandals just for the last trending search, but it’s extremely difficult!”

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”you’re too concerned about gains and losses. It’s not a good result.” What was this called? The flowers planted with a heart did not bloom, but the Willows planted without a heart grew into shade! Hahaha!”

“Look at how proud our Chairman is!” Dong Yun said with a smile.

Dong Yun’s words made the staff in the cabin burst into laughter.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and sent a Weibo message on his phone.

The content was very simple: “I saw everyone discussing the little magic trick I performed on the show. Actually, there’s really no editing. In a few days, when I have time, I can post the full video of this magic trick. I also welcome everyone to watch and see if it can be disclosed.”

The Weibo post was filled with the topic #President Xia’s magic show #, and the life I’m looking forward to was tagged along with the festival team, He Jiong, Huang Lei, Peng Chang, and the others.

After sending the message, Xia ruofei didn’t bother about it anymore. Instead, he looked at shi wen and asked,””Xiao Shi, what’s your Weibo ID? There are too many people tagging me backstage, it’s really hard to find, I’ll just search directly!”

Shi wen said, a little embarrassed,”My ... My ID is ‘refined little field flower’...”

Xia ruofei raised her eyebrows and asked,””The flower of the factory?”

“It’s not a factory! It’s a farm!” Shi wen hurriedly reminded him, her small face also blushing.

This ID clearly implied that she wanted to be the most beautiful girl on Peach Blossom Farm. Saying it in front of so many people was really too embarrassing ...

“Oh ...” Xia ruofei dragged out his words.

“Si Wen isn’t the word in my name, it’s SI Wen ...” Shi wen quickly reminded him.

“Refined beast! Am I right?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

Shi wen stomped her feet in embarrassment and said coyly,”Chairman ...”CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m
