Chapter 972: The authentic Buddha Jumps Over the Wall (2)

Translator: 549690339

It turned out that Xia ruofei’s decision was correct.

Hu Zi’s mother brought Xia ruofei around the town for a few rounds and bought most of the ingredients.

They were all from the same village. Hu Zi’s mother knew very well which family had a precious Jade pillar and where the high – Quality sea cucumbers were.

Very quickly, Xia ruofei checked the list. He was only missing shark’s fin, abalone, and pig’s trotters.

When Hu Zi’s mother brought Xia ruofei to a pork stall and bought two pig trotters, it was already close to noon.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”godmother!” I’ve basically got everything I wanted. It’s all thanks to you this time. Otherwise, I would’ve been in the dark, and I don’t know how much more work I would’ve had to do!”

Hu Zi’s mother laughed and asked,”RUO Fei, are you preparing the materials for the Buddha Jumps Over the Wall?”

As a native of the three mountains, Hu Zi’s mother had already guessed Xia ruofei’s intention when she saw the ingredients he had purchased.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”yeah!” I’m helping a friend. ”

Hu ‘Zi’s mother was a little confused and said,””I think we’re still lacking abalone and shark’s fin? These are the two most important ingredients for the Buddha Jumps Over the Wall soup. ”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”my friend has already prepared these two ingredients. Godma, let’s go!” I’ll send you back to the farm first, then I’ll send these things to my friend. ”

Hu Zi’s mother reproached,”it’s just a few steps away. There’s no need to send me off. I’ll just take a minibus back!” You should go and do your business!”

“No, no, no!” Xia ruofei quickly said,”how can I let you squeeze into the minibus?”

Hu ‘Zi’s mother laughed and said,”ruofei, godmother’s body isn’t that delicate!” In the past, we had to walk on such a small road. Now that the conditions are better, we can even take a car! You can go! Don’t worry about me, I’m very familiar with this place!”

Xia ruofei could only nod helplessly and say,””Alright then! But don’t take the bus, I’ll call a taxi for you!”

After that, Xia ruofei did not care about Hu Zi’s mother’s objection and waved for a taxi.

There was no need to use a meter to rent a car in a small county. The driver asked for 50 yuan to go from the county to Taoyuan farm. Xia ruofei did not bargain and took out his wallet. He took out a 50 yuan bill and handed it to the driver.”Sir, drive slower on the road!”

With that, Xia ruofei opened the car door and let Hu Zi’s mother in.

Hu Zi’s mother did not want to take a taxi, but Xia ruofei had already paid for it, so she could only shake her head helplessly and get into the car.

“You child, aren’t you wasting money ...” She mumbled as she got into the car.

Xia ruofei smiled and waved at Hu Zi’s mother. After watching the taxi leave, he turned around and got into his Knight XV off – Road vehicle.

Now, the only ingredients were shark’s fin and abalone. Xia ruofei had high – Quality mesh abalone in his Qzone.

However, the ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ required dried abalone as the taste of dried abalone and fresh abalone was very different. Therefore, when Xia ruofei decided to make ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ in the office in the morning, he directly used his divine thoughts to inform Xia Qing in the space to catch five reticulated abalones in the sea in the space.

Although the abalones in the space ocean were still far from being one – headed and two – headed abalones, they were more than enough to make the ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’.

The process of making dried abalones was not complicated, and it was not difficult for Xia Qing. Even if the dried abalones she made were not up to the standard of an abalone master, they were enough to make the Buddha Jumps Over the Wall soup.

Moreover, the reticulated abalone grew in a spirit map space rich in Reiki. The dried abalone was also dried in an environment rich in Reiki, which was enough to make up for the lack of skill in the production process.

It would take at least ten days to make dried abalones, so Xia ruofei informed Xia Qing to start making them in the medium in the morning.

After making the dried abalones, he would boil them in the water of the spirit pool. The time was just right.

As for the last ingredient, shark’s fin, Xia ruofei drove directly to the biggest Walmart in the county and bought the most expensive shark’s fin from the brand counter. With that, he had all the ingredients.

Then, Xia ruofei went to the market and bought a small wine jar to simmer the Buddha Jumps Over the Wall soup, Shaoxing old wine, and some other seasonings.

Of course, he did not forget to buy a bag of charcoal and a few charcoal stoves.

Everything was ready, except for the crucial wind.

Xia ruofei drove back to the farm.

On the way, he kept all these things into his spatial space. Some of the ingredients needed time to be prepared, and he also informed Xia Qing to start preparing them with his spiritual sense.

It was almost lunchtime when he returned to the farm.

When Hu Zi’s mother saw Xia ruofei come in empty – handed, she naturally thought that he had sent all the ingredients to his friend. So, she smiled and invited Xia ruofei to have lunch.

Perhaps Lin Qiao felt that time was tight, so she didn’t come back for lunch today. Instead, she had a meal in the company cafeteria and then went back to the office without taking a break.

Xia ruofei quickly finished two bowls of rice and one bowl of soup. He pulled out a tissue and wiped his mouth.”Godmother, I’m done eating. You can eat slowly!”

After he finished speaking, Xia ruofei ran upstairs.

Hu ‘Zi’s mother smiled and muttered to herself,””This child is always in a rush. I don’t know what he’s busy with ...”

Once Xia ruofei returned to his room, he locked the doors and windows. Then, he took out the spirit painting scroll and entered the medium.

He still had about five hours left. If he stayed at the Archean realm, he would have about 12 to 13 days, which was enough for him to prepare all the ingredients and make the Buddha Jumps Over the Wall soup.

When he entered the medium, Xia Qing was busy preparing the ingredients. When he saw Xia ruofei, he quickly stopped to greet him.

Xia ruofei nodded and asked,”have you distributed the sea cucumbers?”

It was about a 20 – minute drive from the county to the farm. Xia ruofei then had lunch. In total, two days had passed in the Archean realm.

“Yes, Master.” Xia Qing nodded and said,”all the ingredients that need to be prepared have been dealt with. It’s just that the abalone can’t be cooked so quickly for the time being.”

The abalone needed to be made into dried abalones first before being cooked. It would take at least ten to twenty days, and they were still in the process of drying the abalones!

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it’s okay. We can make it.” I’ll deal with the other ingredients first!”

Xia qingfa’s ingredients were neatly placed on the long table. In the spirit map space, as long as they did not touch the ground, they would not go bad no matter how long they were placed there. So, Xia ruofei did not have to worry about keeping them fresh.

He began to process the pigeon eggs, pig trotters, flower mushrooms, and other ingredients.

The skin of a pigeon’s egg was as thin as paper and had to be handled very carefully. However, Xia ruofei’s spiritual power was very strong and he had no problem controlling it.

He steamed the pigeon eggs with the core of the Jinhua ham to give off the umami of the ham. At the same time, he steamed the ham into the pigeon eggs.

After that, he cut the ham into pieces, peeled the pigeon eggs, and fried them with warm oil into Tiger – Skin pigeon eggs.

Xia ruofei’s speed was very fast, just like a chef ‘s.

The processed ingredients were placed to the side, and he began to process the next type.

Free – range chicken, free – range duck, hoof tips, lamb elbows, pig stomach, duck gizzards ...

The Buddha Jumps Over the Wall soup had dozens of ingredients of various sizes, and each ingredient had a different processing method. There were all kinds of frying and frying. It could be said that just processing the ingredients was a huge project.

After all of them were processed, he just had to wait for the abalone.

Xia ruofei said to Xia Qing,”I’m going out to take a nap. When the dried abalones are ready, you can distribute them. Let me know when you’re done!”

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing replied respectfully.

With a thought, Xia ruofei left the medium and kept the painting in his palm. He then went to bed and slept for a while.

At around fouro’ clock in the afternoon, Xia Qing used her spiritual sense to report to Xia ruofei that the abalone had been processed.

Hence, Xia ruofei’s spirits were lifted. He jumped up from his bed, summoned the spirit map scroll, and returned to the medium.UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m
