Chapter 571: It’s really you_3

“How can I do that?” Boss Qian said as he rubbed his hands, his expression slightly uneasy.

That was indeed the case. If it was anyone else who received such a big favor from others for no reason, if they didn’t express anything, they would indeed feel bad in their hearts.

Qian Lijun also said,”ruofei, why don’t you let us express our gratitude?” Regardless of the weight of the gift, it’s still a token of our sincerity!”

“Yeah, yeah, yeah,” boss Qian quickly said,”ruofei, where’s your friend?” Li Jun and I will definitely pay him a visit to thank him!”

Xia ruofei said helplessly,”uncle Qian, there’s really no need ... My friend doesn’t care about these things ... Why don’t we do this?” I’ll give him a call now and convey your gratitude ...”

Xia ruofei did not wait for boss Qian and Qian Lijun to speak. He took out his phone and dialed song Rui’s number. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Boss Qian and Qian Lijun looked at each other and tactfully moved to the side.

“RUO Fei!” Song Rui’s loud voice came through the phone.

“Young master Song, thank you!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”my friend has already received the money that was scammed. You’re quite efficient this time. You deserve praise!”

Song Rui was stunned for a moment before he came back to his senses. He asked,””Is everything done?”

“You don’t even know?” Xia ruofei did not know whether to laugh or cry.

“Hey! I didn’t care about this after the call!” Song Rui said nonchalantly,”he’s just an old liar. Do I have to go back to xiangnan to meet him personally?”

Xia ruofei thought about it and agreed. With song Rui’s status, wouldn’t he have hundreds of different ways to deal with an old scoundrel like Liu Jinsheng? He had casually greeted Liu Jinsheng, and if he did not die, he would have lost a layer of his skin.

......

“No matter what, this is all thanks to you!” Xia ruofei said seriously,”my friend’s family is also very grateful to you. They asked me to call them to convey their gratitude.”

“I’m doing you a favor by helping you ...” Song Rui rolled his eyes and said,”if you want to thank someone, let them thank you!”

Xia ruofei also knew song Rui’s carefree personality. He smiled and asked,””By the way, did you spend any money on this? Do you need me to reimburse you?”

“You’re smacking my face!” Song Rui immediately shouted,”do I need to spend money on such a small matter? Aren’t you underestimating me too much?”

“Then you didn’t casually use your father’s men to help you do this, right?” Xia ruofei was still worried and asked again. Then, he said with a smile,”don’t get scolded by uncle song because you’re doing something for me. I’ll feel guilty then!”

“No, I didn ‘t! I don’t have any!” Song Rui said,”I just greeted a few familiar friends! Ruofei, if you have nothing else, I’m hanging up! I still have to attend a meeting at the company later!”

“Hey! You’re really addicted to pretending to be an obedient baby!” Xia ruofei said,”fine! I won’t disturb you then, bye!”

After hanging up the phone, Xia ruofei walked towards Mr. Qian and his son with a smile.

In fact, boss Qian and Qian Lijun didn’t stay too far away, and Xia ruofei didn’t deliberately lower his voice. Therefore, although they didn’t mean to eavesdrop, they still heard some words.

For example, when Xia ruofei addressed him as “young master Song”, he seemed to have vaguely mentioned “young master song’s” father.

Boss Qian was also very curious about the identity of this “young master Song”. It sounded like this noble was most likely the son of a high – ranking official. There were not many high – ranking officials in Hunan with the surname song, but the most powerful one was undoubtedly the provincial head judge, song Zhengping ...

Could it be that Xia ruofei’s friend was the son of the head judge of the song Jin province?

Boss Qian’s heart was also in a great uproar. He thought about it, it seemed that only a noble with this identity could make Liu Jinsheng so obedient.

Even if that “young master Song” was not the son of provincial head judge song, his status must be quite noble. Otherwise, it would be impossible for him to handle the matter so beautifully and perfectly so easily.

Thinking of this, boss Qian looked at Xia ruofei, who was walking towards him with a smile on his face. His gaze was a little different, and there was even a hint of respect in his eyes ...
