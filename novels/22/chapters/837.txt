Chapter 838: High – Quality wormgrass (2)

Translator: 549690339

However, this was not an absolute standard of judgment. The quality of the wormgrass itself was also very important.

Xia ruofei nodded slightly. He opened the bag of Cordyceps that Gesang had pointed out.

Gesang said,”look, Mr. Xia. The worm has a yellow and clean surface, and the ring pattern on its back is very clear. There are eight pairs of legs in the abdomen, four of which are obvious in the middle. The color of the front three pairs of legs is darker, and the brownish – Red eyes on the head can be clearly seen. The color of the grass head is also very straight. It is definitely the most authentic Cordyceps.”

Suolang renzeng didn’t say anything. He just looked at Gesang selling wormgrass to Xia ruofei with a trace of relief. It seemed that Gesang was deliberately training his child.

Xia ruofei nodded his head as he listened. From time to time, he would pick up a piece of worm grass and put it in front of his eyes to look at it carefully. He seemed to be very serious.

Neither Gesang nor Solang renzeng noticed that one of the wormgrass in the bag had disappeared into thin air.

There were at least one or two thousand wormgrass in the whole bag, so it was impossible to be discovered if one was missing.

Xia ruofei had sent the wormgrass into the spirit map space without anyone knowing. At the same time, he communicated with Xia Qing with his divine thoughts, asking him to immediately identify the quality of the wormgrass.

Xia ruofei chatted leisurely with Gesang while waiting for Xia Qing’s test results.

Soon, Xia Qing gave Xia ruofei the feedback. As expected, this wormgrass was of the best quality among all the wormgrass that Xia ruofei had bought today. It also had obvious characteristics, indicating that it was indeed produced in the Nagqu City of Tibet.

The wormgrass in Naqu had some distinctive features, such as yellow and clean Color, even fertilizer, bright and smooth, and a strong butter fragrance. It was easy for people in the know to judge.

After getting a positive answer from Xia Qing, Xia ruofei didn’t hesitate and said directly,””Gesang, your wormgrass is really good. If the price is right, I’ll take them all.”

Gesang was overjoyed. He nodded and continued,”Mr. Xia, thank you! I still have a few smaller ones here ...”

“Gesang!” Suolang renzeng, who had been silent all this time, suddenly said,”Mr. Xia wants the best wormgrass. You don’t have to take out your Level 2 and Level 3 grass.”

Xia ruofei smiled and looked at Solang renzeng. He felt that this middle – aged Tibetan was quite interesting. Judging from GE sang’s age, Solang renzeng was at most in his forties. However, he looked a little old after living on the plateau for so many years. The vicissitudes of time were written on his face. At the same time, he seemed very wise. His muddy eyes seemed to be able to see through all the changes in the world.

“Oh!” Gersun nodded in disappointment.

Then he immediately thought that if Xia ruofei bought all the level 1 grass, he would be able to earn a lot of money, much more than what Zha Xi doji could make by force. At least, it would be enough to treat his father’s injury.

Therefore, gersun’s eyes quickly regained their warmth. He looked at Xia ruofei and said,””Mr. Xia, we sell level one grass for about 250000 Yuan per kilogram. If we buy it in your mainland, it will cost at least 300000 Yuan. If you are willing to buy all of it, I can give you 220000 Yuan per kilogram.”

Xia ruofei nodded to himself. He had done some research on the price of the high – grade Cordyceps. He knew that Gesang was not asking for an exorbitant price. The price was reasonable.

In fact, the 16888 Yuan gift box that Mr. Lin mentioned before contained Level 1 wormgrass. In terms of unit price, it was close to 340000 Yuan per kilogram.

Of course, this was only the price at the end of the channel. In the place where the wormgrass was produced, it was naturally not so expensive. The premise was that one had to be able to recognize the real and authentic wormgrass.

Under gersun’s expectant gaze, Xia ruofei nodded and said,””No problem! We’ll trade according to this price!”

Gesang immediately expressed his thanks in excitement, and Solang renzeng could not help but show a trace of excitement.

These wormgrass were his main harvest for the day. Although there were still some Level 2 and Level 3 grass, the most valuable ones were all here.

Solang renzeng was a well – known grass digger. Zashi doji had sent people to buy it several times, but he had been fooled by him with some inferior worms with the excuse of poor harvest this year.

Although zashi doji had his suspicions, Solang renzeng had dug up the level 1 grass himself and did not buy it from other relatives. In addition, gersun had hidden these treasures well. Later, Solang renzeng broke his leg, so zashi doji gave up reluctantly.

Gesang quickly weighed the wormgrass in front of Xia ruofei. It was 853 grams in total.

Gersun was calculating with a calculator and said,””Mr. Xia, let’s take it as 800 grams! It’s a total of 176000 Yuan. ”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””The number is correct, but I don’t have that much cash on me, and I’m sure you can’t use a card here. The banks are closed now, so we can only wait until tomorrow to withdraw the money before we carry out the transaction. ”

In reality, Xia ruofei had at least a million in cash in the realm. However, he could not take out the money on the spot. Otherwise, it would be too illogical. No one would bring so much cash out for an entire afternoon, especially in the unfamiliar Tibetan area.

Suolang renzeng was also a forthright person. He immediately said,””No problem. Where are you staying, Mr. Xia? I’ll have gersun send the wormgrass to you tomorrow. ”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”I started to shop at wormgrass Street as soon as I got off the car. I haven’t found a hotel yet!” Why don’t we exchange contact information? It wasn’t safe for gersun to take such precious wormgrass out. Besides, there were still people of zashidoji outside! Let’s do the trade here!”

“Alright!” Suolang renzeng said with a smile.

Gesang didn’t have a cell phone yet, so Xia ruofei and suo lang renzeng exchanged cell phone numbers. The number was an anonymous card that Xia ruofei had bought before he set off.

Xia ruofei entered suo lang renzeng’s phone number and dialed it. As soon as suo lang renzeng’s phone rang, Xia ruofei hung up the phone and said with a smile,””I really can’t find you here. I’ll text you after I’ve booked a hotel tonight. I’ll call you again tomorrow after I’ve withdrawn the money. Ask gersun to pick me up at the hotel.” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“No problem!” Suolang renzeng said readily.

He didn’t ask Xia ruofei to leave a down payment. It was obvious that this Tibetan man was very honest.

In fact, Xia ruofei had been secretly memorizing the route on the way here. For a former Special Forces elite, remembering the way was a basic skill. Even if gersun took him a few more rounds, he could clearly draw out the route in his mind.

However, Xia ruofei had something to talk to gersun about, and he could talk to him on the way from the hotel to his house. That was why he made this request.

One must know that Xia ruofei’s trip to Nagqu this time was not really to buy Cordyceps. He wanted to try to restore the environment in which the Cordyceps was formed in the spirit map space so that this precious Chinese medicinal herb could be produced continuously in the spirit map space.

Xia ruofei’s previous purchase of the Cordyceps was just a preparation.

Xia ruofei rejected gersun’s kind offer to send him out and left his house alone. He followed the route he remembered and walked to the street outside. He stopped a taxi and found a hotel called the Nagqu hotel.

In fact, this three – Star hotel was basically the best in Nagqu County.

After Xia ruofei checked in, he took a shower and played with his phone for a while before falling asleep.

The next day, he waited until nineo’ clock before calling Solang renzeng and telling him the hotel name and room number. At the same time, he took out 176000 Yuan in cash from his space, put it in a plastic bag, and stuffed it into his canvas bag.

Xia ruofei didn’t have to wait for long before the doorbell rang. Gersun had arrived.

Xia ruofei called for a taxi from the front desk and went to gersun’s house with him.

They alighted at the entrance of an alley. Xia ruofei paid the fare and walked into the alley with Gesang.

Gesang’s footsteps were light because what he was worried about did not happen. Xia ruofei kept her promise and informed him of the transaction after she withdrew the money.

Xia ruofei suddenly smiled and asked,”Gesang, I’d like to stay in Nagqu for a few more days. Can you be my guide?” I can pay you your salary. ”
