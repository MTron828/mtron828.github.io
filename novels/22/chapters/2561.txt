Netizens expressed sympathy for the programmer who was called up to work overtime at FiveO’ clock in the morning while he was hospitalized – as more information was disclosed, everyone knew that this “Lion that can attack the city” was hospitalized because of acute gastroenteritis – they didn’t expect that such a problem would occur after leaving work for only one day – so he could only helplessly work overtime on his laptop in the hospital.

The CEO of Weibo also personally confirmed this matter.

His Weibo ID “coming and going” was no longer a secret, and the netizens affectionately called him “boss Lai.”

“CEO Lai” replied to the many curious questions from the netizens and said that it was because Xia ruofei’s topic was so popular that there were too many people visiting and searching at the same time, causing the server to be stuck.

Some netizens were very curious and asked the Weibo technician how he managed to expand the server with a laptop in the ward.

“President Lai” also said without hiding anything, We rented the Cloud Virtual Machine urgently and logged out after a few hours of simultaneous visits. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

With the authoritative confirmation from the CEO of Weibo, the fact that Xia ruofei’s hat – trick in La Liga caused Weibo to be stuck was confirmed.

The netizens were also having a great time. They reposted “the lion that can attack the city” and “CEO Lai” ‘s Weibo posts and tagged Xia ruofei in groups.

When Xia ruofei returned to Barcelona, it was already close to midnight. He went back to the hotel to wash up and go to bed. He had no idea that the impact of the game was brewing on the Internet in China.

The next morning, after he woke up, he casually checked Weibo and found out about this.

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. However, he still posted on Weibo and tagged “the lion that can attack cities”.

Xia ruofei wrote on Weibo,”brother, I’m sorry. I didn’t expect to bring you so much trouble.” In order to express my apology, I want to give you the Jersey I wore in yesterday’s game. I’ll get all the players to sign it. Please send me your address.

On Weibo, Xia ruofei even attached a picture of the Jersey of the number 25 player.

Of course, this was a picture that he had downloaded from the club’s online store. After the match last night, the club’s management realized that Xia ruofei would definitely become very popular. So, they arranged for the store to put the number 25 Jersey with Xia ruofei’s name on the shelves for sale. Soon, physical stores would also start to sell this Jersey. It could be imagined that the sales would be very popular.

Xia ruofei’s own Jersey was taken away by the staff after he changed out of it in the changing room. Under normal circumstances, it would be cleaned and hung in the corresponding position in the changing room before Xia ruofei’s next match.

The management of the club had become more and more professional. The players did not need to worry about things like washing the jerseys and washing the shoes. They only needed to focus on playing well.

Xia ruofei’s popularity on the internet was no less than that of any hot young man. When his Weibo account released news, Weibo’s official Department was responsible for monitoring it. Moreover, the Weibo server almost went down because of him yesterday. Hence, Weibo naturally paid more attention to it.

“The lion that can attack cities” was an internal staff member of Weibo. Even though he was in the hospital, he received the news very quickly after Xia ruofei’s Weibo post.

The real name of “Lion that can attack the city” was ding Kai, and he was a programmer for Weibo.

He was very excited when he saw Xia on Weibo.

Ding Kai was not a hardcore fan, but if he had time, he would still watch football games, especially the national team’s games. He would watch the national football team as much as he could. Although many people scolded the national football team, it represented China after all. Many fans were sad about their misfortune and angry about their lack of competition, but at the same time, they could not help but want to watch the national football team’s games.

In fact, although ding Kai was called up to work overtime before dawn, he saw that it was because of the hat – trick of a Chinese player in La Liga that caused a large number of netizens to flood the Weibo platform and caused the jam. Moreover, the Chinese player was Xia ruofei, who had been on the hot search several times on the Weibo platform. Therefore, although ding Kai was tired from working while he was sick, he was in a very good mood. It could be said that he was tired and happy.

Seeing that Xia ruofei was going to give him the Jersey that he had worn during the match last night, ding Kai quickly sent Xia ruofei an address in a private message. The Jersey was too memorable. It was Xia ruofei’s first professional football game and the first hat – trick of a Chinese player in La Liga.

Furthermore, there would be signatures from the entire Spain first team above the ball, which would be even more memorable.

After Xia ruofei’s Weibo post, the netizens liked it one after another. They thought that this was what a high – Quality idol should do, even though Xia ruofei had never admitted that he was an idol.

After a while,”the lion that can attack cities” posted on Weibo. The content was: I’ve already sent the address to President Xia, but I didn’t expect President Xia to reply to me within seconds. I’m so touched!

The Weibo post was attached with a screenshot of “the lion that can attack the city” ‘s private message interface. Everyone could clearly see the conversation between Xia ruofei and him.

Of course, the detailed address was blurred out.

The lion that can siege: “director Xia, my address is *****.” In fact, I was just doing my job. It was a joke to complain on the internet. I didn’t expect the netizens to stir up this matter ...
