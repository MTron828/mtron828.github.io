Chapter 738: Rising to fame (2)

Hu ‘Zi’s mother was obviously very fond of Xia ruofei. Although Lin Hu was irreplaceable, Xia ruofei was like her son in her heart.

Therefore, Hu ‘Zi’s mother nodded heavily without much hesitation and said,””Ruofei, I acknowledge this godly marriage!”

Hearing this, Xia ruofei knelt down without saying anything and kowtowed three times. Then he raised his head and said,””Godmother!”

Hu Zi’s mother’s eyes were filled with tears, but a gratified smile appeared on her face. She loudly replied,””Woof! Good child, quickly get up ...”

Then, Hu Zi’s mother reached out and pulled Xia ruofei up from the ground.

Other than Xia ruofei’s three kowtows, there was no grand ceremony. However, the room was filled with warmth.

Xia ruofei’s sense of ceremony was in his heart. When he kowtowed three times and called out “godmother”, he seemed to see Lin Hu looking at him from the sky. He reached out and lightly hit his left chest. This was a gesture unique to the lone wolf assault team. It was encouraging and affirmative ...

“Ruofei, I’ll make a few more dishes later. Let’s have a good celebration ...” Hu Zi’s mother said, pleased.

“Mm! Godmother, drink some more wine!” Xia ruofei said with a smile. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Alright, everyone, drink a little ...”

“Godma, about the house ... You won’t blame me anymore, right?” Xia ruofei continued.

Hu Zi’s mother looked at Xia ruofei lovingly and said,””Godma has never blamed you. I know that you’re just being filial ... But you’re not allowed to waste money like this in the future. Qiao’ er and I can’t live in such a big house. Besides, a house in the city center is so expensive!”

Hu Zi’s mother also did not mention the transfer of ownership of the house to Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei knew that the little grudge in her heart no longer existed, so he smiled happily and said,””I know! I’m very familiar with President Liang of the jianda group. He sold it to me at a 20% discount on the opening price at the beginning of last year, which is more than 10000 Yuan cheaper than the surrounding real estate prices! It can be said to be worth it. ”

......

Hu Zi’s mother looked at Xia ruofei with a half – Smile and said,””You’re so close to CEO Liang, it should be easy for you to check out, right? Did you collude with him today?”

The smile on Xia ruofei’s face froze. He scratched his head in embarrassment.

Hu ‘Zi’s mother smiled and said,”alright!” I saw through it long ago, I just didn’t want to expose you at that time! RUO Fei, don’t worry! It’s rare that you’re so filial. Godmother isn’t a killjoy!”

Xia ruofei chuckled in embarrassment and said,””Godmother is still the most sensible!”

“Alright, alright. You must be tired after a busy morning. Go back to your room and take a rest!” Hu Zi’s mother smiled and said,”I’m going to change my clothes. It’s time to prepare lunch.”

“Woof! Alright ...”

After Xia ruofei unraveled the knot in his heart, he went back to his room with a peace of mind.

Neither he nor Hu Zi’s mother noticed that Lin Qiao’s expression seemed a little unnatural and even a little disappointed in the process of the warm and tender acknowledgment.

In the afternoon, Hu Zi’s mother had prepared a few dishes and Xia ruofei had brought out some white wine. The three of them had lunch together.

By now, Lin Qiao’s mood had returned to normal. She kept toasting Xia ruofei during dinner, saying that she had lost a brother and now God gave her another one. It was worth a big celebration.

Lin Qiao drank a lot during the meal, and she took the initiative to ask Xia ruofei to drink with her. Soon, her cheeks were flushed and her eyes became a little dazed. Hu Zi’s mother quickly stopped her from drinking.

“This child, she can drink too much at home ...” Hu Zi’s mother nagged as she helped Lin Qiao back to her room to rest.

Xia ruofei was still holding his glass and drinking by himself. After acknowledging his godmother, Xia ruofei felt that his thoughts were much more clear and he was in a very good mood.

He and Hu Zi’s mother didn’t notice the faint sadness in Lin Qiao’s eyes after she drank.

……

The payment for Taoyuan organic fruit was quickly transferred to the account of Taoyuan company.

Lychees were relatively better, but cherries had a very short shelf life, so they had to be sold immediately after harvesting.

Of course, this also reflected the popular sales of Taoyuan’s organic fruits.

Although the price was high, there were many rich people in this world. These fruits that looked and tasted great were sold out very quickly after they were put on the shelves.

Some comments about the Paradise Corporation also began to appear on the internet.

“I’m being extravagant today. I bought a box of organic cherries. It’s only 1000 grams, but it cost me 300 dollars! I regretted it the moment I bought it. I felt that I was really out of my mind to spend one – twentieth of my monthly salary on a box of cherries ... But after I went home and tasted them, I couldn’t stop! It was too F * cking delicious! Please forgive my lack of education, but I really can’t find any words to describe the deliciousness of this box of cherries! Anyway, the end result was ... I went to the Sam’s Club again and contributed one – tenth of my monthly salary ...”

This netizen used the word “too” three times in a row to describe the amazing feeling he had after eating the organic cherries of Taoyuan for the first time.
