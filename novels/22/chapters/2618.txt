2619 Heading to the green cloud Island (1)

Liu Qunfeng’s first reaction was to refuse, but when he heard the word “shares,” he couldn’t help but tremble. As the future leader of the Liu family, the last thing he wanted to see was nearly half of the shares of the family group being taken away.

This would bring about too many unstable factors.

Of course, regardless of whether Xia ruofei wanted the money or the green cloud Island, he was still very distressed.

Of the two evils, the lesser one was the shares.

Liu Qunfeng hesitated, then said,””Mr. Xia, you may not know the situation ... The blue cloud Island is actually not within the borders of Huaxia ...”

“I know,” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’ve already asked around. Green cloud Island is located in the South Pacific Ocean. It’s an Island that belongs to the agate Kingdom. However, the permanent ownership has been bought by the Liu family, right?”

The Liu family had managed an Island overseas with a strong defense. This was a secret to ordinary people, but it was impossible to hide it from the big families. Liu Qunfeng knew that Xia ruofei had already gotten the news from the song family.

“Yes ... That’s why ... The Azure cloud Island is a little far away, and my father’s current situation ...” He nodded.

“As far as I know, there’s a 3000 – meter long runway on the island, which is more than enough for private planes to take off and land.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”we can take my paradise and go there directly. One day will be enough. Elder Liu’s condition is still stable, and I have a few bags of medicine with me, so there’s no need to worry about his safety.”

The airport on Qingyun Island was not open to the public, but it was the Liu family’s own Island. Xia ruofei could land on the Paradise. This way, he did not need to transfer flights or change passenger ships from the Carnelian Island. He could take off from the capital and land on Qingyun Island. Although it seemed like a long distance, it would not take much time.

Since Xia ruofei had already said so, Liu Qunfeng naturally could not refuse.

“Mr. Xia, I’ll have to ask my father about this,” he said after some thought.

“Of course!” Xia ruofei smiled.”Then I’ll have to trouble you to ask for instructions as soon as possible, chief Liu!” Since elder Liu has already brought up this matter, I don’t want to drag it on any longer. It’s better to make a decision as soon as possible. If the inspection of green cloud Island can’t be carried out, then I may have to choose between three billion US dollars and 40% of the shares, and what my company doesn’t lack the most is cash flow ...”

“I’ll go ask for instructions now!” Liu Qunfeng quickly said,”Mr. Xia, please wait a moment.” Don’t worry, since my father proposed this plan, he definitely won’t refuse your inspection. The only thing he’s worried about is his own safety. I’ll tell him your judgment!”

“I’ll have to trouble you then, chief Liu. “Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.

“It’s no trouble at all!” Liu Qunfeng quickly replied,”of course! I should!”

Then, Liu Qunfeng walked quickly into old man Liu’s ward. Xia ruofei did not return to his room. Instead, he stood in the corridor and waited.

After a while, Liu Qunfeng pushed the door open and walked out.

He did not wait for Xia ruofei to speak and said with a smile,””Mr. Xia, the old man has agreed!”

Then, Liu Qunfeng immediately explained,””Because I’m a public official, the procedures are a bit troublesome, and I have to report it to the higher – ups, so the old man decided to let uncle Kuan go with you. Don’t worry, uncle Kuan will be able to represent my father when he’s there. ”

Liu Kuan was old man Liu’s chief butler. He had been with old man Liu for decades and could be said to be loyal. On the green cloud Island, Liu Kuan could indeed represent old man Liu. Since it was not convenient for Liu Qunfeng to leave the country, it was most appropriate for Liu Kuan to accompany Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei nodded with a smile and said,””Sure, chief Liu. Sorry for the trouble.”

“Where? Where!” Liu Qunfeng quickly said,”this is a very normal request. Even if you go to the market to buy vegetables, you still have to look at the quality of the vegetables! Not to mention such a big deal? Mr. Xia, when do you want to leave?”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,””Of course I hope it’ll be as soon as possible. Paradise will take off from Beijing tomorrow morning. I just don’t know if other things can be arranged. ”

“No problem!” Liu Qunfeng said without hesitation. We’ll coordinate the flight route. In addition, you can fly directly to Qingyun Island from China. You don’t need to apply for a visa for the Carnelian Island, and you don’t need to go through any entry procedures after landing!”

The Liu family had absolute ownership of green cloud Island, which was equivalent to taking it away from the map of the state of ponaattu. At least it was a country within a country, and the customs of the state of ponaattu had no jurisdiction over green cloud Island. As long as the Liu family agreed, anyone could enter the blue cloud Island directly without going through any procedures.

“What about when we leave from China?” Xia ruofei asked. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Just follow the normal domestic departure procedures.” Liu Qunfeng said,”in short, everything will be calculated according to domestic travel. There is no need to go through the border inspection process or go through the exit procedures.”

“Alright, that’s much more convenient!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.
