Chapter 335: The gardening club (1)

Xia ruofei rolled down the window and waved at Lu You and Jiang Yue. When Jiang Yue saw Xia ruofei, her eyes lit up and she quickened her pace. Lu You also subconsciously took two steps forward. Then, she seemed to have realized something and slowed down her pace. “Brother Xia, I’m sorry! “Sorry for making you wait ...” Jiang Yue said, a little embarrassed. “It’s okay, get in the car!” Xia ruofei said with a warm smile. Lu You and Jiang Yue both sat in the back of the pickup truck. Lu You pouted and said,”this car is too cheap!” You clearly have a good car, but you don’t drive it, pretending to be low – Key?” Xia ruofei said indifferently,”isn’t a car just a means of transportation?” It was good enough that it could be opened. Tell me, where are you going ...” Lu You glanced at Xia ruofei and said,””Just drive forward! It’s in the old Chemistry Department building. ” Xia ruofei started the car and drove in the direction that Lu You had pointed. “Big brother Xia, I brought you some breakfast. Have some first ...” Jiang Yue said softly. “I’ve already had breakfast ...” Xia ruofei noticed the disappointed expression on Jiang Yue’s face through the rearview mirror and his heart softened. He said,”but I’m a little hungry after driving for so long. Thank you!” Jiang Yue’s face immediately bloomed into a happy smile as she quickly handed the bag in her hand to Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei slowed down the car and reached out to take it. “”It’s the little steamed buns! Not bad, not bad ...” “Brother Xia, try it while it’s hot!” Jiang Yue said shyly. Xia ruofei nodded. He held the steering wheel with one hand and stuffed a steamed bun into his mouth with the other. As he chewed, he said,”yes, yes!” It tastes really good ... I didn’t expect the chef in your canteen to be so good at cooking!” Lu You rolled her eyes and said,”what canteen chef?” This is Li’s soup dumplings. Yueyue went out to line up at 6 p.m. To buy breakfast ...” The Li’s soup dumplings were a famous snack in Sanshan city. There was a long line of people who wanted to buy them every morning. They only sold 200 baskets a day and closed the stall after they were sold out, so it was not easy to buy them. Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment, and an unnatural expression appeared on his face. Jiang Yue’s face turned red from embarrassment and she interrupted Lu You’s words in a panic. She handed a cup of soy milk to the front and said,””Brother Xia, have some soy milk!” Xia ruofei reached out to take it and placed it on the cup holder beside his seat. Then, he said,”Thank you, Jiang Yue!” “You’re welcome!” Jiang Yue said with a shy smile. Very quickly, Xia ruofei drove the car to the designated location according to Lu You’s directions. This was a rather old teaching building. It was originally used by the chemistry Department. Now that the chemistry Department had moved to a new building, this place was under the use of the Student Union and some student clubs. Lu You and Jiang Yue were both members of Sanshan University’s gardening club. After the three of them got out of the car, they walked into the building together. Lu You said as they walked,””Xia ruofei, Yueyue and I are in charge of taking care of the orchid in our gardening club. There have been some problems recently. Please help us take a look at it!” “Brother Xia, it’s fine if you can’t help.” Jiang Yue chimed in,”after all, you’ve never raised orchids before ...” “Yueyue, Xia ruofei can even grow vegetables from a paradise. What’s the big deal about treating a pot of orchids?” Lu You said,”he will definitely be able to help. Right, Xia ruofei?” “I can’t guarantee anything. Let’s see!” Xia ruofei said. “Tsk ...” Lu You pouted slightly and said,”sister Qingxue is praising you to the heavens! You can’t even handle a small pot of orchids, don’t you feel embarrassed?” “I’m so embarrassed!” Xia ruofei said without changing his expression,”there are specializations in every profession. It’s not embarrassing if you can’t handle it! Besides ... I’m helping out of my own free will! They didn’t even ask for a reward ...” “You still want a reward? That’s good!” Lu You looked at Jiang Yue, who was beside her, and said,”as long as you help us cure this pot of orchid, I will reward you with a beautiful woman!” Jiang Yue’s face turned red instantly. She hit Lu You and said,””Youyou, don’t talk nonsense! Brother Xia already has sister Qingxue, why would he be attracted to another girl?” Jiang Yue could not help but reveal a trace of resentment towards the end of her sentence. Xia ruofei suddenly felt a headache coming on. He smiled awkwardly and did not respond. Fortunately, the three of them had already reached their destination, which eased Xia ruofei’s embarrassment. This place should have been a classroom. Now, there was a wooden sign hanging at the door. On it, the words “gardening club” were written with a brush. The handwriting seemed to have some calligraphy skills, and it was very graceful and charming. Lu You saw that Xia ruofei kept looking at the words on the wooden sign and smiled.””Xia ruofei, the words on this sign were written by Yueyue! She’s a multi – talented beauty!” Xia ruofei looked at Jiang Yue in surprise and said,””These words are really well written!” Jiang Yue smiled in embarrassment and said,””Brother Xia, I’m just making it up. It’s not as good as you say ...” When Lu You saw Jiang Yue’s behavior in front of Xia ruofei, she could not help but shake her head and sigh in her heart. Then, she pushed open the door of the gardening club. The three of them walked in together. The tables in the classroom were arranged in a circle against the four walls, leaving only the front and back doors open for access. Plants were placed on the tables against the wall, and there were a few rows of tables stacked together in the middle of the classroom. Some materials, tools, plants, and so on were piled on top of them. Although there were many things, it was not messy at all. After entering, Xia ruofei and the other two realized that there were already people in the gardening club. The three boys were talking about something around a pot of plants. They heard the sound of the door opening and turned around in unison. One of the boys, who was wearing a white casual suit and had a head of shiny hair, had his eyes lit up when he saw Lu You. He quickly said,””Lu You, you guys are here too!” A tall and strong man beside him immediately looked at Jiang Yue and his eyes were filled with joy. As for the last male student, who was wearing a gray down jacket and gold – rimmed glasses, he could not help but reveal a stunned expression when he saw Lu You and Jiang Yue. The Man in the White Suit looked at Xia ruofei again. He frowned slightly, then quickly relaxed and smiled.””Lu You, who is this?” Lu You didn’t answer the boy’s question. She only looked at the boy with gold – rimmed glasses and asked with a slight frown,””Peng Hui, who is he?”
