Chapter 1348: Squatting in a row (2)

Translator: 549690339

“Pay attention, my ass!” Hou Liang suddenly raised his voice and cursed.

Tian Xiaojun was instantly dumbfounded. Hou Liang’s sudden rage had caused his brain to freeze. He didn’t understand why Hou Liang had suddenly become so angry when they had been chatting happily just a moment ago.

Before Tian Xiaojun could react, he suddenly felt a pain in his waist. Xu Zixuan, who was standing behind him, had kicked him.

Tian Xiao Jun was immediately kicked to the ground by Xu Zi Xuan.

He trembled in fear and fell to the ground, asking with a face full of fear,””Young master hou, young master Xu, I don’t know what I said wrong ... Please be magnanimous ... Please don’t lower yourself to my level ...”

Zhong Zixin and Xia Ling, who had followed behind Tian Xiaojun, were also shocked.

They were all too clear about the capabilities of Hou Liang and the others. It could be said that if Hou Liang and the others wanted to mess with Tian Xiaojun in the capital, they didn’t even need to do it themselves. As long as they spread the word, a little profligate son like Tian Xiaojun would basically become a stray dog.

Xia Ling, who was usually arrogant and despotic, didn’t even dare to breathe. Seeing Tian Xiaojun being kicked down, she didn’t dare to go forward to help him up. She only stood on the spot with Zhong Zixin in fear, a little at a loss.

Hou Liang’s eyes were cold as he said,”I wonder what went wrong?” Then think carefully! We’ll talk about it when you think of it!”

Then, Hou Liang turned to look at Zhong Zixin and Xia Tian. He said,”You guys, come over here!”

Not only did Zhong Zixin and Liu Zhe hurriedly walk over, but even Liu Zhe, who had been carefully protecting Tian Xiaojun’s group, had no choice but to walk over to Hou Liang with an uneasy expression.

Hou Liang kicked Tian Xiaojun in disgust and said,”Are you lying on the ground like a dead dog? Quickly get up!”

Tian Xiaojun quickly used his hands and feet to support his body and quickly stood up.

Hou Liang pointed at the wall of the small courtyard in front of them and said,””You guys, put your hands behind your heads and squat over there!”

“Ah?” Tian Xiaojun could not help but call out subconsciously.

In any case, he was still a Deputy Division – Level officer. Although his position in the circle of good – for – nothings was far inferior to Hou Liang ‘s, Hou Liang’s actions still made him feel a little embarrassed.

“What do you mean” ah “?” Xu Zi Xuan said unhurriedly,”didn’t you hear what Liang Zi said?” Or are our words useless? That’s fine, Zhao Yongjun, brother Jun, and song Rui will be here soon. Their words should be of some use, right?”

When Tian Xiaojun heard the thunderous names of Zhao Yongjun and song Rui, he couldn’t help but shiver. He quickly said,”I don’t dare ... I don’t dare ...”

After that, he didn’t care about his pride as a Deputy Director anymore. He ran to the wall and squatted down facing the wall with his hands on his head.

Zhong Zixin and Xia Ling naturally didn’t dare to be negligent and also ran over to squat down.

Under the intense gazes of Hou Liang and the others, Liu Zhe could only helplessly follow in the footsteps of Tian Xiaojun and the others.

Liu Zhe felt as if 10000 alpacas were galloping across his heart. He secretly shouted,”I’m really unlucky today! What does this have to do with me?

However, he could not even afford to offend Tian Xiaojun, let alone offend Hou Liang and the others, whom Tian Xiaojun treated like a mouse seeing a cat. Therefore, he could only Mutter in his heart and did not even dare to explain himself.

In a short while, a row of four people was squatting at the base of the courtyard wall.

When the receptionist responsible for guiding Hou Liang and the others saw this scene, she wanted to laugh but did not dare to laugh out loud. She could only endure it with great difficulty.

As for Hou Liang, he walked to the entrance of the small courtyard and shouted,”Brother Xia! Boss Xia! Xia moneybags! Our brothers are already at the door, aren’t you going to come out and welcome us?”

Xu Zi Xuan also joined in the fun and shouted,”President Xia!” The takeaway you ordered is here! Hurry up and open the door ...”

Wei Jun didn’t dare to be so impetuous. He knew Xia ruofei’s powerful background, and he wasn’t that close to Xia ruofei. If he hadn’t helped Xia ruofei settle the Tongren Hall matter, he wouldn’t even have been able to get into Hou Liang’s circle. So he stood cautiously beside Hou Liang and Xu Zixuan, feeling a little envious.

Soon, footsteps could be heard in the courtyard. The doors split into two and Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue appeared at the entrance.

Xia ruofei was wearing a set of Armani casual clothes. He had been cultivating for a long time and had an otherworldly temperament. He looked very handsome.

Ling Qingxue, who was standing beside him, was not inferior in any way. She had a beautiful face and long legs, which made her look like an eye – catching divine weapon.

The two of them standing at the entrance of the courtyard was like a beautiful scenery. Hou Liang and the other two couldn’t help but be stunned.

Xu Zi Xuan was the first to react, he quickly stepped forward and said: “Brother Xia, this must be my sister – in – Law! As expected, they were a perfect match! Brother Xia is so lucky!”

Hou Liang also came back to his senses. He hurriedly began to ramble, but his expression was a little exaggerated. With a single glance, it was clear that he was trying to pull a prank.

Ling Qingxue’s face blushed slightly at their words. Xia ruofei, on the other hand, had already cultivated his thick skin. He even deliberately put on an expression that said he was happy to be flattered.

“This is?” Xia ruofei saw that Wei Jun looked a little unfamiliar and couldn’t help but ask curiously. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Oh, I forgot to introduce you!” “He’s Wei Jun!” Hou Liang immediately said.

Xia ruofei immediately reacted and smiled gently.””So you’re Wei Jun! We welcome you to the three mountains as a guest! Thank you for what you did last time!”

Wei Jun immediately felt flattered and quickly said,””You’re welcome, President Xia! It’s just a small matter ...”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”We’re all friends. You don’t have to be so polite. You can just call me brother Xia!”

Wei Jun was excited and said,””Alright, brother Xia!”

Xia ruofei reached out and grabbed Ling Qingxue’s soft hands. He smiled and said,””Let me formally introduce to everyone, this is my girlfriend, Ling Qingxue!”

“Hello!” Ling Qingxue smiled and said,”welcome to the three mountains!”

“By the way, this private restaurant belongs to Qingxue’s family. You guys should try the special dishes here later!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”if it’s good, don’t forget to help promote it when you go back. You might even open a branch in the capital in the future!”

“So this shop is opened by sister-in-law’s family!” “Of course!” Hou Liang quickly said,”the taste of the food definitely wasn’t mentioned! By the way, we have quite a few friends in the three mountains. I’ll introduce them to you when the time comes!”

“Thanks!” Xia ruofei said. Then, he asked,”Why are there only a few of you? Where’s brother Zhao? And where did that kid song Rui go?”

“Oh! Young master Song and brother Jun are in the same car. They’re going to pick up a friend, so they should be here soon. ” Xu Zi Xuan said.

“Alright, let’s wait inside!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it’s cold outside! Don’t just stand there, come into the house! You guys aren’t used to the wet and cold climate here in the three mountains, right?”

“Yup! It’s supposed to be a few degrees hotter here than in the capital, but I just feel cold. ” Hou Liang could not help but shrink his neck and said,”we felt it the moment we got off the plane. The wind was so strong that the down jacket seemed to be useless. The cold air even seeped into our bones ...”

“Hahaha!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you guys should come out more. What’s the point of staying in the capital all day?”

As they were talking, a loud thud suddenly came from the nearby courtyard wall.

It turned out that when Tian Xiaojun heard Xia ruofei chatting and joking with Hou Liang and the others, and when Xia ruofei was the most respected one among them, he could not help but feel his vision darken. In addition, he was cold and scared. After squatting for a while, his legs were numb, so he accidentally leaned forward and hit his head against the wall.

Only then did Xia ruofei notice it. He looked to the side and couldn’t help but laugh.”Why are there still a few people squatting here? Eh? Why was Liu Zhe squatting there? What’s the situation?”
