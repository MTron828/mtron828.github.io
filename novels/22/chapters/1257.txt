“Chairman.” Feng Rao’s voice sounded tired.

She had been busy with the press conference recently and had reduced her sleeping time. In addition, she had just finished the flight, so she was a little dispirited.

“The plane has landed, right?” Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”was the journey smooth?”

“Pretty good. I’m on my way back to the farm.” Feng Rao smiled.”Ling Yun sent a car to pick us up.”

“That’s good. ” Xia ruofei smiled.”There’s something I need you to follow up on.”

Feng Rao joked,”you’re such a big capitalist, you’re too good at exploitation!” I’ve just finished with the press conference and haven’t even returned to the company yet! They’re starting to recruit people again ...”

“Hehe, who asked you to be so strong?” Xia ruofei laughed drily.

Then, he briefly explained what he had discussed with old Blake in the morning.

After Feng Rao heard this, she couldn’t help but say in surprise,”Chairman, you closed such a big deal in just half a day? That’s good!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but roll his eyes and said,””Do you really think that I’m just a decoration? Are you a good – for – nothing?”

“Who told you to always shirk your responsibilities?” Feng Rao giggled.

“Yesterday at the auction, I even did your job. Is that not enough?” Xia ruofei said gloomily.

“That’s a special case!” “Why don’t I apply for a long leave so you can experience what it’s like to be the CEO of a company?” Feng Jing said without hesitation.

Once Xia ruofei thought of those cumbersome daily management Affairs, he couldn’t help but feel a headache. He quickly said,””Don ‘t, don’ t, don ‘t, you still have to stick to your post! Now that the company is developing rapidly, we’re seriously short of manpower. I can’t do without you! When everything is stable, I’ll give you a holiday! I’ll let you travel abroad!”

“You only know how to exploit the labor force ...” Feng Jing pouted.

Xia ruofei laughed drily and continued,””Speaking of which, I feel that the company’s structure isn’t perfect yet, and the shortage of staff hasn’t been easily solved. We’ll do some research when I come back. We need to fill in some senior managers, and it’s best to have some talent reserves. Our company’s expansion won’t be slow in the next step ...”

“I know. I’ve been thinking about this problem.” Feng Jing said,”I’ll find some time to organize my thoughts. I’ll write something for you to read first!”

“Yes, thank you for your hard work, President Feng!” Xia ruofei said. This time, he did not tease her and his tone was very sincere.

“It’s good that you know ...” Feng Jing said with a smile.

Then, the two of them returned to the main topic.

“Boss Feng, the people from the Blake group should be arriving at the three mountains in two days. They are in a hurry.” Xia ruofei said,”you’ll be in charge of the arrangements. The main things are the following ...”

“Chairman, please wait a moment. I’ll take note of this.” Feng ke said.

There was some noise coming from the phone. It was probably Feng Jing looking for her notebook.

“Alright, you can speak!” Feng Rao said quickly.

“The core of the deal is the conditions that I’ve discussed with old Blake. No discounts, a 10% premium, a guaranteed purchase in the coming year, no reselling, and so on. Also, anything related to George Blake must be written in the attached rules of the agreement as the prerequisite for the agreement to take effect.” Xia ruofei said.

Feng Rao quickly recorded it and said,””I’ve remembered all of this. What else?”

“They’ll probably ask for a non – Disclosure agreement, mainly because of George Blake. They can’t afford to lose face.” Xia ruofei said,”I’ve already agreed to this. However, to keep it a secret, you don’t have to bring your team to follow up on this matter. You can do it yourself! It’s not going to be a difficult negotiation anyway. ”

“Understood!” Feng ke said.

“There’s also the issue of confidentiality. We have to sign an agreement. That acquisition agreement, especially the contents of the attached conditions, can not be leaked in the slightest. Otherwise, it would be a slap in the face.” Xia ruofei said. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Mm, don’t worry! I’m going through a special process and won’t be filing this agreement with the company. I’ll rent a safe in the bank and store it. ” Feng ke said.

“This is for the best.” Xia ruofei said,”also, although it’s a long – term supply agreement, there’s still a time limit. You can discuss it. Three to five years is fine. I’ll give you full autonomy.”

Anyway, the purchase agreement was based on the auction price of that year. If the auction price was lower than the previous year’s price, the price could be guaranteed with the previous year’s price. Hence, Xia ruofei did not mind the time limit.

However, it would be better if there was less. After all, the Taoyuan truffle was not limited by the contract. If the cooperation with Blake group was not pleasant, they could terminate it at any time.

Of course, Blake’s group would definitely want to sign a long – term contract. After all, they had paid such a high price. Although George Blake was a wastrel, he was still a direct descendant of the family. Old Blake didn’t say anything and just gave him a three to five years contract. They probably wouldn’t be able to accept it.

It all depended on how Feng Rao was going to negotiate.

“I understand,” Feng Jing said calmly.”I’ll report the negotiation process to you at any time.”

“Alright! Rest well for two days after we return! You’ve been too tired recently, so you have to take care of your health. ” Xia ruofei said.

Feng Rao’s heart felt warm and she said softly,””I know ...”

Normally, Feng Jing would tease her a little. How was she supposed to rest when there were so many things to do at the company? However, after hearing Xia ruofei’s ordinary words, she felt a warm current in her heart and the words changed when they reached her mouth.
