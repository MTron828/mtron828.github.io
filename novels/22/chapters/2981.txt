2982 The same_

In addition, Xia ruofei used a simple black line to draw an area and wrote down his understanding and insights on some of the difficulties in the cultivation method.

On the first page, Xia ruofei had chosen two obscure places to mark.

After Luo Feng read it, he actually had a feeling of enlightenment. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

He even secretly hoped that Liu Mansha would quickly flip to the second page. At the same time, he couldn’t help but feel a sense of shame. Ever since he had entered private room 20, he had been on guard against Liu Mansha, Xia ruofei, and the others, as if they were thieves who had stolen their lingjue mountain’s “the true understanding of glittering jewels”. Who would have thought that in the end, he would be the one who had benefited so much from the handwritten copy of the “the true understanding of glittering jewels” from the star Seizer sect ...

This was a little ironic.

Liu Mansha wasn’t like Luo Feng, who was extremely familiar with the contents of the “true understanding of the glittering jewel array.” She had to constantly compare the contents to her left and right to confirm whether the contents were the same, so her speed was definitely not as fast as Luo Feng ‘s.

Luo Feng was getting anxious from waiting at the side. Liu Mansha was finally ready to flip to the second page of the spirit Vulture mountain’s manuscript. She was only going to flip to the second page because the contents of each page were not exactly the same. Xia ruofei’s manuscript was on A4 paper and could contain more content. After Liu Mansha checked the first page of the spirit Vulture mountain’s manuscript, she realized that there was still about one – third of the content left on the first page. Therefore, she naturally went to look through the handwritten copy of the spirit Vulture mountain on her left.

Luo Feng could only continue to wait patiently, and he couldn’t reveal it.

He had a faint feeling that he was going to lose this bet. If he paid the 50000 spiritual stones, the spirit Vulture mountain’s competition for the treasure would be greatly reduced. Basically, the chances of him winning were slim.

However, Luo Feng couldn’t care less about these things at the moment. He couldn’t wait to see the new contents of the star Seizer sect’s manuscript.

Whether it was Xia ruofei’s unique broken sentences or the understanding of the technique at the side of the page, they were all very precious in the eyes of Luo Feng, a cultivator who had studied the ‘glittering jewel true understanding’ for many years.

After Liu Mansha read another portion of the second page of the spirit Vulture mountain’s handwritten book, she finally finished checking the first page of the star Seizer sect’s handwritten book.

Under Luo Feng’s burning gaze, Liu Mansha’s hand reached out to the star Seizer sect’s handwritten copy on the right, preparing to flip to a new page.

Just then, Xia ruofei suddenly said,””Hold on!”

Liu Mansha stopped and turned to look at Xia ruofei. She smiled and asked,””Fellow Daoist Xia, do you have any advice for me?”

Although she had only checked a page or so of the contents, Liu Mansha’s expectations for this manual had greatly increased. The contents of the manual were exactly the same as the one in the spirit Vulture mountain. There were also additional cultivation insights. Moreover, with Liu Mansha’s cultivation level and vision, even if she did not have the time to carefully comprehend it, she could still discover that this cultivation technique was unusual.

Hence, Liu Mansha’s attitude towards Xia ruofei had unknowingly become more polite.

Xia ruofei smiled.”Valley master Liu,” he said,”I don’t deserve any advice. I just have a suggestion.”

“Fellow Daoist Xia, please speak.” Liu Mansha said with a smile.

Xia ruofei said,”I believe Valley master Liu has already discovered that the area on the side of the hand – copied book is not the content of the cultivation technique. Instead, it is some cultivation insights. Speaking of which, these insights are very precious. It can be considered a bonus from this auction!” However ... Since these cultivation insights are more precious and have nothing to do with checking the original content, I suggest that during the process of checking, this area should be blocked to a certain extent!”

When Luo Feng heard this, he almost cursed out loud. This guy was too sleazy! I wanted to secretly learn some cultivation insights, but he actually covered all the loopholes.

Shao Qingyang couldn’t see the cultivation method in the private room now. The star picking sect’s people had provided this hand – written copy, and the people of the flying flower Valley had spent money to buy it, so there was naturally no need to keep it a secret from these people. In that case, the people who had to guard against it were the people of the Spirit Vulture mountain. Moreover, the contents of the second volume could only be understood by golden core stage cultivators with difficulty. If he wanted to cultivate it, he had to combine it with the basic contents of the first volume. It was basically equivalent to the heavenly book. Therefore, to be more precise, it was only guarding against Luo Feng.

Liu Mansha herself was an experienced cultivator, and she was also the valley master of the flying flower Valley. It could be said that she had seen many things and knew many people. She glanced at Luo Feng from the corner of her eye and immediately understood what was going on.

Liu Mansha couldn’t help but find it funny when she thought of how Luo Feng had been so focused on preventing the star Seizer sect and the flying flower Valley’s cultivators from secretly learning their “the true understanding of glittering jewels.” The corners of her mouth curled up into a very beautiful arc as she said,”Fellow Daoist Xia’s suggestion is very good! Thank you for your reminder!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. After a moment of silence, he reminded,””That’s right, because our handwritten copy is the complete second volume, and the one on the spirit Vulture mountain has a missing page, there must be some content that is unique to our handwritten copy. Valley master Liu, if you encounter this part of the content, you might as well cover it up in time. After all, this is a cultivation technique that you bought with money. This is also to protect your rights and interests!”

Liu Mansha’s smile grew even wider. She nodded and said, “I’ve learned!”

With that, Liu Mansha took out a black paperweight from her storage ring. The width of this paperweight was about the same as the area that Xia ruofei had marked out for cultivation comprehension, and it was just enough to cover it.

Then, Liu Mansha flipped to the second page of the star Seizer sect’s handwritten copy and smoothly used a paperweight to block the area at the side where the comprehensions of cultivation were recorded.

Luo Feng cursed in his heart, but he couldn’t show it. His expression was as if he was constipated.

Of course, he couldn’t use his mental power to spy on them openly. There were several golden core cultivators present, and everyone was so close to each other. If he did this, he would be immediately discovered, and then he would really be too ashamed to see people.

However, Luo Feng was still like a dog that had caught a whiff of feces. He couldn’t wait to turn his gaze to the handwritten book provided by the star Seizer sect. Even if he couldn’t see his comprehension of cultivation, he could at least refer to the sentence breaking method in the handwritten book! Even if he couldn’t eat meat, drinking some soup was not bad.

Xia ruofei immediately noticed the difference between the two handwritten copies. As for the broken sentences, there was no way for the other party to steal it.

Compared to the 50000 spirit stones that he would soon be able to obtain, it was still within his acceptable range for the other party to secretly learn a few simple sentences.

In fact, Liu Mansha could basically confirm that there were no problems with the star Seizer sect’s cultivation technique after checking two pages.

However, this was a bet between the spirit Vulture mountain and the star Seizer sect. If they stopped the verification now, the spirit Vulture mountain would definitely not allow it. They had been worrying about having no reason to renege on the bet! And to the flying flower Valley, wouldn’t it be more reassuring to check from beginning to end?

Thus, whether it was for public or private reasons, Liu Mansha chose to be patient and verify each word.

However, she still listened to Xia ruofei’s words and blocked off the area where she recorded her cultivation insights. Whenever she encountered a missing part in the manuscript of the spirit Vulture mountain, she would also block the missing part in the star Seizer sect’s manuscript.

Luo Feng relied on the content he was familiar with, and could often see bits and pieces of the missing parts. However, the more this was the case, the more impatient he was, and it was even more uncomfortable than not seeing anything at all.

Even though he was very shrewd, he couldn’t help but reveal a very interesting expression on his face.

As for Wu Ming, his face had long turned ashen. Although he couldn’t understand the contents of the handwritten book with his cultivation base, he could still recognize the words. After a simple comparison, he knew that the contents of the two handwritten books were exactly the same.

This also meant that they had lost the bet ...
