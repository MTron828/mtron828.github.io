Xia ruofei busied himself in the medium for a few hours before he returned to the outside world with a satisfied look.

He didn’t go directly to the Liu family’s house, but rested for a night in the liuhai Lane courtyard house. The next morning, after having breakfast in the courtyard house, he drove the Alphard van to the Liu family’s house.

Liu Qunfeng, Liu Chongli, and the others were already waiting for Xia ruofei in the courtyard. Before the car had even stopped, they had already come up to him with anticipation.

“Mr. Xia!” Liu Qunfeng greeted Xia ruofei nervously.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you’re lucky!” I’ve collected all the herbs. ”

Liu Qunfeng suddenly relaxed, and Liu Chongli, who was next to him, also looked overjoyed. Liu Kuan, who was not far away, ran upstairs to report to old Liu.

“Chief Liu, call a few people to help carry the things!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”by the way, have you prepared the things that I called you to yesterday?”

“It’s all ready!” Liu Qunfeng quickly said,”the whole set of Chinese medicine boiling equipment and the tools you mentioned are all ready. They are in your room!”

After that, Liu Qunfeng called for a few Men in Black to carry the items.

Xia ruofei opened the trunk of the car and pointed at the huge plastic box.”The medicinal herbs are all inside, help me carry them to my room!”

“Hurry up! You guys carry it together!” “Be careful!” Liu Qunfeng shouted.”Don’t damage the herbs inside!”

“Yes!” “Yes, sir!” The Men in Black answered loudly. They then came over and carefully lifted the large plastic box and walked into the house.

Liu Qunfeng followed behind them nervously, constantly reminding them that the Men in Black were too clumsy to touch the boxes.

In fact, the box contained Chinese herbs, not porcelain. Even if there were occasional bumps, it shouldn’t be a big problem. Liu Qunfeng was just worried.

Moreover, he knew too well the preciousness of these medicinal herbs. A few days ago, the Liu family had exhausted the entire family’s strength, but they couldn’t find even a single medicinal herb.

The group of people arrived at Xia ruofei’s guest room. Under Xia ruofei’s instructions, the Men in Black placed the large plastic box in the corner of the room, bowed, and left the room.

Xia ruofei first checked the medicine boiling equipment that he had asked the Liu family to prepare yesterday. Then, he smiled and said,””Chief Liu, everything is here. I’ll start making the pills in a while.”

“Then I’ll leave it to you, Mr. Xia!” Liu Qunfeng bowed deeply to Xia ruofei and said,”if my father’s illness can be cured, we will never forget the kindness Mr. Xia has shown us for giving us a new life!”

“Chief Liu, you’re being too serious!” Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand.”Let’s take a look at the elixirs that I’ve spent so much effort to collect! It’s rare to see so many precious herbs placed together. ”

Liu Qunfeng was stunned for a moment, then quickly said,””This ... Wouldn’t it be a little inconvenient?”

Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”I’ve even given you a list of medicinal herbs. These are all on the list. Why do you need to keep it a secret?” It doesn’t matter, let’s take a look together!”

It would be a lie to say that Liu Qunfeng and the others weren’t curious. In fact, they were more or less suspicious of the existence of those herbs. Or was it that only the Amethyst blood radish was real, and the rest were just made up by Xia ruofei to make the pill seem precious?

Besides, Xia ruofei had told them all about it. Who knew what kind of herbs were used to make the pills?

Therefore, when Xia ruofei asked Liu Qunfeng and the others to check the herbs with him, they only declined and did not move. They did not have any intention of avoiding him.

Xia ruofei was still smiling. He had a good grasp of Liu Qunfeng’s and the others ‘mentality, which was why he had made the necessary preparations at the courtyard in liuhai Lane yesterday.

To put it bluntly, he had brought this big plastic box here today to show it to Liu Qunfeng and the others.

Xia ruofei walked over with a smile and opened the plastic box. Liu Qunfeng and the others were immediately attracted by the medicinal herbs in the plastic box.

The space in the plastic box was roughly divided into two parts, separated by a plastic partition in the middle.

Half of them were bags of medicinal herbs. These medicinal herbs were wrapped in paper and then carefully tied up with fine hemp rope. They were neatly stacked in plastic boxes.

The other half was amazing. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

There were more than a dozen fresh medicinal herbs inside. They were all planted in a small flower pot, and each of them was fresh and tender. There were even water droplets hanging on the branches and leaves.

What shocked Liu Qunfeng and Liu Chongli the most was that these medicinal herbs were exactly the same as the ones on Xia ruofei’s list, which naturally included the Amethyst blood radish.

One must know that the Amethyst blood radish had appeared in an auction in the secular world before. Naturally, there were pictures of it. It was much more vivid than the illustrations that Xia ruofei had drawn with a pen. The Amethyst blood radish in the plastic box looked almost exactly the same as the one that had appeared in the auction. However, it was obviously much bigger and older. As for its value, it was impossible to estimate.

As for the other ten or so medicinal herbs, Xia ruofei’s illustrations didn’t seem very obvious. However, when Liu Qunfeng and Liu Chongli saw them, even if they didn’t have much knowledge of Chinese medicine, they could still feel that these medicinal herbs were extraordinary. Even if they looked at them up close, they felt refreshed.
