3168 Supercomputing Center (1)

Xia ruofei’s room arrangement was quite interesting.

Xia ruofei arranged for Liu Mansha and Yu xiner, master and disciple, to share a room according to their wishes. It was a luxurious double bed room.

Mu Sheng and mu Jianfei, father and son, each had a luxurious big bed room.

Chen Xuan and Feng Xiaoyi were also staying in single rooms.

In order to show his respect as an academician and care for the elderly, Xia ruofei booked a luxury suite for Wang Chi.

Only Xia ruofei, Song Wei, and Ling Qingxue were left. Xia ruofei booked a big, luxurious room.

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue were with Xia ruofei when he booked the room, but they did not object.

Of course, they knew that Xia ruofei did not book the room to save on the accommodation fee.

However, after sharing the same bed at paradise clubhouse that night, their mentality seemed to have a subtle change. At least, in their minds, they felt that even if they were in such a state, it seemed to be acceptable.

After Xia ruofei distributed the room cards to everyone, he returned to his room with Song Wei and Ling Qingxue.

He opened the door, plugged in the power, turned on the lights, and turned on the air conditioner ...

Xia ruofei finished all this in one go and said,””I’ll make it clear first! I’m probably going to stay up all night at the Supercomputing Center, that’s why I booked a room like this. ”

“You’re lying!”Ling Qingxue chuckled.

“Trying to cover up will only make things worse!” Song Wei added.

“Then I’ll be brazen!” Xia ruofei chuckled.

After he finished speaking, he made a posture of a hungry tiger pouncing on its prey and was about to pounce on the two people.

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue screamed in fear and dodged to the left and right.

Naturally, Xia ruofei would not be so lecherous. He was just fooling around with his two female friends. Everyone went to wash their faces and the girls touched up their makeup. Then, it was almost time for dinner.

Xia ruofei had already booked a table at the hotel restaurant. The ten of them could sit at one table.

He ordered a lot of local specialty dishes and exquisite Jiangnan specialty desserts, but because they had important things to do that night, no one drank.

After lunch, Wang Chi found Xia ruofei and said,””President Xia, I’m going to the Supercomputing Center in the afternoon to do my own things and to finalize the time.”

“Aren’t you going to take a rest?” Xia ruofei asked.

Xia ruofei’s supercomputer was scheduled to start at 10 pm, so it was basically an all – nighter. Under normal circumstances, Wang Chi would have to accompany him throughout the entire process, so Xia ruofei was worried that he would not be able to hold on at his age.

“I’ve contacted the Supercomputing Center,” Wang Chi said with a smile.”They’ll send a car to pick me up at three in the afternoon. I can still rest in the hotel for two hours at noon. In addition, there’s a place to rest at night. The condition of the lounge in the Supercomputing Center is not bad. If there’s any situation, you can call me at any time. ”

Xia ruofei was enlightened. He nodded and said,””That’s good. I was worried that your body wouldn’t be able to take it!”

Wang Chi smiled.”If you’re fine, do you want to go to the supercomputer Center with me this afternoon?” he asked. Should we meet with the leaders over there in advance?”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and nodded.””Alright, I’ll go over first. However, when it’s time to use the supercomputer, my friends will be there too. That should be fine, right?”

Wang Chi chuckled.”Of course, no problem. The new Wu Supercomputing Center receives countless visitors every year, but it’s rare to see visitors in the second half of the night, haha!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”We’re working on this project together. We all want to see the results as soon as possible. So ...”

“I understand! I understand!” Wang Chi replied,”no problem! I’ll ask the supercomputer Center to send a car to pick up your friend at the hotel at 9 pm. Then, I’ll let Xiaoyi stay here to coordinate. There won’t be any problems!”

“There’s no need to send a car!” Xia ruofei said,”the car rental service at the hotel is very convenient!”

“In new Wu city, with the resources of the Supercomputing Center, what’s the point of renting a car?” Wang Chi replied,”I don’t know the exact time of departure and landing of your plane. Otherwise, you wouldn’t have to rent a car to pick me up!” President Xia, if there’s no problem, then it’s decided! Let’s meet at the hotel lobby before 3 pm!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”okay!” Oh yeah, academician Wang, I’m bringing two friends to the Supercomputing Center this afternoon, the car ...”

Xia ruofei would definitely bring Song Wei and Ling Qingxue with him. Besides, although Chen Xuan was definitely interested in the Supercomputing Center, he considered that if he brought Chen Xuan along, Mu Sheng and Liu Mansha would have some concerns. They would definitely be worried that he and Chen Xuan would abandon them and go to solve the secret of the token first. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

They didn’t understand the super-computer’s computer time, so they didn’t think it was 10 pm just because they had agreed on it.

In order to avoid suspicion, Xia ruofei decided to let Chen Xuan stay in the hotel with Mu Sheng and the rest.

At least, Chen Xuan would not misunderstand Xia ruofei’s intention to start a new project. Besides, Chen Xuan knew that even if Xia ruofei secretly went to the Supercomputing Center to use the supercomputer, it would take at least several hours to get a result with the calculation of their algorithm. Xia ruofei would not have enough time.

This way, Chen Xuan could still explain the situation to an Musheng and the others.
