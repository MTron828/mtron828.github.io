Chapter 540: Prospered_2

Then, he moved the red Arowana to the big fish pond, so they had more space to live. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

As for the ordinary fish, Xia ruofei packed most of them in a box. He put a small portion into the small fish pond where the red Arowana used to live so that he could have the ingredients whenever he wanted to eat fish.

Of course, Xia ruofei still had to spend a lot of time eating the fish in the tidying box before they died from lack of oxygen not long after they came out of the water. However, the interspace had a super preservation function, so they would not go bad even if they were placed in the tidying box.

As for the truffles, Xia ruofei had moved the oak tree to the new space to optimize the spatial order. The new space had the same time ratio as the outside world. It was not yet the truffle harvest season, so there was no truffles for the time being.

However, the oak trees were growing quite energetically. Xia ruofei was very confident about the production of truffles in the second half of the year.

In the new space, xiaohei and the other seven puppies had grown stronger. Xia ruofei decided to bring them to live in the outside world after the farm’s infrastructure was completed.

Although the spiritual Qi in the spirit map was dense, there was no one else other than Xia ruofei. It was rather quiet and the dogs must be very lonely.

Besides, after living in such a peaceful environment for so many years, Xia ruofei was worried that the wild nature of the puppies would gradually disappear.

With the expansion of the farm, the safety of the farm would be more secure with Blackie, lightning, and the other six dogs.

Xia ruofei spent the past few days in such a slow pace.

He basically didn’t have to manage the farm himself. When he had time, he would take care of the animals and plants in the spirit map space. He would also add some spirit Heart Flower petal solution to the reservoir regularly to ensure that the vegetables and fruit trees could be watered with the petal solution.

The relevant procedures for Paradise Farm to import vegetable seeds from the peach blossom company were quickly completed. Because it was only a small – scale experimental planting in the early stage, the first batch of various seeds required about 100 kilograms.

Xia ruofei also found time to go out and visit a few cities near the three mountains. He bought some seeds from seed companies in various places and gathered all the seeds he needed for export.

In fact, a hundred kilograms of seeds could be bought from the seed company in Sanshan city. However, Xia ruofei was considering the future. Paradise Farm’s estimated planting scale was up to 4500 hectares! The amount of seeds needed every year was definitely in the tons. If he only purchased them from Sanshan city, on the one hand, the supply might not be able to keep up, and on the other hand, it would easily arouse suspicion.

Hence, besides purchasing seeds, Xia ruofei also got in touch with the managers of the seed companies. In the future, he would have many options when he needed seeds.

Moreover, he could contact her directly through the phone and transfer the money to her.

After Xia ruofei returned to the farm, he soaked the 100 kilograms of seeds in the original space and dried them.

In order to ensure the results of the experiment, Xia ruofei had specially used an extra petal of the spirit Heart Flower to make the concentration of the petal solution to soak the seed higher than the ones usually provided to the seeds of Taoyuan farm.

Of course, the production of spirit Heart Flower petals was still greater than the consumption. Xia ruofei had about 50 petals now.

He had more than enough to spare, so he didn’t feel bad about wasting one more.

After all, if they were planted on an Australian farm, the vegetable seedlings would not be able to enjoy the treatment of petal solution irrigation in the future. Naturally, they had to be taken care of when soaking the seeds. Otherwise, if the quality of the vegetables grown was not as good as those in China, it would be more troublesome.

Xia ruofei had returned to the country for about half a month. The wine he had bought from West Winery had also been imported and sent to San Shan city by air.

He even made a trip to the warehouse that he had rented in the city and handed it over to the logistics company.

Xia ruofei immediately stored all the wine in the warehouse into the original space and placed the boxes neatly.

All he needed to do was wait.

With time flowing thirty times faster and the rich spirit Qi, the quality of the wine would be raised by a large margin.

……

After resting for more than half a month, Xia ruofei received a guest at the villa in Taoyuan farm.

Xia ruofei sat on the sofa in the living room and looked up and down at the girl in front of him. She was wearing a camouflage uniform without any military rank and had short hair.

The girl was about twenty – three or twenty – four years old. Her skin was a healthy wheat color, her eyes were bright and full of spirit, and her back was straight.

Although she wasn’t considered pretty and her skin was a little rough, she had a heroic temperament.

Lin Shengnan was also sizing Xia ruofei up.

She felt that this King of the Commando unit, who was very famous in the Army and even the Marines knew his name, seemed to be different from what she had imagined.

He was dressed in a Black Casual outfit with a hood. He did not look very strong, and his skin was even fairer than his own. He looked more like a young master who lived a comfortable life than a veteran who had been in the Army for seven to eight years and had been discharged from the Army for less than a year.

He didn’t seem to be handsome, but this seemingly ordinary appearance seemed to have a very special temperament that made people inexplicably feel close to him. His eyes were very deep, like two bottomless pools.

Xia ruofei’s face gradually bloomed into a smile. He said,””Lin Shengnan, I’ve read the information that Wolf King sent me. He is indeed outstanding to be able to defeat so many outstanding male soldiers in the military competition and win the championship.”

“Class monitor Xia.” Lin Shengnan said,”that’s because no one from lone wolf is participating. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have been able to win the championship ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and looked proud.””That’s still very impressive. In my opinion, there are two types of Chinese soldiers. One type is the lone wolf assault team, and the other type is the other type. There’s no comparison between the two.”

Lin Shengnan’s eyes showed a trace of dissatisfaction. However, she had to admit that although Xia ruofei’s words were arrogant, at least for now, they were true.

She was fortunate enough to have carried out a mission with the lone wolf commando team, so she knew very well that no matter how hard she worked, until she was discharged from the Army, she was still a distance away from the lone wolf’s selection standards.

Of course, so far, lone wolf had not produced any female team members.

The phrase that Guo Zhan often said was: War made women leave.

This wasn’t gender discrimination, but rather, it was determined by physiological conditions. At the very least, there was no place for female soldiers in the Special Assault Team like lone wolf.

Xia ruofei’s eyes revealed a trace of desolation. He laughed at himself and said, “We’re all people who have left the Army. What’s the point of saying this? By the way, Lin Shengnan, you don’t have to call me squad leader Xia anymore. I’m just a normal citizen without my military uniform. You can call me Mr. Xia, or just like Lei Hu and the others, you can call me brother Xia. ”

Lin Shengnan hesitated for a moment and said,””Yes, Mr. Xia.”

Obviously, Lin Shengnan did not think that he was close to Xia ruofei and was more or less distant from her.

Xia ruofei did not mind. After all, she was a girl and the Army she served in was not of the same system as his. Naturally, she was different from Lei Hu and the others.

Xia ruofei asked,”Sheng Nan, you’re so outstanding. You should have a good chance of being promoted, right?” Why did you choose to leave the Army at this time?”

Lin Shengnan’s face turned gloomy.””Mr. Xia, I chose to leave the Army because of some personal reasons. I ... Can I not say it?”

“Of course! That’s your freedom. ” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Lin Shengnan bit her lower lip and asked,””Then ... Will it affect my interview results?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”the champion of the Military District’s martial arts competition, the champion of the Marine’s combat competition, the female gun King ... Outstanding talents with so many titles. I can’t even find one even if I light a lantern!” Sheng Nan, the moment the wolf King recommended you to me, you were already accepted!”
