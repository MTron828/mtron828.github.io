Zhuo Yiyi giggled and said,”sister Qingxue, there are still 3000 nails left on this broken boat!” Not to mention such a big corporation like glory world Corporation. Even if he’s in decline, at least he’ll have a lifetime of wealth and glory!”

“That’s true ...” Ling Qingxue giggled and said,”it seems like someone has met a strong competitor!”

Zhuo Yiyi’s eyes lit up when she heard that, and she hurriedly asked,””Sister Qingxue! So ... Our Wei Wei already has a boyfriend?”

Ling Qingxue pursed her lips and smiled,”I’m talking about Wei Wei’s future boyfriend ... You should be asking her if she has a boyfriend now!” I’m not sure!”

Zhuo Yiyi rolled her eyes and said,””Something’s wrong ... Something’s wrong ...”

With that, Zhuo Yiyi turned to Song Wei and said,””Wei Wei, you must be hiding something from me, right?”

Naturally, Zhuo Yiyi understood the underlying meaning behind Ling Qingxue’s words. However, she was not very close to Ling Qingxue, so she could only ask Song Wei.

Song Wei blushed and said,”How could that be? Don’t talk nonsense! Yiyi, when did you become so nosy? That Zhou Yuan ... I’ve never heard of him before, but you’re able to make sense of him! Don’t tell me you’ve taken a fancy to this rich second generation? Do you want me to tell uncle Rui?”

“I’m going to kill you!” Zhuo Yiyi said exaggeratedly,”would I be interested in such an embroidered pillow? You’re insulting my taste!”

Zhuo Yiyi continued,”actually, a few days ago, a fangirl in our unit was gossiping about this person. She mentioned him. That’s why I suddenly remembered him today.”

Xia ruofei looked at Ling Qingxue innocently. Ling Qingxue’s words not only shocked Song Wei, but also made Xia ruofei’s heart beat faster. In the current situation, if the matter between him and Song Wei were to be spread, or more accurately, the matter between him, Ling Qingxue, and Song Wei were to be spread, it would definitely cause a huge uproar.

Ling Qingxue glanced at Xia ruofei with a smile in her eyes, then asked,””Yiyi, what gossip did you guys talk about?”

“It’s just that this young master Zhou is a Playboy!” A look of disdain appeared in Zhuo Yiyi’s eyes as she said,”he’s been involved in scandals with many small – time celebrities, young models, and internet celebrities. The paparazzi often take photos of him going in and out of hotels with different women. It’s no longer news!”

Zhuo Yiyi continued,”that love – struck girl from our unit actually said that he wouldn’t care even if this guy was a Playboy. He even fantasized about marrying into a rich family and becoming a rich lady!” It was simply destroying his three views! I feel that this kind of person who is completely irresponsible in his personal feelings should be destroyed! What did he take women for? A toy?”

Even though Zhuo Yiyi was criticizing Zhou Yuan, Xia ruofei felt uncomfortable listening to her, especially when Ling Qingxue’s half – smiling eyes kept glancing at him. Even song Wei secretly shot him a quick glance with hidden bitterness, making him feel like there was a dagger at his back.

Xia ruofei laughed drily and said,””Let’s talk about something else! He’s just a prodigal second generation, what’s there to talk about!”

“That’s true!” Zhuo Yiyi said, then immediately giggled and said,”handsome Xia! You’re good to Wei Wei! He had come out to support her at the critical moment! He even said that Wei Wei’s card was free of charge! At that time, Zhou Yuan’s expression was extremely interesting! Hahaha! But you can’t go back on your word! Wei Wei can bring me here to eat and drink for free in the future ...”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry,”Yiyi! Your song Rui is also a shareholder! In theory, you’re also the lady boss! He was actually thinking of eating and drinking for free? Besides, why don’t you just put it directly on song Rui’s account? Do you still need Wei Wei to guide you?”

Zhuo Yiyi was stunned for a moment before she said,”that’s true ... But if that’s the case ... Wouldn’t we be losing our own money?” I have to ...”

“Look at your money – grubbing face!” Song Wei snapped. Can’t you be a little more promising!”

“Song Rui isn’t as rich as handsome Xia!” Zhuo Yiyi said,”and he’s usually very spendthrift. I’m counting on him to earn more money from this paradise gathering project!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh. “I’m just joking with you! I’ll let brother Zhao know later. In the future, both of your membership cards will be on my account! But you have to explain it clearly to song Rui! It won’t be good if you misunderstand!”

“What misunderstanding?” Song Rui’s voice was heard.

“Speak of the Devil and the devil will come!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”you weren’t hiding and eavesdropping, were you?”

“Do I look like that kind of person?” Song Rui said arrogantly.

Xia ruofei, Song Wei, and Zhuo Yiyi all nodded in unison. Only Ling Qingxue was overjoyed.

Song Rui looked constipated and said,””So this is what you think of me? This is too sad...I just walked over and heard RUO Fei’s last sentence! What are you guys talking about?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”we’re talking about your Yiyi’s new life!” I’ve already promised her that I’ll pay for all her membership cards in the future! I’m just asking her to explain it to you! You brat, you treat Yiyi as a treasure in your hands! What if there’s a misunderstanding and you still come to mess with me? then wouldn’t I be doing something bad with good intentions?”

Hearing that, song Rui immediately said with an exaggerated expression,””Yiyi, I’m also a shareholder of the Paradise society! You can put your membership card on my account! It’s not like I can’t afford such a small expense! You actually want to put it on RUO Fei’s account? I ... I can only say ... You ... Well done!”

At the end of his sentence, song Rui finally couldn’t hold it in and burst out laughing. He even walked over and high – fived Zhuo Yiyi.

Song Rui pointed at Xia ruofei and said,”Yiyi, remember this. This guy is a big, big nouveau riche!” As long as there was a chance to kill him, he would not let it go, just like today! Do you remember that?”

“En!” Hearing this, Zhuo Yiyi immediately nodded her head.

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry,”that’s enough!” He said. You’ve only been together for a short time, and you’re already following your husband?”

Song Rui rolled his eyes and said,”this is called tacit understanding!” You won’t understand even if I tell you!”

More and more guests came to attend the opening ceremony, and the banquet hall became more and more lively.

Those who were invited to the celebration were all rich and influential people in the political and business world. Xia ruofei was not very familiar with people in this circle and did not like these social activities. Therefore, most of the time, he sat in the opposite corner and chatted with Ling Qingxue, Song Wei, and Zhuo Yiyi.

Zhao Yongjun, who was good at dancing, brought Hou Liang, Xu Zixuan, and a few others through the banquet hall, stopping from time to time to greet familiar people and chat briefly. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Even song Rui quickly got into character and shuttled through the crowd with a glass of wine in his hand.

Xia ruofei and the others were in an unremarkable corner, which was relatively quiet.

This was mainly because Xia ruofei, Ling Qingxue, and Zhuo Yiyi were not part of the rich and powerful circle in the capital. Even song Wei had little contact with them. Under normal circumstances, no one would take the initiative to come and greet them.

In Xia ruofei’s eyes, the Paradise gathering was just for fun with a group of friends. He had never expected to make much money from this project. He didn’t think that today’s opening ceremony needed to be taken seriously. Naturally, he wouldn’t inform Tang Yitian, Hong Kong’s MA Xiong, United States’s Tang He, and his Grand – disciple Li Yifu.

However, Xia ruofei was no longer a nobody. Some people in the circle of Playboys might not know him, but Xia ruofei knew a few people in the business circle.

Xia ruofei’s joke had amused Ling Qingxue, Song Wei, and Zhuo Yiyi.

At this moment, a few middle – aged men in suits and leather shoes walked towards Xia ruofei with wine glasses in their hands. They were talking and laughing.
