Chapter 1387: Everyone’s little sister (1)

Translator: 549690339

“What did I do?” Zhao Yongjun knew, but he asked with a smile.

Song Rui said,”you obviously wanted to buy a gift for Lin Qiao, but you didn’t tell us and went to buy a gift secretly!” Moreover, he didn’t even take it out at the pier and only gave it to Lin Qiao after we got on the ferry. This is too much!”

Xu Zi Xuan also jokingly said,”yeah!” I didn’t expect you to be like this, Jun bro!”

“He’s too scheming!” Hou Liang also mustered up his courage and chided.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh. Lin Qiao blushed and said in embarrassment,””Actually ... You guys don’t have to give me any gifts!”

“How can we do that!” Song Rui said righteously,”although brother Zhao is not very kind, he is right! If you’re ruofei’s sister, you’re also our sister. How can we miss out on our first meeting gift?”

“Yes, yes, yes. Sister Lin Qiao, your brothers were negligent today. We will definitely make up for this gift tomorrow!” Xu Zi Xuan hurriedly said.

Xia ruofei was completely engrossed in watching the show. He didn’t forget to fan the flames and said with a smile,””Don’t rush it! Actually, it’s still early today ...”

“But ... Gulangyu only sells handicrafts. They’re pretty, but they’re not of high quality ...” Hou Liang said hesitantly.

Song Rui, however, came back to his senses and said,””Why are you buying it on Gulangyu? This round trip will only take five to six minutes. We’ll immediately take the round trip back to Heron Island. RUO Fei is right, it’s still early!”

“You’re right, brother Rui!”Liu Jian’s eyes lit up. Even if the ferry stops, little Zhang should be able to help us coordinate the speedboat, right?”

Liu Jian looked at Xiao Zhang as he spoke.

“No problem!” Xiao Zhang quickly replied. No problem! If you guys want to go back to Heron Island to buy gifts, I can go with you. I’m quite familiar with the high – end brand stores on Heron Island ...”

Song Rui was overjoyed. He patted Xiao Zhang’s shoulder and said,””Good comrade!”

“It’s decided then!” Xu Zi Xuan also said.

Lin Qiao saw that everyone was going to make a special trip back to Heron Island and quickly said,”Brothers, you really don’t have to go through so much trouble ... If you really want to give me a gift, you can buy anything on Gulangyu. For example, I really like the Peppa Pig toy that brother ruofei gave me yesterday!”

Song Rui looked at Xia ruofei with disdain and said,””How can we be compared to RUO Fei, that cheapskate? Lin Qiao, do you know why your brother is so rich now? They were all dug out ...”

Lin Qiao immediately retorted,”brother song Rui is talking nonsense!” Brother ruofei was not stingy! For my mom and me, he has already spent a few million!”

Xia ruofei had bought a penthouse apartment with a Pavilion for Lin Qiao as a graduation gift. It was not an exaggeration to say that he had spent a few million.

Song Rui was stunned for a moment and quickly said,””Sister Lin Qiao, don’t be angry! I ... I was just joking ...”

“Oh ...” Lin Qiao said sullenly.

Zhao Yongjun, who was also watching from the side, couldn’t help but laugh.””Xiao Rui, now you know what it means to speak without thinking! RUO Fei’s position in Lin Qiao’s heart is not something you can slander. ”

Xu Zi Xuan also righteously said: “Comrade song Rui, what you’re doing is very dirty! You must fully realize your mistakes!”

“I still have to deeply analyze my own heart and make a deep self – reflection!” Liu Jian said in all seriousness.

Lin Qiao was a little embarrassed and said,””Aiya! You’re exaggerating ... I ... I’m not angry ...”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but gently touch Lin Qiao’s head and said,””Silly girl, ignore these kids. They’re just joking ...” He said.

Xu Zi Xuan and the others immediately burst out laughing.

The voyage from Egret Island to Gulangyu was very short. They arrived at the port in the time it took for them to chat and laugh. Xia ruofei, Lin Qiao, and Zhao Yongjun took the battery car that Xiao Zhang had arranged for them to return to the hotel. The rest of them waited at the dock for the ferry to set sail so that they could return to Egret Island to buy gifts.

It was not until 6:30 that song Rui and the others rushed back.

Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao only had a little Shacha noodles for lunch, so they didn’t wait for song Rui and the others. Who knew if they would eat on Egret Island during lunch time? Hence, he called it “eating while waiting isn’t cruel” and ordered food with Zhao Yongjun at the hotel restaurant.

When song Rui and the others returned to the hotel, Xia ruofei and the other two had just finished eating and were walking out of the restaurant. Xia ruofei was still picking his teeth with a toothpick. Song Rui and the others could not help but look at each other.

“Have you ... Eaten?” song Rui asked.

Xia ruofei replied innocently,”yes!” I thought you guys ate it on Egret Island!”

Song Rui said helplessly,”we’re all busy choosing gifts!” Then why did you still care about eating?”

Xia ruofei laughed in his heart, but he still said seriously,””Then quickly go and eat something! By the way, our table ordered quite a lot of dishes, and we haven’t finished a few of them! Hurry up and go in, the waiter probably didn’t have time to collect it!” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Xia ruofei, you’ve gone too far ...” Song Rui said indignantly.

Little Zhang didn’t know that his friend used to joke like this a lot, so he quickly said,””Brother song, I’ll get the restaurant to arrange another table. It’ll be done soon ...”
