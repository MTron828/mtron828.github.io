The world Fox that had just given itself the name Bai Qingqing was seriously trying to understand the spatial rules of the spirit map world. After the upgrade of this space, the rules seemed to have evolved a lot. Bai Qingqing carefully comprehended and felt that she had gained a lot of new insights.

Xia ruofei suddenly appeared beside Bai Qingqing, giving it a shock.

After Xia ruofei entered the medium, he stared at Bai Qingqing unblinkingly. It felt uncomfortable and couldn’t help but transmit his voice,””Hey! What are you looking at?”

Xia ruofei laughed.”I’ve lived for more than 20 years and have seen all kinds of beasts. This is the first time I’ve seen one that can speak. Shouldn’t I look at it with admiration?”

Bai Qingqing bared her teeth at Xia ruofei and transmitted her voice,””Is there anyone who looks up to me with such a wretched expression? Besides, I’m not dead, do I need you to look up to me?”

“Little brat! You have quite the temper!” Xia ruofei chuckled.”We’re business partners. Don’t be mean to me, okay?”

“You’ve already said that we’re business partners. Don’t you feel embarrassed to scam my world stones?” Bai Qingqing said, brooding.

“Hey, hey, hey! Why can’t we let this matter go?” Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.”I didn’t cheat you of your world stone! I can’t accept such false accusations!”

Bai Qingqing snorted and did not want to dwell on the matter. After a moment of silence, she asked,””Then when are you prepared to set off to search for the world stone? I think there are a lot of opportunities on the sea. Maybe we can find a cave abode like the green immortal abode ...”

Xia ruofei said,”I won’t be going out for a while. I still have my own business.” He couldn’t go out all day! Let’s rest for a while!”

Bai Qingqing mumbled,’what’s there to manage in the mortal world? What’s the use of earning more wealth? Cultivation is the most important!”

“What you said makes sense.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”but I have my own considerations. You don’t have to worry about it.”

Although Xia ruofei had become a cultivator, he had grown up in the secular world and had only been in contact with cultivation for one or two years. How could he not have any nostalgia for the wonderful world and be like those senior cultivators who had hidden from the world?

Furthermore, paradise Corporation was not just his career. This company was related to the livelihood of thousands of employees. How could Xia ruofei give it up so easily?

Bai Qingqing glared at Xia ruofei and said,””This is such a waste of time!”

“My cultivation efficiency is high. It won’t be delayed!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”as for finding the world stone, I always thought that it would depend on luck. As long as we are fated with the world stone, we will eventually find it even if it is far away. There is no rush.”

“Hmph! You can’t be taught!” Bai Qingqing had completely given up on the idea of changing Xia ruofei’s perception.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”Bai Qingqing ... That’s her name, right?” I didn’t get it wrong, did I? If you can’t wait, you can totally break up with me and go out to find world stones yourself! As long as you can leave this space, I will not stop you!”

Bai Qingqing thought to herself, I would like to leave you and look for him myself! However, how could world stones be so easily found? Moreover, the laws of space here are so profound that I’m afraid it won’t be easy for me to come back after I leave! I’m not going out!

In fact, Bai Qingqing agreed with the combination of her and Xia ruofei. The two of them could be said to be a strong combination. On Bai Qingqing’s own, no matter how fast she was, it would be difficult for her to cover all the places. On the other hand, Xia ruofei could easily search everywhere with advanced transportation.

In addition, it was impossible for Bai Qingqing to reach places like the Azure immortal abode in the vast sea. She could only go out to sea with Xia ruofei on a boat.

It said unhappily,”I’m too lazy to go out!” I’ll just stay here with you!”

“That’s what I’m looking for!”Xia ruofei laughed. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

After all, Bai Qingqing’s ability to sense the world stone was a huge help to him.

Xia ruofei continued,”enough!” Then do as you please! As long as you don’t cause any damage in the space, it’ll be fine! I’ll be off ...”

Bai Qingqing couldn’t be bothered to talk to Xia ruofei anymore. It waved its front paw and lay on the ground again. It closed its eyes and started to sense the spatial laws, as if it was asleep.

Naturally, Xia ruofei would not argue with Bai Qingqing. He looked at it with a smile, and then suddenly disappeared.

In the next moment, Xia ruofei appeared at the foot of the mountain in the mountain sea realm.

After several space upgrades, this unremarkable little hill had now become a mountain of ten thousand feet.

Xia ruofei’s figure flashed and he arrived at the cave halfway up the mountain.

He had come today to see if he could break the protective enchantment of the heaven jade talisman.

Initially, Xia ruofei thought that he would not be able to open the enchantment of the emperor’s jade talisman in a short period of time. After all, he had only managed to break through the enchantment of the earth talisman before he explored the ancient tomb. It had not been long since then.

However, after absorbing the Golden elixir of the purpleblood spirit Python at the green Immortal Island, Xia ruofei’s cultivation had improved by leaps and bounds. More importantly, his spiritual power had broken through a major realm and reached the spirit gathering realm.

Spiritual power was a very important factor in breaking the protective barrier.
