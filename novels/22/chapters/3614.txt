“Alright, you can recuperate here in peace!” Xia ruofei said,”I’ll come over every day to change your medicine and treat you. When you’ve recovered a little, you won’t have to stay in the ward anymore. Go back to Paradise Farm to recuperate. The environment there is better!”

“Thank you, ruofei!” Liang Qichao nodded and said.

“We’re brothers, no need to be so polite!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”Oh, I’ve told Daphne the address. She’ll visit you when she’s free!”

“En!” Liang Qichao nodded.

Xia ruofei stood up and was about to leave when he suddenly stopped and turned around.””Brother Liang, are you really not going to tell uncle and Auntie about this?”

“I’m afraid they’ll be worried! There’s a lot of work at home and the company, so don’t make things difficult for them.” Liang Qichao said,”we’re overseas, after all. I don’t feel good about letting the old man fly all the way here.” So … Even if you want to tell them, wait until I’m almost fully recovered before telling them.”

“Alright! I’ll respect your decision!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”what you need to do now is to calm down. With me around, I will definitely not let anything happen to you! Not only were your legs seriously injured, but your liver was also crushed and a part of it was removed. This is a very serious injury. You have to be mentally prepared, the recovery period will not be too fast!”

“I understand!” Liang Qichao said with a bitter smile,”I’m already very lucky to be able to survive this time! It would be even better if he could keep his legs! As for the rest… I really don’t dare to hope for anything!”

“Your leg will definitely be saved!” Xia ruofei said firmly,”! will not let you have your leg amputated!”

“I believe you!” Liang Qishi nodded heavily.

“Then I’ll go out first! You can rest in peace!” Xia ruofei said with a smile. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

He had just reached the door of the ward when Liang Qichao called out to him from behind.

“RUO Fei!”

Xia ruofei stopped in his tracks and turned around to look at Liang Qichao.””Brother Liang, is there anything else?”

“I want to ask… How do you plan to handle this matter?” Liang Qichao asked,”the kalini family is too powerful. Don’t go head to head with them!” If anything happens to you, I’ll have to bear the blame even if I die ten thousand times!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”leave the rest to me!” All you need to do is to recuperate in peace and don’t worry about anything else! Don’t worry, I’m not the kind of person who will rush up and fight to the death! Just wait for the results!”

“Alright then!” Liang Qichao said,”I believe you’ll handle it calmly. Ruofei, this isn’t our country after all. There are many obstacles here, so you have to be prepared for the difficulties!”

“Mm! I will!” Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. Then, he waved at Liang Qichao and said,”I’m leaving!”

As soon as Xia ruofei walked out of the ward, a nurse came up to him.

The nurse was also Chinese, and she spoke in Chinese,”Hello, Mr. Xia! I’ll be in charge of Mr. Liang’s care during this period. Is there anything you need?” “There’s nothing special to pay attention to. Just follow your nursing procedure!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you’ve worked hard!”

“You’re welcome! This is my job, it’s not hard!” The nurse said with a smile,”by the way, Mr. Tang and Dr. Qi are in the reception room on the second floor. I’ll Take You There!”

“Alright, you can recuperate here in peace!” Xia ruofei said,”I’ll come over every day to change your medicine and treat you. When you’ve recovered a little, you won’t have to stay in the ward anymore. Go back to Paradise Farm to recuperate. The environment there is better!”
