“It’s fine,” Liang Qichao said.”I have a dinner party tonight. I’ll get Daphne to attend it in my place.”

As the deputy manager of Paradise Farm, she was an Australian white woman. She was mainly responsible for the farm’s external contact, sales channel expansion, and so on. It made sense for her to attend such social events.

However, Xia ruofei still frowned and asked carefully,””What social event? It should be more important, right?”

The reason was simple. If it wasn’t an important social event, the farm workers wouldn’t have called Liang Qichao directly.

Besides, Xia ruofei noticed Liang Qichao’s awkward expression when he answered the phone. He was obviously considering Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao, which made him hesitate.

As Liang Qichao drove, he said honestly,””Yes, it’s a reception party for one of our important distributors. The distributors in Australia are very strong. Whether it’s agricultural products or wine business, we have to have a good relationship with several major distributors, otherwise we can’t sell at all.”

Xia ruofei nodded.”Yes, I’ve heard about it too. It’s mainly due to the spending habits of the Australian citizens. The few major supermarket chains have almost monopolized all the retail markets.”

“Who said it wasn ‘t?” Liang Qichao said with a bitter smile,”that’s why it’s not easy to get into the agricultural industry in Australia. I really don’t know why the local tycoons are so keen on buying farms here. I know a few who lost all their money!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”alright!” Stop the car! I’m not going to Sydney today!”

“It’ll be fine, ruofei,” Liang Qichao said quickly.”It’s the same if Daphne goes to the party on my behalf.”

“Brother Liang,” Lin Qiao said with a smile,”just stop the car if brother ruofei asks you to. You should listen to the boss!”

Xia ruofei added,”since it’s an important social gathering for a channel, it’s best for you to attend it personally as the person in charge of Paradise Farm. It’s to show that we value it!” We have a lot of freedom on this trip, so what does it matter if we go to Sydney a day earlier or later?”

“That’s right, brother Liang, I heard that the Hunter Valley’s garden is very fun too!”Lin Qiao also tried to persuade him. There are 12 gardens with different themes and styles. The scenery is beautiful. Why don’t I go there with brother ruofei today?”

Xia ruofei saw that Lin Qiao was so sensible and turned his head to smile at her. Lin Qiao made a funny face at Xia ruofei and then burst into laughter.

Liang Qichao could only nod and say,””Alright then! I’ll listen to you guys ...”

“It should be like this.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”business is more important!”

Liang Qichao nodded and turned to Lin Qiao.””Lin Qiao, have you decided to go to the Hunter Valley Garden?”

“Alright!” Lin Qiao smiled and said,”brother Liang, brother ruofei and I can go by ourselves. Don’t you have something to do?”

“The reception is at night. Time is a little tight if we go to Sydney, but we’re going to the Hunter Valley area, so I have to keep you guys company!” Liang Qichao smiled and said,”let’s go! Hunter Valley’s garden!”

With that, Liang Qichao turned the car around and drove back for a while before turning into a fork in the road, heading toward the Hunter Valley Garden.

On the way back, Liang Qichao also called to say that he would personally attend the reception that night.

Liang Qichao was a qualified driver and tour guide. He introduced the Hunter Valley Garden to Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao as he drove.

“Hunter Valley Garden is located in the historic bogolbin area, at the foot of the Brokenback Range in the center of Hunter vineyard ...”

“Wait! Brokenback Range?”Lin Qiao suddenly interrupted Liang Qichao as if she had discovered a new world. She said with a smile,”Brokeback Mountain? Brother Liang, it looks like that place is suitable for you to go with my brother ruofei!” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Xia ruofei and Liang Qichao suddenly felt a chill and shivered.

Xia ruofei glared at Lin Qiao and said,”You brat, if you keep talking, I’m really not taking you to Sydney! I’m so disgusted ...”

Liang Qichao used English because he was worried that the name would cause misunderstandings, but Lin Qiao, the English subject representative, noticed it.

“Lin Qiao, can’t you be a little bit healthier?” Liang Qichao asked with a bitter smile.

“I’m just joking!”Lin Qiao said with a mischievous smile. You and my brother are both real men! A true straight man, okay!”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry,”Qiao’ er, can you be more ladylike?” Why are you saying everything ...”

“Hehe, why do you need to be a lady in front of brother ruofei!”

As they chatted and laughed, the car soon arrived at the Hunter Valley area’s famous attraction, the Hunter Valley Garden.

After Liang Qichao parked the car, he said to Xia ruofei,””I’ve been here three times. I still have something to do at the farm, so I won’t be going in. There are restaurants in the scenic Area. I’ll come to pick you up at around four in the afternoon!”

Liang Qichao was the person in charge of Paradise Farm, managing a 6000 – hectare farm. He was usually very busy with work. He had originally pushed back some work to accompany Xia ruofei and the others to Sydney. Since he was not going for the time being, he naturally wanted to go back to work.

Immortal Land Farm wasn’t far from here anyway.

“Alright, go do your work!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”we don’t have to pick her up in the afternoon. We can just call a taxi here.”

“It’s fine, it’s fine. I’ll pick you up on time in the afternoon.” Liang Qichao said,”there aren’t many rental cars in the Hunter Valley, but there are quite a number of public buses. However, we can’t let a Big Boss like you take the public bus!”

Xia ruofei laughed. Since Liang Qichao insisted, he would just let him be.

Everyone bid farewell at the Hunter Valley’s garden. Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao strolled around leisurely.

The entire Scenic Area was very large, covering more than 60 acres, consisting of 10 international – themed unique gardens.

Each garden was unique and dazzling.

A variety of cultural characteristics intertwined and presented in the same space and time, contradictory yet harmonious, full of wonderful dreamy beauty.

In this beautiful combination of sight, color, and fragrance, there was an eight – kilometer long walking path. As one wandered along it, the beautiful scenery in front of them would constantly change.

The elegance and peace of the eastern garden, the grace and luxury of the Italy Cave Garden and the India mosaic tea garden ... Besides being pleasing to the eye, there was also a wonderful feeling of traveling the world.

Lin Qiao held Xia ruofei’s arm tightly and looked very happy.

Even Xia ruofei felt more at peace as he walked around the quiet and elegant place without hearing the noise of the horses and the rumbling of the machines. He took a nap under the shade of the trees and enjoyed the coolness while listening to the moving Australian winter Song.

When they arrived at the famous fairy – tale themed garden, Lin Qiao couldn’t help but cheer when she saw the characters in the fairy tales she had read when she was young.

Almost every step here was like a fairy tale. Even Xia ruofei felt as if he had returned to his childhood, evoking many childhood memories.

Xia ruofei did not notice that when Lin Qiao saw the beautiful fairy – tale images of princes and princesses, she held his arm even tighter and her eyes revealed a trace of hazy tenderness.

The two of them strolled around the Hunter Valley’s garden, and before they knew it, it was already noon. They found a very special restaurant to have lunch.

After resting for a while in the restaurant, the two of them strolled around a theme garden. Seeing that it was almost time, they started to head back.

When they were near the exit of the scenic Area, an uncertain voice suddenly came from behind them.””Lin Qiao?”

The two of them turned to look at the source of the voice. Lin Qiao also showed a trace of surprise and shouted,””Tan Lili! What a coincidence, you’re also in Australia!”

Xia ruofei saw a young man and woman standing at the fork in the road. The girl was about 18 or 19 years old, but she was dressed more maturely. It was winter in Australia, and she was wearing a white T – Shirt with a deep V – shape. She had a thin knitted jacket on the outside, and the diamond necklace on her white chest was very eye – catching. She was also wearing a pair of purple high heels. The makeup on her face was thick, especially the blood – Red lipstick on her thick lips. She looked a little comical.

Xia ruofei really did not understand why she would wear high heels on a trip. Many places in the Hunter Valley Garden were trekked. Xia ruofei was a little confused. Wouldn’t this lady’s feet be disabled after walking two kilometers in these clothes?

The man next to tan Lili was also dressed in a strange way. He was wearing a Versace suit, a well – ironed tie, shiny leather shoes, and shiny hair. This outfit would not have been found to be a problem at any dinner party, but it seemed a little out of place in a tourist attraction.

In contrast, Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao were dressed more casually. They were wearing ordinary casual clothes, sweatpants, and flat canvas shoes. Their clothes were from the second – tier brands in the country, but they were very comfortable.

Tan Lili looked at Xia ruofei, who was being held tightly by Lin Qiao, and said with a smile,””I’m in Australia for a vacation! Lin Qiao, is this your boyfriend?” I’ve never heard of you in a relationship in school!”

Xia ruofei was about to explain, but Lin Qiao held him even tighter. She blushed and said,””Yup! We also came to Australia during the summer vacation ...”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment. He did not know what Lin Qiao was up to. However, since Lin Qiao had said so, he could not expose her in front of outsiders. So, he smiled at tan Lili and nodded as a greeting.

Tan Lili looked at Xia ruofei’s cheap outfit and a look of contempt flashed across her eyes. She followed suit and held the man’s arm tightly. Her bulging chest was pressed against him without any hesitation.

Tan Lili smiled and said,”Lin Qiao, let me introduce you. This is my boyfriend, Zheng Peng. His family has bought a winery in Hunter Valley. I’m here with him for a vacation!”
