2753 The arrangement_1

Qingfeng Luo and Zheng Yongshou both looked at Yifu li, who was walking in from the door.

It was Luo Qingfeng’s first time meeting Li Yifu. Xia ruofei said,””Qingfeng, this is a junior from my sect. His name is Li Yifu. In the future, when I’m not around, you will listen to his commands!”

Li Yifu was only a low – Level cultivator at refined Qi Level 4. Such a cultivation could only be ranked in the lower – Middle range of the star Seizer sect. In the past, Luo Qingfeng, who was a golden core cultivator, would not even look at him. However, it was different now. Xia ruofei had personally ordered him to do something. How could Luo Qingfeng dare to slight him?

“Yes, master!” Luo Qingfeng quickly replied.

Xia ruofei said,”alright, it’s already past midnight. You guys should rest.” There are a lot of empty rooms here, Wang Boshan, go and arrange it!”

“Yes, master!” Wang Boshan quickly replied.

Xia ruofei gestured to Li Yifu, and he quickly followed Xia ruofei.

The two of them went to the luxurious suite that Xia ruofei was staying in.

As soon as he entered, Li Yifu asked impatiently,””Grand uncle – Master, did the process of capturing Luo Qingfeng go smoothly? Are you hurt?”

Although he had already seen Luo Qingfeng standing respectfully below Xia ruofei, Li Yifu still felt like he was dreaming. After all, he was facing a golden core cultivator! Although Luo Qingfeng did not deliberately emit his aura, Li Yifu could not help but feel the pressure when he stood in front of Luo Qingfeng. This was the suppression of the level of life. In a sense, golden core cultivators had completely broken away from the scope of ordinary people and could even be regarded as a higher level of life.

Of course, Li Yifu knew that the result was a success. What he was most worried about was whether Xia ruofei had encountered any danger or gotten injured in the process of subduing Luo Qingfeng.

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”the process was indeed a little complicated, but it was finally completed successfully!” Don’t worry! I’m not injured, and I even got a lot of benefits ...”

“Benefits?” Li Yifu was a little confused. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Xia ruofei smiled and didn’t say anything. He directly released his cultivation aura.

Li Yifu was stunned for a moment, then his eyes widened and he looked at Xia ruofei in surprise. He cried out,””Grand uncle – Master, you ... You ... You’ve broken through?”

Although Xia ruofei’s aura was not as obvious as Luo Qingfeng ‘s, Li Yifu, who was a cultivator, could still feel the similarities between the two. There was only one explanation for this. Xia ruofei had also broken through to that level.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”you’re quite lucky. You’ve finally broken through a major realm. However, you haven’t really reached the Golden core stage. I’ll explain this to you later.” Speaking of which ... Luo Qingfeng’s contribution to the successful breakthrough this time can not be overlooked!”

“He helped you break through?” For a moment, Li Yifu felt that his brain was not enough. In the end, he made a guess that he thought was the most reasonable,”grand uncle – Master, did you try to break through directly after you subdued him? Did he give you some help during your breakthrough?”

Xia ruofei smiled and shook his head.””It’s not that simple ... I did misjudge Luo Qingfeng’s strength, which almost caused the Taixu xuanqing formation to collapse. With no other choice, I could only force myself to inject vital energy into the formation to maintain it and cultivate to absorb spiritual energy at the same time to offset the rapid consumption. In the end ... I used too much force when I started cultivating, and I reached the point of breakthrough ...”

Li Yifu took a deep breath. He could feel how dangerous the situation was just by listening to Xia ruofei’s simple description.

Li Yifu felt that his heart could not take it anymore. With a look of disbelief, he said,””Senior granduncle, you’re saying that ... You ... Broke through at the last minute?”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”not only that. At that time, Luo Qingfeng had already broken through a few layers of arrays and was near the core array board. I was at the critical moment of my breakthrough and could not move at all. Now that I think about it, I’m still a little scared.”

After that, Xia ruofei called Li Yifu to the sofa and sat down. He took out some tea leaves to make tea and explained the whole battle in detail to him.

This time, he had subdued a golden core cultivator and indirectly controlled a cultivation sect. Besides, his cultivation had also broken through a major realm. Furthermore, the Paradise of cultivation had finally overcome its crisis and become one of his strongest trump cards. Many happy events had befallen him at the same time. Naturally, Xia ruofei was very excited. With his mind so active, he could not fall asleep at all.

Hence, Xia ruofei simply told Li Yifu about it in detail. After all, he wanted to share such a happy thing with others. Of course, he had definitely hidden the part about the spirit map scroll.

As for the breakthrough part, he said that he was struggling to break through a bottleneck. In the end, Luo Qingfeng’s palm full of vital Qi happened to become a helping hand, allowing him to break through the bottleneck in one fell swoop and quickly complete the breakthrough. Then, he was able to reverse the disadvantage.

After Li Yifu heard this, he couldn’t help but be secretly speechless. At the same time, he felt a wave of fear. He said,””Martial granduncle, it was really too dangerous this time! If it wasn’t for your great fortune and your Swift reaction, you might have already ...”
