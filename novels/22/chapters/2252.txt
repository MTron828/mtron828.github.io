Xia ruofei had wanted to decline, but on second thought, xiangnan TV had spared no effort in promoting the peach blossom company. Although the company had also provided a lot of support to the filming of the show, whether it was in terms of manpower or material resources, considering the sky – High advertising and title sponsorship fees of a popular show, it was obvious that the peach blossom company had received far more than what they had paid. Therefore, Xia ruofei felt that it was not good to reject Gao Jun’s invitation. Otherwise, it would seem unreasonable.

He pondered for a moment and said with a smile,””Then I’ll accept your invitation!”

Gao Jun was overjoyed and quickly said,””It’s our honor to invite President Xia! President Xia, then let’s meet at the Wang family’s private kitchen, ya Qing’s private room, at 6:30 pm. I’ll see you there!”

“I won’t leave until we meet!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”by the way, do you mind if I bring two friends with me?”

“Of course I don’t mind!” Gao Jun replied. You can bring as many as you want! The more people there are, the more lively it is!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei smiled.”See you tonight then!”

“See you tonight!” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Xia ruofei, Qin Yanan, and he Yu got into the business car arranged by the festival team and left the Paradise gathering’s filming location. They returned to the courtyard house in liuhai Lane.

When they got home, Xia ruofei said to Qin Yanan,””You’ve all worked hard these two days! Have a good rest in the afternoon and come to the banquet with me tonight. ”

“Alright, director Xia!” Qin Yanan said,”Oh right, I have something to report to you.”

“Speak!”

“The festival team has discussed with us whether we can help to promote this show on social platforms.” Qin Yanan said.

“My personal social media account?” Xia ruofei asked.

“We’re thinking of using your personal account to post news about the show’s recording, and then repost it on your official account.” Qin Yanan said.

It was now the era of the fan economy, and Feng Jing paid a lot of attention to social media. Therefore, peach blossom company had several large and small social media accounts, including peach blossom company’s official account, as well as the certified accounts for peach blossom vegetables, peach blossom Da Hong Pao, Jade skin cream, and other products. Moreover, these accounts were opened simultaneously on Weibo, TikTok, and other social media platforms, forming a publicity matrix.

However, in terms of influence, Xia ruofei’s personal account had the highest number of fans and the most active fans. This was, of course, due to Xia ruofei’s unparalleled popularity on the internet.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,””No problem! I’ll leave this matter in your hands!”

As the person in charge of Xia ruofei’s assistant team, Qin Yanan also had Xia ruofei’s social media account password. Xia ruofei did not have to personally do the daily maintenance or publicity of the account.

“Alright, President Xia.” Qin Yanan nodded.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and reminded,””By the way, let the festival Group know before you post anything. They must have a set of promotional procedures in mind. We can’t post anything casually in case we accidentally spoil the story.”

“President Xia, don’t worry!” Qin Yanan smiled and said,”the festival Group has selected some still photos and sent them to me. These have passed their internal review. The material is selected from these, so there will definitely be no problems.”

“That’s good!” Xia ruofei said,”you have to do this well. After all, xiangnan TV is a good friend. We can’t hold them back. We’ll help them if we need to!”

“Understood!” Qin Yanan said,”President Xia, please rest for a while! We’re going back to our room!”

“Mm! Tell Wu Qiang that he doesn’t need to prepare dinner for us tonight. Just come and call me before we set off in the evening. ” Xia ruofei said indifferently.

“Alright!”

Qin Yanan and he Yu returned to the guest room in the front yard, while Xia ruofei returned to the suite in the master’s yard.

After he put down his luggage, he changed out of his clothes and placed them into two laundry baskets. When Xia ruofei was living here, Wu Xiujuan would come over to clean up the house every day. He just had to sort out his clothes and Wu Xiujuan would take them to wash. The clothes in one of the laundry baskets could be machine – washed directly, while the clothes in the other basket had to be sent to the dry cleaner for dry cleaning. After all, Xia ruofei had many coats from expensive luxury brands, and the workmanship and fabric were very expensive. If they were washed in the washing machine, they might not be able to wear it next time.

Of course, Xia ruofei was still not used to having someone else take care of his undergarments. He would usually wash them with his hands after his shower.

He took out a set of clean home clothes from the space and went to the bathroom to take a hot shower. After changing into dry clothes, he suddenly felt relaxed.

After living in the mushroom house for more than a day, although it was not hard, it was not as convenient as at home. Not to mention other things, they even had to line up to take a bath. During the recording process, there were many staff members watching in places where the camera could not capture. There were also cameras everywhere. No matter how relaxed they were, it was impossible to reach the leisurely state that the show presented.

After taking a shower, Xia ruofei lay comfortably on the soft lounge chair in the living room. As he rocked back and forth, he took out his phone and dialed Hou Liang’s number.

“Brother Xia! You’re done recording?” Hou Liang asked enthusiastically the moment he picked up the phone.
