Xia ruofei was so excited that he unknowingly used the same tactic used in the Army to boost morale. However, the effect was really good!

Everyone shouted in unison,””There are!”

The sound was so loud that even the staff passing by outside the meeting room could hear it. They couldn’t help but wonder,”What were these executives doing inside? Why does it look like a legendary marketing company?

Xia ruofei gestured with his hands.”I’m just informing everyone about the dividends. We still need to plan how to implement it. Let’s talk about the sales of the beluga first.”

The company had invested a lot of money to build the pomfrei cultivation workshop, and it had always been a big eater. It was a waste of money to serve these delicate pomfrets well. Now that the day had finally come, the person in charge of pomfrets breeding, Jiang Hua, was very excited.

When Xia ruofei talked about this, he looked at Jiang Hua and laughed,””Jiang Hua, you’re the most familiar with the pomfrets. Tell me!” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Chief Xia, chief Feng, and the other leaders.” Jiang Hua nodded and said. The success of the pomfrets will bring a large and stable cash flow to the company. The United States pomfrets on the market are several grades lower than our Yangtze River pomfrets, but the customers are still flocking to them, and the price is a few hundred per catty. So once our pomfrets are put on the market, it will definitely bring a wave!”

Jiang Hua paused for a moment before he continued,”However, there’s a problem that I don’t know how to solve ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you want to talk about the transportation problem, right?” I’ve already thought about this, so let’s not talk about it now. I’ll tell you later. ”

Jiang Hua was stunned for a moment, but he quickly nodded and said,”Okay, President Xia. If we don’t consider the transportation problem, there are two things that need to be confirmed. The first is the price, and the second is the sales channel.”

“Mm! Let’s talk about the price first!” Xia ruofei turned to the marketing director, Xiao Qiang, and asked,”director Xiao, do you have any suggestions from the marketing department?”

Xiao Qiang had received Feng Rao’s notice yesterday, so he was prepared. After being called by Xia ruofei, he cleared his throat and said,””Mr. Xia, we’ve done a preliminary survey on the market situation, mainly on the sales of United States perch. According to public information, the price of American Chinese perch ranges from 300 to 800 Yuan. The quality and taste of our company’s Yangtze River Chinese perch are several grades higher. I don’t think we can be too conservative in terms of pricing.”

“Do you have any information on the market sales of the Chinese perch?” Feng Rao asked.

“The Chinese perch went extinct 20 to 30 years ago,” said Xiao Qiang with a bitter smile. “The prices in the 1970s and 1980s have long since lost their value as reference. “We’ve looked up some news. Two years ago, there was a Chinese perch in su Nan. At that time, a Chinese perch of about one catty was sold for 8000 Yuan. However, there’s not much reference value in this case ...”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,” 8000 is indeed too high. After all, we’re selling it in bulk. It’s not good to have a high threshold ... Let me say my opinion!” I know there was a deal a year ago for two Chinese perch, and the unit price was 3000 Yuan per 500 grams. I think we can refer to this price and set it between 3500 and 5000 Yuan. ”

In fact, this was the analysis that Ling Xiaotian had told Xia ruofei. He felt that it was very reasonable.

However, the price was in line with everyone’s expectations, including Jiang Hua.

After a short discussion, Feng Jing smiled and said,””Why don’t we set it at 3888! Give me an auspicious number!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”sure!” We’ll do as President Feng says! However, you have to remember that you have to provide 300 catties of pomfrets to the Ling’s private restaurant every month. This portion of the fish will be settled at the price of 2000 Yuan per catty. ”

Jiang Hua and Xiao Qiang nodded in unison and said,”Alright!”

Everyone knew about the relationship between Xia ruofei and Ling Ji restaurant, so they were not surprised and would not object to it.

Feng Rao felt a strange sourness in her heart, but she concealed her disappointment and said,””There’s also the problem of the sales channel that Jiang Hua just mentioned. Of course, the chairman hasn’t said how to solve the transportation problem yet!”

“Director Xiao, what do you guys think?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

Xia ruofei didn’t want to make all the decisions by himself. At this time, he still had to listen to everyone’s opinions because he knew that Xiao Qiang and the others must have worked overtime yesterday to prepare. If he made a decision by himself, it would inevitably hurt their enthusiasm.

Sure enough, Xiao Qiang said,”we had a meeting last night to study it. We feel that the channels of online e – commerce are very strong now, and we have good cooperation with them. For example, the cat supermarket and jingbei supermarket have fresh food sales business, and even the sales volume has exceeded many traditional channels. If we can solve the transportation problem, it is a better choice to cooperate with them.”

At this point, Xiao Qiang felt that he was being too absolute, so he added,”Of course, it’s necessary to set aside a portion of the Chinese perch for local sales. After all, the Paradise corporation’s headquarters is in the three mountains, and we have a great influence in the three mountains area.”

Xia ruofei nodded and listened to Jiang Hua, Feng Rao, and the others ‘opinions. Then, he said,””In principle, I agree with director Xiao’s opinion. The marketing department can start contacting a few e – commerce companies. If there are any e – commerce companies that are interested in working with us, we welcome them to come to the company for an inspection!”

“Alright!” Xiao Qiang saw that Xia ruofei had accepted his suggestion and was very excited. He quickly wrote it down in his notebook.

Xia ruofei continued.”I hope that our cooperation will not be limited to low – Level cooperation like that of a sales agent. I hope that our e – commerce partners can provide us with some resources and establish a concept for everyone.”

“Is this the high – end concept of our Taoyuan brand’s Yangtze River pomfrets?” Feng Rao asked with a smile.

Xia ruofei nodded and continued,””Yes, but it’s not comprehensive. We keep emphasizing our high – end, that’s for sure. There’s another concept. I hope that through the powerful e – commerce channels, we can be deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. This will involve the transportation problem that I didn’t mention earlier. ”

Everyone’s attention was immediately drawn over.

Xia ruofei said,”I thought about it yesterday. I also asked for some opinions. I feel that the only way for us to solve the transportation problem is to freeze the pomfrets.”

“Frozen?” Jiang Hua cried out. He was somewhat disappointed.

Xia ruofei told him what Ling Xiaotian had analyzed for him yesterday.

Then he added,”our cold storage is ready. The equipment is also very advanced. We can conduct an experiment first to verify if freezing and then thawing will have an obvious impact on the taste of the pomfrets.”

“Alright, I’ll organize the experiment immediately,” Jiang Hua nodded.

Xia ruofei said,”if the quick – freezing method is feasible, then we have to solve the issue of transportation time limit. If we cooperate with e – commerce companies, we can coordinate Air Resources through them. I don’t think it will be a big problem.”

“I understand. I’ll contact several major e – commerce companies at the same time,” said Xiao Qiang.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes, it’s what I said just now. Other than establishing a high – end image, we also have to promote it through e – commerce so that everyone can accept the concept of frozen transportation of pomfrets.” Just like the Bluefin tuna, it must be transported in frozen conditions, but the price is still extremely high. As long as everyone forms this mindset, it will not be a problem. ”

Xia ruofei paused and continued,””Director Xiao, if necessary, we can also contact some internet trolls to create a batch of soft articles, including content about the frozen pomfrets. After we start selling them, we have to create a wave of public opinion on the internet without leaving any traces. Then, it’ll basically be done!”
