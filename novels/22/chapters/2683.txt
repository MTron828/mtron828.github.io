2684 A thorough investigation (1)

Xia ruofei took the elevator directly from the underground parking lot of the project building to the floor where Liu Qingfeng’s office was located.

“President Xia!” Liu Qingfeng was waiting at the door. When he saw Xia ruofei walking over from afar, he immediately came up to him and said,”everything is ready! The second batch of people will leave by boat today!”

Xia ruofei nodded.”I’m going to go through everyone who’s staying behind today. I’ll make sure that no one is left out!”

“Yes! Most of them are gathered in the conference room downstairs. ” Liu Qingfeng replied,”there are only a few key positions that must be guarded. I have arranged for people in the same positions to be interviewed by you first. After the interview, if there is no problem, they will go back and replace the remaining people!”

“Very good!” Xia ruofei nodded and said,”Qingfeng, you’ve worked hard these few days! When this is over, I’ll have a good talk with elder Liu about your performance here. ”

Liu Qingfeng suddenly revealed a trace of joy and said,”Thank you, director Xia! Thank you, President Xia!”

He had been working so hard these days just so that Xia ruofei could put in a few good words for him.

Perhaps in order to show more enthusiasm, Liu Qingfeng hesitated and said,””President Xia, I’ve thought of a question ...”

“Oh? Tell me about it!” Xia ruofei said in an encouraging tone,”I might miss something if I think about it alone.”

“Alright!” Liu Qingfeng said,”I’ve been observing the measures you’ve taken in the past two days. The main purpose should be to keep it a secret. But if someone in this group is not suitable and is sent back to the country first, then The Secret of You coming to Paradise Island will be exposed, right? Is it ... When the time comes, we can control these people first and send them back when you’re done with your business?”

Xia ruofei was very low – Key this time. Most of the people he came into contact with were the middle management of the original project and a few guards. He did not have any direct contact with the other staff and workers. Hence, those who had returned to the country first on the list did not know about Xia ruofei’s arrival on Paradise Island.

Xia ruofei had screened most of the middle – Level managers who stayed. Only a few of them had revealed the news of the change of ownership to their families. Xia ruofei had already contacted the Liu family and temporarily controlled them after returning to the country. At least, they would not be able to contact the outside world for a while.

A few other guards who had come into contact with Xia ruofei were also on the list.

The only possible problem would be the group of people who had been decided to stay. After Xia ruofei’s “interview”, if any of them failed and were sent back, they would have already known that Xia ruofei was on Peach Blossom Island. It would be difficult to keep this a secret.

Liu Qingfeng also saw that all of Xia ruofei’s actions these two days revolved around secrecy, so he felt that he might have found a loophole. After a few moments of hesitation, he decided to tell Xia ruofei.

Hearing this, Xia ruofei smiled and said,””The fact that you raised this question shows that you’ve put in a lot of effort. Not bad! Not bad!”

Liu Qingfeng was stunned. Then, he asked,”President Xia, then ... Do you think we should follow my suggestion? even if this batch of people doesn’t pass the test, we shouldn’t let them leave Peach Blossom Island for the time being?”

Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand,”no problem!” Qingfeng, how did you inform them?”

“According to your instructions, they said that they were going to take the psychological test from the peach blossom company’s headquarters, but they didn’t mention your name ... But ... Didn’t they want to meet you face to face?” This ... This ... Doesn’t seem to make any sense ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you’ll know soon enough!” I’ll be borrowing your office for a while. ”

“Ah?” Liu Qingfeng was stunned for a moment before he reacted,”Oh! This way, please!”

Xia ruofei walked into Liu Qingfeng’s office, took off his backpack, and put it on the sofa in the reception area. Then, he said to Liu Qingfeng,”Wait for me outside for a few minutes.”

“Yes, President Xia!” Liu Qingfeng quickly nodded and replied, then left the office and locked the door for Xia ruofei.

He went to the corridor outside the door and waited. He was also wondering in his heart. This CEO Xia had been very mysterious when he came to Peach Garden Island this time. Most of the time, he would either stay in the sealed airport warehouse or wander around the island. Now, he was going to interview the remaining employees. It was obvious that he had to meet them face to face, but he asked him to be ambiguous when giving out the notice. He also specifically instructed him not to reveal his identity. Why was he going through so much trouble?

Liu Qingfeng didn’t wait long before he heard Xia ruofei’s voice from the office.””Qingfeng, come in!” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Yes!” Liu Qingfeng quickly pushed the door open and walked into the office.

As soon as he entered the door, Liu Qingfeng could not help but be stunned. There was an unfamiliar middle – aged man standing in front of him, and Xia ruofei was nowhere to be seen.

The middle – aged man’s skin was a little dark, and he had a little eye bags. He was wearing a white shirt and black trousers that were very common for white – collar workers in the company. He had a red striped tie on and was looking at him with a smile.

“You ... You are ...” Liu Qingfeng hesitantly asked.
