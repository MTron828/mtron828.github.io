When Xia ruofei passed the ball, he was still quite far away from the opponent’s goal. Moreover, Wu Lei had already formed a single blade. Hence, every time he rushed forward, he just stood there and watched.

When he saw that Wu Lei changed his shot to a pass at the last minute after he rolled big, iglesias picked up a big pie and ate it, he could not help but laugh.

It had only been eight minutes since the match started, and Wu Lei had already gotten two assists.

But he was clearly a forward!

Wu Lei, who was a little breathless as he was pressed down on the grass by Iglesia, was also depressed that he didn’t want to help! I’ve always had the heart to score a goal!

More and more RCD Espanyol players rushed up, and Wu Lei could not move under the pressure. It was only when Xia ruofei grinned and pulled everyone away that Wu Lei was released.

Xia ruofei whispered into Wu Lei’s ear,””Don’t worry, the game has just begun! We both have to score in this game, and I’ll continue to feed you the ball!”

Wu Lei was a little embarrassed and said,””Brother Xia, I didn’t expect that I would make such a big mistake at the critical moment ...”

“I’m fine! It’s fine! You can’t care too much about things like throwing a single blade! Otherwise, the more the netizens ridicule you, the more pressure you’ll feel!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”and your mental strength is good enough. You made the right choice to pass the ball in a flash and not force a goal! This means that you’re calm enough!”

Xia ruofei patted Wu Lei’s shoulder and said,””Let’s go! Let them kick off quickly and try to help you complete your goal in the first half!”

After conceding two goals in a short eight minutes, the players of Herona were a little flustered. Their manager was shouting orders on the sidelines, in sharp contrast to Ruby’s calm and composed demeanor.

Under the manager’s loud reminder, the players of Herona finally calmed down a little. After the restart, they were not in a hurry to attack. Instead, they first stabilized their defense. With the momentum of the Spanish team today, if they dared to press on and attack in a short time, they might accidentally lose another goal.

Since the Spanish were so confident, Herona chose to avoid them.

Under such a guiding principle, they finally managed to stabilize their position.

The Espanyol’s full – Game close – on tactics were physically exhausting. Unless everyone was as energetic as Xia ruofei, it was impossible to use this tactic for the entire game.

As the Spaniards ‘pressure gradually decreased, Jerona was finally able to control some of the ball.

Although Spain’s possession rate had declined, they still had the initiative on the field, especially when Xia ruofei took the ball in the middle, which often posed a threat.

Now, as long as Xia ruofei took the ball, Herona would have at least two players come over to defend. If it was a dangerous area, more people would quickly come over.

Even so, it was difficult for them to snatch the ball from Xia ruofei’s feet.

In the 19th minute of the game, Xia ruofei took the ball from his back 33 meters away from the opponent’s goal. After a beautiful Marseille turn, the opponent’s player directly grabbed Xia ruofei’s Jersey and pulled him to the ground.

The referee whistled and the referee quickly ran to the foul spot. As he ran, he took out a yellow card from his shirt pocket and flashed it at the player who had fouled.

Espanyol was awarded a free kick 33 meters away from the goal, slightly to the left of the middle. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))
