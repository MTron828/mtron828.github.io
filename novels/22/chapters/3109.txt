3110  Finally meeting (2)

  "Alright!" Chen Xuan nodded and said,"Chairman, leaders, I'll head over first!"

  Chen Xuan felt that Xia ruofei was familiar, especially his eyes. He felt like he had seen them before. However, in comparison, an ordinary person from the secular world was naturally not as interesting as the code he was writing. Therefore, Chen Xuan couldn't be bothered to think too much about it. Since he had already dealt with the situation here, he had to hurry back to his coding.

  The reason why Xia ruofei said so much was because he wanted to observe Chen Xuan's reaction.

  From the few words that he had exchanged, Xia ruofei could basically confirm that Chen Xuan did not recognize him at all. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

  Xia ruofei's spiritual power was much higher than Chen Xuan 's. It was impossible for Chen Xuan to hide his emotions in front of Xia ruofei.

  This discovery calmed Xia ruofei down a little.

  However, he still had a lot of questions.

  Chen Xuan's appearance in his company was simply too illogical.

  Even if Chen Xuan wanted to cultivate in the mortal world, he would most likely choose to go to the first heaven society. Even if he didn't want to train in his own industry, there were many companies outside that were hiring. Especially if Chen Xuan used a programmer as a cover, there was actually a wide range of choices. Moreover, no matter how you looked at it, those more mature e - commerce platforms were more attractive. In contrast, peach blossom company started with agricultural products and lacked the temperament of the internet.

  Taking ten thousand steps back, even if Chen Xuan didn't have a 100% chance of going to an internet company to gain experience, there would still be a large number of companies and positions for him to choose from. The probability of directly applying for a job at paradise Corporation was actually very low.

  Naturally, Xia ruofei did not think that it was a coincidence that Chen Xuan was working at the Paradise Corporation.

  Especially after he had paid a visit to the first heaven society, he was filled with vigilance.

  Even if Chen Xuan didn't know Xia ruofei's true identity, what about Chen Nanfeng, the sect leader of the heavenly sect? Xia ruofei guessed that Chen Xuan's arrival at the Paradise Corporation was most likely Chen Nanfeng's order. Then, what was Chen Nanfeng's purpose for sending Chen Xuan to the Paradise Corporation? Did Chen Nanfeng have any ill intentions?

  Xia ruofei felt that everything was confusing and he had to be careful.

  Because if he made a wrong move, he might be doomed eternally. It might even affect the people close to him. After all, it seemed like the first heaven society had already seen through his background.

  Hence, during the inspection, Xia ruofei was more or less absent - minded because his mind was not on the company at all.

  However, he concealed it quite well, so Feng Jing and Dong Yun didn't notice it.

  After a quick inspection of the entire company, Xia ruofei took the special elevator to the chairman's office floor with Feng Jing.

  Dong Yun had already left, and there were no outsiders in the office, so Feng Jing's attitude was a lot more relaxed. She smiled and asked,""Ruofei, I'll give you a detailed report on the work we've done during this period. However, you'll have to wait for a while. Some specific data and reports are on my desk. I'll have someone send them over first. "

  Xia ruofei thought for a while."Sister che, I have a general understanding of the company's situation. I don't think we should be in a hurry to listen to the specific report."

  Feng Rao was stunned for a moment before she said,""That works too! You can decide. "

  In fact, Feng Jing's reporting was a normal procedure. After all, Xia ruofei was the boss of the company. No matter how much authority he gave, Feng Jing was still a Senior Manager. Xia ruofei could give up as much authority as he wanted, but Feng Jing had to be in the right position. Hence, every time Xia ruofei returned, Feng Jing would report everything to him. This was also a form of attitude.

  However, since Xia ruofei was not in the mood to listen to the report, Feng Jing would not insist on reporting it now. Xia ruofei smiled and said,"let's put the report aside for now." I'm quite interested in the development of the Tao Yuan mall project, and yang Xincheng is also a newly promoted management. If he's in the system, as the leader, I will definitely talk to him, so ... I think we should talk to yang Xincheng first!"

  "No problem!" Feng Jing smiled and said,"the peach blossom mall project is indeed the company's inappropriate.

  In a short while, Xia ruofei had understood the whole process of Chen Xuan's promotion.

  In the end, Xia ruofei smiled and said,"President yang, you have the demeanor of a Bo Le!" For this Chen Xuan to be able to work in our company, we have really picked up a treasure! President yang, you've contributed a lot!"

most important project in the near future. In the future, the proportion of internet marketing will become larger and larger. You can talk to yang Xincheng personally and highlight the importance the company places on the development Department. It's quite good!"

  "Then tell someone to inform yang Xincheng to come up!" Xia ruofei smiled and said,"then go do   "You flatter me, Chairman!" Yang Xincheng quickly replied.

  "Then tell someone to inform yang Xincheng to come up!" Xia ruofei smiled and said,"then go do your own things. I'll call you directly if I need anything here!"

  "Alright!" Feng Jing nodded and said,"I'll arrange it!"

  ……

  Soon, yang Xincheng came to Xia ruofei's office with excitement.

  Xia ruofei smiled and invited yang Xincheng to the guest area. He even made tea for him personally, which made yang Xincheng feel flattered.

  Then, Xia ruofei asked about the Paradise Mall in a casual tone.

  Of course, this was just a pretense. After listening to yang Xincheng's report on the progress of the project, Xia ruofei naturally changed the topic to Chen Xuan.

  During the inspection, yang Xincheng was the one who introduced Chen Xuan to Xia ruofei and the others. Hence, Xia ruofei's interest in Chen Xuan didn't make yang Xincheng feel that it was inappropriate.

  In a short while, Xia ruofei had understood the whole process of Chen Xuan's promotion. In the end, Xia ruofei smiled and said,"President yang, you have the demeanor of a Bo Le!"
