2595 Dumbfounded (2)

“Are you trying to say that you’ve been taking medicine for a long time?” Xia ruofei laughed.”That’s strange. You’ve been recuperating for such a long time, but there’s no effect at all. Why did all the symptoms disappear after touching the pill? How could there be such a coincidence?”

Liu Lifang was speechless. After a while, she said,”I just touched the surface of the pill with my hand. If this can cure diseases, wouldn’t your medicine be divine? I’ve never heard of any medicine that can take effect just by touching it, and it’s so effective! I don’t think you’ve ever heard of such an outrageous thing!”

“You haven’t heard of it because you’re ignorant!” Xia ruofei said without any hesitation.

Liu Lifang glared at Xia ruofei.””You ...”

Xia ruofei interrupted her and stared into her eyes.”Before I left, did I repeatedly remind you not to let the pill come into contact with your skin? If it wasn’t for the fact that the medicine would quickly lose its effect after coming into contact with the human skin, why would I have to explain it so seriously?”

“Even if the medicinal properties were lost after I touched it, what does it have to do with the disappearance of my chronic symptoms?” Liu Lifang explained helplessly.

“Isn’t that easy to understand? That’s because a small portion of the lost medicinal properties has been absorbed by your body!” Xia ruofei sneered.”You’re really something! That’s elder Liu’s life – saving medicine. As the old man’s daughter, you actually destroyed such precious pills to treat some chronic diseases!”

“You can absorb the medicinal properties by touching it?” Liu Lifang sneered and said,”since that’s the case, why do you have to give the pill to the old man? Why don’t you just let the old man touch you?”

“Nonsense! Do you know how much medicinal properties you can only absorb through this touching method? I’m telling you, more than 90% of the medicinal properties have been directly lost!” Xia ruofei said,”a precious medicine that could have saved a late – Stage cancer patient was used by you to treat some chronic diseases! This is simply a waste of God’s gift!”

Then, Xia ruofei looked at the pale – faced Liu Lifang and said,””But you should be glad that you only touched the pills. If you were stupid enough to swallow all these pills, I’m afraid you would have already been in the box!”

Then, Xia ruofei looked at Liu Qunfeng and said,””Why did I repeatedly tell you not to touch the pill with your skin? And they even asked you to strictly control the dosage? There was a reason for this. Chief Liu, do you guys understand now?”

Liu Qunfeng nodded awkwardly and said,””I understand! Understood! Mr. Xia, I’ve always attached great importance to your instructions and followed them strictly. This is all Liu Lifang’s stupid mistake!”

Liu Chongli, Liu qunfei, Liu Liru, and the other core members of the Liu family also nodded.

From the verbal exchange between Xia ruofei and Liu Lifang, everyone could see clearly that this matter was caused by this stupid woman, Liu Lifang. Xia ruofei had nothing to do with the deterioration of old master Liu’s condition.

There was only one word to describe Liu Lifang’s actions, and that was Xuxu crying stupidly!

Like a defeated rooster, Liu Lifang stood at the side dejectedly, unable to say a word.

A few days ago, she was still a little complacent and secretly cheered for her own cleverness, even thinking that she had discovered some great secret. And when the old man’s condition began to deteriorate, she was indeed a little worried, but she deceived herself and forced herself not to think that way.

Today, Xia ruofei had easily shattered her fantasy and mercilessly exposed her foolish behavior. At this moment, her heart was in a mess.

Liu Qunfeng glared at Liu Lifang and said,””I’ll settle this with you later! Now ... Immediately return to the old estate and kneel in front of the ancestral hall! You’re not allowed to get up without my permission!”

This was just one of the Liu family’s residences. They had moved here for the convenience of treating old master Liu. The Liu family’s residence was much larger than this one. One of them was a room specially used to place the ancestral tablets. It was called the “ancestral hall” in the Liu family.

As a traditional wealthy family, the Liu family naturally had many rules.

As a woman, Liu Lifang was not allowed to enter the ancestral hall. She had made a grave mistake this time. If anything were to happen to old man Liu, it would be a magnitude 10 earthquake for the Liu family. This earthquake was caused by Liu Lifang.

Liu Qunfeng was furious.

However, it was not the time to look into Liu Lifang. The most important thing now was to ask Xia ruofei to quickly treat old master Liu. No matter what, he had to keep old master Liu alive.

Therefore, Liu Qunfeng asked Liu Lifang to go to the old house first and kneel down in front of the ancestral hall.

“Oh ... I know ...” Liu Lifang did not dare to talk back at all. She lowered her head and said in a low voice.

Liu Qunfeng snorted coldly,”when you get back, you’d better stay on your knees!” If he still dared to play tricks at this time ... Hmph! I’ll let you know the power of the family rules!”

“I don’t dare ...” Liu Lifang lowered her head and said.

The entrance of the small ancestral hall was full of surveillance cameras. She had made such a big mistake. If she still dared to play tricks with such a punishment as kneeling in the ancestral hall, she would really be courting death.

Liu Qunfeng turned his eyes to Liu Kuan, and his expression softened a little. He said,””Uncle Kuan, please send Liu Lifang back to the old mansion. Tell the family that no one is allowed to help Liu Lifang! Just let her kneel! Also ... This was a critical period. Liu Lifang was a good example for anyone who dared to cause trouble during this period of time! Let them consider whether they can bear the punishment of the family rules!”

“Alright,” he said. Liu Kuan said as he bowed slightly.

With Liu Kuan’s “escort,” Liu Lifang went downstairs and took a car back to the Liu family’s old house.

The other core members of the Liu family looked at each other. They did not expect such an explosive thing to happen before they came. Some of them were still in a daze even after Liu Lifang was taken away.

Of course, there were also people who were secretly on alert and told themselves to be careful with their words and actions during this period of time, so as not to bump into the muzzle of a gun and become an unlucky person like Liu Lifang.

After Liu Lifang left, Liu Qunfeng immediately put on a smile and said to Xia ruofei,””Mr. Xia, you know my father’s condition the best. The previous stage of the treatment was also effective. This time ... I’ll have to trouble you again ...”

“Chief Liu,” said Xia ruofei, looking troubled.”Elder Liu’s current condition is much more serious than when I first took over the treatment. To be honest, I’m not very confident ...”

“As long as you do your best, no matter what the result is, we, the Liu family, will be very grateful!” Liu Qunfeng quickly said.

“That’s true, but I’m also in a very difficult position right now!” Xia ruofei frowned slightly and said,”to be honest, this should not have happened! Now, not only did the previous stage of treatment go down the drain, but the condition had also become more troublesome! Most importantly, those pills should have been able to cure elder Liu’s illness, and the medicinal herbs used to make these pills are very precious. Several of them can’t be bought even with money. I’ve gathered them with great difficulty to make this batch of pills, but they were used by a stupid woman to treat chronic rhinitis! Even if I wanted to continue treating elder Liu, it wouldn’t be easy to gather all these herbs! And you all know elder Liu’s physical condition. He can’t wait!”

Liu Qunfeng’s heart sank. He was not worried that Xia ruofei would not be willing to receive treatment. He knew Xia ruofei well. Since he had accepted the treatment, he would not let old man Liu die. What he was worried about was what Xia ruofei had said. Even if he wanted to treat her, he did not have the conditions to do so.

“Mr. Xia,” Liu Qunfeng blurted out.”What herbs do you need? why don’t you make a list? house Liu is quite powerful. If we work together, we might be able to get all the herbs we need.”

After that, Liu Qunfeng quickly explained,””Mr. Xia, please don’t misunderstand. I don’t mean to pry into your prescription. It’s just now ... Isn’t this an urgent matter? If we, the Liu family, were to join in the search for the herbs, we would be of some help! What do you think?”Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎
