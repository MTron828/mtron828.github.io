After Feng Jing left, Xia ruofei thought about the materials again. He couldn’t wait to store them in his interspace and take care of them when he was free.

Refining a spirit puppet was a complicated and vast project. There were some tasks that he couldn’t complete with his current cultivation base, but there was a lot of basic preparation work that could be done in advance, such as the pre – processing of materials and the carving of a large number of basic formations.

A soul puppet was actually a combination of a large number of basic formations to achieve an effect similar to artificial intelligence. Xia ruofei could understand most of the formations, but he did not know how to combine them. He had no idea why those basic formations could achieve such a magical effect after being combined in a special way.

However, Xia ruofei did not need to know the reason. He just had to follow the refining method strictly and complete the preparation step by step.

Thinking of the materials, Xia ruofei was about to call Lei Hu over and ask him to arrange for people to transport the materials to the warehouse as soon as possible.

Just as he swiped his phone screen and was about to call Lei Hu, he heard a knock on the door.

Hence, Xia ruofei placed his phone on the desk and called out,””Come in!”

The office door was pushed open and a group of people walked in. The first one was Lei Hu.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be stunned for a moment. They really have telepathy! I was just about to call you over! You ran over on your own.

However, when he thought about how Lei Hu was a man, the idea of telepathy was a little strange. He could not help but shake his head and throw these messy thoughts to the side.

“Chairman, look who I’ve brought!” Lei Hu said, smiling.

Xia ruofei took a closer look and couldn’t help but smile. He stood up and said,””Old Xu! You guys are here!”

The people who came in with Lei Hu were the Veterans who had helped Xia ruofei deal with Liu haojun’s problem.

Xu Yougang, Zeng Liang, Wang Chong, and Zhang Aijun all went to Xia ruofei’s office.

“Good day, Chairman!” Xu Yougang and the other three said in unison.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”good, good, good!” You guys look good! It seems that the environment in Sanya is really nourishing!”

After Liu haojun’s matter, Xia ruofei gave Xu Yougang and the others a sum of money to go on a long vacation in Sanya. On the one hand, it was to avoid the limelight, and on the other hand, it was naturally to reward them.

“Thanks to you!” Xu Yougang chuckled. It’s been a long time since we’ve had a good rest. The blue sky and blue ocean in Sanya has made us want to go back!”

Xu Yougang and the others were all selected by Lei Hu. The common point was that the four of them had just been recruited at that time and had not even gone through the employment procedures. In addition, their situation after their retirement was not very good. They were financially stretched because of their families or other reasons.

After they helped Xia ruofei with Liu haojun’s matter, Xia ruofei not only provided them with the luxury tour to Sanya, but also gave them a large sum of money each. Naturally, their family’s difficulties were solved.

A man would die for his bosom friend. Xu Yougang and the other three were absolutely loyal to Xia ruofei. After returning from Sanya, Lei Hu had asked them to rest first. After all, Xia ruofei was the one who decided on their arrangements. When they heard that Xia ruofei had finally returned to the three mountains, the four of them, who were bored to death, immediately went to find Lei Hu and reported to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”since you like it there, why don’t you spend more time there?” Do you not have enough money?”

“No, no!” Xu Yougang quickly said,”Chairman, we just did a small thing for you. You gave us so much money and even sent us on a trip. We feel very apologetic. Everyone wants to work for you as soon as possible!”

“It’s good that you’re back!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you guys work hard by my side. If you like Sanya, you can buy a house there and stay there for a while whenever you want to go on vacation!”

“Hehe!” Xu Yougang scratched his head.”The houses there are too expensive. We can’t afford them!”

“Old Xu, if you work for the chairman, you’ll be able to afford a house in the future,” Lei Hu said.

“That’s right, that’s right!” Xu Yougang said with a smile.

“Don’t just stand there, come and sit here!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”if you want to drink water, pour it for yourself! There are drinks in the fridge too, don’t be shy, I don’t have a Secretary here to serve me!”

“Yes, thank you, Chairman!”

Xu Yougang and the others followed Xia ruofei to the reception area and sat down.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,””Old Xu, I’ve thought about your arrangements some time ago. Now, I have two plans. You can choose one.”

Xu Yougang and the other three quickly sat up straight and pricked up their ears to look at Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei said,”first of all, I want to say that no matter what the plan is, it’s best that you don’t go through the formal employment procedures at the Paradise Corporation.”

He did this out of careful consideration. After all, the Liu family was a giant and their power was beyond ordinary people’s imagination. Although Liu haojun’s incident had happened some time ago and according to Xia ruofei’s indirect inquiries, the Liu family did not seem to have found anything, it was better to be safe than sorry. If the Liu family really found any clues, Xu Yougang and the others would all be employed by the Paradise company, which might cause trouble.
