Chapter 1477: Everyone is dumbfounded (1)

Translator: 549690339

Director Jiang and director Wang saw Cao Jin and walked straight to Zhuang Cheng, Yao na, and the others.

They couldn’t help but be shocked. Could it be that these two young cadres of the Tanzhou Finance Bureau were in contact with director Cao?

The two of them recalled their earlier words that were filled with resentment. They couldn’t help but feel a little regretful. In fact, they were all part of the system and were usually harmonious. However, the two of them were really angry at Xia ruofei’s words today. Moreover, Zhuang Cheng and Yao na were young cadres with very low ranks, so they couldn’t help but vent their anger at them.

Director Jiang and director Wang looked at each other and walked toward Zhuang Cheng. On the one hand, they hoped to get closer to Cao Jin, and on the other hand, they hoped to ease their relationship with Zhuang Cheng and his wife.

On the other side, Zhuang Cheng and Yao na had their full attention on Cao Jin, so they naturally noticed that Cao Jin was walking straight towards them.

The two of them couldn’t help but feel a little excited. Could it be that director Cao still remembers us?

The more he thought about it, the more he felt that it was possible. On the eve of the Spring Festival, Cao Jin had accompanied song Zhengping to inspect the Tanzhou City Finance Bureau. At that time, Yao na, who was a member of the Bureau’s Party Committee, had participated in the entire reception work. Zhuang Cheng had also participated in a small meeting.

Yao na even fantasized that Cao Jin had a deep impression of her because of her good looks. She was quite confident in her looks, at least she could be considered a flower in the Tanzhou City Finance Bureau.

Therefore, as Cao Jin got closer and closer, Yao na could not help but reach out to tidy her hair and try to show her most charming smile.

Zhuang Cheng quickly straightened his back and fixed his eyes on Cao Jin as if he was waiting for the highest leader to come and meet him.

Cao Jin was getting closer and closer, and the two of them were getting more and more excited.

There’s no mistake, director Cao is really walking towards me!

When Cao Jin walked over, the two of them naturally showed a humble smile and extended their hands from a distance like director Jiang and bureau chief Wang.

Seeing the smile on Cao Jin’s face, the two were even more excited. Not only did director Cao come to talk to them, but his attitude was also so kind. What a great honor it was!

From the corner of their eyes, they even saw director Jiang and bureau chief Wang walking over. They felt even more elated. A moment ago, they felt like they had lost their parents and their future was bleak, but now, they felt like they had a glimmer of hope.

However, the smile on Zhuang Cheng and Yao NA’s faces froze as soon as Cao Jin opened his mouth.

“Mr. Xia!” Cao Jin greeted him with respect.

Mr ... Mr. Xia? Zhuang Cheng’s and Yao NA’s hearts skipped a beat. At this moment, Cao Jin had already walked past them, completely treating them as if they were thin air.

The two of them turned their heads with great difficulty and saw a scene that they would never forget for the rest of their lives.

Cao Jin came in front of Xia ruofei and Song Wei and bowed slightly to them. His posture was quite low!

Then, they saw a faint smile on Xia ruofei’s face. He said gently,””Hello, Secretary Cao!”

Secretary Cao? He actually called Cao Jin Secretary Cao? Although everyone knew that Cao Jin was indeed a Secretary, how could a Secretary be the same? He was the Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee and also the Deputy Director of the Provincial Party Committee.

It was a customary practice in the system to call him “director Cao.” Even the leaders of the Provincial Party Committee, unless they were particularly senior, would call him “little Cao.” Most of the others would also call him “director Cao.” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

If he was called “Secretary Cao,” although Cao Jin might not bear a grudge, he would definitely feel uncomfortable.

However, Zhuang Cheng and Yao na were not displeased at all when they saw Cao Jin. Instead, they were even more respectful.

“Mr. Xia,” Cao Jin said with a smile,”I just finished working overtime and wanted to visit you. I also wanted to know what kind of service you would like during your stay in Tanzhou.”

After hearing this, Zhuang Cheng, Yao na, director Jiang, and director Wang all almost fell.

Secretary Cao had actually come to visit and had even lowered himself so much! What was this young man doing?

Bureau chief Wang and chief Jiang’s faces turned pale. Thinking of their attitude towards Xia ruofei just now, they felt a chill from the bottom of their hearts.

Zhuang Cheng and Yao na were even more dumbfounded, their minds almost blank.

Director Jiang also remembered that Yao na had casually introduced them as Xu Shuyuan’s College classmates and said that they were from the countryside.

It was because of this preconceived concept that they felt so superior in front of Xia ruofei. They spoke so arrogantly, but they did not know if they had offended such a Big Shot.

At that thought, director Jiang’s gaze toward Zhuang Cheng and Yao na turned cold.

“These two people killed me today ...” Director Jiang secretly gritted his teeth.

Xia ruofei did not care about Zhuang Cheng’s reaction. He smiled and said,””You’re too kind, Secretary Cao! We’re just here to take a look around. You’re so busy with work, you don’t have to come here!”

“It’s my duty,” Cao Jin said humbly.”You’re welcome, Mr. Xia!”

“Secretary Cao, would you like to come with us to our room?” Xia ruofei said.
