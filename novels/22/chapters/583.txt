Chapter 584: President Feng can handle two people by himself_1

The two pomfrets were about the same size, about 30 centimeters in length. Their scales were sago – colored, their back and head were grayish – Black, and the upper side had a little bluish – Green luster. The lower side and abdomen were silver – White, and their abdominal and gluteus fins were grayish – White. The edge of their caudal fin and the base of their dorsal fin were light black.

Xia ruofei looked at the two fish and couldn’t tell which was the male and which was the female.

However, since Ling Xiaotian had said that they were a pair, it should not be a mistake. After all, he had asked the experienced head chef of Ling Ji to appraise them. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Even if the two stingers could not be paired, Xia ruofei would not lose anything. They could grow a lot in the medium.

Xia ruofei’s movements were very gentle. The two rays did not notice that the lid on their heads had been opened. They were still swimming leisurely in the warm water tank.

The spirit Qi in the spirit map space was extremely rich, and the two rays seemed to be enjoying themselves.

Xia ruofei carefully used the invisible spatial force to wrap the two rays and the water around them. Then, with a thought, the rays slowly rose from the heated water tank.

The Stingray had been swimming non – stop all its life, and they did not notice anything wrong at this time. They were still swimming slowly in a limited range.

A large ball of transparent water was wrapped in an invisible force and suspended in mid – Air. There were two rays swimming slowly in the water. This scene was quite strange.

Xia ruofei’s control of the spatial force was already at ease. With a thought, the ball of water wrapped around the Ray fish and slowly floated to the small fish pond. Then, it slowly descended and finally entered the fish pond.

Xia ruofei slowly removed the invisible spatial force and the Ray fish immediately swam happily in the small fish pond.

With their intelligence, they were naturally unable to detect anything wrong. However, their range of activity had suddenly increased a lot, so they were very happy and swam much faster.

......

Xia ruofei then slowly poured the remaining water in the heated water tank into the small fish pond. It was inevitable that there were still some spirit Heart Flower petals here, and Xia ruofei did not have the habit of wasting them.

The small fish pond in this space had already formed a small and stable ecosystem. There were plankton, organic matter, and so on in the pond. After the rays settled in the fish pond, Xia ruofei did not have to worry about feeding them.

He then took out a small porcelain bottle that contained the spirit Heart Flower petal solution and poured half a petal of the solution into the small fish pond. He observed the state of the pomfrets from a distance and then left the spirit map space with a peace of mind.

It was a quiet night.

The next day, after Xia ruofei woke up, he contacted President Lin of Qiantang Tongren Hall and found out that President Lin’s flight would arrive at Sanshan at around three in the afternoon.

After Xia ruofei asked for the flight number, he gave Lei Hu a call and asked him to drive the company’s Mercedes – Benz to pick Xia ruofei up in the afternoon. When he was going to Jiangsu and Zhejiang Province, President Lin was very warm to him. This time, he came to San Shan to discuss business with Tao Yuan company, so he naturally could not be impolite.

The company didn’t have a full – time driver. When they needed a car, they would look for a few veterans in the security Department.

After the last recruitment, the security Department had a surplus of people. Besides, these veterans who had obtained a military driving license were all very skilled. Xia ruofei would be more at ease if they were the drivers.

Especially Lei Hu and the others, who had undergone special driving training in the Special Forces. Even if there were any emergencies on the road, they could calmly deal with it. They were much better than ordinary local drivers.

Xia ruofei gave it some thought and gave pang Hao a call. He asked him to get someone to prepare a guest room in the mixed – use complex in case of emergency.

The company didn’t have a specialized logistics department at the moment. In addition, the chief executive hadn’t arrived yet, so some service and security work was temporarily in the charge of pang Hao.

However, as the Chief Financial Officer, he was no longer a mere commander. Among the last recruitment, two of them were prepared to work for the finance department, so pang Hao only needed to give orders for general matters.

In the morning, Xia ruofei sat in his office for a while and discussed the details of the negotiation with Feng Jing. At 11 am, he left the office and drove straight to the city.

He had already called Ling Qingxue in the morning to make an appointment. The two of them had not seen each other for a long time, so they were going to have lunch together in the city.

Xia ruofei drove to the headquarters of the lingji F & B building. Not long after, he saw Ling Qingxue, who had obviously dressed up on purpose, walking out of the building with light steps.

The Knight XV SUV was very eye – catching. Ling Qingxue looked left and right and immediately found her target. Her face revealed a happy expression as she walked quickly towards Xia ruofei.

After Ling Qingxue got into the car, Xia ruofei passed Ling Qingxue a necklace that he had bought at the Qiantang. He smiled and said,””Wife, this is for you!”

The necklace was from Cartier and cost about 16000 Yuan. Although it was not very expensive, Ling Qingxue would be very happy as long as it was a gift from Xia ruofei.

Her eyes revealed a hint of surprise as she said,””Why did you suddenly give me a present?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I saw it when I was shopping at Qiantang this time. I thought it would suit you, so I bought it.” Wife, quickly put it on and let me see!”

Ling Qingxue nodded happily, then pouted and said,””You help me put it on!”
