There were too many gimmicks for today’s auction, and the points written were very rich. It was estimated that once the auction ended, many reporters would have finished their special articles.

“Alright!” Lu zhongguang immediately replied. Mr. Li from Chang Jiang group has bid 5 million! Are there any higher bids?”

When Lu zhongguang spoke, his eyes were directly on he Xinyi.

Because in the end, it was only he Xinyi and Li Kai who were competing. Some of the others did not have the financial resources, and some did not want to offend these two famous rich second generation, so they all withdrew from the competition early on.

The gambling king’s daughter had the style of her father. She shrugged her shoulders and said,””I give up!”

“The current price is 5 million Hong Kong dollars! Is there anyone else who wants to bid?” Lu zhongguang asked.

” 5 million going once!”

” 5 million going twice!”

” 5 million going thrice! Deal!”

With a ‘Dong’, the auction gavel fell and the first Finale, the abalone, was taken by Li Kai at a price of 5 million Hong Kong dollars.

Lu zhongguang did not deliberately delay the time when he was counting down. The interval between the three counts was not very long, and then he simply dropped the gavel.

The hall was filled with warm applause. Li Kai also stood up and bowed slightly in a few directions, his face revealing a trace of joy.

This time, he didn’t come in vain!

He Xinyi also smiled at Li Kai, looking very gentlemanly.

Lu zhongguang had a good grasp of the auction’s rhythm. After the applause gradually died down, he immediately began the auction of the second finale abalone. This abalone weighed 640.3 grams, which was a little heavier than the abalone that was sold for 5 million.

What price would the abalone be sold for? Everyone was filled with anticipation.

The starting price was still three million Hong Kong dollars.

As soon as the auction started, the rich people in the VIP area started to bid.

This time, he Xinyi still participated in the bidding. However, after Li Kai got the one – headed abalone as he wished, he didn’t have any intention of bidding again. Just now, he didn’t give in at all. At least, he had bid before he Xinyi. If he came out again this time, he wouldn’t be giving them any face. Basically, he would have to shed all pretenses of cordiality.

These rich young masters and young mistresses all had high emotional intelligence. Li Kai would not do something like this that would offend people for no reason.

Zheng zhilun was a little embarrassed. He had already said that he would give it to he Xinyi, but he did not expect that he Xinyi would not be able to snatch Li Kai’s prize. Moreover, she immediately participated in the bidding in the second round.

Since he had already said it, Zheng zhilun was too embarrassed to fight with he Xinyi again. So, he did not even bid symbolically and just sat in his seat, feeling depressed.

Of course, without Li Kai and Zheng zhilun, the competition was not low at all.

Because there were many rich people in the VIP area, most of them hadn’t bought the top – Quality abalones yet. Seeing that there were only two left, they also started to bid.

Therefore, the price of the abalone also soared and soon reached 4.8 million Hong Kong dollars.

After a few rounds of bidding, the price easily exceeded 5 million Hong Kong dollars.

In the end, it was he Xinyi who won the bid for the abalone with an auspicious number of 5.2 million. Although she had said that her ideal price in the previous round was 4.8 million, this abalone was a little heavier than the previous one. It had even exceeded 640 grams. In addition, the competition had become much fiercer.

As such, he Xinyi had also raised the price in her heart slightly, and in the end, she had also successfully bought the abalone.

In the blink of an eye, Xia ruofei had earned another 10.2 million Hong Kong dollars. The total transaction price today had also exceeded 80 million Hong Kong dollars.

At this moment, there was only one super large abalone left on the stage. It weighed 653.2 grams, much higher than the previous items. It could be said to be the well – deserved “King of abalones.”

What would the price of this abalone be? Everyone turned their attention to the only tray on the stage that was still covered with red silk.
