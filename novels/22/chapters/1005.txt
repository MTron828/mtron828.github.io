Translator: 549690339

Zhuo Yiyi pointed at Song Wei as if she had just discovered a new continent and shouted,””Wei Wei, you’re shy! And you say there’s no situation?”

“You ...”

“Don’t use your girlfriend as an excuse! There’s still divorce after marriage!” Zhuo Yiyi immediately swallowed back Song Wei’s words.

“Do I make sense, uncle?” he turned to song Rui and asked.

Song Rui looked at Zhuo Yiyi helplessly, not knowing what to say.

Zhuo Yiyi even asked innocently,””Uncle, why didn’t you say anything on the way here?”

“You’ve already said what you wanted to say, what else can I say?” Song Rui said helplessly.

Xia ruofei could not help but smile bitterly at Zhuo Yiyi.””Student Zhuo Yiyi, please don’t treat me like I don’t exist, alright? My girlfriend and Song Wei know each other too. We even had a meal together two days ago ...”

“Shall we have dinner together?” Shocked, Zhuo Yiyi asked,”Weiwei, you left me behind the other day and told me that you had an important date with brother ruofei and his girlfriend?”

Song Wei nodded her head helplessly. Just as she was about to explain that it was her family who had invited Xia ruofei to dinner, Zhuo Yiyi beat her to it and said,”Brother ruofei, you’re so capable! To be able to let the flower and wildflower live in peace, this little girl worships ...”

Song Wei’s pretty face suddenly burned with passion and she said loudly,”Hey! Who are you calling wildflowers!”

“Could it be that you’re the family’s flower?” Zhuo Yiyi laughed evilly.

“I ...”

Song Wei realized that no matter how she tried to explain, it would only make things worse. That was because Zhuo Yiyi did not listen to any explanation at all. Everything was just her own imagination.

Xia ruofei was also speechless. He had no energy to complain, so he just closed his mouth and focused on driving.

Zhuo Yiyi saw that the two people in the front row were ignoring her and felt a little bored. After a while, she turned to song Rui and asked,””Uncle, you’re so familiar with both of them, and you’re also Weiwei’s uncle. Do you really have the heart to see Weiwei jump into the fire pit?”

Song Rui turned around and said seriously,””Zhuo Yiyi, didn’t song Wei just say it? He doesn’t have that kind of relationship with RUO Fei. Did you not hear clearly?”

Zhuo Yiyi was stunned for a moment before she replied,”I heard it!” But Wei Wei, she ...”

“I thought there was something wrong with your ears. I was going to introduce you to a doctor from the Department of ear, nose, and throat!” Song Rui said,”it doesn’t seem like it’s a problem with my ears! You should go and take a look at this place ...”

Song Rui said as he poked his head with his index finger.

Zhuo Yiyi was slightly taken aback, but she quickly recovered and said angrily,””Stinky uncle, you dare say that there’s something wrong with my brain? You’re the one with a problem! There’s something wrong with your entire family’s brains! No! There’s something wrong with the brain of your entire community ...”

“Okay, okay, okay. A good man doesn’t fight with a woman. I said the wrong thing, okay?” Song Rui quickly dodged to the side, afraid that Zhuo Yiyi’s finger would poke his eyes.

As Xia ruofei drove, he looked at the two people in the back through the rearview mirror. He could not help but smile. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Meanwhile, Song Wei glanced at Xia ruofei and looked thoughtful.

In fact, Zhuo Yiyi was just speaking without thinking. However, her personality was not annoying. She was cheerful, innocent, and full of youth, so Xia ruofei and Song Wei were not really angry. They just felt a little embarrassed after being teased by Zhuo Yiyi.

Song Wei’s heart was rippling. She would look at Xia ruofei awkwardly from time to time.

However, with the happy – go – Lucky Zhuo Yiyi around, the atmosphere would not become too awkward no matter what.

When she saw that the two in the front row ignored him and started talking to song Rui, her curious nature was revealed. She asked all kinds of questions such as “what’s your real age” and “do you have a girlfriend”, which song Rui couldn’t handle.

“Uncle,” Zhuo Yiyi asked again,”you’re Weiwei’s uncle. Don’t tell me your family is also in politics?”

Song Rui nodded seriously and said,””Yes, some of my elders work in the party Committee and government departments.”

“Are you really the second generation of an official?” Zhuo Yiyi’s curiosity was piqued.”Then tell me, what kind of officials do you have in your family?”

Song Rui counted with his fingers and said,””The biggest one ... Should be at the national level, right? In addition, there are four or five at the provincial level, and I have to count the Bureau level ...”

“Puchi!” Zhuo Yiyi couldn’t help but laugh and say,”uncle, I thought you were very honest! So you’re a pervert! You don’t even make a sound when you tell jokes ...”

“I’m serious, I’m not joking!” Song Rui said.

“Alright, alright, you’re not joking.” Zhuo Yiyi said with a helpless expression,”you’re the top nouveau riche in China, and your family is a political tycoon, okay? Why don’t you just say that your grandfather is elder song!”

“How did you know?” song Rui asked in surprise. My grandfather is really ...”

“Alright, alright! Are you done joking?” Zhuo Yiyi burst out laughing.”Elder song? If your grandfather is elder song, then my grandfather is the referee!”

The first senior official of this term was surnamed Luo.

Seeing Zhuo Yiyi’s disbelieving look, song Rui couldn’t help but smile bitterly.

It’s not easy for me to tell the truth, can you not be so harsh?

In the past, when song Rui went to all kinds of top clubs in the capital, his bad friends would bring celebrities and socialites to socialize. All kinds of women were naturally very interested in this ‘young master Song’ that even the rich Playboys respected. They would often try to make indirect inquiries, but song Rui would not easily reveal his family background.

Their circle was like this. If you were qualified to enter this circle, you would naturally know the other party’s identity. Otherwise, they would not even bother to show off in front of you.

Today, when Zhuo Yiyi took the initiative to talk about this topic, song Rui didn’t beat around the bush and told her the truth. However, she didn’t expect Zhuo Yiyi to not believe him at all.

Xia ruofei and Song Wei looked at each other and couldn’t help but laugh.

The two of them didn’t expose him. Anyway, it was quite interesting to see song Rui’s defeated look.

The car came down from the Second Ring Road and drove out of the city for a short while. Then, it went through the ramp and onto the highway.

The car drove all the way to Changping County. Xia ruofei was more familiar with this area. He thought about it and felt that it was not a wise choice to go to the beach during the hottest time of the afternoon in the hot summer.

After a moment of silence, Xia ruofei drove to a water park by the sea in Changping County.

Song Wei and the other two agreed with Xia ruofei’s arrangement, especially the playful Zhuo Yiyi. Without a second word, she pulled Song Wei and rushed in.

Xia ruofei took the initiative to go and buy the tickets. Then, everyone bought a swimsuit at the service desk. Actually, Xia ruofei always had swimming trunks in his interspace. After all, the interspace had the sea that Xia ruofei could enjoy alone. He would go in for a swim occasionally.

However, it did not make sense to keep swimming trunks in the car all year round, so Xia ruofei bought a new one with Song Wei and the others.

After changing their clothes in the men’s and women’s changing rooms, everyone gathered at the water park.

There were many things to do in the water park. There were time travel slides, skateboarding surfing, trumpets, and so on. The child – like Zhuo Yiyi felt as if she had arrived in heaven. She couldn’t wait to try out all kinds of things. Xia ruofei, Song Wei, and song Rui were also dragged by her to run around the venue. The entire venue could hear Zhuo Yiyi’s laughter.

In the end, Zhuo Yiyi was interested in the water park’s special feature, the obstacle course.

This kind of Breakthrough Program had been very popular in the past few years because several satellite TV stations would do this kind of program every summer, and the stages were all similar.

The tickets they bought for the water park included a break through, but they had to exchange for tickets when they arrived. Each ticket could be used twice.

When the four of them arrived at the entrance of the checkpoint, Zhuo Yiyi immediately said excitedly,””Wei Wei, brother ruofei, uncle, let’s have a match!”
