Chapter 1721: Huaxia’s whirlwind (1)

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.”Big brother Tang, don’t blindly join in the fun! I don’t know how to act! Besides, I’m not interested in it!”

Tang Yitian smiled and said,”this is a good opportunity to be famous!” Just think about it! After this incident, you’ll be a well – known hero in Australia. If you act in a movie adapted from this real event, it’ll be a great story!”

Without waiting for Xia ruofei to speak, Tang Yitian continued,””Acting is actually very simple! Jennifer can teach you! I’ll get my management company to organize a sped up training for you ...”

“Stop! Stop!” Xia ruofei quickly said,”big brother Tang, I’m not interested at all. Please don’t mention this again!”

Tang Yitian was still a little regretful. He muttered,””What a great opportunity! Why aren’t you willing to ...”

Tony could not understand their Chinese and was still thinking about the feasibility of adapting the movie. What he did not know was that it was basically impossible to get Xia ruofei to be the lead. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

However, no matter what, it was still very good to adapt this story into a movie. The theme itself was very attractive, and it was also an adaptation of a real event, so it naturally attracted the audience.

It was already noon when the press conference ended. Hence, qiuhang naturally arranged a sumptuous luncheon to entertain Xia ruofei and the rest.

In addition to Tony and several other executives of Quto, the flight’s chief flight attendant Guli and the air traffic police also attended the lunch banquet.

The luncheon was held in a hotel near the area of the Australian Airlines headquarters. Tony and the other Australian Airlines executives were very enthusiastic about Xia ruofei and the others. Everyone toasted and the atmosphere of the luncheon was very harmonious.

After the meal, Tony personally sent Xia ruofei to the car.

As for the details such as the bonus, the staff would naturally contact Xia ruofei in a few days. There was no need for a Senior Manager like Tony to personally ask.

When Xia ruofei attended the press conference, Jennifer brought Tang Haoran to accompany Feng Jing on her tour of Sydney. When Xia ruofei and the others returned to the manor, Feng Jing and the other two were not back yet.

As for Xu Ziyuan, he had already left this morning and returned to his home in Xi Teni. He stayed at Tang Yitian’s house to accompany Li Yifu, but now it seemed that Li Yifu was going to stay for a long time, so Xu Ziyuan naturally couldn’t stay with him.

Xia ruofei had nothing to do in the afternoon, so he gave Li Yifu some pointers on his cultivation.

Li Yifu’s Guiyuan Scripture originated from Guiyuan true Scripture, which was a technique recorded in the human – shaped jade talisman. It was equivalent to being directly passed down into Xia ruofei’s mind. Although he did not practice it, he had a thorough understanding of this technique, so it was more than enough to guide Li Yifu.

Moreover, Li Yifu’s cultivation technique was incomplete, but Xia ruofei had the complete cultivation technique in his mind. Hence, Li Yifu felt that he had obtained a treasure by casually correcting and giving him advice.

Li Yifu followed Xia ruofei’s instructions and tried it out. He immediately felt that the circulation of his genuine Qi seemed to be much smoother. He was naturally ecstatic and grateful to Xia ruofei.

After a few days of interaction, Xia ruofei could feel that Li Yifu respected him from the bottom of his heart. Even though he was only a young man in his twenties, Li Yifu still treated him as an elder from the bottom of his heart.

Besides, Xia ruofei had a good impression of Li Yifu. He didn’t seem like a bad person. Hence, he passed on the content of the Guiyuan Scripture to Li Yifu through this kind of guidance.

Of course, Xia ruofei didn’t teach Li Yifu the entire technique. Through this kind of intentional or unintentional guidance, even Li Yifu himself didn’t notice it. He only felt that his cultivation was more smooth and harmonious according to Xia ruofei’s guidance.

After Xia ruofei gave a few pointers, he thought for a while and said,””Foster husband, I seem to remember seeing the origin returning Scripture before ...”

Li Yifu could not help but tremble when he heard this. He looked at Xia ruofei with anticipation but did not dare to say anything.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you don’t have to be nervous. When I go back this time, I’ll look for it among the relics of my master. If I can find the Guiyuan Scripture, I’ll definitely teach it to you. After all, you’ve been practicing this technique for three generations ...”

Li Yifu said with tears in his eyes,”senior granduncle, I don’t dare to expect to be able to practice the real Guiyuan Scripture. After all, I’m already old and weak. There’s no hope for me to practice it anymore. But if I can see the Guiyuan Scripture once in my lifetime, I’ll be able to hold my head high when I see my father and Grandmaster in the underworld ...”

Xia ruofei frowned and said,”although you’ve wasted too much time before, it doesn’t mean that there’s no hope. Didn’t your father live for more than 120 years?” If you break through to Qi disciple Level 6 before you turn 100 years old, then you still have a chance to go further! If you successfully reach the Foundation Stage, your lifespan will increase even more, so how can you be discouraged?”

Li Yifu was not even 90 years old yet. In Xia ruofei’s opinion, it was easy to break through to the second level of cultivation in a dozen years.

Li Yifu smiled bitterly.”Senior granduncle, I’m not very talented. It’s already a blessing for me to be able to break through to Qi disciple Level 4. Qi disciple Level 6 ... I don’t dare to hope for it ...”
