Xia ruofei smiled and said,”no problem. It’s our duty to cooperate with your investigation.” CEO Feng was the one who followed up on this matter from the beginning to the end. If you need any cooperation, just contact CEO Feng directly!”

“Alright, thank you, Mr. Xia!” Deputy Director Xu said politely.

He was just a man of principle, but his EQ was not low. The man in front of him had such a good relationship with young master Liu, and it was obvious that the SASAC was in the wrong this time, so he naturally lowered his attitude.

After Feng Jing heard Xia ruofei’s words, she immediately took out a business card and handed it to Deputy Director Xu.””Leader, if you need to cooperate with the investigation, just give me a call!”

“Thank you, director Feng!” Deputy Director Xu said with a smile. Then, he handed Feng Jing a business card.

Then, Deputy Director Xu glared at Section Chief li and said in a deep voice,””Li Chenggong, on behalf of the discipline Inspection team, I officially inform you that from now on, your movements will be restricted and you will be under investigation! Come with us!”

After that, Deputy Director Xu gestured to the two subordinates next to him. The two of them immediately understood and walked forward, ready to lift li Chenggong up.

Xia ruofei’s heart skipped a beat and he said,””Please wait a moment!”

Xia ruofei walked to li Chenggong and reached out to his shoulder. He grabbed his arm and gently pulled and pushed it away. Li Chenggong could not help but scream in shock.

Deputy Director Xu could not help but frown. They had officially taken over the investigation of this matter, but Xia ruofei still lectured li Chenggong in front of them. This made him a little unhappy.

However, for Liu Zhe’s sake, Deputy Director Xu didn’t say anything.

After li Chenggong shouted, he was stunned again. He suddenly felt that the pain had disappeared.

Li Chenggong tried to move his arm in surprise and found that it had completely recovered. There was no pain at all, as if the dislocation of his shoulder joint was just a dream.

Li Chenggong’s respect for Xia ruofei deepened. In his opinion, this method was simply unpredictable!

Deputy Director Xu saw li Chenggong’s expression and realized that Xia ruofei was not teaching li Chenggong a lesson. He was just trying to fix his dislocated shoulder joint.

Deputy Director Xu knew that he had misunderstood Xia ruofei just now. He was secretly glad that he did not lose his temper just now. If he had criticized Xia ruofei just now, it would have been awkward.

Xia ruofei smiled and pulled li Chenggong up. He patted his back and said,””Section Chief Li, I hope that you will accept the organization’s investigation and honestly confess your problems. Don’t take any chances!”

Li Chenggong did not dare to meet Xia ruofei’s eyes. He lowered his head and said,””Yes! I don’t dare, I don’t dare ...” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

He didn’t know that Xia ruofei’s two gentle slaps had already been done without anyone knowing.

Xia ruofei knew that li Chenggong’s career was over, and he might be transferred to the law and put behind bars. However, he felt that this was not enough.

This was because li Chenggong actually dared to have designs on Feng Jing. If they let him off so easily, wouldn’t that be letting him off too lightly?

Therefore, Xia ruofei’s two Patts were actually imbued with pure energy. Although li Chenggong did not feel any discomfort at all, the pure energy would quietly erode some of his meridians in the future.

Li Chenggong’s body would become weaker and weaker as a result, and most importantly, he would no longer be able to do anything with men and women. In the end, even if a beautiful woman were to strip naked in front of him, he would be powerless.

In Xia ruofei’s opinion, this punishment was appropriate. Li Chenggong had asked for it.

Xia ruofei smiled at Deputy Director Xu’s two subordinates, indicating that they could take the man away.

The group left Room 503. Li Chenggong was still in his pajamas, and two officers were holding him on both sides.

Xia ruofei and the rest followed behind the three of them.

Liu Zhe whispered into Xia ruofei’s ear,””Brother Xia, why didn’t you tell me that your company was going to the state – owned assets Supervision and Administration Commission? You’re looking down on your brother!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”it was originally a very simple matter. Who would have thought that it would be so complicated?” I just don’t want to be special. It’s best if things can be done through normal procedures ...”

Liu Zhe shook his head and said with a smile,””I didn’t know brother Xia was such an idealist ...”

“After all, black sheep are only a minority.” Xia ruofei said indifferently,”we don’t want to take advantage of the public either. We do business in an open and aboveboard manner. Using real money to buy these properties isn’t idealistic, right?”

Xia ruofei then said to Liu Zhe,””By the way, you’re not allowed to inform anyone about the acquisition! We’ll just quote the price and buy it normally. We don’t want to mix anything else into this simple business. ”

“Understood!” Liu Zhe said,”but if someone else is blind enough to try and make things difficult for you, you have to tell me immediately!”

“That’s for sure!” Xia ruofei patted Liu Zhe’s shoulder and said,”thank you for today!”

“Aren’t you treating me as an outsider?” Liu Zhe said,”brother Xia, it’s not like I don’t know your connections. It’s my honor to be able to help you with something!”
