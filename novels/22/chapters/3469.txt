Chapter 3470: The real big gift bag_2

Next, Xia ruofei’s attention was naturally on the only storage ring that he could check.

Xia ruofei first familiarly recognized the storage ring as its owner, then he used a trace of his spiritual power to check the rewards inside.

The storage ring’s internal space was extremely large, almost the size of a football field. It was also over a hundred meters tall. It could be said that the value of the storage ring itself was already very high.

However, Xia ruofei’s standards were much higher now. He could also vaguely feel that the storage ring was precious only because of the deterioration of the cultivation environment on earth and the end of the inheritance. The rarer something was, the more precious it was. In the era before the disappearance of high – Level cultivators, including the ancient cultivation world thousands of years ago, storage rings were not rare, especially to the Almighty cultivators.

Hence, when Xia ruofei saw the huge space in the storage ring, he was not particularly surprised or surprised. He was more concerned about what was inside.

After all, no one had been able to reach the top for such a long time. This trial Pagoda mission could be said to be of hell difficulty. Now that he had successfully cleared it, the rewards should be very generous.

Xia ruofei’s spiritual force entered the storage ring and found a pile of purple crystals. There were so many of them that they almost formed a small mountain.

This purple crystal looked a bit like origin crystals, but its energy was much purer. The difference between them was even greater than the difference between origin crystals and spirit crystals.

If this kind of purple crystal was compared to origin crystals, then a real origin crystal was more or less equivalent to an ordinary spirit stone. The difference in the purity of the energy was just that big.

Xia ruofei checked and couldn’t help but be speechless.

With such a high energy purity and such a large amount, the reward could not be said to not be generous.

Xia ruofei really wanted to try and see if these purple crystals could be directly absorbed for cultivation. However, other than the purple crystals that were piled up like a small mountain, there were two other items placed beside the small mountain of purple crystals. They looked a little out of place.

One of them looked like a piece of clothing, and the other was an exquisite Jade bottle. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

With a thought, Xia ruofei took out the two items and a purple crystal.

He first put the purple crystal and the Jade bottle to the side, then reached out to pick up the clothes.

It was a top, and it was not in the style of an ancient robe. It looked more like modern thermal underwear.

He didn’t know what material the clothes were made of, but it was very soft and light to the touch. There was a slight warmth in his hand. In addition, there seemed to be very fine golden threads buried in the clothes. From a distance, the clothes had a faint golden light.

Xia ruofei casually touched it and realized that it was very elastic. When it was unfolded, it could be squeezed into a small ball, almost the size of a baby’s fist.

Xia ruofei opened the clothes curiously and looked at it again. He did not know what kind of treasure it was, but it must be a very precious treasure since it could be placed in the storage ring.

He thought for a moment and tried to use his spiritual power to investigate.

Unexpectedly, as soon as Xia ruofei’s spiritual power touched the surface of the clothes, a stream of information immediately flowed into his mind …

In the hidden space enshrouded in purple mist, Taoist master Qing Xuan was smiling at immortal mountain river,””Brother mountain river, you even took out the Golden armor to give to this kid! You’re really willing to part with it!”

In fact, the robe in Xia ruofei’s hand, which was the gilded soft armor Kasaya and the other small Jade bottle, were put in by Daoist Qing Xuan at the last minute. There was only a small mountain of purple crystals in the storage ring. Inside the small Jade bottle was the nascent formation pill, which Daoist priest Qing Xuan had lost to immortal mountain river in a bet.

Although the immortal mountain river’s guess was not accurate, he guessed that it was 480 steps, and Xia ruofei actually persevered to the end and finished 518 steps. However, compared to Daoist priest Qing Xuan’s answer, the immortal mountain river’s answer was obviously closer, so he still won.

This nascent formation pill was specially requested by perfected mountain river for Xia ruofei. Therefore, Daoist Qing Xuan naturally put it into the reward storage ring.

Just as Qing Xuan took out the nascent formation pill, immortal mountain river suddenly took out the Golden armor and asked Qing Xuan to put it in his storage ring.

In fact, Qing Xuan Taoist had already tried to persuade him when immortal Shan He took out the Golden armor. Now that he saw Xia ruofei take out the Golden armor from his ring, he could not help but sigh.

This was because the gilded soft armor was a very precious magic weapon. It had a very high level of defense and could even block part of the attacks of primordial soul realm cultivators. Even attacks from cultivators of higher levels would find it difficult to destroy this soft armor. Therefore, it was still a magic weapon used by immortal mountain river.

Immortal mountain river was usually in a dangerous place, so this gilded soft armor could be said to be a very important magic weapon. It could really save his life at a critical moment.

Now that he took it out and gave it to Xia ruofei without any hesitation, Qing Xuan Taoist priest, who was his old friend for many years, could not help but try to persuade him. After all, Qing Xuan Taoist priest was also worried that without this soft armor, immortal Shanhe’s safety would be less guaranteed when he was transferred back.

However, Daoist priest qingxuan could not persuade him otherwise. He reluctantly helped to put the Golden armor into the storage ring.

Immortal mountain river laughed and said,”the gilded soft armor is of little value to me. When I encounter opponents at the primordial soul Stage or lower, I don’t need the protection of the soft armor at all. If I encounter opponents at the same cultivation level as me or even higher than me, the protection of the soft armor is very limited. It’s better than nothing. There’s actually no difference whether I have it or not.” But if you give it to me, this disciple, I can save his life at a critical moment!”

After saying that, immortal mountain river looked at Qing Xuan and said seriously,””Daoist Qing Xuan, you and I have seen RUO Fei’s performance. He is very important to our world of cultivation. He may become the one who will decide everyone’s fate in the end! We have the responsibility to do our best to ensure that his growth process is safe and smooth. If there are any accidents during this process, the cultivation world will really be doomed …”

Daoist priest Qing Xuan also looked serious and said,””Brother mountain river is right! I believe that with this gilded soft armor, this child should be able to grow up smoothly!”

Immortal mountain river nodded and said,””I just hope that he can grow as fast as possible! We really don’t know how much longer we can hold on …”

Daoist Qing Xuan hesitated for a moment and finally asked,””Brother mountain river, if that’s the case, why don’t you show yourself and meet him? Tell him clearly about the situation we’re facing now. I think he’ll have a sense of urgency, so he’ll probably work harder in his cultivation and his growth will speed up!”

“You can *t!” Immortal mountain river said seriously. Before he broke through to the immortal soul Stage, he was not to be told anything! Knowing everything too early would only do him more harm than good! Even though I know that this child’s will is firm, we really can’t take the risk. If his Dao heart is affected, it’ll be too late for us to regret!”

Qing Xuan nodded silently, showing that he agreed with immortal mountain river’s opinion. However, he did not say anything more.

On the other hand, immortal mountain river looked at Xia ruofei in the bronze mirror and muttered to himself,””RUO Fei, I will grit my teeth and persevere. The day you break through to the immortal soul Stage will be the day we meet again! A hundred years is just a blink of an eye …”

On the ninth floor of the trial Pagoda, Xia ruofei did not know that the Golden armor was a precious magical treasure that Daoist master mountain river was using. After receiving the information left on the armor and knowing its function and defense level, he was overjoyed. He even felt like he was dreaming
