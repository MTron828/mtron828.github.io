3103 Imparting a new cultivation technique (1)

The two of them took the black flying boat and quickly returned to the three mountains.

Xia ruofei controlled the flying boat and landed on the balcony of the jiangbin villa. Then, he entered the house with Song Wei.

Once Song Wei reached Xia ruofei’s house, she immediately took out her phone and called Ling Qingxue.

Ling Qingxue was still at work, but she picked up Song Wei’s call very quickly.

Song Wei put the phone on speaker and asked with a smile,””Qingxue, are you busy?”

“It’s alright. I’m not particularly busy. ” Ling Qingxue said,”but I’m definitely not as free as you, a student! Wei Wei, you’re calling me all of a sudden, is there something wrong?”

Song Wei looked at Xia ruofei and smiled.”If you’re not particularly busy, I suggest you go home now. Someone seems to miss you a lot!”

When Ling Qingxue heard this, she was stunned for a moment. Then, she asked in surprise,””You’re with RUO Fei? You’ve returned to the three mountains?”

“You’re pretty smart!” “Ling Qingxue, you should be free now, right?” Song Wei asked with a smile.

Seeing this, Xia ruofei also laughed and said loudly,””Qingxue, go home after you’ve settled your matters! I’m looking for you!”

“MMH! You guys wait for me at home, I’ll be right back!” Ling Qingxue asked,”Oh right, it’s the jiangbin villa district, right?”

“Yes! Do you want me to go and pick you up?” Xia ruofei asked.

“No need, there won’t be a traffic jam at this hour. I’ll drive back quickly!” Ling Qingxue said,”you should stay at home and accompany Weiwei first! I’ll be there soon!” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said.

After hanging up the phone, Xia ruofei called Song Wei to the living room on the first floor.

Even though Xia ruofei did not come back often, Ling Qingxue had access to the villa. She maintained the cleanliness of the villa so well that there was almost no dust to be seen.

Xia ruofei and Song Wei sat down at the coffee table in the living room. Then, he took out the wild tea produced in the spirit map space and made tea with great familiarity.

In a short while, the villa’s living room was filled with the strong fragrance of tea.

They didn’t have to wait for long. As soon as they finished the tea, Xia ruofei cleaned the tea set and put in the second cup of tea, they heard the sound of a car outside the courtyard.

Then, they saw Ling Qingxue drive an orange Beetle car into the villa’s courtyard.

Ling Qingxue got out of the car and walked into the villa hurriedly. When she saw that Xia ruofei and Song Wei were already in the villa, her face lit up. She changed her shoes and asked,””Why did the two of you suddenly return to the three mountains?”

After Ling Qingxue said that, she couldn’t help but sniffle. With a puzzled look on her face, she asked,””Ruofei, is this the fragrance of wild tea? Didn’t they already run out of stock last time? Moreover, wild tea is so precious that it won’t have any effect after you drink it. How can you be so extravagant and drink it like ordinary tea?”

Xia ruofei and Song Wei looked at each other and smiled.

Then, Xia ruofei laughed and said,””Qingxue, your nose is so sharp! It’s indeed worthy of being born in the Year of the Dog. ”

Ling Qingxue pouted and said,”don’t mock me!” You haven’t answered my question yet!”

Ling Qingxue smiled and said,”Qingxue, can’t you tell?” This guy didn’t even wait for you to come back, and he already can’t wait to show off his wild tea. What does this mean?”

Ling Qingxue had already changed her shoes and was walking towards the living room when she heard this. She couldn’t help but freeze and stop in her tracks. After thinking for a while, a look of surprise appeared on her face. Her eyes lit up as she said,”Weiwei, you mean ... The wild tea has been successfully planted?”

Song Wei looked at Xia ruofei’s proud face and smiled bitterly.”Look at his expression. It already explains everything.”

Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but cheer,”this is great!” So, you all suddenly rushed back to the three mountains just to share this good news with me!”

“There’s more good news than this!” Song Wei smiled and said,”let ruofei say it himself!”

After she finished speaking, Song Wei poked Xia ruofei lightly.

Xia ruofei then cleared his throat and said,””Ling Qingxue, I took the time out of my busy schedule to come back to the three mountains ...”

When Song Wei and Ling Qingxue heard this, they rolled their eyes at the same time. How dare you use the word “busy” to describe it? You’re the one with the most free time, alright?

Xia ruofei pretended not to see their expressions and continued,””The main purpose of my return this time is to pass on a new cultivation technique to the two of you. As long as the two of you master this” nichang Heart Sutra,”your cultivation will not be delayed even if I’m not by your side.”

“A new cultivation technique?” Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but ask,”compared to the ‘absolute beginning Scripture’, which one is more powerful?”

“This ... There’s no absolute ...” Xia ruofei laughed dryly.

“Then it’s not as good as the” absolute beginning Heart Sutra “?” Ling Qingxue asked.

Hearing this, Xia ruofei said seriously,”Qingxue, objectively speaking, the ‘nichang Heart Sutra’ is indeed not as good as the ‘Taichu Heart Sutra’ when two Spirit bodies cultivate together.” However, cultivating in pairs was also a limitation of the “absolute beginning Heart Sutra.” After all, due to the limitations of objective conditions, cultivating in pairs was definitely not as convenient as cultivating alone. And if he just cultivated the “absolute beginning Heart Sutra” by himself, the efficiency would definitely be far inferior to the “nichang Heart Sutra”. Even if it was a normal pair cultivation, the effect would not be as good as the “nichang Heart Sutra”! Therefore, this cultivation technique is also very good. You must not look down on it. “
