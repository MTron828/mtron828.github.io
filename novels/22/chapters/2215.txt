2216 A subtle relationship (2)

Xia ruofei shrunk his neck and said,””Oh ... I thought you guys wanted to cultivate with me! Alright then ... Rest early! I’ll sleep in the guest room next door ... Oh right, there are new toiletries in the cabinet under the sink. You can see them when you open the cabinet door! Then you guys should rest early! Good night!”

With that, Xia ruofei strode towards the door.

Ling Qingxue heard Xia ruofei’s words and said,””Wait!”

Xia ruofei stopped in his tracks and turned to look at Ling Qingxue.

Ling Qingxue glanced at Xia ruofei and said,””You really reminded me ... It seems that you and Wei Wei haven’t cultivated for a long time! Why don’t you cooperate with her and cultivate today?”

Song Wei blushed and said,””Qingxue, forget it! It’s already so late, let’s talk about it another day ...”

“There’s no better day than the present!” Ling Qingxue smiled and said,”furthermore, this guy has the time array flag. You guys won’t take much time to cultivate, right?”

In fact, Song Wei wanted to cultivate with Xia ruofei. Not only was the efficiency of the spirit body combined cultivation very high, but the extreme feeling was also very enjoyable!

However, to cultivate with Xia ruofei in front of Ling Qingxue was a huge psychological barrier for her.

After all, although the two of them were sitting upright and still, the scene in their sea of consciousness was actually very embarrassing. Moreover, Ling Qingxue had also experienced it before, so she naturally knew what kind of scene the two of them were in during the process of cultivation.

How could Song Wei pull her face down?

“I don’t think so ...” Song Wei said in a low voice.

“Weiwei, since we’ve already made our decision, you don’t have to think too much about it, and don’t worry about me overthinking it,” Ling Qingxue said. If he couldn’t even overcome this psychological barrier, then he still had a long way to go! Could it be that he would never cultivate again? Then what’s the point of us discussing this for so long?”

After Ling Qingxue finished speaking, she saw that Song Wei was still looking down and not saying anything. She looked at Xia ruofei and asked,””Ruofei, don’t you think so?”

Xia ruofei was more shameless than Song Wei. He shrugged and said,””I’m fine with anything! As long as you have the need, I will do my best to cooperate!”

Ling Qingxue pursed her lips and said,”you’re making it seem like you’ve done more work than I have!” You should be so happy!”

Xia ruofei laughed dryly and didn’t say anything.

Ling Qingxue held Song Wei’s hand and said,””It’s decided then! RUO Fei, what are you doing? Go get the formation flags!”

“Oh!” Xia ruofei said,”wait! I’ll bring it over immediately!”

With that, Xia ruofei strode towards the door of the room. Of course, he could not take anything out of the spirit map space in front of Ling Qingxue and Song Wei, so he could only pretend that the array flags were in another room.

As soon as Xia ruofei left, Song Wei said to Ling Qingxue nervously,””Qingxue, do I really have to cultivate here with RUO Fei?”

“Of course!” Ling Qingxue said.

“But ... I feel weird ...” Song Wei blushed and said.

“Do you want me to leave?” Ling Qingxue asked with a faint smile.

“Don’t misunderstand!” Song Wei said,”I’m not saying that you’re in the way. I’m just ...”

Ling Qingxue laughed and said,”Wei Wei, you don’t have to explain so much. I understand!” How about this! I’m just about to take a bath, so I’ll go to the bathroom after you enter the array. According to the flow of time, I estimate that by the time I’m done with my bath, you’ll have finished your cultivation!”

Song Wei felt a little more at ease after hearing this.

If she had to cultivate with Xia ruofei Under Ling Qingxue’s “observation”, it would be a little unbearable. Although all the embarrassing process happened in her sea of consciousness, her physical body would also show a satisfied expression. Every time she finished cultivating, her face would be flushed red.

If Ling Qingxue were to see this, she would be too embarrassed ...

Song Wei lowered her head and pondered for a moment. Finally, she nodded gently and immediately said,”Alright! But after I’m done with RUO Fei, you’ll have to do the same with him!”

This time, it was Ling Qingxue’s turn to be embarrassed. She looked at Song Wei unnaturally and said,””I’ll pass ... I just cultivated with him ...”

“This won’t do! We must be fair!” Song Wei said,”only absolute fairness can make our relationship last! Didn’t we agree on this?”

Of course, Xia ruofei did not go far. He went to the room next door and took out the array flags from the medium before returning to the master bedroom.

Therefore, he had heard about 70 – 80% of the conversation between Ling Qingxue and Song Wei.

Xia ruofei pushed the door open and walked in with the array flag. He laughed bitterly in his heart. In the end, this brother had become a resource for their cultivation! And to maintain absolute fairness ...

However, Xia ruofei did not reject such alluring labor at all.

As he skillfully set up the array flags, he smiled and said,””I think Wei Wei’s right. Qingxue, I’ll cooperate with Wei Wei’s cultivation first. After that, it’ll be your turn!”

“Can you do it?”

Ling Qingxue’s words made Xia ruofei feel insulted. He glared at her and said,””Can you please remove the” is “word? Whether I can do it or not ... Aren’t you the one who knows best?”

Xia ruofei smiled evilly and continued,””Whether it’s the spirit body combination cultivation or in reality ...”

Ling Qingxue and Song Wei couldn’t help but blush. Women were always at a disadvantage when talking about dirty topics with men.

Ling Qingxue glared at Xia ruofei and said,””If you want to cultivate, then cultivate. What’s the point of talking so much? Since you’re not afraid of overusing your spiritual energy, what should I be afraid of? It’s decided!”

Then, Ling Qingxue turned to Song Wei and said,””Wei Wei, I’m going to take a shower first. You and RUO Fei should focus on your cultivation!”

Ling Qingxue found her home clothes in the closet and gave Song Wei an encouraging smile before walking into the bathroom.

Only Xia ruofei and Song Wei were left in the master bedroom. Song Wei seemed to be nervous and shy. She did not even dare to look at Xia ruofei in the eye.

Xia ruofei held Song Wei’s hand gently and said,””Wei Wei, thank you!”

Song Wei looked up and said seriously,”You should thank Qingxue. Don’t be fooled by her unforgiving words. She actually cares a lot about you ...”

“You two have to thank me!” Xia ruofei said,”but ... Are we going to cultivate in the array first? Otherwise, Qingxue will be out soon ...”

“Oh!” Song Wei said nervously.

Xia ruofei held Song Wei’s hand and walked into the time formation.

In the bathroom, the shower head was spraying warm water, but Ling Qingxue was still standing outside the shower room, completely undressed. She stared blankly at her own reflection in the mirror, her expression complicated, and didn’t move for a long time.

In fact, she had already extended her spiritual power out and sensed that Xia ruofei and Song Wei had already entered the time formation.

Ling Qingxue knew exactly what was going to happen in Song Wei’s consciousness.

Therefore, she was feeling rather complicated at the moment. There was a faint sorrow, but at the same time, she felt relieved.

No matter what, since he had decided, then he would walk down this path bravely! Ling Qingxue said to herself.

Then, she took off her clothes and walked into the shower room.

In the time formation, Song Wei, who had not cultivated with Xia ruofei for a long time, finally calmed down after a long time.

Xia ruofei took out the crystals and the two of them started to cultivate.

Once the heart technique of the “Scripture of the primordium” was activated, Song Wei had no other distracting thoughts. The two of them focused on controlling the true Qi to form and flow in their meridians.

After a few cycles, Xia ruofei took control of the Qi. A stream of mental energy followed the Qi and entered Song Wei’s consciousness without any obstacles ...ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels
