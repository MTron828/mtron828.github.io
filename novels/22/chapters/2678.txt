2679 Full of confidence (2)

When he was on the plane, he had been writing down his inspiration on a piece of paper while reading. At the same time, he had drawn a few rough sketches. It could be said that the overall layout of the array was becoming clearer and clearer in his mind, and some details were gradually being perfected.

Even though he did not sleep the entire night, Xia ruofei was in a state of excitement and did not feel tired at all.

He got off the helicopter on the roof, but he did not immediately return to the warehouse at the airport. Instead, he took the elevator down to the floor where Liu Qingfeng’s office was located.

“Hello, President Xia!” A burly Man in Black standing by the elevator saw Xia ruofei and quickly bowed to greet him.

“Is President Liu in his office?” Xia ruofei nodded.

“Reporting to President Xia, President Liu just went to the dock.” The Man in Black said,”there’s a group of people leaving today. According to the usual practice, boss Liu will go to the dock to see them off.”

Xia ruofei knew that these people had been sent back to the country in advance because of his words.

It wasn’t easy for these ordinary employees to return to their country. They would first take a boat to evatz Island and then fly back from there. There were no direct flights to China in ponatu, and the airport on Evarts island only operated short – distance small planes, so they still had two transfers on their way back to China. It could be said to be a very difficult journey.

“I know. When he comes back, ask him to come to my room to find me!” Xia ruofei said indifferently.

“Yes! President Xia!” The black – robed man quickly replied.

Xia ruofei turned around and walked back to the elevator. When he reached the floor where his suite was, he walked into his room. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

He went straight to the small study next to the bedroom, took out a drawing, ruler, and pencil from the space, and then began to draw on the table.

His spiritual power cultivation of the spirit gathering realm allowed his memory to be far better than that of an ordinary person. This time, he had no scruples when he took the plane to survey the area, so he could see very carefully. Therefore, he quickly outlined the terrain and environment of peach source Island and the surrounding sea areas without thinking.

Then, Xia ruofei started to make notes on the blueprint.

The positions that needed to be modified, the positions and depths of the nine Jade pillars, and how to set up the core array disc ... Xia ruofei already had a relatively clear answer to these things on the plane. He marked them all on the blueprint.

Of course, the symbols he used were very special. Without his explanation, even if someone got the drawing, they would not know what these scribbled – like patterns meant.

Xia ruofei was so engrossed in the drawing that he had completely forgotten the passage of time.

It was not until a knock on the door that he raised his head and stretched his slightly sore neck.

Xia ruofei’s spiritual power swept in the direction of the door, and he knew that Liu Qingfeng had come.

Thus, he stood up and with a slight thought, the drawings and tools on the desk disappeared into thin air and were put into the spirit map space.

Xia ruofei walked to the door and opened it.

“President Xia!” Liu Qingfeng respectfully bowed slightly and asked,”you’re looking for me?”

“Come in and talk!” Xia ruofei said indifferently.

Liu Qingfeng followed Xia ruofei into the room and sat down on the sofa in the living room.

“Have you sent all these people away?” Xia ruofei asked casually.

“Yes, they’ve already left the Peach Blossom Island by boat!” Liu Qingfeng said.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”there are a few things that I need you to confirm.”

“Please give me your orders!” Liu Qingfeng quickly said.

“First, find me an off – Road vehicle. I don’t need a driver. I want to take a good look around the island for the next two days.” Xia ruofei said.

Although he had basically figured out the situation of the entire natural array in the helicopter, there were still some details involved, especially several key parts of the array, which he still needed to go to the scene to confirm.

“No problem!” Liu Qingfeng said without hesitation.

There were a few cars and off – road vehicles on the island, which were usually used by the project department. This kind of thing was not difficult for Liu Qingfeng.

Xia ruofei continued.”Second, send benilatti to the airport warehouse later. From today onwards, my people will personally look after him!”

Liu Qingfeng was slightly stunned, and couldn’t help but say,”President Xia, will there be any safety issues? Why don’t I ... Send a few people ...”

Liu Qingfeng was very clear that Xia ruofei’s so – called “people” were actually only the White – bearded old man who escorted the goods yesterday. Using an old man to look after the strong benilatti? What if there were any safety issues?

From Liu Qingfeng’s point of view, bainilatti was a hot potato. He couldn’t wait to get rid of it. However, if anything happened on Xia ruofei’s side, it would be difficult for him to escape responsibility. Instead of that, it would be better to make things more troublesome and send more people to watch over this side.

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”you don’t have to worry about that. I’ll have more people to replace them.” Moreover ... This place was surrounded by the sea, where could he run to? As long as his brain is still working, he would not do such a stupid thing!”

Since Xia ruofei had already said this, Liu Qingfeng was naturally happy to save the trouble. He immediately said,””I understand! I’ll arrange for someone to send bainilatti over in a while!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”third, set up a temporary restricted area around the airport warehouse. Put up the cordon. Arrange for people to stand guard outside the cordon. All the staff and construction workers are not allowed to approach.” This must be strictly enforced. If anything goes wrong, I’ll hold you responsible!”

“Understood!” Liu Qingfeng said with a straight face. Don’t worry, President Xia! I’ll personally go and keep an eye on it!”

Liu Qingfeng was still counting on Xia ruofei to put in a few good words for him in front of old master Liu! Who would dare to slack off at Xia ruofei’s request? Moreover, Xia ruofei’s visit this time had stopped some of the clean – up projects, and more than half of the personnel had been sent back. It could be said that the engineering department did not have much work left. Liu Qingfeng naturally had to put his main energy into the things arranged by Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei patted Liu Qingfeng’s shoulder and said,”There may be more restricted areas in a few days, but I will also arrange some people to come over. At that time, you will be able to relax a little.”

“President Xia, it’s fine!” Liu Qingfeng grinned and said,”this little bit of work is nothing!”

“One last thing,” Xia ruofei said,”the original personnel will continue to be reduced! All the projects were stopped, and only the necessary personnel to maintain the normal operation of the Peach Blossom Island were kept. Go and make another plan immediately. Don’t let anyone who can leave stay! In addition, I want you to make a list of the people who have been decided to stay for the work. I want to meet them one by one. ”

“Yes!” Liu Qingfeng said. I’ll get on it immediately!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”okay, you can leave now.” After you’ve arranged the car, just leave the keys at the front desk on the first floor. I’ll go and get it myself when I go downstairs. ”

“Alright! President Xia, I’ll get back to work then!” Liu Qingfeng said.

After Liu Qingfeng took his leave, Xia ruofei returned to the small study room and took out the drawings and tools from the spirit map space again. He continued to work on the unfinished part.

Xia ruofei only finished the blueprint by noon. He only needed to go to the place to confirm the details.

Xia ruofei also heaved a long sigh of relief. After today’s further investigation, he found that it was easier to activate the Taixu xuanqing formation than he had expected. In addition, Li Yifu had prepared sufficient materials, so he was naturally more confident.

Xia ruofei kept the drawing and left the room to take the elevator down.

Although Xia ruofei said that he only needed to leave the car keys at the front desk on the first floor, how could Liu Qingfeng dare to neglect it? After he had settled Xia ruofei’s matters, he personally went to pick up the best land Rover in the project department. He drove it out and cleaned it inside and out. Then, he parked the car downstairs and waited with the car keys.

“President Xia, the car is ready! It’s at the door! “Here’s the car key. Here you are ...” Liu Qingfeng quickly went up to Xia ruofei when he saw him walking out of the elevator.

“Alright, thank you for your hard work!” Xia ruofei took the car keys. After taking two steps, he turned back and said,”Oh right, can you go to the staff cafeteria and pack two sets of lunch for me? I’ll take it with me.”
