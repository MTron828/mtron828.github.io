2646 Everyone’s heart is different (2)

Liu Kuan, who was exhausted, didn’t rest.

He first confirmed with the inner Affairs Department of the Cornelian Empire about the permanent ownership of Qing Yun Island, which was under the management of the inner Affairs Department of the Cornelian Empire. This might sound a bit weird, but it was arranged in such a way.

After contacting the Home Affairs Department, Liu Kuan called Liu Qingfeng and other middle management to the conference room.

He also came here with a mission this time. He had to arrange a lot of work overnight. When he left the blue cloud Island, the first batch of personnel who had returned to China would also return to Qianqian. This was also the reason why the Liu family had specially rented an Airbus A350 to carry out this mission.

Liu Kuan first warned everyone seriously that although the family had decided to transfer the green cloud Island to Xia ruofei and would complete the transfer procedures as soon as possible, the completion of the project and the daily management of the green cloud Island must not be affected. Those who left had to hand over their work, and those who stayed had to work harder to complete their tasks.

Liu Kuan also seriously expressed the importance that old master Liu and the Liu family attached to Xia ruofei, which rang an alarm for Liu Qingfeng and the others.

After that, he brought Liu Qingfeng and the others to discuss the issue of the personnel leaving.

Of course, those who left would just return to the country in advance to take up new positions, while those who stayed would just stay for a little longer. They would eventually reach the same destination through different means.

Therefore, Liu Qingfeng and the others naturally wanted to leave. Since there was no point in staying, it was better to return to China earlier. Perhaps they could arrange a good seat.

Liu Kuan certainly couldn’t take care of everyone’s needs. After discussion, he finally decided that Liu Qingfeng would stay as the chief supervisor of the project, and two other supervisors would also stay. Their management parts were related to the several projects on green cloud Island that had not yet been completed, so they naturally had to finish them.

Liu Kuan had a lot of prestige, and no one dared to refute his decision.

On Qing Yun Island, Liu Kuan represented the will of old man Liu. Who would dare to say no?

Then, Liu Kuan took everyone out the specific list overnight. In addition to the middle management, the Liu family’s company Group had also sent many employees to be responsible for the basic work of all aspects of Qing Yun Island. These people would eventually have to leave.

However, during this transition period, there was still a need for a group of people to maintain the normal operation of the island.

……

Xia ruofei rested for the night. The next morning, he opened the window and saw the blue ocean. He felt refreshed.

Liu Kuan and Liu Qingfeng accompanied Xia ruofei to have a sumptuous breakfast. On this Island thousands of miles away from Huaxia, they could drink very authentic soy milk, eat fragrant youtiao, and eat xiaolongbao, which oozed oil with just a bite. It was indeed a very sumptuous meal.

After breakfast, Xia ruofei set off for evates Island, which was about 70 to 80 kilometers away from Qingyun Island. Liu Kuan and benilatti were also on the same plane.

Bainilatti was in charge of coordinating the local affairs of ponauthu, so generally speaking, as long as they were dealing with the officials of ponauthu, they would definitely bring him along.

It was still the same super Jaguar helicopter and the same pilot.

When Xia ruofei and the others boarded the plane, the pilot even gave Xia ruofei a friendly smile.

Xia ruofei nodded at him and sat down in the cabin.

The helicopter’s propeller began to spin faster, and the noise in the cabin increased rapidly. Xia ruofei and the others put on sound – proof headphones.

Liu Kuan pointed at the pilot in front and said to Xia ruofei,””Mr. Xia, this super Jaguar will stay here as well. As for the pilot, you can hire him or let him stay.”

“Thank you!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Strictly speaking, this super Jaguar was also a property of green cloud Island, so it was normal to keep it. The entire Island had been transferred to him, and Xia ruofei did not refuse.

The pilot was also Chinese. When he heard Liu Kuan talking about him, he turned around and smiled at Xia ruofei and Liu Kuan.

Liu Kuan continued,”his name is Wu Wenhan. He used to be a pilot in the air Force. He retired after choosing his own career. He’s not an employee of our Liu family. If you think his skills are good, you can keep him to work.”

“I will consider it!” Xia ruofei nodded.

Under Wu Wenhan’s control, the helicopter slowly took off. It first flew half a circle around the island, then flew straight in one direction, which was where evates Island was.

Because they had already contacted each other in advance, the Super Jaguar entered the territory of the ponautu without any hindrance.

After flying for about 40 minutes, the helicopter entered the territory of Evarts Island.

Looking down from the sky, the island was much larger than the island of clear sky. However, there were only dilapidated bungalows as far as the eye could see. It seemed that more than half of the island was made up of slums. Only the southeast side of the island occupied about one – fifth of the entire Island, and some buildings could be seen.

The helicopter was flying at a very low altitude. Xia ruofei’s eyesight was not bad, so he could even see the people on the ground who were looking up at the helicopter. Many of them looked pale and were dressed in poor clothes. Some of them were children running under the plane. They were just skin and bones.

This was the capital Island, and the situation was already like this. One could imagine the poverty level of the Cornelian Empire.

The Super Jaguar quickly passed through the civilian area and arrived at a relatively well – built area on the southeast side of the island. It landed steadily on a helicopter landing point with an “H” symbol.

Xia ruofei and the others jumped off the helicopter and ran towards a building on the south side of the landing point, braving the strong wind caused by the helicopter’s propeller. They only changed to walking quickly after they left the range of the helicopter’s propeller.

“Mr. Xia, this ten – story building is the Home Affairs Department and the police department of ponautu,” Liu Kuan said as he walked. “They share this office building. Among the group of people standing in front of the building, the one in the middle wearing a brown suit is the ponautu Minister of the Interior, Evian. ”

Xia ruofei was surprised.”Uncle Liu, they actually sent the Minister to welcome you personally. You’re really respected!”

“That’s a small country,” Liu Kuan said with a smile.”Their territory is smaller than our County. The Minister of Internal Affairs is at most a bureau chief in our County!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh. “That’s a proper country, after all!”

“Our family group also has some business overseas.” Liu Kuan chuckled and said,”in order to take over the blue cloud Island, we also gave them a lot of economic concessions. So far, the agate map and our family group have a lot of trade relations.”

Xia ruofei suddenly realized and smiled.””It’s the God of Fortune! No wonder they value it so much!”

While they were talking, they arrived at the ten – story office building. Evian, the Minister of the Interior of the carnade, also came down the steps and said enthusiastically,””Mr. Liu! My Chinese friend, long time no see!” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Liu Kuan hugged Evian and said,””Minister Evian, I haven’t seen you for a long time, but you still look so good!”

Xia ruofei could not help but look at the Minister of the Interior in front of him. Evian had brown skin and sunken eyes. He had the typical look of the indigenous people of the South Pacific island. However, compared to the skinny residents of the slums he saw on the plane just now, this Minister had a big belly and looked fat. It was obvious that he had eaten too much fish and meat every day.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but shake his head. At this time, Liu Kuan and Evian had finished their greetings. He looked at Xia ruofei, smiled, and began to introduce,””Mr. Evian, this is Xia ruofei. He’s a junior that our master values very much. The reason why we’ve come to trouble you this time is because the master has bestowed the blue cloud Island to him.”
