Xia ruofei finally understood. He said,””In that case, the spirit body has already been killed by me, so the yin Qi here will only increase?”

“That’s right!”Senior copper coffin said with a smile. I believe it won’t be long before this place becomes a true land of extreme Yin … At that time, it won’t be so easy to come in again.”

The copper coffin senior then changed the topic and said,”Of course, even if you didn’t come in and kill this spirit body, as my injuries get better, my need for Yin Qi will also decrease correspondingly. By then, I’m sure that the spirit body won’t be able to keep up with the speed of the growth of the yin Qi, so it won’t have much of an impact. At most, you’ll just accelerate the process by killing the spirit body.”

“I understand …” Xia ruofei said.”l was too rash …”

Senior copper coffin waved his hand and said,”let’s not talk about this … By the way, didn’t I remind you last time not to enter the underground palace before reaching the nascent Soul Stage?” This old master isn’t trying to scare you, but there are many areas in this underground Palace that are extremely dangerous. Even golden core cultivators will find it difficult to escape from those places!” “Thank you for your concern, uncle master Zhao!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it’s just that I’m a little impatient. We were very careful this time and followed the same route as last time. We didn’t dare to barge in.”

Xia ruofei didn’t expect the spirit body to have such an important role. He couldn’t help but take a deep breath and said anxiously,””Uncle – Master Zhao, if that’s the case, RUO Fei’s recklessness this time has caused big trouble …”

The senior in the coffin smiled and said,””I’ve fought with this spirit body several times in the past, and in the end, we both suffered heavy losses. 1 had no choice but to use this cold Yin place to control my injuries, but this spirit body’s injuries are even more serious. Its physical body has been completely destroyed, and only this corner of the underground palace can barely keep its spirit body from being destroyed …”

After saying that, the senior with the copper coffin sighed and continued,””In fact, my injuries have recovered quite well over the years, but the spirit body has been weakening day by day. Over the years, if I wanted to kill it, it would be as easy as turning my hand over. The reason why I have kept it is to balance the cold Qi in this underground Palace!”

Xia ruofei listened attentively and did not interrupt senior copper coffin. He just listened quietly. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“The yin Qi here is extremely dense, and it can be considered one of the more dangerous secret realms in the cultivation world,” senior copper coffin continued. Back then, this old man and that spirit body fought here for a day and a night, and in the end, both sides were injured. This old man could only use this copper coffin as a shelter, absorbing Yin Qi day and night to recover from his injuries. The spirit body was the same; it was already a pure spirit body, and although the yin Qi couldn’t allow it to regrow a physical body, it could at least greatly reduce the speed at which the spirit body dissipated. We’ve been absorbing the yin energy with all our might all these years, so …”

Speaking of this, the senior in the copper coffin couldn’t help but sigh and say,””In the beginning, almost all of the yin energy in the underground palace was gone. As time passed, my injuries slowly recovered, and 1 naturally didn’t absorb as much yin energy as I did a few years ago. The amount of yin energy consumed by the spirit body is almost fixed every day, so the amount of yin energy we absorb is getting less and less. The underground palace has also gradually reached a balance between yin and yang…”

Xia ruofei finally understood. He said,””In that case, the spirit body has already been killed by me, so the yin Qi here will only increase?”
