Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei looked at the caller ID. It was Zhao Yongjun from the capital. He let out a long breath and temporarily removed the accumulated negative emotions.

“Big brother Zhao!” Xia ruofei said.

“RUO Fei!” Zhao Yongjun’s tone was as forthright and enthusiastic as ever.”I haven’t contacted you for a while. How have you been?”

“It’s alright! He’s busy all day!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”brother Zhao, what’s the matter?”

Zhao Yongjun didn’t answer Xia ruofei. Instead, he asked,””Ruofei, why do I feel that you’re a little down? What happened?”

Although Xia ruofei had tried to control his emotions, he felt as disgusted as if he had eaten a fly today. His tone was more or less low. Zhao Yongjun was also a person with rich social experience, so he could tell.

“Oh ... It’s nothing!” Xia ruofei replied,”it’s just a small problem in the business. Brother Zhao, don’t worry about it. I can handle it myself!” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Zhao Yongjun immediately said unhappily,”ruofei, are you treating me like an outsider?” If you encounter any problems, just tell me. Let’s not talk about whether I can help you or not. At least I have more experience than you, so I can at least give you some ideas, right?”

“Hey! I’m really fine!” Xia ruofei said,”brother Zhao, if you’re willing to listen, I’ll tell you ...”

Xia ruofei happened to have a stomach full of anger as well. Since Zhao Yongjun was so insistent on getting to the bottom of it, he might as well not hide it and told him the whole story.

After he finished, Xia ruofei said gloomily,””Brother Zhao, don’t you think this matter is quite infuriating? You’ve gotten such a bug from munching on melon seeds!”

Zhao Yongjun couldn’t help but be speechless after hearing this. He said,””Who’s this grandson? It was so awesome! He had never heard of such a person in the capital! Ruofei, big brother will help you vent your anger later! He’s just a small manager of a state – owned enterprise, but he’s already so good. If I didn’t know better, I would have thought that he was the chairman of Tongren Hall!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it doesn’t matter if I vent my anger or not. To be honest, I don’t have to worry about sales at all. It’s just that it’s a little slow to get back the money if I sell it myself. At that time, Tongren Hall was willing to buy in bulk, and I wanted to save time, so I gave them a chance to make money and become famous. I didn’t expect this to happen! If it wasn’t for the fact that I’m on good terms with the Regional Vice President of Tongren Hall, and that I’m in urgent need of money recently, I’d have completely terminated the cooperation!”

“You’re in need of money?”Zhao asked. I still have some money on hand, so I’ll give you some first!”

“No need, big brother Zhao!” Xia ruofei said.

Then, he briefly told Zhao Yongjun about buying the building. When Zhao Yongjun heard that Xia ruofei’s capital gap had reached 100 million, he couldn’t help but click his tongue.

He said,”I’m so far off! Then I really don’t have ...”

Although Zhao Yongjun had some assets, it was impossible for him to take out 100 million in cash.

He continued,”ruofei, I have a few friends in the bank. How about ... I help you contact them?” Your company’s current valuation should not be low, especially after the sale of the jaded skin cream. The bank should be more optimistic! By the way, your company doesn’t have a lot of loans, right?”

Xia ruofei said,”brother Zhao, I appreciate your kindness. I can solve this problem. I still have a place to make money.” Don’t you worry!”

Zhao Yongjun laughed,””Alright then! Then I won’t bother about the money! But ... About the Tongren Hall ...”

“You don’t have to worry about this!” Xia ruofei quickly replied,”it’s normal to have some hiccups in business ...”

“I understand ...” Zhao Yongjun said noncommittally.

“Oh right, brother Zhao,” Xia ruofei asked again,”we’ve been talking for a long time. You still haven’t told me what you need from me!”

Zhao Yongjun laughed and said,”it’s not a big deal!” We’ve been quite free recently, so we thought of going to the southeast to play for a few days. We haven’t been to your farm either, have we? Everyone wants to see you too! Take a look around, you’re familiar with the people here, just Liu Jian, liangzi, and a few others!”

Xia ruofei said happily,”welcome!” You guys can come over anytime! I’ll welcome you with open arms and accompany you for the entire journey, including food and lodging!”

“Hahaha! We won’t stand on ceremony with a big tycoon like you!” Zhao Yongjun laughed heartily.”I’m just saying hello to you first. If there’s nothing else, we’ll fly over to find you in the next two days! If you have any work in the near future, arrange it in advance. Don’t be too busy. ”

“No problem!” Xia ruofei replied,”I’m free anytime!”

“Alright! Then we’ll meet at the three mountains!” Zhao Yongjun said.

Xia ruofei said,”sure!” I’ll be waiting for you guys!”

After hanging up the phone, Xia ruofei thought about how Zhao Yongjun and the rest would arrange their visit.

In terms of accommodation, it was quite good at Taoyuan farm. In any case, what kind of luxury hotel had these second and third generations not stayed in? On the other hand, Taoyuan farm had a beautiful environment and was by the sea, so it was easy to arrange food. The authentic Sanshan specialty dishes, with Taoyuan vegetables as ingredients, were definitely of high quality.

As for whether they would stay in the three mountains for the entire trip or go to some other places around, including the famous tourist city Heron Island, it was up to Zhao Yongjun and the others.
