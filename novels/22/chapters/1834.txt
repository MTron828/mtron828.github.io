Ling Qingxue’s talent for cultivation was clearly above Xia ruofei’s expectations. In a short period of time, Ling Qingxue’s dantian had already produced a large amount of true Qi. This amount of true Qi was enough for her to start officially cultivating the “Taichu Heart Sutra”.

According to Xia ruofei’s estimation, Ling Qingxue would need at least half a day or even a day to complete the initial accumulation of true Qi.

“So the effects of cultivation are good?” Ling Qingxue asked, confused.

“It’s more than just “not bad”!” Xia ruofei said excitedly,”you can now officially come into contact with the ‘absolute beginning Heart Sutra’!”

“Really?” Ling Qingxue was so happy that she almost jumped up.”Then what are we waiting for? Let’s start now!”

Xia ruofei rubbed Ling Qingxue’s nose lovingly and said,””Can you see what time it is now?”

Ling Qingxue looked up at the clock on the wall and exclaimed,””It’s already midnight? Oh my God! Why do I feel like it’s only been a little while?”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”That’s how cultivation is. When you’re fully engrossed in it, you can’t even feel the passage of time. That’s why there’s the saying ‘cultivation knows no time’!”

Ling Qingxue blinked her eyes and asked worriedly,””Then, will it be like in the TV shows, where I accidentally cultivate for decades? When I wake up, wouldn’t the entire world have changed?”

Xia ruofei laughed,”what are you thinking?” Such worries can wait until you’ve cultivated to the original infant stage! A cultivator who wasn’t even in the Qi cultivation stage wanted to go into closed – door cultivation for decades? Have you reached the level of inedia? Wouldn’t he have starved to death after sitting there for decades?”

Ling Qingxue was a little embarrassed as she said,””I don’t understand this! You didn’t tell me ...”

Then, Ling Qingxue said, full of energy,””Ruofei, although it’s late, I’m not tired at all! He even felt that his entire body was filled with strength! Why don’t we rest later, and you can teach me the first level of the “absolute beginning Scripture”?”

“I don’t mind ... But can you really take it?” Xia ruofei asked, trying to hold back his laughter.

“Endure what?” Ling Qingxue was confused.

Xia ruofei deliberately sniffed and said,””You smell yourself ...”

Only then did Ling Qingxue come to her senses. She suddenly realized that her body was filled with a sour smell, as if she had not taken a bath in a hundred years. Her skin was also covered with a thin layer of dark brown dirt. It was as disgusting as it could get.

She shrieked, covered her face, and rushed to the bathroom. Xia ruofei laughed loudly behind her.

Xia ruofei had a similar experience.

This was the first time Ling Qingxue had come into contact with cultivation. Even though it was only a beginner’s technique, the effects of cultivation were quite good. So, during the process of cultivation, the impurities in her body, especially in her meridians, were unconsciously removed.

How could Ling Qingxue, who had always loved beauty, stand such a sour and pungent smell? Moreover, he didn’t want to endure the sticky feeling on his body for even a second longer.

She stayed in the bathroom for more than an hour and could not remember how many times she had washed herself. She had probably used up half a bottle of shower gel. She did not know if it was because of psychological factors, but she kept feeling that the smell on her body had not been washed away.

Xia ruofei was the one who was worried. He knocked on the bathroom door and shouted,””Wife, are you asleep?”

Ling Qingxue replied in a panic,”I’m fine!” I’m out now!”

She turned off the water tap of the shower head and sniffed her body for a long time. Then, she wiped her body with a bath towel, put on a bathrobe, and walked out of the bathroom.

Ling Qingxue saw how Xia ruofei was trying to hold back his laughter and was filled with anger. She pouted and said,””Why are you so bad! Why didn’t you remind me when you knew I was so dirty?”

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”I wanted to remind you, but you were so excited. I didn’t have a chance to say it ... I thought you could feel it yourself!” After all, that sticky feeling ... Tsk tsk ...”

“Don’t say anymore!” Ling Qingxue was both embarrassed and angry. She threw herself at Xia ruofei and punched his chest like rain.

Xia ruofei quickly dodged and said,”wife, take it easy!” You’re no longer an ordinary person! With this punch, even a strong man wouldn’t be able to bear the consequences!”

Ling Qingxue stopped and asked in disbelief,””It’s really that powerful? Why don’t I feel any stronger?”

Xia ruofei laughed.”Your physique must have improved by a lot. Your strength must have increased as well. However, this is not a big deal. If you use your true energy when you punch, I’m afraid that even a burly man would not be able to withstand it!”

“Really!” Ling Qingxue was shocked.

This was because she had only been in contact with cultivation for less than half a day. It was truly unbelievable that she could achieve such great results in such a short period of time.

Xia ruofei could tell what Ling Qingxue was thinking. He smiled and said,””Qingxue, you have to correct one thought. That is, cultivation and martial arts are two completely different concepts. Even the most basic level of cultivators may be more powerful than those who have been practicing martial arts for more than ten years or even decades. This is normal ...”

Ling Qingxue nodded. This was the first time she had experienced the power of a cultivator.
