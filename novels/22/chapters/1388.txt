Chapter 1389: Turkey ice cream (1)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei arranged the use of these gifts in a few sentences, so Lin Qiao naturally didn’t have any objections.

As for the two sets of cosmetics that song Rui gave her, she would not feel the pinch.

What Lancome? what ocean blue mystery? how could they compare to the jaded skin cream that brother ruofei personally developed?

It was decided.

Poor song Rui. In order to make his gift stand out, he had even used some personal connections to make sure that Lancome face cream was a limited edition and couldn’t be bought in ordinary stores.

He didn’t expect his gift to be the most “miserable” one. Lin Qiao directly gave it to someone else. At least, Lin Qiao kept the other gifts for her own use.

Lin Qiao carefully put away the gifts. Xia ruofei said, “Qiao’ er, we’ll be back at San Shan tomorrow. You should study hard in school. If it’s hard to buy high – speed rail tickets, I’ll get someone to pick you up.”

“Ah? You’re leaving tomorrow?” Lin Qiao was a little reluctant.

These two days were the happiest she had ever been since she went to university on Egret Island. With Xia ruofei by her side, she felt that all her worries were gone. The only problem was that she could not concentrate. She could not help but think of Xia ruofei when she was revising or in class.

“Yup! We’re all just taking a break from work to relax, we can’t always be out playing!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

In fact, Zhao Yongjun and the others weren’t in the mood to play anymore. They wanted to go back to Jing and decide on the location of the club first, then start the construction. Everyone was very interested in the club that the brothers had built together, and they were very optimistic about the future of the club.

“Oh ... I know!” Lin Qiao was a little depressed. I’ll study hard ... And don’t worry about the high – speed rail tickets. Sister he found a ticket – snatching app, so I should be able to get them. ”

It wasn’t easy to buy tickets during the spring Festival, but everyone had their own skills, so many ticket – snatching software and plug – ins were born, but the effect was not clear.

Xia ruofei was not as confident as Lin Qiao. He smiled and said,””It’ll be great if you can buy it. If you can ‘t, call me. It’s not far from Heron Island to Sanshan anyway. I’ll send a car to pick you up.”

He didn’t dare to say that he would drive to pick her up. On the one hand, he couldn’t guarantee that he wouldn’t have the time. On the other hand, with his understanding of Lin Qiao, if he said so, this girl would say that she couldn’t buy the ticket even if she got it ...

“I know!” Lin Qiao said.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”don’t be unhappy!” I’ve received so many gifts today!”

“I’m not unhappy. I just can’t bear to see you leave!”Lin Qiao smiled.

“The holiday is in a few days. We’ll meet again then, won’t we?” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”let’s go. I’ll take you out for a walk!”

“Alright!” Lin Qiao said.

Xia ruofei saw that Lin Qiao was in a bad mood and wanted to take her out for a walk. He knew that this girl was very dependent on him, but this mood should be temporary. He just needed to divert her attention.

The two of them left the hotel and strolled forward.

“Brother ruofei, I want ice cream!” Lin Qiao suddenly pointed to the front.

Xia ruofei looked in the direction Lin Qiao was pointing at and saw a Turkey ice cream shop that had been renovated into a small wooden house. A tall Westerner was busy working in the shop.

“You’re eating ice cream in the middle of winter?”he couldn’t help but laugh.

“So old – fashioned?” Lin Qiao said,”who made the rule that ice cream can only be eaten in summer? Besides, the winter on Heron Island isn’t very cold!”

“Alright, alright, alright! As long as you’re not afraid of having an upset stomach, we’ll go eat!” Xia ruofei said.

Lin Qiao smiled and said,”I’m not afraid!” I have you, the divine Doctor, to help me, don’t I?”

In Lin Qiao’s eyes, Xia ruofei was almost omnipotent. If he could cure uremia, wouldn’t he be able to cure a cold from eating ice cream?

“So you were waiting for me here?” Xia ruofei smiled bitterly.”Satisfy your appetite first. If there’s a problem with the food, then you can treat it? I think you’re a little foodie too, just like song Rui!”

Lin Qiao said slyly,”since their shops are open in winter, it means that they have business in winter!” Since other people can eat it, why can’t we?”

Xia ruofei took a look at the Turkey ice cream shop. Business was not good. Other than the lack of tourists at night, it must have had something to do with the weather.

However, Xia ruofei naturally wouldn’t expose her. It was rare for Lin Qiao to make a request. Furthermore, it wasn’t a big deal. Naturally, he had to satisfy her.

So, the two of them walked toward the small wooden house that sold ice cream.

The tall and handsome old man smiled when he saw them and said,””Welcome! Our shop has a variety of flavors of ice cream, you’re welcome to buy!”

His Chinese is quite good! Xia ruofei looked at the foreigner curiously, then turned around and asked with a smile,””Qiao’ er, what flavor do you like?”

“I want the Tri – colored one!” Lin Qiao said without hesitation.

“I’m the same!” Xia ruofei said to the foreigner who sold ice cream,”two tricolored ice cream!”

“Alright, please wait a moment!” The foreigner said.

Then, he deftly took down one of the stacked egg cylinders and skillfully scooped out the ice cream with a small long handle, filling the cylinder.

“Who’s first?”the foreigner asked with a smile.

Xia ruofei was naturally prepared to let Lin Qiao eat first. After all, she wanted to eat ice cream, and Ladies First!

But before Xia ruofei could say anything, Lin Qiao said,””Brother ruofei, you go first!”

“What’s wrong?” Xia ruofei was confused. Didn’t this girl really want to eat it? Why was he being so modest now?

“Aiya, go and get it!” Lin qiaojiao pouted and said,”it’ll be quick anyway. Isn’t it the same who goes first?”

Xia ruofei thought about it and agreed. He stepped forward and was about to take the ice cream.

He didn’t see the sly smile in Lin Qiao’s eyes as if her scheme had succeeded.

The foreigner used the small, long – handled shovel with ice cream stuck on it and handed it over.

Xia ruofei stretched out his hand to receive it. At this moment, he sharply noticed that the shovel trembled slightly.

Xia ruofei was already a practitioner. His spiritual power was very strong and his five senses were far superior to ordinary people. In a flash, he subconsciously turned his wrist and accurately predicted the movement of the shovel. Then, he held the egg container without any mistake.

The foreigner who sold ice cream was stunned. Lin Qiao was also stunned.

Xia ruofei tugged at it lightly and felt that the ice cream was very sticky. If he used too much force, it might stick to the spatula. He had no choice but to take out an egg container.

With a slight shake of his wrist, he removed the ice cream with ease.

At this moment, Xia ruofei realized that Lin Qiao and the foreigner who sold ice cream were both in a daze.

“What’s wrong?” Xia ruofei asked.

He didn’t know that Gulangyu’s Turkey ice cream shop was very popular on the internet. Not only did it taste good, but the ingredients were also authentic. The reason why this shop was popular was that this handsome Turkish uncle knew how to play “tricks.”

Every time a customer reached out to grab the ice cream, the owner would nimbly use the shovel to avoid the customer’s hand. Sometimes it would fly up and down, sometimes it would sway left and right, and the customer couldn’t grab the ice cream no matter how hard they tried.

Sometimes, when they finally caught it, they didn’t realize that the boss had actually used two egg cones. The boss raised his hand and took the real ice cream back with the cone. The customer only had one empty cone in his hand.

The whole process was so interesting that it became famous on the internet. During the summer day, there was always a long line, and customers were all waiting to be “fooled.”

Lin Qiao deliberately didn’t tell Xia ruofei because she wanted to see the omnipotent brother ruofei embarrass himself.

The owner did not know that Xia ruofei was a high – Level cultivator. No matter how fast he was, he could not escape Xia ruofei’s eyes. His reaction speed was not on the same level as Xia ruofei ‘S. So, he tried to deal with Xia ruofei the way he usually dealt with ordinary customers. Naturally, he failed.

Except for his own mistakes, the boss rarely encountered such a situation, so he was also on the verge of a mental breakdown. Why don’t you play by the rules? The script wasn’t supposed to be like this!

Xia ruofei was not aware of all this. He even thought that the owner’s hand had not held it firmly. He was even thinking that it was fortunate that he had caught it in time. Otherwise, the ice cream would have fallen to the ground and it would have been a waste.

Lin Qiao looked at Xia ruofei in shock. After a while, she said,”Brother ruofei, how did you do it?”

“What do you mean?” Xia ruofei was confused.

Lin Qiao told Xia ruofei about the specialty of the Turkey ice cream shop. Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.”Why didn’t you say so earlier? If you had told me earlier, I would have cooperated with him ...”

These words made the boss, who had excellent Chinese, want to cry even more.”Since when did I need the cooperation of customers to perform?

Lin Qiao looked at Xia ruofei in amusement and mumbled,””It’s boring to come out with an expert like you ...” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Then, she smiled at the foreigner and said,””Boss, I still have my ice cream!”

The foreigner, who had been deeply shocked, came back to his senses. He quickly took out another cone and prepared the ice cream.

Lin Qiao stood in front of the counter with anticipation. The foreigner took a deep breath and made up his mind. This time, she must not screw up.

One of them was looking forward to being fooled while the other was cheering for herself to succeed. Xia ruofei, who was watching from the side, could not help but find it funny.

The foreigner’s next performance was very successful. Lin Qiao tried her best to catch the ice cream, but the ice cream was like a mischievous spirit. Under the foreigner’s control, it drifted left and right, causing Lin Qiao to giggle.

After a gaudy performance, the foreigner took a paper bag and wrapped the cone in it. Lin Qiao high – fived the foreigner with great familiarity and took her tricolored ice cream.

Lin Qiao glanced at Xia ruofei proudly as if to say,”Did you see? This was the correct operation!
