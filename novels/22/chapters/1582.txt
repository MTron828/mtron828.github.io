Chapter 1584: Return with a full load (1)

Translator: 549690339

After the true Qi in Song Wei’s dantian was compressed to an extreme, her entire dantian seemed to tremble slightly. Then, she felt a majestic power erupting out.

The bottleneck between Qi disciple Level 1 and Qi disciple Level 2 was like a window paper, easily broken through.

Song Wei felt an indescribable comfort throughout her body, and the circulation of her true Qi was much smoother.

This kind of improvement was all – Round. The same amount of true Qi, the energy contained in it had more than doubled, and the meridians in his body had also become wider and tougher during the breakthrough process.

Even though Song Wei had not trained in any specific techniques, with her current level of training, even three to five men who had trained in martial arts would not be her match. After all, training and training were on completely different levels. As long as Song Wei used a little bit of her true Qi, ordinary martial artists would not be able to withstand a single blow from her.

Xia ruofei’s face showed a trace of joy, but he still concentrated his energy. He worked with Song Wei to control the genuine Qi and circulated it for a few more rounds. After stabilizing the realm, he stopped and stood up.

“Song Wei, very well done!” Xia ruofei said,”let’s rest for half an hour. We’ll cultivate one last time. We must consolidate our realm!” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“I feel full of energy, I don’t need to rest,” said Song Wei.

Xia ruofei laughed and looked at Song Wei.”Did you forget what I said again? Hurry ...”

“Haste makes waste, right? My ears are getting calluses from this!” Song Wei chuckled.”I know! I know! I’ll listen to you, alright?”

“Hehe ... Eat something and replenish your energy!” Xia ruofei said.

Song Wei said as she moved her arms and legs,”Is there nothing else to eat other than biscuits and instant noodles? I’ve been eating it for half a month. I don’t have any appetite when I smell it now ...”

“I’ll make do with it!” Xia ruofei said,”I’ll treat you to a big meal when we return to the three mountains!”

“You said it!” Song Wei said happily,”you can’t go back on your word when the time comes!”

“Look at you! You’re a rich lady with a net worth of at least 500000 Yuan, why would you care about the money for a meal?” Xia ruofei said jokingly.

“But I still can’t compare to you, a billionaire!” As Song Wei spoke, she tore open the last bag of biscuits, grabbed a piece and stuffed it into her mouth.

The two of them ate something and drank some water. After resting for about half an hour, they sat down and continued to cultivate.

The training lasted for about three hours. In these three hours, Song Wei’s realm was completely consolidated at Qi disciple Level 2.

The reason why she was able to consolidate her realm so quickly was partly because of the massive amount of spiritual energy contained in the spiritual crystal. For Song Wei’s current cultivation, the spiritual energy in a spiritual crystal was almost endless, enough to support her cultivation for a long time. On the other hand, under Xia ruofei’s guidance, Song Wei’s Foundation was extremely solid. This breakthrough was just a matter of time, so it was very easy for her to consolidate her realm.

After Song Wei’s realm was consolidated, Xia ruofei kept the array flags and officially ended the long cultivation.

Although only four to five hours had passed in the outside world, they had actually stayed in the time formation for 17 to 18 days. Even Xia ruofei was feeling a little tired, mainly in terms of his spirit.

Therefore, after they finished their cultivation, the two of them went back to their rooms to take a bath and rest.

......

The next morning, Xia ruofei and Song Wei called Yu mingdong and Shi Lei to have breakfast at the hotel. Then, they waited in the hotel lobby for a while. An escort vehicle that Yu mingdong had contacted in advance arrived at the hotel.

They took a car to the site of the public Jade bid and took out all five of Xia ruofei’s raw stones. They packed them into boxes and loaded them into the escort company’s car. Then, they went straight to Hongzhou, which was more than 90 kilometers away.

Originally, Xia ruofei did not want Yu mingdong to send him off. After all, the airport was not in Ruizhou and it was nearly a hundred kilometers away. However, Yu mingdong insisted on sending him off, so Xia ruofei let him be.

Shi Lei was on high alert throughout the journey, but it was calm and peaceful. After more than an hour, the car arrived at Hongzhou airport smoothly.

When they were about to reach the airport, Song Wei made a phone call. As soon as the car passed the lift bar at the airport intersection, a middle – aged man in a suit waved at the escort car.

Song Wei gestured for the car to stop and asked through the window,””Is this manager Gu?”

“Yes!” The middle – aged man quickly replied. Yes! You’re miss song, right?”

“I am.” Song Wei smiled and said,”sorry to trouble you, manager Gu.”

“Where? I should!” Manager Gu hurriedly said,”miss song, I have already negotiated with the airport. The car can be driven directly to the cargo transfer area. I was worried that you might not be familiar with the way, so I came to help you.”

“Thank you so much,” Song Wei said.

“You’re too polite!” Manager Gu said,”miss song, you can just follow my car!”

Manager Gu waved to Song Wei and jogged to a car by the roadside.

After the car started, Song Wei asked the driver to follow.

Xia ruofei laughed and asked,”Song Wei, who’s your friend?” Isn’t this treatment a little over the top ...”
