Chapter 3524: First meeting gift (1)

Translator: 549690339

lu you replied subconsciously,”i’m fine!” he was fine! i thought senior …” xia ruofei found it funny, he chuckled.’little girl, the path of cultivation is full of hardships and dangers, why did you embark on the path of cultivation?” xia ruofei was indeed very interested in lu you’s experience in cultivation, after all, there were not many ordinary people who had cultivation talent, back then, xia ruofei did not have the ability to test if lu you was suitable for cultivation, after not seeing her for such a long time, lu you suddenly came into contact with cultivation, this really surprised xia ruofei.

lu you also didn’t expect that this senior would actually be concerned about why a small cultivator had embarked on the path of cultivation, she couldn’t help but be stunned for a moment, after that, she didn’t dare to hide anything and quickly said,””senior, while i was studying at the university of Cambridge in United Kingdom, my master discovered that i had a talent for cultivation, that’s why i entered the water element sect and began to cultivate, however, my aptitude is dull, and i’ve been in contact with the path of cultivation for a few months, but i’ve still been unable to break through to the first qi layer …” upon hearing this, xia ruofei understood, lu you should have gone to United Kingdom to study, and the water element sect had moved to england a hundred years ago. therefore, their main sphere of influence was still in europe, especially in england. it should be their traditional sphere of influence, as for how lu you’s cultivation talent was discovered, that was unknown, however, there should not be any other factors, it was probably a coincidence.

“i see!” xia ruofei said,”to be able to reach such a level in a few months, you must be very talented! little girl, it’s fate that brought us together, i’ll give you a small gift!”

as soon as xia ruofei finished speaking, lu you saw a flash of light, two items directly shattered the car window and landed firmly in her hands.

it was a crystal full of dense spiritual qi and a small booklet, on the cover were the words “water element scripture”, the ink seemed to have not dried yet.

that crystal was actually a spirit crystal, and the “water yuan scripture” was written by xia ruofei at the last minute with his spiritual power while he was at the primal realm, he had simply checked lu you’s situation and found that she was indeed suitable for cultivating water – type cultivation techniques, it was no wonder that the water yuan sect had recruited her into the sect, hence, xia ruofei had chosen a water – type cultivation technique from the inheritance information and written it on the spot, he had given it to lu you directly.

in fact, xia ruofei had also considered whether the water element sect and the water element scripture had any connection, however, he did not think too much about it. anyway, even if the water element sect had the cultivation technique of the water element scripture, he reckoned that a young cultivator like lu you who had just entered the sect would not be able to come into contact with it. hence, he had given this cultivation technique to lu you. it should still be of some help to her.

lu you looked at the spirit crystal and the water element scripture in her hands and felt a little dazed.

she never expected that not only did this senior not blame her, but he even gave her a meeting gift, what was going on?

lu you didn’t know about essence crystals, nor did she know what the water element scripture was. xia ruofei’s judgment was right, after lu you joined the sect, the water element sect didn’t pay much attention to her. they only taught her some basic techniques, so she didn’t know how precious the water element scripture was.

“thank… thank you, senior …” lu you replied in a daze.

On the other hand, Deacon Liu, who was at the side, was shocked after taking a glance. As a low-level Qi refinement cultivator from a small sect, she didn’t even have many spirit stones. She had only heard about spirit crystals from the envious elders of the sect who were at the eighth level of the Qi refinement realm. Today, she had actually seen a real spirit crystal. Moreover, that senior had casually given such a precious thing to Lu You, who had just met by chance. One had to know that this was a spirit crystal! Even the sect leader might not have it!

The other cultivation technique had the words “Water Essence Scripture” written on its cover, which made Deacon Liu’s heart shake even more. She was actually cultivating the “Water Essence Scripture,”but the” Water Essence Scripture “that she was cultivating was an incomplete one. A truly complete” Water Essence Scripture “could not be found in the entire sect. Even Shen Hu, the sect master of the ninth Qi layer, was also cultivating an incomplete” Water Essence Scripture.”

It was said that the ” water Yuan Scripture ” was an original cultivation technique of the sect’s first generation leader. This was also the origin of the name ” water Yuan sect.” Unfortunately, with the passage of time and the vicissitudes of the sea, the water Yuan sect had almost lost its inheritance several times after several disasters. The most important thing, the ” water Yuan Scripture “, was only left with fragments. Since then, it was even more difficult for the sect to continue. The previous generation leader had reached the early stage of the Golden core realm. However, after his lifespan had run out, there were no more golden core realm cultivators in the sect. In the end, Shen Hu, who was at refined Qi level 9, took over the position of sect leader.

In fact, this situation was quite common in the current cultivation world. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Many sects didn’t even have any golden core cultivators left. Some sects still had some old golden core cultivators, but they were few and far between. Now that the cultivation environment was deteriorating, it was getting more and more difficult for other cultivators to break through to the Golden core stage. There would be more and more sects like the water Yuan sect in the future.

It could be said that the water Yuan sect’s current situation was a microcosm of the decline of the entire Earth’s cultivation world.

When Deacon Liu saw the water Yuan Scripture, his eyes flickered. Could it be … That this is the complete version of the water Yuan Scripture? This senior’s strength was at least at the Golden core stage or even the nascent Soul Stage.. The cultivation technique that he gave to Lu You as a gift shouldn’t just be a fragment, right? If this was really the complete version of the water element Scripture, it would definitely be a great contribution if he were to present it to the sect!
