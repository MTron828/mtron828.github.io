“Yup! I have something to report to you!” Ma Jia said with a smile.

“Don ‘t!” Xia ruofei said,”if you have something to say, just say it. Don’t talk about reporting or not!”

“You’re the boss now, and I’m the employee. “Ma Jia laughed and said,”don’t I have to report to you?”

Xia ruofei shook his head with a bitter smile.

“It’s like this,” ma su continued.”As of yesterday, other than the few officers in lone wolf who can’t take a break for the time being, the recruited guards have all arrived. There are a total of 96 people. I’ve asked Wolf King and squad leader Xu. Other than old Liu and a few others, there are only so many people in this batch. ”

“That’s close to a hundred people. ” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”we can barely form a company! Hahaha! It should be enough for the guard team stationed on Peach Blossom Island. But we’ll still have to add some new blood in the future, so at least everyone can take turns to return home to rest!”

“This treatment is too good ...” Ma Jia said with a smile.

Then, he immediately asked,”ruofei, since everyone is here ... When do you think we should go to the Paradise Island?” My comrades can’t wait!”

The reason why the ex – soldiers wanted to get back to work as soon as possible was that Xia ruofei had been paying them according to their overseas salary since they started working. Of course, he had entrusted the Paradise corporation’s finance department to pay them on their behalf. Even the five insurances and one housing Fund for the ex – soldiers were all handled in the name of the Paradise corporation’s employees.

They were still in the country, but they were paid according to the standard of working overseas, which they had agreed on at the beginning of the month. This made the simple veterans feel a little uneasy. Only by working on peach source Island as soon as possible could they get the money in peace!

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”you guys stay on the farm and wait for orders.” He could use this time to organize everyone’s training! I’ll make arrangements as soon as possible after I’m done! By the way, Captain, is sister – in – Law here?”

“She’s done with her resignation and is rushing over. ” Ma Jia said,”he’s already at the farm!”

“Then I’ll ask Lei Hu to arrange an apartment for you!” Xia ruofei said.

“No need, no need!” Ma Jia said,”actually, living in the dormitory is quite good! Besides, we won’t be staying here for more than a few days. Aren’t we going to the Peach Blossom Island soon?”

“What do you mean?” Xia ruofei said,”even if it’s only for one night, we have to make arrangements for sister – in – Law! Tell me, how long has it been since you’ve gone home to visit your family? Sister – in – Law is already here, and you still have the cheek to stay in the shared dormitory? It’s decided! I’ll make the call in a while!”

“Alright then ...” Ma Jia said,”thank you, ruofei!”

“Is there anything else, old company commander?” Xia ruofei asked.

“Oh ... There’s one more thing!” Ma su said,”before you left, didn’t you ask me to gather everyone’s opinions and study the distribution of clothing and equipment? I’ve worked overtime these few days to come up with a first draft, and I’ve already sent it to your email. Take a look at it when you’re free and let me know if you have any suggestions. I’ll change it according to your wishes. ”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Old captain, you’re the ones who use these uniforms and equipment. Of course, you have the right to speak. Let me take a look first!” As long as it’s not difficult to get from the International firearms market, I’ll try my best to satisfy your needs!”

“Alright!” Ma Jia said with some excitement,”sure! Then I won’t disturb you any longer! Goodbye!”

After Xia ruofei hung up, he immediately found Lei Hu’s phone number and dialed it. Once the call connected, Xia ruofei said,””Hu Zi! My old company commander MA deputy’s family is here too, did you know about this?”

“Brother Xia, I know!” Lei Hu said,”I said I would arrange a separate employee apartment for them, but company commander MA declined.”

“You can go and arrange it now!” Xia ruofei said,”I’ve already told him. He won’t reject me anymore.”

“Yes!” Lei Hu replied.

“Right, get someone to clean up the place!” Xia ruofei said,”the couple is reuniting. We have to create a good environment.”

“Alright! Don’t you worry!” Lei Hu said.

“That’s it then. ” Xia ruofei said,”contact me by phone if there’s anything. In short, we must prioritize the protection of the Veterans and satisfy their reasonable requests as much as possible. Can you do that?”

“Yes, I can!” Lei Hu replied crisply.

Xia ruofei hung up and kept his phone. He looked up and saw that the car to send him back to the hotel was already parked not far away. Song Wei and Ling Qingxue did not get in the car. They stood by the car and waited. When they saw Xia ruofei looking at them, they immediately waved to him.

Xia ruofei laughed and quickened his pace towards the two of them.

On the way back, Xia ruofei opened the email from Ma Jia on his phone and browsed through it. Anyway, Song Wei and Ling Qingxue, who were sitting in the middle row, were chatting happily and did not notice what he was doing.

Xia ruofei saw that ma SU’s list of weapons and equipment was relatively reasonable. He did not take the opportunity to ask for weapons that were not very useful in the island’s defense. Even so, it would cost a lot to equip this Island guard team.

This was because the equipment and weapons listed by ma su were basically All American – style equipment, including some individual digital equipment, which were all very expensive. There were also weapons specially equipped for snipers and even large – caliber anti – Armor rifles that were specially designed to deal with armored equipment.

If they were all equipped according to this list, the guards would definitely be armed to the teeth. It would not be an exaggeration to say that such a force could occupy the entire ponatu.

Of course, good things were not cheap.

Xia ruofei roughly estimated that the equipment and quantity on the list would cost at least 20 million US dollars. In other words, it would cost an average of 200000 US dollars to equip each soldier. Moreover, this was only the price. These weapons must have been bought from the black market, so the price would be even more expensive.

However, Xia ruofei did not plan to save money. To put it bluntly, he had formed this guard team to solve the livelihood problem of the Veterans and give them a high – paying job. On the other hand, it was also to deal with some trouble that might appear in the secular world.

This batch of equipment, in addition to the heavy weapons that the Liu Clan had originally set up on the island, was enough to form a powerful deterrent force. Naturally, those thieves and Rascals would not dare to covet the Peach Blossom Island.

As for the enemies from the world of cultivation, if cultivators really found the Paradise Island, then no matter how good the equipment of the guards was, it would be of no use. Naturally, they would still have to rely on the void xuanqing formation.

After they returned to the hotel, Xia ruofei first had lunch with Ling Qingxue and Song Wei at the restaurant before the three of them went back to their rooms to rest.

After Xia ruofei returned to his room, he forwarded the email to Li Yifu and gave him a call. He asked him to purchase the equipment from the black market as soon as possible and to transport them to Paradise Island.

As for the funds, Xia ruofei transferred 25 million USD to Li Yifu’s account first because he knew that Li Yifu would definitely say that he wouldn’t take the money after he was done with the matter.

In addition, Xia ruofei also told Li Yifu to find some staff needed on the island as soon as possible, such as tower supervisors, dock managers, chefs, doctors, and so on. Of course, the premise was that they had to be absolutely reliable. Xia ruofei also screened the identity of all the people who entered Peach Garden Island.

Xia ruofei greeted Ruby. He would only train for half a day every day, and in the afternoon, he would accompany Ling Qingxue and Song Wei to visit the famous places in Barcelona.

It was the same for the next two days. Xia ruofei trained in the morning and went shopping with his girlfriend in the afternoon.

Three days passed by in a flash, and soon it was the day of the away game between Espanyol and bar?a, the Catalan derby.
