He had been away for more than 20 days, so when he returned to the yard, Blackie, lightning, fluffy one, and fluffy two immediately pounced on him. Xia ruofei also left his luggage and played with them for a while.

Seeing Da Mao, er Mao and the rest, Xia ruofei could not help but think of si Mao and Wan Wan. He had given si Mao to the police beauty Qin Xiao Yu because he had softened his heart. He wondered how si Mao was doing there.

“I need to find time to bring Blackie and the rest to visit si Mao ...” Xia ruofei thought to himself.

After playing for a while, Xia ruofei waved his hand to let Blackie and the rest go back to their nests. He then pushed the luggage into the house.

Hu ‘Zi’s mother had heard the commotion in the courtyard and had already come out to welcome them.

“RUO Fei, Qiao’ er, you’re back!” Hu ‘er’s mother greeted her happily.

“Godmother!” Xia ruofei called out with a smile.

This was the first time Lin Qiao had been away from her mother for such a long time. After seeing her mother, her depressed mood was temporarily relieved, and she finally smiled.

Hu Zi’s mother welcomed the two of them into the living room and then held Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao’s hands to show her concern.

“Qiao’ er, you seem to have gotten tanned!” Hu Zi’s mother asked,”is the sun very strong in Australia?”

Lin Qiao smiled and said,”it’s still winter in Australia!” But the weather’s fine, it’s not too hot or too cold, and the ultraviolet rays outside are quite strong!”

“You must be out every day ...” Hu ‘Zi’s mother rebuked.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”godmother!” Of course, he had to take a look around when he was traveling! What’s the point of staying in the hotel every day?”

“That’s right! They might as well live on the farm! The environment here is so good!” Lin Qiao also smiled and said,”but speaking of farms, brother ruofei’s farm in Australia has a better environment! And the Super big ones were as big as two or three hundred Taoyuan farms, with no end in sight! If you have the chance, you must go and take a look ...”

Then, Lin Qiao talked about some of her experiences in Australia, especially about getting to know the big star Jennifer.

However, Xia ruofei had warned Lin Qiao in advance that she would not tell him anything about cultivation.

During the trip to Australia, Lin Qiao more or less knew that Xia ruofei was different from ordinary people, especially in terms of cultivation. Xia ruofei had even taken Tang Haoran as his disciple. He did not hide this from Lin Qiao, but Xia ruofei had also specifically told Lin Qiao not to publicize anything related to cultivation.

Lin Qiao still listened to Xia ruofei’s words. She didn’t even tell her mother.

Xia ruofei saw that the mother and daughter were chatting happily, so he greeted them and went upstairs to his room.

……

Crescent Lake, the villa area of the municipal Committee.

The San Shan Municipal Party Committee Secretary, song Qiming, and his family were sitting on the sofa in the living room. Song Qiming’s wife, Fang Liyun, poured some tea for song Qiming and said,””Old song, there’s no indicator for Weiwei’s illness. I wonder how the treatment is going ... Why did Dr. Xia leave the country at this time? What if Wei Wei ...”

The last time Xia ruofei came, he had prepared 15 pills for Song Wei. It was enough for her to take for half a month.

He didn’t have a specific plan to bring Lin Qiao to Australia, so he didn’t expect that he would be away for nearly 20 days. Therefore, he didn’t send song Qiming the pills for the next course of treatment.

Song Qiming called Xia ruofei after Song Wei had finished her medication. However, Xia ruofei was still in Australia at that time, so Song Wei’s treatment was suspended.

Song Qiming frowned slightly and said,”it’s Xia’s freedom to go abroad!” Is he not allowed to leave the country just because he has to treat Weiwei?”

Fang Liyun rolled her eyes at song Qiming and said,”You know I didn’t mean it that way! Isn’t this ...”

“Liyun, stop worrying about it!” Song Qiming said,”Xiao Xia was strongly recommended by the old chief. I have absolute trust in Him. He also said on the phone that it’s best to stop taking the medicine for a few days after the treatment so that the body can adapt. After all, medicine is 30% poisonous!”

Song Qiming did not know that this was actually an excuse Xia ruofei had made up after he realized his own negligence.

Of course, it was just a white lie. At least after Xia ruofei told him, song Qiming felt much more at ease.

At this time, Song Wei also said,””Mom, I think dad is right. At least, I’ve never fainted in the past 20 days. This means that the early treatment was effective!” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Fang Liyun sighed and said,”I’m confident in Dr. Xia’s medical skills, but the poison in Weiwei is too strange. She’s no different from a normal person when she doesn’t act up, but once she does, she’ll faint without any signs. She’s like a time bomb.” Besides, there’s no clear way to detect it now, so we don’t know if it’s good or not!”

Song Wei’s face darkened. She agreed with her mother.

Over the years, everyone had gotten used to Western Medicine’s testing methods. Whether there was an illness or not, whether the illness was cured or not, they could directly go through blood tests, live examinations, X – rays, CT scans, MRI scans, and so on. Everything was clear at a glance.

There was no way to detect the poison. Although Xia ruofei said that he could find out the condition of the poison by taking the pulse, as a patient, he had no idea at all. It seemed that he could only be completely at ease when he saw the normal test report.

However, the poison could not be tested.

Song Qiming said in a deep voice,”don’t worry. Xiao Xia will be back in a day or two. Let him check on Weiwei first and see how the treatment is going.” In fact, it doesn’t matter if we understand the situation of the poison, as long as Xiao Xia knows what she’s doing!”

At this point, song Qiming paused for a moment before he continued,””There’s also news from Beijing that a research group in 301 Hospital has been conducting in – depth research on the patient’s blood samples. I heard that they made some discoveries recently. There might be new progress soon!”

“Oh, really? Why didn’t you mention it to us?” Fang Liyun’s eyes lit up as she asked.

“I also received the call when I was about to get off work, but I didn’t have the time to tell you,” Song Qiming said,”and there’s no result yet! What’s the point of telling you?”

“Dad, if Room 301 can find this poison, do you think they’ll find a way to treat it?” Song Wei could not help but ask.

“It’s hard to say now!” Song Qiming said,”we don’t even know if we can find the poison! Even if the toxin is discovered, it’ll take a long time to analyze its pathogenic mechanism and make a targeted treatment ...”

Song Wei nodded her head heavily. She was not worried about her own safety. She had a natural trust in Xia ruofei. Since Xia ruofei said that he could cure her, she was not worried at all.

Even if he was a little anxious, it was because he did not have a clear idea of what to do, as there were no specific indicators.

Song Wei’s heavy heart was mostly for her teammate who was in a deep coma in Beijing.

His condition was more serious than Song Wei’s to begin with. It seemed like the chances of him being cured by the experts were slim.

Song Wei had thought of asking Xia ruofei for help, but she couldn’t bring herself to do so. After all, Xia ruofei treated her because of elder song. Besides, the pill seemed to be very precious. Song Wei was even more embarrassed to ask Xia ruofei for help.

The family in the living room fell into a brief silence. At that moment, song Qiming’s phone on the coffee table suddenly rang.

Song Qiming picked it up and glanced at it. Then, he looked at his wife and daughter and said,””It’s from Beijing. My friend at 301 Hospital ...”
