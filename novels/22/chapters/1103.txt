Chapter 1104: Meeting miss Lu by chance (2)

Translator: 549690339

Seeing that Xia ruofei did not greet anyone after sitting down and was instead chatting enthusiastically with Lu You, the marriage partner of song Rui, as if no one was around, the young people at the table suddenly felt a little bored.

One of them was a young man with shiny hair and was wearing an Armani shirt. He glanced at Xia ruofei and asked,””Brother, you look a little unfamiliar! Show everyone your name!”

Xia ruofei looked at him indifferently and said with a smile,””I’m Xia ruofei. ”

“Xia?” The young man mumbled to himself,”I don’t think there’s any leader with the surname Xia who has been transferred to Beijing recently ... Could he be from the local government? Which province had a leader with the surname Xia? Let’s help him think, this brother is quite mysterious!”

Song Rui couldn’t help but laugh. He said,””Liu Jian, don’t think too much. You won’t be able to guess it even if you spend your entire life guessing! RUO Fei’s parents are no longer around ...”

The young man named Liu Jian’s face couldn’t help but change slightly. He said,”Could it be that brother ruofei’s grandfather is ...”

Song Rui’s words made Liu Jian misunderstand. Since ran ran’s parents were no longer around and she was so close to song Rui, she must have a very prominent grandfather’s generation.

Coincidentally, there was indeed an old chief with the surname Xia. Before his retirement, his position was slightly lower than elder song, but he was definitely a heavyweight leader. Moreover, this chief Xia really had a son who died of illness in his forties.

Hence, when song Rui said that, Liu Jian immediately thought of chief Xia.

Not only did Liu Jian misunderstand, but many young people at the table also thought that Xia ruofei was chief Xia’s grandson. They immediately stopped looking down on him.

Song Rui couldn’t help but laugh and said,””You guys ... I’ll tell you! RUO Fei doesn’t have any relationship with Xia Mingjun’s grandfather, so don’t make wild guesses. RUO Fei isn’t from our circle ...”

“Ah?” Liu Jian couldn’t help but cry out.

Song Rui had made it clear that Xia ruofei was not in their circle. He also said that Xia ruofei’s parents were no longer alive. It was impossible for her to sit at the same table as them because of her parents ‘status.

In other words, Xia ruofei might just be a commoner.

However, he was able to attend elder song’s birthday banquet, and even the eldest grandson of the song family’s third generation, song Rui, was so familiar with him. All of this seemed so unbelievable, but it really happened in front of them.

Liu Jian laughed drily and looked at Xia ruofei.”Bro, don’t keep us in suspense. Tell us what you do for a living ... We’re all very curious!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Young master Liu, I was in the military for a few years. After I left the military, I started a small company in the southeast province.”

Liu Jian was still listening, but he realized that Xia ruofei had shut up.

“That’s all?”asked Liu Jian after being stunned for a moment.

Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”that’s all ...”

“Alright then!” Liu Jian nodded helplessly. He exchanged glances with the young men beside him and stopped pestering Xia ruofei.

However, they couldn’t help but look down on Xia ruofei. Although Xia ruofei looked mysterious, from Liu Jian’s probing, they knew that Xia ruofei didn’t have any background. Perhaps he had a good relationship with song Rui, so he just happened to be there.

Although it seemed a little unreasonable for song Rui’s good friend to attend elder song’s birthday banquet, these people didn’t think too much about the young scions of the aristocratic families. It had become a habit to compare the status of the other party’s family elders when interacting with people. Basically, their status in the circle was proportional to the status of their parents.

Hence, after confirming that Xia ruofei was not the child of some big leader, they lost interest in him.

However, the eyes of a young man in a Tang suit sitting beside Song Wei lit up after hearing Xia ruofei’s introduction.

Although he was called a “young man,” he still looked a little old with his dark skin and a face full of stubble.

He grinned at Xia ruofei and said forthrightly,””Brother, you’ve been in the Army before! Then we’ll have to drink more later!”

Song Rui said to Xia ruofei,”ruofei, this is Zhao Yongjun, brother Zhao. His father is uncle Zhao Cheng from the capital city’s military!” He was a soldier before. ”

Zhao Yongjun chuckled.”My father wanted me to take over his career. Unfortunately, I’m not cut out for it. I retired after five years in the military!” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Xia ruofei had always had a good impression of soldiers. In addition, he had treated Zhao Cheng’s diabetes before and had even obtained a realm stone from Zhao Cheng’s house. Hence, he was naturally closer to Zhao Yongjun than the other young people.

Xia ruofei smiled at Zhao Yongjun and said,””Then I’ll have to call brother Zhao old class monitor! I’ll definitely give you a few more toasts later!”

“Hahaha! No problem!” Zhao Yongjun said straightforwardly.

Xia ruofei had a close relationship with the song family, but most of the third generation of the song family had not yet reached the core of the family’s decision – making circle. Song Rui was the only one who knew about Xia ruofei’s relationship with elder song.

As for the younger generation of the leaders outside the song family, it was impossible for them to understand the relationship between Xia ruofei and the song family.

Even Zhao Yongjun didn’t know that Xia ruofei had cured his father’s diabetes and saved his father’s career.

So the young people at this table, including some of the song family’s descendants, saw Zhao Yongjun and a grassroots boss chatting so passionately, they all felt a little disapproving.

They were all chatting and their attitude towards Xia ruofei was neither warm nor cold.

These rich men’s topics were nothing more than luxury cars, women, and so on. Xia ruofei was not interested in them, so he took a sip of red wine from time to time and chatted with song Rui and Lu You.

Not long after, footsteps were heard. Everyone looked up and saw a group of people escorting elder song into the small banquet hall.

The people who came in were all the elders of this table of young people, and among them was the extremely prominent elder song, so everyone immediately stopped chatting. The other tables were the same, and the banquet hall suddenly became quiet.

The birthday boy, elder song, was in a good mood. He was usually serious, but today, he had a smile on his face. After walking to the main seat, he said,”Thank you, director Zhongyang, for your concern and well wishes. Thank you, director Zhang, for coming personally despite your busy schedule!”

A slightly balding leader at the main table quickly said,””You’re too kind, chief. The central government’s director and Lin Zhi were supposed to come in person, but you’ve informed them two months in advance, so they sent me as a representative. I wish the old chief good fortune and longevity!”

Director Zhang was the director of the central government’s criminal investigation office, a true Deputy of the national level. He was also the chief butler of the central government. His appearance naturally represented the attitude of the current leadership.

The people of the song family were very excited and proud. As long as elder song was healthy and alive, the song family would definitely be able to prosper. And those leaders who were close to the song family today were naturally even more determined in their stand.

“Director Zhang, you’re welcome. Please have a seat!” Elder song said with a smile.

Then, he looked around and said,””Thank you, everyone, for coming to celebrate my birthday with me. Everyone here is family, so don’t feel restrained. Just eat and drink well ...”

Elder song’s eyes stopped on Xia ruofei. He smiled and said,”Xiao Xia, why did you go to Xiao Rui’s table? Come over, come over and sit with us!”

As soon as elder song finished his words, the whole place fell silent. The young people at Xia ruofei’s table opened their mouths wide and looked at Xia ruofei in shock. They were all dumbfounded.
