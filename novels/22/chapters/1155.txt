Chapter 1156: A family of property owners in the capital (3)

Translator: 549690339

It was already past FiveO’ clock in the morning. Naturally, Xia ruofei could not cultivate anymore. He took a short break and went downstairs for breakfast.

In the morning, Zhao Yongjun brought Xia ruofei to the courtyard house in liuhai Lane.

Wu shuheng had already found a notary and entrusted the transfer of ownership to Zhao Yongjun.

After receiving the notary certificate, Zhao Yongjun and Xia ruofei officially accepted the courtyard house that used to be in bei le mansion.

Wu shuheng had given all the household appliances, furniture, and other facilities in the house to Xia ruofei. He only took some decorations from his personal collection and some clothes that he had left in the yard. They only filled half a pickup truck.

Then, Wu shuheng bid farewell to Zhao Yongjun and Xia ruofei.

He still had two houses in the capital, but they were both in small communities. Although the area was also very large, compared to this courtyard house, the total price was probably only a fraction. So he didn’t sell the two houses this time, because the money from selling the houses was like a drop in the bucket for his overseas company’s lack of funds. It wouldn’t help at all.

Wu shuheng moved these personal belongings to his other house to store them, and then he was ready to return to the United States.

His company in the United States was in urgent need of funds to revive, so he was also eager to return home. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

After Wu shuheng left, Xia ruofei didn’t have time to take a good look at the yard. Zhao Yongjun took him directly to the housing management Center to handle the transfer procedures.

Zhao Yongjun had already informed his friend in advance. He also had the notarized power of attorney signed by Wu shuheng, Xia ruofei’s house purchase contract, money transfer receipt, Wu shuheng’s property certificate, Land certificate, and other information in his hands. So, it was very easy to transfer the ownership.

Of course, according to normal procedures, even if he didn’t apply for a mortgage, it was impossible to complete all the procedures on the same day.

However, Zhao Yongjun’s appearance was a special case. The two of them only spent half a day and the entire transfer process was completed. Xia ruofei also got the new house and land certificate under his name.

From this moment on, this super luxurious mansion that was worth more than 100 million Yuan officially belonged to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei had also become a family with a house in the capital, and it was a huge courtyard with three entrances.

Zhao Yongjun was very meticulous. After the transfer of ownership was completed, he brought Xia ruofei to transfer the water, electricity, heating, gas, and other bills under Xia ruofei’s name.

On the first floor of the housing management Center, there were people from the electricity company, gas company, Broadcasting Company, and other units stationed there. It was very convenient as long as they went to the counters one by one.

After settling everything, the two of them had a casual lunch outside before returning to the liuhai Lane courtyard house.

“RUO Fei, take a good look and see if there’s anything that you don’t like that needs to be modified.” Zhao Yongjun smiled and said,”I’ll arrange for a friend to come over and help you fix it. He’s a specialist in ancient building restoration. I guarantee that he’ll help you do it beautifully!”

In fact, Xia ruofei had already thought of a few places that needed to be changed. He immediately smiled and said,””That’s great! I was just worried that I couldn’t find a professional to do this! As for the place to change, I’ve already thought about it last night! If your friend is studying the restoration of ancient buildings, it shouldn’t be difficult for him!”

“Oh?” Zhao Yongjun was also interested and said with a smile,””Tell me about it, maybe I can give you some advice! Although I’m in the antique field, I’ve also done some research on Ming and Qing Dynasty architecture!”
