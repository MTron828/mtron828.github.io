Chapter 1727: What a big battle formation_1

Old West was grinning from ear to ear when he saw the entire colony of bacteria – infected half – City. His eyes were so squinted that they almost formed a line. However, when he heard Xia ruofei’s words, his smile froze and was replaced by a pained expression.

“Xia, if you want to try making your own wine, just use the ordinary grapes from our winery,” Old West said after a while.”These expensive rotten grapes are too rare and precious ...”

Xia ruofei shrugged and said with a smile,””Uncle Wester, such a large area of grapes has been infected with noble mold, it’s quite a lot! Besides, I didn’t ask for much, just one bucket!”

One bucket! It’s just that!

Old West regretted bringing Xia ruofei to Golden Oak winery. He could only blame himself for not being able to keep his cool and rushing over as soon as he heard the news. If he had been calmer and given Xia ruofei two barrels of clear grape juice to send him away, then he would have come over quietly. Everything would have been fine.

Now, the God of plague had followed him to the Golden Oak winery, and he had his eyes on these expensive rotten grapes! Moreover, the other party was the boss, and he had no way to refuse! Old West was filled with regret.

Feng Rao saw Old West’s expression and couldn’t help but feel sorry for him. She quietly pulled on Xia ruofei’s sleeve and said,””Ruofei, let’s just forget it! Even Uncle Wester’s heart aches for him ...”

“Sister che, I’m not fooling around when I asked for grape juice. It’s really useful!” Xia ruofei said in a low voice.

“Alright,” Feng Rao said helplessly. Then I won’t try to persuade you ... But you should still try to persuade uncle Wester! I’m afraid he’ll force us to go on strike ...”

After speaking, Feng Jing couldn’t help but cover her mouth and laugh.

Xia ruofei looked at Old West and found it funny. He walked over and said,””Uncle Wester, I have a friend who specializes in white wine – making, and I want these two barrels of grape juice for him. Who knows, they might be able to help us develop even better wine, so...You have to cooperate with me this time no matter what, and give me the best clear grape juice!”

Old West felt his heart ache. All of this belonged to Xia ruofei. No matter what he did, it would not be a loss to Old West. In a way, this was a display of his strong sense of responsibility.

Now that he saw Xia ruofei explaining to him so patiently as the boss, he quickly thought it through.

Although he was still a little reluctant, Old West still said,””Good! Xia, I’ll prepare the best clear grape juice for you. However, these liquids have high temperature and environmental requirements, so you have to send them to your friend as soon as possible after you get them, otherwise they will go bad easily!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”don’t worry!” My friend is in Australia, I’ll send him over as soon as possible!”

......

Xia ruofei and Feng Jing stayed in Australia for another three days before they boarded the flight back home.

The main reason was that each of the noble rotten grapes had to be manually selected, and the grapes had very little water content. To gather a bucket of clear grape juice, the consumption was several times that of ordinary grapes, which was why it had been delayed for so many days.

Before they left, Xia ruofei even asked sutteny to visit Captain Brook. He was recovering well. Although he had to go through a series of tests and psychological tests after a hundred days of recovery, he was still able to return to his flight post after such a disaster. Brook was already very satisfied.

The special honored passenger diamond card that was specially made for Xia ruofei by the Australian Airlines was sent to Xia ruofei by the staff. At the same time, the two million Australian dollars prize money had been transferred to Xia ruofei’s account.

Xia ruofei immediately transferred 500000 Australian dollars to the West winery’s account and asked old Wester to hire more workers. At the same time, he also gave everyone bonuses.

Xia ruofei transferred the remaining 1.5 million Australian dollars to his overseas company account.

To Xia ruofei’s slight regret, the Airbus A350 was still under repair and the new paint coating was being designed. Hence, he did not see the vegetable and fruit – themed paint coating of the plane before he left.

However, Tony also said that he would invite Xia ruofei to board the plane when it took its first flight after it was repaired, and Xia ruofei gladly agreed to it.

There were two barrels of clear liquid of the grape juice. One of them was ordinary Semillon grape juice, while the other was grape juice that had been infected with noble fungus. Old West kept his word and personally processed the two barrels of clear liquid before handing them to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei immediately loaded them onto the winery’s pickup truck and transported them to his ‘friend’.

Of course, Xia ruofei was actually driving to a deserted place and storing the two buckets of grape juice into the spirit map space. Australia was vast but sparsely populated, so it was easy to find such a place.

Then, he wandered outside for half a day before finally returning to the West Winery. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Old West was still very concerned about the two barrels of clear grape juice. When he heard that Xia ruofei had given them to a friend and placed them in a warm environment, he was relieved.

Since Xia ruofei did not have the time to process the clear liquids of the grape juices back in Australia, he decided to place them in the mountain and sea realm where time flowed at the same rate as the outside world. He also used the invisible power of space to create a barrier to prevent them from being destroyed by any accidents, such as the White boundary Fox. Fortunately, they still needed to be fermented in oak barrels for some time, especially for the noble decay wine.
