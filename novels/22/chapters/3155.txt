Chapter 1724: the great Tang!

“What do you think ...” Shen Heping said weakly.

“As a scholar, you should be more pure and focus on scientific research.” Wang Chi said,”there are some things and some people that you and I can’t get involved in! I don’t want to see you regret it, and I don’t want Beijing University Computer Science Department to be implicated because of you ...”

“Teacher, I don’t quite understand ...” Shen Heping said in confusion.

Wang Chi gave Shen Heping a meaningful look and said,””I’m afraid you don’t want to understand! I’ll just get straight to the point! Whether it’s song Rui or Xia ruofei, or even song Wei, you can’t afford to offend them. Besides, you’re in the wrong this time, so I advise you to put away any thoughts of revenge, especially those against Song Wei. Otherwise, you’ll probably get yourself killed!”

At this point, Wang Chi stared deeply at Shen Heping and said, word by word,”I can’t even protect you!”

Shen Heping’s eyes finally revealed a trace of fear as he said,””How ... How is this possible? Teacher, you ...”

“That’s all I can say, you can decide for yourself!” Wang Chi said,”hurry back to the station now. We’ll start the reform today!”

Shen Heping’s body trembled and he quickly replied,”I know, teacher ...”

Wang Chi said lightly,”Oh right, in the future, you can still call me professor Wang, academician Wang, or director Wang in front of others!” After all, I’ve never really taught your class or guided you on your thesis, so it’s not appropriate to call me teacher. ”

Shen Heping’s heart turned cold, and his eyes revealed a look of regret. He lowered his head and said,”Yes, I know ...” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Xia ruofei was waiting outside the door. Of course, he did not eavesdrop on the conversation between Wang Chi and Shen Heping.

Seeing the door open and Wang Chi and Shen Heping walk out, Xia ruofei stepped forward to welcome them.

Wang Chi said to Xia ruofei,”Mr. Xia, I’ve talked to Shen. The research project will start to change today. We will completely remove and replace the relevant content.”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.”Thank you, academician Wang.”

“I’ve already asked Shen to rush back to the Computer Science Institute. ” Wang Chi said,”he definitely won’t go to the venue to cause trouble again. President Xia, do you think ... You can let him leave now?”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Of course! I’ll send a car to drop off Associate Professor Shen!”

“Then I’ll have to trouble you!” Wang Chi said.

Wang Chi and the others were picked up by the car sent by Tao Yuan club. If they didn’t have a car, it would be difficult to get a taxi in this suburban area!

“You’re too polite!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Then, he gave a few instructions to the security guards, asking them to coordinate the convoy to send a car over to send Shen Heping.

Wang Chi saw that Xia ruofei had made all the necessary arrangements and said,””President Xia, let’s go back to the meeting room! Don’t let little Guo, little li, and the others wait too long!”

“Okay, academician Wang, this way please!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Shen Heping was led downstairs by the security guard to wait for the car, while Xia ruofei and Wang Chi took the stairs to the meeting room on the second floor.

Everyone turned to look at Xia ruofei and Wang Chi.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’m sorry for taking up everyone’s time. Let’s continue!” Let’s welcome academician Wang to give the main speech!”

The staff had already restored the projector, projection screen, and microphone. Wang Chi’s PhD student, Feng Xiaoyi, who didn’t have much of a presence, went up to adjust everything first. Wang Chi then got up and walked onto the stage.

Feng Xiaoyi sat down and used the remote control to help Wang Chi turn the pages. Wang Chi only needed to speak.

Before Wang Chi started his speech, Xia ruofei sat down and whispered into Song Wei’s ear,””That matter has been resolved. Shen Heping will go back today to rectify it. All elements that involve you will be removed from this project.”

“Yeah!” Song Wei nodded. With you around, I’m very assured ...”

Xia ruofei grinned.”Actually, I don’t need to do it. If you want to deal with him, you can do it with a word.”

Whether it was in terms of family background or personal strength, Song Wei could crush Shen Heping.

Even if she didn’t use her family connections to deal with Shen Heping, as a cultivator, Song Wei had many ways to make Shen Heping disappear forever, and she wouldn’t leave any evidence.

Of course, Song Wei would not be so crazy. After all, things had not reached that stage yet.

On the stage, Wang Chi had already started his speech. Xia ruofei also sat up straight and listened carefully.

Wang Chi’s ranking was much higher than Guo Qian and Li Yufu ‘s, and he was the finale of the day. Hence, Xia ruofei and Chen Xuan were looking forward to his speech.

Of course, Wang Chi did not disappoint them.

The content of his speech was also very consistent with the theme. It had always been centered around several supercomputer projects and analyzed from specific application examples.

The content of Wang Chi’s speech was similar to Guo Qian and Li Yufu ‘s, but an academician was an academician. The resources of the Beijing University of Computer Science and Technology Research Institute were obviously better than the capital University of posts and communications and the capital University of Aeronautics and Astronautics. Therefore, Wang Chi’s speech was more substantial. Xia ruofei and Chen Xuan felt like their thirst had been quenched.

The two of them listened very seriously and took notes almost non – stop.

Wang Chi’s speech lasted for almost an hour. When his PowerPoint reached the last page, Xia ruofei was the first to stand up and applaud. Everyone else followed suit.
