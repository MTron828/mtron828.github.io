At this moment, elonmask’s phone rang ...

The three of them stopped their discussion, and Elon Musk picked up the call. His voice was gentle as he said,””My dear, how is little X ... Okay! Alright! We’re coming over now!”

After hanging up the phone, Elon Musk said to Xia ruofei,””Mr. Xia, grams said that it’s about time.”

Xia ruofei looked at his watch and smiled.””Mm! He could keep the needles. Let’s go!”

The three of them got up and went to the next room.

The nurse and the nanny were still waiting in the corridor and were not allowed to enter the room.

Grams stayed by the crib the whole time, and little X was still lying on his side, still in a sweet dream.

When he saw Xia ruofei, he immediately stood up and went forward.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you can take the needles back now.”

Then, he came to the crib and used his mental power to check on little X’s condition. Then, he quickly put away the silver needles. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

From the perspective of Elon Musk and the others, Xia ruofei’s action of withdrawing the needles was very fast. But in fact, they did not know that the process of withdrawing the needles was also very particular. There was no mistake in which needle was collected first and which one was collected later. There were also subtle differences in the technique.

It was just that there was no one there who knew what was going on, and Xia ruofei naturally would not be so free as to explain it to Elon Musk and the others.

After Xia ruofei kept the silver needles, he removed the pillow under little X’s body so that he could lie on his back. Then, he calmly disinfected the silver needles and closed the first aid box.

Xia ruofei sat in front of the crib and placed his finger on little X’s pulse. After taking it carefully, he stood up and said,””The effect should be pretty good. If you take acupuncture once a day and three times, your condition will improve significantly within a week. After that, you don’t need to continue with acupuncture, but you still need to take Chinese medicine. It will take about a month for you to be completely cured. ”

Elonmask and gramus were overjoyed. Although this was just Xia ruofei’s personal statement, Xia ruofei’s previous series of magical performances had given them great confidence, and it finally ignited a burning fire of hope in their hearts.

“I may have to trouble Mr. Masker to prepare a room for me.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’ll be staying here for the next week to focus on little X’s treatment!”

“Of course, no problem!” Elonmask said in surprise. Mr. Xia can stay for as long as he wants! If you like it, I can give this small Manor to Mr. Xia ...”

“There’s no need for that. ” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I heard that this Manor is Mr. Masker’s favorite environmentally friendly residence. We Chinese have a saying that a gentleman does not take what others like. Besides, I will not stay in the United States often. Real estate is meaningless to me.”

Li Yifu also smiled and said,”Mr. Masker, it’s very easy for Mr. Xia to accumulate wealth. It’s just that he’s a person who is indifferent to fame and fortune. He has no interest in money, real estate, and the like.”

Elon Musk also came back to his senses. With Xia ruofei’s magical medical skills, it would be too easy if he wanted to make money. A mansion worth more than 20 million US dollars might not be enough for an average person to earn in their entire life. However, for a medical expert like Xia ruofei, it was just a matter of a few house visits.

After all, the richer a person was, the more afraid they were of death, and the more willing they were to use money to exchange for life and health.

Li Yifu continued,”Mr. Xia, Mr. Masker, I won’t stay here any longer. There are still many things waiting for me to deal with. Let’s keep in touch!”

Elon Musk naturally knew what Li Yifu was busy with. It was nothing more than raising funds and some follow – up preparations. After all, such a large number of sensitive goods, the security issue was still very Chinese medicine.

“Alright!” He quickly replied. Alright! Mr. Li, I’ll arrange for a car to send you there!”
