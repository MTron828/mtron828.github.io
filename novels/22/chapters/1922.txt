“Another message!” Liu Dong said.

“Let me see!” Da Liu took the phone from Liu Dong’s hand and read it out loud,”on the top of the fire hydrant on the left...There’s a black box. Take it ...”

“What the hell is going on!” Da Liu couldn’t help but complain.

Although he was complaining, he still had to follow the other party’s instructions.

Soon, they came to the fire hydrant on the left side. Da Liu walked over and groped over the top of the fire hydrant box. He found a black box.

“There’s really something!” “Let’s see what it is!” Da Liu said.

The box was opened, and there was a piece of device slightly larger than a business card inside. One side of the device had a faint ring shadow under the shell.

“What’s this for?” Da Liu couldn’t help but ask,”have you met him before?”

Liu Dong and Liu DA’s underlings all shook their heads. They had no idea what this was.

At this moment,’justice is not absent’ sent another message. Alright, now that you’ve got the item, you can continue to climb the stairs. This time, you’ll go directly to the 17th floor!

After seeing the message, Da Liu couldn’t help but wail,””It’s really tiring!”

Liu Dong said, a little embarrassed,””Xiao da, I’m sorry ... Because of my matter, you and the brothers have all been tired ...”

“We’re family, so don’t say these polite words!”Da Liu waved his hand. Let’s go! Continue to climb the stairs ...”

The group of people climbed up the stairs, while Xu Yougang focused his attention on the surveillance screen.

When Liu haojun entered the room, he had already pulled Fang Chenchen to have sex with him. Now, the two of them were eating at the dining table.

Xu Yougang believed that with Liu haojun’s personality, he would definitely have sex with Fang Chenchen again after he was done eating, even if he was not as strong as he used to be.

On the other hand, Liu Dong and the others finally reached the seventeenth floor. They were exhausted and sat down on the stairs, gasping for breath and chatting softly.

Justice wasn’t absent’s next order had yet to arrive. Liu Dong anxiously sent him a lot of WeChat messages, but justice wasn’t absent seemed to have disconnected, and there was no reply.

Da Liu didn’t have the energy to curse justice is not absent this time. After climbing 17 floors, he was exhausted. He just wanted to go back early, take a hot shower, and then sleep until the end of the day ...

He waited for nearly 20 minutes. Just as Liu Dong was getting anxious and impatient, justice is not absent finally sent a message. To the 19th floor!

Da Liu, who saw the message, was also unhappy. He climbed the stairs again! He had probably climbed more stairs today than he had in the past half a year. Now, he felt like puking at the sight of the steps ...

Under Xu Yougang’s constant guidance, the group finally reached the 19th floor.

On the surveillance screen, he saw Fang Chenchen and Liu haojun kissing each other passionately as they walked towards the bedroom.

Liu haojun was obviously very anxious. Fang Chenchen was still wearing an apron! She was carried up by him.

Xu Yougang saw that the two were already entangled in the bed in the bedroom, so he sent a WeChat message to Liu Dong.”They were in unit 1902! However, I advise you not to knock on the door. Take out the things I left on the eighth floor first ...

“What’s this?” Da Liu took out the card – like electronic device from his pocket.”What can this do?” I think it’s too small to even smash a door!”
