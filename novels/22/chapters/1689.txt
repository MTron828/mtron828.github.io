Chapter 1690: Hello, lady boss (2)

Xia ruofei snorted and said,”then I’ll ask Mr. Tang to send a professional manager!” When that time comes, you’ll be separated from Daphne ...”

“Don ‘t! Don’ t! President Xia! Brother Xia! Master Xia! “I won’t do it again ...” Liang Qichao quickly smiled and begged for mercy.

“I’ll give a toast to CEO Feng later!” Xia ruofei said,”girls are thin – skinned, you can’t make such jokes!”

“I’m just helping you with your matchmaking,”Liang Qichao mumbled.

“What did you just say?” Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows and glared at Liang Qichao.

Liang Qichao quickly waved his hand and said,”it’s nothing!” It was nothing! I’m saying that I’ll definitely give you a toast!”

Xia ruofei reached out his finger and pointed at Liang Qichao, then walked in front of him.

In fact, Xia ruofei had heard it, but this kind of thing was meant to be a joke, so it was enough to stop there.

They walked into the villa, and Liang Qichao said,””President Xia, President Feng, please leave your luggage in the living room! I’ll arrange your rooms after dinner! Let’s eat first, you guys must be starving!”

After that, Liang Qichao eagerly led everyone to the dining room on the first floor of the villa.

The dinner that Old West and his wife prepared was very sumptuous. There was a very distinctive queenshire pie, vanilla grilled fish steak, deep – Fried Crab Sticks, and of course, the couple’s carefully prepared desserts, including Old West’s personally made apple pie.

Other than that, there was also a roasted suckling pig that was tender on the inside and crispy on the outside. It was paired with a flavorful sweet sauce that was personally prepared by Capella. Just looking at it would make one’s appetite rise.

Xia ruofei and Feng Rao were already famished, so they immediately gobbled up the food after sitting down. They ate two big pieces of roasted suckling pig. Xia ruofei was full of praise for this delicacy, especially the crispy skin that was cooked just right. Xia ruofei ate it with great relish. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“It’s delicious!”Xia ruofei gave him a thumbs up.

Auntie caitley was very happy and said,””If you like it, eat more!”

The food that she had cooked was being appreciated, and aunt kabeli was genuinely happy. She kept persuading the two of them to eat more. Xia ruofei couldn’t help but think of the time when they ate at Hu Zi’s mother’s house. On this point, the elders ‘feelings had no boundaries.

After they were half – Full, Xia ruofei and Feng Jing finally had the time to taste the wine that Old West had brought.

This was a Semillon from the West Winery. It had been around for a long time and had a rich fragrance. Although it could not be compared to the Semillon that Xia ruofei had kept in his storage space, it was definitely of the best quality.

In fact, this was Old West’s precious half – llon, and he usually didn’t even dare to drink it.

“Xia, we all saw the news,” Old West said with a smile.”The Australian TV station reported that the flight you were on had deviated at the first moment. At that time, Capella and I were very worried! Fortunately, he was safe in the end!”

She gave Xia ruofei a thumbs up and said,””Child, you’re amazing! Now, many people in Australia know you. Everyone says you’re a Big Hero!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I was forced to do that. If I didn’t stand up, I would’ve lost my life!” I’m lucky!”

He had been surrounded by the news of the urgent landing for the past few days, so he didn’t want to talk about it anymore. He directly changed the topic and said,””By the way, I stayed in Saipan for two days. Will the winery be delayed?”

“We’ve been picking grapes for the past two days,” Old West said.”There’s plenty of rainfall in Australia this season. If the grapes aren’t picked in time when they’re ripe, they’ll rot easily.”

Xia ruofei nodded.”It’s good that the progress is normal. I was worried that things would be delayed because I didn’t arrive in time.”

Old West laughed heartily and said,””Don’t worry! I’ll control the entire process and won’t wait for you to arrive in Australia before starting the harvesting work!”

“Right, we’re going to start making wine tomorrow!” Old West continued,”boss, you just happened to make it! It would be such a pity if we miss out on this meaningful customer!”

“Then I’ll go to the winery tomorrow!” Xia ruofei said,”didn’t you travel thousands of miles just for this?”

After dinner, Old West and his wife happily accepted Xia ruofei’s small gifts from China, the peach Garden Da Hong Pao and the Jade skin cream. Then, they said goodbye and left.

They knew that Xia ruofei was tired from the journey and should be allowed to rest early.

Liang Qichao had been keeping the master bedroom for Feng Jing this time. Xia ruofei had chosen another guest room on the second floor.

After chatting for a while, everyone went back to their rooms to take a shower and rest. Xia ruofei did not even let Liang Qichao report the situation at Paradise Farm in detail. Everything could be discussed tomorrow.

The next morning, Xia ruofei started his cultivation on time. After he finished, he took a shower and put on his linen home clothes and slippers before going downstairs.

As soon as he went downstairs, Xia ruofei saw Feng Jing standing by the lake with her arms wide open and taking a deep breath through the window.

He smiled and walked out of the villa as well, saying,””Sister che, you’re up so early!”

Feng Rao turned around and smiled sweetly,”I set an alarm! The farm is too quiet. If I don’t have a phone alarm, I’ll oversleep!”

“So what if I overslept! We’re here to relax this time, do whatever’s comfortable!” Xia ruofei said.
