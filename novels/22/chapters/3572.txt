Chapter 3573: The first day of the new year (1)

Translator: 549690339

On the first day of the first lunar month, Xia ruofei woke up to the faint sound of firecrackers in the distance. It was only dawn.

Last night, he didn’t continue trying to engrave the control core array of the spiritual puppet, because he knew that he couldn’t eat hot tofu in a hurry. Even if he wanted to train his carving proficiency, he had to wait until he returned to the Peach Blossom Island. Under the effect of the highest heaven array, the effect would definitely be better.

Xia ruofei put on his clothes and walked out of the room.

Hu Zi’s mother had already woken up and was preparing breakfast in the kitchen. Lin Qiao, on the other hand, was still sleeping in her room upstairs. At her age, she was at the age where she slept a lot. Not to mention the sound of firecrackers, she might not even wake up even if the next door was beating gongs and drums.

“Godmother, Happy New Year!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Happy New Year! Happy New Year!” Hu Zi’s mother said with a smile.

Then, she dried her hands on her apron and took out a red packet from her pocket. She handed it to Xia ruofei and said,””RUO Fei, take it! This is your New Year’s money!”

Naturally, Xia ruofei had long passed the age of receiving New Year’s money. In fact, he had not received any New Year’s money since he joined the Army. After his grandfather passed away, he had no elders left. Naturally, no one gave him New Year’s money.

Although he was in his twenties and should not be receiving New Year’s money, Xia ruofei did not reject it. He took it and said with a smile,””Thank you, godmother!”ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

This was the old man’s kind intentions. Xia ruofei knew that he should accept it no matter how much it was, or the old man would be unhappy.

It would be unfilial to make the old man angry on the first day of the first month of the lunar year.

Seeing that Xia ruofei accepted it so readily, Hu Zi’s mother was even happier. She smiled and said,””No need to thank me! You don’t have to be so formal with us! Qiao’ er will also have a share!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.

Hu Zi’s mother continued,”ruofei, go wash up first!” Breakfast will be ready soon! 1’11 go wake Qiao’ er up!”

“Let her sleep a little longer!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’m free during the holidays anyway.” 

“It’s not a good sign to sleep in on the first day of the new year!” Hu ‘er’s mother said with a smile as she walked up the stairs.

Xia ruofei smiled and turned to the bathroom to wash up.

Hu Zi’s mother had already prepared a whole set of new toiletries for him yesterday.

After Xia ruofei washed up, he saw the sleepy Lin Qiao walking down the stairs listlessly in the cute milk cow flannel pajamas.

“Brother ruofei, Happy New Year!” Lin Qiao saw Xia ruofei and greeted him lazily.

“Happy New Year!” Xia ruofei replied with a smile.

Lin Qiao extended her hand to Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei was slightly stunned and asked,””What’s wrong?”

“New Year’s money!” Lin Qiao said,”I’m still a child! Don’t you want to give me New Year’s money?”

A hand reached out and slapped Lin Qiao’s hand away. Hu Zi’s mother came out from behind her and scolded with a smile,””You little girl, it’s not enough that 1 gave you red packet money. How dare you ask for it from your brother ruofei?” “I’m the youngest!” Lin Qiao smiled and said,”isn’t it normal for an elder brother to give his younger sister New Year’s money?”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but smile. He nodded and said,””Qiao’ er is right, you should!”

Hu Zi’s mother said,”ruofei, don’t spoil her!” You’ve spoiled this girl!”

“Godmother, it’s the new year. We just want to get some good luck. You don’t have to be so uptight!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Lin Qiao smiled and said,”brother ruofei, what I want is a kind thought. If you take out money at the last minute, 1 won’t accept it!” By the way, the red packet mom gave you doesn’t count either, you can’t take it out!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”don’t worry!” I’ve already prepared for this, how could I forget your red packet money?”

Xia ruofei really did not think about the red Pocket money, but how could such a small thing trouble him?

He had stored a lot of cash in the spirit map space, even a lot of US dollars. Although there were no red packets, there was red paper!

Therefore, Xia ruofei used his mind to communicate with Xia Qing in the medium. He asked her to wrap a 1000 – Yuan red packet with a red paper and wrote a few words on the hand – made red packet with a writing brush in a standard thin gold font: The red packet was exclusive to Lin Qiao.

Of course, all of this was done at the Archean realm.

As time flowed 30 times faster than the outside world at the Archean realm, Xia Qing had plenty of time to prepare the red packet. Xia ruofei could even wait for the ink to dry before taking it out.

While they were talking, half an hour had passed in yuanchu. The cover of the red packet that they had written at the last minute had dried up.

So, after Xia ruofei finished speaking, he reached into his shirt pocket.

Of course, he had actually taken the red packet out from the spirit map space.

Xia ruofei took out a red packet and handed it to Lin Qiao with a smile.”Look, did you prepare this last minute?”

When Lin Qiao saw the unique “red packet” with the handwritten words on it, she would never have thought that Xia ruofei had actually prepared it at the last minute.

Lin Qiao shouted in surprise,”brother ruofei!” Did you really prepare red packet money for me?”

Xia ruofei pouted angrily and said with a smile,””See for yourself! This is Qiao’ er’s exclusive red packet, and I don’t know magic. If I didn’t prepare it in advance, where would 1 get it from?”

Lin Qiao nodded and said,”yes, yes, yes!” 1 knew it, brother ruofei is the best to me!”
