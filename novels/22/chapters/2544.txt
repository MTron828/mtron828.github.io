2545 Receiving orders in the face of danger (3)

Ruby angrily threw the bottle of mineral water in his hand to the ground. The fourth official of the game immediately came over and said in a serious tone,””Mr Ruby, please mind your behavior. Otherwise, I don’t mind suggesting to the Chief Judge to punish you!”

Ruby spread his hands and shrugged.”Alright! Thanks for the reminder!”

He simply stopped standing on the sidelines to direct, but returned directly to his seat. He looked a little complicated and helpless.

He had anticipated many situations before the game, including the lightning – fast loss of the ball at the start of the game. But this was the worst case scenario, and it really happened.

Puado had failed to live up to his trust. He clearly had a good line to pass the ball, but he only knew to dribble the ball forward and break through in a moment of passion. He did not think about passing the ball at all.

Now that the Spaniards were one goal behind, they had no choice but to attack. On the other hand, Valencia, who was stronger than the Espanyol, could wait for the enemy to exhaust her and counterattack.

It could be said that the situation was quite unfavorable for Spain.

“Puardo s responsibility for this ball can not be shirked!” Shen fangjian said,”he’s too clingy!”

“If it was Wu Lei, the ball would have been passed long ago!” Jia Tianning still did not forget to mention Wu Lei,”as long as you control the passing force, there was a lot of space on the left side. The Espanyol’s left midfielder was already quickly plugging in, but puadoré chose a path to the black, which eventually led to the goal concede!” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

On the internet, the bullet screen was also almost full of comments.

“Puado you idiot!”

“You can play in La Liga with this level of skill? I don’t think he’ll even be able to play the ball even if he gets to the second division!”

“Although the Spanish are behind, why am I so happy? Hmph Hmph! As long as I don’t play Wu Lei, I’ll be a fan of RCD Espanyol’s opponent!”

“This is the bitter consequence of ignoring the power of the East! Ruby! You should be more careful ...”

Ruby naturally did not know that the Chinese fans thousands of miles away were reveling. He sat in his seat for less than two minutes before he could not help but stand up and walk to the sidelines again. He began to loudly direct the game.

The early loss of the ball caused the thoughts of the Spanish players to be a little inconsistent. Some wanted to stabilize the defense first, while others hoped to be able to attack and equalize the score as soon as possible.

This kind of disunity led to a bit of disunity in the middle and front field, which made it more difficult to pass the ball.

For a time, Spain’s situation became precarious. The ball could not cross the half of the field at all. Often, there would be mistakes when passing the ball and the other side would intercept the ball.

The players were all exhausted from running around and trying all sorts of ways to suppress Valencia’s offense.

Spain’s situation was getting worse and worse, and Valencia was in complete control of the rhythm of the game. If it were not for the old goalkeeper, Diego Lopez, who blocked the attack, the 0 – 1 score would not have been maintained for long before the other team’s lead would have been extended.

However, 35 minutes into the first half of the game, a goal concede occurred again.

The problem was still with puado’s pass. He passed the ball from the bottom, but the ball was headed out of the penalty area by Valencia’s players first. The second penalty kick was also snatched by Valencia’s players, and they launched a quick counterattack again.

The opponent quickly pushed along Spain’s right flank, but puado did not return to his defensive position for a long time, causing a large open space to appear on the right flank.

The valentian team easily broke through to the edge of the penalty area. The player who dribbled the ball directly passed the ball at a 45 – degree angle. Rodrigo jumped high in the penalty area and headed a theoretical dead angle, sending the ball into the Spanish goal again.

Rodriguez split open twice!

Ruby finally could not take it anymore. He had originally wanted to make a substitution during the halftime interval, but he felt that he could not wait a second longer.

Ruby immediately asked his assistant coach to inform Wu Lei and Xia ruofei to get up and warm up!

Wu Lei was excited. He quickly put on his Training Vest and went to the side of the field to warm up with Xia ruofei.

The camera also captured this scene, but because of the angle, the camera only captured a part of the warm – up area, and everyone could only see the back of the warming – up players.

“We can see that Wu Lei has already stood up to warm up!” Jia Tianning said excitedly,”it seems like Ruby is very dissatisfied with pupuado’s performance. He didn’t even wait for the halftime break before he made a substitution!”

“I also noticed that the mysterious number 25 player warmed up with Wu Lei!” Shen fangjian said,”it’s a pity we can’t see his face. Otherwise, the question that the fans have been discussing during this time would be revealed!”

“Don’t be in a hurry. If he’s really replaced in a while, the broadcast will definitely give a close – up. Then, the answer to who this mysterious number 25 is will be revealed!” Jia Tianning said.

Looking back at the game, puado obviously saw Wu Lei warming up. He felt a little bad. If he was in the starting lineup and was replaced after 30 minutes, he would definitely not be able to accept it. It was even more embarrassing than not being in the starting lineup.

The anxiousness in his heart was reflected in his actions, and that was, his movements would be a Little Big.

It was the same for puardo. He was anxious to perform for Ruby, but the more he wanted to perform, the worse he did. Soon, he lost his balance. In a scramble, he tackled the ball from the side and back, which gave him a yellow card.

Ruby was so angry that he almost cursed out loud. He could not wait for the assistant manager to go to the fourth official to request for a substitution, while he personally went to the warm – up area and used the little time before the dead ball to clarify their task once again to the two players.

Soon, Xia ruofei and Wu Lei changed into their jerseys, put on their leg guards, and followed the fourth official to the side of the field.
