Chapter 1506: Magical beast (2)

Translator: 549690339

The little yellow beast was as fast as lightning as it tried to escape into the darkness. Xia ruofei’s movements were also very Swift. The dagger in his hand flew out and shot towards the little yellow beast like a bolt of lightning.

The military dagger stabbed into the little yellow beast’s hind leg, causing its body to suddenly stop moving.

It was not that Xia ruofei’s Flying Dagger had lost its aim. The main issue was that the little yellow beast was too fast. It would be difficult to kill it in one shot.

As Xia ruofei threw out his military dagger, he did not hesitate to pull out the loaded pistol from his waist. Without a word, he fired in the direction of the yellow beast.

The bullets landed on the ground and created sparks. The little yellow beast’s body kept changing. There was no pattern to its movement. Xia ruofei could only rely on his senses to keep shooting until he ran out of bullets.

The Zippo lighter had already fallen to the ground, but its excellent performance ensured that it continued to provide light.

With the help of the weak light, Xia ruofei could see that he had shot the little yellow beast at least twice. One of the shots had been shot through its neck. It must have been seriously injured as its footsteps had slowed down.

Unfortunately, even though Xia ruofei reloaded his gun very quickly, the little yellow beast still managed to escape into the darkness and took his military dagger with it.

Xia ruofei understood the principle of not giving chase to a cornered enemy. Moreover, he was in a strange and strange environment. Naturally, he would not give chase rashly.

Xia ruofei stood still, panting. It was too dangerous.

This little yellow beast could actually transform into a person he was familiar with, and there were almost no flaws.

After experiencing the mental torture in the illusory formation, he finally escaped from it. This was the moment when he was the most relaxed. At this moment, the little yellow beast changed into Song Wei’s appearance and Xia ruofei almost fell for it.

Just as Xia ruofei was feeling a wave of lingering fear, Xia Qing’s surprised voice suddenly rang in his mind.””Mirage beast?”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment and then said in surprise,””Xia Qing, you can send out your divine sense now?”

As he asked, he quickly felt around and found that he could connect to the spirit map space again with his mind. He immediately felt a lot more at ease.

Xia Qing replied,”master, I’ve been trying to communicate with the outside world with my divine sense. It’s just that I’ve always been suppressed. Just now, I felt that the power of suppression had disappeared.”

“This is a good thing!” Xia ruofei said and then asked,”what magical beast did you just say? What the hell is this?”

“It’s that little yellow beast that just escaped,”said Xia Qing.” I released my divine sense to the outside world and just happened to find that it had escaped. ”

“So that thing is called a magical beast!” Xia ruofei exclaimed,”it can actually change into Song Wei’s appearance. That’s too scary!”

Xia Qing said,”this is an innate ability of magical beasts. They can change into any shape. This magical beast only has three tails. If it can evolve to nine tails, it will be even more terrifying!” An illusory formation that can be arranged with a wave of the hand can even trap a Jindan expert!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be dumbfounded. This magical beast was actually so powerful! He counted on his fingers. Qi refining, foundation building, golden elixir ... He was only at Qi refining Level 5 now. He was still a hundred and eight thousand miles away from golden elixir! The nine – tailed Mirage beast could actually trap a Jindan expert by casually setting up an illusion array!

‘Fortunately, I only met third last today,’ Xia ruofei thought to himself.

Xia Qing continued,”master, the innate skill of the Mirage beast is the Dao of illusion. In addition to being able to change their appearance to pass off as the real thing, they are also natural experts in the field of illusory formations. Moreover, they themselves are the core of the illusory formation, which is equivalent to a moving formation eye. It is very difficult for ordinary people to break it.”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”I understand!” I’ve experienced a terrifying illusory formation before, and it turned out to be created by that little beast. When he saw that the illusory formation could not do anything to me, he personally came out and changed into Song Wei’s appearance to confuse me. He wanted to take advantage of my unguarded state to attack!”

“That should be the case,” Xia Qing said.”That’s why after the Mirage beast was seriously injured by its master, the illusory formation boundary it had set up was naturally broken. That’s why my spiritual sense was no longer suppressed!”

“This thing is too scary ...” Xia ruofei felt that it was a little unbelievable.

Xia Qing said,”master, this also explains one thing. Either this magical beast had already discovered you before you came in, or miss song had also entered this place. Otherwise, it would be impossible for it to change into miss song’s appearance.”

Xia ruofei felt strange and said,”that’s not right!” In the illusionary array, I met many of my former enemies and comrades, but the illusionary beast had never seen them before!”

Xia Qing explained,”everything in the illusory formation is actually master’s own imagination. Those people originally existed in your mind, so it’s not wrong to say that they’re inner demons. The illusory formation is only to stimulate these negative things.” But the magical beast can’t read your memories, it must have seen her before to be able to change into miss song’s appearance!”

Xia ruofei’s expression changed.””Oh no, Song Wei has no cultivation at all. If that’s the case, she’s in danger!”

“Maybe the Mirage beast could sense the scene on the stone platform.” Xia Qing consoled him,”master, you don’t have to worry too much ...”

“No matter what, we have to find this beast and kill it. Otherwise, I won’t be at ease!” Xia ruofei said.

Xia Qing smiled and said,”I also agree with this point!” Destroying the magical beast is also beneficial to master!”

“Oh? What kind of benefits?” Xia ruofei asked.

“You’ll know when you find it and destroy it!” Xia Qing said with a smile,”the biggest threat of a Mirage beast is its ever – changing form. But it’s already injured, and it can’t become your acquaintance to confuse you. As long as we can find it, it shouldn’t be difficult to kill it.”

“You actually kept me in suspense ...” Xia ruofei mumbled.

Then, he picked up the Zippo lighter that was still on fire. Before, he was a little worried that he would fall into complete darkness after running out of oil, but now that he had restored his connection with the spirit map space, he didn’t have to worry about that anymore. There was an entire bottle of lighter oil in the misty space.

Xia ruofei first put the box containing the petals of the spirit Heart Flower, the Mountaineering Bag, and other things into the spirit map space. Then, he held a gun in one hand and a lighter in the other as he fumbled forward.

There were still strange blue bloodstains left behind by the Mirage beast on the ground. Xia ruofei followed the trail of blood and ran forward.

Now that he had the spirit map space and Xia Qing’s assistance, Xia ruofei was more confident.

He walked in the dark for more than ten minutes and didn’t encounter any danger along the way. Perhaps the magical beast was seriously injured and had no way to come out and cause trouble.

The blue bloodstain continued to extend forward.

Xia ruofei muttered to himself,”you can run!” He’s been shot twice and stabbed with a knife, but he’s still able to hold on this far ...”

He continued to move forward for a few dozen meters, and the blue blood disappeared into a dark hole.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be a little stunned. The hole was only about 20 to 30 centimeters in diameter. Of course, it wouldn’t be a problem for the mythical beast to get in, but he was a living person. No matter what, he couldn’t get in.

“Xia Qing! This is the Mirage beast’s nest right?” Xia ruofei used his spiritual will to tell Xia Qing,”what should we do? If it hides in this rat hole and doesn’t come out, we can’t do anything to it!”

Xia Qing muttered to herself for a while and said,””Master, please wait ... I might have a way!” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Okay, you think of a way as soon as possible. I’ll watch over the cave entrance. Don’t let it get away again!” Xia ruofei said.

After a short while, Xia Qing said,””Master, I’ve prepared something for you. Please take it out!”

Xia ruofei’s mind entered the spirit map space and saw Xia Qing holding a bag in her hand. He directly brought the bag to the outside world.

Xia ruofei opened the bag and saw some dried herbs.

“What is this?” Xia ruofei asked.
