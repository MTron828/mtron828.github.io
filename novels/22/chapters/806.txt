Chapter 807: This online store is very ordinary (1)

Translator: 549690339

On a flat open space at the foot of the mountain, hundreds of pots of succulent seedlings were placed neatly, like a line, horizontal and vertical, like soldiers lined up for inspection. Xia Qing was always so meticulous.

Xia ruofei liked this style. He was a soldier and everything in his bedroom was still arranged neatly. The blanket was a standard block of tofu and even the toothbrush in the bathroom was facing a fixed direction.

Some people thought it was an obsessive – compulsive disorder, but Xia ruofei thought it was a manifestation of a soldier’s style.

Ice lantern jade dew, nature manifestation, tortoise – Shell peony, white – skinned lunar boundary, life Stone Flower ...

Xia ruofei was very familiar with the succulents. Looking at these excellent succulents, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel a sense of familiarity.

When he first obtained the spirit map, Xia ruofei had made his first pot of gold with these succulent plants.

Especially that top – grade ice lantern jade dew, not only did it bring him 250000 HxB in income, it also gave him the capital to start his business. It was also because of this opportunity that he was able to reunite with Ling Qingxue, and the two of them gradually got together.

Xia ruofei looked around and said with satisfaction,””You’ve done well, Xia Qing. For the time being, you should be busy with other things. We are in urgent need of the planting of medicinal herbs, the transplanting of iron – Skin dendrobes and tea trees, and other things. You can continue cutting the succulent plants after the flower pots I ordered arrive. ” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing replied respectfully.

After giving his orders, Xia ruofei didn’t stay in the medium for long. After saying goodbye to Xia Qing, he returned to the outside world with a thought. He told her that he still had a lot of things to do today. After he was done with these things, he would start to purchase the abalone fry.

Xia ruofei went downstairs. Hu Zi’s mother had already prepared breakfast. Ever since Jian Jia and her mother came to the farm, Xia ruofei rarely went to the canteen to eat. Hu Zi’s mother would make a variety of dishes every day, making Xia ruofei feel the warmth of a family.

After breakfast, Xia ruofei bade farewell to Hu Zi’s mother and Lin Qiao. Then, he strolled toward the general office building. Ran ran had a lot of work to do today, so he had to explain it to Feng Jing first.

When they arrived at the office building, Feng Jing and Liu Qian had just finished their breakfast in the canteen and were walking upstairs. When they saw Xia ruofei, they quickly greeted him.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”CEO Feng, I was just about to look for you!” Let’s go to my office! I have something to tell you. ”

“Yes, Chairman!” Feng Jing then turned to Liu Qian and said,”Xiao Liu, modify the proposal according to the points I just mentioned. Also, inform director Xiao and the others to postpone the meeting for an hour!”

“Alright, CEO Feng!” Liu Qian said,”then Chairman, President Feng, I’ll go and do my work first!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. After Liu Qian’s figure disappeared around the corner of the corridor, Xia ruofei asked,””Boss Feng, I think I’m affecting your normal work plan?”

Feng Jing looked at Xia ruofei and couldn’t help but think of the voices that made her blush yesterday. She blushed and quickly looked away.

She lowered her head and said softly,”no!” You’re the most important person in the company, so of course, your matters are the most important ...”

Xia ruofei did not notice Feng Rao’s unnatural expression. He laughed and did not say anything.

The two of them walked to Xia ruofei’s office. Xia ruofei personally filled a disposable paper cup with warm water for Feng Jing, then said directly,””Boss Feng, there are a few things that need to be settled immediately.”

“Please speak, Chairman!” Feng Rao immediately took out her notebook and prepared to take notes.

When it came to business, Feng Jing forgot about her embarrassment and regained her composure as a strong woman.

Xia ruofei said,”it’s mainly about the things you mentioned yesterday. I’ve already settled the problem of the vegetable seeds. If everything goes well, they should be delivered to the farm today. Remember to inform old Cao to be ready to receive them.”

“Understood!” Feng Jing nodded.

At the moment, paradise vegetables was still one of the main businesses of paradise Corporation. Especially since the farm had undergone another expansion, it was time to greatly increase production capacity. Feng Jing was also very concerned about this batch of vegetable seeds. When she heard that the problem of seeds had been solved, she couldn’t help but heave a sigh of relief.

“There’s also the matter of iron Kaede. ” Xia ruofei said,”I’ve already contacted my friend. The fresh strips of the iron – skinned Dendrobium will be ready by today. You have to gather all the workers who are making the iron – skinned Dendrobium and get ready to start work at any time.”

“No problem!” Feng Rao said,”I’ve already considered the possibility of producing the iron – hide Kaede bucket in the next few days. I’ve already spoken to their respective supervisors, and the work arrangements can be adjusted at any time.”

“Mm, that’s good!” Xia ruofei said,”also ... Can our workers complete the production of the iron maple bucket independently?”

“It should be fine.” Feng Rao said,”master Luo told me that Qin Xiaojun and the others have finished their apprenticeship and that it won’t be a big problem for them to produce the movie independently.”

Xia ruofei thought for a moment and said,””That being said, this is their first independent production. If there are any problems during the process, it’s fine to lose some money, but it’ll be troublesome if they miss the delivery deadline as stated in the contract ... I think we should contact Qian Lijun and ask him to come over as a consultant if master Luo is free. He doesn’t need to do anything. He’ll just be responsible for supervising from the side. Once he finds any problems with the workers ‘operation, he can correct them in time.”

“That’s a good idea!” Feng Rao said with a smile.

Xia ruofei immediately took out his phone and gave Qian Lijun a call.

Previously, Xia ruofei had helped Qian Lijun’s family a great deal. They had received back the large sum of money that they had been scammed of by the old man. His family was very grateful to Xia ruofei. Moreover, the two of them were good comrades. Therefore, Qian Lijun naturally agreed to lend him a person.

Qian Lijun said that he would get master Luo to come to the three mountains by train this morning.

Xia ruofei smiled and expressed his gratitude. He asked Qian Lijun to inform him of master Luo’s train number and time before he hung up the phone.

“It’s done!” Xia ruofei said,”master Luo will be coming over today! I’ll send you the train number later, remember to arrange for someone to pick you up at the station. ”

“Alright!” Feng ke said.

“Let the workers go out of work in the morning!” Xia ruofei said,”ask them to clean up the place first. All the equipment needs to be cleaned again. Make the necessary preparations.” The earliest I can get them is this afternoon. ”

“Alright, I’ll inform the others now.” Feng Jing said,”Chairman, please wait a moment!”

After Feng Rao finished speaking, she stood up and returned to her office. She picked up her phone and called Cao tieshu and the other related supervisors. She gave instructions on receiving the seeds and gathering the relevant personnel for the production of the Ironhide maples. After that, she returned to Xia ruofei’s office.

“I’ve already notified them. ” Feng ke said.

Xia ruofei admired Feng Jing’s Swift and decisive actions. He nodded in satisfaction and said,””Boss Feng, there’s one more thing I’d like to hear your opinion on.”

Xia ruofei then gestured for Feng Rao to come to his side.

Feng Jing froze for a moment as she recalled the embarrassing sounds she had heard yesterday. She thought to herself, this guy was probably doing it with his girlfriend in the chair yesterday, right? Why did he call me over? Could it be that he had tasted the marrow and suddenly had evil thoughts?

With this thought, Feng Jing couldn’t help but feel a little nervous. She subconsciously turned around and realized that she had already closed the office door when she entered. This made her even more nervous.

Xia ruofei didn’t notice Feng Jing’s awkwardness at all. Instead, he quickly opened the online store of “Taoyuan meat stall” on his computer.

After opening the blogshop, Xia ruofei raised his head and looked at Feng Jing. He asked in confusion,””President Feng, what are you doing? Come over! The thing I want to show you is on the computer!”

Feng Jing finally realized how ridiculous her wild thoughts were. She knew Xia ruofei well. He was a gentleman. Although what happened yesterday was ridiculous, he was with his girlfriend! Now that there were so many people coming and going outside in broad daylight, how could he suddenly have sexual thoughts about his company’s general manager?

Feng Jing blushed at the thought and coughed to hide her embarrassment.

Xia ruofei asked with concern,”not feeling well?” Did you catch a cold?”

“Oh, it’s fine, it’s fine ...” Feng Jing said with her head lowered.

“Why is your face so red? Don’t tell me you have a fever?” Xia ruofei asked,”if you’re sick, you have to go see a doctor. You can’t delay it!” No matter how important work is, it’s not as important as your health. ”

Feng Rao wanted to dig a hole and hide in it. She said in embarrassment,””I’m really fine! Chairman, what do you want me to see?”

Feng Jing said as she walked behind Xia ruofei and looked at the computer screen.

Xia ruofei pointed at the page of the online store and smiled.””What do you think of this shop?”

Feng Rao squinted her eyes and said,””Taoyuan butcher shop? Chairman, do you want to Sue this online store for copyright infringement? I’m afraid that won’t be easy. After all, this is an online store, and the name “paradise” is quite common. They haven’t used our trademark yet, and their business scope is also ...”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh at Feng Rao’s long speech.

“I just wanted to ask what you think of this shop,” he said with a smile.

Feng Jing picked up the mouse and scrolled through the page, carefully looking at the layout of the blogshop and the items it was selling.

After a while, she realized that this position seemed a little ambiguous. Xia ruofei was still sitting on the chair, but her upper body was lowered and in front of Xia ruofei. Their bodies were very close, and Xia ruofei’s hot breath could reach her body.

The key was that this position was quite fanciful. Feng Jing couldn’t help but imagine Ling Qingxue lying on the office table yesterday, while Xia ruofei was wantonly attacking her from behind.

Feng Rao stood up, blushing. She sneaked a glance at Xia ruofei and was relieved to see that Xia ruofei was still looking straight at her. Her eyes were clear.

So, I was wrong again ... Feng Jing felt extremely embarrassed. Ever since she accidentally overheard the conversation between the two of them yesterday, her thoughts seemed to have become a lot more “evil”. Was it because she hadn’t had a boyfriend in a long time?

Xia ruofei was still waiting for Feng Rao’s answer. Seeing that she was silent for a long time, he couldn’t help but turn around and look at her curiously.

Feng Rao came back to her senses and quickly cleared her throat.”Chairman, this shop ... To be honest, there’s nothing special about it. It’s obvious that it’s a free template from the internet! However, the succulent plants they sold were quite unique and of high quality. However, there are many fake goods in the Taobao shop now. Although the good reviews of this shop’s products are almost 100%, it’s hard to say that they didn’t get them through shopping ...”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel embarrassed. He laughed dryly and said,””Your evaluation ... Is quite pertinent!”

Feng Rao looked at Xia ruofei strangely and asked,””Chairman, this shop looks very ordinary! Why are you suddenly paying attention to this? Are you really not going to Sue them for copyright infringement?”

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly.”Of course I won’t Sue you for copyright infringement. This is a ‘normal’ blogshop. I opened it before I started my company!”

“Ah?” Feng Rao couldn’t help but exclaim as she covered her mouth with an awkward expression.
