Steel gun urgently needs everyone’s support!] “Of course we’ll accept the ginseng,” the young salesgirl said with a smile,”but our Tongren Hall has high requirements for the quality of ginseng. We don’t accept ordinary ginseng.” She said as she opened the paper box that Xia ruofei had pushed over. With just a glance, the salesgirl’s expression immediately froze and she said,”Sir, please wait a moment. I’ll invite our apothecary over.” Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. From the reaction of the salesgirl, he guessed that the ginseng he brought out must be of good quality. After all, although this salesgirl was young, she had been influenced by Tongren Hall and must know what was good. The fact that she valued it so much already explained the problem. Very quickly, an old medicine master with white hair and a white beard walked over with the female shop assistant. He nodded politely at Xia ruofei and then looked at the ginseng. The old medicine master’s eyes lit up, and he hurriedly took out a pair of reading glasses from his white coat and put them on. He then took out a small magnifying glass and looked closer. He looked at it very carefully and even picked up the ginseng from the box. After looking at it for a long time, he said excitedly,””Sir, this wild ginseng of yours is of excellent quality and maturity. Our Tongren Hall is willing to buy it for 700000 Yuan!” The old medicine master looked at Xia ruofei expectantly. There were very few real wild ginseng in the market now. Even a hundred – year – old brand like Tongren Hall did not have a lot of wild ginseng in stock. It wasn’t easy for him to encounter such a wild ginseng with almost perfect ‘five forms and six bodies’, so the old apothecary was also eager to take it. It was no exaggeration to say that such a wild ginseng was enough to become the treasure of this Tongren Tang branch. When Xia ruofei heard the price of 700000, he was relieved. The old doctor saw that Xia ruofei did not say anything and quickly said,””Sir, 700000 is definitely the real price. Our Tongren Hall is a hundred – year – old shop. We will never deceive our customers and ruin our reputation.” “I believe you,” Xia ruofei said with a smile. Then he took out two other paper boxes from his bag and placed them on the counter. He gently pushed them towards the old medicine master and said,””Please take a look at these two as well. If the price is right, I’ll sell them to you.” There were two more! The old apothecary’s eyes almost popped out. He quickly opened the box. When he saw the two ginsengs that were no worse than the first one, his heart couldn’t help but race. Usually, it was rare to see even one such ginseng, but this time, there were actually three! The old medicine master looked at it repeatedly with a magnifying glass, afraid to miss a detail. After looking at it for more than ten minutes, the old apothecary finally confirmed that these three ginsengs were all authentic wild ginsengs. Moreover, according to the grading standard, they were at least first – grade ginsengs, and might even be special – grade ginsengs. “Sir, Tongren Hall will take all three of these ginsengs!” The old medicine master said,”with my authority, I can give you a maximum of 720000 Yuan for each. What do you think?” The old apothecary had also made up his mind to buy these three wild ginseng, so he gritted his teeth and added another 20000 Yuan for each. “Deal!” Xia ruofei said readily. “Thank you! Thank you!” The old medicine master said happily. Soon, both parties signed a simple ginseng transfer agreement. Xia ruofei’s almost empty bank card had an additional 2.16 million Huaxia dollars. When Xia ruofei was leaving, the old medicine master sent him to the door with great enthusiasm and said,””Sir, if you have such high – Quality wild ginseng in the future, you must come to our Tongren Hall again! We’ll take as many as you have!” Xia ruofei agreed with a smile. However, he didn’t have any plans to sell wild ginseng in the short term. Such a precious wild ginseng wasn’t a carrot. If he sold one every few days, even a fool could see the problem. Moreover, these three ginsengs had grown using the petal solution. The other ginsengs in the spirit map space still needed time to grow. The longer they were planted, the higher their value. Wasn’t it a waste of God’s gift to dig them out now? After Xia ruofei returned to the car, she immediately took out her phone and called boss Chen of Lingyu house. “Hello, brother Xia!” Boss Chen greeted him with great enthusiasm. “Boss Chen, sorry to disturb you again.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”the quality of the Jade from yesterday was not bad. I want to buy some more. Do you still have any?” Boss Chen was stunned for a moment, thinking that this young master was treating Jade as cabbage in the market? He had just bought it for five million yesterday, and he wanted it again today? Xia ruofei had already bought all the Jades of this grade in his shop. Yesterday, in order to gather the Jades worth five million Yuan, he even went to another shop to make some turnover. “Brother Xia, how much do you need?” boss Chen asked. “Around two million!” Xia ruofei answered after a moment of silence. Boss Chen took in a cold breath and said with a bitter smile,””Brother Xia, to tell you the truth, the jadeite I bought yesterday was basically all I have in my store ...” “Is that so ...” Xia ruofei felt a little regretful.”I’ll go somewhere else then ...” It seemed that he could only ask another shop. He had a great time working with boss Chen. It was quite troublesome to change to another store. He didn’t know if other stores were willing to sell raw jade! Boss Chen gritted his teeth and said,”brother Xia, give me three days. I’m sure I can get the Jade material that’s worth two million Yuan in three days!” Can I?” Boss Chen knew that he had to keep a close eye on a good customer like Xia ruofei. If he went to another store this time, he might not come back to buy from him again. Although the profit from selling jadeite directly was relatively low, Xia ruofei’s demand was huge! Xia ruofei thought for a while and nodded.”Alright! Then I’ll have to trouble you, boss Chen ...” “What are you saying! You’re taking care of my business, I should be the one thanking you!” Boss Chen said with a bright smile. After hanging up the phone, Xia ruofei started the car and drove back to Taoyuan farm. Xia ruofei stayed in the farm for the next two days because all the projects were in the final stage. On the third day, the security system that ye Lingyun was responsible for was in place and the construction of the entire Peach Blossom Farm was completed successfully. Xia ruofei immediately organized the inspection. One had to admit that the quality of the construction team sent by Liang Qichao was first – Class. Xia ruofei led ye Lingyun, pang Hao, and manager li around the entire farm and basically could not find any problems. All the construction was done in accordance with the design requirements, and the quality was guaranteed. There was no slacking in construction. Xia ruofei readily signed his name on the project acceptance form and asked pang Hao to pay the rest of the money in the afternoon. According to the usual practice, the construction company would keep a part of the remaining money and pay it after the project had been put into use for a period of time. However, Xia ruofei and Liang Qichao were very close, so he did not do that. In any case, if there were any problems with the project in the future, Liang Qichao would not go back on his word. After the inspection, Xia ruofei was about to drive to the spirit Jade house to collect the new batch of jadeite when a few workers he had recruited came to the villa. They said that they had something to report to their boss.
