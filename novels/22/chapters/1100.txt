Chapter 1101: Chapter 694 – Green eyes (2)

Translator: 549690339

Those who could sit with elder song in the backyard must be high – ranking leaders or children of the song family. Xia ruofei looked like he was not related to either of them. He was also so young, but the usually serious elder song was so kind to him. Everyone was curious.

After Xia ruofei sat down, elder song smiled and asked,””Xiao Xia, I heard from Xiao Rui ... That you’re in the capital for a business trip?”

Xia ruofei nodded.”Yes, sir. Our company has recently developed a new skin care product. We’re here mainly to find a brand ambassador.”

“Your company actually produces skin care products?” elder song asked curiously. Aren’t you the main agricultural products?”

Xia ruofei scratched his head in embarrassment and said,””It’s a pure Traditional Chinese Medicine skin care product. I got the prescription by accident and tried to make some for my relatives and friends. It’s very effective, so I thought of a way to mass – produce it ...”

“Oh ... It’s pure Chinese medicine! With an expert like you, the effect will definitely be very good!” Elder song said with a smile.

Those who didn’t know Xia ruofei well were surprised to see elder song so concerned about such a small matter and even asked a few questions. They couldn’t help but look at Xia ruofei a few more times.

Tian Huilan’s eyes lit up when she heard this, and she couldn’t help but ask,””Ruofei, this skin care product you’re talking about, could it be ... Jade skin cream?”

After Xia ruofei had made the jaded skin ointment, he had given quite a lot to Tian Huilan and Lu You, so she was very clear about the magical effects of the jaded skin ointment. However, she was an elder after all, so she was too embarrassed to ask Xia ruofei for more after she had used up the jaded skin ointment.

Xia ruofei smiled.”Aunty Tian, it’s the Jade skin cream. We’ve already found a way to mass produce it. If nothing goes wrong, it should be on the market soon.”

Elder song’s daughter, Song Zhi LAN, had also used the jaded skin ointment before. Of course, she had only received one portion, and it was also a gift from Tian Hui LAN.

Song Zhilan’s eyes immediately brightened up after she heard that. She said,””The jaded skin cream is finally going to be mass – produced! That’s great ... Little Xia, when can you buy it?”

Eccentric song couldn’t help but laugh,”Xia, it seems that your company’s jaded skin cream is really effective! Even Hui LAN and Zhi LAN can’t hold it in anymore ...”

Tian Huilan was a high – Level official, and although song Zhilan didn’t enter politics, she was in charge of the song family’s business. The capital in her hands was easily in the hundreds of millions. The fact that the two of them were so interested in the news of the Jade skin cream showed how attractive this product was.

Xia ruofei touched his nose in embarrassment and said,””I’m still confident in the product’s effects. However, we’ll still have to wait for the market to test the sales after it’s launched!”

Xia ruofei then said to song Zhilan,””Auntie song, the approval process for the jaded skin cream was completed by Ma Shan. Now, all the preparation work is going smoothly. It should be available for sale in a month at the latest. However, our early production capacity is limited, so we might not have a lot of stock in Beijing.”

“Is that so ...” Song Zhilan said,”it’s alright, I’ll ask Xiao Rui to buy more for me from the southeast province!”

Although Tian Huilan didn’t say anything, her expression was one of eagerness. She was clearly very tempted.

Xia ruofei’s heart skipped a beat. He smiled and said,”Aunt Tian, aunt song, I brought some products with me from Beijing this time. I’ll ask song Rui to bring some to you tomorrow. You can share them with your relatives and friends. If they’re good, help us promote them!”

Although Xia ruofei had given Tian Huilan a lot of jaded skin cream and it had been popular for a while, he had not wanted to mass – produce it immediately at that time, so he had only made a small amount.

Now that it was ready for the market on a large scale, he had prepared a lot of hand – made jaded skin cream in the spirit map space. One of Feng Jing’s sales plans was a hand – made limited – edition jaded skin cream, so Xia ruofei had already asked Xia Qing to start making it in the spirit map space to stock up.

Xia ruofei suddenly realized that upper – Class ladies like Tian Huilan and song Zhilan would be very good promoters of the jaded skin cream. He was very confident in the efficacy of the jaded skin cream. As long as he took out a small amount of jaded skin cream, this magical product would become popular in the upper – Class circle first. After a while, when it was on the market, it would have a very good effect.

Even these upper – Class people were flocking to it. This was simply the best advertisement.

“Xia, you’ve got a good mind for business!” Elder song laughed.

None of the people present were simple people. They understood Xia ruofei’s intention after some thought and smiled kindly.

“I’m just a blacksmith,” Xia ruofei chuckled.”I’m confident in my product ...” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“That’s right!”Elder song agreed. If the product was not up to standard, even if the publicity was good, the users would not buy it! It’s like this in business, and it’s the same in politics. ”

Elder song’s children and the military and political officials all had thoughtful expressions.

Elder song was just sighing and didn’t really lecture him. He looked at Xia ruofei and asked,””Oh right, I remember that you’ve also developed a special medicine for treating autism. How’s the progress of that project?”
