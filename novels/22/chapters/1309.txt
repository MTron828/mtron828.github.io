Translator: 549690339

Chen shun said gloomily,”we didn’t even talk about it!” When the chairman of this company heard my offer, he immediately got up and left. Then, their general manager’s attitude was very tough and his tone was very aggressive. We couldn’t talk about it anymore!”

“They didn’t even discuss the price and just left?” Chen Weinan also found it unbelievable.

“Isn’t that so?” Chen shun said,”second uncle, I suspect that there’s something fishy about this! “Lin Zhongming has a close relationship with this company, and it was all thanks to this company that he was able to get to his position. Now that he has more power, he’s in charge of the procurement of the entire East China District. I think there’s something strange about this deal. Could it be that there’s some Benefit Transfer between him and this company ...”

Chen Weinan pondered for a while and said,”I know. Since that’s the case, you can retreat first!”

“Alright, second uncle!” Chen shun said. Then, he couldn’t help but ask,”then, what about Lin Zhongming ...”

“You don’t need to care!” Chen Weinan said,”I’ll ask the comrades of the discipline Inspection team to investigate it in secret!”

Chen shun was overjoyed and said,”okay!” We have to investigate this guy thoroughly. There’s definitely something wrong with him!”

This time, Chen shun even hated President Lin, so he fanned the flames here, hoping that President Lin would be in trouble.

After hanging up the phone, Chen shun glanced at the purchasing Commissioner, who had a strange expression on his face, and said,”You don’t need me to teach you what to say when you get back, do you?”

The purchasing Commissioner trembled slightly and quickly said,””Manager Chen, I understand. Don’t worry!”

He didn’t have any background in the company. Although he knew that Chen shun was lying, he didn’t dare to say a word. Otherwise, with Chen shun’s power in the chain headquarters, he would be fired in three days if he wanted to.

Chen shun nodded in satisfaction and said,”Smart people should know how to judge the situation. After this incident, I will find a way to find you a Deputy Manager position!”

The purchasing Commissioner smiled bitterly in his heart and pretended to be grateful. He said,””Thank you, manager Chen! Thank you, manager Chen!”

Taoyuan farm.

President Lin walked into Xia ruofei’s office with an apologetic look on his face.

“Brother Xia, I’m really sorry ...” He said as soon as he entered the door.

Xia ruofei waved his hand.”Mr. Lin, this has nothing to do with you. I’m not an unreasonable person. Don’t worry!”

“This Chen shun is a shit stirrer!” President Lin said angrily,”such a good thing was ruined by him!”

“Let’s not talk about him!” Xia ruofei said,”this kind of person needs to be taught a lesson!”

“Brother Xia, how about this ...” President Lin hesitated for a moment and said,”as the Vice President of East China, I can make decisions for transactions below 80 million Yuan. I just need to report it to the headquarters for record. Why don’t we reduce the transaction volume this time ...” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”forget it!” President Lin, it’s not that I don’t want to work with you, but the main thing is that I’ve just driven away your people from the headquarters. Now that you’re representing the East China region to sign a contract with us, I’m worried that it will have a bad impact on you. ”

After all, Tongren Hall was a state – owned enterprise, and the rules of the officialdom were also applicable here.

If President Lin signed a contract with paradise Corporation under such circumstances, not only would he not be appreciated by the leader, but he would also be labeled as insensible, and it would be difficult for him to improve in the future.

President Lin knew this as well, but he felt sorry for Xia ruofei, so he proposed this solution.

He sighed and said,”AI!” Why is it so difficult to do something wholeheartedly?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”CEO Lin, forget it. There’s no need to be angry. We’ll have more opportunities to work together in the future.” By the way, you might as well stay for a few more days and take it as a distraction!”

“There’s still a lot of things waiting for me to deal with at home!”President Lin said with a bitter smile. Brother Xia, I’ve already asked my men to book an evening ticket. This time, it’s my fault, please forgive me!”

“I don’t blame you for this, so don’t apologize anymore!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”the business is not done, but it doesn’t affect our personal relationship!”

“Okay, I won’t disturb you any longer ...” President Lin said with a little disinterest,”I’ll have to trouble you to send a car to take us to the airport in the afternoon!”

“No problem!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”President Lin, you should go and rest for a while. I’ll have a few drinks with you this afternoon!”

After CEO Lin left, Xia ruofei could not help but slam the table, feeling all sorts of dissatisfaction.

‘Looks like I can’t count on aweto for this 100 million,’ Xia ruofei thought to himself.

Although such good wormgrass wouldn’t have a problem selling, it wasn’t easy to find a partner who could buy so many goods in one go and pay quickly.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and was about to take out his phone to make an appointment with a bank overseas.

Just then, his phone rang first ...
