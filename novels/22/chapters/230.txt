Chapter 231: Chapter 227 – we also have the old material of Phoebe zhennan (1)

Liang Qichao said,”my dad went to take a look at that piece of material. It’s indeed an old material of Phoebe zhennan. It’s more than a meter in diameter, and most of it has formed a core. I estimate that the core diameter can be more than 95 centimeters.” Over the years, it’s getting harder and harder to find such big and old materials, so after seeing the photo, the old man was very satisfied with this piece of material. ” Xia ruofei did some quick calculations in his heart. The Phoebe zhennan tree that he had planted in the spirit map space was about a meter in diameter when he went to take a look last time. He did not measure it when he went into the space to patrol, but it was obviously bigger than the last time. The flow of time was one factor. More importantly, after a few upgrades and evolutions, the spiritual Qi in the space had become quite rich. The growth rate of the plants in the space had obviously sped up. Not only were the Phoebe zhennan trees growing much faster than before, but the ginseng was also the same. Xia ruofei conservatively estimated that the ginseng in the space was at least a hundred – year – old wild ginseng. Xia ruofei estimated that the diameter of the Phoebe zhennan wood could reach at least 1.1 meters. Furthermore, the quality of the Phoebe zhennan that grew in the space would definitely be much higher than the outside world. The core that formed in the space would definitely not be smaller than the old material that Liang Qichao mentioned. The key was time. If there was enough time, the Phoebe zhennan could grow for a few more days. In order to form old materials, the trees had to be cut down in advance and let it dry and oxidize in the natural environment. This process would take at least three years. Even in the spirit map space, it would probably take twenty to thirty days. “Brother Liang, when will your maternal grandfather return to China?” Xia ruofei asked. “He still has some business to deal with in the United States, probably in a month.” Liang Qichao continued,”ruofei, why are you asking this all of a sudden? Don’t tell me ...” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”brother Liang, I can’t forget what you asked me to do for even a moment!” I’ve also been asking my friends to find out! Didn’t we just make some progress?” Liang Qichao’s spirit was immediately lifted, and he asked,””Oh, really? How big is the material?” “It shouldn’t be smaller than the one your relative found. The quality must be even better.” Xia ruofei said. “Old material?” Liang Qichao’s voice was shaking with excitement. “Definitely! Why would I tell you about the new material?” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”but ... Brother Liang, we only have a rough idea. It’s hard to say if we can get it! And he didn’t know if he would make it in time. Don’t tell anyone at home yet. You’d better find out the exact time when the old man will return to the country. I’ll try to rush my friend as well. ” “Good, good, good!” Liang Qichao quickly said,”ruofei, it’ll be at least a month before your grandfather returns to the country. Hurry up with your friend. It should be fine.” “MMH! We’ll try our best!” Xia ruofei said,”but your relative has already found a piece of big news. Will your Grandpa still want us?” “As long as it’s better than the material my relative finds, he’ll definitely want it!” Liang Qichao said,”at most, we’ll just get both pieces of material! The old man doesn’t lack money, so he definitely won’t let go of such good material!” Liang Qichao was very excited. He knew very well that if Xia ruofei could really get his hands on a material that was better than his relatives ‘, his maternal grandfather would probably buy both pieces of material. However, he would definitely use the better piece of material as a longevity material. This huge favor would definitely fall into their family’s hands. When the time came, as long as his cousin – grandfather gave them a little support in their business, their family’s business would definitely usher in a leap in development. When the inheritance was to be divided in the future, the benefits that his family would get would definitely be the largest. “Alright, I got it.” Xia ruofei said,”I’ll rush my friend and try to get it done as soon as possible.” However, I estimate that it will take at least a month!” “There’s still time!” “I’ll tell my Grandpa once you’ve confirmed it,” Liang Qichao said.”It’s fine even if he’s back in the country. Just treat it as a surprise!” After talking about the Phoebe zhennan, Xia ruofei told Liang Qichao that he wanted to build a house on his farm. Liang Qichao was excited and agreed readily. He said that he would come to the farm with manager li the next day and that he would pay Xia ruofei the cost price for the construction and materials. After hanging up the phone, Xia ruofei found a tape measure and took out the spirit map scroll. He then entered the medium. He went straight to the Phoebe zhennan tree and measured it with a tape measure. The thickest part of the tree had already reached a diameter of 1.2 meters. Then he quickly climbed up the tree and found a position on it to measure it. It was also about 1.1 meters, so it was definitely not a problem to take a section of old material with a diameter of more than one meter. Xia ruofei immediately felt relieved. He calculated the time. With the difference in the flow of time and the factors of the space environment, the aureum should be able to form a perfect old material after being cut down and placed in the space for about 25 days. Thus, he decided to officially cut down the trees in five days. The main reason was that such a large tree needed to be prepared before it could be cut down. Moreover, the longer it grew in the space, the bigger it would grow. For such a precious wood, the better. …… The next morning, the trucks of the two restaurants had just left when Liang Qichao drove to Peach Blossom Farm with the project manager Xiao Li. Liang Qichao gave Xia ruofei a big hug as soon as he got out of the car. He smiled and said,””Ruofei, thank you so much for the Phoebe zhennan!” “I can’t be sure yet! Brother Liang, don’t thank me too early!” Xia ruofei said with a smile. “Brother, you’ve always been reliable, I’m very assured!” Liang Qichao laughed and said,”that uncle of mine has been so smug these few days ... Hehe, if he sees that I’ve also found a piece of old material that’s even more outstanding than his one in a month’s time, his expression will definitely be very interesting!” “Brother Liang, you didn’t tell anyone, right? If it doesn’t work out, we’ll lose face!” Xia ruofei asked with a smile. “Don’t worry! You’ve already told me, so how can I just say that?” “I didn’t even tell my dad,” Liang Qichao said.”He’s been frowning all day long! That’s good too, he won’t have the time to care about me, haha ...” “You’re so quick – witted ...” Xia ruofei was speechless. The three of them chatted as they walked to a large open space. Xia ruofei pointed at the open space and said,””Brother Liang, manager Li, I’m planning to build a building on this land. I’ll also have to reserve a place for cold storage. This time, I’m planning to build an office and apartment complex.” “Manager li, take a good look!” Liang Qichao said,”this is my brother’s business. You have to do it well, okay?”
