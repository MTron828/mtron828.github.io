Chapter 1800: Net assets over 1 billion (2)

It was even more so for the pharmaceutical factory. The jaded skin cream was completely sold through the online channel, but up until now, it was still in the mode of regular purchases. The production capacity of the pharmaceutical factory was full, but it still could not meet the demand.

And this was only the Chinese market. If it were to go global, even if the pharmaceutical factory expanded several times, it might not be able to meet the demand.

The director of the pharmaceutical factory, Xue Jinshan, also told a joke. He said that the business of overseas shopping had been very popular in recent years. Many people went abroad to bring goods for others. However, the Jade skin cream had given rise to the business of “overseas shopping.” It was said that many foreigners who came to China would try to buy a few sets of Jade skin cream to bring back.

Although the jaded skin cream was not officially sold overseas, its reputation was not weak at all.

It was the same for heart – nourishing soup. Most of the heart – nourishing soup was purchased directly from the hospital because it was the only special medicine for autism in the world. Moreover, the effect was very significant, so it was consumed quite quickly.

Xia ruofei did not intend to profit much from the heart – nourishing soup. The price was also quite affordable, so most of the autistic families could afford it.

In addition, taking into account that many children with autism had received all kinds of correction training from a young age, and that many families were poor due to illness, and that many children from very poor families could not afford to use heart – nourishing soup, the Paradise corporation’s charity fund had also set up a “Star Fund” program to help children with autism.

As long as an autistic child was confirmed to be from a poor family, they would be able to receive funding from the star Fund. Not only would they get a certain amount of free medicine, but they would also receive a certain amount of cash funding.

This also brought a huge amount of social prestige to the Paradise Corporation, and the Paradise Charity Foundation also became famous.

Xia ruofei had been quietly listening to the reports. After Xue Jinshan finished, he said,”Factory manager Xue, let me interrupt! The supply of the heart – nourishing soup can’t be changed in a short period of time. Have you ever considered that the hospitals that have received our medicine may have some corruption problems?”

When there was a need, there would naturally be benefits. Although most doctors were good, it was inevitable that a small number of people would have some crooked thoughts in this area for the sake of benefits.

Now that the supply of heart – nourishing soup was controlled, there was a problem of some people using the medicine first, while some people had to wait in line for a period of time. The doctor had a great deal of autonomy over who used the medicine first.

In even more extreme cases, the doctor might not be able to make up a prescription, get the heart – nourishing soup out, and then sell it at a high price.

“President Xia,” Xue Jinshan said,”it’s unrealistic to completely put an end to this situation. But we still have countermeasures. We have permanent pharmaceutical sales representatives in central hospitals with relatively large quotas, and they can play a supervisory role. We also occasionally investigate some small hospitals in the open and in the dark. I believe that large – scale reselling of patients will definitely not exist!”

Pharmaceutical sales representatives from other companies would try their best to curry favor with the department in charge and the doctors in the hospital, but the pharmaceutical sales representatives from paradise pharmaceutical factory did the opposite. This was a very strange phenomenon.

Xia ruofei nodded.”We have to form a long – term mechanism for this. We even need to increase our manpower. I don’t want the medicine that we’ve worked so hard to develop and produce to become a tool for a few people to profit from!”

“Yes, President Xia!” Xue Jinshan quickly took down notes as he said,”after I go back, I’ll arrange for all the supervisors and pharmaceutical sales representatives to carry out a comprehensive investigation!”

“Yes. After we find out, we have to report to the hospital. On the other hand, we have to take measures to reduce the quota when necessary!” Xia ruofei said,”there’s only so much production anyway. If this one loses, the others will have more. In general, the patients ‘interests will not be affected.”

“Chairman, I suggest we set up an exposure channel on the company’s official website,” Dong Yun also said.”We’ll expose all the hospitals and doctors with problems and write down measures to reduce quotas. In addition, we can appropriately increase the quota for hospitals that are more capable of controlling themselves. This way, on one hand, it’ll serve as a deterrent, and on the other hand, it can also mobilize the enthusiasm of the hospitals in self – discipline!”

Xia ruofei said,”director Dong, that’s a good suggestion!” Factory manager Xue, please take note of the adjustments needed for the website. You can directly contact the technical department!” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Yes, Chairman!” Xue Jinshan quickly replied.

Then, the Chief Financial Officer, pang Hao, began to report the company’s financial situation.

Pang Hao held the thick report and said,””Chairman, as of yesterday, our company’s revenue has reached 320 million. The higher revenue is 180 million from Yushi ointment, as well as high – end Chinese medicinal herbs such as Cordyceps sinensis and iron maple. Taoyuan vegetables ‘revenue is also very stable, reaching about 53 million. From the perspective of the income composition, the proportion of online channels is also growing, mainly because Yushi ointment is sold in e – commerce channels.”

Pang Hao paused for a moment before continuing,”in terms of expenses, other than normal expenses such as wages, benefits, and taxes, there’s also the remaining funds for the purchase of the headquarters building, as well as the renovation and purchase of office equipment. This amount is about 220 million. Currently, the company still has around 90 million Yuan in liquid funds!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”the situation is much better than I thought!” I thought that after buying the building, the company would be out of money! I didn’t expect there to be surplus food!”

Everyone laughed when they heard that.

“How much is our company’s net worth?” Xia ruofei continued.

Pang Hao was clearly prepared for this as he immediately replied,””The company’s liquid capital is 90 million. In addition, it owns a pharmaceutical factory, a building, and a farm. These fixed assets can be valued at about 600 million. The recent rise in land and property prices may increase even more. “Of course, in terms of the company’s intangible assets, the value of our paradise brand is also getting higher and higher, especially for the two projects of Jade skin cream and heart – nourishing soup. I have referred to the evaluation of several professional institutions, and the intangible assets value can reach one billion. As for the debt ... It’s zero!”

Pang Hao’s expression was a little strange when he said this. He was a very professional financial staff. To be honest, he had never heard of such a large company having zero debts.

“So, our company is worth 1.7 billion?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

“This is just a conservative estimate.” Pang Hao said,”in fact, some organizations have valued us at more than 2 billion.”

“I’ve been receiving a lot of inquiries from other institutions recently, and they’re all interested in financing!” Among them is a famous venture capital company like Sequoia Capital. ”

“That’s because they saw the value of the Paradise brand!” Xia ruofei said,”capital is all about profit. Otherwise, why would people be interested in a small company like ours?”

Then, Xia ruofei changed the topic and said,””But we’re not short of money, so why should we accept their financing?”

Feng Jing already knew Xia ruofei very well. Although Xia ruofei was usually kind to everyone, he was a little independent deep down. She knew that Xia ruofei would definitely not let his shares be diluted by the capital.

However, Dong Yun, who came from a Business School, had a different opinion. She said,””Chairman, there are benefits to financing. On the one hand, you can get development funds, and on the other hand, you can get some other help. Those venture capital institutions have strong connections ...”

Xia ruofei smiled.”We’ll talk about the financing later. Let’s not talk about it today.”

When Dong Yun heard this, she knew that Xia ruofei had not considered financing at all. Although she felt that this was a common problem for private enterprises and would definitely limit the development space of the company in the future, she was still a newcomer. Since the chairman had decided, she did not say anything more.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”everyone has already reported the good news. Don’t you have any problems?” If you have it, say it! We’ll try our best to solve it!”
