Chapter 585: President Feng can handle two people by himself (2)

“Alright!”

Xia ruofei took the box containing the necklace, and Ling Qingxue turned her back to him. Xia ruofei took the necklace out of the box, wrapped it around Ling Qingxue’s neck, and carefully put the necklace on the back of her neck.

Looking at Ling Qingxue’s white and flawless neck, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel excited.

Especially when Ling Qingxue turned around, her Jade – like skin made the thin necklace and blue crystal pendant look even more radiant. Xia ruofei could not help but stare blankly. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Ling Qingxue blushed and asked,”What are you looking at?” Is it good or not?”

Xia ruofei chuckled,”nice!” My wife will look good no matter what necklace she wears ...”

Ling Qingxue rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei and chuckled.””Silly ... Drive! I’m hungry ...”

Xia ruofei immediately started the car and drove to the restaurant he had booked.

For lunch, Xia ruofei chose a specialty restaurant. They did not ask for a private room. Instead, they chose a private room in the lobby by the glass window and ordered a spicy fish Pot, a few stir – fried vegetables, and a bowl of soup.

The two of them were obviously not in the mood to eat. They finished their lunch in about half an hour and then drove to the Shangri – La hotel that Xia ruofei had booked in advance.

As soon as they entered the door, the two of them hugged each other tightly and couldn’t wait to kiss.

Xia ruofei closed the door with his foot, then carried Ling Qingxue by the waist and ran straight to the big bed in the room ...

Absence makes the heart grow fonder.

......

They had not been together for a few days. Xia ruofei missed Ling Qingxue’s long and alluring legs. The two of them rolled around in the room. Fortunately, the sound insulation of the five – Star hotel was good. Otherwise, the “neighbors” would have protested.

After a round of chaos, the hands of the clock were already pointing to two in the afternoon.

Xia ruofei carried Ling Qingxue to the bathroom for a couple’s bath. Naturally, he took advantage of her by touching her all over, which made Ling Qingxue’s body go soft.

If not for the fact that Ling Qingxue still had to go to work in the afternoon, Xia ruofei would definitely be in a frenzy and have sex with Ling Qingxue in the bathroom.

After the two of them checked out, Xia ruofei brought Ling Qingxue to the restaurant at Shangri – La for some desserts and drinks before driving her back to the headquarters of the Ling Ji restaurant.

At the Ling Ji F & B headquarters, Xia ruofei watched as Ling Qingxue reluctantly walked into the building. Only when her figure disappeared from his sight did Xia ruofei drive off and head straight for Peach Blossom Farm. He calculated the time and realized that President Lin’s plane should have landed by now.

Although Xia ruofei was going to hand over the negotiation to Feng Jing, he still had to meet CEO Lin since he had just arrived at the three mountains.

Not long after Xia ruofei returned to the farm’s office, the veteran on duty at the gate called to report to him that Lei Hu’s car had entered the farm. When Xia ruofei returned, he had specifically instructed him to report immediately when he saw the company’s Mercedes – Benz.

Xia ruofei stood up and beckoned Feng Jing, who was in the office next door, to go downstairs with him.

They had just arrived downstairs when the black Mercedes – Benz slid over silently and stopped in front of the complex.

Without waiting for Lei Hu to open the door, President Lin opened the door and got out of the car. He walked quickly towards Xia ruofei with a warm smile on his face.

“Big brother Lin, you’ve had a long journey!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Brother Xia, your farm is not bad!” As soon as they met, President Lin said,”facing the sea, the environment is quiet and peaceful. It’s simply the best place in the world!”

“If you like it, then stay for a few more days. I have a lot of rooms here!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”brother Lin, let me introduce you. This is our company’s general manager, Feng Jing. I’ve handed over the full responsibility of this cooperation to him.”

“Nice to meet you, President Lin!” Feng Jing had an elegant smile on her face as she reached out her hand to President Lin.

President Lin looked at the young, beautiful, and elegant Feng Jing and couldn’t help but reveal a trace of surprise in his eyes. He originally thought that Feng Jing was Xia ruofei’s assistant or secretary, but he didn’t expect her to be the company’s general manager.

Of course, Mr. Lin’s surprise was short – lived. He quickly shook hands with Feng Jing and smiled,””CEO Feng, nice to meet you!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”big brother Lin, let’s go upstairs and talk!” I’ve already had the meeting room prepared!”

Hence, Xia ruofei and the rest walked into the complex.

As they entered, Xia ruofei called Lei Hu to his side and whispered to him to inform pang Hao to prepare another room. President Lin had brought a female assistant with him this time. Although Xia ruofei could see that there was something going on between the two of them, they could not possibly be arranged to share a room!

Lei Hu accepted the order and left. Xia ruofei took a few quick steps to catch up with Feng Rao and the rest.

Everyone came to the company’s conference room. The marketing director, Xiao Qiang, was already waiting in the conference room with several employees of the administrative team.

Seeing Xia ruofei, Feng Jing, and CEO Lin coming in together, Xiao Qiang and the others quickly stood up.

Xia ruofei stretched out his hand and gestured for everyone to sit down.

Then, he smiled at President Lin and said,””Brother Lin, I’ve already given director Feng full responsibility for this cooperation. You guys have a good chat. I won’t join in the fun!”

President Lin showed a surprised expression and asked,””Brother Xia, you ... You don’t want to hear it?”

President Lin thought that Xia ruofei was just talking and would definitely check on such a big matter personally. He did not expect Xia ruofei to be so carefree that he did not even participate in the first contact and negotiation between the two parties.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”there’s no need for that. You guys can talk first!” I’ve arranged a welcome party for you in the company’s cafeteria. Let’s have a good chat over lunch!”

After that, Xia ruofei nodded to everyone and left the meeting room.

Feng Jing, Xiao Qiang, and the others were already used to Xia ruofei’s style, so they were not surprised. President Lin and his female assistant looked at each other and sat down in their seats uncomfortably.

“President Lin, our Chairman has already informed me of the specific situation.” Feng Jing got straight to the point.”This time, we’re going to finalize the details of our cooperation. We’d like to hear Tongren Hall’s thoughts first.”

……

While the negotiations were still going on in the meeting room, Xia ruofei called pang Hao to his office and asked him to personally arrange for a welcome banquet in the evening.

Xia ruofei had specifically instructed pang Hao to use the freshest Taoyuan vegetables for dinner. They had to go directly to the greenhouse to pick them. As for beef and mutton, they were all readily available in the canteen. He just had to ask Cao tieshu’s wife to prepare a table full of the best dishes.

Then, Xia ruofei returned to the villa and took out five bottles of Drunken Eight Immortals from the medium. Although there were no spirit Heart Flower petals, Xia ruofei had bought these bottles of wine from Ding Feng winery. They had been in the medium for a long time and were of a much higher quality than the one – month Drunken Eight Immortals that were currently sold in the market.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and took out three large grass carp from the medium. He packed them in a bag and brought them to the company’s cafeteria with the Drunken Eight Immortals wine.

These grass carps were caught by Xia ruofei when he was cleaning the fish pond previously. Although they had been dead for a long time, the invisible preservation effect of the interspace kept them in their freshest state, no different from the fish that had just been caught and killed.

Pang Hao was in the canteen, preparing for the welcoming banquet. Xia ruofei had handed over the fish and Drunken Eight Immortals wine to him and asked Cao tieshu’s wife to use the three large grass carp as the main dish. A home – cooked meal would do. These top – grade ingredients did not require any heaven – shaking and earth – weeping culinary skills to make a taste that would make one drool.

After making the arrangements, Xia ruofei went back to his office to surf the internet. At Sixo’ clock, the meeting finally ended. Xia ruofei heard the noise and walked out of the office.

“Big brother Lin, how’s the discussion going?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile as he saw Mr. Lin walking towards him.

President Lin smiled bitterly and said,””Brother Xia, I finally know why you’re a boss who doesn’t have to do anything. Your President Feng ... Is really amazing!”
