Chapter 436: Grasshoppers on a rope (3)

Even Lu You herself did not realize that she actually knew how to speak with such a coquettish expression. Moreover, the other party was a boy.

Xia ruofei was also a little dazed. In the past, although Lu You had a cold and elegant temperament, she always gave people the impression of being unruly. The Lu You that Xia ruofei met these few times would occasionally reveal a little girl’s side.

In all fairness, Lu You’s occasional pouting expression added to her beauty.

“I just saw that you were a little uneasy, so I made a little joke to ease your tension.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I didn’t expect you to take it seriously ...”

“I’m too lazy to bother with you ...”

The car quickly drove into the municipal Party committee’s compound. Lu You’s car had a pass, so they let her in at the entrance.

The two of them walked side by side into the municipal Party Committee Office building. When they took the elevator up, Lu You looked at the number of floors that kept increasing, and she became more and more nervous.

Very quickly, the two of them arrived at Tian Huilan’s office. The outer room was where the Secretary worked. Xiao Mei was rather surprised to see Lu You and Xia ruofei walking in together. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

It was obvious that Tian Huilan’s schedule didn’t have such an arrangement.

“Sister Xiao, is my mom here?” Lu You asked softly, a little nervous.

As the Secretary, Xiao Mei was naturally familiar with Tian Huilan’s family. However, she had the impression that this was Lu You’s first time in Tian Huilan’s office.

“Youyou,” she said,”the Secretary is meeting the officers from the Public Security Bureau. Should I go in and ask the Secretary?”

“No need, no need!” Lu You hurriedly said,”let’s just wait here for a while.”

Lu You couldn’t wait for Tian Huilan to be busy the entire day. That way, she wouldn’t have time to reprimand her.

Xiao Mei smiled and nodded. She then smiled at Xia ruofei and started to prepare tea for the two.

Lu You and Xia ruofei sat in Xiao Mei’s office and waited for about twenty minutes before the door of Tian Huilan’s office was opened. The director of the city’s Public Security Bureau, Chen Bo, and Qin Xiaoyu walked out one after another.

When Qin Xiao Yu saw Lu You, she was obviously stunned for a moment. A trace of guilt flashed in her eyes. After all, she was the one who sold her best friend out. Although she had no choice, she still felt very embarrassed.

“Youyou ...” Qin Xiao Yu called out.

Qin Xiao Yu wanted to say something but stopped herself because her superior Chen Bo was also there.

Lu You smiled at Qin Xiaoyu naturally and called out affectionately,””Sister Xiaoyu, you’re here to report on work?”

Qin Xiao Yu looked at Lu You with a complicated expression and then at Xia ruofei who was beside her. She said,””Yes, I’m here with our chief to accept a mission.”

Chen Bo also nodded at Xia ruofei and Lu You with a kind expression. Although Tian Huilan had always kept a low profile and he did not know Lu You’s identity, he had a deep impression of Xia ruofei. Previously, at the Changping County’s Linhai police station, Tian Huilan, who was still the mayor at the time, had personally brought him over for Xia ruofei’s matter.

The two of them exchanged a few words in Xiao Mei’s office.

Chen Bo and Qin Xiaoyu were in a hurry to go back and deploy the special operation to crack down on the underworld and evil, while Lu You and Xia ruofei were still thinking about meeting Tian Huilan later, so no one was in the mood to chat. Soon, Chen Bo left with Qin Xiaoyu.

Lu You and Xia ruofei walked to the door of Tian Huilan’s office to arrange for their daughter to meet her mother. Naturally, there was no need for the Secretary to inform them. Lu You directly raised her hand and knocked on the door, then walked into Tian Huilan’s office with Xia ruofei.
