After lying on the bed, Xia ruofei felt a wave of fatigue hit him and he quickly fell asleep.

When Xia ruofei woke up the next morning, he saw that Li Yifu was already up.

Seeing Xia ruofei stand up, Li Yifu quickly walked over and bowed.””Senior granduncle, you’re up.”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes!” You slept so late last night, why didn’t you sleep a little more in the morning?”

“I don’t sleep as much as I get older,” said Li Yifu.”I woke up just as the sun rose.”

“Senior granduncle,” Li Yifu continued,”do you have a plan to deal with Luo Qingfeng?”

Yesterday, when Xia ruofei asked Wang Boshan and Zheng Yongshou, Li Yifu was there the whole time, so he was very clear about the current situation. He knew that the key to the problem was Luo Qingfeng.

However, Luo Qingfeng was a golden core cultivator. Compared to Luo Qingfeng, Zheng Yongshou, who was at Level 7 of the Qi refinement realm, was like a Firefly compared to the bright moon. Even though the Taixu xuanqing formation had given Li Yifu a lot of confidence, his heart could not help but beat like a drum when he thought of Luo Qingfeng’s cultivation.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”I have a General Plan.” “But don’t rush. Luo Qingfeng is thousands of miles away, and he has given the task to Wang Boshan and Zheng Yongshou. He definitely won’t start urging us now, so we still have enough time. This matter must be planned properly, and there can’t be any mistakes!”

“Yes!” Li Yifu said,”that’s a golden core cultivator ... Just thinking about it makes me feel intimidated.”

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”in front of the Taixu xuanqing formation, an early Aurous core cultivator can’t do much. The problem now is how to make him defenseless on the Peach Blossom Island.” I’ve already come up with a preliminary plan, but that’s not the priority right now. We need to evacuate everyone on the island!”

“Everyone is retreating?” Li Yifu asked.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”there is no point for them to stay. Once we start to deal with Luo Qingfeng, we have to consider the possible changes. These ordinary people will only be a burden if they stay here.”

There were three groups of people on the island. The brothers of the Hong sect were brought here to carry out the modification project. It turned out that the staff of the Paradise Island were in charge of the daily operation of the island. And then there was the International mercenaries.

The reason why Xia ruofei kept these people was, on one hand, for the preliminary work; On the other hand, it was to minimize the possibility of the secret being leaked.

Now that Wang Boshan and Zheng Yongshou had become his soul slaves, he didn’t have to be so careful in keeping it a secret. After all, those who could really find out the news were people like Wang Boshan. Although his cultivation was low, he had a lot of power in the secular world.

As for Luo Qingfeng, these cultivators were all far away from the mortal world. The news of the star Seizer sect’s mortal world was all passed back by Wang Boshan. Luo Qingfeng would never have dreamed that Wang Boshan would betray him, so it was naturally impossible for him to arrange for someone else to deliberately inquire about the information of the Peach Blossom Island.

Therefore, if these ordinary people were dismissed, there would be no hidden dangers.

“Yes!” Li Yifu nodded. I’ll make the arrangements immediately!”

The dismissal of the staff sounded complicated, but it wasn’t difficult to execute.

As for the International mercenaries, the fees paid by the Liu family had not expired yet. They could end the mission ahead of time and leave this isolated island without any entertainment, and they would not have to refund the money. They were overjoyed.

Li Yifu had asked the brothers of the Hong sect to help him. Now that their work was over, they were supposed to go back to their own places. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Xia ruofei personally went to Liu Qingfeng’s side to inform him. In the past two days, more than 50 staff members had actually been moved to live in the shelter inside the mountain.

When Liu Qingfeng heard that Xia ruofei wanted all the staff to leave, he was only a little worried about the daily operation of Paradise Island. After all, the airport control and some equipment maintenance staff needed very professional people to take on the responsibility. If they dismissed everyone now, wouldn’t Paradise Island be paralyzed?

However, after seeing Xia ruofei’s firm attitude, Liu Qingfeng did not say anything more. He immediately began to actively organize the work of returning to the country.

After all, the Liu family had already prepared a good position for him. The only request was for him to fully obey Xia ruofei’s management on Peach Blossom Island and do the aftermath well. Now that Xia ruofei had taken the initiative to ask everyone to leave, he could return to the bustling capital immediately and grasp more power. Why not?

Under normal circumstances, one had to take a boat and then transfer to another plane to return to China from Paradise Island, which was very troublesome. There were many people who wanted to leave the island this time, so it was not easy to organize them.

However, Li Yifu directly contacted Tang Yitian and asked him to book three Qinba passenger planes from Australia to Peach Blossom Island. The employees of the Liu family and the brothers of the Hong sect each took one of the chartered planes and flew directly to Australia.

After landing in Australia, the Liu family’s employees naturally transferred back to their country. The brothers of the Hong sect also returned to their respective places. Li Yifu asked Tang Yitian to arrange everyone’s itinerary.

The International mercenary group, because they had a lot of weapons and equipment, naturally did not go to Australia for a transit flight. According to their request, Australian Airlines Chartered a plane to send them to another island country in the South Pacific.

This mercenary group had been operating in that island country for many years. Going there was equivalent to returning to their base camp. They naturally had a way to return to their old nest.

When the last Chartered plane took off on Peach Blossom Island’s runway and soared into the sky under the sunset, the entire Peach Blossom Island suddenly became quiet.

There was no one in the airport tower or on the runway. The dock was also quiet.

There were only three people left on the entire Peach Blossom Island. They were Xia ruofei, Li Yifu, and benilatti, who was actually useless. The rest of the crew had all left, including the helicopter pilot who wanted to stay and work.

“Alright, we don’t have to live in the warehouse anymore!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”let’s move to another place!”

Although the project department building was empty, the basic living facilities did not need to be maintained every day.

The island’s electricity mainly relied on solar and wind power, so it was basically self – sufficient. When there was a shortage of power, they also had diesel generators.

Now that there was no one on the island, the electricity consumption had dropped significantly, and solar energy was enough.

There was no problem with water and food. There was also a large cold storage in the sanctuary in the mountain. The food stored in it was enough for three people to eat for several years.

Xia ruofei asked benilatti to find a guest room to stay in while he brought Li Yifu to the luxury suite that he was originally living in.

When Xia ruofei took out the peach blossom Da Hong Pao, Li Yifu naturally didn’t dare to let his senior granduncle make the tea himself. He quickly took the tea leaves and started to boil water and make the tea.

The two of them sat at the coffee table, drinking tea and discussing Xia ruofei’s plan.

This time, Xia ruofei did not hide anything from Li Yifu. On the contrary, he felt that Li Yifu had lived for a long time and had been in charge of a huge Financial Group for a long time. He should have more experience.

Luring Luo Qingfeng to the Paradise Island actually had little to do with cultivation. It was more of an analysis from the perspective of human nature, such as whether Luo Qingfeng would fall for a trap, whether he would have doubts, how he would react, how he would deal with it, and so on.

When Li Yifu heard Xia ruofei reveal the whole plan, he couldn’t help but nod and say,””Senior granduncle, you’ve considered it very carefully. You’ve thought of almost all the possibilities ...”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”don’t say that. I want your opinion now. The plan is definitely not perfect. If you have any problems or doubts, you can tell me. It’s better to find a loophole now than to have it discovered by Luo Qingfeng, right?”
