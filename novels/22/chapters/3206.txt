Secondly, Xia ruofei and the others had already deciphered the floating point diagrams once. If the information provided by Xia ruofei was true and the floating point diagrams were different each time, it meant that the number combinations that were deciphered would be different as well. In the end, it would mean that a new song would be produced!

Chen Nanfeng pondered for a long time before finally saying,””This means that every three hundred and fifty years or so, the token will provide a completely different song! What does this mean?”

“Sect leader Chen, I’ll analyze the situation first!” Xia ruofei said after some thought.

“Alright, we’re all ears!” Chen Nanfeng quickly said.

It seemed that Xia ruofei had more information than them. Chen Nanfeng and the others would naturally pay attention to Xia ruofei’s analysis of the situation.

Xia ruofei said,”the most direct understanding is that different music pieces provide different information. Otherwise, it would not be so troublesome.”

Everyone nodded in agreement.

Xia ruofei continued,”most of you here have experienced the experience on the moon. I personally feel that ... This song should be playing the role of a map.” In other words, there might really be such a mysterious realm on the dark side of the moon. If we follow the music we heard and find the ring – shaped mountain, we might be able to enter the mysterious realm. ”

Everyone revealed a thoughtful expression.

In fact, Xia ruofei’s deduction was the most direct. It was also the first possibility that everyone thought of after receiving so much information.

“Fellow Daoist Xia, do you mean that we should explore the moon?” Chen Nanfeng asked after a moment of silence.

Although golden core stage cultivators could already ride their flying swords, they were still far from being able to fly in the sky and burrow into the ground. They were even more impossible to fly out of the atmosphere and enter outer space. As for the distance between the moon and earth, for golden core stage cultivators, it was even more distant.

In fact, to Chen Nanfeng and the other older cultivators, the moon was only a concept in the legends that they had heard of when they were young.

If there really was such a mystical realm on the moon, could it be the legendary Moon Palace?

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””The only way to verify this guess is to find that crater and try to open a secret realm.”

In fact, if they could find the crater, they could basically confirm that the illusion created by the music was real and not a virtual image.

“It’s not easy to go to the moon,”Chen Nanfeng said with a slight frown.

“Let’s not discuss this for now. ” Xia ruofei said,”sect leader Chen, we are now analyzing which one is the most likely. As for how to achieve it, that is the next step.”

Chen Nanfeng nodded in agreement and said,””Fellow Daoist Xia, please continue.”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”back to the token.” As I said just now, the change in the floating point pattern of the token means that even if we collect another five tokens in 50 years, we should get a different song. According to his experience, the message conveyed by the new song should be different. What does this mean?”

After Xia ruofei asked this question, he looked at everyone quietly and waited for them to think about it.

Everyone present was an elite in the world of cultivation, so there was no need to think hard about such a simple question. Soon, Mu Sheng’s face slightly changed and he said,””Changing the floating point pattern means changing the song. This means that the entrance to the secret plane on the moon may not be completely fixed. The next time a new song appears, it should be conveying information about the new secret plane entrance! “In this way, all the seemingly unreasonable situations have a reasonable explanation!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”I have the same thoughts as sect leader mu. I think the disappearance of the token has already sounded the alarm for us. That is the secret realm that might exist on the moon. The location of the entrance might change very soon. When that time comes, even if we find the crater, we might not be able to get anything! And the token that we’ve worked so hard to obtain, and the song that we’ve spent so much effort to decipher, will also become worthless!”

“That’s right.” Chen Nanfeng nodded and said,”although I didn’t see the scene you described with my own eyes, the design of the token to convey the message is so exquisite. I’m afraid that Mystic realm must be very impressive! If he could enter, he would definitely gain a lot! Fellow Daoist Xia, do you mean that ... We should set off as soon as possible to find the entrance to the secret realm?”

Xia ruofei nodded.”That’s right. Since we know that the entrance might move, we have to hurry!”

Mu Sheng smiled bitterly and said,”that’s true, but how can we get to the moon?” Even if it’s with the help of a flying boat, I’m afraid only sect leader Chen has the ability to do so!”

Chen Nanfeng also revealed a bitter smile and said,””Brother mu, you really think too highly of me! Even a nascent soul expert would find it difficult to reach the moon safely, let alone a mere late Jindan like me. When they left the ground to a certain height, the air would become very thin, or even completely without air. In such an environment, Yuanying stage Masters could not survive for a long time. Moreover ... The moon is too far away from here ...”

Xia ruofei said,”the moon is one of Earth’s satellites. It’s the closest to us among all the extraterrestrial planets. However, it’s only relative. The moon has always been revolving around earth. Its closest distance to us is about 363000 kilometers, which is 726000 miles. At its furthest, the distance between Earth and the Moon was 405000 kilometers, which was 810000 li ...”

For modern people, this information was basically common knowledge. Even if they did not know the exact data, the search engine was so convenient now that they could find out by simply checking the internet.

In fact, on the day Xia ruofei finished listening to the song, he had already searched for information about the moon on the internet. Hence, the data was readily available to him.

Xia ruofei’s words made everyone fall silent.

Even for cultivators who could ride flying swords, a distance of 700000 to 800000 li was an extremely long distance.

The speed of a cultivator’s flying sword was faster than a commercial plane, but it was far from enough to cover a distance of seven to eight hundred thousand miles.

Chen Nanfeng furrowed his brows and said, ” if I fly on a sword, I can fly about four to five thousand li in two hours. Even if I don’t sleep or rest, it will take me four hundred hours to cover seven to eight hundred thousand li ... That’s sixteen to seventeen days ... And it’s impossible for me to fly at full speed for sixteen to seventeen days in a row. The vital Qi in my body can’t support such a long time of flight. Even if I take breaks in between, I can’t fly this long in a month! ”

” Brother Chen’s flying speed is already extremely fast, ” Mu Sheng said with a wry smile. ” If I were to fly, I wouldn’t be able to fly for another half a month! ”

Xia ruofei said,” actually, the long distance is just one aspect. There are bigger difficulties!” As sect leader Chen said, the higher the altitude, the thinner the air. In fact, the Earth’s atmosphere is only about 2000 li thick. In other words, if you go above 2000 Li, you will be in an absolute vacuum that you can’t breathe.”

In fact, other than the fact that it was impossible to breathe in outer space, danger was everywhere, including cosmic rays, ultra-low temperatures, and so on. Moreover, if humans were exposed to a vacuum, their internal organs would definitely explode instantly due to the pressure difference. Even if a cultivator’s body was strong, they could not survive in such an environment for a long time. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

However, not being able to breathe was already a big problem. Xia ruofei naturally did not need to explain the dangers of outer space.
