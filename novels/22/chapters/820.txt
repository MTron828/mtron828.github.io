Chapter 821: The unscrupulous reporter (1)

Translator: 549690339

Squad leader Luo had long been buried in peace. At this time, his family naturally couldn’t help him with his funeral.

That was, someone in squad leader Luo’s family had passed away again. What on earth was going on?

Xia ruofei’s heart trembled as he thought, Could it be that sister – in – Law did something stupid in a moment of folly?

However, he quickly denied his own guess. If Lin Yue ‘e was all alone, then it was possible. However, she and squad leader Luo’s daughter, Nan Nan, was only six or seven years old. No matter how miserable Lin Yue’ e was, she would definitely not commit suicide for the sake of her child.

A human’s maternal instinct was very great.

Xia ruofei asked with a serious expression,”Sir, what’s going on?” Squad leader Luo’s family ... Did someone die?”

The old man with the fan sighed and said, “It’s Zhicheng’s mother ... Her body wasn’t good to begin with, and after hearing about Zhicheng’s matter, she suddenly ...”

Xia ruofei frowned and asked,””Haven’t you been keeping the news from the two elders? How could that be?”

A villager next to him said angrily,””It’s all that reporter’s fault! After hearing about Zhicheng’s matter, the villagers all helped to hide the news. When Zhicheng’s family held a funeral, they even sent the two elders to Zhicheng’s sister’s place. Moreover, the place was strictly guarded. They even deliberately broke the TV, afraid that the two elders would see the news. “But a reporter from Yuzhang somehow found Zhicheng’s sister’s house. Zhicheng’s sister happened to go to the village entrance to buy vegetables, and the reporter took advantage of the loophole. The reporter came up and told them about Zhicheng’s sacrifice. He even wanted to interview the two elders. Zhicheng’s mother fainted at the time ...”

A few of the villagers also talked about what happened that day, all of them filled with righteous indignation.

Xia ruofei’s face turned green when he heard this. He asked,””My fellow townsmen, do you know the name of this reporter? What unit are you from?”

The old man with the fan said,””I don’t know his name, but the town leaders call him reporter Qiu. I heard that he’s from the provincial television station’s entertainment channel ...”

Xia ruofei’s lungs were about to explode when he heard this. A reporter from an entertainment channel had come to join in the fun and even said everything without holding back. It was meaningless for everyone to hide the truth from the old man out of goodwill. Even the mother of the monitor, old Luo, could not take it and passed away. It was simply too infuriating.

Nowadays, some reporters had no news ethics or news ethics at all. They would do anything to attract attention.

Whenever there was an accident or case, as long as there were casualties, there would be reporters interviewing the family members of the deceased. They would also ask about the details of the deceased without any scruples. There was a psychological stress period when a family member passed away, and this kind of interview was simply a kind of devastation to their already fragile mentality.

Some of them were in a state of calmness, but as soon as they were interviewed, they immediately burst into tears and grieved.

And some reporters couldn’t wait for the victim’s relatives to act like this, and their cameras were all waiting to capture such a scene.

This kind of behavior was no different from re – opening the wounds of the family members of the deceased and then cruelly displaying it in front of the public. It was simply inhumane!

This time’s matter was even worse. The two old men didn’t know about squad leader Luo’s sacrifice at all, and their family also strictly guarded it and used various methods to block the news. All their efforts were destroyed by an entertainment reporter’s light words.

And it also caused a serious direct consequence. The mother of squad leader Luo couldn’t take the blow and passed away.

“Provincial entertainment channel, your surname is Qiu, right?” Xia ruofei’s eyes lit up. He nodded and said,”thank you. I’ll go to sister-in-law’s house first!” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

With that, Xia ruofei walked in the direction that the old man had pointed.

After a short while, Xia ruofei saw a White Lantern hanging at the door of a house from afar. He could also hear the faint sound of suona.

Xia ruofei knew that it should be the home of the monitor, old Luo. He hurried to the door.

This was one of the small courtyards that were common in the countryside a few years ago. It had a low mud wall and a somewhat old wooden door. Through the half – Open door, one could see the scene in the courtyard. There was only one small bungalow inside, with a total of three rooms. The left and right sides were bedrooms, and the middle was the central room. There was also a simple kitchen, toilet, and so on.

A dark red coffin was placed in the middle of the central room. Smoke curled up from it, and a few people could be vaguely seen sitting there, chanting suona. The White lanterns at the entrance of the courtyard and the yellow paper talismans pasted on the door beam also added a bit of sorrow to the atmosphere.

Xia ruofei strode into the courtyard and saw Lin Yue ‘e coming out of the kitchen with some snacks.

When she saw Xia ruofei, she was stunned. After a while, she called out,””RUO Fei, why are you here?”

Xia ruoxin quickly walked over and took the snacks from Lin Yue ‘E’s hands. She reproached her and asked,””Sister – in – Law, why didn’t you tell us that such a big thing happened at home?”

Lin Yue ‘e lowered her head and said,”it’s nothing much. I can handle it on my side ...”

This strong woman had always used her weak spine to bear all the hardships. She had never thought of asking her husband’s old army and comrades for help.

Xia ruofei knew that Lin Yue ‘e was a strong – headed woman. He sighed and said,””Sister – in – Law, let’s talk inside the house!”

The two of them entered the house, and Xia ruofei placed the desserts on the offering table. He then pulled Lin Yue ‘e to the side and asked,””Sister – in – Law, where is Nan Nan?”

“I sent it to my cousin’s house in the neighboring village.” Lin Yue ‘e said,”the house is too chaotic. I really can’t take care of it ...”

“Oh ...” Xia ruofei nodded and asked,”sister – in – Law, how did this happen all of a sudden?” I heard from the villagers at the village entrance that it was a reporter who revealed the truth. What’s the situation?”

Lin Yue ‘e said with a bitter expression,”ruofei, this is also my fault. My family had to arrange Zhicheng’s funeral, so they could only send the two elders to my sister-in-law’s house. In order to hide it from the two elders, I didn’t even let my sister – in – Law come over when Zhicheng was buried. I didn’t expect such a thing to happen ...”

Xia ruofei asked angrily,”do you know anything about this bullsh * t reporter?” I’ll go find him!”

“Forget it, RUO Fei.” Lin Yue ‘e said,”things have already happened. It’s useless to look for him ...”

“But we can’t just let it go like this!” Xia ruofei gritted his teeth and said,”this kind of scumbag doesn’t deserve to be a reporter. I’ll beat the sh * t out of him when I find him!”

“Hitting someone is illegal ...” Lin Yue ‘e hurriedly said,”ruofei, you mustn’t do anything stupid!” If old Luo knew, he would never let you do this ...”

“Sis – in – Law ...” Xia ruofei said.

At this moment, a middle – aged woman ran out of the house on the east side in a panic. She said in a choked voice,””Yue ‘e, quickly come over and take a look. Our Father also seems to be ...”

Lin Yue ‘E’s expression changed. She couldn’t be bothered to talk to Xia ruofei anymore and quickly ran towards the east Room.

Xia ruofei’s expression changed as well, and he quickly followed.

In the dimly lit East Room, an old man in his 70s or 80s was lying on the bed, coughing violently. He gasped for breath, but he seemed to be unable to breathe. His mouth was wide open in pain, and his face had already turned gray.

“Dad ...” Lin Yue ‘e cried out sorrowfully as she pounced on the bed.”Dad, don’t scare me ...”

The middle – aged woman should be squad leader Luo’s sister. At this time, she was also helpless and could only stand aside and wipe her tears.

Xia ruofei knew that the old man on the bed must be the Father of old Luo. He could tell that the old man was in great danger and was on the verge of death.

Xia ruofei didn’t dare to be slow. He quickly stepped forward and said loudly,””Sister – in – Law, make way! I know a little about medicine, let me see uncle Luo ...”

When Lin Yue ‘e heard this, she was like a drowning person who had grabbed onto a life – saving straw. She hurriedly stood up.

Xia ruofei immediately stepped forward and reached into his backpack. With a thought, he took out a bottle of diluted solution from the spirit Heart Flower petals.

However, uncle Luo was coughing badly and Xia ruofei could not feed him directly. He first put the porcelain bottle containing the solution of the spirit Heart Flower petals aside, then helped uncle Luo up and gently patted his back.

This action seemed ordinary, but in fact, there was a lot of attention to it.

Xia ruofei had been studying Chinese medicine theories by himself for the past year. He had only been hitting a few acupuncture points on the human body, which were very effective in temporarily suppressing coughing.

At this time, squad leader Luo’s sister slowly recovered and asked in a low voice,””Yue ‘e, who is this little descendant?”

Lin Yue ‘e looked nervously at her father – in – Law, who was panting heavily on the bed, and replied,””Big sister, this is a comrade from Zhicheng’s Army ...”

“He’s a doctor?”

“I don’t know ... He wasn’t when he was in the Army, but he left the Army last year.” Lin Yue ‘e said.

Squad leader Luo’s sister’s heart had already been slightly relieved, but when she heard this, she couldn’t help but become nervous again.

At this time, uncle Luo had stopped coughing, but he still had some difficulty breathing. Xia ruofei did not dare to be slow. He quickly opened the porcelain bottle and said loudly in uncle Luo’s ear,””Sir, I have a bottle of special medicine here. You must drink it all, understand?”

Uncle Luo’s eyes showed a trace of gratitude and he nodded with great effort.

Xia ruofei hurriedly placed the porcelain bottle in front of uncle Luo’s mouth. With one hand supporting the back of his head, he helped uncle Luo to finish the entire solution.

Lin Yue ‘e and squad leader Luo’s sister looked at uncle Luo nervously. After taking the medicine that Xia ruofei took out, his breathing gradually stabilized, and the color of his face began to return.

Although the two of them were not doctors, they could see that uncle Luo seemed to have survived the crisis.

“Ruofei, thank you!” Lin Yue ‘e said.

Xia ruofei turned around and smiled at Lin Yue ‘e before asking,””Sister – in – Law, what’s the situation with the old man’s body? Did you get a doctor to check it?”

Lin Yue ‘e and squad leader Luo’s sister looked at each other and sighed in unison.
