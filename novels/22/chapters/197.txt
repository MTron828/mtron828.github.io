Chapter 198: Palpitating heart (1)

Ling Qingxue was a little shy and flustered at the same time. She quickly glanced at Xia ruofei, then immediately lowered her gaze and asked,””What do you mean by that? Didn’t you ask me to come over when I’m free?” “I didn’t say that,” Xia ruofei said,”I’m just curious when we became lovers. You’ve waited for me for seven years when I joined the Army, and we’ve started since junior high ... Hey! Then wouldn’t I be in a relationship?” Ling Qingxue chuckled and glanced at Xia ruofei.””Are you suffering a great loss from what I said? Is it degrading for you to be in a relationship with the second high school’s Belle?” Xia ruofei could not help but smile bitterly.”That’s not what I meant. It’s just that ... We haven’t ... Why did you say that?” “I ... I wanted to play a joke on Qiao’ er, but I didn’t expect aunty to come out later ...” Ling Qingxue said.”You saw the scene at that time. How could I deny it at that time? I can only suffer for a while!” “It’s that simple?” Xia ruofei looked at Ling Qingxue and asked. Ling Qingxue didn’t dare to look at Xia ruofei. She turned around and looked to the side before saying,””It’s that simple!” Xia ruofei felt that something was not right. In fact, Ling Qingxue’s explanation was full of loopholes and unreasonable in many ways. This included Ling Qingxue’s sudden visit today, which made Xia ruofei feel that it was very abrupt. However, other than the reason that Ling Qingxue had mentioned, Xia ruofei could not think of any other reason for her to do so. At this time, Ling Qingxue also seemed to feel that her reason was too weak to be convincing, so she also looked around nervously. When she saw the huge fish tank in the corner of the living room, she quickly said,””Ruofei, haven’t you always been curious why I suddenly came up to our house?” “Yes, that’s right!” Xia ruofei said,”I remember you saying that the company will be very busy before the 15th day of the first lunar month.” “There! It’s because of them!” Ling Qingxue pointed at the pair of blood red Dragons in the fish tank and said,”do you know that the pair of blood red Dragons in your family has already gone viral on the internet? I saw a post on the internet and found out that the red Arowana were raised in your house, so I came over after lunch ...” Xia ruofei was shocked. Online? I just got this pair of Red Arowana this morning. How could it be on the internet?” If Xia ruofei had really bought the pair of blood red Dragons from outside, he would not have been so surprised. It was possible that the seller had taken photos of them and posted them on the internet. But it was clearly not! This pair of Red Arowana had always been kept in the medium. They were both very small when they were bought! The female fish was barely alive at that time. If Xia ruofei had not bought it, it might have died on the same day. How could they possibly appear on the internet again? “Yup! I saw it in my dad’s office. ” Ling Qingxue saw that she had successfully changed the topic, so she immediately smiled and said,”my dad is a super Arowana fan. He visits the Arowana Summit forum every day. I saw the photo on the forum today and immediately recognized that it was your house ...” “The peak of the Dragonfish, right? “Let me see ...” Xia ruofei said. As he spoke, he took out his phone and quickly opened the browser. He searched for the keyword ‘Dragon Peak’ and found the Dragon Peak forum. The post by Fishman No. 1 was directly at the most eye – catching position on the home page, and the name was also very obvious: “a top – tier Blood Red Dragon appears in Sanshan city. There are pictures and the truth.” Hence, Xia ruofei found the post almost immediately. At that moment, Ling Qingxue suddenly realized something and quickly said,””Ruofei, don’t look ...” However, it was too late. Xia ruofei had already opened the post. He didn’t read the text but went straight to the photo. He couldn’t help but laugh.”Hey! Wasn’t this the photo Qiao’ er took this morning? She just posted it on her moments! How did it get reposted online?” Ling Qingxue’s face was burning. She peeked at Xia ruofei nervously, hoping that Xia ruofei would not notice anything. Xia ruofei didn’t notice anything wrong with Ling Qingxue. He smiled and mumbled to himself as he looked at her,””Woof! Quite a lot of people were following this! There are already dozens of pages of replies ... It must be one of Qiao’ er’s friends who reposted it online ... Hey! There really was an expert! Just based on Qiao’ er’s photo, she really managed to calculate the length of my Arowana! However, the mosaic was too big! I can only vaguely see that Qiao’ er is a woman ...” At this point, Xia ruofei suddenly stopped. An idea flashed through his mind, and he couldn’t help but look up at Ling Qingxue. Ling Qingxue avoided Xia ruofei’s gaze guiltily. Xia ruofei’s brain was spinning fast. The scene of Ling Qingxue’s sudden appearance at the farm appeared in his mind, especially the abnormal behavior of Ling Qingxue after she entered the house. He looked at the photo of Lin Qiao on his phone screen ... Xia ruofei felt that he had found a string of things that he could not understand. Everything suddenly became clear, and he seemed to have found a reasonable answer to all his questions. He was still looking at Ling Qingxue, but the smile in his eyes was getting stronger. At first, Ling Qingxue avoided Xia ruofei’s gaze. However, after being stared at by Xia ruofei for a long time, she finally glared at him and asked,””Why do you keep looking at me?” “Qingxue, I think I know why you’re here ...” Xia ruofei said with a smile. “You’re not allowed to say anything!” Ling Qingxue’s face was red as she shouted. Xia ruofei’s smile widened,”alright!” If you don’t want me to tell you ... Then I won’t ...” Xia ruofei’s smile made Ling Qingxue even more embarrassed, especially Xia ruofei’s gaze, which made Ling Qingxue’s face blush and her heart beat faster. Finally, she couldn’t help but raise her head and bravely met Xia ruofei’s gaze.””Alright! I admit that I’m a petty and suspicious silly woman! Don’t laugh at me anymore ...” As she spoke, Ling Qingxue’s eyes started to get wet. Xia ruofei saw the tears in the eyes of this beautiful lady with long legs. He thought of all the things she had done for him and suddenly felt a rush of excitement. He didn’t want to wait another moment ... Under Ling Qingxue’s surprised gaze, Xia ruofei stepped forward and hugged her tightly in his arms. Ling Qingxue was stunned. Then, like a Frightened Rabbit, she tried to break free from Xia ruofei’s arms. “What are you doing ... You’re a hooligan!” She even said. Xia ruofei didn’t say another word. He lowered his head and sealed Ling Qingxue’s moving red lips with his ...
