Chapter 3694: The seven Star Pavilion opens (1)

Translator: 549690339

Chen Xuan was stunned for a moment before he forced out a smile.””! really can’t guarantee that… There are two reasons. First, the disciples of the first heaven society all enter the seven Star Pavilion when they’re still in the Qi condensation stage. Second, it’s normal for some golden core cultivators to be unable to improve their talent after entering the seven Star Pavilion. I can only say that, in theory, everyone who enters the seven Star Pavilion for the first time will have the opportunity to improve their cultivation talent.”

Hearing this, Liu Mansha nodded her head thoughtfully. After a moment, she smiled and said,”This is a good opportunity! Sect leader Chen is so considerate!” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Liu Mansha’s talent was actually not very high. The reason she had been able to achieve what she had today was actually related to a fortuitous encounter. If she could improve her talent in this opportunity to enter the seven Star Pavilion, then her chances of breaking through to the late – Stage of the Golden core realm would be greatly increased. She could even see the hope of reaching the Yuanying realm.

Originally, Liu Mansha did not pay much attention to this kind of all – Round opportunity. After all, it was very difficult for her to improve her cultivation level. Even the first heaven society did not have such great ability.

But if it was to improve one’s talent, it would be completely different.

Thus, Liu Mansha also took this matter to heart.

Mu Sheng was also very happy. He didn’t have much hope for his own cultivation talent to improve, but he still looked forward to his son’s improvement.

As for Shen Hu, Lu You, Yu Xin ‘er, mu Jianfei, and the other Qi refining cultivators, they had never even heard of a treasure like the seven Star Pavilion. They were filled with anticipation, especially when it came to increasing one’s talent.

The atmosphere of the banquet was lifted all of a sudden.

Fine wine, delicacies, and the anticipated opportunity to enter the seven Star Pavilion tomorrow.

Everyone drank and chatted. They finished the table of food that Xia ruofei had prepared and the fine wine that Chen Xuan had given Xia ruofei.

After all, they were all cultivators, and they would not get drunk no matter how much they drank.

After the meal, Chen Xuan and the others bade farewell and left.

Lu You also followed Shen Hu and left Xia ruofei’s courtyard. She did not say anything to Xia ruofei, but Xia ruofei felt that Lu You’s eyes seemed to have a deeper meaning.

It was a quiet night.

The next morning, Zeng Qing brought the service disciples to Xia ruofei’s courtyard with a sumptuous breakfast.

Xia ruofei looked at the dazzling array of breakfast and smiled.””Deacon CEng, I can’t even finish this much food! Let’s sit down and eat!”

Zeng Qing quickly said,”senior Xia, this disciple has already had breakfast. Please enjoy. Eat as much as you want. It doesn’t matter if you can’t finish it and leave behind.”

Xia ruofei didn’t force her. He picked up his chopsticks and shook his head. “That’s a bit too wasteful…”

However, he also understood Zeng Qing’s work, so he sat down and picked a few dishes that he liked and ate them in big mouthfuls. As for the rest, he didn’t touch them. This way, other people could eat them too, and it wouldn’t go to waste.

After breakfast, Zeng Qing asked for Xia ruofei’s permission and took him to Empyrean one Pavilion.

Xia ruofei had been here once. On the day Chen Nanfeng had successfully broken through, the first heaven society had held a huge banquet here.

Today, the cultivators had also arrived very early.

Regardless of whether they had already heard some news or knew nothing about this opportunity, they were all looking forward to it.

“Little brother Xia, over here!”

As soon as Xia ruofei entered the main hall of the Empyrean one Pavilion, he heard Mu Sheng’s forthright voice.

Xia ruofei followed the sound and saw Mu Sheng and mu Jianfei standing in a corner on the right side of the hall. Liu Mansha and Yu xiner were also standing beside them.

Xia ruofei also saw Shen Hu and Lu You.

Shen Hu stood at the side with a somewhat reserved expression. It was obvious that he was invited by Mu Sheng, so he didn’t have the guts to go to Mu Sheng and Liu Mansha.

Xia ruofei waved at Mu Sheng, then smiled at Zeng Qing and said,””Deacon CEng, my friend is over there, so 1’11 head over first. You don’t have to follow me all the time, just go do what you need to do!”

“Alright, then this disciple won’t disturb you any further!” Zeng Qing said respectfully. Senior Xia, you can look for me if you need anything. I’ll be waiting in the side hall!”

Xia ruofei nodded helplessly and said,””Alright then!”

After he sent Zeng Qing away, he immediately walked towards Mu Sheng and said with a smile,””Sect leader mu, Valley master Liu, you’re both so early!” “Haha!” Mu Sheng laughed and said,”if there’s a good thing, I’ll definitely be more active!”

Liu Mansha also smiled and said, “I’m still hoping that I can get the favor of an opportunity this time! Of course, we can’t fall behind!”

“Mr. Xia!” Shen Hu quickly came over and greeted Xia ruofei respectfully.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Hello, sect Master Shen!” Lu You is here too? You’re all clear about today’s opportunity. After you go in, you don’t need to do anything, just use your best cultivation method. Whether or not you can improve your talent will depend on your luck.”

This was what Chen Xuan had told Xia ruofei.

In the past, some of the disciples who entered the seven Star Pavilion did not do anything but stay inside. When they came out, their talent increased by a large margin. However, that was an exception. Most of the disciples who had their talent improved would use their best cultivation techniques in the seven Star Pavilion.

Of course, those disciples did the same later on, and the proportion of people who could get the opportunity to improve their talent actually did not increase much..
