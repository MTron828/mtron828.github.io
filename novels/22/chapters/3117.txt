Song Wei looked at Xia ruofei with a reproachful look. Then, she turned her attention back to the wild tea. She could not help but say,”Ruofei, let’s drink it ourselves and not use wild tea! It’s quite a waste. I think the Da Hong Pao from before was pretty good!”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,””I’m fine! Although the production of wild tea was not high, it could not withstand the power of the time formation! Now we can harvest a batch of tea leaves almost every day, so we won’t be short of wild tea in the future. Also, I brought a lot of wild tea this time. Uncle song has already saved some for himself, so it won’t affect him. ”

Xia ruofei didn’t say where he planted the wild tea or who took care of it. Song Wei and Ling Qingxue didn’t ask further either.

Since Xia ruofei had said so and they really liked the unique fragrance of wild tea, they naturally did not try to stop him.

Soon, Xia ruofei finished boiling the water and made the tea.

The strong fragrance of the wild tea filled the living room. Even Fang Liyun, who was busy in the kitchen, could smell the fragrance of the tea and could not help but take a deep breath. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

The kitchen was filled with all kinds of smells, but these smells could not cover up the fragrance of wild tea.

Xia ruofei and the other two were drinking tea and chatting in the living room.

After that, Xia ruofei simply set up a small sound – proof barrier and sat in the living room to continue explaining the “nichang Heart Sutra” to Song Wei and Ling Qingxue.

It was almost Seveno’ clock in the evening. Xia ruofei heard the sound of a car engine coming from the courtyard, followed by the sound of a door opening.

He scanned the area with his mental power and saw song Qiming step out of the car. He took the briefcase from his Secretary and said calmly,””You’ve worked hard these two days. There’s no work tonight, so go back and have a good rest!”

“Yes! Secretary!” The Secretary said respectfully.

Then, song Qiming walked into the courtyard with his briefcase.

Hence, Xia ruofei stopped explaining and kept the soundproof barrier.

Song Qiming pushed the door open and walked in. As he changed his shoes, he raised his head and said to Xia ruofei, who was in the living room,””RUO Fei is here!”

“Uncle song, how are you?” Xia ruofei called out with a smile.

“Hello, uncle song!” Ling Qingxue greeted him.

“Hello, hello!” Song Qiming chuckled and said,”Qingxue, we welcome you as our guest!”

Song Qiming could not help but sniffle again. He smiled and said,””What a fragrant smell! Did RUO Fei bring any good tea?”

“Yup! It’s a tea from a friend. It tastes pretty good!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue looked at each other, worried.

This was wild tea. As a cultivator, song Qiming knew that Youyou would enter a state of cultivation the first time she drank wild tea.

Furthermore, they had already brewed the wild tea several times. It would be fine if song Qiming did not have any effect after drinking it, but what if the effect was greatly reduced and it no longer worked after drinking it?

Even if Xia ruofei were to brew a new cup of wild tea, song Qiming could not possibly just drink it in the living room and start cultivating. If Fang Liyun were to see this, wouldn’t she be shocked?

Fortunately, at this time, Fang Liyun came out of the kitchen with a big pot of boiled fish. She said while walking,””Old song, don’t drink tea yet. Dinner is ready. You should drink after dinner!”

“Yes, yes, yes!” Song Wei quickly replied. Eat first! Dad, you’re getting off work so late, I’m already famished!”

It was rare for Song Wei to act coquettishly in front of her parents. Song Qiming could not help but laugh and said,”Good, good, good! Since my precious daughter is starving, let’s eat first! Enjoy your tea after dinner!”

Then, song Qiming turned to Xia ruofei and asked,””Ruofei, shall we have a drink tonight?”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”uncle song, let’s not drink tonight.” Other than visiting you and Auntie Fang, I also want to check on your body to see if there are any hidden dangers. If you drink, I’m afraid the test results will be inaccurate ...”

“Then don’t drink!” Fang Liyun quickly said. Old song, you’re too much. All you can think about is drinking. Don’t you have enough to drink when you’re out socializing? It’s not easy for our daughter to come home, and RUO Fei and Qingxue also came to see us. Do you think it’s nice to be drunk?”

Song Qiming forced a smile.”I’m just saying. Even if I want to drink, I’ll only have a few glasses. I’m already so old. How can I compete with ruofei in drinking?”

“Anyway, you’re not allowed to drink tonight!” Fang Liyun said.

Song Qiming clearly knew how to get along with his wife well. He knew that it was unwise to reason with a woman at this time, so he immediately said,””I’m not drinking! I won’t drink! I’m determined not to drink it!”

Seeing this, Song Wei and Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but laugh.

Everyone took their seats in the dining hall and looked at the dazzling array of dishes on the table. Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue were naturally full of praise. Fang Liyun happily let everyone try it and asked Song Wei to get some fruit juice from the fridge for everyone.

Fang Liyun’s cooking was very good. Everyone ate and chatted, and the atmosphere was quite good.

Song Wei had not been home for a while. Her sudden return was a surprise for song Qiming and his wife. In addition, Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue’s visit made the usually quiet house livelier. Naturally, song Qiming and Fang Liyun were in a good mood.
