3282 The strange child Daoist (1)

Xia ruofei had never expected that the first person he would see in this secret realm would be a little Daoist boy. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Ever since he entered this secret realm, he had always been alone. Moreover, the vast grassland was completely silent, not even the sound of insects could be heard. A living person had suddenly appeared, which really caught him off guard.

Xia ruofei calmed himself down and said,””This little Daoist priest is too polite! May I ask who left behind this tower and what mystery lies within it?”

The little Daoist boy’s face was as calm as an ancient well as he said indifferently,””Scholar, please come in!”

The little Daoist boy had a young face, but he gave Xia ruofei a feeling of lethargy.

Seeing that the other party didn’t respond to his words, Xia ruofei felt helpless. He could only nod and say,””Thank you for your trouble, little priest!”

The Daoist boy nodded and turned to walk into the tower.

Xia ruofei looked at the little Daoist’s back and felt that something was off, but he could not tell what it was. He frowned slightly and thought for a moment, but still decided to follow them first.

Xia ruofei took two quick steps and caught up to the little Daoist. Then, he asked,””Little Daoist priest, may I ask how old you are this year?”

The little Daoist slowed down and turned to look at Xia ruofei.””Scholar, please come in!”

The tone, speed, and expression of this sentence were almost exactly the same as before. Even the short pause after the words “scholar” was almost the same.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be stunned. He looked deeply at the little Daoist and asked,””Little Daoist priest, is there a mission for me to enter this tower?”

After the little Daoist heard this, his face finally showed some expression. He said,””I’ve heard that you’re exceptionally intelligent. Our true yang temple has recently encountered a Strange Matter, and I hope that you can help us dispel our doubts and solve this difficult problem. ”

“True yang temple?” Xia ruofei asked subconsciously,”little Taoist, are you saying that this tower is actually a Taoist temple?”

The little Daoist regained his calm expression and said,””Scholar, please come in!”

It’s here again ...

Xia ruofei already had a guess in his heart, but he could not be completely sure.

At this moment, the two of them had unknowingly arrived at the entrance of the tower. The huge stone door had been completely pushed open, forming a huge doorway.

When the two of them stepped into the tower, the two stone doors began to close by themselves again, but this process was very slow.

Xia ruofei followed the little Daoist, but he was walking very slowly. The little Daoist did not rush him, but also slowed down to wait for Xia ruofei.

Just as the stone door was about to close and there was only a one – meter gap left, Xia ruofei suddenly tiptoed and leaped backward, directly jumping out of the gap.

After leaving the tower and entering the circular corridor outside, Xia ruofei saw the Daoist boy’s figure through the gap of the door. He did not expect Xia ruofei to suddenly run out of the tower like a rabbit. The Daoist boy did not react for a moment before the stone door was closed heavily.

Xia ruofei looked at the stone door thoughtfully. After a while, he started to walk around the circular corridor to observe the embossed on the wall.

To be honest, it was not that Xia ruofei was not anxious. It was just that he knew that he had to be more careful in times like this. He had to confirm his judgment before he could make the right choice in the following process.

In addition, although these embossed were all scenes of cultivation, and looked very ordinary, after careful observation, one would still find it very charming. Just like some girls, they might not be stunning at first glance, but they belonged to the type that was very long – lasting, and the more one looked, the more comfortable it was.

Xia ruofei patiently went against the clock and walked around the circular corridor. To be precise, it should be an octagonal corridor. He looked at all the embossed again and finally returned to the huge stone door.

Xia ruofei stared at the tightly shut stone door. He was actually a little nervous. Although his choice just now was not an impulsive one, it still carried some risks. If he could not enter the stone door again after he came out, it would not be worth it.

However, Xia ruofei’s judgment was that the possibility of that was very low.

As expected, when Xia ruofei tried to use his spiritual power to check the stone door again, the stone door creaked open.

Xia ruofei finally confirmed that he didn’t need to do anything with this door. The last time he tried to open the stone door, it was meaningless.

Xia ruofei stepped back and stared at the door that was slowly widening.

Sure enough, the little Daoist boy in the blue Daoist robe appeared at the door again.

The little Daoist boy walked up to Xia ruofei again.

This time, Xia ruofei observed carefully and realized that the distance between each step of the child was about 65 to 70 centimeters. It was as if he had measured it with a ruler. The distance of each step was exactly the same.

The little Daoist boy bowed to Xia ruofei as if it was his first time seeing Xia ruofei. He said directly,””The Buddha of immeasurable longevity! Since this scholar had come here, why was he loitering outside the door? Please come in for a chat!”
