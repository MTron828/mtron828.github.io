3256 Flight verification (1)

When the black – armored flying ship stopped above the courtyard in liuhai Lane, the ordinary people in the courtyard did not notice it at all. However, Chen Nanfeng and the other cultivators had long since discovered the traces of the Flying Ship and came to the courtyard to look up.

Xia ruofei and the rest jumped off the flying boat.

Xia ruofei did not put away the flying boat. Instead, he let it hover above the courtyard house.

Chen Nanfeng smiled and walked up to him, saying,””Fellow Daoist Xia, it’s been hard on you to cross the ocean!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Sect leader Chen, you’re exaggerating. I’m just running errands. It’s not a big deal!”

“It’s not convenient to talk about many things over the phone. Xuan ‘er didn’t explain it clearly. ” Chen Nanfeng asked,”fellow Daoist Xia, did your trip go smoothly?”

“I didn’t fail you!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”the equipment that we need has been completed. However, the production and assembly will take time, so we will have to wait for more than half a month before we can get the equipment. Also ... Other than the EVA suit and the oxygen supply module, there’s another surprise. ”

“Oh? Little brother Xia, don’t keep us in suspense. Tell us, what’s the surprise?” Mu Sheng could not help but say.

“Let’s let brother Chen tell everyone!”Xia ruofei smiled.

“Xuan ‘er! Tell me!” Chen Nanfeng said as he looked at Chen Xuan.

“Yes! Father!” Chen Xuan replied respectfully,”this time, it’s all thanks to brother Xia! He saved that American’s life, and that guy didn’t want to cooperate at first. Fortunately, brother Xia found a breakthrough and made him willing to produce spacesuits and oxygen supply modules for us. He also provided us with a spaceship that could travel in space for free!”

“A flying ship?” Chen Nanfeng narrowed his eyes and asked,”are there airboats in the secular world?”

“It’s different than an airboat!” Chen Xuan explained,”this is specially designed to be used in space. The material used to make the spaceship can ensure that it can operate in space for a long time. Furthermore, it can produce oxygen and is extremely well sealed. It’s almost the same as if a person is on the ground ...”

“Of course, it’s impossible to completely meet the conditions on the ground.” Xia ruofei smiled and added,”at the very least, the problem of weightlessness is not something that can be solved with the current level of human technology. Besides, the space in the spaceship is relatively small. It will be difficult to travel for a long time.”

“That’s true for ordinary people.” Chen Xuan chuckled.”However, for cultivators, this isn’t considered tough at all. It’s no different from living on the surface. So, brother Xia has helped us a lot this time!”

Chen Nanfeng was overjoyed and said,””I didn’t expect this! The technology of the secular world was actually so effective! This is all thanks to fellow Daoist Xia!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”you’re being too serious. I’m also joining this expedition!” Of course, I want to try my best to have better conditions. I’m also helping myself!”

“Does this mean that the obstacles in our way to the moon no longer exist?” Liu Mansha asked.

Xia ruofei said seriously,”Valley master Liu, I can’t be sure now. After all, everything in space is unknown. No one in the cultivation world has ever wandered in space for a long time. We don’t have any experience to learn from. I feel that even if we find the crater on the moon, there may be many tests waiting for us. So, we can’t take it lightly.”

Xia ruofei paused for a moment and continued,””For safety’s sake, I brought the ship back in advance, along with a few extra spacesuits. We’re going to take an airboat to the low – Earth orbit to test it. It’ll be a test flight!”

Liu Mansha’s eyes lit up and she said,”that’s a good idea!” Indeed, space is unknown territory for us. It’s a bit too risky to launch a long – distance voyage rashly!”

Chen Nanfeng stroked his beard and smiled,”fellow Daoist Xia is a meticulous person!” He’s indeed a young hero!”

“You’re flattering me ...” Xia ruofei said.”This is what I’ve been thinking. There are only five sets of spacesuits and nine of us are going to explore the moon. We’ll have to do it in batches. In addition, the seniors who are not going to the moon ...”

“We won’t be joining in the fun!” Mu Sheng said readily.

“En!” Chen Nanfeng nodded. Fellow Daoist Xia, I think it’s best that you arrange this flight verification!” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei nodded.”That’s my initial plan. I’m going to control the black Phoenix flying ship, so I’ll have to participate every time. This will take away one of my slots.” In addition, the main thing is to consider separating the Aurous core stage fellow Daoists to ensure that there are at least two Aurous core cultivators on each verification flight. This way, in the event of an accident, the safety of the Qi condensation stage fellow Daoists can be guaranteed to the greatest extent. ”

“That makes sense!” Chen Nanfeng agreed,”I think this arrangement is more appropriate!”

Xia ruofei said,”in that case, I’ll make the arrangements!” “This test flight won’t take too long. After all, even though there’s a lot of energy left in the oxygen supply module, no one knows what we’ll encounter when we reach the moon. We don’t know how long we’ll have to stay, so we should try not to consume too much energy in the early stages.”

He glanced at the crowd and continued,””The flight verification is mainly divided into two groups. The first group consists of me, Ling Qingxue, brother Chen, Elder Willow, and miss Xin ‘er. I’ll still be participating in the second batch, and there’s also elder muhua, brother Jianfei, elder Shen tianfang from the first heaven society, and lady yurou. Does anyone have any objections to this group?”
