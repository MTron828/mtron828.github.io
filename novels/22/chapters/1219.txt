Besides, Xia ruofei also enjoyed the joy of reaping the fruits of his labor.

With a direct demonstration, Blackie and the rest immediately understood.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and pointed at the truffles in the plastic box worriedly.””If you find such things while digging, stop immediately. Don’t break their skin, understand?”

This order was not difficult for Blacky and the rest. All the dogs followed the order. Fluffy one, fluffy two, and the rest started to dig holes where they had found the truffles. Blacky and lightning also rushed into the woods to find new truffles.

For a moment, a series of rustling sounds could be heard from the oak Forest, as well as the happy barking of dogs.

Xia ruofei also picked up the shovel and continued to dig in the hole.

After a while, he could vaguely see a piece of white truffle.

He immediately changed to a small wooden shovel and carefully dug around the White truffle. Soon, he had harvested a piece of white truffle that was more than half a kilogram.

Xia ruofei placed the White truffle into another large plastic box, dusted his hands, and walked towards his next target.

Blackie and the rest were very strong. Digging truffles was a delicate task, especially at the last stage, which required extreme caution. Hence, Xia ruofei looked around and saw that there were many pits of various sizes in the oak Forest. Blackie and the rest were still working hard.

If people from the traditional truffle – producing areas in France or Italy saw this scene, their jaws would probably drop in shock.

Such a small oak Forest actually produced so much truffle. Moreover, these seemingly ordinary Huaxia garden dogs were actually more powerful than hunting dogs that had been trained for many years. They were all accurate.

Xia ruofei was focused on digging the truffle. Time passed by slowly and the two big plastic boxes he brought were soon full.

Hence, he took two more plastic boxes from the Archean realm to store them. These plastic storage boxes were very convenient to use and clean. Hence, when Xia ruofei first obtained the spirit map space, he bought a lot of them and placed them in the space. He could use them at any time. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Unconsciously, after Xia ruofei dug out a piece of white truffle, he saw that Blackie, lightning, fluffy one and fluffy two had gathered around him. They were all covered in mud and looked more like dogs.

“Are you done digging?” Xia ruofei asked, stunned.

Lightning wagged its tail at Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei nodded and LED lightning, Blackie, and the rest around the oak Forest. They checked a few meters away from the forest and found two more fish that had escaped.

After digging out the last two pieces of truffles, he checked and found that all the truffles in the forest had been dug out.

Xia ruofei started to count his harvest this season.

Just now, he had buried his head in digging. When the plastic box was filled, he would use his mind to control the invisible force of space to retrieve new boxes from the Archean realm. As for how much he had gained, he really had no idea.

These plastic boxes were scattered around the forest. Once they were filled, they would be left where they were. Xia ruofei took the new boxes and continued to dig for truffles.

However, Xia ruofei had absolute control over space. He spread out his spiritual power and instantly enveloped the entire Oak Forest. He also instantly knew what he had gained.

After calculating the specific gains, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but open his mouth slightly, revealing an overjoyed expression ...
