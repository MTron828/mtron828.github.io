Translator: 549690339

As long as they talked about work or new products, Feng Jing would be full of energy. After hearing Xia ruofei’s words, she looked at Xia ruofei eagerly and said,””Chairman, don’t keep me in suspense. Tell me, what’s the new product?”

“CEO Feng, I’m preparing to launch a high – end seafood product this time,” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Seafood?” Feng Rao was confused.

During the second expansion of Peach Blossom Farm, the land rented from the village had expanded a lot and had extended to the seaside. In theory, the coastal area was also used by Peach Blossom Farm. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

However, the farm had not developed and utilized this area for the time being. There was no seafood cultivation in the farm, and there were no plans for similar projects. Where did the seafood come from?

Xia ruofei smiled and explained,”in the future, I’m planning to bring in high – Quality abalone species and cultivate them in a simulated natural ocean environment. I’ve already entrusted a friend to carry out the relevant experimental proofs elsewhere. This time, we’re launching the experimental products.”

Feng Rao immediately understood Xia ruofei’s explanation.

In fact, the peach blossom company’s development was largely dependent on Xia ruofei’s own strength. This was because the core vegetable seeds, Ironhide Dendrobium strips, and even clam fish were all personally handled by Xia ruofei.

Feng Jing was already used to Xia ruofei’s methods. It was as if anything he brought out was the best.

This included the fruits planted on the mountain behind the farm. Feng Rao’s family had told her that the forest behind the farm used to be contracted by villagers to plant fruit trees. However, due to the water and soil, the fruits were bitter and unpalatable.

However, after planting the ‘high – tech fruit seedlings’ provided by Xia ruofei, the peach blossom brand fruits that he had harvested last time not only looked extremely good, but also tasted more than one grade better than ordinary fruits of the same kind.

Xia ruofei laughed.”This time, we are going to cooperate with Hong Kong’s Hengfeng group. Hengfeng auction house will be hosting an auction in Hong Kong. The item for auction will be the best dried abalone produced by our paradise Corporation.”

“Dry abalone ... For auction?” Feng Rao felt that her brain wasn’t working well enough.

Xia ruofei nodded.”The abalones I provide are of the best quality. Most of them are above the standard of a one – Head abalone. Of course, we can maximize our profits by auctioning such good things!”

He paused and took a sip of tea. He didn’t notice that Feng Rao was already dumbfounded. He continued,””And ... Through the auction, we can also greatly enhance the brand awareness of our paradise Corporation. You know, Hong Kong is very eager to buy the best abalone, I don’t believe that those big and small tycoons won’t be tempted! Hehe, when it’s reported on the news, the whole of Hong Kong will know about our paradise company ...”

After Xia ruofei finished speaking, he saw that Feng Jing was still in a daze. He couldn’t help but call out,””President Feng ... President Feng!”

“Ah?” Only then did Feng Rao snap back to her senses.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”CEO Feng, did you not sleep well last night?” Why did you get distracted while we were chatting?”

Feng Rao blushed in embarrassment, then said in a coquettish tone,””It’s all because of you!”

Hearing this, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be stunned for a moment, revealing a strange expression.

Feng Jing quickly realized that her words had a lot of hidden meaning. Xia ruofei had previously teased her about not sleeping well last night, and she had said coquettishly,”isn’t it all because of you?” as if Xia ruofei had done something to her last night that caused her to not sleep well.

Feng Rao’s face immediately burned, and she couldn’t help but feel embarrassed.

The atmosphere suddenly became a little awkward.

Fortunately, Feng Rao immediately said coyly,””Chairman, it’s all your fault for releasing such shocking news out of the blue. I’m so glad I didn’t have a heart disease. Otherwise, I’d be killed in the line of duty!”

Xia ruofei laughed dryly and said,”CEO Feng, you were a Senior Manager in a top 500 company in the world. How would I know that your psychological endurance is so bad?”

“Then you’re blaming me?” Feng Rao pouted and glanced at Xia ruofei.

“It’s my fault ...” Xia ruofei laughed.

Feng Rao’s tone sounded like she was acting coquettishly, which was completely different from her usual style. She also felt that it was a little ambiguous, so she quickly cleared her throat and asked,””Chairman, can you tell me more about this one – headed abalone?”

As the company’s general manager, Feng Jing was keenly aware that this was a great opportunity for the company. If she grasped it well, it was very likely that paradise Corporation would rise to fame overnight.

At present, the Paradise Corporation was already considered to have a small reputation in Sanshan city and even the southeast province. However, when compared to the whole country, whether it was brand awareness or size, it was still a little lacking, let alone in Hong Kong.

If the Hong Kong media reported it and the mainland took the opportunity to hype it up, the effect of expanding the company’s brand awareness would be very obvious.

Especially since they were auctioning a rare item like the one – headed abalone this time, if a sky – High price appeared in the auction, the Paradise Corporation would immediately be associated with high – end and distinguished. The saying “Paradise’s products must be the best” would unconsciously be deeply rooted in people’s hearts.
