Chapter 595: The purple red Dragon (1)

Xia ruofei did not know what was so special about the last pair of blood red Dragons, but he was keenly aware of the subtle changes in li Zongheng and Guo Qinglin’s expressions.

These were all smart people! That was why Xia ruofei had intentionally placed the pair of Blood Dragons at the end of the auction.

Surprisingly, li Zongheng and Guo Qinglin did not make a direct bid. Instead, they seemed to be in deep thought, as if they were thinking about what price they should make.

Xu Desheng, on the other hand, thought for a moment and immediately offered a price.”Six million!”

Xu Desheng also knew that it was meaningless to make a low bid. Moreover, every pair of Blood Dragons that Xia ruofei took out was worth this price, so he simply made a bid of six million.

Li Zongheng thought for a moment, then smiled and said, “It’s the last pair, I can’t let you guys have it so easily! Little Xia, I’ll bid 6.5 million!”

Li Zongheng suddenly raised the price by 500000, which made Xu Desheng a little depressed. In fact, compared with the first pair of Blood Dragons, the performance of this pair was similar in all aspects. After several rounds of bidding, the first pair was sold at the price of 6.5 million.

However, this was the last pair. It was understandable for li Zongheng to be a little anxious. Xu Desheng did not think too much about it. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

The skinny old man Guo Qinglin also laughed and said,””Boss Li, I really like this pair of blood red Dragons. How about this, I’ll bid 6.8 million!”

Xu Desheng couldn’t help but open his mouth wide. He thought to himself, why are these two people so fierce? Can We Still Be Friends happily?

Although the people present were not short of money, as business elites, these people would never be spendthrift. On the contrary, many times they were calculative, otherwise they could not have earned such a large family business.

Xu Desheng did not understand.

However, just as li Zongheng had said, this was the last pair. Blood Dragons of this quality were hard to come by, and it was already a miracle that six of them had appeared at once. What if they missed this opportunity and didn’t have it again?

......

Xu Desheng was also very fond of this pair of blood red Dragons.

He struggled in his heart for a moment, then gritted his teeth and said,””Old Guo, boss Li, I’ll pay seven million! If your offer is higher than this, I’ll withdraw from the competition ...”

Ling Xiaotian chuckled as he watched the commotion. Yang Dahua and Xie Xun, who had already bought the Blood Red Dragon, were also relaxed. They could not bid anyway, so everyone was happy to see Xu Desheng and the others fighting to the death.

Xia ruofei glanced at li Zongheng and Guo Qinglin thoughtfully, a faint smile on his face.

This price was already very high, but Xia ruofei had a feeling that neither li Zongheng nor Guo Qinglin would give up so easily.

As expected, Guo Qinglin only thought for a moment before he said decisively,””I’m sorry, chief Xu. I really like this pair of Blood Dragons. I’ll pay 7.5 million!”

Xu Desheng sighed, shrugged, and walked to the side. He was obviously not going to bid anymore.

It was true that he didn’t lack money, but his money didn’t fall from the sky. He wouldn’t be a spendthrift.

Even Ling Xiaotian, Xie Xun, and yang Dahua were surprised. They didn’t expect the price to be so high.

As for li Zongheng, he couldn’t help but shoot a glance at Guo Qinglin when he saw the latter’s bid.

Li Zongheng lowered his head and thought for a moment. Then, he raised his head decisively and said,”Little Xia, I’ll bid 8.5 million!”

Li Zongheng then looked at Guo Qinglin with a burning gaze.

Ling Xiaotian and the others sucked in a breath of cold air. Even though the premium blood – Red Dragon was priceless, li Zongheng’s bid had clearly exceeded the actual value of the fish.

Moreover, the price had already reached 7.5 million, which was already a rather high price. Yet, li Zongheng had raised the price by one million in one go. This made Ling Xiaotian and the others feel incredulous.

Their impression of li Zongheng was that he was a very calm and humble person. He did not seem like the kind of person who would act on Impulse!

Could it be that this pair of blood red Dragons was the last pair, and Li Zongheng really wanted them, so he intentionally increased the price by one million to show his determination to get them and to make Guo Qinglin back off?

Ling Xiaotian and the others could only come up with this reason.

Xie Xun and yang Dahua couldn’t help but secretly rejoice. Fortunately, they had made their move early and bought the first and second pair at a higher price. Otherwise, when it came to the last pair, they would have to fight to the death with li Zongheng. They would really have to bleed a lot.

Especially Xie Xun. Including the two million he lost in the bet, he had actually spent 8.5 million for the blood Dragons, which was the same price as li Zongheng.

When he thought of this, the gloominess in Xie Xun’s heart seemed to ease up a lot.

Guo Qinglin was also stunned by li Zongheng’s offer. He furrowed his brows.

Li Zongheng was still looking at Guo Qinglin with a smile on his face. Now that Xu Desheng had withdrawn from the competition, the pair of blood red Dragons would be his as long as Guo Qinglin gave up.

Li Zongheng’s expression was relaxed, but he was actually a little nervous, especially when Guo Qinglin looked at the pair of blood red Dragons that had yet to be decided. His heart could not help but skip a beat, and he had a bad feeling about this.
