Chapter 1240: Not taking the usual path (1)

Translator: 549690339

The price of 250000 dollars was already shocking enough. Now, someone actually added another 50000 dollars, bringing the price to the 300000 – dollar mark. Everyone couldn’t help but look in the direction of the voice.

MA Xiong smiled bitterly. He did not even need to turn around to know that the bidder was Xia ruofei.

Blake also jumped up from his seat as if his tail had been stepped on. He criticized loudly in English, You’re the owner of this batch of truffles. What right do you have to participate in the auction?”

Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”which law states that the owner of an item can’t participate in the auction?” I suddenly found this truffle pleasing to the eye and decided to buy it back at a high price. Is it anyone’s business? I’ll just give you the auction Commission, not a single cent less. Are you going to bite me?”

Blake’s face was as calm as water. He snorted and said,””You’re raising the price with malicious intent! And in front of so many people, he publicly did such a shameless thing. This is just too unbelievable!”

Xia ruofei stood up, stared at Blake and said quickly, “Don’t talk about those useless things! I just don’t want to sell truffles to a sanctimonious hypocrite who slanders our company’s reputation and the quality of our truffles! I’m targeting you! The other guests can bid however they want, I will not interfere!”

The reporters in Hong Kong took out their cameras and started taking pictures of Xia ruofei and Blake. At the same time, many of them were asking each other about the past grudges between Xia ruofei and Blake.

However, that incident happened in Shen Cheng city. At that time, the influence of the peach blossom company wasn’t that big, so the reporters in Hong Kong didn’t know about it.

Hong Kong reporters loved to collect and write such trivial news. They secretly decided that they would interview Xia ruofei or Blake after the auction to restore the previous incident.

The reporters were like sharks that smelled blood, while MA Xiong and Feng Jing shook their heads with bitter smiles.

Feng Jing was initially a little resistant to appearing in public and speaking on stage, but now it seemed like her previous worries were unnecessary.

This was because Xia ruofei had successfully stolen all the limelight.

No matter what, all the major media outlets would definitely make a special story about this scene tomorrow.

After Xia ruofei pulled away the ‘hatred’, Feng Jing’s speech on stage would not attract much attention.

However, Feng Jing didn’t want this kind of “hatred”, because no matter what, it would affect paradise corporation’s reputation.

Unfortunately, it had already happened, and Feng Jing didn’t know much about the matter between Xia ruofei and Blake. Although she had heard some things during breakfast, it wasn’t appropriate for her to ask in detail. Besides, Feng Jing had been backstage the whole time and wasn’t by Xia ruofei’s side, so it was too late to stop her.

Hengfeng’s gold – medal auctioneer, Lu zhongguang, had lost his composure for the first time in such an important occasion. He stood on the stage in a daze, not knowing how to deal with this sudden situation. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Mr. Lu, did you hear my offer?” Xia ruofei reminded him.

Lu zhongguang seemed to have woken up from a dream. As an experienced auctioneer, he naturally knew that Xia ruofei’s bid was in accordance with the rules under such circumstances.

Besides, Xia ruofei was MA Xiong’s guest of honor, so he nodded without hesitation and said,””Mr. Xia has bid 300000 US dollars. Is there anyone else who would like to increase the price?”

In fact, he didn’t even need to ask this question. The price of $250000 was already too high. Who would want $300000? Everyone’s money didn’t come from nowhere.

Just as Lu zhongguang was about to start the countdown, to everyone’s surprise, Blake hesitated for a while with a gloomy face, then clenched his teeth and shouted,”” 350 thousand dollars!”

This was the power of combat. Luckily, the White truffle wasn’t too big, at least not too eye – catching in today’s auction. The price wasn’t too high either, so Blake could afford it even if he had to use his own money.

However, just as he finished speaking, Xia ruofei made a bid without thinking.”” 500000 dollars!”

If Blake’s bidding was unreasonable just now, Xia ruofei’s bidding was super unreasonable now. He had completely ignored the value of the truffle.

Blake almost spat out a mouthful of blood.

You can’t play like this! Even if the item is yours, you still have to pay the auction Commission in the end! What good would it do you to fight to the death like this?

Xia ruofei’s unhesitating bid also shocked Blake. Even after Lu zhongguang finished counting down, he did not bid again.

Lu zhongguang stood on the stage and said with a strange expression,””Congratulations, Mr. Xia, for winning this 1.12 kg white truffle for $500000!”

These words didn’t sound right.

He had bought his own things, what was there to congratulate him for?

Not to mention, this price was more than enough to buy two pieces of white truffles.

The guests and ordinary buyers below the stage also showed a funny expression. However, Xia ruofei was not affected at all. He still had a faint smile on his face.

Blake’s face was like the bottom of a pot.

However, when Lu zhongguang announced the result of the auction, it was as if a bolt of lightning had struck Blake’s mind.

Didn’t you just randomly bid to stop me from participating in the auction? I thought you didn’t care about that little bit of Commission?

Then I’ll bid for every piece of truffle, and I’ll bid as much as I can. By then, you won’t be able to sell any of these truffles, and you’ll have to lose a large amount of Commission from the auction. The entire auction will become a joke!
