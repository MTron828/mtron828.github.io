Xia ruofei was thinking about people with fatty liver.

This disease was not particularly common in the past. With the improvement of people’s living standards, more and more people slowly developed fatty liver. In fact, it was because they ate too much, and their bodies could not absorb it.

In fact, modern Chinese medicine had also studied fatty liver. Besides absorbing the Chinese medicine books in the Jade talisman of inheritance, Xia ruofei had also found some Chinese medicine books from the outside world to help with his research.

According to Traditional Chinese Medicine, the diet was fat, sweet, and greasy. In other words, eating things with high fat, especially thick, and especially oily would easily cause fatty liver.

Modern Chinese medicine also had a mature treatment plan for fatty liver.

If he wanted to deliberately create fatty liver, he could do the opposite and think of a way to eat.

Xia ruofei did not know how different the goose’s body was from a human ‘s, but he felt that it was worth a try.

In fact, the modern production of foie gras also used this method to encourage the West to use the cruel feeding method. In essence, it was to make the body of the fat goose unable to absorb it, and then the liver would become abnormally fat due to overload.

At the same time, in order to ensure that the whole goose liver was fat, greasy, and tender, farm owners had to try to reduce the calcium content in the food as much as possible. Without enough calcium during the development period, the goose would suffer from “osteodystrophy”. It would then squat lazily in the cage without moving, and its weight would “explode” in exponential levels.

In order to produce goose liver in this way, the goose had to go through unbearable pain. It was locked in a small space every day, and it was difficult to even turn around. Then every few hours, an iron tube would be inserted into its throat for 20 to 30 minutes, and a large amount of food would be directly poured into it. Its stomach would be stuffed like a dough bag, and before the food was digested, it would be immediately stuffed with more food.

It could be said that if a goose had its own thoughts, it would not be willing to reincarnate as a goose for ten lifetimes after experiencing such a tragic life.

In order for the goose to not experience such pain in the process of growth and at the same time produce high – Quality foie gras, he could only think of a way in the diet.

They didn’t need to eat too much, but at the same time, they had to make the nutrition and fat content of the food seriously exceed the limit, even exceeding the effect of forced feeding by Western farms.

Xia ruofei’s thoughts started to clear up ...

In fact, there were many prescriptions that had such an effect. They were originally aimed at the situation of malnutrition to supplement the body’s qi and blood. If the dosage and proportion of the prescription were adjusted to a certain extent, it would definitely cause the Strasburg goose to be seriously overnutriated.

Of course, the body structure of a goose and a human was completely different. As for how to adjust the prescription, it still needed to be tested many times.

However, he was sure that once this method was successful, the Strasburg goose would not experience any pain in the growing process.

It should be known that aside from the nerves distributed on the surface of the liver, there were almost no nerves on the inside. When a human liver area had lesions, generally speaking, they would not feel anything at all. It would not hurt or itch at all unless it had seriously spread to the surface of the liver. Only then would they feel a dull pain. This was also why liver cancer was often found to be in the late stage when it was detected. When patients felt pain in the liver area and went to the doctor, it was often very serious.

Therefore, even if the liver of the Strasburg goose became unusually fat because of the special blend of food, they would not feel any pain.

As for the liver being fattened up and slaughtered, this was the law of nature. Even the most nitpicking animal rights activists could not find any fault with it.

Xia ruofei was sure of a few things. First, the herbs used in the prescription had to be common. If they used precious herbs like hundred – year – old ginseng, it would be meaningless as the cost was too high. Second, these medicinal herbs must be easy to grow in large quantities. The third was to find a way to turn it into powder that could be mass produced.

Only when these conditions were met could large – scale reproduction and breeding of the Strasburg fat goose be feasible.

At this thought, Xia ruofei raised his hand to look at his watch. It was three in the afternoon. Ling Qingxue had told him to come to the Ling family’s house at the Riverside Villa area at Sixo’ clock sharp for dinner. In other words, excluding the time he would take on the road, he had at least two hours.

He had already formed a few backup plans in his mind. He had to test out the effects of these prescriptions and what adjustments needed to be made.

He was already a little impatient.

Since there was still time, Xia ruofei immediately took out the spirit map scroll and entered the space.

Xia Qing saw Xia ruofei return, but she didn’t find it strange. These days, Xia ruofei would go into the space to deal with the materials whenever he had time.

Xia ruofei waved at Xia Qing and said,””Xia Qing, stop what you’re doing for a moment. I have something for you to do!” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Xia Qing quickly ran over and respectfully said,””Master, please give your orders!”

Xia ruofei said,”from the batch of young geese that I just sent in, you can pick ... Five of them!” Pick five and send them to the Archean realm. Calculate the time and let them be famished to the point where their stomachs are rumbling. The effect I want is that when I feed them later, even if the food is a little unpalatable, they will still be eager to eat it!”

“Alright!” Xia Qing answered without the slightest hesitation,”master, I’ll head over first!”
