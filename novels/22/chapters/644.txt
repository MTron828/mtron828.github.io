Chapter 645: Chapter 463 – in full swing_1

The iron – Skin Dendrobium in the original space had ripened again.

Xia ruofei was prepared to go into the medium to harvest them today. After a few days, the next batch of iron – Skin dendrobes would be completed, and he would have at least another twenty to thirty million in funds.

In this way, whether it was to transform the fish pond or to set up a pharmaceutical company, he had more than enough funds.

However, Xia ruofei could not leave for the time being.

He had just called his comrade – in – arms, Qian Lijun, from Jiangsu and Zhejiang Province in his office and asked him to arrange for master Luo and a few employees from Taoyuan farm to come back together. When he was packing up and preparing to go home, Xue Jinshan, who had finished the employment procedures quickly, ran over impatiently.

“President Xia, I’ve completed all the procedures and signed the confidentiality agreement and competition agreement!” Xue Jinshan said excitedly,”now can you tell me more about this special medicine for autism?”

Xia ruofei looked at Feng Rao and saw her nod with a smile. He patted Xue Jinshan’s shoulder and said,””Researcher Xue, there’s no hurry ... We’ll talk after you settle down. By the way, are you planning to live on the farm or find a place to live outside? If you want to rent a house in the city, our company will provide transportation and rental subsidies. ”

“It doesn’t matter!” Xue Jinshan said. He could stay anywhere! If you can ‘t, you can sleep in the office ... By the way, our pharmaceutical company doesn’t seem to have an office yet ...”

At this point, Xue Jinshan scratched his head in embarrassment.

Xia ruofei laughed out loud. He knew that if he didn’t tell him about the heart – nourishing soup today, he wouldn’t be able to sleep well.

Hence, Xia ruofei led Xue Jinshan to the guest sofa and sat down.

Feng Jing tactfully took her leave.

“Researcher Xue, I’ve named this new medicine heart – nourishing soup.” Xia ruofei went straight to the point.”It’s made of foxglove, Chinese yam, polycorum root, peony, Poria Cocos, Cornel ... And more than ten other Chinese medicines.” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

......

As Xia ruofei spoke, he took a piece of paper and wrote down the prescription.

Xue Jinshan impatiently took the piece of paper and began to read it seriously, like a student who was thirsty for knowledge.

Following that, Xue Jinshan couldn’t help but look at the prescription and Mutter to himself,”Strengthening the spleen and Qi, improving intelligence, warming the kidney and nourishing the brain, nourishing the liver and kidney ... From the medicinal properties, it might have these effects, but there are many such prescriptions! There are quite a few classical prescriptions in the pharmacological book, so how could they have any effect on autism?”

Xia ruofei smiled as he leaned back on the sofa. He did not interrupt Xue Jinshan’s thoughts.

“Could it be the subtle effect of the interaction between the ruler, subject, and assistant?” Xue Jinshan was still mumbling to himself,”which one is the main medicine?” Yuanzhi? Or is it Cornelian?”

After a long while, Xue Jinshan was still confused, and the confusion on his face became even more apparent.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but find it funny. This Yangyang soup was recorded in a small booklet. Even a strong person like him had obvious effects after drinking it. Besides, Xia ruofei didn’t write down the tips of brewing on paper. Even if Xue Jinshan had a PhD or post – doc in Traditional Chinese Medicine, he wouldn’t be able to analyze anything useful, let alone a master’s degree in traditional Chinese medicine.

After a long while, Xue Jinshan bitterly smiled and said,”Director Xia, I really don’t understand this prescription.”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you don’t have to understand and analyze every prescription.” Researcher Xue, we’re not doing research, you still haven’t changed your mind!”

Xue Jinshan was stunned for a moment, then he scratched his head awkwardly and laughed,”Occupational disease, occupational disease ... When I was a master’s student, I often helped my mentor analyze various prescriptions ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”actually, I don’t know either, but it doesn’t matter!” As long as it’s effective, isn’t it fine?”

Xue Jinshan’s eyes brightened, and he hurriedly said,”By the way, director Xia, you said that this prescription has been tested on an autistic child. Where is the patient now? Can I take a look?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”don’t worry. You’ll definitely see the patient, but not now.” I’ll go to his follow – up in a few days, and you’ll come with me. ”

Xue Jinshan was a little anxious and couldn’t wait to see the patient. However, at least he knew that Xia ruofei was his boss and he had to listen to his boss’s arrangements. Therefore, he could only suppress his anticipation and nod.

Xia ruofei said,”researcher Xue, I’ll be recruiting about ten more children with autism to carry out the next step of the verification experiment. You can also participate in the entire process. You’ll have to record the details of the experiment in detail. We might need it when we apply for a new drug next.”

“No problem! Leave it to me!” Xue Jinshan said excitedly.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”this is not the most urgent thing. Our top priority now is to apply for a patent for this prescription. Researcher Xue, I’ve written the prescription to you. I’ll also provide you with a few portions of the decoction I’ve made. Do a preliminary drug analysis and then quickly apply for a patent.”

“Director Xia, if you want to apply for a patent, you also need to provide the preparation process of the medicine ...” Xue Jinshan said.

Xia ruofei frowned and asked,”do I have to provide the detailed steps?” Can you simplify it a little?”

Xue Jinshan had also guessed that the brewing process of this prescription must be kept absolutely confidential. He muttered to himself for a moment before saying,”As for the Traditional Chinese Medicine preparation ... The requirements in this aspect are not so strict, but it’s best to simplify the steps.”
