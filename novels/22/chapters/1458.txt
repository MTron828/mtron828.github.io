Chapter 1459: Eye – opening (1)

Translator: 549690339

At 9:30 pm, Xia ruofei and the rest left the food stall.

After that, they did not talk about Guan Ping anymore. Xia ruofei understood. After all, he had been in this job for many years. It was not easy to just resign. He would give Guan Ping enough time to think.

The four of them had consumed four boxes of beer. Ye Lingyun had to drive so he did not touch a single drop of alcohol. In fact, the forty bottles of beer were all drunk by Xia ruofei, pang Hao, and Guan Ping.

In the end, pang Hao did not get Xia ruofei drunk. Not only did he not get drunk, but Xia ruofei did not look drunk at all. His eyes were still clear, but in reality, Xia ruofei had drunk as much as the two of them.

On the other hand, pang Hao’s footsteps were already a little unsteady as he walked. Although the beer’s alcohol content wasn’t high, it still couldn’t withstand drinking so much!

Guan Ping was also a little tipsy, but he was in a much better state than pang Hao. He was still supporting pang Hao by the side.

Compared to pang Hao, Guan Ping was more composed and wouldn’t drink so much. Moreover, after working in sales for a long time, his alcohol tolerance had also improved.

Guta Street was narrow, and there were many stalls on the side of the road. With bicycles and electric motorcycles, the traffic was quite chaotic.

Hence, Xia ruofei told ye Lingyun not to drive in after he got the car and to wait at the corner of the street.

He was definitely going to send pang Hao and Guan Ping back first, so he and Guan Ping held onto pang Hao’s arm as they strode toward the street.

It wasn’t easy to find a parking space nearby. When they came, Xia ruofei parked his car quite far away, almost two streets away. So when the three of them reached the intersection, ye Lingyun had not come over yet, so the three of them stood by the roadside and waited.

Xia ruofei took out a cigarette and passed it to Guan Ping. When he passed it to pang Hao, he saw that his eyes were already in a daze. He did not even have any reaction to the cigarette that was right in front of him.

It seemed that the cold wind had gotten to her head after she came out.

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Pingzi, I think we should take a picture of chubby boy’s current state. Let’s see if he still dares to provoke me when it comes to drinking!”

“Good suggestion!” Guan Ping laughed and said,”come, come, come, let’s pose for him!”

With that said, the two bad friends helped pang Hao to sit down on the curb. A drunk person’s body was especially heavy, and without someone to lean on, one would definitely fall. The two of them swayed twice, but they still could not hold on.

Xia ruofei looked up and helped pang Hao to a nearby trash can. They sat down on the roadside and pang Hao leaned on the trash can.

“Hahaha! This is a good style!” Guan Ping said.

Pang Hao didn’t stop there and even mumbled,””Come ... Ping Zi, let’s ... Have another ... Toast with RUO Fei!”

Xia ruofei and Guan Ping couldn’t help but laugh. They took out their phones and started taking pictures, recording all of pang Hao’s ugly state.

At this moment, a voice came from behind them,””Guanping?”

After hearing this voice, Guan Ping’s movements became stiff. He slowly straightened his body and looked back. The smile on his face also disappeared at once.

“Manager Bai, manager Liu,” he said lightly.

When Xia ruofei heard these three words, he stopped filming and turned around to look at them with interest.

A man and a woman were standing opposite Guan Ping, and one of them was a young woman in her early thirties. She was probably the manager Bai that Guan Ping had mentioned.

In fact, this woman was still a pretty girl. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have been able to open up a path so easily with her body. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

However, in Xia ruofei’s eyes, she was just an ordinary person. After all, he had many beautiful women around him, and his girlfriend, Ling Qingxue, was just a character.

Moreover, manager Bai’s makeup was quite thick, making her look a little flirtatious. On top of that, her lips were very thin, and her appearance was born from her heart. People with this kind of face were generally mean, no wonder Guan Ping didn’t like her at all.

The man next to manager Bai was about 35 or 36 years old. He was dressed in a suit and leather shoes, and had the air of a successful man.

However, he should not be manager Bai’s husband, because Xia ruofei had heard Guan Ping Call him “store manager Liu”. Xia ruofei still remembered that Guan Ping had said at the food stall that manager Bai’s husband had become the deputy manager because of her. He was still far from the store manager’s level!

Store manager Liu’s hand was still wrapped around manager Bai’s waist, and his position was a little higher, basically sticking to the lower edge of the mountain. This position was quite ambiguous.

This was the first time Xia ruofei had seen Guan Ping’s description of this manager Bai. It was an eye – opener for him. This woman’s private life was really rotten!

Manager Bai and store manager Liu didn’t seem to be avoiding anything. Even when they met Guan Ping, who was an acquaintance, the two of them still maintained this ambiguous posture. Even store manager Liu’s face had a bit of a boastful look.

The corners of manager Bai’s mouth twitched.”I saw your back from afar just now. It really is you! I thought they were a few drunkards!”

Guan Ping’s brows furrowed,”Manager Bai, is it a big deal to have a meal with a friend after work?”

“It’s nothing! Of course it’s nothing!” Manager Bai laughed exaggeratedly, then changed the topic.”If you don’t come to this kind of place to eat, isn’t the class A little low? You’re the sales star of our company! How come you can only hang out in food stalls now?”
