“Sister – in – Law, don’t be in a hurry to reject me.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I didn’t think it was appropriate at first, but after thinking about it, it’s feasible. Qiao’ er will be going to study at Heron Island when school reopens. Godma will be quite lonely by herself. Nan Nan can keep her company if she stays at her place. As for picking her up ... Godma’s body is quite strong, so it shouldn’t be a big problem. ”

Hu ‘er’s mother also laughed and said,””Yup! Yue ‘E, I’m in good health now, and it’s not tiring to pick me up and drop me off twice a day! I usually have to walk to exercise my body! Just take it as training ...”

Lin Yue ‘e said hesitantly,”Auntie, this is not appropriate ... If Nan Nan stays at your place, it’s not just a matter of picking her up and dropping her off. She has to take care of her meals, drinks, and even her toilet needs!” This ... This is too much trouble for you!”

“Hehe, I also want to eat. It’s just a matter of having an extra pair of chopsticks! How much can nan Nan eat at such a young age?” Hu Zi’s mother said,”there’s nothing much in other aspects. I think Nan Nan is quite sensible. There’s no need to worry too much.”

Lin Qiao also said,”sister – in – Law, I think this is a good idea!” Don’t reject me ... I’m afraid that my mom will be all alone after I go to Heron Island! With Nan Nan, this little girl, accompanying her, I feel more at ease!”

After that, Lin Qiao gently pinched Nan Nan’s little face and asked with a smile,”Nan Nan, can you live with grandma when we are in school? Grandma will make you delicious food every day! On the weekends, uncle RUO Fei will bring you back to the farm. ” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Nannan looked at her mother and grandfather and said,”But ... I want to be with mom ...” She said.

“Mom wants to work on the farm!” Lin Qiao said. This place is too far from the city, she can’t pick you up and take care of you! Unless you go to a nearby village primary school to study, but the village primary school is very old, and even the classrooms are about to collapse. It might even be worse than the primary school you went to on Luo Jia mountain! The primary schools in the city were beautiful! There’s a beautiful track, a bright classroom, and many, many sports facilities. Don’t you want to go?”

“I do!” Nannan said. But I also want to be with mom, what should I do?”

Lin Qiao was at a loss for words. She could only helplessly turn to Xia ruofei for help.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Nan Nan, we’re not stopping you from being with mom!” We’ll only stay at grandma’s house when we’re in school, but we’ll go back to the farm during the weekends and holidays! Besides, maybe I’ll go to the city to work in a while. By then, you’ll be able to be with me every day. But you’ll have to overcome it in the first few days. Nan Nan is a good child. She can’t even overcome such a small difficulty?”

“I can!” Nan Nan raised her head and said,”uncle RUO Fei, I can overcome this difficulty!”

“This is right! As for you ... Study well with grandma, and mom can work in peace on the farm. ” Xia ruofei said,”I’ll send someone to pick you up this weekend, okay?”

“En!” Nan Nan nodded her head heavily. Although she was still reluctant to part with her mother, she was a sensible child. She knew that Xia ruofei was sincere and good to her, so she was especially obedient to Xia ruofei’s words.

“Ruofei,” Lin Yue ‘e hurriedly said,”I ... Why would I go to the city to work?”

She hesitated for a moment when she said this, but she still felt that it was not good to lie in front of the child. Especially in the future, if she could not fulfill her promise, it would bring psychological harm to the child, so she could not help but say it.

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Sister – in – Law, I’m not trying to coax Nan Nan. Our company has been planning to move our headquarters to the city for a long time. If nothing goes wrong, it should be implemented in the second half of this year. By then, you can change to a suitable position and go back to the city to work, right?”

“I ... What can I do?” Lin Yue ‘e felt a little unconfident.”I can be considered to have some experience in managing an Orchard, but if it’s an office job ... I ... I don’t know anything!”

“No one is born with that.” Xia ruofei said,”sister – in – Law, you have a high school education and you know some basic computer operations. As long as you go through some training, you can at least be a normal clerk, right?”

Xia ruofei paused and continued,””It’s a realistic problem for Nan Nan to go to school. If you are in charge of the orchard business, you will not be able to take care of it at the same time. So, I think you can consider my suggestion and try to change your style. ”

Xia ruofei’s words made Lin Yue ‘e fall into deep thought. She had really listened to him. For the sake of her daughter’s growth, it was obviously not the best choice to work on the farm in the suburbs for a long time. If she could work in the city, it would just be a little harder on her own. However, she would not miss out on her child’s growth.

Lin Yue ‘e pondered for a long time before finally nodding and saying,””Mm! RUO Fei, I will seriously consider it. But at this stage, I’ll take care of the orchard first. Even if I have to hand it over to other colleagues in the future, I won’t leave them with a mess. ”

Xia ruofei nodded and asked with a smile,””So ... You agree with our suggestion to let Nan Nan stay with godmother temporarily?”

Lin Yue ‘e turned her gaze to uncle Luo and asked,””Dad, what do you think?”

Uncle Luo usually let Lin Yue ‘e make the decisions for the family. However, Lin Yue’ e was very respectful to her father – in – Law, so she had to listen to his opinion on such matters.
