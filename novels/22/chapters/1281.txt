Chapter 1282: Super Sea View House (1)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei did not fall for Guo Hongjiang’s words.

When he was searching on his phone just now, he caught a glimpse of the housing prices in the shallow bay Area.

“Director Guo, I’ve misunderstood the size of the house. It’s indeed smaller than I thought.” Xia ruofei said,”but I’ve checked the price of the house just now. A penthouse of nearly 2000 square meters is worth at least 40 million Hong Kong dollars. I can’t accept such an expensive gift!”

Guo Hongjiang quickly explained,”Mr. Xia, some things really can’t be measured with money!” You know how much I love the star of Hong Kong, and you saved its life. It’s not something that can be exchanged with money! I just wanted to express my gratitude. You can’t reject me for this, right?”

After he finished speaking, Guo Hongjiang quickly gave MA Xiong a look.

He and MA Xiong had been old friends for many years. Even if they did not share the same thoughts, they at least knew each other very well.

MA Xiong naturally knew what Guo Hongjiang was thinking. Of course, he was happy to make Guo Hongjiang and Xia ruofei become friends. Otherwise, he would not have deliberately revealed some information to Guo Hongjiang on the day of the auction.

Therefore, after MA Xiong saw the look in Guo Hongjiang’s eyes, he immediately understood and nodded slightly.

MA Xiong then said with a smile,”Xia Sheng, since director Guo is so sincere, why don’t you accept it?” You’ve done him such a big favor, so you should at least let him express his gratitude! Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to live with himself ...”

“Yes, yes, yes! Mr. Xia, Chairman MA has spoken my mind!” Guo Hongjiang also said quickly.

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly.”Old Mr. MA, it’s not that I’m being unreasonable. If it’s an ordinary gift, I definitely wouldn’t reject it. However, a property worth tens of millions ...”

“This amount of money is nothing to director Guo.” MA Xiong laughed and said,”and you rejected the first gift. He changed it and you still don’t want it. This ... This is a little too ...”

“But ...”

“Xia Sheng, don’t say ‘but’!” MA Xiong said with a smile,”I know what you want to say. This amount of money is nothing to Chairman Guo. Besides, this building was originally developed by their family, so the cost isn’t as high as you said. You’re only talking about the market price!”

Xia ruofei shook his head helplessly and said,””AI! Since that’s the case, I’ll accept it!”

He knew that if he didn’t take over the house, the atmosphere would be tense. He had to give MA Xiong some face.

Now Xia ruofei also realized that the first gift he took out was just a cover. Guo Hongjiang liked the “star of Hong Kong” so much, why would he give it to someone else? His real purpose should be to give away this house.

Xia ruofei even thought that if he said that he didn’t want the house anymore and wanted the “star of Hong Kong” instead, he didn’t know what Guo Hongjiang’s expression would be like.

Of course, Guo Hongjiang didn’t know what Xia ruofei was thinking. He was happy to see that Xia ruofei had finally accepted the house.

“That’s great!” Guo Hongjiang said,”xiasheng, I still have a power of attorney here. After you sign it, you don’t have to worry about the transfer of property ownership. I’ll help you settle everything on my side. It won’t delay you from going home tomorrow!”

“Alright then!” Xia ruofei said,”thank you, director Guo!”

“Mr. Xia, please don’t stand on ceremony!” Guo Hongjiang quickly said,”I should be the one thanking you! It’s just a small gift. I saw that you don’t have a place to stay in Hong Kong, and this property has been vacant for a long time, so I thought of giving it to you. This way, when you bring your family and friends to Hong Kong for a trip in the future, you won’t have to stay in a hotel!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.

He knew that since he had accepted such a big gift from Guo Hongjiang, he would definitely not stand by and do nothing if Guo Hongjiang really needed his help in the future.

However, Xia ruofei did not reject this.

After all, Guo Hongjiang and MA Xiong were good friends. From the information found on the internet, Guo Hongjiang had a good reputation. The key was that he was very patriotic. He had always criticized the bad habits of Hong Kong Society with a clear flag. It could be seen from his performance at the last auction that he was indeed a patriotic businessman.

Today, Guo Hongjiang was considered to be full of sincerity. Xia ruofei did not mind making another friend.

Soon, the Butler came over and asked Xia ruofei to sign the transfer agreement and the letter of authorization.

Watching the Butler leave with the folder, Guo Hongjiang was very happy. He raised his glass and said,””Come on, Chairman MA, Mr. Xia, let’s drink! I’m so happy to be able to meet a young man like Mr. Xia!” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

After the drinking session, Xia ruofei was naturally fine, but the two old men were drunk.

However, Xia ruofei felt a little dizzy when he was on his way back to the MA residence.

He had earned a house just by drinking?

Furthermore, it was a penthouse mansion on the Repulse Bay Road in Hong Kong’s prime location?

Of course, Xia ruofei felt that it was not real. In fact, he did not lack money. He knew very well that if his medical skills were to be publicized, those super – rich people would probably line up to give him money, just like what Guo Hongjiang did today.

However, Xia ruofei would not do that.
