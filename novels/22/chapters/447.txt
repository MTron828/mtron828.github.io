Chapter 448: Elder song’s big gift (2)

Ling Qingxue blushed.”Big sis Wu, it’s all that guy’s fault. He’s so bad!” She said.

Ling Qingxue’s prejudice against Wu Liqian had long disappeared. Naturally, she also called Wu Liqian “sis Wu” like Xia ruofei.

“Xia, I’ve been waiting for a long time,” Wu Liqian said with a smile.”It’s time for me to see elder song’s calligraphy, right?”

“Yes, yes, yes,” Ling Qingxue said immediately.”Let’s open it and see what the chief wrote for you.”

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly,”we can’t do it here!” If you break it by accident ... Let’s go to the office!”

The ribbon – cutting of the building had been completed, but the relocation was still in progress. In fact, the main areas were security and finance. The company’s framework had not been set up yet, and there was no large administrative team.

However, Xia ruofei’s chairman’s office had been tidied up immediately, so he brought Ling Qingxue and Wu Liqian to the office on the second floor.

Although Xia ruofei did not want to be extravagant and wasteful, the office was still more than 80 square meters. It had a reception area, a lounge, and a secretary’s office. Of course, Xia ruofei did not need a full – time Secretary now, so the office was empty.

The office’s decorations were made of the best materials, but there was still a faint smell of decorations. He could only open the windows to let in the air, and it would be fine after a while.

Fortunately, Xia ruofei did not have the awareness to work for a long time. He was used to being a hands – off shopkeeper. Today, he had only come to this office to find a place to observe elder song’s precious calligraphy.

After the three of them entered the house, Xia ruofei took the paper box from Ling Qingxue and opened it. There were two rolled up pieces of rice paper inside.

Xia ruofei took out the bigger piece of paper and pressed one end on the paperweight on his desk. Then, he carefully and slowly unfolded it.

Elder song’s calligraphy was slowly revealed to everyone.

“My heart is far away from me.”

This was a famous sentence from Tao Yuanming’s “the origin of peach blossoms,” which was suitable for the Tao Yuan company.

Moreover, elder song’s signature and seal were not missing from this piece of calligraphy. It was a complete inscription.

This value was high.

To Xia ruofei’s surprise, elder song’s handwriting was elegant and did not have the murderous aura of a man from the military. However, one could still vaguely feel a trace of golden spear and iron horse’s artistic conception between the strokes.

In fact, elder song’s early works were silver hooks and iron drawings, and the force penetrated through the back of the paper. People who knew the industry could tell at a glance that this was the work of a great general.

However, as elder song’s status rose, his calligraphy style gradually changed. He no longer showed off his abilities and became more of a biding – time artist.

But this time, elder song had experienced a serious illness, and it seemed that his perception of life had also undergone a great change. His calligraphy had also become more otherworldly. In addition, this time, he was writing a famous sentence like “the origin of peaches,” which brought out the best in this calligraphy style.

Xia ruofei also noticed that the words “for my young friend ruofei” were written at the end of the piece of calligraphy.

If this was the work of a famous calligrapher, after it was marked as a gift to someone, it might cause the market value of the work to decline. The reason was simple. People who had money to buy collectibles were most likely unwilling to buy a work that was written as a gift to another person, let alone hang it at home.

However, elder song’s inscription was the exact opposite.

First of all, Xia ruofei would never sell this piece of calligraphy. Even if he was poor to the point of insanity, he would never do that.

In this case, the calligraphy that elder song had given to Xia ruofei was definitely a super protective talisman. Even those powerful families would have to think twice if they wanted to touch Xia ruofei.

Elder song’s gift was too valuable! Xia ruofei couldn’t help but sigh in his heart.

Ling Qingxue saw elder song’s name at the bottom of the page and the words “gift to Xia ruofei” written on it. She was very excited and felt as if she was in a dream.

Wu Liqian was full of envy. At the same time, she also felt a little pity for Yingluo. If Xia ruofei was someone in the system, this piece of calligraphy could save him many years of hard work.

At that moment, Ling Qingxue saw another rolled up piece of rice paper at the side. She couldn’t help but ask curiously,””Ruofei, there’s another one! Quickly open it and take a look!” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

In fact, Xia ruofei had also noticed it. However, his attention was attracted by this “self – biased” painting and he did not care about the smaller one.

Hearing what Ling Qingxue said, Xia ruofei’s curiosity was piqued.

Elder song had written for him, and one piece was enough. In fact, there was no point in writing another piece. Why did the old man write two pieces at once?

Under the curious gazes of the two beauties, Xia ruofei slowly unfolded the piece of paper.

When the contents were presented, the three of them gasped at the same time and revealed a look of disbelief.

This piece of calligraphy was smaller than the previous one, and elder song didn’t sign his name or stamp. There were only four big words, but the shock it brought to the three of them was greater than the previous one.

Because the content of this piece of calligraphy was full of envy for the Paradise Farm.

Yes, this piece of xuan paper only had the words “Peach Blossom Farm” on it, but the meaning behind it was extraordinary.

A bureau chief at elder song’s level basically wouldn’t give an enterprise a name, let alone a small enterprise like Taoyuan farm.
