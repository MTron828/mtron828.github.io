2053 Meeting Monica again (1)

This time, they didn’t need to go to Germany for a transfer flight. The Gulfstream plane’s cruising speed was faster than ordinary commercial planes, so after more than nine hours of flight, the plane entered the airspace of Turin and began to descend slowly.

Moreover, the comfort of taking a luxury business jet was naturally not comparable to that of an ordinary flight. Even the first – Class cabin was on a completely different level from a private business jet.

Xia ruofei even slept on the big bed in the luxurious bedroom in the back cabin for a short while during the journey. After he got up, he enjoyed the Western food and red wine that the flight attendant had carefully prepared. Then, he went to the cockpit to take a look. The plane had basically started to approach.

The two pilots, who had been flying in shifts for more than nine hours, were about to enter a relatively busy period again. Xia ruofei naturally returned to the cabin and fastened his seat belt.

About 20 minutes later, the Gulfstream G650 commercial plane landed smoothly on the runway.

In general, this kind of long – distance flight would be equipped with two crew members, at least three to four people, so that they could take turns to rest. However, it was not so easy for the pilots of the commercial plane. Only two people cooperated with each other throughout the entire flight.

Fortunately, the entire flight was less than ten hours long. Although the two captains looked tired, they were in good condition.

Moreover, their usual flight missions were many times easier than that of Civil Aviation pilots. Occasionally, they would have one or two relatively difficult flights, but they would not have any complaints.

Xia ruofei went to the cockpit to express his gratitude to the two captains and asked them to bring the crew to the hotel to rest. He would be waiting in Turin for the next few days in Italy.

Xia ruofei carried a simple suitcase and walked out of the cabin along the accommodation ladder. Then, he walked along the VIP passage and quickly passed the customs inspection. He walked out of the restricted area with light steps.

“Xia!”

Xia ruofei looked towards the source of the voice. Among the people who were waiting to receive him, the blonde Monica’s tall figure was so outstanding. She was jumping happily and waving at Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei also smiled warmly. He dragged his small suitcase and quickened his pace.

“Monica!” Xia ruofei came to Monica and smiled.”Long time no see!”

Monica’s eyes were misty. She hugged Xia ruofei tightly without a word.

This action also caused the two burly men behind Monica to reveal a hint of surprise. However, they did not dare to come forward and disturb Yingying at this time. After all, Monica’s words held enormous weight in the entire Grao family. Her power was even greater than that of Calas.

Monica might have acted like a little girl after Xia ruofei’s appearance, but in fact, she had shown her iron – handed methods in the past few days. Some family members who found evidence of corruption were all ruthlessly expelled from the family. A few insatiable people were even sent to prison.

He had called the police in the name of his family’s company, claiming that he had taken over his position.

What awaited these guys would be jail time of different lengths.

Monica used the power of the Hong sect in China to make a large scale adjustment to the personnel of the family and supported a group of loyal subordinates. On the other hand, they dealt a heavy blow to the people of the original Calas ‘faction. In just a few days, they had completely controlled the situation.

Monica was no longer the helpless little woman from back then. She was the Queen of the Grao family in the true sense.

Monica smelled the familiar scent on Xia ruofei’s body and mumbled,””It feels so good to see you again ... I thought I would never see you again in my life ...” He said.

In Europe, goodbyes and reunions often occurred at airports and train stations. Everyone was used to hugging and kissing goodbye. The passengers who passed by the two of them all gave them kind smiles.

Xia ruofei patted Monica’s back and laughed.”Why would I? It’s just that I was a little busy some time ago, so I’m here now, aren’t I?”

Then, Xia ruofei caressed Monica’s hair and said softly,””I really didn’t know that you were in such a dangerous situation at that time. I wasn’t able to appear by your side when you needed me the most. In my heart ...”

“No, Xia, no matter when, it’s enough to see you!” Monica said,”it’s all in the past. I’m fine now. Rousey is fine too ...”

When Monica mentioned Rousey, Xia ruofei immediately asked,”By the way, where’s your brother? I’d like to check his condition as soon as possible. ”

Although Monica did not have much hope for treatment, Xia ruofei could not wait to ask to treat Rousey the moment they met. This still made her feel warm inside.

She wriggled out of Xia ruofei’s arms and said,””The car is outside! I’ll take you home. Rousey can’t move, so I didn’t take him out. ” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Then what are we waiting for? let’s go!” Xia ruofei said,”the treatment is more important!”

After he finished speaking, he walked out.

Monica’s two burly men had already helped Xia ruofei with his luggage. The group walked through the airport Hall and headed outside.

A Bentley was parked quietly in the parking space outside the airport. The driver, who was wearing a suit and white gloves, was already waiting beside the car. When he saw Monica coming out, he quickly opened the door.
