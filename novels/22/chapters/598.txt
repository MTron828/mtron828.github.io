Chapter 599: Space Dahongpao (2)

Ling Xiaotian chuckled.”I understand. Ruofei, I was just saying. I didn’t take it to heart.”

“That’s good ... I was afraid that you would blame me!” Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”by the way, uncle Ling, where’s Qingxue?” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Qingxue originally wanted to stay and look at your Red Arowana.” Ling Xiaotian said,”however, the branch below has some urgent matters and I can’t leave. So, I asked her to handle it.”

Xia ruofei suddenly realized that Yingying had said a few days ago that he would be coming to the jiangbin villa today. If there were no special circumstances, Ling Qingxue would definitely not be absent.

Thinking of this, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but ask with concern,””Uncle Ling, is the company’s matter serious? Do you need my help?”

Ling Xiaotian chuckled.”There’s no need, there’s no need. It’s just a normal business matter. Qingxue will handle it well. Don’t worry!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”okay!” Uncle Ling, I’ll go back first. Thank you for today!”

“Let’s leave after dinner!”

“No, thanks. I’ll go cash the check before the bank closes.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”when our imitation wild Chinese perch is out, I’ll have a few more drinks with you!”

“Good, good, good. I’ll be waiting then!” Ling Xiaotian laughed as he spoke.

Xia ruofei waved goodbye to Ling Xiaotian and drove away from the jiangbin villa.

On the way, Xia ruofei found a bank and cashed all four checks into his personal bank card.

To cash in four such large cash checks in one go naturally caused a small commotion within ICBC. The manager personally led Xia ruofei to the VIP room and served him a cup of good tea. The cashier in the VIP room who was handling the cash flow looked at Xia ruofei in a different light, as if water was about to drip out of her eyes.

......

Xia ruofei had tens of millions of assets at such a young age. At first glance, he didn’t seem to be the handsome type, but he had a very comfortable temperament, as if he had a natural affinity. The beautiful saleswoman looked at Xia ruofei a few more times and couldn’t help but feel her heart beat faster, and her face blushed.

Unfortunately, Xia ruofei turned a blind eye to her flirtatious looks. After settling the business, he immediately left the bank and drove back to Taoyuan farm.

Now, including the income from selling the tin bucket a few days ago, Xia ruofei had more than 50 million in his account. All the money was in his personal account. Besides the 5 million he had transferred to the company’s account a few days ago to pay for the recent project, he still had about 50 million in his bank card.

Xia ruofei was planning to look for MA Xiong from Hong Kong to purchase a batch of Jade from Hengfeng jewelry.

During this period of time, he had been expanding and investing. It had been a long time since he had spare money to buy jade. The upgrade of the spirit map space was almost stagnant.

Although Xia ruofei knew that 50 million Yuan of Jade was not enough to upgrade the realm, he believed that with his current rate of earning money, the realm would be upgraded soon.

Besides, in addition to buying jades, he could also absorb the mysterious black stones through the Spirit map scroll. The efficiency of absorbing black stones was much higher than absorbing jadeite.

However, this type of black stone was neither gold nor Jade. Xia ruofei had searched for it on the internet for a long time but could not find it for sale. Hence, this was not something that could be solved with money. It might require a little luck.

After Xia ruofei returned to the farm, he thought about buying the Jade sooner rather than later, so he called Ma Zhiming.

When Ma Zhiming received Xia ruofei’s call, he was rather enthusiastic.””Mr. Xia, nice to meet you!”

“Hello, Mr. MA.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I have something to trouble you with again ...”

“Mr. Xia, just tell me directly if you need my help!” Ma Zhiming immediately said. You’re welcome ... You’ve helped my family so much, I don’t know how to repay you!”

Xia ruofei said,”Mr. MA, I’m looking for you because of the Jade material. This time, I want to buy a Jade material worth about 50 million Chinese dollars. I don’t have the channels in this area. So, I would like to buy it from Hengfeng jewelry.”

“No problem, no problem!” Ma Zhiming said without hesitation,”I’ll immediately inform the branch in San Shan to get ready. Mr. Xia, the 50 million Yuan worth of Jade may need to be transferred from another place, and it will take at least two days. Are you in a hurry?”

“It’s not a problem to wait for two days. ” Xia ruofei said,”Mr. MA, I’ll have to trouble you then.”

“You don’t have to be polite!” Ma Zhiming said,”by the way, Mr. Xia, I also have something I need to trouble you with ...”

“Go ahead,”

“Huixin mentioned it to you last time. It’s one of her friends. Her child is in the same condition as Huanhuan. She’s been seeking medical treatment all over the world for many years, but there hasn’t been any effect ...” Ma Zhiming said.

Xia ruofei suddenly remembered that professor Tian had mentioned it to him before. However, Xia ruofei was busy at that time, so he told him to postpone it for a while.

Xia ruofei quickly replied,”Oh, I know about this!” Mr. MA, I’m a little free these days. Ask your friends to come to the three mountains to find me!”

Since he had promised to treat her, Xia ruofei would not go back on his word.

Besides, he had already accumulated more than 70 spirit Heart Flower petals, so it was no big deal to use one.

Ma Zhiming was overjoyed when he heard this and quickly said, “That’s great! Mr. Xia, thank you ...”

“You’re welcome,” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Mr. MA, I hope you can tell your friend about this as well. Just try not to spread this matter. You know, I’m a person who’s afraid of trouble ...”

“I understand! Don’t worry!” Ma Zhiming quickly said,”Mr. Xia, Huixin has been thinking of going back for a vacation recently. Moreover, Huanhuan misses you too. I think we should ask Huixin to accompany her friend to the three mountains! As for the schedule ... What do you think about one week later?”

“No problem!” Xia ruofei replied readily,”tell them to call me when they reach San Shan!”

There were many employees at the farm now, so Xia ruofei did not plan to let the autistic child come to the farm.

……

In the next few days, Xia ruofei resumed his slow – paced life.

He was now counting down the days, waiting to take the soup again, and then try to unlock the last content about the spiritual puppet in the booklet.

Xia ruofei would enter the medium every day to play with Blackie and the rest. Then, he would patrol his territory like a Lord.

The rich spirit Qi in the spirit map space allowed the animals and plants to grow very well. The spirit map space was now full of life.

However, before the day of the pregnancy soup, Xia ruofei noticed that the Da Hong Pao tea tree had grown fresh leaves.

Counting the time, these 12 tea trees, which were directly cut from the mother tree, had been growing in the space for more than four years.

As for the ‘third generation’ Da Hong Pao that had taken the branches from the twelve tea trees, they had also grown for two or three years.

The spiritual Qi in this spatial zone was so dense that it had even formed a mist. The environment was unique, and the growth of the twelve Da Hong Pao tea trees was even better than in the outside world for five to six years.

Looking at the 12 luscious and fragrant tea trees, Xia ruofei suddenly had an idea. The “third generation” Da Hong Pao that he was going to cut might still be a little small, but these 12 tea trees were ready to be harvested!

Moreover, judging from the condition of the tea leaves, it was just the right time to pick them.

The flow of time in the original space was thirty times faster than the outside world. If he missed this harvest, Xia ruofei would have to wait another twenty to thirty days.

When this thought arose, it became uncontrollable.

Xia ruofei could not wait to test the quality of the Dahongpao tea leaves produced by cutting the leaves from the 12 tea trees.
