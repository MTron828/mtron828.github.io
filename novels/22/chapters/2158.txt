2159 The world stone in the sundry box (2)

What would it become if the area of the space continued to expand?

A huge continent? The vast ocean? Or even ... A planet? Or was it a bigger and wider space?

The spirit map space was Xia ruofei’s capital to settle down. It was his core interest. Everything related to the spirit map space was his top priority.

His hands trembled slightly as he opened the box.

There were no restrictions or barriers, and no attack arrays were triggered. The box was just quietly placed there, no different from an ordinary farmer’s toolbox.

Xia ruofei’s eyes fell on the inside of the cage.

It really did look a bit like a “toolbox.” The things inside were a mess. There were a few pieces of good quality Jade, a few half – finished sword blanks, and even a stack of yellow joss paper used to draw talismans. In short, there were all kinds of things inside, but they didn’t seem to be anything important. They were more like some miscellaneous things. No wonder they were so casually placed together without any formation or restriction.

Even Xia ruofei, a Qi refining cultivator, didn’t feel that these things were very precious.

Of course, Xia ruofei’s main goal was the world stone.

He took out the “junk” and put them aside. Soon, his eyes lit up because he had already seen a thin layer of black stones at the bottom of the box. That familiar aura told him that this was the world stone that he had been searching for.

It really didn’t take much effort to find it!

Xia ruofei couldn’t wait to use his spiritual power to scan it and immediately got an accurate number. 35 pieces! Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

His heart could not help but beat faster. This was the first time he had obtained so many world stones in one go.

With this batch of world stones, it wouldn’t be a problem for him to upgrade his space by one or two levels!

Xia ruofei didn’t know why Daoist priest bi youzi had classified the world stone as ‘junk’. It had been placed in the cage without any restriction.

He could only vaguely guess that the world stone only involved relatively high – Level spatial laws. Although bi youzi’s cultivation level was not bad, his comprehension of spatial laws might not be deep. It was very likely that he did not even know how precious the world stone was, which was why he had casually placed it with these items.

Of course, this was just Xia ruofei’s guess. Only bi youzi himself knew the exact situation.

The White realmfox in the medium was also jumping for joy and was eager to’ divide the loot ‘.

Xia ruofei waved his hand and all the world stones at the bottom of the box were kept into the spirit map space.

Of course, he didn’t let the space directly absorb the world stone. He was still thinking about the threat of that giant python and didn’t dare to stay in green touring immortal abode for too long.

In addition, he didn’t know how long it would take for the space to absorb the world stone and upgrade. He thought that it would be better to wait until he left green Immortal Island safely and reached the vast sea where no one would disturb him. Then, he would let the space absorb it in peace.

After Xia ruofei kept the world stone, he walked out of the palace.

He knew that there might be some things in this immortal abode that weren’t protected by array formations, just like this world stone. If he searched carefully, there should still be a chance to “pick up” the leftovers, but he didn’t intend to do that.

The main thing was that it was too much of a waste of time. The things in this immortal mansion would be his sooner or later, so why bother to search for them now? As long as he completely refined the mansion – guarding wooden token, no corner of the entire immortal mansion would be able to escape the search of his mind. As long as his mind moved slightly, he could take anything he wanted.

If the purpleblood spirit Python was still thinking about the pond, it would have returned to the pond by now. However, Xia ruofei still felt that it was a fluke. He decided to leave as soon as possible.

As he flew toward the stone door, he sent a wisp of his consciousness into the spirit map space.

The White realmfox was looking at the pile of realm stones floating in the air above the mountain and sea realm, protected by layers of small spaces. It was drooling non – stop.

With a thought, Xia ruofei took out ten world stones and pushed them in front of the white fox.

Seeing this, the White realmfox was stunned for a moment. Then, it immediately showed a very dissatisfied look, waving its forelimbs and squeaking.

Xia ruofei used telepathy.”Little guy, I’ve already given you 30%. Are you still not satisfied?”

The White realmfox was trying its best to gesture with its forelimbs. However, each of its forelimbs only had four toes. No matter how it gestured, it could not accurately express its meaning.

But Xia ruofei understood. He sneered,””Little guy, what are you thinking? And you want a 50 – 50 split?”

The White realm Fox squeaked and gestured.

Xia ruofei replied telepathically,”yes!” You’re the one who sensed the world stone, but what could you have sensed before the appearance of the green Immortal Island? You only sensed it after I was sucked in by the White mist of the immortal Island. Even without you, wouldn’t I have been able to explore this green immortal mansion? And after I refine the mansion – guarding wooden token, I can take anything in the entire green touring immortal abode as I please!”

Naturally, the White realmfox was not satisfied with the distribution ratio. It tried to argue with Xia ruofei using its body language.

Xia ruofei said,”little guy, even if we find these world stones under your guidance, I can’t possibly split it 50 – 50 with you!” You’ll be in charge of sensing the location of the world stone. I’ll face all the dangers we’ll encounter in the process of searching for the world stone alone. Tell me honestly, without me, even if you were lucky enough to find this immortal Island, would you have been able to escape the attack of the giant python? Can you understand the principle of the protective barrier? That’s impossible! So if it were you, you could only watch helplessly. You wouldn’t even be able to find the door to the immortal estate, much less find the world stone. I’ve paid so much, shouldn’t I get more?”

Xia ruofei’s glib tongue rendered the white fox speechless.

Xia ruofei looked at the unwilling expression on the white fox’s face. He smiled and said telepathically,””Alright, alright! With such a small stomach, it won’t be easy for you to digest too many world stones at once ... I promise you that in the future when we work together, I’ll at least give you a 30% share. If you contribute more, I’ll raise it to 40%. For example ... Unlike this time when I accidentally came to the immortal Island, I relied on your sensing ability to discover the existence of the world stone. Without your sensing ability, I might have missed the opportunity to obtain the world stone. In that case, I’ll give you an extra ten percent! However, I definitely won’t agree to a 50 – 50 split. At most, I’ll give you 40%! After all, I contributed more!”

Hearing this, the White realmfox reluctantly nodded.

After accepting this split, the White realmfox looked at the twenty – five world stones floating in the air with some envy. Finally, it accepted the reality and turned to look at the ten world stones that belonged to it.

The White realmfox was like a reincarnated Hungry Ghost. With a wave of its front paw, it sucked all ten world stones over. Then, it opened its mouth and began to chew. After a short while, all ten world stones were eaten by it.

Even for an adult, if he were to eat a large amount of food like ten world stones, his stomach would probably feel bloated and uncomfortable. However, this little fellow didn’t look that big, yet he could easily eat so much. Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be amazed.

Of course, he was more concerned about the world stone. It had actually been eaten by the realm Fox as food. What a waste of a heavenly treasure. Of all the things it could have used as food, it had to use such a precious world stone ...

After the White realm Fox ate the realm stone, it rubbed its slightly bulging stomach and lay down on the spot. It squinted its eyes and revealed a very enjoyable expression.

Slowly, it seemed to have entered a special state, and even its breathing became very slow, and mysterious ripples circulated around its body.
