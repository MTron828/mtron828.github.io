Chapter 3475: Setting foot on the return journey (1)

Translator: 549690339

When Xia ruofei heard the voice, his heart skipped a beat. He already had some guesses.

Naturally, Shen tianfang would not be able to return. Now that the light screen had opened and everyone was required to leave within a time limit, it meant that mu Hua’s situation was not good either. He was probably in the trial Pagoda like Shen tianfang.

As expected, the loud voice said emotionlessly,””The last cultivator in the trial Pagoda has left. If he doesn’t appear now, then he will never appear again … That’s all I have to say. Don’t waste any time here and leave quickly!”

After that, the voice fell silent, leaving only the light curtain Door standing quietly not far away.

All the cultivators fell into a dead silence.

Chen Xuan, Xu yurou, and mu Jianfei were completely stunned, as if they had been struck by lightning.

“How… How…” Chen Xuan mumbled.”Elder Shen’s cultivation is only second to my father’s. We’ve all left the trial Pagoda safely. How could he?”

Shen tianfang had the highest cultivation level among the cultivators who were exploring the mystic Luna realm this time. He had reached the intermediate stage of the Golden core realm, and his status in the first heaven sect was second only to Chen Nanfeng. It could be said that he was the cultivator who had the highest hope of breaking through to the advanced stage of the Golden core realm after Chen Nanfeng.

Such an important elder figure had actually died in the trial Pagoda without a sound?

Chen Xuan found it hard to accept this fact.

In reality, even though Chen Xuan had been eliminated early on, he had his own opportunities in the trial Pagoda. It could be said that he had gained quite a bit from this trial. When he returned to earth, he would most likely be able to use this gain to raise his cultivation by a huge margin.

Therefore, even though he said that he was envious of Ling Qingxue and the others, in reality, he didn’t think that he had failed this trial. He was even confident that the cultivators who had passed a few more levels than him might not have gained as much as he did.

However, upon hearing the news of Shen tianfang’s death, Chen Xuan’s good mood was instantly obliterated. For a moment, he was at a loss.

Mu Jianfei was also shocked and sad.

Elder mu Hua’s position in the vast waves sect was undoubted, and he was also very important. Now that he had fallen in this Mystic realm hundreds of thousands of miles away from earth, it was undoubtedly a very heavy blow to the vast waves sect.

The other cultivators felt the same way. They were all eliminated from the trial Pagoda one after another. While they were waiting, they were actually envious of Xia ruofei, Shen tianfang, and mu Hua. Since they had not come out for such a long time, it meant that they had passed more rounds. Logically speaking, they should have gotten more opportunities.

However, he did not expect that Shen tianfang and mu Hua had not come out. It was not because they had passed many levels, but because they had died in the trial Pagoda.

Both of them were Aurous core stage cultivators, and Shen tianfang was in the intermediate stage.

At first, everyone thought that although the trial Pagoda was difficult, at least safety was not a big problem. Now that they heard this news, they suddenly felt a little scared.

Especially Yang Liu of the flying flower Valley, he felt a burst of goosebumps in his heart.

The Qi layer cultivators all came out unscathed, and out of the five golden core cultivators that went in, three came out. As a golden core elder, it seemed that she was quite lucky to be able to leave the trial Pagoda safely.

Xia ruofei’s eyes narrowed. He was not as scared as Willow.

Xia ruofei judged that the trial Pagoda was still screening for something, so it was not too dangerous. However, there were definitely risks in the trial missions, including the process of him breaking through the levels. If his luck was bad, there was also the possibility of death.

In fact, the only one with such bad luck was mu Hua. Shen tianfang was courting his own death by having bad intentions towards Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei had directly killed him without any psychological burden.

In this way, the death rate was actually very low.

Moreover, mu Hua’s luck must have been bad to a certain extent. Otherwise, even if he was seriously injured, he would at least be able to keep his life.

No one spoke for a while, quietly digesting this shocking news.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,””Since things have come to this, brother Chen, brother Jianfei, please restrain your grief. We should leave this place!”

The loud voice had also said that the light curtain Door would only last for fifteen minutes. After that, the light curtain Door would disappear, and they would be trapped here forever.

Therefore, he should leave this place as soon as possible. There was no need to stay until the last moment. If there was an accident, the consequences would be serious. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Elder Shen and my father are very close, how am I supposed to explain this to my father?” Chen Xuan asked with a sorrowful expression. Brother RUO Fei, could you have made a mistake? Actually, elder Shen is only trapped in a certain level… We can’t just leave him behind!”

“Brother Chen, calm down!” Xia ruofei said. Elder Shen won’t be coming back. You have to accept this reality!”

Xia ruofei had killed Shen tianfang with his own hands. He had been reduced to ashes without a trace. How could he have come back?

Xia ruofei could understand Chen Xuan’s grief and his inability to accept reality, but he did not feel guilty at all. After all, it was Shen tianfang who wanted to kill Xia ruofei and take his treasure. He took the initiative to attack Xia ruofei..
