2952 Discussing strategy (2)

Xia ruofei nodded slowly. He basically understood after Luo Qingfeng’s explanation. As an “entrepreneur” who lived in modern society and owned a company with great business potential, it was not hard to understand the brand premium caused by the relationship between supply and demand and the monopoly of technology.

The products of the Paradise company were much more expensive than similar products, and people still went after them like a flock of ducks. Especially for a product like the jaded skin cream, whose effects far exceeded the competition and had no competitors at all, it was even more profitable.

The price of Qi gathering pills also followed this rule.

The gathering Qi elixir that contained 20 to 30 spirit stones was easily sold for 60 spirit stones, which meant that the selling price was almost three times the cost. The extra part was naturally the value of the technique. Qianqian couldn’t sell it for 20 to 30 spirit stones even if it cost 20 to 30 spirit stones! Without profit, who would be willing to work hard and not gain anything?

There was even a moment when Xia ruofei wanted to refine another batch of Qi gathering pills. It was too easy to make money here.

However, he still restrained his thoughts. No matter how popular this thing was, the law of rarity was eternal. One hundred Qi gathering pills was just the right amount, not too much but not too little. If he took out thousands of them at once, it was no doubt a fool’s dream to sell them at a high premium.

Therefore, even if he had to sell more Qi gathering pills in the future, he could not take out too many at once.

However, in this case, he might have to put something up for auction.

Ten thousand spirit stones might sound like a lot, but storage rings were very rare in the current cultivation world. Although the sect leaders, elders, protectors, and other high – Level members would have storage rings, there would still be many people who wanted to bid for storage rings in the auction. Even if they had no use for them, it would be very good to give them to Junior Disciples as a reward.

Hence, Xia ruofei had already predicted that the competition for the storage ring would be intense.

The exact price was still unknown, but 10000 spirit stones would probably not be enough.

After all, for the higher – ups of the sect, none of them had too little assets. Most of them could probably afford to fork out ten thousand spirit stones.

Just as Xia ruofei was thinking about what else he should bring to the auction, Luo Qingfeng said excitedly,””Master, the quality of your batch of Qi gathering pills is so high. We can’t sell them as ordinary Qi gathering pills, or it’ll be a huge loss!”

“Oh?” Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”how much do you want to sell it for?”

Luo Qingfeng was stunned for a moment.”Master,” he said,”when we provide the Qi – gathering pills to the fallen leaves sect, the host of the auction, we have to explain the quality of the batch of Qi – gathering pills. We have to let them emphasize it during the auction. Everyone here knows what’s good for them, so they’ll naturally raise the price after knowing the situation. ”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said with a smile,””Your reminder is right. Qingfeng, I’ll let you handle the submission of the items!”

“Yes! Master!” Luo Qingfeng said excitedly,”this old servant will definitely do a good job. Master, please rest assured!”

This was not Qingfeng Luo’s first time participating in an auction. Furthermore, the host of this year’s auction, the fallen leaf sect, had a lot of interactions with them, as they were on par with the star picking sect. He was also familiar with the higher – ups of the fallen leaf sect.

“Qingfeng, there are two things you need to remember,” Xia ruofei said after some thought.

“Master, please give me your orders!” Luo qingfen quickly said.

“First, you tell the falling leaves sect that during the auction, we will bid by bottle.” Xia ruofei said,”there are 20 pills in each bottle. We’ll auction them off in five batches!”

Li Yifu, who was at the side, smiled and said,””Martial granduncle, this move is brilliant! I’m sure we’ll make a lot more money this way than if we were to auction everything off!”

After all, Qingfeng Luo was not like Yifu li, who spent most of his time in the business world. He spent most of his time cultivating in the sect, so his marketing thinking was almost zero. Therefore, he did not understand the difference between the two.

In his opinion, wasn’t it the most convenient to auction all 100 Qi gathering pills together?

In the face of Luo Qingfeng’s question, Li Yifu smiled and said,””Sect leader Luo, there’s a big difference between selling them separately and selling them together. First of all, if they were sold separately, the price of each batch would definitely be much cheaper than if they were sold together. This way, some forces with insufficient financial resources could also participate. They might not be able to buy 100 pills in one go, but they could still compete for 20 pills. This way, with more people competing, the price would naturally go up. The second factor was marketing psychology. When people with a strong desire to buy saw bottles of Chi – amassing pills being sold one after another, and there were less and less left, they would feel more and more anxious, and they would hesitate less when bidding. Furthermore, only a small number of people managed to get it, so the huge demand would continue to be suppressed. The competition would become more intense towards the end, and the price would also increase. If we calculate it like this, the final price will definitely be much higher than the total price of the auction. ”

Luo Qingfeng was also dumbfounded after hearing this. He said with a bitter smile,””So there are so many tricks in this! Thanks to master’s reminder, we would have suffered a loss ...”

Li Yifu asked with a smile,”grand uncle – Master, how did I explain it?” I guess martial granduncle has more profound meanings that I can’t understand for the time being ...”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”no, no, no. You’re very comprehensive. It’s more comprehensive than I thought.” To tell you the truth, in terms of business, it’s no problem for you to throw me a few streets behind!”

“Senior granduncle, you’re being too serious!” Li Yifu quickly replied. I’m ashamed to say this, but it’s because of these mundane affairs that I’ve been taking up too much time in the past few years, causing my cultivation to stagnate ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”it’s not too late to work harder now!” I don’t dare to say what will happen after that, because I haven’t reached that level myself. But as long as you can successfully break through the bottleneck of the lianqi stage and build your foundation, I can guarantee that I will provide the resources to help you break through to the Jindan stage!”

“Thank you for your guidance, senior granduncle!” Li Yifu quickly stood up and said gratefully.

Xia ruofei waved his hand and turned to Luo Qingfeng, ordering,””Let’s continue with the previous topic. There’s a second point. You tell the person in charge of the auction of the falling leaves sect that when the first bottle of Qi gathering pills is auctioned, we allow everyone to recommend a highly respected senior to test the medicine. They can directly take one Qi gathering pill to test the medicine. At that time, for the bottle that has one less pill, we will naturally reduce the auction price by one twentieth. ”

“Yes!” Luo Qingfeng kept Xia ruofei’s words in mind.

Xia ruofei continued,”thirdly, when we emphasize the quality of our Qi gathering pills at the auction, we can directly promise that at least 80% of the Qi gathering pills in each bottle will have the spiritual energy of 40 spiritual stones. Moreover, there will be at least one Qi gathering pill that has the spiritual energy of 50 spiritual stones! If you can’t do that, we’re willing to compensate you ten times the price!”

After Xia ruofei had finished refining the Qi gathering pills in the medium, he had distributed the pills according to their quality into five porcelain bottles. Hence, he was very clear about the situation of these Qi gathering pills. In these five bottles, two of the bottles contained two pills with a spiritual Qi content of more than 50 spiritual stones. The other three bottles also contained one such high – Quality Qi gathering pill. And 80% of the quality that could reach the spiritual Qi content of 40 spiritual stones was also a standard that could be easily achieved. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

That was why Xia ruofei said those words with such confidence.

Luo Qingfeng did not doubt Xia ruofei at all. He said without hesitation,””Yes! Master, this old servant will remember it! Does master have any other instructions?”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”the matter regarding the Qi gathering pills is more or less settled. You can take these five bottles of Qi gathering pills with you. I’ll leave the rest to you.” Also, there’s something I’m not sure about, so please help me think about it!”

“Master, please speak!” Luo Qingfeng said quickly.
