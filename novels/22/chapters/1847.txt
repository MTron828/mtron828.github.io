Hence, the car arrived at the airport in no time.

On the way, Li Yifu made a few calls with his mobile phone and made arrangements for entering the airport.

When the car arrived at the airport, a Vice President of the airport Group was waiting in person. In addition, there were two pilots in flight uniforms with four bars on their sleeves, and three beautiful and slim flight attendants.

As soon as the car stopped, the staff member beside the Vice President immediately rushed forward to open the door of the back seat. When he saw the young Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue, he was stunned for a moment. His first reaction was that he had gotten the wrong car.

At this time, Li Yifu had already opened the door from the front passenger seat and stepped out of the car. The Vice President secretly glared at the staff who had just opened the door, and then came forward with a smile and extended his hands from a distance.

“Mr. Li, welcome, welcome!” The Vice President said,”I’m yang Wanxin, the Vice President of the airport Group. The Provincial Party Committee General office has already informed us. If Mr. Li needs anything, the airport will do its best to cooperate!”

Li Yifu casually shook hands with yang Wanxin and said lightly,””I’ve caused you trouble!”

Other than in front of Xia ruofei, Li Yifu always had the aura of a superior, and there was a faint sense of authority around him.

“I wouldn’t dare!” Yang Wanxin’s attitude was very humble.

Li Yifu wasn’t in the mood to chat with yang Wanxin. He turned around and walked to the car. He said to Xia ruofei,””Mr. Xia, miss Ling, this way please!”

He followed Xia ruofei’s orders strictly and addressed them as “Mr. Xia” and “miss Ling” in front of outsiders. Although the way he addressed them was not as shocking as the way he addressed them, his respectful attitude was still very obvious.

Yang Wanxin couldn’t help but be slightly stunned. Although Li Yifu rarely appeared in public, many people in the system knew him from his visit to the three mountains. Li Yifu even brought a brand new Gulfstream business plane. As the main leader of the airport Group, yang Wanxin naturally got to know this rich Chinese man from the United States very quickly.

Therefore, when he saw Li Yifu being so polite to the two young men, he was very shocked.

Yang Wanxin couldn’t think of anyone else who was worthy of Li Yifu’s respect.

If he was a rich man in China, he might be more polite to some of the second generation, but Li Yifu was an United States Chinese! With his wealth and status, even the leaders of the Provincial Party Committee and some of the big shots in the capital would be very polite to him. What kind of second generation could deserve such treatment from him?

Yang Wanxin couldn’t help but become very interested in Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue’s identities.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. Ling Qingxue held his arm and the two of them walked towards the crowd.

The flight crew who had been waiting there in advance also quickly greeted Li Yifu.

Li Yifu nodded slightly, then said to yang Wanxin,””President yang, I’m bringing my friend to see that plane. I’ll have to trouble you with the procedures for the plane’s entrance.”

“You’re too polite, President li!”Yang Wanxin quickly said. This way, please!”

The tarmac of the airport was a restricted area. Except for the staff with the pass, the rest of the people who wanted to enter had to go through a strict security check and go through the relevant procedures.

With the Vice President of the airport Group personally receiving them, these procedures were naturally completed very quickly. Soon, the group of people got on the shuttle bus arranged by the airport and headed in the direction of the long – distance plane.

Xia ruofei saw the Gulfstream G650 commercial plane from afar.

It was not only because the plane was parked far away from the terminal, but there were no other planes around, so it was very conspicuous. Another reason was that public planes were obviously smaller than other passenger planes. There were very few private planes in China, and now that there was only one parked at Sanshan airport, it was difficult not to recognize it.

The streamlined body of the plane glowed under the sun. When the shuttle bus approached, Xia ruofei realized that the plane was only slightly smaller than the mainstream planes of Boeing and Airbus. It was not the small plane that he had imagined. It was still relatively large among the public planes.

In fact, Xia ruofei had flown in MA Xiong’s private jet before. It was also a Gulfstream series. However, when he looked at it up close, he was still amazed. It was not for no reason that so many rich people chose the Gulfstream bugger plane.

When Xia ruofei saw the paint on the body of the plane, he was stunned for a moment. The tail of the mech was painted with the LOGO of paradise Corporation. The design on the body was mainly green. Although it was not sprayed with paradise vegetables, it was definitely in line with the elements of paradise Corporation.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but glance at Li Yifu.

“Mr. Xia, let’s get on the plane and take a look first!” Li Yifu said, a little embarrassed.

With outsiders around, Xia ruofei could not say anything to Li Yifu. He could only shake his head helplessly and walk towards the plane with him.

The flight crew had already lowered the accommodation ladder and were waiting under the cabin door.

When they arrived at the accommodation ladder, Li Yifu stood at the side and made a gesture, inviting Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue to board the plane first. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Yang Wanxin’s eyes twitched a few times at the sight.

Xia ruofei was no longer unfamiliar with the luxurious interior of the Gulfstream business plane when he entered the cabin. In the warm – colored cabin, the dark – colored mahogany texture coupled with the light – colored soft leather furniture formed a very modern feeling. Many parts were even inlaid with decorative strips of red sandalwood, which made it look quite high – Class.

There were four single – colored leather sofas with armrests in the front area, and they exuded a deadly charm.

The two – Color aerist leather sofa, the two – Color leather ceiling, and the leather wall at the bottom of the side cabin complemented each other.

The metal part glowed with a silver light. The floor was covered with a hand – made Italy wool carpet, which made it look noble and luxurious.

The lights on the top of the cabin emitted a soft light, making the entire cabin space seem even more dreamy.

Even though Xia ruofei had a net worth of more than a billion Yuan, and Ling Qingxue’s family was even richer than Xia ruofei ‘s, the two of them were still secretly amazed by the luxury of this private jet.

Li Yifu personally introduced the characteristics of this Gulfstream plane.””Mr. Xia, the Gulfstream G650’s maximum range can reach 13000 kilometers, and it is equipped with many advanced technologies. It has the fastest speed, the largest cabin space, and the longest flight distance among the commercial planes of the same class ...”

The two pilots on the side had nothing to do. Li Yifu took their work, but the three flight attendants were busy pouring tea for everyone.

Xia ruofei sat on the leather sofa, listening to Li Yifu’s introduction while looking around at the cabin.

Not only had Li Yifu painted the aircraft in paradise corporation’s style in advance, but he had also assigned the flight crew to Xia ruofei. Considering that Xia ruofei mainly used it in China, he had even specially found two experienced Chinese pilots and poached them from an official aircraft Company in the United States with a high salary.

In addition, he had also coordinated in advance with Sanshan airport. He could rent a hangar at any time, and the airport could also provide the necessary aircraft maintenance.

All the expenses incurred by the plane would be borne by Li Yifu’s Kyushu group.

Li Yifu had used his connections to settle the more troublesome domestic route application.

It could be said that as long as Xia ruofei agreed, he did not need to consider anything else. Li Yifu had arranged everything. Xia ruofei did not need to spend a single cent. Moreover, he could enjoy the luxury of having two pilots every time he went out.

Even Ling Qingxue, who was listening at the side, was very tempted.

Xia ruofei looked at Li Yifu’s attitude and knew that he did not give him any room to refuse. Although he was Li Yifu’s senior granduncle and Li Yifu would not dare to force him if he did not accept it, this was a little unreasonable.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and had an idea. He said,””Foster husband, I want to talk to you in private ...”
