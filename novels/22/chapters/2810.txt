2811 The victorious return (1)

The team’s bus was already waiting at the exit of the tunnel. While Xia ruofei and Ruby were attending the post – Match press conference, the other RCD Espanyol players had also packed up and were waiting for the two of them on the bus.

Although the away game was in the same city, the team had to take the bus back to the training base before they were dismissed.

Like most European clubs, the Spain ‘first team implemented a walking training system. The players usually lived in their own homes and just had to attend training on time every day.

In fact, everyone’s cars were parked in the parking lot of the training base. They had gathered in the hotel the day before the game.

After Xia ruofei and Ruby got on the bus, the players cheered and applauded.

After defeating the powerful arch – enemy of the same city, bar?a, the Spanish team was in a good mood. The team bus started slowly and drove out of nokapu.

On the road, groups of bar?a fans could be seen, and it was obvious that they were very depressed.

The loss was not as simple as losing to their arch – enemy in the same city. In fact, Barcelona was only three points ahead of Real Madrid at the end of the last round. Real Madrid won easily in this round, but Barcelona unexpectedly failed in the “gutter” of RCD Espanyol. As a result, the points of the two teams were actually the same, and Barcelona barely held the top spot because of the goal difference.

They could not afford to lose any of the games that followed, even if they were already leading for more than half a season. As long as they lost a game, Real Madrid was likely to catch up and eventually snatch the league title.

What made the bar?a fans gnash their teeth the most was that the Spaniards lost to Real Madrid without any resistance. However, when they faced bar?a, it was as if they had been injected with chicken blood, and they eventually won against bar?a.

In other words, not only did the Spaniards steal three points from Barcelona, but they also gave three points to Real Madrid a few rounds ago. They were really arch – rivals in the same city! It was simply too infuriating!

When the bar?a fans saw the Spanish team’s bus driving over, many of them stopped and booed at the bus. Some of them even made very inelegant gestures. In short, everyone’s eyes were very unfriendly.

If it wasn’t for the police cars escorting them, some of them might have done something irrational.

Of course, the police car escort was not a privilege. It was an arrangement made by the Barcelona police station for safety reasons. Every time Barcelona and RCD Espanyol had a Derby in the same city, the Barcelona police would break out in a sweat. Their work pressure was also very high.

Although they could see the bar?a fans booing them and raising their middle fingers from time to time outside the car window, the Spanish players in the car were not affected by it at all. They talked about the details of today’s game along the way, especially Xia ruofei’s hook kill in the last minute, which was mentioned the most.

In the end, no one knew who started it, but the players began to sing loudly in the bus, and the atmosphere in the bus was very enthusiastic.

Wu Lei was sitting beside Xia ruofei. He said,”Brother Xia, my teammates want to celebrate tonight. They asked me to invite you to join them.”

Although Xia ruofei was also a Spaniard, no one could ignore his other identity as the major shareholder of the football club. Therefore, when the players faced Xia ruofei, they were more or less nervous. Wu Lei and Xia ruofei were of the same race, and they clearly had a good personal relationship. That was why they had asked Wu Lei to come and invite them.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said with a smile,””I’m not going! If I go, they won’t be able to relax. It’s you, Lei Zi, who needs to participate. This is a good opportunity to integrate into the team and get closer to your teammates. ”

“I understand!” Wu Lei nodded and said.

“Drink as little as possible, you can’t drink too much!” Xia ruofei said seriously.

In the European arena, there had been a few players who were addicted to alcohol, and their careers had been seriously affected. Although Xia ruofei did not expect all the players to be as self – disciplined as the Ronaldo, he still had a bottom line.

There would be no matches in the next few days, and Ruby had given the team a day off. It was completely reasonable for everyone to celebrate their victory tonight and relax a little. However, it was not advisable to drink and have fun without restraint.

“Don’t worry, brother Xia!”Wu Lei laughed. I never drink!” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“That’s even better!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

The bus returned to the Dani – Halk training base. The players took their respective cars and left. The club sent another car to send Xia ruofei back to the hotel.

When Xia ruofei walked into the hotel lobby, he saw Zhou leiyun already waiting on the sofa in the guest area.

He walked up with a smile and asked,””Director Zhou, were you waiting for me?”

It was only then that Zhou leiyun noticed Xia ruofei. He quickly stood up and said,””President Xia, you’re back! Thank the heavens for this match! Of course, the most important thing is to thank you! If you didn’t run all the way back to participate in the competition, I’m afraid that our team would have been miserably abused by Bassa today!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you don’t have to thank me. After all, I’m a shareholder of the club.” Besides, I’ve heard so many thanks today that my ears are getting calluses ...”

Then, Xia ruofei asked again,”director Zhou, did you wait in the hotel lobby just to thank me?” Speak! What’s the matter?”

Zhou leiyun led Xia ruofei to the guest sofa and sat him down, then said,””Although I didn’t make a special trip here, I actually dropped your two friends off at the hotel. Then, I figured that you would be here soon, so I decided to wait for you here and talk to you ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”you want to talk to me?” Alright! Then say it!”

“Director Xia,” Zhou leiyun asked cautiously,”you’ve previously responded to the netizens ‘calls for you to join the national team on Weibo and in the headlines. I want to know ... Have you changed your mind?”

Xia ruofei laughed.”I’m not a three – year – old child. How can this change?” Besides ... Serving the country was an honorable thing! Why should I change? General manager Zhou, we have a good relationship, so if you have anything to say, just say it! Can you not be so hesitant?”

Zhou leiyun smiled awkwardly and said,”director Xia, it’s like this.” As for the Chinese Football Association ... I hope to meet you in person to understand your thoughts and discuss some specific details. The people from the Football Association have already arrived in Barcelona. They did not contact you in advance because they did not want to affect your training and preparation for the battle. Instead, they came to me ...”
