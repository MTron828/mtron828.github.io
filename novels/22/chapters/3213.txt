3214 The black Phoenix flying ship (1)

“Wait!” Layman Yuntai was not interested in the question that Xia ruofei wanted to ask him. He asked,”little fellow Xia, you mean ... You’ve already solved the secret of the floating point pattern?”

Xia ruofei casually set up a soundproof enchantment around himself and then continued to communicate with scholar Yuntai through spiritual sense,””It should be almost the same!”

“Quickly tell me! Quickly tell me!” Scholar Yuntai said impatiently,”in our era, many experts spent their entire lives studying the rising Dragon Order, but to no avail! You’re just a Jindan stage rookie, how did you manage to develop it in such a short time?”

Xia ruofei did not know whether to laugh or cry.”As long as we can find the right direction,” he said,”cracking the secret of the token seems to have nothing to do with cultivation!”

“So, you’ve found the right direction?” Scholar Yuntai said,”you used fufu points as numbers to crack the array?”

“To be more precise, each floating point corresponds to a set of numbers!” Xia ruofei said with certainty,”we can basically confirm this. We got an answer with more than 3000 sets of numbers.”

“And then?” Asked layman Yuntai.

“This is actually a piece of music score!” Xia ruofei said.

He then briefly explained the process of cracking the code to scholar Yuntai, and finally said,””Because the music that was selected is very special, and it definitely has an effect that can only be found in the world of cultivation, we have basically confirmed that so far, our direction is correct.”

“This is amazing!” Scholar Yuntai sighed with emotion,”I really didn’t expect that a few golden core and Qi refining cultivators could so easily solve the secret of the rising Dragon Order!” Also, is the supercomputer that you mentioned really that powerful?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”senior Yuntai, perhaps there hasn’t been much progress in the cultivation world for thousands of years. However, Ordinary People’s Society has changed a lot after thousands of years of development. Now, human technology is very powerful. It can even make up for the shortcomings of cultivators in many aspects. For example, the Super computer we’re using this time is such a case. If you use the human brain to calculate, you won’t be able to calculate it even if you spend your entire life because the amount of calculation is too large. However, for a supercomputer, it only takes a few hours to calculate!”

“It seems that I’ve disappeared for more than 3000 years, and the outside world has long changed!” Layman Yuntai said with emotion.

Xia ruofei asked,”so, does senior Yuntai also think that we’ve completed the cracking?” That’s right, just now, we found that everyone’s tokens had disappeared. It should be like what senior told me before. This token has been out for more than 300 years, and it’s time for it to disappear. Therefore, we no longer have any tokens for further research. Even if the high – definition image of the floating point pattern is saved, if the real secret is in the token itself, we have already lost the chance. ”

Scholar Yuntai said with certainty,””You don’t need the token anymore. If such an answer is not the message that the final token wants to convey, it can only mean one thing. The floating point pattern on the token is simply a deliberate mystery and has no practical significance!”

Then, he changed the topic and said,””However, every time the token disappears and reappears, the floating point pattern will be different from the last time, which means that the message it wants to convey will also change. So, the information you get this time may still be valid now, but it will be unclear after a long time.”

“We think so too!” Xia ruofei said,”that’s why we’re preparing to go and explore as soon as possible.”

“The moon you’re talking about?” Asked layman Yuntai.

“Yes! Therefore, I have some questions to ask you, senior!” Xia ruofei said.

“No one in our era has ever been to the moon!” Scholar Yuntai laughed and said,”I have never been to the moon myself, so you are asking the wrong person!”

“Senior Yuntai,” Xia ruofei said.”We really want to know if a spiritual treasure like an airboat can fly out of Earth and stay in outer space for a long time.”

Scholar Yuntai was stunned for a moment and said,””Earth? Are you referring to the world we live in? It really did look like a big ball, but it should have more water, right? Why is it called earth and not water ball?”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. How would he know why it was a conventional name?

However, after hearing what master Yuntai said, Xia ruofei knew that at least 3000 years ago, the cultivators had actually flown out of Earth. They did not know how far they had gone, but at least they had seen the Earth from space. Otherwise, master Yuntai would not have known that the world he lived in was a big ball, and most of it was covered by the ocean.

Xia ruofei said,”senior Yuntai, this ... I’m not too sure about the name. Anyway, it has always been called earth ... So, have you been to the space outside earth?” Did you take an airboat?”

Scholar Yuntai laughed and said,”you have too many questions. I’ll answer them one by one!” The cultivators of our era, as long as they are above the primordial soul Stage, have basically been to the earth ... Outside the earth, whether by flying boat or sword riding, it is not a problem to fly directly out. In fact, the real danger is the extreme cold of the outer space you mentioned, and there is no air to breathe. The environment is very harsh, and even the primordial soul Stage and even the leaving aperture stage cultivators find it difficult to survive for a long time. “FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com
