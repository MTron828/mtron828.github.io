2373 Difficult win_This time, Manzilla finally understood. He used his spiritual power to resist as he said,”You want to break ... Break my spiritual force defense, right? don’t waste your time ... It’s impossible!”

In the back and forth tug – of – War, Xia ruofei could finally accurately judge that Manzila’s spiritual power cultivation was at the middle stage of the ethereal heart palpitations. If it corresponded to his true Qi cultivation, it should be at refined Qi Level 5. However, in reality, Manzila’s true Qi cultivation was only at refined Qi Level 3.

It seemed that this was another person whose mental power cultivation had surpassed his true Qi cultivation! Xia ruofei thought to himself.

Manzila’s situation was quite similar to Xia ruofei ‘S. Xia ruofei was the same. In his cultivation career, his spiritual power cultivation was always higher than his genuine Qi cultivation, and it was several levels higher.

And now, he was a whole realm higher. Xia ruofei’s spiritual power had broken through a whole realm and reached the harmonious spirit realm.

Although there was a big difference between the two’s spiritual power, Manzila’s spiritual power Technique was obviously more special. Moreover, he only needed to defend, so for a short time, they were on the same level. This stalemate lasted for four to five minutes.

“Young man, give up!” Manzila gasped. You can kill me, but you can’t break my spiritual defense! There was such a big commotion here just now, the staff of the temple will come over to check soon, you don’t have enough time! Unless you kill all the staff of the temple! However, the capital is so close to us. With such a huge commotion, the Army will be here soon ...”

Xia ruofei frowned slightly. To be honest, a few workers of the temple could not do anything to him. Even if the arulei Army came, Xia ruofei would not care about this Motley Army. Their combat power was not even comparable to the modr mercenary group. They would be chopped into pieces if they came.

It was just that Xia ruofei was not used to killing the innocent. Be it the workers of the temple or the arulei Army, they did not commit such a serious crime.

However, Manzila was also very important.

It could be said that Xia ruofei’s main target in Africa was the leader of the modr organization, whose codename was Satan.

If he could not get Manzila to talk, he would not be able to find the mastermind behind song Qiming’s assassination. He could not place his hopes on bassoon, the head of the dark shadow team, to get information. What if bassoon did not know anything, too? Wouldn’t the clues be broken?

Moreover, there were very few cultivators nowadays. Xia ruofei was very interested in this African man who had practiced Chinese Daoist techniques. There were also the precious world stones. All of this had to be done with Manzila’s permission.

Xia ruofei had a headache.

In the current situation, it was impossible to hypnotize Manzila in a short time.

In addition, because his spiritual power defense was very strong, Xia ruofei could not directly put him into the spirit map space.

Xia ruofei squinted his eyes and thought for a while. Soon, he came up with an idea.

He grinned at Manzila, and then with a thought, he took out the set of array flags from the spirit map space.

Seeing Xia ruofei pull something out of thin air, Manzila temporarily forgot about his disadvantageous situation. His eyes lit up and he asked,”This ... This was taken out from a storage treasure? You actually have a storage treasure?”

“You should be more concerned about your current situation,” Xia ruofei said indifferently.

With that, he waved his hand and the array flags immediately floated in different directions, landing in their respective positions.

Xia ruofei picked Manzila up and brought him into the time array flag.

“This ... This is ...” Manzila looked at the array flags around him nervously.

He soon noticed the difference in the flow of time between the inside and outside. In fact, this was thanks to his careful observation. A leaf outside the window was falling. However, when he entered the range of the array flags, he immediately discovered that the fallen leaf seemed to have stopped in the air. If one observed carefully, they would notice that the leaves were still falling, but the speed of their descent had slowed down by dozens of times, giving off a sense of stillness.

“You can actually control time!” Manzila’s shock could not be any greater.

Xia ruofei looked at Manzila and said,””I didn’t expect Mr. Satan to have such good eyes ...”

After saying this, Xia ruofei did not waste any more time. He gathered his spiritual force and pressed it towards Manzila. Manzila quickly resisted with all his might.

In fact, Xia ruofei’s idea was very simple. He just wanted to buy more time.

What he lacked the most right now was time.

If Xia ruofei was given enough time, Manzila would definitely not be able to hold on. As there was a huge difference in their spiritual power, the total amount of their spiritual power was also very different. Xia ruofei continued to attack while Manzila’s spiritual power was constantly being consumed. Although Xia ruofei was also consuming his spiritual power, his total amount of spiritual power was much greater than Manzila ‘s. Moreover, he could also use spiritual water to replenish his spiritual power. Under such circumstances, it would be a miracle if Manzila could hold on!

The time array flag was to buy time for Xia ruofei.

Within the range of the formation, Xia ruofei sat on a Jade futon and continued to attack Manzila with his spiritual power.

This Jade futon was from the stone room in the mountain sea realm in the spirit map space. It had a good auxiliary effect on the recovery of spiritual power, so Xia ruofei simply took it out from the space.

Manzilla’s face became very ugly. He could clearly feel that his mental power was being consumed little by little, and the other party seemed to never know fatigue, and his mental power was pressing on him as if it was free.

Manzilla soon felt that his spiritual power was a little difficult to continue. At this time, he saw that the fallen leaf was still in the air outside the array, which meant that it could only be outside the array for a breath or two. His only hope had been destroyed, and Manzilla’s face became quite ugly. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

He managed to hold on for almost half an hour, and his mental energy was finally close to exhaustion.

Manzila felt a dull pain in his head, which was a sign of overexertion.

He looked at Xia ruofei who was opposite him. The last bit of hope in his heart had disappeared. Xia ruofei’s expression was still very relaxed. It was obvious that he still had a lot of spiritual energy.

How could they fight?

Manzila closed his eyes bitterly and gave up resisting with his spiritual power.

Naturally, Xia ruofei would not let go of such an opportunity. He directly increased the pressure of his spiritual force. Manzila’s eyes struggled for a while, and finally became confused and lost its usual spirit.

Xia ruofei did not take the opportunity to put Manzila into the medium as the environment in the medium was very good. Manzila would be able to recover her spiritual power quickly after she went in, and the external injuries that she had suffered today would probably heal faster. If Xia ruofei wanted to break through Manzila’s spiritual defense line again, he would have to spend a lot of time and effort.

Hence, Xia ruofei kept the time formation flag running while he asked Manzila.

“Where did you hide the world stones you collected?” Xia ruofei’s first question was about the world stone.

“World stone?” Manzila was confused.

Obviously, Manzila did not know that there was a precious treasure from China in his collection.

“It’s a little like a black stone, but it gives off a very heavy feeling. It should be able to be separated from ordinary stones.” Xia ruofei said,”think again. Where did you hide the world stone?”

Xia ruofei’s simple description allowed Manzila to find the item that fit the criteria. He said,””There’s a secret room built in my bedroom. All my things are inside, including a large black stone. It might be very similar to the world stone you’re talking about. ”

Xia ruofei did not notice that Manzila had said “big rock”. He quickly wrote down Manzila’s confession and the password needed to find and open the secret room.

He only recorded the information and did not search for it immediately.

As the interrogation was still ongoing, Xia ruofei had many important questions that Manzila had to answer.

Xia ruofei continued,”tell me about it. Some time ago, you sent out a small group of assassins to assassinate a Huaxia official, song Qiming.” I need to know the instigator of this case, your client, and his detailed information. “
