Translator: 5496903When she returned to the guest room with a flushed face, Song Wei felt as if she was floating in the clouds, or in a dream.

However, the strange feeling that remained in his body was very real.

This was different from the previous spirit and body combined cultivation. Although the contact between the soul and the body during the spirit and body combined cultivation was hard to erase, this intimate contact was different.

Song Wei touched her burning face and unconsciously, a bright smile bloomed on her face ...

She had been hiding in her guest room and did not even go out for dinner. Now that she saw Xia ruofei, she could not help but blush and her heart beat faster. In the end, it was Xia ruofei who asked Wu Qiang’s girlfriend, Xia Xiaolan, to send dinner to Song Wei’s room.

Even when Ling Qingxue returned to the courtyard house at night, Song Wei did not leave her room.

When Ling Qingxue returned, it was around Teno’ clock. She went to Xia ruofei’s room first, lay down on the sofa, and said,””I’m so tired today ... Ruofei, get me some water!”

Xia ruofei chuckled as he walked to the water dispenser, filled a cup of water, and handed it to Ling Qingxue. He said,””Did today go smoothly? How’s the situation at Ling Ji’s private kitchen?”

Ling Qingxue took a few sips of water and said,””At least nothing went wrong. All the private rooms in the private restaurant are full tonight. Senior brother Wu did his best. Fortunately, we prepared enough ingredients in advance. In general, the guests are very satisfied and are full of praise for our signature dishes!”

“That’s good! Everything is difficult at the beginning, so the first shot has already been fired. Ling’s reputation in Beijing’s upper – Class circle is slowly rising. ” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it will be much easier for Ling Ji to enter the northern market in the future. But ... The more you do this, the busier you’ll be! I really don’t know if it’s a good thing or a bad thing!”

Ling Qingxue rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei and said,”Are you hoping that our family’s business won’t do well? Of course, it was a good thing! In our company, my dad is also looking for a suitable professional manager. In addition, he’s also focusing on training a few senior brothers. In the future, I don’t have to do things by myself like now!”

Then, Ling Qingxue looked out the window at the courtyard and asked in surprise,””Wei Wei, you’re going to bed so early?”

Xia ruofei said unnaturally,””She went back to her room after dinner. Maybe she’s a little tired!”

Ling Qingxue didn’t think too much about it. She stretched and said,””I’m tired too ... No, I need to take a bath here and relax ... Help me fill the tub! I’ll go back to my room and get my clothes!”

“Yes, sir!” Xia ruofei replied with a smile.

He filled the jacuzzi in the bathroom and tested the water temperature.

Ling Qingxue quickly came in with her loungewear and went straight to the bathroom to take a bath.

The two of them chatted idly through the bathroom door. Ling Qingxue kept talking about what had happened at the Paradise gathering today. It was obvious that she was in a good mood because Ling Ji’s private kitchen had gotten off to a good start.

After Ling Qingxue was done with her bath, she did not wait for Xia ruofei to speak and said,””Don’t even think about it! You’ve caused me so much trouble yesterday! I’ll go back to my room to sleep tonight ...”

“I haven’t even said anything ...” Xia ruofei said, not knowing whether to laugh or cry.

“So, you don’t need to say anything ...” Ling Qingxue chuckled.

Then, without waiting for Xia ruofei to react, she carried the clothes she had changed out of and ran out of Xia ruofei’s house.

“I didn’t plan to let you stay the night ...” Xia ruofei muttered to himself with a bitter smile.”I’ve exhausted myself in the afternoon. I’d better rest and conserve my energy tonight!”

After that, Xia ruofei went to the bathroom and took a hot bath in the bathtub that still had a faint fragrance. Then, he went straight to the bedroom to rest.

……

In the next few days, Xia ruofei stayed at home except for one follow – up visit to elder Liu.

Ling Qingxue would still go to the Taoyuan club every day, but she didn’t stay there until 10 pm like the first day. She would basically have lunch at the Taoyuan club, then stay for a while before returning to the courtyard house in the afternoon.

Song Wei did not mention that she wanted to go back to school. The three of them lived in the master’s courtyard in the middle of liuhai Lane, maintaining their own tacit understanding.

Ling Qingxue and Song Wei both knew that Xia ruofei and the other were not just cultivating in the house. However, they did not point it out. The three of them maintained a delicate balance.

On the fifth day, Ling Qingxue decided to return to the three mountains. The Ling’s private kitchen of the Xuanji peach blossom gathering was basically on the right track. With the experienced senior brother Wu here, she could basically rest easy.

When she heard that Ling Qingxue was leaving, Song Wei immediately told her that she should return to school.

Xia ruofei was already mentally prepared for this. This was probably a tacit understanding between Ling Qingxue and Song Wei. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Hence, he informed the flight crew to apply for a flight route one day in advance. The next morning, he and Song Wei sent Ling Qingxue to the public jet named paradise. On the way back, they sent Song Wei to Capital University.

When they returned to the courtyard in liuhai Lane, Xia ruofei suddenly felt a little uncomfortable.

For the past few days, he had been accompanied by two beautiful women. His ears were also filled with Song Wei and Ling Qingxue’s crisp laughter. Now that the two of them had left, Xia ruofei suddenly felt that the courtyard was too quiet.
