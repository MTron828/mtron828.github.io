“Brother Liang, that’s the experimental plantation, right?” Xia ruofei pointed at the greenhouse in front of them and asked.

“Yup!” Liang Qichao nodded and said,”it’s about 200 mu in total. Let’s go eat first. I’ll arrange a time for you to inspect it later!”

The journey from Sydney to here had taken about three hours. It was already past one in the afternoon, which was why Liang Qichao suggested that they go for lunch first.

He couldn’t let the boss and the beautiful woman who came from far away inspect on an empty stomach, right?

“Alright! I’ll listen to your arrangements when I’m here!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Lin Qiao couldn’t help but click her tongue when she heard this. She had lived in Tao Yuan farm for a long time and was familiar with the situation there. She didn’t expect that Paradise Farm in Australia had a trial planting area of 200 mu, which was almost the entire area of Tao Yuan farm.

Of course, compared to the 6000 hectares of Paradise Farm, 200 acres of land was just a small part.

Soon, the car drove along the clean black asphalt road to the small farm by the artificial lake.

“We’re here!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Through the window, Lin Qiao saw the calm and clear Lake and the green grassland in the distance. From time to time, birds would fly over the lake, creating ripples on the mirror – like Lake. She couldn’t help but ask enviously,””Brother Liang, do you usually work here? The environment is too good!”

“It’s not bad to come here for a vacation occasionally,” Liang Qichao said with a smile.”It’s too boring to stay here for a long time. The Hunter Valley area is still considered prosperous, but the farms in Australia are more desolate! There’s no one within a 100 – kilometer radius, and it’ll take two to three hours to drive to the supermarket. ”

Xia ruofei jokingly said,”if you’re bored, you can apply to work in the United States at any time. It’s a world of sensual pleasures. I think Mr. Tang will agree.”

“Stop it!” Liang Qichao rolled his eyes and said,”I’m full of energy now! Don’t dampen my enthusiasm!”

Xia ruofei raised his head and laughed.

The car stopped in front of the small villa in the farm. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

This was where Liang Qichao worked and lived. The other farm workers had their own dormitories, while some lived in the Hunter Valley and drove home after work.

Of course, such a large farm definitely had its own security personnel. These people were usually responsible for patrolling the farm. Other than on vacation, they often stayed on the farm.

The three of them got out of the car. Liang Qichao took the responsibility of carrying the luggage. He quickly went to the back of the car and opened the trunk to take out Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao’s luggage. Then, he led the two of them into the villa.

Liang Qichao laughed as he walked,””I’ve already asked someone to prepare lunch. We’ll have it at home! You must be tired from the long journey. Take a rest here in the afternoon, and I’ll take you around the town in the evening. ”

“Alright, I’ll follow your arrangements for the next two days.” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Although Xia ruofei had brought Lin Qiao to Australia for a tour, as the boss, he had to stay at the Hunter Valley’s Paradise Farm for a day or two. He had to inspect the experimental planting base.

Of course, Xia ruofei wouldn’t stay in Paradise Farm all the time. Although the scenery here was picturesque, since he brought Lin Qiao out, he had to take a look around. Cities like Sydney and Melbourne were definitely a must.

The three of them talked as they walked into the villa.

The first floor of the small villa had a living room, dining room, an open kitchen, and an office that had been transformed from a guest room. This was where Liang Qichao usually worked.

As the three of them entered, a white uncle stuck his head out of the open kitchen and greeted them warmly,””Chinese friends, welcome!”

Liang Qichao introduced them with a smile.”Ruofei, Lin Qiao, this is Uncle Bill. He’s a full – time farmer on our farm, but he’s very good at cooking. I’ve specially asked him to help prepare lunch!”

Then, Liang Qichao said to bill in English,””Uncle Bill, they are Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao. Xia is one of the major shareholders of Paradise Farm, so it’s not appropriate for you to welcome him because he’s the owner of this place!”

“Oh!” Bill showed an exaggerated expression and said,”so it’s the boss! Liang, you should’ve told me earlier that it’s the boss who’s coming today. That way, I could’ve prepared more dishes!”

Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao were good at English, so they laughed when they heard that.

“Brother Liang, this foreigner is quite interesting!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Uncle Bill likes to joke, and he’s a very good person!” Liang Qichao said.

As it was already past lunchtime, everyone went straight to the table and sat down. Bill brought out the Australian – style food that he had prepared.

“Uncle Bill, sit down and eat with us!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Boss, I’ve already had lunch!” Bill smiled and said,”it’s an honor to serve you. Please try my cooking first!”

Bill had prepared several dishes today, all of which were very Australian. There was queenese meat pie, vanilla grilled fish steak, deep – Fried Crab Sticks, and so on. There was even roasted kangaroo meat. Although kangaroos were iconic animals in Australia, they were rampant. Every year, the government had to pay for a large number of them to be hunted, so they naturally became a delicacy on the table.

Liang Qichao opened a bottle of red wine and poured a little for everyone. Then, he smiled and greeted,””Come, come, come. Ruofei, Lin Qiao, you guys eat something first.”

Lin Qiao picked up a crab stick that was fried until it was golden yellow and put it in her mouth. After chewing for a few times, she revealed a surprised look and said,”Mm! This smell is so strange! It doesn’t smell like crab. ”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Actually, this crab meat stick isn’t made of crab meat at all. It’s made of white fish, boned, and made into the shape of crab legs. Then, it’s deep – fried. The last time I was here, I was tricked by brother Liang ...”

Liang Qichao couldn’t help but laugh.

Xia ruofei also picked up a piece of roasted kangaroo meat and put it in his mouth. He chewed it carefully and swallowed it. Then, he gave a thumbs up to bill, who was standing at the side, and said,”Uncle Bill, your cooking is quite authentic, and the taste is very good!”

Lin Qiao also nodded and said in English, “It’s very delicious! Thank you, Uncle Bill!”

Bill’s eyes narrowed into slits as he smiled.””Please enjoy your meal. There’s also a chicken and corn soup that will be ready soon!”

After that, he turned around and went to the kitchen.

Xia ruofei raised his glass and said,”come, let’s have a toast!” To our reunion!”

“Cheers!”

At noon, everyone mainly tasted good food. They only had a small sip of wine. From the beginning to the end, they only had one glass of wine, and each time, they only took a small sip.

In a short while, bill came back with a thick chicken and corn soup.

Everyone got a small bowl of it. The chicken and corn soup was very fragrant, including the other dishes. Although they were not as exquisite as the food in the big hotels, they were all full of authentic Australian flavor.

Lin Qiao ate with great relish, including the kangaroo meat. At first, she didn’t dare to eat it, but with Xia ruofei and Liang Qichao’s encouragement, she mustered up the courage to try a piece. Then, she couldn’t stop eating and ate several pieces in a row.

After the meal, Xia ruofei expressed his gratitude to bill, who had sacrificed his lunch break to prepare lunch for them. He even gave him an exquisite folding fan.

Bill couldn’t stop fondling this handcraft that was full of Chinese style. He opened and closed it repeatedly, and he was so happy that he couldn’t close his mouth like a child.

Bill expressed his gratitude to Xia ruofei for his gift and left the villa.

Meanwhile, Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao went back to their rooms to rest. After sitting on the plane for nine and a half hours and the car for three hours, Lin Qiao’s delicate body was already very tired. She seemed to be in good spirits now, entirely because of the excitement of coming to a foreign country for the first time.

The two guest rooms that Liang Qichao had prepared for them were on the third floor. The bedsheets, blankets, and pillows were all brand new. Each room had its own bathroom with brand new toiletries, towels, and bathrobes. They were well prepared.

Xia ruofei took a shower and went to bed to rest. He had used up all his energy three times in a row on the plane. It was a big drain on him and he soon fell into a sweet dream.

However, he only slept for an hour or so before Lin Qiao pulled him out of bed. The girl was still excited and woke up after a short nap. She came to look for Xia ruofei to go out to the Hunter Valley.

Xia ruofei drowsily looked at his phone. It was not even fouro’ clock in the afternoon. Then, he realized that he had forgotten to lock the door again. Fortunately, he was wearing a sleeping robe when he slept. Otherwise, he would have exposed himself in front of Lin Qiao again.

Xia ruofei felt a headache coming on when this girl did not even try to hide her gender in front of him.

However, he had always doted on Lin Qiao, so he couldn’t bear to scold her. He just smiled bitterly and asked her to go out and wait for him to change.

Xia ruofei changed into clean clothes and went downstairs with Lin Qiao.

Liang Qichao had already woken up. Xia ruofei saw that he was busy, so he didn’t ask him to accompany him. After getting the car keys from him, he drove the pickup truck and left the farm with Lin Qiao, heading to the small town outside.

“Brother ruofei, can you take me to a bar tonight?” Lin Qiao said,”I’ve never been to a bar before!”

“Not good.” Xia ruofei deliberately put on a straight face and said,”places like bars are mixed with all kinds of people. You’d better not go there alone!”

Lin Qiao wasn’t afraid at all. She smiled and said,”With an expert like brother RUO Fei here, what’s there to be afraid of? At most, I’ll promise you that without your company, I’ll never go to a place like a bar or a nightclub!”

“I’ll ask brother Liang later then. I’m not very familiar with this place ...”Xia ruofei said helplessly.

“En!” Lin Qiao counted on her fingers and said,”I’m going to take a hot air balloon ride. I heard that the hot air balloon sightseeing in the Hunter Valley is very interesting. Also, can we take a yacht to Sydney?”

“Alright, alright, alright! As long As You Like It, I’ll bring you to play with each and every one of them!” Xia ruofei said in a pampering tone.

“Yay! Long live brother RUO Fei!” Lin Qiao raised her arms and cheered.

At this moment, the car passed by the West Winery. Xia ruofei turned around and realized that the winery, which was closed at noon, was now open. He could even vaguely see Carter. It was West and Auntie kabeli.
