Hearing this, Xia ruofei could not help but smile with relief. This was the real gift he had given to Huanhuan. The limited edition Hello Kitty was just a facade for show.

Xia ruofei’s seemingly casual movements had actually repaired the pendant and improved the protective array.

Compared to when he had first made this pendant, whether it was his spiritual power cultivation or his understanding of array Dao, he was on a completely different level now. The defensive array he had set up now was naturally more perfect and powerful.

At the same time, with Xia ruofei’s current understanding of arrays, he easily set up a small spirit gathering array on the protective array, which could gather traces of wandering spiritual Qi. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

This was also the reason why Huanhuan felt very comfortable after wearing the pendant.

Even MA Xiong and the others who were standing beside Huan Huan felt very comfortable. They did not know why, but it was a subconscious feeling. However, they knew that it must have something to do with the pendant.

MA Xiong was the first to react. He said excitedly,”Xia Sheng, your gift is too precious! Huanhuan, why don’t you thank uncle Xia?”

Huan Huan felt a little strange. She had already thanked Xia ruofei just now! However, she still immediately said sweetly,””Thank you, uncle Xia!”

Xia ruofei looked at the adorable Huanhuan with a pampering smile and said,””No need to thank me! This is a small gift from uncle to Huanhuan. I hope that Huanhuan will become smarter in the future and do better in her studies!”

Huan Huan did not really understand. The pendant was still the same pendant. Xia ruofei had only touched it a few times. How did it become a new gift? However, she had always believed Xia ruofei’s words and nodded heavily.

“Uncle Xia, Huanhuan’s grades are very good. She’s always the top in her class!” She said.

Xia ruofei laughed and walked over to Pat Huanhuan’s head.”Then you should become smarter and get first place in the grade in the future! To become the smartest kid in Hong Kong!”

“En!” Huan Huan nodded and said.

Ma Zhiming and Tian Huixin quickly thanked Xia ruofei as well. At this moment, they felt that it was Huanhuan’s good fortune to have met a noble person like Xia ruofei in her previous life. They were very pleased.

Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand.”Mr. MA, aunt Huixin, you don’t have to be so polite. I’ve said it before. Huanhuan and I are fated. I like her from the bottom of my heart!”

“Xiasheng, I can tell that Huanhuan likes you a lot. Why don’t you just take her as your goddaughter?” MA Xiong said with a smile.

“I think we can!” Ma Zhiming and Tian Huixin also said in unison.

Xia ruofei hurriedly waved his hand and said,”no!” If Lu You finds out, she’ll definitely come after me!”

Lu You and Huanhuan were cousins. In fact, she had strongly objected to it before, and Huanhuan had also changed her way of addressing Xia ruofei to “brother ruofei”. However, this little girl still liked to call him “uncle Xia” at times, and Xia ruofei couldn’t be bothered to correct her.

In Xia ruofei’s eyes, seniority was nothing special. He could even accept the fact that Li Yifu, who was already in his 70s, called him senior granduncle.

However, if Huanhuan were to really acknowledge him as her Godfather, then the seniority would be a little messy. Did Lu You have to call him uncle when she saw him?

Moreover, he had been calling Tian Huilan aunt Tian and Tian Huixin aunt Huixin. Now that he had acknowledged Huanhuan as his goddaughter, didn’t that mean that he was of the same generation as Tian Huixin?

Tian Huixin was stunned for a moment, then she laughed. She had not thought of this.

After thinking for a while, Tian Huixin smiled and said,””RUO Fei, why don’t I ask you to take Huanhuan as your godsister? This way, there won’t be any doubts about seniority. ”

This time, MA Xiong and Ma Zhiming didn’t know what to say.

All this while, Xia ruofei had been addressing the father and son as “old Mr. MA” and “Mr. MA.” Although he called Tian Huixin “aunt Huixin,” this was based on Tian Huilan’s perspective and had no relationship with the father and son in terms of seniority.

If Huanhuan became Xia ruofei’s godsister, then theoretically, MA Xiong and Ma Zhiming would be Xia ruofei’s elders. Although they would not be promoted to Godfather or godgrandfather, their seniority would still be established.

They didn’t know what Xia ruofei was thinking, so they didn’t say anything.

In fact, Xia ruofei did not have such complicated thoughts. In fact, he respected MA Xiong a lot. After all, he was his grandfather and MA Xiong was good to him from the bottom of his heart. He was definitely a loyal elder.

Xia ruofei didn’t hesitate and said,””Sure! As long as Huanhuan is willing, I have no problem with it!”

“Huanhuan will definitely be willing!” Tian Huixin quickly said.

Then, she immediately reacted and turned to look at Huanhuan, asking,””Huanhuan, are you willing to let brother RUO Fei be your brother?”

This question was a little confusing. At Huanhuan’s age, she was naturally confused by the question.

“Isn’t brother RUO Fei my brother?”she asked, looking confused. Also, I prefer to call him uncle Xia ...”

When Huanhuan first took the medicine concocted by Xia ruofei and gradually walked out of her lonely inner world, she had been calling Xia ruofei “uncle Xia”. Hence, she was a little obsessed with this form of address.

Although she had changed how she addressed him for a period of time due to Lu You’s protest, she still preferred to call him ‘uncle Xia’ in her heart.
