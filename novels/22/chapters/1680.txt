Chapter 1681: Unexpected fan – in – arms (1)

Xia ruofei kept his phone and went to open the door.

Alex was standing at the door with a smile on his face, and there was a middle – aged white man in a suit next to him. This middle – aged white man was a little balding, and the last bit of hair he had was neatly combed. There was not a single wrinkle on his suit, and his leather shoes were even more shiny. He was a very serious person.

“Mr. Xia, this is our qiuhang’s senior vice president, Mr. Tony!” Alex introduced with a smile.

“Oh! Hello there!” Xia ruofei nodded and said,”please come in!”

Xia ruofei let the two of them into the house and said,””Please take a seat, I’ll go change my clothes!”

Xia ruofei was wearing the bathrobe provided by the hotel after his shower. It was obviously not suitable for him to receive guests in this outfit.

Tony smiled,”Mr. Xia, it’s fine!” It’s just a visit between friends. ”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and nodded with a smile,””Alright then! Let’s sit here!”

The Australian Airlines had booked a suite for Xia ruofei with a special living room.

There was even a Chinese tea set on the coffee table in the living room. It could be seen that even though the incident happened rather suddenly, Alex’s arrangements were very detailed. At the same time, it naturally showed how much Australian Airlines valued Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei invited the two of them to take a seat. Then, he took out a box of tea leaves from his backpack on the sofa. As he skillfully boiled water and prepared the tea set, he smiled and said,””Please have a taste of our Chinese tea!”

Tony’s eyes widened exaggeratedly and he said with a smile,””That’s great! There are a lot of Chinese tea leaves sold in Australia, but I think Mr. Xia’s tea is the most authentic! Because it comes from the hometown of tea leaves!”

Xia ruofei scooped out some Da Hong Pao from the box and put it into the tea set. He smiled and said,””In China, this tea is called Da Hong Pao. There’s a beautiful story behind it!”

“Oh? I wonder if we have the honor of hearing this story?” Tony asked.

“Of course!” Xia ruofei said.

The quick – Heating kettle didn’t have a large capacity, so the water boiled quickly. Xia ruofei made the tea skillfully while telling Tony and Alex about the legend of Da Hong Pao in fluent English.

He was naturally talking about the most widely spread story of the student who was rushing to take the exam.

As Xia ruofei explained, the tea was ready. The unique fragrance of Da Hong Pao’s tea filled the room. Even Tony and Alex, who didn’t usually drink tea, couldn’t help but sniff.

Soon, the tea from the mysterious East gained two more loyal fans. Both Tony and Alex were full of praise for the peach garden’s Da Hong Pao. They also expressed that they had fallen in love with this magical drink and were determined to buy some for long – term consumption when they returned.

As for the taste of the tea leaves they bought from the Chinese shops or supermarkets, Xia ruofei could not care less.

After all, they couldn’t keep exchanging small talk, and Tony quickly cut to the point.

“Mr. Xia, Mr. Tony came here immediately with his team by the company’s public jet after he learned that the plane had decided to land in Saipan. He came to visit you as soon as he got off the plane!” Alex said from the side,”Mr. Tony said that he must express the sincere gratitude of the Australian Airlines to you in person as soon as possible!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you’re too kind, Mr. Tony!” “Your company’s flight crew has contributed greatly to this incident. Without the cooperation of the flight crew and the full technical guidance of Captain Brook, I would not have been able to complete this forced surrender.”

Tony gave Xia ruofei a thumbs up and said,””Mr. Xia, the flight crew will naturally receive the rewards they deserve, including Captain Johansson who died in the line of duty. However, as an experienced airline pilot, I deeply admire Mr. Xia’s heroic feat!”

Xia ruofei laughed and poured Tony a cup of tea. He didn’t know how to respond to the compliment. It wasn’t good to be too humble. After all, the truth was there!

From an economic point of view, the Airbus A350 had cost more than 400 million US dollars to build. There were also hundreds of passengers on board. If the plane were to fall into the sea, the economic losses would be immense. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Of course, the more important thing was still the issue of reputation. A fatal air crash was a huge blow to an airline’s reputation, not to mention that it was their own pilot who had committed suicide.

If Wilkinson really succeeded in carrying out this crazy plan, it was conceivable that qplease would be drowned in spittle, and the stock price would definitely plummet.

“Mr. Xia,” Tony continued,”I’m here to express my sincere gratitude and respect to you on behalf of qstay and myself. I also want to discuss the next arrangements with you.”

Xia ruofei sat up straight and nodded.””I’d like to hear the details. ”

Tony said,”this afternoon, the investigation team for this special case has been officially set up. We, as well as the Civil Aviation Safety investigation departments of Australia, the United States, and China, have sent representatives to participate. All the personnel will be in place by tomorrow morning at the latest. We may need to find Mr. Xia to understand more about the situation.”

Although Xia ruofei had already described the incident to the police in Saipan in detail, the investigation team would still need to find him to understand the situation. After all, they would look at it from a more professional point of view and focus on different things than the police.
