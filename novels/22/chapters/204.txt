Chapter 205: The beautiful agent (1)

On the seventh day of the first month, all units returned to work as usual. The employees of Taoyuan farm also came early in the morning. As the boss, Xia ruofei had also woken up early in the morning. He was at the entrance of the farm, giving red packets to his employees. This was a custom in the southeast province. On the first day of work of the new year, red packets had to be given out. This was commonly known as a “good start.” It wasn’t a lot of money, just 300 yuan per red packet. It was mainly to get some good luck. The farmworkers were all grinning. They had only been employed for a month, and their salaries were high. Many of them had received three red packets for the end of the year, a red packet for working overtime on the fourth day of the new year, and a red packet for opening the door today. In addition to the monthly salary of 5000 Yuan, most people’s monthly income was even higher than that of the White – collar workers in the city. Therefore, everyone was full of energy, and their sense of belonging to the farm was stronger. Cao tieshu immediately called everyone to work in the large shed. After transplanting the vegetables on the fourth day of the new year, only the people on duty every day would take care of the new vegetables. There was still a lot of work waiting for them to complete. Fatty pang Hao had also officially started working at the farm. This made Xia ruofei realize that it was urgent to build another building on the farm. Now, pang Hao’s temporary office was also set up in a guest room on the first floor of the villa. Ye Lingyun was also staying in the villa. This was definitely not a long – term plan. Xia ruofei decided to look for Liang Qichao in the next two days. He had completed the farm project beautifully. Now that they were going to build a new building, he would naturally look for him. However, before that, Xia ruofei had one more thing to do. After the Kongtong Festival, all units would resume work. The deal for this villa had been discussed previously, and he would be going to settle the transfer of ownership today. Xia ruofei drove around the farm. Seeing that it was about time, he left the farm in his Knight XV and headed straight for the San Shan city. The agent of the villa owner had contacted Xia ruofei yesterday. They had agreed to meet at 10 am. Xia ruofei drove to the bus stop near the real estate trading center. His classmate, Guan Ping, had already left the company with the excuse of going to the real estate trading Center for Business. When Xia ruofei drove to the bus stop, he saw that Guan Ping was already waiting at the platform. The Knight XV’s appearance was too majestic. As the car slowly pulled to the side, the people waiting for the car could not help but look over, including Guan Ping. However, he did not expect it to be Xia ruofei’s pickup truck. Xia ruofei had driven it to the last class reunion! Knight XV stopped beside Guan Ping. Xia ruofei rolled down the window on the passenger’s side and waved at him with a smile. Guan Ping’s eyes widened ... “Get in the car! What are you doing? We’re going to be photographed in a while!” Xia ruofei smiled. “Oh, oh!” Only then did Guan Ping come back to his senses. He quickly opened the door and climbed into the car. The chassis of the car was very high, and the action of getting on was similar to getting on a big truck. He had to hold the handrail with one hand, then step on the pedal with one foot and “climb” up the car. As soon as Guan Ping got on the car, he shouted,”F * ck!” RUO Fei, you’ve changed your weapon! No, no, this is a small slingshot that has been replaced with a cruise missile ... This car is too awesome!” “It’s alright!”Xia ruofei smiled. “Still okay? This is simply too good!” Guan Ping said exaggeratedly,”I think I’ve seen this car on the internet once. It cost more than ten million Yuan ...” “Almost!” Xia ruofei said with a smile. “Don’t tell me you went to rob a bank!” Guan Ping was shocked,”he was driving a pickup truck not long ago! It’s only been a few days and you’re already driving a luxury car worth tens of millions?” “It’s a long story, but I’m not as rich as you think. ” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”my entire net worth is not even as valuable as this car! I’ll tell you more when I have time ...” Xia ruofei chatted with Guan Ping as he drove. They soon arrived at the agreed place, a café called left bank. There were still more than ten minutes before the meeting time. Xia ruofei and Guanping found a place to sit down. After a while, Xia ruofei’s phone rang. He saw a young woman walking into the coffee shop with a folder in her hand. She held the phone to her ear as she walked. Xia ruofei stood up and waved at the woman with his phone in hand. The woman hung up the phone immediately and walked towards Xia ruofei with a smile. “Hello! You must be Mr. Xia?” The young woman took the initiative to reach out her hand to Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei shook her hand and smiled.”Hello, I’m Xia ruofei.” “We spoke on the phone yesterday, I’m Zhao Xueqing.” The young woman smiled and said,”I didn’t expect Mr. Xia to be so young.” “I didn’t expect sister Zhao to be so charming either!” Xia ruofei smiled. “Mr. Xia, you’ve got a way with words!” Zhao Xueqing grinned. “I’m just telling the truth ...” Xia ruofei said.”Oh, sister Zhao, this is my classmate, Guan Ping. He’s more familiar with the process of real estate transactions, so I’m going to ask him for help with the transfer of ownership.” “Nice to meet you, Mr. Guan!” When Guan Ping saw Zhao Xueqing, his face revealed a look of surprise, and he was slightly dazed. It was only when Zhao Xueqing took the initiative to greet him that he came back to his senses. He quickly said,”Hello, Sister Zhao!” Both parties sat down, each ordered a drink, and went straight to the point. “Sister Zhao, we’ve reached an agreement on the transaction price, so all that’s left is for both parties to draft up the contract and handle the transfer.” Xia ruofei said with a smile. “That’s right, I’m actually brother Wu’s runner. “Zhao Xueqing chuckled. By the way, I’ve brought the real estate certificate, Land certificate, and power of attorney. Take a look. ” Xia ruofei gestured to Guan Ping. Guan Ping took the relevant documents and looked through them carefully. He nodded to Xia ruofei and said,””No problem. With these, I can successfully complete the transfer.” With that, Guan Ping took out his laptop from his bag and turned it on. He turned to Zhao Xueqing and said,”Sister Zhao, I’ll add the relevant data and transaction price to the contract, and then you can see if there are any problems.” “Alright! But I don’t understand it either, just send me a copy, I’ll send it to brother Wu to see for himself!” Zhao Xueqing smiled and said,”as long as there’s no problem on his side, it’s fine!” “Alright!” Guan Ping opened up a standard contract that he had already modified in advance, and filled in the relevant information according to the property certificate, Land certificate, and power of attorney. Very quickly, the contract was complete. There was free WiFi in the café. Zhao Xueqing gave Guan Ping An email address, and Guan Ping immediately sent her the contract through email. Just as Guan Ping sent the message, Zhao Xueqing received a notification on her phone. She swiped on her phone and fiddled with it a few times. Then, she looked up and said with a smile,””I’ve already forwarded it to brother Wu. Let’s just wait for his reply!” “Alright! I’ve troubled sister Zhao today. ” Xia ruofei said with a smile. “You’re welcome, I’m also entrusted with this task!” Zhao Xueqing smiled as she stood up and said,”I still have some matters to attend to at the company, so I’ll take my leave first!” “Alright,” he said. Xia ruofei said,”Oh right, sister Zhao, exchange contact information with Guanping! When the time comes, I’ll get him to contact you directly. ” “No problem!” Zhao Xueqing took out her name card and passed it to Guan Ping. As a real estate agent, Guan Ping naturally had his own name card. He quickly took out one and passed it to Zhao Xueqing along with the real estate information. It was obvious that Guan Ping was a little reserved in front of Zhao Xueqing. After Zhao Xueqing left, Xia ruofei and Guan Ping sat down again. Xia ruofei said,”pingzi, I’ll leave the transfer of ownership to you!” Just call me when you need me to sign and pay. As for the other things, you can just follow sister Zhao ...” When Xia ruofei said this, he realized that Guan Ping was a little absent – minded and his eyes were a little straight. He couldn’t help but call out,””Ping Zi! Ping Zi ...” “Ah?” Guan Ping seemed to wake up from a dream.”What’s wrong, ruofei?” “What are you so focused on?” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’ve been talking to you for so long and you didn’t hear a single word?” Xia ruofei followed Guan Ping’s gaze and saw Zhao Xueqing’s figure disappear at the corner of the street. Xia ruofei turned around and looked at Guan Ping, who was looking a little uncomfortable. He smiled knowingly ... [PS] the battle of double monthly votes has begun, so one vote counts as two votes!
