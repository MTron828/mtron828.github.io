Chapter 1787: Can’t control my emotions (1)

Similarly, Song Wei’s sea of consciousness was also changing.

When Song Wei’s spiritual power broke through, the golden light of her spiritual power in her sea of consciousness also became thicker, and the pressure on her to fight with the peach blossom miasma was also relieved.

Song Wei was not the only one who benefited. Xia ruofei’s spiritual power was also recovering rapidly and slowly growing.

Perhaps it was because the outside world and the sea of consciousness were cultivating at the same time. Although Xia ruofei’s mind was not very clear now, his spiritual power gathered on its own and once again attacked Song Wei’s sea of consciousness. Together with Song Wei’s spiritual power, they started to strangle the peach blossom miasma.

On the island in the core of the sea of consciousness, the two spirits were still intertwined, carrying out the most primitive and instinctive movement.

The moment the spiritual bodies started to circulate the “absolute beginning Scripture”, the pink mist that was surrounding the two spiritual bodies started to melt like snow under the sun. In just a short while, they were all gone.

However, the intimate contact on the soul level made them unable to resist the thrill. Even without the help of the peach blossom miasma, the two spirits were still fighting on the island by instinct ...

As time passed, Song Wei and Xia ruofei’s spiritual power continued to grow. Xia ruofei subconsciously directed more and more of his spiritual power into the battlefield in his consciousness.

In the ocean of chaotic air currents, the situation of the battle had also begun to reverse.

As Xia ruofei and Song Wei’s powers continued to grow, the battle in the sea of consciousness was also difficult to determine. The peach blossom miasma no longer had the advantage it had at the beginning. The pink threads were constantly being strangled by Xia ruofei and Song Wei.

Of course, the two of them were completely immersed in the pleasure of their souls. They had no idea what was happening in Song Wei’s sea of consciousness. Their spiritual power was only instinctively trying to destroy the invader in her sea of consciousness.

After an unknown amount of time, the two of them gradually regained consciousness.

The experience just now could be said to be the happiest moment of their lives, as if they were floating in the clouds.

Song Wei had never had a boyfriend before and did not know what it felt like to have sex. However, Xia ruofei was no longer a Virgin. He could clearly feel that the experience just now was many times more pleasurable than when he was with Ling Qingxue.

This was not because Xia ruofei was a Playboy or anything. It was because of the intimate contact on the spiritual level. Physical contact was on a completely different level.

The two Spirit bodies were reluctant to part, and their expressions were very complicated and awkward.

The spiritual body formed by Xia ruofei’s spiritual power quickly turned into a Golden Ray but it was much thicker than before. Song Wei’s spiritual body remained in the same form and this made her even more embarrassed.

Xia ruofei scanned the island with his spiritual power. The first thing he noticed was the black stone tablet. There was a slightly thick golden line and two thin golden lines.

After some thought, Xia ruofei knew that this meant that Song Wei’s spiritual power had reached the middle stage of the spirit throb realm.

From the looks of it, only when one had reached the spiritual movement stage and broken through to the spirit throb stage would the three golden threads combine into a slightly thicker golden thread.

Now, it was a thick line and two thin lines. It was obvious that Song Wei had not only broken through the realm of her spiritual power in the strange experience just now, but she had also advanced two levels and reached the middle stage of the spirit throb realm!

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be dumbfounded. Even the “great Dao Arts” didn’t have such an effect! This was too heaven – defying.

Although he had been lost in the extreme pleasure of the soul, he still had an impression of the whole process. He knew that the reason why he could achieve such an effect was because his physical body and spirit body were cultivating the “absolute beginning Heart Sutra” at the same time.

It seemed like the “absolute beginning Heart Sutra” was not as simple as it seemed on the surface! Xia ruofei said to himself.

He didn’t spend too much energy to think about this problem, because he was more concerned about the peach blossom miasma in his sea of consciousness.

After sensing it, Xia ruofei was surprised to find that there was no longer any peach blossom miasma in Song Wei’s sea of consciousness. In the continuous battle, the peach blossom miasma was finally completely wiped out.

In fact, it was an unfair battle. As the defender, peach blossom miasma’s strength was constantly decreasing as it was constantly strangled. As for Xia ruofei and Song Wei, who were the attackers, they had accidentally entered the “advanced mode” of the “absolute beginning Heart Sutra” cultivation. Their spiritual power had increased rapidly, and the number of troops they had invested had increased instead of decreasing.

One side was constantly losing members, while the other side was constantly increasing their numbers. Moreover, the reinforcements they sent were stronger than the previous one. How could there be any suspense in the outcome of the battle? Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Since the miasma had been completely destroyed, Xia ruofei did not dare to stay in Song Wei’s sea of consciousness for too long. She was sitting there naked! Although it was just a spiritual body, Xia ruofei felt very uncomfortable, especially when their spiritual bodies had a passionate collision just now ...

Hence, Xia ruofei quickly retracted his spiritual energy.

In the outside world, the two of them naturally stopped cultivating.

Xia ruofei tried to sense it and was so surprised that his mouth was wide open. He realized that he had broken through to Qi disciple Level 6. What made him even more shocked was that his spiritual power had also increased by a large margin and reached the late stage of spirit evolution realm. In terms of true energy cultivation, he was already at Qi disciple level 9.
