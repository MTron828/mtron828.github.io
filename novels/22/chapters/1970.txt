1971 A gathering of heroes (2)

Bastian quickly came forward and said,”Hello, President Xia! I’m very honored that you still remember my name!”

“You’re here to attend the auction, right?” Xia ruofei asked.

“Of course! The peach blossom company’s auction is a grand event in the food industry. We definitely don’t want to miss it!” Bastian said,”I’m here to represent corner restaurant’s France headquarters to attend the auction. I hope to get one or two pieces of high – Quality truffles!”

In fact, Bastian had been working in the purchasing department of the France headquarters before he was sent to China as a Branch Manager. However, his position was not particularly high. He had also attended the last Hong Kong auction, and he had come with the purchasing manager. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

That time, he had met Xia ruofei at the Western restaurant around the corner. After hearing that the Paradise Corporation was going to auction off another batch of truffles, Bastian tried to report to the company headquarters about his interaction with Xia ruofei.

He didn’t expect the France headquarters to take it so seriously.

After some discussion, the purchasing department decided to let Bastian represent the Western restaurant chain in Hong Kong to participate in the auction.

To put it bluntly, even though corner restaurant had many chain restaurants, they were still not as powerful as Michelin – starred restaurants and global food and beverage groups.

He had been lucky enough to get a truffle at the last auction in Hong Kong.

The publicity for this auction was even more intense, and the items up for auction were also more abundant. As a result, it attracted more big shots in the food and beverage industry and world – Class rich people to attend.

The France headquarters of corner Western restaurant chain evaluated that the chances of making a profit at this auction were not high. In addition, the purchasing manager happened to have to fly to the United States to negotiate a purchase contract, so there was a conflict of time.

Therefore, the headquarters decided to give it a try. They simply let Bastian represent the Western restaurant chain around corner to participate in this auction. It would be a pity not to participate in the auction for a provincial capital in the food and beverage industry like Yingying, and it was very likely that he would get nothing if he participated. Thus, Bastian got this opportunity.

Bastian was also very decisive and directly brought Cheng Xiaoxiao along.

The reason why he brought Cheng Xiaoxiao along was naturally to build a relationship with Xia ruofei. Cheng Xiaoxiao was Xia ruofei’s super fan, so she could invisibly pull the relationship between the two sides closer.

Bastian knew that this opportunity was very important to him. If he could achieve something at this auction, his future in the company would be broad. He estimated that he would be promoted and transferred back to the headquarters after staying in China for a year or two.

Although the food in China made him want to go back, and the life in China was very pleasant, he still missed the days in France. He always wanted to go back as soon as possible.

“Then I wish you all good luck!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Seeing that Xia ruofei was about to end the conversation, Bastian mustered up his courage and asked,””President Xia, may I ask ... Do you have more truffles? Can you sell a portion of it to our Western restaurant chain after the auction?”

Bastian’s words were actually a little presumptuous.

However, he knew that if he missed this opportunity, he might not have another chance to talk to Xia ruofei until the auction ended. So, he gritted his teeth and asked.

Xia ruofei had already decided to sell the rest of the truffles to the black family. Just as he was about to decline, he saw Cheng Xiaoxiao looking at him with anticipation. He couldn’t help but soften a little.

Before they left, Bastian had told Cheng Xiaoxiao that if she could help him get closer to Xia ruofei and gain something from this auction, he would be able to get a promotion and a raise when he returned.

Even though Cheng Xiaoxiao really wanted a promotion and a raise, she didn’t ask Xia ruofei for help.

In her eyes, Xia ruofei was the perfect idol. If her idol was not willing, she would not ask for help.

Xia ruofei said to himself,”forget it, I’ll give the fans face!” It doesn’t matter who I sell it to, and I didn’t promise old Blake that I’d empty the inventory for them ...

He did not sign a written agreement with old Blake. The verbal agreement was no less than 50 kilograms. The truffles that Xia ruofei had left behind added up to at least 70 to 80 kilograms. It would not affect him if he sold a portion of them to the Western restaurant.

Thinking of this, Xia ruofei said indifferently,””Mr. Bastian, you should focus on the auction first! Who knows, we might even be able to bid for the truffles that you guys like!”

Xia ruofei was being tactful. Actually, Bastian liked all the truffles that were put up for auction. Wasn’t the key still money? The corner Western restaurant chain’s financial strength was incomparable to those big corporations and rich people. In an environment like an auction, the more money one had, the more boastful one’s voice would be. At most, they would only be picking up scraps, and there was a lot of uncertainty.

Just as Bastian was feeling very disappointed, Xia ruofei changed the topic.””If you really can’t get anything from the auction, I can consider selling you some truffles!”

Bastian had a feeling that there was a ray of hope at the end of the tunnel, and he said delightedly, “That’s great! President Xia! Thank you! Thank you very much!”

Xia ruofei said,”you’re welcome. Xiaoxiao is my fan. I’ll still give her face.” However, don’t get your hopes up. The remaining truffles are of high quality, but there isn’t much left. ”

“That’s good!” Bastian quickly said,”thank you, President Xia!”

On the side, Cheng Xiaoxiao was so happy that her eyes were filled with tears. Where could she find an idol who was so considerate of his fans?

“Thank you, director Xia!” Cheng Xiaoxiao said, choking with emotion.

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”I don’t think so.” You guys go in quickly! Remember to return the auction deposit to the staff to exchange for a pass!”

After Cheng Xiaoxiao and Bastian walked into the venue, someone immediately came over to greet her. In fact, the other party had already arrived, but Xia ruofei had been talking to Bastian and Cheng Xiaoxiao, so he had been waiting at the side.

After Bastian and Cheng Xiaoxiao left, the big – nosed, yellow – haired Westerner came forward and said in English,””Hello, Mr. Xia! I’m James, the president of the Huaxia region of the United States ‘shengbang Corporation! Mr. Tang He, the chairman of our group, asked me to say hello to you on his behalf!”

“So it’s Mr. James, nice to meet you!” Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”how’s Mr. Tang?”

“The chairman is very good, but he just happened to have an important business discussion that conflicted with the time of the auction, so he sent me to represent him!” James said,”for this, the chairman also specially asked me to express my apologies to you!”

“No need, no need! You’re already giving me face by sending people here!” Xia ruofei said,”Mr. James, please send my regards to Mr. Tang!”

“Alright, I’ll definitely pass on the message!” James said,”director Xia, I’ll go in first then. I won’t disturb you!”

“Alright, I wish you good luck at the auction!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Thank you for your well wishes, President Xia!” James said politely and nodded at MA Xiong, who was standing beside Xia ruofei. Then, he walked into conference hall No. 1.

“You’re really popular, ruofei!”MA Xiong laughed. President Tang of shengbang Corporation actually values you so much!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Mr. Tang and I are considered friends despite our age!” We also have a farm project in Australia. ”

“I’ve heard of it. It’s Paradise Farm!” MA Xiong said,”it’s said that the farm’s development momentum is very good. It was originally just a casual investment by Mr. Tang, but I didn’t expect it to succeed so quickly! This is all because of your great ability!”

“Grandpa MA, don’t flatter me to the point of killing me. What kind of ability do I have?” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”the specific things are done by the people under me. Actually, I’m the most relaxed one in the company!”

While the two of them were chatting in a low voice, another person came down to the entrance of conference hall No. 1, surrounded by his entourage.
