2510 The mysterious power of the East (1)

“Wu! How can you get out of bed and move around?” The team doctor asked sternly,”Dr. Havimir told you that you have to stay in bed for 20 days after the operation. How could you not follow his advice? What if the shoulder joint is dislocated?”

From the team doctor’s point of view, Wu Lei’s actions were very irresponsible.

After Wu Lei heard the translation, he quickly said,””Dr. Diego, I’m here for a physical examination!” He said.

“A physical examination?” The team doctor, Diego, asked in confusion.

“Yes, I feel that my body is recovering very well, and it doesn’t affect my ability to get out of bed. I can even feel no pain in my shoulder.” Wu Lei said,”that’s why I wanted to come back to check on my recovery.”

“This is impossible!” The team doctor, Diego, shouted,”it’s only been five or six days. The wound hasn’t even completely healed yet. How could you not feel any pain?”

Diego looked at Wu Lei and said,”Wu, I understand your eagerness to serve the club. However, the recovery of sports injuries requires science!” Your surgery was very successful, and Dr. Havimir also said that you’ll be able to resume ball training in six or seven weeks. Although the season will be over by then, you’ll have a full pre – season training, which will be of great help to your performance next season. If you’re in such a hurry now, it might affect the recovery of your injuries instead, and it won’t be worth it. ”

Diego also knew that the player in front of him had been personally brought in by the Chinese boss, and that it was of great significance to the club’s expansion into the Chinese market. Therefore, he did not say anything too harsh. Instead, he spoke with a heavy heart. It was precisely because he knew how important Wu Lei was that he would never agree to such an unreasonable request.

Wu Lei looked at the translator helplessly and said,””Please tell Dr. Diego that since I’m already here, please ask him to check on me. If my recovery is still far from complete, I’ll definitely cooperate with the recovery plan. Also ... Tell him that I’m going back to the club for a check today with President Xia’s permission. ”

“Alright!” The translator nodded and translated Wu Lei’s words for Diego.

After listening to the translator’s words, the team doctor nodded reluctantly and said,””Alright then! Since it’s Mr. Xia’s order, I’ll check it for you! However, I hope that after the examination, you can recuperate well according to the doctor’s advice. Otherwise, I will suggest that the club arrange for you to live in the youth team dormitory and send someone to supervise you. ”

“No problem!” Wu Lei replied with a smile. No problem!”

Diego brought Wu Lei to the club’s medical room and carefully examined Wu Lei’s shoulder.

The results of the examination made Diego gasp. Wu Lei’s recovery speed was completely beyond his imagination. The surgical wound had completely healed, leaving only a faint scar. The preliminary examination showed that the scapular joint and ligament had basically returned to normal.

This result made Diego doubt his life. Was all the sports Medicine he had studied for so many years fake?

Diego looked as if he had seen a ghost. He checked again, and the results were the same. If it was a joint and ligament examination, it could be due to a problem with the equipment. However, the wound left by the operation had completely healed. This could be seen clearly with the naked eye without the need for a professional. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

However, Diego still could not believe the result. He felt that the conditions in the club’s medical room were limited, after all. So, after applying with the club manager, he took Wu Lei to a local hospital in Barcelona for a more comprehensive examination.

Diego felt that this result was too subverted, so he did not dare to tell the club manager. He only said that he would take Wu Lei to the hospital for a follow – up to check on his recovery. The club manager didn’t think much about it and readily agreed.

After an in – depth examination such as an MRI scan, Diego finally got the results after a long time.

Diego had finally given up and accepted the fact that Wu Lei was infinitely close to a full recovery.

Diego became even more excited. He grabbed the translator and said anxiously,”Please immediately ask Wu how he did it. Could it be that the Constitution of the Easterners is different from ours?”

The interpreter was also a Spaniard, but he had studied in China for many years and was very good at Chinese. It just so happened that the Spanish team had brought in Wu Lei, so he got this well – paid job. In addition to being Wu Lei’s translator, he was also responsible for teaching Wu Lei Spanish.

Translation was only a short – term job. It was impossible for the club to assign a translator to a player for a long time. Even the boss’s fellow – townsman could not have such treatment.

More importantly, Wu Lei had to pass the language barrier on his own in order to better integrate into the team. After all, it was impossible to rely on a translator to convey everything. In that case, there would be obstacles in communication with his teammates. Moreover, the locker room was a very private place. Unless the head coach arranged tactics, the players were definitely not allowed to bring a translator in. It was up to Wu Lei to deal with the relationship in the locker room.

The interpreter was well – versed in Huaxia. After hearing what Dr. Diego said, he said with a confused look, “I’ve lived in Huaxia for five years, but I don’t feel anything special about the physique of the Easterners!”
