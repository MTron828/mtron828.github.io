Chapter 959: Jennifer’s advice (1)

Translator: 549690339

After the spiritual Qi of heaven and earth and the moonlight entered his meridians through his aperture acupoints, they were slowly transformed into pure true Qi under the operation of his mental cultivation method.

Xia ruofei was fully focused on his cultivation and time passed by slowly.

Unknowingly, Xia ruofei felt the spiritual Qi of heaven and earth suddenly become less and more chaotic. He stopped his cultivation and opened his eyes. He raised his hand to look at his watch. It was already one in the morning. Midnight had passed. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

This was Xia ruofei’s first time cultivating in the outside world. Overall, he felt slightly better than he had expected and his cultivation had improved.

Compared to absorbing the innate pure Yang Qi in the spirit map space, this improvement was almost negligible, and the difference in the energy absorbed was like that of a large river and a small stream in the mountains. However, it was still effective.

As long as he could cultivate in the outside world and his cultivation would not stagnate, Xia ruofei would be satisfied.

Of course, he was mainly concerned about Tang Haoran.

After all, he could still occasionally enjoy a “feast” in the spirit map space, but Tang Haoran could only work hard in such a harsh cultivation environment.

Xia ruofei also decided to speed up the cultivation of his spiritual power and genuine Qi. He wanted to carve the spirit – gathering Talisman As Soon As Possible so that he and his disciple would have more resources for cultivation.

After taking a shower in the bathroom, Xia ruofei went to bed to rest.

At five in the morning, Xia ruofei opened his eyes on time.

The hour of the dawn was the time when the red sun rose, and it was also the most suitable time of the day for cultivation.

He got up and sat up. He first released his spiritual power, and soon, he sensed a familiar aura. He could not help but smile in relief.

It was Tang Haoran, who was resting in the master bedroom next door. Xia ruofei noticed that Tang Haoran had woken up early and was already practicing the “fierce yang Scripture”.

Xia ruofei sensed for a while and found that Tang Haoran’s breathing was very stable. He was relieved and started to cultivate on his bed.

It was not until Seveno’ clock in the morning when Xia ruofei finally stopped. He stood up, washed his face, and walked out of the cabin.

During breakfast, Xia ruofei was inevitably ridiculed by Lin Qiao again because she had woken up early to enjoy the magnificent sunrise on the sea.

However, Xia ruofei had already planned to cultivate at dawn, so he told Lin Qiao last night that he was going to sleep in and didn’t want to see sunrise. That was why Lin Qiao didn’t come to disturb Xia ruofei in the morning.

After breakfast, Xia ruofei said to Tang Haoran,””Haoran, come with me for a moment.”

“Yes, master!” Tang Haoran immediately stood up.

The master and disciple went straight back to the cabin that Xia ruofei had stayed in yesterday.

Tang Yitian, Jennifer, and even Lin Qiao all knew that Xia ruofei was teaching Tang Haoran the cultivation method. Although they still couldn’t understand the magic of the cultivation method, the scene of Tang Haoran being unable to control his strength yesterday and directly breaking the metal soft tube of the shower head was enough to shock them.

Hence, when Xia ruofei asked Tang Haoran to leave alone, they were not dissatisfied with Qianqian’s magical technique. Tang Haoran was already very lucky to have learned it in his previous life. Of course, Xia ruofei would avoid them.

In fact, Xia ruofei’s thoughts were not that complicated. It was just that Tang Yitian and the others, including Lin Qiao, were not cultivators. It was better for them to know less about cultivation. Besides, Xia ruofei was a person who liked to keep a low profile. He was not used to teaching his disciples in front of others.

After returning to the cabin, Xia ruofei smiled and asked,””Haoran, how did you feel about your cultivation today?”

“Master! The effect seems to be very average!” Tang Haoran said with a bitter face.

Xia ruofei laughed and scolded him,”you little brat, do you think that every time you cultivate, it’ll be like the first time you absorb the innate pure Yang Qi?” Today’s state is the normal state of cultivation. The path of cultivation is not that easy to walk in the first place, so I ask you to persevere every day, and you must not slack off!”

“Yes!” Tang Haoran said sensibly. I know, master!”

Xia ruofei beckoned for Tang Haoran to come over and check on his cultivation.

After using his spiritual power to investigate, Xia ruofei discovered that the true Qi in Tang Haoran’s body was very pure. It did not become impure because of the individual cultivation this morning. In fact, there was some improvement compared to yesterday. He could not help but nod in satisfaction.

Although the “scorching sun Scripture” was not as good as the “great Dao chant”, it was also a superior cultivation technique. As long as Tang Haoran cultivated it steadily, the possibility of something going wrong was still very low.

From the results of the first day of cultivation, Xia ruofei was quite satisfied.

“Haoran, you’ve done well in today’s cultivation,” Xia ruofei said,”you’re still young, so you can’t rush your cultivation. You have to lay a solid foundation and sharpen your knife so that it won’t delay your work. Do you understand?”

Xia ruofei would be leaving Australia in a few days, so whenever he had the chance, he would give Tang Haoran a few words of advice, whether it was the principles of cultivation or life. After all, Tang Haoran was still too young. He was at the age where he should establish his own outlook on life and values. Xia ruofei did not want Tang Haoran to have any deviation in his growth path.

This was the first disciple he had ever taken in, and the first disciple he had ever taken in so far.

“I’ll remember it, master!”Tang Haoran immediately said. Don’t be impatient, you have to lay a good foundation!”
