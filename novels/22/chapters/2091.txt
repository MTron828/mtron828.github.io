“That’s great!” Xia Qing said happily,”I also hope that master can refine a few helpers for me as soon as possible!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I want to!” Wasn’t this because his cultivation wasn’t high enough? Xia Qing, with your understanding, what level of cultivation do I need to reach to be able to refine a soul puppet?”

“The refining method you got is for making elementary spiritual puppets,” said Xia Qing. “According to your current cultivation, you’ll need to advance at least two to three levels before you can successfully refine them. However, your spiritual power cultivation is much higher than your genuine Qi cultivation, and the great way of Dao and the absolute beginning Heart Sutra that you’ve cultivated have very good control over your spiritual power, so ... I estimate that after you break through one more level, at most two levels, you should be able to refine a spiritual puppet!”

Xia ruofei was also very happy after hearing this because at least this goal was not too far away.

At the same time, he also caught a very important piece of information. He couldn’t help but ask,””Elementary spiritual puppet? Xia Qing, are there different grades for soul puppets?”

Xia Qing nodded and said,”that’s right. A primary spiritual puppet is the lowest level of spiritual puppets. Its spiritual intelligence is relatively low. However, it can still carry out orders to complete tasks. It’s just that its autonomy is less.”

Xia ruofei looked curiously at Xia Qing, who looked no different from a real person, and asked,””Then ... What level are you?”

Xia Qing’s degree of personification was really high. When he heard this, he actually revealed a proud expression and said,””Master, I have an ultimate spiritual puppet ... Above elementary spiritual puppet is intermediate spiritual puppet, then advanced spiritual puppet, and above that is the ultimate spiritual puppet ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”what kind of cultivation is needed to refine an ultimate spiritual puppet?” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Xia Qing said,”when the previous master made Xia Qing, he was already in the late stage of the Golden core stage. According to the previous master, it was quite difficult at that time. He only succeeded with a trace of luck ...”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but take a deep breath. At the same time, he realized the huge gap between them. He smiled and said,””It seems like I can’t aim too high!”

Xia Qing pursed her lips and didn’t say anything.

Xia ruofei waved his hand.”It’s okay. I’m done here. You can go back to your work!”

“Yes, master!”

With a thought, Xia ruofei used the invisible force of space and teleported to the beach by the space sea.

Atlantean 34 was standing quietly on the frame. To Xia ruofei, it was like a high – end toy. With a trace of anticipation, he reached out and touched the smooth body of the yacht. Then, he began to touch the fixing device.

In the morning, the workers used spanners to tighten it, and there were dozens of nuts.

Xia ruofei didn’t look for any more tools. He directly used his fingers to pinch the nut and twisted it lightly. The nut easily moved.

Xia ruofei’s movements were very fast. In a short while, he had removed dozens of screws. The yacht and the frame had also been officially removed.

With a slight thought, invisible spatial force gathered and wrapped around the yacht.

Then, the yacht slowly floated up in the air. The spatial force carried the yacht towards the sea and then gently placed it on the sea.

Xia ruofei’s toes touched the ground lightly and he leaped up lightly. He landed on the yacht like a Fallen Leaf and the body of the yacht did not even shake.

He stretched out his hand and flipped over to the control panel of the yacht.

Although Xia ruofei had never learned how to drive a yacht, he had played with a motorboat before. The principle was basically the same. Very soon, he successfully started the engine of the yacht.

He pushed the throttle lever forward, and the yacht immediately began to accelerate on the sea.

As the speed increased, Xia ruofei turned the steering wheel and controlled the yacht to change directions freely on the sea.

Anyway, there would never be a second ship here, and there would be no hidden reefs or patrol boats from the maritime department. Xia ruofei was free to do whatever he wanted.

The speed of the yacht was getting faster and faster. Xia ruofei could feel the wind blowing his hair up. The space contained a large amount of spiritual Qi. It felt more relaxed and happy to be able to speed on the sea at high speed.

After a few upgrades, the space ocean had expanded by two to three thousand meters. It was no longer just a small area near the sea. Xia ruofei was having a lot of fun.

In the end, he turned off the yacht’s engine and let the yacht rise and fall with the waves. He then went to the deck and lay there facing the sky, looking very relaxed.

Xia ruofei could feel that the space ocean was too quiet. Other than a few rays and abalones that occasionally appeared within the range of his spiritual power, the ocean was empty.

“Isn’t it time to enrich the marine life Community?” Xia ruofei muttered to himself.

If possible, he really wanted to raise a few whales in the space ocean, as well as such an abundance of marine fish. He imagined wearing a submarine and diving into his exclusive ocean, surrounded by all kinds of fish, turtles, and so on. That feeling made him very excited.

Xia ruofei decided to find a chance to go out to sea and have fun for a few days. He would also bring some marine creatures into the space sea. He wanted to make this place full of life.

If he were to go out to sea, the azmu yacht that he had taken a fancy to would be very useful.

It all depended on what price Qin Lan could negotiate. However, Xia ruofei had already made up his mind. He was ready to buy it when the price was about right. After all, it was a brand new yacht that could be bought without waiting for a day. There were not many opportunities like this.

If it wasn’t for the fact that the client had financial difficulties and needed to withdraw the funds in time, even if the client wanted to make a move in this situation, he would definitely increase the price and would not give in to the interest.

Hence, Xia ruofei felt that it was time to stop.

He laid down in the boundless space for a while, and even took a nap on the deck of the yacht, swaying gently with the waves.

After he woke up, he drove the yacht back to the beach. After dropping the anchor, Xia ruofei jumped back to the shore.

Next, he drove the all – terrain vehicle around the entire mountain sea realm.

After the spatial upgrade, as expected, the area of the entire mountain sea realm had expanded by a lot. Of course, there was a deeper level of upgrade. The rules of the entire space had changed. Xia ruofei’s current cultivation was not enough, so he could only feel a faint trace of it. It was impossible to grasp it.

Before leaving the spirit map space, Xia ruofei even caught the White realmfox and gave it a good lesson. He warned it to be obedient in the space and not cause trouble, especially destruction.

After returning to the outside world, Xia ruofei took a shower and started to practice the great way technique. He wanted to improve his cultivation as soon as possible so that he could refine the spiritual puppet as soon as possible.

The next day, Xia ruofei went to the farm cafeteria for breakfast as usual, and then followed the staff’s shuttle bus to the company headquarters.

After sitting down for a while, Lei Hu knocked on the door and came in. He smiled and said,”Brother Xia, I’ve already completed the task you assigned me yesterday!”

When there were no outsiders, Lei Hu would still call Xia ruofei “brother Xia.” However, when there were other people in the company, he would formally call Xia ruofei “Chairman.”

With that, Lei Hu passed the warehouse key to Xia ruofei across the table.

“Alright, thank you for your hard work, Hu!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Lei Hu grinned and said,”it’s nothing. Brother Xia, you’re welcome!” If there’s nothing else, I’ll go down first!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes!” Go do your work!”

Initially, Xia ruofei wanted to work for a while. However, after Lei Hu gave him the warehouse keys, his heart was no longer in the company. Hence, he simply took the keys and left the office.

Skipping work in less than ten minutes, he was the best Chairman in the world.

Xia ruofei drove the Knight XV to the warehouse.

When he opened the door, he saw all kinds of materials neatly placed in the warehouse. He was a little excited and closed the warehouse door. Then, with a thought, he put all the materials into the space.
