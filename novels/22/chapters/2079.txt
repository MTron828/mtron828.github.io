The CEO Huang that Liao Bo was talking about was the boss of the Tian Yang group in San Shan city. He had ordered an azmu 100 Leonardo yacht more than a year ago and had paid a deposit of more than 30 million Chinese dollars.

However, the world was unpredictable. The yacht was about to be delivered, but President Huang’s company was in big trouble. The Tianyang group was a small and medium – sized real estate company. The debt rate of a real estate company was relatively high, and they often walked on a tightrope when it came to capital operations.

President Huang was also unlucky. Several accidents had happened on the construction site one after another, and a project quality problem was exposed in a building under construction. All of these things piled together and made President Huang overwrought.

Because of the media exposure, several problematic construction sites of the Tianyang group were ordered to stop work and rectify. Even the application of the house pre – Sale certificate was stuck. This was what real estate companies were most afraid of. If the time was delayed, there would be problems with the capital chain.

Now, boss Huang was facing internal and external difficulties. The construction team and suppliers were all looking for him for money, and the bank loan was about to expire. Initially, he wanted to sell the houses to get back the funds, but after the real estate problem occurred, the pre – Sale certificate was blocked, and the company was suddenly in a desperate situation.

Under such circumstances, how could President Huang still be in the mood to play with the yacht? Moreover, there was still more than 30 million Yuan left, which he couldn’t take out now!

Not only was he unable to pay the rest of the money, but CEO Huang was also thinking about whether he could return the order. Even if he could not return all of the thirty million Yuan that he had paid in advance, even if he returned a portion of it, it could at least relieve the company’s financial pressure a little. Even if it was a drop in the bucket, it would still be useful.

Therefore, President Huang went to Qin Lan’s company.

In this case, it was impossible to cancel the order, because even the general model yacht was customized according to the buyer’s requirements. In this sense, every yacht was unique. Who would they sell it to if they returned it?

Besides, how could such a high – end toy that was worth tens of millions be easily sold? It was impossible to return the yacht from the manufacturer. The yacht had already been cleared through customs. If Qin Lan’s sales company bought it first, it would be equivalent to a backlog of tens of millions of funds. This was unacceptable.

Therefore, even though CEO Huang had come to mediate a few times, this matter had been stuck here. This made the sales company very distressed.

Today, when Liao Bo mentioned CEO Huang, Qin Lan’s mind couldn’t help but be active. If this problem could really be solved, it would be equivalent to solving a big problem for the company. It would definitely add many points to the leader’s side.

Furthermore, CEO Huang would definitely be extremely grateful to her. It was equivalent to solving a big problem for CEO Huang!

Qin Lan asked hesitantly,”little Liao, Mr. Xia doesn’t lack money. This yacht was ordered by someone else. It’s configured according to their thoughts. Can he ... Accept it?”

“How would we know if we don’t try?” Liao Bo said. Mr. Xia didn’t seem to be a particularly picky person. Besides, wasn’t the delivery time the most important thing to him? If he wants this yacht, he doesn’t have to wait and can use it immediately. Maybe he’ll be tempted?”

Qin Lan nodded heavily and said,””I’ll call him right now and tell him about this!”

Liao Bo quickly stopped Qin Lan and said,””Manager, I think it’s better to take a break first!”

“Why?” Qin Lan asked in confusion.

Liao Bo said,”he just finished his call. Wouldn’t it be too easy for us to reply so quickly?” Why don’t we do this? aren’t we going to send him the Atlantean 34 yacht tomorrow? Why don’t you make a trip there yourself and tell him about the situation in person? perhaps the effect will be better!”

Qin Lan pondered for a moment and said with a smile,””You’re full of ideas, kid! Let’s do this! If this deal is successful, you will have done a great service!”

“Thank you, manager!” Liao Bo laughed.

……

Xia ruofei didn’t know what had happened at the Yacht Club. He didn’t care about it after he hung up the phone. He heard that it took so long to pay for a yacht. Xia ruofei was a little hesitant. After all, a yacht wasn’t something he just needed.

He was too lazy to start a fire for lunch, so he went straight to the farm cafeteria for a meal.

Although the headquarters had been moved to the city, the farm’s cafeteria had not been removed. On the one hand, there were still many workers on the farm, and providing them with breakfast and lunch was considered a benefit. They only needed to pay a symbolic little money for each meal, and everyone welcomed them. They were used to going to work early every day and eating at the farm. On the other hand, some young employees were still living in the staff dormitory. They took the bus back to the farm from the city after work and often had dinner in the cafeteria.

It would not cost much to keep a cafeteria and hire a few more employees anyway. Xia ruofei would not save money in this aspect.

Xia ruofei had not returned to the farm for many days. When he arrived at the canteen, the workers all greeted him warmly. Cao tieshu’s wife, who was in charge of the canteen, even specially cooked a small stove for Xia ruofei and made a few of his signature dishes.

Xia ruofei happily sat at the same table with the workers and shared the extra dishes with everyone. They chatted as they ate, and the atmosphere was harmonious.

He didn’t put on any airs, and the benefits he gave everyone were so good, so everyone naturally liked this young boss.
