After she returned to her seat, Lu You came over and asked in a low voice,””Is the jaded skin ointment ready for mass production?”

“Yup!” Xia ruofei took a sip of his juice and said,”everyone said that it was effective, so we’re ready to put it on the market.”

Lu You said,”I also want a few portions of jaded skin ointment!” Even general Zhao’s wife has a share ...”

Xia ruofei laughed.”I’ll get some for Auntie Tian tomorrow. Why don’t you ask your mother for it?”

Lu You’s nose wrinkled cutely and she said,””That’s different! That’s for my mom, not for me ...”

“Alright, alright, alright!” Xia ruofei forced a smile and said,”as long as you don’t find it troublesome, I’ll contact you tomorrow!”

“It’s a deal!” The corners of Lu You’s mouth curled up into a beautiful arc.

Liu Jian and the rest were already used to Xia ruofei and Lu You’s whispers, so they were not surprised. However, their gazes were still ambiguous.

After three rounds of drinks, the birthday banquet was coming to an end. After all, elder song was 85 years old, and his rest time was very regular.

In the end, elder song gave a few simple words and the birthday banquet officially ended.

The guests took their leave one after another, and some of the song family’s descendants who lived outside also respectfully said their goodbyes to elder song. In fact, many of the song family’s descendants who worked in the capital had bought real estate outside. After all, living in the old house meant that they did not have freedom.

To Xia ruofei’s surprise, song Rui’s father, song Zhengping, also bade farewell to elder song and took a car to the airport.

Song Zhengping was now the head of the Xiang Nan Province. He was busier than when he was the provincial judge. This time, he came and went on the same day, even in a hurry to celebrate his father’s birthday.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel emotional.

Xia ruofei also noticed that no one had given him any gifts. Perhaps this was elder song’s rule.

Xia ruofei did not have the chance to take out the gift he had prepared in the backyard before the birthday banquet started. If he gave it now, it would be even more conspicuous, so Xia ruofei could only wait.

Even Lu You had gone home with Tian Huilan, but Xia ruofei had not left.

Song Rui was staying here, so he was not in a hurry. He sat down and chatted with Xia ruofei.

After a while, most of the guests had left. Xia ruofei saw elder song walking over and quickly stood up.

“Xia, we have a lot of guests today,” elder song said with a smile. “I didn’t manage to serve you well!”

Although it was a family banquet, it was difficult for someone at elder song’s level to control the birthday banquet to only be attended by family members. Moreover, even if only the song family members were attending, if even the branch family members were present, there would probably be more people than tonight.

Xia ruofei quickly replied,”you’re too kind, Sir. I’m getting along well with song Rui and the rest. We’re all young people. We have common topics.”

Eccentric song nodded with a smile, “Let’s stay here tonight! I’ll get the staff to arrange a guest room for you. ”

Xia ruofei said,”no, No, sir. I’ll go back to the hotel later. I’m staying here because I thought that since I’m already here, I should check your body.”

Elder song patted Xia ruofei on the shoulder and said,””Good, good, good, child, you’re so thoughtful ... Let’s go! Let’s go to the backyard ...”

Elder song brought Xia ruofei back to the backyard. Elder song’s daughter, song Zhilan, and song Rui were with them.

Song Zhilan was in charge of managing the song family’s business and spent most of her time in the capital. She had her own villa outside, but today was her father’s birthday, so she decided to stay the night at the old house.

Song Rui invited a group of service staff to pour tea for everyone.

Xia ruofei sat beside elder song and took his pulse seriously.

Xia ruofei’s medical skills were no longer the same as before, and he even had the help of his spiritual power. Hence, the pulse check was not just for show.

After a round of inspection, Xia ruofei revealed a gratified expression and said,””Chief, you’ve been maintaining your health very well. Your qi and blood flow are very energetic, and you don’t have any of the chronic diseases that are common for the elderly.”

Hearing this, eccentric song laughed in relief.”This is all to your credit, miracle doctor Xia! Every day I live is a profit ...”

Back then, elder song had been diagnosed with terminal cancer and was on the verge of death. It was Xia ruofei who had saved him from the gates of hell.

With such a serious illness, the old man’s body had naturally suffered great damage. Later, he went to Gu Ling courtyard to rest and recuperate for a long time. It was also Xia ruofei who sent him the diluted petal solution of the spirit Heart Flower regularly that slowly recuperated his body to its best state.

Elder song was already 85 years old, but he was in good health. He was around 60 or 70 years old. For an old man who had been diagnosed with late – Stage cancer, this was a miracle.

“Chief, as long as you recuperate properly, you’ll be able to live past a hundred years!” Xia ruofei smiled.

“Hahaha! Then I’ll have to borrow your auspicious words!”

After hearing Xia ruofei’s words, song Zhilan was overjoyed. Elder song was the pillar of support for the family. As long as elder song lived, the song family would prosper. The longer elder song lived, the longer the song family would prosper. If elder song could really live to a hundred years old, song Zhengping and the others would be the new pillars of the song family.

Of course, if it was someone else who said this, elder song and song Zhilan would at most take it as a lucky word. However, Xia ruofei was different. His medical skills had long won the admiration of elder song and song Zhilan. In the field of Traditional Chinese medicine and health maintenance, they naturally believed Xia ruofei’s words without a doubt.

Xia ruofei continued to tell elder song about the things to take note of in health.

“Chief, I saw that you’ve planted a lot of vegetables in your backyard during the day.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”proper exercise is good for the body!”

“Xiao Xia, what do you think of my skill?” elder song laughed and asked. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment.”You’ve taken good care of the vegetable field. I can tell that you’re an expert!”

“When I was young, I herded cows, chopped wood, and planted crops ... I’ve done all kinds of things. Although I haven’t planted vegetables for many years, I still have the skills!” Elder song said proudly.

“That’s right, that’s right, old but vigorous, old but strong!” Xia ruofei jokingly said,”Oh right, chief, I’ll send you some seeds of our paradise vegetables when I get back. You can improve the species!”

Elder song, who had eaten the vegetables in Taoyuan before, couldn’t help but be invigorated when he heard this. He immediately asked,””Little Xia, can those seeds of yours grow such beautiful and delicious vegetables in my place?”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.”Theoretically, there should be no problem. Our seeds have also been successfully planted in Australia.”

“Good, good, good!” Eccentric song was overjoyed and said,”prepare more seeds for me!” I’ll plant some Taoyuan vegetables to improve everyone’s meals ...”

Song Zhilan was previously quite opposed to her father growing vegetables in the backyard of his house. She felt that it was somewhat disgraceful for the leader and director of the former country’s Chu family to roll up his sleeves and become an old farmer.

However, now that Xia ruofei had said that it was good for old master’s health, song Zhilan couldn’t say anything more. However, when she saw the old and the young talking about growing vegetables, she couldn’t help but smile bitterly.

However, when elder song was recuperating in Gu Ling courtyard, Song Zhi LAN also ate some Taoyuan vegetables when she went to visit him.

Even song Zhilan, who had lived like a Prince, had a very deep impression of the peach Garden vegetables, which were first class in appearance and taste.

So now that she heard that her father was going to try to grow Peach Garden vegetables in the backyard, song Zhilan’s heart was faintly filled with anticipation.

“No problem! I’ll give the vegetable seeds to song Rui!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Then, Xia ruofei got to the main point. He took out the box containing the spirit – gathering Jade Guanyin from his bag and said,””Chief, I’ve prepared a birthday gift for you, but I didn’t dare to take it out because no one gave it to me at the banquet just now ...”
