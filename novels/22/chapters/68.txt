Chapter 69: Accompany me to see the sea (1)

The next day, Xia ruofei woke up very early and entered the spirit map space. He prepared all the vegetables that were to be provided for the XI Jiang Moon Club and Ling Ji restaurant. He also made a mark on the vegetable basket and sprinkled some spirit pond water on each basket to maintain its freshness. He then went to the garage on the first floor and took out all the vegetable baskets. After doing all this, Xia ruofei went to the kitchen to heat up a glass of milk and a few pieces of bread for breakfast. Not long after breakfast, Xia ruofei heard the sound of an engine from outside. He walked out of the villa and saw that the small truck from the West River Moon Club had arrived first. The purchaser was already familiar with the place. He greeted Xia ruofei and the two of them led the two workers into the garage. The vegetables for Xi jiangyue and Ling Ji were distributed separately. Xia ruofei asked the workers to carry all the vegetables out of the clubhouse, weighed the weights, and paid. Soon, the small truck from Xi jiangyue clubhouse carried Taoyuan vegetables out of the villa. Xia ruofei had an extra six to seven thousand Yuan in cash. The club and Ling’s restaurant would bring in more than 10000 Yuan of income every day, which was about 300000 Yuan a month. Including the succulent plants, Xia ruofei could deliver a batch of goods every half a month, which was about 400000 Yuan a month. In total, Xia ruofei’s monthly income was at least 700000. This money – making speed was terrifying, but it seemed that he spent money even faster. Xia ruofei estimated that even if he spent a month’s income on Jade, it might not be enough for the spirit map space to level up again. After all, the last evolution had consumed nearly 500000 Yuan of Jade. Xia ruofei strolled around the courtyard for a while before the second batch of guests arrived. A white truck and an orange Porsche 911 drove into the courtyard one after another. “RUO Fei!” Ling Qingxue called out happily after she got out of the car. She quickly walked towards Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei’s eyes suddenly lit up. Ling Qingxue was wearing a short leather jacket with a plaid shirt, tight – fitting jeans, and beige wool boots. Her figure was curvaceous, and her long legs, which made countless men’s imagination run wild, were tight. She was full of youthful energy. This was very different from how she usually dressed, which made Xia ruofei lose his focus. Ling Qingxue’s heart was filled with sweetness, and at the same time, her face flushed red.” “What are you looking at? Are there flowers on my face?” Xia ruofei quickly looked away, embarrassed. He laughed awkwardly and did not know how to answer. Ling Qingxue chuckled and glanced at Xia ruofei flirtatiously. She said softly,” “Dumbo ...” At this moment, a woman in a black business suit got down from the small truck. She walked over with the driver and a worker. When she saw that Xia ruofei was very humble, she bowed slightly and greeted,” “Good day, Mr. Xia!” “Ruofei, this is manager Xu from our procurement department!” Ling Qingxue introduced,”she used to be the deputy manager of the procurement department.” It was obvious that this was he Dong’s successor. For the procurement Manager to personally visit him for the first time to pick up vegetables, to a certain extent, it also reflected the importance that Ling Xiaotian attached to Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei smiled gently and said,” “Hello, manager Xu! The vegetables are all prepared, they’re in the garage, you can get the workers to move them!” “Okay, okay. Thank you, Mr. Xia!” Manager Xu said quickly. It was obvious that Ling Xiaotian had given him instructions before he came, so manager Xu knew that Xia ruofei’s paradise vegetables was of great importance to the company. Hence, his attitude was also very respectful, forming a sharp contrast with he Dong’s domineering attitude the other day. Soon, manager Xu brought the driver and workers to move the six baskets of vegetables to the villa’s courtyard. Manager Xu’s expression was full of excitement as she said to Ling Qingxue,” “Qingxue, this paradise vegetables really lives up to its reputation! I’ve been in the procurement business for so many years, but this is the first time I’ve seen such high – Quality and good – looking vegetables! I believe that these famous paradise vegetables will definitely restore our flagship store’s business to its original state, or even better than before!” Ling Qingxue smiled and said,” “Big sister Xu, I’ve already told my dad that ruofei’s vegetables are the best medicine for our company to get out of trouble! But that stubborn old man didn’t believe me, or else why would he go through so much trouble?” Ling Qingxue should have a good relationship with manager Xu, so she didn’t hold back when she spoke. However, as a subordinate, manager Xu also felt a little embarrassed when she heard Ling Qingxue say that about the chairman. She pursed her lips and smiled, not daring to respond. Soon, the vegetables were weighed by the pounds. Then, the price was calculated according to the price of 50 yuan for spinach and eggplant and 30 yuan for the other four vegetables. The total was more than 4500 Yuan. This price was almost half of the price given to the moon Club in Xijiang. Furthermore, they provided two more kinds of vegetables. Xia ruofei was definitely very generous. Manager Xu had also brought cash over and paid the money on the spot. Then, she instructed the workers to load the vegetables into the truck and politely bid Xia ruofei farewell. She left the holiday villa with the small truck. After manager Xu and the others left, only Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue were left in the villa. Ling Qingxue smiled at Xia ruofei and said,” “Alright! Now that we’re done with work, there’s only the two of us left. What do you plan to do with me?” Ling Qingxue even blinked at Xia ruofei cutely. Looking at Ling Qingxue, who had obviously dressed up, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel a little tempted. A long – legged beauty like MA Yinlong was standing in front of him, looking at him with her beautiful eyes full of love. She didn’t hide her love for him at all. As long as it was a normal man, he wouldn’t be able to help but feel moved. However, Xia ruofei asked himself honestly. Even though he had a good impression of Ling Qingxue, it was far from the level of liking her. Moreover, Ling Qingxue had been hiding her feelings since middle school. At that time, Xia ruofei had no impression of Ling Qingxue at all. If he were to go with the flow now, Xia ruofei would feel that he was lying to his feelings. Thus, he touched his nose awkwardly and said,” “Why don’t you ... Walk around or go into the house to watch TV while I ... Prepare lunch?” Ling Qingxue chuckled and said,” “It’s only eighto’ clock now. Why are you preparing lunch so early in the morning? Do you want to stay in the kitchen for the whole morning?” Xia ruofei laughed in embarrassment. Without waiting for Xia ruofei to reply, Ling Qingxue continued,” “I want to see the sea! You’ll come with me!” “Ah? “Uh ... Okay ...” Xia ruofei said. “Drive your car!” Ling Qingxue said happily. Then, she graciously hooked her arm around Xia ruofei’s and stuck her body close to him. Even though he was wearing a lot of clothes in the winter, Xia ruofei could still clearly feel the softness and elasticity of his arms. His body could not help but stiffen for a moment before he walked unnaturally towards the pickup truck ...
