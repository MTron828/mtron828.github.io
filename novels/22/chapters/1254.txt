Chapter 1255: Old Blake (2)

Translator: 549690339

He looked at Xia ruofei coldly and immediately lowered his head. He bowed to Xia ruofei and said loudly,””Mr. Xia, I’m sorry! Please forgive me for my previous offense!”

After saying this, Blake felt humiliated. His hatred for Xia ruofei had reached its peak.

How could Xia ruofei not know if Blake’s apology was sincere? However, he didn’t care at all. If it wasn’t for MA Xiong, he wouldn’t even have come to see the grandfather and grandson.

Blake Jr. Just stood there, and old Blake asked with a smile,””Mr. Xia, what do you think? The black family’s sincerity is acceptable, right?”

The head of the family had come here in person, and the troublemaker Blake had completely admitted defeat. In old Blake’s eyes, this was the greatest sincerity of the Blake family.

Xia ruofei smiled lightly.”Mr. Old Blake, at the end of the shencheng truffle auction at the beginning of the year, I’ve already said that unless George Blake makes a public apology in the media, the matter of him slandering our paradise corporation’s reputation will not end so easily!”

The smile on old Blake’s face faded a bit. He said,””Mr. Xia, I remember that there’s an old saying in China,” when it’s possible to forgive someone, you should forgive them. ” I believe that the Chinese are very generous. ”

“We also have a very famous soldier who once said that we should treat our comrades as warm as spring, and treat our enemies as cold and ruthless as winter.” Xia ruofei said casually.

Old Blake was stunned,”Mr. Xia, it’s just a young man’s mouth, there’s no deep hatred, right? And your paradise Corporation didn’t suffer any losses from this. ”

Xia ruofei squinted his eyes.”There’s no loss because our company handled the emergency well. It doesn’t mean that your precious grandson is right!”

“Of course, of course ...” Old Blake said,”Mr. Xia, let me tell you the truth! A public apology is impossible. Although George can’t do anything right, his name carries the family name ‘Blake’, and he’s also one of the legal heirs of the black group. His public apology will seriously affect the reputation of the black group, which is unacceptable to me. ”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,””Mr. Old Blake, thank you for your hospitality.”

Actually, Xia ruofei had not even had a bite yet!

After he finished speaking, he stood up and walked out.

Old Blake, who had always been elegant and polite, couldn’t hold it in anymore. He stood up and said,””Mr. Xia, please wait!”

Xia ruofei stopped in his tracks and turned around.””Mr. Old Blake, since you’ve already shown your bottom line, I don’t think it’s necessary for us to continue this conversation.” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“No, no, no,” old Blake said.”Mr. Xia, don’t be so anxious. We can talk about anything, can’t we?”

Xia ruofei’s heart skipped a beat. He walked back to his seat and sat down. He leaned back in his chair and asked calmly,””Mr. Old Blake, why don’t you tell us your demands first?”

The head of the black group must have come all the way to Hong Kong to resolve the dispute, so there must be something he wanted. Otherwise, why would he have the time to do so?

And with the pride of the black family, how could they be so polite to others?

Ever since the conflict at the beginning of the year, the black family’s attitude could be seen. Now that there was a sudden 180 – degree turn, it would be strange if there was no problem!

Old Blake smiled and said,”Mr. Xia, we are very interested in your company’s top – grade truffles. We hope to have the opportunity to cooperate.”

Xia ruofei’s eyebrows raised slightly. He was not too surprised. He asked indifferently,””What else?”

“I hope that the cooperation will be on a deeper level. It would be best if we can sign a supply agreement.” Old Blake looked into Xia ruofei’s eyes and said,”of course, we will not let your company suffer a loss in terms of price.”

Old Blake didn’t have a choice this time. As a high – end restaurant chain all over Europe, Blake’s group had a huge demand for truffles.

And this year’s truffle harvest was surprisingly poor.

If it was just a low harvest that caused the price to rise, the black group wouldn’t care. They were rich, and the increase in costs caused by market fluctuations would eventually be passed on to the consumers, so they wouldn’t suffer any losses.

What made old Blake mad was that this year’s truffle harvest was not only much lower, but the quality of the truffles was also generally low.

Of course, this wouldn’t be a big problem in the past. After all, all Western restaurants were the same. They weren’t the only one.

However, this year was different.

Not only was the weight of the truffles provided by the Paradise Corporation astonishing, but the quality was also ridiculously good.

Yesterday’s auction had already caused quite a stir in the European food and beverage industry.

Besides, several competitors of the black group had also made a fortune in the auction yesterday.

This put Blake’s group in a passive position.

As a heavyweight in the Western food industry, the Western restaurants under the black group actually didn’t provide truffles. In this long truffle harvesting season, they could only provide some truffles of poor quality, and their individual weight was completely incomparable to the truffles of paradise Corporation.

It would be a heavy blow to the reputation of the black group.

Old Blake had also heard about the storm at the auction in Shen Cheng city at the beginning of the year, but he didn’t take it seriously. He didn’t express any objection after his subordinates dealt with it.

It was only after the auction yesterday that he had attracted a lot of attention.

When old Blake found out that the reason why Blake group did not get any money at the auction was that his grandson, George Blake, had offended Xia ruofei, he was so angry that he smashed his cup.

Especially when Xia ruofei had publicly announced at the auction that he would never cooperate with Blake’s group in any form, old Blake was so angry that he wanted to beat up George Blake to vent his anger.

After careful consideration, old Blake decided to fly to Hong Kong in person. His only purpose was to resolve the grudges and get the opportunity to buy the best truffle.

As an old fox, old Blake knew that Xia ruofei must have more truffles. He would not sell all the goods at one auction. To him, this was a great opportunity for Blake’s group.

That was why he was so polite.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Mr. Old Blake, your request is not low!” After all, I just announced in public yesterday that I’ve blacklisted the black group and that we won’t allow them to attend any of our future auctions. Yet, you want me to take back what I said just by asking your grandson to apologize, and you even want to bypass the auction and directly buy the top – grade truffles in our hands? is there such a good thing in the world?”

Old Blake smiled bitterly and said,”Mr. Xia, you can tell me what you want. As long as it’s not an apology in the newspaper or any other request that will damage the reputation of the Blake group, I will try my best to fulfill it!” The financial compensation will definitely satisfy you!”

Xia ruofei glanced at Blake with great interest and smiled.””I believe in Mr. Old Blake’s sincerity, but I’m afraid that you won’t be able to fulfill my request ...”

“Tell me first!” Old Blake smiled and said,”you said it yourself, I’m very sincere.”

Xia ruofei didn’t keep her in suspense and said directly,””It’s very simple, take away his right to be the successor! Compensate our paradise corporation’s reputation and emotional damage, a total of 2 million USD!”

As soon as Xia ruofei finished speaking, Blake’s eyes widened and he said,””You’re crazy! What kind of sweet dreams are you having!”

Although his successor was very low in rank, he was at least the successor of the Blake group! With this identity, he could receive a considerable amount of money from the family. Xia ruofei’s casual words made him lose everything, which made him both shocked and angry.

Pa!

As soon as Blake finished his sentence, old Blake slapped him without hesitation. The crisp sound echoed in the room. Both Xia ruofei and Blake were stunned.
