Chapter 93: Big brother, I’ve finally found you_1

The pickup truck drove through the campus. The two people in the car did not speak, and the atmosphere was very strange. Xia ruofei glanced at Lu You from the corner of his eye. She sat in the front passenger seat, the seat belt wrapped around her chest, outlining her seductive curves. The lines of her face were very delicate. The winter sun shone through the car window, and her face seemed to be covered with a faint glow. However, Xia ruofei did not feel the pressing aura of youth. Instead, he felt that the temperature in the car had dropped because of Lu You’s presence. No matter how good – looking a face was, it would not be pleasant if it was sullen. This girl’s resentment towards him was a little deep ... What exactly did he do to make her unhappy? Xia ruofei’s heart was filled with question marks. When the car passed by the Civil engineering school’s main building, Xia ruofei stepped on the brakes and stopped the car by the side of the road. Then, he opened the door and got out of the car. He walked straight into the building. Lu You didn’t react for a moment. It was only after Xia ruofei got out of the car that she quickly stuck her head out and shouted,””Hey! Where are you going?” Xia ruofei said without turning his head,”I have three urgent needs. I’m going in to use the bathroom.” Do you want to join us?” Lu You’s face heated up. She spat and said,””Bah! Vulgar ...” She saw that Xia ruofei had already walked into the school building with a ‘anxious’ look on his face. She couldn’t help but kick the mat of the front passenger seat and thought,””What kind of person is this ... Why did he go to the bathroom at this time instead of at home? is he up to no good?” Lu You had the intention to go in and see what Xia ruofei was up to. However, she was shy after all. If Xia ruofei really went to the toilet, wouldn’t she be in big trouble? So in the end, he didn’t put it into practice and could only sulk in the front passenger seat. The waiting time always passed very slowly. After a few minutes, Xia ruofei still had not appeared. Lu You gritted her teeth in hatred. Just when she thought that Xia ruofei had fallen into the toilet, Xia ruofei finally appeared at the entrance of the teaching building. When Lu You saw Xia ruofei walking over unhurriedly, she was furious. She couldn’t help but stick her head out and mock,””You’ve been gone for a long time! Don’t tell me you cleaned the toilet for the Civil engineering College?” Xia ruofei had a harmless smile on his face. He opened the car door and sat in the driver’s seat. “I’m sorry! I caught a cold yesterday and had a stomach ache. Sorry for making you wait!” Lu You snorted with a cold face and ignored Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei chuckled and didn’t think much of it. He started the car and drove out of the school. Naturally, he didn’t really go to the toilet just now. He just went to find a quiet place in the teaching building to summon the spirit map scroll and took out a small, flat, stainless steel wine pot from his space. It was filled with a solution of flower petals that Xia ruofei had prepared in advance. The amount of petals in the solution was about one – third of the total. Then, he used his mobile phone to search for some Chinese medicine formulas for nursing children with autism. He firmly remembered one of the formulas that had milder medicinal properties and was mainly for nursing. It took a lot of time to search for the information because Xia ruofei had to make comparisons to ensure the accuracy and safety of the prescriptions. At the same time, he had to remember the ingredients, the amount, the dosage, and other information. After doing all this, Xia ruofei deliberately walked out of the teaching building unhurriedly. After wasting so much time, Lu You was naturally impatient. Fortunately, on the way to the pharmacy, Xia ruofei did not cause any more trouble. Otherwise, Lu You would really go crazy. There was a pharmacy at the Tongsheng Hall near Sanshan University. Xia ruofei walked towards the pharmacy after parking the car. Lu You naturally followed him quickly. It was obvious that she was ‘monitoring’ Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei didn’t mind and told the shopkeeper a series of herbs, such as foxglove, Poria Cocos, Mandrill, Chinese Magnolias, etc. They were all common Chinese medicinal herbs. He even asked the shopkeeper to separate and pack these herbs. Just as the shop assistant went to prepare the medicinal ingredients, a pleasant voice rang out,””Youyou!” Lu You turned her head and smiled happily. She called out,””Yueyue! What are you doing here?” The girl named Yueyue was wearing a short white down jacket and blue jeans. She was tall and slim. She had a standard and exquisite oval face, and a pair of big, watery eyes. Yueyue blushed and said in a low voice,””My stomach hurts, so I’m here to prescribe some Chinese medicine ...” This was a girl’s problem. She saw that Lu You was with a young man and was naturally embarrassed to say it too clearly. After she finished speaking, Yueyue couldn’t help but steal a glance at Xia ruofei with a red face. It didn’t matter if he didn’t look, but with one look, Yueyue’s mouth opened slightly. Her face gradually showed a surprised expression as she stared at Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel uncomfortable being stared at by a beautiful woman. Lu You was even more confused. Just as she was about to ask about the situation, Yueyue had already walked directly to Xia ruofei. “Big brother!” She cried out in surprise. I’ve finally found you!” Xia ruofei was shocked. What was going on? Could it be that I have a long – Lost sister outside? Xia ruofei’s expression fell into Yue Yue’s eyes. She asked,””Big brother, don’t you remember me?” Lu You looked at Xia ruofei and asked Yueyue with a slight frown,””Yueyue, what happened? Did this guy deceive your feelings? Don’t be afraid, tell me, I’ll help you teach him a lesson!” “Hey! Lu You, don’t spout nonsense!” Xia ruofei quickly said,”I don’t even know this lady!” Yueyue also blushed and said,””Youyou, how can you be so rude?” She then looked at Xia ruofei with her big eyes and said,””Big brother, you really don’t remember? More than two months ago, in the shanty town next to the Sanshan square ...” Xia ruofei suddenly realized what was going on and said,””Hey...It’s you! If you didn’t remind me, I really wouldn’t have remembered. By the way, is your leg alright?” It turned out that this Yueyue was the girl that Xia ruofei had saved in the alley of the shanty town. It was also because of that injury that Xia ruoxin had flown back to the rented house to look for a first aid kit. The blood from her wound had dripped onto the spirit map scroll, and it had accidentally opened the spirit map space. Yueyue said happily,”big brother, you finally remembered!” My foot is fine! Thank you for that day ...” Lu You said with a puzzled expression,””What are you two talking about?” Yueyue happily grabbed Lu You’s hand and said,””Youyou, Didn’t I tell you about the time I met a few hooligans in the shanty town next to the three mountains square? It was this big brother who helped me beat the hooligan away. In order to save me, he even cut his arm with a dagger ...” [PS] today is the birthday of my fellow reader “Xingyun.” I wish you a Happy Birthday! The role I promised you will be appearing soon. Consider it a late birthday present! It’s the last two or three days. I’ll continue to ask for a ticket to Sanjiang. Qidian’s readers can get one ticket every day. It’s free and is on the old website, Sanjiang channel. After getting it, the voting will also be on that channel page. It’s a little troublesome.
