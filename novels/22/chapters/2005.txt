2006 Sticking to one’s heart (2)

Although Monica didn’t kill them today, Toles was dead. Who knew if the Gelman family would vent their anger on her She couldn’t return to her family. Of course, she didn’t want to go back at all.

After Monica finished speaking, her expression suddenly changed, and she said in a hurry,Mr. Xia, can you do me a favor

Xia ruofei asked while driving,Don’t worry, tell me what’s the matter first.

Monica said anxiously,please save my brother! If I run out, they’ll definitely vent their anger on my little brother! Also, if the Gelman family asks them for my brother and they can’t hand him over, they might hand my brother over! I beg you to help me ...

They Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows and asked,who are they

It’s the people from my family! Monica said,Mr. Xia, we don’t have much time ... I’ll explain to you later!

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,You lead the way!

Thank you! Thank you! Monica said gratefully,there’s a bridge that we can cross after driving for about two kilometers. My brother is in a Rehabilitation Center in the city!

In fact, Monica’s younger brother, Rossi, did not need to stay in the rehabilitation Center for a long time. He only needed to undergo regular rehabilitation training. However, since Toles had let out the word that he wanted Monica to be his woman, the Grasso family had arranged for Rossi to stay in the rehabilitation Center and had sent people to watch over him strictly in order to make Monica submit.

With such a huge incident happening tonight, Monica had to quickly rescue her brother and settle him down before the Grao family and the Gelman family could react. Otherwise, it would be too late.

Xia ruofei nodded and sped up.

When the car was crossing the bridge, Xia ruofei asked half – jokingly,Monica, I’ve helped you so much. How are you going to thank me

Monica’s heart skipped a beat. She looked at Xia ruofei carefully and said,Mr. Xia, I’m penniless right now, but as long as I can escape Europe with my brother, we’ll definitely repay you in the future!

After such an incident, she definitely could not stay Italy. Even the entire Europe had the power of the Mafia, so Monica decided to leave Europe with her brother.

In fact, even if they hid at the ends of the earth, if the Mafia family was determined to take revenge, they would not be able to hide at all. However, Monica could not think so much now. She could only take one step at a time.

Xia ruofei sized Monica up on purpose, which made Monica feel a little scared. Then, he smiled and said,Actually, if you want to thank me, you don’t have to wait until the future! You know what I mean ...

Monica’s expression changed slightly. The thing she was most worried about had still happened. This very powerful Chinese young man in front of her actually had a desire for her body ...

Monica was having an intense mental struggle in her heart. To be honest, Monica had a very good impression of this ‘Xia Tian’ from China. She even had a natural sense of closeness to him. Even when he looked at her with that frivolous gaze just now, Monica could not feel any disgust in her heart.

Sometimes, Monica even had the illusion that Xia ruofei was beside her.

However, she kept reminding herself that an illusion was just an illusion. This was Xia Tian, not Xia ruofei. No matter how powerful Xia Tian was or how friendly he felt to her, he could never replace Xia ruofei.

Gradually, Monica’s eyes became determined. She said,Mr. Xia, please stop the car! I don’t think I can satisfy your request. You saved my life, and I’m very grateful to you, but that’s all ...

Xia ruofei smiled playfully and asked,Then you’re not going to care about your brother

Monica looked like she was struggling, but in the end, she said with determination,I’ll think of another way, so there’s no need to trouble Mr. Xia ...

Now, Monica was a little worried. If he did not let her go this summer, or if he used force, she would have no chance of resisting. Even Toles, the top fighter of the Gehrman family, was like a stupid pig in front of him. How could she, a weak and unarmed woman, resist

Monica could only pray in her heart.

At this moment, Xia ruofei suddenly laughed and said,I was just joking with you! Look at how nervous you are!

Monica looked at Xia ruofei hesitantly. When she realized that his eyes had become very clear and did not have any distracting thoughts, Monica’s heart relaxed slightly.

Xia ruofei saw that she was still silent and couldn’t help but say,There’s a fork in the road ahead. How should I go Show me the way!

Monica came back to her senses and quickly said,Turn right at the intersection ahead!

Xia ruofei nodded and turned the car to the right.

Mr. Xia, why ... Why are you helping me Monica asked hesitantly.

Xia ruofei shrugged and said,fate! We Chinese are all about fate. We were able to meet in Toles ‘villa and are both his enemies. Isn’t this fate Besides, you have a Chinese friend who also has the surname Xia. This is even more of a fate!

For some reason, Monica believed ‘Xia Tian’s words. Perhaps it was because Xia ruofei had once told her about fate.

Her mood instantly brightened up, and the haze from before was swept away.

With Monica’s guidance, the car drove all the way to a Rehabilitation Center.

At night, the rehabilitation Center was closed and locked. Looking through the iron gate, there were still many rooms with lights on.

Xia ruofei asked Monica about Rossi’s exact location. Although the Grao family had kept Rossi under house arrest, they did not restrict Monica from visiting him. Thus, Monica knew exactly which building and room her brother was in.

Xia ruofei made a mental note of it and then parked the car at a roadside parking space not far from the rehabilitation Center.

Monica, get out of the car! He said.

After the two of them got out of the car, Xia ruofei said to Monica,You hide in the bushes. Don’t move until I come back! Unless it’s me, don’t move no matter who calls you, even if it’s your brother!

Are you going in alone Monica quickly said,let me lead the way for you! I’ve been here a few times, so I’m very familiar with the place!

Xia ruofei smiled and said,didn’t you already tell me the location With the information you’ve provided, I don’t need anyone to lead the way. I’ll definitely find Rossi soon!

Xia ruofei paused and passed the gun to Monica.Remember what I said, hide in the grass!

Xia ruofei did not know how important Monica was to the Grao family and the Gelman family. He also did not know if they would rush over overnight to take Rossi away. However, there was no harm in being careful. This Mercedes – Benz was already riddled with holes. It would be too big of a target if it was parked here.

If Monica hid in the bushes, it was very likely that she would be in a dark situation. At least, she could delay for some time.

I ... I don’t know how to use a gun! Monica said nervously.

It’s very simple! Xia ruofei said,this is the safety. Pull it down and you can remove the protection. The bullet is already loaded. Once you remove the safety, just aim and fire. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Xia ruofei looked at Monica and said,Remember, if there’s any danger, fire immediately. Even if you don’t hit the enemy, it doesn’t matter. I’ll rush over as soon as I hear the sound of gunfire!

Monica nodded her head heavily and said,I understand, Mr. Xia. You should be careful too. As far as I know, my family has arranged for at least eight people to watch over my brother in shifts. These people are very powerful, and they are likely to have guns ...

Xia ruofei nodded and said,understood! You just wait here! Don’t worry, I’ll definitely save your brother!

With that, Xia ruofei turned around and ran towards the rehabilitation Center.
