Chapter 781: Chapter 517 – catch them all in one fell swoop (1)

The team members of the third group immediately set off and sneaked to the vicinity of the three hidden sentries.

Under Guo Zhan’s command through the walkie – talkie, the members of the three groups stood up at the same time and pounced on the hidden sentries from the grass. One of them took action while the other assisted from the side.

The three Japanese secret sentries did not expect the most elite special Forces of the Chinese military to be right in front of them. The result of their defenseless situation was self – evident.

The three team members ‘actions were almost exactly the same. One hand covered the Japanese’s mouth, and the other hand waved the extremely sharp military dagger. After a cold flash, the Japanese’s throat suddenly spurted out bright red blood. His body stiffened for a moment and then quickly fell.

Another team member went forward and stabbed the heart. They cooperated very well, and the three Japanese secret sentries silently walked to the road to the yellow Springs. They couldn’t be more dead.

“Target No. 1 has been killed.”

“Target No. 2 has been killed.”

“Target No. 3 has been killed.”

The team member’s voice came from the earpiece.

Guo Zhan ordered without the slightest hesitation,”the perimeter has been cleared!” Begin the attack on brick kiln No. 4. Move!”

The three groups of team members immediately began to circle around from the side, while the main force of the small team led by Guo Zhan stood up from the bushes like a tiger coming out of the mountains, and quickly advanced towards the brick kiln in a battle formation.

There were three exits to the brick kiln. The six members were responsible for suppressing the enemies on the flanks, while Guo Zhan led Xia ruofei and the other members to break in from the front.

The tactical literacy of the lone wolf assault team members was first – Class, and their speed was very fast. Moreover, the place where they originally started was only 60 to 70 meters away from the brick kiln, and the Wei nation agents in the brick kiln didn’t even have time to react.

...... UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

In the blink of an eye, everyone had already passed through a small open space in front of the brick kiln.

It was only then that the Japanese in the brick kiln realized that the fully armed Chinese soldiers were already in front of them. They were all disheartened and hurriedly organized a counterattack.

Tap tap tap tap ...

The crisp sound of gunfire rang out, and the two sides finally entered the moment of close combat.

The members of the lone wolf assault team quickly scattered and hid, then fired back.

The moment Xia ruofei heard the gunshot, his blood started to boil. It was as if he had returned to the military camp, which was full of memories of his youth.

He leaned against a low wall and quickly fired a burst of bullets in the Japanese’s direction. Then, he stomped his feet and almost jumped into the air, easily climbing over the low wall.

Xia ruofei rolled on the ground and dodged the chain of bullets from the Wei nation agent while unloading the momentum. The scene looked a little dangerous, but Xia ruofei felt like he was doing it with ease.

Guo Zhan’s expression changed when he saw Xia ruofei rush out. He quickly gathered the soldiers around him to suppress Xia ruofei with their firepower and provide cover for Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei crouched and slithered forward. He quickly hid behind a tree.

In a few seconds, he had already advanced more than ten meters, and was only a stone’s throw away from the entrance of the brick kiln.

Xia ruofei took a deep breath and listened carefully for the gunshots around him. Suddenly, half of his body appeared from behind the tree. He clenched his submachine gun with both hands and fired decisively in the direction where the firepower was the fiercest.

Da da da! Da da da!

One of the Wei nation’s machine guns suddenly misfired. Xia ruofei didn’t have time to aim at all in the blink of an eye. He only relied on his senses and rich battlefield experience to shoot quickly, but he accurately shot the Wei nation’s Japanese man who was controlling the machine gun.

The Japanese’s firepower stopped for a moment. Guo Zhan immediately made a sign, and the follow – up assault team members also jumped out from their hidden positions and rushed toward the brick kiln.

From the left and right flanks, the crisp sound of sniper gunfire could be heard.

Two snipers were assigned to the left and right wings of the two teams. They took the opportunity to shoot from the narrow gaps and had already killed three Japanese.

The rest of the Japanese were like birds startled by the mere twang of a bow. While they fired back, they tried to hide in the blind spots of their shots, afraid that they would be targeted by snipers.

As a result, their counterattack firepower was inevitably affected and weakened.

Including kappei Yamai, Xia ruofei and the rest had already killed four of them at the periphery. There were only seven or eight Japanese people left in the brick kiln. Two of them had been killed during the head – on attack just now. Including the three who had been pointed out by the sniper, there were only two or three Japanese people left in the brick kiln.

It was a done deal.

In fact, the Wei nation agents ‘plan couldn’t be said to be not thorough, and every step was obviously carefully calculated, including the fact that after they kidnapped Liang Qiming, they used a special drug to cover up almost all the smell of their bodies when they fled one or two hundred meters in the direction of the cafeteria.

However, no matter how much they calculated, they did not expect Blackie’s sense of smell to be much more sensitive than a police dog ‘s.

Once a flaw was revealed, it would be difficult to avoid being traced.

In addition, Xia ruofei had used the never – before – seen “mini – Scouts”, Hornet, when he was investigating. The Japanese had been completely unaware of the situation and had gotten a clear picture of the situation.

China’s most elite special Forces were dispatched, and they had such detailed information. The terrain was also extremely unfavorable to them. It was not surprising that this group of Japanese was at a dead end.

In consideration of professor Liang Qiming’s safety, Guo Zhan and the others did not dare to use weapons such as grenades and flamethrowers. Otherwise, they would only need to hold the flamethrower and spray it into the brick kiln. In such a closed space, no matter how many Japanese there were, it would not be enough to burn them.
