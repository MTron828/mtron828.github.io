Chapter 3389: Lingering i

Purple represented the perfect level, but he didn’t know what the other colors represented. Anyway, Xia ruofei wouldn’t have the chance to see it.

Ling Qingxue saw that Xia ruofei was suddenly in a daze and could not help but ask,””Ruofei, what’s wrong?”

Xia ruofei turned to look at Ling Qingxue and suddenly smiled brightly. He said,””Qingxue! 1 just received the mission completion notification. We have succeeded! And it even received the highest rating!”

Ling Qingxue was stunned for a moment, then she jumped up in joy and said,””I knew it, ruofei, you’re the best! There’s nothing that can stump you!”

“I’ll feel embarrassed if you praise me like that…” Xia ruofei winked and said,”even though you’re telling the truth!”

Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but burst out laughing.””You bastard! You’ve grown thick – skinned!”

Then, Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but say,””The missions in the Tower of Trials are really difficult! 1 don’t know about the others, but without your help, even if I’m lucky enough to make it to the 5th level, 1’11 definitely be eliminated …”

Xia ruofei nodded in agreement and said,””The trial Pagoda’s tests are more comprehensive. For example, this level tests a cultivator’s understanding of arrays. The first few levels also tested different aspects. This requires that the cultivators who enter the Tower of Trials must be well – rounded. Otherwise, if they encounter something they’re weak in, even if the cultivator is very strong in other aspects, they can’t avoid the fate of being eliminated!”

Ling Qingxue held Xia ruofei’s arm and smiled.””l’m hitching a ride. Maybe if I follow you, 1’11 be guaranteed to the highest floor!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”! don’t even have much confidence in myself!” After all, compared to other cultivators, 1 haven’t been in the world of cultivation for long, so 1 can’t be considered to be very comprehensive. If the content of the test is something I don’t understand at all, then 1 can only try my best to catch it!” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Ling Qingxue giggled and said,”I believe you!” With your ability, even if you learn it on the spot, you’ll definitely be much stronger than others!”

“Oh, RUO Fei,” Ling Qingxue continued,”you’ve completed all the quests on the fifth level of the trial Pagoda. Are there any rewards?”

Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”in the previous prompt, it said that there will be a reward.” Moreover, the higher the completion rate of the third part of the mission, the more generous the rewards would be. Logically speaking, I should have received the highest reward since my completion was rated as perfect. However, there hasn’t been any reaction so far!”

“Don’t worry, this trial Pagoda must have been set up by a very powerful senior. Since he said there will be a reward, then you will definitely be rewarded!” Ling Qingxue said with a smile.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”that makes sense!” A senior expert definitely wouldn’t go back on his words …”

In the hidden space enshrouded in purple mist, the green – robed elder who was kneeling in the Grand Hall couldn’t help but laugh when he heard Xia ruofei’s words.””This little kid! Your eyes are only focused on that little bit of profit, how can such vision be regarded as a big deal?”

After he finished speaking, the elder in the green Daoist robe couldn’t help but sigh and mumble to himself,””But you can’t blame this child. We old people left in a hurry, which led to the loss of many inheritances. The environment of the cultivation world is also deteriorating day by day. This child was so happy to receive a few hundred origin crystals, it can be seen how much suffering he had to go through!”

If other people in the world of cultivation heard what the green – robed elder said, they would definitely spit out blood. Xia ruofei was already one of the richest people in the world of cultivation. His life had never been tight. If Xia ruofei had suffered a lot, then how could the other low – Level cultivators who were struggling at the bottom have a good life?

Ling Qingxue was the same as Xia ruofei. They had no idea that their every move was being watched by the elder in the green Taoist robe.

She looked at Xia ruofei and asked,”ruofei, what do we do next?”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”the entrance to the sixth level of the trial Pagoda has been opened. It’s marked on my map. However, 1 don’t want to go there yet.”

“Ah? Why?” Ling Qingxue asked curiously.

Xia ruofei smiled and pointed at the stone pillar array in front of him.””This is an incomparably profound formation technique, more exquisite than any formation technique 1 know of. Just now, in order to complete the mission, 1 did some research on this formation technique, but it’s still very superficial. It’s mainly from the perspective of completing the mission, a rough study of the general direction. Now that the mission has been completed and we haven’t been teleported out, it’s a good opportunity for me to learn array Dao. If 1 don’t take this opportunity to study this formation, wouldn’t I be returning empty – handed from a Treasure Mountain?”

“That makes sense!” Ling Qingxue smiled sweetly, then said obediently,”I’ll listen to you. We’re not in a hurry!”

Xia ruofei patted Ling Qingxue’s hand and said,””It’s just that 1 feel bad for making you wait for a long time every time …”

Ling Qingxue chuckled and said,”you’ll be able to easily pass the test after waiting for a while.. Where else can you find such a good thing?” Others wouldn’t even have the chance to wait! Hurry up and go! 1’11 watch some shows when I’m bored!”
