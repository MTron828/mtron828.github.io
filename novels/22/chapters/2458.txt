2459 The peach blossom gathering (2)

Zhuo Yiyi was at a loss for words. After a long while, she glared at Song Wei and said,””I didn’t expect that you’d become bad after not seeing you for a few months! Sister Qingxue, Wei Wei used to be an obedient girl! Now it’s simply ... I don’t even know who he learned it from!”

Ling Qingxue glanced at Xia ruofei with a half – Smile and said,””A bad man must have led her astray!”

“That’s right, that’s right!” Zhuo Yiyi said,”Weiwei, you’ve fallen!”

Xia ruofei laughed bitterly to himself.”It’s fine for you women to tease each other, but why are you looking at me?” So Wei Wei was led astray by me? Was this considered a collateral damage?

Luckily, Ling Qingxue only glanced at Xia ruofei and did not make it too obvious. Hence, Zhuo Yiyi and Zhao Yongjun did not notice anything unusual.

Song Wei was standing diagonally opposite Ling Qingxue. She had seen everything that had happened just now, and she could not help but feel embarrassed.

Although Song Wei and Xia ruofei did not have any physical contact, they had tried all kinds of embarrassing positions when they were cultivating their spirit bodies together. Therefore, Song Wei was much bolder when it came to sex.

In the past, the shy Song Wei would not have teased Zhuo Yiyi like that.

She felt a little guilty from Ling Qingxue’s intentional or unintentional gaze, so she quickly changed the topic.””Big brother Zhao, didn’t you want to show us around the club? Yiyi, you come with us!”

“Good, good!” Zhuo Yiyi said happily,”I was worried that I’d be bored attending the celebration here! I didn’t want to come at first, but now that sister Qingxue and Weiwei are here, I’m sure it won’t be boring!”

Following that, Zhuo Yiyi shouted at Wei Jun, who was not too far away,””Little Wei! Help me tell song xiaorui that I’m going on a tour of the club with Weiwei!”

“Alright!” Wei Jun quickly replied. Sister Yiyi, you go! I’ll tell brother Rui!”

“Let’s go!” Zhuo Yiyi said excitedly,”big brother Zhao, I’ll have to trouble you!”

Zhao Yongjun and Xia ruofei looked at each other and smiled bitterly. The three women had chatted for a long time and finally remembered them.

And so, Zhao Yongjun led Xia ruofei and the other three into the club.

Zhao Yongjun introduced as he walked,””Ruofei, you should be more familiar with the area on our left. It’s the mushroom house where xiangnan TV filmed life to look forward to. As it doesn’t take up a lot of space, we managed to retain the original feel. There are also a few guest rooms there. Members who are interested in experiencing it can stay there or make their own meals. You can even fish at the side. It’s a little like a homestay!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””I even stayed there for a night! The environment there isn’t bad, and it seems to match the style of our entire paradise gathering. There’s nothing that feels out of place!”

“Yeah!” Zhao Yongjun laughed. Xiangnan TV has just finished filming. Originally, before the filming ended, the first few episodes would have been broadcast at the same time, but because of an internal issue with their seating arrangement, they had a conflict with another variety show, so there was a delay. A few days ago, when xiangnan TV’s production team left, they even asked me to explain it to you!”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”what’s there to explain?” Wasn’t it the same when it was broadcast? Even if it’s not broadcasted, I don’t care. I’ll just treat it as a one – day trip in the countryside!”

Xia ruofei had agreed to participate in the recording of life’s dream because of Zhao Yongjun and the others, including Feng Jing. On the other hand, it was for the publicity company’s consideration.

He didn’t really want to be exposed to the public, so even if the show couldn’t be aired and some of the company’s exposure was lost, he didn’t really care.

Zhao Yongjun nodded and continued,””The area on the right is a small golf course. Although it’s not a standard 18 – hole course, it’s very good for leisure and entertainment!”

“If you have time, go and try it out!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

At this time, song Rui’s voice came from behind them,””Ruofei, you know how to play golf?”

After song Rui parked his car in the parking lot inside the entrance, he heard from Wei Jun that Ling Yiyi and Xia ruofei had gone to visit the clubhouse. He immediately ran over and was still panting.

Xia ruofei turned around and smiled.””All of you, go away. Are you really okay? We didn’t neglect any guests, right?”

“How many people in the circle deserve to be welcomed by me personally?” Song Rui waved his hand nonchalantly and said,”besides, there’s still Liu Jian, Xu Zixuan, and the others!”

Then, song Rui asked with great interest,””Ruofei, have you played golf before?”

Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”no!” I’ve seen it on TV before! Now we have our own golf course. If there’s a chance, we can come and play!”

“No problem!” Song Rui said with a smirk. I’m pretty skilled, I can teach you! When the time comes, let’s have a few matches and train in actual combat. Your level will definitely improve very quickly!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said.

“But there’s got to be a bit of a stake for the competition!” Song Rui said with a smile,”otherwise, without stimulation, I can’t perform to my best!”

Xia ruofei replied nonchalantly,”no problem!” What’s the big deal with adding a little bit of luck! Even if I lose, I’ll just treat it as my tuition fees!”

Zhuo Yiyi looked at him in disdain and said,”song xiaorui, how can you do this?” Handsome Xia doesn’t even know how to play golf, and you’re still pulling him into a bet! Isn’t this a scam?”

“How can it be a scam?” Song Rui said,” You don’t know this, but ruofei is too rich. All of us combined don’t even have one – tenth of his wealth! This was called beating the rich and dividing the rich! You see, RUO Fei himself doesn’t have any objections, right?”

Then, song Rui immediately said,”I saw a Swarovski crystal pendant last time and I’ve been thinking of buying it for you, but I’m short of money!” After winning against RUO Fei, won’t I have enough money to buy you a present?” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Xia ruofei stood at the side and laughed as he watched song Rui show off. He did not say anything.

Ling Qingxue and Song Wei pursed their lips and laughed. They looked at song Rui with sympathy. Even if Xia ruofei had never touched a Golf Club before, he was a cultivator at level 9 of the Qi refining realm and his spiritual power had reached the spirit gathering realm. With his precise control of his power, wouldn’t it be easy for him to win against song Rui?

She just didn’t know what song Rui’s expression would be like if he lost all his pants.

Zhao Yongjun still had the air of an older brother and didn’t join in. He just continued to lead everyone forward.

Zhao Yongjun pointed at a six – story building and said,””This is the main building of our paradise society. Most of the entertainment and leisure facilities are inside, and the area is about 2500 square meters.”

Then, Zhao Yongjun led everyone into the main building of the club.

The work of an internationally renowned designer was extraordinary. The building looked very spiritual from the outside. It was not a rigid square shape, but was made up of square modules of various sizes that were put together like building blocks. There was a sense of harmony in the disorder, and many of the designs were in line with Chinese traditional culture.

These modules used a large number of glass curtains, so the internal lighting would be very good.

After entering the main building of the club, Zhao Yong Jun brought Xia ruofei and the rest to look around. There was a gym, a bowling alley, a SPA, a KTV, a sauna, a swimming pool ... Basically, all the common entertainment facilities were here, and there were also many guest rooms of various styles.

Of course, the Ling’s private kitchen was also arranged to be in the main building, on the first floor.

After leaving the main building, Zhao Yongjun brought Xia ruofei and the others on a tour. Other than the main building and the mushroom house, there were also some small villas scattered around. They could provide accommodation, parties, and other needs.

Zhao Yongjun pointed at a small villa by the lake and smiled.””We built a villa in that area according to your request. We’ve also given orders that it’s not open to the public!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but stare at the array core. He was the one who had specifically suggested building a villa on it.

As cultivators, Song Wei and Ling Qingxue were also keenly aware that the spiritual Qi in that direction was much denser. Their beautiful eyes couldn’t help but reveal a trace of amazement.
