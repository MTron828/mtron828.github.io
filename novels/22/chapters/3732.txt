Senior copper coffin smiled and said,”Shanhe is a firm supporter of the third point of view!” He was proficient in the art of divination and was one of the most outstanding people in the younger generation of the cultivation world at that time, so his opinion naturally received the support of many people …”

“Then … How did the cultivation world deal with this matter?” Xia ruofei asked,”why did all the cultivators above the nascent Soul Stage disappear? why did the cultivation environment on earth continue to deteriorate?”

Senior copper coffin shook his head and said,”I’m not too sure about this. Not long after, a life – and – Death battle broke out between me and that spirit body in this underground Palace. In the end, both of us were injured. We hid in this dark corner to recuperate. Without realizing it, hundreds of years have passed

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel a little disappointed. He had a feeling that he was about to unveil the mystery of this matter, but he didn’t expect that senior copper coffin’s understanding of the situation would end here.

But right at this time, senior copper coffin revealed a thoughtful expression, and said,””But… I did hear some news …” He said.

After saying that, senior copper coffin looked at Song Wei and Ling Qingxue, who were not far away. After thinking for a while, he changed his tone and said,”Nephew, this matter is of great importance. The cultivation of your two Dao companions is too low. It’s not a good thing for them to know too much, and it may affect their Dao heart, so let’s talk about it through voice transmission!”

Xia ruofei immediately nodded.’Alright. This concerns the survival of the cultivation world. Please enlighten us, uncle master Zhao!”

Senior copper coffin smiled and transmitted a message,'”TH naturally tell you everything 1 know. In fact, I also want to know what happened back then! Nephew, before I agreed to fight with the spirit body, I heard a piece of news. However, with the passage of time, I’m afraid it’s hard to tell whether it’s true or false. I’m only telling you this as a reference.”

“Uncle – Master Zhao, please speak!” Xia ruofei transmitted his voice.

Senior copper coffin nodded and continued to transmit his voice,””It’s like this. 1 heard that a few leaving aperture stage cultivators seemed to support Shan He’s point of view. They seemed to be planning to go to the moon to investigate!”

“Hiss …” Xia ruofei could not help but gasp.

If even the cultivators of the leaving aperture stage at that time were inclined to believe that external evils were on the moon, it meant that this conclusion was very reasonable. Furthermore, it was very likely that the powerful beings had already discovered something when they went to the moon to investigate, and that was why the mystic Luna realm was created later on?

When Xia ruofei was in the mystic Luna realm, he had a feeling that the mystic Luna realm was selecting talents. The person who set up the mystic Luna realm must be an Almighty.

Could it be a secret realm set up by the few powerful people who went to the moon to investigate?

What did they find?

Why would they set up a secret realm in such a secret place to select talents? According to that method, how many talents could be selected?

Xia ruofei’s mind was filled with thoughts.

“Nephew! My dear nephew!”

Senior copper coffin’s voice woke Xia ruofei from his thoughts. He quickly said,””I’m sorry, uncle – Master Zhao, 1 was a little distracted just now.”

“Did you think of something?” Senior copper coffin asked.

Xia ruofei’s brain was spinning quickly. The existence of the mystic Luna realm seemed to be of great importance, and the selection mechanism was rather strict. Hence, he decided not to reveal it so easily, even to this senior copper coffin.

After all, he had only met Xia ruofei twice and he had only said that immortal mountain river was his old friend. He had to be careful since he did not know the other party well.

Hence, Xia ruofei quickly shook his head and said,””It’s because martial uncle Zhao’s news was too shocking, that’s why this junior was a little dazed!”

Senior copper coffin looked at Xia ruofei. Of course, he knew that Xia ruofei was making an excuse, but he didn’t pursue the matter. He knew that everyone had their own secrets. If Xia ruofei didn’t want to talk about it, there was no point in asking.

Having lived for hundreds of years, this senior had long understood.

Senior copper coffin smiled and continued to transmit his voice,””This news was told to me by Shanhe because he also has to accompany several seniors in the leaving aperture stage to the moon. This is almost an unprecedented feat in the world of cultivation. That kid was very proud of himself at that time and kept showing off in front of me.”

“If that’s the case, the authenticity of this information is very high.” Xia ruofei said. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Senior copper coffin nodded and said,”Shanhe, you don’t have to brag in front of me. This should be true.” Unfortunately, I was soon trapped in this deep underground Palace, and I didn’t know what happened after that. By the way, you said that you’re not a disciple that Shan He personally accepted, but that you’ve only inherited his magic weapon?”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes!” In fact, ever since 1 entered the world of cultivation, I’ve never seen any seniors above the nascent Soul Stage, including my master… By the way, martial uncle Zhao, what was your and my master’s cultivation level at that time?”

Senior copper coffin smiled and said,”Shanhe is stronger than me. However, he is at the late – Stage of the nascent soul realm, while 1 am at the mid – Stage.” In the world of cultivation at that time, our cultivation could only be regarded as the backbone of the force. However, Shanhe was very young. Among the cultivators around his age, the best were only in the middle stage of the nascent soul realm.. He was the only one who had reached the late stage of the nascent soul realm!”
