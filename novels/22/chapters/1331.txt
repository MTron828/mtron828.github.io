Chapter 1332: Supreme delicacy (2)

Translator: 549690339

Jiang Hua also waved his hand in fear and said,”President Xia, I’m flattered! I ... I can pick it up myself!”

Xia ruofei didn’t allow any explanation. He reached out and picked up the plate in front of Jiang Hua. He placed the piece of fish on the plate and then passed the plate back.

He said,”you’re the main reason why the pomfrei breeding business is progressing so smoothly!” What’s the big deal with giving you some food!”

“Thank you, director Xia!” Jiang Hua said with excitement.

Taking care of pomfrets was a very tiring task, mainly because they were too timid. A slight movement could cause all the pomfrets in the pond to turn white. Therefore, Jiang Hua had been very careful and devoted to this work.

Now that his achievements had been recognized by the company’s leaders, Jiang Hua felt a strong sense of achievement.

Of course, the only question now was how the taste of the Yangtze River Pomfret, which was cultivated in an imitation of the wild environment, would be like. Could it be compared to the real wild Chinese perch? What was the difference between the taste and the United States kun fish? All these mysteries would be revealed today.

Thinking of this, Jiang Hua looked at the sparkling white fish on the small plate in front of him, feeling both excited and nervous.

Xia ruofei smiled.”Since everyone is so humble, I won’t serve you one by one. Everyone can take what you need!”

“This is good, this is good!” Tang Wei Ran smiled and said,”President Xia, first!”

After so much preparation, Tang weiran was also full of expectations for the taste of the steamed kun fish.

Xia ruofei didn’t decline. He took the responsibility and picked up a piece of fish near the tail. The scales on this part were finer and the meat was more tender.

“Everyone, don’t stand on ceremony!” Xia ruofei said as he picked up the food,”do it yourself!”

Seeing that Xia ruofei had already started eating, everyone also reached out their chopsticks.

“There’s a plate of ginger vinegar in front of everyone, it tastes better when dipped in it!”Su Yu smiled and reminded them.

Xia ruofei nodded and looked at the small plate in front of him. The meat of the small piece of fish was very delicate. The silver scales on it were very dazzling under the light.

He picked up the fish and dipped it in the ginger vinegar on the seasoning plate. Then, he put the fish in his mouth with anticipation.

The first thing he bit was the gelatinous fish scales. They had completely softened and had a jelly – like texture. His teeth sank in easily. After going through the scales, he came to the meat. Xia ruofei felt that the meat of the Pomfret seemed to be fatter than ordinary fish, but it was not greasy at all. Instead, it had a refreshing feeling.

Xia ruofei chewed on it instinctively. It was as tender as tofu, but there was an indescribable fragrance. All the taste buds seemed to be cheering at the same time.

Fat but not greasy, fragrant in the mouth, these two adjectives were no longer the jack of all trades in food shows, but instead very appropriately expressed the true taste of the pomfrets.

“Delicious!” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but mumble.

Everyone had already started to taste the delicious Chinese perch. For a moment, no one at the table spoke, only the sound of chewing could be heard.

Su Yu’s face seemed to have an expression of pilgrimage, savoring the taste of the pomfrets bit by bit, and his eyes actually became a little moist. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

After eating this piece of fish, Su Yu let out a long sigh.

Xia ruofei’s heart skipped a beat and he asked,”Uncle Su, does it taste wrong?” Is there a difference with the wild Chinese perch?”

He felt that this shouldn’t be possible! His taste had been spoiled by the Taoyuan vegetables, but after tasting the steamed Chinese perch today, he was still shocked. Such a taste should not be worse than the authentic Yangtze River Chinese perch, right?

With a hint of excitement, Su Yu said,”Little Xia, this is the taste of my childhood! It’s been so many years ... I can’t believe I can taste this familiar delicacy again ... No! I feel that today’s steamed Chinese perch is even more delicious than the wild Chinese perch I’ve eaten before!”

The dish that Su Yu praised was made by himself, but no one felt anything strange after listening to it, because this steamed kun fish was really ... Too delicious!

Feng Rao, Jiang Hua, and the others almost swallowed their own tongues. Tang weiran and the others from Tongren Hall didn’t have a good reaction either. The temptation of good food was fixed in human genes. This primitive desire was simply uncontrollable when one encountered a truly delicious food.

As Jiang Hua ate, he heaved a sigh of relief. His last trace of worry had disappeared ...

Xia ruofei smiled.”Perhaps it’s because you haven’t had the Chinese perch for many years. Your anticipation is too strong. That’s why you think it’s especially good this time.”

Su Yu couldn’t wait to pick up another piece of Chinese perch, dip it in ginger vinegar, and put it in his mouth. Then, he nodded and said,”Maybe! However, I haven’t tasted this in a long time ...”

“Uncle Su, how does it compare to the United States perch?” Xia ruofei asked curiously.

Su Yu ate the fish in big mouthfuls, then spat out the Fishbone, and said impatiently,”Little Xia, I’ll put it this way! There was simply no comparison between the two! Compared to this authentic Chang Jiang Chinese perch, the United States Chinese perch is simply a lump of ...”

Speaking of this, Su Yu closed his mouth in time. It was mealtime, so if he said everything without any restraint, it would really affect everyone’s appetite.

After Tang Wei Ran heard this, she didn’t agree with him.

As a senior executive of a state – owned enterprise, there were very few delicacies that he had not tasted. He had eaten a lot of strange game, and it was naturally not the first time he had eaten pomfrets.

However, just as Su Yu said before, because of the environment and over – Fishing, wild Chinese perch had almost become extinct. The Chinese perch that Tang weiran had eaten was actually an artificially cultivated United States Chinese perch. The price of this Chinese perch was also quite high, and ordinary people couldn’t afford to eat it. Tang weiran felt that although the taste of the steamed Chinese perch was obviously better this time, it wasn’t as exaggerated as Su Yu said.

Perhaps this was caused by feelings? Tang weiran thought to herself. However, she didn’t slow down and quickly put the second piece of kun fish into her mouth.

Although Xia ruofei felt that Su Yu’s words were a little heavy, he still grinned happily.

The taste was so good, and the taste was obviously better than the United States pomfrets sold at high prices in the market. It could be confirmed that the breeding of this batch of Yangtze River pomfrets was a great success!

What did this mean? Cash! A huge amount of cash! Moreover, it was a steady stream of money. The beluga in the anglerfish cultivation workshop was delivered in batches. In the future, there would be beluga on the market almost every month.

Xia ruofei still remembered clearly that Ling Xiaotian had obtained two wild Chinese perch. It was these two Chinese perch that had reproduced in the medium space, allowing Xia ruofei to have an endless supply of Chinese perch. Ling Xiaotian had bought these two Chinese perch for 3000 Yuan per 500 grams.

With the current scale of the pomfrets cultivation workshop, it was easy to produce 1000 pomfrets a month. Based on 2000 catties, the pomfrets were generally small, and one catty per fish was more common. Because of the petal solution of the spirit Heart Flower, the pomfrets in Taoyuan farm could basically reach two catties, which could earn them at least six million a month, which was tens of millions a year.

Moreover, the consumption of pomfrets was getting hotter and hotter. The pomfrets cultivated by Taoyuan farm tasted even better than the wild Yangtze River pomfrets. If Su Yu’s memory was correct, the price of the pomfrets might be more than 3000 Yuan, and the income would be even higher.

Thinking of this, Xia ruofei’s mood became even better. He frequently invited everyone to drink and eat.

The small pomfrets were quickly divided and eaten, and everyone had a feeling that they had not had enough.
