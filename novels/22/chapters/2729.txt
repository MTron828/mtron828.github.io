2730 The heavenly network (1)

Xia ruofei went straight to the helipad on the roof. The Super Jaguar was still parked there, but the pilot was no longer on Paradise Island. However, Xia ruofei had received simple helicopter piloting training when he was in the Army. He had also ridden this super Jaguar a few times. With a cultivator’s learning ability, it was not a big problem for him to fly the plane.

Of course, Xia ruofei’s greatest confidence was that even if Yingying had a flight accident, he had the spirit map scroll and was absolutely confident that he could escape. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

As soon as he knew that Luo Qingfeng was likely to come on his flying sword, Xia ruofei immediately decided to survey the island from the sky. Some of the disguises and arrangements that he and Li Yifu had made on the island were almost flawless from the ground. However, the observation angle in the sky was different. If they left any flaws, Luo Qingfeng would immediately be on guard, given his cautious character.

All the staff members on the island had returned to their countries, so they had to do all the work themselves. Xia ruofei unlocked the helicopter’s wheel and entered the cabin. He familiarized himself with the cabin and checked the oil level.

Fortunately, the fuel tank was full, or Xia ruofei would have to personally refuel the helicopter.

After the inspection, Xia ruofei started the engine of the helicopter. The propeller started to spin slowly and the speed became faster and faster. It brought up a strong wind and blew away the dust on the parking lot.

Xia ruofei slowly lifted the helicopter and it rose vertically. He pushed the control lever slightly and the helicopter started to fly forward.

At first, Xia ruofei’s operation was a little rusty. However, he had learned how to pilot a helicopter before. Even if it was a crash course, he was still very familiar with the operating principles. The strong learning ability of a cultivator allowed him to get used to flying very quickly, and his movements when piloting the helicopter became smooth and natural.

After the helicopter took off, Li Yifu and Wang Boshan realized that Xia ruofei had gone to the tarmac on the roof to fly the helicopter. They couldn’t help but break out in cold sweat.

Li Yifu said anxiously,”it’s too risky for grand uncle – Master to do this!” What if we ...”

Li Yifu stopped mid – sentence, perhaps because he felt that his words were a little inauspicious.

Wang Boshan also stood in front of the floor – to – Ceiling window and looked at the helicopter that was climbing. He said,”Mr. Li, since the owner dared to open it, it means that he is confident. You don’t have to worry too much.”

“But as far as I know, grand uncle – Master has never flown a helicopter before!” Li Yifu sighed.

“Master, didn’t you fly a large aircraft to force a landing?” Wang Boshan smiled and said,”the principle should be similar! Besides, master’s cultivation is so high that he can deal with any situation calmly!”

As Xia ruofei’s soul slave, Wang Boshan had a blind admiration for Xia ruofei. In their eyes, their master should be omnipotent.

“I hope so ...” Li Yifu sighed slightly.”Senior granduncle should have brought me along. If something really happens, I can take care of him ...”

He did not know that it would be even more inconvenient for Xia ruofei to bring Li Yifu along. If he were to fly the helicopter alone and the helicopter went out of control, he could just hide in the spirit map space. However, if he brought Li Yifu along, it would mean that the spirit map space’s existence would be exposed. Hence, he would definitely not do that.

After Xia ruofei familiarized himself with the flight controls, he drove the Super Jaguar around Paradise Island. He repeatedly checked the “ancient cultivator ruins” that he and Li Yifu had set up at various altitudes.

Of course, he didn’t dare to fly at a very low altitude, because the helicopter would create a large amount of airflow, which could destroy the traces of the previous arrangement.

Xia ruofei flew the Super Jaguar for more than an hour. He looked left and right a few times and found three or four places that could have been overlooked.

Although these places were not obvious, they were not perfectly disguised. Looking down from the sky, it was hard to notice unless one was already on guard and had been looking very carefully. However, since Xia ruofei had already checked, he would not let go of such an oversight. He would not allow any possibility of an accident to exist.

After making sure that he had checked everything, Xia ruofei then flew the Super Jaguar helicopter back to the landing strip on the roof of the project department building.

The wind on the island was relatively strong, and the airflow was not particularly stable. In addition, the parking area on the roof was actually relatively small, and there was very little room for error. Once the landing operation was not accurate, it was possible to crash the plane.

After all, Xia ruofei was not a professional helicopter pilot. He tried two or three times, but every time he was about to land, he would deviate a lot. So, he would pull it up again and land again.

Li Yifu and Wang Boshan had been waiting on the rooftop for a long time. Seeing this scene, they couldn’t help but worry for Xia ruofei.

Fortunately, Xia ruofei was a cultivator of the ninth level of the Qi refining stage. His learning ability and adaptability were very strong. He quickly mastered the technique of landing accurately when the airflow was turbulent. After a series of complicated and precise micro – Operations, he finally landed the helicopter steadily. He landed right on the “H” parking spot without any deviation.

Xia ruofei turned off the engine and jumped out of the cabin with a smile. Then, he personally closed the lock and walked towards Li Yifu and Wang Boshan.
