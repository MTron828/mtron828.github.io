2654 The old army (2)

The officer on duty jogged a few steps and arrived at the Sentry post.

When he saw Xia ruofei, he was stunned. Then, he gave a warm smile and called out,””Class monitor Xia! Why are you here?”

Xia ruofei took a closer look and a smile appeared on his face. He looked at the military rank on the officer’s shoulder and teased,””It’s class monitor Gao! You’re already a Sergeant, not bad!”

A Sergeant was actually equivalent to a second class Sergeant in the past. Under normal circumstances, one would only be awarded this rank in their fifth year of service.

The sergeant on duty, Gao Yang, quickly waved his hand and said,””Class monitor Xia, you can just call me Xiao Gao! How would I dare to call myself the class monitor in front of you!”

When Gao Yang had just joined the Army, Xia ruofei had been the leader of the new recruits. At that time, Xia ruofei had already been selected as a member of the lone wolf assault team. However, he had suffered a little injury during training and needed to rest for a while. He could not continue with high – intensity military training. The company commander of the newly formed recruit company had asked Guo Zhan for help, saying that they were seriously lacking in the backbone of their troops and hoped to transfer a leader from the assault team to help.

Guo Zhan naturally chose Xia ruofei, who was temporarily unable to train normally, to be the new recruit’s squad leader.

Just like that, Xia ruofei picked up his backpack and went to the recruit company.

Gao Yang’s group of soldiers were actually the only batch of new recruits that Xia ruofei had led after he was transferred to the lone wolf assault team.

It could be said that Gao Yang respected and feared Xia ruofei. Even now, he could not help but subconsciously stand straight when he saw Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei patted Gao Yang’s shoulder and said,””Who dares to say you’re not the class monitor? I think you’re doing it well now! You’re no longer the little Gao who loved to cry in the recruit company!”

Gao Yang didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. He whispered,”Squad leader Xia, save me some face. There are new recruits here!”

“Oh ... Yes, yes, yes!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I shouldn’t have said that you were crying ...”

The Sentry at the Sentry post had a hard time holding back. He gently bit his lower lip, raised his head, puffed out his chest, and stared ahead, trying hard not to laugh out loud.

“Class monitor Xia, you’re here to see the wolf King, right?” Gao Yang quickly changed the topic.

“Yup! Hurry up and help me call the wolf King!” Xia ruofei said.

“What’s the point of reporting your arrival! Let’s just go in directly!” Gao Yang said casually.

“That won’t do. I’m just an ordinary person now!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”let’s follow the rules!”

“Alright then!” Gao Yang said,”please wait a moment, class monitor Xia. I’ll call Wolf King.”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”looks like I’m in luck!” Every one of them is accurate!”

The lone wolf assault team would often be sent to the deep mountains and forests for field training. It was common for them to not return to camp for ten days to half a month. Xia ruofei was indeed very lucky to be able to find Guo Zhan the moment he arrived.

Gao Yang revealed a bitter smile and said,””You’re quite lucky. If you had come a few days later, I’m afraid you wouldn’t have found them ...”

Xia ruofei thought that Gao Yang was referring to the fact that the Army was going to pull him out for training again. This was a common occurrence during Xia ruofei’s service period, so he was not very surprised. He just smiled and said,””Hurry up and help me make the call!” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Yes!” Gao Yang quickly ran to the guard room and used the military line phone there to call Guo Zhan’s office and report to him that Xia ruofei had suddenly arrived.

Guo Zhan immediately ordered Gao Yang to let them pass.

Xia ruofei waited at the door for about a minute or two before Gao Yang jogged over and said,””Squad leader Xia, the wolf King said to let us through immediately! Let me bring you in!”

Xia ruofei did not know whether to laugh or cry,”which part of this place am I not familiar with?” Just tell me where the wolf King is now! I can find it myself. ”

“No, that’s a task assigned by Wolf King himself. I must complete it to the letter!” Gao Yang said, then reached out his hand and made a gesture of invitation.”Class monitor Xia, please!”

Xia ruofei thought about it and did not insist. After all, he was a local citizen now and the lone wolf assault team had a very high level of security. Naturally, they could not let anyone in. According to the rules, this kind of visit had to be held in the reception room next to the guardroom. However, Xia ruofei’s identity was a little special, so there was no need to guard against him like this. However, when walking in the camp, he had to be accompanied by someone. This was also clearly written in the rules.

Xia ruofei and Gao Yang walked side by side into the camp. Gao Yang said as they walked,””Class monitor Xia, Wolf King is in the general office building. He asked me to take you there.”

“Xiao Gao, I’ll have to trouble you to come with me!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

The two of them had not walked far when Xia ruofei saw a few bright red banners hanging on the tree beside the road. The words on the banners were white and the content of each banner was different.

Xia ruofei took a glance and his eyes widened in disbelief.

The slogans on the banners were all similar in content. Some of them were ‘a thousand – mile defense shift’ and ‘it’s time to test our loyalty!’ “The standard of combat power will not be reduced! The style of a soldier is still the same! Your fighting spirit hasn’t decreased!”

Xia ruofei stopped in his tracks. He pointed at the banners and asked,””Xiao Gao, what’s going on? The troops are moving?”

“You can ask the wolf King about the details!” Gao Yang nodded. You came here a few days earlier. If you had come a few days later, this camp would have been set up by new troops. ”

“Why so sudden ...” Xia ruofei mumbled.

The entrance wasn’t too far from the general office building, so it didn’t take long for the two of them to reach it.

Gao Yang stopped and said,”squad leader Xia, Wolf King’s office hasn’t changed. It’s still on the fifth floor.” I can’t be away from the gate guard for too long, so I won’t be able to send you up. ”

“Alright! You’ve worked hard!” Xia ruofei patted Gao Yang’s shoulder and said.

He walked into the comprehensive office building. The building had a total of five floors, so there was no elevator. He climbed up the stairs briskly and soon arrived on the fifth floor.

Xia ruofei was very familiar with the place. He turned right as soon as he got out of the staircase and walked to the end of the corridor. He stopped in front of the last office, knocked on the door, and called out,””Report!”

There was no sound from the room, but the office door suddenly opened. Guo Zhan stood at the door and sized Xia ruofei up. Then, he grinned and said,””Not bad! Not bad! Looking at his body, he shouldn’t have lost his Kung Fu!”

Xia ruofei also grinned.

Then, the two of them each took a step forward and gave each other a big hug.

“Come in!” Guo Zhan let go of Xia ruofei, turned around, and walked into the office.”It’s a bit messy in the room. Find a place to sit!”

Xia ruofei looked around Guo Zhan’s office. It was not as clean and tidy as before. A few cardboard boxes were placed on the desk. Some documents and personal belongings had not been put into the boxes in time and were scattered on the desk, looking a little messy.

Xia ruofei took another look at Guo Zhan and realized that he had not shaved his beard. His hair was a little long and his eyes were bloodshot. It was obvious that he was not in a good mental state recently.

“Wolf King, it seems like ... I came at the wrong time?” Xia ruofei said.

Guo Zhan grinned and gave Xia ruofei a heavy punch on the shoulder.””What nonsense are you saying! This is your home. You’re welcome to come here anytime ...”

Speaking of this, Guo Zhan couldn’t help but reveal a sad expression and said,”But ... I’m afraid ...”

“I saw it in the camp just now. The troops ... Are they moving?” Xia ruofei asked and then immediately added,”if it’s not convenient to tell you, then forget it!”

Guo Zhan waved his hand and said,”there’s nothing inconvenient about it. The order to move the defense has been issued. This time, it’s not just moving the defense. The strength composition and structure of the entire Army will have to undergo a major adjustment. Our lone wolf is no exception ...”
