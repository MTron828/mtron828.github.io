2593 The ridiculous truth (3)

Liu Lifang quickly nodded her head. Then, a strange expression appeared on her face. Her eyes were a little confused as she said,”After I went back that day, I suddenly realized that the allergic rhinitis that often flared up during that period of time seemed to have suddenly improved a lot. In the past, no matter how much I took medicine during this season, this allergic rhinitis had never been cured. This time, I didn’t sneeze the entire night ... I thought about it, and I couldn’t find any other reason except for touching the pill during the day. ”

“So you came here again the next day and found an opportunity to touch every pill?” Liu Qunfeng asked coldly.

This was the first time Liu Lifang had seen her big brother speak to her in such a tone. She felt a sense of unfamiliarity and fear at the same time.

She dodged his gaze and nodded, saying,””I just wanted to verify my guess. At the same time, it was also because the pill I touched the day before didn’t cause any harm to dad, so I found an excuse to send the guards away. Then, I touched every pill, wrapped it up again, and put it back ...” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

At this point, Liu Lifang said in a hurry,””Big brother, I really didn’t collude with any outsiders. If I lied just now, I’ll die a horrible death! I ... I just touched the pill. I really didn’t think there would be such serious consequences!”

Liu Qunfeng was a little uncertain. They had been brother and sister for so many years, so he knew Liu Lifang quite well. He knew that his sister was a little bit like a rich man, a little mean, and a little short – sighted, but he didn’t believe that she would be so vicious as to kill his own father.

However, if what Liu Lifang said was true, then this matter was too strange ...

Just as Liu Qunfeng was hesitating, Liu Liru said coldly,””Little sister! You’d better not make such a serious oath! What if it’s effective?”

“What do you mean by that? You’re still suspecting me of lying?” Liu Lifang questioned with reddened eyes.

Liu Liru laughed in disdain and said,”You should’ve made up a more reasonable story. You can make the effect of the medicine disappear just by touching it ... Do you think this is a fairy tale?”

“But that’s the truth!” Liu Lifang said hurriedly,”I didn’t do anything else other than touching these pills! I even suspect that I’m just unlucky to have encountered this. In fact, the medicine should have lost its effectiveness! Who knew what that Xia guy was up to? He has had many conflicts with us, the Liu family!”

At this moment, a teasing voice came from the door,””So you’re saying that you’re going to throw this big black pot on me?”

Everyone turned around and realized that Xia ruofei had come out from the room next door. He was standing at the door and looking at Liu Lifang with interest.

“Mr. Xia!” Liu Qunfeng quickly stepped forward and said with a bitter smile,”I’m sorry ...”

Xia ruofei smiled faintly. He looked around and finally stopped at Liu Lifang. He said,”Secretary Liu, it’s not that bad, but ... Your sister’s way of thinking is a little different from ordinary people!”
