However, Xia ruofei still decided to customize an anti – Theft device. The biggest purpose was to hide it from people. Otherwise, it would be strange for such a precious jade carving to be placed there without any defense.

On the other hand, Xia ruofei was trying to avoid trouble. Even for those who didn’t understand Feng Shui, this jade carving was an extremely valuable collection just from the quality of the Jade. If they didn’t put some protective measures in place, it might really attract people to take a risk.

After talking about the Feng Shui issue, Xia ruofei asked again,””Uncle Xu, when do you think we should move?”

In fact, after looking at both venues, Xu lang had already made a judgment in his heart. Hence, after Xia ruofei asked, he smiled and said,””The most suitable date is in three days. Of course, if you don’t have time to prepare, seven days is also quite good ...”

Hearing this, Xia ruofei turned to Dong Yun and asked,””Director Dong, is three days enough?”

“No problem!” Dong Yun said without hesitation.

“OK! Then we’ll move in three days!” Xia ruofei said.

Xu lang smiled and reminded him,””Mr. Xia, the best time to move is three days later at 11:23 PM.”

Xia ruofei jotted down the time and asked,””Uncle Xu, how do you define the time?”

Xu lang thought for a while and asked,”there should be a ceremony to settle in, right?” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei was not sure about the specific arrangements, so he looked at Dong Yun.

“Yes!” Dong Yun immediately replied. Uncle Xu, we’ll hold a small ceremony on the day of the relocation. Also, the building has been renamed to the peach blossom building. We’ll hang a plaque at the main entrance of the first floor and cut the ribbon for the opening ceremony. ”

Xu lang immediately said,”then let’s set the time for the reveal to be 11:23!” Remember, don’t move anything into the building before the opening ceremony. You can only move after the opening ceremony!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”okay!” Many thanks for uncle Xu’s guidance!”

“You’re welcome, Mr. Xia!”Xu lang smiled and waved his hand. I’ve said on many occasions that Feng Shui is only an auxiliary, especially man – made arrangements like the layout of houses. It can only make limited improvements. Even natural Feng Shui is also an auxiliary function. The real function is still the person himself. As long as he takes the right path and grows his fortune, success is only a matter of time!”

Xia ruofei could not help but be in awe. This was not the first time he had heard of Xu Lang’s point of view. Last time in the capital, Zhao Yongjun had told him about this idea that Xu lang often talked about.

Xu lang was a Feng Shui Master! Other Feng Shui masters could not wait to exaggerate the effect of Feng Shui by a hundred or a thousand times, because only in this way could they highlight their importance and gain more benefits. However, Xu lang had always emphasized the importance of being a human and called on everyone to walk the right path and cultivate good fortune, which was quite valuable.

Xu lang continued,”so, Mr. Xia, you don’t have to care too much about the auspicious date and time I mentioned, or the layout of the office. These are just minor details.” Not long ago, Mr. Xia had saved hundreds of lives on a plane, and the heart – nourishing soup that had been launched earlier was a blessing for people with autism. It could be said that his merit was boundless. As long as you operate it normally, you will definitely succeed!”

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”uncle Xu, you’re too kind. I’m just following my heart.” Besides, it’s a rare opportunity for someone of your authority to personally guide you! We will definitely follow your instructions to the letter! After all, no one would complain about the Fengshui of their office building being too good, right?”

Xu lang couldn’t help but laugh when he heard this.”That makes sense!”

Xu Lang’s mission was considered complete after he helped Xia ruofei improve the Feng Shui situation of the building and confirmed the auspicious date and time.

In the afternoon, Xia ruofei hosted Xu lang at Ling Ji private kitchen again.

Initially, he had invited Xu lang to stay at Sanshan for a few days, but Xu Lang’s schedule was too tight. In fact, Xu lang had pushed aside his schedule to come to the Inland Egret Island and Sanshan. He just didn’t tell Xia ruofei. Therefore, Xu lang and his assistant, a ‘Yuan, were ready to take the evening flight back to Hong Kong.

In this way, the lunch at noon was not only a thank – you meal, but also a farewell party.

Xia ruofei had prepared many of Sanshan’s specialties. Of course, the signature dish Buddha Jumps Over the Wall was also a must.

In terms of wine, Xia ruofei brought out the newly brewed half – Lon. Although sai Meirong was not as precious as the noble rot wine, the taste was also quite unique. Moreover, the white wine brewed in the spirit map space had an obvious taste advantage over the ordinary half – Lon. Xu lang was also amazed after drinking it.

After lunch, Xia ruofei accompanied Xu lang on a simple tour of the nearby San Fang Qi Street. They went to places of interest that were further away, such as Gu Ling. Xu lang did not have time to visit them.

At threeo’ clock, Xia ruofei personally drove Xu lang and his assistant, ah Yuan, to the airport.

The plane tickets were naturally booked by the Tao Yuan company a day in advance, and they bought two first – Class tickets.

When the car arrived at the airport, the assistant, ah Yuan, moved their luggage out of the car before Xia ruofei could.

Xia ruofei smiled at Xu lang and said,””Uncle Xu, thank you so much for this! We’ll have to trouble you to look after our clubhouse in the capital. ”

“Mr. Xia, we’re friends. You don’t have to be so polite!” Xu lang said with a smile.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”yes, yes, yes!” We’re friends!”

Xia ruofei continued,”uncle Xu, I know that you won’t be willing to accept it if I were to pay you. So ... I’ve prepared a small gift. Just treat it as a gift for your visit to the three mountains.” Please don’t refuse!”

Xu lang smiled and said,”Oh?” A gift prepared by Mr. Xia himself? Then I’ll treasure it well!”

Xia ruofei smiled, walked to the back of the car, and opened the trunk.

He first took out a paper bag and handed it to his assistant, a ‘Yuan. Then, he said to Xu lang,””Uncle Xu, here are two bottles of expensive rotten wine, the kind we had yesterday ...”

Xu Lang’s eyes lit up and he said,”This gift is good! Mr. Xia really knows me! Hahaha! Then I won’t be polite ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”don’t rush!” There are other gifts!”

“There’s more?”Xu lang was stunned.

Xia ruofei then opened the refrigerator in the car and took out a long vacuum – packed bag.””Here are two wild Chinese perch. They’re also our company’s products. These are live fish frozen and cooked after thawing. The taste is not much different from fresh wild Chinese perch. The taste is not bad. Uncle Xu, take them back and try them!”

Xu lang laughed and said,”Mr. Xia, I know this!” I’ve tasted it once at Mr. Ma’s place, and the ancients didn’t lie to me! The delicious pomfrets should only exist in the heavens!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but smile.”So uncle Xu has already tried it. Then I won’t use too much. It’s just that ...” He said.

Due to the limited production, MA Xiong’s Hengfeng group was the only store in Hong Kong that sold a small amount of frozen Wild Pacific pomfrets other than a few channels in the mainland. Moreover, it had not been long since it was put on sale. Xia ruofei did not expect Xu lang to have already tried it. It seemed like he was on good terms with MA Xiong.

“This is good stuff! “It’s just not easy to transport ...”Xu lang said with some difficulty.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”uncle Xu, don’t worry. I’ve already prepared a thermal lunch box. There’s even ice in it. It won’t be a problem for us to make it to Hong Kong!” The airport only needs to handle the shipping of fresh food, it’s very convenient!”

“That’s great!”Xu lang said happily. That’s good!”

Xia ruofei placed the Chinese perch into the insulated box that he had prepared in advance.

“A ‘Yuan, come over and take this thermal lunch box!” Xu lang called out. Let’s get ready to go in!”

Xia ruofei quickly said,”uncle Xu, please wait!” I’m not done with my gifts yet!”

Xu lang was stunned. He did not know whether to laugh or cry as he asked,”Mr. Xia, how many gifts have you prepared? In fact, these are already precious enough. If it wasn’t for the fact that I can’t resist the temptation of delicious food, I would be too embarrassed to accept these two gifts ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”there’s one last item ...”

With that, Xia ruofei opened the car’s refrigerator again and took out another vacuum – packed item. It was the size of two adult palms.

When Xu lang saw the item in Xia ruofei’s hand, he could not help but widen his eyes and could not look away ...
