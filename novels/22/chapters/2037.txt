2038 Returning to the country (2)

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I don’t think you want the truffle family, which has been passed down for so long, to fall from grace.” Besides, if you go back, you can help people like uncle muntley and give them a better stage to show off. “Of course, I will respect any decision you make. If you are not willing to return, I will send someone to speak to that Calas. Even if you want to continue to squeeze the living space of the Grasso family, there will be no problem!”

At this moment, a voice came from behind them,””Monica! Let’s go back!”

Monica turned around and saw that Rousey had already arrived behind them.

Monica quickly walked over and said,””Rousey, what are you doing here? The wind is strong outside ...”

“Monica, I heard everything Mr. Xia said to you just now.” Rousey said,”I know what you’re hesitating about! But I can tell you that I also want you to return to the family ...”

“But they did that to you ...” Monica frowned.

Obviously, what she cared more about was that the family had once used Rossi as a bargaining chip to make Monica hesitate and not even dare to escape. She was still brooding over this matter.

“Only by going back to take control of the family can we make those who have treated us badly pay the price!” Rousey said with a smile. Only when you go back will the clan be our clan, isn’t it?”

Xia ruofei stepped aside with a smile after Rossi appeared, letting the siblings make their own decision.

Monica fell into deep thought after hearing Rossi’s words. After a long while, she raised her head and said to Xia ruofei,””Mr. Xia, I’ve decided to listen to your suggestion and return to my family!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”“OK! I’ll get them to make the arrangements as soon as possible!”

……

Two days later, Xia ruofei and lui hai came to the Grasso family with Monica and her brother.

Along with him was the heavily bandaged klass.

He had many fractures on his body, so it was naturally impossible for him to be discharged so soon. However, when he found out that Monica had decided to return to the family today, he still struggled to get people to carry him back.

Many of the members of the Grao family had their own houses in Turin, but most of the direct descendants lived in a small Manor in the southern suburbs of Turin.

Some time ago, after the Moore family, which had just found a backer, was swallowed up by the Gehrman family, the members of the Grao family had always been in a state of panic. The events that had happened in the past few days had made the small number of people who had suppressed Monica and Rossi in various ways, or who had helped the evildoers, feel even more uneasy.

Today, Monica, accompanied by the people of the Italy Hong sect, returned to the family with the attitude of a King. Everyone looked at her with a complicated expression.

Karlas announced on the spot that Monica would take over the position of the head of the Grasso family from today.

No one was surprised. The winner was the king and the loser was the bandit. This was an eternal truth.

Since Monica had already made up her mind, she naturally wouldn’t decline. She took the sapphire ring that symbolized the clan leader’s power from Calas’s hand.

Then, she took out a piece of paper and announced a series of personnel changes in the family.

The faction led by Calas was stripped of all their positions without exception. They were temporarily left to work at the most basic level in the family to see what would happen next.

Of course, Monica did not kick them out directly not because she was merciful. In fact, it was Xia ruofei’s suggestion to keep them in the family so that she could slowly investigate. Once she found out that they had embezzled money from the family’s company, Monica would definitely not be soft – hearted and deal with them.

With the threat of the Hong sect, these people didn’t even have the thought of running away. They could only helplessly accept Monica’s arrangement.

When some people left the core, there would naturally be others who reentered the decision – making circle. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Like the monteri couple that Monica had mentioned, she had entrusted them with important tasks. As Monica’s assistant, Monti was in charge of many businesses that were originally firmly controlled by Calas and the others. His wife, Jessica, was also in an important position and was in charge of the family’s internal affairs.

There were also some capable clansmen who had sympathized with Monica and her brother’s experience and were promoted.

Xia ruofei and the others were there to support Monica. They did not express any opinions throughout the entire process. Just by standing there, they were already the biggest deterrence to them.

Monica arranged everything in an orderly manner.

The family’s business had almost been cut off during this period of time, and it could be said that there were many things to be done now.

Previously, she might have harbored some resentment in her heart, but after she got busy, she had forgotten about it. She just felt very fulfilled.

Xia ruofei waited for Monica to finish her business before walking over. He smiled and said,””Monica! You’ve made the right decision! Look! Now you’re glowing!”

Monica said, a little embarrassed,””It’s all thanks to your help! Thank you!”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”you don’t have to be so polite ... Since you’re fine here, we’ll go back!” Ah Yong and Ah Hua will stay to help you. If there are any blind people who dare to go against you, tell them ...”

When the members of the Grasso family saw the two burly men who represented the underground Kings of Turin, they couldn’t help but tremble.

Monica said gratefully,”thanks!” Xia, I’ll make arrangements for the two brothers from the Hong sect! Thank you!”

“Goodbye!” Xia ruofei said,”by the way, I might be returning to my country in two days. I hope that the next time we meet, you’ll have already brought the Grasso family to greater heights!”

“Are you going back?” Monica’s heart trembled for some reason.”Which day are you flying? I’ll go to the airport to send you off!”

“No need!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”in Chinese words, we’ll meet again if we’re fated!”

After saying that, Xia ruofei waved to Monica and walked out of the door with lui hai and the others.

Monica looked at Xia ruofei’s back as he walked further and further away. She felt an inexplicable sense of reluctance.

When she was with Xia ruofei, she always had a strange feeling. It was as if the two of them were very familiar, but this familiar feeling would suddenly disappear.

I can’t possibly have a good impression of him, right? It was impossible! ‘I already have someone for Xia Xin. It’s impossible for me to accommodate other men ...’ Monica said in her heart.

This ‘Xia’ was not the ‘Xia Tian’ after the disguise. It was the Xia ruofei in Monica’s mind.

Thinking of Xia ruofei, Monica couldn’t help but mock him. Could this Xia guy have forgotten about me? They hadn’t been in contact for so long, and he didn’t reply to the email she sent him last time ...

After a long while, Monica finally managed to calm down her complicated feelings. She continued to lead Montery and the others to discuss the next step of the family’s development plan.

……

The next day, Xia ruofei boarded a flight to Huaxia.

After more than ten hours of flight, Xia ruofei had returned to the capital of Huaxia.

He didn’t inform anyone about his return from Italy. After leaving the Beijing International Airport, he took a taxi to a busy shopping mall in the city and found a bathroom to restore his original appearance.

Then, he changed his clothes and put away his phone, watch, clothes, passport, and other things that he had used during his stay in Italy. He walked out of the bathroom, hailed a taxi at the entrance of the mall, and went straight to his courtyard house.

In the car, Xia ruofei turned on his phone. During his time in Italy his original mobile phone had been turned off, mainly to prevent being located in Italy.

As soon as he turned on his phone, he received an email notification.

He opened it and saw that it was from Monica a few days ago. After reading the contents, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel a little dazed ...
