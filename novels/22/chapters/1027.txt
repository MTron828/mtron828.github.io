Chapter 1028: Jaded skin cream mass production trial (1)

Translator: 549690339

After the call went through, Xia ruofei did not beat around the bush and went straight to the point.

If it was someone else, they would have to worry about whether the other party would be unhappy because it would seem like they didn’t trust them. However, Xia ruofei didn’t have to worry about MA Xiong.

Of course, Xia ruofei still explained a little.

MA Xiong couldn’t help but laugh when he heard that. He couldn’t help but tease Xia ruofei about how the CEO of the Tao Yuan company was a beauty. MA Xiong knew that too.

Xia ruofei could only smile bitterly. However, he finally managed to get the contact information of the person in charge of this matter from Hengfeng.

MA Xiong had placed a lot of importance on Xia ruofei’s matter. He had directly appointed the General Manager of Hengfeng auction house to be in charge of it. He had to personally check on the flow, plan, and design of the auction house.

The manager of Hengfeng auction house was named Dong Jiajun. He was forty – five years old and had been MA Xiong’s subordinate for many years. He was in charge of the Hengfeng auction house’s business.

MA Xiong gave Xia ruofei Dong Jiajun’s contact information and said that he would inform Dong Jiajun immediately so that Feng Jing could contact him at any time.

After Xia ruofei expressed his gratitude, both parties chatted for a while about the auction before hanging up.

Xia ruofei saved Dong Jiajun’s phone number and email but didn’t give it to Feng Jing immediately. He knew Feng Jing’s style. If he got Dong Jiajun’s contact information now, this Beautiful CEO would definitely contact Dong Jiajun immediately and discuss the matter.

It wasn’t good to disturb other people’s rest at noon.

Hence, after Xia ruofei saved the information, he placed his phone on the bedside table and took out the spirit map scroll from his palm. With a thought, he entered the medium.

The space was naturally a scene of prosperity.

Ever since he had Xia Qing’s help, everything in the space had been taken care of in an orderly manner. Furthermore, Xia Qing didn’t need to rest or eat. In addition, time flowed 30 times faster in the Archean realm. Some of the more time – consuming work could be completed in the Archean realm, so the efficiency was especially high.

Whether it was the aureum, Dahongpao tea trees, wild ginseng, top – grade Red Arowana, or the herb garden, tea garden, Dendrobium candids, Cordyceps, succulent seedlings, Hornets, or even the Chinese perch and abalones in the space ocean, they all flourished under Xia Qing’s care.

Everything in the realm was growing and expanding according to Xia ruofei’s plan.

Xia ruofei stood in front of the mountain sea realm’s herb garden and looked at everything in front of him. The rich spiritual energy made him feel relaxed and happy. There was even a faint fishy smell in the air that came from the distant space sea. He could not help but feel an endless sense of accomplishment.

With the spirit map space in his hands, Xia ruofei felt very confident.

This place was his Foundation. Even if the Paradise company was gone, even if he became penniless again, he could still live a very comfortable life with the spirit map space.

Xia Qing was busy cutting succulent plants. Xia ruofei had told him to speed up the progress of this work in the near future. The company’s flagship store in heavenly cat was about to open. When the time came, the succulent seedlings of paradise would be on sale again, and there would be a huge demand for them.

Seeing Xia ruofei enter the medium, Xia Qing immediately stopped what she was doing and ran over to greet Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. After encouraging him, he said,””Xia Qing, put aside your work for now. I have another matter for you to handle!”

“Master, please give your orders!” Xia Qing quickly said.

“Let’s go to the Archean realm!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

With a flash, the two of them disappeared from the mountain and sea realm, and arrived at the Archean realm where time flowed 30 times faster.

Xia ruofei told Xia Qing about his intention for coming here. Xia ruofei had given Xia Qing time to think about the production process of the Jade skin cream, but he had not been too eager to rush her. Now that Feng Jing had mentioned this several times, Xia ruofei felt that it was better to focus on the production process first, so that he wouldn’t feel guilty every time he saw Feng Jing.

Xia Qing had always carried out Xia ruofei’s orders to the letter.

But the most important thing was that Xia Qing was only a spiritual puppet. The knowledge she had was fixed. Although she had a certain learning ability, her knowledge was limited.

Xia Qing had never even heard of the flow of a modern production line. It would be impossible for him to do the so – called mass production work.

So, when Xia Qing lowered her head and told Xia ruofei that she had not made any progress, Xia ruofei only smiled and patted his shoulder to show his understanding.

Xia ruofei said,”it’s okay. We’ll study it together today. You’re more familiar with the process of brewing the jaded skin ointment. You’ll be the main operator. I’ll be in charge of testing and recording!” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing said immediately.

They got to work immediately. The master and servant came to the large wooden shelf placed in the middle of the Archean realm. This was where Xia ruofei stored the Chinese medicine. There were a lot of them. They were mainly used to concoct the pregnant spirit soup, body tempering soup, and jaded skin ointment.

Xia Qing started to pick the herbs skillfully. Xia ruofei also took out a laptop and opened a document. He first entered the amount of the required herbs, the proportion, and the steps of the herbs ‘pre – treatment into the document.
