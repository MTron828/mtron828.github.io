Xia ruofei continued,”thirdly, please prepare a room for me. I’ll be staying here tonight.” I’ll give you another round of acupuncture in the evening, and I’ll come back every three days. The first course of treatment will take about 15 days, and I believe your condition will be completely stabilized by then. ”

Hearing this, old man Liu was overjoyed and said,””It’s great that Mr. Xia can stay. I’ve always wanted to show my gratitude as a good host!”

In fact, old master Liu was more uncertain, especially when Xia ruofei asked him to stop taking the other drugs today. His heart was beating like a drum. After all, the bone – piercing pain was terrifying just thinking about it.

Although Xia ruofei’s treatment was effective immediately, old master Liu was still worried. Now that Xia ruofei was willing to stay, his worries were mostly gone. Even if there were any changes to his condition, Xia ruofei would be able to deal with it immediately.

Xia ruofei smiled.”You’re welcome. I’m not treating you for free. My fees are not cheap.”

“Life is priceless!” Old man Liu laughed. I believe that if Mr. Xia is willing to disclose your medical skills, even if the consultation fee is several times more expensive, there will be a lot of rich people lining up to see you!”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,””Forget it! I’m especially lazy, and I’m especially afraid of trouble! As long as you have enough money to spend, it’s fine. No matter how much you earn, isn’t it just a pile of numbers?”

In fact, as the company grew, Xia ruofei’s feelings for her grew stronger.

With his personality, it was enough for him to achieve financial freedom. He did not have much motivation to continue making money. However, the Paradise Corporation was no longer just his company. The company’s development was also related to the livelihood of hundreds of employees, and behind these hundreds of employees were hundreds of families!

This was also the reason why Xia ruofei had chosen the Liu family’s Pharmaceutical Group. He had enough money to spend, and he might not even be able to finish it in a few lifetimes. However, with this Pharmaceutical Group, the company could develop faster.

Old master Liu chuckled,”Mr. Xia sure is carefree!” I’m ashamed of my inferiority in this regard!”

Old man Liu could clearly feel that his body was much more relaxed now. His desire to live was also burning. The most obvious reaction was that his complexion had improved a lot all of a sudden. His mood was suddenly as bright as the clouds and the sun.

“Elder Liu, you should rest for a while!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”by the way, take this pill every morning and night. Don’t take too many of them or it will backfire.”

In fact, even if old man Liu ate all 30 pills in one go, there wouldn’t be any problem, because the main effect was the small amount of spirit Heart Flower petals in the pills. These spirit Heart Flower petals were only equivalent to one – tenth of a petal, so there was no problem at all if he took them all at once.

However, Xia ruofei had hoped to slow down the pace of the treatment. His guiding principle was to stabilize the patient’s condition. Naturally, he was not willing to let elder Liu take all the pills in one go.

Actually, even if Xia ruofei had not reminded him, old man Liu would not have dared to do so. He would have definitely asked about the dosage. After all, from a traditional point of view, all medicine was partially poisonous. When it came to taking medicine, it was natural to follow the doctor’s advice.

“I’ll remember that. ” Old master Liu laughed and said,”Mr. Xia, let Qunfeng accompany you to shop! I’ll tell him to make the arrangements. ”

Xia ruofei nodded with a smile. Old man Liu gently pressed the alarm on the bed. Everything here was set up according to the hospital’s model. The medical equipment in this room was more complete than the senior cadres ‘Ward in the hospital.

Soon, a medical staff knocked on the door and pushed it open.

“Xiao Zhu, help me call QUN FENG over.” Old man Liu said indifferently.

The nurse in the pink lab coat looked at Xia ruofei curiously before she quickly replied,””Yes, chief!”

Liu Qunfeng had been waiting outside the door, and he soon knocked on the door and walked in.

He first nodded at Xia ruofei to show his respect, then turned to look at old man Liu and asked,””Dad, you were looking for me?”

Old man Liu nodded slightly and said,””Send someone to clean up the room next door immediately. Mr. Xia will be staying here tonight.”

When Liu Qunfeng entered the room, he noticed that his father’s complexion had improved. His face was a lot rosier, and he looked completely different from the haggard man he had looked this morning. He was both surprised and happy. He did not expect Xia ruofei’s treatment to be so effective. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Now that he heard that Xia ruofei would be staying the night, he was overjoyed and quickly said,””Alright! Alright! I’ll make the arrangements immediately. ”

Liu Qunfeng and old master Liu had similar thoughts. As long as Xia ruofei was here, they would feel more at ease.

If it was not for Xia ruofei’s special status, the Liu family would have tied him up here and made him stay by elder Liu’s side.

Xia ruofei said a few words and told elder Liu to rest. Then, he left the room with Liu Qunfeng.

Liu Qunfeng arranged for people to tidy up the guest room next to old master Liu ‘S. Xia ruofei found Wu Qiang and asked him to drive back first. He also told him to come and pick him up tomorrow morning.
