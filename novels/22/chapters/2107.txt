2108 Happily decided_2

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”no need. He’s uncle Ling’s friend. Why wouldn’t I trust him?” I’ll just call him today. ”

Xia ruofei could also tell that uncle Jiang was in urgent need of money. Otherwise, he would not have waited so long.

Since he had already decided to buy it, why not call them a day earlier?

As for the safety of the funds, on the one hand, the money was not a big amount to him. If there was a problem, he could afford to lose it. Moreover, if uncle Jiang really wanted to play any tricks, a cultivator had more means than a Guarantee Company, so he was not afraid of losing money. On the other hand, Ling Xiaotian was the best guarantee. If anything were to go wrong with the deal, Ling Xiaotian would be the first to disagree.

Hence, Xia ruofei did not have any concerns.

“That’s great! Uncle Jiang is waiting for the money!”Ling Qingxue said happily. I’ll call my dad now and ask him to get uncle Jiang’s account number. ”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.

After a while, Ling Xiaotian sent over uncle Jiang’s bank account number.

The three of them had just arrived at the Ling family’s Villa. After Xia ruofei received the account information from Ling Qingxue via WeChat, he smiled and said,””Just in time, let’s go to the bank to transfer the money!”

“Ruofei, I’ll transfer the 10 million to you first!” Feng Rao quickly said.

Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand.”There’s no hurry. We’ll talk about it when I’m free. I still have enough money in my account. Transfer the house money to me first.” Let’s go! Get in the car!”

Xia ruofei brought Ling Qingxue and Feng Jing to the nearby ICBC branch and immediately transferred the 49 million Yuan to the bank.

When the house was transferred, some taxes and handling fees would be generated. According to the usual practice, the buyer would pay for it. The price of the house now was the actual amount of money earned by the seller. All the fees that both parties had to pay would be borne by the buyer. This was also the rule of the industry.

Compared to the tens of millions of house purchases, these taxes were nothing.

Feng Rao went to the bank with him, but she still insisted on transferring the 10 million to Xia ruofei on the spot.

After everything was settled, Ling Qingxue made a copy of the transfer receipt at the bank and asked Xia ruofei to send her back to work. At the same time, she would fax the proof of transfer to uncle Jiang in Egret Island.

After sending Ling Qingxue off, Xia ruofei drove Feng Jing back to Paradise building.

“Thank you, ruofei!” Feng Jing said on the way.

“Sister ran, since when have you treated me like an outsider?” Xia ruofei said nonchalantly.

“That’s a few million!” Feng Rao said with a smile.

“If I didn’t make my own decision, you wouldn’t have spent this money, right?” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”sister che, the real estate market has not been doing well recently. If the price falls, don’t blame me!”

Feng Rao glared at Xia ruofei and said,””If I don’t blame you, who else should I blame? He actually made the decision for me for a house that’s worth more than 10 million. I’m telling you, when I heard the price, my heart was so scared that it was pounding!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”no way?” You’re the CEO of our paradise Corporation! A house that’s worth more than 10 million scared you like this? That was too exaggerated! Sister che, as long as you continue to work hard in the company, let alone ten million, a hundred million or even one billion Yuan of your shares will be nothing!”

“I believe you ...” Feng Jing smiled.”It seems like I’ll have to sell my life to you from now on. Not only are you my boss, but you’re also my creditor ...”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.”Sister ran, you’re making me sound like Huang Shiren ...”

“Who says you’re not?” Feng Rao pouted.”At least a Zhou! No, it’s Xia bapi ...”

As Feng Rao spoke, she couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

The two of them chatted and laughed as they returned to the office. Xia ruofei had been coming to the office a lot recently, so he did not have much work to do. However, he came back with Feng Jing today and it was not appropriate for him to leave immediately, so he returned to his own office.

He had just sat down for a while when Lei Hu knocked on the door and walked in.

“Brother Xia!” Lei Hu greeted him,”the brother on duty at the parking lot just said that you came to the company, so I came to take a look.”

“What’s up?”Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.

Lei Hu said,”it’s nothing big. I just wanted to report to you that Xu Yougang and the others have already taken this morning’s flight to Australia. As per your instructions, I sent them off at the airport on your behalf. I also called President Liang in Australia. President Liang sent someone to pick them up and arranged their accommodation.”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei asked,”Oh right, did old Xu’s family go over together?”

“Not yet,” Lei Hu said,”Xu You has just discussed with his family. He will go over to work for a while and bring his family over after everything has settled down.”

“Then we’ll do as he says!” Xia ruofei said,”Hu Zi, you have to keep in touch with them. They’re under the jurisdiction of the security Department and are considered field work. In the past, our Army was like people carrying out missions outside. The organization has to pay attention to them. If they have any difficulties, you have to try your best to help them solve them. If you can’t solve them, report to me immediately!”

“Yes!” Lei Hu said,”brother Xia, don’t worry! Xu Yougang and the others are my brothers, and you’ve already arranged everything. They won’t suffer in Australia. ”

Xia ruofei nodded.

“Brother Xia, if there’s nothing else, I’ll go down first!” Lei Hu said.

“Alright!” Xia ruofei nodded and immediately called out,”wait ...”

Lei Hu had been walking out, but he stopped when he heard this. He turned around and asked,”Brother Xia, do you have any other orders?”

Xia ruofei pulled open the drawer of his desk, took out two packs of cigarettes and threw them over. Lei Hu quickly reached out to catch them.

Xia ruofei said,”take it and let your brothers have a taste. I don’t have many cigarettes. Don’t keep them for yourself!”

The cigarettes that Xia ruofei gave Lei Hu were specially supplied by elder song.

Lei Hu glanced at the White cigarette box and his eyes lit up,”Woof! This was good stuff! Thank you, brother Xia!”

“I didn’t know that you’re such a knowledgeable person!” Xia ruofei laughed.

Lei Hu chuckled.”Brother Xia, when we were in the Army, we once worked as security guards for a Big Chief. The chief gave me a cigarette. I can recognize this cigarette box at a glance!”

“No wonder ...” Xia ruofei said,”Alright, alright, take the cigarettes and leave!” Remember ... Don’t take it all for yourself!”

“I know, brother Xia!” Lei Hu said happily. He carefully put the two boxes of cigarettes into his pocket and said,”thank you, brother Xia! I’m leaving!”

After Lei Hu left, Xia ruofei opened the thin stack of documents that the administrative office had sent over. They were all daily documents, reports, and the like. With his current level of spiritual power, he could basically memorize them with a glance, so naturally, he handled them very quickly.

After settling the documents, Xia ruofei made some tea in his office. Seeing that it was almost time to get off work, he immediately packed his things, picked up his bag and car keys, and left the office.

Xia ruofei drove straight back to the small villa in Taoyuan farm. After jumping off the car, he did not care about playing with Blackie and the rest who ran over and wagged their tails at him. He immediately walked into the house and rushed to the master bedroom upstairs.

It was because when he was driving on the road, Xia Qing in the space had sent him a message through spiritual power, telling him that the five Strasburg geese for the experiment had been raised to the point where they could be slaughtered.

Xia ruofei couldn’t wait to see if the prescription he had come up with would work. He locked the door and windows as soon as he entered the bedroom. Then, he took out the spiritual map and entered the medium.

Xia ruofei didn’t go directly to the Archean realm. Instead, he chose to appear in front of the mountain sea realm’s cave and used his spiritual power to send a message.”Xia Qing, bring the five geese over.”
