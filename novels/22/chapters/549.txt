Chapter 550: Top – grade fresh bars (2)

President Lin thought that this kind of opportunity was hard to come by. Wild ginseng that was more than a hundred years old was not a white radish, so how could it be so easy to get?

She didn’t expect that something that even President Lin didn’t dare to hope for would actually happen!

Therefore, President Lin was ecstatic.

The result of the appraisal was that these two wild ginsengs were the offspring of the two wild ginsengs from last time. They were a little bigger than the last time, but the quality was better.

After all, the spirit Qi in the spirit map space was much denser than before.

CEO Lin was very straightforward. He offered the high price of five million Chinese dollars for two wild ginseng.

Xia ruofei did not sell the two wild ginsengs purely for money. Besides, the price was fair. Tongren Hall was definitely making a profit. If they met rich people like last time, they might even make a lot of money. But of course, they had to make a profit when doing business. Otherwise, why would they bother?

Hence, Xia ruofei agreed to the price.

Both parties signed the transfer contract with ease, and then President Lin went to arrange for the finance department to transfer the money immediately.

While waiting for the five million Yuan to be transferred to his account, President Lin warmly invited Xia ruofei to his office at the back of the lobby for a cup of tea.

Xia ruofei had a favor to ask of him, so he agreed.

When they arrived at President Lin’s luxurious office, he personally made tea for Xia ruofei and said,””Boss Xia! If you have such good stuff in the future, don’t forget me! I can guarantee that you won’t suffer a loss in terms of price!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Brother Lin, I see that you’re a good person. That’s why I brought these two wild ginseng to Qiantang city even if I’m tired from the long journey!”

“Boss Xia, you’re a good man!” President Lin nodded.

Xia ruofei smiled.”Brother Lin, I have some connections with wild ginseng. If I have more of such high – Quality goods in the future, I’ll definitely let you know at once.”

“Thank you, brother Xia!” President Lin quickly said. Next time, you don’t have to come all the way here. I’ll bring my men directly to the three mountains and buy them, haha ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.

President Lin immediately said,”brother Xia, if there’s anything I can help you with in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Province, just let me know!” I’ll do my best to help you!”

Xia ruofei was about to get down to business! When he heard this, he took advantage of the situation and said with a smile,””Brother Lin, I’ll be honest with you. Other than these two wild ginsengs, I came to Jiangsu and Zhejiang this time because I have something to do. I might need to trouble you!”

“Go ahead!” President Lin said forthrightly. Brother, you have to do it if you have the conditions. Even if you don ‘t, I’ll create the conditions for you!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Old brother Lin, if this is done, it’ll be good for both of us.”

President Lin’s spirit was lifted and he quickly said,””Brother, what’s the matter? Don’t keep me in suspense ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”brother Lin, I won’t hide it from you. I have a way to get some very good Ironhide Dendrobium strips, but I lack Masters to process them. Your Jiangsu and Zhejiang region is the traditional production area of Ironhide Dendrobium, and Tongren Hall is the number one Chinese medicine shop. I would like to trouble you to introduce me to one or two experienced Masters!”

Xia ruofei paused for a moment and said,”this batch of iron – Skin Dendrobium is of extremely high quality. It can be said to be close to or even better than wild iron – Skin Dendi. It’s definitely a species from laoyan mountain. If it’s made into iron – Skin maples, as long as the processing technique is right, it’s definitely a special product!”

President Lin’s eyes lit up. Tongren Hall was a company that paid attention to quality. As long as they had first – Class medicinal herbs, they would never have too many.

However, he still hesitated and asked,””Brother Xia, it’s not that I don’t trust you, but it’s already past the best season for harvesting iron – Skin Dendrobium! This batch of goods ...”

Xia ruofei smiled,”brother Lin, you don’t trust my eyes!”

“I wouldn’t dare!” President Lin quickly said,”I’m just worried that you don’t know much about iron – Skin Dendrobium and will suffer losses for no reason!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”brother Lin, I’ve already prepared this. Since we’ve come to this point, I’ll have to trouble you to help me take a look!”

With that, Xia ruofei picked up his backpack, unzipped it, and reached in. He took out a few fresh Ironhide strips that were wrapped in a preservation film and handed them to President Lin.

Of course, Xia ruofei had wrapped these fresh strips in advance and stored them in the medium. After all, the preservation effect of the medium was unparalleled! His hand reaching into the bag was just a cover – up.

President Lin quickly took the fresh strips, tore off the preservation film, and observed them carefully.

President Lin’s eyes lit up at the sight of it.

He had been working in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Province for many years and was an expert in iron – skinned dendrobes and iron – skinned maples. Naturally, he could tell the good from the bad.

The fresh strips that Xia ruofei had brought were all very thick and strong. Their skin was dark purple, and the meat between the joints was fat and strong, more like a spindle.

From its appearance, it was definitely of super high quality!

The fresh dendrobes of poor quality were green in color, had long branches, and the meat between the joints was thin. Moreover, there would be a lot of dregs when eaten.

President Lin didn’t hesitate to simply rub a fresh strip on his body and put it in his mouth to chew.

As soon as the noodles entered his mouth, the expression on President Lin’s face became even more colorful. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The Ironhide vessel strips that Xia ruofei brought had no bitter taste at all after chewing. Instead, it was sweet. Most importantly, it had a lot of colloid. After a few bites, it turned into a sticky jelly – like substance. It was very sticky to the mouth and teeth. After chewing, there was almost no residue.

Top – grade! CEO Lin screamed in his heart.

At this moment, President Lin saw Xia ruofei smiling at him. He blushed and knew that he had lost his composure.

Especially when he thought about the question just now, President Lin felt even more embarrassed.

“President Lin, all the iron – Skin Dendrobium I have are of this quality.” Xia ruofei chuckled and asked,”what do you think?”

President Lin didn’t care about the awkwardness and said very excitedly,””Brother Xia, this is definitely the best of the iron – Skin Dendrobium! And it’s 100% a species from laoyan mountain. How did you find it?”

As soon as he said this, President Lin knew that he had misspoken again. Everyone had their own channels, and these channels were the biggest capital. How could he ask such a question casually?

“Brother Xia, I was too excited and got carried away ...” He quickly said, embarrassed.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,””Elder brother Lin, I can get about 2200 catties of this kind of Ironhide vessel fresh strips. Therefore, I’m in urgent need of an experienced master to make them into iron – hide maple buckets!”

Mr. Lin quickly made an estimation in his heart. If the 2200 pounds of fresh strips were of such high quality and the maker was good enough, he should be able to get 110 to 120 pounds of iron – skinned maple.

It was definitely a big business deal!

President Lin’s mind immediately became alive. He asked awkwardly,””Brother Xia, I’d like to ask ... How do you plan to sell these dendrobes after they’re all made into iron – skinned maples?”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Old brother Lin, as long as the price is right and you can afford it, there’s no harm in selling it all to you.”

President Lin was overjoyed. He stood up and said,””That’s great! Brother Xia, we’ll take everything from Qiantang Tongren Tang! As for the price, I’ll definitely give you a fair price. Let’s see the quality of the Ironhide Kaede bucket!”

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”then, about the old master ...”

President Lin waved his hand.”I have a lot of old friends in the area of laoyan mountain. I will definitely find you the best master. I will definitely not waste such good raw materials!”

“Thank you so much!” Xia ruofei said happily,”brother Lin, let’s go now!”
