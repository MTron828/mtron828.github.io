2659 The old company commander comes to seek refuge (1)

“I’ll go! This kid has become much more powerful!”

Xia ruofei heard the familiar voice and immediately let go. He turned around and called out,””Good day, Captain!”

The person who had “ambushed” Xia ruofei behind the door was MA Deputy, Xia ruofei’s company commander when he was in the Army.

Wolf King Guo Zhan was sitting at the table with a few officers and was looking at the two of them with a smile.

Xia ruofei took a closer look. The military rank on ma SU’s shoulder had become two bars and one star. He had been promoted to major.

Ma Jia forced a smile and said, “I’m no longer a company commander ...”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment. This was obviously a promotion, but why did he feel that Ma Jia was still a little unhappy?

“Blood Wolf, you should call him Deputy instructor now!” Guo Zhan said. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Ah?” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but cry out.

He was very surprised that Ma Jia had been promoted to a political cadre.

It wasn’t that being a political cadre wasn’t good, but ma su had always been a military cadre. Needless to say, when he was a platoon leader, he was a Deputy company commander, a training staff officer, and a company commander.

According to the normal development trajectory, even if ma su was promoted, he should be a Deputy battalion commander or a staff officer or a Section Chief. How did he become a deputy instructor?

In a unit like the lone wolf assault team, after being changed to a political cadre, the road ahead was much narrower.

“What do you mean” ah “?” Guo Zhan said,”come and sit down. Let’s talk while we eat!”

“Yes!” Xia ruofei said subconsciously.

Guo Zhan sat on the main seat. On his left was a major who was of the same rank as ma su. On his right, the guest seat was empty. It was obviously reserved for Xia ruofei.

When Xia ruofei was still in the Army, he would not have been able to sit at this table of lieutenants and lieutenants.

But now that he had retired, he would be a guest if he returned to his old army, so there was nothing inappropriate about it.

Besides, Xia ruofei was no longer the ignorant fool from back then. He had seen many more big scenes than these captains and major.

In fact, Guo Zhan had made this arrangement after some consideration, including the officers he had called over to accompany him.

To put it bluntly, Xia ruofei had helped him solve a big problem this time. Not to mention that Xia ruofei was deeply loved by Guo Zhan when he was in the Army. After he retired, he performed very well. Naturally, Guo Zhan treated Xia ruofei with great courtesy.

Xia ruofei only hesitated for a moment before he smiled and nodded. He walked over to Guo Zhan and sat down beside him.

Ma Jia also sat next to Xia ruofei on his right.

After everyone had taken their seats, Guo Zhan shouted,”Come on! Fill it up first!”

A first lieutenant across from him immediately stood up and filled everyone’s cups.

However, it was not filled with wine, but sprite. There were a few bottles of sprite on the table.

Ever since the commander – in – chief made the decision to rectify the style of the Army, the Army had implemented the strictest ban on drinking.

Alcohol was strictly prohibited on weekdays. Not a drop of alcohol was allowed to be touched. It was a high – pressure line.

Even if one could drink in moderation at the end of the week or during holidays, one was absolutely not allowed to drink excessively. Furthermore, one was not allowed to drink in the unit’s cafeteria.

In other words, he could drink a little on weekends and holidays, but he could only have a small drink with two or three friends at home.

Guo Zhan also smiled and explained,”Blood Wolf, you must know about the prohibition, so I definitely can’t drink with you today.” I’ll go find you the next time I’m on vacation, and we can drink to our hearts “content!”

“I understand, old leader!” Xia ruofei smiled. Besides ... As long as we have a good relationship, what can’t we drink?”

“Hahaha! Well said!” Guo Zhan laughed and said,”it’s worth a toast!”

“Come on! Cheers!”

“Welcome back to your old unit, squad leader Xia!”

“Welcome home! Cheers!”

After everyone clinked their glasses, they raised their heads and drank an entire glass of sprite. Although he wasn’t drinking alcohol, he still had the heroic spirit of a soldier.

After drinking, Xia ruofei turned to Ma Jia and asked,””Old company commander, what’s going on? Why did you suddenly change the government?”

Ma Jia pursed her lips and said in a low voice,””It’s not that sudden ... In fact, not long after you left the Army, I was already transferred to an instructor ...”

At this time, Guo Zhan said,”ruofei, something happened to Young MA a few years ago ... He was injured during training and ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament. Although the repair surgery was successful, it is impossible for his physical function to recover to its previous level. Whether it is his speed or explosive power, they have been greatly affected. After evaluation, he is no longer suitable to serve as a military chief, so he was changed to an instructor.”

Xia ruofei immediately understood that a normal soldier would not treat a cricket like this. After all, although the cruciate ligament rupture was a major injury, since the repair surgery was very successful, it would not affect normal exercise. It would not be a problem to cope with daily training. Soldiers were not professional athletes. However, the lone wolf assault team was special in nature, and their requirements were much higher than ordinary troops. When ma su suffered such injuries, it was almost a foregone conclusion that he would be promoted to a political cadre.

Xia ruofei said to Ma Jia,”old company commander, don’t be so depressed. You’re still contributing to the Army no matter what position you’re in ...”

Xia ruofei felt that his words of comfort were weak, but Ma Jia smiled indifferently and said,””Little Xia, you don’t have to comfort me. It’s been a long time since that happened, and I’ve already gotten over it. “
