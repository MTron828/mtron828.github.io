After he was done, Xia ruofei left the medium in a hurry.

He asked Liang Qichao for the keys to the pickup truck and left the farm alone.

Australia was vast and sparsely populated. Some of the desolate places were often deserted with a radius of more than 100 kilometers. Xia ruofei easily found a remote road and observed it. There was no one within a few kilometers of it, and there would only be one or two cars passing by. It could be said to be very desolate.

After Xia ruofei got out of the car, he took out two pieces of wood from the medium and placed them on the side of the road. Then, he took out his phone and contacted the driver.

He had already determined his location through the satellite positioning system. After reporting his location to the driver, the driver told him that it would take him two or three hours to get here. There was no other way. Australia was very large, and this place was quite far from the residential area.

After Xia ruofei hung up the phone, he took out a recliner and an umbrella from his interspace. He lay down under the umbrella to pass the time.

When the sky was slightly dark, the flat truck finally arrived.

While they were waiting, not a single car passed by on this road, which showed how remote it was.

The driver also knew in advance that they were going to transport two logs of wood, so he also brought tools such as hinges and a few workers with him.

The driver was also very curious about this desolate loading site. Xia ruofei explained that it was sent by a foreign driver who was not familiar with the road. He returned after unloading the goods, so he had to call another car to transfer the goods.

Xia ruofei even pretended to be indignant and complained.

The driver didn’t ask much. He would get the money anyway, so he immediately asked the workers to start loading the car.

Everyone skillfully tied the wood and hoisted it onto the truck, securing it with steel wires. Xia ruofei then drove the pickup truck to lead the way. The two cars drove to West Winery one after the other.

When they arrived at the winery, the sky was already dark. The workers who had been busy the whole day had all gone home, and the winery was quiet.

Xia ruofei rang the doorbell and shouted,””Uncle Wester, come and open the door! My oak is here!”

After a while, there was the sound of footsteps. Old West came out in his pajamas. Since they had to get up early to pick grapes, the two usually went to bed after dinner.

Xia ruofei said apologetically,””Uncle Wester, I’m sorry to disturb your rest! The oak that I told you in the morning has arrived. Open the door and let the car in to unload the wood. Then, you can continue to rest ...”

“It’s fine, it’s fine,” Old West said with a smile.”We just laid down ... Xia, your friend is quite efficient!”

Xia ruofei said,”the driver sent it to the wrong place. I even found a trolley to transfer it. Otherwise, it wouldn’t have arrived so late ...”

“Come in!” Old West opened the door to the winery and let two cars in.

There were only two logs of wood, so the workers quickly unloaded them on the empty space in the winery. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Then, the truck driver took the workers and drove away from Xuanji. The transportation fee was naturally settled with Paradise Farm.

“Uncle Wester, I’m sorry! You should go and rest!” Xia ruofei said,”tomorrow, remember to get a bucket – jingling craftsman to take a look. If it’s useful, he can help me make a few oak barrels.”

Old West chuckled and said,”no rush!” Don’t worry, I’ll take a look at your wood ...”

With that, Old West walked to the side of the corridor and turned on the headlights. Then, he walked to the wood and squatted down to observe.

In fact, Old West did not have much hope for wood. Good oak was in short supply for wineries. Moreover, the quality of oak in Australia was average. For the wood to be transported so quickly, it must be planted not far from the Hunter Valley area. He had not heard of any place nearby that produced good oak!

In fact, most wineries used oak barrels from the United States, France, and Hungary.

However, after a few glances, he couldn’t help but rub his eyes. Then, he impatiently got closer to take a look. His entire body was almost on the wood.

Xia ruofei looked at Old West and knew that his oak tree was not bad. In fact, he had never been worried. He was bathed in rich spiritual energy in the spirit map space all day long. How bad could an oak tree be when it grew in such an environment?

“How was it, uncle Wester?” Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”can this oak wood be used?”

Old West suddenly stood up and looked at Xia ruofei with a fanatical gaze.””Xia, where did you get these oak trees?”

“Didn’t I already tell you? My friend gave it to me!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Old West patted his head and said,””Look at my memory! Xia, does your friend still have such oak? I’ll take as many as you have!”

“So, these two oak trees can still be used?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

“It’s more than just usable! He’s the king of oak!” Old West said excitedly,”look at the density of the veins! Even the upstart of oak, the best Hungary oak, could not compare to it at all! Do you know? The more compact the texture, the less tannins would be released, which could make the wine more refined! This is simply a top – grade oak that can only be found by luck!”

Old West was very excited. He pointed at the two oak trees and said,””Also, I smelled it carefully just now. This Oak’s fragrance is very unique and very charming. It makes people feel like they’re floating! I can’t imagine how mesmerizing the wine would be if it were to ferment our Semillon!”

Then, Old West looked at Xia ruofei with a fanatical gaze and asked,””Xia, tell me quickly, does your friend have more of these oak trees?”
