Lin Qiao’s action of opening the car door froze for a moment. She turned her head with a blush on her face. Xia ruofei also turned his head to look at the sound.

There were three girls standing not far away, looking curiously at Xia ruofei and the cool Knight XV SUV. The girl who spoke was standing in the middle. She had a pretty face, but the most impressive thing about her was her long, black, and smooth hair, which was noticeable at first glance.

The girl was looking at Lin Qiao with an inquiring look.

Lin Qiao was dazed for a moment before she came back to her senses and quickly said,”Sister he, Juan Zi, Wei Xi, why did you come down?”

The girl who Lin Qiao called “sister he” reproached, “You’re still talking! You were on the phone when you suddenly went crazy, shouting and rushing downstairs. We were all frightened, so how could we not follow you down to see? What if something happens?”

Sister he said as she glanced at Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei could not help but smile bitterly to himself. The flashy luxury car, the young appearance, the entrance to the girls ‘dormitory ... These girls seemed to have thought of some bad social phenomenon ...

Lin Qiao also realized it quickly. Her pretty face suddenly became hot and she said in a coquettish manner,””Sister he, what could happen to me? What are you guys thinking?”

Lin Qiao’s shyness made sister he and the others even more suspicious.

Xia ruofei looked at Lin Qiao with a smile and asked,””Hello! You guys are Qiao’ er’s classmates, right?”

When sister he heard Xia ruofei calling Lin Qiao so intimately, she looked at Xia ruofei with even more vigilance. She had already put Xia ruofei on the same level as those who drove luxury cars to the school to keep girls as their mistresses.

Heron Island University was a well – known University in the country, so this phenomenon was relatively rare. However, it was precisely because of this that sister Lotus felt even more heartbroken for Lin Qiao. Lin Qiao was usually a young and lively girl who was loved by everyone. She did not expect Lin Qiao to “go astray” for material enjoyment.

Xia ruofei saw that the three girls were silent, so he smiled and took the initiative to explain,””Let me introduce myself. I’m Xia ruofei ...”

“We’re not interested in your name!” Sister he interrupted Xia ruofei.

“You might have misunderstood. I’m Lin Qiao’s brother!” Xia ruofei said with a bitter smile.

Lin Qiao also came back to her senses and quickly said,”Yeah! This is my brother! What are you guys thinking?”

Sister he suddenly felt embarrassed, but she quickly came back to her senses. She looked at Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao with suspicion and said,””What a coincidence, I’ve seen the family situation form you filled in. You don’t have a brother, right? Besides, you don’t have the same surname and you don’t look alike ...”

Sister he was the eldest sister in the dormitory and was also the class Committee member, so she had the opportunity to come into contact with the forms that everyone filled out.

Her words reminded Lin Qiao of her brother, Lin Hu, who had been sacrificed. A trace of sadness flashed in her eyes.

Xia ruofei took it all in and patted Lin Qiao’s shoulder. Then, he said to sister he,””It’s not that Qiao’ er doesn’t have an elder brother, it’s just that ... Her elder brother died for the country ...”

“Ah?” Sister he immediately covered her mouth.

Xia ruofei continued,”I’m her brother’s comrade. Her mother is my godmother. She’s my godsister. Do you guys understand?”

Sister he and the others had already believed most of it. After all, Lin Qiao didn’t seem to be a gold digger at all. She was a very innocent and lively girl. If there were girls in Heron Island University who would accept a rich man’s sugar daddy, this person would definitely not be Lin Qiao.

At this moment, another girl beside sister he also called out,””I remember now. Qiao’ er said that her mac laptop and iPad were all gifts from her brother. It must be you!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.

Sister he also remembered that Lin Qiao did say something like that. However, she was preconceived, so she immediately thought that Lin Qiao didn’t have a brother in the form.

Sister he was a little embarrassed and blushed. She quickly glanced at Xia ruofei and then lowered her head. “Qiao’ er, I’m sorry! We’ve misunderstood you ...”

Lin Qiao said with a generous smile,”Sister he, it’s okay. It’ll be fine after you explain it clearly ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”Qiao’ er, these are your classmates, right?” They really care about you ... Oh right, you haven’t introduced me yet!”

“Oh, right!” Lin Qiao giggled and said,”brother ruofei, let me formally introduce you. This is he he, the eldest sister in our dormitory. Don’t look at her weak appearance, she has a black belt in Taekwondo!”

He he said with some embarrassment,””I’m just practicing in my spare time ...”

“It’s amazing to be able to get a black belt in an amateur’s exam!” Xia ruofei said with a warm smile.

“That’s right! Even three to five Ordinary Boys can’t get close to sister he!” Lin Qiao said,”but brother ruofei, your Kung Fu is better!”

He he glanced at the fair and clean Xia ruofei with some surprise. There was a trace of eagerness to fight in her eyes.

Xia ruofei knew that these amateur players loved to challenge others, so he quickly said,””Qiao’ er, don’t talk nonsense. I’ve been away from the Army for so many years, and the skills I’ve learned have long fallen behind!”

Xia ruofei had mastered the skills of killing people. Why would he be willing to use them to spar with little girls? Besides, what if he accidentally hurt he he?
