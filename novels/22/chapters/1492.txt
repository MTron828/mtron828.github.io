Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei said helplessly,”fine!” I’m going to do some cleaning up, and then we’ll go down together!”

Xia ruofei went into the hole and kept the snake – like endoscope. Then, he enlarged the hole to make sure that a person could pass through. Then, as he retreated, he repaired the entire robber’s hole until he was out of the hole.

Then, Xia ruofei carefully moved the soil to a small pond not far away and discarded it. He also did his best to clean up the traces of the hole.

Then, he broke some branches and prepared to cover the hole.

It was a depression in the ground, surrounded by dense trees and few people. There was also a small mound next to the hole, which was covered with branches. Even if someone passed by, it would be difficult to notice the hole.

Song Wei looked at Xia ruofei’s work and smiled.”If I didn’t know about your resume, I would have suspected that you were a professional grave robber!”

Xia ruofei shrugged.”With my standards, I’m a professional in everything I do!”

“Great expert!” Song Wei laughed. Should we go down?”

“There’s one last thing!”Xia ruofei said seriously.

After that, he took out a climbing rope from his bag and tied it to a tree not far away. After testing the rope’s reliability, he slipped the rope into the cave.

Of course, he also used weeds and branches to cover up the part of the rope that was on the ground.

“This is our rope of life!” Xia ruofei laughed.”I’ll have to rely on it to come out!”

“Let’s go!” Song Wei couldn’t wait.

“Don’t rush!” Xia ruofei said,”put on your equipment!”

Then, Xia ruofei took out two sets of protective clothing from his treasure chest – like bag. Although they were not the most professional ones, they could prevent their skin from being exposed to the air. With the gas mask, they should be able to avoid most of the danger.

As for whether the gas mask could filter out the unknown poison, Xia ruofei was not too worried. With him around, the poison would not be able to get close to them.

The protective suit and gas mask were to make song Wei feel more at ease.

Song Wei was also impressed by Xia ruofei’s attentiveness.

The two of them quickly put on protective clothing and gas masks.

Xia ruofei threw the backpack into the hole and said to Song Wei,””I’ll go down first, you follow behind me. Remember to use branches to cover the entrance!”

“I know!” Song Wei said calmly.

Xia ruofei went into the hole. After a while, Song Wei heard Xia ruofei’s voice from her earpiece.”Song Wei, come down!”

Because they were wearing gas masks, they were also equipped with walkie – talkie equipment for communication.

Hence, Song Wei went into the hole as well. Half of her body was exposed. As she slowly went down, she used the branches that Xia ruofei had gathered to cover the entrance.

Following the hole that Xia ruofei had dug, Song Wei quickly arrived at the bottom. Her feet had already touched Xia ruofei’s shoulder.

Hence, Xia ruofei said,”hold on tight to the rope. I’ll go in first. You just have to come down with me. Don’t worry. I’ll catch you from below!” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“En!” Song Wei clutched the rope tightly.

Then, she felt Xia ruofei move and heard a ‘Dong’ sound. Xia ruofei must have jumped in.

Song Wei didn’t hesitate and continued to go down the rope. When she missed her step, she fell directly under the effect of gravity.

She wasn’t worried at all because she knew that Xia ruofei would definitely be there to protect her.

Sure enough, the next moment, she was tightly hugged by a pair of strong hands and then gently landed on the ground.
