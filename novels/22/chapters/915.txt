Chapter 916: Destiny (2)

Translator: 549690339

Paradise Corporation was quite famous in Sanshan city and even in the southeast province. However, it was still an unfamiliar name to Tang Yitian, who was in Australia. Moreover, Xia ruofei was so young, so Tang Yitian naturally thought that the company wouldn’t be very big.

Xia ruofei nodded.”Our company is also planning to expand into the Australian market. We’ll definitely need to look for business partners.”

“No problem, no problem!” Tang Yitian quickly said. If you have any difficulties in your business in Australia, you can come to me at any time. ”

Tang Yitian was worried that he wouldn’t be able to repay Xia ruofei’s great kindness. If he could help Xia ruofei with his business, he would be more than happy to do so.

Although he had saved Xia ruofei’s life and there was no way he could repay him, he would feel more at ease if he could do something for Xia ruofei.

Then, Tang Yitian took out a gold – stamped business card from his pocket and handed it to Xia ruofei, saying,””Mr. Xia, my personal number is on this. You can find me at any time if you need anything!”

Although Tang Yitian had already given Xia ruofei his business card at the airport, it was the ordinary business card he usually used in business activities. He had given it to many people.

However, this kind of gold – stamped business card was completely different. Only his close friends could have it. The phone number on it was Tang Yitian’s private number, which only a few people knew.

With Tang Yitian’s status in Australia, even the important officials of New South Wales were not qualified to have his private phone number.

This showed how much importance Tang Yitian attached to Xia ruofei. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Xia ruofei took the business card with a smile and gave his own to Tang Yitian. Xia ruofei had never prepared a business card before, but under Feng Jing’s strong request, he finally agreed to the company’s administrative office to make a batch for him.

The card looked very ordinary, and the content printed on it was also very simple. It was the chairman of peach blossom company, Xia ruofei, and his mobile number was on it.

Xia ruofei rarely participated in business activities. Most of the necessary social activities were done by Feng Jing, so his business card was almost useless. Before he left the country, he had randomly thought of it and carried a few with him.

In a sense, Xia ruofei’s business card was similar to Tang Yitian’s gold – stamped business card. Few people could get Xia ruofei’s business card.

“Mr. Tang, please call me at any time if there’s anything wrong with little Haoran,” Xia ruofei handed over his business card.

Tang Yitian hurriedly kept Xia ruofei’s business card close to his body and sincerely expressed his gratitude again.

Then, the two of them chatted for a while. Tang Yitian also took the initiative to talk about little Haoran’s situation.

It turned out that little Haoran was very healthy when he was just born. However, when he was one year old, he often felt hot all over his body, and his body became weaker, often falling sick.

In fact, little Haoran’s meridians were filled with innate pure yang energy, and he couldn’t get it out. As a result, his qi and blood couldn’t flow as smoothly as ordinary people, so he naturally became weak and sickly.

However, Tang Yitian and his wife didn’t know about it at first, so they thought that little Haoran was sick.

With Tang Yitian’s wealth and influence, he could easily invite many famous doctors to treat little Haoran.

However, these famous doctors could not do anything. They could not even find out the cause of the illness.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,””Little Haoran isn’t sick at all. The doctor must be helpless.”

“Isn’t that so?”Tang Yitian forced a smile. It was just that we didn’t know at first. We took Haoran to see many doctors, but there was no improvement at all. Later, an elder of mine who was proficient in numerology made a divination for Haoran. The divination showed that Haoran’s situation was very dangerous, but there seemed to be a chance of survival. My elder clearly expressed that this chance of survival would fall in the ancestral land of the East, Huaxia. ”

“I didn’t expect Mr. Tang to believe in fortune – telling.” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“My senior is quite amazing. If there’s a chance in the future, I’ll introduce you to him. You’ll know then.” “We thought about it and thought that it was most likely related to Chinese medicine. So, we often returned to China to visit famous Chinese medical Masters. However, we were always disappointed ...” Tang Yitian continued.

Speaking of this, Tang Yitian looked deeply at Xia ruofei and said,””I didn’t know until today that the divination that my elder analyzed, which said that Haoran’s only chance of survival fell in Huaxia, was actually referring to you, Mr. Xia!”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment, then he smiled and said,””Isn’t this a little too absurd?”

Tang Yitian said seriously,””Mr. Xia, a lot of things might really be predestined ... We planned to stay a little longer on this trip back to China, so we took a private plane back to Australia first. However, I got news this afternoon that a famous United States medical professor is going to visit Australia, and he will only stay for half a day. We wanted to ask him to take a look at Haoran, but we didn’t have enough time to use the private plane, so we booked the fastest flight. It was this series of coincidences that allowed our family to be lucky enough to meet you. I feel like it’s destined ...”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel that this was too much of a coincidence. It was a small probability event. Let’s not talk about anything else. Even taking an ordinary flight was extremely rare for Tang Yitian’s family.
