Chapter 1546: Cutting the stone on the spot (3)

Translator: 549690339

He Ping knew that Xia ruofei was with Yu mingdong and was also Ma Zhiming’s friend, so he didn’t put on airs. He nodded and started to study Xia ruofei’s raw stone.

He frowned and thought for a while. Then, he drew a line on the surface of the raw stone and said to the stonecutter,””Let’s cut from here first!”

The stonecutter nodded and directed the forklift to place the raw stone on the cutting machine. He also asked Shi Lei to come over and help adjust the position. After he fixed it, he turned on the cutting machine.

This raw stone was quite famous at the public auction today. Many people had an impression of it and even participated in the bidding. However, Xia ruofei won it in the end.

Therefore, everyone was also in high spirits. After all, compared to this raw stone, Yu mingdong’s previous small pieces were not of a high grade.

Xia ruofei stared at the cutting machine intently. He knew that there must be Jade in the raw stone. The reaction from the spirit map space was so strong. The Jade must be of high quality or in large quantities. He couldn’t wait to see what was inside the stone.

Amidst the sharp noise, stone chips flew.

Xia ruofei’s eyesight was far better than that of ordinary people. While everyone was waiting for the stonecutter to cut the raw stone along the line drawn by He Ping, Xia ruofei sharply noticed a touch of green at the cut.

“Stop!” Xia ruofei called out subconsciously.

Although the scene was very noisy, Xia ruofei’s voice contained a trace of vital energy and was clearly transmitted to the stonecutter’s ears. He almost subconsciously stabilized his arm, lifted the knife, and turned off the power.

The stonecutter looked at Xia ruofei in confusion.

“Mr. Xia, is there a problem?” He Ping also frowned slightly and asked.

“Old he, I think I see green ...” Xia ruofei said.

He Ping frowned and said,”how’s that possible?!” The cut was so small, and stone chips were flying everywhere, so it was impossible to see what was inside! Besides, I’ve looked at this raw material carefully. If you cut it along the line I just drew, you definitely won’t cut the Jade meat!”

The onlookers couldn’t help but start discussing.

“This young man is too nervous! How could he see what was going on inside the incision in that situation?”

“Besides, old he personally drew these lines. How could they be inaccurate?” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“I think he’s just too eager to raise the price. He’s hallucinating. Hahaha ...”

“It looks like a rookie ...”

Xia ruofei did not pay attention to their discussion and only patiently said to He Ping,””Old he, maybe I was wrong ... But since we’ve stopped, let’s take a look at the condition of the incision first!”

He Ping’s face was a little dark as he said sullenly,””This raw material is yours. You can cut it however you want!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said to the stonecutter,””Master, can I trouble you to Bring Me Some Water ...”

The stonecutter immediately brought a basin of water to wash away the stone chips and powder from the cut. Then, with a smile, he took out a strong flashlight and shone it into the cut that was less than a centimeter wide.

He also knew He Ping’s name. He did not believe that Xia ruofei could see the inside of the incision in that situation, and he did not believe that He Ping would draw the wrong line.

However, the stonecutter only took one look and couldn’t help but exclaim in shock ...
