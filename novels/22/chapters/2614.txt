2615 Elder song (1)

Xia ruofei walked into elder Liu’s ward and handed the bag of Chinese medicine to the nurse. He asked her to heat the Chinese medicine and put it into a bowl. The nurse did all the work in this room under Xia ruofei’s eyes, so naturally, there was no need to worry about the safety of the medicine.

After passing the Chinese medicine bag to the nurse, Xia ruofei smiled and greeted her.””Old man, how do you feel today?”

With a faint smile on his face, old man Liu said,””It’s all thanks to you! I’ve been feeling pretty good these past two days. ”

“That’s good!” Xia ruofei sat down by elder Liu’s bed and took his pulse.”What you need to do now is to cooperate with the treatment and not let your thoughts run wild. I’ll do my best to come up with a treatment plan for you. ”

“I’m much more at ease with you here ...”Old man Liu nodded.

Xia ruofei smiled and didn’t say anything. He closed his eyes and focused on examining elder Liu.

After a while, he opened his eyes and said,””At the moment, it seems that this prescription will still have a certain effect. In the case of not being able to gather all the medicinal herbs, I’ll use this prescription for the time being!”

At this moment, the nurse had already heated up the Chinese medicine and brought it over.

Xia ruofei took the bowl of medicine and gestured for the medical staff to leave. He held the bowl and smiled.”Old man, drink your medicine first!”

“Xia, your medicine is quite effective, but ... I still want to recover faster.” Old master Liu looked at Xia ruofei and said,”I know you have a way, right?”

Xia ruofei’s expression did not change. He smiled and said,””An illness is gone like silk,” Wang Yao said.”You should understand this principle. Your illness is very dangerous. We must be very careful in treatment. This can’t be rushed.”

Without waiting for old man Liu to speak, Xia ruofei immediately said,””Here, drink the medicine first. We’ll talk about the other things later!”

Old master Liu looked at Xia ruofei deeply and said,””Alright then!”

He did not ask for Xia ruofei’s help. He took the bowl of medicine and gulped it down in big mouthfuls.

Although there was still some residue at the bottom of the bowl, when elder Liu’s lips came into contact with the medicinal soup, the spirit Heart Flower petals contained in the Chinese medicine had already begun to seep into elder Liu’s body. Therefore, the little bit of Chinese medicine left behind was not very effective.

Xia ruofei put the bowl of medicine aside.

“Xiao Xia, this is all family Liu’s fault,” old man Liu said.”But we’ve caused you so much trouble. You’ve flown all the way here from San Shan, and we’ve used up a lot of precious herbs for this new prescription. I’ve always felt bad about it.”

At this point, old man Liu paused for a moment. It seemed that his body was still weak, and he would feel tired if he spoke too much in one breath.

After catching his breath, old man Liu continued,””Especially since you didn’t mention anything about the remuneration these past few days, I felt even more apologetic. He originally wanted to call you over yesterday to talk about this problem, but you were busy brewing medicine yesterday, so he didn’t mention it to QUN FENG. Today, I still want to talk to you about the medical fees. ”

Xia ruofei had already known about this through Liu Qunfeng, and this was within his expectations, so he was not surprised.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”go on, I’m all ears.”

Old man Liu nodded and said,””In order to treat my illness, the medicinal herbs you consumed were too precious, so the consultation fee last time was already low. This time, my condition is even more troublesome, so I don’t know how much I should pay. I thought about it for a long time yesterday and came up with three plans. You can choose one of them. ”

After that, old man Liu told him all three of his plans.

Xia ruofei sat by the bed and listened attentively. He didn’t interrupt the whole time. When elder Liu finished, he smiled and said,””I have to say ... The plans you proposed are too tempting. No matter which one it is, I’m still tempted!”

With a glimmer of hope in his eyes, old man Liu asked,””So ... You’re willing to choose one of the plans as your medical fee?”

Xia ruofei did not answer directly. Instead, he said indifferently,””Old man, you should know my situation better. It should be said that at this stage, my pursuit of money is no longer so strong. I have never been a slave to money. I have more than enough money to spend now, so ...”

“Free and easy!” Old man Liu gave him a thumbs up and said,”in the face of the temptation of billions of dollars, I admire you for being able to say this!”

Xia ruofei said,”old man, I still have the same words.” It’s still too early to talk about the treatment fee before I’m 100% sure that I can cure you. Also ... I really don’t know how to choose between your three treatment plans, so ... I hope you can give me some time to think about it. At the same time, I’ll use this time to further improve the treatment plan and see if it can relieve your pain as soon as possible. ” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

When elder Liu heard this, he was secretly delighted.

Old master Liu knew that since Xia ruofei said so, it meant that he had a better plan for the treatment. Besides, it also meant that Xia ruofei was likely to accept such a treatment plan, but he still needed to weigh the pros and cons before making a decision.
