Chapter 569: It’s really you_1

When the phone rang, Qian Lijun was showing Xia ruofei around his family’s iron – Skin Dendrobium cultivation base. He took it out and saw the caller ID. Seeing that it was his father, he quickly picked it up,”Dad!”

Boss Qian asked while driving,””Li Jun, where are you?”

“I’m at the office!” “What’s wrong?” Qian Lijun asked with a smile.

“Are you with your comrades?” Boss Qian asked after some hesitation.

“He’s here! I’m showing you around the company!” Qian Lijun said.

“Oh, I know.” Boss Qian said,”I’ll be right back. Don’t go out ...”

With that, boss Qian hung up the phone.

On the other hand, Qian Lijun was at a loss. He did not know why his father would suddenly make such a call.

When Xia ruofei saw Qian Lijun’s expression, he couldn’t help but smile and ask,””Li Jun? Is there something your dad wants to talk to you about?”

“I don’t know ...” Qian Lijun said,”I don’t know what’s wrong with my dad today. I feel that he’s a little out of it. He doesn’t even know how to start talking ...”

Qian Lijun then laughed and said,”forget it, let’s not care about him!” Let’s go, I’ll take you to the place where we made the iron – Skin Kaede bucket ...”

Qian Lijun continued to show Xia ruofei around while boss Qian drove back quickly.

After a while, Xia ruofei, who was visiting the shop, heard a text message notification. He took out his phone and looked at it.

......

It was a notification of the change in the bank balance.

The text message showed that 20.46 million HxB had been transferred to his bank account.

Xia ruofei smiled, thinking that brother Lin was quite fast. He had already transferred the money in less than half a day.

Although Xia ruofei had never been worried about money ever since he obtained the spirit map, and the occasional shortage of funds was due to construction, he was still a little excited to have more than 20 million HxB in his account.

Furthermore, this would become a fixed income in the future, and he would be able to earn a sum every one or two months. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Moreover, the Dingfeng winery’s situation was also very good now. Once all the different grades of wine were listed on the market, it would form a virtuous cycle every month, and he would get more than 12 million Yuan in dividends from the winery every month.

In total, not including the income from Paradise Farm and Australia’s Paradise Farm, Xia ruofei could earn about 30 million Yuan a month.

This was money that ordinary people couldn’t earn in their entire lives!

Seeing Xia ruofei’s silly smile, Qian Lijun could not help but ask,””What’s wrong, ruofei? Did your wife send you a message?”

Xia ruofei returned to her senses and kept her phone. She smiled and said,””No, no. Didn’t I just ship all the iron – skinned maple buckets I made to Tongren Hall in Qiantang yesterday? I just received the payment. ”

When Qian Lijun heard this, he didn’t ask any further. Although they were on good terms, this was Xia ruofei’s business secret.

If Qian Lijun knew that Xia ruofei had earned more than 20 million Yuan in one go and that it was basically pure profit, he would probably be so shocked that his jaw would drop.

Although the scale of the Qian family’s iron – Skin Dendrobium cultivation base was not small, the annual output was only a few hundred kilograms. Moreover, due to the limited quality of the raw materials, it was naturally impossible for all of them to be of special quality. After the iron – Skin Dendrobium was graded, those of different quality actually could not be sold for much.

Furthermore, even if they were all unique grade, they would not be able to reach the price of Xia ruofei’s iron – Skin maples.

In addition, they had to feed so many workers and maintain the iron – Skin dendrobes. They had to spend a lot of money on all aspects, and their profits were further diluted.

Qian Lijun didn’t ask any more questions and continued to show Xia ruofei around.

After a few steps, Xia ruofei’s phone rang. This time, it was president Lin of Tongren Hall.

Hence, Xia ruofei gestured to Qian Lijun and picked up the phone.””Big brother Lin!”

“Brother Xia, we’ve already transferred the payment for this time!” President Lin said with a bright smile.

“I’ve already received a text message.” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Haha, that’s good.” President Lin said,”brother Xia, regarding the cooperation between our Tongren Hall and your peach blossom company, I have also asked the head of the main store today ...”

“Oh? How should I put it?”

“Brother Xia, I faxed yesterday’s inspection report to the main branch in Beijing. The higher – ups took a look and agreed without a second word!” President Lin laughed and said,”our leader said that this kind of high – Quality iron maple bucket can only be sold in Tongtong Hall to show its extraordinariness! High – Quality medicinal herbs and our hundred – year – old shop bring out the best in each other! Hahaha ...”

“Since there’s no problem on your side, I’ll naturally keep my promise.” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I will give you the exclusive rights to the iron – Skin fengdou and the wild ginseng!”

“Thank you, brother Xia!” President Lin said eagerly,”when can we meet up to discuss the specific cooperation terms? Why don’t I come to Anyue city today?”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”CEO Lin, how about this ... I won’t be staying in Anyue city for long. I’ll be back in two days at most. Why don’t we meet at the three mountains in three days?” You have to give me a chance to do my part as the host!”

Actually, Xia ruofei wanted to slack off again. He would just leave these details to Feng Jing when they returned. He only needed to give a general direction and principle.
