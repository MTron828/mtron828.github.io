2391 Entering the Warzone for the first time (2)

As Xia ruofei ran in the dark – he released his spiritual power to scan the surroundings. Once they crossed the border, it meant that they had entered the battlefield – they had to be very careful.

Currently, the government forces and anti – Government armed forces were mainly concentrated in the central region of wadila. The area bordering arulei was relatively stable and there were no large – scale battles. Hence, Xia ruofei did not encounter much danger along the way. When he encountered a few waves of wadila government border guard patrols, he avoided them in advance after detecting them with his mental strength.

Xia ruofei had only roughly determined the direction and continued to move forward at a high speed. He ran at this speed for an entire hour and had covered about 30 kilometers.

It had to be said that the physical fitness of cultivators was indeed extremely strong. An ordinary person could not run so far in an hour, even on flat roads, let alone in such terrain.

Of course, Xia ruofei was not stupid enough to run all the way. It was at least 700 to 800 kilometers from here to the poeta region where the modr mercenary group had been active recently. He could not run all the way there. He had to get a car first.

Hence, when Xia ruofei was far away from the border between arulei and vadira, he found a hidden marshland and hid there. He sat cross – legged on the ground and took out a piece of origin crystal to start cultivating. At the same time, he also recovered his physical and mental energy.

The night was peaceful.

The vadira territory was vast, and there was a large wilderness at the border of arulei. No one would wander around here at night for no reason.

Xia ruofei had already set off when the sky brightened.

He was wearing a plaid shirt, an army green vest, a pair of gray overalls, and high – Top outdoor boots. He was carrying a backpack and had an SLR camera hanging in front of his chest.

This was the identity that Xia ruofei had set for himself during the vadira event as a war reporter.

To be more precise, she was a free war reporter.

In many war – torn areas, a large number of war journalists were active. Some of them did not belong to any news agencies. They interviewed in war – torn areas as free agents, and some of them would sell first – hand news material to major news agencies.

Some of these people dreamed of being a journalist, while others made a living out of it. No matter what their purpose was, objectively speaking, a large number of freelance war journalists were active in various hot spots every day.

These people were really fighting with their lives. Every year, there were many casualties. Some were kidnapped and beheaded by extremist organizations, some were hit by stray bullets, and some were killed by various accidents or diseases ...

These freelance war journalists came from all over the world. Xia ruofei’s identity in the war zone would not attract any attention.

He was walking on a simple road with a camera and a camera.

The handheld GPS showed that there was a small town controlled by the government army about 15 kilometers ahead. Xia ruofei planned to see if he could get a car there.

Xia ruofei turned his back to the sun and walked along the simple road to the West.

After walking for about four to five kilometers, Xia ruofei heard the sound of a car engine coming from behind. He moved to the side of the road to make way for them. The simple road was not very wide.

A dusty Ford off – Road vehicle drove up from behind, but the car didn’t drive away. Instead, it slowed down and honked twice.

Xia ruofei turned his head and saw a white man with messy hair and an unkempt beard sticking his head out of the car window. He shouted,””Hey! Brother, do you need a ride?”

Xia ruofei was stunned. There was such a warm – hearted person?

However, he wasn’t afraid of the other party’s ulterior motives. He smiled and nodded.”Thank you!”

The white man with disheveled hair stopped the car. Xia ruofei opened the door to the passenger seat and got in.

He saw that the back seat of the car was filled with all kinds of photography equipment, including lenses of various size, several single – lens reflex cameras, a portable workstation dedicated to video recording, and a drone.

Xia ruofei immediately understood. This person was probably also a war reporter, but he was more well – equipped than a fake reporter like him.

The white man introduced himself as he drove,””Brother! You’re also a war correspondent?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”yes!” I’m Jenneson, and I’ve only been in this line of work for a short time. Brother, how should I address you?”

The white man twisted his body to the music in the car and said,””You can just call me Tony!”

Hearing this name, the first thing that came to Xia ruofei’s mind was the “Mr. Tony” who did people’s hair in the laundry, scissors, and blow dryer shop and strongly recommended membership cards. He could not help but smile.

Tony was more talkative and kept talking to Xia ruofei along the way.

Xia ruofei did not say much to Tony as he was being cautious.

However, Xia ruofei managed to get a lot of information from the conversation.

Tony’s destination was Deca town, which was about ten kilometers ahead. It was also the town that Xia ruofei wanted to find a car in.

Tony had received news that anti – Government militants seemed to be active in Deca town these few days, and he wanted to rush over to get first – hand interview information.

In addition, the situation in wadira seemed to be getting more and more tense. The anti – Government armed forces had hired many international mercenaries to join the battlefield. These mercenary organizations were well – equipped and their members were experienced in combat. The government forces were no match for them at all.

The mercenary group’s Commission was definitely very expensive. The anti – Government armed forces were probably backed by foreign forces to be able to make such a big move. Their purpose was naturally to overthrow the wadira government.

Xia ruofei had also learned from Tony that there were indeed several mercenary groups active in the boetar region. The local government armed forces were also losing ground, and the battlefield had advanced further east.

It was only about ten kilometers from the place where Xia ruofei had gotten into the car to Deca town. In a short while, the town was already in sight.

Tony parked the car at the small square at the entrance of the town and said with a smile,””Brother, I can only give you a lift up to this point. Next, I need to look for interview material!”

“Thank you very much!” Xia ruofei said.

“I wish you good luck!” Tony smiled and said,”we don’t know how long this damn war will last. Remember, staying alive is the first thing. Don’t work too hard for work.”

Xia ruofei could feel Tony’s kindness. He smiled and said,””Alright, you too. Good luck, Tony!”

“Goodbye!” After Xia ruofei got out of the car, Tony grinned at him, waved his hand, and drove off.

Xia ruofei, on the other hand, was walking slowly on the streets of the town with his bag.

The morning in the town was very quiet, as if the haze of war had not infected this place. Some shops had already opened for business, and the pedestrians on the road looked very relaxed.

Xia ruofei looked left and right as he walked, hoping to find a used car shop or a car rental shop.

He did not want to stay here for too long. After he got the car, he would head west and get to the poeta region as soon as possible.

Xia ruofei saw a trading firm and walked over. Usually, people in such places would understand English. He wanted to ask where he could rent a car in town.

At this moment, a violent explosion sounded, Breaking the Silence of the small town.

The people on the street were stunned by the sudden explosion. After a few seconds, screams and cries resounded through the street.

When the explosion occurred, Xia ruofei subconsciously dodged to find a cover and quickly released his spiritual power.

Soon, he found that there were no armed men nearby, and the explosion happened in a coffee shop about 200 meters away. At this time, the entrance of the coffee shop was already in a mess.

Xia ruofei’s mind power detected a Ford SUV parked near the coffee shop. It was the same one Tony had driven.

Although it wasn’t directly attacked, the glass of the Ford off – Road vehicle was completely shattered by the shock wave of the explosion. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but stare. His figure flashed out from his hiding place and he ran quickly in the direction of the coffee shop.
