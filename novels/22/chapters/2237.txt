2238 Entering the mushroom house (2)

“Yeah!” Xia ruofei said.

“That’s good! We’ll try our best to think of a way!” Huang Lei said,”the main problem is the ingredients ... But it doesn’t matter. You’re the guest for the first episode, and this is the only dish you ordered. We’ll satisfy your request even if we have to sell everything we have!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”why does this sound so scary?” You want to sell everything you have to eat pork stew with vermicelli? Why don’t you just sell a kidney?”

He Jiong couldn’t help but burst out laughing when he heard this.

Huang Lei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry as he said,”our living conditions are really tough!” You’ll know when you come over in the morning ... Then ... If you don’t have any other requests, I’ll hang up first!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said,”let’s go!”

Huang Lei hung up the phone. Peng Chang and Zhang Xing quickly came over and asked,””Huang Sensei, do you know who it is?”

Huang Lei revealed a trace of confusion and bitterly smiled,”I really can’t tell. The accent is from the northeast, and the northeast accent is very pure. But the range is too wide ... And I can’t be sure. After all, the northeast accent is relatively easy to imitate ...”

“Brother Xing, do you think ... It could be Brother Sun?” Peng Chang looked at Zhang Xing and asked.

The brother Sun that Peng Chang was talking about was Sun Honglei, the movie star. He was from Northeast China and had a strong northeastern accent. Zhang Xing had also recorded many shows with Sun Honglei, so he should have known him better.

Therefore, Zhang Xing immediately shook his head and said,””It doesn’t sound like Brother sun’s voice. I don’t think so. Otherwise, I would have been able to tell.”

“Teacher he, tell us!” Peng Chang ran over to He Jiong and asked,”who could this guest be?”

He Jiong said with a smile,”I didn’t hear it clearly just now!” This is hard to guess ...”

Huang Lei exposed He Jiong’s lies mercilessly and said,”Come on! You must’ve already known who came today!”

He Jiong put up his hands with an innocent expression and said,”I really don’t know! The director team had done a great job of keeping this a secret! He didn’t reveal anything at all! If you don’t believe me, you can ask director Zhou. Do I even know who the guests are?”

The director of the set was in the room. Once He Jiong finished speaking, one of the cameramen also cooperated by shaking the camera over. Director Zhou immediately nodded with a smile.

“What do you mean by nodding?” Huang Lei asked. Do you know or not?”

He Jiong said from the side,”alright, alright, alright! Why was he so conflicted about this? The guests will be here soon, so let’s quickly discuss how to prepare this ‘rented and stewed vermicelli’!”

Guessing the identity of the guests in the show was a very good thing to watch, so there were all kinds of guessing games in every episode.

At the mushroom house, Huang Lei and he Jiong began to think of ways to prepare the ingredients for the pork stew and vermicelli. At the courtyard at liuhai Lane, Xia ruofei had also completed his task of making a phone call and was ready to set off.

He took out a rimewa aluminum suitcase and put his change of clothes, pajamas, and some daily necessities in it.

These were all prepared in advance the day before. Yingying put all the things he needed in the spirit map space, and it was just for show when he went out to bring his luggage. However, he definitely couldn’t bring an empty box to the recording this time, so he packed up the things he needed to bring today and took them out of the spirit map space yesterday.

Very quickly, Xia ruofei was done preparing his luggage. He dragged his luggage to the front yard and, under the camera’s recording, sat in a Buick luxury business car that the jiumo team had prepared.

Buick was also an important sponsor for this season. All the vehicles used by the festival team were new commercial vehicles launched by Buick. They were still very popular.

Of course, other than providing vehicles for the show, Buick also paid a high advertising fee. In fact, their exposure was not as high as that of paradise company, so their treatment was much worse.

Xia ruofei sat in the most comfortable seat in the middle while a cameraman sat in the front passenger seat with a camera. The cameraman had to continue shooting some material. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

In fact, the car had already been equipped with a high – definition camera, but sometimes they needed to take some close – up shots, so a cameraman was specially in the car.

Qin Yanan, he Yu, Liu Yan, and the other staff members got into several other cars and then drove out of the liuhai Lane courtyard house.

The car headed out of the city.

Because they had set off earlier, the morning peak in the capital had not yet formed. Although there was a little traffic on the road, the overall speed was still acceptable, and they did not encounter a situation where all the roads were blocked.

The convoy drove for more than 40 minutes before finally leaving the Main City and heading towards little Tang town. They were driving much faster.

Along the way, Xia ruofei looked at the scenery outside the window with great interest. When he was in the mood, he would talk to the audience through the camera, acting very naturally.

Soon, the convoy arrived at little Tang town. When they passed by the hot spring resort not far from the peach blossom Association, Xia ruofei could not help but look out the window.

He saw that the piece of land that they had bid for back then was now very different.

On this side, many workers could be seen busy at the construction site, and some trucks were in and out transporting construction materials.

When the car drove off the main road and turned a corner to the other side of the Paradise gathering, the scenery changed again.

Xia ruofei saw that the construction in this direction was basically completed. With just a glance, he could roughly distinguish the layout and planning of the clubhouse. After all, Xia ruofei had seen the design plan. With his current level of brain development, he would naturally not forget it as long as he had seen it.

Not far away, the surface of the lake was sparkling, and there were a few small and exquisite villas by the lake.

Xia ruofei paid special attention. At the location he had specified, which was the relic, a villa had been built. From the outside, the villa was basically completed. The decoration of the outer wall was also done.

His gaze moved from the lakeside to the inside of the club, and he soon saw the mushroom house.

In fact, there were two buildings here. One of them was a small two – story building that took up an area of about 500 to 600 square meters. It was the mushroom house where the show would be filmed. Behind the mushroom house was another building, which was the station of the program team. There were dormitories for the staff and a studio with optical fiber. It was equivalent to the Logistics Support Center of the program team.

The car stopped about two hundred meters away from the mushroom house.

The electric car door opened slowly with a beeping sound. Xia ruofei got out of the car, went to the back, opened the trunk, and took out his suitcase.

The cameramen had already chosen their positions and started shooting.

There was also a cameraman carrying a camera on his shoulder. He was to follow and film the entire journey.

Xia ruofei dragged his luggage and walked along the asphalt road towards the mushroom house. As he walked, he said to the camera beside him,””I didn’t expect this place to change so much in just a few months! I’ve told you that the scenery here in little Tang town is as beautiful as a painting, and it’ll be fine with a little construction! Now it seems that my eyes are quite accurate! Now, this place has become a paradise ...”

After he finished speaking, Xia ruofei even revealed a smug smile.

In the later stages, the festival team would definitely add some subtitles to tell the audience that this was actually a leisure entertainment club and that Xia ruofei was the major shareholder. Then, with some special effects, it would immediately become a topic of discussion and satisfy the audience’s curiosity.

Xia ruofei dragged his suitcase and walked to the bottom of the mushroom house. The mushroom house was on higher ground so the view was quite good. In front of him was a beautiful lake, so the shooting effect was quite good.

Xia ruofei carried his luggage and walked up more than 20 stone steps. He came to the wooden door of the mushroom house and knocked on it. Then, he asked loudly,””Is anyone home? Is there anyone there?”
