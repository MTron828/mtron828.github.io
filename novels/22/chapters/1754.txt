Chapter 1755: Qingxue goes to the capital (2)

“Wei Jun,” Xia ruofei reminded him,”when you go to the design company tomorrow to scan, remember to cover the signature.”

Elder song’s inscription was quite sensitive. If the whole picture was scanned, it would be equivalent to leaving an electronic draft in the design company. With Xia ruofei’s attentiveness, he would not leave such a hidden danger.

“Alright, I’ll remember that, brother Xia!” Wei Jun quickly nodded.

“Also, this piece of calligraphy is very precious. Remember to be careful when you take it tomorrow. Don’t break it. I still have to treasure it!” Xia ruofei ordered.

“I understand! Brother Xia, don’t worry! As long as the person lives, the word lives!” Wei Jun immediately patted his chest and promised.

Song Rui said sourly,””I also want to keep one of grandpa’s calligraphy works ...”

Xia ruofei, Zhao Yongjun, and the others were stunned for a moment, then burst into laughter ...

Then, everyone talked about the progress of the tasks they were responsible for. It had to be said that everyone was very efficient.

In fact, the of the Paradise Club was already half designed. However, after getting elder song’s inscription, the design at the front was naturally invalid.

Xu Zixuan was in charge of contacting the construction party, and it had basically been decided. This project was a cooperation between his brothers, and there was no preparation for any bidding. In fact, the construction party found by Xu Zixuan’s own network was more reliable than a formal bidding.

Naturally, Hou Liang was the one in charge of the media. Because of his family background, he had a unique advantage, and contacting the media was always a success.

Liu Jian was in charge of the conference company, including the layout of the groundbreaking ceremony, the scheduling of the audio LED and other equipment, the deduction of the on – site process, and so on. Everything was going according to plan in an orderly manner.

In addition, the work of contacting the guests was also going smoothly.

It had to be said that the power of Zhao Yong Jun, song Rui, Xu Zi Xuan and the others combined was not to be underestimated. In the upper circle of the capital, unless it was someone like Liu Hao Fan who was obviously not on good terms with them, the others would basically give them face regardless of their camp.

Therefore, in just three days, more than half of the preparations for the groundbreaking ceremony had been completed.

Xia ruofei and the others discussed for a while. There were three days left to prepare. Everyone tried their best to think of all the problems that needed to be thought of and did not leave any loopholes.

When it was time for dinner, everyone naturally stayed in the courtyard house and continued to freeload.

The food was also ordered from a nearby private restaurant. Zhao Yongjun and the others had their eyes on Xia ruofei’s good wine.

However, Xia ruofei did not relent and insisted that there was not a single bottle left.

Xia ruofei’s oak barrel was a standard 225 – liter barrel, and it was filled into 750 ml bottles, which was about 300 bottles. The total amount was quite a lot, but it was not completely cooked yet, and Xia ruofei did not want to waste it.

In fact, Xia ruofei didn’t want to touch the rest of the wine for the time being. He wanted to wait for them to mature in the spiritual Qi – rich space. After all, he had used up six bottles of wine during the gathering and gave three to elder song and manager Lu this afternoon.

300 bottles might seem like a lot, but if he didn’t control it, it would be consumed very quickly.

Of course, Xia ruofei would not be stingy with his friends. They did not have any in Semillon, but they had enough of the treasured Drunken Eight Immortals.

The 50 – year – old wine was rare, but now that Xia ruofei had the time array flag, it would be easy to make it. It would only take a few days.

Zhao Yongjun did not have any objections. He had always liked strong spirits, but the unique taste of Semillon had always been on his mind. Since Xia ruofei could not get more Semillon, in his opinion, the top – tier Drunken Eight Immortals was naturally the best.

In the evening, the few of them finished six bottles of Drunken Eight Immortals. Each bottle of Drunken Eight Immortals was even better than the limited – supply of the top – tier Drunken Eight Immortals, which cost 8888 Yuan per bottle. Of course, Xia ruofei did not feel the slightest bit of heartache.

On average, everyone drank nearly a pound of wine, so everyone naturally stayed in the courtyard for the night.

Now, no matter if it was song Rui or Xu Zixuan’s family, as long as they heard that they were staying over at Xia ruofei’s place, they would not have any objections. The elders in the family were even more happy to see the brothers working together on a project.

The next day, other than Xia ruofei, the brothers started to split up again. Wei Jun, under Xia ruofei’s repeated instructions, also took the inscription by elder song.

In the blink of an eye, another two days had passed. Tomorrow was the foundation laying ceremony of the peach blossom society. If everything went well, Xia ruofei would return to the three mountains after the foundation laying ceremony.

In the evening, Xia ruofei arrived at the Capital International Airport.

He had driven here alone without Wu Qiang’s company.

Because Xia ruofei was here to pick up someone, and the person he was going to pick up was Ling Qingxue. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Ling Ji F & B also had a share in the Paradise gathering project. For such a big event like the groundbreaking ceremony, even if Ling Ji F & B had a small share, they still had to send people to attend.

Originally, Ling Xiaotian had sent a Vice President over, because Ling Qingxue had been busy with the opening of the branch chain, and Ling Xiaotian was now in a semi – Retired state, so he was not very willing to go out.

In the end, Ling Qingxue put aside her work and decided to go to the capital herself.

Ling Xiaotian naturally did not object to Ling Qingxue’s decision, and Xia ruofei welcomed it with open arms.

Xia ruofei ordered a cup of cabbino at the airport’s café and sat down to rest for a while. When he heard the announcement that Ling Qingxue’s flight had landed, he stood up and walked towards the domestic departure channel.

After waiting for about ten minutes, Xia ruofei saw Ling Qingxue coming down from the escalator, dragging a rimewa aluminum suitcase.

Ling Qingxue was wearing a beige knitted sweater and a pink down jacket that draped over her arms. Her figure was curvaceous, and she matched it with a pair of slim – fit jeans that complemented her iconic long legs. She also had a black baseball cap on her head, which made her look playful and charming.

Perhaps it was the telepathic connection between lovers, Ling Qingxue also saw Xia ruofei in the crowd at the airport. She excitedly took off her baseball cap and waved it at Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei was all smiles as he stood in front of the No – go zone, watching Ling Qingxue walk out. They were a few meters apart when Ling Qingxue dropped her luggage and threw herself into Xia ruofei’s arms like a swallow returning to its nest.

Xia ruofei hugged Ling Qingxue’s soft body and reached out to stroke her black hair. He said lovingly,””Qingxue, you’ve had a long journey!”

Ling Qingxue hugged Xia ruofei tightly and asked,””Did you miss me?”

“I’m going crazy!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”let’s go! I’ll take you home!”

Ling Qingxue pouted and said,”no!” Let me hug you for a while longer ...”

“The others are watching!”

“I don’t care ...”

In fact, separation and reuniting were the two eternal themes of the airport. It happened every day. Scenes of hugging, waving, and kissing goodbye were common. No one looked at them strangely. Instead, they smiled kindly.

Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue were indeed a good match, almost in line with all the traditional standards of a perfect couple. Naturally, it was easier for them to receive blessings from strangers.

Ling Qingxue hugged him for a while more before she got out of Xia ruofei’s arms, a little embarrassed. She blushed as she looked at the people around her and held Xia ruofei’s arm tightly.

Xia ruofei, on the other hand, brought Ling Qingxue along and walked over with a smile to retrieve their luggage. The two of them walked towards the airport’s parking lot.

Along the way, Ling Qingxue held onto Xia ruofei’s arm tightly and pressed her body against his as if she was afraid that Xia ruofei would run away.

After they got into the land Rover, Xia ruofei started the engine and looked at Ling Qingxue with a pampering expression.””Qingxue, you didn’t eat well on the plane, did you? How about I take you to eat roast duck? There’s a cheap place near our house, and the food there is really good!”
