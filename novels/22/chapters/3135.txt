“Yes!” Wang Shan replied respectfully. Great elder!”

He bowed slightly to Chen Xuan before leaving the room.

“Brother Chen, come, have some tea!” Xia ruofei smiled as he pushed the teacup in front of Chen Xuan.

“Thank you!” Chen Xuan smiled and said,”so brother Xia is already the Grand Elder of the star Seizer sect! From what I know, the Grand Elder of the star Seizer sect is an honorary position, and it has been vacant for many years. ”

“It’s all sect leader Luo’s fault ...”Xia ruofei smiled.

Chen Xuan looked at Xia ruofei meaningfully and did not continue asking. Instead, he changed the topic and asked,””Brother Xia, have you finished the preparations? Is there anything you need me to do?”

Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand.”It’s just to ensure everyone’s food, accommodation, and transportation. We’ve also reserved a small conference room for communication. What do I need you to do?” I’ve booked five of these luxury suites. You and I will each have one suite, and there are three more left. If there are more than three sect Masters or elders in soaring Flower Valley and surging waves sect, we can open more at any time. We’ve also reserved the rooms for the people they might bring with them. ”

“Thank you for your hard work, brother Xia!” Chen Xuan said.

“Brother Chen, do you want to take a look at the conference room?” Xia ruofei asked,”after all, you’re the real host. Do you want me to accompany you to the venue?”

“No need, no need, no need!” Chen Xuan waved his hand and said,”how can I not trust brother Xia when he’s handling this? Besides, I don’t usually deal with these things, so I can’t see anything special about it!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”then don’t look at it. I don’t know anything about it. It’s all arranged by my subordinates!” Let’s have some tea and chat!”

Of course, the main reason Xia ruofei had called Chen Xuan over overnight was to consider the possibility that the soaring Flower Valley and the surging waves sect would rush over to the three mountains at night. As the one who had gathered them, it would be inappropriate if Chen Xuan did not welcome them at the hotel.

Of course, reality proved that he had worried too much. The people from soaring Flower Valley and surging waves sect didn’t come.

The next morning, Xia ruofei and Chen Xuan had breakfast together at the hotel’s buffet.

The eight disciples of the star Seizer sect also finished their breakfast as quickly as possible.

Qin Yanan had also rushed to the hotel with the two young ladies from the assistant team.

However, they were mainly in charge of coordinating with the hotel. If Xia ruofei had any needs, they would coordinate with the hotel immediately.

As for the work of reception, they would naturally not be allowed to come into contact with it.

For this, Xia ruofei had specially reserved two rooms as work rooms for Qin Yanan and the others to be on standby in the rooms.

After breakfast, Xia ruofei and Chen Xuan went to the hotel lobby and sat down on the sofa.

Wang Shan and the others were also divided into two groups. Four of them went to the small conference room to do some preparation work, while the other four stayed by Xia ruofei’s side to wait for orders.

At around nineo’ clock in the morning, Xia ruofei and Chen Xuan looked up at the entrance of the hotel at the same time. Then, they stood up at the same time and walked out quickly to welcome him. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

At the entrance, the valley master of the soaring Flower Valley, Liu Mansha, and her disciple, Yu xiner, both wore modern clothes as they strode into the hotel lobby.

Although they had changed out of their Palace robes, the two of them still looked as magnificent as ever. Whether it was Liu Mansha’s mature beauty or Yu xiner’s pure and pleasant appearance, they both made people’s hearts beat faster.

They looked like a pair of sisters. If one was not from the world of cultivation, one would not believe that Liu Mansha, who looked like a beautiful young woman in her early thirties, was actually an old woman in her seventies or eighties.

In fact, as soon as the two of them entered the hotel, they immediately attracted a lot of attention, and the number of people turning their heads was quite high.

As Xia ruofei walked towards Liu Mansha, he nodded to himself. It seemed like Chen Nanfeng was not lying. Besides, he was very influential. Liu Mansha’s group only consisted of two people. With her status as the valley master, it was definitely a simple task.

Especially since she was the only golden core cultivator, it was obvious that she was actively responding to Chen Nanfeng’s proposal.

“Valley master Liu, long time no see. You’re still as elegant as ever!” Chen Xuan greeted with a smile.

“So it’s nephew Chen.” A smile appeared on Liu Mansha’s cold face.”Fellow Daoist Xia is also here!”

Qin Yanan and the others had already returned to their rooms to wait for orders, so Xia ruofei had also changed his appearance to look like Xia Tian. Liu Mansha had a deep impression of Xia ruofei during the auction and had even bought the spiritual power cultivation technique “the truth of glittering jewels” from Xia ruofei. She had been studying the truth of glittering jewels for a while and had benefited a lot in terms of spiritual power. Hence, she had a good impression of Xia ruofei and naturally recognized him at a glance.

“Valley master Liu, you’ve had a long journey!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Yu Xin ‘er also greeted him,”Xin’ er greets young sect leader Chen!” Greetings ... Xia ... Senior ...”

Xia ruofei quickly waved his hand.”I don’t deserve the title ‘senior.’ Miss Xin ‘er, you can call me by my name. Or, you can call me fellow Daoist Xia.”

“You can also call him elder Xia,” Chen Xuan added. Brother Xia is now the Grand Elder of the star Seizer sect. ”

Liu Mansha was not surprised by this. She smiled and said,”Then I must congratulate fellow Daoist Xia!”

Yu Xin ‘er also bowed slightly and said,””Xin ‘er greets elder Xia.”

“Miss Xin ‘er is too polite!” Xia ruofei hurriedly said,”by the way, the Dao friends from the surging waves sect have yet to arrive. Valley master Liu and miss Xin ‘er, why don’t you go to your room and rest first?” Everything has been arranged. ”

“The specific matters of this exchange meeting were all arranged by brother Xia. He’s a local tyrant in the three mountains!” Chen Xuan chimed in.

Liu Mansha looked at Xia ruofei in surprise, then nodded slightly and said,””Then I’ll have to trouble fellow Daoist Xia.”

“Where? It’s no trouble at all!” Xia ruofei said.

Then, he beckoned Wang Shan over and said,””Wang Shan, this is Valley Head Liu Mansha from the soaring Flower Valley. This is Valley Head Liu’s beloved disciple, miss Yu xiner. Please bring the two of them to their rooms to rest!”

“Wang Shan, disciple of the star Seizer sect, greets Valley master Liu and miss Xin ‘er!” Wang Shan quickly bowed and greeted. Please follow me!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Valley master Liu, miss Xin ‘er, the fellow Daoists from the surging waves sect have yet to arrive. Brother Chen and I will have to wait here for a while. We won’t be able to accompany the two of you upstairs.”

“Fellow Daoist Xia is too polite. You don’t need to worry about me.” Liu Mansha smiled and said,”we can help ourselves!”
