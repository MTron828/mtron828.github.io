Chapter 1711: Chapter 979 – kindness and rebirth (2)

“Really?” Tang Haoran was both surprised and happy.

He could only sense that the spiritual Qi in the spirit crystal was very rich, but he did not expect it to be so rich to this extent. The total amount of spiritual Qi required to cultivate to Qi disciple Level 5 and above was quite terrifying. This small spirit crystal actually contained so much spiritual Qi?

Xia ruofei reminded her again,”but you have to be aware that haste makes waste. You can’t absorb spiritual energy for more than four hours a day. You’re still young and your cultivation is still low. It’s time to build a solid foundation. You can’t rush it. Do you understand?”

It was the same four hours, but it was completely different from when he could only cultivate for four hours at midnight and dawn.

First of all, he had more freedom to choose the time.

More importantly, the spiritual energy contained in the spiritual crystal was extremely rich. It was on a completely different level compared to the small amount of spiritual energy that was drifting in the air.

Therefore, the same four hours of cultivation would definitely have a world of difference in effect.

Xia ruofei reminded Tang Haoran because he was worried that Tang Haoran would lose his self – restraint after using spiritual crystals to cultivate.

It was not good to do anything without restraint.

It was the same for cultivation. To Tang Haoran, it might not be a good thing if he cultivated too quickly. The height of a building depended more on the stability of the foundation.

The current Tang Haoran was at a crucial time to build his Foundation.

Tang Haoran now regarded Xia ruofei as a God, so he naturally said respectfully,””I’ll remember it, master!”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and reminded her,””You should keep the spiritual crystals well. It’s best not to show them in front of others. Even Li Yifu shouldn’t know about it.”

Although there were very few cultivators now, Xia ruofei was worried that Tang Haoran would happen to meet one. If he saw such a treasure like the spiritual crystals, would he not be tempted by it?

As for hiding it from Li Yifu, Xia ruofei didn’t think much of it. After all, money could move people. Spiritual crystals were unimaginably attractive to cultivators in such a harsh cultivation environment. Since he wasn’t going to give Li Yifu the spiritual crystals, there was no need to test his humanity with them.

“I know, master!” Tang Haoran was like a little adult as he said seriously,”don’t worry! I usually put it in my dad’s safe and take it out when I cultivate ...”

“Good idea!” Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.

“Master, can I use it to cultivate for a while now?” Tang Haoran continued.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”you’re so eager?” But I advise you to wait a little longer. I can see that you’re about to break through today. When the time comes, master will protect you! I’d better put the crystals away for now! My adopted husband should be done with his cultivation soon. ”

Tang Haoran tilted his head and thought for a while before saying,””Alright then!”

Then, he handed the crystals to Tang Yitian and said,””Dad! I’m giving it to you! You must keep it well!”

Tang Yitian didn’t dare to neglect him. He forced a smile and said,””This really is a hot potato! RUO Fei, you go over there and chat with Jennifer and the others first. I’ll go and keep the treasure!”

Then, Tang Yitian carefully took the crystals and went upstairs.

Xia ruofei brought Tang Haoran through the living room to the back garden. Xu Ziyuan, Jennifer, and Feng Rao were sitting in the garden, making tea and chatting. When they saw the two of them, they stood up to greet them.

“Xia, where’s Ethan? Isn’t he waiting for you over there?” Jennifer asked.

“Big brother Tang has something to do. He’ll be right over!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Xu Ziyuan could not help but ask,”eh? Mr. Xia, why is third uncle not out yet?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”uncle Xu, my adopted husband has gained some insight. He might need some time to digest and absorb it ...”

“Mr. Xia, please don’t call me that ...” Xu Ziyuan quickly said.

“Didn’t we agree on this?”Xia ruofei laughed. Let’s discuss our own matters!”

“That may be true, but your seniority is too scary. Strictly speaking, the Australian Association of righteous people can be considered a branch of the Hong sect ...” Xu Ziyuan said with a bitter smile.

Xia ruofei waved his hand.”The Hong sect is the Hong sect. My sworn husband is my sworn husband. My relationship with his master has nothing to do with the Hong sect.” “Uncle Xu, don’t feel pressured. It’s good for everyone to talk about their own things. I don’t want to act like an old man in my twenties, a bunch of white – bearded juniors ...”

Jennifer and Feng Rao could not help but laugh when they heard that.

At this time, Tang Yitian had already put away the crystals. He strode over and said with a smile,””What are you guys talking about? You’re smiling so happily!”

Xia ruofei smiled and pointed at Xu Ziyuan.””I’m discussing seniority with uncle Xu! He felt that my seniority was giving him a lot of pressure ...”

Tang Yitian forced a smile and said,”don’t mention uncle Xu, I’m also under a lot of pressure.” Ruofei, you’ve become Grandpa Li’s martial granduncle without a sound, and even little Haoran has become Grandpa Li’s martial granduncle. It’s really hard for us to accept this for a while ...”

“Then we’ll slowly get used to it!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I didn’t know it would be such a coincidence to find a branch of my master in Australia that has been wandering around for three generations ... Actually, I didn’t want to, but look at my adopted husband. If I don’t agree, he’ll probably kill himself ...”

Tang Yitian couldn’t help but smile bitterly when he saw that Li Yifu, the leader of the Hong sect, was being insulted by Xia ruofei.

After chatting for a while, they heard footsteps.

Xia ruofei looked up and saw Li Yifu walking quickly towards them. Xia ruofei’s eyes narrowed slightly, revealing a glimmer of light.

He could already tell that Li Yifu’s true energy was reserved, and it seemed to be a little different from before.

Xia ruofei suddenly had a thought. Could he have broken through just now? It seemed that he was quite talented!

Xia ruofei did not know that Li Yifu had been stuck at the third level of the Qi refining stage for decades. The accumulation of these decades was actually quite terrifying. The breakthrough this time was also the result of his accumulation and not Li Yifu’s amazing talent.

Xia ruofei’s guess was right. Li Yifu quickly walked in front of Xia ruofei and knelt down without a word. Before Xia ruofei could react, he kowtowed three times.

Then, Li Yifu raised his head and said with tears of gratitude,””Many thanks to martial granduncle’s guidance, allowing this disciple to break through the bottleneck! Senior granduncle’s kindness to this disciple is the same!”

Xia ruofei calmly accepted Li Yifu’s three kowtows and then said indifferently,””Stand up and talk!”

“Yes!” Li Yifu stood up respectfully.

At this time, Tang Yitian and the others were all stunned, especially Jennifer and Feng Rao who had previously avoided the scene. The scene of a 90 – year – old man kowtowing to Xia ruofei was quite a big shock.

“Give me your hand!” Xia ruofei said.

Li Yifu stretched out his left hand without hesitation. Xia ruofei put his hand on Li Yifu’s pulse and then injected his genuine Qi and spiritual energy into his body at the same time.

In fact, this was very dangerous for cultivators, especially when Xia ruofei’s cultivation was higher than Li Yifu ‘s. If he allowed his genuine Qi and mental energy to enter his meridians, he would become a fish on the chopping board. If Xia ruofei wanted to, he could cripple Li Yifu with a single thought.

Moreover, even if Xia ruofei did not have any evil intentions, Li Yifu’s cultivation technique would be exposed under such investigation. Although it was unlikely to restore the complete cultivation technique, many secrets would be discovered by the other party.

However, Li Yifu did not hesitate or resist at all. He allowed Xia ruofei to inspect him, which showed his respect and trust in Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei closed his eyes. After a while, he opened them and said,””He really broke through! Foster husband, since you’ve broken through, you should seize the time to consolidate your realm. What are you doing out here at this time?”

Li Yifu said respectfully,”senior granduncle, disciple’s mood is in turmoil after breaking through. It’s no longer suitable for me to continue cultivating. Furthermore, senior granduncle’s kindness to disciple is as heavy as a mountain. Disciple must thank senior granduncle at the first possible moment!”

Xia ruofei smiled and shook his head.””Since we’re from the same sect, and you still call me martial granduncle, then there’s no need to pay attention to these superficial formalities! Alright, since you’re already out, let’s sit for a while! Consolidate your realm immediately after you’ve calmed down!”

“Yes! Senior granduncle!” Li Yifu said respectfully.

Xia ruofei nodded and suddenly thought of something. He said,””There’s one more thing, foster husband ...” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Yes!” Li Yifu replied without hesitation.”If senior granduncle has any instructions, this disciple will definitely go through water and tread on fire without hesitation!”
