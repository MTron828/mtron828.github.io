Chapter 3525: First meeting gift (2)

Translator: 549690339

Deacon Liu was also very envious of the spirit crystals with extremely rich spiritual energy.

Xia ruofei seemed to see through attendant Liu’s thoughts. He snorted coldly and increased the pressure of his spiritual power. Attendant Liu immediately felt a heavy burden on her body, especially the pressure on several acupuncture points. In the blink of an eye, she could feel the muffled sound of those acupuncture points.

Deacon Liu couldn’t help but spit out a large mouthful of blood. Immediately after, she discovered to her horror that her body seemed to be leaking air as true Qi continuously leaked out from that damaged acupuncture point. She hurriedly circulated her cultivation technique in an attempt to control it, but she discovered that the true Qi in her dantian had completely lost control, and she couldn’t circulate her cultivation technique at all. This was because those acupuncture points were the necessary points for her to circulate her Qi. If she broke these key acupuncture points, she wouldn’t be able to cultivate at all.

Deacon Liu’s face was as white as a sheet of paper, and his heart was filled with despair.

It was obvious that this senior did not even show his face and had already crippled her with his spiritual pressure.

If the damaged acupuncture points couldn’t be repaired, she wouldn’t be able to cultivate from now on, and her current realm would continue to fall. It wouldn’t be long before she was like an ordinary person.

He might even be weaker than an ordinary person.

Xia ruofei said indifferently,”as a cultivator, you try to bully the weak. You use the methods of a cultivator to deal with ordinary people and take their assets. This is a taboo in the world of cultivators. You should be clear about it!” I’ll give you a light punishment today. I hope you can remember this lesson!”

Deacon Liu sat down dejectedly and said weakly,””Yes! Thank you for sparing my life, senior … I won’t dare to do it again …”

Xia ruofei said coldly,”this is also a warning!” That spiritual crystal and the cultivation technique are my first meeting gifts to this little girl. It’s also an opportunity for her. 1 don’t want anyone to covet these two things after seeing the money! This is especially true for the inner circle of your sect. Go back and tell them that if anyone tries to snatch her fortune, then there is no need for the water element sect to exist! I will personally trample your sect to the ground! You can tell Shen Hu my exact words!”

“Yes! Yes! Yes!” How could Deacon Liu dare to have any other thoughts? Her only hope now was that the injuries to her acupuncture points were not too serious and that there was still hope for recovery. Otherwise, her path of cultivation would be completely cut off.

After a moment of silence, Xia ruofei had an idea.

Deacon Liu and Lu You, who were in the carriage, only saw a blur before their eyes. A brilliant sword light appeared in front of them in the blink of an eye. Then, it circled around the carriage at an extremely fast speed and then flew away.

The entire process was extremely short, but it was shocking.

Lu You and Deacon Liu didn’t even dare to breathe. After the sword light disappeared for a moment, an invisible force lifted the roof of the car and threw it into the farmland hundreds of meters away.

Deacon Liu and Lu You only realized then that the flying sword had made a quick circle and cut off the roof of the car. However, because the flying sword was extremely sharp and the force used was also very clever, the two of them did not notice it at all. It was only after the roof of the car was lifted that the two of them noticed the smooth cut.

Lu You was still fine, but Deacon Liu kept quiet out of fear. If that senior had not used his mental energy to suppress her but had used his flying sword to deal with her, she was afraid that even if she had a hundred heads, it would not be enough to cut her.

Furthermore, Xia ruofei’s display of skill had confirmed one thing – he was at least a cultivator in the Golden core stage. Only cultivators in the Golden core stage and above could control sword techniques and flying swords.

The method just now was definitely not something that could be accomplished by simply using mental power to capture the flying sword. There must be a special Sword Art that could make the flying sword so fast and so flexible to control. It was simply like controlling the fingers.

After Xia ruofei’s strength had been proven, attendant Liu no longer had any other thoughts. The sect leader of the water element sect, Shen Hu, had the highest level of cultivation. He was only at the ninth level of the Qi refinement realm. This senior was at least an Aurous core stage cultivator. This meant that he had an absolute advantage over Xia ruofei in terms of cultivation. This also showed that when he said that he would destroy the entire water element sect, he was not boasting. He could do it easily.

After Xia ruofei showed off his skills, he said indifferently,””If you think that your neck is harder than the roof of the car or even my flying sword, you can try to snatch Lu You’s opportunity. That’s all I have to say! Good luck!”

After Xia ruofei said this, Deacon Liu and Lu You could clearly feel that the spiritual pressure had disappeared.

Could it be that this senior had left? Deacon Liu still didn’t even dare to breathe. Her back was already drenched in cold sweat. On the one hand, it was from the pain, but more so from the shock.

After a long time, Deacon Liu tentatively called out,””Senior … Senior …”

There was no sound.

After a while, Deacon Liu finally let out a long sigh of relief. His entire body was paralyzed as he sat in the back seat of the business vehicle that no longer had a roof, gasping for breath.

Lu You was dumbfounded from the beginning to the end. She hadn’t been in contact with cultivation for a long time. Back then, the cultivator who had recruited her from the water element sect had also revealed a few of his skills as a cultivator in front of her before she was willing to give it a try. Back then, she had more or less had some doubts and was worried that she had met a swindler who knew magic.

It wasn’t until she entered the sect and was taught the basic cultivation techniques that she gradually found the sense of Qi and began to sense the existence of spiritual energy. She also began to try to absorb weak spiritual energy. In addition, she also saw more methods of cultivators. Only then did she believe that there were really cultivators. There was a cultivation world that was completely different from the ordinary world. It was as if she saw the door to a new world with extraordinary splendor slowly opening.

However, her first experience in the cultivation world was far from as shocking as what she saw tonight.

The pressure of pure mental energy could make an ‘expert’ like Deacon Liu bleed. Moreover, the appearance of the flying sword had completely overturned Lu You’s understanding.

The water element sect was, after all, a very small sect. There was not even a single cultivator in the Golden core stage in the sect. Lu You was a newbie who had just entered the sect. She had never heard of the techniques of the Golden core stage.

After witnessing it today, Lu You was shocked. At the same time, she was even more eager to become stronger.

It was only after that ‘senior’ left without a sound that Lu You slowly regained her senses. She looked at Deacon Liu, who was pale, with a complicated expression and asked,””Deacon Liu, you …”

To be honest, Lu You was a little disappointed with the sect. She had seen a lot of deception in the past few months. If those were still within the range of her tolerance, then Deacon Liu’s unhesitating action of pushing her to take the blame tonight had completely disappointed her.

However, she was still a disciple of the water Yuan sect. Furthermore, attendant Liu’s injuries seemed to be quite serious. Out of consideration for the People’s Dao, she still had to show some concern.

As for what would happen in the future, that was a matter for the future. Anyway, Lu You would definitely not really open her heart to Deacon Liu. Furthermore, when she returned to the sect, she would be very careful. She would only speak thirty percent of her words to everyone and not completely open her heart to him.

Deacon Liu had a complicated expression on her face. She looked at the spirit crystals and the water element Scripture in Lu You’s hands and said weakly,””Lu You, the two things that senior gave you are very precious. You should keep them first! If other cultivators see this, they’ll inevitably have evil thoughts … My injuries are very serious now, and your cultivation is very low, so it’s very difficult for you to keep these two things.”

Upon hearing this, Lu You nodded and stuffed the spirit crystals and cultivation techniques into her bag. She hesitated for a moment before asking,””Deacon Liu, are you … Also …”

Manager Liu forced a smile and said,”I admit that when I saw the spiritual crystals and the cultivation technique, I also had other thoughts. But… I was severely punished by that senior just because 1 had such a thought.. Don’t worry! With senior’s words, no one in the sect would dare to steal your things, not even the sect master!”
