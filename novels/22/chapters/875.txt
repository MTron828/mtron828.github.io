Chapter 876: The arrival of an honored guest (3)

Translator: 549690339

This private room was not only decorated in an antique style, but it was also the largest room. Its location was also quite good. Through the window, one could admire the bamboo forest in the courtyard and the Lotus leaves on the pond. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Although the private room in the afternoon was not as tense as the one in the evening, it was obvious that he Feng had put in a lot of effort.

When the two of them entered the private room, a classical beauty in a blue and white porcelain style cheongsam immediately came over to make tea and serve them.

Xia ruofei and he Feng sat at the tea table in front of the window. Opposite them was a quiet beauty in a cheongsam who was making tea very elegantly. The faint fragrance of tea floated in the room, and they could hear the faint sound of guzheng music. In such an environment, they suddenly felt relaxed.

He Feng was just chatting with Xia ruofei. He did not try to find out Xia ruofei’s identity or his relationship with song Qiming. He was just looking for topics that Xia ruofei was interested in, so the atmosphere was very harmonious.

It was about Teno’ clock when the two of them arrived at the West River Moon Club. Time slipped away quietly as they drank tea and chatted.

When it was close to 11 O’ clock, Xia ruofei heard some noise coming from outside the door.

The room’s sound insulation was pretty good. He Feng did not hear anything, but Xia ruofei’s hearing was much better than the average person ‘s, so he could hear everything.

A young voice said in dissatisfaction,””President Zheng, what do you mean? Is it because I, yang Jianren, don’t have face? Wasn’t it just a private room? Won’t I give you a straightforward answer!”

Then, Xia ruofei heard President Zheng’s voice,””Young master yang, all the customers here are our members. Our customers are our Kings. The moonlight lotus pond club has indeed been booked in advance, and the guests have already arrived ...”

“Then Let’s Switch!” Yang Jianren said indifferently,”I heard that there are only two guests here. Isn’t it a waste to use such a big room for two people?”

“This ... This might not be appropriate ...” President Zheng had already understood that the Lotus pond moonlight private room was reserved by the leader of the Bell Tower District, so he was very embarrassed.

Yang Jianren said casually,”what’s inappropriate about that?” Do you know who we’re inviting today? He’s a very important leader. I’m not trying to scare you, but one word from this leader and your club will be closed ...”

“Yes, yes, yes. I’m relying on the help of all the noble people here ...” President Zheng said.

Yang Jianren raised his voice and said,””President Zheng, go in and tell the people inside to change to another room. Just say my name ...”

“This ...”

“You’re not going? Then I’ll go by myself!” Yang Jianren said with a cold snort.

“Don ‘t, don’ t, don’t be angry, young master yang ...” President Zheng quickly said,”I ... I’ll try ...”

Then, Xia ruofei heard President Zheng’s footsteps approaching.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but shake his head. It was not easy to do business these days! President Zheng usually had a wide circle of friends, and this club was doing very well, but the hardships behind it were not something that could be explained to outsiders.

Just as Xia ruofei was sighing, President Zheng came to the door and knocked on it.

President Zheng’s face had a trace of guilt. As soon as he entered the door, he said,””Mayor he, No...”

President Zheng stopped in the middle of his sentence because he saw Xia ruofei looking at him with a smile.

He only knew that he Feng had booked the room from the information he received, but he never expected that the guest he Feng was inviting was Xia ruofei.

“President Xia!” President Zheng said in surprise,”why didn’t you tell me you were coming? I was wondering why the Magpies kept chirping today!”

“President Zheng, do you know Mr. Xia?” he Feng asked, surprised.

“Yes, I do. I’m old friends with President Zheng ...” Xia ruofei said, smiling.

“Yes, yes, yes. Old friend, old friend ...” President Zheng said with a smile.

Xia ruofei looked at the door and asked,””By the way, what’s the matter, President Zheng?”

Only then did President Zheng remember that there was a difficult master waiting outside the door! He quickly weighed the pros and cons, then gritted his teeth and said with a smile,””It’s nothing, I just heard that District head he was coming over, so I came to say hello. I didn’t expect President Xia to be here too! Well ... You guys chat, I’ll come over to propose a toast later!”

President Zheng nodded at Xia ruofei and he Feng and left the room.

As soon as President Zheng came out, yang Jianren, who was waiting not far away, asked noisily,””What do you think, elder Zheng? will it work if you use my name?”

President Zheng sighed to himself, then made up his mind and said,””Young master yang, I’m sorry ...”
