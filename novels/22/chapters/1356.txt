Chapter 1357: You are always too soft – hearted (1)

Translator: 549690339

It was quite embarrassing to be beaten up instead of acting tough.

Although one million Yuan made Tian Xiaojun and the others ‘hearts ache, it was not a serious injury. However, they were in this circle and they cared about their face the most. Moreover, if they had to spread this news everywhere, it would be worse than killing them.

Xia ruofei knew the mentality of these rich men like the back of his hand. He stared at Tian Xiaojun with a burning gaze and said,”Is there a need to be so difficult?”

“Young master Xia, we ... We ... Can’t you change your condition?” Tian Xiaojun said with a long face. Why don’t we ... Pay more?”

If they really couldn’t do it, they could ask their families for help. It wouldn’t be a problem even if they took out an extra million Yuan. However, it was a little hard for them to announce it in their circle.

Xia ruofei frowned and said,”Tian Xiaojun, is your brain frozen?” You’re actually haggling with me?”

“I wouldn’t dare, I wouldn’t dare, young master Xia, I ...” Tian Xiaojun quickly replied.

“I’ve made it very clear. I don’t want such a thing to happen again in the future!” Xia ruofei said sternly,”you don’t think I’m so bored that I’m going to slap you in the face, do you?”

“No, no... I didn’t mean it that way ...” Tian Xiaojun said in a panic.

“I’ll tell you this!” Xia ruofei said,”this matter definitely needs to be well publicized. However, one shouldn’t trouble two people for the same matter. Since you guys started this, you guys should handle it!”

At this point, Xia ruofei’s eyes turned cold. He glanced at Tian Xiaojun and continued,”If you really don’t want to, then let big brother Zhao and the others go back and spread the word. It’s not a big deal. However, today’s matter won’t be over so easily ...”

Tian Xiaojun’s heart trembled and he quickly said,”Young master Xia, there’s no need to trouble young master Zhao and the others with such a small matter! We’ll go back and inform our friends and brothers, and let them spread the news. I guarantee that such a thing won’t happen again in the future!”

He finally understood the situation.

This wasn’t something he could hide just because he wanted to. It was too easy for Zhao Yongjun and the others to spread word among the rich kids in the capital. It was a hundred times easier than Tian Xiaojun. If Zhao Yongjun wanted to, he could spread the news all over the capital overnight. There was no point in the three of them hiding it. They would offend Xia ruofei for no reason.

The matter had almost been settled. If Xia ruofei were to be disgusted by this, it would not be worth it.

As for face, that was of course very important.

However, if he still wanted to save his face when he knew that he couldn’t save it, he wasn’t just stupid. He was brainless.

Xia ruofei finally showed a satisfied smile. He nodded and said,””As long as you do these two things well, I’ll forget about today’s matter,”

Tian Xiaojun quickly said with tears of gratitude,”Thank you, master Xia. Thank you ... Thank you for your magnanimity ... Thank you ...”

Zhong Zixin and Xia Ling also repeatedly expressed their thanks. The two of them were also scared out of their wits.

Especially Xia Ling, who had been the loudest. He didn’t even dare to meet Xia ruofei’s eyes. As long as Xia ruofei looked over, he would immediately lower his head in guilt.

“Go!” Xia ruofei waved his hand as if he was shooing away a fly.

Tian Xiaojun and the other two bowed to Xia ruofei as if they had been granted Amnesty. Then, they bowed to Zhao Yongjun and the others, and ran away like stray dogs.

As he was leaving, Tian Xiaojun saw Liu Zhe standing in the crowd. He had mixed feelings.

He knew very well that after tonight, Liu Zhe would be considered to have climbed up the social ladder. He would not dare to order Liu Zhe around anymore.

Furthermore, no matter how angry he was at Liu Zhe for what had happened today, he did not dare to blame it on Liu Zhe. He had seen how Hou Liang had been so close to Liu Zhe. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

After Tian Xiaojun and the rest left, Xia ruofei and the rest were ready to return.

Everyone came to the door of Ling Ji’s private kitchen, and Liu Zhe was the first to say,””Brother Xia, Big Brothers, I’ll be going back first. Everyone should be at the three mountains these few days! I hope that everyone will give me a chance tomorrow to do my part as the host!”

Xia ruofei also smiled.”Liu Zhe is more familiar with the three mountains than I am. We can ask him to be our guide!”

Liu Zhe knew that Xia ruofei was helping him. He was extremely grateful and quickly said,””Yes, yes, yes. I’m very familiar with the places to eat, drink, and have fun in this area!”

Zhao Yongjun and the others were very respectful to Xia ruofei, so they all expressed their gratitude to Liu Zhe for his suggestion.

When Liu Zhe left, he felt as if he was stepping on cotton. It wasn’t because he had drunk too much that night, but because this experience was too dreamy.

When Xia ruofei and the others were dealing with Tian Xiaojun’s matter, Liu Zhe had already asked Song Wei about it. Zhao Yong Jun and the others ‘background was much more impressive than he had imagined.

Whether it was elder song, general Zhao Cheng, or the elders of the others, their names were like thunder to Liu Zhe’s ears. He would probably be shocked if he told his father about them.
