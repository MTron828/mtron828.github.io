Naturally, Xia ruofei would not explain too much to the spiritual turtle. He said lightly,Alright, then you can stay here and slowly recuperate! Theres no rush in your cultivation. After I take you back to the cave, youll have plenty of time to cultivate!

Yes! Master! The spiritual turtle said respectfully.

After Xia ruofei settled the spiritual turtle, he turned to look at Song Wei and Ling Qingxue, who were standing far away. He smiled and waved at them.

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue were watching from the side and had a stomach full of questions. However, Xia ruofei did not ask them to come out, so they did not dare to make any decisions on their own, for fear of becoming a burden to Xia ruofei.bender

So, when Xia ruofei indicated that they could come out, the two of them couldnt wait to leave their hiding place and quickly walked towards Xia ruofei.

Ling Qingxue couldnt keep her thoughts to herself. She couldnt help but ask before she reached Xia ruofeis side,RUO Fei, wheres that powerful turtle?

In Song Wei and Ling Qingxues eyes, the most dangerous scene was the moment when the turtle suddenly jumped out of the water. They were so scared that their faces turned pale, afraid that Xia ruofei would not be able to defeat the turtle.

Fortunately, Xia ruofei was much more powerful than they had imagined. He had an overwhelming advantage as he chased after the turtle and gave it a good beating.

However, Xia ruofei and the spiritual turtle communicated telepathically, so they did not know what had happened.

Xia ruofei chuckled.Tve completely subdued that spiritual turtle. In the future, it will not dare to go west when 1 point east!

Really? Ling Qingxue said in surprise,ruofei, dont joke with us! I feel that the black The spiritual turtle is very powerful!

Xia ruofei replied nonchalantly,yes! Although its only in the middle stage of the Golden core realm, these great demons are naturally strong, so its true strength should be comparable to a human in the late stage of the Golden core realm Its also because its strength is not bad that 1 spared its life and tried to subdue it. Otherwise, I would have killed it long ago.

So, youve really tamed that spiritual turtle? Ling Qingxue asked.

Of course! Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Then, he didnt care that the spiritual turtle was still healing and directly moved it out of the spirit map.

The turtles body was the size of a basin. The sudden change of environment, and in the cave where it lived all year round, made it dazed. Naturally, Xia ruofei would not explain too much to the spiritual turtle. He said lightly,Alright, then you can stay here and slowly recuperate! Theres no rush in your cultivation.
