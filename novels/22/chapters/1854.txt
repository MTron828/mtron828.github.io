The call went through very quickly. Song Wei’s voice was filled with joy, but at the same time, she seemed to be a little nervous. She asked softly,”I hope I’m not disturbing you?”

Xia ruofei said,”how can that be?” I muted my phone just now, so I didn’t hear your call ... Weiwei, how have you been these past few days?”

Song Wei was a little shy as she said, “I’m fine, but ... I miss you a little!”

Xia ruofei’s heart skipped a beat and he said,””I missed you too!”

“How’s sister Qingxue’s cultivation going?” Song Wei asked.

This was what she was most concerned about, and it was also the main reason why she couldn’t help but call him today.

Speaking of Ling Qingxue’s cultivation, Xia ruofei could not help but smile.””It’s very smooth! Qingxue’s talent is pretty good. We’ve already had a joint training session, and her cultivation level is probably in the middle of Qi disciple Level 1. If nothing goes wrong, she should be able to break through to Qi disciple Level 2 very soon. ”

“That’s great!” Song Wei said happily.

She was happy for Ling Qingxue from the bottom of her heart, but she couldn’t help but feel a little sour in her heart. Of course, she quickly adjusted her state of mind.

After all, she was a latecomer to this relationship. Moreover, Ling Qingxue was still kept in the dark about this matter. She was also filled with guilt towards Ling Qingxue, so she had adjusted her mentality quite well.

“Then, you should spend the time accompanying sister Qingxue in her cultivation!” Song Wei continued.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes!” You have to take care of yourself in Beijing. If you have any problems, you can go to song Rui or brother Zhao!”

In fact, Song Wei herself was quite famous in the circle of the second generation in Beijing. Basically, there was no problem that she couldn’t solve. However, Xia ruofei’s concern for her still made her happy.

“Okay, I know!” Song Wei said softly.

“That’s right!” Xia ruofei thought of the Gulfstream G650 that Li Yifu had given him. He smiled and said,”when do you have a holiday? I’ll go on a trip with you! Someone gave me a private jet today. ”

On the other end of the phone, Song Wei couldn’t help but burst out laughing. She pouted and said,”Even if you want to brag, you should at least make a draft! Could it be a toy plane?”

Xia ruofei said innocently,”I’m not bragging!” It’s really a private jet. You know the Gulfstream G650, right? Ali’s old Ma, jingbei’s old Liu, and the richest man, old Wang, all use Gulfstream series buggers!”

Of course, Song Wei did not believe him. She smiled and asked,””Are you trying to say that someone gave you a Gulfstream G650 today?”

“Yeah! You believe me now?” Xia ruofei said.

“Believe my a * s!” “He just gave someone a private jet worth hundreds of millions. Even the richest man in the world wouldn’t be so generous!” Song Wei said.

“Weiwei, I’m telling the truth!” Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.”It’s fine if you don’t believe me. I’ll definitely go to the clubhouse after the proposal is confirmed. You’ll see it with your own eyes and believe me, right?”

Seeing that Xia ruofei was speaking as if he was telling the truth, Song Wei could not help but mumble, “You’re really not joking?”

“I’ve always been serious, okay?” Xia ruofei said,”you’re the one who keeps interrupting ...”

“Okay, okay, okay, it’s my fault!” Song Wei laughed. Then tell me in detail, which rich man was brainwashed by you?”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but roll his eyes. In the morning, Ling Qingxue had also said that Li Yifu had been brainwashed by him. Now, Song Wei actually said the same thing. These two people really had some tacit understanding! It seemed that they could become good sisters in the future ...

Xia ruofei’s thoughts wandered, and as a result, he didn’t speak for a long time.

“Hey!” Song Wei could not help but ask. Why aren’t you saying anything? Don’t tell me you made it up on the spot?”

Xia ruofei quickly said,”I’ve told you that I’m serious. Actually ... The person who gave me the plane is really rich. However, this has nothing to do with how rich he is. The main reason is that he is also a cultivator.”

Song Wei’s interest was piqued and she quickly asked.

Xia ruofei explained his relationship with Li Yifu, including the fact that he gave Li Yifu guidance and gave him a spiritual crystal.

In the end, Xia ruofei said,”it’s just this. He insisted on giving it to me. I had no choice but to accept it.” But to be honest, money isn’t really that important to cultivators, especially when wealth reaches a certain level. It’s just a number, and many precious cultivation resources can’t be bought with money. ”

“If you put it that way, I can understand ...” Song Wei said, feeling the same.

Then, she said with interest,””I didn’t expect you to be so senior!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”of course!” You didn’t see the expression on Qingxue’s face when my adopted husband called her martial grandmother today ...”

At this point, Xia ruofei suddenly stopped. He realized that it was not appropriate to say these things in front of Song Wei. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

However, Song Wei didn’t seem to be unhappy at all. Instead, she smiled and said,”Sister Qingxue must be very embarrassed ...”

Xia ruofei rolled his eyes and said with a smile,””Don’t be too smug! The next time I see you, I’ll definitely call you that!”

On the other end of the phone, Song Wei shrieked and said,”I don’t want to be called that old!”
