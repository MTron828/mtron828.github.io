Xia ruofei saw that Ling Qingxue was about to answer the phone and immediately reached out to stop the music. “Dad,” he said. “Qingxue, have you finished your meal?” Ling Xiaotian’s voice was a little low. “I’m done. What’s the matter, dad?”Ling Qingxue asked. “Where are you now?” Ling Qingxue looked at Xia ruofei, who was driving, and blushed.””I’m with ruofei! On the way to Taoyuan farm. Dad ... I just happened to meet RUO Fei after dinner. ” “Oh ... I see!” Ling Xiaotian pondered for a moment before saying,”have fun then. You don’t have to go back to the company in the afternoon.” “I know.” Ling Qingxue said obediently. “Dad, is there something you need from me?” she asked. Ling Qingxue felt that her father seemed to be in a bad mood on the other end of the phone, so she couldn’t help but ask. “It’s nothing, I’m just asking. ” Ling Xiaotian smiled and said,”I have a meeting soon. I’ll hang up first!” “Oh ... Then I’ll see you again, daddy ...” Ling Qingxue said. Xia ruofei saw Ling Qingxue put away her phone and asked with a smile,””My father – in – Law is calling?” Ling Qingxue rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei and said,””You’re so glib again ...” “I haven’t had lunch yet!” Xia ruofei immediately replied. It’s not oily ... Do you want to check it yourself?” As he spoke, he held the steering wheel with one hand, then leaned over and tried to put his mouth close to the steering wheel. Ling Qingxue quickly dodged and smiled.””Don’t mess around! And you’re driving ...” “Hmm ...” Xia ruofei said seriously,”then we’ll make a scene when we’re not driving!” Ling Qingxue was so angry that she clenched her fists and hit Xia ruofei. The two laughed for a while before Xia ruofei asked,””Right, Qingxue, your dad called you for something?” “I don’t know what it is. He won’t tell me even if I ask him.” Ling Qingxue furrowed her brows and said,”but I feel like there’s something.” “Then you can call back and ask ...” Xia ruofei said as he drove. “Forget it. I know my dad.” Ling Qingxue said,”if he wants to tell me, he will tell me himself. If he doesn’t want to tell me, there’s no point in asking.” “Alright then!” Xia ruofei shrugged. Naturally, Xia ruofei would not meddle in Ling Qingxue’s family affairs. It was almost one in the afternoon when the two returned to the farm. Ye Lingyun had already made his own lunch and finished it. Seeing that Xia ruofei had brought Ling Qingxue back, ye Lingyun immediately took the initiative to drive Xia ruofei’s Knight XV to the farm for a car wash, obviously to make room for the two. Xia ruofei’s stomach was rumbling with hunger. He went straight to the kitchen to prepare food the moment he got home. Meanwhile, Ling Qingxue was sitting on the sofa in the living room, watching TV. It wasn’t that she didn’t want to cook. She had never been in the kitchen since she was young, so she didn’t know how to cook at all. Besides, she quite enjoyed the feeling of being taken care of by Xia ruofei. Hearing the sizzling sounds of cooking coming from the kitchen, Ling Qingxue’s heart was filled with happiness. She sat and watched TV for a while. The more she thought about it, the more she felt that Ling Xiaotian was hiding something from her. In the end, Ling Qingxue stood up and took out her phone from her bag. She found a number and dialed it. She did not call Ling Xiaotian directly because she knew that she would not be able to get anything out of him. Ling Qingxue was calling manager Xu of the Ling Ji’s food and beverage procurement department. She was the young woman who was in charge of arranging the vegetable supply for Xia ruofei. “Qingxue,” “Big sister Xu, are you busy?” Ling Qingxue asked with a smile. “It’s alright, I just finished a regular meeting. ” Manager Xu smiled and asked,”Qingxue, what’s the matter?” “Big sister Xu, I just wanted to ask you, is there anything going on at the company today?” Ling Qingxue asked. “What is it?” Manager Xu subconsciously repeated and then asked,”which aspect are you referring to?” “I’m not sure ...” Ling Qingxue frowned and asked,”is everything normal at the company today?” Manager Xu thought for a moment and said,”there’s one thing. Just now, Chairman Ling called for a meeting. He said that the municipal Party Committee suddenly informed us that Lingyun hotel was not shortlisted for the final bidding list because its hardware was not up to standard.” “What?” Ling Qingxue cried out involuntarily,”they didn’t even get into the shortlist? That means we don’t even have the right to participate in the bidding?” “That’s right,”said manager Xu with a wry smile. The purpose of Chairman Ling’s meeting today was to discuss this matter and let everyone brainstorm on how to deal with it, as well as to see if there was any way to remedy it. Of course, this is mainly a matter of public relations, so I don’t know much ...” “Okay, thank you, big sister Xu.” Ling Qingxue put her phone away in a daze. It must be that Lin Feng pulling some cheap tricks! Ling Qingxue said in her heart. She didn’t expect that Lin Feng would really bear a grudge for what happened today and that his revenge would come so quickly. Hmph ... Pretending to be a gentleman, isn’t he just like those second generation of officials! Ling Qingxue thought angrily. At this moment, Xia ruofei came out of the kitchen with a plate of scrambled eggs with tomatoes. Seeing Ling Qingxue in this state, he could not help but ask,””What’s wrong, Qingxue? What happened?” Only then did Ling Qingxue come back to her senses. She gathered her emotions and forced a smile. She said to Xia ruofei,””Oh ... I’m fine!” Xia ruofei placed the scrambled eggs with tomatoes on the table and walked to Ling Qingxue. He looked into her eyes and said,””Qingxue, you don’t look so good ... What’s wrong?” Ling Qingxue sighed and told Xia ruofei the whole story. Xia ruofei listened quietly and did not interrupt. In the end, Ling Qingxue said,”that’s what happened ... Ruofei, I didn’t want to go this afternoon, but my father had already agreed to that Deputy Secretary Lin’s request. Moreover, our competition for the City Council’s designated reception unit is also up to him. So, I wanted to go over and deal with it. I didn’t expect ...” Xia ruofei smiled.”I didn’t expect that my sudden appearance would cause you to leave without saying goodbye. So, the second generation of that small official used his resources to take revenge on you?” “Ruofei, this has nothing to do with you.” Ling Qingxue quickly said,”that kind of petty person, even if this didn’t happen today, he would still hold a grudge against us if my dad called him and rejected him.” “Will this have a big impact on your company?” Xia ruofei asked calmly. “How should I put it ... We’ve just entered the hotel industry and haven’t stabilized our footing yet. If we can get a spot in the municipal Party Committee reception unit, the benefits for our long – term development are obvious.” Ling Qingxue said,”but even if we can’t get it, it won’t be a big deal. At most, we’ll just slow down the hotel’s development ...” Ling Qingxue was pretending to be relaxed, but in reality, she knew how much importance Ling Xiaotian placed on this bid. Xia ruofei nodded and said,”I know.” No matter what, this matter started because of me, so let me help you guys coordinate!” “You?” Ling Qingxue asked in surprise,”how are you going to coordinate?” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”what’s wrong?” You dare to look down on your husband? I’m telling you, I have people up there too ...” Ling Qingxue’s face turned red as she burst out laughing.”Look at you ... There’s someone above you! Also, whose husband are you? I didn’t say I was going to marry you!” Xia ruofei hugged Ling Qingxue’s delicate body and chuckled.”Wife, don’t forget that you’re in my house right now! A man and a woman alone in the same room, you know ...” “Let me go, you lecher!” Ling Qingxue called out with a smile. Xia ruofei’s demonic claws scratched the soft flesh on Ling Qingxue’s waist. Ling Qingxue was so tickled that she kept laughing. Xia ruofei only let her go when she kept begging for mercy. “Qingxue, there are still a few dishes in the kitchen. Please go and bring them out.” Xia ruofei said,”I’ll go make a call.” “Oh, sure!” Ling Qingxue asked,”why are you suddenly calling?” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’m coordinating with your family’s hotel!” Didn’t I just promise you?” Ling Qingxue stopped and asked,””Ruofei, do you really know the higher – ups?” “Yes, yes, and there’s more than one of them!” Xia ruofei said seriously,”I have to think about who I should find. It wouldn’t do if the leaders were too high in rank. Once the National or Ministry – Level leaders came out, wouldn’t they be scared to death? That’s not good!” “You’re getting more and more ridiculous ...” Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but chuckle again. She rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei flirtatiously and went into the kitchen to serve the dishes. Ling Qingxue naturally thought that Xia ruofei was joking. She did not know that everything Xia ruofei said was true. Now, Xia ruofei was looking for someone to coordinate this matter. Whether it was elder song or Tian Huilan, their ranks were shocking. That Deputy Secretary Lin was only a division – Level cadre. Asking them to come out was like using a cannon to kill a mosquito! After much thought, Xia ruofei finally found a suitable person. He immediately found a number in his phone’s contact list and dialed it ... ~
