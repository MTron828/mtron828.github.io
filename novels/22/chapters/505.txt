Chapter 506: The interest_2

Xia ruofei went to the staff canteen for dinner and then went back to the villa to rest.

He was also exhausted from the past few days. First, he stayed up all night to practice making runes. Then, he ran through the night and killed five enemies in a row. In the second half of the night, he even had sex with Ling Qingxue. He also didn’t sleep at all.

The next day, Feng Jing started to interview new employees at Tao Yuan farm. Xia ruofei was just as he said, letting Feng Jing do whatever she wanted.

In fact, he didn’t even go to the office building. He slept until he woke up naturally and made some breakfast in the villa’s kitchen.

At around 10 am, Feng Jing called Xia ruofei and told him that ruan Fugui had arrived at the farm with the village Accountant.

Hence, Xia ruofei changed out of his home clothes and walked to the mixed – use complex.

In Xia ruofei’s office, both parties signed the official contract. Then, Xia ruofei called pang Hao to his office and asked him to save the contract. He also instructed him not to forget to transfer the rent to the village’s account on time according to the contract.

Ruan Fugui also took the initiative to say that he would organize the villagers to draw out the boundary of the newly rented land of Taoyuan farm in the next two days and make some simple signs and fences.

Originally, Xia ruofei had wanted to ask ruan Fugui and the village Accountant to stay for dinner at the farm. After all, they had treated him very well yesterday, and he had to return the favor.

However, ruan Fugui said that he had something to do at home and declined Xia ruofei’s invitation.

Xia ruofei saw that ruan Fugui didn’t seem to be polite and guessed that he really had something urgent to do at home. After all, village cadres were not official civil servants. They had to farm and fish like the villagers. At this time of the year, every family was very busy. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Hence, Xia ruofei politely sent ruan Fugui downstairs.

After the land lease contract was signed, the scope of Peach Blossom Farm directly expanded to more than three times its original size. Now, there were dozens of acres of land in the South and North, and the production problem would soon be solved.

Xia ruofei took the latest financial statement that pang Hao had sent over two days ago and silently calculated the capital in the books. He felt that it was better not to delay any further. The newly allocated land had to be used as soon as possible. The construction of infrastructure was already imminent.

He brought the new plot of land to Feng Jing’s office to discuss how to plan the newly rented land. He still wanted to hear Feng Jing’s opinion.

However, Feng Jing wasn’t in the office.

Xia ruofei then realized that today was the day of the company’s interview for new employees. He guessed that the interview might not be over yet.

With a hint of curiosity, he went straight to the company meeting room on the second floor.

There were a few young people waiting outside the meeting room. There were three men and one woman, all dressed fashionably. The only girl among them even had a rose – Red suitcase.

Xia ruofei glanced at her and found that this girl looked quite scholarly. She was wearing a pair of rimless glasses on her delicate face and looked gentle and weak.

The other three young men naturally surrounded the girl.

Seeing Xia ruofei walk over, one of the young men in a gray down jacket took the initiative to greet him.””Brother, are you also here for the interview? Why are you so late! The interviews here have already ended!”

Another young man with a middle – parted hair said with a gloating smile,””Brother, you’re too late! The interview started more than an hour ago. It’s already too late for you to come now! Don’t be late for the next interview ...”

“Since the interview is over, why are you still here?” Xia ruofei asked with interest. Are you also late?”

“We’re not late!” The young man in the gray down jacket said.

At this time, the weak – looking girl with rimless glasses also took the initiative to say,””I’m from another city. I heard that if I’m accepted, I’ll be provided with accommodation, so I stayed and waited for the results. If I’m accepted, I can save a day’s room fee, right?”

Xia ruofei looked at the girl’s luggage and smiled.””I can tell.”

Then, he turned to the young men and asked with a smile,””So you’re also from another place?”

“We’re from the three mountains,”said the young man in the gray down jacket,” but we’re done with the interview, aren’t we? I’ll just wait with Liu Qian! We also want to know the results of the interview as soon as possible!”

Xia ruofei knew that Feng Jing was in the meeting room, so he was not in a hurry to enter. Instead, he sat down on the chair provided for the interviewees by the corridor with interest.

He asked,”why did you come to the farm to apply?” This place is far away from the city, so life should be very boring!”

The bespectacled girl said with a smile,””It’s not easy to find a job these days, and the benefits here are good! There’s five insurances and one housing Fund, and free accommodation. I don’t have to squeeze in the bus or subway to work. The key is that the requirements for education are not that high. I think it’s quite good!”

“And the environment here is so good!” The middle – parted young man also said. The mountains and rivers are beautiful, and we’re both white – collar workers. Why do we have to go to the city to breathe in the exhaust?”

The young man in the gray down jacket said with a hint of excitement,””This place is so close to the beach, we can go to the beach for a barbecue in the future! What’s there to be picky about in this kind of working environment!”

The young man in the gray down jacket was beaming with joy. Obviously, he had already begun to look forward to the scene of taking a stroll with Liu Qian on the beach in the future.

Xia ruofei was speechless, thinking,”brother, are you here to work or to pick up girls?”

He could tell that these three young men, including the young man who had not spoken much, should be interested in Liu Qian, so they were so eager to stay and accompany her.

At this moment, the young man in the gray down jacket saw Xia ruofei’s strange smile and couldn’t help but say,””Brother, since you’re here, you don’t have to chat with us. CEO Feng of paradise company is still in the conference room! Why don’t you go in and try?”

“He’s already an hour late,” said the middle – parted young man.”Do you think President Feng will give him a chance?”

“How would you know if you don’t try?” Liu Qian also said enthusiastically,”go in and have a good talk with President Feng! Just say that you’re lost or stuck in a traffic jam. In any case, find a suitable reason ...”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.”This farm is so remote. It’s not easy to find.”

At this moment, the meeting room door opened and Feng Jing walked out.

When she saw Liu Qian and the others, she couldn’t help but ask,””Why haven’t you left? Didn’t I tell you to go back and wait for the news?”

Xia ruofei stood up from his chair when he saw Feng Jing.

At this moment, Feng Rao saw Xia ruofei, who was blocked by Liu Qian and the rest. She exclaimed in surprise,””Chairman, why are you here ...”

The chairman!

Liu Qian and the others were stunned and looked at Xia ruofei without blinking.

They could never imagine that this young man, who was about the same age as them and was very approachable, was actually the chairman of this company.

So they were just chatting with the company’s Big Boss!

The two men in the grey down jacket and the man with the middle – parted hair wanted to find a hole to hide in. They couldn’t help but blush when they thought of how they had “guided” Xia ruofei in an old – fashioned manner.

Liu Qian wasn’t any better. Her pretty face was suddenly covered with a blush.

“Chairman ...” Liu Qian said, embarrassed.”We didn’t know ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand.””I’m fine ...”

Then, he turned to Feng Rao and said,””CEO Feng, I was looking for you for something. I saw that you weren’t in the office, so I came over to take a look. By the way, are the interview results out yet?”
