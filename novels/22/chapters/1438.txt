Chapter 1439: Dong Yun_2

Translator: 549690339

Since Dong Yun had already put it that way, Feng Jing didn’t try to persuade her any further. She was very gentlemanly as she smiled and said,””Alright then! No matter what, I would like to thank miss Dong for taking the time to meet me today. I wish you a bright future!”

“Thank you for the coffee!” Dong Yun said with a smile, then stood up.

After taking two steps, Dong Yun turned around and said,”CEO Feng, there’s something that I might have said to you, but I still want to say it ... No matter what your reason for staying at paradise Corporation is, I think you should also think about your career plan and review your current choice.”

With that, Dong Yun left the café, leaving Feng Jing sitting in the café, deep in thought.

......

Dong Yun walked out of the café and got into her rented Beetle car. She turned around and looked at the motionless Feng Jing through the window. Sighing, she shook her head, started the car, and drove away from the café.

In fact, when she was invited by paradise Corporation, she wasn’t as determined as she appeared to be in front of Feng Jing.

She had to admit that this position was very attractive to her.

This attraction didn’t come from the profession itself, but because the Paradise Corporation was located in the three mountains.

In a second – tier city like San Shan, there were only a handful of companies that could barely meet her career plan like paradise Corporation.

BAT – Level big companies were basically concentrated in the first – tier big cities in Beijing, Qiantang, shencheng, or Guangdong.

Accepting the offers from these companies meant leaving Sanshan.

This was also what Dong Yun was conflicted about.

The reason why she chose to return to China to develop her career was that she wanted to be closer to home so that she could take care of her mother, who was getting older.

Dong Yun’s father had died of illness when she was very young, and it was her mother who had raised her.

After graduating from high school, Dong Yun didn’t need her mother to send her money at all. She could support her life and studies with scholarships and work – Study programs. Sometimes, she could even send some money to her mother to help with the family.

After she started working, Dong Yun bought a big house in the United States. She didn’t have to worry about food and clothing.

However, it was difficult to leave her homeland. Her mother was unwilling to go to the United States with her to enjoy life. Even though she was close to retirement age, she still worked outside, even though her monthly salary was not even a fraction of Dong Yun’s daily salary.

In Dong Yun’s mother’s words, she just couldn’t stay idle. She couldn’t stand the fact that she had to retire at the age of fifty.

Dong Yun couldn’t change her mother’s mind, so she could only let it be.

After staying in the United States for a few years, she was really worried about her mother and finally decided to return to China to develop her career. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

However, there was no company suitable for her in San Shan. Even if she returned to China, she might be working in another city.

But even if it was outside, it was better than being far away.

By then, it would be easier to persuade her mother to live with her than to persuade her mother to go to the United States

Therefore, when she received the invitation from the Paradise company, she was only tempted for a short while, but she quickly rejected this idea.

Returning to China to develop her career was already a huge sacrifice for her career. Dong Yun didn’t want to compromise with her career plans.

With these complicated thoughts in her mind, Dong Yun drove home.

This was a very old tube – shaped building. The architectural style was full of the atmosphere of the last century, and the mottled outer wall was even engraved with the traces of time.

This house was left behind by Dong Yun’s father. It was a welfare house owned by a state – owned enterprise at that time. After the property reform, they bought it and lost the property rights.

Although Dong Yun could afford to buy a big house for her mother in San Shan, her mother could not bear to leave her old neighbors here. She was determined not to move, so Dong Yun had no choice but to give in.

After a long time, she finally found an empty parking space among the countless parking lots downstairs. Dong Yun parked her car and quickly walked into the corridor with her car keys in one hand and her phone in the other.

Just as she was going upstairs, her phone vibrated.

She had been in contact with some companies recently, and she often had some work – related WeChat messages, so she lit up her phone screen at once.

In the end, what he saw was not a WeChat message, but a news notification: “Sudden accident at the grilled fish restaurant: a mysterious young man caught a boiling stone pot with his bare hands to save a life.”

Dong Yun wanted to close it, but after seeing the title, she couldn’t help but frown. She clicked on the news and quickly read the text. Then, she immediately clicked on the video. She stopped walking upstairs ...

After a long time, Dong Yun finally arrived at her house on the fourth floor. Her expression didn’t look too good.

Dong Yun took out her key and opened the door. She placed the key on the tray above the shoe cabinet and bent down to take the slippers.

At this moment, footsteps came from inside the house. Dong Yun raised her head and saw her mother, Zheng Shuying.

Dong Yun’s eyes slightly narrowed and she asked calmly,”Mom, what are you doing at home? Don’t you have to work today?”

Zheng Shuying smiled unnaturally and said,””It’s almost the new year, and there’s not much business in the store, so I got off work early ...”

Dong Yun looked at her mother and said,”Did the sun rise from the West today? You actually got off work early?”

Zheng Shuying reproached,”how can you say that, child?” Isn’t it better for mom to go home earlier? It would save you the trouble of ordering take – out all the time, which was unhygienic and unhealthy! I’m at home today, so I’ll make you a good meal tonight!”

As Dong Yun listened to her mother’s nagging, her eyes could not help but turn red.

“Mom, don’t hide it anymore!” Dong Yun said with a sobbing tone. I already know!”

Zheng Shuying was stunned. She turned to her daughter and asked,””What do you know? Why are you speaking so strangely today? Are you feeling uncomfortable?”

Dong Yun gently pushed away her mother’s hand, which was reaching out to feel her forehead, and said,”Mom! You had an accident in the shop today and almost got into a big trouble, right? The news is already out, why are you still hiding it from me?”

After saying that, Dong Yun took out her phone and searched for the news article that she had read in the corridor. She stared into Zheng Shuying’s eyes and said,”Take a look for yourself! Don’t tell me that the person in the video isn’t you!”

Zheng Shuying took the phone doubtfully. When she saw the title, she realized that the matter had really been exposed.

Zheng Shuying was the cleaning lady who had been at the grilled fish shop this afternoon.

If word of this got out, Xia ruofei probably wouldn’t believe it.

The mother of a Harvard MBA student, a senior elite white – collar worker in a big United States company, was actually working as a cleaner in a restaurant.

However, this was the truth. This had nothing to do with Dong Yun’s filial piety. It was the old man himself who couldn’t sit still.

If it was up to Dong Yun, she would naturally wish to move her mother to the United States as soon as possible. That way, she would not have to change jobs.

However, Zheng Shuying was not willing to go to a place where she was unfamiliar with the people and the place, and even the language was not understood.

No matter how good the United States, it was not as good as his own home.

As for work, it had already become a habit of Zheng Shuying. Even though the money that Dong Yun sent home every month was enough for her to eat, drink, and have fun, she just couldn’t take a break.

In the past, she had even been a nanny. After Dong Yun’s strong opposition, she found this job.

Zheng Shuying clicked on the video and saw the shocking scene from that afternoon again. Her hands were still trembling slightly, and she felt a lingering fear in her heart.

At the same time, she was filled with gratitude for the brave young man.

Seeing her strong – minded daughter’s teary eyes, Zheng Shuying forced a smile and comforted her,””Xiao Yun, this was just an accident. You don’t have to worry so much ... Besides, I’m fine, aren’t I?”
