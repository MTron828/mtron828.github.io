Translator: 549690339

Ling Qingxue finally believed Xia ruofei’s words. She pouted and said,””How boring! I wanted to give you a surprise! I didn’t expect you to guess it yourself!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”why do you still look so unwilling?” You’ve directly broken through two realms this time! Go out and ask around, which of those Qi layer cultivators can have your speed? Not to mention breaking through to refined Qi Level 6, even if they broke through from refined Qi Level 1 to refined Qi Level 3, they would wake up laughing in their drcams!”

Ling Qingxue laughed in embarrassment and said,””I’m very happy! It’s just that… This Vermillion Jade Fruit is so precious, but I can’t take it out of the trial Pagoda. Otherwise, I could have given half of it to Wei Wei!”

Ling Qingxue was still thinking about Song Wei. Both of their cultivation levels were supposed to be at the same level, but Song Wei did not pass the selection of the rising Dragon Order this time. Only Ling Qingxue and Xia ruofei came to this Mystic realm on the moon. After she met up with Xia ruofei in the Tower of Trials, she continued to have opportunities and absorbed a large amount of Topaz essence, allowing her spiritual power to break through to the intermediate stage of the spirit gathering realm. It was equivalent to the spiritual power cultivation of an intermediate stage golden core cultivator. Now that he had consumed half a Vermillion Jade Fruit, his true Qi cultivation had broken through two realms, reaching refined Qi Level 6. The gap between him and Song Wei had widened.

Ling Qingxue was also a little worried that Song Wei would feel uncomfortable when the time came. Therefore, she would always think of Song Wei whenever there was a good thing. However, the things in the trial Pagoda, including the yellow jade essence and the Vermillion Jade Fruit, could not be taken out. They could only be used on the spot. Even if he wanted to leave some for Song Wei, he could not.

Therefore, the more benefits she received, the more worried Ling Qingxue became.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”Weiwei is a reasonable person. She won’t be suspicious because of this!” When we go back, we’ll give her more cultivation resources and help her improve her cultivation as soon as possible!” “Mm! Let’s help her together!” Ling Qingxue said.

Since there was no way to bring these precious cultivation resources out, it could only be this way.

Then, Ling Qingxue asked,”so, we’ve already completed the sixth level of the trial Pagoda, right?” Has the passageway to the seventh floor been opened? Also, there should be a reward for completing the mission! The reward for this level’s mission, could it be those two Vermillion Jade fruits?”

Xia ruofei laughed,”who knows!” He had yet to see any notifications! The powerful person who designed the Tower of Trials never played by the rules, how could we have guessed it! In any case, we’ll follow the instructions of the mission. As long as senior is happy, it’s fine!”

In the hidden space enshrouded in purple mist, the green – robed elder could not help but stroke his beard and laugh when he heard Xia ruofei’s words.

At this moment, Xia ruofei saw a new message on the mission bar in his perceptual mirror.

The content was very simple. The sixth level of the Tower of Trials was completed and the passageway to the seventh level of the Tower of Trials was opened. Xia ruofei was prompted to follow the map to the passageway. In addition, the mission reward for this level would also be issued at the passageway.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but Mutter to himself,””That senior can’t possibly hear me, right?”

The green – robed elder was drinking water in the hidden space that was enshrouded in purple clouds. He was watching Xia ruofei’s every move. When he heard Xia ruofei’s words, he almost spat out the water in his mouth.

Xia ruofei would never have thought that his joke was actually completely right.

“What’s the mattcr?”Ling Qingxue asked curiously.

“As soon as I said that, the mission prompt bar updated its information.” Xia ruofei said,”this is too timely!”

Ling Qingxue pursed her lips and laughed.”Don’t think too much. You’re just a little golden core cultivator. In the eyes of the true seniors, you’re insignificant, okay?” How could they eavesdrop on you?”

In the hidden space enshrouded in purple mist, the green – robed elder laughed,””This girl is right! How could I possibly eavesdrop? This old man is openly monitoring the operation of the trial Pagoda and the completion of the trial cultivator’s mission! Hmm…This little girl is not bad, very good!”

Xia ruofei said,”I won’t undervalue myself!” Although my cultivation is low, I’m very talented! For a genius like me, of course the senior Almighty will value me very much. I’m a potential stock!”

Ling Qingxue made a vomiting gesture and said with a smile,””This is the first time I’ve seen someone who can boast to such a disgusting extent…”

“You stinky girl, you’ve grown up!” Xia ruofei said,”it’s indeed different when your spiritual power has broken through to the intermediate stage of the spirit gathering realm. You even dare to cancel your own husband without any restraint!”

Ling Qingxue blushed and said,'”‘Glib tongue again!”

Then, she quickly changed the topic.””Oh right, I’ll stop joking. What exactly is the mission hint?”

Xia ruofei pouted and said,”it’s still the same. The entrance to the seventh floor has been opened. We can follow the map to find the entrance to the seventh floor.” In addition, the reward for this level’s mission could also be received at the entrance of the passage leading to the seventh level. This time, there’s nothing new at all!” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Ling Qingxue chuckled and said,”what new ideas do you want?” Could it be like last time, that you’ll only be happy after you’ve broken through all the obstacles to get the reward?”
