2671 Finding the mole (1)

There were about a dozen middle management personnel left on Peach Blossom Island. At this time, everyone was whispering to each other, not knowing why Liu Qingfeng had gathered everyone in the middle of the night.

Recently, the Peach Blossom Island had changed a lot, and the hearts of the people below were also wavering. Everyone didn’t have a sense of security, so when Liu Qingfeng suddenly called everyone over for a meeting, their hearts were all in a state of turmoil.

After Liu Qingfeng walked into the meeting room, he faced everyone’s inquiring eyes and calmly said,”Benilatti, come out for a moment. The rest of you, stay where you are.”

Benilatti was the only local in the middle management. Strictly speaking, the others were employees of the Liu family, but benilatti was not, so he was a little out of place with everyone. Even his seat was a few seats away from the others.

Benilatti was slightly taken aback, and a hint of hesitation flashed in his eyes. However, he still stood up and walked towards the door.

The other middle management from the Liu family began to whisper. Liu Qingfeng stood at the door and said in a deep voice,””Don’t talk nonsense. Everyone, stay here and wait for orders!”

After that, he left the meeting room with benilatti.

At the same time, four burly guards walked into the meeting room and guarded the front and back doors respectively. They stood at the door with cold expressions.

The management members in the meeting room were all shocked by the scene. They exchanged glances with each other, showing a hint of uneasiness. However, they didn’t dare to talk about anything else. They all sat in their seats in silence, and the atmosphere was quiet and heavy.

Liu Qingfeng walked to the door of the office with benilatti and said,””Go in! Someone is waiting for you inside!”

Benilatti hesitated for a moment, but when he saw the two fierce – looking guards at the door of the office, he finally walked in with a hint of trepidation.

Liu Qingfeng also stood at the door and waited. After benilatti went in, it was quiet inside, not even a sound could be heard.

Liu Qingfeng was a little uneasy in his heart. Of course, he didn’t want there to be a mole among these people; If there was really a mole, he also secretly hoped that it was bainilatti, because the others were all employees of the Liu family. If something went wrong, he would not be able to explain it to the family.

After benilatti went in, the office door opened about five or six minutes later.

Liu Qingfeng was pacing back and forth in the corridor, and when he heard the voice, he quickly turned around.

The person who appeared at the door was Xia ruofei and not bainilatti.

“Call the next one,” Xia ruofei said indifferently.

Liu Qingfeng hesitated for a moment and asked,”Mr. Xia, bainilatti ...”

“There’s something wrong with this person. I’ve already got him under control. ” Xia ruofei said indifferently,”don’t make a big deal out of this. Continue to call in more people.”

After bainilatti entered the office, Xia ruofei effortlessly put him into a Deep State of hypnosis. This mental hypnosis was used against ordinary people and was successful in interrogating them.

The first problem was already exposed by bainilatti.

Xia ruofei’s question was exactly the same as the one he had asked Liu Qingfeng in the car. In the end, the answer that benilatti gave was,”He secretly sold the news to Wang Boshan.

Xia ruofei continued to ask for more details, hoping to find some useful clues.

The story was actually very simple. Because benilatti was a local, he often returned to evates Island, the capital of the ponautu, on his rest days by boat or helicopter.

About ten months ago, Wang Boshan found him, and with the help of money, he quickly bought benilatti.

At that time, Wang Boshan had already set his eyes on the Peach Blossom Island. Of course, it was still called the green cloud Island.

Bainilatti continuously provided Wang Boshan with information about the inner workings of green cloud Island, and Wang Boshan was not stingy with his money. He was very generous every time.

This was especially so after bainilatti first spread the news that green cloud Island might change hands. Wang Boshan even gave him 100000 US dollars and asked him to further inquire about the news. Wang Boshan also promised a reward of 300000 US dollars.

It was also because of this that when benilatti received the latest news, he immediately told Wang Boshan. This included the news that Xia ruofei had officially taken over green cloud Island and changed its name to Paradise Island.

It was because of this accurate information that Wang Boshan could have a target in mind. Through some connections in China, he quickly inquired about Xia ruofei’s situation and then went to find him with Zheng Yongshou.

After Xia ruofei asked about the situation, he knocked benilatti out with one palm and gagged his mouth. Then, he tied him up like a rice dumpling and threw him into the lounge in the office.

After hearing Xia ruofei’s words, Liu Qingfeng’s heart trembled slightly. At the same time, he secretly heaved a sigh of relief. If there was a problem with bainilatti, it meant that the possibility of other people having problems was relatively low.

“Okay, Mr. Xia, please wait a moment!” He quickly said.

Next, Xia ruofei went through all the middle – Level managers who were still on Peach Blossom Island.

To his relief, there was nothing wrong with these people. Most of them were loyal to the Liu family and responsible for the work on the Peach Blossom Island. Although two or three of them had mentioned Paradise Island to their families, the details didn’t match. They weren’t like benilatti, who had direct and irrefutable evidence.

After a round of screening, Xia ruofei could confirm that the mole was bainilatti. The others were not too much of a problem.

After the last middle management of the project left, Xia ruofei called Liu Qingfeng into the office.

“Mr. Xia ...” Liu Qingfeng called out with a trace of uneasiness.

Xia ruofei casually threw the name list to Liu Qingfeng and said indifferently,””The people who have been marked, arrange for them to leave Peach Blossom Island tomorrow!”

Liu Qingfeng’s body trembled slightly, and he quickly glanced at the list, and then carefully asked,”Mr. Xia, is there a problem with these people?” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“It’s not a big problem, but he doesn’t keep his mouth shut and tells others everything. ” Xia ruofei said,”Peach Blossom Island doesn’t welcome people like him!”

“Alright, I’ll arrange it tonight!” Liu Qingfeng said.

The few people that Xia ruofei had selected were the ones who had admitted to telling their families the news during the screening process.

The next step was to set up a big array on the Peach Blossom Island. If those people with loose mouths stayed here, they would make trouble sooner or later. Hence, Xia ruofei did not show them any mercy and directly asked Liu Qingfeng to get them away as soon as possible.

Xia ruofei continued.”Also, for the projects that are currently in progress, finish them as soon as possible within three days. If you can’t finish them, stop for the time being. When the time comes, try to evacuate as many people as possible!”
