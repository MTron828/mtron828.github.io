Fernández’s race against time also seized the first opportunity. Marca was the first media to publish the news. Their Facebook and Twitter had a large number of football fans following them, and football reporters from all over the world also followed their accounts so that they could get the information at the first moment.

Therefore, when the views of their news on their official website and APP were still relatively average, it caused a wave of excitement on social media platforms.

Spain’s big and small media reposted it one after another. In contrast, as and world Sports, which released the news about half an hour later than marca, received relatively less attention with articles with similar content.

This incident was very newsworthy, and it was also related to Barcelona, so once it was released, it immediately received widespread attention and discussion.

Soon, the scope of the news was not limited to Spain.

Europe’s large and small sports media also reprinted the news.”Team news,””the footballer,””La Gazzetta Milan sport,””Daily Telegraph,””Sky Sports,””Photo News ...” These well – known sports media all reprinted the news in more prominent positions.

Xia ruofei had underestimated the sensitivity of the media and the speed of news spreading in the mobile internet era. When the video spread throughout the European continent, he was still sitting on his bed and practicing the “great way of Dao”. After he finished practicing, he did not even take a look at it and went to sleep.

At around midnight, Xia ruofei was woken up by the ringing of his phone.

He rubbed his eyes and picked up his phone from the bedside table. It was Zhou leiyun.

“Chief Zhou, why are you calling so late?” Xia ruofei asked sleepily,”what happened?” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“President Xia, something big has happened!” Zhou leiyun laughed out loud.”You’re really bold. You actually went to sleep! After dropping a bombshell on the internet, you’re just going to ignore it?”

Xia ruofei sat up and leaned against the headboard. He rubbed his nose and asked,””Chief Zhou, you mean that video? It shouldn’t spread that quickly, right?”

“You’ve really underestimated the sharpness of these reporters!” Zhou leiyun laughed out loud.”Almost all of the Spain sports media have reposted it. A few minutes ago, my assistant told me that it has spread throughout the entire European continent! The well – known sports media in France, the United Kingdom, and Italy all reposted the video without exception!”

“Is that so?” Xia ruofei perked up.”I was still thinking that if there’s no news tomorrow, I’ll use a roundabout strategy to save the country and mobilize the netizens in the country to spread the news on Facebook!”

“There’s no need for that!” Zhou leiyun said excitedly,”I think The Sports Daily is in a daze. They haven’t responded yet, but the netizens have already flooded their official website!”

“Hahaha!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”that saves me a lot of trouble! Fine! Since you’ve woken me up, I might as well get up and watch the show!”

“It’s a must!” Zhou leiyun said,”I’m not sleepy at all. You’re the one behind this. How can I miss such a Grand occasion?”

“That makes sense!” Xia ruofei lifted the blanket and got out of bed. He walked to the desk in his slippers and said,”I won’t talk to you anymore. Let’s go online and see what’s going on!”

“Alright!” Zhou leiyun said,”I’m just informing you. The Spanish clubs will also issue a stern statement of condemnation soon. I think that even if The Sports Daily doesn’t suffer a major blow this time, it will be enough to make them suffer!”

“Beat a dog in the water? It feels pretty good!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

After he hung up, he turned on the computer and started to browse the news online.

……

It was just past 6 am in China.

Many people were still asleep, and some people who had gotten up early for work were also racing against time to wash up and eat breakfast.

Meanwhile, the news from the distant European continent had already reached Huaxia.

At first, it was a few Chinese students in Spain who saw the news. They had participated in and watched the Chinese netizens ‘expedition to Facebook over the past two days. Now that they suddenly saw this news, it was like they had found a treasure.

The video faithfully recorded the whole process of what happened. There was no need for translation or subtitles at all, and everyone could see it clearly. Therefore, the students directly forwarded the video to China’s Weibo platform.

At that time, it was only four or FiveO’ clock in the morning in China. Other than a few night owls who had their day and night reversed, there were almost no people on Weibo, so no one paid much attention to this video at first.

However, these international students had been paying attention to the progress of the whole matter in Spain and had been constantly posting live broadcasts on Weibo.

They translated the reports of the Spain authoritative football media, such as Maca and as, into Chinese and posted screenshots on Weibo. Later, the sports media of some other football powerhouses in Europe also reposted the reports. The students who were studying abroad were even more excited. They could not feel their pajamas at all. They tirelessly translated the reposted reports of these authoritative media into Chinese and posted them on Weibo.

He was busy until Sixo’ clock in the morning, China time.

In a few hours, they had posted more than a dozen Weibo posts, and this was because some of the posts had been reported by several media outlets.
