2826 Courting death (1)

The video that Pablo had just uploaded wasn’t long. It was just a simple interview.

In the video, Pablo and a Bassa fan were sitting in a cafe. Pablo first introduced to the camera,””This is Mr. Meyers, an annual ticket member of bar?a. He was in the stands during the home game against RCD Espanyol the day before yesterday. Today, I would like to interview him on some of the hot topics of controversy in the past two days.”

Pablo turned to the big – bellied Mayers and asked with a smile,””Mr. Mayers, can you tell everyone what you saw after the game ended the day before yesterday?”

Meyers nodded and said,”the result of that game was frustrating. When the final whistle was blown, a lot of fans immediately left the stadium.” However, a few of my friends and I had to clean up the banners and flags that we brought into the arena, so we stayed behind. ”

Pablo said,”Oh? So you saw everything that happened after the match?”

“Yes!” Mayes replied.

“What Do You See?”

“Bar?a’s players were very sad to be killed at the last moment. They didn’t even give up and hurriedly left through the players ‘passageway. But we all understand the players’ feelings and are not dissatisfied with it ... The Spanish players were like poor people who suddenly picked up a hundred million euros. They ran all over the field and celebrated without restraint. Some players even made provocative gestures to the fans in the home stands who had not left. In short, he had the face of a villain! The fans who stayed behind naturally did not go easy on them and gave them a lot of boos!”

“That’s what a small ball game looks like,” Pablo shrugged and said.”Because a Lucky Ball beat bar?a by luck, they’ll probably brag about it for the rest of their lives! This was simply ridiculous in the eyes of the bar?a fans, who were used to victory! Mr. Mayers, Espanyol’s manager, Ruby, accused nokapu’s manager after the game, saying that the lights in the stadium were turned off and the water spray system was turned on before they even left the field. Their players were all drenched. Did you see that?”

The fat on Mayers ‘face jiggled exaggeratedly when he heard that. He shouted,””Do they have persecutory delusions? I didn’t see anything like Ruby said! Instead, we saw the Spanish players celebrating wildly on the field and then swaggering out of the field through the players ‘passageway!”

Pablo revealed a smile and said,”I believe that by this point, everyone already knows the truth of the matter?”

The video came to an abrupt end. Xia ruofei could not help but look shocked. He could not understand what Pablo was thinking by making this video. At that time, other than the Spanish players and fans, there were also many barcalé fans present. These people had seen the whole process of the incident. Was he so confident that no one would stand up to speak?

Zhou leiyun, on the other hand, was completely dumbfounded. He had no idea what the two of them were talking about.

“President Xia, what did they say?” Zhou leiyun asked.

Xia ruofei translated their conversation to Zhou leiyun with a weird expression, then asked,””Chief Zhou, what do you think this guy is thinking? It had happened in front of so many people, how could he turn black into white? At least there were some speculations in the previous comments. At most, people could only accuse him of sitting on a crooked seat. Now that he has made such a video, he must be crazy!”

Zhou leiyun pursed his lips and said,”he’s gone crazy from wanting to be famous!” Moreover, this B * stard was in the media industry, so he knew the advantage of having the right to speak in the process of spreading the news. I’ll analyze it for you! First of all, this was bar?a’s home ground. Most of the staff at the venue would not come out to tear down the stage, and the bar?a fans would probably not do so! As for the Spanish fans, they are limited by the number of tickets, so there are not many of them at the scene. These people are ordinary fans. Even if they stand up to refute, their voices will be very small. Perhaps the voices of their refusals will be directly drowned out by the ocean of the internet. And how can you prove that you were there at the time?”

Zhou leiyun paused for a moment before he continued,””And the Spanish players. You’re the parties involved. Are you going to come out and testify for yourself? And if the star players stood up, wouldn’t they cooperate with him to hype up the show? To put it bluntly, this grandson is barefooted and not afraid of wearing shoes. ” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Xia ruofei nodded thoughtfully and said,””I’m starting to admire this guy. At least he’s bold and black – hearted enough!”

Zhou leiyun laughed heartily.”Don’t tell me that you’re starting to appreciate this guy?” he asked.

At that moment, Song Wei and Ling Qingxue walked back. Ling Qingxue smiled and asked,””What are you two talking about? You’re so happy!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”we’re talking about the reporter from The Sports Daily.” This guy is really courting death!”

After that, Xia ruofei told them about Pablo’s interview. Song Wei and Ling Qingxue were dumbfounded. They did not expect such a thing to happen.

Song Wei could not hide the smile on her face and said,”Ruofei, he can’t turn back now! The time is ripe!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”almost, but I want to wait for ... Half a day!” He just posted this video, so it’s not influential enough. The mainstream media hasn’t reposted it yet, so let him be high for a while longer!”
