2518 Superstar cultivation plan (2)

In fact, even though Xia ruofei had obtained the great Dao formula, he had not given up on the little golden man body – tempering technique. Instead, he had always persevered in his cultivation. He had always felt that Qi and body – tempering complemented each other. It was like walking with two legs. If one of the legs had a problem, he would definitely not be able to walk fast.

However, this set of nine movements was too difficult. After Xia ruofei had cultivated the great Dao Arts, his cultivation had increased a lot and he had reached the ninth Qi realm. However, he could only do six of the little golden man’s movements in the entire set of body – refining techniques.

In fact, every time he observed the stone tablet, the little golden man would demonstrate a whole set of nine movements. However, if one’s physical fitness did not meet the cultivation requirements, they would forget those movements completely after watching them. Even if they tried very hard to recall, they would not be able to remember a single thing. And once the physical fitness met the requirements, the essentials of the next set of movements would immediately appear in the mind. It could be said to be quite magical.

With Xia ruofei’s current level of practice, it would not be a problem for him to teach Wu Lei the first movement that he had already mastered.

“Wu Lei,” Xia ruofei continued,”if you want to train with me, there are two things I must make clear to you.”

“Please speak!” Wu Lei quickly said.

“First of all, the movements I’m teaching you are a secret. You can’t tell anyone after you’ve learned them.” Xia ruofei said seriously.

“Of course, no problem!” Wu Lei said,”you should know that I’m a man of my word. Since you’ve specifically reminded me, I’ll definitely not reveal this to anyone, including my parents and family.” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”there’s one more thing. If you cultivate according to my method, it will be very painful. If you can’t endure it, you won’t be able to complete it.” So you have to think about it carefully. That kind of pain is really not a joke. Many tough men may not be able to persist. ”

Wu Lei did not hesitate and said firmly,””As long as I can become stronger, I’m willing to endure any pain!”

“OK!”Xia ruofei said,”in that case, let’s start now!” After you’ve mastered it, you can train by yourself in the future. ”

“I can’t wait!” Wu Lei said with a smile.

“Follow my movements!” Xia ruofei said.

Then, Xia ruofei skillfully performed the first set of the Golden Man’s movements that he had already practiced to the point where he was extremely familiar with it. For someone who had already practiced the sixth set of movements, the first set of movements was rather easy to do. Moreover, his current physical strength allowed him to do this set of movements without feeling any pain.

In other words, the first set of movements was no longer of any help to Xia ruofei.

Every set of the little golden man’s movements looked very strange. Some of the twists were no less than yoga, so on the surface, the two were very similar. It was just that the actual content was completely different, and the effects were naturally as different as heaven and earth.

Seeing Xia ruofei’s action, Wu Lei immediately followed suit and stood still.

As a professional football player, Wu Lei’s body was flexible. The movements were not difficult for him. However, he had watched Xia ruofei’s movements and could only imitate 70 – 80% of them. It was impossible for them to be exactly the same.

If the little golden man wanted his movements to have the effect of refining his body, he couldn’t make the slightest mistake. Even the slightest mistake wouldn’t have the slightest effect.

Therefore, Wu Lei did not feel anything special when he made that move.

Xia ruofei was too familiar with this movement. He only took a glance at Wu Lei and immediately judged that Wu Lei had deviated at least six times. Some of them were due to the angle, while some were not twisted enough.

“Stay in this position and don’t move!” Xia ruofei said.

Then, he stood up and walked to Wu Lei’s side. He corrected the deviations bit by bit. After every deviation was corrected, he would remind Wu Lei to remember the feeling and keep his movements.

Soon, Xia ruofei corrected the last mistake. It was the angle at which he raised his arm.

Before correcting this deviation, Xia ruofei said,””This is the last part that is not up to standard. After I correct it, you will feel severe pain. But you can rest assured that this movement will not harm your body. You just need to try your best to endure the pain and hold on for as long as you can. The longer you hold on, the better the improvement effect on your body. Do you understand?”

Wu Lei nodded slightly nervously.

Hence, Xia ruofei held onto Wu Lei’s arm and slowly moved back.

After Xia ruofei corrected the deviation, Wu Lei suddenly felt an intense pain. He groaned in pain.

However, he was already mentally prepared, so even if the pain was omnipresent, as if thousands of needles were stabbing his body at the same time, he still endured it and his movements did not change at all.

“Very good!” Xia ruofei encouraged him,”just keep this up. The longer you persist, the better!”

Wu Lei did not respond to Xia ruofei’s teasing. In order to maintain this position, one had to be fully focused and one could not move one’s body at all. Hence, he did not even dare to nod, let alone speak.

The pain continued to hit him, and Wu Lei had to clench his teeth and hold on. Even the muscles on his face were twitching.

Now, Wu Lei had truly experienced what it meant to pass a second like a year. Now, every second that passed felt as long as a year. It was not an exaggeration at all.

As time passed by, Wu Lei’s body couldn’t help but tremble. Finally, his trembling became more and more intense, and he finally left the state of practice due to the deviation of his movements.

Xia ruofei had been keeping a watch on Wu Lei’s time from the beginning. He waited until Wu Lei had exhausted himself and left the cultivation state. He then lay on the ground and panted heavily. He quickly glanced at the countdown on his phone and realized that Wu Lei had only been in the state of the little golden man for a little more than two minutes.

This number was not too bad, but compared to the first time Xia ruofei had practiced the body – tempering movements of the little golden man, it was much worse.

However, this was Wu Lei’s first time practicing the little golden man’s body – tempering movements. The fact that he could last for about two minutes already showed how strong his willpower was.

Fortunately, there was no one else in the room. If someone walked into Xia ruofei’s room, they would think that Xia ruofei had “humiliated” Wu Lei.

Xia ruofei chuckled and pulled Wu Lei up from the ground.””How do you feel?”

“It hurts!” Wu Lei said without hesitation,”President Xia, that feeling was too painful. It was the first time I’ve ever felt that in my life!”

“Other than the pain?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

“When I stopped the action, I felt so comfortable!” Wu Lei said. And it’s full of strength, as if every cell is cheering, even my bones are a few taels lighter!”

“This is the right feeling!” Xia ruofei said,”you can do this practice twice a day, but it must be absolutely accurate. Otherwise, it won’t work. I can help you correct it at the beginning, but you have to remember this set of movements as soon as possible. That way, you can continue to practice even when I return to China.”

“Understood!” “No!” Wu Lei said seriously,”as long as I can improve my strength, I can endure any pain!”

Xia ruofei chuckled and nodded.””Your clothes have been stained by your sweat, and the smell can be smelled from 800 miles away. You’d better go and wash up!“

In fact, what Wu Lei excreted was not only sweat, but also all kinds of impurities accumulated in his body. It was because of these impurities that Wu Lei’s physique was greatly strengthened.

After hearing Xia ruofei’s words, Wu Lei finally smelled the unpleasant smell. He quickly said,””President Xia, I’m going to take a shower and change my clothes. I want to practice again today. Please give me your advice!”
