The two of them walked through the tunnel, and soon, they had covered a short distance of six to seven meters. When they got close, they found that the tunnel had turned right here. They did not hesitate and continued to walk along the tunnel.

After turning the corner, the two of them advanced another ten meters. They stopped at the same time, their eyes revealing an extremely shocked expression.

In front of them, to be precise, there was a huge square under their feet. It was as big as two or three football fields. The tunnel stopped here. The square was about ten meters below the tunnel, as if the ground had caved in.

Besides, Xia ruofei also noticed that there were many dark tunnels on the opposite side of the mountain wall. There seemed to be many similar tunnels, all leading to this huge square.

Xia ruofei stood at the entrance of the tunnel and looked up. He couldn’t see how high the ceiling was, but he could vaguely see many bright spots, like stars in the sky, which illuminated the entire square below.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but click his tongue. The scale of this underground Palace had exceeded his imagination.

Furthermore, he had only descended three to four meters from the ground before reaching the corridor where the trap and kill array was located. Previously, he had been walking on flat ground without any ups and downs. However, the top that he saw now was a conservative estimate of tens of meters away from him.

This was simply too miraculous.

Could it be that we had unknowingly gone deep underground? Xia ruofei had this thought.

The sensing Jade Leaf he kept close to his body was already boiling hot. This meant that the world stone was very close to him.

Xia ruofei did not hesitate and immediately decided to go down to the square.

This tunnel was about 10 meters from the square below. If Xia ruofei was alone, he could easily go down. But if he had to bring Song Wei along, he would have to go through a lot of trouble. He was definitely not at ease Leaving Song Wei in this tunnel.

Xia ruofei took off his backpack and placed it on the ground. He searched around and found a military dagger. Without saying a word, he started to dig into the stone wall of the tunnel.

The rock was very hard, but Xia ruofei used his genuine Qi to quickly dig a hole in it.

He continued to dig and soon carved out a hollow part of the stone wall that looked like a doorknob. Then he dug a deep groove under the hollow.

After doing all this, Xia ruofei found another bundle of rope from his backpack. He threaded the rope through the hole and tied a firm climbing knot.

Xia ruofei tried it out and confirmed that the structure could bear the weight of two people.

“Let’s go down and take a look!”He said to Song Wei.

Song Wei looked at the 10 – meter drop and a hint of timidity flashed in her eyes. However, she quickly nodded and said,”En!”

Xia ruofei took out a band from his backpack and tied both of their backpacks to the end of the rope. Then, they went down the rope.

He wrapped the bandage around his waist and smiled.””In order to ensure our safety, you have to be tied to me! Don’t worry, I’ll bring you to a safe landing!”

Song Wei blushed and walked to Xia ruofei.””Tie him up!”

Xia ruofei carefully tied her to himself with a bandage. Their bodies were very close to each other. Her soft and delicate body made Xia ruofei’s heart flutter.

He calmed himself down and sat down at the edge of the tunnel with Song Wei. He grabbed the rope and said,””Go!”

Xia ruofei kicked lightly and the two of them were thrown out of the tunnel. Song Wei was so scared that she hugged Xia ruofei’s waist tightly and did not even dare to open her eyes. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

With the help of the rope, the two of them started to move back and forth. Xia ruofei stepped on the mountain wall skillfully and started to descend rhythmically.

Soon, the two of them stepped on solid ground and arrived at the ground of this huge square.

Song Wei only opened her eyes when Xia ruofei let go of her bandage. She could not care less about her shyness and immediately started to observe the huge square curiously.
