2024 Dead end (1)

Xia ruofei used the force from the outer wall to slow down a few times before landing lightly on the ground.

At this time, the group of bodyguards who had rushed in from the front of the building had climbed up almost seven or eight floors.

Only the framework of the building had been built. The four outer walls had not been built yet. Hence, they were all dumbfounded when they saw Xia ruofei descending from the sky like a giant Roc.

There’s such an operation

The group of bodyguards hurriedly rushed to the other side. However, they could only see Xia ruofei land lightly on the ground and then quickly escape into the dark rainy night at an unbelievable speed.

The bodyguards fired a few shots in the direction that Xia ruofei had disappeared in despair. Then, they ran down the stairs in a mess and chased after him.

But how could these people catch up to Xia ruofei

Not to mention that after Xia ruofei entered the woods, he immediately changed his direction and ran towards lui Hai’s car.

While the bodyguards were still searching in the wet woods with their last hope, Xia ruofei had already left the construction site in lui Hai’s car.

Xiao en and the other snipers had been killed. The remaining members of the black gang were no match for the Hong sect. There was no need for Xia ruofei and lui hai to stay here.

News from the Hong sect kept coming in.

That night, the Gelman family was like a stray dog, beaten to a pulp by the Hong sect. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

On the other hand, Xia ruofei had been receiving information from Lyu zhengfeng. Soon, he and Lyu hai killed the last two targets.

Xia ruofei already knew that the important figures of the Gelman family had snipers around them, so he paid special attention when he took action.

He had even used his years of experience in the Special Forces to find the hidden sniper and kill him before he even killed the core members of the Gelman family.

The assassination operation was naturally extremely smooth.

Now, other than the head of the family, the core members of the family had all been killed by Xia ruofei. The lower – Level members had also been defeated by the Hong sect. Even if the Gelman family was not dead, they would be crippled.

When Xia ruofei killed the last core member of the Gehrman family named robto, he returned to the car. Lui hai immediately handed him a dry towel. The rain was getting heavier and heavier, and Xia ruofei was inevitably wet.

Xia ruofei took the towel and dried his hair as he asked,Ah hai, how’s the battle situation at zhengfeng

Lui hai said excitedly,Mr. Xia, the Gelman family is in complete chaos. All the core members have been killed. The subordinates are not in the mood to fight anymore. Zhengfeng has gained a lot tonight!

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.Tell them to keep up the good work. We must completely eradicate this family tonight! Otherwise, the police would definitely increase their patrols and surveillance on the gangs tomorrow, which would make it inconvenient for them to do anything! In addition, the Gelman family will definitely ask for help from the glory society. You should also be careful of this!

Lui hai was full of confidence, saying,Don’t worry! We’re also keeping an eye on the glory society! If they dare to act rashly, then they better be prepared for an all – out war with us!

Then, lui hai asked expectantly,Mr. Xia, are we going to Moore Manor next

Although the manor had been changed to the Gehrman Manor after the fall of the Moore family, lui hai still called it the same.

Xia ruofei nodded.Contact zhengfeng. He should be able to send some people over now. Let’s bring some people over and kill them!

Yes! Lui hai answered with excitement.

Although lui hai was very excited when Xia ruofei killed the core members of the Gelman family, he could only hide far away and watch from the side. He still felt unhappy.

Therefore, when he heard that Xia ruofei was going to take them into the German Manor, lui hai couldn’t hold back his excitement. He immediately took out his phone and called LV zhengfeng.

Zhengfeng! How are things on your side Lui hai said as soon as the call was connected,Mr. Xia ordered us to transfer some people here, and ... You come here yourself. He will take us to attack the Gelman Manor!

Lu zhengfeng had always been a brave and ruthless person. Tonight, he had brought his brothers from the Hong sect’s Turin branch. Every time, he would rush to the front, regardless of the danger. So, when he heard that they were going to destroy the old nest of the Gelman family, Lu zhengfeng was so excited that he almost jumped up.

He immediately gathered his men and drove to meet lui hai outside the city. Then they drove towards the direction of the German Manor.

......

In the Gelman Manor, phone calls came in one after another. Old Gelman collapsed in his chair, his face ashen.

Pieces of information were being collected. Pieces of territory that originally belonged to the Gelman family had been conquered, and the members of the underworld had suffered heavy losses. What drove him crazy was that almost all of the core members of his family had been killed, including his most valued sons, grandsons, and his brothers and cousins ...

Old Gelman already knew that after tonight, the Gelman family would probably be removed from the family ...
