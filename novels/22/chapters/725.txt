Chapter 726: Allocated (1)

Ma Zhiming and Tian Huixin also leisurely picked up a lychee, peeled it, and put it into their mouths.

In fact, the cooperation with the Paradise Corporation to sell this batch of fruits had already been decided before Ma Zhiming’s family set off. No matter what the quality of this batch of fruits was, Ma Zhiming would definitely not hesitate to do Xia ruofei a small favor.

Therefore, the two of them didn’t look like they were on an inspection, but more like they were on an outing or having a farmhouse. Their expressions were also very leisurely.

However, when the lychees entered their mouths, their eyes lit up.

As members of Hong Kong’s wealthy families, what kind of high – end fruit had Ma Zhiming and Tian Huixin not eaten? However, the Taoyuan organic lychee still gave them a breathtaking feeling.

Especially the natural sweet taste, it made the two of them feel like they couldn’t stop.

Little Huanhuan, who was beside him, shouted happily,””It’s so delicious! Brother ruofei, I want more!”

Xia ruofei smiled lovingly. He peeled another lychee and fed it to Huanhuan.

While eating, Huan Huan said vaguely,””Mom, dad, ruofei Gege’s lychees are much more delicious than ours!”

Ma Zhiming and Tian Huixin couldn’t help but reveal a strange expression. It was indeed a little embarrassing that a world – Class tycoon couldn’t enjoy this kind of fruit.

However, a child’s words carried no harm, and what Huanhuan said was true.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Huanhuan, eat more if it’s delicious. Brother ruofei has enough fruits here!” But you’d better leave some space in your stomach, there are still very delicious cherries over there!”

......

“En!” Huan Huan nodded heavily.

After tasting the lychees, they walked to the cherry Garden.

When they saw the purple – Red cherries, which were almost the size of ping – pong balls and were crystal clear, Ma Zhiming and Tian Huixin couldn’t help but take a deep breath.

The air was filled with the faint fragrance of natural fruits, which made people feel relaxed and happy.

The appearance of these cherries was too good. They were simply comparable to the peach Garden vegetables, like a piece of art.

Very quickly, Huanhuan, under Xia ruofei’s protection, impatiently went up the tree to pick a lot of cherries.

After Ma Zhiming’s family tasted the cherries, they were all conquered by the deliciousness without exception.

Huan Huan kept stuffing the juice into her mouth. Her pink cheeks were stained with the purple – red fruit juice, but she did not notice it.

Ma Zhiming and Tian Huixin looked at each other. They had come with the intention of returning a small favor to Xia ruofei.

However, after some inspection, Ma Zhiming found that the organic fruits of Paradise Corporation were fully qualified to enter the premium fruit stores under Hengfeng group. It was not an exaggeration to say that even in the high – end fruit sales chain of Hengfeng group, there was no fruit that could compare to paradise lychees and paradise cherries.

Ma Zhiming’s attitude had completely changed. He said with a trace of enthusiasm,”Xia Sheng, the quality of Taoyuan fruit is beyond my expectations. This kind of high – end or even top – grade fruit is exactly the same as the positioning of our premium fruit store under Hengfeng. I hope to be fully in charge of the sales of all the fruits for your company this year. The pricing can be decided by you! I can also decide to waive the channel fees, you only need to pay the necessary logistics and labor costs!”

Ma Zhiming was now completely conquered by Taoyuan fruit. Even if he didn’t earn a single cent, he was still willing to act as an agent for such top – grade fruits.

This was a very good promotion for Hengfeng’s high – end fruit brand. The invisible profit was far higher than the profit of the channel fee.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Mr. MA, I’m afraid there’s no way to be a full agent. Our paradise Corporation is currently focused on the domestic market. Although your fruit chain store also has branches in the country, its position is too high – end and too niche. From the perspective of our brand promotion, I definitely need to allocate a portion of the quota to other mass – Market super – Commercial channels.”

Xia ruofei had an unusual relationship with Ma Zhiming’s family, so he didn’t beat around the bush. Instead, he spoke his mind directly.Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Ma Zhiming revealed a trace of regret, but he quickly said,”I understand. Xia Sheng, then please give us as much as you can if the conditions allow!”

“That’s for sure!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”we’re old friends. I’ll definitely do what I can. Mr. MA, I’ll try my best to give your company about half of the quota! I really can’t do anything about the other half. ”

“Thank you!” Ma Zhiming was overjoyed when he heard that. Thank you!”

Xia ruofei continued,”by the way, our farm has been expanding recently. It’s about to be checked and accepted. By then, our production capacity can be increased by about three times. We should be able to increase the quota of paradise vegetables for you.”

“That’s really good news!”Ma Zhiming said happily. At the moment, Peach Garden vegetables are in short supply in all the major hotel chains and high – end clubs around the world!”

In fact, Ma Zhiming had wanted to ask Xia ruofei to supply more Taoyuan vegetables for a long time. However, he knew the scale of Taoyuan farm. In order not to put Xia ruofei in a difficult position, he had never mentioned this.

Now that Xia ruofei had taken the initiative to mention it, Ma Zhiming was naturally overjoyed.

Ma Zhiming’s company was very busy, and Huanhuan had to participate in some talent learning during the summer vacation. Therefore, their family had to return to Hong Kong tomorrow. It was also because of this that they had to use a private jet this time.
