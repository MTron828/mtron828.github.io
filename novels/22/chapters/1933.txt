Chapter 1934 Boundless despair (1)

“Grandpa ...” Liu haojun said awkwardly,”I ... I ...”

“Aren’t you good at talking? Why did you stop?” The old man said sternly,”now, our Liu family has become the laughing stock of the whole capital! It’s all your fault!”

“I ... I’ve already dealt with this matter!” Liu haojun’s face was full of disbelief.”Weibo and the program have already been deleted!”

“That’s why I said you have a pig’s brain!” The old man said without any mercy,”go online and see for yourself. There are ugly scenes of you everywhere! Are you that desperate? You’re even provoking a married woman!”

“Grandpa, I was wrong!” Liu haojun immediately panicked and didn’t dare to quibble anymore.

The old man sighed. His tone was no longer as angry as before, but rather a little bleak.”Come back to Beijing tomorrow!”

“Grandpa, what ... What do you mean?” Liu haojun asked in a trembling voice.

“I’ll get someone to take care of the organization’s procedures. In the future, you shouldn’t stay in the organization. You ... Are not suitable!” The old man said.

Like a bolt from the blue, Liu haojun was stunned.

The old man was serious this time! Organization program? What organizational procedures? It’s definitely to settle the procedures for his automatic resignation!

The rank of the Vice Director and the position of an even higher one in the future were all gone just like that? Was he abandoned by his family just like that? Liu haojun felt like he was in a dream.

“Grandpa, please don’t ...” Liu haojun begged,”I really know I was wrong ... I won’t do it again!” Please give me another chance! I ... I’ll definitely work hard and not embarrass the Liu family!”

“Haven’t I given you enough opportunities over the years?” The old man retorted indifferently,”when have you ever truly repented? Besides, this matter has blown up so much. Do you really think you can still stay in the southeast province? Could it be that this country is owned by our family?”

Liu haojun’s face was ashen, but he still said unwillingly,””Grandpa, I ... I can go to a more difficult place!”

“Enough!” The old man chided,”Liu haojun, when have I ever changed my decision? Go back to the capital tomorrow, don’t force me to send people to catch you!”

Liu haojun’s face was full of despair. He still struggled and said,””Grandpa, my ... My leg was broken by someone. I ... I can’t even get out of bed ...”

He was pretending to be pitiful. If the old master’s heart ached for him, he might just soften and take back his order.

Liu haojun knew very well that he would only have a glimmer of hope if he stayed at the three mountains. Once he returned to the capital, he would be completely abandoned by his family.

There were many people in the Liu family. Even in the direct line, there were many uncles and brothers. The son of his third uncle, Liu Haoping, graduated from the National College Entrance Examination two years ago. It was said that he was already doing very well in the Ministry. He was only the eldest grandson of the eldest branch of the family. If he failed this time, the family could turn to train Liu Haoping.

In the future, he, Liu haojun, would have no future to speak of. He might still be able to live a carefree life, but at best, he would just be a useless person raised by his family. His status would not even be as high as Liu haofan, who started running a business after graduating from university!

However, what made Liu haofan’s heart turn cold was that the old man said without thinking,””It doesn’t matter if you can’t get out of bed! You can apply for the airline to provide medical monitoring and transfer services. I’ll get someone to make an appointment for you tonight, and it’ll definitely be ready tomorrow afternoon! It’s decided!”

Passengers who could not move freely could apply for medical service from the airline in advance. For Liu haojun’s case, he needed to be transferred while lying down, so it would take some time to modify the seat. However, these were all standard components, and the modification speed was very fast. It would definitely not be a problem to make an appointment a day in advance.

The old man hung up the phone right after he finished speaking. He didn’t give Liu haojun any chance to beg for mercy.

After Liu haojun heard that, he was in complete despair. Elder Xuanji was determined to send him back!

The phone was already dead, but Liu haojun was still holding the phone tightly and sitting on the bed with a dull expression.

“Secretary Liu, what did the old man say?” Old Zhou asked with concern.

Liu haojun slowly turned his head to look at ol ‘Zhou and muttered,””It’s over ... Old Zhou, it’s all over ... The old man knows everything. He ... He wants me to return to the capital tomorrow ... In the future ... In the future, I’ll have no hope ...”

“Secretary Liu, please admit your mistake to the old man when you get back!” Old Zhou quickly comforted him. You’re his grandson, he won’t ignore your future!”

“Impossible ...” Liu haojun laughed bitterly.”The old man is completely disappointed in me this time. He won’t care about me anymore ...”

Then, Liu haojun unwillingly said,””Old Zhou! Hurry up and turn on your computer! Didn’t you say that there wasn’t much on the internet and that after Haixi satellite TV deleted their Weibo post, the news basically stopped spreading? Why did the old man say that the entire internet was flooded with it? This doesn’t seem right. ”

Old Zhou quickly turned on his laptop.

Liu haojun took it and randomly opened a few forums with relatively high traffic through the navigation website. He was immediately dumbfounded.

This post could be seen on almost every forum, and it was basically a hot post with a lot of views and replies. Several forums even pinned the post to the top because the post was more popular.

Liu haojun didn’t want to give up. He clicked on a few more websites. Every time he opened a few, his heart would turn cold. In the end, he couldn’t help but shout and smash his laptop on the ground.

“How could this be? How did this happen?” Liu haojun was like a trapped beast. His eyes were red as he shouted,”it’s only been a short while. Why ... Why are there so many posts on the internet? And he even mentioned me ...”

Old Zhou looked at Liu haojun with pity. He had worked for the Liu family for more than ten years and knew old Liu’s character and temper very well. When he saw the posts on the internet, he knew that old Liu was serious this time because Liu haojun’s behavior had crossed the line and was something that old Liu would not tolerate.

“Young master, someone must be behind this!” Old Zhou said.

He no longer called Liu haojun “Secretary Liu” because Liu haojun’s position as the Deputy Secretary was definitely over. Now, he called Liu haojun “Secretary Liu”, which was even more exciting for Liu haojun. Therefore, he simply changed back to the address he used in Beijing.

“Who would it be?” Liu haojun said. Then, he frowned and said thoughtfully,”perhaps, this whole thing was planned by someone behind the scenes. It’s definitely not a coincidence!”

Old Zhou nodded.”If we investigate carefully, we should be able to find some clues. But young master, you’re going back to the capital tomorrow. There’s no point in talking about this now.”

At that moment, Liu haojun’s phone rang again. This time, it was his father, Liu Bo.

Liu haojun answered the phone without a second word.

Liu Bo was even more impatient than the old man, and as soon as the call connected, he couldn’t help but curse,”Liu haojun! What the f * ck did you do! The old master is almost sick from anger! Can’t you just stop for a while? You ... You unfilial son! You’ll die on a woman’s stomach sooner or later!”

“Dad!” Liu haojun said with a sad face. You have to help me! Grandpa, he ... He wants to kick me out of the system ...”

Liu Bo said unhappily,”help?” How can I help? You’ve done such an embarrassing thing, I can’t even lift my head in the family! Besides ... When has the lordmaster ever changed his decision?”

“Dad! This time I’ve been tricked!” Liu haojun said hatefully,”this is obviously planned by someone behind the scenes. Otherwise, how could it spread so fast?”

“Hmph!” Liu Bo snorted and said,”do you think your grandfather and I are old fools? If you can see it, how can we not? However, no matter what, a fly wouldn’t bite a seamless egg. If there was no sh * t under your butt, would others be able to harm you? Liu haojun, you’re getting worse and worse! Isn’t it easy to get a woman? Why do you have to find a married woman of all people?”

“Dad ... I know I’m wrong!” Liu haojun said,”I’ve regretted it for a long time ... But ... I’m really not willing to accept this! Are we just going to suffer in silence?”

“Hmph! You don’t need to worry about that!” Liu Bo said,”this matter must definitely be investigated! But no matter what the result is, it has nothing to do with you! You better come back here tomorrow! You’re not allowed to leave the house as long as the old man is still angry!”

Liu haojun said pitifully,”dad ... My legs are broken. I can’t go out even if I want to ...”

Hearing this, Liu Bo’s facial muscles couldn’t help trembling.

No matter how good – for – nothing Liu haojun was, he was still his son. As the saying went, father and son were connected by heart. When he heard that Liu haojun’s leg had been broken by Fang Chenchen’s husband and his men, he was very distressed. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Alright, that’s enough!” Liu Bo gritted his teeth and said,”the person who hit you will pay the price! The person who planned this behind the scenes would have to pay the price! You don’t have to act pitiful here! There was no room for discussion about returning to the capital! Just like this!”

With that, Liu Bo hung up the phone.

Liu haojun threw his phone to the side and stared at the ceiling with an ashen face. His heart was filled with despair.

“Young master ...” Old Zhou called out softly.

Liu haojun waved his hand and said,”old Zhou, go and make the arrangements. I’m going to be discharged tomorrow ... We should go back to the capital ...”

“Young master, is there no room for discussion?” Even though Lao Zhou had already expected this, he still couldn’t bear to ask.

Liu haojun shook his head dejectedly and closed his eyes.”You go! I want to sleep for a while ...”

“Yes!” Lao Zhou got up and dimmed the lights in the ward. He then walked out and gently closed the door.

……

On the afternoon of the second day, a Boeing plane headed for Sanya took off from Sanshan airport. Xu Yougang, Zeng Liang, Wang Chong, and Zhang Aijun were on this plane.

Almost at the same time, an ambulance arrived at the airport. The aviation Medical team received Liu haojun, who was lying on a stretcher, from the doctors of the provincial Hospital. They then transported him to the tarmac on an electric transportation vehicle.

Old Zhou was also with Liu haojun.

On the tarmac, an empty plane was waiting quietly.

The plane had undergone the necessary modifications in the morning. A row of seats had been dismantled, and the stretcher had been fixed.

Liu haojun was settled at the back of the cabin. After the preparations were done, the ordinary passengers began to board the plane.

About half an hour later, the vacant flight to Beijing also took off smoothly.

The three mountains seemed to have calmed down in an instant.

But in fact, the storm of public opinion on the internet did not stop. Instead, it was becoming more and more intense.
