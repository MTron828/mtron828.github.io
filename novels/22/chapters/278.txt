After walking on this path for a while, eccentric song stopped and observed for a long time. The place he was looking for had not been here for many years. With the passage of time and man – made development, the terrain near the village had also changed, so he needed to look carefully. Eccentric song walked forward a little more uncertainly. When he saw a large pine tree between two hills, he finally showed a trace of joy and said to himself,”Looks like we’re in the right place!” After saying that, elder song sped up a little. Soon, the group had walked about a mile into the mountain along the path. Then, elder song found a narrow path that was almost covered by weeds. Huang Fang saw that elder song was about to walk into the small path, so he quickly motioned for his two subordinates to open a path in front. This small path could only accommodate two people walking side by side, and it was overgrown with weeds. If a snake or something were to hide inside, it would be big trouble. Song Rui carefully supported elder song and asked,””Grandpa, why did you bring us to this barren mountain?” Eccentric song’s eyes revealed a trace of nostalgia. “You’ll know when we get there. ” This narrow and winding path was not easy to walk on, and everyone’s speed was much slower. After walking for about ten minutes, elder song also showed a trace of fatigue. “Chief, please take a seat and rest for a while!” Xia ruofei said hurriedly. “It’s alright, I can do it!” Eccentric song waved his hand and said, slightly breathless. Manager Lu also showed a helpless expression. Along the way, not to mention elder song, even he himself, who was a little older, felt that it was a bit too much. However, since the old man had spoken, everyone could only obey. Xia ruofei took out a mineral water bottle from his bag and said,””Chief, have some water! Since we’re already here, there’s no need to rush. ” Elder song took the bottle of mineral water with a smile and said,”Alright! Then we’ll listen to little Xia!” The bottle contained a solution of flower petals that Xia ruofei had prepared in advance. It was diluted with a large amount of water from the spatial pool. Although the flower petals were very rare, it was enough for the old man to recover some of his strength. Elder song returned the bottle to Xia ruofei after he finished half of it. He stood up and said,”let’s go!” I’m not even tired! You guys shouldn’t have any problems with that, right?” “No problem!” Manager Lu quickly said. Chief, please pay attention to your feet. ” Thus, the group continued to walk into the mountain. After walking for another ten minutes, elder song finally stopped and said,””This is the place!” Everyone stopped and saw that this place was overgrown with wild grass. There was nothing special about it. However, elder song had already walked into the bushes. After elder song pushed aside the weeds, everyone saw a mottled gravestone. “Chief, this is ...” Manager Lu couldn’t help but ask. Eccentric song looked at the grave that was completely covered by weeds and sighed,””One of my comrades is sleeping here ...” Everyone was stunned. This small grave hidden in the weeds was actually a martyr’s grave? Xia ruofei was the first to react. He quickly walked forward and said,””Everyone, let’s help!” Manager Lu and the others quickly came forward to help clean up. There was strength in numbers. Soon, the weeds around the wild grave were cleared, and a clean open space was cleared in front of the grave. It was a mottled stone tablet that had been through a lot of wind and rain, and behind it was a small grave. If not for elder song, no one would have thought that a martyr was buried here. The words on the stone tablet were still barely discernible. The words “martyr Yan Xiaodong’s grave” were written on it in large font. Next to it was a line of small characters with a series of Army codenames and martyr Yan Xiaodong’s hometown “donggao village, Xingguo County, gan province”. This Yan Xiaodong actually came from the famous “Jiangjun County.” Eccentric song stared at the gravestone for a long time before turning back and saying,”Xiao Rui, take out the things I asked you to prepare!” Song Rui quickly took down his backpack and took out cigarettes, white wine, yellow paper, candles, and other items. It was only then that he realized that his grandfather had asked him to prepare these items when he was in Sanshan city. It turned out that it was to pay respects to his comrades. Elder song personally placed the offerings in front of the grave one by one and lit the incense. He also lit three Huaxia brand cigarettes and stuck them into the soil in front of the grave. Then he poured three glasses of wine and silently sprinkled them on the ground. Song Rui was helping to burn the paper money. Everyone stood silently to the side and did not disturb the old man who was reminiscing about his comrades. After a long while, eccentric song sighed and stared at the gravestone.”Back then, after the army liberated Chong ‘an County, they continued South. Although the enemy’s main force was defeated, the terrain in this area was complicated, and the mountains were high and the forests were dense. So, a small group of troops entered the mountains to become bandits. Thus, our troops were left behind to clear out the remaining enemies.” Elder song’s gaze was very distant as he spoke, as if he had traveled back in time and returned to the smoke – filled years. “Xiaodong was only nineteen when he died. He was my guard.” Elder song said,”at that time, I was escorting more than a dozen soldiers to transport supplies. We were ambushed here by the remaining enemies. Xiaodong blocked the Fatal Bullet for me ...” Everyone was silent. Xia ruofei looked at the old tombstone silently. In those days of war, countless martyrs had fallen on the road to war. As their descendants and former soldiers, Xia ruofei had always held high respect for these martyrs. “He’s only nineteen!”Elder song continued. There were only eight enemies that day, and a cheap bullet had taken his life. I still remember what he said to me before he died,”Company commander, help me tell my mother that my son can’t be filial to her anymore ...” At this point, elder song’s eyes couldn’t help but tear up. A General’s success was built on ten thousand bones. Elder song had experienced the deaths of many of his comrades in his life, but this experience had become an indelible mark in his life. “Chief, how come there’s no one to take care of this martyr Yan Xiaodong’s resting place?” manager Lu couldn’t help but ask. This ...” “This monument was rebuilt thirty years ago when I came to pay my respects to Xiaodong,” elder song said lightly.”Back then, there was only one wooden board to mark this position ... There used to be a Garrison nearby, and people would come to visit the tomb every year. Later, the defense of the troops might have been adjusted and transferred away! It seems like Xiaodong’s grave has been abandoned for many years ...” “What is the local government doing?!” Manager Lu said indignantly,”chief, I’ll call the relevant comrades in the southeast province immediately. This is too outrageous!” “There’s no need for that, Xiao Lu,”elder song waved his hand. “Once you appear, things will change. When that time comes, a large group of people will be walking on thin ice and come to apologize one by one. Maybe in order to please me, they will even start a big construction, rebuild the grave, and set up a statue. This will go against my original intention, and I don’t think Xiaodong wants this to happen.” “But ...” Manager Lu found it hard to understand. “I believe that Xiaodong would rather watch over the mountains and rivers that he once fought for,” eccentric song said lightly. Elder song continued,”I’m also responsible for this. I didn’t want things to turn out this way, so I didn’t come out to greet you. I’ve been wanting to come and see you all these years, but I couldn’t get away because of various things. That’s why my brother’s grave is so deserted.” Xia ruofei was also very touched by elder song’s decision to be the leader of this generation. It could be said that he had no selfish thoughts at all. If it were a few of the current officials, this would be simply unimaginable. Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”chief, I suggest that we privately fund the repair of this martyr’s tomb without alerting the local government. Also, we can hire a villager nearby to come over and maintain it regularly.”
