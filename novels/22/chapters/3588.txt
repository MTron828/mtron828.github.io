Translator: 549690339

Although it was already midnight on the peach source Island, the weather was very good tonight. A full moon hung in the sky, and the bright moonlight shone on the sea, making the waves shimmering beautifully.

There was a thin layer of mist on the surface of the sea near the Paradise Island, as if it was covered by a thin veil. From a distance, the Paradise Island seemed to be shrouded in mist, giving it a kind of Fairy Island charm.

Song Qiming stared ahead without blinking and asked,””RUO Fei, is that the Paradise Island?”

“Yes! How do you feel?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

“It’s really like an Island of Immortals!” Song Qiming praised. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

As Xia ruofei steered the black Phoenix flying ship closer to the Peach Blossom Island, he chuckled and said,””Uncle song, because of the great formation on the island, the spiritual Qi is locked inside the island. You haven’t felt it clearly yet, but once we enter the island, you’ll know what a real Holy Land for cultivation is.”

“I’m sure you won’t want to come out once you’ve entered the island, dad,”said Song Wei with a smile. At that time, you might even have the idea of resigning and permanently staying on Peach Blossom Island!”

Song Qiming did not know whether to laugh or cry. “You’re exaggerating! However, 1 really don’t have much desire for an official position. I just want to do more for the country and its people while I still have some energy…”

Xia ruofei could tell that song Qiming was not being high – Profile. He was speaking from the bottom of his heart.

“Uncle song, you’re no longer an ordinary person. With your current cultivation, you’ll still be in good health even when you’re 80 or 90 years old. I guarantee you’ll have endless energy!”

“But the country has a retirement age!” Song Qiming smiled and said,”different ranks correspond to different retirement ages. No matter how healthy I am, I have to retire when I’m of age. At that time, I will be able to cultivate with you without any distractions!”

While everyone was chatting, the black Phoenix flying ship had already arrived at the perimeter of the array formation of the Peach Blossom Island.

Xia ruofei skillfully used his spiritual power to penetrate the array and reach the control core. He opened a hole in the protective barrier and the black Phoenix flying ship nimbly entered.

Very quickly, the protective boundary of the great void clear sky formation was restored, and the black Phoenix flying ship had already passed through the Peach Blossom Island.

The black Phoenix flying ship’s invisibility formation was still in operation, so the ordinary people on the island were completely unable to detect its presence. In fact, it was already midnight. Other than a few people on duty and the night guards, everyone else had already fallen asleep.

From the black Phoenix flying ship, one could clearly see everything on the island through the moonlight.

It just so happened that the black Phoenix flying ship was still flying at a certain altitude. Hence, Xia ruofei and the rest could have a clear view of the island from the deck.

Song Qiming could not help but exclaim,’the spiritual Qi is indeed very rich after entering the island! I feel like my dantian is cheering!”

“This is the first time you’ve come to a place with such rich spirit Qi. This is a normal reaction.” Song Wei said with a smile.

Song Qiming looked at the Paradise Island below the flying boat and mumbled,””An airport, a dock, a power station … There were also military camps and high – Level defensive caves … Ruofei, it must have been very difficult to build these basic facilities! This Island is isolated from the sea …”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Uncle song, you might not know this. This Island used to belong to the Liu family. Most of the basic facilities were built by the Liu family over the years.”

“The Liu family?” Song Qiming’s gaze froze.”The Liu family from the capital?”

“That’s right!” Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”I once treated old master Liu’s illness. At that time, this Island was still called green cloud Island. The Liu family offered to give me the island as a gift for the treatment fee. After I came to investigate, I found out that it was a cultivation treasure land, so 1 agreed to this condition without hesitation.”

“Your luck is really…” Song Qiming could not help but sigh. He then said,”it seems that the Liu family has been planning overseas for many years. They’ve done quite a lot!”

Song Qiming’s eyes were sharp. One look at the facilities on Peach Blossom Island and he knew that the Liu family had built this place as a refugee camp. It was probably one of their family’s trump cards.

However, old master Liu’s life was in danger. In order to get Xia ruofei to save his life, he had to give up this trump card.

“Well, a cunning rabbit has Three Burrows!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”l think the Liu family has more than one such place. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have given it to me so easily. However, I’m not interested in these things. If I hadn’t discovered that the Paradise Island was a cultivation treasure land, I wouldn’t even want this Island!”

As they spoke, the black Phoenix flying ship had already arrived above the Yanhuang building. Xia ruofei controlled the Flying Ship to descend as he smiled.””We’re here!”

The black Phoenix flying ship quickly hovered above the Yanhuang building’s rooftop.

Li Yifu and Zheng Yongshou also appeared on the rooftop at almost the same time as the black Phoenix flying boat entered the vicinity of peach source Island. They had already noticed it. This time, Xia ruofei deliberately flew slower, so when the two of them arrived at the rooftop, the flying boat was also lowering its altitude.

Although it was already midnight on the peach source Island, the weather was very good tonight. A full moon hung in the sky, and the bright moonlight shone on the sea, making the waves shimmering beautifully..
