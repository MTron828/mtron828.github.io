3092 The newbie, Chen Xuan (2)

Then, Tao Ran looked at Chen Xuan and asked,””You’re Chen Xuan, right?” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Yes, you can call me little Chen,” Chen Xuan replied with a smile.

On the surface, Tao Ran, who was in his thirties, could be the uncle of Chen Xuan, who was in his forties.

You can’t judge a book by its cover.

“Okay, okay, okay. I’ll call you Xiao Chen then.” Tao Ran said,”you’ve been in this business for years, right? Have you done any big projects before?”

Even though Chen Xuan looked a lot younger than his actual age, he didn’t look like a young man in his early twenties. He looked like he was in his mid – twenties, and most programmers at his age wouldn’t have just debuted. Otherwise, they would be left behind by the younger generation in a few years. For programmers above the age of 35, unless they were promoted to a management position, the elimination rate was extremely high if they were purely focused on technical skills.

This was why Tao Ran had assumed that Chen Xuan was at least a skilled worker.

Yang Xincheng cleared his throat and said,””ERM ... Taoran, Chen Xuan doesn’t have much work experience. You have to guide him ...”

Yang Xincheng immediately said,””But his technique is very good! He’s so fast at coding!”

Tao Ran couldn’t help but be speechless. He originally thought that yang Xincheng had sent him a skilled coding expert, but it turned out to be an older intern.

Tao Ran revealed an awkward expression and said,””President yang, you know ... Our group has the most important task. I’m afraid we don’t have the energy to take care of the interns! Why don’t you ... Put Xiao Chen in another group?”

Before the development Department was set up, Tao Ran and yang Xincheng were in the same Department, so they were yang Xincheng’s old subordinates. That was why they dared to bargain with their superior.

Yang Xincheng didn’t know whether to laugh or cry,”Tao Ran, you didn’t think that I’d force an intern for you to take care of, did you?” What are you thinking? I’ve already said that I personally interviewed Chen Xuan. He’s extremely skilled! He may be lacking in work experience, but as long as you use him properly, he’ll soon be able to play an important role. ” “Is that so?” Tao Ran obviously didn’t believe him. He laughed drily and said,”President yang, since little Chen’s skills are not bad, why don’t you just put him in old bull’s group?”

Yang Xincheng’s face darkened as he said,”kid, are you itching for a beating?” The reason why I assigned Chen Xuan to your group was because I saw that your mission was too heavy, so I wanted to add a strong helper to your team! You still dare to refuse?”

“I wouldn’t dare!” Tao Ran quickly said with a smile.

Yang Xincheng waved his hand and said,”it’s settled then!” Take care of Chen Xuan personally during this period of time! You’re not allowed to bully me!”

“Alright, alright!” Tao Ran said,”don’t worry, President yang. I’m such an honest person. Why would I bully others?”

Yang Xincheng ignored him and turned to Chen Xuan.””Chen Xuan, show this brat what you’re capable of when you have the chance!” The elder roared.

Chen Xuan smiled.”You must be joking, chief yang. I’m here to learn from all of you seniors. Team leader Tao is naturally my role model as well.”

“This attitude is even better! The company is now focusing on developing the online shopping center, and there’s a lot of potential in the technical area. ” Yang Xincheng said.

After giving Chen Xuan a few words of encouragement, he left Chen Xuan in the research department’s office and returned to the research department. He had a lot of things to do as a new official, and the fact that he could take the time to accompany Chen Xuan showed that he placed a lot of importance on him. After settling Chen Xuan down, he naturally had to return to work as soon as possible.

After Yang Xincheng left, Tao Ran didn’t give Chen Xuan any attitude. However, his attitude wasn’t exactly warm either.

After arranging a work desk for Chen Xuan, he had someone bring Chen Xuan to the logistics department to collect his computer and some office supplies.

Perhaps it was to make it easier for the programmers to work overtime, the development Department was equipped with laptops. Chen Xuan received a brand new ThinkPad.

As for the work desk, a newbie during the probationary period naturally wouldn’t get any good seats.

Chen Xuan’s work desk was near the door, and it was facing away from the office.

In this position, there was no possibility of slacking off. Otherwise, it would be difficult to detect when the leader was behind him.

Chen Xuan quickly tidied up his work desk, activated the system on his new computer, and installed the commonly used software. After everything was ready, he walked over to Tao Ran’s work desk and asked for a mission. Yang Xincheng didn’t know whether to laugh or cry,”Tao Ran, you didn’t think that I’d force an intern for you to take care of, did you?” What are you thinking?
