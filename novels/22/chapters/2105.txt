2106 The king of buildings (2)

For example, the TV wall in the living room had a simple color combination design. The sofa opposite the TV wall was wood – colored, and there were gray cushions on the sofa, which looked very soft and comfortable.

All the furniture was spotless. Xia ruofei knew that even though the owner only came over occasionally, he must have arranged for someone to clean it regularly. Otherwise, it would not be maintained so well.

Ling Qingxue brought the two of them around the house, and Xia ruofei was very satisfied.

The villa had three floors and a basement.

About a quarter of the basement was a garage, and the other three – quarters were storage rooms, entertainment rooms, laundry rooms, and so on. It was very functional.

Although it was a basement, it was not dark or stuffy at all.

Because the backyard was sunken, from the direction of the backyard, the villa was four stories high, and the basement was one story, so there was no problem with lighting and ventilation.

The first floor had a living room that was eight meters tall, as well as a kitchen, dining room, nanny’s room, and so on.

On the second floor, there was an extra – large master bedroom. In fact, it was a large suite. In addition to the bedroom, there was a large bathroom with a Jacuzzi, a spacious cloakroom, and a study that led to a small balcony.

In addition to the master bedroom, there were several guest rooms on the second floor, all of which had their own bathrooms.

Half of the third floor was designed as a large terrace, which could accommodate ten to twenty people for a barbecue or party. In the other half, besides the two guest rooms, there was also a clothes – drying room.

In addition, the sunken backyard was very spacious. An open – Air swimming pool was designed, and there was a large piece of grass, looking very lively.

What pleased Xia ruofei the most was that after pushing open the door to the backyard and walking up a few steps, there was a white beach. This beach was also included in the property rights of the villa.

Because Min River happened to make a turn at this position, the villa was in this protruding position, so this beach was completely independent and was equivalent to a private beach.

After looking around, Ling Qingxue smiled and asked,””RUO Fei, are you satisfied?”

“I’m satisfied! I’m super satisfied!” Xia ruofei said,”this is it! It just so happens to be close to your house!”

“I don’t think you’ll be dissatisfied!” Ling Qingxue chuckled.”Even I want uncle Jiang’s house!” I’ve said this to my dad before! He was a three – Mountain Man! The villa with the best location was actually snatched by uncle Jiang, who is from Heron Island!”

Ling Qingxue continued,”since you’re satisfied with it, I’ll ask my dad to tell uncle Jiang that we’ll do this!” Uncle Jiang will entrust a lawyer to handle this matter. He doesn’t have any loans for this house, and the property rights are clear. It will be transferred over very soon. Uncle Jiang said that he picked the best furniture and appliances in this house and gave them all to you!”

Compared to the house price of tens of millions, the furniture and appliances in the house were indeed not a lot of money.

However, Xia ruofei still smiled and said,””Alright! Then please thank uncle Jiang on my behalf! It just so happens that the decoration style is also to my liking, so I can just move in with my bag!”

Ling Qingxue nodded and said,”alright then, let’s go take a look at the other townhouse!” “Sister ran, that building over there is a rough one, so we can only look at the structure and location ...”

“Sure!” Feng Rao nodded with a smile. Let’s go and take a look first!”

The three of them left the villa and walked towards the townhouse area.

After walking for seven to eight minutes, the three of them arrived in front of the set of couplets.

Ling Qingxue pointed at the house and introduced it. “Sister ran, this type of house is quadruped. That is, a house with four villas side by side. Uncle Jiang’s house is at the end of the East side. It is also the best location among the four houses. Moreover, this row of villas is right behind the single house, and it’s the closest to the river. ”

The townhouses were built on a small hill, so although there was a row of individual villas in front, the view of the river was not affected. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

In fact, the developer had designed it well. At that time, they did not flatten the small hill. Instead, they designed the townhouses according to the actual terrain. This way, the townhouses here would also have a view of the river. Even the houses behind would not have a blocked view because of the high terrain.

Of course, there were also some that were located at a worse location. They were at the back of the hill, so the prices were different.

Further in was the high – rise building of the community, but the high – rise residential building was separated from the villa area. The two sides were not connected, and they needed to go through different doors to enter.

Such a design was to ensure the privacy and comfort of the residents in the villa area.

Because the house had not been renovated, no one would usually take care of it. The weeds in the courtyard were very tall, forming a sharp contrast with the house next door, which had been owned by the owner for many years.

However, repairing the turf and renovating the place was not a problem as long as the house was in good condition.

After taking a look around the house, Feng Jing was quite satisfied with it.

This terrace also had three floors, but each floor was smaller than the one that Xia ruofei had his eyes on.

At the same time, the villa also had a front yard and a backyard, and the top floor also had a balcony design. It could be said that there was heaven and earth.

The location of the villa had a clear view of Min River.

Another thing that pleased Feng Jing the most was that since the villa was built against the mountain, it was built by hitting concrete piles on the hillside. This would create an effect where there would be an elevated floor of different sizes under the house according to the terrain. The apartment they were looking at today had two floors, which was equivalent to having two extra floors. Moreover, the side facing Min River had no problem with the lighting.

After reading it, Feng Rao was actually a little tempted.

“Qingxue, how much is this villa for?” she asked.

Ling Qingxue gave Xia ruofei a strange look and asked,””Ruofei, didn’t you tell sister che?”

Xia ruofei laughed drily and said,”I might have forgotten ...”

Ling Qingxue rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei and said,”You can even forget the most important thing ... I’m impressed!”

“Sister ran, uncle Jiang didn’t intend to sell this house at first. He wanted to renovate it for a vacation, but he couldn’t stand my dad’s persuasion and finally agreed to sell the two villas together.” Ling Qingxue said,”that’s why it’s unlikely that there will be a big discount on the price. It’s basically the same as the current market price.”

“Then how much is it?” Feng Rao asked.

She was still quite confident. After all, she had just withdrawn 10 million Yuan as a bonus. Although this neighborhood was located in the city center and was adjacent to Min River, it was considered a quiet place in the midst of chaos. After all, the area of the house was not considered too big. She felt that ten million Yuan would be enough.

Ling Qingxue smiled and said,”the average price of a row here is about 68000 Yuan. The seats at the head of the row are even more expensive. It’s about 70000 Yuan per square meter.” The building area of this house is 185 square meters, so the total price is about 13 million Yuan!”

Feng Rao couldn’t help but take a deep breath. It was too expensive.

The average price of a house in San Shan city was about 30000 to 40000 Yuan, but this villa estate was worth 60000 to 70000 Yuan. It was almost double the price!

Moreover, she had been working abroad and at the Paradise Corporation all these years. Although she had a certain amount of savings, and Xia ruofei had even given her a bonus so that she could buy a house, the sum of her savings was barely enough to buy this house.

However, wasn’t he going to renovate it after buying it? Such a large townhouse would cost a lot of money to renovate.

If it was not renovated, there would be no point in buying it. After all, the purpose of buying a house was to move in as soon as possible. Otherwise, if it was an investment, it would be even more difficult to sell such high – end villa properties now that the real estate market in the country was relatively depressed. It was not the first choice for investment at all.

Hence, Feng Rao hesitated after hearing the price.

Seeing this, Xia ruofei quickly said,”I’ll take it, I’ll take it!” This is definitely the best terrace house in the neighborhood. Qingxue, tell uncle Ling to tell uncle Jiang that we want both of them and we’ll trade according to the price he set!”
