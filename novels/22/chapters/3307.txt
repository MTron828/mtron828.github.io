3308 Another strange path (1)

The encounter this time caught him off guard.

Xia ruofei and the Star Beast were stunned for a moment. Then, the Star Beast’s eyes revealed a trace of ferocity. It growled and pounced at Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei finally saw the middle – rank Star Beast and his spirits were lifted. He stepped on the bent Frost Flying sword and drew an arc nimbly. At the same time, he used his spiritual power to control the blue immortal sword to attack the middle – rank Star Beast.

To Xia ruofei’s surprise, the intermediate Star Beast didn’t Dodge and continued to charge at him.

The intermediate Star Beast and the blue immortal sword were both extremely fast, so in the blink of an eye, the blue immortal sword had already pierced the Star Beast’s body.

Although Xia ruofei only used his spiritual power to grab the blue immortal sword and throw it at the intermediate Star Beast, the speed was still very fast. The flying sword even made a sound of breaking through the air. In addition, the blue immortal sword itself was very sharp. When Xia ruofei saw that the Star Beast was so easily pierced, he could not help but be happy and a smile appeared on his face. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

However, his smile quickly froze.

When the blue immortal sword touched the body of the Star Beast, it did not Pierce into its body as Xia ruofei had expected. Instead, it made a sound of metal clashing. Xia ruofei even saw a few sparks. Then, the blue immortal sword shook violently and was bounced away.

The sharp blue travel immortal sword was thrown out by Xia ruofei at such a fast speed, but it did not even Pierce the scales of the middle – grade Star Beast.

The defense of this intermediate Star Beast was beyond Xia ruofei’s expectations.

In fact, when he killed the beginner – Level astral beast, Xia ruofei had already felt that its skin was rough and thick. He didn’t expect that an intermediate – Level astral beast would be even more abnormal. Its defense was several times stronger than that of a beginner – Level astral beast.

Xia ruofei didn’t have much time to think about it since the intermediate Star Beast was already in front of him.

Xia ruofei decisively jumped off the qushuang flying sword and rolled on the ground, avoiding the middle – grade Star beast’s aggressive attack.

In fact, the safest and most effective way to fly on a flying sword was to climb up quickly. However, Xia ruofei was still afraid of the sudden sense of danger when he went up to the top of the tree to investigate, so he would rather look more embarrassed and roll on the ground to avoid the attack of the intermediate astral beast than to climb up again.

Xia ruofei didn’t blindly defend. As he rolled and dodged, he had already made a Sword Art and controlled the flying sword to attack the intermediate Star Beast.

It was obviously not powerful enough to use spiritual power to grab the flying sword. Hence, Xia ruofei decided not to use the blue immortal sword anymore. Instead, he focused on controlling the qushuang flying sword to fight with the middle – rank Star Beast.

The flying sword controlled by the sword Art was naturally much faster than the blue immortal sword. The faster it was, the more powerful it was. Moreover, when controlled by the sword Art, the flying sword seemed to be a part of his body, which made it many times more flexible than the blue immortal sword.

The qushuang flying sword let out a soft cry, and streaked across the air like a Phantom, stabbing toward the intermediate Star Beast.

The intermediate astral beast seemed to have realized the danger. This time, it didn’t try to resist the attack with its body. Instead, it chose to Dodge.

In this way, the intermediate Star beast’s attack on Xia ruofei was interrupted, and Xia ruofei’s passive situation was alleviated.

After he rolled on the ground to avoid the intermediate astral beast’s attack, he immediately stood up, turned around, and ran toward the intermediate astral beast.

The flying sword of the bent frost was like a butterfly flying through the flowers, circling around the middle – grade Star Beast and launching fierce attacks from time to time.

Xia ruofei also used his palms and the qushuang flying sword to attack the intermediate Star Beast.

In a short while, the situation was completely reversed. The intermediate Star Beast had no chance to attack anymore. It was focused on defending against Xia ruofei’s attacks.

However, Xia ruofei soon frowned. Not only was this intermediate Star beast’s defense extremely strong, but it was also extremely fast and agile. Even though the gentleman sword technique he used was very exquisite, and he also took the risk to attack in close range, not many attacks actually landed on the Star Beast’s body. Moreover, they almost didn’t cause any damage, only leaving a few superficial wounds.

What happened next was beyond Xia ruofei’s expectations. The intermediate Star Beast did not fight to the death with him. Instead, it feinted and ran away.

Xia ruofei didn’t notice it, and the Star Beast was fast. By the time he reacted, it was too late to pursue.

Xia ruofei watched as the Star Beast quickly disappeared into the forest. He controlled the qushuang flying sword to chase after it for more than a hundred meters. Seeing that it was impossible, he simply gave up.

Xia ruofei punched the tree beside him dejectedly.

It was really an unfavorable start!

The mission required them to kill 100 middle – rank astral beasts, but the first one they encountered was already so difficult. They had been busy for half a day, but it had actually escaped!

Xia ruofei could not help but feel a headache. For a moment, he was actually at a loss.

He couldn’t think of how the record – breaking predecessor had done it.

According to his speculations, he was at the Golden core stage, so the mission requirement was to kill intermediate star beasts. If a nascent soul cultivator entered here, he would probably be asked to kill high level star beasts.

In other words, no matter if the record – breaking expert was at the Qi refining stage, the Golden core stage, or the original infant stage, the difficulty of his task would definitely not be lower than Xia ruofei ‘s.

Xia ruofei found it hard to imagine that under such difficulty, he could actually kill 100 star beasts of the same level as him in four hours.

However, Xia ruofei did not have the time to think too much about it. He knew that he could not stay here any longer.

He couldn’t guarantee that the escaping intermediate astral beast wouldn’t call for help. If the astral beasts decided to group up, even if it wasn’t a high – Level astral beast, he wouldn’t be able to stand a group of intermediate astral beasts!

After Xia ruofei had fought with this intermediate Star Beast, he had a rough idea in his heart. If he was surrounded by many intermediate star beasts, he would not be able to escape without using the spirit map scroll because they were too fast.

Hence, Xia ruofei immediately cast aside all distracting thoughts and left the place on his flying sword.

He didn’t have a specific target. He randomly chose a direction and flew on his flying sword while sticking close to the ground.

Of course, during the process of moving, Xia ruofei still maintained his spiritual power to the maximum range to explore the surrounding situation to avoid being surrounded by the star beasts.

This forest seemed to be very large. Xia ruofei flew on his flying sword for 20 to 30 miles, but he still did not encounter any star beasts.

Xia ruofei had just gone through a fierce battle. Then, he had to fly on his sword at full speed and nimbly avoid all kinds of obstacles in the forest. He had used up a lot of his energy.

He was already dozens of miles away from the place where the battle had taken place. He thought for a while and stopped to rest. At the same time, he had to think of a suitable way as soon as possible to realize that it would be difficult to complete the mission with just courage.

Hence, Xia ruofei jumped off the flying sword and searched the nearby area carefully. After making sure that it was safe for the time being, he walked to a big tree and sat down. He took out a bottle of spirit pool water from the spirit map space and drank it in big gulps.

After that, he sat under the tree to rest and recover while thinking of countermeasures.

Now, it seemed that this mid – grade astral beast had almost no weakness.

It was fast, had high defense, and its attack power was not weak.

If he wanted to kill the Star Beast, he had to make sure that it wouldn’t run away. Otherwise, if the Star Beast was determined to escape, he really wouldn’t be able to keep it.

Xia ruofei’s mind was spinning, and soon two words flashed in his mind.

If he wanted to kill the Star Beast quickly, it seemed that he would have to use the help of array Dao.

Xia ruofei had obtained many precious array books from the Jade talisman of inheritance. In addition, he often drew array talismans to set up various arrays. He had rich practical experience. It could be said that his array skills had reached a higher level.

Xia ruofei’s brain worked quickly and he quickly came up with a plan.

...

A set of trap and kill array blueprints had already been outlined in his mind.

This wasn’t a finished product. Xia ruofei had combined his knowledge of arrays with the large amount of array blueprints he had in his mind and the actual situation of the Star Beast to create a temporary array.

Xia ruofei simulated the formation in his mind twice and did not find any obvious problems. He immediately took out a jade talisman and began to draw the runes. He had stored quite a number of high – Quality blank Jade talismans in the spirit map space and they could be put to use this time.

This trap & kill array was not very complicated and Xia ruofei was very familiar with the process of carving talismans. Hence, in less than half an hour, he had finished carving all the talismans he needed. However, he made two mistakes in the middle and broke two blank Jade talismans. Other than that, everything went smoothly.

Although he had spent about half an hour, sharpening a knife would not delay the work of cutting wood. If he could increase the probability of killing the Star Beast, then this half an hour would be worth it.

However, Xia ruofei was still facing another problem. This trap and kill array could not be set up just by using a few Jade talismans with formation patterns. It also required specific supplementary materials to be set up in different positions.

In other words, he couldn’t immediately cast the array talisman to form the array in an instant when he encountered a middle – rank Star Beast. Instead, he had to set up the array in advance.

However, the forest seemed to be boundless and the probability of encountering a mid – grade astral beast was not high. Xia ruofei could not set up a formation in advance, or he would be waiting for the rabbit.

Xia ruofei frowned. Suddenly, his eyes lit up as he thought of the Star Beast that had just escaped.

If that astral beast was really going to get reinforcements and come back for revenge, wouldn’t there be a ready – made ambush spot? As long as the formation was set up in the vicinity, there was a chance to encounter a medium star Beast, and it was likely that there would be more than one star Beast.

Thinking of this, Xia ruofei seemed to see the hope of breaking the record and completing the task!
