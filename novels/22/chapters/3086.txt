3087 A strange request (1)

“Xuan ‘er, it’s been a few years since your cultivation broke through to the early Aurous core stage, right?” Chen Nanfeng did not answer Chen Xuan’s question directly. Instead, he asked with a smile.

“It’s been almost three and a half years,”Chen Xuan replied without hesitation.

Chen Nanfeng couldn’t help but sigh. According to the information from the black – robed man, a ‘ning, Xia ruofei had only revealed his true cultivation skills in about three years. In theory, Xia ruofei could have started from scratch and cultivated to the early – Stage golden elixir realm in such a short time. Of course, he also thought that the possibility of this was very low.

No matter what, Xia ruofei was only in his 20S. Chen Xuan was obviously much younger than him.

He had always thought that his son was very outstanding and was proud of him. Now that an even more monstrous Xia ruofei had suddenly appeared, he had to admit that he had suffered a blow.

Chen Nanfeng adjusted his emotions and said,””It’s been quite a long time ... Xuan ‘er, there are many difficulties in the path of cultivation, and it’s a taboo to cultivate behind closed doors. It’s time for you to go out and gain some experience. ”

Chen Xuan was slightly taken aback. It hadn’t been long since he had broken through to the Aurous core beginner stage. There were many veteran Aurous core cultivators in the cultivation world who were stuck in the Aurous core beginner stage for decades. Furthermore, Chen Xuan’s cultivation had been progressing steadily. Even though the rate of improvement wasn’t large, he had never felt any bottlenecks.

After all, he had only broken through three years ago and still had a long way to go before he reached the intermediate stage of the Aurous core stage.

Logically speaking, this was the time for him to lay a solid foundation, and he should be in closed – door cultivation more often.

However, Chen Nanfeng suddenly did the exact opposite, as if he wanted Chen Xuan to go out and train. This puzzled Chen Xuan.

However, Chen Xuan, who had been brought up strictly since young, did not question Chen Nanfeng’s decision. He only hesitated for a moment before nodding. “I’ll follow your arrangements, father. ”

Chen Nanfeng seemed to have noticed Chen Xuan’s confusion. He said,””Xuan ‘er, you should know that many senior cultivators will go to the mortal world when they encounter a bottleneck. On one hand, it’s to Polish their state of mind. On the other hand, it’s because the vast mortal world often contains the truth of the great Dao. It’s difficult to comprehend it unless you experience it yourself ...” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Father, could it be that you want your child to go to the secular world to gain experience?” Chen Xuan asked in surprise.

He originally thought that Chen Nanfeng wanted him to travel the cultivation world, explore ancient ruins, visit various major sects, and learn from each other. He didn’t expect Chen Nanfeng to actually want him to go to the secular world to train.

Chen Xuan was only in his forties, and he felt that it was still too early for him to experience the world.

Chen Nanfeng nodded slightly and said,”although you haven’t encountered a cultivation bottleneck for the time being, you were born and grew up in the heavenly sect. Up until now, you’ve spent most of your time cultivating in the sect. You indeed lack experience in the secular world. This time, I hope you can make up for this lesson.” There’s a very insightful saying in the secular world,”a clear understanding of the world is knowledge, and the practice of human relationships is literature.” I believe that after you have experienced the secular world, you will certainly have a lot of new insights in cultivation, which will be of great benefit to you when you break through to the middle jiedan stage in the future. ”

Although Chen Xuan didn’t agree with Chen Nanfeng’s point of view, he didn’t dare to disobey.

Furthermore, Chen Nanfeng was a veteran late – Stage golden core cultivator, so he had a lot of say in cultivation. Since he believed that going to the mortal world to train at this stage would be of great help to his cultivation, Chen Xuan did not dare to take it lightly.

“Yes! Father, then I’ll go to the secular world to gain some experience. ” Chen Xuan nodded his head slightly and said,”then, what do you think of the arrangements for this experiential learning? The first heaven society has many properties in the secular world. Why don’t you pick one for the child ...”

Chen Nanfeng waved his hand and said,”you don’t have to go to your family’s business. You’re going to the secular world to gain experience. You’re not going to be a young master! What kind of training could he get in the property of his own sect? Which one of those in charge doesn’t know you, the young sect leader? Even if they were to order you to change your identity to the most basic position, would they really dare to order you around like an ordinary employee?”

Chen Xuan couldn’t help but reveal an awkward expression as he chuckled,””Father, you’re so thoughtful. I won’t go to our family’s business ...”

“En!” Chen Nanfeng nodded and continued to ask,”I remember that you have also spent some time learning some knowledge about the secular world? What kind of knowledge have you learned all these years?”

“Father,” Chen Xuan replied after some thought,”I’ve learned a lot of things. I’ve dabbled in a lot of things. Business management, finance ...”

“Those are all too high – end!” Chen Nanfeng did not wait for Chen Xuan to finish. He waved his hand and said,”it’s best for you to start from the most basic position when you go to the secular world to gain experience. Have you learned any secular skills? If I can work in a technical department, that would be the best!”

“Skill?” Chen Xuan pondered for a moment before replying,”last year, I was bored for a period of time, so I learned some computer related stuff. It’s about programming with PHPs. This should be considered a skill!”

“I don’t understand either! “I guess so ...” Chen Nanfeng said.

Chen Nanfeng’s understanding of the secular world was even less than Chen Xuan ‘S. He had never even heard of any PhD.

In reality, Chen Xuan was a rather peculiar person. He had dabbled in a wide range of subjects. For a cultivator in the Golden core stage to actually study computer knowledge in the secular world, even if it was just a momentary interest, how could a cultivator, especially a cultivator in the Golden core stage, be comparable to an ordinary person in terms of brain development? Even if he was just learning, his skill level was already quite high.
