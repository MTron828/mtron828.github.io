2895 Quarrels between brothers (2)

Spending a mere 100 million dollars to smoothly inherit hundreds of billions of assets was simply a good deal.

Davis looked at Charlie with a smile on his face, but he didn’t say anything to disturb him, allowing his expression to fluctuate.

Charlie disappointedly discovered that even if he could see through all of Davis’s thoughts, he had no way to stop it from happening.

After a long while, Charlie opened his eyes and stared at Davis, asking, “How can I be sure that after you get my signature, you will still fulfill your promise and pay Anina and Lucca a hundred million dollars? And never hurt them? You could’ve gotten the money and then exterminated them at the root ...”

Davis revealed an exaggerated smile and shrugged. ” “My dear brother, why would I ruin my reputation for a mere 100 million dollars? The reason I’m doing this is so that things don’t get complicated, right? Besides, Anina and Lucca don’t know anything about what happened today. They’re not a threat to me, so why would I kill them? ”

Charlie couldn’t help but shut his mouth. He had to admit that there was some truth in what Davis said.

According to Charlie’s understanding of Davis, if he really succeeded this time, then in order to maintain his good image, not only would he not lay a hand on Anina and her son, but he would also appear to be full of love in front of outsiders and gain a good reputation for taking care of his deceased brother and widow.

If Charlie had really signed this will, he would definitely have died in the sea, and his property would definitely have been taken away by his younger brother Davis. However, for Anina and Lucca, it really was the best choice after much thought.

After all, regardless of whether he signed it or not, he would definitely lose his life and his assets. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

As if he could read minds, Davis timely said, ” “Charlie, you should really think about Anina and Lucca. At the very least, you wouldn’t want to see both of them quickly follow in your footsteps to see God, right? If you don’t sign this, even if I’m soft-hearted, I’ll have no choice but to make a move on my dear sister-in-law and nephew. If things really end up like this, it’ll be too sad!”

Charlie could not help but shiver when he heard that. He knew that there was no turning back after what Davis had done today. Davis’s ultimate goal was the hundred billion dollars in assets. If he did not sign, not only would he not be able to help Anina and Lucca obtain more assets, but he would also bring about a fatal disaster for them.

Although Charlie was not 100% sure if Davis would fulfill his promise and pay the 100 million dollars after he signed it, Charlie was 100% sure that if he did not sign it, his wife and children would soon die.

Choosing the lesser of two evils.

Moreover, if Davis could pay the 100 million dollars as promised and show some leniency to Anina and Lucca in the future for the sake of his reputation, then Anina and her son would be considered to have escaped a calamity.

Thinking of this, Charlie finally made up his mind helplessly. He let out a long sigh and said,””Bring it over! I’ll sign this!”

Davis couldn’t help but whistle in excitement, and then said,””I knew you would make the wisest choice, Charlie!”

After that, Davis took out the will and the signature pen, turned around, and handed it to a big man in a waiter’s uniform. He said,””Take it to my brother for him to sign ...”

Davis then turned to Charlie and said,”Today is really a memorable day, so ... Please sign the date on today, a year ago!”

Charlie nodded silently. He expressionlessly took the printed will and signature pen from the burly man who disguised himself as a waiter. He then looked up at Davis and said with a hint of ridicule,”Davis, you’re being a bit too cautious ...”

Davis knew that Charlie was saying that he didn’t dare to deliver the will personally, but had instead given it to the big man.

He shrugged and said,”I won’t forget, Charlie. You were once the champion of free combat at mit. Although you’re not young anymore, the dawn of victory is right in front of you. I won’t allow myself to take any risks.”

While reading the will carefully, Charlie said without raising his head,””You’re indeed cautious and patient enough. I’ve never noticed your wild ambitions ...”

Charlie still found it hard to accept this reality. In his eyes, Davis was just an ignorant and incompetent wastrel, just like countless rich kids in the United States he could live a carefree life with his family’s wealth. No matter how he squandered, he would never run out of money.

It had been a hundred years since the Koch family had made their fortune. During this time, the Koch group had snowballed and grown. It had become a giant consortium with businesses in many industries, including industry, energy, finance, and the Internet. Not only was the Coch family successful in their business, but they were also involved in United States politics. In the 1980s, the current head of the Coch family even ran for the position of President of the United States. Of course, his run ended in failure.

Since then, the cohe family had changed their strategy. They used the family’s wealth to continuously make arrangements, not hesitating to spend a lot of money to support the candidates. For decades, the cohe family had become one of the biggest investors in the U.S. Election. After the candidate was elected, they naturally had to return the favor and give the cohe family sufficient political resources. In addition, the cohe family had been working hard to cultivate underground forces for the past few decades. Among the underground forces in the United States and even the world, the cohe family had a pivotal position. It could be said that the cohe family had strong connections in both the American political and business world. They also had a great influence in the underground.

The wealth that such a family could earn was unimaginable.

It wasn’t an overstatement to say that, for example, when Davis signed a check on a whim and gave a sports car to a young model he met last night, the money the Coch family earned was far more than the value of a sports car in the short time he signed the check and flirted with the young model.

In such a family, how could he squander all the money?

In fact, Davis was like the vast majority of rich young masters, spending money like water. Every day, he would be filled with high-status friends, and he would frequently appear at all kinds of high-end parties. However, there was one thing about him. He had never shown the slightest bit of ambition. It was as if living a life of drunkenness and dreams was his life’s pursuit.

In this generation, the Coch family only had the two brothers Charlie and Davis. The rest of them were branch families who held very few shares and were mainly dependent on the main family to survive.

According to the rules of the Coch family, Charlie, who had become the head of the family, held the majority of the shares, while Davis only had less than 10% of the shares.

Of course, even if it was less than 10% , he wouldn’t be able to spend all the dividends every year. Not to mention that the value of these shares itself was already more than 20 billion US dollars.

It wasn’t that Charlie didn’t have any security measures, it was just that he didn’t specifically take precautions against Davis, because Davis didn’t reveal any ambition to seize the family property.

This time, Charlie was on his super-luxury yacht out to sea. The security measures were actually relatively tight, but it couldn’t stop Davis’s schemes.

Davis had obviously been planning this for a long time. The super-yacht, which was more than 160 meters in length, had first-class safety features. In addition to the bulletproof function of the master bedroom, there was also a high-speed escape boat and even a small submarine. In addition, in order to maintain the normal navigation of the yacht, the entire team, including the captain, sailors, chefs, waiters, bodyguards, and so on, had more than 80 people, but Davis had infiltrated many positions without anyone knowing. He had planted his trusted aide.

Charlie didn’t even know when Davis had sneaked into the yacht ...
