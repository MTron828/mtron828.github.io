With the sudden attack of the camel’s thorns, Xia ruofei became very careful. He did not fly according to the direction of the arrow. Instead, he tried to stay as far away from the camel’s thorns that were scattered everywhere in the wilderness as possible.

At the same time, Xia ruofei was on high alert to prevent any other dangerous situations from happening.

In fact, Xia ruofei could have avoided the attack of the camel’s thorn by increasing the altitude of his sword Kinesis flight. However, he still had a fresh memory of his experience on the second level of the Tower of Trials. There seemed to be a voice reminding him not to fly too high. Hence, he would rather take a detour than fly too high.

Especially now that he had Ling Qingxue by his side, he had to be even more careful.

The location of the marked light spot was not far. Even though Xia ruofei had taken a detour, it only took him about 20 minutes to reach the marked light spot.

When they arrived, Xia ruofei could not help but be a little dumbfounded. He and Ling Qingxue looked at each other in a daze. In front of them, there was a circular area completely surrounded by camel thorns. The marked light spot was in the center of the circular area.

In other words, if they wanted to reach the marked light spot, they had to pass through the blocking area formed by the camel’s thorns.

Xia ruofei had two choices. One was to fly over from a high altitude. The other was to fight him head – on.

For the same reason, Xia ruofei quickly passed on the first option. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

After all, these camel’s thorns were plants. Even if they could suddenly burst out with dense thorns, their attack range was limited, and they could not move flexibly. Relatively speaking, as long as one was on guard, they were not a big threat.

Xia ruofei was now sure that this was the fifth level of the trial Pagoda.

He could even guess why the Almighty who set up the mission had arranged the trial space on the fifth level to be exactly the same as the fourth level.

If he didn’t guess wrong, this should be a deliberate setting.

Cultivators who could pass the tests of the first three levels and obtain such great benefits after reaching the fourth level of the trial Pagoda would definitely be in a very good mood, and might even be somewhat complacent.

After arriving at the trial Pagoda’s 5th level, seeing the familiar environment, some people couldn’t help but relax.

It seemed that this setting was a test for the cultivators.

Since they were on the fifth level of the Tower of Trials, these camel’s thorns were part of the test. No matter what, they could not avoid it. Hence, Xia ruofei felt that it might not be a bad thing to come into contact with these camel’s thorns earlier and understand their characteristics and habits.

“Ruofei, what should we do?” Ling Qingxue asked.

Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”Qingxue, how do you think we should pass?” The reward for the trial mission on the next level is very likely to be inside. ”

Ling Qingxue thought for a moment and said,”I think this ring is quite big. Why don’t we go around it and see if there are any gaps?”

After Ling Qingxue said that, she immediately rejected her own suggestion. She shook her head.”Forget it! The attack range of this camel’s thorn is quite large. Even if there’s a small gap, I’m afraid we can’t pass through it quietly ...”

Xia ruofei looked at Ling Qingxue with a smile and pretended to be listening attentively.

Ling Qingxue would have to face her cultivation problems alone sooner or later, so Xia ruofei could not take charge of everything. Otherwise, he would only be harming her.

Right now, Xia ruofei was also trying to train Ling Qingxue.

Ling Qingxue furrowed her brows and said,”actually, it’s not a bad idea to fly through the sky. After all, you can ride a flying sword!” But I see that when you fly with me, you try to stay as close to the ground as possible. Is there any danger in the sky? In addition, we don’t know the attack range of the camel’s thorns above us, so it’s hard to grasp the height. Then ...”

Ling Qingxue paused for a moment and looked at Xia ruofei before she continued,””If all these plans don’t work, then it seems like ... I can only attack!”

Xia ruofei chuckled and nodded.””Great minds think alike! Since these camel’s thorns are blocking our way, we’ll just get rid of them!”

Ling Qingxue was a little embarrassed as she said,””I’m just blindly analyzing. If I were to deal with these camel’s thorns, I wouldn’t have any good ideas!”

Ling Qingxue’s face showed a trace of fear, perhaps because she had just recalled the scene of being attacked by the camel’s thorn.

Xia ruofei chuckled,”if you were the one challenging the trial Pagoda’s fifth level, I’m afraid the difficulty wouldn’t be so high.” The current difficulty level is completely tailored to my cultivation level. Speaking of which, I’m the one who implicated you!”

Xia ruofei then said to Ling Qingxue,””Qingxue, stay where you are and don’t move. I’ll go and check out the situation!”

The two of them were still a few dozen meters away from the ring formed by the camel’s thorns. There were no other camel’s thorns around them, so they were relatively safe.

Ling Qingxue nodded and said,”ruofei, you must be careful!” If it really doesn’t work, then we won’t ask for any reward!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”why not?” Besides ... If we can’t even break through this level, I’m afraid we won’t even be able to get the mission on the fifth level. That’s equivalent to being trapped here forever! Don’t worry! I will put safety first!”
