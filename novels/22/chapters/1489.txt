Chapter 1490: The ancient tomb of Mount Yu (2)

Translator: 549690339

Song Wei did not expect Xia ruofei to be able to spot someone from so far away.

At this moment, Xia ruofei said softly,”I’m ... Sorry!” I didn’t do it on purpose, it was all an accident ...”

“Don’t say anymore!” Song Wei said in a low voice with a red face.

Xia ruofei laughed awkwardly and obediently shut his mouth.

Song Wei was also embarrassed. She looked straight ahead and did not dare to look at Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei was not in the mood for romance. He quickly took out a small notebook and made some markings on it.

Song Wei was a little curious. She suppressed her shyness and turned to look. She saw Xia ruofei scribbling some strange symbols on the book without any pattern.

“What are you drawing?” Song Wei could not help but ask.

Xia ruofei observed and recorded as he said,””This is the password marking method commonly used in our Army. Only we can understand the contents of the records. This way, even if we are captured during the process of the mission or the book is lost, it will not be leaked.”

“Then what are you recording now?” Song Wei nodded and asked.

“The terrain here, the number of guards, the distribution, the patrol routes ...” Xia ruofei said,”you stay here and don’t move. I’ll go over there and take a look ...”

“Ah?” Song Wei said,”where are you going?!”

“The investigation is not comprehensive enough. I have to change my position to observe!” Xia ruofei said,”don’t worry. It’s safe here. I’ll be back soon!” Just don’t move and don’t make any noise!”

Song Wei opened her mouth but did not say anything. She watched as Xia ruofei nimbly ran into the grass like a civet cat and quickly disappeared.

In this deserted mountain, and there was a huge tomb under her feet, it was natural for a girl like Song Wei to feel scared.

Moreover, this place was especially quiet. Occasionally, there would be the cawing of a Crow or two, which sent a chill into his heart.

Even though the sun was shining brightly, Song Wei could not help but pull up her collar and squat in the grass, not daring to move.

Fortunately, Xia ruofei did not leave for too long and returned after about ten minutes.

“Let’s go back!” Xia ruofei said.

“Have you investigated everything?” Song Wei asked.

“En!” Xia ruofei nodded.”Have a good night’s sleep at the hotel today. We’ll come over tonight!”

“Alright,” he said. Song Wei said softly.

Xia ruofei looked at Song Wei’s pale face and couldn’t help but say,”How about ... You rest in the hotel tonight, and I’ll be alone ...” He said.

“Don’t even think about it!” Song Wei refused.

“Alright ...” Xia ruofei smiled helplessly. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The two of them carefully backed away until they were twenty to thirty meters away and could confirm that the patrolling guards could no longer see them. Then, they straightened their bodies and went back the way they came.

The two of them returned to the temple of King Yu without a hitch. No one noticed that they had sneakily turned to the other side of Yu mountain from a small path.

Xia ruofei and Song Wei went back to the hotel after they got their car.

The two of them did not discuss much along the way. After they returned to the room, Song Wei could not help but ask,””How’s the situation? Are the guards strict?”

“It’s better than I thought,”Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Then, Xia ruofei took out the map that Song Wei had drawn and corrected the places that she had remembered wrongly. Then, he started to mark on the map with a pen while explaining to Song Wei.

“First of all, from the way they walk and the arrangement of their inspection routes, they should not be professional soldiers. It is certain that the Armed Police Force guarding the tomb should have been withdrawn. These people may be security guards hired by the local government.” Xia ruofei said,”there are a total of six guards. We can’t rule out the possibility that there are more people in the temporary modular building. They are in groups of two and their main patrol area is this area ...”

Xia ruofei drew a circle on the map and said,””The main point should be the entrance to the tomb that has been filled with soil and the area around it.”

“In other words, if we want to enter the tomb, we have to find another entrance and avoid this area?” Song Wei asked.

“That’s for sure!” Xia ruofei said,”we don’t know how often they patrol at night, but the original intersection is too close to the mobile houses they live in. We can’t dig an entrance without them noticing.”

“Do you have any plans?” Song Wei asked.

Xia ruofei said,”I believe in your judgment. This tomb is very large. At night, we will first confirm the Guard’s night patrol pattern. Then, we will try our best to find a place far away from their area of activity where we can enter the tomb and dig in directly!”

Song Wei hesitated and said,”isn’t this a lot of work?” With our bare hands, we ...”

“I’m the only one!” Xia ruofei said,”with a man like me here, how can I let you do such a rough job like digging a hole?”

“I didn’t expect you to be so chauvinistic!” Song Wei pursed her lips and smiled. I’m an archeologist, and in the field of archeology, it’s always the woman who’s used as a man ...”

“Use men as livestock?” Xia ruofei added.

“Correct!” Song Wei chuckled.”Besides, I’m a professional at digging graves. Have you heard of a Luo Yang shovel?”

“Of course, I’ve long heard of your name!” Xia ruofei said,”but it’s not easy to buy this. I didn’t prepare it this time ...”

Song Wei took out a long bag from her backpack and said,””Open it and take a look!”

Xia ruofei opened it and laughed.”I didn’t expect you to have prepared this in advance?”

It was an exquisite Luo Yang shovel. The head of the shovel was a traditional semi – cylindrical shape, and it was exquisitely made. The handle was also made of sections of metal with a screw thread on it. It could be disassembled for ease of carrying, and it could be attached when it was used.

“Not only is this a grave robbing tool, but it’s also an archeological weapon!” Song Wei smiled and said,”it’s very convenient to use it to identify soil quality. This is a necessary skill for archeologists!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said,”we can save a lot of time with this!”

Experienced grave robbers could accurately explore the deep underground tomb with a Luoyang shovel, and archaeologists often used Luoyang shovels to distinguish the soil quality. It was naturally more efficient to use Luoyang shovels to explore tombs than flat shovels.

Of course, Xia ruofei did not search aimlessly. He still had the help of the sensing Jade Leaf. At least, he would not be too far away from the tomb without knowing.

Xia ruofei and Song Wei stayed in the hotel for the whole day. Other than going downstairs during mealtimes, they stayed in their rooms the rest of the time. They even took a few hours of sleep after lunch to ensure that they had enough energy for the night.

After dinner, the sky gradually darkened.

Xia ruofei and Song Wei packed their things, carried their heavy mountaineering bags, checked out, and left the hotel.

The two of them drove to the foot of Yu mountain.

This time, Xia ruofei did not park the car in the parking lot at the foot of the mountain. Instead, he hid it in a small forest. Then, the two of them got out of the car and walked up the mountain through a path that the local villagers had used to farm.

Xia ruofei had already surveyed the mountain during the day. There were several surveillance cameras along the normal mountain path, so he chose another path. Of course, the general direction was the same. This path did not need to go around King Yu’s temple and could directly lead to the small path beside the temple.

At night, Mount Yu was very quiet, with only the sound of insects.

Under the moonlight, the two of them sped along the road. Xia ruofei would pull Song Wei along from time to time. This road was much more difficult than the one they had climbed during the day.

After trekking for about 40 minutes, the two of them once again arrived at the location they had stopped to observe during the day.

Xia ruofei gently pushed aside the grass and looked over. He realized that the guards at night had not loosened up much.

There was also a small Searchlight installed on the roof of the mobile houses where the security guards lived. It turned from time to time, illuminating the surrounding area of dozens of meters as if it were daytime.

There were still three groups of security guards patrolling along the fixed route.

Xia ruofei quickly noted down the situation and looked up to determine the direction. He whispered to Song Wei,””This way!”

He brought Song Wei and ducked into the bushes.

There was no road here at all, and the two of them walked for more than two hundred meters, one step high and one step low.

The light from the searchlights could no longer reach them, but they felt that the sky in that direction seemed to be particularly bright.

Xia ruofei felt the heat of the Jade Leaf carefully as he led Song Wei to change their direction and continued walking.

Finally, Xia ruofei stopped when they reached a depression.
