Chapter 3661: Gathering at the first heaven society (1)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei didn’t know that Mu Sheng and mu Jianfei were still chasing after him.

Of course, in reality, the distance between Mu Sheng and Xia ruofei was constantly widening.

As compared to Mu Sheng, who was sweating profusely and gritting his teeth while flying on his sword, Xia ruofei seemed very relaxed. He only needed to use a trace of his spiritual power to control the flying boat’s formation. He almost did not consume any energy.

This highlighted the value of flying Dharma Treasures.

In the ancient cultivation world, there were many practical magical treasures like flying boats, but unfortunately, many inheritances were cut off.

Xia ruofei steered the black Phoenix flying ship and entered the Mount Tai mountains in no time.

He had been to the first heaven society once, so he still remembered the route.

Under the airboat, the steep mountain road was crowded with tourists. Nobody noticed that a huge airboat was passing by above their heads at a high speed.

Soon, Xia ruofei entered the depths of the mountain range. He had landed an airboat in the valley near the first heaven society. No sect allowed people to ride a flying sword or use an airboat. It was not only a matter of safety but also a form of contempt for the sect’s dignity.

This Valley was actually the outer area of the first heaven society. It was equivalent to their reception point. Xia ruofei had passed through this Valley the last time he entered and left the first heaven society.

The black – armored flying ship hovered just one or two meters above the ground. Xia ruofei leaped down, shrunk the Flying Ship, and kept it in the spirit map space.

A young man in a green Taoist robe walked out of the forest and stood in front of Xia ruofei.

The young Taoist bowed to Xia ruofei and asked,””May 1 ask if you are senior Xia ruofei?”

“I’m Xia ruofei.” Xia ruofei smiled and asked curiously,”how did you recognize me?”

Although Xia ruofei had been to the first heaven society before, there were at least a thousand disciples in the first heaven society. He had not seen many of them, and most of them were the higher – ups of the first heaven society. It was almost impossible for a low – Level disciple to have seen him.

The young disciple of the first heaven society said respectfully,””The young sect master has instructed that senior Xia will be visiting the sect today. The young sect leader said that senior Xia is very young and that he is driving a completely black flying boat magic treasure. Thus, this disciple boldly surmised that you should be senior Xia.”

“The black Phoenix flying ship has become my symbol…” Xia ruofei chuckled.

The disciples who were arranged to receive guests here might not be of a high rank, but they must be very clever. It was not surprising that they could guess Xia ruofei’s identity.

The welcoming disciple said respectfully,”senior Xia, please rest here for a while. 1 will report to the young sect leader. The young sect leader has specifically instructed that he will personally welcome senior Xia!”

“Brother Chen, you’re too polite. Actually, you can just send someone to bring me in.” Xia ruofei smiled.

“I dare not disobey the young sect master’s orders. Please understand my difficulties, senior …” The welcoming disciple said, then made an inviting gesture and said,”senior Xia, the young sect master has specially instructed me to prepare some good tea. Please take a rest here.”

“Alright then!” Xia ruofei nodded.

Xia ruofei followed the welcoming disciple to a Pavilion not far away. The place was decorated in an ancient style. There was a tea table in the middle of the pavilion and a beautiful female disciple was sitting in the pavilion. Her slender Jade – like hands were fiddling with the tea set and her movements were very familiar.

“Hello, senior!” When the female disciple saw the welcoming disciple leading someone in, she quickly stood up and bowed slightly.

“This is senior Xia ruofei. He’s the young sect leader’s guest. You must treat him well!” The welcoming disciple said.

“Yes! Senior brother song!” The female disciple quickly said.

The welcoming disciple then said to Xia ruofei respectfully,””Senior Xia, please wait for a moment. The young sect leader will be here soon.”

“Alright, 1’11 have to trouble you then. You can go and do your work!” Xia ruofei said gently.

The welcoming disciple bowed to Xia ruofei and left.

“Senior, please have a seat!” The female disciple said somewhat cautiously.

Xia ruofei nodded with a smile and sat down beside the tea table.

The female disciple poured another cup of tea and presented it to Xia ruofei with both hands. She said respectfully,””Senior, please have some tea!” “Alright, thank you!” Xia ruofei accepted the tea with a smile.

He lifted the teacup to his mouth, took a sip of tea, and praised with a smile,””Good tea! The mouth was full of saliva, and the lips and teeth were fragrant! The tea is good, but the tea – making skills are even better!”

The female disciple blushed and said,””Senior, you’re too kind. I don’t deserve it.”

Although Xia ruofei did not have any other intentions towards this female disciple, it felt good to have a female cultivator with an otherworldly temperament serving tea at the side. It would not be too boring waiting.

When Xia ruofei was drinking his third cup of tea, he heard footsteps behind him.

Xia ruofei thought that Chen Xuan had already arrived. He thought to himself,”he’s too fast. Even if he received the news and flew over on his sword, he wouldn’t be this fast!” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

He remembered that there was still a distance between this Valley and the first heaven society.

Xia ruofei stood up to greet Chen Xuan, but before he could turn around, a hearty laugh came from behind.””Hahaha! Little brother Xia, you’re here too? They just arrived, right?”

This was not Chen Xuan’s voice, but Mu Sheng’s..
