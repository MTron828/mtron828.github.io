In PP Sports Livestream.

When Barcelona besieged the Spanish goal, Shen fangjian and Jia Tianning, the two commentators, became very nervous. It was true that in the final period of the game, any change on the field could completely change the outcome of the game. At that time, Spain was on the verge of collapse, as if they would be knocked down by the giant, Barcelona, at any time.

When Barcelona’s attack failed and the old goalkeeper of the Espanyol, Diego Lopez, launched a counterattack, both Shen fangjian and Jia Tianning were in high spirits.

Xia ruofei’s actions of stopping the ball, pulling the ball, turning around, passing the ball, and passing the ball were even more amazing.

When Xia ruofei used an action similar to a Marseille turn to get past lakitic and used the outer instep to send out a precise pass with a huge arc, Shen fangjian subconsciously praised,””Xia ruofei’s performance was very exciting. When the whole Espanyol team was nervous to the extreme, he didn’t seem to be affected at all. He really has a big heart!”

Then, Shen fangjian gave a comment on Xia ruofei’s performance that made it to the hot search.

He said,”beautiful!” An accurate pass! It was simply unbelievable! Xia ruofei used his left foot to draw a dragon on the court and then used his right foot to draw a rainbow!”

Many PP sports fans couldn’t help but burst out laughing when they heard this.

During this period of time, wild wolf DISCO was very popular on the internet. As long as you were a frequent internet user, almost all of you were caught off guard by the ‘left! Draw a rainbow with me, and draw a dragon on your right ‘.

Shen fangjian’s comment even made people want to hum it.

Most importantly, his comments were quite appropriate.

Xia ruofei’s actions of dodging lakitik, whether it was pulling the ball or turning around, were very wide. However, there was a special kind of beauty and rhythm, as if he was painting on the court. The ball that was passed to Wu Lei immediately after drew an exaggerated arc. It was not an exaggeration to say that it was a rainbow.

After Wu Lei caught the ball, he rushed forward along the right side. Shen fangjian and Jia Tianning’s voices also couldn’t help but rise.

“This is an opportunity to counterattack!” The two of them shouted in unison.

Strictly speaking, it was a broadcast accident when the commentators interrupted. However, sports commentators had a certain uniqueness, especially in a passionate sport like football. Many times, the commentators could not help but shout.

Shen fangjian and Jia Tianning exchanged a look, and they immediately came to a silent consensus. The main commentator, Shen fangjian, continued,””Wu Lei’s dribbling speed is very fast! Bar?a’s defense was not fully in place for this goal! However, the RCD Espanyol’s attacking players did not follow up quickly. We only saw Xia ruofei cutting forward at high speed in the middle! Wu Lei has already carried the ball for at least 30 meters and has attracted at least two defenders from bar?a. Now the middle is a little empty, he should pass the ball!”

“Wu Lei has indeed made the right choice!” Shen fangjian shouted,”the pass was a little too far ... But Xia ruofei’s speed increased again and he snatched the ball! When they were competing for speed just now, he had used the action of overtaking at a corner to leave robito behind by at least two body lengths! “Xia ruofei dribbles the ball along the front of the penalty area and cuts inside. He’s being defended by lakitic. Bar?a’s rear defense has been completely displaced ... Pique is also quickly approaching to assist in the defense ...”

Shen fangjian spoke very fast, which imperceptibly infected the tense atmosphere. Jia Tianning couldn’t even interrupt at this time. He also stared nervously at the big screen, his eyes not blinking.

“Xia ruofei has a change in rhythm! He’s got an opening and he’s going to shoot!” Shen fangjian shouted,”this ball has ... Ah! Barcelona’s goalkeeper, telstergen’s magical play, held up this sure – shot that was hanging in the dead corner. This ball ... Ah! “Ah!” Xia ruofei had already charged into the penalty area. The ball was a little high! He directly hooked the ball and shot! The ball is in!”

Shen fangjian couldn’t help but stand up from the broadcasting station. He clenched his fists and raised his arms, shouting,””There’s nothing to be picky about this goal! In the last few seconds of the game, Xia ruofei used a difficult Barb to kill Barcelona in a very spectacular way! Yes! I can already announce that Espanyol has won the eye – catching Catalan derby! And the protagonists and heroes of this victory are our Chinese players!”

Shen fangjian said so much that he was almost out of breath. Jia Tianning finally interjected,””This reverse hook goal will definitely be selected for the best goal of the year! There would not even be a problem in competing for the puskash prize. Whether it was the importance of the game, the viewing of the goal, or the key role of the goal, there was no doubt about it! If a goal like that doesn’t win the prize, what kind of goal can win the prize?”

“Actually, I don’t really care about the Puskas prize!” Shen fangjian laughed and said,”what I’m most happy about is that today’s victory was completely led by the Chinese players. The first goal was initiated and assisted by Xia ruofei. It was scored by another Chinese player, Wu Lei. It was also this lightning fast goal that set the tone for today’s game in just 20 seconds. The second goal was a perfect individual performance. Xia ruofei used a Super One – shot to announce his dominance in the game. And the third goal was still thanks to Xia ruofei’s precise moon – shaped scimitar pass. Our national player, Wu Lei, completed the assist and iglassias successfully ate the pie!”
