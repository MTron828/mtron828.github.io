Chapter 1627: What qualifications do you have?

The heated atmosphere suddenly stagnated, and the auctioneer finally found a chance to interrupt. He enthusiastically shouted,””Tang real estate offers 300 million! The price of this land has already broken through the 300 million mark!”

Song Rui couldn’t help but feel disgusted. Wasn’t it just 300 million? It’s as if the bid was a shocking price, and the price wasn’t even at its peak, okay?

In fact, he was just unhappy that Liu haofan was in the limelight.

Young master Song was unhappy. He pulled Xu Zixuan, who was beside him, and exchanged seats with him. He sat next to Xia ruofei.

Then, song Rui nudged Xia ruofei with his arm and said,””Let’s not just sit here and watch! Kill off his limelight!”

Everyone had already discussed it before they came in. Xia ruofei would be in charge of raising the sign for today’s auction. This was also suggested by Zhao Yongjun. Firstly, Xia ruofei was the major shareholder. Secondly, they were worried that song Rui would state an outrageous price in a moment of passion. It was better for Xia ruofei to hold the sign more steadily.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”what’s the hurry?” It was still too early to reach that price! So many real estate companies have their eyes on this piece of meat, they won’t surrender so quickly!”

In fact, even if Xia ruofei and his team did not compete with Liu haofan today, he would not have been able to get the land so easily. Nowadays, there were fewer and fewer pieces of land in the capital. The natural and cultural environment of Xiaotang town was good. There were also natural hot spring resources. The land here was of high quality.

One could tell from the companies that came to participate in today’s auction. Only those who passed the preliminaries and had 125 million as a deposit could participate in today’s auction. However, there were at least 20 to 30 companies in this conference hall, many of which were real estate companies with good strength.

As expected, after Zhou Tianyu bid, he only maintained a short silence. The moment Xia ruofei finished speaking, someone immediately bid.

” 305 million!”

Perhaps they were stimulated by Tang real estate’s one – time increase of 30 million, but this time, they didn’t increase the price by one million, but directly increased it by five million.

Liu haofan’s mouth twitched and he took the sign from Zhou Tianyu’s hand. After he raised it, he said calmly,”” 310 million!”

“Fuck!” Song Rui couldn’t help but shout,”are you going to bid or not? If you’re not, then give me your tag!”

Zhao Yongjun glanced at song Rui and said,””Xiao Rui, don’t be impatient!”

Zhao Yongjun still had a lot of prestige. Song Rui only muttered a few words and then stopped.

Liu haofan’s side displayed a strong determination, and some small companies that didn’t have much hope in the first place gradually withdrew from the competition.

However, this price was far from the peak. In fact, in terms of the surrounding land price, this price was still very cheap. Zhao Yongjun and the others had also analyzed it before. If it could be sold for 320 million, it was a relatively good price.

Therefore, some of the more capable companies naturally did not give up. Immediately, another company increased the price by 3 million, reaching 313 million.

Liu haofan looked at the companies that were still eager to make a move and simply raised his sign again, shouting,””We’ll bid 330 million!”

This time, most companies were completely out of business. It was not that they could not afford the price, but the price premium was already quite high. Now that the real estate policy had begun to tighten, it was impossible to buy land and build it for a few years before developing it again like in the past. If the price increased any further, the cost of buying land would be too high.

The auctioneer was still enthusiastically encouraging everyone’s emotions on the stage. However, Liu haofan’s bid made most people back out. For a while, no one made another bid.

Song Rui said anxiously,”ruofei, it’s our turn!” Otherwise, that guy would have taken this land ...”

Xia ruofei took the card and said,””Stay calm! It’s not like the hammer will fall immediately ...”

Then, Xia ruofei raised his board and said indifferently,”” 340 million ... Forget it, 4 doesn’t sound good. How about 350 million?”

As soon as Xia ruofei’s bid came out, the crowd was in an uproar. Everyone was in a heated discussion and looked at Xia ruofei curiously.

There were signs on the table in front of them, but the name Hengrui company was too unfamiliar. They had never heard of it before.

“Who’s that fierce person?”

“I’ve never heard of this company!”

“He must have an extraordinary background. Can’t you see that his seat is so central?”

” 350 million ... That’s crazy ... Is this land worth that much?”

......

Song Rui suddenly felt elated and couldn’t help but glance at Liu haofan.

Liu haofan obviously did not expect Xia ruofei’s bidding strategy to be so aggressive. He knew that song Rui and the others would definitely raise the price, but he did not expect Xia ruofei to increase the price by 20 million in one go. Hence, Liu haofan was stunned for a moment.

Seeing that Liu haofan, who had been in the limelight just now, was now dumbfounded, song Rui suddenly felt more refreshed than drinking ice water on a hot summer day. He couldn’t help but laugh.

Liu haofan heard song Rui’s mocking laughter and came back to his senses. He frowned and glanced at Xia ruofei. He was a little confused about Xia ruofei’s approach. He was even more confused about why Zhao Yongjun and song Rui did not bid and Xia ruofei was the one leading the bidding.

However, song Rui’s sarcasm made Liu haofan not think so much. He had always been proud and arrogant, so how could he accept such a cowardly attitude?

Therefore, after Liu haofan came back to his senses, he raised his sign without thinking. However, when he was bidding, he hesitated for a moment. He was not sure how much he should bid because from Xia ruofei’s bid, his strategy was very aggressive. If he bid too low, he would not be able to suppress it. But if he bid too high, he would be at a disadvantage and spend a lot more money if the other party did not want it.

Liu haofan’s hesitation caused the auctioneer to misunderstand.

Raising the sign and not bidding was the default minimum bid, so the auctioneer immediately said,””The Tang Corporation bids 351 million!”

Liu haofan glared at the auctioneer and said loudly,””Who told you I’d add a million? I haven’t even announced my price yet, what are you blindly bidding for? You don’t know the rules!”

“I’m sorry ...”The auctioneer said awkwardly,” I saw that you didn’t bid, so I thought ...”

Just now, the bids were all in the millions or tens of millions. Now, they were adding one million. Even Liu haofan felt embarrassed.

So, he didn’t wait for the auctioneer to finish and rudely interrupted him, saying,””Don’t think too much, it’s quite clear! I’ll bid 360 million!”

“Okay, okay ...” The auctioneer smiled wryly, thinking that these rich young men were really hard to please. However, he didn’t dare to delay and quickly said,”Tang real estate bids 360 million!”

After he finished speaking, he turned his attention to Xia ruofei’s side. The price had already exceeded the actual value of the land. The other companies had basically withdrawn from the competition. Whether this land could be sold at a new high would depend on whether Xia ruofei and the others were willing to increase the price.

Xia ruofei didn’t let him down. He picked up the sign without much consideration and said,”” 7 is not very auspicious, so ... Hengrui Corporation offers 380 million!”

“You ...” Liu haofan was fuming with anger.

Another one – time bid of 20 million! When he compared himself to the hesitation and lack of confidence when he made the bid, it was as if he was just trying to set off Xia ruofei and the others. How could Liu haofan not be angry?

“Who are you?” Liu haofan glanced at Xia ruofei and asked,”can you afford to bid so recklessly?”

Xia ruofei looked at Liu haofan as if he was an idiot and said,””Since I dared to bid this price, I naturally have the money to pay. Otherwise ... I’m not going to waste my 100 million in cash.”

If the bid was called and the deal was not carried out, the bid deposit could not be refunded, and the bid would be won at the second highest price, so it was meaningless to bid randomly.

Liu haofan had asked a very stupid question.

He had questioned Xia ruofei on a whim and regretted it immediately after he said it. Now, he felt as if there was a dagger on his back and everyone was looking at him with ridicule.

Liu haofan was a little angry from embarrassment. He turned to Zhao Yongjun and said,””Brother Zhao, who the hell is this guy? So arrogant! Do you even know the rules?”

Liu haofan thought that Xia ruofei was a professional manager hired by Zhao Yongjun and the others. He didn’t expect that the tactful and kind Zhao Yongjun’s face would sink.

Zhao Yongjun said coldly,”haofan, watch your attitude!” You don’t have the right to teach my friend a lesson!”

Liu haofan was stunned. He looked at Xia ruofei deeply, then said to Zhao Yongjun,””Brother Zhao, your friend looks unfamiliar! Could it be that he has some great background?”

“You don’t have to worry about that.” Zhao Yongjun said coldly,”as your big brother, I’d like to give you a piece of advice. Don’t think that you’re the only one who’s number one in the capital. Don’t forget that there’s always someone better ...” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

No matter how impressive Liu haofan was, he was just a third generation nouveau riche. Old Liu’s family was indeed prominent, but that was old Liu’s family, not Liu haofan. On the other hand, Xia ruofei was able to drink and chat with elder song. He was a member of the younger generation who was deeply appreciated by elder song. In terms of ability, he was even better than Liu haofan. What right did Liu er have to look down on Xia ruofei?

Liu haofan’s heart trembled. His mind was spinning quickly, trying to recall who Xia ruofei was.

At this moment, Xia ruofei chuckled and said,””Brother Zhao, don’t talk so much nonsense with him. Since no one wants to raise the price, let’s get ready to pay for the land!”

Then, Xia ruofei looked at the auctioneer on the stage and asked,””It seems like no one else is bidding. Can we drop the hammer now? Everyone’s time is precious, so let’s not waste it ...”

As soon as Xia ruofei finished speaking, Liu haofan stood up as if his tail had been stepped on. He said loudly,””Who said no one is bidding!”
