3009 Fulfilling the promise (1)

Although Luo Qingfeng had already tried the firecloud pill and was quite confident, to be able to get Xia ruofei’s personal confirmation was naturally a different matter.

Luo Qingfeng was overjoyed and quickly said,””It’s all because master taught me well! This old servant is still not skilled enough, I need to work harder!”

Naturally, Xia ruofei did not pretend to be polite to Luo Qingfeng. He said directly,””I’m indeed not skilled enough, and I’m still very inexperienced in many areas of processing. I was able to successfully refine the fire cloud pill this time, more or less, with a bit of luck!”

Of course, Xia ruofei would not just criticize. He immediately added,””There’s an obvious problem with the way you handled the red sun grass. The rhizome wasn’t clean enough, which led to the medicinal properties not being pure enough. In addition, it seems that the time left after processing was a little longer. Also, the control of the fire ...”

Xia ruofei casually pointed out some of the classic problems that Luo Qingfeng had faced in the process of refining the furnace of firecloud pills.

Luo Qingfeng’s forehead was covered in sweat after hearing this. Xia ruofei had only checked the completed firecloud pill and could point out so many problems. What was even more terrifying was that when he carefully recalled the entire process of refining the firecloud pill, he realized that the problems that Xia ruofei had pointed out were all very accurate. There was not a single mistake! And they often hit the nail on the head.

Luo Qingfeng quickly took Xia ruofei’s words to heart.

If he could avoid these problems the next time he refined them, there was no doubt that his level of refining the firecloud pills would improve. The effect of the improvement in the quality of the refined firecloud pills was estimated to be immediate.

“Thank you, master!” Luo Qingfeng said gratefully,”thank you for your careful guidance!” This old servant will definitely work harder and strive to master the method of refining this fire cloud pill as soon as possible!”

Luo Qingfeng could not wait to prepare the herbs again and make another batch. He was sure that this time would definitely be much better than the previous one!

Xia ruofei could not help but laugh when he saw Luo Qingfeng’s eagerness. He said,””Qingfeng, you can’t become a fatty in one go. You have to practice your alchemy techniques. Don’t forget that there are still guests in the sect today! Let’s go receive sect leader Mu Sheng and the others first!”

“Yes, yes, yes!” Luo Qingfeng quickly said,”thank you for the reminder, master!”

Xia ruofei and Luo Qingfeng went to the second floor together. Mu Sheng and the other two were already up. In fact, they had not slept much. The spiritual Qi in the star Seizer sect was not bad. They had been meditating on their beds the whole night.

When Xia ruofei entered the room, Mu Sheng was talking to mu Hua and mu Jianfei by the window.

“Little brother Xia is here!” When Mu Sheng saw Xia ruofei, he called out enthusiastically,”Zhai Xing Lou is in a great location!” The viewing effect was excellent! Looking at the valley from here, buildings of various sizes could be vaguely seen in the clouds and mist. It was really like a paradise on earth! Our surging waves sect’s environment is far inferior to the star Seizer sect ‘s!”

“Sect leader mu, You must be joking!” Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”the Canglang sect is a top – notch sect. The star Seizer sect can’t even catch up to it!”

Mu Sheng said meaningfully,”a top sect only represents their current strength, but the foundation of a sect is not just based on their current strength.” I can tell that the star Seizer sect has a very deep foundation ...”

Xia ruofei was well aware of Mu Sheng’s guess. He knew that Chen Xuan, Liu Mansha, and the others were more or less guessing that there was a nascent soul realm master behind Xia ruofei. This nascent soul realm master was most likely the hidden ancestor of the star Seizer sect, and Xia ruofei was most likely the disciple of this nascent soul realm master.

Xia ruofei had intentionally or unintentionally led them to this misunderstanding.

Because of this mysterious Halo, any normal power that wanted to covet the star Seizer sect would have to think twice.

As for the top sects like the surging waves sect and the first heaven sect, they would most likely adopt a strategy of befriending.

This was naturally the most beneficial for Xia ruofei.

So, after hearing Mu Sheng’s words, Xia ruofei just smiled and said,””Sect leader mu, you flatter me.”

At this moment, Luo Qingfeng said,”sect master mu, why don’t we go downstairs and have breakfast together?” Let’s talk while we eat. ”

In fact, cultivators didn’t need to eat every day. However, there were still so – called “dinner parties” in the cultivation world. The Chinese’s tradition of talking about business at the dinner table seemed to have a long history.

“Then I’ll have to trouble sect leader Luo!” Mu Sheng happily replied.

Luo Qingfeng personally led the way and brought the group to the first floor of zhaixing tower. There was an elegant little restaurant there, but it was not used very often.

When Luo Qingfeng was in the sect, if he needed to eat, he would eat on the tenth floor.

This place would only be used when receiving guests, and ordinary guests were not qualified to stay in zhaixing tower, so it was only used a few times a year.

Of course, the environment of the small dining hall was still very good, and there were service disciples cleaning and maintaining it every day.

Soon, breakfast was served. Xia ruofei did not see any celestial food that he had imagined. It was just plain porridge and steamed buns. It seemed that the cultivation environment was getting worse and worse, and the Ling qi was almost exhausted. It was not even enough to provide for cultivators to cultivate, so where would there be extra ling qi to plant Ling grains and other crops?

Everyone ate breakfast while chatting about the interesting things of the cultivation world. The atmosphere was very relaxed.

Xia ruofei’s understanding of the cultivation world was limited, so he mainly listened.

After breakfast, Xia ruofei took out the porcelain bottle from the spirit map space and handed it to Mu Sheng with a smile.

He said,”sect leader mu, I’m glad I didn’t fail you.” Here are five firecloud pills, take a look. ”

Mu Sheng was stunned for a moment and quickly took it.

However, he didn’t check it immediately. Instead, he was touched and said,””I didn’t think that little brother Xia would spend the entire night refining firecloud pills. This mu is truly ashamed! Actually, we’ve come to the star Seizer sect with the intention of taking a look around and exchanging views. We’re not here to rush little brother Xia ...”

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”sect leader mu, you’re being too serious. In fact, you’re only suggesting to travel with us to protect senior brother Luo and me.” Fellow Daoist Chen Xuan was only willing to send me on my way after sect leader mu suggested that we travel together. Although I’m slow – witted, I still know what’s good for me. ”

Xia ruofei paused and continued,””As for refining the firecloud pill overnight, it was just an itch for me to do it. I felt that my condition was not bad, so I simply refined it first.”

Actually, Jianfei’s injury can’t be cured in a day or two, and with the five firecloud pills you provided, there’s no rush for this batch.” Mu Sheng sighed,”little brother Xia is really a kind man!”

After that, Mu Sheng opened the porcelain bottle, poured out a fire cloud pill from it and observed it. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Soon, he revealed a look of joy and said,””The quality of these firecloud pills is even better than the batch at the auction! Little brother Xia, you’re so capable!”

Mu Sheng gave Xia ruofei a thumbs – up.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you flatter me!” This time, his mentality was more peaceful and his performance was more stable!”

Naturally, Xia ruofei would not reveal that the firecloud pill he had brought out at the auction was his first time making it. Moreover, he was indeed a little anxious to prepare the fire cloud pill a day in advance. Although there was a difference in the flow of time in the spirit map space, and he had plenty of time, the sense of urgency was inevitable. And this time, his mood was basically as calm as an ancient well. With the experience from the last time, the effect was naturally better.

“Then this mu will accept it!” Mu Sheng put the fire cloud pill into a porcelain bottle and then put the porcelain bottle into his storage ring.”Thank you, little brother Xia!”

“Many thanks, brother Xia!” Mu Jianfei also said with a grateful expression.

“You’re too polite!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Mu Sheng said,”little brother Xia, sect leader Luo, since we’ve got the fire cloud pill, we’ll take our leave first!” There are still many things to deal with in the sect. ”

“What’s the hurry?” Luo Qingfeng asked quickly.”Why?” Since he was already at the star Seizer sect, he might as well stay for a few more days! Otherwise, if fellow cultivators were to find out about this, they’d definitely say that our star Seizer sect doesn’t know how to treat our guests!”

Xia ruofei also said,”yeah!” Sect leader mu, if you leave now, it would seem like I’m chasing you away ... If I don’t refine the firecloud pill so quickly, I’m sure you’ll have to stay for a few more days. ”

Mu Sheng laughed and said,”little brother Xia, you’re joking.” In fact, regardless of whether we obtain the firecloud pills today, the three of us will still be returning to the vast waves sect. The purpose of this trip is to escort the two of you back to the sect. As for the firecloud pills, I believe that little brother Xia will deliver them to the vast waves sect as soon as he’s done refining them. It’s just that this mu didn’t expect that little brother Xia would actually be able to refine the firecloud pill so quickly. That’s the best of both worlds, but without this excuse, I wonder when I’ll be able to invite little brother Xia, this esteemed guest, to our vast waves sect as a guest. ”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”sect leader mu, I’m not an honored guest. At most, I’m an evil guest. I’m going to the Cang lang sect. Not only do I want to eat and drink your food, but I might even take some with me when I leave!”

Mu Sheng couldn’t help but laugh and said,””You’re welcome! Don’t worry, little brother Xia, I still have some assets, and the surging waves sect won’t be poor!”

...

“If brother Xia comes to visit, I’ll definitely welcome you!” Mu Jianfei also smiled and said,”I will use our surging waves sect’s specialty, Cloud Mist wine, to entertain brother Xia!”

“Then it’s a deal!” Xia ruofei said happily,”I won’t leave until I’m drunk!”

“We won’t leave until we’re drunk!” Mu Jianfei said.

Mu Sheng said,”little brother Xia, it’s a deal. Don’t break your promise!”

“After I’m done with my Affairs, I’ll definitely find time to visit sect leader mu!” Xia ruofei said.

“Alright!” Mu Sheng said happily,”then the three of us will take our leave!”

Xia ruofei and Luo Qingfeng sent Mu Sheng and the other two off at the mountain Gate. They watched as they left the star Seizer sect on their flying swords before turning around and walking back.

Xia ruofei said directly to Luo Qingfeng,””Qingfeng, prepare a quiet room for me. I want to go into seclusion immediately! You will personally protect him, and unrelated people are not allowed to approach!”
