Chapter 180: Turbulence in the clear sky (2)

“Xia ruofei, how are you?” Lu You asked with concern. Then, she went forward to help him up. Xia ruofei quickly called out,””Don ‘t, don’ t, don’t ... Don’t touch me first ... I might hurt my lumbar spine ...” Lu You was so frightened that she retracted her hand and asked,””Then ... What should we do? I ...” Xia ruofei tried to move on his own and suddenly felt a sharp pain from the back of his waist. It was so painful that he gasped. It was possible that his bones were really injured. Lu You was at a loss. At this moment, she suddenly saw that the back of the seat Xia ruofei was leaning against was stained with blood. She was so frightened that she cried out,””Xia ruofei, you ... Your head is bleeding too ...” “I’m fine. Don’t be afraid ...” Xia ruofei forced a smile and said to Lu You. Lu You was already crying. She said,””I ... I’ll get someone to help ...” “Don’t ...” Xia ruofei said.”You ... Help me slowly. I want to get up first ...” “Your waist ...” Lu You hesitated and said. If his lumbar spine was injured, he definitely couldn’t move it at will, or it could easily cause more serious damage. “Don’t worry, slow down ...” Xia ruofei said. “Oh ...” Lu You walked over. Xia ruofei also reached out and slowly supported himself on the seat. Lu You hugged Xia ruofei’s upper body from behind and slowly helped him up. Xia ruofei’s entire weight fell on Lu You. Xia ruofei could feel the soft elasticity. Although his waist was in excruciating pain, he could not help but feel his heart flutter. However, Lu You was completely unaware. All her attention was on Xia ruofei as she carefully supported him. Xia ruofei slowly exerted his strength and moved bit by bit. Finally, with Lu You’s help, he sat on the chair. “I’ll go get the flight attendant!” Lu You said. After saying that, Lu You immediately got up and walked to the flight attendant’s lunchbox. As she walked, she shouted,””Flight attendant, someone’s injured!” Xia ruofei took the opportunity when Lu You left to take out the flat wine bottle from his pocket. He opened the lid and took a few big gulps of the flower petal solution. Then, Xia ruofei quickly closed the bottle cap and stuffed the small jug into his pocket. Very quickly, an air stewardess followed Lu You over. The air stewardess’s face was also bruised. It was obvious that she had also been injured during the fall. “Teacher, how are you?” The air stewardess asked. “He injured the back of his head and his waist,” Lu You replied.”His head is still bleeding, and his waist injury seems to be very serious. Quickly get a doctor to take a look ...” The air stewardess said,”we’ve already made the announcement twice. There are no professional doctors among the passengers on this flight, but we’ve all learned first aid knowledge. Let me deal with this gentleman first!” The captain has already contacted the ground. There will be doctors and an ambulance as soon as we land!” “Then hurry up ... The back of his head is bleeding ...” Lu You said anxiously. “Alright!” The air stewardess walked over and said,”Sir, let me check your wound ...” Xia ruofei squeezed out a smile and said,””Thank you for your hard work. I think I got injured when I hit the ceiling just now. It’s at the back of my head. Just get me some hemostatic and bandage it.” With that, Xia ruofei lifted his head slightly. Lu You hurriedly squeezed in front of Xia ruofei and held his shoulders. This way, Xia ruofei’s face was buried in Lu You’s collarbone. He instantly felt a delicate fragrance assail his nose. After taking the petal solution, the pain started to ease. The components of the strange flower petals entered his body and quickly began to repair Xia ruofei’s injured parts. Hence, Xia ruofei began to have the leisure to let his thoughts run wild. Being held in the arms of a young and beautiful woman, his nose filled with the delicate fragrance of her body, and his shoulders touching her body from time to time, any normal man would be tempted at this moment. The air stewardess quickly found the wound. After applying the hemostatic, she wrapped a white bandage around Xia ruofei. At first glance, Xia ruofei looked like a brave and wounded soldier in a revolutionary movie. Fortunately, the air stewardess came in time. If she had waited a little longer, the small wound would have healed by itself. The effect of the petals of the red mist Flower was indeed so heaven – defying. After treating the wound on her head, the flight attendant said with some difficulty,””Sir, we don’t dare to treat your back injury easily, and we don’t have the medical facilities to do so. You’ll have to bear with it for a while. When the plane lands, there will be a specialized surgeon coming on the plane to treat you.” “How can you guys be like this!” Lu You was anxious when she heard this.”Are you just going to leave him behind like this?” You’re too irresponsible!” “We ... We really don’t have the ability to handle it ...” The stewardess quickly explained. Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,””Lu You, forget it ... Let’s understand each other! After all, the conditions on the plane are limited, and you see, this stewardess is also injured. Just now, they were working while standing, so I’m afraid her injuries are not lighter than ours!” The air stewardess almost burst into tears when she heard that. Almost all of them were injured. One of them had a fracture and another had a cervical spine injury. They were all very serious. However, the lightly injured passengers were busy dealing with the aftermath, and many of the passengers with minor injuries were very agitated. They were very harsh to them, and they criticized and even cursed them for no reason. Even though this was their job, they naturally felt very aggrieved. Xia ruofei’s words seemed to have hit the nail on the head. She sobbed and said,””Thank you for your understanding.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”hurry up and do your other things!” “Mm! Thank you! Thank you!” The air stewardess said. She bowed to Xia ruofei seriously and then turned to leave. Xia ruofei smiled at Lu You and said,””Actually, communication between people can be very simple. Put yourself in my shoes and understand each other, right?” If it was in the past, Lu You would definitely refute Xia ruofei subconsciously. However, this time, she only nodded silently. Lu You also sat down beside Xia ruofei. She looked at Xia ruofei with a complicated expression and asked,””You were in the Army before, and your physical fitness is so good. If you didn’t protect me, you wouldn’t have suffered such serious injuries, right? Why did you save me when your attitude towards me is so bad?” The second chapter is a 3600 – Word chapter.
