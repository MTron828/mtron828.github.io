Chapter 1554: Helping boss Yu cheat people (2)

Translator: 549690339

He said,”Mr. Xia is indeed a Lucky Star!” The quality of the Jade meat in this position is better. If there are no accidents, it should reach the glass type!”

The Jade merchants couldn’t help but surround him.

The window was right there, and most of them were in this line of work, so it could be seen at a glance.

This time, everyone was even more envious of Yu mingdong.

Not only did he buy the rare top – grade Violet Jade, but the price of his own raw stone, which he had spent a lot of money on, also seemed to have increased greatly.

Two windows were opened one after the other, and they both saw green.

In this case, it was very likely that the Jade contained inside was connected into pieces, and the quantity was very large. In addition, the quality of the Jade so far was very good. In this case, more than 20 million Yuan was too cheap!

Although they knew that Yu mingdong was in the same industry, the Jade merchants couldn’t help but offer a price to buy this piece of material.

“Old Yu, you’ve gained enough today, so give this piece of material to me! I won’t let you suffer any losses. How about 30 million?”

“President Yu, I’ll bid 32 million!”

” 34 million!”

Yu mingdong waved his hand proudly and said,””Everyone, I’m still waiting for the rice to be cooked in my own factory! I’m not selling this material!”

Xia ruofei opened his mouth, but he saw that Yu mingdong had already asked the stonecutter to continue polishing the stone, so he closed his mouth again.

The stone – cutting master was still wiping the cut of the Jade that had just been cut a little. After all, there might be a lot of Jade under this thin stone Skin, so the experienced stone – cutting master didn’t need Yu mingdong’s instructions and chose this cautious method.

Everyone even held their breath and stared at the piece of material without blinking.

With the operation of the stone cutter, the stone Skin at the cut was ground off bit by bit, and more and more Jade meat was revealed.

If it was just a small opening to see the green, then the green jadeite had gradually formed a whole.

This made the Jade merchants even more anxious, because looking at the situation, they were really aiming for a large piece of complete Jade.

The stone – cracking master turned off the power of the grinding machine. With this kind of continuous grinding, the grinding wheels would wear out very quickly. He needed to change the grinding wheels.

At this time, the Jade merchants also took the opportunity to take a closer look, and their mouths kept making envious and jealous tsk tsk.

Xia ruofei had already walked to Yu mingdong’s side, intentionally or otherwise. Now that he saw that the Jade merchants ‘attention was on that piece of material, he immediately nudged Yu mingdong gently.

Yu mingdong turned around with a face full of joy. Before he could speak, Xia ruofei lowered his voice and said,””President Yu, if the price is right ... Why don’t you just sell this piece of material?”

Yu mingdong was stunned for a moment, then he hurriedly asked in a low voice,””Mr. Xia, is there something wrong with this material?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”how do you expect me to answer your question?” I don’t even know anything about stone gambling!”

Only then did Yu mingdong come back to his senses. He had almost forgotten that Xia ruofei was a newbie when he saw a high – Quality Jade on the back of the window. He had blurted out his request for help just now.

Yu mingdong was about to tell Xia ruofei that he didn’t want to sell any raw materials when Xia ruofei added,””Mr. Yu, although I’m an outsider, I don’t have a good feeling about this material. It’s purely my intuition! Without any evidence ...”

Xia ruofei’s words made Yu Ming Dong shiver because he felt that Xia ruofei’s luck today was amazing. With his experience, his intuition would often be very accurate in such situations.

This was the first time that Yu mingdong had wavered. He originally wanted to cut it into bright materials and then transport it back to his own factory to use.

Xia ruofei’s words made Yu mingdong lose his resolve.

Of course, there was another more important reason, and that was that Yu mingdong’s company’s working capital was not much. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

He had spent 50 million on the materials from Xia ruofei and another 30 to 40 million on his own. That was almost all of the working capital of his company.

In this case, once the price of Jade fell or sales went bad, the company was likely to have cash flow problems.

And if he exchanged this half – Bright material for money, then the funding problem would be greatly alleviated.

In addition, he had cut out good quality Jade from his previous raw materials and bought two pieces of jade from Xia ruofei. It could be said that his factory was not short of raw materials for the time being. This raw material could be sold.

Once he had this thought, Yu mingdong felt that he should trust Xia ruofei’s intuition more and more.

Finally, when the stonecutter changed the grinding wheel and was ready to continue grinding, Yu mingdong waved his hand to stop him.

Then, Yu mingdong muttered to himself for a moment and said in a clear voice,””Everyone, I’ve thought about it just now. I still have sufficient raw materials in my factory for the time being, so it’s not like I can’t sell this piece of material ...”

As soon as Yu mingdong said this, the Jade stone merchants ‘thoughts became alive again.

“Old Yu, you should have done this long ago!”

“Yup! If you’re eating meat, shouldn’t you at least let us get some soup to drink?”

“That’s right! It’s useless for you to hoard so many jades, and you’ve also bet a large sum of money!”

Yu mingdong smiled and continued,””But ... Since it’s already at this level, then the price ...”
