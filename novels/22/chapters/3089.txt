When Chen Xuan found out that he had already entered the interview round, he did not appear particularly excited. He did not know that it was not easy to find a job these days. For someone with a resume like his to be able to enter the interview round, it was like a pie falling from the sky.

He politely made an appointment with HR and hung up the phone.

Then, he took out a spiritual crystal, sat cross – legged on the bed, and began to cultivate.

What Chen Xuan couldn’t get used to the most was naturally the environment of the secular world.

The three mountains was already known as a Garden City. As the provincial capital, its forest coverage rate was ranked among the top in the country, but this still could not improve the cultivation environment. The spiritual Qi here was barren, heterogeneous, and violent, and only four hours a day could be used for cultivation.

The first heaven society had a sect – protecting formation to gather and purify the spiritual Qi, so they could cultivate at any time.

Furthermore, as the young sect leader, Chen Xuan’s residence had a much better cultivation environment than the residences of ordinary disciples.

Chen Xuan felt that if he were to spend too much time in the secular world, his cultivation might really regress.

If one wanted to cultivate in the time outside of midnight and dawn, one could only rely on external objects.

Although crystals were the most suitable for golden core cultivators, even the wealthy first heaven society couldn’t provide Chen Xuan with an endless supply of crystals. Therefore, when he went out, he would use spirit crystals more often.

This was already the extravagance of the young master of the number one sect in the cultivation world. How could ordinary cultivators be willing to use spiritual crystals to cultivate?

The next day, Chen Xuan arrived at the Paradise building as promised. The interview went very smoothly.

The head of the development Department was the main character in this interview. He asked Chen Xuan a few questions about PhD, and Chen Xuan answered them all with ease. Following that, he gave Chen Xuan a real – life example.

Even though it was only a small case, the head of the research department had never expected Chen Xuan to be able to complete it on the spot. In fact, he had even offered to provide Chen Xuan with a work desk so that he could complete it within three days.

In fact, this was equivalent to a trial.

To his surprise, Chen Xuan took out his laptop in the small meeting room where the interview was held. After switching it on, his fingers flew like the wind. In less than half an hour, he had already completed the code.

The head of the development Department was dumbfounded.

This was the first time he had seen someone writing code without thinking or stopping to think. It was a waste to use this hand speed to write code. He could totally consider developing in the direction of a professional e – Sports player!

The head of the research department didn’t even have time to take a good look at the code before he gave Chen Xuan a high score in his heart.

When he started to check the code, he was once again convinced.

The style of the code in the resume was exactly the same. The code was simple, logical, and full of a different kind of beauty.

If they didn’t hire such an expert, who else would they hire?

As for education, what was that? Master’s and Ph.D.’S in software, how many could be better than this guy in coding? Or was there such a person?

The head of the development Department decided to hire Chen Xuan on the spot. Furthermore, the trial period was only a month.

Next, he had to talk to HR, which was a necessary procedure.

However, due to the importance placed by the head of the R & D department, the HR department had also arranged for a manager to meet Chen Xuan.

The main issue was the salary. The HR manager asked Chen Xuanli how much she wanted to pay.

“I don’t have an ideal salary. I’ll take whatever the company offers!” Chen Xuan replied without even thinking.

The HR manager was stunned, but she quickly put on a professional smile and said,””I can set an 8K for you. Of course, this is your salary during the probationary period. You can still increase it after you become a regular employee. In addition, whether it’s the technical or administrative staff of the company, they all get a basic salary according to their rank. Every year, there are two opportunities for promotion and salary increase. If you pass the assessment, you can realize a salary increase!” The interview went very smoothly.
