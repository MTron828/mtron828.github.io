2225 Departure (1)

The meeting ended in a very pleasant atmosphere. Xia ruofei and Gao Jun agreed to go to the capital in a week. At that time, Gao Jun would also go to the capital to personally supervise the recording of the first episode.

After the meeting, Gao Jun stood up and said with a smile,””President Xia, we’ve prepared some wine tonight. I hope that you and President Feng can give me a chance to express my gratitude!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”director Gao, you’re a guest since you’ve come to the three mountains. How can I let you be the host?” We should be the hosts! I’ve already booked the place for tonight, how about it? Director Gao, do me a favor?”

Gao Jun was stunned for a moment before he smiled and said,””You’re too kind, President Xia! Then ... I’ll do as you say!”

“Director Gao is very straightforward!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

There was still some time before dinner, so Xia ruofei invited Gao Jun to his office. The two of them made tea and chatted.

As for Gao Jun’s accompanying staff, Feng Jing and the others naturally took care of them. It just so happened that there were some specific matters that needed further confirmation from both sides. After all, the leader was only holding the general direction.

That little Liu from earlier had even gone directly to Tao Yuan farm to discuss with Cao tieshu about the matter of transplanting the vegetables.

Gao Jun chatted with Xia ruofei for a while and felt closer to him. Xia ruofei never put on airs. If others gave him enough respect, he would naturally give them enough respect. Gao Jun didn’t feel the arrogance of a rich Playboy from Xia ruofei. On the contrary, he felt like a spring breeze.

When it was about 5:30 pm, the two of them left the office together. They called Feng Jing, Dong Yun, Xiao Qiang, and Gao Jun’s entourage to head to Ling Ji’s private kitchen.

Xia ruofei and Feng Jing already had a high level of tacit understanding. Just now in the reception room, she already understood Xia ruofei’s gaze. So when Xia ruofei returned to the office with Gao Jun, Feng Jing called the Ling Ji private kitchen as soon as possible.

When the private restaurant heard that Xia ruofei was going to entertain the guests, they did not say anything. The backyard was not open to the public, so Xia ruofei could use it anytime he wanted.

When Xia ruofei and the others arrived at Ling Ji private kitchen, the private room was already prepared. It was a quiet courtyard and the private room had an antique feel to it. One look and one could tell that it was of high quality.

Xia ruofei had prepared Ling Ji’s signature dishes, Buddha Jumps Over the Wall, long river Chinese perch, exquisite Drunken Eight Immortals wine, and space – aged Semillon for the guests who had come from afar. Gao Jun could be considered experienced and knowledgeable, but he was still convinced by the delicious food tonight. Especially when he found out that many of the ingredients tonight were produced by the Paradise Corporation, he could not help but give a thumbs – up.

The banquet was naturally filled with both guests and hosts.

After they finished eating, a Buick GL8 commercial car was in charge of sending Gao Jun and the others back to the hotel. Xia ruofei personally sent them to the entrance of the private restaurant.

Gao Jun shook hands with Xia ruofei and said,””President Xia, thank you for your hospitality!”

“Director Gao, you’re too kind!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

The electric car door opened slowly. Before Gao Jun got into the car, he turned around and said,””By the way, director Xia, I would like to use some photos or videos for our meeting today to hype up life you yearn for. Is that okay?”

Gao Jun had brought two accompanying reporters with him this time. They had taken a lot of videos and photos of the whole meeting and uploaded them to the TV station. There was no shortage of talents in this area.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”isn’t this a spoiler?” Speaking of which, you guys should be trying to be as mysterious as possible before the show starts broadcasting!”

Gao Jun laughed and said,”there’s no absolute!” From the perspective of the law of communication, at least it’s better for the news of President Xia joining our show to be released earlier! Of course, if you mind, you can forget about it ...”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”why would I mind?” As long as you think it’s suitable, feel free to use it!”

Gao Jun was very happy,”that’s great!” Thank you, President Xia!”

“You’re welcome! You’re too polite!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“President Xia, I’ll take my leave then!” Gao Jun said,”let’s meet in Beijing!”

“Mm! See you in the capital!” Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.

Gao Jun got into the Buick minivan. Xia ruofei stood at the side and waved at Gao Jun and the others in the car, watching the car leave Ling Ji’s private kitchen.

Since the guests had left, Feng Jing and the others naturally arranged for the remaining MPV to send Xia ruofei home first. Yingying had just arrived with Xia ruofei’s company car, so the Knight XV off – Road vehicle was left in the underground parking lot of the peach blossom mansion.

Xia ruofei did not stand on ceremony. However, he asked everyone to get into the car together and asked the chauffeur to send them back separately.

Along the way, Feng Jing and Dong Yun were extremely excited. Although the show had not started recording yet, they could already foresee that Xia ruofei would definitely gain a huge number of fans when the show aired. The reputation of paradise Corporation would also reach a new high.

Xiangnan TV would be hyping up The Show Before the Show even aired. By then, the netizens would know that the only flying guest in the first episode was Xia ruofei.

Initially, Xia ruofei wanted to take Feng Jing and Dong Yun home first as Ladies First. However, they had rejected him firmly. Moreover, the jiangbin villa district was the closest to Ling Ji private kitchen, so he decided to take Xia ruofei home first.

The car drove all the way to the entrance of the villa. Xia ruofei reminded the driver to be careful. Then, he waved goodbye to Feng Jing and the others and walked briskly into the courtyard.

……

In the next few days, Xia ruofei’s life became very regular.

As he had to go to the capital in a few days, Xia ruofei felt embarrassed to be a boss who did nothing. Even if he could not guarantee that he would get to work on time, he could at least go to the company every day.

With Qin Yanan and the team she led, Xia ruofei didn’t have to worry about work. Qin Yanan was able to arrange his schedule well. Of course, he didn’t have much to do. He left all the work that needed to be done on behalf of the company to Feng Jing. He enjoyed the feeling of being in charge behind the scenes.

In the past few days, Ling Qingxue and Song Wei did not avoid Xia ruofei. They either did not come at all or came together.

Moreover, every time they cultivated together, the two of them would just avoid each other a little to avoid being embarrassed in front of each other. In terms of the number of times they cultivated, they strictly followed the principle of equality. One for you and one for me. Neither of them was at an advantage.

Xia ruofei smiled wryly in his heart when he saw the situation. They were not giving him any chance at all ...

Of course, Xia ruofei was not in a hurry. In fact, when he was performing the soul – body Fusion cultivation, the pleasure from the soul level far exceeded the physical contact. Ling Qingxue and Song Wei had already completed their spirit body Fusion many times, so they were well aware of this. They just couldn’t bring themselves to do it.

This rather strange and subtle state continued for a few days, and in the blink of an eye, it was time to set off for the capital.

Originally, Song Wei was going back to school as well. Xia ruofei wanted to bring her along to the capital city as it would be more convenient with his private jet.

However, perhaps Song Wei wanted to avoid suspicion and Ling Qingxue’s overthinking, so she took a plane back to Beijing a day in advance. After Song Wei returned to the capital, Ling Qingxue “consciously” did not come looking for Xia ruofei again. Xia ruofei did not know whether to laugh or cry.

Early in the morning, after Xia ruofei had breakfast alone in the villa, the car sent by the company arrived at the entrance of the villa very quickly.

Xia ruofei sent a WeChat message to Ling Qingxue, then left the house with his small suitcase.

Qin Yanan quickly came up to him. The veteran who was the driver immediately took Xia ruofei’s suitcase and put it in the trunk of the car.

This time, Xia ruofei brought Qin Yanan and another girl in her team who was in charge of external communications with the capital.

The car set off quickly.

The girl named he Yu sat in the front passenger seat, while Qin Yanan and Xia ruofei sat side by side in the middle row.

Qin Yanan and he Yu both knew that they were taking the Gulfstream business plane this time. They were both a little excited, but they did not show it in front of Xia ruofei.

After more than half an hour of driving, the car arrived at the Changping International Airport. There was a slightly lower building next to the terminal, which was commonly known as the “private plane building.” If one took a private plane, they would enter the tarmac through the security passage of this building.

This Gulfstream G650 had always been paired with two pilots. The two pilots, Liu An and Zheng Daming, were both experienced pilots. They had received the flight mission a few days ago and had already applied for the route and the parking space at the Beijing airport. This was because Xia ruofei had said that they might be staying in Beijing for a few days.

After going through a simple security check, Xia ruofei and the other two saw the captain of the flight, Liu An, waiting at the security checkpoint with the crew.

“President Xia! Good Morning!” Liu An greeted Xia ruofei with a smile.

Xia ruofei smiled gently and said,””Captain Liu, I’ll have to trouble you again this time!”

“You’re welcome. This is our job!” Liu An replied,”President Xia, this way please!”

A flight attendant had already taken Xia ruofei’s small suitcase. The group walked through a long corridor and entered the tarmac through a small door.

The Gulfstream G650 was quietly parked on the tarmac.

Although they were already mentally prepared, Qin Yanan and he Yu were still amazed when they saw the luxurious private jet named “paradise.” Especially when they saw the distinctive vegetable and fruit coating on the body of the plane and the big LOGO of paradise company on the tail, a sense of pride welled up in their hearts ...FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com
