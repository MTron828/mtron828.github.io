2798 The rainbow (1)

Ruby did not criticize mark Rocca’s low – Level mistakes in the locker room during the halftime interval, even though mark Rocca himself appeared very guilty.

On the contrary, Ruby gave high praise to everyone’s performance in the first half, especially Xia ruofei and Wu Lei ‘s.

Of course, due to Xia ruofei’s special status, Ruby did not praise Xia ruofei like he praised Wu Lei. To be honest, he felt a little uncomfortable when he spoke to Xia ruofei in the tone of a coach.

The halftime interval was not long, so Ruby also seized the time to lay out the tactics for the second half.

He spoke quickly,”we still have to stabilize our defense in the second half!” Everyone had to carry out their defensive duties. Bar?a will definitely launch a fierce attack in the opening stage because they know that the situation will become more and more unfavorable for them as time goes on. What we have to do is to stop their attack 30 meters away, even if we have to resort to foul tactics or even pay a yellow card at the cost of it!”

Ruby looked at Naldo and the others and said,””The rear defensive line must pay attention to the defense! Their ground infiltration is very sharp, but as long as we don’t lose our position, they won’t have an absolute chance!”

There was one more thing that Ruby didn’t mention. Most of the time, it wasn’t an absolute opportunity, but it could still form a threatening attack. Those who could do this were star players. They could turn opportunities that weren’t opportunities into goals.

For example, Messi and zuyares.

Bar?a had no lack of star players.

Many teams in La Liga would choose a tight defense when facing Barcelona, but Barcelona’s winning rate was still very high. Many times, they relied on the star players ‘sudden inspiration.

Ruby was very clear about this, but he wouldn’t say it at this time. At this time, he could only boost the morale.

In fact, the players knew very well that in order to win against bar?a, in addition to focusing their energy on defense, they also needed a little luck many times.

But luck was also reserved for those who were prepared.

If they had not scored two goals early on, they could only pursue a draw at most.

And if their own players were not focused and made another low – Level mistake like in the first half, even if they were lucky, they would not be able to withstand it!

Ruby continued,”of course, I’ve always been against setting up a bus!” Even if he was facing the powerful Barca, he would still be like this! I don’t think we can hold on to the current score by relying purely on a tight defense, so! We need to seize every opportunity to counterattack!”

Ruby’s eyes swept across Wu Lei, iglysias, and Xia ruofei. He continued,””Bar?a’s massive pressure is foreseeable. Although our defense will be severely tested, this is also an opportunity for us. Once we intercept the ball in the backfield, the attacking players must firmly press on! As long as our counterattack can pose a threat, then the bar?a players will also have scruples when they press on. And if we can take the opportunity to score another goal, that would be even more wonderful!”

“I agree with coach Ruby!” Xia ruofei nodded. In the second half of the game, my position will be a little further back. Everyone, pass the ball to me as much as possible and I will organize the attack!”

Ruby nodded and said,”everyone, please remember Mr. Xia’s words!” In short, as long as Mr. Xia’s position is not too bad, everyone should try to pass the ball to him!”

In the end, Ruby saw that it was almost time, so he clapped his hands and shouted,””Young lads! Go and fight! Now we’re already ahead of the damn bar?a! There are only 45 minutes left until we defeat our mortal enemy from the same city! You guys are the best!”

……

The players from both teams returned to the field and the referee blew the whistle to start the second half.

The second half of the game was kicked off by bar?a. As expected, bar?a launched a fierce attack on the Spaniards as soon as the game started. With the exception of Longley, the other players quickly pressed past the half of the field. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Bar?a’s intention was obvious. They wanted to take advantage of the Spanish team’s unstable footing and equalize the score with a wave of fierce attacks.

However, Ruby had already made a targeted arrangement in the defense, and everyone was mentally prepared for such a situation. So, in the face of bar?a’s fierce attack, the Spaniards did not panic.

Their defense was still very organized, and the assistance of the players in the middle and backfield was also very timely. No matter how bar?a moved and shifted, the RCD Espanyol’s defense was always watertight.

In the opening five minutes, the football was always under the feet of the bar?a players, and the Spaniards did not even touch the ball once.

However, Barcelona did not find a good opportunity to attack. They could only continue to transmit through the ground and use the width of the field to frequently make large – scale movements, hoping to drive the Espanyol’s rear defensive line and pull out a gap.

In the 53rd minute, the Spaniards finally intercepted the ball through the pincer defense of two players.

Eight minutes into the second half, the Spain had only made their first contact with the ball, which was a bit pitiful.

The one who intercepted the ball was mark Rocca, who was in charge of the defensive midfielder position today. Although the manager, Ruby, did not reprimand him during the halftime interval, he held back his energy and wanted to make up for his mistake.

After mark Rocca intercepted the ball, he immediately thought of what Xia ruofei had said during the half – time break. He subconsciously looked left and right quickly and found that Xia ruofei had already appeared in a position six or seven meters away from him. There were no Barcelona players around him to defend.

Mark Rocca passed the ball to Xia ruofei decisively.

Xia ruofei ran towards the ball and shouted,””Guys! Charge forward!”

In fact, before Xia ruofei had even shouted, Wu Lei, iglesias, and Granello had already fired three arrows at the same time and rushed in the direction of bar?a’s penalty area.

After Xia ruofei received mark Rocca’s pass, it was as if he had eyes in the back of his head. He nimbly knocked the ball with the back of his foot, and the football just happened to pass over Arthur, who was rushing over to snatch the ball.

Xia ruofei’s position was near the center line, close to the left side. After he knocked the ball, he immediately turned around and chased in the direction of the football.

Artil once again became the background of this relaxed character.

He looked very embarrassed. Even when he couldn’t stop in time and hit Xia ruofei, Xia ruofei only staggered and quickly caught up with the football.

Xia ruofei didn’t even raise his head to look and immediately sent out a long pass.

The long pass was indeed “long.” The football flew high from the left side near the sidelines and flew towards the right side of bar?a’s penalty area, almost crossing half of the field.

The football drew an elegant arc in the air, like a beautiful rainbow, over the heads of all the Barcelona defenders, and fell two or three meters ahead of the penalty area.

At this moment, Wu Lei had just rushed to this position.

He had his back to Barcelona’s goal and jumped high in the direction of the ball.

Wu Lei’s jump was a little late, and he did not jump high enough. If he headed the ball from this position, his aim would definitely be bad, and such a header was difficult to use. So, even if the ball was headed within the goal range, the most likely result was that it would be confiscated by the opposing goalkeeper, terstein.

Therefore, Wu Lei did not choose to force his way in.

After he jumped into the air, he found that he had jumped a little too high, so he tried his best to lean back a little and then used his forehead to point the ball to iglasias, who had plugged in at high speed in the middle.

At this time, the bar?a defenders were basically attracted to Xia ruofei’s side. Langley, who was in the middle, did not even have time to return to his defensive position, so the middle was basically empty.

At this time, iglasias had just run into bar?a’s penalty area. Wu Lei had already sent the ball to him, and now he only needed to face half of the empty goal.

Even though iglasias’s reputation was not as prominent as that of a superstar like Messi, how could he spit out the meat that was being fed to his mouth?

He did not wait for the ball to fall to the ground. He kicked the ball directly and the football immediately flew in the direction of Barcelona’s goal.

At this time, Barcelona’s goalkeeper, telstergen, was a little off – Course because he had previously focused on guarding against Wu Lei’s header attacks.

The angle at which iglasias ‘kick shot was still rather tricky. Telstergen was completely out of his reach and could only wave his hand symbolically before he watched the football drill into his own goal.

3 to 1!

...

Espanyol once again widened the gap to two goals.

Everyone on and off the field was celebrating wildly. Ruby kept waving his arms and showing his signature big smile.

So far, his team members had executed his tactics perfectly. In terms of defense, they were united and watertight. The efficiency of their counterattacks was unexpectedly good. They only had one chance to counterattack and they succeeded.

Ruby was glad that Xia ruofei had returned to the team. If he had not tried his best to get Xia ruofei to play in the match, the score would have been different.

Xia ruofei also laughed happily. He ran from the center line and hugged iglasias and Wu Lei.

The Spanish players rushed over, and even the old goalkeeper, Diego Lopez, rushed up from the backfield. Everyone celebrated the goal amid the loud boos of the bar?a fans.

Xia ruofei touched iglysias’s head and smiled.””Hey! A Panda! Well done!”

“Panda”, which also won him a lot of recognition among the Chinese fans. Of course, the more important reason was that he was willing to cooperate with Wu Lei on the field, which created a lot of opportunities for Wu Lei.

“Mr. Xia, it’s your beautiful pass!” Iglasias grinned and said. Of course, Wu’s ferrying is also very beautiful. I only need to lightly touch it and the ball is there!”

Xia ruofei smiled at Wu Lei and said,”Lei, this guy is complimenting your beautiful header!”

Wu Lei laughed and spoke to Iglesia in broken Spanish,””Thanks for the compliment!”
