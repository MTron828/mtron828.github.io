Chapter 1217: Truffle season has arrived (2)

Translator: 549690339

Feng Rao nodded and said,””Isn’t that normal? Not only does it have an ultra – wide office area, but it also has a guest area, study room, bedroom, kitchen, activity room, chess room, conference room ... In short, it has all the functions and is 1500 square meters. Only by making the entire floor your office can you highlight your position in the company!”

Xia ruofei quickly waved his hand and said,”stop, stop!” I only spend a few days in the office all year round. Isn’t it a waste of money for you to build such a luxurious office?”

“Chairman, you need to keep up with the times!” Feng Rao immediately lectured. The utilization rate of the office was only one aspect of the problem, but the specifications of the chairman’s office could show the foundation and strength of a company! Even if this office is only used for one day a year, we still have to do it!”

Xia ruofei said helplessly,”I don’t care about those perverted logic. I just don’t allow this to happen on my side!”

“President ... You’re a dictator!” Feng Jing pouted and said,”didn’t you say that I’m in charge of all the specific work? Why are you interfering now?”

“You can’t mess around even if you’re the one in charge!” Xia ruofei said, not knowing whether to laugh or cry.

“I’m really not messing around. ” Feng Jing said seriously,”Chairman, do you think I was joking with you before? Our paradise company is developing too fast. I think it’s very likely that we’ll be able to stand shoulder to shoulder with big international corporations in two to three years. The chairman’s office really can’t be too shabby ...”

Xia ruofei shook his head helplessly and said,””Forget it, let’s each take a step back! There were two offices on the 15th floor, one for the chairman and the other for the General Manager. You’re also the main leader of the company. It’s not appropriate for you to squeeze on the same floor as the administration department ...”

Feng Rao’s heart warmed slightly. At the same time, she felt a burst of shyness and joy. Thinking that she and Xia ruofei would be the only ones working on the entire 15th floor in the future, she couldn’t help but look forward to it.

Xia ruofei continued,”by the way, you must make sure that your office has a nice lounge. I know you. You don’t even know whether it’s day or night when you work. It won’t be as convenient as Peach Blossom Farm in the future. The dormitory is above the office, so your lounge must be more comfortable and warm! I estimate that the utilization rate will be quite high. ”

“I understand,” Feng Jing nodded with a smile.”Thank you for your concern, Chairman.”

She continued,”I’ll gather all the key middle – ranking members of the company in the next two days. I’ll gather everyone’s needs for an office. Then, I’ll contact the renovation company to come up with a design plan. We’ll try to get the renovation done as soon as possible.”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes!” Don’t be afraid of spending money, make sure to use environmentally friendly materials. I don’t want my employees to work in an environment full of formaldehyde every day!”

“Understood!” Feng Rao said with a smile. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

The employees working on the farm already knew that the company had bought a six – story office building and that they would soon move to work in the city center. Everyone was very excited.

Although working here was far away from the hustle and bustle of the city, and the environment was good, and the company provided dormitories, it was also very convenient to eat in the company cafeteria. However, most of the employees were young people, and young people could not stand loneliness. In any case, everyone still yearned for the White – collared life in the office building of the CBD.

Moreover, Xia ruofei had promised on behalf of the company that the company would give them a certain amount of rent and transportation subsidies according to the different years of service. Therefore, even if they did not have free dormitories and had to rent a house in the city, their income would not be much less.

Feng Jing quickly called for a meeting with the company’s middle management to discuss the allocation of offices, staff adjustments, and the purchase of office equipment. The renovation company also quickly entered the office to do measurements and drawings. They began organizing staff to design according to the company’s requirements.

It was soon mid – November, and the weather was getting colder and colder. Especially since Taoyuan farm was very close to the sea, the wind was usually quite strong, so many employees wore thick coats to work.

During this period of time, Xia ruofei had been very quiet. Other than the occasional date with Ling Qingxue, he spent most of his time in the farm, the vegetable greenhouse, the pomfrets cultivation workshop, the tea – making studio, the orchard ... And other places. He would visit them when he had the time to show his concern for everyone’s work.

On the company’s side, everyone was full of energy. The jaded skin cream was on sale again, and the sales were equally hot. One e – commerce platform’s server even had a short – term congestion. There were too many people on jingbei, tengmao, and other platforms to buy it. Some people considered whether it would be easier to buy it on relatively smaller platforms. Unfortunately, more than one or two people had this idea, so it led to more traffic flowing to the other three e – commerce platforms. It even caused the server to be jammed.

Of course, these e – commerce platforms were at the forefront of the entire industry, and their emergency plans were very mature. The problem of difficult visits was quickly solved.

However, this little interlude also reflected the hot sales of the jaded skin cream.

Because more and more people had already used the jaded skin cream and witnessed its magical effects, now that the jaded skin cream no longer needed the peach blossom company to invest any advertising costs, the brand was enough to support itself by word of mouth.

Now, it would be sold twice a month, and the revenue each time was about 100 million Yuan, which meant that the fixed revenue could reach 200 million Yuan a month.

The production cost, labor cost, publicity cost, and transportation cost of the jaded skin cream were all very low. Moreover, it was mainly the initial investment, so the profit ratio was very high among the 200 million Yuan.

The remaining 170 million for the purchase of the Hengli building only needed one month to be easily collected.

The only problem now was production.

The factory could also increase the production line, which would not cost much, but the raw materials and medicinal herbs were not so easy to get.

Although the Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory had already signed cooperative planting agreements with many places, the planting of medicinal herbs also needed a cycle. Therefore, in the early stage, they mainly relied on purchasing large quantities of medicinal herbs to maintain production, which determined that the production capacity could never have a leap in development.

It was estimated that the limited sales policy would continue for half a year to a year. This was not an intentional hunger marketing strategy, and paradise Corporation did not have any particularly good solutions.

Xia ruofei’s life was carefree.

On this day, he was lying on the recliner on the balcony of the villa, reading a book while basking in the sun. His phone rang.

Xia ruofei looked at the caller ID. It was Hong Kong’s MA Xiong.

So he put the book aside and picked up the phone.””Good Morning, old Mr. MA!”

“Nice to meet you, Xia Sheng!” MA Xiong’s voice was very enthusiastic.

“Has old Mr. MA been well recently?”

“Good, good, good! It’s all thanks to you!” MA Xiong quickly said,”xiasheng, I came to you today because I have something to discuss with you.”

“Please speak!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”as long as it’s within my means, I will do my best!”

“Thank you!” MA Xiong said,”xiasheng, the first batch of truffles is going to be on the market soon. Due to factors such as rain and temperature, the production this year is at least 20% lower than the previous years. I think the price might hit a record high ... Xiasheng, I still remember the batch of truffles you put up for auction at the beginning of the year! Do you have any way to get truffles of similar quality this year?”

MA Xiong’s words also reminded Xia ruofei. He had not taken care of the oak trees and the soil with fungi after moving them to the mountain and sea realm. In the blink of an eye, it was already truffle season. He wondered if truffles were growing under the oak trees. How much could they produce this year?
