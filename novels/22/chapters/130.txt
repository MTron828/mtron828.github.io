Chapter 131: Going home for the new year (1)

Xia ruofei closed the car door and asked with a gentle smile,””Why are you looking for me?” One of the workers, who was in his forties and had a dark face, said,””Boss, now that the farm is completed, we’ve discussed it and feel that we should plant the vegetables immediately so that they can be sold on the market after the spring Festival!” This worker was called Cao tieshu. He was one of the young and vigorous workers among the 15. He had also worked outside and seen the world, so everyone recommended him to report to Xia ruofei. These days, the workers had been learning from the technical staff of the factory building the greenhouse, so they were very familiar with the performance of this modern greenhouse. They also knew that although it was winter now, planting vegetables in the greenhouse would not have any impact at all. So, everyone couldn’t hold it in anymore. They received a salary of 5000 Yuan a month, but it had been half a month since they did any real work. At most, they were just helping out at the construction site, so they couldn’t wait to start working. The rural people’s views were so simple. Xia ruofei smiled.”Old Cao, the new year is coming. I was thinking of letting everyone rest for a few days. We’ll talk about it after the new year!” “What are you resting for, boss?” asked Cao tieshu anxiously. We’re all trying our best to do a good job! I can’t take a break!” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh out loud. It was a good thing that the workers were so enthusiastic about work. Xia ruofei naturally wouldn’t dampen their enthusiasm. He thought for a moment, then nodded and said,”alright!” Then let’s start sowing tomorrow! My friend is using a new technology to grow some vegetables. I’ll go to his place in the city to buy the seeds. We’ll start work tomorrow!” “Alright!” Cao tieshu happily rubbed his hands and said,”boss, we’ll go to the greenhouse first. While the technicians from the manufacturers are still here, we can learn more. That greenhouse is too advanced ...” Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. The workers went to the greenhouse enthusiastically. Xia ruofei drove to San Shan city. He first went to Lingyu house to find boss Chen and bought the Jade that was worth two million Yuan. Then, Xia ruofei went to the forestry Bureau to inform them that he was going to pick up Hu Zi’s mother and Lin Qiao to return to Taoyuan farm together. This was also agreed in advance that everyone would be celebrating the New Year together this year. Xia ruofei had given them a call before they came to the city, so they had already prepared a change of clothes when Xia ruofei arrived at their house. “Brother ruofei!” Lin Qiao saw Xia ruofei and shouted happily. Today, Lin Qiao was wearing a rose – Red down jacket and a pair of skinny blue jeans. She had a lively ponytail and was full of youth. Xia ruofei also smiled and said,”Qiao’ er, how were your final exam results?” If it’s too bad, there won’t be any New Year presents this time!” Lin Qiao made a face at Xia ruofei and said,””I’m ranked 15th in my class this time!” “Oh, really? Our Qiao’ er is so powerful!” Xia ruofei said happily. Lin Qiao’s school was one of the top middle schools in the province, and her class was one of the top liberal arts classes in the school. Therefore, it was quite impressive for her to rank 15th. Xia ruofei knew that when Lin Qiao first transferred to this school, she was in the middle – lower range in the class of more than 50 people. “That’s right!” “You got your New Year’s gift, right?” Lin Qiao said with a proud expression. Hu Zi’s mother rolled her eyes at Lin Qiao and said,””Qiao’ er, you’re already so proud just because you got 15th place! You still dare to ask your brother ruofei for a gift?” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”Auntie, it wasn’t easy for Qiao’ er to get the 15th place!” She must have put in a lot of effort!” Lin Qiao grabbed Xia ruofei’s arm tightly and said,””Brother ruofei knows me best!” “Alright, alright! “How old are you? you’re still acting like a child ...” Hu Zi’s mother said with a smile. “Aunty, let’s go when everything is ready!” Xia ruofei said,”have you turned off the water, electricity, and gas in the house?” “It’s all good. ” Hu Zi’s mother smiled and said,”let’s go!” “Let’s go! We’re going to brother ruofei’s house for the new year!” Lin Qiao shouted happily. Each of them had one bag, and Xia ruofei easily picked them up with one in each hand. The three of them went downstairs and walked straight to Xia ruofei’s car. When Lin Qiao saw Xia ruofei unlocking the door with the remote control and opening the door of the Knight XV, she couldn’t help but open her eyes wide and exclaim,””This car is so cool! Brother ruofei, is this your car?” Xia ruofei smiled and nodded,”yeah!” I just got a new car, how do you feel?” “One word, cool!” Lin Qiao looked at Knight XV and murmured. Xia ruofei knocked on Lin Qiao’s head and said,””That’s three words!” “Brother ruofei, you’re so old – fashioned. Do you know what it’s like to say now?” Lin Qiao said with a smile. Xia ruofei didn’t expect to be looked down upon by this little girl. He didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. He opened the door of the back seat and said,””Auntie, Qiao’ er, there’s more space in the back, and it’s more comfortable. You two can sit in the back!” With that, Xia ruofei put their bags into the car. Lin Qiao immediately shouted,”I don’t want to!” It’ll only feel better when you’re sitting in front! Mom, you can sit at the back alone! I’ll go sit in front with brother ruofei!” “You crazy girl!” Hu ‘er’s mother laughed and scolded. She didn’t care about Lin Qiao and got into the car with Xia ruofei’s help. Lin Qiao couldn’t wait to open the door of the passenger seat. She stepped on the pedal with one foot and grabbed the handle with the other hand, and nimbly sat in the passenger seat. Xia ruofei walked around the front of the car and went to the driver’s seat. He opened the door and got in. After starting the car, Xia ruofei stepped on the accelerator lightly. Knight XV roared. Xia ruofei left the forestry Bureau’s residence and drove through the traffic of Sanshan city. On the way, Lin Qiao was very excited. She took out her phone and took pictures here and there. One moment, she fiddled with the high – end sound system in the car, and the next moment, she was very interested in the huge LCD screen in the central control. This made Hu Zi’s mother very nervous. She was fidgeting in the back seat and kept reminding Lin Qiao not to touch the things in the car for fear that she would affect Xia ruofei’s driving. Xia ruofei didn’t care. He just looked at Lin Qiao affectionately with a relaxed smile. The car drove out of the city’s traffic and drove quickly along the winding highway. Soon, they returned to Taoyuan farm. Xia ruofei did not stop the car. He drove along the newly built asphalt road inside the farm to the courtyard of the holiday villa. As soon as Xia ruofei and the rest got off the car, lightning rushed over and pounced on Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei caressed Lightning’s smooth fur and told it that Hu Zi’s mother and Lin Qiao were his family members. He also reminded it not to scare them. Then, Xia ruofei asked pang Hao to bring the mother and daughter around the farm while he took out the bag of Jade from the trunk and went upstairs. He couldn’t wait to let the spirit painting scroll absorb the Jade ...
