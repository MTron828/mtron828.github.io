2075 The yacht arrives at the harbor (2)

As for the rest of the money, it was nothing to Xia ruofei. Not to mention the wealth that he had accumulated previously, just the trip to Italy alone had earned him 270 million euros. 1.85 million HxB was not even a fraction of that amount.

Not long after Xia ruofei hung up, he received a friend request on WeChat. Hello, Mr. Xia, I’m Xiao Liao!

Xia ruofei clicked ‘accept’ and at the same time, he blocked his WeChat moments. Usually, unless it was his good friends in real life, Xia ruofei would not let his business friends or today’s situation see his WeChat moments.

He was still not used to revealing his privacy, so it was a coincidence that he became a popular person on the internet, envied by some celebrities.

Liao Bo quickly sent an address to Xia ruofei and wrote,”Mr. Xia, I’ll be waiting for you at the office!

Xia ruofei looked at the address and did some calculations in his heart. He replied,””I’ll be there in half an hour. ”

Then, Xia ruofei kept the spirit map space back into his body. He picked up his handbag and stuffed his phone into it. Then, he walked down the stairs with light steps.

The long – distance yacht Pier was located on the coast of the Jiangkou District of Sanshan city. It was basically between Changping County and the city. However, it was a walk – through from Taoyuan farm. It was not like the airport Highway to the city, which was connected to the winding city. Hence, Xia ruofei gave an estimated time of half an hour.

Xia ruofei greeted Blackie and the rest in the villa’s yard. Then, he got into the Knight XV SUV. With the roaring engine, the car left the farm and headed towards the Jiangkou District.

Twenty minutes later, Xia ruofei arrived at the long distance Yacht Harbor according to the GPS on his WeChat.

From afar, he could already see Liao Bo, who was dressed in a suit and leather shoes, waiting at the entrance.

Xia ruofei drove near Liao Bo and honked. Then, he stuck his head out and shouted,””Manager Liao!”

Liao Bo turned his head and looked. He quickly jogged over and said with a smile,””Mr. Xia, you’re pretty fast!”

“The yacht that I’ve been waiting for has finally arrived. Of course, I had to fly all the way here!” Xia ruofei said with a smile. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Liao Bo explained awkwardly,”Mr. Xia, I’m sorry!” The yacht was originally expected to be delivered within two months, but there were two delays in the factory. In addition, there was a small incident during the transportation process, which led to a longer delay. ”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it’s okay. Good food is never afraid of late!” Manager Liao, let’s talk in the car!”

“Alright!”

Liao Bo excitedly went to the side of the front passenger seat, opened the door, and climbed in.

He sat in the passenger seat of the Knight XV off – Road vehicle and said enviously,””Mr. Xia, your car is really exciting! From the outside, it looked as domineering as an armored vehicle! The chassis is so high and the view is so wide ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”no matter how domineering it is, it’s not as valuable as your yacht ...”

Actually, Xia ruofei was being modest. At least, his Knight XV was much more expensive than the azimuttlantis 34 yacht he had ordered.

Liao Bo guided the way in the car and Xia ruofei quickly drove the car to a three – story building next to the yacht Pier.

“We’re here, Mr. Xia!” Liao Bo said.

Xia ruofei looked at Liao Bo and asked,””Why did I come to your office first? Shouldn’t I take a look at the yacht first?”

Liao Bo smiled and said,”don’t worry. I’ll definitely ask you to check and accept it before the delivery. However, we need to go through a registration procedure to board the yacht. So, I’ll have to trouble you ...”

“I see! Then let’s go!” Xia ruofei opened the door and jumped out of the car. He followed Liao Bo into the lobby on the first floor.

“Manager Qin!” Liao Bo greeted him as soon as he entered the door,”manager Qin, my client has arrived!”

A beautiful woman in business attire walked over with a friendly smile. She extended her hand to Xia ruofei from afar and said,””Hello, Mr. Xia! Welcome, welcome! I’m the manager of this office, my name is Qin Lan!”

“Hello, manager Qin!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”nice to meet you!”

“Little Liao has gone to go through the formalities. Please sit for a while. You’ll be able to see your yacht soon!” Qin Lan said.

Xia ruofei sat on the guest sofa in the main hall while Qin Lan personally accompanied him and chatted with him.

Xia ruofei realized that manager Qin was very talkative and knew the art of conversation. She could make people feel close to her.

After a while, Liao Bo Ran over with a few pieces of paper and said,””Mr. Xia, there are a few places here that require your personal signature. I also need a copy of your identity card. Can I trouble you to pass me your identity card?”

“Oh, I have some ready – made ones here.” Xia ruofei said.

Then, Xia ruofei took out a file from his bag and took out a copy of his ID card to pass to Liao Bo.

“That’s great, we don’t have to make copies!” Liao Bo said happily.

Xia ruofei picked up the papers that needed his signature and read them carefully. They were mostly disclaimers and the like.

If Xia ruofei went to look at the yacht, he would have to board it. He might even ask to go for a walk. If anything dangerous happened during this period, the company would be responsible.

Seeing that there was no problem, Xia ruofei picked up the pen and signed his name. At the same time, he carefully wrote the words “for yacht – related procedures” on the ID photocopier and stamped it on top of the photocopied id to prevent it from being used for other illegal activities.

Although it was unlikely for such a large company to sell out their customer’s information, Xia ruofei was used to preparing for the worst.

Liao Bo kept the documents and said to Xia ruofei,””Mr. Xia, please wait a moment! I’ll hand in this information and we can go to the dock!”

Soon, Liao Bo left and returned. The man who came with him was a man in his thirties. He had dark skin and looked like he often went out.

Liao Bo introduced,”Mr. Xia, this is Liu Yi, an employee of our Yacht Club. He has a yacht driving license. You can take a tour around the area on the yacht later!”

Xia ruofei got up and said,”let’s go!” Manager Qin, I’ll be going to the dock first!”

“Alright! Alright!” Qin Lan also quickly stood up and said.

At this stage in the country, yachts were still a luxury item that very few people could afford. Although Xia ruofei had only bought a small 10 – meter boat, one could tell at a glance that he was young and rich. It was natural to make friends with such a big customer.

The car was not allowed to drive directly to the yacht dock, so Liao Bo asked for an electric car. The three of them took the electric car and headed to the yacht dock not far away.

After a short while, Xia ruofei and the rest had arrived at the dock.

The voyage yacht dock didn’t look small. There were at least dozens of yacht parking spaces, but many of them were empty.

Xia ruofei immediately saw the yacht, azimuttlantis 34, quietly docked at berth 16, rising and falling with the waves.

The yacht looked even more beautiful than in the brochure. It was blue under the blue sky, and there were eye – catching red decorative ribbons on both sides of the White hull, which looked like red lightning.

At first sight, the streamlined body of the airship looked athletic.

The electric car stopped next to the parking space. Liao Bo jumped out of the car and said with a smile,””Mr. Xia, this is your yacht!”

Xia ruofei and Liu Yi also got out of the car. The staff had already put down the bridge. Liao Bo came to the side of the bridge and made a gesture to Xia ruofei, saying,””Mr. Xia, this way please!”

Xia ruofei smiled and walked over to the deck.

Liao Bo and Liu Yi also got on the yacht in turn. He said,””Mr. Xia, I’ll show you around first, then we’ll try driving it again, how about that?”
