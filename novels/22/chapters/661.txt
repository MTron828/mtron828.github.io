Chapter 662: Spirit map world’s tea house (2)

Feng Rao looked at Xia ruofei.

As the company’s general manager, Feng Jing naturally knew how much money the company had in its account. However, peach blossom company could not be measured with common sense. Often, when the company’s account was almost exhausted due to various projects being carried out at the same time, Xia ruofei would suddenly inject a sum of money into it.

This young Chairman always seemed to be able to find funds miraculously.

In fact, even if they didn’t rely on extra funds, the current capital chain of paradise Corporation was still very healthy.

After the expansion of the farm was completed, with the increase in production capacity, the estimated monthly profit of Taoyuan vegetables could reach about eight million Yuan.

The sales of the Drunken Eight Immortals were extremely high. By the time all the different grades of wine were on the market, Xia ruofei’s monthly profit would be about 12 million Yuan.

The Ironhide fengdou company had an income of more than 22 million a month and a half, which was about 15 million a month on average.

This didn’t include the huge profits from the pomfrets and the dividends from the Australian farms, because these couldn’t generate a lot of profits in the short term.

Regardless, just the three items above could bring 35 million in cash flow to the company, and the cost was almost negligible.

Besides, if he was really short on money, Xia ruofei could sell some wild ginseng or some jinsi Phoebe Wood. It was an easy task for Xia ruofei to raise money now.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”boss Feng, money is not a problem. However, the relocation of the headquarters is not urgent at the moment. Once the relocation happens, it will involve a lot of people. We can’t rush it.” How about this, we’ll list the relocation of the headquarters as the company’s key work for the next two years. Our initial goal is to relocate the headquarters before the pharmaceutical factory officially goes into production. What do you think?”

“En!” Feng Rao nodded. This way, it won’t affect the company’s normal operations. I agree!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”then, the burden on your shoulders will be even heavier!” From today onwards, you’ll have to start thinking about the location of the company’s headquarters. ”

......

Feng Rao shrugged and said with a smile, “I’m used to it, don’t worry!”

Xia ruofei raised his head and laughed.

He didn’t return to the office building with Feng Jing. Instead, he waved goodbye to Feng Jing at the fork in the road and returned to the small villa.

……

Spirit map world, Archean realm.

Xia ruofei’s figure appeared out of thin air. Xia Qing, who was in a deep sleep, immediately sensed it and opened her eyes.

“Master!” Xia Qing replied respectfully.

Xia ruofei nodded with a smile and walked towards the spiritual heart tree.

Today was the day the spirit Heart Flower bloomed again. After Xia Qing’s improvement and care during this period, Xia ruofei was looking forward to the spirit Heart Flower that bloomed this time. He didn’t know if it would bring him any surprises.

Xia Qing smiled as she followed behind Xia ruofei.

On the spirit heart tree, a flower that seemed to contain the ultimate truth of heaven and earth and exuded a mysterious aura had quietly bloomed.

Xia ruofei’s eyes fell on it, and he counted it silently with a hint of excitement. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

1、2、3、4、5……6!

Six petals!

After 20 days in the outside world and more than a year of transformation in the Archean realm, the spirit Heart flower’s petals finally broke through the original upper limit.

In the last two upgrades of the spatial space, the number of petals of the spirit Heart Flower had not changed. Xia ruofei knew that without Xia Qing, the number of petals would have been fixed no matter how the spatial space upgraded!

“Good job!” Xia ruofei said happily,”Xia Qing, you’re really something!”

“Master,” Xia Qing said humbly,”I’m still far from the limit of nine petals. I still have to work hard.”

Xia ruofei laughed and patted Xia Qing’s shoulder.”Take it slow. There’s no hurry. I can wait!”

Xia ruofei asked Xia Qing to collect the petals of the spirit Heart Flower, and then he patrolled the space.

The iron – Skin Dendrobium, wild ginseng, golden nanmu, and the precious Dahongpao parent tree – these were the crops that Xia ruofei had specifically instructed. Xia Qing had taken care of them carefully. Although there were no visible changes for the time being, Xia ruofei could feel that they seemed to be more energetic.

At this moment, Xia ruofei’s gaze fell on the rows of small flower pots.

He was pleasantly surprised to find that these small flower pots were all filled with succulent plants, and they seemed to have been planted not long ago.

“Xia Qing, did you do all this?” Xia ruofei asked.

“Yes, master,” Xia Qing replied,”I saw many empty flower pots on the side, and there were cut marks on the plants. I guessed that master must have used them for cutting, so I made my own decision ...”

Xia ruofei said happily,”sure!” Xia Qing, I’ll leave the succulents to you in the future. You just need to take care of them when you’re free. ”

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing replied.

“If there are too many succulent seedlings, you can directly move to the mountain sea realm. There’s a lot of space there.” Xia ruofei said,”let me know if you don’t have enough flower pots. I’ll send more in!”

“Alright,” he said.

It had been a while since Xia ruofei’s meat store on Taobao had a new product. It was mainly because he was getting busier and busier, and the profits from the succulents were becoming less and less significant to Xia ruofei.

However, since Xia Qing was a free labor force, Xia ruofei had the idea of continuing to do this business.
