Chapter 1543: Heart – concentrating grass (2)

Translator: 549690339

However, Xia ruofei was the only one in the space, so it was a little quieter.

This Island had only appeared after the upgrade, and the space here had been sealed off. Hence, Xia ruofei did not dare to be careless. He walked onto the beach while maintaining a high level of vigilance.

Xia ruofei noticed that the island was covered with common rainforest vegetation. After crossing the beach, he went straight into the forest.

The island wasn’t big. Xia ruofei could easily find an unusual place.

About ten to twenty meters into the forest, Xia ruofei saw a man – made garden.

Through the fence, Xia ruofei could clearly see that there were many plants that he could not name. Some of them even had colorful flowers.

“Master, you should have seen the herb garden on spirit map Island, right?” Xia Qing used her divine sense to contact Xia ruofei.

“Mm! This is a medicine garden?” Xia ruofei was a little excited.

To be able to be planted in this herb garden, they should all be very precious spirit herbs, right?

“Yes,” Xia Qing said.”Most of the spiritual herbs in the herb garden should not be ripe yet, but one of the heart – concentrating grass should have already matured. Master, you can look for it.”

Then, Xia Qing described the appearance of the heart concentrating grass to Xia ruofei in detail and taught him how to pick it.

Xia ruofei strode into the herb garden. There was a semi – Transparent protective barrier around the herb garden, but it did not hinder Xia ruofei, the owner of the space, and he walked in easily.

Xia ruofei walked carefully in the herb garden. He knew that although most of the spiritual herbs were not mature, they must be very valuable. He was afraid of stepping on any of them.

In a short while, Xia ruofei found the heart concentrating grass that Xia Qing had mentioned in a corner of the herb garden.

This heart concentrating grass was as green as a carved jade. There was even a faint light flowing on each leaf. One look and one could tell that it was not ordinary grass.

Xia ruofei paid special attention. The bottom of the heart – concentrating grass was already slightly red. This was what Xia Qing had said earlier, a sign of the heart – concentrating grass ‘maturity.

“Xia Qing, I’ve found it!” Xia ruofei said excitedly,”the heart – concentrating grass has ripened!”

“Master, then just follow what I taught you just now and pick it!” Xia Qing said.

Xia ruofei carefully followed Xia Qing’s instructions. He took out a small knife and gently cut off the leaves of the heart concentrating grass three centimeters above the bottom. Then, he quickly put them into the jade box.

According to Xia Qing, the heart – concentrating grass was a bit like leeks. It would grow again after being harvested, but its growth cycle was much longer than that of leeks, at least more than ten years.

Xia ruofei found it strange too. Since these spiritual herbs took so long to mature, why weren’t they placed in the Archean realm? There was a time formation there, so wouldn’t it greatly shorten the time needed to harvest?

However, Xia ruofei’s main focus was to wake up Song Wei, so he didn’t have the time to ask Xia Qing. He thought that the previous owner of this spirit map space was so powerful, so it should be reasonable for him to arrange this.

After obtaining the heart – concentrating herb, Xia ruofei did not bother to take a closer look at the herb garden and the island. He walked straight out.

He took the jade box containing the heart concentrating grass in his hand and swam out of the range of the space blockade in a rather awkward posture. Then, with a thought, his figure disappeared from the sea and appeared next to Xia Qing in the next moment.

As for his mobile phone and other personal belongings that had been floating on the surface of the sea, they were naturally moved over in an instant.

“I’ve brought the thing, how do we wake Song Wei up?” Xia ruofei asked.

At this moment, he felt that the jade box in his hand was very heavy. This was an opportunity he had obtained after his space had advanced two levels. Moreover, he had also noticed that there was only one mature heart concentrating grass in the entire medicine garden.

Xia Qing hesitated for a moment before she said,”master, this heart – concentrating grass is a precious spiritual herb that is very helpful in nourishing the soul. If a cultivator were to use it, it can greatly improve their spiritual power cultivation ...”

After saying this, Xia Qing looked at Xia ruofei and asked,””Actually ... We can continue to try the spirit nourishment soup. Perhaps it will have an effect after drinking it a few more times? This heart – concentrating grass is really too precious, and it’s also very helpful for master’s cultivation ...”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and interrupted Xia Qing,””Say no more. I have to wake Song Wei up as soon as possible. I’m willing to pay any price. Let’s just use the heart – concentrating grass!”

Xia Qing let out a sigh. He still felt a little regretful.

However, since Xia ruofei was so determined, he would definitely obey his orders.

Therefore, Xia Qing quickly said,”there are many ways to use the heart – concentrating grass. The simplest way is to take it directly. However, I know a way to maximize the medicinal properties of the heart – concentrating grass. However, this requires the cooperation of several other herbs.”

“Is there any in the space?” Xia ruofei asked.

“They are all common herbs. They are used as medicine catalysts.” Xia Qing said,”the medicinal herbs that master purchased previously can be matched.”

“Alright, then I’ll leave it to you!” Xia ruofei said and then asked,”Xia Qing, after using the heart concentrating grass, what are the chances of Song Wei’s soul recovery?”

Xia Qing smiled bitterly.”Even a rare spirit herb like the heart – concentrating grass is used. Unless the injury to her soul has reached the point where her soul is about to scatter, she will definitely be able to recover. Moreover, it will be very beneficial to her soul ...”

Xia Qing had always felt that it was a pity. At the same time, she also felt that the lady named Song Wei was very lucky. Her master had used the heart concentrating grass on her without hesitation. If she were to walk the path of cultivation in the future, at least she would have an advantage over others in terms of spiritual power.

Xia ruofei replied without hesitation,””Xia Qing, I’ll have to trouble you then. Quickly prepare the medicine!”

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing sighed and quickly said.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”then let me know when you’re ready!” I’ll go out first. ”

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing said.

Hence, Xia ruofei went to the stone room to check on Song Wei’s condition. Then, he returned to the outside world.

He sat on the sofa in the living room and smoked a cigarette. He heaved a long sigh of relief in his heart. Since Xia Qing said so, it meant that she was still very confident.

As for the precious heart – concentrating grass, Xia ruofei only felt a slight heartache and did not feel that it was a waste.

Just then, Xia ruofei’s phone rang.

He picked it up and took a look. It was Yu mingdong.

“President Yu.” Xia ruofei answered the call. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Mr. Xia, have you dealt with those raw stones?” Yu mingdong asked with a smile.

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment before he reacted. He smiled and said,””I’ve already given them to my friend ...”

“In that case, would Mr. Xia be interested in coming over?” Yu mingdong asked,”I’m in luck today. I won a few raw stones. I’m going to open them tonight!”

Xia ruofei’s heart skipped a beat. He remembered that Yu mingdong had spent more than 20 million to buy the raw stone, which was likely to be a loss.

Then, Xia ruofei remembered that he still had a raw stone that he had spent more than eight million on. Now that the spirit map space had been upgraded, he naturally had no use for that raw stone.

His mind whirred, and then he said with a smile,””Alright! I haven’t seen a stone being opened before! It’s not a bad idea to come and gain some knowledge!”

“That’s good! I’ll get Lei Zi to come and pick you up!” Yu mingdong said.

Today, he was lucky enough to win a few raw gemstones that he had high hopes for, so he was in a good mood.

“No need, no need. It’s not far from jadeite Street. I’ll take a taxi!” Xia ruofei said,”but President Yu, you can open the stone when I’m here! I still have another raw stone that I want to open!”

“No problem!” Yu mingdong promised.

Xia ruofei contacted Xia Qing with his spiritual sense and asked her to keep the medicine after he had made it. He would wait until he returned to the hotel.

Then, Xia ruofei took the deposit slip, went out, took a taxi, and went straight to the jadeite Street.
