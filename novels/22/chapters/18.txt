The bus quickly drove out of South Station, stopping and moving slowly in the congested roads of the city. About half an hour later, it got on the expressway and its speed increased.

Xia Ruofei had been sitting in his seat with his eyes closed, but he was a little emotional.

This petal solution had a miraculous effect on such a serious acute heart attack. It also gave Xia Ruofei more confidence in curing Hu Zi’s mother’s uremia.

He opened his eyes, took the business card from his jacket pocket and looked at it.

He saw that it was written with the words “Professor Tian Ruwen, School of Life Science and Engineering at Three Mountain University.” It also had his office phone, personal phone, email, and other information.

He did not expect the old man he saved to be a university professor. Xia Ruofei was also slightly surprised.

However, this matter was just a small interlude for Xia Ruofei. The reason why he accepted the business card was only to get out as soon as possible so that he would not miss the bus. He had no intention of blackmailing the man for a reward. It was definitely impossible for him to contact this Professor Tian in the future.

…

Just as the bus Xia Ruofei was on was driving towards Changping County, a group of people in white coats were waiting solemnly at the entrance of the Three Mountain City People’s Hospital. The medical staff entering and exiting the hospital had clearly become a little reserved. It was obvious that the people in white coats were all supervisors in the hospital.

A black Audi A6 approached at high speed and pulled up in front of the hospital’s outpatient building.

The door on the passenger side opened quickly and a woman in her early thirties in a beige business suit got out quickly. But before she could walk around to the backseat, the door opened directly and a woman in a small black business suit got out, looking anxious.

The woman was in her mid-forties, with delicate make-up on her face. She was in good shape. She looked plump but not fat and had a certain charm.

She got out of the car and stood there, her body naturally emitting this aura. This aura must have accumulated over time, and it was impossible for ordinary people to have it.

When the hospital leaders waiting in front of the outpatient building saw the Audi A6, they quickly approached it. However, they did not expect the woman to push open the door and get out without waiting for the secretary to open it. Therefore, the leaders had no choice but to speed up and jog directly to the woman.

One of the doctors with gold-rimmed glasses was half a step ahead of the other hospital leaders. He came up to the woman and called out with a hint of respect.

“Mayor Tian!”

If one often followed the local news, they would definitely recognize at a glance that this woman in a black professional suit was the mayor of Three Mountain City, Tian Huilan.

She was considered a political celebrity.

In a patriarchal society, female officials, especially high-ranking officials, were as rare as phoenix feathers and qilin horns. However, this Mayor Tian had already risen to a leadership position at the official level when she was around forty years old. Furthermore, she was the mayor of the provincial capital, Three Mountain City. This was even more eye-catching.

Now, she had been in office for five to six years. These five to six years were also the period of rapid development in Three Mountain City. Her outstanding political achievements were countless.

That year was an election year. There were rumors that Mayor Tian would probably take it a step further and replace Secretary Du, who was about to retire.

It had to be known that the secretaries of provincial capitals were all concurrent members of the provincial committee. In other words, this female mayor was very likely to become a high-ranking deputy minister soon, and a member of the provincial committee with a lot of power.

With the arrival of such a big shot, it was no wonder that the leaders of the City People’s Hospital had come out in full force to welcome her.

Tian Huilan’s face was filled with anxiety. She couldn’t be bothered to exchange pleasantries with these hospital leaders and directly asked.

“Director He, how is my father?”

“Mayor Tian, I went to understand the situation immediately after receiving your call. Professor Tian was indeed admitted to our hospital,” Director He quickly reported. “The preliminary diagnosis is an acute myocardial infarction, but don’t worry, the situation isn’t very serious. His life shouldn’t be in danger.”

When Tian Huilan heard this, she heaved a sigh of relief. Then, she frowned and said.

“My father’s heart has always been quite good! How did he suddenly have a heart attack?”

Director He quickly explained.

“Mayor Tian, some cardiovascular diseases might not be very obvious in the beginning. The patient himself might not be able to detect it. Even a routine physical examination might not be able to detect it. Moreover, Professor Tian is already so old. It’s normal for some minor problems to appear in his organs…”

Tian Huilan nodded and said.

‘Where is my father now, Director He?’

“I’ve already arranged for Director Chen of cardiovascular medicine to follow up personally. A full examination should be underway now. I’ll bring you over now!” Director He said.

Tian Huilan nodded and looked at the hospital leaders surrounding her.

“Director He can accompany me. Comrades, go back to work!”

Originally, the hospital leaders had appeared together to show their importance to their leaders. However, now that the old man was suddenly hospitalized, it was naturally impossible for them to gather around and give instructions like usual.

Therefore, the hospital leaders immediately bade farewell and left.

Director He accompanied Tian Huilan and her secretary, Wu Liqian, to the elevator.

In the elevator, Director He received a call. After a few hurried words, he immediately hung up and said to Tian Huilan.

“Mayor Tian, Professor Tian has completed the examination. We have arranged for a high-class ward…”

“Then let’s go directly to the ward!” Tian Huilan immediately said.

“Okay, okay,” Director Ho said, pressing the floor button.

They soon arrived at the hospital’s high-class ward. It was the best ward in the city’s People’s Hospital. Not only did it have a small reception room, but it also had a study, an accompanying room, and a small kitchen. The facilities were quite complete.

Tian Huilan and the others waited in the ward for a while before they heard Professor Tian’s voice coming from the corridor.

“Since there’s nothing wrong with my body, there’s no need to go to the trouble of being hospitalized! I want to go straight back!”

“Professor Tian, acute myocardial infarction is no joke. You have to stay in the hospital for observation!” A calm voice said.

Tian Huilan quickly opened the ward door and walked out. As soon as she stepped out, she saw her father sitting in a wheelchair with a helpless expression. A young and beautiful female nurse was pushing the wheelchair, and there was a middle-aged doctor in a white coat explaining to him as he walked.

This old man was Professor Tian, whom Xia Ruofei had saved at the passenger terminal.

Xia Ruofei would never have thought that the old man he happened to save was actually the father of a dazzling female political star.

Professor Tian’s gray hair was a little messy, and there was a piece of gauze on his forehead—he had knocked his forehead on the ground when he fainted, and he looked much older.

Tears welled up in Tian Huilan’s eyes. She hurried forward and asked in a choked voice.

“Dad! How are you feeling?”
