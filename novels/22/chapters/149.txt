Chapter 150: Chapter 147 – everyone is happy (1)

Chen tie quivered in fear and lowered his head, not daring to speak. At this time, his intestines were about to turn green with regret. If he had known that he would get into such big trouble, he would not have stepped into this muddy water even if he was beaten to death. How cool would it be to comfortably stay at home, warm a fire, and play cards! Now that the matter had blown up, his future was bleak ... Xu Jianbo looked at the pair of cousins in front of him, and his eyes were about to spit fire. These two fellows who could do nothing but ruin things had caused such a ruckus on the first day of the new year. They were simply adding to the trouble! It could be said that he even wanted to bury them alive. Xu Jianbo took a deep breath and quickly adjusted his facial expression. He said to Wu Liqian sincerely,””Mayor Wu, I want to reflect on this matter. The county Public Security Bureau has problems in its administrative management and work style. This is my responsibility. I will definitely do a deep reflection in the Bureau’s Party Committee and immediately carry out a major rectification of work style and discipline within the Public Security Bureau ...” Wu Liqian waved her hand and said,”director Xu, it’s right for us to investigate, reflect, and rectify the problem. However, things should be prioritized. It’s the Spring Festival holiday now, and everyone has worked hard for a year. Wouldn’t it be a panic if we were to rectify it now?” I suggest that after the holiday is over, we can conduct a Discipline Inspection in the Public Security Bureau. Let’s forget about the holiday!” When Xu Jianbo heard that, he immediately revealed a grateful expression and said,””Yes! Thank you for your understanding, Mayor Wu ...” He was also secretly impressed by Wu Liqian’s beautiful play. If Wu Liqian had not relented, he could imagine how chaotic the Public Security Bureau’s internal department would be during the spring Festival holiday. All sorts of inspections, self – examination, discussions, and learning could drive people crazy. Moreover, so many people had seen what had happened today. By then, the entire County would know that he, Xu Jianbo, had been incompetent and severely criticized by County Head Wu. He had even implicated the entire Public Security Bureau. The result would definitely be his prestige being destroyed. Wu Liqian’s current way of handling things was basically giving Xu Jianbo a warning. Not only had she achieved her goal of beating Xu Jianbo down, but she had also left him some face to a certain extent. Wu Liqian had even sent away the accompanying personnel in advance. It could be said that only a few people in the ward knew the final outcome of today’s incident. This way, Xu Jianbo’s prestige would at least be preserved. In other words, although Xu Jianbo had been beaten up by Wu Liqian today, he still had to thank her in secret. Xu Jianbo could not help but secretly admire Secretary Tian’s methods. He felt that the person who had been trained by Secretary Tian’s side was indeed extraordinary! And the more powerful Wu Liqian’s methods were, the more the scales in Xu Jianbo’s heart would naturally tilt in her favor. This was what Wu Liqian wanted to achieve. Wu Liqian showed a gentle smile and said,””Director Xu, the reorganization can be delayed, but this matter can not be delayed! Little Xia has been wronged for no reason, and this sister – in – Law has also suffered such serious injuries. All of these have to be dealt with immediately to give the parties involved an explanation. ” “Yes, yes,” Xu Jianbo said. He suddenly realized that he still had to deal with Xia ruofei, the God. This was someone who had a say in Secretary Tian! Xu Jianbo quickly said to Xia ruofei,”Mr. Xia, I’m really sorry for what happened today. I apologize to you on behalf of the Public Security Bureau!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”director Xu, you’re being too serious. It’s inevitable that there will be black sheep in every unit. I just hope that your Bureau can severely deal with the relevant people responsible. Also, I hope that the medical expenses, nutrition expenses, and delay in work of the family members of our employees during their recovery period can be properly resolved.” Xia ruofei had vaguely guessed Wu Liqian’s intention, so he did not give Xu Jianbo a hard time. “Of course, of course ...” Xu Jianbo said quickly.”There is no doubt that the responsibility for this matter has been determined. All the responsibility lies with Chen Gang. We will definitely deal with the local police and Auxiliary Police seriously. We will also urge the compensation to be paid as soon as possible. Before the compensation is paid, the medical expenses of the injured will be paid by our Public Security Bureau in advance. Is this okay?” “Sure, I’ll thank director Xu on behalf of Cao and his wife.” Xia ruofei said with a smile. “No, no, we should be the ones saying sorry.” Xu Jianbo said quickly. Then, he sincerely apologized to Cao tieshu and his wife. He then said to Wu Liqian,””Mayor Wu, I’d like to ask for a leave of absence. I won’t be participating in the visits later. I have to go back to the Bureau to deal with today’s matter.” Wu Liqian smiled and nodded,””Thank you for your hard work, director Xu!” Xu Jianbo nodded at Wu Liqian, then glared at Chen tie and Chen Gang and said,””Hurry up and leave! What an embarrassing thing!” After he finished speaking, he walked straight out of the door, while Chen Gang and the others followed behind Xu Jianbo with ashen faces, as if they had lost their parents, and left the ward in a sorry state. After Xu Jianbo left, Wu Liqian personally came to the bed again. With a gentle smile on her face, she said,””Sister – in – Law, I’m sorry for what happened today. I apologize to you on behalf of the county party Committee and the county government.” Cao tieshu and his wife both knew that this beautiful young woman in front of them was a County Head. In their eyes, she was an extraordinary official, so the two of them were somewhat in fear and trepidation. Cao tieshu also said,”Mayor Wu, thank you for standing up for us!” You’re the Lord of the clear sky ...” Cao tieshu’s wife also thanked her profusely, which made Wu Liqian feel a little embarrassed. At the same time, she also felt that Yingluo’s actions were originally Chen Gang’s outrageous and lawless actions. She had only upheld justice, and the people were already so grateful. Looking at this simple farmer couple, she once again felt the heavy weight of the words “as an official, you can benefit the people”. After saying a few words, Wu Liqian was about to leave as well. A large group of people were still waiting for her to give her condolences in the conference room! Xia ruofei personally sent her to the door, then stopped and said,””Sis Wu, thank you for today!” Wu Liqian gave Xia ruofei a meaningful look and chuckled.””Little Xia, I have to thank you too!” Xia ruofei pretended to be confused and said,”why are you thanking me?” I’ve been causing trouble for you all day. I guess you’re afraid of answering my calls now!” Wu Liqian laughed and glared at Xia ruofei. “Don’t give me that ... I can’t wait for you to get into trouble like this a few more times ... Alright, I’ll stop talking to you. I still have work to do!” “Alright, you can go back to your work!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you’re welcome to come to our farm for inspection and guidance when you’re free!” “Alright! I’ll definitely give you some good guidance!” Wu Liqian chuckled. After she finished speaking, she waved at Xia ruofei and walked out of the hospital. At this moment, Xia ruofei suddenly thought of something and quickly called out to Wu Liqian. [PS] the ranking on the monthly rankings has been sliding down. I beg for everyone’s support.
