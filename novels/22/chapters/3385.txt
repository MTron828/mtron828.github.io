Chapter 3386: Unfathomable (2)

He also began to have a rough and direct understanding of the stone pillar array. At least, he already had a vague outline in his heart.

However, the designer’s array skills were much better than his and there were many possibilities for the stone pillar array. Hence, Xia ruofei could only make a rough guess and was far from finding a breakthrough.

Then, Xia ruofei didn’t continue to study the position of the formation. Instead, he started to study the formation patterns on each stone pillar.

According to his own rough understanding, he numbered these stone pillars in his mind, and then began to study the formation patterns on the first stone pillar.

As soon as he entered the study of formation patterns, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be amazed.

If there was enough time, Xia ruofei was even willing to stay in the array without eating or drinking. He would be happy to study the array patterns on the stone pillars day and night.

Unknowingly, Xia ruofei was immersed in the array patterns on the stone pillars and was completely unaware of everything that was happening outside.

Ling Qingxue, who was standing outside the array of stone pillars, saw Xia ruofei standing in front of a stone pillar in a daze. Sometimes he was deep in thought, sometimes he was excited, sometimes he was frowning, and sometimes he even involuntarily stretched out his fingers and gestured as if he was possessed.

She couldn’t help but worry. However, she knew that she shouldn’t disturb Xia ruofei at this time, so she suppressed her worry and looked around vigilantly to prevent any danger from appearing.

With Xia ruofei’s current state, if anything dangerous happened in the outside world, he would probably not react because he was completely immersed in it.

Xia ruofei’s current state was something that could only be encountered by luck.

Even he himself did not realize that in this process, his array Dao level was advancing by leaps and bounds.

If the array Dao was a huge book, then no one would know how thick it was until it was opened. Even if some people had flipped through a few pages, they could not judge how rich the content of the book was. Only after reading to a certain extent would they have a heartfelt admiration for the vast content of the book.

There was some knowledge that the more one learned, the more one would realize their ignorance.

Knowing that he didn’t know was in itself a kind of improvement in realm.

At this moment, Xia ruofei had already reached such a realm. It was just that he was so engrossed in it that he did not realize it.

Xia ruofei’s reading speed varied, but in general, as his understanding of arrays deepened, his reading speed became faster and faster.

In the beginning, he could meditate in front of a stone pillar for more than ten minutes, or even dozens of minutes. Some of the stone pillars were shorter, but it took at least a few minutes. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

However, as he continued to advance, he could basically see a stone pillar in two or three minutes. Some of the formation patterns on the stone pillars were relatively simple, and he could even understand them with a glance. He immediately stepped forward to the next stone pillar.

Just like that, Xia ruofei advanced faster and faster. When he reached the last few stone pillars, he did not stop at all. He only glanced at them, thought for a moment, and then walked to the next stone pillar.

Even so, it took Xia ruofei more than six hours to finish reading all the array patterns on the stone pillars.

When he finished looking at the formation patterns on the last stone pillar, he seemed to wake up from a dream.

He didn’t even remember how he had passed through the entire stone pillar array to reach this end.

When Xia ruofei turned back to look at the stone pillars, his entire body trembled. He quickly stepped onto the qushuang flying sword and flew back to Ling Qingxue’s side.

“Qingxue, are you alright?” Xia ruofei asked.

“I’m fine! “It’s just a little boring…” Ling Qingxue said.”But you, you’ve been acting like you’ve been possessed for the past six hours. It’s quite scary!”

Xia ruofei touched his nose in embarrassment and said,””l don’t know what happened just now, but 1 was completely immersed in the world of formations and couldn’t sense anything outside…”

When Xia ruofei returned to her senses, she could check the mission time on her perception mirror and the mission bar’s countdown timer. With a glance, she knew that there were more than three hours left. When he realized that he had been researching for six hours, the first thing he thought of was whether Ling Qingxue was in danger.

Although the dangers they had encountered so far had all come from the star Fern thorn that could not move on its own, no one dared to guarantee that there were no other dangers.

If anything happened to Ling Qingxue in these six hours, Xia ruofei would blame himself to death.

Seeing Ling Qingxue standing outside the stone pillar array safe and sound, Xia ruofei finally let out a long sigh of relief.

Ling Qingxue looked at Xia ruofei and asked,””Ruofei, how’s your research going?”

“I can only say… There’s a slight lead!” Xia ruofei said,”Qingxue, I’ll go in and continue!”

“You haven’t rested for such a long time, you should sit down and rest for a while!” Ling Qingxue said hurriedly.

“It’s okay, I’m not tired!”Xia ruofei grinned.

Ling Qingxue also knew that every second was precious, and Xia ruofei looked very energetic. She said helplessly,””Alright then! If you’re tired, you can stop and rest for a while. Don’t work too hard!”

“I know!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

When Xia ruofei stepped into the stone pillar array again, he felt completely different from the last time.

Although there were no changes to the stone pillar array, Xia ruofei could see that there were invisible lines connecting the stone pillars together. From this perspective, the stone pillar array was actually a whole.

Although Xia ruofei was far from understanding the entire formation, he had already understood most of the formation patterns. When he observed the stone pillars again, he saw colorful lines that connected the stone pillars together in a complicated way.

Those colorful lines were naturally formed by the array patterns.

Xia ruofei started to deduce the array in his mind. The stone pillar array became even more unpredictable to him.

The array formed by the stone pillars and array patterns could be combined in many ways. Each combination was equivalent to a version. What Xia ruofei had to do now was to find all the versions and make an evaluation.

As for the grooves that were exactly the same size as the star Fern thorn soul essence, Xia ruofei was trying his best to find their pattern.

Besides having the same shape, these grooves were not evenly distributed.

Xia ruofei did not understand the use of the star Fern thorn soul essence, so he could only make a reasonable guess about the soul essence that could be placed in the groove.

He had never seen the star Fern soul essence before, so he naturally didn’t know the characteristics of this soul essence. Thus, he could only make a rough and logical judgment.

With Xia ruofei’s array skills, he felt that there were only two functions of the star Fern soul essence in the entire array. The first possibility was that it could be used as an ordinary wire to connect the array patterns. The second possibility was that after the star Fern thorn soul essence was embedded in the groove, it became a source of energy and played a role similar to spirit crystals and origin crystals.

Hence, when Xia ruofei was analyzing the formation, he had to consider both possibilities. This way, the possibility of the formation was even higher.

Xia ruofei stood at the center of the stone pillar array and quickly calculated in his mind. He brought in all kinds of possibilities and analyzed them. Then, he tried to deduce what kind of changes would happen to the array if a certain groove was placed with the star Fern thorn soul essence.

The process was naturally very boring, but Xia ruofei enjoyed it.

The first thing he could be sure of was that the star Fern thorn soul essence didn’t only act as a link. It probably provided energy to the array like an origin crystal.

On this basis, he began to analyze step by step where he should add the star Fern soul essence and how to maximize the array’s efficiency..
