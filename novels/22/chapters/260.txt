Chapter 261: The giant hornet’s nest (1)

Xia ruofei was shocked to see that next to the iron – skinned Dendrobium, there was a Crooked Tree that was almost parallel to it. On the branch of the tree, there was a huge hornet’s nest, and a few hornet’s nest were coming in and out ... The hornet’s nest had a diameter of 20 to 30 centimeters and a length of nearly one meter. Xia ruofei could not help but feel a chill in his heart when he looked at it. The Wasp’s poison was very toxic. After the Wasp’s poison invaded the human body, there would be symptoms of muscle dissolution. In serious cases, it could cause kidney failure, and even heart function and respiratory system multiple organ failure. There were often news reports of people dying after being stung by Hornets. Some people died after being stung in 40,50, or even 20,30 places. The hornet’s nest was so huge that there were at least 1000 to 2000 hornet’s nest. If he accidentally attracted a hornet’s nest to attack him, Xia ruofei might not be able to use the petals in time even if he had the exotic flower. It was impossible to see the situation here from the top of the cliff. Just now, on the other side of the pool, due to the cover of the leaves and Xia ruofei’s focus on identifying the iron – skinned Dendrobium, he did not notice the hornet’s nest. Now that the rope had descended to this position, it was equivalent to hanging in the air. Xia ruofei didn’t even dare to breathe as he was afraid of alarming the Hornet inside. He carefully observed for a while, then gently stepped on the cliff with his feet and grabbed the rope with his other hand. He was ready to quietly climb up before he was exposed. Hanging in the air was equivalent to a live target. No matter how agile he was, it was impossible to escape the hornet’s attack. Xia ruofei was already very careful, but he still had to make some noise. Soon, his windbreaker accidentally brushed against a small branch beside him, and it immediately made a rustling sound. A few Hornets turned around and flew towards Xia ruofei. He had been discovered! At that moment, Xia ruofei’s hair stood on end. Years of living on the edge of a blade and licking blood had given him a keen sense of danger. There was no sky or ground here, and it was very likely that the Hornet nest would come out in full force in the next moment. Faced with thousands or even thousands of Hornets, Xia ruofei couldn’t use the petals in time even if he had the ability to. Even though he had outstanding martial arts, Xia ruofei had no way of defending himself against the hornet’s attacks. As long as a tiny bit of poison from each Hornet entered Xia ruofei’s body, 1000 to 2000 hornet’s would be enough to kill him instantly. Xia ruofei’s mind seemed to have entered an ethereal state. The more critical the moment was, the calmer he would be. This was also something he had trained in his many years of military life. Within a thousandth of a second, Xia ruofei made a decision that might be the only effective one. Without any hesitation, he summoned the spirit map scroll from his palm. Then, he quickly put the painting in his pocket, grabbed the rope tightly with one hand, and kicked hard with his feet. His whole body swung directly in the direction of the hornet’s nest! The giant hornet’s nest was getting closer and closer. At that moment, everything in front of him seemed to be in slow motion like in a movie. Xia ruofei could clearly see the regular holes on the hive that was constantly enlarging in his eyes, and the terrifying Hornet inside. Xia ruofei’s mind was extremely calm, and his eyes were filled with determination. In an instant, Xia ruofei used the momentum and rushed to the hornet’s nest. He gritted his teeth, reached out, and grabbed the top of the hornet’s nest. Then, he pulled it down ... Buzzzzzz! This was really poking the hornet’s nest! Xia ruofei could hear the buzzing sound in his ear. Under normal circumstances, there would be one or two thousand Hornets coming out of their nest and Xia ruofei would be killed in a very short time. However, just as the hornet’s nest was about to leave, the entire nest suddenly disappeared into thin air, along with most of the hornet’s nest that didn’t manage to come out in time. Yes, this was the solution that Xia ruofei had thought of in an instant. He knew that he had nowhere to hide after being discovered by the Hornet. The only way to escape was to take the risk and store the entire hornet’s nest into the space. The entire process had to be decisive and precise. If Xia ruofei hesitated, the hornet’s nest would have already swarmed out. By then, it would be useless even if he kept the hive in the medium. Besides, Xia ruofei had to succeed on the first try because there was no chance of a second try. Using the rope to swing over, pull down the Beehive, and collect it, there was only one chance for the entire process, and there was no room for a repeat. Fortunately, Xia ruofei had been in the lone wolf commando unit for seven years. His mental strength was strong, and his physical condition was even better. He was the best Special Forces soldier. In addition, he had absorbed so many strange flower petals. Even he himself could not directly see how strong his physical condition had become. That was why Xia ruofei was able to make a decision in an instant and succeed in one try under extremely difficult circumstances, resolving a life and death crisis. After the giant hornet’s nest was kept into the dimension, there were about 20 to 30 hornet’s nest that managed to escape. Xia ruofei didn’t dare to let his guard down. If he didn’t deal with them carefully, these twenty to thirty Hornets could still kill him. As Xia ruofei kept the giant hornet’s nest into the spirit map space, he immediately pulled out the military dagger that had been with him for many years. Now, Xia ruofei’s reaction speed and skills were far better than when he was serving in the lone wolf commando unit. He held the rope tightly in one hand and waved the dagger in the other. In the cold light of the blade, the Hornets were cut in half and fell into the pool below. However, the hornet’s flight speed was very fast and its trajectory was erratic. In a short while, 20 to 30 hornet’s rushed up so Xia ruofei was inevitably stung twice. The location of the sting was on the arm that was holding the rope because there was no way to avoid it. The wound quickly swelled up, and the pain and numbness were instantly transmitted to his brain through his nerves. After confirming that he had dealt with all the hornet’s nest, Xia ruofei had an idea. He took out a porcelain bottle from the spirit map space and poured some of the flower petal solution on the wound. He felt a cooling sensation, and the swelling in the red and swollen area quickly subsided at a speed visible to the naked eye. Xia ruofei only heaved a sigh of relief after he kept the petal solution and the painting in his palm. He realized that he was already drenched in cold sweat. It was too dangerous just now! If he had reacted a second slower and the hornet’s nest had burst out, not even the gods would have been able to save him. Now that the giant hornet’s nest was in the spirit map space, Xia ruofei didn’t care about it for the time being. When Jian Jia was collecting the hornet’s nest, Xia ruofei was worried that the six puppies in the new space would be hurt by the hornet’s nest, so he kept the hornet’s nest in the original space. As for how to deal with the hornet’s nest in the original space, that was the next step to consider. Xia ruofei then quickly gathered the iron – Skin Dendrobium together with its roots. Then, he continued to descend and dug out all the iron – Skin dendrobes in other places. There were a total of six stalks, all of which were pure wild iron – Skin dendrobes. Xia ruofei followed the rope and climbed up the rock wall. Then, he returned to the pool. He packed all the iron – skinned dendrobes in his hiking bag into plastic bags and stored them in the spirit map space. Then, with the handheld GPS in hand, he continued to set off along the predetermined route. Since he was already here, he naturally wanted to find as many Dendrobium candids as possible. This way, when he carried out his cutting planting in the spirit map space in the future, he could create a larger scale in one go. As for the giant hornet’s nest, he would have to deal with it after he returned to the three mountains.Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m
