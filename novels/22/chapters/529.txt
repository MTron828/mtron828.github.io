Chapter 530: Raising the prestige of our country (2)

Hence, Xia ruofei was not too surprised.

“Uncle Carter, thank you for your hospitality. We’ll be leaving now ...” Xia ruofei said loudly.

“Xia, wait ...” Carter quickly called out.

Xia ruofei did not know what was going on, but he still stopped in his tracks. He saw Carter run back and quickly come out with three bottles of wine.

He smiled and passed the wine to Xia ruofei.””Xia, this is a twenty – year – old Semillon. It’s my gift to you!”

“This is too precious! Thank you!” Xia ruofei said happily,”uncle Carter, I’m so lucky to be your neighbor!”

“Xia, you’re welcome to come to my winery for wine tasting in the future!” Carter laughed heartily.

“Definitely, definitely ...”

After bidding farewell to uncle Carter, Xia ruofei and the other two went to the parking lot outside the winery to get their cars and headed straight for Paradise Farm.

Liang Qichao was driving while Xia ruofei and Monica sat in the back of the convertible off – Road vehicle. Monica’s long golden hair fluttered in the wind and brushed past Xia ruofei’s face from time to time. It felt a little itchy, and Xia ruofei’s heart could not help but start to stir.

After arriving at the farm, Monica took a car to visit.

She was full of praise for the unique environment of Paradise Farm. When they were at the winery, Monica thought that Xia ruofei’s farm would not be very big. After all, the farms in Hunter Valley were very expensive. Her impression of Xia ruofei was still that of the owner of a small company in China a few months ago. In the end, she only found out that Paradise Farm was actually so vast after visiting it.

A farm like this would cost at least tens of millions of dollars, right? Monica couldn’t help but estimate the value in her heart.

Although tens of millions of us dollars was nothing to the Grao family, Xia ruofei was just the boss of an unknown small company in China a few months ago! This step was too big!

After driving Monica around for a tour, Liang Qichao made up an excuse and tactfully said goodbye to the two.

Before he left, he even winked at Xia ruofei with a perverted expression. Xia ruofei used his body to block Monica’s view and gave Liang Qichao the middle finger without hesitation.

After Liang Qichao left, at Monica’s request, Xia ruofei strolled around the farm with her again. They walked around the man – made Lake for a long time until the Golden sunset elongated their shadows by the lake. Then, they returned to the small villa.

Liang Qichao had sent a message to Xia ruofei a long time ago. He had found an empty room in the workers ‘dormitory next door and left the entire villa to Xia ruofei.

Although Xia ruofei immediately sent Liang Qichao a disdainful emoji, he still had a little anticipation in his heart.

Any normal man who saw a sexy woman like Monica would not be able to help but be moved.

Furthermore, Monica had clearly expressed that she wanted to stay at the farm for the night. Yingying was originally staying at a Resort Hotel 20 kilometers away from here.

Xia ruofei used the ingredients on the spot and made a Chinese and Western dinner with Monica.

There were Kung Pao Chicken, green pepper shredded meat, French foie gras, and fried steak. Although they looked a little nondescript, the two of them ate with relish.

Moreover, the two of them chatted as they ate, and they got along very well. There was no sense of unfamiliarity at all because they had not contacted each other for a few months.

The two of them had completely different backgrounds, but they could still find a lot to talk about. This was indeed a miracle.

Especially when Xia ruofei talked about some interesting things from her childhood, Monica would often be amused until she giggled. Compared to Xia ruofei’s grassroots experience, Monica’s childhood was much more boring. She had received all kinds of elite education since she was young. Although she had cultivated a beautiful woman with both looks and temperament, the price was that she had sacrificed her good childhood.

The sky was already dark by the time they finished their meal.

They cleaned up the dining table together and then sat in the living room to chat for a long time.

Xia ruofei was in disbelief that he could have so many things to talk about with an Italy beauty.

Xia ruofei even felt that his spoken English had improved a lot today because he had said too much today.

At 10 pm, Xia ruofei saw that Monica looked tired. He said with a hint of reluctance,””Monica, it’s getting late. Go back to your room and rest! The guest room has been prepared. ” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Monica smiled sweetly and said,”okay!” Xia, you’re flying tomorrow, so you should rest early today. ”

The two of them went upstairs together. Xia ruofei sent Monica to the guest room and opened the door for her. Then, he said,””Good night, Monica!”

“Good night!” Monica glanced at Xia ruofei flirtatiously and revealed a charming smile. Then, she walked into the room.

The moment Monica closed the door, Xia ruofei felt a sense of loss.

However, he quickly adjusted his mood and kept telling himself that he had a girlfriend now. Although he was away, he had to control himself ...

Xia ruofei mumbled to himself as he walked back to his room.

Xia ruofei did not feel sleepy after he returned to his room. He turned on the television and absent – mindedly changed the channels with the remote control.

After an unknown period of time, there was a sudden knock on the door.
