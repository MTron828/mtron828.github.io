2347 Healing_Even though Xia ruofei had intentionally delayed the treatment process, he was still very serious during the examination.

Xia ruofei strictly followed the procedure of looking, listening, asking, and feeling. He used Traditional Chinese Medicine methods to check on old man Liu. At the same time, in the process of feeling the pulse, he also used his spiritual power to observe the condition of the tumor.

The results of the examination were similar to what he had expected. Overall, the patient’s condition had improved. The specific signs were that the tumor no longer spread, and the tumor in the main tumor area had a slight trend of shrinking. It could be said that the patient’s condition was basically developing according to his imagination.

This also explained why old man Liu looked so much better than before. His cancer cells were suppressed, and they were much less active than before. They couldn’t spread any further, so he was naturally in good spirits.

When Xia ruofei pulled his hand back and opened his eyes, Liu Qunfeng, who was beside him, asked impatiently,”Mr. Xia, how’s my father?”

“It’s not bad,” Xia ruofei said indifferently.”You can even say ... It’s better than what I expected.”

Xia ruofei turned to look at Liu Qunfeng and smiled.””If I’m not wrong, the tumor in Mr. Liu’s body has stopped spreading, and the tumor in his pancreas has shrunk a little, right, chief Liu?”

“Mr. Xia, your judgment is very accurate!” Liu Qunfeng nodded.

During the time that Xia ruofei was not in the capital, the Liu family had followed Xia ruofei’s instructions strictly and gave elder Liu the pills on time. Naturally, they could not be completely at ease, so they had two more comprehensive examinations during this period.

The results were basically the same as what Xia ruofei had described.

He could make such an accurate judgment through Chinese Medicine’s look, listen, ask, and touch. The results were the same as the results of the examination with sophisticated medical instruments. Many Chinese medicine doctors in the country could only look up to him with this skill.

“That’s not strange at all,” elder Liu said with a smile.”If Xiao Xia can’t even do such a test, how would he dare to take over a patient like me who’s beyond cure?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”elder Liu, although your illness is serious, it’s not incurable. Isn’t the treatment going in a good direction now?” Therefore, it’s impossible to say that he’s beyond cure. ”

“Yeah!” Liu Qunfeng chimed in. Dad! Mr. Xia is right, you can’t say such inauspicious words. ”

Old man Liu laughed indifferently and said,””Why are you guys even more superstitious than me? I’ve lived for so long, and I’ve been through mountains of corpses and seas of blood during the war years, so why would I care about this? Besides, I’m a pure materialist! I don’t believe in those things!”

Liu Qunfeng couldn’t help but smile bitterly.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”elder Liu, it seems that my treatment direction is correct, so there’s no need to make too many adjustments to the entire treatment plan.” Since the medicine I’ve prescribed is the right one, then continue to take it. ”

“Alright!” Old man Liu nodded with a smile. You’ll be in charge of the treatment. ”

“Also, I’ll perform acupuncture on you again today.” Xia ruofei nodded. However, I need to explain to you that acupuncture doesn’t have a direct effect on the tumor. Instead, it stimulates the potential of your body, which is more conducive to the absorption of the medicinal properties. From today’s examination, your body’s function is much better than last time. This undoubtedly accelerated the absorption of the medicine, so the number of acupuncture should not be too many. After all, overusing the body’s potential is not a good thing. ”

“I understand!” Old man Liu nodded slightly. Going too far is just as bad as not enough!”

“That’s the logic,”Xia ruofei smiled.

Then, Xia ruofei turned to Liu Qunfeng and said,””Chief Liu, please leave us alone! I’m going to start the treatment for elder Liu. ”

Liu Qunfeng looked at elder Liu, who pouted at him angrily. He nodded slightly and left the room.

After Liu Qunfeng left, Xia ruofei asked old man Liu to take off his shirt and lie on the bed. Then, he took out a silver needle from the small medicine box that he carried with him. After carefully disinfecting it, he began to perform acupuncture on old man Liu.

He was still using the nine needles of the moyun technique.

A few days ago, he had copied down the first volume of <three cloud rubbing volumes> and passed it to Ge Jun. During this process, he had gained a deeper understanding of this treasured medical book in the field of traditional Chinese medicine. In addition, he had used the nine cloud rubbing needles more often during this period of time, so his proficiency level had obviously increased.

Xia ruofei’s needles were like flying. There was no hesitation at all. In the blink of an eye, he had accurately pierced the eight silver needles into the corresponding acupuncture points.

Then, he followed the steps of the nine cloud rubbing needles, either flicking, twisting, or lifting ... At the same time, wisps of mild true Qi were injected into old man Liu’s meridians during the acupuncture process. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Old man Liu felt that the acupuncture point was slightly sore and swollen. At the same time, he could clearly feel a warm current flowing slowly through his body. He was so comfortable that he almost moaned.

Xia ruofei was focused on the acupuncture while old man Liu had his eyes closed and was enjoying the process.

Time quietly passed.

When Xia ruofei used the special technique of the nine cloud contact needles to retrieve all eight silver needles, old man Liu seemed to have woken up from a dream. He asked,””It’s over?”

Xia ruofei nodded with a smile.”Mr. Liu, your body is still relatively weak. It’s better not to spend too much time on acupuncture.”

“Understood!” Old man Liu laughed. Understood! Going too far is just as bad as not enough!”

“Yes, the principle is the same.” Xia ruofei said as he disinfected the silver needle and nodded at elder Liu.

Old man Liu said with emotion,”our ancestors have passed down good things!” Just like acupuncture, Western medicine would never be able to have such a magical effect. Xiao Xia, after the acupuncture, I immediately feel much more energetic! I don’t think I’ll have a problem even if you ask me to jog a few laps!”

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”it’s nothing special. Acupuncture is like a trigger that stimulates the potential in your body.” China’s TCM is broad and profound, but it’s a pity that its heritage is incomplete. In addition, with the deliberate guidance of the Western public opinion, it has led to many people misunderstanding TCM. ”

Old man Liu said thoughtfully,””I think the country should also increase support for Chinese medicine and related industries!”

After all, he had been a leader before, so he naturally got inspired by this matter and expanded it to the national level.

Xia ruofei only nodded in agreement and did not continue the conversation.

After all, this was not something that could be done with just a few words. If they really wanted to promote and support Chinese medicine, there would be many practical problems that needed to be solved.

For example, the quality of Chinese medicine practitioners was uneven, the standards and regulations of the Chinese medicine industry were unclear, and so on.

In fact, why were there so many voices of support for some prejudices about Chinese medicine in society? A large part of it was because of the existence of some quacks who smeared Chinese medicine and caused the patients to lose confidence.

After Xia ruofei finished the acupuncture for elder Liu, he took out two small porcelain bottles. Inside the bottles were enough pills for elder Liu to take for a month.

He had asked Xia Qing to prepare it in the space yesterday.

The main ingredient of these pills was actually honey. In addition, there were a few other Chinese medicine ingredients, which also had the effect of conditioning the body.

What really played a role was naturally the evenly stirred spirit Heart Flower petal solution.

After leaving behind the porcelain bottle filled with pills, Xia ruofei tactfully declined old man Liu’s invitation to stay for dinner and directly bade him farewell.

Wu Qiang did not leave after dropping Xia ruofei off here. After Xia ruofei was done with the documents, he took the Toyota Elfa business car back to the siheyuan.

Liu Qunfeng personally sent Xia ruofei to the car in the courtyard downstairs. After watching the car drive away, he went upstairs to old master Liu’s room.

“Dad!” Liu Qunfeng greeted him with respect.

“He left?” old man Liu nodded.

“Yes, I am!” Liu Qunfeng nodded and said,”he said that you only need to take your medicine on time for the next month. You don’t need any other treatment. He told us to call him immediately if anything happened ... Which means he might not be able to make it in a month. ”

“There’s nothing wrong with that!”Old man Liu said with a smile. He was a doctor, so of course he had the final say in how to treat her! Besides, wasn’t the healing effect quite good now? This shows that his treatment direction is correct. ”

Liu Qunfeng nodded and said,”understood!” Oh right, dad! Do you need me to explain to Xia ruofei about the little obstacles that Li Fang has been causing recently?”

Old man Liu waved his hand and said,””There’s no need for that. Before he left, I had a simple chat with him and tactfully expressed our attitude. I believe that with his wisdom, he should be able to feel the goodwill we are giving out. ”

“Alright then!” Liu Qunfeng said.

“Although Xiao Xia’s side has been pacified for the time being, Liu Lifang can’t be let off easily!” Old master Liu said sternly,”from today onwards, she’s not allowed to interfere with the company’s Affairs! In addition, all her credit cards and savings cards were frozen! Control her pocket money every month!”

“Ah? This ... Isn’t this a little too strict?” Liu Qunfeng hesitated.

“If I don’t be strict, how can she remember?” Old master Liu said,”let’s do this! Just say that I personally gave the order! If she’s not convinced, let her come to me!”

“Understood!” Liu Qunfeng said.

Then, Liu Qunfeng hesitated for a moment, and said with a worried expression,””Dad! Why do I feel that ... Xia ruofei is deliberately delaying it so that you won’t get better so quickly?”

“That’s only human nature!”Old man Liu laughed. I’m not as lucky as old song to have found such a treasure!”

“If elder song had this disease ...” Liu Qunfeng frowned and said,”he might have recovered in a week or two!” This Xia ruofei ...”

“Don’t mention it,” old man Liu waved his hand.”It’s normal for him to do this. I’d do the same if I were him!”

Liu Qunfeng nodded, a little depressed. He then said,””Dad! I still have one more worry ...”
