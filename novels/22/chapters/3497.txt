“Waa! This ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ has a very good taste!” “How did you make the Buddha Jumps Over the Wall soup in such a short time?” Song Wei asked in surprise.

Ling Qingxue smiled and said,”do you even need to ask?” This guy must be using a time formation! If other cultivators were to find out that he’s using such a good array to cook, they’d definitely be heartbroken!”

If other cultivators had time array flags, they would definitely use it to build a time array for cultivation, not to mention that arrays also consumed spirit stones. Who would be willing to use an array to cook?

Of course, the spiritual stones consumed by the time formation were nothing to Xia ruofei. It was like a drop in the ocean.

Xia ruofei chuckled,”aren’t formations invented to serve cultivators?” As for whether it was used for cultivation, killing enemies, or cooking, what did it matter? As long as it works, the value of this formation will be realized, right?” “You’re spouting nonsense!” Ling Qingxue pouted and said,”but you’re still worthy of praise for preparing lunch so diligently!”

“I’m just worried that the two of you consumed too much energy last night and didn’t eat breakfast, so 1 thought 1 could give you some supplements.” Xia ruofei chuckled.”By the way, 1 specially used the best black – bone chicken for the ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’. You guys can eat more to nourish your bodies…”

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue’s faces heated up. They glared at Xia ruofei at the same time. Ling Qingxue, who had a shrewder personality, did not want to be outdone.”! think you just want to nourish yourself! If we’re talking about consumption … It seems that you’ve consumed more! By the way, you should eat more of these quail eggs to replenish your protein!”

Song Wei’s face was red, but she could not help but laugh. She was too embarrassed to open her eyes to look at Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei was also dumbfounded.”! was the one driving just now. How did you take the steering wheel and step on the gas all the way?”

Old driver Xia couldn’t take it anymore and quickly got up to get rice for everyone.

After lunch, the three of them cleaned up the dining table and washed the bowls and chopsticks. Then, they sat in the living room and made a bag of Dahongpao tea. They chatted while making tea. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Xia ruofei took a sip of tea and said,””Weiwei, Qingxue, if you have nothing to do these days, stay on the Peach Blossom Island and cultivate. Try to break through to the seventh Qi layer in one go!”

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue both nodded in agreement.

Xia ruofei thought for a while, then looked at Ling Qingxue and asked,””Qingxue, you haven’t been home for more than two months. Is everything alright with the company?”

Ling Qingxue replied in a relaxed manner,”I’m fine!” My dad is personally keeping an eye on it! In fact, it doesn’t matter if I’m around or not, but he used to be particularly persistent in training me to be his successor. All he wanted to do was to retire early and have fun all over the world. But in the past one or two years, his views have changed a lot.”

In the past, Ling Xiaotian had spared no effort in nurturing Ling Qingxue, hoping to hand over the company to Ling Qingxue as soon as possible so that he could enjoy his retirement life earlier.

Later, Ling Qingxue expressed her unwillingness to be trapped in the family business, and Ling Xiaotian slowly accepted it. He began to lean towards looking for a more reliable professional manager.

In addition, although Ling Xiaotian had never been in contact with cultivation, as Xia ruofei’s future father – in – Law, Xia ruofei would naturally not ignore him.

The next day, Xia ruofei, Song Wei, and Ling Qingxue, the three cultivators, slept in for the first time. The sun was high in the sky, and they were still asleep.

In fact, when the three of them went to bed last night, it was already three or fouro’ clock in the morning. They had not been together for more than two months, and they were all cultivators. In terms of physical strength, they were beyond ordinary people. The degree of absurdity was naturally higher than that of ordinary people.

Although Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue had been together for the past two months, they could not have any intimate activities due to the environment. Not to mention the small spacecraft assembly, even in the trial Pagoda, Xia ruofei always had a faint feeling that someone was spying on him all the time. At that time, he was in a state of high tension, so naturally, he could not have any intimate actions with Ling Qingxue.

The three of them were at the age where they were the most energetic, and they had been holding back for more than two months. It was not as simple as a absence makes the heart grow fonder, it was simply like Mars crashing into earth. If Xia ruofei had not set up a high – Level sound – proof Ward in his bedroom, perhaps even Luo Qingfeng, who was in closed – door cultivation, and Li Yifu, who was trying hard to consolidate his cultivation, would have been forced to listen to the live broadcast.

In the morning, the room was very quiet, and the sound of the waves in the distance could be faintly heard. The sun shone through the floor – to – Ceiling glass window on the bed, and the three of them felt very lazy. Although they had woken up, they didn’t even want to move a finger and just wanted to lay lazily on the bed.

After receiving the purple origin crystals the day before, Luo Qingfeng had started to cultivate in seclusion. He wanted to break through to the intermediate stage of the Golden core realm in one go.

Although his cultivation was still a distance away from the intermediate stage of the Golden core realm, the absorption and transformation efficiency of a purple Yuan crystal was much higher than that of ordinary Yuan crystals. Moreover, the energy contained in it was tens or even hundreds of times that of Yuan crystals. Even if this purple Yuan crystal could not completely support him to break through to the intermediate stage of the Golden core realm, it was not far from it. In addition, after the Luo Tian formation started operating, cultivating in this building was simply blessed by the heavens, like a tiger with wings. Therefore, he didn’t want to waste a single second.

Although Li Yifu didn’t go into closed – door cultivation and only cultivated for a whole night to completely consolidate his rapidly rising cultivation, he was a shrewd man. He naturally knew that his great – uncle and two great – grandmasters had reunited after a long time and needed enough private space. Therefore, he would never be stupid enough to come out and disturb them at this time.

The three of them stayed in bed for another hour until the sun was high in the sky. Finally, Xia ruofei got up helplessly to prepare lunch under the urging of Song Wei and Ling Qingxue.

That’s right, he was going to prepare lunch right away because it was almost noon.

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue didn’t stay in bed for long. In fact, it was rare for the three of them to sleep together. After Xia ruofei got up, the two of them were more or less shy, so they quickly hid under the blanket and put on their clothes. Then, they quickly went to wash up and make up.

Xia ruofei quickly prepared a sumptuous lunch. Song Wei and Ling Qingxue had also finished washing up and were watching TV in the living room.

Peach Blossom Island naturally didn’t have domestic cable TV signals, but they directly installed professional satellite reception equipment on the roof. In fact, they could receive more channels than in China, and there were no restrictions. Their English was quite good, so they quickly found an English TV station that was broadcasting a music variety talent show and watched it with great interest.

After Xia ruofei had prepared lunch, he used his spiritual power to find Li Yifu’s room and said,””Foster husband, come to my room and have lunch together!” Peach Blossom Island naturally didn’t have domestic cable TV signals, but they directly installed professional satellite reception equipment on the roof.
