Xia ruofei laughed and said,”time is tight, right?” How can the missions in the trial Pagoda be easy?”

Seeing Xia ruofei’s unhurried manner, Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but say anxiously,””What is the mission? Hurry up and tell me! Don’t be like the previous mission, wasting time at the beginning and causing danger!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.’T was just teasing you! The details of the mission have not been released, but there are clear instructions. We just have to follow them!”

Then, Xia ruofei briefly repeated the content of the prompt in the perceptual mirror to Ling Qingxue.

After Ling Qingxue heard this, she heaved a sigh of relief. Then, she playfully hit Xia ruofei and said,””You’re still joking at a time like this! Even if the mission hasn’t officially started, we’d better hurry over! Who knows, maybe there’s something else!”

“What you said makes sense!” Xia ruofei said,”let’s pack up and set off immediately!”

Xia ruofei kept the fire attack formation and said to Ling Qingxue,””Go! Let’s see what the last part of the mission is!”

He took Ling Qingxue with him and rode on the flying sword, following the direction of the arrow in the field of vision of the perceptual mirror.

In the vast wilderness of the trial Pagoda’s fifth level, Xia ruofei naturally could not follow the arrow’s directions in a straight line. He would definitely encounter star Fern thorns blocking his way.

Therefore, they had to take a longer route.

Xia ruofei was not idle along the way. Every time he encountered a star Fern thorn, he would spend a few seconds to identify it. This was a basic operation that he had been doing for more than eight hours and had become a habit.

Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue had been flying on their flying swords for more than 50 minutes. They would encounter a star Fern thorn every few minutes. Of course, as the stock of special star Fern thorns was relatively small, Xia ruofei had only encountered ordinary star Fern thorns along the way.

They had been on the road for nearly an hour, and the spot of light shown on the perceptual mirror map was getting closer and closer. It was estimated that they would definitely arrive in half an hour.

Xia ruofei continued to maintain a relatively constant speed as he flew in the direction of the arrow.

There was another star Fern thorn in front.

Xia ruofei glanced at it out of habit. Just as he was about to go around it and continue moving forward, his movements slowed down and his eyes became a little dazed.

“What’s wrong?” Ling Qingxue asked curiously.

“Another one?” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but mumble to himself,”why wasn’t it so easy to find it when we were doing the mission just now?”

The star Fern thorn in front of them had black spikes and a darker color at the root.

Clearly, this was a special star Fern thorn.

Based on his previous experience, this star Fern thorn had a high chance of dropping a soul essence.

Even though Xia ruofei could find a special star Fern thorn every hour or so when he was on a mission, that was when he was giving it his all. Besides, he was trying to identify as many star Fern thorns as possible based on the principle of being close to the target. Although he had spent about an hour just now, Xia ruofei was mainly rushing. Only when there were star Fern thorns along the route would he identify them before taking a detour.

It could be said that in both situations, the number of star Fern thorns that Xia ruofei had identified in the same amount of time was at least ten times more.

Therefore, the appearance of this special star Fern thorn was definitely a low probability event.

“This star Fern thorn can also drop soul essence?” Ling Qingxue asked curiously.

“En!” Xia ruofei nodded and said,”since we’ve met, let’s not be polite! Just take it!”

With that, Xia ruofei took out the materials for a small fire array and set it up with a wave of his hand.

Immediately after, he threw out another origin crystal and cast a spell to activate the array.

Although the star Fern thorn soul essence was only a mission item and could not be stored in the spirit map space, Xia ruofei knew that it was definitely a good item. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Moreover, the rarer an item was, the more valuable it would be. Since he had encountered such a rare star Fern thorn soul essence, he would definitely not miss it.

Even if he couldn’t bring it out of the trial Pagoda, Xia ruofei was willing to keep it.

Besides that, Xia ruofei had more or less figured out some tricks. The chain missions on the trial Pagoda’s fifth level should be related. For example, the first round’s mission was to solve the star Fern thorn ring. The second part of the mission was to collect the star Fern thorn soul essence, which was related to the star Fern thorn.

Now, Xia ruofei was about to complete the third part of the mission. This mission was probably related to the star Fern thorn. Perhaps the star Fern thorn soul essence would play an important role. Therefore, he had to prepare one more star Fern thorn soul essence. Who knew when it would come in handy!

After the flame array was activated, the special star Fern thorn immediately burst out with an extremely powerful and crazy attack, just like every other special star Fern thorn that had been burned to ashes.

However, it was destined to be a futile effort. Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue stood there quietly, silently watching the star Fern thorn burn to ashes.

The formation stopped, and the flames were extinguished.

Xia ruofei swept the ashes away and saw a familiar star Fern thorn soul essence lying quietly on the ground.

Xia ruofei smiled and reached out his hand to grab the air. He immediately took the star Fern thorn soul essence into his hand..
