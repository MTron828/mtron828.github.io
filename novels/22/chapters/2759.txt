These veterans were all wearing army green spring and autumn clothes, but they didn’t have epaulets, caps, or military symbols.

As they marched forward, they shouted out loud slogans.

For a moment, Xia ruofei was in a daze, as if he had returned to the military camp.

Deng Yujun and Lei Hu’s reaction was similar to Xia ruofei ‘S. Lei Hu, who had regained his senses, slowly stopped the car by the side. Xia ruofei and Deng Yujun quickly pushed the door open and got out of the car.

Ma Jia saw Xia ruofei at first glance. He immediately blew the whistle and said loudly,””Stop! Rest for ten minutes!”

Then, Ma Jia quickly walked towards Xia ruofei and said happily,””RUO Fei, I heard that you’re coming back soon, but I didn’t expect you to be back so soon! Eh? Deng Yujun? You’re finally here!”

Deng Yujun subconsciously saluted Ma Jia at attention and called out,”Captain! Deng Yujun reporting for duty!”

Ma Jia forced a smile and said,””I’m no longer a company commander. Now, we have to listen to director Xia’s orders!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”who said so?” You will always be our company commander! Yujun, don’t you think?”

Deng Yujun was also a quick – witted soldier. He quickly said,”Yup! That’s right! Anyway, you’re my company commander when I’m discharged from the Army, so I’ll only recognize you as my company commander!”

“You two kids, you were so close when you were in the Army, and now you’re still singing the same tune!” Ma Jia couldn’t help but curse with a smile.

At this time, the retired soldiers who had been dismissed to rest also gathered around.

“Class monitor Xia!”

“RUO Fei!” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Little Xia!”

They all greeted Xia ruofei and addressed him in all sorts of ways. Of course, there were also some veterans who had retired before Xia ruofei joined lone wolf. They were not very familiar with Xia ruofei, but Wolf King Guo Zhan had already introduced him to them before they came, so they naturally knew that Xia ruofei would be the future boss. So they all looked at Xia ruofei curiously from the outside.

Some of the Veterans who greeted Xia ruofei were his former squad leaders, some were of similar age to him, some were discharged in the same year as Xia ruofei, and some were like Deng Yujun, who had less experience than Xia ruofei. Hence, everyone addressed him differently.

The few veterans who had retired in the same year as Xia ruofei had not been doing well these few years.

Some chose to retire. Although the retirement fee was relatively high, the professions and skills they had engaged in in the Army were hardly of use in other places. The retirement fee of hundreds of thousands of Yuan seemed to be a lot, but in fact, they could only last a few years if they were to sit and eat. If their business failed, this money would not even make a splash.

As for those who chose to settle down, their situation was not much better. Many of them were settled in enterprises, and some were settled in work positions in public institutions. The daily life of eating, cooking, and cooking slowly eroded their fighting spirit.

After receiving calls from Wolf King Guo Zhan or company commander ma su, most of the Veterans did not hesitate and chose to accept the invitation. Then, they gathered at the three mountains from all directions.

Some had reported a few days ago, some were still on the way, and there would be more coming over in the next two days.

Xia ruofei was also very happy and shook hands with everyone.

Many of the Veterans who had left the Army earlier than Xia ruofei had not seen him for many years. Some of them had even taken good care of Xia ruofei, the new recruit, back then. Now that they were reunited at the three mountains, everyone was naturally very happy.

Hugs, handshakes, and small talk filled the small square in front of the complex with a happy atmosphere.

After a long while, Ma Jia let everyone resume their training. Some of these veterans had left the Army for many years, but they were still very determined to carry out orders, and their formation was still standard. Perhaps it was because they had not lived in the military for a long time, but their enthusiasm for training was still very high. Soon, they were in full swing again.

Lei Hu brought Deng Yujun to the staff dormitory not far away to place their luggage. This building was still very new. It used to be used for employees ‘lunch breaks, and some of them lived here directly. After the company’s headquarters moved to the city, it was too inconvenient to go to work from here. In addition, the company also provided rent subsidies, so all the employees had moved to the city. Now, almost all the employees had been vacated, which was just right for the Veterans to use.

Xia ruofei followed Ma Jia to the side of the square. Xia ruofei asked,””Captain, why are you here so quickly? I thought it would be a while before you’d be free! Have you already finished the matter of moving the troops?”

“There’s never enough work to be done. After the 1000 – mile shift, there’s still a lot of work to be done at the new base!” However, I’m already a surplus officer, and after arriving at the new base, everyone will be reorganized according to the new order of establishment. The company will also have a new commander, so wouldn’t I be making things difficult for them if I stayed there? In addition, I think you need someone to help you organize the Veterans, so I asked the wolf King to approve a month’s leave in advance! He directly rushed over! It’ll take some time for old Liu and the others to get their leave approved!”

Initially, Guo Zhan had recommended four officers to Xia ruofei. Other than the old company commander ma su, there were the military supplies supervisor Liu mingtian, the security company instructor Wu Jiasong, and the vehicle company deputy commander Zhong Lin.

Ma SU’s situation was indeed a bit awkward. There was already a new company commander in his position, and this company commander who was transferred from the position of staff officer in the organization used to be a platoon commander under him. He was just a surplus officer in the company, but his prestige was so high. How could the new company commander work without restraint? Therefore, it was better for him to be tactful and take the initiative to take a long vacation and go far away, giving the position to the newcomer completely.

As for Liu mingtian and the others, some of them had business needs and couldn’t leave for the time being, while some of them didn’t have people to replace them yet, so they still had to take over their positions as full – time cadres.

However, it wouldn’t take too long. After the troops finished moving, the officers would be adjusted soon. By then, they would be able to take a break and come over.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”that’s good too, old company commander. You’ve helped me a lot!” Otherwise, I’ll be worried about how to settle these old class monitor! I’m completely at ease now that you’re here!”

Xia ruofei then pointed at the old soldiers who were training and said,””Old company commander, why are you starting training so quickly? Aren’t you in too much of a hurry?”

“This is what the Veterans asked for,” ma su laughed and said,”besides, we’re free, so it’s good to find something to do!” Now that the equipment was not in place, they could only do formation training! Even so, everyone was still not thirsty! They’re clamoring to organize an armed off – Road run or something!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.”It seems that although the old class monitor has retired from the Army, their military quality hasn’t dropped much. Each of their formation movements are quite standard! I don’t think they’re too weak in terms of physical fitness!”

“Isn’t that so?” Ma su said,”I’ve been leading soldiers for so many years. I can basically tell the quality of a soldier at a glance! These old soldiers were indeed not bad! With a little training, you can pick up your original profession and do the job of a guard without a problem!”

Xia ruofei looked at the energetic veterans with joy and nodded.””There’s definitely no problem! Our lone Wolf’s soldiers are good wherever they go! It’s the same even if you take off your military uniform!”

“By the way, old company commander, there will be more than 20 people reporting in today. They are not veterans from lone wolf, but they are all from the reconnaissance team, so their military quality should be good!” Xia ruofei said,”I’ll have to trouble you these days, old company commander! I’ll leave all the food, drinks, and sh * t of these dozens of people to you!”

“No problem!” Ma Jia said with a smile. Leading troops is my old profession! I guarantee that you’ll be well organized and there won’t be a single mistake!”
