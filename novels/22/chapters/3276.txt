3277 Caught off guard (2)

No matter what Willow’s considerations were, Xia ruofei would not force them. He was even more willing to split up. After all, both parties could not trust each other completely. If they entered together, they would have to be on guard against the dangers in the mystic realm as well as the other party. After all, money could move people. Moreover, there might be some great opportunities hidden in the mystic realm. As long as the temptation was big enough, it was easy for them to turn against each other.

Hence, Xia ruofei nodded and said,””Alright then! Then we’ll go in first ...”

With that, Xia ruofei turned to Ling Qingxue and said seriously,””Qingxue, after we go in later, no matter what happens, remember to follow me closely. Don’t stray too far from me.”

“I’ll remember that, don’t worry!”Ling Qingxue nodded.

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly. How could he be at ease? Seeing that Shen tianfang and the others had gone in three batches and there was no news at all, he was not confident at all. He even regretted listening to Song Wei and Ling Qingxue and bringing Ling Qingxue along.

If he was alone, he wouldn’t have so many concerns. If there was any danger, he still had the spirit painting scroll as his trump card!

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”if we get separated as soon as we enter, don’t panic. Try to contact each other through radio communication first.” If we’re both in the secret plane, maybe we can use the radio. In short, we must stay together as much as possible. If we are separated, we must find a way to gather at the first moment!”

“Mm! I know!” Ling Qingxue said.

“If we get separated, you must first ensure your own safety!” Xia ruofei said,”you’ve learned how to use the spacesuit, right? This multi – function watch can detect the air quality, oxygen content, and the temperature of the environment. You have to make sure the environment is suitable for survival before you can take off the spacesuit!”

Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but burst out laughing.””Didn’t we already plan for this on the way here? I remember everything, don’t worry! I’m really going to get nervous if you keep nagging ...”

Xia ruofei smiled awkwardly and said,””I was indeed a little too nervous ...”

Willow couldn’t help but laugh and said,””Fellow Daoist Xia, fellow Daoist Ling, the two of you are truly a loving couple!”

Yu Xin ‘er giggled and said,”he fed me dog food on the moon!” It’s fine to eat dog food on earth, but I didn’t expect that I still couldn’t hide even when I’m on the moon!”

Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but blush and rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei, on the other hand, laughed heartlessly.

However, with this interruption, the tense atmosphere from before eased up quite a bit.

Xia ruofei did not look at his watch and said,””It’s almost time, let’s go in!”

“En!” Ling Qingxue nodded, then turned to xiner and said,”xiner, I’ll go in first!”

“Go ahead!” Yu Xin ‘er said with a smile. With fellow Daoist Xia taking care of you, you’ll definitely be fine! We’ll be there soon!”

Ling Qingxue and Yu xiner were about the same age, and their cultivations weren’t that far apart. Yu xiner had only been accepted as the personal disciple of the valley master of the soaring Flower Valley, Liu Mansha, by chance after she had obtained her master’s degree in the secular world. Thus, she had a lot in common with Ling Qingxue. In the past ten days of lonely travel, the relationship between the two of them had also become much closer, and they were already very good friends.

Ling Qingxue nodded and said,”I wish everyone good luck!” We’ll meet again in the mystery realm!”

“Alright!” Yang Liu laughed. I hope everyone can get a great opportunity! See you in the secret realm!”

Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue held hands and waved at Willow and Yu xiner. Then, they turned around and walked into the light screen.

At this moment, Xia ruofei was on full alert and his vital Qi was all over his body. Although he didn’t release his flying sword to be on guard, he was still connected to the spirit map space with a trace of his mind. If there was any danger, he would be able to react at once.

Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue’s bodies entered the light screen.

Xia ruofei only felt that the light screen became very eye – catching. His eyes were almost blinded by white light and he could not see anything.

In addition, he could also feel that he seemed to be bathed in warm sunlight, and his whole body was warm. The spacesuit was supposed to keep the high temperature out, but he could still feel the warmth that seeped into his soul.

Xia ruofei, who was bathed in the white light, did not stop walking. He continued to walk forward for two or three steps before the white light in front of him suddenly disappeared.

There wasn’t the shifting of the stars that he had imagined, nor was there any pulling force. He just walked over lightly.

After the white light disappeared, what appeared in front of Xia ruofei was an emerald green grassland. It was a very comfortable green at first glance. The grassland seemed to have no end, extending to the limit of his vision.

Xia ruofei turned his head slightly and was shocked to see that Ling Qingxue had already disappeared.

When they entered the light curtain Door, Xia ruofei was clearly holding Ling Qingxue’s hand as they walked in. The whole process felt like a few seconds and they had already passed through the white light area. In those few seconds, Xia ruofei did not even notice that Ling Qingxue had disappeared.

The two of them had walked through the door hand in hand. Ling Qingxue had disappeared so mysteriously, yet he had not noticed at all. This was simply too outrageous.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but panic. He quickly called out in the communication channel,””Qingxue! Qingxue! Where are you? Can you hear me?”

Other than the faint sound of electric current, there was dead silence in the communication channel.

“Qingxue! Please answer if you can hear me!” Xia ruofei’s voice was trembling.

Before they came in, Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue had predicted all kinds of situations, including the possibility of them getting separated. Xia ruofei had even specifically told Ling Qingxue a lot of things to pay attention to. However, when things really came to a head, Xia ruofei still felt very flustered for no reason.

Ling Qingxue was only a Qi refining cultivator. Now that she had to face everything in this secret realm alone, the danger level was obvious.

Xia ruofei was filled with regret. He regretted bringing Ling Qingxue to the mystic Luna realm. At that time, Ling Qingxue had insisted on coming along and Song Wei had spoken up for her. Xia ruofei thought that since he had the spirit map space, if there was any danger that he could not deal with, he could just put Ling Qingxue into the spirit map space. Now that Xia ruofei, Ling Qingxue, and Song Wei had established absolute trust, it was not impossible for him to let Ling Qingxue know his biggest secret if necessary. Hence, he felt that his safety should be basically guaranteed.

However, he had never thought that the secret realm was not what he had imagined. The two of them had entered together, but were forcibly separated. All the preparations he had made were useless. Everything that followed would have to be faced by Ling Qingxue alone.

Xia ruofei forced himself to calm down. He kept calling for Ling Qingxue, Chen Xuan, Shen tianfang, and the others in the communication channel.

However, no matter how he called out, no one responded.

Calculating the time, Willow and Yu xiner should have entered the secret realm by now. Xia ruofei turned around and looked around. He realized that he was in the middle of the grassland. There was no white light at all. It was as if he had appeared out of thin air.

In other words, the passage through the light curtain was simply one – way. After entering, if one wanted to leave, it was impossible to return the same way. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

This also explained why no one returned to report the news of Chen Xuan and the others entering the secret realm.

Xia ruofei muttered to himself,”calm down!” Calm down! Qingxue’s storage ring has enough oxygen supply modules, a spare spacesuit, a large amount of food and water, and the cultivation resources I gave her ... If she’s in a similar environment as me, she shouldn’t be in any danger for a while! Qingxue’s so smart, she’ll definitely be able to protect herself ...”
