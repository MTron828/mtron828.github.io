He found a crowbar from the tool room. Under Ling Qingxue’s watchful eyes, he poured true Qi into his hands and easily bent the crowbar 90 degrees. Then, he gently applied some force and restored it to its original shape.

Then, Xia ruofei passed the crowbar to Ling Qingxue and said with a smile,”Actually, you can do it now. It doesn’t require much true energy. The key is your control of true energy.”

“I can too?” Ling Qingxue didn’t take it. Instead, she said in surprise,”this ... Looks like it requires a lot of strength!”

Although she couldn’t be said to be weak in the past, she was still a weak girl after all. Therefore, her brain couldn’t quite wrap itself around it for a while. Just because she had cultivated true Qi in her dantian, she could bend such a thick iron rod at will? She couldn’t believe it herself.

“Of course!” Xia ruofei said,”although he’s only a Qi refining stage cultivator at Level 1, it’s still easy for him to reach a strength that’s several times or even more than ten times that of an ordinary person.”

“You can try it here. I’ll go make breakfast!” Xia ruofei said.

With that, Xia ruofei stuffed the crowbar into Ling Qingxue’s hands and turned to walk into the villa, leaving Ling Qingxue standing there with a confused expression.

She was clearly a beautiful woman, but she was holding a crowbar in her hand. This scene was a little out of place. When she thought about how she still had to try bending the crowbar, Ling Qingxue didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.

Would he become a female t – Rex? Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but let her thoughts run wild.

However, she was still very serious about the task that Xia ruofei had assigned her. After clearing all the messy thoughts from her mind, she really started to practice.

……

When Xia ruofei, who was wearing an apron, walked out of the villa and called Ling Qingxue in for dinner, Ling Qingxue was already able to change the angle of the crowbar at will. It was as if she had obtained an interesting toy. She kept bending the crowbar in her hand, restoring it, and bending it again. She was having a lot of fun.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Qingxue, that’s enough!” I’m just letting you get used to using your true energy, don’t you really break this crowbar!”

Only then did Ling Qingxue come back to her senses. She was really immersed in the use of true Qi just now, but she didn’t expect that her somewhat violent image would be seen by Xia ruofei. Her pretty face turned red and she quickly threw the crowbar to the side.

“Go wash your hands and eat!” Xia ruofei laughed.

The two of them finished their breakfast and were about to head upstairs to catch up on some sleep when Ling Qingxue’s phone rang. She picked it up and glanced at it, saying,””My dad called ...”

“Then quickly answer it!” Xia ruofei said.

Just as he finished his sentence, his own phone rang.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh,” Let’s each take our own calls!”

Ling Qingxue smiled and walked to the side with her phone. Xia ruofei also picked up his phone and walked to the window. He saw the caller ID and saw that it was Li Yifu.

Xia ruofei answered the call and smiled.””Adopted husband, it should be night time over there, right? Why are you calling me at this time?”

Li Yifu was a little nervous and seemed to have a trace of fear as he said,””Senior granduncle, I’m not in the United States right now. I’m at the three mountains. I don’t know when it’s convenient for you, but I want to ... Pay you a visit!”

Xia ruofei frowned and said,””Didn’t I tell you to stay in America? What are you doing in San Shan?” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Li Yifu quickly said,”senior granduncle, I didn’t come back to China specifically. This time, my family’s company has an investment in the three mountains. Because the amount is relatively large, I’m a little worried, so I came to take a look personally!”

In fact, Xia ruofei could see through Li Yifu ‘s’ poor ‘excuse. After jianjia, li Jiuzhou, passed away, Li Yifu was the only cultivator in the family. It could be said that he was the head of the entire family. What investment was so important that he had to personally come and watch?

Moreover, Li Yifu had never been concerned about the family business. He had left the responsibility to a few capable juniors while he focused on his cultivation. Now, he was suddenly so concerned about an investment project because Xia ruofei was at the three mountains.

However, even if he had seen through it, Xia ruofei could not reject him. After all, Li Yifu had come all the way here. Furthermore, Sanshan city was not owned by Xia ruofei’s family. Even if he was Li Yifu’s master, he had no right to ask Li Yifu not to come to Sanshan for work!

As a junior, Li Yifu had come to the three mountains, so it was only natural for him to pay a visit.

Hence, Xia ruofei could only helplessly say,””Since you’re already here, just come over! I’m at Taoyuan farm!”

“Yes!” Li Yifu was overjoyed. Senior granduncle! This disciple will come over now!”

When Xia ruofei finished the call, Ling Qingxue had also finished talking to Ling Xiaotian. She walked over with her phone and said,””Ruofei, my dad asked me when I’m coming home ...”

“It seems like uncle Ling has a lot of resentment towards me!” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.

“He didn’t say you!” Ling Qingxue’s face was slightly red.

“I don’t believe you!” Xia ruofei said,”he probably thinks that I’ve taken his daughter away ... But you’ll have to marry me sooner or later. I’m just letting him get used to it now ...”

“Who said I must marry you?” Ling Qingxue said, embarrassed.
