2429 Intimidating (3)

As for himself, he was only a Qi layer cultivator.

What qualifications do I have to’ work like a horse ‘for a nascent soul senior?

Thinking of this, Liu chengfeng couldn’t help but feel depressed.

Without waiting for Liu chengfeng to speak, Xia ruofei suddenly waved his hand and removed the spatial cage that trapped Liu chengfeng.

Without the support of the space cage, Liu chengfeng fell down involuntarily.

Although he was shocked, at the same time, he was so comfortable that he almost moaned.

There was no other reason. After losing the barrier of the space cage, Liu chengfeng felt the dense spiritual Qi in the space for the first time.

Even without practicing, Liu chengfeng could feel the genuine Qi in his dantian stirring just by taking a deep breath. The refreshing feeling made him feel dizzy, as if he was drunk. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Liu chengfeng had heard of oxygen intoxication and the possibility of getting drunk after drinking too much tea. He had never thought that he would feel drunk because of the rich spiritual Qi.

It could be said that Liu chengfeng had never been to a place with such rich spiritual Qi in his decades of cultivation. He would never have dreamed that there would be such a treasure land.

For a moment, he even forgot that he was falling rapidly.

At this moment, he suddenly felt an invisible force lifting him up. Xia ruofei had appeared beside him without him knowing.

Then, Xia ruofei brought Liu chengfeng along and flew at high speed through the mountain and sea realm of the spirit map space.

Liu chengfeng felt as if he was in a dream. The spiritual Qi in the sky was so dense that it had already turned into mist, and the beautiful mountains and rivers reflected in his eyes. Everything was so harmonious and natural, as if it contained the great Dao of heaven and earth.

Xia ruofei even brought Liu chengfeng and flew past the vicinity of the realm Heart Island.

When Liu chengfeng saw the many rare herbs on the realm Heart Island, he was so shocked that his jaw almost dropped.

His mouth was wide open, allowing the wind to enter, but there was no reaction.

The scene in front of him was too shocking!

After going one round, Xia ruofei brought Liu chengfeng back to the place where he had placed the space cage. With a wave of his hand, he set up a new and secure space cage and threw Liu chengfeng in.

The moment he entered the space cage, Liu chengfeng could not feel any spiritual Qi at all. For a moment, he could not help but feel lost.

Xia ruofei looked at Liu chengfeng with a smile and asked,””What do you think you can do for me? In other words, what do you think you have that’s worth me showing you mercy?”

Liu chengfeng smiled bitterly and said dejectedly,””Senior, junior truly can’t think of what use I have for you.”

With the other party’s cultivation base and the astonishing wealth in this immortal cave, he was indeed not even qualified to serve tea.

If it was a pretty female cultivator, she might be able to be a servant girl, but she ...

Xia ruofei said indifferently,”since I didn’t kill you directly yesterday, I’ll let you live. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have to go through so much trouble.” The heavens care for all living things. Although you’ve offended me, I don’t want to kill you unless it’s necessary. ”

Liu chengfeng suddenly felt like he had found a way out of a desperate situation. He was so excited that he almost shed tears. He quickly knelt on the ground and kowtowed as he said,””Thank you, senior, for showing mercy! Thank you for showing mercy, senior!”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”as for what I want you to do ... I haven’t thought about it yet. However, you’re still a Qi refining cultivator. You’re still stronger than the ordinary people below. Even if you’re just making use of trash, it’s not completely useless.”

Liu chengfeng didn’t feel humiliated at all after hearing this. Instead, he was overjoyed and said,””Thank you, senior! As long as senior gives the order for junior to work with those ordinary people, junior will have no complaints!”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”no need!” You should stay here for a while! When I’ve thought it through, I’ll naturally use you!”

“Yes, junior will obey senior’s orders!” Liu chengfeng’s attitude became even more respectful.

Xia ruofei’s mind moved slightly. The next moment, Liu chengfeng felt strands of vital energy appear in the space cage that imprisoned him. Although it was not as dense as before, it was still stronger than many places on earth.

Liu chengfeng couldn’t help but be overjoyed.

Xia ruofei said indifferently,”this spiritual Qi is only for you to maintain your cultivation. It’s a tree without a source or water. If you absorb it in one go, you won’t have any spiritual Qi to use for a period of time. Don’t blame me then.”

“Yes!” Liu chengfeng quickly replied. This junior understands!”

Then, Xia ruofei moved some food and drinking water from the warehouse in the interspace and threw them into the spatial cage.

Although it was fine for a cultivator to not eat for a few days, without the protection of spiritual energy, it was impossible for a low – Level cultivator in the Qi refining stage to maintain it if they did not eat for a long time.

Xia ruofei said indifferently,”you stay here obediently. I’ll let you out when I think of how to use you.”

“Yes, senior!” Liu chengfeng replied respectfully.

With a thought, Xia ruofei restored the membrane wall of the space cage.

Liu chengfeng’s vision blurred, and he could no longer see the mountains and rivers outside. All he could see was this small confined space and the faint glowing membrane wall.

After Xia ruofei settled Liu chengfeng down, he flashed towards the place where the mercenaries and assassins were held.

He had his own reasons for doing all he could to intimidate Liu chengfeng.

Liu chengfeng didn’t know that he wasn’t like what he had thought. He wasn’t even qualified to serve Xia ruofei tea.

On the contrary, to Xia ruofei, if he could make good use of Liu chengfeng, there would be many benefits.
