“Why are you so worried?” old man Liu laughed. It’s not your style to be so timid!”

“This concerns you, Sir, so I have to be careful ...” Liu Qunfeng said with a bitter smile.

Old man Liu nodded slightly and said,””Then tell me! What are you so worried about?”

Liu Qunfeng looked worried.”Dad, I’ve been worried about one thing these days. That is ... The medicine that Xia ruofei gave you. Will you be dependent on it?”

Old man Liu raised his eyebrows and asked,””You’re saying ... You’re worried that this pill will be like a drug, and you’ll be addicted to it?”

“Yeah!” Liu Qunfeng nodded. After all, he’s on the opposite side of our Liu family, and we have some conflicts in the past. You’re very important to our family. If he uses a drug to control you and threatens our family with it, the consequences will be unimaginable ...”

Elder Liu chuckled and didn’t answer Liu Qunfeng’s question directly. Instead, he asked,””Qunfeng, let’s make a hypothesis first. If your worries become reality, then I’ll be faced with two choices: First, if I reject this medicine, I might lose my life very soon. Second, accepting the drug would result in addiction and even losing oneself. If you were me, what would you choose?”

Liu Qunfeng couldn’t help but smile wryly as he shook his head,”I don’t know ... It’s indeed a difficult choice.”

Old Liu looked at Liu Qunfeng and asked,””Then think about it from your own perspective. What choice do you think I should make?”

Liu Qunfeng furrowed his brows and thought for a while. Suddenly, he felt elder Liu’s thoughtful gaze on him, and he couldn’t help but shiver. He quickly said,”I think he’ll still choose the second option! No matter what the situation is, your life must be the most important! Even if we have to pay a huge price for it, there’s nothing to consider. ”

The corners of elder Liu’s mouth curved up slightly. In fact, Liu Qunfeng’s hesitation was already an answer.

If it was really as he had said, that elder Liu’s life was the number one priority, then what was there to hesitate about?

To put it bluntly, when elder Liu suddenly asked this question, Liu Qunfeng inevitably thought about his family, and even his personal growth and progress, as well as his wealth.

Liu Qunfeng felt like he was sitting on pins and needles under the wise gaze of old man Liu. He knew that his concern and the hesitation he showed when he answered the old man’s questions were actually very inappropriate.

Old Liu looked at Liu Qunfeng, and after a long while, a smile slowly appeared on his face.””Qunfeng, why are you so nervous? I was just asking casually. ”

Old man Liu wasn’t angry. At this age, he had already seen through many things. Even if he was his own son, it was impossible for him to be completely free of selfish thoughts. Moreover, even he himself would prioritize his family’s interests most of the time, which was not a mistake.

Liu Qunfeng smiled awkwardly and said,””Dad! Maybe I’m just worrying for nothing ...”

“You’re worrying for nothing!” Old master Liu said indifferently,”put away those inexplicable worries! Xia ruofei is not that kind of person ...”

“I know, dad!” Liu Qunfeng said, then asked curiously,”dad! Why are you so confident in Xia ruofei?” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Old man Liu chuckled and said,””It’s not that I trust him! This little guy is old song’s man, how can I trust him one hundred percent! However, the probability of what you just said happening is so small that it’s basically negligible. ”

“Oh? Why do you say so?” Liu Qunfeng asked, raising his eyebrows.

“I’ve always taught you that you must always think from the other party’s point of view,”old man Liu said indifferently. It’s the same for this matter. If you try to think from Xia ruofei’s point of view, you’ll know that he wouldn’t do that!”

Old man Liu paused for a moment and continued,””First of all, it can be said that he originally held my life in his hands, holding the power of life and death in his hands. He can control the rhythm and cycle of treatment to keep us in check. That’s enough for him. ”

“That’s the logic. ” Liu Qunfeng said,”but a man’s heart is not content! What if he’s not satisfied with this kind of restraint?”

Old man Liu smiled faintly and said,””I’m a good judge of character. Based on my understanding of Xia ruofei, he’s not the kind of person who’s insatiable. On the contrary, he had always done a good job of controlling his limits. The most important thing is that if he really uses his strong reliance on drugs to control me, then he has undoubtedly crossed the line. Once he crosses this line, many things will go out of control. By then, even if old song wants to protect him, it will be difficult. ”

Liu Qunfeng had a thoughtful look on his face. After a long while, he let out a sigh of relief and said,””Dad! You’re so thoughtful. This ... I was indeed a little worried!”

Just as old man Liu had said, even if Xia ruofei had deliberately delayed the treatment period to achieve the purpose of restraining the Liu family, it was still within the scope of the game rules. However, once he crossed this line and used drugs to control a former leader who had studied under him and was the head of a top family in Huaxia, it would not just be Xia ruofei or the Liu family’s matter. Xia ruofei would be affected by the terrain of all the forces and the government would not allow such a situation to happen.
