In the small hall of the Sanshan Municipal Party Committee. A meeting regarding the change of work style was coming to an end. The members of the four groups of Sanshan city, the main leaders of the various counties (cities) under them, the relevant departments directly under the city, and the Deputy department level and above of the municipal Party and government all attended the meeting. Tian Huilan, a member of the Provincial Party Committee and Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee of Sanshan city, was giving instructions on stage. “Comrades, to forge iron, one needs to be strong themselves. “The leading cadres should earnestly start from their own work, take the lead in promoting good work styles, drive the majority of cadres to change their work styles deeply, overcome the accumulated drawbacks and chronic illnesses of formalism, bureatism, hedonism, and extravagance, and drive the entire atmosphere of the city to change for the better ...” In the back row, Tian Huilan’s Secretary, Xiao Mei, was sitting upright. She had personally written this manuscript, and Tian Huilan had made three changes to it. Xiao Mei was very familiar with every word of the script, and she also knew that Tian Huilan had reached the last big point. Xiao Mei was sorting out Tian Huilan’s schedule in her mind when her phone suddenly vibrated in her bag. Xiao Mei furrowed her brows slightly. She opened her bag and took out her phone, only to find that the screen was dark. She was stunned for a moment, but the buzzing of the phone was still coming. Xiao Mei suddenly realized something and quickly opened her bag to take out another phone. This was Tian Huilan’s phone. She was used to giving her phone to her Secretary for safekeeping before a meeting to ensure that it would not affect the meeting or miss any important calls. Xiao Mei immediately saw that the caller was Xia ruofei. She had an inexplicable feeling that something was wrong. She quickly stood up and gently pushed her chair away. She quietly walked out of the auditorium and quickly picked up the phone. “Hello, Mr. Xia! “Secretary Tian is in a meeting ...” Xiao Mei said. “Oh, it’s chief Xiao!” Xia ruofei frowned slightly and said,”director Xiao, I have an urgent matter to report to Secretary Tian ...” Xiao Mei’s heart suddenly quivered, and she carefully asked,””Mr. Xia, is this about Lingyun hotel? I’ve already spoken to Secretary Lin this afternoon. He said that he’ll understand the situation in detail. If the hardware is up to standard, he’ll add this hotel to the list. ” Xia ruofei said,”chief Xiao, that’s not what I’ve found out. I’m at the headquarters of the lingji F & B group. Not only is the problem with Lingyun hotel not solved, but Ling Ji F & B is also under a series of malicious inspections ...” Xia ruofei listed out the inspections, fines, and other issues that Ling Ji restaurant had faced today. Xiao Mei was shocked and quickly said,””I’m sorry, Mr. Xia ... This ... This might be my mistake. Please wait a moment, I’ll find a way to report to Secretary Tian!” Xia ruofei said,”okay ... Please hurry!” The situation here is a little complicated ...” Xia ruofei was very unhappy at this moment, especially when he had some opinions about Xiao Mei. He was not sure how Xiao Mei was going to handle this matter, but it was obvious that not only did it not work out, but it had also caused more problems. Hence, Xia ruofei’s tone was slightly stiff. “Okay, okay ...” Xiao Yumei quickly said. Xiao Mei hung up the phone in a hurry, her mind in a mess. At this moment, Xiao Mei realized that she might have made a mistake. Lin Wanshui was probably beating around the bush with her at noon, but she actually took his insincere words seriously ... Xiao Mei was filled with regret. However, what made her even more anxious was that the situation had already become so serious. Thinking about Xia ruofei’s position in Secretary Tian’s and elder song’s hearts, Xiao Mei felt a chill run down her spine. However, she couldn’t care less about her fear. The most important thing now was to solve Xia ruofei’s problem. On the stage, Tian Huilan was still giving a speech. This was a meeting on the deployment of mass education activities. Xiao Mei listened carefully and estimated that she would need about ten minutes to finish. It was impossible to report to Tian Huilan directly, but if he waited until she was done, who knew what would happen on Xia ruofei’s side? Xiao Mei was caught in a dilemma. She quickly weighed the various situations in her mind and finally gritted her teeth and made a decision. She quickly tore a page from her notebook, picked up her pen, and started writing, describing today’s events in as short a word as possible. Then, Xiao Mei went to the side of the venue and whispered a few words to the staff. She then handed the folded paper to the staff. Many leaders brought their own teacups for meetings, so they would arrange for people to fill the teacups with water during the meeting. Xiao Mei was the one who had found the staff to fill the teacups for the leaders. After the staff member received the note, she immediately walked up to the stage with a kettle of water. She first came to Tian Huilan’s side and filled her teacup with water. At the same time, she quietly pushed the note onto Tian Huilan’s table, then went to fill up the water for the other leaders. Tian Huilan, who was holding a script in her hand, was slightly taken aback. She knew that there must be an extremely urgent matter for him to hand over a note at this time. So she cleared her throat, reached out for the teacup, and drank the water unhurriedly. Her eyes had already quickly swept over the note. Tian Huilan’s expression changed slightly after she read it, but she quickly returned to normal. She adjusted the microphone and continued to speak. However, Xiao Mei’s sharp senses told her that Tian Huilan didn’t follow the script at all. She had basically just pointed out the key points in the script, so Xiao Mei immediately let out a sigh of relief. Tian Huilan finished her speech in two minutes, which was supposed to last for about ten minutes. The venue burst into a warm round of applause. Just as everyone was waiting for the emcee to announce the end of the meeting, Tian Huilan leaned into the microphone and said,””I’ll mainly talk about changing the work style in today’s meeting. Next, I’ll temporarily arrange an on – site work session. Comrade Cheng Hua from the National Tax bureau, comrade Qian Sanyuan from the local tax bureau, comrade sun Zhijun from the health Bureau, comrade Liu ruiwu from the Environmental Protection Bureau, and comrade he jianian from the industrial and commercial Bureau. The comrades I just named will follow me to a place after the meeting.” Then, Tian Huilan’s eyes fell on the Deputy Secretary General of the municipal Party Committee, Lin Wanshui, who was sitting in the second row below the stage. She said,”Oh right, comrade Lin Wanshui, you should also participate.” Then, Tian Huilan nodded to the mayor, who was presiding over the meeting, indicating that he would announce the end of the meeting. The mayor was also a little confused by Tian Huilan’s “sudden attack.” Tian Huilan had never talked to him about this on – site office! However, the mayor quickly came back to his senses and quickly announced the end of the meeting. Tian Huilan immediately got up and walked off the stage. Xiao Mei quickly packed up Tian Huilan’s documents and water cup, then quickly followed. Considering that Tian Huilan might be at the scene, Xiao Mei quickly transferred Tian Huilan’s car over after handing over the note. In addition to her political experience, she was still inexperienced. Overall, Xiao Mei’s work as a Secretary was very meticulous. The few bureau chiefs who were called out by Tian Huilan were a little uneasy, not knowing what the situation would be. The one who was even more terrified was Lin Wanshui. The few units that Tian Huilan had pointed out, weren’t they the units that Lin Feng had found today? Thinking about how Xiao Mei came to find him at noon, Lin Wanshui suddenly had a bad feeling. He quickly caught up and whispered to Xiao Mei,””Young Xiao, I’ve found out about what you told me this afternoon. It was indeed a mistake on our part. I’ve already instructed them to add Lingyun hotel to the preliminary list immediately.” Xiao Mei’s eyes flashed with a trace of disgust. She had been ruined by Lin Wanshui today. She even felt that after today’s incident, it would be a problem if she could even stay as a Secretary. “Oh, thank you, Secretary Lin,” Xiao Mei said indifferently. Now that things had gotten out of hand, Lin Wanshui only thought of doing him a favor. How could Xiao Mei say anything more to him? “Little Xiao, Secretary Tian, she ...” Lin Wanshui quickly asked softly. “I’m not too sure. This is an unplanned schedule. I didn’t know the situation beforehand.” Xiao Mei said,”Secretary Lin, I’m sorry. The Secretary’s car is here. I’ll take my leave first!” After she finished speaking, Xiao Mei left Lin Wanshui behind and quickly chased after her, opening the car door for Tian Huilan. Tian Huilan was just about to bend down and get into the car, but she straightened up halfway and turned to look at Lin Wanshui. She said indifferently,””Comrade Lin Wanshui, you can take my car! Don’t call another car. ” If it was any other time, Lin Wanshui would have laughed even in his dreams if he was able to ride in the same car as Secretary Tian. This showed that the leader thought highly of him! But today was the exact opposite. His heart skipped a beat, and beads of sweat appeared on his forehead. He didn’t even have the chance to understand the situation or disclose information! Lin Wanshui felt that the situation was bad. However, after Tian Huilan finished speaking, she didn’t get on the car and just stood there looking at Lin Wanshui, so he didn’t dare to hesitate and quickly said,””Thank you, Secretary Tian!” Then, he jogged over and opened the car door on the other side. After Tian Huilan got into the car, he hurriedly got in and sat beside her. After Tian Huilan got into the car, she said indifferently,””Little Xiao, let’s go!” “Yes, Secretary!” Xiao Mei replied. She didn’t need Tian Huilan’s instructions to know where they were going. After Tian Huilan finished speaking, she leaned back in her chair and closed her eyes to rest, not saying a word to Lin Wanshui at all. Lin Wanshui felt like he was sitting on pins and needles. He kept wiping his sweat, and his heart was filled with fear. Xiao Mei saw the few bureau chiefs that Tian Huilan had pointed out also hurriedly get into their own cars, so she motioned for the driver to set off. Six or seven small cars left the municipal Party Committee compound in a single file and headed in the direction of the headquarters of the lingji food and beverage group.
