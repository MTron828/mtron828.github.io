Chapter 359: An orchid in an empty valley (3)

Chen dongbai and the others walked into the booth. The space was not very spacious. It was a little crowded with 10 to 20 people. Xia ruofei, who didn’t like to join in the fun, simply gave way to the outside.

He felt someone’s gaze fall on him. He turned around and saw Chen Song looking at him with a proud smile. His gaze was full of demonstration. It was obvious that the judges had given yang suhe a very high evaluation. He thought that victory was already in his hands.

Xia ruofei smiled and turned his head away.

In the booth, Chen dongbai took the judges to look at the pots of flowers. He was quite disappointed with the flowers that the landscape design Club of Sanshan University had sent to the exhibition this time. Except for the pot of Black Orchid, the quality of the other pots was very average. They were even worse than the flowers in the other smaller areas. It really did not match the reputation and status of Sanshan University.

It was only when he saw the pot of jade lion Mo Lan that Chen dongbai’s eyes suddenly lit up.

He took two quick steps and skipped the remaining two pots of flowers, directly coming to the pot of jade lion Mo Lan. After carefully observing it for a while, he praised,””This jade lion is really not bad! There’s no doubt that they’re the best among the orchids!”

Most of the judges were experts and had a high evaluation of the Jade lion. They nodded and praised it.

Xia Cheng finally heaved a sigh of relief as he looked at the judges ‘reaction. It meant that at least this pot of orchid would be able to get into the finals. As for the final result, that was not something he could decide.

Chen dongbai chuckled and said to the agricultural University’s leader beside him,”Vice – Principal li, your pot of yang Lotus has met its match! This jade lion is pretty good!”

“There’s only progress when there’s competition,”Vice President Li said with a smile. The better the flowers and plants that our fellow universities send to the exhibition, the better the level of our exhibition this time! This is a good thing ...”

Although he said that, vice – Principal Li’s smile was obviously a lot more forced, and he was no longer as confident as before.

Because it was only the initial selection, there were still many booths waiting to be evaluated, so the judges didn’t look too carefully.

Chen dongbai gave a slight nod to the judge beside him, and the judge immediately took note of it in his notebook.

Xia ruofei smiled and thought that this pot of orchid should be qualified.

As expected, the young judge said to Xia Cheng,””Congratulations, this jade lion has been shortlisted for the final round. Please send someone to send it to the organizing committee Office now. We will conduct a second evaluation later to choose the gold, silver, and bronze awards.”

“Alright, Thank you, teacher!” Xia Cheng said with a little excitement. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

The judges walked around, but didn’t see any other flowers that caught their eye, so they surrounded Chen dongbai and walked to the next booth.

“Yay! Brother Xia! We’ve been shortlisted!” Jiang Yue said excitedly.

Xia ruofei smiled.”It’s just the preliminaries and you’re already so happy. If we win the Gold Award later, Won’t You Be so excited that you can’t speak?”

Jiang Yue laughed in embarrassment,””Brother Xia, I think we can win for sure! Just now, President Chen said that our Mo Lan is a strong opponent of the Yang Lotus!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes!” Won’t it be a piece of cake to beat them?”

Lu You couldn’t help but glance at Xia ruofei and mumbled,””So cocky ...”

Xia ruofei’s ears were sharp! “Lu You, are you hoping that we will lose?” he immediately turned his head and asked.

“Of course I want to win!” Lu You said,”but don’t underestimate yang suhe from Agricultural University. Besides, she has the home ground factor!”

Xia ruofei nodded.”I don’t know much about orchids either. However, I believe that the judges will make the right decision.”

Lu You couldn’t help but roll her eyes. Xia Cheng and the others even revealed bitter smiles. ‘If you don’t know much about orchids, then wouldn’t we, the members of the gardening club, be laymen?’

At this time, Meng Zhou, who was on the opposite booth, had already walked to the entrance of the basketball stadium with the pot of yang Lotus in his arms. The organizing committee’s office was set up in an office next to the basketball stadium.

Chen Song followed behind Meng Zhou. He was also holding a pot of flowers in his hand. Obviously, two pots of flowers from Agricultural University had been nominated at the same time.

When they passed by the exhibition area of Sanshan University, Meng Zhou and Chen Song looked at the flowers and plants that were put on display by Sanshan University with disdain. Then, they walked out.

“Tsk ... What are you so proud of?” One of the students from the gardening club couldn’t help but whisper,”it’s not certain who will win the Gold Award!”

“Don’t say so much,” Xia Cheng said.”It’s about time we send this jade lion over.”

After he finished speaking, he also walked towards the pot of Black Orchid, clearly prepared to personally deliver it.

“President Xia, please wait a moment ...” Xia ruofei said.

With that, Xia ruofei took out a small watering can that he had prepared earlier from his bag and sprayed some water on the leaves and flowers of the orchid. The mist – like water attached to the leaves and petals, forming small droplets.

Xia Cheng’s eyebrows raised,” After spraying some water, the Jade lion’s aura seems to have changed again ...”

Everyone also gathered around, only to see that the pot of mo orchid seemed to have suddenly become a lot more energetic. In the contrast of these small beads of water, it had a rather slender and elegant feeling.

“Mr. Xia, can you give me this spray can?” Xia Cheng hesitated for a moment before asking,”I’m afraid that I’ll damage the water droplets on the way. Later, when we reach the committee Office, I’ll spray some more on it ...”

Xia ruofei thought for a while, then smiled and nodded. He passed the small spray can to Xia Cheng.

It was just the spiritual pond water and not the flower petal solution. Hence, Xia ruofei was not worried about anyone finding out his secret.

Xia Cheng thanked Xia ruofei and asked another student from the Garden Club to pick up the flower pot. Xia Cheng took the watering can and the two of them walked out of the basketball court.

The next step was to wait. The atmosphere in the booth was a little tense. Everyone felt that this time, the Gold Award was very close, but they were not sure what the final result would be.

Jiang Yue was even more restless. The Gold Award this time was related to the bet between Xia ruofei and Chen Song. If they lost, Xia ruofei would lose face while Lu You would lose a pot of precious orchids.

One was her best friend while the other was the man she secretly liked. Jiang Yue was confused because of her concern.

The waiting time was quite long. The flower Fair was officially open at noon, so the entire morning was reserved for the preparation work such as the exhibition, judging, and so on.

After the shortlisted flowers were sent to the organizing committee’s office, the organizing committee quickly held a closed – door meeting.

They drove for almost two hours.

Xia Cheng mumbled to herself that Jian Jia had done the same thing in the past years, but the judges would at most take an hour to announce all the gold, silver, and bronze awards.

Almost twice the time had passed this year, and there was still no result.

Could it be that the competition was too intense?

Xia Cheng had a feeling that the reason why the judges were so uncertain and had such a heated discussion was probably because of their jade lion Mo Lan and Yang Su He from Agricultural University.

Time passed by.

Two and a half hours later, the staff finally came to inform everyone to gather at the main hall.

Xia Cheng and the others immediately perked up. It was time to announce the final result!
