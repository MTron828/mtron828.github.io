1963 A new idea (1)

Everything had two sides.

Was there a way to produce good quality foie gras without making the goose suffer so much pain? This was the sudden thought that popped up in Xia ruofei’s mind.

Xia ruofei did not have much sympathy, but he had his own bottom line.

If he were to use the traditional method of breeding fat geese as old Blake had said, he would definitely not be willing to get involved in this industry. But if he could improve the breeding method, and at the same time bring paradise Corporation a richer product line and greater profits, why not?

Moreover, if it could really form a scale and control the cost, it could completely impact this industry and make those traditional fat goose farms have no room for survival. It was equivalent to saving those poor fat geese in disguise. This was also one of the added values of the Paradise Corporation in this industry!

As for the Taoyuan company’s breeding of the fat geese, they also had to kill them for their liver. Xia ruofei did not have any psychological burden. It was natural selection. Those fat geese were originally meant to be eaten by humans. If they could let them live their lives without any pain, it would be a merit. Even the animal protection organization would not boycott the breeding base. They only asked for the animals to be slaughtered in a humane and painless way.

Of course, whether this idea would work or not would depend on whether Xia ruofei could find a gentler way to raise them.

Thinking of this, Xia ruofei became more interested in foie gras.

“Mr. Blake, then ... May I know which breed of goose is better?” he asked.

Old Blake was a little surprised, but he smiled and said,””I thought Mr. Xia would give up on foie gras after listening to my explanation. In my impression, you Orientals are more gentle and kind. In fact, the largest area of fat goose breeding is in Austria in Europe. ”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I haven’t decided if I want to get involved in this industry.” However, it’s always good to know more!”

Old Blake nodded in agreement,”Yes! Although I’m not an animal protector, I’m still against foie gras, but that doesn’t stop the black family from doing business on behalf of French foie gras. In my opinion, personal feelings are one thing, business is another!”

In fact, neither old Blake nor Xia ruofei knew that it was the Chinese who first discovered that forced – feeding could make duck meat more delicious. Later, this method was passed from ancient Egypt to Rome and then to France. It became a common method to cultivate foie gras.

It could be said that the Chinese were the ancestors of this method.

Xia ruofei nodded with a smile and looked at old Blake quietly.

“By the way, I haven’t answered your question yet!” Blake said. As far as I know, there are three best breeds for producing foie gras, namely ronde goose, Strasburg goose, and Toulouse goose. The foie gras produced by these three kinds of geese were of good quality, large in size, rich in nutrition, and fragrant after cooking. The taste was excellent. The most famous foie gras is the Strasburg foie gras, which the Louis XVI had tasted back then. ”

Xia ruofei noted down the Strasburg goose in his heart.

Since they wanted to research the breeding of French fat goose, they naturally had to use the best breed. This had always been the business philosophy of paradise Corporation.

Next, Xia ruofei asked old Blake for more details about the goose breeding. However, the Blake family was only in charge of the foie gras business and did not have their own farm, so old Blake did not know much about the details.

However, old Blake could tell that Xia ruofei was very interested in French – style goose breeding. He enthusiastically offered to introduce Xia ruofei to the owner of a fat goose breeding farm that they were working with.

Xia ruofei asked around and found out that the goose that this farm was raising was the Strasburg goose. He was naturally very happy to hear that.

Xia ruofei asked,”Mr. Blake, then ... Can you please help me contact this farm owner and ask if he’s willing to sell me a few breeding geese and some young geese?” I’m willing to pay a high price for it!”

“It shouldn’t be a problem,” old Blake said. Although the Strasburg goose liver is known as the world’s best goose liver, the bloodline of this fat goose is not rare. Many farms in Europe have pure Strasburg goose, so there is no problem with the technical blockade. I believe that eisen will give me face!”

“That’s great!” Xia ruofei said,”Mr. Blake, I’ll leave this matter to you! This is my personal contact information. If you have any news, you can contact me immediately!”

Xia ruofei said as he handed old Blake a business card.

“Alright! Xia, just wait for the good news!” Old Blake put away the business card with a smile.

Then he stood up and said,”it’s getting late. I still have a date tonight. I’ll take my leave first!”

Xia ruofei had wanted to ask old Blake about the caviar, but it was almost dinner time. Old Blake had a dinner appointment and Xia ruofei had a dinner appointment with MA Xiong, so he gave up.

However, he would still trade truffles with old Blake after the auction, so he would have plenty of opportunities to ask about the situation.

Xia ruofei stood up and shook hands with old Blake.””Mr. Blake, I’ll send you off!”

He walked old Blake to the door in person.

Old Blake walked out of the Presidential Suite, stopped, and turned back.”Xia, please wait! By the way, the one million euro deposit will be transferred to your account as soon as tonight. Please check it!”

“Alright, I hope we can work well together!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

After sending old Blake off, Xia ruofei did not change into his home clothes again. It was almost dinner time, and it would be more troublesome to change.

He sat on the terrace and smoked a cigarette. He was not thinking about the auction tomorrow, but how to raise the fat goose in the normal way and harvest the foie gras at the same time.

However, he couldn’t come up with anything after thinking about it for a long time. He decided to discuss it with Xia Qing in the medium when he was free. Besides, even if he had an idea now, it was useless. At least, he had to wait for old Blake to help him contact the import of some Strasburg geese before he could carry out the breeding experiment.

There was a time – acceleration function in the space, and the growth cycle of the French goose was not long. It took about fifteen weeks to turn from a young goose to a fat goose waiting to be slaughtered for its liver. With the double – layered time – acceleration array, it only took a few hours.

The melodious doorbell rang.

Tony, the exclusive Butler of the Presidential Suite, came in.

Mr. Xia, Chairman MA and the guests have arrived at the hotel. He asked me to take you to the banquet.” Tony said respectfully. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Xia ruofei nodded. He stood up and asked,””Where are my friends?”

“There’s someone to inform them. You can go to the banquet hall directly.” Tony said.

“Sure, wait outside for a while. I’ll be right out.” Xia ruofei said.

“Alright!” Tony bowed slightly and left the Presidential Suite.

Xia ruofei went to the bedroom and scanned the entire room with his spiritual power out of habit. After making sure that there was no audio or surveillance equipment, he took out a bunch of things from his space.

There were two bottles of expensive rot sweet wine that he had brewed himself. After being cooked in the medium, the taste of the expensive rot wine was much better than when he had just brewed it. It was just right to give it to MA Xiong as a gift, and everyone could try it during dinner.

In addition, Xia ruofei also took out a few sets of jadeskin ointment, which was the highest grade of the Jade bone ice Skin Series produced by Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory. It was sold at 3888 Yuan a bottle.

Xia ruofei remembered that MA Xiong said that he had other guests tonight. He had originally planned to take two bottles, one for MA Xiong’s wife and one for Tian Huixin. Now that there might be other female guests, Xia ruofei simply took out a few more.

Although it was still difficult to buy this mass – produced Jade skin cream in the outside world, Xia ruofei could get as much as he wanted. He kept a batch in his interspace all year round. It would not go bad anyway, and it was mainly used as a gift.

Although the effect of his handmade jaded skin cream was much better than the mass – produced version, after all, the mass – produced version had a pricing standard. In addition, there was a ready – made packaging, so it was better to give gifts in the mass – produced version.

Finally, Xia ruofei took out a pink Hello Kitty soft toy. Before he came to Hong Kong, he had asked Ling Qingxue, who also liked Hello Kitty, to buy it from a specialty store. This small soft toy cost more than a thousand Yuan.

This soft toy was naturally prepared for little Huanhuan.

However, this was not the gift that Xia ruofei really wanted to give Huanhuan. He doted on little Huanhuan very much and treated her like his own daughter. Before he came to Hong Kong, he had already decided to give Huanhuan a chance. This doll was just a facade. After all, Huanhuan was still so young. If he saw that uncle Xia had given gifts to her grandparents and parents but not her, he might be angry!

Xia ruofei found a paper bag and packed all these things. Then, he tidied his clothes and walked out of the Presidential Suite with the paper bag.

Tony brought Xia ruofei down the private elevator. When they arrived at MA Xiong’s private room, Feng Jing and the others were already there. They were chatting happily with MA Xiong, and there were a few familiar figures beside him.

The real estate magnate of Hong Kong, Guo Hongjiang, and the Super – rich man of Hong Kong, Zheng tiannian ...

There were three or four of them, and they were all tycoons who could shake the entire Hong Kong with a stomp of their feet. Moreover, these tycoons had already gotten to know Xia ruofei at the last auction. Especially Guo Hongjiang, who was full of gratitude to Xia ruofei because of his beloved horse, the Star of Asia. He even gave Xia ruofei a thousand – foot mansion.

MA Xiong was the first to see Xia ruofei. He immediately greeted him with a smile and said, “Everyone, Xia Sheng has arrived!”
