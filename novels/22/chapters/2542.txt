2543 Receiving orders in the face of danger (1)

The Spanish fans in blue and white striped shirts in the visiting stands were still very eye – catching. Wu Lei found them at a glance.

When Xue Jinshan and the other Spanish fans saw Wu Lei looking up, they could not help but shout even louder and wave the team scarves in their hands.

Due to the distance, Wu Lei could not see the faces of the fans clearly. Naturally, he did not know that there was a group of excited Chinese compatriots in the stands. He smiled and waved to the away team’s stands, then continued to warm up with his teammates.

Xue Jinshan and the others also waved their scarves at Wu Lei excitedly. Their enthusiasm only slowly subsided when Wu Lei continued to warm up.

Xue Jinshan sighed,”I didn’t really watch football in the past, but now that I’m back in the stadium, I realize how attractive football is!” With this atmosphere, even the most introverted person would not be able to help but shout along!”

“Isn’t it? The competition hadn’t even started! I feel like the stands are already boiling!”

“To be able to watch a top – tier League game live, I can brag about it for a year when I go back!” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

The employees of paradise Corporation were also discussing this matter.

After the players finished their warm – up, they returned to the locker room one after another to make their final pre – Match preparations. The manager would also clarify the tactics for everyone again.

Xia ruofei did not return to the changing room with them. Instead, he sat on the substitute bench and napped. This was not considered special. The tactics that the coach set up were mainly aimed at the main players. Xia ruofei was a substitute for this game. Before the substitute came on, the coach would once again make clear how he should play after he went on. Besides, Xia ruofei had told Ruby in advance that he wanted to reduce his chances of appearing in public before the match, and Ruby had agreed.

……

Beijing, China.

In a PP sports studio, the commentators for the game were still Shen fangjian and Jia Tianning.

Due to the time difference, the start time of the game was not very friendly for the Chinese fans. The game only started at 3 a.m. Chinese time. According to past situations, this time was enough to intimidate many fans and make them give up watching the game.

Fortunately, it was a Sunday the next day, so most people didn’t have to go to work. In addition, Wu Lei’s performance in the last game had raised the expectations of many fans, so there were still many fans who stayed up late to watch the game. The data of PP sports’s background showed that the number of people online at the same time was not much less than the last game.

It must be known that the Spanish team’s last game had started in the afternoon. On the Chinese side, it was about 11 p.m., Which was a very suitable time to watch the game. It was not even 1 p.m. After the game.

Shen fangjian and Jia Tianning were in the pre – Match analysis and commentary segment. Both of them agreed that the Spanish team was much worse than their opponent in terms of strength. In this game, the Spaniards should give up the possession tactics and tighten their defensive line as much as possible. In addition, they should be determined when fighting back and speed up their advance.

Like many La Liga teams, Espanyol was used to playing pass – Control tactics. They liked to constantly pass the ball in the middle and backfield, hoping to pull the opponent’s defensive line and find their flaws. Many of the Spanish players were used to controlling the ball after receiving it. If one or two players did this, the rhythm would be slowed down.

After the pre – Match analysis, they began to broadcast the images of the team’s arrival, as well as the images of the players arriving in the locker room before the Spanish club’s television station.

Shen fangjian and Jia Tianning’s attention was on Wu Lei. Xia ruofei, who was wearing sunglasses and a mask and walking with the coaching staff, didn’t attract their attention.

In the away team’s locker room, the two noticed the number 25 Jersey that was next to Wu Lei’s Jersey. Because the Jersey was hanging next to Wu Lei’s Jersey and the name “XIA RUOFEI” was also very conspicuous, the two could not help but play the “guess who I am” game and made a lot of guesses in the live broadcast.

However, as the signal in front switched to the scene of the players ‘passageway, the two men’s attention suddenly shifted.

In Valencia, Spain, the players from both teams were standing in the players ‘passageway, ready to enter the field under the guidance of the referee. As for Wu Lei and several other substitutes, they had already taken their seats on the substitutes ‘bench for the away team.

Shen fangjian looked at the screen and said,”we can see that the players on both sides are ready to play.” Before the game, we got the starting list of both teams. Wu Lei is still on standby on the substitutes ‘bench for this game. This is really not good news for the fans who stay up late to watch the game. ”

Jia Tianning said,”I think Ruby is still a bit conservative. Although Wu Lei hasn’t been on the team for long, he showed his full strength in the last game. However, Ruby would rather use the young puado than let Wu Lei start. I personally think the coach is too conservative.”

“That’s right! No matter how you look at it, Wu Lei is more suitable to be the starting player than puado!” Shen fangjian said,”the most important thing is that Wu Lei has the support of the mysterious power of the East! You’ll know after watching the last match!”

After the last game, because Shen fangjian and Jia Tianning sang praises for Wu Lei almost without any principles, the two were “promoted” to be the Vice – Leader of “Wu Chui Tang” on the internet, and they were teased by the fans. Now it seemed that the two of them wanted to continue to carry forward the glorious career of Wu Chui. They still had no intention of keeping a relatively low profile in this game.
