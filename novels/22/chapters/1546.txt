Chapter 1547: Even the gods can’t break an inch of Jade (1)

Translator: 549690339

The master’s shout startled everyone at the scene.

Could it really be green? It can’t be that weird, right?

This thought had just emerged in He Ping’s mind when he heard the master of cutting stones shout,””Green! It’s Green!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh. Who cheated on her? why was she so excited?

He Ping’s face was filled with disbelief. He rushed over to the master’s side in two steps, took out a strong flashlight, and shone it into the incision.

Then, He Ping was stunned.

The onlookers were getting anxious! They saw that He Ping did not move for a long time and could not help but ask,””Old he, how is it?”

He Ping straightened his body in a daze and muttered,””There’s really green ... How is this possible?”

It wasn’t the first time he had analyzed this raw stone. Yesterday, he had looked at it with Yu mingdong for a long time during the pre – Exhibition. Just now, he had looked at it carefully again. He was quite confident in his heart before he drew that line.

Who would have thought that this line would be so wrong? if Xia ruofei had not called for it to stop, this knife would have cut a good piece of Jade into two. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

No matter what his previous analysis was, this result had completely overturned it.

The moment He Ping’s words fell, the surrounding people also couldn’t help but stir.

It really turned green! The way everyone looked at Xia ruofei changed. What was with this young man’s eyes? He could see it clearly in that situation, could it be a wild guess?

He Ping still found it a little hard to believe. The stonecutter at the side asked awkwardly,””Boss, this raw material ... How do we open it next?”

Xia ruofei said,”I don’t know anything about this ... Old he, why don’t ... Could you please take a look?”

He Ping couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows. Seeing this, Xia ruofei quickly said,””Old he, don’t misunderstand! I don’t mean anything by that ... I really don’t know much about stone gambling. I’ll need your help with the next step ...”

Initially, He Ping was too embarrassed to stay any longer. However, he could tell from Xia ruofei’s tone that he was not mocking him. In fact, he was rather sincere. Furthermore, he was rather curious about this raw stone, so he nodded shamelessly and started to analyze it seriously.

He Ping mumbled some technical terms that Xia ruofei could not understand. However, he was very sure that there was a valuable Jade inside his raw gemstone. The Xuanji painting had never been wrong.

He Ping analyzed for a long time, but he was still uncertain. In the end, he drew another line and said after hesitating for a moment,””Master, let’s start with this position this time!”

Then, He Ping said to Xia ruofei,””Mr. Xia, let me make this clear to you! I’m not very confident this time. If it’s really broken ...”

“It doesn’t matter!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I have good eyesight. If there’s really green, I should be able to see it immediately.”

He Ping’s eyelids twitched, but he didn’t say anything more.

The stone cutter naturally did not have any objections. He quickly adjusted the angle according to the line drawn by He Ping, then turned on the power of the cutting machine and started to cut from another position.

Everyone perked up and wanted to see if old he, who always had sharp eyes – would make another mistake. Xia ruofei also stared at the raw stone under the cutting machine seriously, hoping that if he Ping made a wrong judgment, it would be his Jade that was cut – it would be money!

This time, there was no accident. Stone chips flew in the air, and the raw stone was cut into two halves, one big and one small. There was no green at the cut.

“Old he is still as sharp as ever!”

“That was probably an accident. This is old he’s standard!”

Everyone was also discussing animatedly. He Ping’s expression also finally looked much better.

After that, He Ping became more confident. He judged that there was no Jade in the small half, so he asked the stonecutter to start polishing the big half of the raw stone. At the same time, he also drew a few reference lines.

The master also quickly changed the grinding wheel and cut the big half of the raw stone according to He Ping’s instructions.

However, Xia ruofei’s heart skipped a beat. Intentionally or otherwise, he moved closer to take a look. When no one was paying attention, he casually reached out and touched the other half of the raw stone. His eyes flashed with a sharp light.

However, Xia ruofei did not say anything. He just stood aside and watched the stonecutter quietly.

The raw stone gradually shrank under the skillful operation of the stonecutter, and a large amount of worthless Stone Skin was cut off.

“Green! It’s Green!”

“Quick, take a look at the planting water.”

The onlookers all cried out in excitement.

Xia ruofei also looked over. The stonecutter turned off the cutting machine, found a basin of water to wash the cut, and then wiped it clean with a wet cloth.

He Ping had already walked up to check at the first moment. The corners of his mouth curled up into a slight arc as he turned his head and said,””It’s a glutinous type with an average water head. If it’s 8.6 million, it should be a gambled loss ...”

When he Ping said this, everyone sighed. At the same time, many people looked at Xia ruofei with gloating eyes.

They could tell that Xia ruofei was just a rich young master who did not know anything about stone gambling. If the price rose, he would be extremely lucky. It was normal to lose.

Especially since many people hated the rich. Seeing that Xia ruofei had lost a few million at once, they couldn’t help but feel happy.
