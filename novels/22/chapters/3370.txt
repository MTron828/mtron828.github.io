  In fact, the meaning of the storage ring was very different between Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue. If Ling Qingxue gave song Qiming a storage ring, Song Wei would definitely be grateful, and their relationship would be more harmonious.

  Song Qiming would also have a better impression of Ling Qingxue. Who knew when she could play an unexpected role in the future?

  If it was Xia ruofei, song Qiming and Song Wei would be grateful, but the effect would not be as good as Ling Qingxue 's.

  Ling Qingxue was also a successful career woman who had been working hard in the business world for many years. She was just like a little woman in front of Xia ruofei, but in reality, she had a high EQ, so she naturally saw through it. However, she did not say anything more. She just stood on her tiptoes and kissed Xia ruofei gently on the lips, then said softly,"Ruofei, thank you!"

  "Silly girl! "You're still so polite with me ..." Xia ruofei said happily. Then, he put his arm around Ling Qingxue's slender waist and said,"there are still two rewards that haven't been claimed! Let's go take a look!"

  Xia ruofei held Ling Qingxue and walked towards the third stone pillar.

  He saw that on top of the stone pillar, there were 500 yellow jade essence kasayas neatly stacked. This was the regular reward for completing the trial tower's fourth level quest.

  Xia ruofei deduced that if it was an ordinary golden core cultivator, they would need to collect about 200 to 250 pieces of Topaz essence on the fourth level of the trial Pagoda. The reason why he needed to collect 500 pieces was because he was teleported to the same trial space as Ling Qingxue. The difficulty of the task was based on his cultivation level, and it would double on that.

  In other words, as long as an ordinary golden core stage cultivator could successfully complete the task on the fourth level of the trial tower, figure out the use of the yellow jade essence, and dare to try to absorb it directly during the process of the task, they would get about 700 to 800 yellow jade essence, including the usual task rewards.

  This was already a considerable number. For an ordinary Aurous core stage cultivator, absorbing this much yellow jade essence would already be able to improve their mental power by a large margin.

  This time, Xia ruofei had completely relied on the cheating device, the perceptual mirror, to collect more than 2000 pieces of Topaz. In addition to the 500 pieces of Topaz as a reward for this regular mission, it could be said that he had earned a lot.

  Although the mission prompt did not mention it, Xia ruofei knew that these 500 pieces of Topaz essence could not be taken out of the trial Pagoda. They had to be absorbed here.

  It would be great if he could bring them out. Of course, Xia ruofei would not use them to exchange for spiritual stones. Any cultivator who was not stupid would not do such a stupid thing. However, he could give them to his family and friends, such as Song Wei, Li Yifu, song Qiming, and his disciple Tang Haoran.

  Since he couldn't bring it out, Xia ruofei didn't have anything to consider. He pointed at the yellow jade Spirit and smiled."Qingxue, come! You're welcome, absorb them all!"

  Ling Qingxue thought for a moment and said,"you should absorb it yourself!" You need to improve your spiritual power more than I do! Besides ... My spiritual force has already increased so much. If I continue to absorb it, won't it be as bad as going too far?"

  Xia ruofei laughed and said,"nonsense!" The stronger the spiritual power, the better it was. If one's cultivation of true Qi improved faster than the cultivation of mental power, then one should pay attention to it. If one's mental power was not strong enough, it was easy to cause problems in the control of true Qi, or even Qi deviation. But now it was the opposite, so what was there to worry about? I don't know how many cultivators would wish for you to be in such a state!"

  Ling Qingxue stuck out her tongue and smiled in embarrassment.""Oh! I know ... But it's more important to improve your strength! You've already absorbed so much yellow jade essence for me on the fourth floor of the trial Pagoda. You should keep it for yourself!"

  Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,"I'm still far from breaking through my spiritual power!" These yellow jade spirits are like a cup of water on a burning cart of firewood to me. They won't be of much help to me, but it's different for you. Every bit of progress you make will be of great benefit to your cultivation! Believe me, if you absorb the yellow jade essence, it will definitely be more valuable than me absorbing it myself!"

  "Oh ... Alright then ..." Ling Qingxue said."It'll be great if we can bring this yellow jade essence out. Then we can let Wei Wei absorb some of it ... RUO Fei, why don't we try to see if there's any way?"

  Xia ruofei said seriously,"don't even think about it. The person who set up this secret realm and the trial Pagoda is definitely a mighty figure. Moreover, it's someone with a cultivation level that I can't even imagine. We have to follow the rules set by him. It's impossible for us to take advantage of the loopholes. We can't be too smart and end up with nothing."

  "Oh ..." Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

  "Be good and absorb the yellow jade essence directly!" Xia ruofei said,"the mission on the trial tower's fifth level is a chain mission. We've just completed the first round and destroyed the star Fern thorn ring belt. Perhaps the second round's mission will arrive soon! Make the best use of your time!"

  "I know!" Ling Qingxue obediently moved the yellow jade spirits down and sat cross - legged on the ground.

  Just as Ling Qingxue was about to start absorbing the Topaz essence, Xia ruofei happened to glance at the last stone pillar. He could not help but be slightly stunned when he saw it. Then, he smiled and said,""Qingxue! Wait a minute!"
