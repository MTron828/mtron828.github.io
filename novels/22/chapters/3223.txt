3224 Chapter 1760 – Full of worries (1)

Li Yifu shrugged his shoulders with a hint of displeasure on his face and said,””Mr. Masker, do you think I flew all the way to Silicon Valley just to make fun of you?”

“No, no, no, Mr. Li, you’ve misunderstood ...” Said Elon Musk, waving his hand.”It’s just that the deal you proposed is a little too unexpected!”

Li Yifu smiled.”I believe that with SpaceX’s technical strength, they should already have a mature spacesuit product. As for the other supporting equipment and modules, it’s even more so. Why are you so surprised, Mr. Masker?” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Of course, there’s no problem with SpaceX’s technology!” Elon Musk shook his head and said,”but Mr. Li should know the sensitivity of aerospace technology. In particular ... I’m very sorry, I don’t mean to be racist, but the reality is like this. Mr. Li, your Chinese identity may make this matter even more sensitive. ”

“I can guarantee that all the spacesuits, equipment, and modules will not be transported out of the United States. No technical details will be leaked, and they will not be used in the military or terrorist attack.” Li Yifu said.

“Mr. Li, you should know that such a guarantee will not help in the transaction at all ... And I’m very curious, Mr. Li, why do you suddenly want to buy such a large number of Eva suits?” Is your group also interested in entering the aerospace field?”

“I’m sorry, but I can’t tell you what the spacesuits are for,”Li Yifu said after a moment of silence. However, our company has no intention of entering the aerospace field, nor will we become a competitor of SpaceX. This is just a purchase under my personal name. ”

Li Yifu’s words obviously could not eliminate Elon Musk’s doubts.

Li Yifu looked at Elon Musk and said,””Mr. Masker, this matter is actually not that complicated. You can see it as a normal transaction, but the amount of the transaction is a Little Big, maybe more than one billion dollars. I think...SpaceX’s continued investment in the aerospace field, especially now that it has entered the critical stage of manned space flight, should have a high demand for funds! I’m very willing to give you a hand at this time! As long as we agree on the deal, I’m willing to pay the full amount!”

Elon Musk hesitated because Li Yifu’s proposed purchase of an EVA suit could easily cost 20 to 30 million dollars, so the transaction amount would not be too low. SpaceX did need more cash flow to maintain their high expenses at this stage.

Otherwise, when Li Yifu proposed to buy a spacesuit, Elon Musk would have refused without hesitation.

It had to be said that one billion dollars of cash flow was a huge temptation for Elon Musk. Although the cost of producing these spacesuits and other equipment was very high, the profit margin was actually very large. And considering the accounting period and other factors, in fact, the one billion US dollars could be regarded as a net income in the short term.

However, after an intense mental struggle, elonmask still slowly shook his head and said,””I am very sorry, Mr. Li. I really want to help you, and I’m also very eager to get more funds, but this deal is too risky. I’m afraid I can’t do anything ...”

“Mr. Masker, the risk is actually controllable.” Li Yifu said,”we can sign a series of ...”

“I’m sorry!” Elon Musk’s attitude became a lot more determined.”Mr. Li, I know that lawyers have a hundred ways to let us complete the transaction without taking any legal risks. But ... The FBI doesn’t care about the law! You should know ...”

At this point, elonmax shrugged and did not continue.

Li Yifu also understood Elon Musk’s concerns. His understanding of the United States was even better than his own country, China. He didn’t need Elon Musk to say anything more. He was very clear that agencies like the CIB and the FBA wouldn’t talk about the law at all. As long as they were accused of “endangering national security,” they could carry out any action outside of legal authorization, just like holding a sword.

The people did not fight with the officials. Even in the United States, this was an irrefutable truth.

Li Yifu sighed to himself. He knew that today’s negotiation would not have any results.

Although the meeting would last for half an hour, Li Yifu did not continue to try to persuade Elon Musk. Instead, he stood up and said,””Alright! It was such a pity. If Mr. Masker changes his mind, please contact me as soon as possible. I should be in Silicon Valley these days!”

Elon Musk stood up and shook hands with Lee Yifu. He smiled and said,””Definitely!”

Elon Musk personally sent Lee Yifu to the door, and then both sides waved goodbye.

Although Elon Musk was very polite, Li Yifu could tell that it would be very difficult to change his mind.

On the way back to the hotel, Li Yifu’s eyes lit up.

If normal business methods did not work, he could only resort to unconventional means.

After Li Yifu returned to the hotel, he first used the satellite phone to contact Xia ruofei. The reason why Yingluo used the satellite phone was naturally to reduce the possibility of the secret being leaked. This was the United States, and monitoring could be said to be everywhere.
