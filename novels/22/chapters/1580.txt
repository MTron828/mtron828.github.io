Chapter 1582: Breakthrough_1

Yu mingdong was stunned for a moment. He originally trusted Xia ruofei very much. In addition, this transaction was really pitifully small. It was only a mere five hundred thousand Yuan, so he felt that there was no need to sign any transfer agreement.

Song Wei didn’t understand either, but since Xia ruofei had brought it up, she wouldn’t be stupid enough to ask.

Although Yu mingdong was a little surprised, he didn’t take it to heart. He laughed and said,””Alright! It’s good to be more formal ... Lei, go to the committee and get a transfer agreement!”

“Alright, President Yu!” Shi Lei immediately strode towards the door.

Because all kinds of private transactions were also very frequent in the public bid, the organizer of the public bid provided a template transfer agreement. They only needed to fill in the blank space with the amount, the identity information of both parties, and other information, and then sign and stamp their fingerprints to take effect.

Soon, Shi Lei returned with two blank copies of the transfer agreement.

Yu mingdong and Song Wei filled in the blank space together. After both parties confirmed it, they signed and stamped their thumbprints. Then, they each took a copy of the agreement.

After the small interlude, Yu mingdong began to take care of the stone cutting.

Song Wei stood beside Xia ruofei and asked softly,””Ruofei, why is it so troublesome? what kind of agreement is this?”

Xia ruofei looked around and said in a low voice,””Keep this agreement and the receipt for the raw stones. You’re not from the same family, and uncle song’s side is too sensitive. These things are evidence of your 500000 Yuan. If anything happens in the future, you won’t be able to explain yourself ...”

Song Wei finally understood. She did not expect Xia ruofei to think so much about her. Even she, who grew up in a leading family, did not think about it. Xia ruofei thought about it and she felt warm inside.

Song Wei folded the agreement carefully and put it away. Then, she said softly,”Thank you, ruofei!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”let’s go and watch chief Yu cut the stone!”

Yu mingdong’s luck was really good. Although he didn’t have a stone gambling consultant and the raw stones were all picked by him, the performance after opening them was not bad.

Yu mingdong had won a total of six raw stones, and two of them had lost a little money. This was within the normal range of probability. After all, no matter how experienced a person was, it was impossible to completely speculate the internal situation of the raw stones.

Out of the remaining four, two of them had a small increase, one of them had about doubled, and the last one had a big increase.

In total, Yu mingdong had earned at least another ten million Yuan after opening this batch of raw stones.

Of course, Yu mingdong’s family was in this line of business. He naturally wouldn’t sell the Jade. He would send it back to his own factory to be processed into various jade products. Of course, he would make more money. Moreover, the Jade Market was on the rise, so it was definitely profitable to hoard some raw materials.

Yu mingdong was so happy that he smiled and gave the master another ten thousand Yuan red packet.

The surrounding Jade merchants were also very envious.

Although Yu mingdong wasn’t the most eye – catching and most expensive raw stone in the public bid, including the highest bid in the entire public bid, he was definitely the most efficient person to make money at this public bid. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Those who had spent tens of millions to buy the most eye – catching raw stones might also have good Jade, but they might not earn as much as Yu mingdong.

Everyone congratulated Yu Ming Dong, and Yu Ming Dong also cupped his hands to the surrounding people and expressed his gratitude.

After dealing with the crowd, Yu mingdong handed all the Jade that he had cut out to Shi Lei for safekeeping. He then walked over with a face full of joy and said,””Mr. Xia, it seems that this master’s hands are quite good today! Why don’t you take out your raw stones and untie them?”

Xia ruofei chuckled and shook his head. “I’m just afraid of embarrassing myself! I’m not going to open these raw stones anymore. I’ll bring them back and secretly find a place to open them ... At least this way, I can still maintain my image of being lucky, right?”

Yu mingdong laughed and said,”Mr. Xia, you’re overthinking it!” I think your raw stones won’t be bad!”

Xia ruofei waved his hand.”Forget it! Forget it! I won’t join in the fun!”

Yu mingdong could tell that Xia ruofei was not joking and could not help but say,””Mr. Xia, these raw stones aren’t small! And it’s worth more than 20 million! I’m afraid it’ll be quite troublesome for you to transport it back to the southeast from Yunnan Province ...”

“Ruofei, if you really want to ship it back, I can help you contact someone. I know someone in the airline. It won’t be a problem to do it by air!” Song Wei said.

Xia ruofei laughed and said to Yu mingdong,””President Yu, did you see that? The transportation problem was solved! I’d better transport it back and untie it myself! If it doesn’t work, I won’t tell anyone ...”

“If the price increases and Mr. Xia is interested in selling it, don’t forget to contact me first!” Yu mingdong quickly said,”don’t worry about the price. I will definitely satisfy you!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”definitely!” I will!”

He definitely wouldn’t look for Yu mingdong to sell his Jade anymore. In fact, he had plenty of money now. After the Jade was cut out, he might not sell it. If he had good quality Jade, he could keep it for himself to carve some pendants, bracelets, and so on. It would be good to give it to family, friends, and elders. Moreover, Jade was also a good carrier for array patterns. His current array Dao level was no longer the same as before. These jades could be used to play a lot of roles.
