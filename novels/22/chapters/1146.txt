Chapter 1147: The Beile Manor’s new owner (3)

Translator: 549690339

Wu shuheng said,”ruofei, the alley outside the backyard is quite wide. If you buy this house, you can open a wider door in the backyard and modify it into two garages. It will be very convenient to enter and exit.”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”not bad, not bad!” Brother Wu’s house is indeed very suitable for living!”

Zhao Yongjun smiled and said,”how is it, ruofei?” Are you satisfied after reading it? If you’re interested, just say it. You don’t have to hide it from brother Wu, he’ll definitely give you the best price!”

Wu shuheng laughed.”You’re brave soldier’s brother. If you really want this house, I’ll definitely give you the lowest price!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Brother Wu, I do like this house. Name your price!”

Wu shuheng was also secretly happy that his company abroad was having cash flow difficulties, and he came back this time to sell his house for cash.

However, a courtyard house located in the center of the capital was definitely out of reach for ordinary people. Moreover, with such a large area, the total price was even more shocking. How could it be sold in a short time?

In the past few days, a few people had come to see the house, but they were all shocked by the high price and did not continue after they went back.

These days, Wu shuheng was also secretly anxious.

Today, Zhao Yongjun had personally brought his friend over to look at the house. Wu shuheng was looking forward to it. After all, anyone who could call Zhao Yongjun a brother must have a good financial background.

Seeing that Xia ruofei was asking about the price, Wu shuheng quickly said,””Ruofei, the courtyards in this area cost more than 100000 Yuan each. If this house is put up for sale online, it will definitely be worth more than 160 million Yuan. In addition, the renovation alone cost me tens of millions a few years ago. This is something that other courtyards can’t compare to. But you’re a brother of Yongjun. If you really want it, just give me 140 million. All the electrical appliances and facilities in this yard will be free!”

In fact, what Wu shuheng didn’t say was that if he put the house up for sale, it was indeed possible to sell it for 160 million Yuan, but that would take time.

After all, this was a high – end property source. The skyrocketing housing prices in Beijing only increased the wealth on paper, but if they wanted to cash it out, it was far inferior to those super – Small apartments in the school district with a relatively low total price.

After Xia ruofei heard Wu shuheng’s offer, he nodded in his heart. He had learned about the housing prices in this area yesterday and knew that Wu shuheng was not exaggerating. 140 million was indeed a good price in the current market.

Even song Rui felt that the price was very attractive. He gently touched Xia ruofei’s arm and said in a low voice,””Ruofei, this price is right! Why don’t we just buy it ...”

But before Xia ruofei could say anything, Zhao Yongjun smiled and said,””Brother Wu, isn’t a 4 an ominous number? Don’t you always pay attention to a good deal when you do business? Lower it a little more!”

Wu shuheng smiled bitterly and said,”Yongjun, I’ve already vomited blood!” You can go out and check, 140 million is really not expensive!”

Zhao Yongjun didn’t say anything, he just smiled at Wu shuheng.

After a long while, Wu shuheng said helplessly,””Fine, fine, if I don’t lower my price a little today, you won’t agree! How about this ... Since you say 4 is unlucky, then 138 million! This should be fine, right?”

“Don’t mind me!” Zhao Yongjun said,” 38 isn’t much better than 4. Lower it a little more!”

“Yongjun, we really can’t surrender anymore ...” Wu shuheng said with a sad face.

“Brother Wu, RUO Fei and I have been through life and death together,” Zhao Yongjun said with a smile.”He’s also our family’s benefactor. My father values him a lot ...”

“Alright, alright! Hurry up and stop!” Wu shuheng quickly said,”since you’ve already said so much, I’ll lower it by another 2 million! 136 million, I really can’t go any lower ... Otherwise, if I don’t have enough funds, there’s no point in selling the house ... I might as well think of other ways to raise funds!”

Zhao Yongjun’s words lowered the price by another 4 million. This amount of money was enough to buy a big house in most second – tier cities.

Zhao Yongjun nodded in satisfaction, then smiled at Xia ruofei.””Ruofei, this price ... What do you think?”

Xia ruofei was already tempted by the price of 140 million, and after Zhao Yongjun’s haggling, Wu shuheng actually lowered it by 4 million. This was a pleasant surprise.

Hence, Xia ruofei did not hesitate. He nodded and said,””Alright! Brother Wu, brother Zhao, I’m taking this house!”

Wu shuheng heaved a long sigh of relief. The deal was finally settled. Although the price was a little lower than expected, it was still acceptable.

No matter what, at least he had some money.

“That’s great!” Wu shuheng said,”ruofei, you won’t lose anything by buying this house. Even if it’s an investment, you can make a profit by selling it as long as you’re patient!”

“Brother Wu, I bought it for myself.” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“It’s even better if you live by yourself. ” Wu shuheng laughed and asked,”by the way, how do you plan to make the deal? Do you need to apply for a bank loan?” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

If Xia ruofei were to apply for a mortgage, the bank would need time to approve the loan. To Wu shuheng, time was the most precious thing, so he was a little worried. He didn’t want to be happy for nothing.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I can’t apply for a house – buying loan in the capital.” Brother Wu, don’t worry! I’ve already prepared the money for the house, I’ll pay the full amount!”
