2234 The crisis of the Liu family (2)

He thought to himself,’could it be that the Liu family has already found out that I directed Liu haojun’s incident?’ Even if that’s the case, you can’t say that I’m related to old master Liu’s illness, right? Even if he was angry, could he get pancreatic cancer?

Moreover, the Liu family had just gone through a huge change. They were busy preparing for all kinds of rainy arrangements, so how could they have the time to pursue who was responsible?

“Of course, elder Liu’s illness has nothing to do with you,” Zhao Yongjun said, chuckling.”But ... He’s just thinking about your medical skills!”

Xia ruofei suddenly understood.

Back then, elder song was on the verge of death but Xia ruofei saved him. Not only did he recover, but his body was also much better than before. He looked better and his white hair was much less. It was no exaggeration to say that with elder song’s current condition, he could live for more than 100 years.

Although this matter was strictly confidential, it was not without any clues. With the Liu family’s ability, it was possible to find out Xia ruofei’s role in this matter.

Song Rui said from the side,”ruofei, the Liu family is also anxious now. You can’t say that they’re desperate!” They’re treating you as their last hope anyway. Yesterday, uncle Liu went to visit my grandfather in hopes of getting you to treat old man Liu ...”

“Then what did Grandpa song say?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

“The old man definitely won’t agree to it so easily! And he didn’t even admit that you were the one who cured him. ” Song Rui said with a smile,”we have to ask for your opinion on this matter. If you don’t agree, even the Liu family can’t force you!”

“Yeah!” Zhao Yongjun also laughed. With the song family as your strong backing, no one can force you to do something you don’t want to do. Besides, if anything happens to old master Liu, the Liu family won’t dare to act rashly. There are many people watching them!”

Xia ruofei nodded, deep in thought.

The Liu family had visited elder song yesterday, but no one had called him until now. This meant that elder song had suppressed the matter, and even the Liu family did not dare to disturb him.

Naturally, Xia ruofei did not want to get involved in this matter. He could not understand the complicated relationships in the four nine cities, and he did not want to understand them. This kind of thing would affect the whole situation. If he really saved old master Liu, he might offend many people without him knowing!

“Xiao Rui, what’s Grandpa song’s stance on this?” he asked after some thought.

“I don’t know!” Song Rui smiled and said,”aren’t you going to visit him in a few days? Let’s see if he’ll mention this when the time comes! Anyway, if he doesn’t mention it, you can just pretend you don’t know! In my opinion, why should we help for no reason?”

Song Rui didn’t have a good impression of the Liu family. The younger generation of the two families often fought with each other. The two families didn’t have the same political ideas. Competition in various fields was normal. It was normal for him to have such thoughts.

But Zhao Yongjun said seriously,””Xiao Rui, you can’t say such things. Moreover ... You can’t think about things so simply! You have to remember that the Liu family is the Liu family, and old master Liu is old master Liu. No matter what happened to the Liu family, old master Liu has made great contributions to our country! Whether it was during the war or during the construction period, he had made outstanding contributions!”

Zhao Yongjun then looked at Xia ruofei and smiled.””Of course, I’m not trying to influence your judgment. Ruofei, just as Xiao Rui said earlier, if elder song didn’t mention this to you, just pretend that you don’t know! But if the old man asks, uh ... And asks for your opinion, I suggest you consider it more maturely before answering. ”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”I know!” Thank you for your reminder, brother Zhao!”

Zhao Yongjun laughed and stood up,””Alright, we’ve drunk the tea and said what we needed to say. We should go back and sleep!”

“We’re leaving just like this?” Song Rui asked.

“If you don’t leave, do you still want to stay here for the night?” Zhao Yongjun laughed and said,”Xiao Rui, is it because Yiyi isn’t with you and you’re so lonely that you can’t sleep? do you want ruofei to sleep with you?”

Xia ruofei and song Rui suddenly felt a chill. Song Rui quickly stood up and said,””Big brother Zhao, can you not speak in such a disgusting manner in the future ... Let’s go! Let’s go now ...”

“Hahaha!” Zhao Yongjun couldn’t help but laugh.

Xia ruofei sent the two of them to the door and turned around to go back into the house.

He sat on the sofa in the living room and thought for a long time, but he couldn’t come up with a final decision, so he simply gave up.

After all, this matter involved a lot of people. In addition to the fact that it might affect the interests of many parties, there was also a very important point. His “medical skills” would be known by more people. At that time, if these powerful elderly people in Beijing came to him for a headache, he would have a big head.

It’s not appropriate to go or not. If I don’t go, I’ll definitely offend people. Why are you treating the song and Liu families but not me? However, if he went, there would be more and more such things in the future, and he would eventually be unable to bear the disturbance.

Since no one could find him now, he might as well wait until the recording was over.

Thinking of this, Xia ruofei got up and took a shower. Then, he sat on the bed and cultivated the “great Dao formula” for a while before he fell asleep.

The next morning, Zhao Yongjun and the others had breakfast in the courtyard and left one after another. The construction of the Xuanji paradise gathering was in full swing. They all had their own responsibilities and had been busy recently.

Qin Yanan and he Yu also left the siheyuan in Wu Qiang’s car and continued to head to the hotel where the festival Group was located to discuss some details of the recording of the program.

Xia ruofei, on the other hand, was idle. In the middle courtyard, he lay on the recliner, reading, drinking tea, and enjoying the rare slow time.

Of course, he only had a leisurely morning. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

After lunch, Xia ruofei took a short nap. Not long after he woke up, Qin Yanan and he Yu returned.

Gao Jun, the Deputy Director of xiangnan satellite TV, also came to the courtyard with them.

As soon as he entered, Gao Jun greeted him with a smile,””President Xia, I’m here uninvited. You won’t not welcome me, will you?”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment, then he smiled gently and said,””Gao tai, you must be joking. Your presence brings light to my humble dwelling!”

Gao Jun’s eyes widened exaggeratedly and he said,””President Xia! Can I take this as your fancy way of showing off your wealth? If the central area of the capital, the big siheyuan with three entrances to the front and back, is a Peng Peng Peng, then the place where people like us live is simply a cave of primitive people!”

“Hahaha! Gao tai, you’re exaggerating!” Xia ruofei said,”come on! Please come in!”

Xia ruofei let Gao Jun into the courtyard. The few of them went to the master’s courtyard in the middle and sat down around the stone table.

Qin Yanan immediately started preparing the tea. Xia ruofei saw that Qin Yanan’s movements were quite skilled and handed this task to her with ease.

“Station head Gao, when did you arrive in Beijing?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

“I just arrived this morning!” Gao Jun said,”after I got off the plane, I went to the hotel to check on the preparation work of the festival team. I happened to see manager Qin coming over to take over the work, so ... I followed the two beautiful ladies and came to visit directly!”

“So director Gao only arrived today!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it would be great if it was yesterday. Some of my good friends were having dinner at my house! That’s right, that brat Hou Liang is also here ...”

Gao Jun couldn’t help but feel a little regretful. If only he had come a day earlier. It was only natural for him to visit Xia ruofei. Then, wouldn’t he have been able to get closer to young master hou?
