Translator: 549690339

After the host and the guest had their fill, Xia ruofei personally sent Su Yu out. The Mercedes – Benz from paradise Corporation was already waiting in front of the complex.

Xia ruofei gestured to Jiang Hua, and the latter immediately understood and walked away quickly. Xia ruofei said some words of thanks to Su Yu, while Tang weiran and the others also accompanied him and chatted.

Soon, Jiang Hua came over with two plastic boxes carefully.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Uncle Su, there are two Chinese perch here. Please keep one for Auntie to try. Please pass the other one to uncle Ling. This is a small token of my appreciation.”

Su Yu looked at the plastic box in Jiang Hua’s hand, and a hint of Love appeared in his eyes. However, he still politely said,”How can I accept this? It’s too valuable ...”

He had personally handled the Chinese perch in the kitchen today. He knew that the Chinese perch in Taoyuan farm was generally about two catties. What was amazing was that the meat quality of the Chinese perch should have aged a little at this weight. This was also what he had been worried about before cooking, but the results showed that he had worried too much. This Chinese perch was obviously larger than ordinary wild Chinese perch, and the taste was even better. Moreover, the tenderness of the meat was also greater than ordinary wild Chinese perch.

This kind of rare and precious Chinese perch was worth at least a few thousand Yuan per 500 grams. It was indeed quite expensive as a gift.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”they’re all raised on my farm. They’re not worth much. It’s just a little token of my appreciation. Please don’t reject it!”

Su Yu hesitated for a moment and then said,”Alright! Then I won’t stand on ceremony with you. Thank you, little Xia!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”you already said that you’re welcome. Why are you still saying thank you?” It’s just a small token of my appreciation!”

Su Yu couldn’t help but laugh and said,”Alright, alright, alright, I’ll accept it then!”

Then, Su Yu said goodbye to Xia ruofei and the others, got in the car, and left.

After watching the Mercedes – Benz leave, Tang weiran said with emotion,””President Xia, your life here is still better! The beach, the White clouds, the farmy...Every day, we eat delicious food that we rarely get to see. It’s like living like a god!”

“Why don’t you stay for a few more days, President Tang?” Xia ruofei joked. I’ll take it as a vacation!”

“I also want to rest!” Tang Wei Ran smiled bitterly. It’s a pity that I’ve been working my a * s off. I’ve only been out for two days and there’s already a bunch of things waiting to be settled at the group!”

Tang weiran didn’t pretend to be busy. He had a lot of work to do. This time, because of Xia ruofei, a Vice President of the chain company he was directly in charge of had fallen. He had to go back to clean up the mess and stabilize the morale of the Army.

Of course, Tang weiran didn’t dare to blame Xia ruofei. Besides, Chen Weinan and Chen shun had brought this upon themselves. If they were strong enough, this incident wouldn’t have ended up like this. To put it bluntly, it was because they had a lot of bad debts in the past. This time, they were all exposed.

Xia ruofei laughed.”You can’t not let me rest even if I’m working!” He said.

“I really haven’t had a vacation in years ...” Tang weiran said.”After I finished my business here, the company is urging me to go back. I asked the administrative office to book an afternoon flight back to Beijing for me!”

“Alright, since President Tang is busy, I won’t keep you!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you’re welcome to visit the three mountains more often in the future!”

“Definitely!” Tang Wei Ran said. Our Chairman has repeatedly urged me to tell President Xia that if you go to Beijing, please contact me and give Tongren Hall a chance to be the host!” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Definitely, definitely!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

He even bought a big three – story courtyard house in the capital! Moreover, with the further growth of the Paradise Corporation, he would probably have more time to go to Beijing.

Xia ruofei personally arranged a car for Tang weiran and Zheng Xu in the afternoon, and then sent them upstairs to rest.

After sending Tang weiran back to her room, Lin Zhongming said to Xia ruofei gratefully,””Brother Xia, this time ... Forget it. I can’t thank you enough for your great kindness! Let’s see how I perform in the future!”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Big brother Lin, it’s not as serious as you say. It’s just something that happened in passing. We’re old friends and I hope to have a long – term cooperation with you. If it’s someone else, we’ll have to get to know each other again, right?”

Lin Zhongming said sincerely,”to you, it might be a small matter, but to me, it’s the grace of rebirth!” Brother Xia, you’re really nice to your friends!”

Xia ruofei smiled and patted Lin Zhongming’s shoulder, saying,””We’re partners! It’s a win – win situation!”

“Yes, yes, yes! Brother Xia, don’t worry, as long as I’m in the East China region, the cooperation between our two families will be solid!” Lin Zhongming said seriously,”even if I’m transferred one day, I’ll definitely make arrangements in advance and not let the cooperation be affected!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.

......

On the second day after Tang weiran returned to Beijing, the people arranged by Lin Zhongming from the East China region of Jiangsu and Zhejiang Province also arrived at the three mountains Paradise Farm.

This time, the transaction amount exceeded 100 million, so Lin Zhongming also attached great importance to the escort of this batch of aweto.

Not only did he inform the company’s security Department to send out elite forces, but he also hired the best escort company in Qiantang to drive a modified van to Sanshan.
