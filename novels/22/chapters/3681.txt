Chapter 3682: Giving an opportunity (1)

Translator: 549690339

Lu You had actually been observing Shen Hu’s expression all this while. Hence, after hearing Shen Hu’s vague explanation, she was even more convinced of her own guess.

She smiled and said,”since teacher doesn’t want to tell me, 1’11 ask RUO Fei myself.” 1 don’t think he would lie to me!”

Shen Hu could not help but jump in shock when he heard this and quickly said, Lu You, there’s no need to ask Xia Qian about this … Mr. Xia, don’t make things difficult for me…”

Shen Hu was so anxious that he almost said “senior Xia.”

Actually, Lu You already had some guesses in her heart. Especially after Shen Hu said that in a hurry, it made her feel that Shen Hu and Xia ruofei were hiding something from her.

And if Xia ruofei was really a golden core cultivator …

Lu You subconsciously thought of the Golden core senior who had not appeared in the capital that day.

Back then, the incident itself was very strange. However, Lu You didn’t think about it in any other way at the beginning. She just felt that it was possible that the seniors in the Golden core stage did things as they pleased.

After all, she rarely came into contact with high – Level Qi refining cultivators, let alone the legendary golden core cultivators. Naturally, she didn’t know anything about cultivators of this level.

But now that she thought about it, that ‘golden core senior’ had never appeared from the beginning to the end, but he had given her a spirit crystal and a cultivation technique.

This was too abnormal.

And if Xia ruofei was a golden core cultivator … Lu You felt that there was a reasonable explanation for many things that she did not understand in the past.

She didn’t want to make things difficult for Shen Hu, so she didn’t want to dwell on this topic anymore. However, her heart was in a great turmoil.

She did not pay any attention to Chen Nanfeng, who was shining brightly on the platform. Instead, she turned her head slightly and looked at the highest grandstand behind her. Xia ruofei was sitting there.

Lu You mumbled in her heart, ruofei, was it really you in the capital that day? Why did you hide it from me?

Lu You couldn’t help but recall the scene after she left the Paradise clubhouse that night. Back then, she had been helpless and even despaired when she was faced with the absolute difference in strength in the car.

The Jindan stage senior who suddenly attacked had saved her from the fire and water.

She had imagined the appearance of that golden core senior countless times. If that golden core senior was really Xia ruofei, that would be perfect…

On the grandstand on the top floor, Xia ruofei also felt Lu You’s gaze immediately. At his level of cultivation, even if someone were to secretly glance at him, he would be able to sense it immediately unless that person’s cultivation was much higher than his.

Xia ruofei also lowered his head and looked at Lu You.

However, Lu You was like a frightened deer. She quickly turned her head and did not dare to meet Xia ruofei’s eyes.

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. Was his face so hateful?

On the high platform on the cliff, Chen Nanfeng said in a clear voice,””Thank you, fellow Daoists, for coming to witness Nanfeng’s breakthrough. In today’s world of cultivation, which is constantly deteriorating, breaking through to the nascent Soul Stage is of great significance not only to me and the first heaven society, but also to the entire world of cultivation. I also hope that through this breakthrough, I can encourage all the fellow Daoists in the world of cultivation to not give up on themselves because of the deterioration of the environment. Only by self – improvement can one save themselves. As long as they work hard, they may possibly succeed!”

When everyone heard Chen Nanfeng’s words, they all applauded enthusiastically.

Although Chen Nanfeng’s words were a bit high – Key, it was in fact a great encouragement to everyone.

He had broken through to the Yuanying stage, which made the cultivators who attended the ceremony, especially the Golden core cultivators, see hope.

Although it would be very difficult and would consume a lot of resources, Chen Nanfeng’s success at least meant that this path had not been completely blocked. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Chen Nanfeng waited for everyone’s applause to die down a little before he continued,””Fellow Daoists, please don’t be in a hurry to leave. You’re welcome to stay in the first heaven sect for a few more days. We’ll be hosting a banquet tonight to invite all the fellow Daoists who came to attend the ceremony. Tomorrow morning, I’ll set up a Daoist Rite temple here and impart my knowledge to all the fellow Daoists who are participating for all reasons. I’ll share my comprehension of the heavenly Dao! In addition, after the Dao imparting session, the first heaven society will give everyone an opportunity. Of course, everyone will have an equal opportunity, but whether or not you can get this opportunity will depend on your own luck!”
