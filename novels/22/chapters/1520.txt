Chapter 1521: Seeing the light of day again (2)

Translator: 549690339

Very quickly, when the sound of the “dried corpse” died down, Xia ruofei felt that the pulling force had disappeared. The feeling of spatial disorder had also disappeared. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Then, he felt a piercing light and couldn’t help but squint his eyes.

The light was warm and Xia ruofei immediately understood. He had been sent outside by the senior in the coffin. This was the sunlight from the outside.

Xia ruofei had entered the underground palace in the middle of the night. He did not know how long he had been in there, but at least he had spent five to six hours breaking the stone wall array. It should be the next day by now.

Xia ruofei felt someone lying beside him. He squinted his eyes and turned around. It was Song Wei, who was unconscious.

At this moment, Xia ruofei heard a heart – wrenching voice.””Ghost!”

......

Fang laosan was a farmer from gan province. He had been working for a security company in Yuezhou for the past few years. Two months ago, he was assigned to guard mount Yu.

Fang laosan heard that this place used to be an ancient tomb, but it was later sealed off except for some problems. The government paid for a security company to send people to guard it.

His hometown was near Mount Longhu, and he had heard many stories about strange powers and gods since he was young. He was actually a little afraid of this mission.

However, the security company also took into account the harsh environment of the wilderness, so they sent people here with extra bonuses. In addition, there were several co – workers who worked with them. Fang laosan didn’t go back during the spring Festival. He wanted to make more money to demolish and rebuild his old house at the end of the year, so after weighing the pros and cons, he still had the courage to come to Yushan.

After a period of guarding, nothing happened, and Fang laosan gradually dispelled his fear.

They patrolled by themselves during the day and only patrolled in groups at night.

Today, it was his turn to patrol the vicinity of the ancient tomb. As soon as he turned around a small hill, he saw two pale – faced people lying on the blocked entrance of the ancient tomb. Their bodies were also stained with blood.

Fang laosan’s hair stood on end, and he felt as if all the blood in his body was rushing to his head.

Even if it was broad daylight, Fang laosan was still scared out of his wits when he saw this scene. He had just patrolled this place three minutes ago, but he had not seen a single person. How could two people appear out of thin air after he had just made a round?

Moreover, they were at the entrance of the ancient tomb, and their faces were completely pale. They looked like ghosts!

Fang laosan howled and frantically ran away.

The security guards who were not on patrol duty heard Fang laosan’s wailing and rushed out of the mobile house.

When they saw Fang laosan’s pale face, they all went up to ask about the situation.

Fang laosan couldn’t even say a complete sentence. He just kept mumbling,”damn it ... Damn it ...”

In the end, under everyone’s comfort and questioning, Fang laosan finally told them what he had just seen with lingering fear.

No one believed him and thought that Fang laosan was being paranoid, so they suggested going out to check it out.

Fang laosan was not willing to go there again. The security guards had no choice but to ask for the location and came to the hill together.

As expected, they didn’t even see a ghost. This made everyone think that Fang laosan was hallucinating because he was too nervous.

The security guards all thought it was a farce and returned to the mobile house one after another.

What they didn’t expect was that Fang laosan had already packed his luggage and called the head of security, asking for a change of position. If he couldn’t change, he would resign and not even ask for his salary for the past few days.

The security guards watched as Fang laosan left the station with his luggage without looking back. They couldn’t help but look at each other, and they felt a little scared.

......

Xia ruofei didn’t know that he had been mistaken for a ghost, a malicious ghost that could appear in broad daylight.

After he was discovered by the security guard, he immediately carried the unconscious Song Wei on his back and quickly ran into the forest.

Xia ruofei looked at the group of security guards who came to check on the situation from afar. After they left with nothing, he carried Song Wei on his back and went around to the entrance to the underground palace that they had cleared out last night.

The rope was still quietly hanging down the hole. Xia ruofei looked at the dark hole but did not have the courage to go down again.

He placed Song Wei under a tree and let her lie flat. Then, he untied the rope and threw it into the hole. He took out a shovel and quickly filled up the hole. Finally, he found some branches and weeds to cover up the traces.

He believed that as long as there was a heavy rain in the next few days, and the weeds here grew again, even if someone came here again, they would not be able to see anything.

After settling everything, Xia ruofei looked at Song Wei, who seemed to be in a deep sleep, and felt worried.

The old senior in the coffin didn’t finish his sentence. He didn’t know how to wake Song Wei up.

Xia ruofei knew that it was hard to recover from damage to the soul. Even if he went to the best hospital and used the best equipment for a check – up, there would be no problem with his body. However, he would remain unconscious.

That senior had said that their lineage was very good at nurturing the soul, but he had only cultivated the “great Dao Arts.” How would he know how to nurture the soul?

Just as Xia ruofei was scratching his head, he heard a chirping sound.

Xia ruofei turned around and realized that the White realm Fox was following him.

This little guy was probably sent out of the underground palace by that senior. It was just that Xia ruofei had been discovered by someone and was in a hurry to bring Song Wei away. Moreover, the realm Fox’s target was very small, so he did not notice it at all.

Xia ruofei did not expect this little guy to follow him.

Xia Qing had also reminded Xia ruofei that this white – colored world Fox was naturally a pet of space. Furthermore, it had a unique ability in finding world stones.

Hence, Xia ruofei’s heart skipped a beat. He asked,””Little guy, you’ve been sent out too? If you don’t have a place to go, why don’t you follow me?”

The white fox stared at Xia ruofei for a while. It liked the aura that Xia ruofei exuded after he had cultivated the “great Dao technique”. More importantly, Xia ruofei seemed to have a very profound spatial fluctuation, which made it want to get closer to him.

Therefore, after pondering for a moment, the white fox nodded.

The realmspirit agreed so readily that Xia ruofei felt a little surprised. Previously, in the underground palace, when they were splitting the realm stone, both parties did not give in an inch. This realmspirit did not seem to be so easy to talk to!

Hence, Xia ruofei tried again.””Then you’ll be in charge of searching for the world stones in the future. We’ll retrieve them together, and we’ll split the harvest 50 – 50. How about it?”

The realm Fox chirped twice, but still nodded its head readily.

Xia ruofei was in disbelief. He was well aware of how attractive the world stone was to the White realm Fox, yet it had agreed to a 50 – 50 split so easily?

One must know that without the realm Fox’s detection ability, Xia ruofei’s search for the realm stone would be like looking for a needle in a haystack. Moreover, not every place with a realm stone would encounter such a huge obstacle like the underground palace.

In that case, the realm Fox would be at a loss if they split it 50 – 50.

“You’re not planning something, right?” Xia ruofei looked at the Fox and asked.

A look of disdain flashed across the eyes of the realm Fox. It squeaked twice, turned around, and was about to leave.

“Wait!” Xia ruofei quickly shouted. Wait a minute! I’m just saying, why are you so angry?”

The white fox stopped in its tracks and turned to look at Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei laughed drily and said,””Then you’ll be by my side from now on! If we find a world stone, we’ll work together to excavate it. We’ll split it 50 – 50 according to our agreement!”

The white fox nodded with a look of disdain. It walked to Xia ruofei’s side and lay on the ground lazily.

After Xia ruofei and the white fox reached a gentleman’s agreement, he started to worry about Song Wei’s situation.

Nurturing the soul ... Could it be? Xia ruofei suddenly had an idea.
