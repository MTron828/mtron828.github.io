2386 The intention to kill (1)

The rag doll was originally placed at the corner of the table and was not eye – catching at all.

However, when Bason’s blood landed on the doll, the doll suddenly emitted a dark glow. The White doll was covered in blood and looked terrifying under the glow.

Immediately after, the cloth doll’s eyes suddenly turned green and it let out a demonic cry. Then, the White cloth that was stained with blood suddenly shattered, revealing the red and white flesh inside.

This lump of flesh was as fast as lightning and pounced in Xia ruofei’s direction.

Xia ruofei, who was initially teasing the doll, suddenly turned cold and murderous when the doll changed.

Ghost child!

Xia ruofei’s spiritual power was very strong. Even though the surroundings were covered by the poisonous insects, he could still sense the “cloth doll” ‘s condition.

How was this a rag doll! It was clearly a dead baby that had been refined! And from its appearance, it was very likely that it had been killed before it had a mother, and then refined with a secret technique.

“You should die!” Xia ruofei spat out these three cold words.

In the next moment, Xia ruofei’s body shone brightly. The poisonous snakes and insects around him were all sent flying in all directions. They hit the walls around him and left behind a shocking trail of blood.

Xia ruofei merely released his vital energy and the poisonous insects and snakes were all killed in an instant.

At this moment, the ghost child had already reached Xia ruofei. Its green eyes were fixed on Xia ruofei, and a few baby teeth could be seen in its mouth.

When Xia ruofei was reading the books about cultivation left behind in the jade pendant, he had seen anecdote about the Nanjiang sorcerers. In fact, the sorcerers in Southeast Asia and Huaxia’s Nanjiang were of the same line, and many of their cultivation methods were similar.

In the book that Xia ruofei had read, there were records of dark tame head sorcerers refining ghost children. These evil tame head sorcerers would often find pregnant women who were about to give birth and use cruel methods to kill them, resulting in two lives.

As a result, the pregnant woman had suffered inhuman torture before her death and had a lot of resentment. The fetus was about to descend into the human world, but it lost its life at the last moment. It was also filled with resentment.

The resentment of the two would eventually be concentrated on the fetus.

The black tame Head Master began to use a secret technique to refine the fetus, turning it into a ghost child with heavy resentment.

Although the fetus that was made into a ghost child would not continue to grow, its hair and teeth would continue to grow as if it was alive.

Xia ruofei looked at the teeth in the ghost child’s mouth and knew that it had been refined for a long time.

Such an evil black cursed sorcerer was naturally someone everyone wanted to kill.

Xia ruofei originally wanted to drag Ong into the medium to do hard labor, but after seeing the ghost child, he changed his mind. He wanted to kill Ong.

Besides, even without the ghost child, Xia ruofei was disgusted by the fact that Bason and the other black sorcerers had poisonous insects and snakes on them. Some of them were even hidden in their bodies. If he really brought him into the space, what would he do if he brought these disgusting things in?

With Xia ruofei’s absolute control of space, even if he brought a few snakes in, he could get rid of them in time. However, that feeling was disgusting!

After the ghost child appeared, Xia ruofei had no intention of letting Ong live.

It would be a crime to let such an evil person live for even a minute longer!

Xia ruofei did not hesitate when he saw the ghost child pouncing at him. He immediately drew out the blue immortal sword that he had been nurturing in his dantian.

The sword light shuttled back and forth like a dragon. In the blink of an eye, it had slashed at the ghost child more than ten times. When the flying sword returned to Xia ruofei, there was not even a trace of blood on it. It was still pure and flawless.

The ghost child’s momentum was suddenly halted, and then it directly broke into a dozen pieces.

Then, with a bang, the ghost child’s body suddenly exploded!

An invisible shield suddenly appeared around Xia ruofei. The flying flesh and the pungent black blood did not even touch the corner of Xia ruofei’s clothes. They splattered all over the house.

The black blood on the ghost child’s body, in particular, sizzled when it came into contact with the furniture and floor. A large piece of the furniture was corroded away.

Xia ruofei was not surprised because he knew that when the dark descendent master was refining a ghost child, he would usually use a variety of poisons. After the refining was completed, the ghost child was actually a collection of poisons. Ordinary people would die if they were to be touched by it.

Although the ghost child looked like a baby, Xia ruofei did not hesitate at all because he knew very well that the baby had died before it could leave its mother’s body. Now, it was only refined by the evil Dark Descent master into this state. In fact, it had already lost its life.

Even if the ghost child had its own consciousness, Xia ruofei believed that it would not want to continue suffering like this. Killing it would be a relief to it.

After taking care of the ghost child, Xia ruofei stomped on the ground and shot towards bassoon like a bolt of lightning.

Ong didn’t expect that not only would the poisonous snakes and insects have no effect, but even the ghost child he used as his trump card couldn’t hurt the other party at all. At this time, he was already a little panicked.

Bason raised his hand and threw a cloud of yellow smoke at Xia ruofei when he saw Xia ruofei charging at him.

Xia ruofei snorted.”Small tricks!”

With a wave of his hand, the cloud of smoke dissipated without a trace. His speed didn’t slow down at all, and in the blink of an eye, he was in front of Bason.

Xia ruofei didn’t waste any time. He immediately released his majestic spiritual power and crushed it towards Bason.

Bason seemed to be slightly stronger than Metatron and Boak. He was able to resist the spiritual attacks instinctively.

However, Xia ruofei could even defeat a real cultivator, Manzila, with his spiritual power. How could he not defeat a black tame head sorcerer who had only touched the surface of cultivation?

He only slightly increased the intensity of his mental power, and Bason’s instinctive resistance was crushed.

After a short two to three seconds, Bason’s eyes turned blank as he fell into a Deep State of hypnosis.

“After the dark shadow Squad failed in their mission to assassinate song Qiming, did you send any other teams to carry out the mission?” Xia ruofei asked coldly.

“No, I didn ‘t,” Bason’s eyes were empty as he said,”the rule of the Morde organization is that once the mission fails, the deposit will not be returned and they will not send people to continue the mission.”

“Did the other party place a new order for this mission?” Xia ruofei asked.

“Not at the moment.” Ong replied.

Xia ruofei finally heaved a sigh of relief. At least for now, song Qiming was safe.

As for whether Liu haojun would entrust this task to another assassin organization, it was hard to say. Anyway, when Xia ruofei returned to the country, the first thing he would do was to deal with Liu haojun. When the time came, he would know the answer by asking.

“Tell me about the organization structure of the dark shadow Squad. How many people do you have, where do you usually hide, and how do you contact each other?” Xia ruofei said,”in short, tell me everything about the dark shadow Squad in detail!”

“Yes!” Ong said.

Then he spoke without hesitation, spilling all the secrets of mord’s Shadow Squad without holding back.

According to bassoon’s confession, the dark shadow Squad had about a hundred people and could form about 20 operation teams at the same time.

Of course, the members of these operation teams were not completely fixed. They might be relatively fixed during normal times so that they could cooperate better when carrying out missions. The members would often be adjusted according to the needs of the specific mission.

For example, when he went to China to assassinate song Qiming, Bason had specially selected members from East Asia. These people not only looked similar to Chinese but also knew simple Chinese. They would be of great help when they carried out missions in China.

In addition, due to the special nature of this task, the members of the dark shadow Squad were scattered all over the place. Of course, most of them were active in Africa, and only after receiving a mission would they go to the other continents.

Moreover, among the members of the dark shadow Squad, other than relatively fixed squads and people who had carried out missions with them, many people didn’t know each other, let alone contact each other on a daily basis.

As the leader of the dark shadow Squad, Bason knew the situation of every member and was able to contact them. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

After Xia ruofei heard bassoon’s confession, he frowned.

These assassins were all scattered outside, so it was too difficult to catch them all in one fell swoop.

Although Xia ruofei could get the list of names and their hiding places from bassoon, there were nearly a hundred people, and almost all of them were in different cities and countries. If Xia ruofei were to find and capture them one by one, it would take more than a day or two.

“Ong, do you have a way to gather everyone in the dark shadow Squad in Usuda?” Xia ruofei asked after a moment of silence.

“If you encounter an emergency, you can post a code on the internet.” Ong said,”our team members check it every day. After they see the code, they will rush to the designated location within 24 hours. Of course, it’s impossible for everyone to be here, because some of them are still out on a mission, while some of them may be on vacation in a place thousands of miles away. It’s impossible for these people to come back in time. ”

“That works too! So what if a few missed out! It’s better than me going to every house!” Xia ruofei muttered to himself.
