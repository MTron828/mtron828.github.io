3267 Space life (2)

It was very quiet in the spaceship. Everyone was cultivating in the cabin behind them. There was only the dim light of the display screen and the muffled sound of the cooling fan in the cockpit.

Xia ruofei said to Ling Qingxue,”Qingxue, why don’t you sleep for a while?” Or you can just cultivate for a while. It’s too boring to stay here!”

Ling Qingxue had been leaning sideways in front of the Oval – shaped porthole of the spaceship. When she heard Xia ruofei’s words, she did not get up. She said without turning her head,””I don’t want to sleep yet! The scenery outside is so beautiful!”

Xia ruofei turned his head and looked out of the porthole. They could see the huge outline of earth from this angle.

The blue Earth was like a gem. Although they couldn’t see the entire earth, the shock they felt was even stronger.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”let’s rest for a while!” In the next ten days, you’ll see the same scenery. No matter how beautiful it is, you’ll get tired of it soon!”

“I know!” Ling Qingxue said,”but I can’t help but want to see it!”

Then, Ling Qingxue said,””I would never have dreamed that I would one day go into space and look back at the home that gave birth to human beings ... Ruofei, my life has become so wonderful after meeting you ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”the most exciting things are always in the future!” This is only the beginning!”

Xia ruofei stretched his back and said,””Qingxue, I’ll take a nap for a while. Call me if anything happens!”

“Mm! You can sleep!” Ling Qingxue said.

Xia ruofei put his hands in his pockets and closed his eyes.

In such a weightless environment, the sleeping posture was not important. It was the same even if he was standing upside down.

Of course, there was no up and down in a weightless environment, so there was no such thing as handstands. Everything was relative.

However, it was best to keep both hands on the body. This was also specifically mentioned in the spacecraft operation manual.

The reason was simple. When a person was unconscious after falling asleep, their hands would naturally float in the air. When a person woke up and saw his hands floating in front of him like a zombie, he would definitely be shocked.

In fact, in a weightless environment, people would lose their sense of direction, and the body fluid would also be redistributed. This was also the reason why many astronauts had swollen faces in space, so there was actually quite a big difference compared to on the ground. Especially for people who were in space for the first time, they would feel very uncomfortable and not easy to fall asleep.

However, to Xia ruofei and the other cultivators, this little bit of discomfort was nothing. It was easy to overcome.

Hence, Xia ruofei quickly fell asleep.

He opened his eyes after a few hours of sleep and subconsciously turned his head to take a look.

Xia ruofei realized that Ling Qingxue, who was beside him, was not sleepy at all. He could not help but rub his eyes and said,””Qingxue, are you really not tired?”

“I’m not sleepy at all!” Ling Qingxue turned around and smiled.”You’re awake? How was your sleep?”

“It’s pretty good!” Xia ruofei replied,”I don’t think it’s any different from the ground. I fell asleep as soon as I lay down ...”

Xia ruofei looked at his watch and said, “It’s FiveO’ clock in the morning in China! Qingxue, are you hungry? Do you want to eat something?”

Ling Qingxue thought for a moment and said,”sure!” It’s time for breakfast!” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei unbuckled his seat belt and said,””Wait for me! I’ll go wash up and then we’ll eat together!”

The simplest thing on the ground, brushing teeth and washing face, would become a difficult thing in space. The main reason was that in a weightless environment, liquid was floating in balls. If it splattered everywhere, it could easily cause danger such as short circuits.

It was the same for eating. In the early days, space food was made into a paste and stored in a toothpaste – like container. The process of eating was to squeeze the “toothpaste” into the mouth. Although it had improved later on, it was still a very troublesome matter on the whole.

However, it was much easier for cultivators.

As long as he used his mental power to bind the liquid, they would be obedient and would not run around.

Xia ruofei came to a special cabin. This small cabin was equivalent to a “men’s bathroom”. Washing up and going to the toilet were done in this cabin. There were two such small cabins at the two ends of the spaceship mass, and the other one was naturally the “women’s bathroom.”

He took out a small bucket of spirit pool water from the spirit map space. After the bucket of water was taken out, it immediately turned into a floating ball of water.

However, under the restraint of Xia ruofei’s spiritual power, the water ball did not go out of control and obediently hovered in the air.

Xia ruofei opened his mouth and sucked in a mouthful of water. Then, he gargled and spat the water out. The water that he had gargled with was bound by his spiritual power and floated to the side.

Then, Xia ruofei squeezed some toothpaste onto a normal toothbrush and started brushing his teeth.

During the process of brushing his teeth, some foam would inevitably fly out, but he used his mental power to restrain it so that not a trace of it would dissipate.

The process of him brushing his teeth was basically the same as when he was on the ground. The only difference was that after brushing his teeth, there was an extra ball of wastewater.

Xia ruofei kept the unused spirit pool water back into the spirit map space. Then, he took out a sealed bag and locked the wastewater in it before throwing it into the spirit map space.

Cultivators like them had a great advantage over ordinary people when they used spaceships, and that was that almost no garbage would be produced inside the spaceships. The garbage produced could be directly sealed and stored in storage magical treasures.

Since it wouldn’t produce garbage, there was naturally no need for a device to deal with garbage and waste, and there was no need to calculate the load of the garbage, which reduced the burden on the spacecraft a lot.

After brushing his teeth, Xia ruofei started to wash his face.

Washing his face was even easier. He directly used his spiritual power to control it, draw water in the spirit map space, wring a towel, and then take out the towel to wash his face.

Similarly, the small amount of water droplets that escaped could be directly bound with spiritual power and stored back into the spirit map space.

Xia ruofei washed up quickly and pulled on some of the handheld devices in the spaceship, floating back to the cockpit.

He was getting more and more familiar with moving in zero gravity.

“You should go wash your face too!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’ll just watch over here!”

Ling Qingxue nodded and got up to stretch. She then left the cockpit and went to the “women’s bathroom” at the back to wash up.

When Ling Qingxue returned, Xia ruofei took out some food from the spirit map space.

After all, they were in space, so they naturally couldn’t cook and fry like they did on the ground. It was relatively simple for everyone to eat.

Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue chose a simple sandwich and milk for breakfast.

Even though the spacecraft had reduced a lot of equipment, the microwave was still there. Xia ruofei heated the sandwich in the microwave and then ate breakfast with Ling Qingxue.

The milk was also normal milk in a box. It was impossible to suck it directly in zero gravity because there was no atmospheric pressure outside. However, they still used a straw, but they used their mental power to push the milk into the straw.

It was inevitable that some food residue would be produced while eating the sandwich. However, with Xia ruofei around, Ling Qingxue did not have to worry so much. She could just eat heartily. Xia ruofei would naturally use his spiritual power to collect all the food residue and put them into a sealed bag.

After breakfast, the two of them even “extravagantly” brushed their teeth again.

...

They then stayed in the cockpit for another two hours before Willow brought Yu xiner to the cockpit. They would be in charge of the cockpit for the rest of the day.
