Chapter 881: Division Chief Cao (2)

Translator: 549690339

“Deputy Mayor he, are you really that stupid or are you just playing dumb?” yang Jianren immediately mocked. Your so – called distinguished guest is just a small boss who grows vegetables in the countryside. How can this country bumpkin be compared to director Cao?”

“Yeah!” He Dong also took the opportunity to say. I even did business with this boss Xia before! He only managed to get orders worth a few thousand Yuan because of our boss’s daughter’s nepotism ...”

After he Dong finished speaking, he stared at Xia ruofei with a look of satisfaction and thought to himself,”Surnamed Xia, to think that you would have such a day!

In the beginning, he had coveted Ling Qingxue’s beauty and the Ling family’s wealth. He had launched a fierce pursuit of Ling Qingxue, but Ling Qingxue had not given him any face. Instead, she had favored Xia ruofei. This had already distorted his mentality.

Later on, the Ling family had fired he Dong for Xia ruofei, completely cutting off his last hope of becoming the son – in – Law of the Ling family and inheriting Ling Xiaotian’s family fortune.

Thus, he Dong hated Xia ruofei to the core.

After he was kicked out of the Ling family, he didn’t leave the three mountains. Instead, he thought of all sorts of ways to get close to the “big tree” that was yang Jianren. He dreamed that one day, he would return all the humiliation he had suffered back then, never to return.

However, he Dong didn’t think that the reason he was fired by Ling Xiaotian was because he often took advantage of others in his work. What was even more excessive was that he almost shut out paradise vegetables, which could save Ling Ji’s restaurant, for his own personal reasons.

In some people’s eyes, they were always right. If they were wrong, it was the fault of others.

He Dong was this kind of extremely narrow – minded villain.

However, yang Jianren and he Dong didn’t notice that when he Feng said “Mr. Xia”, Guangzhi Cao’s pupils couldn’t help but shrink. He immediately turned his eyes to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei didn’t avoid his gaze. He looked back at Guangzhi Cao with a smile.

Guangzhi Cao’s mind was spinning. He knew that he Feng had been helping Xia ruofei with the admission of his friend’s child under his boss’s orders.

Since the Secretary had personally instructed it, the efficiency must have been extremely high. It should have been completed by today.

With he Feng’s political sense, it was a must for him to invite Xia ruofei to a banquet and take the opportunity to get closer to him.

Therefore, Guangzhi Cao immediately thought that this Mr. Xia must be the Xia ruofei he had contacted yesterday.

Hence, a smile slowly appeared on his originally calm face as he walked towards Xia ruofei.

“Chief Cao, I don’t know what kind of magic potion Deputy District head he was given, but he actually called this ‘farmer entrepreneur’ young master Xia!” I don’t even know where this young master is from, hahaha ...”

Guangzhi Cao’s face slightly changed. He turned his head and scolded in a low voice,”Shut up!”

Yang Jianren was stunned. What was going on?

Guangzhi Cao had always been a low – Key and humble person. Even after he became the Secretary, he was still the same. Why would he suddenly turn against him?

Yang Jianren thought that his performance just now was pretty good, and he didn’t think that he had offended Guangzhi Cao in any way. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Guangzhi Cao walked quickly towards Xia ruofei after he had scolded yang Jianren.

Xia ruofei knew Guangzhi Cao’s identity, so he couldn’t just sit there. He stood up.

Guangzhi Cao was still a few steps away when he reached out his hand to Xia ruofei and said,””Brother Xia!”

Xia ruofei shook hands with Guangzhi and said,””Brother Cao, I didn’t expect to meet you under such circumstances! If I knew you were coming, I would have asked Mayor he to give up the room ...”

The private room suddenly fell silent. Except for he Feng, who was still calm, everyone was stunned.

Yang Jianren, he Dong, and the others stood rooted to the ground like statuettes. Their mouths were so wide open that a light bulb could practically be stuffed in.

Wasn’t he a farmer in the suburbs? How could he be so close to director Cao? Yang Jianren had a big question mark in his heart. At the same time, thinking of what he had just said, he couldn’t help but sweat on his forehead.

He Dong’s mind was in a mess. He had thought that Xia ruofei was going to suffer a big loss this time. After offending these rich and powerful people, the small farm would close down in an instant. He didn’t expect that after director Cao’s arrival, the situation would have a huge reversal.

He Dong’s mind was in a mess, and he almost lost the ability to think. He just stared blankly at Xia ruofei and Cao Guangzhi, who were having a good conversation.

President Zheng and he Feng heaved a sigh of relief at the same time. The two of them were relieved of a huge burden in their hearts.

Guangzhi Cao waved his hand and said,”Brother Xia, you’re scolding me! I wouldn’t dare to snatch your brother Xia’s room. ”

Guangzhi Cao’s words almost made yang Jianren fall to the ground. This uncouth – looking young man was so powerful? Even Secretary Cao had to be so polite to him?

He didn’t know that Guangzhi Cao had the same thoughts as he Feng, thinking about how to befriend Xia ruofei!

After all, Guangzhi Cao had just become song Qiming’s Secretary and had no foundation. On the other hand, Xia ruofei had a close relationship with song Qiming. They were two completely different concepts.

To put it bluntly, Guangzhi Cao wouldn’t have gotten this opportunity if it weren’t for the fact that he couldn’t transfer his Secretary along with the leaders.

He was just a Secretary randomly picked by song Qiming. In other words, he was still under probation. It was no exaggeration to say that if he offended Xia ruofei, he could be replaced at any time as long as Xia ruofei mentioned it to song Qiming.

After all, Guangzhi Cao had just been appointed to the position, and he didn’t have any relationship with the higher – ups.

The only possibility for a Secretary who was replaced after taking office for a few days was that he was placed in Qingshui Yamen and was idle. As long as song Qiming was in San Shan, no one would use him.

So, Guangzhi Cao only wanted to be on good terms with Xia ruofei. He had heard all the mean things that yang Jianren had said, and he was filled with hatred towards yang Jianren.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”brother Cao, you’re being too serious!” I’m just a commoner, but you’re a division – Level officer!”

“Brother Xia, don’t make fun of me ...” Guangzhi Cao said with a bitter smile.

Guangzhi Cao continued,”I said I’d buy you a drink yesterday!” I think it’s better to do it today than today. I’ll make a toast to you in the name of District Mayor he! District head he, you don’t mind, do you?”

“Of course I don’t mind. Director Cao is an important guest that I can’t even invite!” He Feng quickly said.

He wasn’t exaggerating at all. Guangzhi Cao was the most popular person in the three mountains government. There would probably be a long line of people waiting to treat him to a meal. If it wasn’t for Xia ruofei, he wouldn’t have been able to invite Guangzhi as the vice mayor.

He could drink and chat with Xia ruofei, and also have the opportunity to drink with Secretary Cao at the same table. Such a good thing was naturally what he Feng wanted.

When yang Jianren heard this, he couldn’t help but feel anxious. He quickly said,”C – Director Cao, I’ve already arranged lunch for you ...”

He was trying to remind Guangzhi Cao that he had come to meet him at noon!

Guangzhi Cao looked at Jianren yang indifferently, and said in a cold tone,”Mr. Yang, I’m sorry! As you can see, I just met an old friend. We still have important work to talk about at noon. Let’s meet again next time!”

Yang Jianren’s heart skipped a beat. He knew that his rude words to Xia ruofei had made the Secretary unhappy. He didn’t know who this Mr. Xia was. How could Secretary Cao treat him like Secretary song? it was unbelievable.

Yang Jianren didn’t know what to do for a moment. He said subconsciously,””Director Cao, I ...”

“Mr. Yang, don’t you understand what I’m saying?” Guangzhi Cao’s tone became even colder.”Or are you trying to force me to attend the banquet?”
