2992 Getting his wish (2)

These items were eye – opening for Xia ruofei. He had never heard of many of them before. Although he did not intend to compete for them, he still looked at them with great interest.

Although these items had their own unique characteristics, Xia ruofei also noticed that the cultivators with the earlier box numbers rarely bid. He felt that everyone was waiting for an item to appear, and it would probably cause a fierce competition.

The good show was yet to come.

Hence, Xia ruofei was not in a hurry to use his spiritual stones. He was also curious about what treasure everyone was fighting for.

Even after paying the 50000 spiritual stones, Xia ruofei could still use nearly 110000 spiritual stones. He believed that he had the ability to compete.

As a result, although he was quite interested in a few of the previous items, he still held back and did not rashly make a move.

Of course, this was also because none of these items could make his eyes light up and make him want to buy them at all costs.

An hour passed by quickly. Xia ruofei’s phone, which he had set an alarm on in advance, rang on the coffee table.

Shao Qingyang had personally seen Xia ruofei set the alarm, so when the alarm went off, he very consciously closed the manuscript and said with a smile,””I’m very grateful for fellow Daoist Xia and sect leader Luo’s generosity. I’ve read the contents of the first volume of the ‘truth of the glittering jewel’. Although it’s for Qi refining cultivators, golden core cultivators can also benefit greatly from it!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Sect leader Shao, you have wasted some time on our deal. You can look at it for a few more minutes. It’s okay.”

Shao Qingyang laughed and waved his hand,””No need, no need. An hour is enough. I’ve already watched it several times.”

There wasn’t much content in a hand – written volume. Shao Qingyang spent half an hour to memorize most of it. The rest was just to repeat it to deepen his impression.

Since he had already memorized everything, Shao Qingyang naturally did not care about the few minutes. He also did not want to give Xia ruofei the impression that he was haggling over every single thing.

Hearing this, Xia ruofei did not force him. He gave Luo Qingfeng a look, and Luo Qingfeng immediately understood and walked forward to keep the manuscript.

“Fellow Daoist Xia, sect leader Luo, please take a seat for a moment,” Shao Qingyang said with a smile.”I’ll go and retrieve the Rings of the phoenixes, then invite sect leader mu over.”

“I’ll have to trouble you, sect leader Shao!” Xia ruofei smiled.

After a while, Xia ruofei heard a knock on the door, followed by Shao Qingyang’s voice,””Fellow Daoist Xia, it’s me, Shao Qingyang!”

“Please enter!” Xia ruofei said in a clear voice.

Shao Qingyang pushed open the private room’s door and brought three people in. Xia ruofei and Luo Qingfeng’s gazes naturally fell on the three people.

Xia ruofei and Luo Qingfeng looked at each other, and Luo Qingfeng nodded slightly.

He was trying to confirm Mu Sheng’s identity. As sect leaders of the same sect, Luo Qingfeng had naturally dealt with Mu Sheng before, so he could recognize at a glance that this was indeed the sect leader of the Canglang sect in the southwest.

With a warm smile on his face, Shao Qingyang said,””Daoist Xia, sect leader Luo, let me introduce you. This is the sect leader of the surging waves sect, Daoist Mu Sheng. He’s the one who entrusted us to auction the flying Phoenix ring. This is fellow Daoist mu Hua, elder of the surging waves sect, and this young friend is the son of sect leader mu, mu Jiansheng!”

Mu Sheng laughed and stepped forward,””Fellow Daoist Xia’s performance at this auction was truly astonishing! Nice to meet you!”

Mu Sheng should be in his 70s, but he looked very energetic. Although the surging waves sect specialized in water – based martial arts, Mu Sheng’s figure was a little short and strong, especially his thick beard, which gave people a very rough feeling. His voice was also very loud, which completely overturned Xia ruofei’s preconceived judgment.

On the other hand, mu Jianfei, the young sect leader of the surging waves sect, looked like a frail gentleman. He seemed to be less than thirty years old. He had a slender figure and a slightly pale face, but he still had the temperament of an elegant young master. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

When Mu Sheng greeted Xia ruofei, mu Jianfei stood quietly at the side, but he also showed a friendly smile to Xia ruofei.

Mu Sheng and mu Jianfei should have quite a big age difference. It could be said that they had a son at an old age. However, it was obvious that mu Jianfei’s upbringing was much better than Wu Ming’s in room 15. At least, he gave Xia ruofei a good first impression.

Xia ruofei smiled.”You’re too kind, sect leader mu. I’ve long heard of you.”

Shao Qingyang laughed and said,”let’s not flatter each other. Let’s just get straight to the point!” How about we each take what we need?”

“That’s what I was thinking!” Mu Sheng said with a smile.

“Sure!” Xia ruofei nodded.

“Sect leader MU’s character is well – known in the world of cultivation, and fellow Daoist Xia is also a man of his word. You two should settle the deal!” Shao Qingyang said. I still have some matters to attend to, so I’ll take my leave! That’s right ... I’ve already decided to waive the Commission for this order. Fellow Daoist Xia just needs to pay all the spirit stones to sect leader mu. ”

Shao Qingyang was in a hurry to memorize the contents of the first volume of the “true understanding of the glittering jewel”.

He had just recited it a few times, and now was the time when his memory was the most profound. Naturally, he had to seize the time to record it down. Otherwise, if his memory started to blur, it would lead to some mistakes in the record. It would really be a pity for such a good cultivation technique.

Perhaps his disciples might even encounter danger while cultivating!

Therefore, Shao Qingyang didn’t dare to delay. He didn’t even wait for Xia ruofei and Mu Sheng to complete their transaction before he excused himself and left.

Xia ruofei naturally knew why Shao Qingyang was in such a hurry to leave. He smiled and nodded,””Please help yourself, sect leader Shao!”

Shao Qingyang cupped his hands at everyone and left in a hurry.

Mu Sheng took out the pair of rings and placed them on the coffee table in front of the sofa. Then he said,””Fellow Daoist Xia, I’m sure you know that I’m in urgent need of firecloud pills, so ...”

“Understood!” Xia ruofei replied with a smile.

After that, he took out a porcelain bottle from the space and handed it to Mu Sheng,””Sect leader mu can examine it personally. You can even let your son take one on the spot!”

Mu Sheng quickly took the porcelain bottle as if he had obtained a treasure. Then, he couldn’t wait to open the stopper. He first put it to his nose and sniffed it carefully, then carefully poured out a fire cloud pill that was completely red.

Mu Sheng held the fire cloud pill in his palm and observed it carefully. The joy on his face grew more and more intense.

In the end, Mu Sheng put the fire cloud pill back into the porcelain bottle, carefully closed the bottle stopper, and then said,””Fire cloud pills that are close to perfect quality! And it was not an antique excavated from the ruins of ancient cultivators! Fellow Daoist Xia really knows how to concoct the firecloud pill!”

Xia ruofei smiled and did not say anything. He neither admitted nor denied Mu Sheng’s words.

“Sect leader mu,” Luo Qingfeng said.”Does this mean that you acknowledge the quality of the firecloud pills?” Then there’s no problem with the deal?”

“No problem!” Mu Sheng said very readily,”the Phoenix ring is yours! However, I still have a presumptuous request ...”

“Please speak, sect leader mu.” Xia ruofei said calmly.

“Fei ‘er’s meridians are seriously injured. Although the quality of the firecloud pills provided by fellow Daoist Xia is quite good, I’m afraid that five firecloud pills are not enough to heal Fei’ er’s meridians, so ...” Mu Sheng said very sincerely,”I would like to ask fellow Daoist Xia to trade a few more firecloud pills with us. The price is negotiable!”

Hearing this, Xia ruofei pondered and said,””I only have these five firecloud pills with me now. If sect leader mu needs them, you might have to wait for a while ...”

“No problem!” Mu Sheng said without hesitation,”Fei ‘er will need time to absorb and refine these five firecloud pills! Fellow Daoist Xia, I’d like to purchase five more firecloud pills from you at the price of one thousand spirit stones per pill. Is that alright?”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and then nodded.”No problem! Sect leader mu, let’s finish the deal first!”

With that, Xia ruofei took out another 50000 spiritual stones from the medium and placed it on the floor of the private room.
