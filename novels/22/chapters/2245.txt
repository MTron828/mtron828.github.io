2246 Delicious food and fine wine (2)

“Alright!” Xia ruofei stood up and said,”I brought a few bottles of wine in my suitcase. I was afraid of breaking the rules and didn’t take them out! In that case ... Wait a moment, I’ll go get the wine!”

“President Xia, just let Pengpeng go and get it!” He Jiong said hurriedly.

“No need, no need!” Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”he can’t find it. Don’t mess up my suitcase again ... I’ll go by myself!”

Of course, he wasn’t afraid of messing up the box, but there was no wine in the box at all. He still needed to take it out from the spirit map space.

Xia ruofei walked through the circle of staff and quickly entered the mushroom house. A cameraman quickly carried his camera and followed him.

Xia ruofei went up the stairs in a daze. He was so fast that the cameraman couldn’t keep up with him. The cameras that caught him while he was running were also shaking so much that they couldn’t be used.

Fortunately, there were cameras installed everywhere in the mushroom house from all angles, so they could still edit the video.

Xia ruofei ran to the “lake view room” on the second floor, opened the box, and reached in.

He knew that there were also cameras in this room, but because it was a bedroom, there were not cameras installed at all angles, leaving dead angles.

Xia ruofei’s back was facing the camera, and he reached under the clothes in the suitcase. At this moment, the cameraman ran to the door, panting.

He tried his best to stabilize the machine and aimed it at Xia ruofei, who was squatting on the ground.

At this moment, Xia ruofei had already taken out a few bottles of expensive rotten wine from the medium and stuffed them under his clothes.

The cameraman just happened to capture Xia ruofei taking out the wine from the box.

Since they were recording a show, it was not appropriate to drink high – Concentration white wine. Hence, Xia ruofei took out three bottles of expensive rotten wine.

He simply tidied up the box and closed it again. Then, he took the three bottles of wine and quickly went downstairs.

“The wine is here!” Xia ruofei returned to the pergola with a smile and placed the three bottles of wine on the table.

Compared to food ingredients like the Chang Jiang Pomfret, He Jiong and the rest obviously had a deeper understanding of wine. The few of them cast their gazes on the label of the wine bottle.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,””Don’t look at it. This is from Australia’s West Winery, not a product of any famous brand. However, the taste was really good! You’ll know when you try it later!”

“Then what are we waiting for? Pengpeng, open the wine!” Huang Lei shouted.

“Alright!” Peng Chang replied loudly. He found a wine opener and came over to open the wine.

Zhang Xing ran to the kitchen to find a few wine glasses. He could not find wine glasses at the moment, so he only had straight glass for beer. But under such conditions, it was already good enough to have a glass. In the previous season, they even drank with a tea jar!

Peng Chang poured the wine into everyone’s glass. The capacity of this type of glass was quite large. A bottle of wine was poured into five glasses, and after a while, there was not a single drop left.

“Come on! Let’s raise our glasses and toast to the fate that brought us together!” He Jiong said happily.

His voice had a special appeal, and it could always make people unconsciously become cheerful.

“Cheers!”

“Cheers!”

The five of them raised their glasses, clinked their glasses, and then took a sip. Although Yingying said it was a toast, she couldn’t really finish it in one gulp. After all, this was a recording, not a drinking contest. Moreover, there were only three bottles of wine in total. If they drank like this, they would finish it in a few gulps.

He Jiong clicked his tongue and praised,”what a special taste!” It’s definitely good wine!”

Huang Lei was obviously very experienced. He said,”The fragrance of the fruit is very rich, and the layers are rich. The sweetness is very high. President Xia, is this the expensive sweet bar?”

Xia ruofei gave him a thumbs up and said,””Huang Laoshi knows his stuff!”

“Mr. Huang, what’s this expensive sweet wine?” Peng Chang asked curiously.

Huang Lei was an experienced foodie, and he was very willing to teach young people about food and wine, so he patiently explained to Peng Chang the origin of the noble rot wine, the brewing method, and the preciousness of it.

He Jiong, Peng Chang and Zhang Xing could not help but feel as if their horizons had been broadened after listening to the story. When they looked at the noble rot wine in their glasses again, their gazes became a little different.

“Such a rare wine must be very precious, right?” Zhang Xing could not help but ask.

“Expensive rotten wine is known as liquid gold,” Huang Lei said with a smile. “A small bottle of high – Quality expensive rotten wine can be sold for thousands of euros! Of course, wine and tea are the same, the price difference is huge, and each standard is fixed. ”

Huang Lei couldn’t help but take another sip of his wine before continuing, “I’ve tasted the expensive rot wine produced by a famous brand. To be honest, no matter how you look at it, President Xia’s bottle of wine is better than those expensive rot wine that cost thousands of euros!”

“This West Winery ... It seems like I can consider buying some of their wine in the future!” He Jiong said with a chuckle.

Although Zhang Xing and Peng Chang were both popular stars with high net worth, a few thousand euros was nothing in their eyes. However, they were still a little shocked that a small bottle like this was worth a few thousand euros, which was equivalent to tens of thousands of Chinese dollars.

Xia ruofei smiled.”Mr. He, Mr. Huang, if you want to buy wine from West Winery, I can contact you on your behalf. I can even give you a good discount!”

At this point, Xia ruofei paused for a moment, then smiled and said,””By the way, the West Winery is also my property. I bought it in the Hunter Valley area of Australia.”

He Jiong and Huang Lei were stunned for a moment before they burst out laughing.

“President Xia, this advertisement is really flawless!” He Jiong even teased.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”the West winery’s production is limited, so I don’t have any plans to sell it to the domestic market for the time being!” Especially this expensive rotten wine, it’s extremely rare and currently not on sale. All of the expensive rotten wine is in my private collection ...”

After Xia ruofei finished, he added,”let’s not just chat!” Hurry up and try teacher Huang’s cooking! Otherwise, the dishes will get cold ...”

“Yes, yes, yes!” Huang Lei quickly said,”today’s ingredients are really amazing. I feel like I’ve also exceeded my usual standards! Especially the Chinese perch and the vegetables!”

Huang Lei’s words were undoubtedly a great compliment to the Tao Yuan brand.

After all, whether it was vegetables or pomfrets, they all had the prefix “paradise card.” Even if Huang Lei didn’t say it, the TV audience would be very clear about it.

Everyone put down their glasses and picked up their chopsticks.

Huang Lei’s cooking skills had been tested. Not only did the peach Garden vegetables look good, but they also tasted excellent. Under Huang Lei’s cooking, these advantages of the peach Garden vegetables were brought out incisively and vividly. It could be said that the color, smell, and taste were all present.

He Jiong and the rest were full of praise for the Yangtze River Pomfret. The unique taste of the gelatinous fish scales made them exclaim in delight.

Peng Chang and Zhang Xing both put down their idol burden and ate the food on the table one after another, completely forgetting about whether they would get fat.

Xia ruofei was already immune to this kind of food. However, Huang Lei’s cooking skills did make his eyes light up. He felt that he was on par with the chef of the Ling Ji private kitchen. At least, his cooking skills were several levels higher than his.

Hence, Xia ruofei ate with great relish. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

The guests ‘praise for the food was undoubtedly a kind of praise for the Paradise brand. Moreover, this kind of praise came from the heart, without a trace of pretense.

Especially for the Yangtze River Pomfret, they simply praised it in all kinds of ways.

It was conceivable that after the show was broadcasted, the sales of the Yangtze River beluga of paradise Corporation would definitely become more popular.

Of course, the reason why the Chang Jiang Chinese perch was so expensive was mainly because it was targeted at high – end customers. Even if the blue – collar workers wanted to have a sumptuous meal, most people would shrink back when they saw the price.

After the meal, the dishes Huang Lei had prepared were swept clean by the wind. Because they were too delicious, everyone had eaten more rice. The pot of rice he had prepared was originally saved for the egg – fried rice, but in the end, there was nothing left. It was all eaten.
