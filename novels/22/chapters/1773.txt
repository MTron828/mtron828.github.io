Chapter 1774: The problem of candidates (2)

Wu Qiang couldn’t help but feel nervous, thinking that Xia ruofei had changed his mind at the last minute. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei asked,”didn’t I ask you to find two or three people?” Why is he only alone after so many days! He had someone to cook, but at least he needed someone to wash clothes and clean! Also, you have to tend to the flowers and trees in the yard ...”

Actually, Xia ruofei had thought of a problem. As mentioned by Wu Qiang, his brother had passed away a few years ago, so his sister – in – Law was a widow. If his sister – in – Law came to work here, and Xia ruofei was often not in the capital, it would mean that there were only the two of them in this big house.

One was an older and unmarried brother – in – Law, and the other was a widowed sister – in – Law. If the villagers knew about this, it would be inevitable that there would be gossip.

Besides, Xia ruofei also felt that it was best to hire one or two more people to take care of such a large courtyard. Otherwise, Wu Qiang would still have to work hard.

Wu Qiang heaved a sigh of relief. However, he started to stammer,””President Xia, this ... There ... There is one ... Forget it. I’ll try to look around!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.”Why are you still hesitating! Is she your girlfriend?”

Wu Qiang’s dark face could not help but turn red. He scratched his head and did not say anything.

“Could she really be your girlfriend?” Xia ruofei asked curiously.

Wu Qiang stammered,”that ... Not really. A few days ago, my family introduced me to a girl. She’s from the neighboring village and we used to know each other. We’ve video – called each other a few times over the past two days and we have a pretty good impression of each other.”

Xia ruofei said happily,”that’s great!” How old is this girl?”

“He’s five years younger than me,” Wu Qiang said.

“Then what’s there to consider! Call her over!” Xia ruofei said,”we’ll talk about whether you want to stay for work or not. At least you two can meet!” I’ll pay for the travel expenses!”

“President Xia, this ... This isn’t very appropriate!” Wu Qiang hesitated.

Xia ruofei asked,”do you know this girl?” How is he?”

“We’re all from the same village. I have some impression of her. She’s a pretty good girl.” “But I haven’t been back for a long time. I heard about her situation from my family. She’s from the same village as my sister – in – Law. My sister – in – Law said that this girl is quite diligent at home. It’s just that her family conditions aren’t too good. Her parents have to take medicine all year round. She also has a younger brother who’s in University. It’s also because of her family’s situation that she’s delayed by personal problems!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”then you have to seize it!” You’re not young anymore, and it’s not easy to meet a suitable one. How about this ... Give your sister – in – Law a call and ask her to come to the capital with that lady tomorrow! I’m going to stay in Beijing for a day or two, so I’ll meet them. Just treat it as an interview!”

“Thank you, director Xia!” Wu Qiang said, touched.

In fact, Wu Qiang really wanted to introduce the girl to work here. Not only was the work here not tiring, but the pay was also good. Xia ruofei was also easy – going. Most importantly, he had a good impression of the girl. If they could get along every day, they might be able to get together.

Once he was over 30 years old, this human problem was like a heavy mountain. Especially in the view of the villagers, it was a problem if he was not married at the age of 30. Therefore, Wu Qiang also wanted to settle his marriage as soon as possible.

However, Xia ruofei trusted him so much and asked him to look for a staff member. He had either introduced his sister – in – Law or his blind date partner. He felt that it was not suitable, so he was worried about the gains and losses.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”what for?” “Wu Qiang, I have absolute trust in you. I believe that the people you recommend are also very reliable. No matter what their relationship with you is, as long as they can complete their work well, it’s all the same to me. Moreover, with this layer of relationship, perhaps your work cooperation will be even better! So you don’t have to worry about anything, I told you to try your best to find one among your family and friends!”

Wu Qiang’s eyes were a little red. He nodded his head heavily and did not say anything else.

He didn’t say ‘thank you’ again because those two words were too weak. Xia ruofei’s trust and high regard for him, he silently remembered in his heart, and secretly decided to sell his life to Xia ruofei from now on.

Xia ruofei could feel Wu Qiang’s excitement. He patted Wu Qiang’s shoulder and said,””Go park the car, then hurry up and call your sister – in – Law and your boyfriend!”

“By the way, how long will it take from your house to the provincial capital?” Xia ruofei asked.

Wu Qiang was stunned for a moment before he replied,”it’ll take about two hours by bus!” What’s wrong, President Xia?”

Xia ruofei said,”how about this? tell your sister – in – Law and boyfriend to leave for the provincial city tomorrow morning. Then, send me their ID numbers. I’ll get the company to book tickets for them at noon or in the afternoon!”

“How can I do that?” Wu Qiang quickly said,”director Xia, sister – in – Law and the rest can just come by train. We can’t let the company spend more money!”

Xia ruofei said,”how much does two plane tickets cost?” This is the fastest way of transportation. If we wait for them to come by train, will they be able to arrive tomorrow?”

“At the earliest, at noon the day after tomorrow ...” Wu Qiang thought for a moment and said.
