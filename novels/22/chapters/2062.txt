2063 Multi – pronged approach (1)

“It’s nothing. We’re more familiar with the area, so it’s best to leave this matter to us. ” Hua said humbly.

Xia ruofei had given instructions beforehand, so Hua did not dare to be too respectful.

After breakfast, ah Yong and Ah Hua brought the box that Lu zhengfeng had sent over the night before to Xia ruofei’s room. Then, the two of them politely said goodbye.

Xia ruofei opened the box and saw that the medicinal herbs were placed neatly inside. The tools for decocting the medicine were also available. He was very satisfied.

He skillfully picked out the required Chinese medicinal herbs and put them into the earthenware pot. Then, he added water and began to boil them over the charcoal fire.

He had checked the herbs, and they were all of the best quality. The Hong sect was quite reliable.

Xia ruofei’s purpose of brewing Chinese medicine was not just to fool people. He used these Chinese medicinal herbs to make an ointment called “muscle relaxing and bone strengthening ointment” that was mentioned in Chinese medical books. This ointment was very effective in recovering meridians and bones. Moreover, the prescription had long been lost in the long river of history.

It took a long time to make the ointment, mainly to ensure the efficacy of the medicine. Xia ruofei used slow boiling with fire, hoping to force out the medicinal properties of the herbs.

After about two hours, Xia ruofei checked the herbs carefully and nodded in satisfaction. He poured the herbal soup into a soup bowl and threw away the dregs. The dregs had no more medicinal properties, and the essence was already in the soup.

After washing the claypot, Xia ruofei poured the medicinal soup back into the claypot and continued to simmer it over the charcoal fire. At the same time, he found the last medicinal herb from the box, crushed it, and poured it into the medicinal soup. He used a spoon to stir it continuously.

This medicinal herb was like a catalyst. After mixing with the medicinal soup, the medicinal soup gradually began to become thick and finally formed a jelly – like state, about half the amount of the casserole.

Xia ruofei followed the instructions in the Traditional Chinese Medicine books and stirred the claypot with a spoon. When he felt an obvious resistance, he took the claypot from the charcoal stove.

According to the normal process, as long as it was left to cool, the ‘muscle and bone strengthening ointment’ would be completed.

However, Xia ruofei still had to add something to them. The petals of the spirit Heart Flower, which played a key role in healing, had not been added yet!

Xia ruofei had chosen to add the petals after the ointment had taken shape because he was worried that it would affect the formation of the gel. After all, he did not understand why the soup would slowly coagulate after adding the last herb.

With a thought, Xia ruofei took out a spirit Heart Flower petal from the space.

Once the petal touched the human body, it would be absorbed immediately. Hence, Xia ruofei did not dare to touch it with his hands. He wrapped the petal with his spiritual power and put it in the claypot.

Then, Xia ruofei took out a set of butonen – butter – butter – butter – on – one gloves from his space and put them on. This was to prevent his skin from coming into direct contact with the petals and ointment.

Then, Xia ruofei added a small amount of water.

The petals of the spirit Heart Flower dissolved quickly when they came into contact with the water. Xia ruofei picked up the spoon and stirred quickly. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

During the stirring process, the ingredients of the spirit Heart Flower petals naturally mixed evenly with the ointment. At the same time, it also accelerated the heat dissipation. After stirring for about 15 minutes, Xia ruofei nodded in satisfaction.

He tidied up the room and opened the windows to get some fresh air. He didn’t want the room to be filled with the smell of Chinese medicine when he slept.

Xia ruofei carried the clay pot with the ointment and walked out of the room.

Monica had been near Xia ruofei’s room the entire time. She immediately walked up to him the moment he opened his door.

“Xia, you’ve worked hard!” Monica was touched when she saw the claypot in Xia ruofei’s hands.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I’m not tired at all!” Let’s go! He continued to treat Rousey today. I plan to use acupuncture and massage techniques, coupled with the ointment I just made. The effect should be much more obvious than yesterday. ”

“En!” Monica nodded heavily.

She did not know why, but her confidence in Xia ruofei had suddenly increased a lot. Perhaps it was the immediate effect of the acupuncture yesterday that had shocked her.

Monica followed Xia ruofei to Rousey’s room with anticipation.

Rousey was sitting in a wheelchair, staring blankly at the free – flying birds outside the window.

After hearing the knock on the door, Rousey came back to his senses and said in a clear voice,””Please enter!”

When he saw Xia ruofei, Rousey immediately looked at him expectantly and greeted,””Mr. Xia!”

Last night, Xia ruofei’s acupuncture skills had completely won Rousey over. His attitude now was completely different from yesterday.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded at Luoxi.””How do you feel today?”

“Very good!” Rousey said excitedly,”I can feel that my legs are a little numb. When I touch them, my skin seems to feel something. It’s not like before, where I can’t feel anything even if I cut myself.”

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”Rousey, don’t get too excited ...”

“How can I not be excited?” Rousey said,”Mr. Xia, Chinese medicine is really amazing. It’s just a few simple needles, and it actually has such a magical effect ...”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but criticize in his heart. What did he mean by a few simple needles? Even some Chinese medical Masters might not be able to perform the acupuncture techniques he had used yesterday.

Of course, it did not mean that Xia ruofei’s skills in Chinese medicine were better than those Masters. The main thing was that the acupuncture techniques he used came from ancient Chinese medical books, most of which were lost.
