Liu Mansha nodded in agreement and said,”Yup! Sect leader Luo happens to be here today, so we have to help each other in the future!”

Although the relationship between soaring Flower Valley and the first heaven sect was considered pretty good, and should be second only to the surging waves sect, the first heaven sect’s strong rise would still give Liu Mansha a serious sense of crisis.

She wasn’t in a hurry to form an alliance, but she was just doing some preparatory work.

Luo Qingfeng glanced at Xia ruofei, then smiled and said,””Of course! The spiritual energy in the cultivation world is very impure and the environment has deteriorated. It’s not easy for everyone to cultivate. It wouldn’t be good if we suffered losses because of internal strife.”

Liu Mansha smiled and nodded.’That’s what I’m thinking too. We can strengthen our communication in the future and help each other.”

At this point, Liu Mansha looked at Xia ruofei and smiled.””Fellow Daoist Xia’s status in the world of cultivation is quite extraordinary, especially his master’s background. I believe that even if sect leader Chen breaks through to the nascent Soul Stage, he will still look at fellow Daoist Xia in a different light. I hope that everyone can communicate more in the future!”

“1 definitely will.” Xia ruofei said with a smile. He did not directly respond to Liu Mansha’s seemingly unintentional question about his master’s background.

Sometimes, no one would believe the truth. Besides, it was good for Xia ruofei to be mysterious, especially when he was not strong enough to ignore others. A mysterious master’s background might be a protective charm.

After all, the soaring Flower Valley and the first heaven society had a friendly relationship, so Liu Mansha could only stop talking. Very quickly, she changed the topic and started talking about some interesting things in the cultivation world with Xia ruofei. She did not put on any airs as a senior.

Liu Mansha and Yu xiner drank tea for a while before she got up and left.

Xia ruofei personally sent them to the door.

“Fellow Daoist Xia, please wait!” Liu Mansha turned around and said.

“Valley master Liu, miss Xin ‘er, please take care!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Liu Mansha nodded.”Fellow Daoist Xia, although you’re already a golden core cultivator, you’re about the same age as xiner. Xiner also grew up in the secular world, so you should have a lot in common. If you have time, you can exchange ideas.”

Yu Xin ‘er’s face heated up.

Xia ruofei was also a little embarrassed, but he still said politely,””Alright! If there’s an opportunity, I’ll ask Lady Xin ‘er for guidance.”

“You’re going too far. You’re at the Golden core stage, and Xin ‘er is still at the Qi refining stage. If you want to ask for advice, she should be the one asking you!” Liu Mansha laughed and said,”Xin ‘er, you can ask fellow Daoist Xia for advice in the future. His teacher is a powerful cultivator. You will benefit greatly from just a few words of guidance from him!”

“Yes!” Yu Xin ‘er lowered her head slightly and said in a low voice.

“You’re too kind, Valley leader Liu. Let’s exchange ideas!” Xia ruofei smiled.

“Then it’s a deal.” Liu Mansha smiled and said,”fellow Daoist Xia, sect leader Luo, we’ll take our leave first!” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Take care, Valley master Liu!” Xia ruofei and Luo Qingfeng said in unison.

After Liu Mansha and her disciple left, Luo Qingfeng did not dare to disturb Xia ruofei any further and quickly left respectfully.

Xia ruofei kept the tea set and tea leaves in the spirit map space. Seeing that it was still early for lunch, he decided to go out for a walk.

The heavenly sect occupied a vast area. This area was used to entertain guests, so there wasn’t any forbidden area that one couldn’t enter. It wasn’t a problem to stroll around.

After Xia ruofei walked out of his courtyard, he strolled around aimlessly.

This area happened to be located halfway up the mountain. Above, one could see the shadows of tall ancient buildings in the clouds, and below, there were layers of ancient buildings that were scattered in a picturesque manner. They were faintly discernible among the green trees, and it was quite a good view to enjoy.

The spiritual Qi in the first heaven society was quite rich. At this moment, a light drizzle was falling from the sky. They walked on the stone Road and breathed in the air that was filled with rich spiritual Qi. It was a very pleasant feeling.

After walking for a while, Xia ruofei saw a platform that looked like a viewing platform. He walked to the platform and looked into the distance. His mind was full of thoughts, but he was still thinking about what kind of chain reaction Chen Nanfeng would bring if he broke through to the original infant stage.

Just as Xia ruofei was deep in thought, a voice came from behind him with uncertainty.””RUO Fei?”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment. He slowly turned around and saw that it was Lu You standing behind him.

Xia ruofei laughed bitterly.

He had never thought that the one who had told Shen Hu to keep his identity a secret would be him.

Lu You didn’t know Xia ruofei’s identity as a cultivator, much less that the “golden core stage senior” who had given her the cultivation technique and the spirit crystal was actually Xia ruofei.

However, the fact that Xia ruofei had appeared in a top sect like the first heaven society, especially when the sect leader, Chen Nanfeng, was about to break through and the first heaven society had invited many guests, confirmed his identity as a cultivator.

Xia ruofei was thinking about how to explain, but Lu You said anxiously,””RUO Fei, what are you doing here? And he was running around? Who brought you here? hurry up and find him!”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment. Obviously, Lu You had not figured out the situation. The main reason was that Lu You had never thought that Xia ruofei was also a cultivator, a master in the intermediate stage of the Golden elixir realm. He was on good terms with the young master of the first heaven society. Hence, her first reaction was that Xia ruofei must have been brought in by some cultivator..
