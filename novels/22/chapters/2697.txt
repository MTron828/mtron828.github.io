2698 The two sides meet (2)

The Wang family’s private restaurant was also a very high – Class private restaurant in the capital. Ordinary people could not afford to eat such expensive dishes, so the people who came here to spend were either rich or noble. When everyone gathered together to eat, most of them wanted to use the meal to discuss some things, or to make friends and so on. The requirements for privacy were very high.

Hence, the staff at the private restaurant was not unfamiliar with Xia ruofei’s request and was not surprised. They agreed with a smile without hesitation.

After Xia ruofei walked out of the private restaurant, he did not leave. Instead, he got into the Mercedes – Benz that he had driven over from the peach blossom gathering. He had set up an array in the courtyard of green bamboo pavilion. He could not leave at ease now. If the service staff accidentally touched the array, all the previous arrangements would be in vain.

This kind of simple array formation, under the circumstances of being drawn but not released, had no power at all. The array base was just a simple jade stone at this time, and ordinary people could also destroy it.

Xia ruofei’s car was parked near the backyard, so he could easily monitor the situation at green bamboo pavilion with his spiritual power.

Xia ruofei adjusted the back of the driver’s seat to the maximum and lay down in the car. He kept a part of his spiritual power monitoring the situation in the courtyard.

At the same time, Xia ruofei was multitasking. He took out his phone and texted Wang Boshan, telling him the time, place, and room name for lunch.

Obviously, Wang Boshan had been waiting for Xia ruofei’s message all morning. After this message was sent, he replied in seconds,””Received! Thank you, President Xia, for taking the time out of your busy schedule to meet us. We’ll be there on time!”

Xia ruofei glanced at Wang Boshan’s message and threw his phone on the passenger seat. Then, he closed his eyes to rest.

Xia ruofei chose to stay in the parking lot of the Wang family’s private kitchen for another purpose. He wanted to see if Wang Boshan and uncle Zheng had any ill intentions towards him.

If Wang Boshan and martial uncle Zheng really wanted to deal with him, they might have come over in advance or sent people over to make some arrangements. Naturally, all of this could not escape Xia ruofei’s spiritual energy.

Time passed by slowly.

Waiting was actually a very boring thing. However, Xia ruofei had received special stealth training when he was in the Army and was very patient. He was not impatient at all. As he used his mental power to monitor the surroundings, he even found a novel on his phone to read.

It turned out that Xia ruofei’s previous worries were unnecessary. There was nothing unusual in the area the entire morning.

Xia ruofei looked at his wrist and realized that it was already past 11 O’ clock. He had agreed to meet Wang Boshan at 11:30 in the morning. It should be about time since Jian Jia was the host. He must have arrived at green bamboo pavilion earlier.

Hence, Xia ruofei opened the car door and went back to the king’s residence’s Green bamboo pavilion private room.

As Wang Boshan and uncle – Master Zheng could appear at any time, these two were real cultivators. To avoid being discovered by them, Xia ruofei also retracted his spiritual power. Now, his divine light was restrained, and from the outside, one could not tell that he was a cultivator.

In fact, Xia ruofei had also done some research on this matter. It was almost impossible for people with lower cultivation levels to see the exact strength of people with higher cultivation levels. On the other hand, people with similar cultivation levels could more or less detect it under normal circumstances.

However, this was only under “normal circumstances”. Xia ruofei did not belong to this “normal situation”. The “great Dao Sutra” that he cultivated was a top – tier technique. Naturally, the genuine Qi He cultivated was extremely pure. The more advanced the technique was, the more natural it would be after cultivation. Hence, even if someone had the same cultivation as Xia ruofei or even slightly higher than him, they would not realize that he was actually a cultivator.

However, it was easy for Xia ruofei to see through his cultivation.

Of course, this was the information provided by the cultivation classics. Whether it was accurate or not, it still needed to be tested in practice. Today was a good opportunity.

Xia ruofei sat quietly on the guest sofa in the private room, holding a covered cup of tea in his hand and taking a sip from time to time.

He waited for another ten minutes or so before he heard footsteps coming from outside.

Then, there was a light knock on the door. Xia ruofei said,””Please enter!”

The waiter opened the door and Xia ruofei immediately saw two people behind the waiter. The younger one was Wang Boshan, who was no different from the photo in the information. As for the other old man, just as Wu Qiang had reported, he was still wearing a faded dark blue long shirt.

After Wang Boshan entered the house, he looked around and immediately locked his eyes on Xia ruofei who was drinking tea. He put on a warm smile and walked two steps forward,””You must be President Xia! I’ve long heard of your great name! I’ve long heard of your great name!”

Xia ruofei replied neither haughtily nor humbly,”CEO Wang, you’re too kind ... How can my small company be compared to stars Corporation?” If we’re talking about names, it’s chief Wang who’s the most famous!”

Wang Boshan laughed and said,”director Xia, you’re too humble. Nowadays, it’s all about internet celebrities. Popularity is the most important thing!” President Xia’s popularity, I can’t even catch up with it!”

After exchanging a few pleasantries, Wang Boshan pointed to the old man in the dark blue long robe beside him and said,””President Xia, let me introduce you to an elder of mine. This time, it’s mainly the two of us who will be talking to you.”

“I’m Zheng Yongshou. ” The blue – robed elder said indifferently,”you can call me Mr. Yongshou or Mr. Zheng.”

Xia ruofei thought to himself,”this junior uncle Zheng is indeed Zheng Yongshou!” It seemed that the star Seizer sect was really taking this matter very seriously!

Although his mind was racing, Xia ruofei’s face was still smiling. “Welcome Mr. Zheng!” He said.

After everyone had taken their seats, Xia ruofei said,””Director Wang, I’ve already cleared out all the unrelated personnel. Can you tell us what this billion – dollar business is for now?”

Wang Boshan said with a smile,”President Xia, please calm down!” Since we’re here, we’re definitely going to tell you everything!”

Zheng Yongshou also squeezed out a smile and said,””I’m sure you’ll be interested in this business deal. ”

Although Zheng Yongshou was chiming in from the side, his tone was somewhat stiff, making people who heard it feel uncomfortable.

Wang Boshan smiled wryly at the side. He almost shouted out to let this martial uncle Zheng be a spectator at ease, so as not to offend people the moment he opened his mouth.

To Wang Boshan’s relief, Xia ruofei did not show any anger. Instead, he said with interest,””Oh, really? Then I’m all ears!”

Wang Boshan looked at Zheng Yongshou, and after seeing Zheng Yongshou nod slightly, he said,””President Xia, to tell you the truth, our company has taken a fancy to your Qingyun Island ... It should have been renamed to Peach Blossom Island by now. Our company hopes to develop Peach Blossom Island into an international tourist Island, so we hope that President Xia can part with it! Of course, we won’t let President Xia suffer any losses. ”

At this point, Wang Boshan paused and looked at Xia ruofei,””We’re willing to buy Paradise Island from you for three billion US dollars. As far as I know, this Paradise Island didn’t originally belong to President Xia. It was a gift to you. Instead of continuing to invest in development, it’s better to cash it out directly. That’s equivalent to you making three billion dollars for free!” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Xia ruofei smiled and said,””So, director Wang wanted to talk to me about the Peach Blossom Island?”

“It is!” Wang Boshan said sincerely,”I hope President Xia will part with it!”

Xia ruofei stood up and said,”if CEO Wang’s several billion US dollars business is to buy my Paradise Island for three billion, then there’s no need to talk about it. I only have three words to say. No way!”

Wang Boshan and Zheng Yongshou’s expressions changed slightly. They had expected that Xia ruofei might not agree readily, but they did not expect Xia ruofei to reject so firmly.

The two of them had the same thought at the same time: Could it be that ... He had already discovered the extraordinariness of the Paradise Island?
