Jia Tianning’s mouth was wide open, and he only came back to his senses after Shen fangjian finished his words.

Unlike Shen fangjian, Jia Tianning liked to surf the internet. He would post on Weibo almost every day, so Jia Tianning had long heard of Xia ruofei’s name, who would appear on the hot search from time to time to make his presence known. Jia Tianning also knew Xia ruofei’s deeds like the back of his hand.

So, when the close – up shot swept over, Jia Tianning recognized it at a glance.

“I can’t believe my eyes!” Jia Tianning said,”I didn’t expect ‘XIA RUOFEI’ to really be Xia ruofei!”

The name “XIA RUOFEI” was mentioned the most by the Chinese fans in the past two days. Everyone was guessing his name. Considering the naming habits of the Chinese, as well as other factors such as Pingping, many Chinese fans pronounced the name “Xia ruofei” in the pinyin.

So, Jia Tianning’s words sounded like,”Xia ruofei is really Xia ruofei!”

Shen fangjian was a little puzzled. Jia Tianning’s words were a little nonsensical. If this were the National television sports channel, such obvious nonsensical words would be enough to cause a broadcast accident.

However, PP sports was an online broadcasting platform, so they were not that strict on this aspect.

Shen fangjian glanced at his partner and asked,””What do you mean, Danning?” Of course, it ‘s’ XIA RUOFEI ‘!”

“You don’t understand what I mean!” Jia Tianning said,”the Xia ruofei I’m talking about is ... Forget it, look at the comments!”

At this moment, on PP sports’s live stream interface, a large number of bullet comments had suddenly exploded and filled the entire screen. The live stream was basically no longer visible.

The netizens expressed their shock one after another, and the commenters also worked through the night to collect the Golden sentences in everyone’s comments and make up all kinds of jokes.

“My eyes are blinded! I actually saw Xia ruofei in La Liga?”

“Tell me, I’m not dreaming!”

“Shen fangjian is really out of date. He doesn’t know our famous President Xia!”

“Jia Tianning sure keeps up with the trend. I heard his voice change just now, haha!”

“This is really too unexpected! Everyone has been guessing the real identity of the 25th for a few days, but no one dared to think that it was president Xia!”

“I remember when this news first came out, a guy posted that ‘XIA RUOFEI’ could very well be Xia ruofei, but almost no one supported this view. On the contrary, many people went to his post and mocked him ...”

“I admit, I dissed this old man two days ago! I’m really ashamed ...”

“That post must have over 60000 comments. We, who have laughed at him, owe him an apology!”

“President Xia, I just want to ask, is there anything you don’t know? To be able to formulate an epoch – making product like the jaded skin cream; He had never flown a plane before, but he was able to land successfully. He’s never been a professional player for a day, but he’s able to enter La Liga in one go and be replaced early in the 30 – minute mark ...”

“President Xia! You’d better quickly withdraw your sacred art! You won’t have any friends if you snatch other people’s rice bowls!”

“Is there anything he can’t do? I’m asking you if you’re convinced!”

“I’m convinced!”

“I’m convinced!”

“I’m convinced!”

……

The netizens were discussing happily and even forgot to pay attention to the game itself. Wu Lei, who was originally the focus of everyone’s attention, appeared calm on the stage. There was no one talking about him in the bullet comments.

If Wu Lei knew about this, it was hard to tell if he would be happy or disappointed.

It was probably because he was happy. To be honest, the high level of attention from domestic fans and netizens still brought a lot of pressure to Wu Lei. It was already very difficult to adapt to La Liga, and there were countless Chinese fans staring at him from behind. Wu Lei often felt like there was a dagger at his back.

Now that Xia ruofei had attracted the attention of the “naturally hot topic”, no one was concerned about Wu Lei.

On the grandstand, after Xue Jinshan and the others recovered from their shock, they also began to discuss excitedly.

Xue Jinshan even took out his phone and called Dong Yun.

One must know that it was almost fouro’ clock in the morning in China!

One could only imagine how furious Dong Yun was after being woken up by the phone.

She sat up from the bed in a daze and took the phone to look at the caller ID. Then, she saw the time on the phone. She gritted her teeth and swiped the screen to answer the call.

“Xue Jinshan! If you don’t give me a reasonable explanation, tell me why you called me at four in the morning ... Just wait and see how I’ll deal with you when we get back to China!” Dong Yun shouted angrily.

Xue Jinshan covered the microphone and said loudly,”President Dong! Quickly turn on the television! PP sports ‘live broadcast of the LA Liga match, the away game where the Spaniards challenge Valencia, hurry up ...”

“Xue Jinshan, have you gone crazy from your vacation?” Dong Yun said unhappily. I’m not a fan of the Spaniards, in the middle of the night ... No! You woke me up so early in the morning just to let me watch the live broadcast?”

Dong Yun was a die – hard fan of Barcelona. She did not have a good impression of Barcelona’s arch – enemy, the Spaniards. Even though she had received a warm welcome from Zhou leiyun in Spain not long ago, it only made her less hostile towards the Spanish clubs. It was simply impossible for her to stay up late to watch the live broadcast of the Spaniards ‘football games.

“You’ll know when you turn on the TV!” Xue Jinshan kept them in suspense.”It’s best to replay it, about 35 minutes into the first half, starting from when the Spanish team is ready to make a substitution!” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“What the hell?” Dong Yun couldn’t help but say,”can’t you be clearer? Xue Jinshan, why is it so noisy over there? Are you guys watching the game live?”

“Hahaha! You’re right, we were indeed at the scene!” Xue Jinshan said with a smile.

“And then ... The broadcast camera captured your image?” Dong Yun gritted her teeth and asked,”you woke me up so early in the morning just to let me see you two on TV?”

“Am I such a shallow person?” Xue Jinshan said,”anyway, I’ve already informed you. It’s up to you to decide whether you want to see it or not! I’m not going to talk to you anymore, we want to watch the game ...”

With that, Xue Jinshan hung up the phone.

Dong Yun was so angry that she almost threw her phone out. She threw her phone on the bedside table and lay down heavily ... But when she woke up, she was no longer sleepy. After staring at the ceiling for two minutes, she suddenly sat up.

Dong Yun muttered to herself while looking for the remote control, “I’d like to see what’s so amazing that I have to watch the live broadcast!”

She turned on the smart TV, found the PP Sports APP, and quickly found the game of Espanyol.

After entering the live broadcast, Dong Yun remembered Xue Jinshan’s words. She used the remote control to play some playback, starting from when the Spanish team was about to switch players.

Soon, Dong Yun saw the close – up of Xia ruofei’s appearance. When Dong Yun saw that Xia ruofei was wearing the Spanish team’s No. 25 battle uniform, her mouth opened so wide that an egg could be stuffed in.

Dong Yun felt that she was still dreaming. She pinched her thigh hard and screamed in pain.

“I’m not dreaming ... President Xia is really playing in La Liga ...”Dong Yun nodded in her head, but at the same time, she felt a strong sense of illusion.

Dong Yun only came back to her senses after a long while. As she adjusted the progress to live broadcast, she took her phone and searched through her address book.

...

“It’s better to be happy together than to be happy alone ... Since I’m awake, let’s not sleep anymore ...”Dong Yun muttered to herself.

After saying that, Dong Yun pressed the dial button ...
