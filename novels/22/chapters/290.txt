“Increase the speed!” Du Xiaohai ordered, burning with anxiety. “Yes!” Said the policeman who was driving. He immediately sped up. The director of the Public Security Bureau also quickly informed the cars behind them to speed up through the walkie – talkie. The speed of the convoy suddenly increased as they drove toward yangdun town at lightning speed. On Xia ruofei’s side, he and Xu Wu held their guns and looked coldly at the hooligans in front of them who kept quiet out of fear. Wu De covered the wound on his calf with his hand. His eyes revealed an extremely vicious look as he cursed in his heart,”You can continue to be arrogant! When the police arrive, you won’t even have time to cry! It was a great irony for an old gangster who used to be a fighter to hope that the police would appear soon. It was as if the heavens had heard Wu De’s wish. Soon, the shrill sound of police sirens came from far away. Police cars rushed into the old Street of yangdun town. Wu De’s eyes immediately lit up. He revealed a somewhat crazy smile and shouted,””Hahaha! The police are here! You can’t run away! Just wait to be imprisoned and shot!” Seeing Wu De’s reaction, Xu Wu asked, somewhat baffled,””Ruofei, is there something wrong with this grandson? He’s still so happy when the police are here?” Xia ruofei naturally knew what Wu De was planning, so he smiled and said,””Who knows! Maybe his brain was damaged! Xu Can, do you think we should give him another shot before the police arrive? I think we should just let him be completely free! It’s a pain for a mental patient like him to live! Let’s be merciful and help him!” Wu De was so frightened that he shouted,”no!” Don’t shoot ... You guys, come and protect me!” When the Men in Black beside Wu De heard this, they were shocked and subconsciously dodged to the side. Xia ruofei’s shot had pierced through the crowd and hit Wu De directly. Those Men in Black were still afraid! If it had been slightly off – Target, they would have been the ones lying on the ground. When Wu De saw the performance of his underlings, he was even more furious. He thought ruthlessly in his heart that if nothing happened this time, he must teach these blind things a good lesson when he returned. In just a short while, the police car had already rushed to the side of the shop. Wu De looked as if he had seen his own mother who had not been seen for many years. He shouted with tears and snot,””Police! Help me! Help me!” More than half of the city’s police force had already been gathered. The police quickly surrounded them as soon as they got out of the car. Each of them was armed, and the police officers at the front were all wearing bulletproof vests, looking very nervous. In Wu De’s opinion, this was very normal. He urged his underling to call the police and said that there were armed thugs here, and they had shot and injured people. In response to such an emergency, the police would definitely be on guard. However, when Wu De saw a group of armed police jumping out of a few military trucks behind the police cars, he could not help but be stunned. There were dozens of armed police, and the soldiers were all equipped with Type 95 automatic rifles. They gathered in front of the truck and quickly began to divide and surround the crowd. Wu De’s mouth was wide open. He thought to himself, this is too big of a commotion! Did the person who picked up the call hear it wrong? There was only one armed thug here! Even if they included the one with the gun, there were only two of them! Why are there so many armed police here! They’ve mobilized all the armed police in the city, right? Could it be that these two people were extremely dangerous terrorists? The more Wu De thought about it, the more he felt that it was possible. When Xia ruofei had fired the shot, his indifference to life and the monstrous murderous intent made him tremble. When the armed police saw that Xia ruofei and Xu Wu were holding guns, they became nervous. With a clatter, they loaded the bullets and aimed their guns at Xia ruofei and Xu Wu. “Don’t move! Put down your gun!” The armed police soldier shouted. Seeing this, Wu De was very excited and shouted,””Police comrade, it’s them! They were the ones who injured people with guns! The one in black said that he had taken several lives! It must be a wanted order ...” Before Wu De could finish his sentence, a cold muzzle was pointed at his head. An armed police soldier shouted,””Put your hands behind your head and don’t move!” Wu De was so scared that his whole body trembled. He quickly and obediently covered his head with his hands and explained,””Comrade, we are the victims! We were the ones who called the police ...” “Shut up!” The armed police soldier glared and said. Wu De quickly shut his mouth. Xia ruofei and Xu Wu cooperated and lowered their guns, then slowly put them on the ground. They knew that the police and armed police must have rushed over after manager Lu informed the local government. Wu De, a local snake, might have some friendship with some basic police, but it was absolutely impossible to call so many armed police and armed police. Not to mention Wu De, even some of the local officials with real power could not do it. In particular, the use of the Armed Police Force must have been an emergency order issued by the higher – ups, and then the local leaders directly coordinated it to be possible. Hence, Xia ruofei and Xu Wu put down their guns without worry. “Brothers of the armed police, those are the ones who attacked the Bureau chief. We are the Bureau Chief’s staff ...” Xia ruofei said in a relaxed tone. “Do you have any identification?” An armed police officer asked. In fact, when he saw that the two of them were using standard equipment, he had already believed 70 – 80% of Xia ruofei’s words. However, this was an important matter and he did not dare to relax. “Of course I do!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Xu Can, show him your identification!” Xu Wu nodded and then said,”Brothers, I’m going to show you my ID NOW. Don’t be nervous ...” He was really worried that when he took out his id, the new recruit from the armed police would think that he was taking out a weapon and his hand would shake in nervousness, causing the gun to go off. That would be a tragedy for him. So Xu Wu told them in advance, then slowly put his hand down and put it into the inner pocket of his clothes. Then, he slowly pulled out his military ID. When the officer saw that Xu Wu took out a red document, he was slightly relieved. He came forward to take Xu Wu’s officer’s card and opened it to check carefully. Then, he closed the ID and saluted Xu Wu, saying,””Good day, chief!” Xu Wu’s rank was major, which was higher than the captain and instructor of their armed police Squadron. He was worthy of being called “chief.” The armed police officer motioned for the soldiers to lower their guns and said,””Please wait a moment, chief. I still need to report to my superiors!” “I understand. Go!” Xu Wu nodded slightly. At this time, du Xiaohai, the Secretary of the municipal government, also came over, accompanied by the director of the Public Security Bureau and Zhang of the armed police. The sergeant ran over and saluted, then handed Xu Wu’s officer id to du Xiaohai and said,””Reporting to the Secretary, the two people over there claim to be staff members of a certain chief. This is one of their identification documents!” Du Xiaohai raised his eyebrows, took the officer’s id, and opened it. When he saw the words “guard Bureau” on it, he quickly said,””Let’s go!” Du Xiaohai and the others quickly walked to Xia ruofei and Xu Wu. The captain of the armed police waved his hand, signaling the armed police who were still on guard around Xia ruofei and Xu Wu to withdraw. Du Xiaohai walked straight to Xu Wu and returned the military officer’s certificate to him. Then, du Xiaohai asked nervously,””Major Xu, I’m the Secretary of the Wuyishan city’s Municipal Committee. Is the chief alright?”
