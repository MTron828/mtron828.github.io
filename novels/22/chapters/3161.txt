3162 The horse doesn’t stop_

Xia ruofei did not take another shower. Instead, he took out a set of pajamas from the spirit map space and changed into a Kasaya. For a cultivator at Xia ruofei’s level, he was basically spotless. Ordinary dust could not even get close to his body. Most of the time, taking a shower was a long – term habit. It was already so late today, so he did not take a shower again to avoid waking Ling Qingxue up.

Song Wei blushed when Xia ruofei changed into his pajamas. She lowered her head and said,””You ... You can sleep in the middle! I’ll come back after I go to the washroom!”

Xia ruofei was also excited and said,””Good! Good!”

He carefully climbed onto the bed and lay down beside Ling Qingxue.

The pillow and bedding on the bed had a faint fragrance. When Xia ruofei smelled the fragrance, he felt relaxed and happy.

Soon, Song Wei returned to the bed. She looked at Xia ruofei and hesitated for a moment before she lifted the blanket and lay down. However, her body was a little stiff. She lay flat on the bed and did not move.

Xia ruofei said softly,”Weiwei, lie down a little more!” Be careful not to fall down when you’re sleeping in that position ...”

“Oh ...” Song Wei replied in a panic. Then, she moved her body slightly, but it was probably only a few centimeters. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Ling Qingxue was fast asleep, and Song Wei’s heart was beating like a deer.

Even though she had shared the same bed with Xia ruofei many times, this was the first time the three of them were lying on the same bed together.

Seeing this, Xia ruofei stretched out his right hand and passed it under Song Wei’s neck. He put his arm around Song Wei’s shoulder and moved her body closer.

Song Wei’s body trembled slightly, but she did not resist. She moved her body.

Xia ruofei did not retract his arm. He just lay behind Song Wei’s head. This position gave Song Wei a sense of security.

Of course, this seemingly warm sleeping position was impossible for an ordinary person to last through the night. Their arms would soon go numb.

Of course, Xia ruofei did not have such a problem.

He put his arm around Song Wei’s shoulder and said softly,”Wei Wei, go to sleep!”

“En!” Song Wei said in a soft voice.

Naturally, she would have some wild thoughts in her heart. Even though she knew that Ling Qingxue was right beside her and that Xia ruofei would not overstep the boundaries, how could she not feel a little moved when she was lying beside Xia ruofei?

Therefore, Song Wei could not fall asleep until she heard Xia ruofei’s breathing become long and deep. Then, she gradually fell into a deep sleep.

……

The next morning, when Xia ruofei woke up, he felt a pair of long legs on top of his. In his arms was Song Wei, who was curled up like a kitten and sleeping peacefully.

Xia ruofei did not need to look to know that the leg belonged to Ling Qingxue.

Xia ruofei was very clear that Ling Qingxue had never been a good sleeper.

At that moment, Song Wei and Ling Qingxue were still asleep. Xia ruofei decided to stay still. On one hand, he did not want to wake the two of them up and wanted them to sleep as much as possible. On the other hand, he also felt that it was not a good idea to wake up first in this situation.

For a cultivator in the Golden core stage, it did not seem difficult to maintain a posture and pretend to be asleep.

Of course, it was already bright outside, so Song Wei and Ling Qingxue wouldn’t sleep for too long. After all, they used to have a very regular schedule. One had to go to school, and the other had to go to work, so their biological clocks were relatively normal.

When it was almost eighto’ clock, Ling Qingxue was the first to wake up.

At first, she thought that she was rolling around in her sleep and had put her legs on Song Wei’s body. However, she soon noticed the familiar aura on Xia ruofei. She could not help but pull her hair aside, rub her eyes, and let out a cry of surprise.

The sound was not loud, but it was enough to wake Song Wei up.

Song Wei opened her drowsy eyes. When she saw Ling Qingxue, she quickly made a shushing gesture and said softly,”Qingxue, don’t wake him up. He only fell asleep at threeo’ clock last night ...”

“What’s the situation?” Ling Qingxue also asked softly,”how did this guy sleep between us?”

Song Wei blushed and said,”When I woke up in the middle of the night yesterday, I saw that he was still working on his computer at threeo’ clock, so I advised him to go to bed and rest for a while. It was too hard to stay up all night ...”

“Oh ...” Ling Qingxue rolled her eyes and asked,”you’re the one who let him sleep in the middle?”

“Which side do you think is more suitable for him?” Song Wei asked.

Ling Qingxue thought about it and smiled.””That’s true ... But I usually sleep very soundly at night. Did this guy do anything bad?”

Song Wei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. She thought to herself, Qingxue, you’re no longer an innocent girl. Don’t you know this little bit of common sense? No matter how deep your sleep is, you can’t possibly not feel anything when RUO Fei did “bad things,” right? Not to mention, that guy was as strong as a bull ...

Thinking about this, Song Wei’s face couldn’t help but heat up.

Ling Qingxue’s interest was piqued and she asked,””Did he really do something bad?”

“Silly girl, don’t you feel what he did?” Song Wei blushed and said. How is that possible?”

“Of course I feel it,” Ling Qingxue said, grinning.”I mean, did he bully you while I was asleep?”
