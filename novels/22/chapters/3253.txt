3254 The spaceship is in our hands_

Chen Xuan’s eyes lit up as he said,”that’s a good idea!” We’re going to the moon this time. It’s a historic feat in the cultivation world. There’s no predecessor’s experience we can learn from. If we can test it in low – Earth orbit first, that would be great!”

“This is indeed the safest way. I’m sure the seniors will agree!” Song Wei smiled and nodded.

“It’s only a week or so. Let’s just wait here!” Xia ruofei said,”there’s nothing much to do if I go back in the short term. Besides, the child of the Elon Musk family is still being treated. If I stay in the United States, it’ll be easier to deal with any situation.”

“Then it’s decided!” Chen Xuan nodded and said,”I’ll let my father know. However, just tell him that we still have things to deal with here. Don’t tell him the details.”

Chen Xuan obviously agreed with Xia ruofei’s point of view. He felt that too many details could easily be leaked over the phone.

Xia ruofei nodded and smiled.””It’ll be hard on you for the next few days. We haven’t been to the United States before, so you have to show us the scenery of the United States.”

“No problem!” Li Yifu quickly replied. Martial granduncle, I’ll definitely let everyone eat, drink, and play well!”

……

A week later, Xia ruofei and his group, who had a relaxing tour in America, took Li Yifu’s private plane to Houston, the famous Space City in America.

The group did not go to a hotel. After they got off the plane, they got into two business cars arranged by Li Yifu and left the airport for the suburbs east of Houston.

Halfway through the journey, two container trucks drove out from an intersection and followed behind the MPV.

The van stopped at the entrance of an inconspicuous factory. Li Yifu got out of the car and led everyone to the rusty iron gate. He pressed the doorbell.

The camera on the iron door lit up. After a moment, a deep voice said,””Please wait!”

After a few minutes, footsteps could be heard.

A black man in his 30s opened the iron door and walked out. Li Yifu handed him a card.

After the black man took the card, he took out a device that looked like a POS machine. After swiping the card and looking at the information displayed on the screen, the guard on his face lessened a little.

He then looked at Xia ruofei and the others beside Li Yifu and asked with a frown,””Why are there so many people?”

“We’ve already made an appointment in advance,”Li Yifu said indifferently.”That’s the number of people. If you can’t make the decision, you can call and ask for instructions!”

The black man’s eyes were cold and he snorted.””No need, come in!”

After he finished speaking, he made way for Xia ruofei and the others to walk into the dilapidated yard of the factory.

The black man was the last to catch up. After carefully locking the door, he quickly followed.

He led the way and led Xia ruofei and the others through the courtyard to a thick gate at the side.

The black man pressed his fingerprint and went through an iris scan before the door opened. A group of people walked in. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

In contrast to the dilapidated state outside, Xia ruofei and the others only found a whole new world inside after passing through the door.

It was a spotless factory with bright lights. The most eye – catching thing was a large container covered with a golden waterproof cloth in the middle of the tall factory. It was more than ten meters long and much wider than a standard container.

In addition, hundreds of boxes of various sizes were neatly stacked on the wall of the factory.

A staff member wearing a white anti – static one – piece suit came up and looked at the black man.

The black man nodded at him, indicating that he had already checked his identity. Then, he stepped aside without saying a word.

The white man in a white one – piece said with a blank expression,””Hello, I’m the person in charge here. You can call me John.”

It was obviously a fake name, but no one cared what the staff member’s name was. “Mr. John, we’ve been notified to come here today to collect the goods!” Xia ruofei stepped forward and said.

“Everything is ready,” John said indifferently.”You can check it!”

In fact, Xia ruofei had scanned the goods with his psyche the moment he entered the factory. He was very clear about the situation of the goods, including the hidden door and the dozen armed security guards who had not shown themselves.

In the large container in the middle of the factory, there were already assembled spaceships and expansion modules. In the boxes stacked along the wall, there were a total of five EVA spacesuits and 500 oxygen supply modules. There was no need to check them one by one.

Hence, Xia ruofei said directly,”no need, let’s load it up!” Can the car be driven in?”

“Of course!” John replied, nodding.

Then, John shook his head at the black man. The black man understood and walked to the side. He opened a control box on the wall and pressed a button. The entire wall of the factory facing the yard began to rise slowly. It turned out to be an extra large rolled – up door that could open the entire wall.

Then, the black man walked out with Li Yifu and opened the courtyard door to let the two trucks in.
