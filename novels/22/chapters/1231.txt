This truffle was indeed specially prepared by Xia ruofei. He knew that MA Xiong loved truffles. Among the White truffles produced this time, there were a few that weighed more than 2.5 kilograms. Even if they were to be sold in four auctions, there would be enough.

Therefore, he chose a truffle that was about the same weight as the final truffle in the auction. He was giving MA Xiong enough face.

MA Xiong was stunned when he saw the huge piece of white truffle.

He couldn’t believe it and thought he had heard it wrong. He couldn’t help but turn to Xia ruofei and asked,””Xia Sheng, you ... You’re saying ... This white truffle isn’t going to be auctioned?”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh and asked,””Mr. MA, this piece of white truffle weighs 2.67 kilograms. Have you seen this piece of white truffle in the relevant data we sent over?”

“No!” MA Xiong quickly replied. I don’t have any!”

“So ... I prepared it especially for you.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I hope you’re satisfied!”

“I’m satisfied! I’m satisfied!” MA Xiong said,”xiasheng, you’re too kind! I can wake up laughing from my dreams!”

Everyone couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

After MA Xiong finished speaking, he looked at the basketball – sized truffle and smiled happily as if he was looking at the most beautiful woman in the world.

Ma Zhiming hesitated for a moment and said,”Xia Sheng, truffles of this size are very rare. It’s better to auction them off ...”

MA Xiong immediately glared at Ma Zhiming, but he knew that his son was right. He really wanted the White truffle, but from a logical point of view, it was the most suitable to auction it off. If there was no other 2.73 kg white truffle, it would have broken the world record!

Even though he was very reluctant, he couldn’t scold Ma Zhiming, so MA Xiong’s expression became very strange.

Xia ruofei laughed in his heart and said,””Mr. MA, it doesn’t matter! This truffle looks quite rare now, but there’s still a long way to go before the truffle season this year. Maybe in a few months, this truffle will no longer be a big deal ...”

Xia ruofei’s words were meaningful. MA Xiong and Ma Zhiming understood immediately. They looked at each other and could not hide their joy.

They knew that Xia ruofei’s words meant that he could find more of these top – grade truffles. Furthermore, Xia ruofei had mentioned that this season’s truffles might be auctioned more than once. They would have to cooperate many times, which made it even more obvious.

MA Xiong nodded and said,”Xia Sheng, the MA family and Hengfeng group will always be your most trustworthy and loyal partners!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.

MA Xiong picked up the White truffle and pointed to the other one that was going to be auctioned.”Xia Sheng, I’ll be taking the things first! We’ll settle the bill according to the auction price of this truffle!”

MA Xiong loved the top – grade abalones and truffles from paradise Corporation. Since Xia ruofei was willing to let him buy them in private, he would not be polite. However, he would never let Xia ruofei suffer a loss in terms of price.

It was the same this time. He would buy the truffle that Xia ruofei had reserved for him at the same price as the 2.73 – kilogram white truffle.

Xia ruofei knew MA Xiong’s temper, so he didn’t reject him. He just smiled and said,””Alright, we’ll do as you say!”

MA Xiong had wanted to chat with Xia ruofei but he was eager to go home after getting the White truffle.

Such a good thing, of course, he had to take it back and store it at the first moment.

Truffles were precious ingredients that were not easy to preserve. Even if they were preserved in the most scientific and reasonable way, they would only last for one or two weeks at most, so it was better to eat them as soon as possible.

With such a big piece of truffle, MA Xiong could totally invite his friends and old gluttons who shared the same interests as him to have a good meal together.

“Xia Sheng, I’ll be going back first.” MA Xiong said,”let’s talk over dinner tonight!”

After that, MA Xiong instructed Ma Zhiming and Tian Huixin to chat with Xia ruofei for a while more before he left.

Ma Zhiming watched MA Xiong leave and shook his head with a bitter smile. He said to Xia ruofei,””Xia Sheng, my father’s just like that. Please don’t mind him ...”

“How could that be!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”old Mr. MA is a man of character. We hit it off pretty well.”

“That’s good, that’s good ...” Ma Zhiming said.

“Oh right, Mr. MA, how’s your recovery?” Xia ruofei asked in a low voice.

Tian Huixin was chatting with Feng Rao. However, she seemed to have heard Xia ruofei’s words and could not help but feel her face heat up.

Huan Huan sat on Xia ruofei’s lap. As a child, Ma Zhiming was not too embarrassed since he did not know much about this.

He revealed a grateful expression and said,””He’s recovering very well! Xia Sheng, I’m so grateful to you! You see ... My family already owes you so many favors ...”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”it’s nothing. You’re welcome. We’re friends. Shouldn’t friends help each other?”

“Yes, yes, yes, we’re friends!” Ma Zhiming quickly said.

Although he was the eldest son of the MA family and had tens of billions of assets, he was very glad that the MA family could make friends with Xia ruofei.
