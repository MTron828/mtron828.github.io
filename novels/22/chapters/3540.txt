Chapter 3541: A clear reject_2

Translator: 549690339

Manager Lu saw that there was no sign of the end, so he arranged for people to change the dishes on the table. Some were taken down to heat up, and then a few more dishes were added at the last minute.

After about ten minutes, song Zhilan’s phone suddenly rang.

Song Zhilan took a look at the caller ID and her face revealed a trace of surprise.

The call was from li chenghui. It was already seven or eighto* clock in the evening. It should still be morning in the United States. No matter what time it was, it didn’t seem like a good time to call.

However, song Zhilan didn’t think too much about it. She said to elder song,””Dad! We were just talking about the Li family and the Kyushu group! Li chenghui, President li, called. What a coincidence, don’t you think?”

Elder song looked at Xia ruofei and said,””Zhilan, just pick it up here! Turn on the speaker!”

Song Zhilan was slightly stunned. She thought about it and realized that there were no outsiders here. Although she was not used to answering the phone on speaker, she still nodded her head and said,”Alright!”

After that, song Zhilan picked up the phone and turned on the Hands – Free function.

“Good Morning, boss li!” Song Zhilan smiled and said.

“Director song, it should be night time back in China, right? I’m really sorry to disturb you so late at night!” Li chenghui said very politely.

“Boss Li, you’re too kind. 1 haven’t gone to bed this early!” Song Zhilan said and continued to ask,”is there anything that CEO li is looking for me for?”

If it was about work, out of respect for song Zhilan, li chenghui would usually choose to call during working hours in Beijing. Now, it was obviously after work and resting time. If he called, it was most likely not about work, or it was relatively urgent and needed to be communicated with immediately. That was also possible.

Li chenghui said, a little embarrassed,””Director song, 1 called you today mainly because of what you said about the two families …”

When song Rui heard this, he could not help but prick up his ears. At the same time, he was very nervous.

Song Zhilan smiled and said,”Oh? What’s boss Li’s decision? If you’re free in the near future, you can take Hongyan back to our motherland for a tour, and let the children meet and get to know each other!”

Although she had asked li chenghui about his decision, both sides were very clear about their intentions. They were very willing to marry each other. It was just that they had not made it clear and had not discussed the details.

It was precisely because of this that li chenghui had room to turn things around today. Otherwise, if he really went back on his words, especially when it came to marriage, he would really offend the other party.

Li chenghui became even more embarrassed. He hesitated for a moment and said,””CEO song, I’m really sorry! I’ve been seriously considering it for a long time these days, and 1 still feel that this matter might not be very appropriate. I took it for granted, I’m really sorry…”

Song Zhilan couldn’t help but be stunned. This … Was he rejected?

Song Rui was also in disbelief. Although he didn’t want to marry Li Hongyan, who he had never met before, the song family had taken the initiative to marry an overseas family, but they were rejected. This matter seemed a little unreal to him.

Li chenghui immediately explained,”director song, 1 still have a lot of concerns. On the one hand, our family’s Foundation is in the United States. Our relatives and friends are also here. Although we’ve been developing our domestic business in recent years, if swan goose marries back to China, it’ll be thousands of miles away from us. It’ll be inconvenient to even meet her. It’s also because of this that swan goose’s mother is rather against marriage.”On the other hand, Hongyan grew up in America, and I’m afraid she won’t be used to life here. Besides, her thinking and way of doing things are very American, and the song family is a traditional family. If she really marries into the song family, I’m worried that she’ll make a fool of herself and even affect the song family’s image… So…”

“I understand, boss li.” Song Zhilan sighed to herself and said,”it seems like our Xiao Rui and your Hong Yan are not fated to be together. Hong Yan is indeed very outstanding. Xiao Rui is actually not worthy of Hong Yan …”

“Director song, please don’t say that. If it’s a marriage alliance, it’ll definitely be our family’s swan goose that’s climbing up the social ladder.” Li chenghui quickly said.

He was afraid that the song family would hold a grudge against him. After all, Li Yifu had repeatedly told him to reject the marriage, but the song family still had to be on good terms with him. If he offended him, it would be difficult to handle.

Li chenghui quickly added,”director song, 1 hope this little episode will not affect the cooperation between our two groups. Returning to China to invest is the long – term strategy of the Kyushu group, and the song family is also our most important partner. The entire Kyushu group, including my uncle, places great importance on our cooperation.”

When song Zhilan heard this, she felt a little more comfortable. Although the marriage had inexplicably fallen through, she didn’t want to affect the cooperation between the two families. After all, business was business. Even if there was no strong bond like the marriage, it was still not a problem for everyone to work together to earn money.

“I won’t!” Song Zhilan laughed and said,”originally, I had an idea on the spur of the moment that day. Moreover, it’s a new era now. Arranged marriages are no longer popular. Actually, 1 just suggested that the children of the two families meet. If they really get along, then we will try to develop further. If there are no feelings, just treat it as making friends! However, since boss li has so many concerns, although 1 feel sorry, 1 still understand. Don’t worry, boss li, such a small matter won’t affect the cooperation between our two families.”

“That’s good! That’s good!” Li chenghui secretly heaved a sigh of relief and then said,”by the way, director song, Let’s cooperate with each other according to the plan you proposed! 1’11 go through the process at the board meeting today and we’ll be able to sign the contract officially!”

Song Zhilan couldn’t help but slightly open her mouth when she heard this, revealing an extremely surprised expression.

Golden Age of the nine provinces was a large commercial real estate project that the two companies were about to cooperate on. The total investment was estimated to be about three billion Chinese dollars. However, this project had not been settled yet. There were major differences between the two sides in the division of interests. The Kyushu group was very optimistic about this project, so they were very persistent in the share ratio. The two sides had carried out several rounds of negotiations, but they had never reached an agreement.

Song Zhilan didn’t expect that li chenghui would agree to cooperate with the song family without any warning. This simple sentence could involve the ownership of hundreds of millions of profits in the future.

“Boss Li, you’re not joking?” Song Zhilan asked with some uncertainty,”are you going to follow the plan we proposed?”

“Why would I joke about this?” Li chenghui smiled and said,”of course, we will sign the contract according to the proposal that you proposed during our recent negotiation. Director song, am 1 sincere enough?”

“Thank you, boss li!” Song Zhilan said happily.

She had a feeling that li chenghui was trying to apologize to her. After all, although they had not reached an agreement on the marriage, li chenghui had actually agreed to it. It was a sudden change of mind. It was a slap in the face for the song family, but it was not known to outsiders. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“You’re too kind, director song.” Li chenghui said,”by the way, our Kyushu group has been preparing to launch a large – scale logistics project in the United States and Europe. Is the song family interested in investing in it?” Song Zhilan suddenly said with interest,””Of course we’re interested! Boss Li, you are talking about the Suda logistics project, right? Can you really bring us along?”

“Of course! If the song family is interested, the Kyushu group can sell a portion of their shares!” Li chenghui said,”of course, in addition to a proportional investment, the song family also needs to invest some resources to lay a good foundation for this project to enter China in the future.”

“No problem!” Song Zhilan said excitedly,”I’ll form a capable team tomorrow and fly to United States as soon as possible to discuss with you guys!”
