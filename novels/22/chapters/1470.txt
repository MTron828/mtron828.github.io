Xia ruofei had booked the hotel at San Shan through the internet, so the check – in process was simple. After showing his ID card, he paid the deposit with his card and got the room card very quickly.

Although he was only staying in tan Zhou for a short time, Xia ruofei still booked two luxurious suites. Now that the expenses of traveling and accommodation were not a big deal to Xia ruofei, he naturally could not bear to make himself suffer.

They took the elevator to the floor where the suite was located. The two of them arrived at Song Wei’s room first. Xia ruofei smiled and said,””You rest in the room for a while in the afternoon. I’m going out to do something!”

Song Wei blinked her eyes and said with a smile,”Do you have friends in tan Zhou? Are you going to meet your lover?”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.”Don’t forget why we came to xiangnan province. I have to buy some things and make some preparations in advance.”

“Oh ...” Song Wei said,”how about I go with you?”

Xia ruofei quickly said,”no, no, no. You must be tired from traveling today. You also drank some wine in the afternoon. You should rest well in the afternoon!” We still have to hurry on our journey tomorrow ...”

At this point, Xia ruofei’s eyes narrowed and he asked,””Could it be ... Our final destination is very close to tan Zhou? Or just in tan Zhou?”

Song Wei winked at Xia ruofei mischievously and said,””I’m not telling you! I’m going to rest now, take care, I won’t send you off!”

After she finished speaking, Song Wei turned around and entered her room. She immediately closed the door.

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly and mumbled to himself,””This girl’s mouth is really tight ...”

However, since they were already in xiangnan province, Xia ruofei was not in a hurry. Song Wei would definitely bring him to the ancient tomb.

He dragged his small suitcase to his room.

The luxurious suites on each floor were at the end of the corridor. The rooms at the end had the best view, so Xia ruofei’s room and Song Wei’s room were separated by the entire corridor.

Xia ruofei put his luggage in his room and left the hotel.

He first took a taxi to an outdoor equipment store and bought some outdoor equipment. At the same time, he also went to the supermarket to buy a lot of drinking water and food.

After transporting the items back to the hotel, Xia ruofei went out again. This time, he went to a Street that sold incense.

This time, they were entering an unknown ancient tomb. Although Xia ruofei didn’t know much about tomb exploration, he still decided to buy some items under Xia Qing’s suggestion in case of emergency.

Although he didn’t understand, it was enough that Xia Qing did.

The waters of this business were indeed deep. Xia ruofei strolled through a few shops, and Xia Qing in the spirit map space scoffed at the things in these shops. In the end, he finally found something that Xia Qing was barely satisfied with in an unremarkable shop.

Xia ruofei bought a few pieces of yellow joss paper, some cinnabar, candles, mahogany swords, and nails. He even bought a small bucket of Black dog’s blood.

Xia ruofei had found a place with no one around and kept the Black dog’s blood in the spirit map space. Otherwise, it would be too eye – catching to carry this thing into a Grand five – Star hotel.

He also took a taxi and brought the rest of the things back to the hotel.

He didn’t plan to put these things in the medium. After all, he might need them when he went down to the tomb. If he made them appear out of thin air, it would be hard to explain to Song Wei.

Xia ruofei had bought a larger hiking bag from the outdoor equipment store. He tidied up the things in the hotel room and placed them together with the outdoor equipment into the hiking bag, filling it to the brim.

Two outdoor tents were tied to the top of the hiking bag, and a portable worker’s shovel was inserted on the side of the bag. It could be said that everything could be equipped was equipped.

Xia ruofei looked at the time. The whole afternoon had passed. He took a shower and changed into a clean set of clothes. Then, he put the clothes into the laundry bag and was ready to go downstairs to have dinner with Song Wei.

Xia ruofei was still dressed in casual outdoor attire. He was wearing VAGEL, a top Northern European Outdoor leisure brand. It had not been launched in the domestic market yet, and the LOGO was quite low – Key and not eye – catching.

The VAGEL brand had always been in the high – end professional outdoor market. Although it had a small audience, many people in the professional circle liked this brand because of its high quality.

Of course, the price was also quite touching. A windbreaker cost a few thousand euros, which was considered a luxury item. It was much more expensive than the popular primordial bird and old man’s head in China.

Xia ruofei’s main consideration was to explore the tomb, so the clothes he had brought were outdoor. It was most important to make it convenient for movement.

Very quickly, Xia ruofei called Song Wei and the two of them took the elevator down. They were prepared to have a simple meal at the hotel’s restaurant so that they could walk around tan Zhou and try the local food.

Song Wei was also dressed in sports attire. She was wearing a full set of Adidas sportswear and sneakers. At her level, she naturally did not need to rely on branded goods to show off her status.

The two of them chatted casually as they walked out of the elevator on the first floor. The Qingqing hotel’s buffet restaurant was set on the first floor.

A buffet at the hotel restaurant could be registered directly with the room card, and the cost would be listed under the hotel room fee, which would be settled when checking out.
