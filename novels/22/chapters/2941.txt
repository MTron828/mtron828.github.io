2942 A new beginning (1)

The arrays in the Forbidden Zone were all very powerful. If the guards and staff entered by mistake, their lives might be in danger. Hence, Xia ruofei had already emphasized this to ma su in advance. Today, the entire guards had moved into paradise Island. Xia ruofei personally took ma su to check it out again and emphasized it again seriously. Ma su naturally knew the severity of the situation and would strictly restrain his subordinates when he returned.

Xia ruofei did not go straight to the Yanhuang building. Instead, he drove ma su around the small paradise Island to familiarize him with the environment. Other than the Sentry posts in the camp, the guards also had to patrol the entire Island. As the person in charge of the guards, ma su had to get into position.

After walking around the island, ma su was more or less familiar with the situation on the island. After all, he had once served as the commander of the vanguard company. He had also been excellent in the military terrain assessment every year. He didn’t even need to deliberately memorize such a small island. He could quickly familiarize himself with the environment and get into the zone.

In the end, Xia ruofei brought the horse Deputy to the huge shelter built on the mountain.

Looking at the shelter that had almost hollowed out the mountain, ma su couldn’t help but be shocked. After careful observation, he found that the shelter was built with a high standard. It could withstand almost all attacks except nuclear bombs. Even if it was a nuclear attack, there was a special space inside the shelter to avoid it. In addition, there were rich material reserves. Even if there was a strong enemy invasion, everyone could hide inside and block the door of the shelter. It would have no problem lasting for one or two years.

“Old company commander, this was built by the previous Island owner before I bought this Island,” Xia ruofei said. Under normal circumstances, it’s almost impossible to use it. However, as the person in charge of the island’s security, you must understand and grasp the situation. ”

“Understood.” Ma su sighed.”This is really an eye – opener for me! There was actually someone who would spend so much money to build such a large shelter, and it was probably funded by a person! That’s even more unbelievable ...”

“Rich people are usually more afraid of death ...” Xia ruofei laughed and said, not explaining much.

His real purpose of bringing the horse Deputy here was not just to let the horse Deputy know the situation.

“Old company commander,” Xia ruofei said seriously,”there’s a situation that you must remember. This is also one of the important duties of the guard!”

“Speak!” Ma Jia quickly said.

“If something special happens on the island ... You don’t need to know what it is, just remember the signal!” Xia ruofei said,”once the special situation that I mentioned occurs, all the speakers on the island will sound the air defense alarm at the same time. At this time, you must remember that the guards ‘only responsibility is to organize all the staff to enter the fallout shelter in the shortest time possible, including the guards. All of them are to enter the fallout shelter and lock the door from the inside. Only when you receive my personal notice can you open it.” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Ma Jia didn’t understand for a moment. He asked in confusion,””The guards are also entering the fallout shelter?”

In his opinion, if the people needed to evacuate, there must be a strong enemy invasion. As the island’s Defense Force, shouldn’t the Guard’s responsibility be to fight against the enemy? Why was he hiding instead? Wasn’t this giving up everything outside the sanctuary to the enemy?

In ma SU’s eyes, Xia ruofei’s order was hard to understand.

Xia ruofei smiled.”You heard me right. All guards and staff members are to enter the shelter.” Old company commander, I may have a chance to explain this to you in the future, but it’s not convenient now. You don’t need to know why, just strictly follow the instructions!”

It was a soldier’s duty to obey orders, and it had been deeply implanted in the horse deputy’s soul.

Although Ma Jia used to be Xia ruofei’s superior, he was now Xia ruofei’s employee, a subordinate. Even if this wasn’t an Army, it was still a matter of course for ma su to obey his superiors.

So when he heard Xia ruofei’s words, he didn’t ask any more questions. He nodded and said,””No problem! I’ll come up with an evacuation plan based on the situation on the island!”

“Very good!” Xia ruofei nodded approvingly and said,”not only do we have to come up with a plan, but we also have to conduct evacuation drills regularly so that everyone can be familiar with this process. We haven’t fully recruited all the staff on the island yet, so you have enough time to perfect and refine this plan. When all the staff are basically in place, we’ll start to organize the drill. ”

“No problem!” Ma Jia said without hesitation,”leave this to me!”

For Ma Jia, this kind of emergency plan was like a piece of cake. It didn’t take him long to come up with it. In fact, this plan was similar to the other plans he had made in the Army. It was just that he had to make some details according to the roads, terrain, and other conditions of the peach Garden Island. The key elements that he needed to grasp were the same.

After leaving the sanctuary, Xia ruofei drove ma su to the Yan Huang building.

The employee’s apartment that Lin Yue was assigned to was on the side of the Yanhuang building. In fact, it was an attached building of the building, but after Xia ruofei took over, he transformed it into an employee’s apartment and a cafeteria.
