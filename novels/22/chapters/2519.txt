Therefore, mental preparation was even more important.

Without any hesitation, Wu Lei said with determination,””I’ve already made preparations! From the day I chose to play football, as long as it can make me stronger, I can take it no matter how much pain it is!”

“Very good!” Xia ruofei looked at Wu Lei with admiration and said,”you have the heart of a strong man. Even if you don’t play football in the future, no matter what you do, as long as you maintain this strong heart, you will definitely succeed!”

“Thank you for your encouragement, President Xia!” Wu Lei said,”then I’ll start?”

“Come on!” Xia ruofei nodded.

Wu Lei took a deep breath and quickly made the first set of actions for the Golden Man.

Xia ruofei watched from the side and nodded to himself. He did not demonstrate this time but Wu Lei’s movements were still up to standard. It was even more standard than the last time he did it when Xia ruofei corrected him. There were fewer mistakes.

This meant that he had been trying his best to feel and remember the small deviations that Xia ruofei had corrected for him.

Although there was still a slight deviation, as long as he maintained this momentum, Wu Lei was not far from being able to practice independently.

Xia ruofei didn’t say anything. He walked up to Wu Lei and started to correct his actions.

One, two … When Xia ruofei corrected the last part of Wu Lei’s movement that was not very proper, Wu Lei’s body trembled and he could not help but groan. The veins on his forehead popped out and his clothes were drenched in sweat.

However, he had already experienced it once and was mentally prepared for this kind of pain, so his movements this time were more stable than the last time. Even though his whole body was in pain like being pricked by needles, he still maintained this movement steadily.

Xia ruofei walked to the side and sat on the sofa. He looked at Wu Lei, who was gritting his teeth, and praised him in his heart.

Just like the first time, after Xia ruofei corrected Wu Lei’s movements, he started the timer on his phone.

Wu Lei persevered in great pain. His clothes were drenched in sweat, and his teeth were clattering. His eyes were red.

Time passed by second by second. Wu Lei felt that he had been holding on for a century, and even his consciousness was starting to blur, but he still gritted his teeth and held on.

At this moment, Xia ruofei said,””Hold on! Only after experiencing the wind and rain would the rainbow be beautiful! You haven’t even lasted half of the time you did last time! Don’t relax!”

Wu Lei could not speak at this moment, but the trembling of his body had obviously reduced. His eyes were wide open, like a fish that lacked oxygen. Although he looked a little miserable, Xia ruofei could feel the glow on his body.

As someone who had also practiced the body – refining movements of the little golden man, Xia ruofei was well aware of how difficult it was to endure such pain.

He didn’t even teach Ling Qingxue and Song Wei to practice this set of movements. Even though he knew that body and Qi cultivation could be carried out at the same time and complement each other, he still didn’t plan on teaching them.

The only reason was that the training process was too painful. Xia ruofei could not bear to let his woman go through such pain.L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

In the end, Wu Lei’s consciousness was completely blurred. He had reached his limit and could not hold on with willpower. In fact, this limit might have been reached earlier, but he still relied on his rock – Solid willpower. He subconsciously controlled his body and held on for a little longer.

When Wu Lei fell limply on the carpet, Xia ruofei pressed the clock on his phone.

The time displayed on it was 2 minutes and 35 seconds.

This time, Wu Lei lasted more than 20 seconds longer than the last time.

In fact, when Xia ruofei reminded Wu Lei, he was almost at the same time as the last time he practiced. Xia ruofei saw that he could not hold on any longer, so he said something to stimulate him. He did not expect him to hold on for so long.

20 seconds didn’t seem like much, but it wasn’t easy for someone who had reached their limit to continue for so long.

When a camel reached its limit, even a straw could crush it, let alone Wu Lei, who was alone. Moreover, Wu Lei had never practiced Qi refinement before. This was only his second time practicing this body – tempering action.

Although the results of Wu Lei’s persistence were nothing in Xia ruofei’s eyes, he still admired him from the bottom of his heart. He liked this pure, simple player who pursued strength more and more.

Wu Lei laid down for a while to rest. Although the pain in Yingying’s body had disappeared, he still felt very tired mentally.

However, when that energy recovered, he felt that his whole body was very clear, as if he had drunk iced sour plum soup in the hot summer.

Wu Lei got up from the ground and bowed deeply to Xia ruofei. He said sincerely,””President Xia, I can’t thank you enough for this! If you ever need my help in the future, I won’t even frown!”

Xia ruofei laughed and waved his hand. “You’re welcome. I know it’s not easy to make a living overseas. The reason why I helped you is, on the bigger hand, for the weak Chinese football. On the smaller hand, it’s for the sake of the Chinese football! I’m a shareholder of RCD Espanyol, and you’re a player under the club. Helping you is helping myself!”

Wu Lei knew that Xia ruofei had said this so that he would not feel that he owed him too much. Otherwise, the Spanish team had dozens of players in the first team. Why did he not teach this set of magical moves to everyone?

Xia ruofei continued,”besides, you’re quite right with me. I hope that you’ll continue to work hard. Although you’re 27 years old, don’t think that you have no room for improvement. People have great potential, but the degree of development is different for everyone. Look at Zheng Zhi, he’s more than ten years older than you, but he’s still active in the Chinese Super League!”

“Brother Zhi is the flag of Chinese football and the role model for every player!” Wu Lei nodded. President Xia, you’re right. I think that as long as I continue to practice this set of movements, I still have a lot of room for improvement!”

“That’s the right way to think!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”maybe you can become a big star like Ronaldo and Messi in the future! Our company might also look for you to be the spokesperson!”

“No matter when, as long as you need it, I’ll definitely endorse for free!” Wu Lei said without thinking.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.”I’ll remember that. In the future, your endorsement fees might reach millions or even tens of millions of euros. Don’t worry about the money!”

“Absolutely not!” Wu Lei said.

“Hahaha! Alright, it’s getting late. You should go back to wash up and rest. You still have to train tomorrow!” Xia ruofei said.

Wu Lei expressed his gratitude to Xia ruofei again. Just as he was about to leave Xia ruofei’s room, Xia ruofei muttered to himself,””Wake up earlier tomorrow morning and come to my place.”

Wu Lei’s eyes lit up and he asked,””Does President Xia want to guide me in my training again?”

“I’ve practiced it twice.” Xia ruofei laughed and asked,”are you afraid of the intense pain when you practice this set of movements?”

“I’m a little scared, but I’ll say the same thing. As long as I can become stronger, I can endure any pain!” Wu Lei said firmly.

Xia ruofei nodded.”I want you to train again tomorrow morning. I hope you can master this set of movements as soon as possible so that you can arrange your own time for training.” Of course, there’s something else tomorrow. You’ll know when you come. Anyway, it’s good for you!”

“Alright!” Wu Lei nodded. Then I’ll come over at 6:30 tomorrow morning, is that okay?”

“No problem! I don’t sleep in. ” Xia ruofei said.

“I understand, President Xia. I’ll go back now. See you tomorrow!” Wu Lei said happily.

“See you tomorrow!”

After Wu Lei returned to his room, Xia ruofei took out some herbs from the medium.

The last time Xia ruofei helped Wu Lei with his recovery, Zhou leiyun had sent someone to buy a whole set of medicine decocting tools, so these were all ready – made. Xia ruofei processed the medicinal materials and began to decoct the medicine seriously.
