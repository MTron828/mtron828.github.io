2834 Utter despair (1)

Pablo naturally couldn’t care less about this woman he had just met. He ran out of the express hotel in a daze, his mind filled with the angry roar of the managing editor.

This place was quite far from the headquarters of The Sports Daily. Pablo finally managed to hail a night – Shift taxi and hurried to the newspaper office.

The more Pablo thought about it, the more worried he became. He couldn’t help but call an editor he was familiar with. The editor named hildings happened to be on duty tonight, so he should still be at the news agency at this time.

No one picked up the phone at first, and it took a while for hirkins to call back.

Pablo quickly picked up and asked, “What’s going on, hildings? Why is the managing editor so angry?” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

After a moment of silence, he said in a low voice with a hint of sympathy,””Pablo, you’d better hurry back to the news agency! This matter has blown up ...”

“I’m already on my way to the news agency!” Pablo said,”first, tell me what happened!”

“I’m not sure,” said hildings vaguely.”Open Facebook and you’ll know ... I can’t talk to you anymore, the editorial department is in a mess now! I sneaked out just now to call you. I have to go over now ... Don’t call me again!”

With that, he hung up the phone in a hurry. If it weren’t for the fact that the two of them had a good personal relationship, hildings might have directly blacklisted Pablo’s number and done with it. Pablo had already become the target of public criticism, and his reputation was quickly going to be tarnished. Who would want to have any relationship with him?

Pablo heard the busy tone from the phone and couldn’t help but curse in a low voice.

However, at least he was given some hints by hildings. He quickly opened Facebook on his phone, and unsurprisingly, the notifications had become 99+. These days, Chinese netizens had been spamming his Facebook when they had nothing to do, and he was already used to it.

Pablo wasn’t in the mood to check the news. He opened his latest post, which was the video of the interview with the so – called annual member of Barcelona, Mayers. He was dumbfounded when he saw it.

Originally, there were not many Chinese netizens who left comments on this video. Most of them were Barcelona fans cheering. Now, it was once again captured by Chinese netizens.

But pabulo still didn’t understand. This wasn’t the first time that Chinese netizens had come to his Facebook to slaughter his page. Was it necessary for the editor – in – chief to be so angry? Although he had been badly criticized by the Chinese netizens for the previous two expeditions to Facebook, his popularity had also greatly increased. Even the topic of The Sports Daily had greatly increased. He had even received a 1000 – Euro prize money! Why did he suddenly change his attitude today?

Pablo looked through a few of the comments and found out that the Chinese netizens ‘comments were all copies of the original copy from Tieba, and there were only a few versions in total.

Pablo did not feel anything at first, but when he saw a comment that had just been refreshed, his face turned green. The comment came with a picture. It was a screenshot of the video taken by Song Wei, and it was a very representative screenshot. The scoreboard showed the time of the game and the score of both sides. The fountain had been turned on, and the Spanish players were scattered in all directions. There were also a few bar?a fans leaving the stands opposite. It could be said to have perfectly reflected the entire process of the matter.

The comment was very simple, only a few words: Pablo, does your face hurt?

In fact, the Chinese netizens were still the vanguard of the comments. Many netizens who had just started work had not had time to join the battle, but the number of comments was already quite considerable.

Pablo could vaguely guess what had happened. His fingers trembled a little as he found a few other Spain sports media on his list of followers and clicked on them.

He did not look for the account of his own company, The Sports Daily, because he knew that at this time, The Sports Daily would definitely not report or respond.

Sure enough, Pablo found a post at the top of marca’s Facebook page. The title was very eye – catching: Pablo! The shame of the news industry!”

When Pablo saw this title, he almost fainted in one breath.

He took a deep breath and opened the thread. After reading it from the beginning to the end, especially after watching the video, Pablo no longer had any hopes of getting lucky.

His face turned as pale as a sheet of paper, and he slumped in the back seat of the taxi, his eyes empty and lost.

The taxi driver in front glanced at Pablo through the rearview mirror. Because Pablo’s appearance was so frightening, the driver even suspected that this guy was on drugs. He prayed that Pablo wouldn’t die in his car ...

Fortunately, although Pablo looked like he was on the verge of death, he was still panting. The taxi driver kept observing Pablo’s condition every few seconds, and they finally arrived at the entrance of the newspaper office.

“Hey! Brother! We’ve arrived!” The taxi driver couldn’t help but remind Pablo when he saw Pablo sitting in his seat without moving.

Pablo’s eyes moved, and he turned his head with difficulty to look at the newspaper building next to him. Then, he moved his body and got out of the car.

“The fare!” The taxi driver reminded.

Pablo took out his wallet from his pocket with a blank expression. He took out a 100 – Euro bill and threw it in through the window on the passenger side without even looking at it. Then, he turned and left.
