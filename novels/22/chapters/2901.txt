2902 Ambitious and ruthless_Chapter 1581: the great Tang!

Davis was already so scared that he couldn’t speak. His whole body was shaking like a sieve. His strong desire to live made him move away from Charlie in vain, while begging for mercy in a trembling voice,”Charlie, don’t kill me ... Don’t kill me ... We’re brothers, real brothers ... You can’t do this ...”

A faint smile hung on Charlie’s face the entire time. He wasn’t in a hurry to make a move, and only walked step by step towards Davis.

Charlie didn’t say a word, but Davis felt a mountain – like pressure. In a moment of desperation, he quickly said,”Charlie, those people just now all deserved to die! They were the ones who killed the crew members! I ... I didn’t kill anyone ...”

Charlie finally sneered and said,””Davis, do you think I’m a child who hasn’t grown up yet? You didn’t do anything, but shouldn’t the blood debt of these people be counted on you? And ... The person who was about to kill me was you, wasn’t it?”

“I was wrong! I was wrong!” Davis cried out loud,”I won’t dare to do it again. Please spare my life ...”

Charlie ignored Davis and walked up to Davis in two steps. He reached into his pocket and took out the will, unfolding it to take a look.

The sea breeze blew the will, but Charlie held on to it tightly.

He had just signed his name on the will. All he could think of now was the scene of him signing his name under Davis’s pressure. He would never forget that feeling of despair.

The stronger this feeling was, the deeper his hatred towards Davis grew. At the same time, he was even more grateful to Xia ruofei, his Savior, who had descended from the sky. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The reason why Charlie took out this will was to make his killing intent more resolute.

After all, Davis was his brother, and Davis’s bitter tears and repentance reminded him of his childhood. To be honest, he was a little hesitant.

However, when the will was presented to him again, his heart turned as cold as iron.

He clearly realized that Davis was no longer the younger brother he had taken care of when he was young. Now Davis was a hungry wolf, a venomous snake, and he would never be able to raise him well. Letting him go might eventually bring him a disaster.

What happened tonight was a good example.

With this in mind, Charlie tore the will in his hand into pieces without hesitation. Then, he stood by the deck railing and waved his hand. The will that had given him an unforgettable experience was blown by the sea breeze and quickly disappeared without a trace.

Following that, Charlie ignored Davis’s tearful begging for mercy. He walked in front of him and squatted down. He carefully checked the rope tied to Davis’s ankle and fastened it again.

“Charlie, what ... What are you doing?” Davis tried his best to Dodge, but it was to no avail.

Charlie smiled and patted Davis’s shoulder. “Don’t be anxious, just wait for me for a while!”

Then, Charlie began to slowly deal with the bodies of the burly men, including the bodies of the few people in the cockpit. He threw them all into the sea.

After a round of hard work, Charlie returned to the second floor of the deck.

In Davis’s eyes, Zha Lai was like a devil. He screamed, “Don’t come over! Don’t come over ...”

Charlie threw the things he had found from the cockpit onto the deck. It was a bundle of rope about 20 to 30 meters long and a heavy iron anchor. One end of the rope was firmly tied to the iron anchor.

Charlie picked up the other end of the rope and walked to Davis’s side. He squatted down and very patiently tied the rope together with the rope that had been used to tie Davis up. In order to ensure a secure connection, he even fastened a few rounds of the outside with an iron wire and tightened the iron wire with a pair of pliers.

Davis felt that the blood in his legs had completely stopped flowing, but the fear of death made him unable to care about this. He kept begging Charlie to let him go, and occasionally let out a desperate wail.

However, he did not have the slightest strength to resist and could only watch as Charlie tied the long rope.

Davis had already guessed what Charlie was going to do. He kept pleading,”Charlie, don’t be like this ... For God’s sake ... Don’t be so cruel to me ... I beg you ... Wuwu ...”

There was a smile on Charlie’s face the entire time. He tugged at the rope and said with a smile,”Not bad, not bad, you’re tied up quite tightly!”

Then, Charlie lifted Davis up and said,”Davis, you should be on your way!”

“No...” Davis cried out in despair and continued to struggle.

However, Charlie’s body was very strong to begin with, and he had been persevering in various kinds of training. Moreover, the tendons in Davis’s hands and feet had been severed, so he could not exert any strength at all. Thus, his struggles were in vain, and it was completely useless.

Charlie carried Davis to the left side of the deck and easily lifted him over the railing. As he screamed madly, he threw him directly into the sea.

Davis was thrown down from the deck, which was more than ten meters high, and fell into the sea with a splash. Because the long rope was tied to Davis’s ankle, it also quickly fell. However, because the rope was long enough, a part of it remained on the deck when Davis fell into the sea.
