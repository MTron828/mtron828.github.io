2087 The materials have arrived (2)

Of course, this was all a story for later.

After Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue finished their lunch, they went straight to the nearby Shangri – La hotel and booked a room. The two of them had not been together for almost a month. How could a meal be enough to satisfy each other’s strong needs?

After a round of intimate activities, the two of them were both physically and mentally satisfied, and they leaned on the bed while hugging each other.

Since both of them had to go to the company in the afternoon, they were more or less reluctant to have more.

Ling Qingxue snuggled into Xia ruofei’s arms, her fingers drawing circles on his sweat – covered chest. She pouted and said,””Ruofei, when are you going to buy a house in the city? It’s not easy for us to get a chance to be together, and we have to get a room in a hotel. It’s too inconvenient ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”buy, buy, buy!” I’ll buy it immediately! He had been so busy the last time that he couldn’t take care of it. I’ll settle the house issue once I’m back!”

After the company headquarters moved to the city, Xia ruofei also felt that it was more or less inconvenient to live on the farm. Although the farm was quiet and the environment was good, the location was a little remote. If he came to the company often, he would have to spend more than an hour on the road every day. Therefore, it was necessary to buy a house in the city.

Moreover, the property prices in San Shan had dropped recently due to some adjustments. It was a good time to buy a house at this time.

After getting a windfall of 200 to 300 million euros in Italy he could even buy a building, let alone a house.

Xia ruofei immediately asked,”by the way, didn’t you say last time that your family had a house for sale in the villa district?” Don’t tell me it’s already been sold?”

Ling Qingxue smiled and replied,”not really!” Recently, the real estate market hasn’t been very good, and the transaction volume of second – hand houses has dropped a lot. It’s more difficult to sell high – value properties like villas, but it doesn’t matter if you buy them and live in them yourself!”

Ling Qingxue shifted to a more comfortable position and continued,””It seems that there are a few villas in our community that are for sale! There are several types of houses to choose from, and I don’t see anyone living in these houses usually. They’re probably hoarded by people who speculate in real estate. Recently, the price has dropped a lot. If you want to buy them, they can be much cheaper now!”

Once there was any movement in the real estate market, the capital chain might have problems. Therefore, every time the real estate market was regulated, many real estate investors would sell their properties.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes!” Then I’ll take some time to go over and take a look in the next two days! By the way, I didn’t have time to ask you just now. The batch of young geese I imported last time should be almost past the quarantine period, right?”

“I thought you had forgotten!” Ling Qingxue chuckled.

“How is that possible? This batch of young geese is very important to me. ” Xia ruofei said.

Ling Qingxue smiled and said,”don’t worry!” I’ve set a reminder on my phone, and when the time is up, the Inspection and Quarantine Bureau will call to inform me! If I’m not mistaken, I should be able to get it in five days!”

“I don’t know if there will be any problems when they’re in quarantine ...” Xia ruofei said.

“If there is a plague or a large number of deaths during the quarantine period, the Inspection and Quarantine Bureau will inform me as soon as possible. If I didn’t receive their call, it means that everything is normal!” Ling Qingxue said,”don’t worry! I’ll go with you to get them back in five days!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said,”it’s almost time. Let’s take a shower and leave!”

“Yes ...” Ling Qingxue nodded.

At first, Ling Qingxue was a little shy about taking a bath with Xia ruofei. However, after spending more time with him, she became more open.

The two of them took a couple’s bath in the hotel’s bathroom, and naturally, there was no lack of intimacy during the process.

After checking out at the front desk, Xia ruofei sent Ling Qingxue back to the company and then drove back to Taoyuan building.

Xia ruofei went to the chairman’s office on the top floor and realized that Yao Xin had already retreated. It seemed like Feng Jing was quick to execute his orders.

Xia ruofei smiled, pushed the door open, and entered the office.

There were still a few minutes before work, so he got up and went to the cabinet to take out some tea leaves. He made himself a cup of hot tea and drank it for a while before heading to the balcony to smoke a cigarette. He then returned to his desk and sat down. He picked up the internal phone on the desk and called Feng Jing.

“Sister che, are you free?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

“This is rare! I thought you were going to slip away this afternoon!” “Why wouldn’t I be free when the Chairman’s calling?” Feng Jing teased.

“Alright then, come to my office! I have something to tell you!” Xia ruofei said.

“Okay, I also have something to report to you!” Feng ke said.

“Let’s talk when we meet!”

After Xia ruofei hung up, Feng Jing knocked on the door and came in.

Xia ruofei smiled and pointed to the chair opposite the desk.””Sister che, sit down! Pour yourself some water! I don’t have anyone to serve me ...”

Feng Rao couldn’t help but roll her eyes at Xia ruofei and said,”I assigned you an assistant, but you didn’t want it!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.”I just don’t want to waste the company’s human resources! Right, didn’t you just report this morning? What’s the matter?”

“There’s something I forgot to tell you this morning ... Didn’t you order a batch of strange materials from the company? These things have already arrived. Basically, we’ve bought everything you requested. ” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei suddenly remembered that he had indeed asked the company’s purchasing department to order a batch of materials for the production of the soul puppet. At that time, he also saw that these materials could be bought on the market, but it was too troublesome to purchase them one by one, so he simply let the company’s procurement department handle it.

In any case, these things were not connected to each other at all. Even if outsiders saw this list, they would not know what they could do when combined, let alone think that they were somewhat supernatural.

After Xia ruofei made the arrangements, he did not bother about it anymore.

He said happily,”really?” That’s great!”

“Ruofei, those materials are all piled up in the company’s warehouse!” Feng Jing said,”do you need to go and take a look?”

There were still a few empty floors in the company’s headquarters, so there was plenty of space. They had specially made a warehouse to store some office supplies and so on.

Xia ruofei said,”I won’t watch it ... How about this?” I’ll give you an address. Get Lei Hu and the others to find a car and send all these things there!”

Xia ruofei grabbed a piece of paper and wrote down the address of the warehouse in the city.

He thought for a while and said,”forget it, I’ll just tell Lei Hu directly!” You don’t have to worry about this!”

“Alright then!” Feng ke said.

Xia ruofei was very happy that he had collected all the materials. According to Xia Qing, his current cultivation might not be enough to make a spiritual puppet, but some preparations could be done in advance. Many materials had to go through secondary processing, and his cultivation was enough to do it.

“Oh right, ruofei, why did you call me over?” Feng Jing asked.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”of course there’s something!” Sister ran, I’ve asked around and found out that Qingxue’s neighborhood has a few villas for sale. I’m already preparing to buy one there. I thought you don’t have a house in the city either? After all, it’s not convenient to live on a farm. Why don’t you get one too? We live in the same neighborhood, so we can take care of each other!”

Feng Jing was a little moved when she heard that. Besides, she was the first person Xia ruofei thought of when he bought a house, so she felt a little warm inside.

However, when she thought about how Ling Qingxue also lived in that community, she had a strange feeling in her heart. In her inexplicable mood, she blurted out,””Ruofei, I don’t want to buy a house for the time being ...”
