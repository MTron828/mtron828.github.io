Chapter 497: Love me and don’t go (1)

Ling Qingxue saw how serious Xia ruofei was. Although she did not know the reason, she had absolute trust in Xia ruofei. She quickly nodded and said,””I’ll remember this. I promise I won’t tell anyone, not even my father!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”that’s right!” Even Uncle Ling can’t say! Anyway, this matter is already over, so there’s no need for him to worry about you. ”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and continued,””In any case, just keep this matter to yourself. There might be some news in the next few days. Just read it and know what to do. No matter what it is, don’t be too surprised. Just pretend that nothing happened.”

Ling Qingxue nodded and couldn’t help but ask worriedly,””Ruofei ... You ... You ... Did you ... Kill the kidnappers?”

Xia ruofei smiled and gently stroked Ling Qingxue’s hair.””Didn’t we agree not to ask? Qingxue, I can do anything to protect you. If someone really died because of this, then they deserved it. Don’t think too much. ”

Although Xia ruofei did not give a direct answer, Ling Qingxue already had an answer in her heart.

While she was worried about Xia ruofei, her heart was also filled with sweetness and affection. Every girl had a Hero Complex and would fantasize about their man being an unparalleled hero. Tonight’s Xia ruofei undoubtedly fit the perfect boyfriend image in Ling Qingxue’s fantasy.

She was in Xia ruofei’s arms, and her worries about the shocking scene in the evening and Xia ruofei’s possible death slowly disappeared.

Ling Qingxue had blind faith in Xia ruofei. She believed that no matter what happened, as long as Xia ruofei was around, there would be no trouble.

Of course, when it came to this matter, Ling Qingxue still felt a little hesitant.

“Ruofei, what should I say if the police come to question me?” she asked with a frown.

Ling Qingxue’s question made Xia ruofei fall into deep thought.

Today’s attack on Liang Haiming could be said to be flawless. No matter how the Liang family investigated, the possibility of them finding Xia ruofei was extremely low.

Moreover, the possibility of the Liang family conducting a large – scale investigation was very low. After all, no matter how one looked at it, Liang Haiming’s death was an accident, and there was no doubt about it.

However, if Xia ruofei killed Heibao and the others, he would definitely leave a trace.

As the incident had happened too suddenly, Xia ruofei had no choice but to chase after them in the pickup truck. The two cars had been chasing each other in the city for a long time and then drove out of the Urban area at high speed. There would definitely be many surveillance cameras and global eyes that would record it.

Xia ruofei’s brain was spinning fast as he thought about the possible loopholes in every step.

The worst possibility was that, as Ling Qingxue had said, the police would get involved.

If the police treated the car’s fall as a criminal case, they would definitely check the surveillance cameras along the way. The fact that Xia ruofei was in hot pursuit would not be able to be hidden.

Of course, Heibao and his men had been very professional in their kidnapping. It had only taken them a few seconds, and the black SUV had stopped right beside Ling Qingxue, blocking the view of most of the cars on the street. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Therefore, the possibility of a passerby calling the police was not high.

If the police were to intervene, there could only be two possible reasons.

First, when the Traffic Police Department investigated the scene, they found the cause of the accident suspicious and not an ordinary traffic accident.

The second was that the Liang family used their influence to put pressure on the Public Security Bureau, demanding a thorough investigation of the matter.

Xia ruofei frowned and thought for a long time before saying,””If that really happens, don’t panic. Just say that after you were taken into the car, the other party covered your mouth and nose with a handkerchief, and then you fell unconscious. You don’t know what happened after that. When you wake up, you will find that I have saved you. Leave the rest to me.”

Ling Qingxue asked worriedly,”then wouldn’t you be dragged into this?” How are you going to explain this to the police?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said!”We’ll deal with it when the soldiers come.! There are no surveillance cameras there, so I can say whatever I want. Anyway, the dead can’t testify!”

Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but cry out in shock,””RUO Fei, you really ...”

“We agreed not to talk about this!” Xia ruofei covered Ling Qingxue’s mouth and laughed.

Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but look up at Xia ruofei. She was pretty sure that Xia ruofei had really killed the kidnappers tonight.

Seeing how calm Xia ruofei was and how he was laughing and talking, Ling Qingxue was touched and admired him. Her watery eyes were filled with tenderness.

Xia ruofei said calmly,”Qingxue, don’t worry so much!” It’s only a possibility, but it’s very small. The excuses we’ve discussed in advance will most likely never be used. ”

In fact, Xia ruofei was not wrong.

The middle – aged man was too busy to take care of himself. Liang Haiming’s sudden death had made him flustered, and he had no time to care about the lives of Heibao and the others.

As the place where the van had crashed was by the roadside, it was not until the middle of the night that a passing vehicle was discovered and reported to the police. The traffic police went through the normal process of checking and informing the owner of the vehicle by the license plate number.

The company that the MPV was attached to was actually a trading company registered by Liang Haiming in Sanshan city. However, the legal representative was the middle – aged man, Jian Jia. This was also a common tactic used by the rich sons of some big families. Most of the time, it was not convenient for them to control a company themselves, so there must be a shadow of white gloves in front of them.
