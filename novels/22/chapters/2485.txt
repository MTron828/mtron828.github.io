Translator: 5496903The electric door of the Mercedes – Benz business car slowly opened with a beep.

Xue Jinshan took a step forward and said with a smile,”Chairman, you’ve had a long journey!”

Xia ruofei got out of the car and looked at Xue Jinshan up and down. He saw that Xue Jinshan had indeed lost a lot of weight. The dark circles under his eyes were very obvious and he looked very Haggard.

Xia ruofei patted Xue Jinshan’s shoulder and said, “It’s you guys who have worked hard!”

He continued,”on the way here, director Dong told me that you’ve been going back and forth these days. You’ve been working day and night. This can’t do!”

“Chairman, it’s fine. I’m still young, my body can handle it!” Xue Jinshan laughed.

Xia ruofei said seriously,”I don’t want people to say that I’m abusing my employees!” I don’t want our company to die from overwork! It’s not wrong to work hard and it’s worth encouraging, but I’ve never encouraged my employees to overwork, and I don’t want the company to have such a corporate culture!”

“Yes! “I’ll pay more attention in the future ...”Xue Jinshan said with a smile.

Xia ruofei could tell that Xue Jinshan did not take it to heart. He frowned and said, “I’m almost done here. You can start taking a break in two days. You need to adjust yourself. How can you do it in your current state?”

Xia ruofei’s Chinese medicine skills were quite advanced. Although he did not give Xue Jinshan a detailed examination, he could tell from his complexion that Xue Jinshan’s body was very exhausted. He was relying on his young age to bear the burden, but in fact, his body was already showing signs of warning.

“That won’t do!” Xue Jinshan immediately said,”Chairman, after the handover here, we will immediately carry out the transformation of the factory, followed by the installation and debugging of the production line, as well as the recruitment and training of workers ... A lot of things are waiting for me to do! How can I take a break at this time?”

Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows and said,”I’m not discussing this with you!” This was an order! You just have to execute it! You’re not allowed to negotiate with me!”

“This ...” Xue Jinshan could not help but be dumbfounded. However, he did not dare to go against Xia ruofei’s will. In the end, he could only say dejectedly,”alright! I’ll do as you say ...”

Xia ruofei’s tone softened and said,””Jin Shan, it’s not just you. All the employees who are involved in the handover of the pharmaceutical Group will have to take a break in a few days! I’ll tell you the specific arrangements later ...”

Xia ruofei patted Xue Jinshan’s shoulder and said earnestly,””Kanayama, I have to say a few more words. As the main leader of the pharmaceutical factory, you should change your work mindset sometimes. A leader doesn’t have to do everything by himself. Just like the handover here, since you are busy with the expansion and expansion of the factory in San Shan, you can send a Deputy Director over! “As a leader, the most important thing is to be able to relax and relax at will, so that you can better play the role of your subordinates. This is the embodiment of the level of a leader, and not to do everything by yourself. How are you going to give your subordinates the opportunity to perform like this?”

Xue Jinshan finally understood. He lowered his head and said,”I understand, Chairman ...”

Xue Jinshan had joined the company in the early stages of the Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory. At that time, he was mainly responsible for the drug testing of the heart – nourishing soup. After Taoyuan company acquired the pharmaceutical factory, he began to transform into a management position. However, the pharmaceutical factory was not very large. Although he was the factory director, Xue Jinshan was still used to handling everything himself. To put it bluntly, he had not yet gotten used to the change in his role.

There were many people waiting to welcome them, so Xia ruofei did not talk much with Xue Jinshan.

Dong Yun had already gotten out of the car. Seeing that Xia ruofei and Xue Jinshan had finished their conversation, she immediately pointed to a middle – aged man who was balding and said,”Chairman, let me introduce you. This is the former general manager of the pharmaceutical Group, Wang Jian, President Wang!”

Wang Jian was in his early forties. Although his eyes were a little small, they were very bright and he looked very shrewd.

After hearing Dong Yun’s introduction, Wang Jian quickly stepped forward and said enthusiastically,””President Xia, welcome, welcome!”

Xia ruofei glanced at Wang Jian and said indifferently,””President Wang, you’ve all worked hard!”

Wang Jian was the head of the pharmaceutical Group, so he was naturally from the Liu family. Moreover, there had been various obstacles during the handover process some time ago, so Wang Jian was definitely involved. Hence, Xia ruofei did not give him a good look.

Wang Jian wryly smiled and quickly said,”Director Xia, there have been some small problems during the handover process. It’s mainly because we were not prepared in all aspects and it was a little rushed. We can’t do it well, so please forgive us, director Xia!”

Wang Jian had no other choice. As the saying goes, when the gods fight, the little devil suffers. He was only carrying out Liu Lifang’s orders. Now, Zhu Bajie was looking at himself in the mirror, feeling extremely embarrassed.

Some time ago, Xia ruofei had heard from Dong Yun that there had been a series of problems during the handover process. He had given the Liu family a warning.

The Liu family reacted quickly. Liu Qunfeng even took away his sister’s power and left her at home.

Then, Liu Qunfeng sent his confidants to Qiantang and directly fired a few of the most aggressive Pharmaceutical Group executives.Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com
