Chapter 3449: Breaking through the heavenly stairs alone (1)

Translator: 549690339

When Ling Qingxue heard this, she knew that everyone had to go through the same test. She had gone through the fifth level of the trial Pagoda with Xia ruofei. The test on that level was a chain mission with a total of three segments.

From the looks of it, Chen Xuan had failed in the process of collecting the star Fern thorn soul essence.

In reality, Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue had also completed their mission by a hair’s breadth. If their luck had been a little worse, they might have also been stopped at that stage.

Therefore, it was no surprise that Chen Xuan was eliminated on the fifth level.

Chen Xuan had obviously communicated with Yang Liu, mu Jianfei, and the others, and knew that everyone had gone through the same test. That was why he had asked Ling Qingxue which stage she had passed.

Even though Ling Qingxue was the last to come out so far, she might not have been the one to clear the levels the furthest. This was because some of the levels had no time limit, so it was entirely possible that she would be delayed for a long time on a certain level.

Ling Qingxue thought for a moment and felt that there was nothing to hide. She smiled and said,””I failed to pass the eighth level and was directly transported out…”

Chen Xuan gasped in shock. Mu Jianfei, Yu xiner, Xu yurou, and the others also had their mouths wide open in disbelief.

“Miss Ling, I didn’t expect you to actually make it to the eighth level!” Chen Xuan sighed.”Among all of us, elder yang is the one who made it the furthest. She’s only at the sixth level…”

“I’m ashamed …”Yang Liu smiled bitterly.

In fact, it was already very impressive to be able to reach the sixth level of the trial Pagoda. Ling Qingxue felt that if she were to go through the trials alone, she would probably only be able to reach the fifth level at most.

The reason why she was able to end her journey on the eighth floor was entirely because she had gotten a free ride.

However, Ling Qingxue would not take the initiative to mention that she and Xia ruofei were challenging the levels together. She only made a few modest remarks and then asked about everyone’s situation.

On the first heaven society’s side, Chen Xuan had stopped at the third round of the trial Pagoda’s fifth level. Xu yurou had been eliminated at the third level of the trial Pagoda, and Shen tianfang had yet to appear.

Elder mu Hua of the surging waves sect had yet to come out, while mu Jianfei had reached the fourth level of the trial Pagoda.

On the side of the soaring Flower Valley, the Aurous core stage elder Yang Liu was only eliminated after reaching the sixth level. Before Ling Qingxue came out, he was the one who had passed the highest number of levels. As for the Qi condensation disciple Yu Xin ’er, she had also performed exceptionally well and made it to the fifth level of the trial tower. However, she was eliminated in the first round of the mission.

Speaking of which, the first heaven society was the number one sect in the cultivation world. They had the most people going to the mystic Luna realm this time, so their overall strength was the strongest. However, their results in the trial Pagoda were average. Chen Xuan, who was in the Golden core stage, only passed the fifth level, and Xu yurou, who was in the Qi refinement stage, was eliminated in the third level. Therefore, Chen Xuan was a little depressed.

Especially when he heard that Ling Qingxue had actually made it to the eighth level, it was an even greater blow to him.

Of course, Chen Xuan also knew that Qi condensation and golden core cultivators faced different levels of difficulty.

Otherwise, Yu Xin ‘er of the flying flower Valley wouldn’t have been able to reach the fifth level.

However, in the Tower of Trials, the situation of passing the levels could still reflect the overall strength and individual potential. This was also the main reason why Chen Xuan was so depressed. Among the Xuanji Aurous core stage cultivators, Xia ruofei, Shen tianfang and mu Hua were still in the midst of challenging the levels. Their results should not be too bad. Yang Liu, who was teleported out around the same time as him, had also completed one level higher than him.

This was a huge blow to Chen Xuan, who had always been proud and arrogant.

Chen Xuan sighed and said,”it seems like I’m still lacking in training. Living in an ivory tower is indeed safe. However, it’s not conducive to the improvement of my strength! Brother RUO Fei hasn’t appeared for such a long time, so his results shouldn’t be too bad either … The gap between us is getting bigger and bigger!”

Ling Qingxue smiled and said,”your sect’s elder Chen is also in the process of breaking through!” Elder Shen was an intermediate stage golden core cultivator and his strength was outstanding. It was very possible that he could directly make it to the top of the trial Pagoda! It’s the same for elder mu of the surging waves sect. Those who are still in the trial Pagoda should have good results!”

Chen Xuan and mu Jianfei cupped their hands and said,””Thank you for your kind words, miss Ling!”

Everyone had been eliminated, so they couldn’t do anything now. They could only chat and wait in the square at the bottom of the tower.

They were mainly sharing their experiences in the trial Pagoda and analyzing their gains and losses.

Ling Qingxue also took the opportunity to secretly check on the condition of the storage ring that had appeared out of thin air in her palm when she had been teleported out.

As expected, the storage ring had no owner. Ling Qingxue secretly used her fingernail to cut her palm a little and easily succeeded in recognizing an owner. Then, she checked the situation in the storage ring and a hint of joy appeared in her eyes. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

If it wasn’t for the fact that there were so many people around her, she would definitely be overjoyed. Fortunately, she had been in the business world for so many years, so she was good at controlling her emotions and did not reveal any flaws.

However, she was already overjoyed in her heart.

This was because there were seven to eight hundred piles of yellow jade essence neatly stacked in this storage ring.

And on a piece of paper in the storage ring, it was written that this was the reward for her overall performance in the entire Tower of Trials.

Ling Qingxue had never thought that she would still be rewarded after failing to pass the eighth level of the trial Pagoda. She had already received the reward for every level she had passed.. Of course, there was no reward on the seventh level of the trial Pagoda, but she had obtained the entire heavenly cloud Palace!
