2801 An arrow at the end of its flight (2)

In addition, Spain’s rear defensive line was already an arrow at the end of its flight under bar?a’s bombardment. Even if the nerves were always tense, the attention was not as focused as it was at the beginning of the game. This was a normal physiological phenomenon and could not be shifted by personal will.

Lakiti ?’s pass was highly pressed and just went over the head of the defensive player in front. The ball was extremely fast.

Naldo, who was in charge of the defense in the middle, reacted quickly. He jumped high in the first instance and tried to head the ball to clear the siege.

However, his jump time was still a little late, causing the jump height to not be high enough. The ball was already above his head. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Naldo knew that he had bar?a’s Coutinho behind him to fight for the header with him. The ball could not be let go no matter what, so he could only barely head the ball in the direction outside the penalty area.

However, it was precisely because the height was not high enough that Naldo’s rescue only touched the bottom of the football a little, so the football’s flight trajectory did not fly out of the penalty area as he had hoped. Instead, it only changed its direction a little and continued to fall into the middle of the penalty area.

What was even more unfortunate was that the ball changed direction after Naldo grazed it. It happened to fall at the feet of zujarís, who followed up in the middle.

How could Su Ya let go of such a good opportunity? He did not even adjust and directly faced the ball with a powerful volley.

The shot also fully demonstrated zuyares ‘ability as a top striker. Although it was a high – shot, he pressed the ball fast and flat, and the football went straight to the goal like lightning.

Although the goalkeeper, Diego Lopez, tried his best to save the ball, he still could not touch the ball. In the blink of an eye, the ball had already burrowed into the net.

Three to three!

The bar?a fans in the stands cheered wildly, as if the entire nokapu was shaking.

The game was not easy. With bar?a’s strength, even if the Spaniards were arch – enemies in the same city, they were on high spirits every time they played against bar?a. However, it was difficult for them to cause trouble for bar?a.

However, the game was completely beyond their expectations. Although bar?a had the absolute initiative, the Spanish team was always in the lead from the first minute of the game, and bar?a had been playing the role of a chaser.

After the score finally reached two to one, Xia ruofei’s full moon scimitar – like pass directly triggered a classic counterattack, giving the Espanyol a two – goal lead again.

To be honest, many bar?a fans were already in despair when iglesias scored the third goal of Espanyol.

However, with zuyare s outstanding play, they finally tied the score at the end of the game!

The positive impact of a superstar’s individual performance on the team was vividly displayed in this game.

If someone had told the bar?a fans before the start of the game that bar?a would try their best to snatch a point from Espanyol and get a rare draw, the bar?a fans would have thought that the other party was talking in his sleep and would have laughed out loud without mercy.

However, at this point in the game, when Barcelona tied the score, many of the Barcelona fans had a feeling that they had won everything. Only those who had watched the game would know how hard it was to get this one point.

Of course, the game was not over yet. Barcelona, with their high morale, still had a chance to continue to score and take all three points.

When suyass scored his second personal goal of the game, the Spanish substitutes sighed. The substitutes could not help but cover their faces. The manager, Ruby, also looked depressed and frowned without saying a word.

The three points that were almost in his hands had now become one point. No manager would be happy about it.

Moreover, whether or not he could keep this one point was still a big problem!

After zuyare s goal, a large number of fans poured into the discussion area of PP sports ‘live broadcast. They all blamed Shen fangjian because Shen fangjian had just said what would happen if the Spanish team conceded the goal, and then the Spanish team really conceded the goal.

“You jinx!”

“Shen Laoshi, can you stop talking?”

“What are you thinking, saying such disheartening words at a time like this? Is this a prophecy?”

“Shen fangjian, can you still do it? How can you explain it like that?”

Shen fangjian and Jia Tianning could also see the real – time comments. They looked at each other and saw the bitter smile on each other’s faces.

However, as a commentator, he had to complete his job no matter what happened during the live broadcast.

Therefore, although Shen fangjian’s mind was a little confused, he quickly adjusted his mood and said,””In the 83rd minute of the game, Espanyol regretfully conceded a goal. In the face of bar?a’s bombarding, they were unable to maintain their lead to the end ...”

As Shen fangjian’s partner, Jia Tianning naturally had to help him out, and some words were most suitable for him to say.

So, Jia Tianning took over the conversation and said,””In fact, before the goal concede, the Spanish team was already in a very dangerous situation. Bar?a had completely taken the initiative on the field. If it were not for the goalkeeper, Diego Lopez’s excellent play, this goal concede might have come even earlier. He pounced on several of the opponent’s sure – goal!”

Shen fangjian looked at Jia Tianning gratefully and said,””Naldo has a certain responsibility for this ball, but now that it’s already like this, there’s no point in blaming anyone. First of all, they have to adjust their mentality and do a good job of defense in the last few minutes. Even if this game ends in a draw, Spain can completely leave nokapu with their heads held high!”

This time, Shen fangjian did not dare to say how dangerous the Spanish team’s situation was or how likely bar?a would score another goal. After Wu Lei joined the Spanish team, many of the fans watching the football game in China naturally became fans of the Spanish team. Even though there were many bar?a fans in China, they would still choose to support Espanyol when bar?a was up against Espanyol. To be more precise, they would choose to support Xia ruofei and Wu Lei.

The most representative point of view was that they wanted Barcelona to win, and at the same time, they wanted Wu Lei and Xia ruofei to score goals.

If Shen fangjian were to jinx it again, he would really drown in the fans ‘spittle.

……

At nokapu Stadium, zujarís did not celebrate after the goal either. He still rushed into the goal to pick up the football and ran towards the center circle. As he ran, he waved to his teammates who had rushed up to celebrate, signaling for them to quickly return to their half.

It was clear that zuyare was still not satisfied with the score.

In other words, this was the common thought of all the bar?a players. Facing a team like RCD Espanyol, even if they were forced to a draw, it would be a great shame for bar?a. Only by taking all three points could they be barely satisfied.

The Spanish players were all breathless, and everyone could read a deep fatigue in each other’s eyes.

At this point, they were no longer thinking about continuing to fight for goals. They just wanted to do their best to defend and keep the current one point.

It was better to get one point than three points!

Soon, the referee resumed the game.

Bar?a’s morale had reached its peak, while the Spanish had no fighting spirit at all.

In the face of such a situation, with only about ten minutes left in the game, bar?a was naturally not willing to only score one point.

Therefore, they still pressed on the entire front line and tore through the Spanish defense through quick transmission.

Xia ruofei and Wu Lei had also retreated to their own half of the field. The two of them had chosen to force a shot from the high position at the same time, unlike the other players who fought and retreated.

Without the support of their teammates, Xia ruofei and Wu Lei’s efforts were not effective.

Of course, the Spaniards ‘luck was not bad. Barcelona had not been able to break through their goal, so the score was still 3 – 3. If the game ended with this score, both sides would have a point each.

Soon, the game had reached the 90th minute. The fourth official on the sidelines raised a sign, showing that the stoppage time was six minutes long ...
