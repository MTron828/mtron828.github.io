1976 Reward based on merits (1)

In the small conference room of the Presidential Suite on the top floor.

Feng Rao and the others sat in their seats with faces full of joy, their excitement still not completely calmed down.

In particular, Liu Qian, who was in charge of such an important project for the first time, was so excited that her words were overflowing.

Xia ruofei made a pot of Dahongpao tea and walked into the small meeting room.

“Chairman, we’ve really struck it rich this time!” Pang Hao immediately said. The total transaction amount was over 100 million US dollars! The name of our paradise Corporation will definitely resound throughout Hong Kong ... No, it will soon resound throughout the country!”

“Yes, Chairman!” Liu Qian also said excitedly. You didn’t see the expressions on the media reporters ‘faces. None of them could believe it! I’m really looking forward to how the Hong Kong media will report about this auction tomorrow!”

“Alright, alright! Wasn’t it just an auction? Just look at your useless faces!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”sit down! Pour yourself some tea!”

In fact, he was only calm on the surface, but he was still a little excited inside.

Paradise Corporation was like his own child. He had built it up from scratch. Although his desire for money was no longer as strong as before, every bit of progress in the company could still give him an unparalleled sense of achievement.

Feng Jing and Dong Yun were relatively calm. They weren’t as overjoyed as pang Hao and Liu Qian, but they were also very happy. Even Dong Yun, who usually didn’t smile, had her lips curled up into a beautiful arc.

“Chairman,” Feng Jing asked,”we’ve pretty much settled everything here. What’s our next step? do you have any plans?”

Xia ruofei sat down and said,”today, I gathered everyone here for a small meeting to discuss a few things.” First, Mr. MA of Hengfeng group agreed with me yesterday that Hengfeng group will only collect operating costs for this auction, so the Commission from the auction house may save a lot of money. ”

“I’ll go! I’m not dreaming!” Hearing this, pang Hao shouted,”such a huge sum of money. You’re just going to waive it?”

The auction house’s commission rate was generally not low. Some even reached 20% to 30% of the transaction volume, and both sellers had to pay this fee.

Today’s transaction amount had reached 100 million US dollars. In other words, a casual word from MA Xiong had left paradise Corporation with at least 10 to 20 million US dollars in expenses. Compared to the High Commission rate, Hengfeng group’s cost was actually not high. It was nothing more than the cost of some hotel rooms, conference rooms, banquet halls, print media, television media, building advertisements, and other resources. There was also the labor expenses. All these would at most be one to two million US dollars.

“Chairman, Are you sure?” Dong Yun asked,”did you sign any written agreement with the Hengfeng group?”

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”this was an oral agreement between the chairmen of our two groups. What agreement is there to sign?” But don’t worry, even though the transaction price is a bit high, since Mr. MA said so, he will definitely fulfill his promise. Director pang will be personally in charge of the settlement. Is there a problem?”

To MA Xiong, he couldn’t wait to give Xia ruofei more benefits. He wouldn’t even frown if it was 100 or 200 million, let alone 10 or 20 million USD.

“No problem!” Pang Hao immediately replied. But ... What if the Hengfeng auction house still pays us according to the Commission rate stated in the previous agreement?”

“Then we’ll do as they say!” Xia ruofei replied without hesitation,”but the possibility of this is very low. Mr. MA must have already informed them. Of course, it will take some time to calculate the cost. We just have to wait for them to inform us!”

“Alright!” Pang Hao said.

Xia ruofei continued,”the second thing is that I will keep 10 million dollars from this auction to invest in the company. I have other uses for the remaining money. Is that okay?”

Feng Jing, Dong Yun, and the others looked at each other, then immediately said,””Of course, no problem. The items today were basically prepared by the chairman. In fact, it has little to do with the company. Even if you take all the proceeds from the auction, we won’t have any objections!”

Actually, Xia ruofei’s decision was exactly what Feng Jing wanted. She held a small portion of the company’s shares, and most of the items for the auction were prepared by Xia ruofei himself. If she were to hand the money directly to paradise Corporation, Feng Jing would feel uneasy. Based on her estimation of 100 million US dollars, Feng Jing’s share of the company would be around one to two million US dollars after deducting taxes. Without making any contributions, this money would be a hot potato to her.

Dong Yun also knew that paradise Corporation was Xia ruofei’s private company. Although she felt that it was inappropriate for Xia ruofei to take away so much of his funds and collect more or less, she naturally wouldn’t jump out to object since Feng Jing had already expressed her stance.

As for pang haohe and Liu Qian, they had no objections.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”then it’s decided!” I’ll have the Hengfeng auction house transfer 10 million US dollars directly to the company’s account in the form of the proceeds from the auction. Remember to check the company’s account as soon as possible to make sure there are no mistakes!”

“I understand! Just leave it to me!” Pang Hao said with a grin.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”alright, I’m done with my work. Let’s talk about something easy. Liu Qian has worked hard for this auction!” You’ve done well!”

Liu Qian was so excited that her face turned red. She quickly stood up and said,”Chairman, this is part of my job. I’m just doing my best to complete the task you gave me ...”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”there’s no need to be too humble. If you’re not capable enough, you might not be able to do well no matter how enthusiastic you are.” President Feng, it seems that Liu Qian is also a talent that can be molded!”

“Yup! Liu Qian is still very smart!” Feng Jing smiled.”I’m good at my work!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””This time, Liu Qian has made a great contribution to the success of the auction, so I should reward her well ...”

“Chairman, no need, no need!” Liu Qian quickly waved her hand and said,”my salary is already very high, and the company’s business trip subsidies are also very high!”

“A salary is a salary, and what should be rewarded should still be rewarded! A clear reward and punishment can promote everyone’s enthusiasm in work!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”let me think ...”

Xia ruofei thought for a moment and smiled.””How about this! Aren’t we in Hong Kong? We’ll give you a bag in the name of the company! It’s a good time for you to relax and go out for a walk! President Feng, director Dong, you guys pick a good one for Liu Qian. It’s not good to have a low grade! If it’s too cheap, I’ll hold you guys responsible!”

“Chairman, there’s really no need ...” Liu Qian said with some embarrassment.

She knew that since Xia ruofei had asked for it, it must not be an ordinary bag. There were many luxury stores in Hong Kong. Due to the difference in tax, it was much cheaper to buy things here than in mainland China. She had wanted to take advantage of the end of the auction to shop around and buy some cosmetics and bags to bring back.

Feng Rao laughed and said,”Liu Qian, the chairman has already spoken, so don’t decline!” The company’s been making a lot of profits recently, so it’s not a big deal to give you a bag. You’ve been working too hard recently, so you should be rewarded!”

“Yup! Big Boss Xia is rich and generous now, please don’t pick something too cheap! He’ll think you’re looking down on him!” Pang Hao chuckled.

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry,”why does it sound so bad when you say it?” Am I that nouveau riche who reeks of money?”

“No, no, no!” Pang Hao smiled apologetically.”I’m complimenting you!”

“Is there anyone who praises others like you?” Xia ruofei said,”the last time you were beaten up, it was also because you praised others like this, right?”

Pfft ... The three girls burst into laughter, and the atmosphere in the meeting room became very relaxed.

After a few jokes, Xia ruofei said,”I still have some other things to deal with in Hong Kong. If it’s not urgent, don’t go back. The company will pay for your expenses for the few days you stay in Hong Kong!”

“Chairman, we’ve already discussed it downstairs,” said Feng Jing.”We’re going back tomorrow. ” “After all, the company just moved not long ago. There are so many senior management executives now, and I’m a little worried ...”

Dong Yun, pang Hao, and Liu Qian immediately nodded. It was clear that they had reached an agreement.

Xia ruofei said,”you’re leaving tomorrow?” Then I’ll tell Captain Liu to ...”

“No need, Chairman, we’ve already booked our tickets!” Feng Jing hurriedly said,”the flight is at FiveO’ clock in the afternoon tomorrow, so we can take a look around Hong Kong during the day. The cost of using the business jet is quite high, and it’s paid by the Kyushu group. We don’t need to be so extravagant!”

Xia ruofei shook his head with a bitter smile and said,”why are you guys being so polite with me ... Fine!” Since that’s the case, you can take the commercial plane back! However, all of you will be in first class! If you bought an economy class ticket, call for an upgrade now! I’ve made a lot of money in Hong Kong this time. If you guys go back to Sanshan in Economy Class, what will the staff think of me? Pang Hao, you’re the Chief Financial Officer, so you’ll be in charge of this!”

Feng Jing and the others had indeed booked Economy Class. Pang Hao did not stand on ceremony with Xia ruofei. He smiled and said,””Good! Immediately execute the leader’s instructions!”

“That’s all. From now on, you can move freely, but be careful!” Xia ruofei said,”if you need a car, just ask the hotel. They will arrange it for you!”

“Alright! Chairman, we’ll go back to our room first. You should also rest!” Feng Rao stood up and said.

“En!” Xia ruofei stood up and sent Feng Jing and the rest to the door before returning to the house.

He went to the deck chair on the balcony and laid down comfortably. He took out his mobile phone and browsed the news. Nowadays, the efficiency of the online media was very high. He also wanted to see if there were any reports about the auction in Hong Kong.

After a while, her phone vibrated.

Xia ruofei took a look and saw that it was old Blake.

Xia ruofei knew what was going on. He smiled and swiped the screen to answer the call.

“Mr. Blake!” Xia ruofei greeted him with a smile.

“Xia! Congratulations, the auction was a great success!” Old Blake said in a warm voice.

“Thank you! Same! I can see that your black family has also made a lot of money from this auction!” Xia ruofei said. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“No, no, no!” Old Blake said,”the competition was too fierce this time. We only got two truffles, which is far from enough to meet our business needs.”

Xia ruofei smiled and did not say anything. Old Blake continued,””By the way, Xia, did you mention yesterday that you wanted to import a batch of Strasburg geese? A batch of 50 young geese can be packed into boxes and transported to China by air at any time!”
