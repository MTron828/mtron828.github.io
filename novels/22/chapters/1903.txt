Chapter 1904 Without anyone knowing (1)

A few minutes later, Xu Yougang had taken the same route and climbed over the wall of the community without anyone noticing.

After returning to the car, Xu Yougang took off his glasses and Bluetooth earphones as he said,””I’ve already confirmed the location! Building 3, Room 1902!”

“That’s great!” Wang Chong said,”squad leader Xu, the next step of our work is very clear!”

“En!” Xu Yougang nodded and said,”call liangzi and Aijun over. I’ll assign them some simple tasks!”

Very quickly, Zeng Liang and Zhang Aijun also arrived in the van.

Xu Yougang believed that it was almost impossible for Liu haojun and Fang Chenchen to go out at this time, so he temporarily relaxed the surveillance and only asked Wang Chong to pay attention to the situation at the entrance of the community.

He briefly explained the process of his investigation and then said,””From tomorrow onwards, we’ll focus on monitoring Liu haojun and Fang Chenchen. I’ll split up the work: Tomorrow morning, I’ll sneak back to the district. Wang Chong will be in charge of following Fang Chenchen, liangzi will be in charge of Liu haojun, and Aijun will be my backup outside the district. ”

“Understood!” The three of them nodded at the same time.

Everyone had been comrades for many years, and they were very familiar with each other’s coordination.

Xu Yougang briefly mentioned a few things to take note of, mainly emphasizing the issue of safety. Finally, he said,””Alright, everyone, get into position! We’ll take turns to keep watch tonight. Try to ensure that you get enough sleep!”

Zeng Liang and Zhang Aijun returned to their Volkswagen Jetta and went to the North exit of the residential area.

“I’m going to sneak into the neighborhood before the sun rises tomorrow. I might need to wake up earlier, so you can rest for the night. It’ll be your turn after midnight. Is that alright?” Xu Yougang said to Wang Chong.

“No problem!” Wang Chong grinned and said,”squad leader Xu, actually, it’s fine for me to stay up all night. You can go to sleep! I’ll wake you up at FiveO’ clock!” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Xu Yougang waved his hand and said,”you must also ensure that you get a certain amount of sleep. Tomorrow’s task is very heavy. If you don’t sleep well, it’s easy to lose focus. I don’t need to teach you this, do I?” Quickly go to sleep!”

“Yes!” Wang Chong said.

He crawled to the last row, quickly put on his sleeping bag, curled up in the seat, and closed his eyes quietly.

Quickly entering deep sleep was also a skill that they had to master in the Army. Only by making good use of all the time that they could rest could they always maintain an abundance of physical strength.

Thus, after lying down for a few minutes, Wang Chong began to snore softly.

Xu Yougang leaned back in his seat, his eyes glancing at the gate of the community from time to time, maintaining a moderate state of vigilance.

At around eleveno’ clock at night, Wang Chong had already woken up before Xu Yougang could call for his shift. He quickly tidied up his sleeping bag and walked to the front row.”Class monitor Xu, it’s almost time. You should quickly go and sleep!”

Xu Yougang didn’t argue. He said as he moved to the back,””Wake me up at around FiveO’ clock! If there are any special circumstances, wake me up at any time!”

“Understood!” Wang Chong said.

They were all old comrades who had worked together for many years. They trusted each other very much. Xu Yougang did not say anything more. He quickly found his sleeping bag, lay down in the back of the van, and quickly fell asleep.

At 5 am, Wang Chong woke Xu You up.

Xu Yougang sat up and asked,””Is there any situation?”

“It’s so calm!” Wang Chong smiled and said,”class monitor Xu, the sky is still dark! Do you want to sleep for another hour?”

Xu Yougang got out of his sleeping bag and said,””The visibility is quite low now. We have to get into the community first, otherwise there will be more people doing morning exercises later!”

He packed up the equipment he needed for the day as fast as he could and stuffed them into his Casual Backpack. Then, he changed into a set of gray sportswear and tied a headband around his forehead, looking like someone who was doing a morning run.

Xu Yougang opened the door of the van and said,””Wang Chong, I’m going in! If there’s any situation, inform me through the walkie – talkie immediately!”

“Don’t worry! Class monitor Xu!” Wang Chong made an “OK” gesture at Xu Yougang.

Xu You had just closed the car door and jogged toward the wall on the side of the community.

At this moment, Zeng Liang’s voice came from his headphones,””Squad leader Xu, Liu haojun’s car just entered the community from the North exit!”

Following which, Wang Chong’s voice sounded from the earpiece.”So early! It can’t be, right?”

Xu Yougang said calmly,”the driver must have come in advance and was ready to serve Liu haojun at any time. Liu haojun shouldn’t have left so early!” Liangzi, Wang Chong, you two focus your attention. I’ll be keeping you updated of the situation even if I’m in the estate!”

“Understood!”

“Understood!”

Wang Chong and Zeng Liang’s voices came through his earpiece.

Xu Yougang quickly found the blind spot of yesterday’s surveillance camera. He looked around and saw no one. He immediately jumped over the fence.

The street lights in the neighborhood were dim, and it was very quiet.

At this hour, most people were still asleep. Other than the patrolling security guards, everyone else should be asleep.

Xu Yougang quickly found a hidden place. It was a flower garden on the east side of the square. He hid in the low bushes. Even if it was dawn, it was hard to see him from the outside if he did not deliberately go into the bushes to look for him.
