Chapter 1464: Retribution (1)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei didn’t chat with Liang Weimin for too long and quickly hung up.

After the call, Xia ruofei did not look at Bai Jingjing and store manager Liu again. Ye Lingyun had already helped pang Hao into the car. Xia ruofei patted Guan Ping’s shoulder and said,””Ping Zi, let’s go!”

“Alright!” Guan Ping didn’t pay any more attention to Bai Jingjing and store manager Liu, who both had ugly expressions on their faces. He opened the back door and got in.

Ye Lingyun was quiet as usual. Since Xia ruofei said that he did not need to deal with this matter, he would do his best. Without a word, he got into the driver’s seat, started the car, and drove away.

Bai Jingjing and store manager Liu stood in the same place, watching Knight XV leave in a cloud of dust.

The two of them were silent for a long time. Bai Jingjing finally couldn’t help but say,””Old Liu, this man ... He’s probably bluffing, right? That uncle Liang or whatever, the company doesn’t have a Senior Manager with the surname Liang ...”

Store manager Liu said unhappily,””You’re asking me, but who should I ask? What should I say about you? She had already seen that he had an extraordinary identity, and he wasn’t prepared to do anything, so what was the point of trying to argue? Now it’s like this ...”

Bai Jingjing’s eyes reddened and she said pitifully,””I just can’t stand it! What right does he have to say that about me?”

Bai Jingjing was full of seduction. She almost subconsciously made such a coquettish expression. If it was any other time, store manager Liu would have been enchanted, but now, he felt a little disgusted ...

Bai Jingjing saw that store manager Liu didn’t say anything and felt even more uncertain. She couldn’t help but comfort herself.””I’m sure he’s fine! They were just a few rich young men, how powerful could they be? He’s definitely looking for a way out ...”

Store manager Liu was annoyed and said,””Alright, alright, no matter what, it’s always right to be more restrained in the future! Go back! I’m a little tired today ...”

Store manager Liu had already booked a room at a nearby hotel and was prepared to have sex with Bai Jingjing that night. But after what had happened, he was no longer in the mood. He directly wanted to return home.

Bai Jingjing pouted and said,””I’ll go back! You’re the one who asked me out, and now you’re the one who wants to leave, Hmph ...”

Store manager Liu secretly shook his head, thinking that it was better to not provoke this brainless woman in the future. Although she was naturally charming and good in bed, she was also easy to cause trouble! He didn’t even know if this was a blessing or a curse today ...

The two of them stood by the road, ready to take a taxi home.

While they were waiting for the taxi, both manager Liu and Bai Jingjing’s phones rang.

The two of them looked at each other and saw a trace of uneasiness in each other’s eyes. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

They took out their phones and quickly glanced at the caller ID.

“It’s Vice – President Jiang!”

“Manager Xu!”

The two of them said at the same time.

Vice President Jiang was in charge of all the stores in store manager Liu’s area, and store manager Xu was the head of the store where Bai Jingjing was. They were both direct bosses of the two.

“Let’s talk after we accept it!” Store manager Liu frowned and said,”stay away from me! Don’t let the leader hear this!”

With that, store manager Liu quickly walked away with his phone in his hand, then quickly answered the call.””Hello, President Jiang! May I know what instructions you have ...”

Store manager Liu’s tone unconsciously carried a hint of flattery, but Vice President Jiang on the other end of the phone obviously didn’t buy it.

Before store manager Liu could finish, Vice – President Jiang scolded,””Liu Chengdong, you bastard! If you don’t want to work here, don’t drag us down with you!”

Store manager Liu was dumbfounded by the scolding. He stuttered,””President ... President Jiang ... I ... What did I do wrong? please ... Please tell me ...”

Xia ruofei’s figure appeared in store manager Liu’s mind unconsciously, but he quickly forced himself not to think in that direction. He felt that it must be a coincidence. Even if the young man had a certain background, the company couldn’t have reacted so quickly. How many minutes had it been? And it was the night of the third day of the new year.

However, Vice – President Jiang’s next words completely shattered store manager Liu’s hopes of getting lucky.

“Liu Chengdong, how else do you want me to make it clear?” asked Vice President Jiang. Don’t you know what you’ve done? Where are you now? Is he with that Vixen, Bai Jingjing? What did you guys do just now?”

“I ... I ...” Store manager Liu felt his vision go dark and he almost fainted. He said timidly,”Mr. Jiang, we had a small misunderstanding with a gentleman just now, but ...”

“I don’t want to hear any explanation!” Vice President Jiang interrupted store manager Liu’s words domineeringly,”I hope to see your resignation letter tomorrow! This is a direct order from director Cai!”

Manager Liu suddenly felt a chill down his spine. Director Cai was the chairman of pioneer real estate and the largest shareholder of the company. This young man’s phone call had even alerted director Cai in less than ten minutes. What kind of monster had he provoked?

Store manager Liu’s intestines were about to turn green with regret, and his mind kept replaying the words that Xia ruofei had said to that “uncle Liang” on the phone. They once threatened my brother that even if he left pioneer real estate, he would not be able to survive in the real estate agency industry in San Shan. Then ...

Thinking of this, store manager Liu felt his legs go weak.

As expected, Vice – President Jiang continued coldly,””Let me remind you, don’t even think about applying for a job at other companies in the same industry. Don’t forget that you’ve all signed a competition agreement! Even if there’s no competition agreement, director Cai still has some face in the industry. If he says so, no one will want you!”
