Chapter 1767: Xiangnan TV’s olive branch (1)

The story of tycoon Li and Xu lang was even more legendary.

At that time, tycoon li had not yet made a fortune. Xu lang asked him after he met him,””How much wealth do you want to have in the future before you’ll be satisfied?”

Li’s answer was 30 million.

Xu lang smiled and said,”your future wealth will far exceed thirty million!” The wealth in your life isn’t flat, it’s free. You’ll definitely become the richest man in Hong Kong in the future!”

Everyone knew what happened next. Li’s business went out of control. Not only was he the richest man in Hong Kong, but everyone also thought that he was the richest man in the world.

Zhao Yongjun also talked about Xu Lang’s views on life, which touched Xia ruofei.

Xu lang had always emphasized on the cycle of cause and effect. He said that business should be done on the right path. He had a kind of good fortune, and success was only a matter of time. With good fortune, fate would naturally come quickly, and there was no rush.

When he helped the rich to look at Feng Shui, he often told them to treat people with sincerity and to do their best to benefit the people.

After hearing this, Xia ruofei’s admiration for Xu lang rose.

To be honest, he didn’t pay much attention to Feng Shui metaphysics in the past. Before he got the spirit map space, he was an atheist through and through and didn’t believe in these things that science couldn’t explain.

After seeing Xu Lang’s style today, Xia ruofei realized that there were people worthy of respect in every industry. The metaphysics of Feng Shui was not as simple as he had thought.

Xia ruofei and Zhao Yongjun didn’t talk much as guests kept coming over to greet Zhao Yongjun. Most of them were here to ask about the membership.

It was a bit of an exaggeration to say that everything in the club was only in the blueprint. The design had not even been completed, and there were already people fighting to apply for membership.

Just a day ago, rumors about the land being haunted and uninhabitable were still spreading.

Zhao Yongjun didn’t expect the results of this groundbreaking ceremony to be so good. They didn’t make any preparations for this, and they didn’t even set the membership fees yet.

So, Zhao Yongjun could only give a rough answer to the people who came to ask, but he promised that once he started to attract members, he would consider the guests who were here today first.

Actually, this was very normal. Whoever attended the groundbreaking ceremony must have a good relationship with Zhao Yongjun and the others, and they had a certain amount of influence in the upper circles. Weren’t these people the club’s target customers?

Liu haofan and Zhao Yongjun were almost sworn enemies. No matter how influential he was, no matter how well the club did, they couldn’t expect him to support the club.

Zhao Yongjun was handling the guests, and Xu lang was surrounded by many guests asking questions. Xia ruofei wanted to express his gratitude in person, but he couldn’t squeeze in. He brought Ling Qingxue to a less crowded place and found a chair to sit down and rest.

At this moment, Hou Liang walked over with a slightly chubby middle – aged man.

“Brother Xia, sister – in – Law!” Hou Liang greeted them from afar.

“Liangzi, you’ve worked hard!” Xia ruofei stood up and smiled.

Ling Qingxue also smiled and nodded at Hou Liang.

“Hehe, I’m full of energy when I work for myself, how can it be hard!” Hou Liang chuckled as he spoke. He then pointed to the middle – aged man beside him and said,”brother Xia, let me introduce you. This is xiangnan TV’s Deputy station head, Gao Jun. He’s in charge of the variety section.”

Xiangnan satellite TV’s variety shows were basically the best in the country. It was also the guarantee of revenue for the entire television station. The Deputy Director in charge of the variety section should have a very high status in the television station.

Xia ruofei looked at the tall and handsome Deputy Director, who was neither tall nor handsome, and said gently,””Hello, Gao tai!”

Gao Jun smiled and said,”President Xia, it’s a pleasure to meet you!” President Xia’s heroic deeds from before have earned my respect. I’m your fan now!”

“I don’t dare to accept it, you’ve overpraised me!” Xia ruofei said in a neutral tone.

“Brother Xia, director Gao has some things he wants to discuss with you ...” Hou Liang said.

Xia ruofei knew that Hou Liang didn’t bring Gao Jun over just to say hello. He thought for a while and asked,””Liangzi, is it about the thing you mentioned before?”

Xia ruofei was asking about their backup plan, Yingluo, bringing in xiangnan TV’s reality show.

Hou Liang slightly nodded.

Gao Jun observed her expression and said with a smile,””Mr. Xia, Mr. Hou has mentioned to me about introducing the next season of the life I’ve been longing for. I’m taking advantage of the fact that your club is building a foundation to come and take a look. The scenery here is very beautiful, and there are hot springs nearby. The atmosphere in the countryside is also very good. I personally hope to make this cooperation happen!”

Xia ruofei thought,’it’s mainly because of what uncle Xu said!

In terms of scenery and country ambiance, there were many places in Huaxia that fit the criteria. Even with his relationship with Hou Liang, Xia ruofei and the others didn’t show any obvious intention to cooperate. Gao Jun’s initiative must be because of uncle Xu.

Xia ruofei was not very optimistic about this plan. The public was not the club’s potential customers. Moreover, the effect of the groundbreaking ceremony had exceeded their expectations. It could be said that the negative effects of the previous rumors had completely disappeared. There was no need to bring in a show.

Hence, Xia ruofei said tactfully,””Gaotai, regarding the club’s operations, it’s mainly handled by Zhao Yongjun’s big brother. I’m not personally involved ...”

Xia ruofei’s refusal was obvious, but Gao Jun’s smile didn’t fade. He said,””President Xia, I’m not going to beat around the bush. I’m on good terms with director hou and young master hou. Young master hou said that he only follows President Xia’s lead! I think as long as you agree, you won’t object, right?”

Xia ruofei looked at Hou Liang and revealed a helpless expression. Hou Liang also smiled awkwardly. This Gao Jun was like a sticky candy. He had no choice but to push Xia ruofei out.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”Gaotai, I’m sorry. We don’t have any plans to work with a reality show for the time being. Our next step is still to focus on the overall planning of the club and the basic construction.”

Gao Jun smiled and said,”President Xia, don’t be in such a hurry to refuse. Can you give me three minutes?” I hope to tell you more about our show in detail. ”

“No problem!” Xia ruofei shrugged.

After all, he was a Deputy station head of a provincial station with real power. Moreover, he was personally introduced by Hou Liang. He still had to give him some face.

Gao Jun had already organized his words, so he said directly,””I don’t want to say too much about the show itself. We’re a reality show that returns to rural life. So far, the show has been produced for two seasons. In the first season, no one was optimistic about the show and felt that it was boring. I was the one who agreed to produce it.”

Gao Jun paused before continuing,””Our business partners are also not interested in this show. When the first season first started, there was no title sponsor and there weren’t many advertisements. You could say that it was just ‘streaking’. But when the show ended, the viewership ratings were already at the top. Mango TV, 1.53 billion views; Weibo with the same name, 3 billion views, 2.98 million comments ...”

Gao Jun was obviously a pragmatic leader. The show’s data was at his fingertips, so he must have remembered it in his heart.

Xia ruofei nodded and listened very carefully, although he still didn’t understand what Gao Jun was trying to say.

Gao Jun continued,”the second season just ended. The results were even more dazzling. It dominated the charts every week. I won’t go into the details ...”

At this point, Gao Jun’s eyes became a little eager. He looked at Xia ruofei and said,””Director Xia, I’m telling you all this because I want to tell you that this is a phenomenal variety show. It has already accumulated a good reputation and a stable audience base. As long as the quality of our show doesn’t decline in season three, it’s inevitable that we’ll shine!”

Xia ruofei nodded.”Gao tai, congratulations on your good results. In fact, I like your show very much. It fits my attitude towards life very well.”

Just as Gao Jun was rejoicing, Xia ruofei changed the topic and said,””However, although this show is very dazzling, it doesn’t mean that we are interested in cooperating. Gao tai, I’ll tell you the truth! I don’t think the audience of this show matches the potential customers of our club. This kind of cooperation doesn’t really promote the development of the club, so I’m very sorry ...”

Gao Jun was stunned for a moment before he smiled and said,””President Xia, I admit that you’re right, but this won’t be a loss for you, right?”

Xia ruofei threw up his hands and said,”of course!” Perhaps after the club’s reputation had risen, they would need to invest more energy in the security of the club! But it’s nothing ...”

Gao Jun nodded and said,”then let’s discuss the prospects of a win – win cooperation!” President Xia, I would like to say first that once our program is settled here and broadcasted, the negative rumors on the internet should be completely reversed! I know that today’s groundbreaking ceremony was very successful, but after all, the spread is limited. Maybe the ordinary people are not the club’s target group, but to be able to completely eliminate the rumors on a wide scale, it should be a benefit for you, right?”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”although we don’t care, this is a good thing ...”

Gao Jun smiled and continued.”Then, let me talk about the second benefit ... Director Xia, if this cooperation is successful, I can now give you a first – Class advertising cooperation position on behalf of the station. It’s free!”DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎
