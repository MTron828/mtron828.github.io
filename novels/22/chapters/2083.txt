Xia ruofei’s words were like a shot in the arm, and all the executives were invigorated.

The company’s ability to make money was terrifying, and all the executives present were well aware of it. The salary that paradise Corporation offered to these executives was already much higher than the average salary in the industry. If they could even get a share, even if it was only a little more than 0.1%, it would be a huge fortune in the long run!

Xia ruofei was not exaggerating when he said that he could create a house full of millionaires, multi – millionaires, and even billionaires. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei looked around and saw everyone’s excitement. As the head of the company, Xia ruofei did not need to have too many tactics. He only needed to grasp everyone’s needs and psychology, and that was enough to mobilize everyone’s enthusiasm.

He stood up with a smile and said,””Alright, everyone’s been busy with work recently, so you can all go back! The company’s future belongs to all of us! Dismissed!”

Xia ruofei greeted everyone and entered his office through the door on the other side of the meeting room. Feng Jing and the others left the meeting room through the door on the opposite side.

Xia ruofei walked to his desk as he took out his phone and called Qin Lan.

“Mr. Xia!” Her phone rang and Qin Lan immediately picked up. She had been holding her phone in her hand, waiting for Xia ruofei to call.

“I’m sorry, manager Qin,”said Xia ruofei. I was in a meeting at the company just now ...”

“No, no!” Qin Lan quickly replied. I’ve disturbed you! Mr. Xia, may I ask if you’re free now?”

“I’m done with my meeting. Manager Qin, is my yacht here?” Xia ruofei asked.

“Yes, I am!” Qin Lan said,”if it’s convenient for you now, please come over and receive it!”

You’ve already reached that warehouse?” Xia ruofei was a little surprised and said immediately,”please wait for a while. I’ll drive over now!”

“It doesn’t matter, it doesn’t matter!” Qin Lan said repeatedly,”drive slowly. We’re not in a hurry!”

“Alright, see you later!” Xia ruofei said.

Then, he picked up his bag and car keys from the table and walked out of the office.

As soon as she went out, Yao Xin quickly stood up and greeted her.

Xia ruofei said casually,”Xiao Yao, I’m going out for a while. I might not be back by noon. If you don’t have anything else to do, you should go back to President Feng’s place first!”

“Yes, Chairman!” Yao Xin quickly said.

Xia ruofei took the elevator to the underground parking lot. After getting his car, he went straight to the warehouse.

Fortunately, it was already past the rush hour and there was still some time before noon, so the traffic was not too congested. Xia ruofei was able to maintain a relatively high speed on the Second Ring Road. He arrived at the warehouse in about 20 minutes.

From afar, Xia ruofei could already see a large truck parked at the entrance of the warehouse. The Atlantis 34 small yacht that he had tried out yesterday was fixed on the flat trailer behind it.

The Knight XV had a striking appearance. Qin Lan and Liao Bo, who had seen Xia ruofei drive the car, naturally saw it from afar. Before Xia ruofei’s car reached the warehouse, Qin Lan had already brought Liao Bo out to welcome him.

“Mr. Xia!” Qin Lan greeted him warmly.

Xia ruofei parked the car by the side, leaving some space for the trailer to reverse. Then, he jumped out of the car and smiled.”Manager Qin, sorry to keep you waiting! Why didn’t you give me a call before you left?”

Qin Lan said with a smile,”our service principle is customer first. We can wait for the customer for an hour or two. It doesn’t matter. However, we can’t allow the customer to arrive before we do.”

“You’ve worked hard!” Xia ruofei said,”I’ll go open the door first!”

With that, Xia ruofei quickly went to open the warehouse door.

This warehouse was more than enough to store a yacht that was more than 10 meters long. The door of the warehouse was also designed to be very high, so the flat trailer could be completely overturned in.

After the warehouse was opened, Liao Bo immediately ordered the workers to start directing the car to reverse. Xia ruofei and Qin Lan also watched from the side.

Xia ruofei saw that the parts of the yacht that were in direct contact with the tow truck, as well as other important parts such as the propeller, were all tightly protected with soft foam. He could not help but nod in his heart.

The car was slowly being reversed, and a group of workers went into the warehouse to set up the frame for the yacht.

Although they didn’t know why Xia ruofei wanted to put the yacht in the warehouse, the Yacht Club had made proper arrangements. They made a solid support for the yacht to be placed. This was to ensure its safety and also to make it easier for Xia ruofei to transport it next time.

After the flatbed arrived, the small cranes and forklifts that had been prepared earlier were also driven in. The workers jumped on the flatbed and started to fix the hook. Everyone had a clear division of labor. Some were responsible for stabilizing the yacht, some were responsible for observing, and some were responsible for protecting.

After a while, the yacht was firmly hung up, and then the flat trailer was driven out of the warehouse. The workers helped the yacht adjust its direction little by little, and finally accurately landed on the frame.

Xia ruofei looked at the workers who were skillfully fixing the equipment. He wanted them to stop fixing the equipment because he would have to release the equipment later. Not only did the workers work for nothing, but he also had to go through another troublesome process.
