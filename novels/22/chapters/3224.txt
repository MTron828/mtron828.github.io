3225 Chapter 1760 – Full of worries (2)

“Grand uncle – Master, I’m incompetent ...” Li Yifu said directly,”the negotiation failed. The other party has many concerns. The temptation of money alone is not enough ...”

“What are you going to do?” Xia ruofei asked after some thought.

“If the soft approach doesn’t work, I can only use the hard approach!” Li Yifu said,”I’m just reporting to you. Next, I might use some methods that cultivators use. Please rest assured, martial granduncle, this disciple will definitely settle this matter as soon as possible!” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Xia ruofei said,”don’t be in a hurry. Let’s wait!” I’m going to the United States. Anyway, you can make plans after I get there!”

“Senior granduncle, it’s all this disciple’s fault for not doing my job properly. I’ve troubled you to travel such a long distance ...” Li Yifu said with some fear.

“Whether things are going well on your side or not, I have to come over.” Xia ruofei said,”I don’t have much to do these few days. I might as well come over earlier!” Foster husband, don’t act rashly before I arrive in the United States, understand?”

“Yes! Martial granduncle, this disciple will be waiting for you in Silicon Valley!” Li Yifu said respectfully.

Xia ruofei told Chen Nanfeng and the others about his plan to go to United States

Chen Nanfeng and the others had no interest in going to the United States, but they did not dare to trust Xia ruofei completely and let him go to the United States alone to deal with the spacesuits. So after some discussion, they decided to let Chen Xuan go with Xia ruofei. On the other hand, Liu Mansha had asked Yu xiner to go with them, saying that she wanted to broaden her horizons.

As for the Cang lang sect, Mu Sheng trusted Xia ruofei. He also knew that at this critical stage of their cooperation, the possibility of Xia ruofei and the others abandoning the Cang lang sect was extremely low.

Therefore, Mu Sheng simply didn’t send anyone.

On Xia ruofei’s side, he still brought Song Wei and Ling Qingxue.

Before he had the ability to protect himself, he did not dare to place his hopes on Song Wei and Ling Qingxue’s safety. No matter how solid the foundation of their cooperation was, Xia ruofei still had to be careful of that just in case. Hence, during this period of time, he had been trying his best to keep Song Wei and Ling Qingxue by his side.

The rest of the people who did not go to the United States continued to stay in Xia ruofei’s courtyard.

Xia ruofei also ordered Wu Qiang to entertain the guests.

The next day, Xia ruofei and the others boarded the black – armored flying boat that was suspended in the middle of the courtyard house and flew quickly in the direction of the United States.

It would take at least ten hours to get to San Francisco by Civil Air, even if it was a direct flight.

By contrast, the time taken by airboat would be greatly reduced. Because airboat didn’t need to make detours according to the fixed routes; instead, it was basically a direct flight. Additionally, the speed of airboat was much faster than the cruising speed of civil aircraft. The difference in speed might not be obvious in short – distance travel; however, it would be obvious in long distance travel.

Xia ruofei maneuvered the black Phoenix flying ship at full speed. In just two to three hours, the black Phoenix flying ship had arrived at Silicon Valley in San Francisco.

Xia ruofei followed the address provided by Li Yifu and landed the airboat near the Hilton Hotel where he was staying. Then, he walked towards the hotel with Chen Xuan and the others.

Xia ruofei and the others had changed their looks to a certain extent.

Xia ruofei still took on Xia Tian’s appearance. In fact, he had used Xia Tian’s appearance when he first walked in the world of cultivation. However, his secular identity had been exposed this time, and everyone had gotten used to his original appearance.

As for the others, although they did not have the secret technique to change their appearance as they pleased like Xia ruofei, it was still easy for them to change their appearance with makeup.

After all, none of them had gone through any customs procedures, especially for people like Song Wei and Ling Qingxue who were still living in the secular world. If they didn’t change their appearance, it would be troublesome if they were discovered in United States without any Customs Records.

Li Yifu was already waiting in the hotel lobby.

Li Yifu was already very familiar with Xia Tian’s image. Moreover, he was very familiar with Xia ruofei’s aura. Hence, when Xia ruofei and the others appeared at the entrance of the hotel, Li Yifu immediately stood up and went to greet them.

“Senior granduncle!” Li Yifu bowed slightly.

Chen Xuan and Yu Xin ‘er were both shocked that this old man would address Xia ruofei as Grand – martial uncle.

Chen Xuan had met Li Yifu at the auction previously, so he still had some impression of him.

At that time, everyone had many speculations about Xia ruofei’s identity. Now, they were more inclined to believe that Xia ruofei’s master was the primordial soul Stage elder of the star Seizer sect, Daoist Chi Yun. With Chi Yun’s seniority, it was normal for Xia ruofei to have a Grand – disciple like Li Yifu.

“Is the room ready?” Xia ruofei nodded and asked.

“Yes! I’ve booked three luxury suites as per your instructions. ” Li Yifu said.

“Alright, we’ll talk about it in the room!” Xia ruofei said.

Naturally, one could not use Xia ruofei’s and the others ‘passports to book a room in Hilton Hotel. Li Yifu had already booked a room in advance using someone else’s identity. For a local like him, it was not difficult at all.

Xia ruofei and the rest followed Li Yifu to the elevator and arrived at the 19th floor. Li Yifu took out three room cards and handed them to Xia ruofei, Chen Xuan, and Yu xiner.

Then, he opened his mouth and said,”martial granduncle, two seniors, these three suites are all on the same floor. One on the east side and two on the west side. The formalities have been completed. You can just press the room key and move in.”

There was a long corridor between the East and the West. A single room was naturally quieter. This was the room that Li Yifu had left for Xia ruofei.

The young Yu xiner blushed when she was called a senior.

Most importantly, her cultivation level was not much higher than Li Yifu ‘s.

Therefore, Yu xiner quickly waved her hand and said,””I’m not a senior, you can just call me xiner!”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”I see that the seniority in the cultivation world is very messy. It’s better for us to discuss our own matters!”

Otherwise, Li Yifu’s seniority would be too low.

Xia ruofei continued,”everyone, come to my room and have a seat!” Everyone, let’s discuss what to do next. ”

Everyone went to the luxurious suite at the East End of the corridor and sat down in the small living room.

Li Yifu was busy making tea for everyone but was stopped by Xia ruofei. He said,””Foster husband, don’t be busy, no one is thirsty! You should tell me the situation first!”

Li Yifu then sat down on the sofa opposite Xia ruofei. He looked ashamed and said,””Martial granduncle, this disciple is truly incompetent! You can’t even handle such a small matter, and even have to trouble martial granduncle to personally take action!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”this is not a small matter. It’s normal for Elon Musk to have some concerns. Tell me about the situation first!”

“Yes! Senior granduncle!”

Then, Li Yifu told Xia ruofei about the meeting yesterday in detail. In the end, he said,””Senior granduncle, Elon Musk still has a lot of concerns. I’m afraid that it’s impossible to facilitate this deal through normal business negotiations.”

After Yu Xin ‘er heard this, she asked in confusion,””Brother Xia, if that’s the case, why don’t we just go to the factory to retrieve the spacesuits and leave?”

It was only relative that the cultivation world did not interfere with worldly affairs.

If an ordinary person had the most valuable treasure in the world of cultivation, cultivators would naturally try to snatch it just because he was an ordinary person.

At the same time, moon exploration was the top priority. The spacesuits had become the key equipment. Under such circumstances, it was normal to use the means of cultivators to obtain spacesuits. It would not be criticized at all.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”miss Xin ‘er, you don’t know.” The cost of an extra – terrestrial spacesuit is extremely high, and it’s customized according to the actual body size of the astronaut, so it’s basically impossible to have any in stock. The most convenient channel for us is to customize it through SpaceX. “
