Chapter 438: Past deeds (2)

“Secretary Tian,” Xia ruofei said cautiously,”song Rui and I hit it off pretty well. We can be considered good friends!”

“Yes.” Tian Huilan nodded and said,”su Mei and I ... Oh, song Rui’s mother. We were University classmates and very good friends ...”

It turned out that Mrs. Song’s original name was Wang sumei. She was Tian Huilan’s best friend in the same dormitory for four years. Even song Rui’s father, song Zhengping, was in the same university as Tian Huilan. However, he was two years older than Tian Huilan and Wang sumei and could be considered their senior.

In fact, Wang sumei’s family was also quite well – off. Although it was not as prominent as the song family, her father was also the founding general and was also an old subordinate of elder song. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Song Zhengping and Wang sumei’s marriage was also arranged through marriage. The difference was that the two were truly in love. They had started dating in University, which was rare among the children of aristocratic families.

It was also because of his relationship with Wang sumei that song Zhengping and Tian Huilan were more familiar with each other in University.

Tian Huilan had met Lu You’s father, who was studying at the University of Political Science and Law, during their university days. Back then, the four young people often played and ate together, and they had a good relationship with each other.

After graduating from university, Tian Huilan followed Lu You’s father to the southeast province to work. Wang sumei and song Zhengping, like most of the children of aristocratic families, started their careers in the capital.

However, they had always kept in touch through letters, and their friendship during college had not weakened because of the geographical barrier.

Everyone even half – jokingly agreed that if their children were two boys in the future, they would become brothers of the opposite sex, two girls would become sisters, and if a boy and a girl were born, they would become husband and wife.

This was the legendary pre – Pregnancy marriage. Of course, at that time, Tian Huilan and Wang sumei weren’t even pregnant.

Later on, Tian Huilan and Wang sumei got pregnant and gave birth one after another. It was really a boy and a girl. The boy was song Rui, and the girl was Lu You.

Of course, it wasn’t as convenient for them to contact each other back then, and they didn’t have many chances to meet. Hence, Lu You and song Rui didn’t have much interaction with each other.

A few years later, Lu You’s father, who was already a police officer, was shot in the head during a mission and died on the spot, leaving Tian Huilan and her mother behind.

After song Zhengping and Wang sumei found out about the situation, they even took leave to visit Tian Huilan in Sanshan city.

From then on, song Zhengping and Wang sumei also took care of Tian Huilan.

The song family’s influence spread all over the country, and the southeast province had always been within the song family’s traditional sphere of influence. With the song family’s care, in addition to Tian Huilan’s natural talent in politics, her political acuity seemed to be innate. Thus, she had triumphantly advanced in her official career, like a fish in water, and slowly climbed up to the position of a vice – provincial leader.

Although Tian Huilan had been branded by the song family, at her level, her influence was already very strong. It could be said that even if she was a member of the song family, she was still one of the top few important figures in the song family. She had the ability to give the song family strong support in many ways.

Song Rui and Lu You were already in their twenties. A joke from back then had now become an important link between the song family and Tian Huilan, strengthening their close and cooperative relationship. This time, when Wang sumei came to visit elder song, the marriage between the two families was naturally put on the agenda.

Xia ruofei naturally didn’t know about the twenty to thirty years of history between Tian Huilan and the song family. When Tian Huilan mentioned that she and Wang sumei were best friends during University, Xia ruofei just listened quietly because he knew that Tian Huilan would continue.

As expected, Tian Huilan continued,””This time, sumei came to three mountains to visit elder song and fulfill her filial duty on behalf of provincial head song. On the other hand, she came to discuss the marriage of the two children with me ...”

Xia ruofei had already known about this, but he could only pretend that he had just heard the news. He looked surprised and said,””Marriage? Secretary Tian, Lu You hasn’t even graduated from University, right? Isn’t it too early to discuss this?”

“Actually, before the two children were born, our two families had an agreement to marry in the future ...” Tian Huilan said.

Xia ruofei really didn’t know about this. He couldn’t help but criticize in his heart,”What era was this, there was still this preconception of pre – Pregnancy marriage ...

“Oh, I see ...” Xia ruofei said.

He didn’t know why Tian Huilan was telling him this, so he could only feign civility.

Tian Huilan continued,”ruofei, Youyou seems to be a little resistant to this matter. You’re on good terms with Xiao Rui and you’ve saved Youyou this time. So, I’d like to ask you to help set them up so that Xiao Rui can take the initiative. You can also help me persuade Youyou and try to get in touch with Xiao Rui ...”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but smile bitterly. So Tian Huilan had been talking for so long to get him to help song Rui and Lu You build bridges!

He said in his heart,’if Secretary Tian knows that I gave song Rui the idea and caused him to have a showdown with Lu You, and now that the two of them have formed an alliance, I wonder if he will have the urge to kill me ...’

Xia ruofei thought for a moment and said cautiously,””Secretary Tian, I won’t hide it from you. Actually, song Rui told me about the marriage. However, I didn’t know that the fiancée his family arranged for him was Lu You ...”
