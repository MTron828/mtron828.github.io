Translator: 549690339

No one thought that there was anything wrong with this. The weight of a dozen grams was actually a dividing line. Two – headed abalone and one – headed abalone were completely different in meaning and their preciousness could not be compared.

1.55 million Hong Kong dollars!” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

1.58 million Hong Kong dollars!”

“1.61 million!”

......

As soon as Lu zhongguang’s voice fell, people started to bid.

The auction of the Super – Large two – headed abalone had stirred up everyone’s mood. There were many owners of seafood stores in the normal area. They had been waiting and watching, but now they were full of hope that they could bid for a one – headed abalone as the treasure of their store.

There were also many old customers from well – to – do families who drooled at the sight of the one – headed abalone on the stage and placed their bids one after another.

The abalones that were to be auctioned later on would be more and more valuable, and the prices would definitely be more and more expensive. Therefore, many people wanted to take advantage of the opportunity now to fight for it. After all, the rich people in the VIP area had not participated in the large – scale competition yet.

When the 630 – gram and even 650 – gram abalones started to be auctioned, it was obvious that it would be a wealth game for the rich people in the VIP area. It had nothing to do with them.

As such, everyone’s enthusiasm for the one – headed abalone did not diminish at all. In fact, it was even more intense than the bidding for the Super large two – headed abalone.

In a short while, everyone’s bid had exceeded two million Hong Kong dollars, and the price was still rising rapidly.

“2.3 million Hong Kong dollars!”

“2.33 million!”

“2.4 million Hong Kong dollars!”

......

In the end, the one – headed abalone was sold at a high price of 2.83 million Hong Kong dollars. The successful bidder was still the owner of a seafood company in the normal District. When the hammer finally fell, the owner heaved a long sigh of relief.

The momentum of the price increase was somewhat unexpected to him. Fortunately, he had been gritting his teeth and bidding, and he did not hesitate to increase the price, showing his determination to win.

Of course, the key was that the rich in the VIP area had not bid much. Even if there were bids, they did not fight to the death. They often shrugged and gave up after one or two rounds.

That was why he managed to get a one – headed abalone without any danger.

This time, he had the shop’s treasure! The boss said happily in his heart as he cupped his hands to express his gratitude to the people who congratulated him.

The auction had just begun, but the Paradise Corporation had already earned 8.45 million Hong Kong dollars. There were still 17 top – grade one – headed abalones waiting to be auctioned off. It was easy to imagine that the subsequent prices would definitely not be lower than the bid price of the first one – headed abalone.

This mainland company was going to earn tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of Hong Kong dollars in this auction! Many people did some mental calculations and couldn’t help but exclaim.

Many people turned to look at Feng Jing with envious eyes, and many media reporters also aimed their cameras at this Beautiful CEO.

The auction had only just started, but it was already a success. Feng Jing would definitely be the focus of all the media in Hong Kong the next day.

However, no one knew that the boss of the Paradise Corporation, who had really made a lot of money, was sitting in the audience happily. Xia ruofei was also counting how much money he could make this time!

The auction was still going on. There was almost no rest in the middle. The hostess brought out the second one – headed abalone and showed it around the stage before placing it on the display stand in the center of the stage.

“Next, we’ll start the auction for the second one – headed abalone. This abalone weighs 615.4 grams. The starting price is still 1.5 million Hong Kong dollars, and each bid must be at least 30000 Hong Kong dollars higher!” Lu zhongguang said with a smile. His voice was already a little hoarse.”Everyone, please make your bids!”
