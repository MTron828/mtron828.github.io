2311 Taking medicine for treatment_Fang Liyun smiled and nodded.”I see that Qiming’s condition is quite stable. Ruofei, you don’t have to rush back. Go home, take a shower, change your clothes, and rest. You’re already so tired from yesterday!”

Before Xia ruofei could say anything, Song Wei reacted and asked excitedly,””Ruofei, have you found the direction of treatment?”

Fang Liyun finally came back to her senses and looked at Xia ruofei expectantly.

Xia ruofei smiled.”Last night, I did a further diagnosis for uncle song. I’ve basically figured out the general treatment direction. The medicinal herbs I’m going to buy later are for the next stage of treatment.” Since Auntie Fang has said so, I’ll go home after buying the herbs and bring the medicine here after I’m done. ”

In fact, Xia ruofei said this mainly to deceive people. He couldn’t just make a bowl of pregnancy soup out of thin air in the hospital! At the same time, Fang Liyun asked him to go home, so he decided to go along with her. Going home was not the most important thing. The most important thing was to say hello to Ling Qingxue.

This time, he had come back in such a hurry. The moment the plane landed, he rushed to the hospital without stopping, followed by the urgent treatment. He didn’t even have the time to tell Ling Qingxue.

Fang Liyun smiled.”That’s good too. RUO Fei, you should go back and rest. I’ll get Wei Wei to call you if anything happens here.”

Song Wei nodded and said,”don’t worry and go back!” I’ll look after father. ”

Hence, Xia ruofei chatted with Fang Liyun and her daughter for a while to make them feel more at ease. He then sent them to the intensive care unit before leaving the General Hospital.

Xia ruofei gave Ling Qingxue a call the moment he left the hospital.

In the beginning, Ling Qingxue had teased him for being too happy in Beijing, especially since Song Wei was also in Beijing. Given the delicate relationship between the three of them, Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but think too much about it, even though she didn’t say it.

When Xia ruofei told her that song Qiming had gotten into a serious car accident and that he had rushed back yesterday, Ling Qingxue was shocked. She did not even think much about Song Wei and Xia ruofei returning to the three mountains at the same time. She immediately asked about song Qiming’s situation.

Xia ruofei briefly explained to Ling Qingxue and said,””Qingxue, with uncle song’s current condition, I might have to spend most of my time in the hospital. That’s why I’m telling you. Although I’ve returned to San Shan ...”

“Ruofei, say no more!” Ling Qingxue said directly,”I’m not an unreasonable person. Besides, I’m already an adult. Do I still need you to accompany me every day? As for Weiwei ... I’m worried about her, so you have to spend more time with her and comfort her. She must be at her weakest right now!”

Xia ruofei was touched and said,””I will,”

“By the way, should I come to the hospital to visit uncle song?” Ling Qingxue asked.

Xia ruofei wanted to decline, but he changed his mind and said,””It depends on your time. I don’t need any help here, but you can come and take a look if you want. ”

“I know.” Ling Qingxue said,”then I’ll arrange it myself! Just focus on treating uncle song and don’t worry about anything else. ”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said,”I’ll hang up now!”

“Bye!” Ling Qingxue said, then added, ” you have to rest well too! ”

“Come if you know! It’s still my wife who cares about me!” Xia ruofei chuckled.

“Virtue!” Ling Qingxue pouted and hung up the phone.

After Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue ended the call, he stopped a taxi at the entrance of the hospital and returned to the jiangbin villa district.

If it was just a cover-up, Xia ruofei didn’t need to come back. He could just find a place with no one around to take out the spirit nourishing soup that Xia Qing had prepared and then return to the hospital.

However, Fang Liyun did remind Xia ruofei that he had not taken a bath for a whole day. Furthermore, he had been on a long flight since yesterday and was extremely nervous in the hospital. His body was almost rotten. Therefore, he simply followed her advice and prepared to go home.

Xia ruofei returned home. Although he had not been home for a few days, the house was clean and the furniture was spotless.

He couldn’t help but feel a warmth in his heart. He knew that Ling Qingxue must have arranged for someone to come and clean it. She might even have cleaned it herself.

Ever since the relationship between the three of them was made clear, Ling Qingxue’s attitude towards him was obviously not as close as before. There was a faint sense of distance. Although it might be because of her promise with Song Wei, Xia ruofei knew that The Grudge in Ling Qingxue’s heart would not be completely eliminated in a short time.

When he entered the house and saw that Ling Qingxue had taken care of it in an orderly manner, Xia ruofei knew that she still cared about him.

Xia ruofei went upstairs to his master bedroom, took a shower, and changed into a set of clean clothes. He felt much more refreshed.

He was not in a hurry to get back to the hospital, so he simply threw the clothes he had changed out of into the washing machine. While he was washing the clothes, he sat on the deck chair on the balcony and rested for a while.

Xia ruofei’s nerves had been tense from yesterday until now. Now, he could finally relax a little.

After Xia ruofei hung up the clothes, he took out the spirit nourishment soup that Xia Qing had prepared from his space. He went to the kitchen on the first floor and heated it up in the microwave before pouring it into the thermos.

Half an hour later, Xia ruofei drove the Knight XV back to the military general Hospital.

After he parked the car, he went straight to the hospital building with the thermos and took the elevator to the intensive care unit area.

As soon as they stepped out of the elevator, Xia ruofei was surprised to see Ling Qingxue there. She was talking to Fang Liyun and Song Wei. Even though Ling Qingxue’s back was facing him, he could still recognize her tall and sexy back with a single glance.

“Qingxue!” Xia ruofei called out.

Ling Qingxue turned around and smiled sweetly at Xia ruofei. ” “You’re back! I was just talking about you with Auntie and Wei Wei!” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

As Ling Qingxue spoke, she walked over and held Xia ruofei’s arm. Fang Liyun knew that Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue were a couple, and Ling Qingxue was here as Song Wei’s good friend.

Fang Liyun chimed in,” ruofei, why did you tell Qingxue? ” She’s so busy with work, it’s so troublesome for her to make a special trip!”

Ling Qingxue smiled. ” Aunty, you’re being too polite. Weiwei and I are best friends. Uncle song is injured. As a junior, I should come and visit. ”

In fact, the news of song Qiming’s car accident was strictly blocked. Not many people in the municipal Party Committee knew about this situation. The Provincial Party Committee had also issued the strictest gag order. Otherwise, there would have been a long line of people who would have come to visit.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,” aunty, I’ve suddenly returned from the capital. I have to report this to my wife!” When Qingxue heard about uncle song’s matter, she said that she wanted to come and take a look. I couldn’t stop her, right? ”

“You guys ...” Fang Liyun shook her head with a bitter smile.

Song Wei was envious when she saw Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue standing together. She couldn’t help but think about her future with Xia ruofei.

She sighed in her heart,”I don’t know when I’ll be able to hold hands with RUO Fei in front of my parents ...”

Xia ruofei was a very attentive person. He had been secretly paying attention to Song Wei and could feel that she was a little down. He said,”Oh right, aunt Fang, I’ve already prepared the Chinese medicine. Let’s not waste any time, I’ll go in first!”

“Good! Good!” Fang Liyun hurriedly said,”ruofei, please take care of me!”

“Don’t worry!” Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand.”You guys can wait outside for news!”

After that, Xia ruofei went over and rang the doorbell. Soon, they were in the intensive care unit.

When the doctor on duty saw Xia ruofei coming in with a thermos, he thought that Xia ruofei had brought the water for him to drink. Although they were not allowed to enter the intensive care unit according to the rules, Xia ruofei was given special permission by the leader. Hence, she did not ask much. After seeing Xia ruofei disinfect himself and put on a sterile Isolation Suit, she turned around and went back to the doctor’s office.

Xia ruofei knew that the entire intensive care unit area was filled with surveillance cameras. Hence, after he entered song Qiming’s ward, he waved his hand and scattered a few pieces of jade that he had used the day before, forming a simple interference array.

The reason was simple. With song Qiming’s current condition, he shouldn’t be able to eat anything, not even liquid food or water. His swallowing reflex had disappeared, and he couldn’t swallow it unconsciously. He could easily suffocate.

Of course, Xia ruofei had a way to feed her the soup, but he didn’t want the scene of him feeding the medicine to be recorded. It was hard to explain how a patient who didn’t have the reflex to swallow could take liquid Chinese medicine in a coma. It was against the common sense of Medicine and Science.

After setting up the formation, Xia ruofei opened the thermal flask and poured the soup into the cups.

Xia ruofei had noticed yesterday that although song Qiming was on a ventilator, he was using a nasal tube. Although he could not eat in this situation, Xia ruofei only needed song Qiming’s mouth to open normally.

He walked forward and carefully avoided the tube. He gently pinched song Qiming’s jaw to make his mouth open slightly. Then, he picked up the cup of spirit nourishment soup on the bedside table with his other hand and poured it into song Qiming’s mouth.

In fact, when the soup left the cup, it was already bound by Xia ruofei’s spiritual power. It was condensed into a line and entered song Qiming’s mouth.

Then, Xia ruofei used his spiritual power to feed the soup to song Qiming’s stomach.

Now that Xia ruofei’s spiritual power had improved greatly, it was a piece of cake for him to complete this operation.

Then, Xia ruofei injected a small wisp of warm genuine Qi into song Qiming’s body to help him absorb the herbal Essence of the pregnancy soup as soon as possible.

Xia ruofei sat quietly by the bed and waited for a while. He felt that a portion of the medicine should have been absorbed. He grabbed song Qiming’s wrist and a vast amount of spiritual energy poured into his meridians, heading straight for his sea of consciousness ...
