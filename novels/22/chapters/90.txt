Chapter 91: Xingxing’s child (1)

Xia ruofei was even more confused and said,””Who else could it be? I’m here to see professor Tian ...” Then, Xia ruofei also came to his senses. He smiled and said, “You’re waiting for someone, right?” Lu You’s mouth twitched and she rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei.”What does it have to do with you?” Xia ruofei thought to himself,”this girl is really hot – tempered!” But I don’t think I’ve provoked her, so why does she look so bitter and hateful when she sees me? At this moment, professor Tian’s voice could be heard from inside,””Is it little Xia? Come in quickly! Youyou, what are you doing at the door? Quickly let little Xia in!” Lu You snorted softly and stepped aside unwillingly. Naturally, Xia ruofei would not argue with a little girl. He gave her a friendly smile, reached out for the vegetable basket, and walked into the courtyard. The White – haired and spirited professor Tian smiled as he came out and said,” “Little Xia, why did you bring so many things again? Didn’t I tell you not to take anything from here the last time?” “The vegetables we grow and the fish we rear are not worth much.” Xia ruofei smiled and asked anxiously,”professor Tian, how’s your health recently?” “Very good!” Professor Tian said happily,”after drinking the Chinese medicine you gave me, some of my minor illnesses have disappeared. I feel like I’m ten years younger!” Xia ruofei saw that professor Tian was indeed in a good mental state. His face was glowing and he walked with a gust of wind. It did not look like he had just walked past the gates of hell not long ago. He was happy for him. Professor Tian pulled Xia ruofei to sit at the antique tea table in the corner of the living room. He took out his precious tea leaves and made a kungfu tea for her. As he poured the tea leaves into the purple clay teapot, he said with a smile,””Little Xia, stay for lunch today! My younger daughter and son – in – Law just came back from Hong Kong! In a while, Huilan will be coming over after work!” Xia ruofei glanced at Lu You, who was huddling on the sofa in the living room and switching channels with the remote control in boredom. He roughly knew who she was waiting for. “Professor Tian, I won’t disturb your family’s reunion ...” Xia ruofei said. “What are you saying!” Professor Tian pretended to be angry and said,”you came to visit me. How can I let you go without a meal? Besides, my younger daughter also knows about what happened last time. She kept saying that she wanted to thank you in person!” Hearing this, Xia ruofei could only agree with a bitter smile. Professor Tian was in a good mood today, probably because he had not seen his younger daughter for a long time. He was making tea and talking about his younger daughter with Xia ruofei. Professor Tian’s youngest daughter, Tian Huixin, was 35 years old. Her husband, Ma Zhiming, was the only son of Hong Kong’s richest man, MA Xiong. Tian Huixin could be considered to have married into a rich family. However, she and Ma Zhiming were classmates when they were studying in the United States. The two fell in love and got married in the United States. MA Xiong was getting on in his years. Ma Zhiming had inherited his father’s business and was gradually taking control of the family business. Tian Huixin, on the other hand, had not gone out to work since she got pregnant. She had been living a life of supporting her husband and raising her child in Hong Kong all these years. The two of them chatted for a while before the doorbell rang again. Lu You cheered and jumped up from the sofa. She jogged out to open the door. Immediately after, Xia ruofei heard Lu You’s surprised voice.” “Little aunt! Little uncle! You guys are here ... Huanhuan! Big sister missed you so much! Come, let big sister hug you ...” Xia ruofei and professor Tian also stood up and walked out. Before they reached the door, Lu You and the rest had already entered. A charming young woman was walking in front with a cute little girl who was about four or five years old in her arms. Behind her was a well – dressed middle – aged man who was about thirty – six or thirty – seven years old. When the two of them saw professor Tian, they shouted in unison,””Dad!” Professor Tian was also a little excited. He nodded and said,”Zhiming, Huixin, hurry up and go inside. The journey must have been tough, right?” “Fortunately, Hong Kong is not far from here.” Ma Zhiming replied with a respectful expression. Professor Tian then turned his gaze to the little girl in Tian Huixin’s arms. With a loving expression, he said,””Huanhuan!” Tian Huixin gently patted Huan Huan and said,””Call me Grandpa happily!” Huan Huan did not react. She did not even look at professor Tian. Her eyes were dull and listless as she stared at a small top in her hand. “Still no improvement?” professor Tian’s expression darkened. “Um ...” Tian Huixin’s eyes reddened. Ma Zhiming saw that the atmosphere was a little heavy and wanted to change the topic. At this moment, he saw Xia ruofei standing beside professor Tian and quickly asked,””Dad, this is ...” “Oh!” Professor Tian laughed. I forgot to introduce you. Zhiming, Huixin, this is the person who saved my life, little Xia. Xiao Xia, this is my daughter Tian Huixin and son – in – Law Ma Zhiming. ” “So you’re Xia Sheng!” Ma Zhiming’s attitude became more enthusiastic. He spoke in Mandarin with a strong Hong Kong accent,”I heard about what happened last time. Thank you so much!” Tian Huixin also showed a grateful expression and said,””Thank you, Xia!” Xia ruofei smiled.”Mr. MA, Ms. Tian, you don’t have to thank me. I’ve told professor Tian and Mayor Tian before. It’s really nothing.” At this time, professor Tian said,”come in and sit!” Don’t stand there and chat ...” The group of people arrived at the living room and took their seats. Huan Huan also got down from Tian Huixin’s arms. She tiptoed to the corner of the living room and fiddled with the top. Every time the top started to spin, she would be very focused and stare at it without blinking. Lu You ran over and wanted to play with her, but no matter what she said, Huanhuan did not even look at Lu You. Xia ruofei also realized that there was something wrong with this little girl. She had not said a word since she entered the room and did not respond to any external stimuli. However, this should be Ma Zhiming and his wife’s privacy, so Xia ruofei did not ask. He could see the deep worry in Ma Zhiming and Tian Huixin’s eyes, and he knew that Huanhuan’s problem was not small. Otherwise, with Ma Zhiming’s financial resources, how could he not even be able to solve the problem of his precious daughter? After the spinning top stopped, Huan Huan picked it up clumsily and tried to spin it again. However, she failed after several attempts. “Huanhuan, I’ll help you!” Lu You said. After saying that, he took the spinning top from Huanhuan’s hand. Before Lu You could spin the top, Huan Huan’s head hit Lu You’s stomach without any warning. Lu You was caught off guard and fell on her butt on the floor. She grimaced in pain. Then, Huanhuan let out a hysterical scream. Tian Huixin quickly ran over and comforted Huanhuan in her arms. Professor Tian went over and helped Lu You up. Even in her mother’s arms, Huanhuan was still screaming loudly. It took a long time before she gradually calmed down. “Mr. Xia, I’m sorry to have embarrassed you ...” Ma Zhiming sighed. When Xia ruofei saw the tears in Tian Huixin’s eyes, he couldn’t help but feel sorry for her. He couldn’t help but ask,””Mr. MA, if I may ask, Huanhuan ...” Ma Zhiming glanced at his wife and daughter who were not far away and said with a sad face, “To be honest, Huanhuan is ... Xingxing’s child ...” [PS] I’ll continue to ask for Sanjiang tickets. Qidian’s readers can get one ticket every day. It’s free and is on the old website, Sanjiang channel.
