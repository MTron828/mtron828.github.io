Chapter 118: The brain is a good thing (1)

This middle – aged lady was called Ma Jia, and she was the daughter of Ma Zhiming’s uncle. She was also working at Hengfeng group, and her position in the group was second only to Ma Zhiming. Ma Zhiming slightly frowned and said,”Sister Quan, this is Xia Sheng, an expert I invited from the mainland.” “An expert?” Ma su raised his head slightly and glanced at Xia ruofei. He sneered.”Could it be that this little brat knows sorcery? This is the first time I’ve seen such a young mage!” “Sister Quan, don’t talk nonsense!” Ma Zhiming quickly said,”Xia Sheng is a brilliant Chinese medicine doctor!” “He’s such a young Chinese medicine doctor!” Ma Jia cried out exaggeratedly,”Ming, you’re not being tricked, are you? We understand that you’re concerned about second uncle’s illness, but you can’t be so ridiculous! What kind of medical skills can a young child know?” Ma Jia had been speaking to Ma Zhiming in broken Mandarin. It was obvious that she had deliberately said it for Xia ruofei to hear. After she finished speaking, she glanced at Xia ruofei and said loudly on purpose,”Ming, there are too many scammers in the mainland, you have to be careful! There are some scammers who specifically target rich people like you!” Tian Huixin couldn’t help but frown when she heard this. Ma Jia’s words were really too harsh. Ma Jia then pretended to misspeak and covered her mouth, saying,””Sister – in – Law, don’t misunderstand. I’m not talking about you!” Tian Huixin was from the mainland, so Ma Jia obviously had a hidden meaning in her words and deliberately said it for Tian Huixin. Tian Huixin looked at Xia ruofei, who was beside her. Seeing that he was still calm and collected, she felt a little more at ease. Then, she frowned and said,”sister Quan, Xiao Xia is my father’s good friend. She is also an important guest that Zhiming and I have invited. Please be more polite.” Ma Jia’s eyes widened exaggeratedly and said,””Sister – in – Law, I’m doing this for you, Zhiming, and Hengfeng! What if Ming – Zai gets too worried and gets cheated of a large sum of money to treat second uncle’s illness? that would be Hengfeng’s loss!” Hengfeng was founded by MA Xiong. Although he had distributed a small number of shares to the younger generation of the family, the majority of the shares were controlled by him and Ma Zhiming. And Ma Jia’s words made it sound like she was the master of Hengfeng. Ma Zhiming suppressed the dissatisfaction in his heart and said,”Sister Quan, don’t say anymore! My dad’s condition is so critical that every minute is dangerous! I’m going to ask Mr. Xia to treat dad immediately. It’s settled. ” After he finished speaking, Ma Zhiming saw that Ma Jia was still preparing to speak, so he directly added another sentence,”The one lying in the ward is my father! I’ll be responsible for any problems that arise!” Then, Ma Zhiming looked at Xia ruofei sincerely and said,””Xia Sheng, sorry to trouble you ...” Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. Director Qin of Hengfeng hospital quickly led the way and was ready to take Xia ruofei to the Chinese medicine room. When Xia ruofei passed by Ma Jia, a playful smile appeared on his face. He stopped and looked at her,””Big sister, let me give you a sentence: The brain is a good thing ...” Ma Jia was somewhat baffled by these nonsensical words and asked impatiently,””What did you say?” Xia ruofei smiled and said,””A brain is a good thing, I hope you have one too ...” Then, Xia ruofei followed Dean Qin. Ma su was stunned for a moment, but when he came back to his senses, he was furious and screamed,””Damn you! You dare to say I’m brainless?” Xia ruofei stopped in his tracks and turned around to look at Ma Jia coldly. His bone – chilling gaze caused ma SU’s heart to turn cold. Xia ruofei’s cold killing intent disappeared as soon as it was released. Then, he said indifferently,””The patient is Mr. Ma’s father, and I’m the Doctor that Mr. MA invited. Do you think anyone with a brain would jump out and talk big at this time?” He paused for a moment, and before Ma Jia could say anything, he continued,””Also, you’d better put away your inexplicable sense of superiority, especially your mouth full of vulgarities. That will only expose your lack of manners!” With that, Xia ruofei left quickly without looking back. Ma Jia was so angry that her whole body trembled. She asked loudly behind her,”If you can’t cure second uncle’s illness, what will you say?” Xia ruofei turned around again and laughed,”what a joke!” When did I promise that I could cure it? Hengfeng hospital had so many brain experts and first – Class medical facilities in Asia, but they were all helpless. Why do I have to be cured? Even Mr. MA didn’t say anything, what right do you have to point fingers!” After that, Xia ruofei ignored the unreasonable woman and quickly followed Dean Qin, disappearing around the corner. Ma Zhiming frowned slightly and looked at Ma Jia thoughtfully. He didn’t pay attention to her, but took his wife and daughter to the long bench next to him and sat down. He had placed all his hopes on Xia ruofei. All he could do now was wait. Since Ma Zhiming valued Xia ruofei so much, Dean Qin naturally did not dare to neglect him. He respectfully led Xia ruofei to the elevator and to the Chinese medicine room on the first floor. Then, he asked,””Mr. Xia, we’ve arrived at the Chinese medicine room. What can I do for you?” “Dean Qin, I’ll have to trouble you,” Xia ruofei said with a smile. Please ask the staff to leave. I can make the medicine myself. It won’t take up any of your time. ” “No problem, no problem.” Dean Qin quickly said. Dean Qin wouldn’t say anything even if he closed the Chinese medicine room for a whole day, let alone a few minutes! He followed Xia ruofei’s instructions and called for the staff to come out. Then, he respectfully invited Xia ruofei into the pharmacy. Xia ruofei walked in and took a look. Hengfeng hospital was indeed powerful. Rows of neat cabinets were filled with small drawers, and each drawer was labeled. It was a spectacular sight. Even the provincial Hospital of Chinese medicine might not be as big as this pharmacy. Xia ruofei had already checked and memorized a prescription for calming the mind and nourishing the brain. This prescription naturally couldn’t cure a cerebral hemorrhage, but taking it would definitely not be bad for the body. Xia ruofei didn’t take the herbs according to the prescription. Instead, he took more than 40 kinds of herbs. Besides the seven or eight herbs he needed, the rest were just for cover. The Qingqing pharmacy had surveillance cameras. Xia ruofei had always been cautious. Xia ruofei walked out of the pharmacy with a big tray of Chinese medicine. Dean Qin immediately came up to them, but he knew how to avoid suspicion, so he didn’t look at the herbs. “Mr. Xia, have you gathered all the medicinal herbs?” Dean Qin asked. “Mm! You have quite a wide range of medicinal herbs here. ” Xia ruofei smiled and continued to ask,”is there a place to boil medicine?” “Yes, yes, yes, it’s just next door. Please follow me!” Dean Qin quickly said. The room where the medicine was being brewed had already been cleared, so Dean Qin walked him to the door and stopped. Xia ruofei locked the door and checked that there were no surveillance cameras in the room. He was finally relieved. He skillfully found the herbs he needed from the tray and started to brew the medicinal soup. [PS] this book will be officially released tomorrow, and there will be a third update later.
