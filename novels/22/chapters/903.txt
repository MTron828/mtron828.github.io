Chapter 904: Chapter 572 – discerning Qiu Hao from miracle doctor Xia (2)

Translator: 549690339

As long as it involved their children, all parents in the world were equally nervous.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”Song Wei, my medicine can remove the toxins and also recuperate your body. So, after three courses of treatment, under normal circumstances, not only will the toxins be removed, but your chronic gastritis and mild menstrual pain should also be cured at the same time.”

Song Wei’s beautiful face showed a hint of shyness, followed by a look of surprise. She covered her mouth and said,”How did you know ...”

“Didn’t I take your pulse?” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Chinese medicine is profound. Sometimes, it’s even more accurate than Western medicine.”

If Xia ruofei had only pointed out that she had chronic gastritis, Song Wei might have thought that her parents had told him about it in advance. However, the pain during her period was not that obvious. She had not even mentioned it to her mother. Although the level of pain was within her tolerance range, it was still a little uncomfortable every time it hurt.

Fang Liyun’s mouth was wide open in shock. She looked at Song Wei with a questioning gaze.

Song Wei blushed and nodded.

Fang Liyun said happily,”ruofei, it seems like elder song’s eyes are really sharp!” Your medical skills are much better than those Chinese medical Masters. They didn’t even notice that Weiwei has chronic gastritis!”

As for the pain on her period, Fang Liyun naturally ignored it. After all, Guangzhi Cao and the driver old Zhang were in the room. Girls were shy, so how could she keep talking about it?

Xia ruofei smiled.”If it’s chronic gastritis, I don’t think those famous Chinese doctors can’t see it. It’s just that their attention is focused on the nameless poison. For a chronic disease that won’t immediately endanger your life, even if they find out, they won’t take it to heart.”

“That’s not the same. They say that Western medicine treats the head and the feet, but Chinese medicine considers the big picture.” Song Qiming said,”this means that your medical skills are better than theirs, ruofei!”

They had invited so many doctors, but none of them could see anything. On the other hand, Xia ruofei’s arrival had given them hope of a cure. Hence, song Qiming was angry when he thought of those famous doctors.

However, the reason why Xia ruofei could accurately judge Song Wei’s physical condition and detect the existence of the poison was all due to his spiritual power. If he only relied on checking her pulse, Xia ruofei’s current medical skills were not as good as those experienced Chinese medical doctors.

However, Xia ruofei’s spiritual power was like a magic weapon. It was like he had an external ability when it came to learning Chinese medicine. After all, no doctor had the unique conditions like Xia ruofei, who could “see” the internal meridians of the human body so clearly.

Given time, Xia ruofei’s Chinese medicine skills would definitely improve by leaps and bounds.

Xia ruofei’s casual display of his skills had boosted song Qiming’s family’s confidence.

“Liyun, can you go to the kitchen and see if little Luo has prepared lunch?” Song Qiming said.

“Alright, ruofei, have a seat and chat for a while! I’ll go check the kitchen. ” Fang Liyun said hurriedly.

“It’s been hard on you, Auntie. ” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Remember to take out my precious thirty – year – old bottle of Maotai. I want to have a few drinks with ruofei this afternoon!” Song Qiming added.

“I know! Just drink your tea!” Fang Liyun glanced at song Qiming and said.

Usually, she was quite strict with song Qiming’s drinking. However, she was in a good mood today, so she did not care much about song Qiming’s drinking. She even took the initiative to take out song Qiming’s long – cherished Maotai from the wine cabinet. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Song Qiming pushed back his work schedule for the afternoon and spent the afternoon drinking with Xia ruofei.

Even Guangzhi Cao and the driver, old Zhang, were ordered by song Qiming to sit down and drink.

In song Qiming’s words, there was no work arranged for the afternoon. One of them was a driver, and the other was a Secretary. They just had to drink a little and go back to rest.

Fang Liyun and Song Wei also toasted Xia ruofei several times with red wine.

Xia ruofei had a good tolerance for alcohol, so he naturally downed his drink. Song Qiming and the others all gave him a thumbs up.

The bottle of Maotai was finished very quickly. When song Qiming was about to open another ordinary bottle of Maotai, Xia ruofei smiled and said,””Uncle song, have a taste of our company’s Bar!”

“Do you have a winery under your company?” song Qiming was stunned.

“Secretary, RUO Fei is the major shareholder of Dingfeng winery in our city, which also produces the Drunken Eight Immortals wine,” Guangzhi Cao quickly interjected.

“Woof! The Eight Immortals of wine!” Song Qiming could not help but say in surprise,”this wine is very famous in the southeast province. So, ruofei, you’re the boss!”

Xia ruofei laughed.”It’s just a small business. How can it catch your eye, uncle song?”

“That’s a big business!”Song Qiming said with a smile. I’ve been doing some research these past few days, and the tables are basically filled with your Drunken Eight Immortals wine!”

After song Qiming took office, he began to do research in the various districts and counties of Sanshan city. Naturally, he would eat downstairs. Now, many places in the southeast province used Drunken Eight Immortals as their official reception wine.

This was because its price was much cheaper than the traditional famous Maotai Wuliangye, but the taste was quite good. Many old drinkers even thought that the taste of the Drunken Eight Immortals wine was not inferior to the Maotai Wuliangye at all.

At present, the standards of official reception were very strict, and the situation of eating and drinking was completely curbed. Under such circumstances, the cheap and good quality Drunken Eight Immortals wine was naturally very popular.

Song Qiming continued,”I’ve drunk your Drunken Eight Immortals in several districts. It’s really good. I’ll try it again today!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”uncle song, my Drunken Eight Immortals is different from the ones sold in the market!” You’ll know when you try it!”

Song Qiming’s eyes lit up.”That means ... It’s definitely better than the wine sold in bulk?” he asked.

Xia ruofei laughed.”Of course! Good wine should be left for me, the boss!”

“Ruofei, now that you’ve mentioned it, even I want to try it!” Song Wei pursed her lips and smiled.

“Yes, yes, yes. Let’s all drink a little. Let’s see if RUO Fei is bragging!” Fang Liyun chimed in.

Guangzhi Cao and Zhang, the pilot, did not dare to make such a joke. They just sat at the side and looked at Xia ruofei with envy.

Even old Zhang, who had been with song Qiming for many years, was envious that he could joke with the Secretary’s family so casually.

Xia ruofei stood up and said,”everyone, please wait!” I’ll go get some wine!”

After that, Xia ruofei walked out of the villa, went to his Mercedes – Benz, and opened the trunk.

After blocking everyone’s view with his body, Xia ruofei took out two small jars of Drunken Eight Immortals from the space. He had bought them from Ding Feng winery and added a small amount of spirit Heart Flower petals.

In terms of time, these wines were also longer than the five month Drunken Eight Immortals sold in the market. Furthermore, the petals of the spirit Heart Flower were added, so they were definitely the best health wine in the world.

Xia ruofei closed the trunk and carried two small jars of unlabeled Drunken Eight Immortals into the dining hall. Then, in front of everyone, he opened the clay seal on one jar.

Suddenly, an extremely rich and intoxicating wine fragrance filled the restaurant. Everyone could not help but sniffle. Song Qiming even revealed an intoxicated expression.

No one spoke for a while, clearly stunned by the wine’s aroma.

Song Qiming only came back to his senses after a long while. He quickly called out,””Ruofei, this wine is too fragrant. Quick, quick, let me try it.”

Guangzhi Cao quickly stood up and took the wine jar from Xia ruofei. He poured the wine into a small bottle of baijiu and then poured a glass for song Qiming.

He then poured a small glass for Fang Liyun and Song Wei.

Very quickly, everyone’s glasses were filled with Drunken Eight Immortals.

Song Qiming impatiently raised his glass and said,””Come, come, come, let’s have a go together!”
