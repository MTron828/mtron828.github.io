2421 Cultivator_Pingan County, Wanyuan District.

In the duplex apartment on the top floor, Liu haojun walked out of the bathroom in a bathrobe. He went to the balcony and lay down on the recliner, looking at the sparse lights outside the window in boredom.

The penthouse apartment in Wanyuan District was definitely one of the best luxury houses in the area. However, to Liu haojun, it was no different from a slum. He had lived in luxury since he was young, and he felt that Pingan County, or rather, the entire Shaanbei province, was simply a barren land. Everything here made him feel extremely irritated.

These two days, Liu haojun would feel his heart palpitate from time to time, and his entire state was inexplicably anxious.

Liu haojun had originally wanted to bring Liu Feng to Shaanbei province to relax. Of course, the main reason was that he wanted to take the opportunity to vent his anger.

Unfortunately, Liu Feng had politely rejected his invitation. He had no choice but to return to Pingan County. Although he was now far away from the core of the family, he was still under house arrest. If he dared to stay out in the Main City, someone would immediately report it to the family. By then, he would be in even more serious trouble.

Although he had been sent away, at least he had a good guarantee of living. His monthly pocket money was much higher than most people’s wages. Once his family cut off his financial source, Liu haojun’s situation would be even worse.

Liu haojun felt inexplicably irritated. He couldn’t help but take out a cigarette from his cigarette box and light it up.

He didn’t notice that a black shadow flashed past in the night. Without alerting anyone, it had already arrived at the downstairs of the apartment.

The black shadow did not go through the building’s door that was installed with a security guard. Instead, it went directly to the water pipe that was installed on the outer wall. After a short pause, it climbed up the water pipe. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Under the cover of the night, no one noticed this black shadow.

On the roof of the opposite building, a pair of bright eyes were staring at the black shadow. His eyes followed the black shadow as it climbed up.

The black shadow was like an agile monkey, using the air conditioner, the edge of the balcony, the drainage pipe, and all the other places that he could borrow strength from. He almost did not stop, and he kept jumping and climbing up at a very fast speed.

After a while, the black shadow had reached the top floor and grabbed the edge of the balcony with both hands.

He exerted strength in both his hands and waist at the same time, and his entire body flipped over, nimbly jumping onto the balcony.

Liu haojun was half – lying down and smoking. He was facing the balcony.

When the black shadow suddenly appeared in front of him, he was suddenly startled. He subconsciously sat up straight from the recliner and asked in a trembling voice,””Who is it?”

Liu haojun saw a man in a black shirt and pants stand up on the balcony and walk toward him.

The Man in Black was wearing a mask, and only his eyes and nostrils were exposed. It was impossible to tell what he looked like.

However, Liu haojun felt a sense of familiarity from this person’s figure, especially his eyes. Liu haojun felt that he had seen them before.

The Man in Black didn’t say anything. He just looked at Liu haojun with a complicated expression, and then shot toward Liu haojun in a flash.

Liu haojun was so scared that he rolled down from the reclining chair and staggered in the direction of the bedroom. He staggered to the drawer of the bedside table and put a pistol in it. It was a Browning pistol that he had gotten through special channels. It was a treasure collected by many gun lovers and could also be used for self – defense.

The public security in Pingan County was pretty good. Liu haojun also had bodyguards to protect him. However, the bodyguards lived in the apartment downstairs and would only follow him when he went out.

It was precisely because of the good security here and the fact that Liu haojun couldn’t go out and drink like he used to, that he naturally couldn’t carry a gun with him.

From the living room to the bedroom, they had to climb a flight of stairs.

Naturally, the Man in Black would not give Liu haojun that much time. In a flash, he sped up and caught up with Liu haojun at the stairs.

The Man in Black put one hand on Liu haojun’s shoulder and exerted a little force.

Liu haojun, whose body had been hollowed out by wine and women, suddenly felt an irresistible force, and he fell back involuntarily.

The Man in Black put his arm around Liu haojun’s shoulder and turned around at the same time. A cold light flashed between the fingers of his other hand as he quickly attacked Liu haojun’s chest.

The Man in Black’s palm had already touched Liu haojun’s chest. A blade had just avoided his ribs and directly pierced Liu haojun’s heart without any obstruction.

The Man in Black slashed again, and Liu haojun’s face froze in fear. His eyes were filled with disbelief.

At this time, the Man in Black moved closer to Liu haojun’s ear and said softly,””Haojun, don’t blame me ... I’m only following orders ...”

Liu haojun’s eyes suddenly widened, and he asked with difficulty,””Brother Feng, W – why?”

The Man in Black was obviously Liu Feng. He didn’t hide anything in front of Liu haojun, who was about to die. He only said with a trace of guilt,””I’m not sure ... But ... This is an order given by the higher – ups of the clan ... Haojun, you can rest in peace!”

After that, Liu Feng let go of Liu haojun gently.

At this moment, Liu haojun felt that all the strength in his body had been sucked out, and he fell to the ground softly.

Liu Feng’s blade was very sharp. At this time, the wound on Liu haojun’s chest opened up and blood began to flow out.
