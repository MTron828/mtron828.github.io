Chapter 1545: On – the – spot cutting (2)

Translator: 549690339

“Alright!” The master of cutting stones said with a smile.

The Masters who were invited by the organizer of the public bid were all very experienced. They had cut countless raw jades in their hands, so they were naturally familiar with the operation.

Although the stone – cutting equipment was provided by the organizer for free, the stone – cutting Masters were paid. Compared to the profit of selling raw jade, the labor cost was nothing.

In addition, once the price rose, the owner of the raw stone would definitely give a red packet to the master of cutting stones. So, at the annual public auction, countless Masters of cutting stones would fight to come here to work.

The cutting machine roared. The master’s hand was very steady. In the midst of the flying stone chips, he accurately cut the raw stone along the line that He Ping had drawn.

Without waiting for He Ping to say anything, the stonecutter brought over a wet cloth and wiped away the stone chips from the cut.

Everyone immediately saw a touch of green, and the surrounding people immediately began to discuss.

“It looks like it has increased!”

“This water source is pretty good!”

“Old Yu, what a good start!”

Yu mingdong’s face was also red, and he cupped his hands in thanks.

Xia ruofei took a closer look and realized that after the raw stone was cut in half, one side of the cut had a clear green color, while the other half had almost no green color.

It could be seen that He Ping’s line was quite accurate. Under the premise that he couldn’t detect the internal situation at all, he could do this to this extent purely based on experience. He did have some ability.

He Ping’s face also could not help but reveal a trace of pride.

After that, there was no need for He Ping’s guidance. The stone cutting master naturally knew what to do. Cut, rub, grind ... All kinds of different techniques took turns. In a short while, a piece of Jade the size of two fists was presented in front of everyone.

Yu mingdong took the Imperial Jade happily.

“President Yu, congratulations! This one should have increased by a lot, right?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

“The water head is not bad, but the quality is a little bad,” Yu mingdong said happily.”It’s a small profit ...”

At this moment, a jade stone boss who was familiar with Yu mingdong said,””Old Yu, this is a small profit! If I’m not wrong, you spent 800000 Yuan on this raw material! If you don’t like the material, you can transfer two million to me ...”

Yu mingdong held the Jade and said,””Old Zhu, you’re bullying me because I don’t know anything. This piece of material was worth at least 2.3 million! Besides, I’m short of materials in my own factory! How could they open it and sell it?”

Xia ruofei was speechless. No wonder so many people were interested in stone gambling. The value of the stone that was bought for 800000 Yuan had tripled in the blink of an eye!

And from Yu mingdong’s tone, it was only a small increase.

The first raw stone had already gotten a good start, so Yu mingdong naturally continued to work hard and immediately began to cut the second raw stone.

He Ping received Yu mingdong’s pay and did his job well, sparing no effort in the work of technical guidance.

When they heard that the raw gemstones here had increased in price, more and more people gathered to watch.

While everyone was discussing, Xia ruofei just watched quietly from the side. Indeed, he did not have much professional knowledge and could only watch the show.

However, from everyone’s discussion, Xia ruofei roughly knew that Yu mingdong had earned a lot today.

He opened three raw gemstones in a row, and all of them rose in value. From everyone’s envious looks, Xia ruofei knew that it was rare to see three consecutive increases in value.

It was not until the fourth piece that everyone sighed.

This one had lost. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

It was said that the raw stone that was bought for more than 1.2 million only had a few fragments in the end. It was estimated that he could not even earn back a fraction of the money.

However, Yu mingdong didn’t care too much. He was already very surprised that the price increased by so many stones. This was how stone gambling was. If every stone increased, who would be willing to sell their raw stones? They should all be opened to sell bright materials.

Moreover, Yu mingdong’s greatest hope was still the number 633 raw stone.

He had spent more than 20 million on this raw stone. More than half of the money he had invested this time had been spent on this raw stone. In Yu mingdong’s eyes, the first few were just appetizers.

He continued to cut the stone.

Other than number 633, there were four other raw gemstones of different sizes that were quickly cut out.

Two of them had a small increase in value. One of them had completely gone bankrupt and lost 900000 Yuan. The other one had basically made a capital – breaking profit, but the Jade that was taken out could still be processed and made a small profit.

Yu mingdong did a rough calculation. Compared to buying raw materials directly, he had earned three million Yuan from the first eight raw stones. Naturally, he was in a good mood.

Just as Yu mingdong was in high spirits and was about to open the last raw stone, Xia ruofei suddenly said,””President Yu, I’m getting a little impatient after seeing you open these pieces one by one. Why don’t you ... Open mine first?”

Yu mingdong was stunned for a moment, but he still said very readily,””Alright! No problem!”

Xia ruofei then said to He Ping,”old he, can I trouble you to give me some guidance?” I don’t know anything about this ...”

Through the few raw gemstones just now, Xia ruofei had a new understanding of He Ping’s ability. In addition, he could only sense the Jade in the raw gemstones through the Spirit map scroll, but he did not know the specific location of the Jade. As for how to cut it, he had no idea at all. He had to rely on the guidance of a professional.
