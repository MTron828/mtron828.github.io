“Uncle!” Huan Huan shouted happily from afar. This time, his pronunciation was much clearer than it was a few days ago. A gentle smile appeared on Xia ruofei’s face. He squatted down and opened his arms. Huanhuan jumped into his arms and rubbed her pink face against Xia ruofei ‘s. “Huanhuan, did you miss uncle?” Xia ruofei asked as he hugged Huanhuan. “I really want to!” Huan Huan answered very seriously. “How much did you miss me?” Huan Huan tilted her head and thought for a moment. She then opened her arms and gestured,”I did think so!” After that, the adults who followed them all laughed happily. Even Lu You had a rare smile on her face. Xia ruofei stood up with Huanhuan in his arms and greeted them,””Mr. MA, Ms. Tian, Lu You, how are you?” “Xia Sheng, the environment of your farm is not bad!” Ma Zhiming smiled and said,”it seems that you’re doing very well in your career!” Tian Huixin also smiled and greeted Xia ruofei. Lu You also nodded at Xia ruofei in greeting. Her expression was much gentler than before. She no longer looked like Xia ruofei owed her a few million dollars. She even had a slight smile on her face. It was obvious that her impression of Xia ruofei had changed greatly. Xia ruofei smiled and said to Ma Zhiming,””It’s just a small fight, it’s not enough to catch Mr. Ma’s eyes!” Then, he pinched Huanhuan’s little face and asked,””By the way, Mr. MA, Ms. Tian, has Huanhuan finished her medicine? How’s the situation?” “Little Xia, the effect of your Chinese medicine is very obvious!” Tian Huixin said excitedly. “That’s right, Xia Sheng. You’re a godly doctor!” Ma Zhiming was also very excited.”We’re here to thank you!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”come, come, come. Let’s talk inside!” Ye Lingyun was dumbfounded. He had never heard of instructor Xia having medical skills, and it seemed like he was very good at it. But why did instructor Xia always go to the health team when he had a headache in the Army? He must have taken a fancy to a beautiful female soldier in the health team! Ye Lingyun guessed in his heart. Xia ruofei naturally didn’t know that the quiet ye Lingyun’s heart was also burning with the flames of gossip. He led the group into the villa’s courtyard. Ma Zhiming’s bodyguards in black stayed outside the courtyard. Seeing so many people coming in, lightning, who had been lying there lazily in the sun, suddenly got up. It glanced at the crowd with vigilance and made a whimpering sound. “Lightning, these are my guests. Don’t be rude!” Xia ruofei was worried that lightning would scare people, so he quickly shouted. After hearing Xia ruofei’s words, lightning immediately resumed its languidness. It glanced at the crowd indifferently, then strolled to the other side of the courtyard where there was more sunlight. It lay down comfortably and continued to bask in the sun. When Huan Huan saw lightning, whose fur was as smooth as silk, she was elated. She pointed at lightning with her pink little finger and shouted,””Doggie ... Doggie ...” “Huanhuan, that dog’s name is lightning,” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”do you want to play with lightning?” “I want to!” Huan Huan said without hesitation. “Alright!” Xia ruofei placed Huanhuan on the ground and said with a smile,”go!” “Little Xia, this ...” Tian Huixin couldn’t help but worry about the lightning. It had been very fierce just now. Xia ruofei smiled.”Madam Tian, don’t be afraid. Lightning is very gentle!” Then, Xia ruofei said,””Lightning, play with Huanhuan. Don’t scare her, okay?” Lightning raised its eyelids and slowly wagged its tail, indicating that it understood. Huan Huan ran to lightning happily and stroked its smooth fur. Tian Huixin’s heart almost jumped out of her throat. However, lightning seemed to enjoy it. She closed her eyes slightly and let Huanhuan touch her. It even gently touched Huanhuan with its nose, looking quite docile. The more Huanhuan played, the happier she became. In the end, she simply put her arms around Lightning’s neck and mumbled something to lightning. She was trying to remind lightning that her language skills were still worse than those of other children her age. Tian Huixin looked at it for a while before she slowly relaxed. Xia ruofei left ye Lingyun in the courtyard to look after Huanhuan while he brought Ma Zhiming, his wife, and Lu You into the villa. Everyone took their seats in the living room. Xia ruofei made tea for the three of them, then sat down and said with a smile,””It seems like Huanhuan’s condition has improved greatly.” Tian Huixin excitedly nodded and said,”that’s right, little Xia!” Huanhuan’s condition improved a little every time she took the medicine. It was like a dream to us!” Tian Huixin glanced at her daughter, who was playing happily with lightning in the yard, and continued,””Huanhuan’s eyes are fine now. She can look into adults ‘eyes and she can listen to us seriously. She can even communicate normally. It’s just that she needs time to recover her language function ...” As she spoke, Tian Huixin’s eyes turned red again. She had been worried sick about her daughter for the past few years and had experienced countless times of hope, disappointment, and even despair. Now that Huanhuan had changed so much, it was hard to describe the feelings she had. Ma Zhiming put his arm around his wife’s shoulder and patted her gently, saying,”Xia Sheng, we took Huanhuan to do a long – range dynamic encephalog yesterday, and the results were very normal. The epileptic waves that had always existed before have all disappeared! The doctor said that this is an important sign that the brain nervous system has returned to normal!” “That’s great!” Xia ruofei said with a smile. Huanhuan was a cute little girl, but she had always lived in her own world. Now that she had recovered, Xia ruofei was naturally happy for her from the bottom of his heart. “I’ll prepare another course of Chinese medicine today to consolidate the effects!” Xia ruofei said,”I think the problem will be completely solved after one or two more treatments!” “Xia Sheng, I can’t thank you enough!” Ma Zhiming said as he held Xia ruofei’s hand tightly. Then, Ma Zhiming took out a check from the inner pocket of his suit and handed it to Xia ruofei. He said,”Xia Sheng, I know that you didn’t treat Huanhuan for money, but this is a gift from the MA family. You must accept it!” Xia ruofei took the check and saw that it was a million Chinese dollars. He pondered for a while and said with a smile without being pretentious,””Alright, then I won’t stand on ceremony.” After that, he put the check away. In Xia ruofei’s opinion, a million Yuan for a complete petal of a strange flower was not too expensive. When Lu You saw this, she muttered in her heart,”This fellow was truly impolite, not even rejecting the offer ... However, even though she said that in her heart, Lu You realized that she did not feel disgusted by Xia ruofei’s behavior like she did in the past. On the contrary, she felt that he was a genuine person and not pretentious. She didn’t even realize that her impression of Xia ruofei had changed. Xia ruofei said,”you guys stay here and play with Huanhuan for a while. I’ll go to the county’s Traditional Chinese Medicine pharmacy to get some medicine and boil it. When the time comes, you can just bring it back and keep it in the cold storage.” “Alright, alright. Sorry to trouble you, Xia Sheng!” Ma Zhiming quickly said. Xia ruofei looked at Lu You and asked with a smile,””Young miss Lu, do you want to come with me to buy medicine today?” Lu You’s pretty face heated up slightly and she said,””I’m too lazy to follow! What if you’re going to go to ... That, I’ll have to wait for you for a long time!” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh. He picked up the car keys on the coffee table and walked out. At this moment, Ma Zhiming’s phone suddenly rang urgently. “Hello? “I’m ...”Ma Zhiming said in Cantonese. No one knew what the person on the other end of the phone said, but Ma Zhiming’s face suddenly changed and he asked hurriedly,” what?” How did this happen? My dad’s been in good health ... Is he in danger? Hurry up and tell me ... Okay, I know ... I know ...”
