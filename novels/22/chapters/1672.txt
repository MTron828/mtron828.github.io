Chapter 1673: God’s arrangement (3)

Alex was a little old man in his early fifties. His white hair was very sparse, and the staff uniform on his chubby body was tight. He had a hearty smile on his face.

“Brook! I’m the same!” Alex said,”when I saw you in the past, I wanted to step on your face a few times! Today, I’m the exact opposite. I’m looking forward to seeing you alive. I didn’t even look forward to it this much on our first date when we were young ...”

The two of them burst out laughing. Xia ruofei felt that if Brook was not injured and could not raise his hand, the two of them would have hugged each other. The thought of that scene was full of gay love ...

After exchanging a few words with Brook, Alex turned to Xia ruofei and said,””You must be Mr. Xia! Let me introduce myself. I’m the station master of the quosé airlines station in Saipan. My name is Alex! On behalf of quasé airlines, I would like to express my gratitude to Mr. Xia for his heroic feat! The company’s senior management is on their way to Saipan, and they will thank you in person!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Mr. Alex, I just don’t want to fall into the sea with the plane!” Captain Brook has been a great help. Otherwise, I’m afraid I wouldn’t have been able to handle such a complex and sophisticated control equipment alone!”

“Brook will get a medal that belongs to him!” Alex said.

At this moment, Brook’s expression darkened. He asked in a low voice,”Alex, have you seen Captain Johansson?”

The smile on Alex’s face faltered, and a hint of grief appeared on his face as he said,””Brook, I know what you want to ask. The doctor got on the plane immediately and examined Johannson, but unfortunately, he passed away a long time ago ...”

Brook closed his eyes sadly and mumbled,”Old man ... You’re going to retire in three months ...” He said.

Alex patted Brook’s shoulder, and said,””Alright, don’t think too much! The first thing you need to do now is to go to the hospital and get your wound treated. Everyone is looking forward to seeing you return to the blue sky!”

“I know ...” Brook whispered.

The passengers had all been evacuated. Xia ruofei, Feng Jing, Brook, and Alex had all walked out of the cockpit. Xia ruofei asked,””What are the passengers” arrangements?”

Most of the passengers on this flight were Chinese. Xia ruofei was naturally concerned about the situation of his fellow Chinese.

“Don’t worry, Mr. Xia,” Alex said.”Our company has already sent a plane to land in Saipan!” If the passengers wish to continue the journey, they can change to our company’s flight. If they feel uncomfortable, they can also choose to stay in Saipan. Our company will be responsible for their accommodation during this time! Of course, all the passengers will be compensated by our airline!”

Xia ruofei nodded. He was quite satisfied with this arrangement.

By the way, can Chinese travelers enter Saipan?”he asked. Xia ruofei asked.

“Saipan is a tourist Island in the U.S.,” Feng Rao said with a smile.”Since November 2009, Chinese people have enjoyed a 45 – day visa – Free treatment in Saipan. They can enter the country as long as they have a Chinese passport!”

“That’s good!” Xia ruofei said,”I also want to play in Saipan for a few days! However, the situation in Australia is more urgent, so ... Let’s take an Australian plane and continue to fly to Australia!” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“I’ll listen to your arrangement. You’re the boss!” Feng Rao said with a smile.

“Mr. Xia,” Alex said,”the airport Police will ask you and the crew about the situation in a while. The senior executives of Quto airlines will also express their gratitude to you in person, so...You may have to stay in Saipan for a day or two. You won’t be able to take a later flight to Australia.”

Xia ruofei was dumbfounded and looked at Feng Jing with a bitter smile.

“Let’s just take things as they come,”Feng Rao chuckled and said,” in the words of Captain Brook, this is God’s arrangement ...”
