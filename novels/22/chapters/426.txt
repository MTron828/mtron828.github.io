Chapter 427: Trouble at the door (2)

The policewoman was about twenty – five or twenty – six years old, and her well – fitting police uniform outlined her figure perfectly, especially her chest, which was quite large at first glance. The police uniform was stretched tightly, and the buttons on her chest seemed to be in danger of bursting at any time.

There were two other police officers beside the policewoman, both in their thirties, but they looked more like her subordinates. The two of them stood at the side, their expressions were far less relaxed than the policewoman ‘s, and their faces were full of vigilance.

Lei Hu also greeted them from the side, but the three of them had no intention of talking to Lei Hu.

When he saw Xia ruofei walking in with lightning, Lei Hu shouted,””Brother Xia!”

There was a trace of worry in his eyes. The three policemen obviously came with ill intentions. He had seen their IDs, and they were all from the city Police detachment.

Usually, when the criminal Police were dispatched, it would definitely not be a small case.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded at Lei Hu, giving him a comforting look.

When the two male police officers saw Xia ruofei, they squinted their eyes at the same time. Then, they quietly moved a few steps towards the door, blocking Xia ruofei’s way out.

Lei Hu could not help but frown.

Xia ruofei naturally saw the two policemen’s actions, but he had a faint smile on his face and pretended not to see Jian Jia. In fact, if Xia ruofei really wanted to leave, even ten times more people would not be able to stop him, let alone two of them.

But his career was here, and even if the police were here for the zero degrees dream bar, what happened that night wasn’t a big deal. He wouldn’t run away for this.

When the big – breasted policewoman heard the noise, she finally looked away from the Knight XV and turned to look at Xia ruofei.

“Police comrades, is there something you need from me?” Xia ruofei asked indifferently.

His eyes subconsciously swept over the policewoman’s impressive chest. At this moment, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but have a thought. With such a big “burden” on her, how could the policewoman run when she caught the thief? She should have been doing office work. Why did she become a Criminal Police officer?

In fact, Xia ruofei could not be blamed for this. The policewoman’s “chest” was too eye – catching. It was hard not to attract Xia ruofei’s attention.

The female police officer sharply felt Xia ruofei’s gaze and a trace of anger flashed in her eyes. In fact, she was very troubled by this. She had met many similar gazes over the years and it made her feel very embarrassed every time.

The female police officer glared at Xia ruofei and asked stiffly,””You’re Xia ruofei?”

Xia ruofei nodded and continued to ask,””Why are you looking for me?”

“Is this car yours?” The female police officer ignored Xia ruofei and continued to ask.

Xia ruofei frowned and said indifferently,””Police officer, what do you want from me? My time is precious. ”

The policewoman snorted coldly and said,”aren’t I interrogating you?” Is this car yours or not?”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel angry. He said,””Interrogation? What crime have I committed that I need to be interrogated?”

“Don’t you know that in your heart?” The female police officer asked Xia ruofei with a half – Smile.

Xia ruofei’s expression turned cold as he said,”I don’t want to play riddles with you anymore!” Officer, no matter what questions you have, please show me your identification! This request of mine isn’t too much, is it?”

“You ...” The female police officer glared at Xia ruofei and almost lost her temper.

However, when she saw the other two police officers looking in her direction, she suppressed her anger and reached into her shirt pocket to take out her police badge.

Xia ruofei clearly saw the peaks on the female police officer’s chest tremble a few times when she took out her identification card. He couldn’t help but secretly click his tongue in wonder. He didn’t expect that she could still put an identification card in such a tight place ...

The female police officer showed her id to Xia ruofei and said, “We’re from the criminal Police Division of the city Public Security Bureau. We need your assistance in an investigation of a case. ” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Xia ruofei picked his ears and said calmly,””It was too fast, I didn’t see clearly ...”

“What do you mean by that?” The female police officer glared at him and asked sternly.

Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”I didn’t see clearly.” Even a God wouldn’t be able to see you clearly, right? Who knows if your id is fake? Recently, there have been a lot of scammers pretending to be soldiers and police! Although our Tao Yuan farm is a small business, it’s hard to guarantee that we won’t be targeted by scammers ...”

“Xia ruofei, watch your attitude. Who are you calling a liar?” The female police officer gritted her teeth and asked.

“I’m just saying that it’s possible. ” Xia ruofei said innocently,”officer, your id is not something that can be seen by others. Didn’t your superiors teach you that you should take the initiative to show your ID to the public when you’re on a mission?”

The female police officer’s face was ashen. She opened her police badge and showed it to Xia ruofei. Then, she said through gritted teeth,””Take a good look!”

Xia ruofei grinned and suddenly pounced forward.

The female police officer’s expression changed slightly. The two police officers behind Xia ruofei also subconsciously reached for their waists.
