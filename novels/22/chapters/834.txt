Lin Yue ‘e had wanted to send Xia ruofei out, but Xia ruofei firmly rejected her. He smiled and said,””Sister – in – Law, you have so many things to do at home. Don’t bother about me. I’m such a big boy. How could I get lost?”

With that, Xia ruofei patted Nan Nan’s head gently and left the Luo family’s old house with his bag.

Initially, Xia ruofei wanted to walk to the road outside and hail a taxi. However, he had not gone far from the Luo family’s residence when he heard the sound of an engine from behind.

A tractor stopped beside him, and a villager asked enthusiastically,””Mr. Xia, where are you going?”

Xia ruofei did not know this villager, but he knew that this person should have participated in the encirclement of Huang Zhenyu and the other two at the Luo family’s Gate this morning. Otherwise, he would not know him.

Xia ruofei smiled.”I’m going back. I’m going to rent a car in town.”

“Come up! I’m going to the town to buy fertilizer, so I’ll give you a ride!” The villager said with a smile.

“Alright! Thank you!”

Since he didn’t have to walk, Xia ruofei was more than happy. He used one hand to get on the back of the tractor. The villagers laughed and started the tractor again.

There were even some straw in the trunk. Xia ruofei placed his backpack behind his head and laid down comfortably. He looked at the blue sky and felt a little proud. It had only been two days, but his prestige in the Luo mountain village had already risen.

The road was a little bumpy but Xia ruofei was lying on a thick layer of straw and felt very relaxed.

They arrived at the town in no time. The villager was very enthusiastic as he sent Xia ruofei to a taxi stop at the big bridge.

Many people in a small town were familiar with each other. The villager asked Xia ruofei and found out that he was going to Yuzhang. He went to find a familiar driver and quickly negotiated a price for Xia ruofei to book a car to Yuzhang. It was 500 yuan in total.

It was indeed much cheaper than Xia ruofei’s car from the provincial capital.

Xia ruofei thanked the villager with a smile. Then, he got on the car and headed for the provincial capital, Yuzhang.

Most of the areas in Ganjiang province were mountainous, so the roads were not easy to walk on.

Xia ruofei only returned to the provincial capital, Yuzhang, when night fell.

He asked the driver to send him to a Shangri – La hotel in the city, paid the fare, and then went to the hotel with his bag to book a room.

Yuzhang’s economy wasn’t as developed as the coastal cities. Although the Shangri – La here was also of the standard of a five – Star hotel, a normal King – sized room only cost about 800 Yuan. To Xia ruofei, this level of expense was naturally not a concern.

He went to his room and took a bath, then lay down on the soft bed, feeling all the fatigue in his body swept away.

Xia ruofei lay down for a while before he took out his phone and started to search for flight tickets on the internet.

Soon, he booked a flight from Yuzhang to Lhasa, Tibet, at about 10 am the next day.

Then, Xia ruofei called the front desk and booked a car for 8:30 pm.

The next morning, after Xia ruofei had his breakfast at the hotel’s buffet restaurant, he took a taxi to Yuzhang’s changbei International Airport and successfully boarded the flight to Xueyu plateau.

However, there was no direct flight from Yuzhang to Lhasa. Xia ruofei’s flight stopped in Xi’an and stopped at Xianyang International Airport for more than two hours before boarding again.

When he took off from Xi’an, he was even caught in traffic control. Xia ruofei had to wait for more than an hour on the plane. When he finally arrived at Lhasa’s Gongga International Airport, it was already around eighto’ clock in the evening.

He had spent the entire day on the road.

Before he came, Xia ruofei had already done some research on the internet. The latest train from Lhasa to Nagqu would depart at 6:20 p.m. So he had to stay in Lhasa for one night.

As transportation was not developed, Xia ruofei could not do anything about it.

He took a taxi to a four – Star hotel near the train station and stayed there for the night. At the same time, he booked a ticket for the earliest train to Nagqu the next day.

The next morning at 8:50 am, Xia ruofei’s train started slowly and headed towards his destination, Nagqu.

The train traveled on the plateau. The blue sky was all that could be seen, and the scenery along the way was intoxicatingly beautiful.

Sometimes, the train would cross the Qingzang Highway. Xia ruofei could see many backpackers on the Qingzang Highway, cheering and waving in the direction of the train.

As the train traveled on this unpolluted plateau, Xia ruofei looked at the snow – capped mountains in the distance. He felt as if his heart had opened up.

After three and a half hours of travel, Xia ruofei finally arrived Nagqu County.

Xia ruofei walked out of the shabby train station with a simple bag on his back. He was wearing a windbreaker, a pair of hiking shoes, a canvas bag on his back, and a pair of sunglasses that were necessary for traveling on Highlands. He looked like an ordinary backpacker.

Xia ruofei found a small restaurant in the county and had lunch. Then, he carried his canvas bag and started to wander around the county.

Nagqu County County was a well – known place for producing Cordyceps, and there were many places in the county that sold it. Almost all the shops on the street had signs that said “high – Quality Cordyceps”.
