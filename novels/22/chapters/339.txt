The pot of orchid was quietly placed on the ground. No one spoke. The entire place was silent, and everyone’s breathing became heavy. This pot of orchid no longer looked sickly like it did three days ago. Its leaves were emerald green and exuded vitality. Moreover, this pot of orchid had bloomed with several flowers. The petals were quite fat and smooth, especially the several huge golden noses. Together with the several colorful tongues, it looked like a Green Lion. It was just like its name. The most unbelievable thing was that even though the Jade lion was very beautiful before the onset of the illness, it was far from having the spiritual charm it had now. This was also the highest realm pursued by orchid lovers. The pot of flowers was just quietly placed there, but it gave people a fresh and refined feeling of noble character. It was believed that even people who had never appreciated orchids would immediately feel the modest demeanor of a gentleman among flowers as soon as they saw this pot of black orchids. What was even more unbelievable was that in just three days, this pot of ink orchid seemed to have grown a lot. The width and length of the leaves, as well as the number of flowers, were all more than three days ago. “Brother Xia, this is incredible ...” Jiang Yue could not help but exclaim in admiration,”how did you do it?” Jiang Yue’s words brought Xia Cheng and the rest back to their senses. They all turned to look at Xia ruofei. It was obvious that everyone had the same question in their minds. Only Lu You’s expression was still normal. From her perspective, Xia ruofei was someone who was good at creating miracles. Although the changes in this pot of ink orchid had surprised her, it was not to the extent of disbelief. Peng Hui, you Jun, and the others “faces were a bit ugly, especially Chen Song, who had taken out the pot of Hui LAN to show off. His face was red and white, and his expression was quite wonderful! Xia ruofei smiled and did not answer Jiang Yue’s question. Instead, he asked,””How is it? Is everyone satisfied with the extent of recovery of the orchid?” Actually, Xia ruofei did not know much about orchids. However, when he saw everyone’s expressions, he realized that things were a little too good. A few days ago, he had made a three – day promise. In order to ensure that nothing went wrong, he watered the pot of orchid with a relatively strong petal solution and put it in the original space. Therefore, although three days had passed in the outside world, in reality, this pot of orchid had already spent three months in the original space. Such a long period of time was enough for it to absorb all the petal solution. As for the condition of this pot of Mo Lan, Xia ruofei naturally did not know what illness it had. However, this was not important. With three months ‘time and the watering of the petal solution, the mo Lan had naturally recovered completely. Moreover, under the nourishment of the spiritual Qi in the space, this pot of Black Orchid had grown a lot, and unconsciously, it had a bit more of the charm of a gentleman among flowers. Xia Cheng said with an excited expression,””I’m more than satisfied! This is a huge surprise!” “Yes, brother Xia!” Jiang Yue said happily,”not only has this pot of mo orchid been reborn, but you’ve also raised it to have a trace of spirit. This is great!” The students of the garden art Club were also shocked and they couldn’t help but talk about it. “My heavens! This brother that Lu You found is so awesome!” “He’s simply a fierce person! “I know about that pot of mo orchid. Even teacher Xu was helpless. Everyone said that it would wither and die before the flower exhibition, but he actually saved it in three days ...” “It’s not as simple as saving her life!” Another person exclaimed,”it’s not an exaggeration to say that he’s been Reborn! If that orchid had participated in the flower exhibition, it could have at most kept its place in the top three. But now, it’s very likely that it’ll even win the gold Prize!” “It’s said that orchids have a divine charm. I’ve finally seen it today!” “What an expert ...” They seemed to have forgotten that a few minutes ago, almost no one believed that Xia ruofei could cure the orchid. They were all skeptical. Now, Xia ruofei did not say anything. He just took out the pot of orchid and placed it on the ground. Almost everyone was convinced. Lu You bit her lower lip and her eyes bloomed with a strange light. She looked at Xia ruofei and asked,””Have you really never raised orchids before?” Xia ruofei nodded and said,”no!” I raised pigs in the Army before ...” Pfft ... A few girls couldn’t help but laugh when they heard this, and Jiang Yue was even more so. Raising orchids was such an elegant thing! This Xia ruofei actually compared raising orchids to raising pigs. Was there a comparison between the two? Lu You couldn’t help but roll her eyes at Xia ruofei. She thought to herself,”I didn’t have to ask. Even if this guy has never raised orchids before, he can still create such a miracle because he’s always been good at creating miracles.” “So, I’ve completed my mission?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile. Lu You nodded and said,”thanks!” I owe you a favor ...” The students of the Garden Club looked at Xia ruofei with envy. Lu You and Jiang Yue were the most popular girls in the gardening club. To be honest, almost all the boys present had secretly liked Lu You or Jiang Yue before. It was just that they had not shown it as obviously as Peng Hui and you Jun. It was a pity that Lu You was too cold and aloof, and Jiang Yue was too shy. None of them had ever been able to get close to these two beauties. That was why they were so envious of Xia ruofei. As for Peng Hui, you Jun, and Chen Song, they were filled with jealousy. Chen song’s expression was especially unsightly. Not far from this pot of jade lion Mo Lan, there was the pot of Hui LAN that Chen Song had brought. A few minutes ago, Chen Song was still proud of himself. He felt like he was the Savior of the world. At the most difficult time for Sanshan University’s gardening club, he had selflessly offered this pot of fine orchid to help them solve their urgent needs. But now, Chen Song felt like a clown. The pot of Hui LAN was as eye – catching as the red Nose of a clown. He couldn’t wait for a divine lightning to suddenly fall from the sky and destroy the pot of Hui LAN. Xia ruofei’s gaze passed through the crowd and landed on Chen Song. He said indifferently,””This student, it seems that the gardening club of Sanshan University doesn’t need your ‘sincerity’ anymore ...” Chen Song said in a flustered and exasperated manner,”Hmph! Even if you can cure this plant, there’s nothing to be proud of!” Then, Chen Song sneered and continued,”Xia Cheng, do you know why I agreed to lend you this Hui LAN?” That’s because our Agriculture and Forestry University’s gardening department found a pot of top – grade yang Lotus! Compared to our pot of orchids, your jade lion is still a little lacking! Hehe ... I’m afraid your dream of winning the gold medal in the flower exhibition will be dashed!”
