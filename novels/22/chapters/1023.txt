Xia ruofei smiled and said,”let’s go!” Let’s talk in my office!”

The two of them returned to Xia ruofei’s office. Xia ruofei opened the ice bar and took out some tea leaves to make tea. He smiled and asked,””Boss Feng, what’s the matter? why are you in such a hurry?”

Feng Rao glanced at Xia ruofei and said,””Chairman, I’ve been paying attention to the locations for the company’s headquarters to move to the city. I’ve found a few places and wanted to report to you.”

The company’s headquarters moving to the city was the general trend. After all, Tao Yuan farm’s location was too remote and didn’t match the identity and image of a big company.

Not to mention other things, just to discuss cooperation or have business partners to visit the company, the first impression would definitely be greatly reduced when they saw that the Paradise corporation’s headquarters was actually in a coastal fishing village.

Feng Jing had mentioned it to Xia ruofei a few times, but she knew that Xia ruofei was a little lazy and it was unrealistic to expect him to make the decision on his own. Therefore, she took the initiative to follow up on this matter.

Xia ruofei scratched his head awkwardly and chuckled,””I’ve been too busy recently and didn’t have time to take care of this matter. Boss Feng, tell us about your inspection!”

“Chairman, I’ve picked two places after a round of inspection and selection ...” Feng Jing cleared her throat and said.

Then, Feng Rao introduced the two places she had chosen to Xia ruofei.

One of the three locations was located in the city center. The advantage was that it had a good location and complete facilities. It was the CBD area of Sanshan city. The disadvantages were obvious as well. It was expensive and the land was a little small. Moreover, the shops were only selling and not renting.

The second plot of land was also within the Second Ring Road. It was in a good location and was a commercial office building project, Hengli Times Square, developed by a well – known domestic real estate company. The price was also quite appropriate. Although the real estate price in Sanshan city changed every day and showed signs of breaking through the sky, overall, the price of about 20000 per square meter was still reasonable. Most importantly, this company also had five floors as self – sustaining assets. If they chose this plot of land, they could also rent it out, which was equivalent to buying it all in one go. If they rented it, the one – time investment would be much less.

After Xia ruofei listened to her carefully, he didn’t rush to express his opinion. Instead, he smiled and asked,””Boss Feng, what’s your opinion? Which one do you prefer?”

Feng Rao had clearly thought about it before she said,””From a long – term perspective, the office buildings in Heng Li are more suitable. It would be best if we can buy two to three floors ...”

Feng Jing didn’t sound too confident. After all, this was an astronomical figure. Based on her understanding of the company’s financial situation, she knew that the company didn’t have that much liquid funds in its account.

Xia ruofei just smiled and said,””You can continue!”

“If it’s difficult to buy it out directly, it’s better to rent it first,” Feng Rao nodded. Of course, the first location is closer to the bustling city center, which will be more helpful to the company’s brand. The problem is that it will also require a large amount of capital. ”

Xia ruofei nodded.”Have you calculated the amount of capital needed for each plan?” he asked.

“I’ve done a rough calculation. The single – story office building in the city center is 2000 square meters, and the unit price is 30000 Yuan per square meter. It will cost 120 million Yuan to buy two floors. This doesn’t include the investment for the renovation. I estimate that the total investment will exceed 200 million Yuan.”

Xia ruofei smiled without changing his expression and asked,””What about the office building in Hengli?”

“Hengli is priced at 20000 Yuan per square meter due to its location,” said Feng Jing.”The single floor is about 1500 square meters. If it’s here, I suggest you buy or rent three floors at once.”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”if it’s sold out, it’ll be about 90 million.”

“I haven’t even included the renovation costs.” Feng Rao added.

Feng Rao hesitated for a moment before saying,””Chairman, how about ... We rent the office building first ...”

Xia ruofei smiled.”If you want to do it, do it in one go. I’ll solve the funding problem.”

“That would be for the best, of course!” Feng Rao blurted out.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”CEO Feng, I can’t make a decision at the moment.” How about this, you can sort out the specific situation of the two locations and send me a copy of the information. In addition, we can find time to go to the site for an on – Site Investigation. ”

“No problem. I’ve already organized the information. I’ll get Liu Qian to send it over to you in a while.” Feng ke said.

She had always been a quick worker. Since she had already reported to Xia ruofei, she must have made the necessary preparations.

Xia ruofei knew Feng Jing’s style. He smiled and said,””Alright,” he said.

“We shouldn’t just limit our vision to these two locations. We can look further!” Xia ruofei continued.

“Chairman, I don’t quite understand ...” Feng Jing said, confused.

Xia ruofei smiled.”I mean, don’t just think about buying office buildings. I think you should also pay attention to whether there are any land in the city that is going to be sold. We can build our own headquarters!”

“Building your own building?” Feng Rao was also shocked.
