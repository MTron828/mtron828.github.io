Chapter 1926 Unusually smooth (1)

Going back to half an hour ago.

In the Haixi satellite TV’s urban intelligence Station team, which was under the southeast province television station, the editor on duty, Xiao Zhu, was reviewing a news video sent back from the front.

As the only high – ranking TV station in the southeast province, Haixi satellite TV’s audience was not limited to the southeast province. In theory, the entire country could watch it.

Although Haixi satellite TV’s influence was not as great as xiangnan satellite TV and other provincial stations, it was still above average among all the satellite TV channels in the country. Many of the programs had high viewership ratings, so the review system was also more complete. After the editor – in – charge reviewed and proofread, he had to mark it backstage and then report it to the Deputy editor – in – charge for final review. Only after the final review passed could the broadcast be arranged.

Just as Xiao Zhu was carefully reviewing the news video, the phone in the news Office rang.

He immediately put down the work in his hands and quickly registered the phone number with practiced ease. Then he picked up the phone.”Hello, I’m from the Haixi satellite TV City information Station program team.”

“I have a piece of news here ...” A low voice was heard.

Xiao Zhu quickly jotted down the information. After hanging up the phone, he thought for a moment and then dialed a number.

This was a social news lead. The woman’s affair was discovered by her husband, and the husband was caught in bed with his men. It wasn’t a very special news lead, but the person who broke the news also said that the woman might be a public figure. Moreover, the man had brought many people, including steel pipes and other things. The scene might be quite hot.

Xiao Zhu felt that this kind of news was worth reporting. Moreover, a group of reporters had just returned from the scene, and they had the manpower, so he decided to inform this group of reporters to take a look at the West Lake Mansion.

After a while, an interview vehicle with the logos of the provincial TV station and Haixi TV station drove out of the TV station’s Gate.

Xu You, who had been giving orders in the rented house, received news from Zhang Aijun, who had arrived in advance near the entrance of the TV station. He immediately gave Zeng Liang, who had successfully infiltrated the community, a task.

To be honest, there were only four of them. To complete Xia ruofei’s plan, they were indeed short on manpower. Every link had to be calculated very accurately. Fortunately, they had been doing well so far.

Liu haojun’s car had just entered the West Lake Mansion when Haixi TV’s interview car set off. The time had to be calculated very accurately, with an error of at least five minutes.

When the interview vehicle of Haixi TV was about to arrive at the West Lake Mansion, the head of security was patrolling the neighborhood with a security guard.

As he passed by the central square, a young man wearing a cap was looking at his mobile phone as he walked. The security Captain was used to this kind of low – Head people, so he deliberately dodged to the side when he passed by.

The young man in the cap was looking at his mobile phone as he walked. The path he took was a little crooked. When he met the security Captain, he also took a step to the side and the two of them just happened to bump into each other.

At this time, the young man in the cap seemed to come back to his senses and quickly apologized to the security Captain.

The security captain’s attitude was not bad, and he even specially reminded her,””Young man, it’s best not to look at your phone when you’re walking. It’s not safe ...”

The young man in the cap said,””Okay, okay, thanks for the reminder ...”

It was just a small interlude, but the security Captain didn’t take it to heart. Instead, he continued to patrol with another security guard.

He did not realize that something was missing from his pocket ...

The young man in the cap was Zeng Liang. He didn’t stay in the central square after he got what he wanted. Instead, he walked along the road toward Building 3.

Wearing a mask, Wang Chong walked over. As the two of them passed each other, Zeng Liang swiftly passed a card to Wang Chong.

Zeng Liang, on the other hand, made a small detour and walked toward the entrance of the residential area.

Of course, he didn’t go out, but sat by the flower pond near the door to rest.

Not long after, the interview vehicle of Haixi TV appeared in Zeng Liang’s line of sight.

The interview car slowly stopped at the entrance of the community. The reporter of the interview team, Liu Yuan, was already ready to negotiate with the security guard to let them in. There was indeed a security guard coming over from the guardhouse.

Neither Liu Yuan nor the security guard noticed that Zeng Liang, who had his hands in his pockets, was holding a remote control and pressing it hard by the flower pond not far away.

Then, the fence at the entrance of the neighborhood was raised ...

Liu Yuan was stunned for a moment, then she reacted and quickly said,””Brother driver, let’s just drive in!” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

The bar rose by itself, which surprised Liu Yuan, but she quickly realized that this was an opportunity.

News leads were usually fleeting, and West Lake Mansion was a well – known high – end community. The management of people and vehicles entering and leaving the community was relatively strict. Even if they stopped to negotiate, they might not be allowed to enter. Since the roadblock had been raised by itself, Liu Yuan naturally decided to drive in directly.

Liu Yuan knew that if she followed the rules obediently, she might not be able to get into the community at all. Even if she managed to get in successfully, this news clue might have lost its value during the time they were wrangling at the door.
