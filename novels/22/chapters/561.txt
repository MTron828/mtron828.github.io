Chapter 562: Earning 20 million Yuan (2)

When master Luo heard this, he could not help but smile. Although he knew that the quality of this batch of maple fight was extremely high, he still felt a sense of accomplishment as the creator of this batch of maple fight after hearing it from director Lin of Tongren Hall.

President Lin thought for a moment and said,”brother Xia, how about this? I’ll take up a little more of your time. I’ll contact the pharmaceutical research Institute of the provincial Academy of Medical Sciences right away and send this batch of Feng Dou samples to do a comprehensive test. I have a few friends in the Institute. I’ll ask them to do special things. The results should be out by today!” With the test report, we’ll have enough basis for the pricing!”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and nodded. “That’s fine. Big brother Lin, if you don’t think it’s troublesome, we’ll do as you say!”

President Lin said happily,”Okay, okay, okay. Brother Xia, I’ll arrange for someone to get it done immediately. You can have some tea with this master in my office first ...”

President Lin arranged for someone to collect some samples and then called his friends who worked at the pharmaceutical research Institute. After he was done, President Lin personally went to the office to accompany Xia ruofei and master Luo to make tea.

Even if Mr. Lin had a lot of connections and the herbal research Institute would help him immediately, it would take time to turn on the equipment, warm it up, test it, and send out the report.

The three of them waited until the evening, but there was still no news from the other side. Hence, CEO Lin ordered the staff to go to a nearby hotel to pack some food and wine. He then had dinner with Xia ruofei and master Luo in his office.

At Seveno’ clock in the evening, Mr. Lin’s phone rang. He looked at the caller ID and immediately put down his glass. He stood up and picked up the phone.”Hey, old Huang...This is great! I’ve really troubled you this time...Hey, hey, hey, sure! I’ll be in the office ... Okay ... Thank you! Thanks a lot!”

President Lin hung up the phone and said to Xia ruofei with a happy face,””Brother Xia, the results from the herbal research Institute are out. The report will be faxed over immediately!”

After that, President Lin opened the office door and poked his head out to call for old Chinese doctor Huang.

Mr. Lin came to his desk. His fax machine gave out a signal automatically when it rang. After a while, a piece of paper was spat out slowly with a sizzling sound.

President Lin couldn’t wait to pick up the fax paper. He just glanced at it and couldn’t help but open his mouth wide.

Doctor Huang also put on his reading glasses and went over to take a look. His entire person was instantly petrified as he muttered,””This ... This indicator ... This is too abnormal ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and asked curiously,””What’s wrong? Brother Lin, is there a problem with my product?”

President Lin returned to his senses and handed the report to Xia ruofei.””Brother Xia, it’s not that there’s a problem with your product, it’s just that the indicators are too heaven – defying. Old Huang and I are both shocked ... Take a look at the indicators for the Dendrobium Noxus.”

Xia ruofei took a look at the report. The content of Dendrobium sugar was on the top row. Xia ruofei saw it with one look. The number 40.6% was written at the back. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Forty – one percent?” Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”big brother Lin, I’m not too familiar with these things. Is this number very high?”

Master Luo was also shocked when he heard that. He quickly came over to take a look, then couldn’t help rubbing his eyes. After confirming that he didn’t see wrongly, he exclaimed,””Oh my God!”

“Master Luo was also shocked, right?” Mr. Lin smiled and said,”it’s fine if it’s just one sample. Look at the second half of the report. The results of the five samples we sent over are almost the same. The fluctuation is no more than 3%.”

“The quality of the raw materials for boss Xia’s iron – Skin Dendrobium is indeed very, very high,” master Luo scratched his head and said,”but I didn’t expect the final product to be so high. This is really ...”

Xia ruofei was confused. He smiled bitterly and said,””Brother Lin, master Luo, don’t keep me in suspense. I’m the only outsider here. Are you guys playing riddles with me?”

President Lin laughed and said,”brother Xia, the sugar content of Dendrobium is an important indicator of the quality of iron – hide fengdou. The national standard is that the sugar content must be at least 25%. The best iron – hide fengdou on the market can reach about 30% sugar content. Among the few special products in our store, the best can reach 35%, which is the best quality in recent years.”

President Lin glanced at the report in Xia ruofei’s hand and continued,””After the sugar content reaches 35%, it’s already amazing if it doesn’t increase by 0.1%. But you actually increased it by 5%! To be honest, I’ve been in the business for so many years, but I’ve never seen any store that can produce maple dendrobe with a sugar content of more than 40%!”

Master Luo also nodded heavily, agreeing with President Lin’s point of view.

Meanwhile, old Chinese medicine doctor Huang added,””Mr. Xia, your batch of fengdou not only has a high content of dendrobe glucose, but other components such as Dendi alkali, Dendi amine, and so on are also far better than the indicators of our special products. This is really an eye – opener for me!”

Hearing this, Xia ruofei finally let out a relaxed smile and said,””In layman’s terms, this means that the quality of my iron – skinned fengdou is very good?”

“It’s more than just very good!” President Lin immediately said,”it’s simply the best of the best!”
