“No problem!” Gersun immediately replied. Mr. Xia, I can be your tour guide for free, without a salary ...”

Xia ruofei smiled.”You still have to pay me. Not only do I want to tour the county, but I also want to take a look at the place where your father and the others dug the wormgrass!”

“What’s so nice about that place?” Gesang asked in confusion,”it’s just some Hills, and the altitude is high. There’s also the possibility of encountering wolves. If it’s not for digging grass, we locals are not willing to go there.”

Xia ruofei smiled.”I’ve heard about the story of you digging for wormgrass. I’m very interested in this magical land. I want to see it with my own eyes.”

Gesang thought for a moment and said,”no problem. Since Mr. Xia wants to see it, I’ll Take You There.” I’ve been following my father to the mountains to dig for grass since two years ago, so I’m very familiar with that place!” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””If you’re my guide, I’ll pay you 500 yuan a day.”

Gersun quickly waved his hand and said,”no need, no need!” Mr. Xia, you’re willing to buy my family’s Cordyceps, which is already a great help to us. I don’t dare to charge you for leading the way. ”

“Just take it. What’s wrong with you earning money through your labor?” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”besides, I’ve already bought the wormgrass for more than 100000 Yuan. Do you think I’ll be short of a few hundred Yuan? It’s decided!”

Gersun could only nod and said,”alright then!” Thank you, Mr. Xia!”

Xia ruofei patted gersun’s head and said,””Let’s go! Your father is still waiting for you at home!”

Soon, they arrived at gersun’s house.

Xia ruofei looked at the bag of wormgrass again. After weighing it, he happily took out the 176000 Yuan wrapped in a plastic bag.

After the father and son double – checked to make sure there was no mistake, Solang renzeng said happily,””Mr. Xia, thank you for taking care of our business!”

Gesang was also very happy.”That’s great, Mr. Xia. I finally have money to treat my father’s leg. Thank you!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”It’s because your wormgrass is of good quality. It’s a fair trade. There’s no need to thank anyone.”

Gesang scratched his head and laughed.

Then, he immediately remembered Xia ruofei’s matter and quickly explained it to his father in Tibetan.

Solang renzeng also felt that Xia ruofei’s request was a little strange, but this was the privacy of the guests. Since Gesang had agreed, he did not object. A real Tibetan man was a man of his word and was very trustworthy.

Furthermore, in the past few years, Gesang had followed him up the mountain to dig for grass every year. He was very familiar with the terrain in that area and could avoid the general dangers. Solang Ren was not too worried. He only reminded him to bring enough equipment and dry food and to pay attention to safety on the road.

He was worried about Xia ruofei’s safety. After all, Xia ruofei did not look like a tall and strong person. Outsiders would not be able to see the terrifying energy hidden in Xia ruofei’s thin body.

Therefore, suolang renzeng tried to persuade Xia ruofei, but Xia ruofei insisted on going to take a look. He had no choice but to agree.

Gesang immediately went to prepare for the trip. He was still a young man. He did not feel anything when he followed his father up the mountain. This time, he was Xia ruofei’s Guide and it was a completely different feeling.

It was like a Young Eagle finally spreading its wings and flying alone.

Xia ruofei also got up and said goodbye to suo lang renzeng. He had heard from Gesang that the traditional Chinese caterpillar fungus production area was quite far from the county, so he had made an appointment with Gesang to meet at the entrance of the alley. He went to rent a car first.

After finding the only car rental agency in the county, Xia ruofei submitted his driving license and paid the deposit with his card. He successfully got a fully – filled Toyota off – Road vehicle. In the mountainous area of Tibet, off – road vehicles were much more practical than ordinary cars.

When Xia ruofei drove to the alley near Gesang’s house, Gesang was already waiting there with a huge backpack and a bundle of rope on his back. His face was full of excitement, as if he was about to go on an adventure.

Xia ruofei honked twice and Gesang immediately noticed him. He quickly ran over, put the big backpack and rope into the back seat, and then sat in the front seat excitedly.

Under gersun’s guidance, Xia ruofei quickly drove out of the county and headed towards the traditional Chinese caterpillar fungus production area.

Compared to the dangerous Sichuan – Tibet highway, the conditions of the Qingzang Highway were not bad. However, the continuous high altitude would make most foreigners feel a little uncomfortable. Even the locals would feel a little uncomfortable breathing.

However, Xia ruofei was not affected at all. He was driving leisurely and enjoying the beautiful scenery along the way.

At first, gersun was worried that Xia ruofei would suffer from severe altitude sickness and would turn his head to observe his condition from time to time. However, after driving for a while, gersun realized that Xia ruofei did not seem to be affected by the altitude at all. He then heaved a sigh of relief.

In the distance, the top of the mountain was covered with white snow all year round. The lake beside the road was already full of vitality. The beautiful scenery of the plateau, which was almost unpolluted, made Xia ruofei feel relaxed and happy.

Gesang guided Xia ruofei to the foot of a mountain.

The mountain did not look steep, and the slope was relatively flat. However, even the foot of the mountain was more than 4000 meters above sea level, so there was an invisible danger hidden under the seemingly calm appearance.
