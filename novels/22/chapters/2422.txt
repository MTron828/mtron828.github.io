2423 Eye – opening (1)

Hearing this, Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows and became alert.

In fact, the moment Liu chengfeng appeared, Xia ruofei had already sensed the aura of a cultivator from him.

This was completely different from the situation when he saw Manzila at the temple of arulei a few days ago. At that time, Manzila’s cultivation level was quite low, and Xia ruofei did not expect a black man to actually step onto the path of cultivation, so he did not pay attention to him at all.

Facing this middle – aged man with a small beard, Xia ruofei could immediately sense that his cultivation was not low. At least, it was not lower than Li Yifu ‘S. He might even have reached the sixth or seventh Qi layer.

To be able to cultivate to this level in such an environment with such poor spirit Qi on earth, he must be extraordinary.

Xia ruofei looked at Liu chengfeng warily and did not answer his question. Instead, he asked indifferently,””Do you need something?”

Liu chengfeng rolled his eyes and said with a smile,””Fellow Daoist, not long ago, we accidentally lost our sect’s most precious treasure. This time, we senior and junior brothers came out specifically to look for it, but we didn’t expect that fellow Daoist would pick it up. Fellow Daoist, please return this treasure to Zhao. Our falling leaves sect will definitely reward you greatly!”

Liu chengfeng had obviously taken a fancy to the crystal in Xia ruofei’s hand. He had even deliberately pointed out that Xia ruofei had come with his fellow apprentices and conveniently mentioned his own sect. If it was an ordinary individual cultivator, most of them would not dare to provoke the falling leaves sect. They might even swallow their anger and admit that they were unlucky, handing over the treasure.

If the other party also had a sect and was on par with the falling leaves sect, they would definitely report their sect. At that time, Liu chengfeng would weigh the situation and at worst, say that it was a misunderstanding.

However, Liu chengfeng didn’t expect that the person in front of him knew nothing about the current cultivation world. Xia ruofei of the fallen leaf sect and the floating leaf sect didn’t know anything about it, let alone intimidate him with this.

Hearing this, Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment. Then, a playful smile appeared on his face. He waved the origin crystal in his hand and asked,””You mean this?”

The smile on Liu chengfeng’s face was extremely sincere. He said,””Of course! Fellow Daoist, this is our Fallen Leaf sect’s most precious inheritance treasure, how could I be wrong?”

As Liu chengfeng spoke, he took a few steps closer to Xia ruofei.

He was very envious of this treasure and had long wanted to take it by force. Thus, he had intentionally or unintentionally blocked Xia ruofei’s escape route in advance.

Xia ruofei asked with a faint smile,”since you say it’s yours, then tell me, what’s the name of this treasure?” What’s its magical effect?”

Liu chengfeng lied without hesitation,””This item is called the spirit accumulation Pearl. It will take the initiative to absorb the spiritual Qi of heaven and earth, and it has a great auxiliary effect for cultivation. Of course, the spirit accumulation Pearl has some other wonderful uses, but that’s our Fallen Leaf sect’s Secret, so there’s no need to tell others ...”

Xia ruofei was both angry and amused. This was the first time he had met a strange cultivator. At first, he was curious about the cultivators that might exist on earth. He did not expect to meet them in person after hearing about them. When cultivators were shameless, they were even more shameless than ordinary people!

In addition, modern cultivators seemed to have very ordinary vision! It was clearly just a piece of origin crystal, yet he actually couldn’t recognize it, and even forcefully called a cultivation – aiding consumable a spirit accumulation Pearl, and even said it so clearly and logically.

Xia ruofei was also speechless. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Liu chengfeng took the opportunity to take a few steps closer and said,””Fellow Daoist, the world’s most precious treasures belong to the virtuous. This is a treasure of my fallen leaves sect. Fellow Daoist, please return it to its original owner, otherwise it may bring disaster to fellow Daoist!”

Liu chengfeng’s words were full of threat.

Xia ruofei took a step back and said,””If you go any further, I’m going to crush this so – called spirit accumulation Pearl!”

Liu chengfeng immediately stopped and pressed his hands down.””Fellow Daoist, don’t be rash! Don’t be rash! We can discuss this ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”is this a discussion?” It’s clearly mine, but you’re actually so calm and composed. You’re twisting the truth in front of me, how is this different from a Bandit? Could it be that your fallen leaves sect is a den of bandits?”

“Impudent!” Liu chengfeng tore off his hypocritical mask and said fiercely,”you dare to insult my sect? you’re dead! I advise you to obediently hand over the treasure with both hands and I might spare your life!”

Xia ruofei’s face was filled with mockery. He tossed the origin crystal in his hand and said,””Isn’t that right? If you want the origin crystals in my hands, just say it! Why do you need to go through such a big round?”

Liu chengfeng’s expression changed slightly. He couldn’t help but widen his eyes and mumble to himself,””These are origin crystals? There are still origin crystals in the cultivation world?”

It wasn’t that Liu chengfeng didn’t know about origin crystals. It was just that they were legendary top – grade supplementary resources. The fallen leaves sect was considered a considerable force in the modern cultivation world. However, in the past few decades, the fallen leaves sect only had one spiritual crystal, not to mention origin crystals. This only spiritual crystal was naturally in the sect leader’s possession.

Even the sect master treated this spiritual crystal as a family heirloom and was reluctant to use it for cultivation.

If spirit crystals could enjoy such treatment, then origin crystals, which were a grade higher than spirit crystals, were even more so.

Liu chengfeng had never seen what a real origin crystal looked like.

At this moment, his heart was in turmoil,”it’s actually origin crystals ... I was wondering what kind of treasure could have such dense spiritual energy!” I can’t believe I, Liu chengfeng, have such luck! After obtaining this origin crystal, there was hope for him to reach the Golden core stage in this life!

Xia ruofei looked at Liu chengfeng, who did not even bother to hide his greed, and sneered,””Didn’t you just say that this is some spirit accumulation bead?”

“Cut the crap!” Liu chengfeng was furious. Hand over the origin crystals obediently, and I’ll spare your dog life! Do you think you’re worthy of such a treasure?”

Xia ruofei’s “great Dao scroll” was special, and his spiritual power cultivation had crossed a large realm, reaching the spirit gathering realm. Therefore, Liu chengfeng’s sense of Xia ruofei’s cultivation was somewhat vague. However, Xia ruofei looked so young. Although cultivators often looked younger than their actual age, it was rare to see someone this young.

Hence, Liu chengfeng subconsciously assumed that Xia ruofei’s cultivation level was not very high. Even if Xia ruofei had a treasure like the origin crystal, Liu chengfeng was confident that with his seventh Qi layer cultivation, he could definitely defeat him.

Liu chengfeng then sneered and said,””If you didn’t say that these are origin crystals, I would still be a little afraid, afraid that you would really destroy the treasure in your desperation. But since they’re origin crystals, there’s nothing to be afraid of ...”

The origin crystal was indestructible, and Qi refining cultivators couldn’t destroy it at all, so Liu chengfeng naturally didn’t have to be cautious.

After saying this, Liu chengfeng let out a soft cry and used his spiritual power to suppress Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei only felt a little dizzy. The spiritual power in his sea of consciousness immediately trembled and actively resolved the discomfort.

Xia ruofei looked interested and said to himself,””Eh? Spiritual power can be used in this way?”

Xia ruofei’s current cultivation was close to refined Qi level 9. His spiritual power had broken through a major realm and reached the spirit gathering realm. However, he was still lacking in combat experience.

Of course, the battle experience here referred to the battle between cultivators.

In addition, the ‘great Dao Arts’ was a cultivation technique that pointed straight to the end. It did not involve any specific battle techniques, cultivation methods, or battle skills. Because in the eyes of the Almighty who created this cultivation method, the Qi refining stage was only the stage to lay the foundation. At this stage, what the cultivators needed to do was not to fight, but to constantly lay a solid foundation. The more solid the foundation, the longer the road of cultivation could be.

However, this had also caused Xia ruofei to be very careless in the use of his genuine Qi and mental energy.

For example, in terms of spiritual power, Xia ruofei only knew how to use spiritual power to hypnotize people. This was only a small trick. Xia ruofei did not know how to use spiritual power in a real battle.

Liu chengfeng’s spiritual power attack had opened a door for Xia ruofei.

Liu chengfeng’s spiritual power wasn’t very high. It was probably at the spirit throb stage, equivalent to a cultivator at the fifth or sixth Qi layer. However, his use of spiritual power was much more refined than Xia ruofei ‘s.

Xia ruofei thought to himself,”I didn’t know that the use of spiritual power could be so exquisite. Several strands of spiritual power can actually produce such a great amplification effect by arranging and combining them ... The path of cultivation is indeed vast and profound. There is no end to learning!”

Xia ruofei was subconsciously analyzing Liu chengfeng’s spiritual power attack and rehearsing it in his mind. His spiritual power had always been much stronger than Liu chengfeng ‘s, so Liu chengfeng’s spiritual power attacks were no secret to him.

After Liu chengfeng released his spiritual pressure, he saw Xia ruofei mumble something to himself and then fall into a daze.

He didn’t know that Xia ruofei was just excited. He thought that the spiritual intimidation had taken effect and caused Xia ruofei to fall into a dazed state.

This was an opportunity that could not be missed! Liu chengfeng’s mind flashed with an idea, and he immediately moved forward and slapped Xia ruofei.

Liu chengfeng didn’t hold back in this attack. He poured genuine Qi into his palm and with a strong wind, he attacked Xia ruofei as fast as lightning.

At this moment, Xia ruofei glanced at Liu chengfeng from the corner of his eye. Then, he tried to copy Liu chengfeng’s method and released his spiritual power to cover Liu chengfeng.

When the spiritual power came out of his body, Xia ruofei could feel that his spiritual attack had doubled! In other words, Xia ruofei’s spiritual attack power had doubled through a simple arrangement.

Of course, this was not a simple arrangement. In theory, there could be countless combinations of spiritual power combat techniques, and most of these countless combinations would definitely have no effect, and might even affect the normal effect. Only a few combinations could have an amplification effect.

These combinations were naturally discovered by generations of cultivators. If Xia ruofei were to experiment bit by bit, he might not be able to find a spiritual power combat skill that could double the spiritual power even after a long time.

Liu chengfeng’s eyes were filled with passion and greed as he attacked Xia ruofei.

He could almost see his cultivation advancing by leaps and bounds after he obtained this origin crystal.

However, just as Xia ruofei glanced at Liu chengfeng indifferently, he suddenly felt a buzzing sound in his head. The next moment, a powerful spiritual pressure suddenly enveloped him ...
