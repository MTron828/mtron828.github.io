Translator: 549690339

Song Wei’s words made everyone laugh. However, everyone had a tacit understanding when they took their seats. Basically, they took their seats according to their fathers ‘ranks.

After everyone had taken their seats, Song Wei smiled and introduced,””All of you here today are my good friends. I’d like to introduce you to my friend. His name is Xia ruofei. Unlike me, he’s a native of the three mountains!”

Xia ruofei stood up and smiled at everyone.

He knew that those who could come today were either rich or powerful, but he was also someone who had seen big occasions. Not to mention that he was neither humble nor arrogant in front of elder song, just the children of the ministers who drank and chatted with him in the capital were the targets of these young masters and young ladies today, so he naturally did not have stage fright at all.

After introducing Xia ruofei, Song Wei started to introduce the friends she had invited to Xia ruofei.

As Xia ruofei had guessed, these people’s fathers were all leaders of Sanshan city and even the southeast province. This included the leaders of Sanshan city, the leaders of the provincial government’s organizing committee, the leaders of the provincial government’s publicity department, the leaders of the provincial capital administration, and so on.

Every time Song Wei introduced a person, Xia ruofei would smile and nod in acknowledgment. He was very generous.

After the introduction, Song Wei smiled and raised her glass,””Alright, now that we all know each other, let’s have a drink together!”

Everyone agreed with Song Wei’s suggestion and raised their glasses.

After putting down the wine glass, someone couldn’t hold back his curiosity and asked with a smile,””Sister Song, your friend looks a little unfamiliar. Where does he work?”

Xia ruofei glanced at the man. He remembered that his name was Liu Zhe. If he remembered correctly, his father should be the executive Deputy Director of the provincial state – owned assets Control Commission.

Of course, with Xia ruofei’s current spiritual power cultivation, his mind was much smarter than ordinary people. Song Wei had just introduced the names and backgrounds of these ten people, so he would not be mistaken.

“Ruofei started his own company and his business is getting bigger and bigger. He’s a Big Boss now!” Song Wei laughed.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Hi!” Aren’t you making fun of me? It’s just a small fight, a small fight ...”

“That’s just a small fight!”Song Wei said with a smile. I’ve heard that you’ve taken a fancy to a siheyuan in the capital this time. That’s more than a hundred million Yuan! He didn’t even blink and bought it in full!”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment. He couldn’t help but look at Lu You, thinking that this little traitor must have said something wrong!

He laughed and said,”who said so?” I didn’t know how many times I blinked, but my heart ached! But who asked me to like that house? Even if I have to sell everything I have, I have to buy it!”

“Stop pretending to be poor ...” Song Wei smiled and said,”don’t worry!” No one here is borrowing money from you!”

“Hehe ...”

Everyone saw that Song Wei did not introduce Xia ruofei’s father and knew that Xia ruofei was just a businessman. They could not help but look down on him.

Of course, since Song Wei had invited everyone to meet Xia ruofei, they would not show their contempt on their faces.

Liu Zhe, who had asked Song Wei a question, only smiled and said,”It seems that brother Xia’s business is very big!”

“Sister Weiwei,” Lu You said,”Xia ruofei has another identity. You forgot to mention it!”

“Is that so?” Song Wei was stunned for a moment.”Then tell me ...”

Lu You cleared her throat and said,”not only did Xia ruofei start a company, but he’s also a highly – skilled doctor!” To be more precise, he’s a highly skilled Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioner!”

Song Wei slapped her forehead and smiled,”Right, right, right, how could I have forgotten about this! Once again, I’d like to solemnly introduce to everyone that RUO Fei’s medical skills are quite amazing! If he were to open a clinic, his business would definitely be more popular than a company!”

Everyone didn’t know whether to laugh or cry when they heard this.

He had thought that Lu You was going to reveal Xia ruofei’s identity and background! In the end, a doctor came with a new identity.

Although the first identity made everyone look down on him, a successful businessman should at least be rich!

What’s with the doctor? Everyone in the room knew a few experts and professors.

At this time, a girl in her 20s sitting next to Liu Zhe said with a smile,””Brother Xia, I heard that Chinese medicine is more popular with the older you are! You’re so young ...”

“Shi gan ...” Song Wei furrowed her eyebrows.

Xia ruofei waved his hand at Song Wei and interrupted her. Then, he smiled at the girl called Shi Yang and said,”This must be the daughter of Secretary Shi of the municipal Party Committee!”

Xia ruofei could tell that the fathers of the friends that Song Wei had invited today must be close to song Qiming in politics. If they were leaders who did not agree with song Qiming, Song Wei would not have invited them.

For example, Shi Yang’s father was the head secretary of the municipal Party Committee. He was definitely the right – hand man of song Qiming, the Secretary of the municipal government.

Hence, Xia ruofei did not want to affect the relationship between Song Wei and them.

The stone puppet laughed and said,”Brother Xia really has a good memory!”

Xia ruofei smiled gently and said,””You just said that the older the Chinese medicine, the more popular it is. To a certain extent, it makes sense. It’s fundamentally different from Western medicine, which focuses on the balance of yin and yang and comprehensive treatment. It doesn’t have as many instruments and devices as Western medicine, so it requires a lot of experience. ”

At this point, Xia ruofei paused and scanned everyone’s faces with confidence. Then, he continued,””This kind of experience can only be obtained after a large number of cases and a large amount of time. That’s why Chinese medicine is more popular with older people!”

Then, Xia ruofei immediately changed the topic. He smiled and said,””But! But what I want to say is ... We still have to allow geniuses to exist!”

Hearing this, the stone puppet burst into laughter and said,”Brother Xia, you mean ... You’re a genius!”

“Don’t do personal worship!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

The young masters and young ladies burst into laughter.

In fact, Xia ruofei had left a good impression on them. If it was an ordinary person in front of so many children of the leaders, they would be very reserved. However, Xia ruofei was always calm and composed. He was neither humble nor arrogant. At the same time, his attitude was very gentle. He even joked with Shi Yang.

Shi Yang had a carefree personality and would not be angry with Xia ruofei.

She only glanced at Xia ruofei and smiled.””Brother Xia, you can’t sell melons like this! You’re so capable, why don’t you show us what you’ve got?”

Song Wei couldn’t help but say,”Shi gan, stop it!” RUO Fei’s medical skills are for saving lives, not for show!”

Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand.”It’s okay, Song Wei. Since we’re all your good friends today, let’s do a volunteer medical consultation!”

Xia ruofei’s eyes fell on Shi Yang’s face. He smiled and asked,””Shi Xiao, this idea was your idea, why don’t you go first?” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Shi Xiao immediately said,”I’ll go first!” How? Don’t we need to check her pulse first?”

Xia ruofei leaned back in her chair and crossed her arms in front of her chest. She said calmly,””Traditional Chinese Medicine focuses on looking, listening, asking, and touching. I’ll show you my skills in the ‘Wang’ word first!”

“What do you mean?” asked the stone puppet, confused.

Lu You looked at Xia ruofei and said,””What he means is that he doesn’t need to take your pulse. He just needs to look at you to know if there’s anything wrong with your body! Is this what you mean, Xia ruofei?”

Xia ruofei snapped his fingers and said,””Correct!”

Everyone could not help but look at each other, thinking that this was too unreliable. Even those white – bearded old Chinese medical doctors had to take a long time to check her pulse! Xia ruofei could tell what illness a person had with just one look? Why didn’t he go to heaven?

However, Xia ruofei had already said it. Wasn’t he afraid of being embarrassed?

Among the people present, only Song Wei and Lu You had full confidence in Xia ruofei. They had personally witnessed Xia ruofei’s magical medical skills.

“Is it really that godly?” the stone puppet asked, its eyes wide open.

Then, she sat up straight, puffed out her chest, and said,””Then you see! I’d like to see what you can figure out!”

Xia ruofei glanced at the stone puppet and smiled.””You don’t have to sit so straight! I’m not a CT scan machine. If the posture is wrong, I won’t be able to detect it ...”

The stone puppet couldn’t help but burst out laughing again,”Brother Xia, I realized that you’re really poor!”

“Then I’ll give you something that’s not poor!” Xia ruofei said,”let me tell you about your physical condition! Are you mentally prepared?”
