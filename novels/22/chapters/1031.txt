......

Xue Jinshan was very efficient. He called Xia ruofei at around 10 in the morning and told him that everything was ready.

Xia ruofei had finished his lunch early and informed Hu Zi’s mother. He then left the farm and drove straight to the pharmaceutical factory.

When Xia ruofei arrived at the heart – nourishing soup production workshop, Xue Jinshan was already waiting at the door.

Before Xia ruofei could get out of the car, Xue Jinshan quickly walked up to him and opened the door for Xia ruofei. He said,”Director Xia, the production line and medicinal ingredients are ready!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”thanks for your hard work, Kanayama!” Let’s go in and talk!”

Xia ruofei and Xue Jinshan went to the production workshop. The two production lines were located in two separate sterile factories. One of the factories was still producing in full swing, while the other was quiet.

Xia ruofei came to the control room. The veteran on duty today was called Liu Lin. When he saw Xia ruofei, he immediately stood at attention and shouted,””Brother Xia, you’re here!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”Liu Lin, take your brothers outside to relax!” I’ll look after this. ”

“Yes!” Liu Lin immediately replied.

He knew that Xia ruofei was going to do something to the control computer. For these veterans who had the confidentiality regulations carved into their bones, they naturally knew what it meant to “not see what they shouldn’t see”. So, he immediately left the control room with the other two veterans.

Seeing this, Xue Jinshan was also preparing to leave the control room. Xia ruofei stopped him and said,”Kanayama, take a few employees with you to process the herbs!”

Xia ruofei gave him the names of a few medicinal ingredients and told him about the preparation method. Then, Xue Jinshan left the control room with his men.

Xia ruofei went over to the control room and locked the door. Then, he blocked the surveillance camera. The camera was aimed at the control computer. Usually, there would be veterans who would monitor it 24 hours a day. Now that Xia ruofei was going to design the program of the production line, he naturally had to block the camera.

After that, Xia ruofei took out the step – by – Step flow chart and data parameters that he had worked on last night. He created a new control process on the control computer.

The entire production process had been simulated in Xia ruofei’s mind countless times, so he was very familiar with the settings.

Of course, after the breakdown and optimization of the jaded skin cream, the brewing process was very complicated. It involved the time, temperature, and other parameters. Every step and every parameter had to be manually entered and checked repeatedly. So even though Xia ruofei was very familiar with it, it still took a lot of time.

The control room was quiet, with only the clicking of the mouse and the tapping of the keyboard. Time passed by quietly.

It was not until four in the afternoon that Xia ruofei finally massaged his sore wrist and let out a long sigh.

After half an afternoon of hard work, he finally converted all the theoretical steps he had constructed into lines of code in the control computer. Of course, the code was modular and Xia ruofei did not have to type it out one by one.

Xia ruofei followed the flow chart that he had drawn and checked the parameters from the beginning to the end. After confirming that there were no mistakes, he sealed it and stored it. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Then he stood up and opened the door of the control room. He looked out and shouted,””Jin Shan, come here!”
