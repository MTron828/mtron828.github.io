Chapter 327: Qingxue is here (1)

Xia ruofei drank with Liang Qichao until two in the afternoon before leaving. Liang Qichao found a substitute driver for Xia ruofei. When the driver arrived at the immortal meat stall, he almost drooled when he saw Knight XV. When he heard that this limited – edition monster – Level off – Road vehicle was his driver, his eyes lit up. He repeatedly said that this ride was free, and that it would be enough as long as he could satisfy his driving addiction. Xia ruofei got into the car and sat in the front passenger seat. After fastening his seat belt, he waved goodbye to Liang Qichao. Then, the substitute driver started the Knight XV off – Road vehicle with an excited face. Looking at the driver’s condition, Xia ruofei could not help but worry. He quickly reminded him to drive carefully. Along the way, the designated driver kept saying that he had been a designated driver for two or three years and had driven many luxury cars, but this was the first time he had encountered Knight XV. He kept saying that he was lucky. Xia ruofei was a little tipsy and only responded to him with a few words. Soon, the car arrived at Taoyuan farm. The designated driver insisted on not charging, so Xia ruofei could only smile and express his gratitude. The traffic at Taoyuan farm was not very convenient. Xia ruofei had wanted ye Lingyun to drive the designated driver to the intersection, but li Zhifu was giving ye Lingyun a lecture. Hence, Xia ruofei called pang Hao over and asked him to drive the designated driver to the National Highway outside the farm. There were still many buses passing by there, so it would not be a problem to return to the Urban area. Pang Hao had just gotten his driver’s license not long ago and was still addicted to driving, so he took his car keys excitedly, got into the pickup truck, and left the villa with the designated driver. Xia ruofei looked at the old and the young sitting in the courtyard of the villa. The spring afternoon’s warm sun shone on them. Lightning was also lazily lying by ye Lingyun’s feet. Li Zhifu was explaining the tea – making skills non – stop while ye Lingyun was listening attentively. From time to time, he would take notes in his notebook. It was a very harmonious and warm scene. Xia ruofei did not go over to disturb them. He walked straight into the villa. He had drunk a small pound of white wine in the afternoon. At this time, he felt a little dizzy and was ready to go back to his room to take an afternoon nap. Just as Xia ruofei entered the villa, he heard the sound of an engine behind him. Xia ruofei did not need to turn around to know that it was the sound of a Porsche 911 engine. He turned around with a face full of joy. Sure enough, an orange car flashed by, and the Porsche 911 stopped steadily next to the Knight XV. It was as if a delicate woman was standing next to a muscular man. “Qingxue!” Xia ruofei happily took two steps forward and greeted him. The smile on Ling Qingxue’s face gradually spread. She turned around, closed the car door, and walked towards Xia ruofei. After seeing ye Lingyun, Ling Qingxue first greeted him, then walked towards Xia ruofei step by step, smiling at him. Xia ruofei chuckled and said,””Come in, come in ...” With that, Xia ruofei reached out to hold Ling Qingxue’s hand. However, Ling Qingxue dodged it cleverly and smiled at Xia ruofei mischievously. Then, she flashed past Xia ruofei and entered the villa first. Xia ruofei felt a fragrant breeze and could not help but think of the last time the two of them were in Ling Qingxue’s boudoir in the Linjiang villa. He could not help but feel a rush of excitement. He quickly followed. As soon as they entered the house, Xia ruofei could not help but hug Ling Qingxue’s slender waist tightly from behind. He buried his head in Ling Qingxue’s fragrant hair and took a deep breath greedily. Xia ruofei’s breath made Ling Qingxue’s neck itch. She couldn’t help but giggle and twist her body. She said coyly, “Don’t mess around ...” “Wife, I’ve missed you so much ...” Xia ruofei said with a chuckle. As he spoke, he held Ling Qingxue’s hand and led her upstairs. Ling Qingxue smiled and tried to pull her hand back. She said,””Why are you going upstairs? I have something to talk to you about!” “Let’s go back to the room and talk!” Xia ruofei held onto Ling Qingxue’s hands tightly and said,”don’t disturb Ling Yun’s class.” Ling Qingxue had also noticed ye Lingyun and Li Zhifu. After hearing Xia ruofei’s words, she couldn’t help but ask curiously,””Class? What class? That old man is the teacher you found for ye linyun? What does he teach?” Xia ruofei held Ling Qingxue’s hand as they walked up the stairs. He smiled and said,””That old man is a tea master and is very famous on Mount Wu Yi! If he were to personally produce ordinary Da Hong Pao tea leaves, the value of the tea leaves would be doubled!” “So powerful!” Ling Qingxue asked,”you want ye Lingyun to have tea with this old man?” “Yup!” Xia ruofei said,”after he learns it, I’ll have a free tea – making master! Moreover, he’s an expert from a famous sect, hehe ...” Ling Qingxue rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei and said,””Unscrupulous merchant ...” At this moment, Ling Qingxue realized that the two of them had unknowingly arrived at the door of Xia ruofei’s bedroom. She could not help but reveal a trace of nervousness and shyness on her face. Xia ruofei opened the door and walked into the bedroom with Ling Qingxue in his arms. Then, he turned around and locked the door. He turned around and hugged Ling Qingxue tightly. Ling Qingxue moaned and weakly struggled for a bit, then said in a low voice,””Ruofei, don’t mess around! I have something to talk to you about ... My dad ... My dad’s acquisition of the winery is almost done. He ... He asked me to bring the contract over for you to sign ...” As Ling Qingxue spoke, she reached into her bag. Xia ruofei grabbed Ling Qingxue’s small hand in an overbearing manner. He stared at Ling Qingxue’s beautiful face with a burning gaze and said,””There’s no hurry to sign the contract. Let’s get down to business first ...” Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but feel embarrassed. Before she came, she had already vaguely sensed that something was going to happen. In her heart, she had also been looking forward to it. At first, Ling Qingxue shyly avoided Xia ruofei’s gaze, but very quickly, she bravely met Xia ruofei’s eyes. The sparks of love bloomed between their eyes. Xia ruofei couldn’t take it anymore. He lowered his head and kissed her deeply ...
