Xia ruofei waved his right hand and the eight small flags flew accurately in eight different directions. They even directly stabbed into the hard stone ground.

At the most critical moment, Xia ruofei had a flash of inspiration and thought of using a time formation.

His own understanding of array Dao had already reached a very high level. In addition, the operation of these array flags was not complicated. With the help of his powerful spiritual power, setting up an array was something that could be done in an instant.

The moment all the array flags were in place, Xia ruofei immediately saw Song Wei, who was flying towards him, slow down. He could not see her figure and movement trajectory at first, but now, she was as slow as a movie.

Xia ruofei had set up a time – slowing formation.

Moreover, he had tried his best to reduce the range of the array. This array only covered a small area where he was, so the effect was almost maximized. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Now, the time inside the formation was at least 80 to 90 times slower than outside. In other words, a second inside the formation was equivalent to one to two minutes outside. Hence, no matter how fast the spiritual body that was occupying Song Wei’s body was, it was as slow as a snail in Xia ruofei’s eyes.

Xia ruofei could not be bothered to use the petals of the spirit Heart Flower to heal his injuries. He immediately took out the gun from the spirit map space, aimed at Song Wei’s knee, and fired a shot.

When the spiritual body saw Xia ruofei throw out the array flag, she did not pay much attention to it at first. However, when the array flag returned to its position, she suddenly realized that Xia ruofei’s movements had become many times faster. With her cultivation level, she could only see an afterimage. She could not help but be shocked.

Following the sound of a gunshot, the spirit body did not think twice and accelerated to Dodge.

However, Xia ruofei had already predicted the spirit body’s movement when he fired the shot. In his eyes, the spirit body was moving very slowly. It was not difficult to predict its movement and direction.

Therefore, it would have been fine if the spirit did not Dodge. Once it dodged, it was as if it had sent itself to the front of the bullet. The bullet accurately hit song Wei’s knee.

The Spirit’s speed slowed down. Even though the bullet did not have the lethal effect that Xia ruofei had expected due to her powerful cultivation, it still caused her kneecaps to be injured from the shock. After all, this was an ordinary person’s body. It was not as strong as the Spirit’s body when it was alive.

As a result, the spirit body’s speed was even more affected.

Furthermore, she was extremely furious. She looked at Xia ruofei with undisguised killing intent.

Xia ruofei did not give the spirit a chance to catch his breath. He kept firing and the spirit tried his best to Dodge. However, Xia ruofei had the advantage with the help of the time formation. No matter if it was the speed of firing, the speed of turning the gun, or the prediction of the trajectory, they were all beyond the Spirit’s imagination.

In just a short while, the spirit body had been shot several times. Under Xia ruofei’s control, the shots were all aimed at the hands, feet, lower abdomen, and other parts of the body. In addition, the spirit body had a strong cultivation so it did not cause any serious injuries. However, this still caused a lot of trouble for the spirit body. She could not get close to Xia ruofei for a while.

After all, she had not reached the level where she was invulnerable. She still had to Dodge Xia ruofei’s shots. Every time she was close to Xia ruofei, she would be forced back by Xia ruofei’s shots.

The spirit body suddenly stopped and said coldly,””It seems like you don’t care about your friend’s body ...”

Xia ruofei stared into the Spirit’s eyes and said,””If you leave, I’ll naturally stop the attack!”

The spirit body sneered.”I’ve waited 200 years for a suitable body. You want me to leave just because you want me to?” it said.

“Then I’ll beat you up until you leave!” Xia ruofei snorted.

The spirit body laughed and said,”little guy, do you really think I’m afraid?” I don’t mind telling you, if you use that strange hidden weapon to attack me again, I won’t Dodge or resist. At most, this body will be destroyed, and I won’t lose anything, just wait a few more days! But I’m afraid your friend ...”

“You don’t need to worry about this!” Xia ruofei said coldly.

Then, he raised his gun again and fired another shot at Song Wei’s body without hesitation.

At this time, the spirit body had already retreated to a relatively far position. She should have had time to react, but as she said, she did not Dodge at all. With a playful smile on her face, she stood on the spot and took the shot.

This time, Xia ruofei aimed at her leg. After the gunshot, Xia ruofei’s eyes narrowed. He saw that the spirit did not have any luck to resist. Song Wei’s calf was hit by the bullet. A bloody hole appeared and blood started to flow.

Xia ruofei’s heart trembled. Although he had always wanted to hurt the spirit, he could not help but tremble when he saw Song Wei’s body bleeding.

At this time, Song Wei’s mouth revealed a mocking smile and said,””I won’t stand still next time ...”

Xia ruofei did not understand, but what the other party said next made his expression change.

Because the spirit body said,”I’ll put the vital parts on it, like here ...”

The spirit body pointed at Song Wei’s heart and said jokingly,””If this place is hit by your hidden weapon, do you think your friend will still be alive?”
