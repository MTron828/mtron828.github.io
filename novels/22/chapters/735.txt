Chapter 736: The “conspiracy” has succeeded (3)

Liang Weimin shrugged and said,”the country’s regulations are like this. Even if the Father were to transfer the ownership to the son, it would cost at least ten to twenty thousand Yuan!” It’s even higher in your case ...”

When Hu ‘er’s mother heard this, she felt at a loss.

Seeing this, Xia ruofei stepped out and said,””Auntie, if you really don’t want it, then we can do as you said and transfer it to me after the deed is done. This 230000 Yuan ... Just take it as my contribution to the country’s tax collection!”

Xia ruofei’s method of retreating to advance was quite effective. Hu Zi’s mother immediately said,””No! I can’t waste this money anymore! That’s more than two hundred thousand ...”

Xia ruofei chuckled and shrugged.””Then I have no other choice ...”

Then, Xia ruofei said seriously,””Auntie, Qiao’ er, this is really just a token of my appreciation. You don’t have to think too much about it. It didn’t matter whose name was written on the property ownership certificate. Although your living conditions have improved a lot, you’re still renting a house, and ... Qiao’ er, you’re going to university soon. Can you bear to see Auntie still living in a rented house? Besides, as you know, I’m pretty well – off now, and it’s very easy for me to buy a house like this. It’s even as easy as lifting a finger, so ... Auntie, just take it as me being filial to Hu Zi!”

Xia ruofei’s words were very sincere. Even Liang Weimin couldn’t help but be moved.

Hu ‘Zi’s mother’s eyes were also red.”Ruofei, I know you’re a good kid, but this house is too expensive ...”

“Auntie, how about this?” Xia ruofei said,”we’ve already bought this house. Besides, it will cost a lot of money to transfer the ownership. It’s a waste to leave it idle. Why don’t you move in after the renovation is done? if you really don’t want to accept it, you can at least wait five years later?” By the time Qiao’ er graduates from University, she should have gradually become financially capable. In addition, the cost of transferring houses that are more than five years old won’t be so high anymore. ”

Liang Weimin promptly said,”that’s right. In a second – hand house transaction, a house that has been sold for five years can enjoy a business tax discount. You only need to pay the remaining amount. You’re also exempted from personal income tax. You can get a lot cheaper.”

Since Xia ruofei had already said this, Hu Zi’s mother and Lin Qiao exchanged glances and finally nodded helplessly.

Xia ruofei cheered in his heart and clenched his fists.

His painstaking arrangements finally paid off. Hu Zi’s mother and Lin Qiao finally accepted the house.

......

As for the so – called transfer after five years, it was just Xia ruofei’s stalling tactic. When the time came, he would naturally have all kinds of ways to avoid it.

“Uncle Liang, I’ll have to trouble you with the renovation!” Xia ruofei said happily,”today’s proposal was very good. I’ll have to trouble your designer for the subsequent adjustments.”

“Don’t worry! Leave it to me!” Liang Weimin was also very happy.”I’ll get them to adjust the design drafts as soon as possible. When the time comes ...”

“When the time comes, just give it to Qiao’ er. As long as she and Auntie are satisfied, we can start work!” Xia ruofei said directly.

“Alright!”

At this time, Hu Zi’s mother could not help but ask,””Ruofei, the renovation cost for such a big house must be quite high, right?”

When Lin Qiao was looking at the renovation plan just now, Hu Zi’s mother also took a few glances at it. She felt that the design was quite high – end and could tell that the cost was high, so she couldn’t help but ask.

Xia ruofei replied without thinking,”uncle Liang will give us a big discount.” Besides, this house had to be renovated after buying it! At most, I’ll pay for it in advance, and you can return it to me when Qiao’ er earns money in the future!” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Lin Qiao bit her lower lip and said in a low voice,””Brother ruofei, thank you ...”

“Silly girl! Why are you treating me like an outsider?” Xia ruofei rubbed Lin Qiao’s hair affectionately.”Qiao’ er, you’re very talented in design. After uncle Liang’s designer’s proposal is out, you can take a good look at it yourself. If you have any good ideas, you can let the designer make adjustments. Anyway, this house is for you and Auntie to live in. You must renovate it according to your ideal look. Don’t be afraid of spending money, understand?”

Lin Qiao’s eyes were a little wet, and she nodded heavily.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”let’s go!” I still have to buy books later! Oh right, since Qiao’ er is here today, go and sign those few papers! Uncle Liang has already started to get the property certificate!”
