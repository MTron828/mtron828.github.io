2978 Full of confidence (1)

When Wu Ming, who was sitting beside Luo Feng, heard this, he opened his mouth and wanted to speak without thinking.

However, Luo Feng waved his hand to stop him.

Luo Feng gave Wu Ming a look and then said in a clear voice,”If fellow Daoist Xia has a way to prove the authenticity of your handwritten copy, then go ahead and prove it. Our spirit Vulture mountain will be happy to see it happen. Why do you want to make a bet for no reason? Fellow Daoist Xia, please don’t try to change the subject!”

Luo Feng’s thoughts were very simple. Now that they had the absolute upper hand, as long as there were no changes, the cultivators who came to the auction would probably take a wait – and – see attitude because of their doubts. Therefore, he didn’t want any accidents to happen at this time and didn’t accept Xia ruofei’s bet at all.

To put it bluntly, it was to respond to changes by staying the same.

Luo Feng knew Wu Ming’s character too well, so he stopped Wu Ming from speaking in time. Otherwise, Xia ruofei might really have “succeeded”.

Xia ruofei smiled with confidence and said,””It seems that even though elder Luo’s words are true, you know that there’s no problem with the glittering jewel true understanding of our star Seizer sect. Since elder Luo doesn’t dare to bet, then forget it!”

Luo Feng didn’t say anything, but he didn’t stop Wu Ming.

Wu Ming’s stomach was already filled with anger. How could he stand Xia ruofei’s mockery?

He suddenly stood up and shouted,””Who said we don’t dare to bet? You say it! How do we bet?”

Luo Feng stomped his feet and sighed. With a helpless expression, he said in a low voice,”Young sect leader Wu, the people of the star Seizer sect clearly dug a hole for us to jump into! We’ve already taken the absolute cold, why bother with creating more trouble?”

Wu Ming said coldly,”uncle Feng, I don’t beat around the bush like you!” I knew it, the other party has been provoking us all this time, they’re about to ride on our necks and shit! If he kept dodging, what was the difference between him and a cowardly turtle? Besides, I’m just a little impatient, I’m not stupid! What did it matter if she heard what he wanted to bet? If it’s really outrageous, it won’t be too late for us to refuse!”

Luo Feng thought about it and realized that it made sense.

Moreover, Wu Ming had already said what he wanted to say. If he took it back now, wouldn’t he be slapping his own face?

At this moment, Xia ruofei, who was in room 20, asked loudly,””What is elder Luo’s opinion? Whose orders does the spirit Vulture mountain listen to? It’s making us very troubled ...”

Luo Feng’s expression turned cold and he said indifferently,””If fellow Daoist Xia only wants to drive a wedge between our spirit Vulture mountain, I’m afraid you’re being a villain in vain. The opinion of young sect leader Wu naturally represents the opinion of the entire spirit Vulture mountain.”

“Hahaha! Then I’ll talk about the bet. ” Xia ruofei smiled nonchalantly and said,”it’s simple. I’ll put forward a plan that everyone agrees on to prove that there’s no problem with our ‘the true understanding of Linlang’. Therefore, let’s bet on the authenticity of the two volumes of the glittering jewel manual. If they’re real, we’ll win. If they’re not, you win. Elder Luo, do you dare to accept this bet?”

“First, tell me how you’re going to prove it.” Luo Feng smiled faintly.

Xia ruofei said with confidence,”our plan is to auction these two copies of the ‘glittering jewel true understanding’ as usual. The fellow Daoist who wins the auction can come to room 20. I will explain the contents of the ‘glittering jewel true understanding’ to him word by word. There are also many cultivation insights that are not recorded in the copies. I will give them away for free!” Whether it’s the contents of the first volume for the Qi layer or the second volume for the Jindan layer, we’ll definitely teach you! Fellow Daoists, you are all powerhouses of your own region, and every sect has sent a golden core cultivator. I believe that a fake cultivation technique can not be used to deceive you! Not to mention the cultivation technique we’re all cultivating? And I can guarantee that fellow Daoists who have never practiced the glittering jewel Wonderland before will gain some enlightenment on the spot after listening to my explanation!”

As soon as Xia ruofei said this, many cultivators were tempted. Clearly, Xia ruofei was very confident and did not seem to be deliberately disrupting the situation! According to Xia ruofei’s plan, it was impossible to fool them. If there was any problem with the manuscript, they would be caught immediately.

Luo Feng’s expression changed slightly when he heard this. His mind spun quickly, and he suddenly had a flash of inspiration. He sneered and said,”Fellow Daoist Xia’s words are incorrect! I’ll admit that fellow Daoist Xia’s method is indeed effective to a certain extent, but that can only prove that the two volumes of cultivation technique you provided are effective. In fact, it will take a long time to gradually come to a conclusion. Most importantly, none of you can prove that this is the “true glittering jewel manual”! What if you created another spiritual power cultivation technique and changed the name to the glittering jewel truth just to attack our lingjue mountain? For fellow Daoists who have never cultivated this cultivation technique, there’s no way to judge!”

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”so according to elder Luo, there’s no solution to this matter?” But how did you prove the “glittering jewel true understanding” of your spirit Vulture mountain? In the future, when he went to the spirit Vulture mountain and compared it with the original ... Hehe! Even if it’s fake, I don’t know which unlucky fellow Daoist won it, but he’ll only get a refund of spirit stones. He could’ve made some gains at the auction, but what if he ended up with nothing because he invested all of his spirit stones into that incomplete scroll of yours? Our method can at least determine the authenticity on the spot. If there’s really a problem with the auction item, the fellow Daoist who buys our hand – written copy won’t suffer any losses, and will even receive compensation ten times the amount. As for who is better, I believe all the fellow Daoists present have their own opinions!”

Luo Feng’s face darkened as he said,”fellow Daoist Xia has a glib tongue. You can even turn black into white!” There’s naturally a way to prove the authenticity of your handwritten copy!”

Luo Feng was actually very helpless. The situation was originally very good, but because Wu Ming wanted to listen to the other party’s bet, Xia ruofei had forcefully turned the tables.

He had to admit that Xia ruofei’s proposal to verify the authenticity of the manuscripts, especially the compensation of ten times the price, was very confident. It would definitely make many cultivators who were in a dilemma make up their minds. After all, if there was something wrong with the two manuscripts, it would not affect their bid for the next one. They would also receive compensation of ten times the transaction price, which was a huge sum of money.

Luo Feng even felt that the star Seizer sect’s promise of ten times the compensation would cause the price of the two handwritten copies to rise even further if they were to auction them off now.

Under such circumstances, he could not stabilize his defense and had to take the initiative to attack.

In fact, Luo Feng didn’t believe that the star Seizer sect would really be able to produce the “true glittering jewel Scripture.” After all, most of the cultivation techniques excavated from ancient cultivation ruins were unique copies, especially the “true glittering jewel Scripture,” which was a high – Quality cultivation technique. How could it be common? How could it be so coincidental that the star Seizer sect also had a collection? Luo Feng felt that the probability of this happening was extremely low.

Just like he had said before, he strongly suspected that the star Seizer sect had used a similarly good spiritual power cultivation method to change its appearance and auction it off as the “glittering jewel true understanding”. Their purpose was to stop the spirit Vulture mountain.

Hence, if they were to use Xia ruofei’s method to determine the truth, they would probably be in danger. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The hand – made copies of the spirit Vulture mountain would not be easy to sell ...

Xia ruofei responded to all the changes by remaining the same. He smiled and asked,””It seems that elder Luo already has a plan. I’m all ears!”

“It’s very simple,”Luo Feng snorted coldly and said,” I can guarantee that there’s no problem with the handwritten copy of the spirit Vulture mountain. ” “The star Seizer sect’s two hand – written copies just so happen to have the second volume of the glittering jewel true understanding. So, if any fellow Daoist is able to bid for the so – called hand – written copy of the glittering jewel true understanding, the spirit Vulture mountain is willing to provide our hand – written copy. You can compare it with the star Seizer sect’s hand – written copy, line by line, page by page. If it’s exactly the same, then we’ll naturally acknowledge the authenticity of the star Seizer sect’s hand – written copy! I’m sure that all of you should be more in favor of this plan. After all, almost everyone in the cultivation world knows about the “true glittering jewel technique” of our Ling Jue mountain!”

“If we use this method, our star Seizer sect will lose without a doubt!” Xia ruofei said indifferently.

Luo Feng was overjoyed and quickly said, “What’s wrong? Fellow Daoist Xia, are you feeling guilty? We’re willing to provide our side’s handwritten copy for free to share the burden with fellow Daoists. Fellow Daoist Xia should be happy! Weren’t you all very confident in the authenticity of your so – called “the truth of glittering jewels” just now?”

Luo Feng was even more confident in his judgment now. It was possible that the star Seizer sect had changed its appearance and used another cultivation technique as a replacement!

Xia ruofei’s next words almost made Luo Feng’s lungs explode ...
