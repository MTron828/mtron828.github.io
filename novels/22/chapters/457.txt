Chapter 458: The General Manager is in place (2)

However, when she saw the investment contract signed by the Paradise Corporation and Mr. Tang He, she couldn’t help but show a surprised look.

Then, Feng Jing saw a message that surprised her. It was a receipt from the southeast Province Office of Hengfeng group in Hong Kong.

“Chairman Xia, does your company also have business dealings with Hengfeng group?” Feng Rao asked in surprise.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,””Yes, in fact, our paradise vegetables have long appeared on the menu of the five – Star hotels under Hengfeng group. This cooperation was personally decided by Mr. MA Xiong, the chairman of Hengfeng group and I. From the feedback, the popularity of paradise vegetables is very gratifying. Hengfeng group has repeatedly proposed to increase the supply volume, but due to limited production capacity, we can only maintain the original supply. This is also the reason why I am anxious to set up the company’s framework and expand the scale of the farm.”

Feng Rao felt that her brain was not working well enough. Tang He, MA Xiong ... These two were world – Class tycoons with assets of more than ten billion US dollars. This young Chairman in front of her could actually directly discuss cooperation with them.

This shocked Feng Jing even more than the peach blossom company’s unexpected ten million USD assets.

The friendship of a world – Class tycoon, a product with amazing potential, and ... A good – looking boss ... Feng Jing, who had only come here to take a break, suddenly realized that this company was becoming more and more attractive to her.

“Miss Feng, what do you think?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

Feng Rao took a deep breath and said frankly,””Chairman Xia, if ... I mean if I were to work for your company, I hope to have the greatest autonomy and be able to make decisions on the company’s operations independently.”

Xia ruofei replied without hesitation,”of course!” I’m looking for the General Manager of the company, so I won’t ask about the company’s production and operation. You have the final say. ”

Xia ruofei originally wanted to get out of the tedious administrative work, which was why he wanted to increase the manpower and recruit a professional manager. In a sense, this was in line with Feng Jing’s request.

Perhaps Xia ruofei was too straightforward, but Feng Jing was a little embarrassed.

“This ... The general direction is still in the hands of the chairman ...” She said.

“The General manager’s opinion will also be an important reference for my decision on the company’s development strategy,” Xia ruofei immediately said. Miss Feng can rest assured on this point. In paradise Corporation, there won’t be a situation where an outsider criticizes an expert and interferes with the work. ” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Feng Jing nodded. This was what she cared about the most. The reason why she had resigned from Hailang network was mainly because a certain company leader had blindly given her instructions in the field she was in charge of.

Xia ruofei looked at Feng Rao and asked,””Miss Feng, can we ... Talk about the treatment?”

Feng Rao thought for a while and finally nodded.

Xia ruofei smiled in satisfaction. This meant that Feng Jing had accepted the position.

Xia ruofei said,”miss Feng ... No, I should call you President Feng now.” Chief Feng, our company can provide you with an annual salary of 200000 Chinese dollars. In addition, you’ll also enjoy 1% of the company’s net profit as a bonus, and you’ll be the only executive in the company to enjoy this bonus. ”

Giving shares and dividends to the company’s senior management was a common practice in many companies. However, Xia ruofei knew the huge potential of paradise Corporation. It was impossible to distribute the shares so easily, not even one percent. However, Xia ruofei was still bold enough to give one percent of the dividends to the General Manager of the company.

In fact, Xia ruofei’s offer was not very high. It was more than half of Feng Jing’s previous offer. Moreover, based on the company’s current revenue, a 1% bonus was just a drop in the bucket.

However, Feng Jing nodded without hesitation.””I agree!”

In just a few minutes of interaction, Feng Jing already had a whole new level of respect for this company. She was extremely optimistic about paradise corporation’s future. She was very clear that this insignificant 1% bonus could bring her a huge fortune in a few years.

Of course, compared to earning more money, Feng Jing was more concerned about the fact that she could finally take charge of a company with unlimited potential. Furthermore, she had been in charge of the company since it was young. The sense of accomplishment that came from growing the company into a giant was something that money couldn’t compare to.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”CEO Feng, according to the usual practice, you will also have a one – month probation period after joining paradise Corporation. This will be written in the contract. Of course, the benefits during the probation period will not change. You don’t mind this, right?”

“That’s reasonable,” Feng Jing said nonchalantly.”It’s a two – way choice.”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,””Then there’s no problem! Chief Feng, happy working with you!”

With that, Xia ruofei extended his hand to Feng Jing. Feng Jing also smiled brightly and shook Xia ruofei’s hand. She smiled and said,”Happy cooperation!”

Xia ruofei stood up and walked to his desk. He picked up the phone and made a call.”Lei Hu, come to my office for a moment.”

Lei Hu was already on standby on the first floor. After receiving Xia ruofei’s call, he quickly came to the office.
