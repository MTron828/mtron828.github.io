3169 Supercomputing Center (2)

Of course, Xia ruofei and Wang Chi raised this question mainly because they were worried that the bus would not be able to fit, so they had told him the number of people in advance.

“No problem,” Wang Chi nodded with a smile.”I’ll get them a business car. It’ll definitely be enough!”

“Then, thank you, academician Wang!” Xia ruofei said.

Then, Xia ruofei called Chen Xuan, Mu Sheng and the rest over and explained the situation to them.

What he was worried about didn’t happen. Everyone trusted him quite a bit and agreed very readily.

Xia ruofei did not leave the hard drive and laptop with the algorithm program to Chen Xuan because it was meaningless to avoid suspicion. He had a lot of time alone. If he really wanted to leave everyone behind, he had countless opportunities to make a new copy of the algorithm program, even though he did not do so.

Xia ruofei asked everyone to rest well in the afternoon. At the same time, he arranged dinner for everyone at the hotel and handed some coordination matters to Feng Xiaoyi. Then, he brought Song Wei and Ling Qingxue back to their rooms.

After resting in the hotel room for a while, Xia ruofei left the room with his two female friends at around 2:40 am. They took the elevator to the hotel lobby on the first floor.

It was almost threeo’ clock when Xia ruofei saw Feng Xiaoyi walking out of the elevator with Wang Chi.

“President Xia, you came down early!” Wang Chi greeted him with a smile.

“I’ve just arrived too,” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”academician Wang, did you have a good lunch break?”

“Hahaha! It’s not bad!” Wang Chi said,”I’ve been running around all my life and I’m used to it. I’ve never recognized a bed. I can fall asleep as soon as I lie down! However ... The single bed in the laboratory was the most comfortable! It’s especially safe to sleep on it!”

Feng Xiaoyi smiled and added,”President Xia, you don’t know, do you?” I often go to the laboratory to spend the night during the holidays just to have a good night’s sleep!”

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but laugh. Xia ruofei, on the other hand, was in awe. He knew that if Wang Chi didn’t spend all his time in the laboratory, he wouldn’t have developed such a “habit”.

“Academician Wang is really working hard for the development of our country’s computer industry!” Xia ruofei praised.

Wang Chi waved his hand with a smile and said,”what Xiaoyi said is just a rumor!” I went to the laboratory during the holidays only because the air conditioner at home was broken. It was really too hot!”

Everyone burst into laughter.

Xia ruofei knew that Feng Xiaoyi might be telling the truth, but Wang Chi didn’t want to show off.

After chatting for a while, Feng Xiaoyi’s phone rang. He picked it up and said a few words before hanging up. He then said to Wang Chi,””Teacher, the bus has arrived!”

“Oh?” Wang Chi nodded. President Xia, let’s go out then!”

“Sure!” Xia ruofei smiled.

As everyone walked out of the hotel, they saw a golden champagne – colored Buick GL8 slowly coming to a stop. A middle – aged man in his forties in the front passenger seat saw Wang Chi and quickly pushed open the door to get out. He almost ran over to Wang Chi.

The balding middle – aged man had a warm smile on his face as he said,””Academician Wang! Hello, hello!”

A reserved smile hung on Wang Chi’s face as he nodded,””Director Zhou! We meet again!”

“President Xia, let me introduce you. This is director Zhou from the general office of the new Wu Supercomputing Center.” Wang Chi smiled.

The balding man, director Zhou, quickly said,””Academician Wang, you can just call me little Zhou.”

Wang Chi didn’t comment and said indifferently,””Director Zhou, this is the chairman of paradise Corporation, Xia ruofei.”

“President Xia, it’s an honor to meet you!” Director Zhou said with a warm smile on his face.

“Hello! Director Zhou, I’ve caused you trouble!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Where? You’re too polite!” Director Zhou quickly said,”academician Wang, director Xia, let’s get in the car!”

“Alright!” Wang Chi nodded.

Xia ruofei said to Song Wei and Ling Qingxue,””You guys can sit in the back row. Go up first!”

The two seats in the middle were the most comfortable, but Wang Chi was too old to squeeze into the back seat. It was not appropriate for him to do so, so he had to take the middle seat.

Director Zhou, who had brought the car, naturally sat in the front passenger seat.

Therefore, the remaining middle row was not suitable for either Song Wei or Ling Qingxue. The two of them sitting together in the back row was the most appropriate arrangement.

It wasn’t that Xia ruofei didn’t care about his girlfriend.

Naturally, Song Wei and Ling Qingxue did not have any objections.

To get into the back of the Buick minivan, the only way was to pass through the gap between the two seats in the middle or lift up the middle seat. Therefore, the passengers in the back had to get on the car first.

After Song Wei and Ling Qingxue got into the car, Xia ruofei and Wang Chi sat in the middle row. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

The Buick GL8 was driving toward the Supercomputing Center in the suburbs.

This director Zhou of the General Affairs Department was probably mainly responsible for reception and security work. He was not very proficient in technology, so on the way, when Xia ruofei and Wang Chi were talking about the application of supercomputers, director Zhou basically couldn’t get a word in.

The car drove for about half an hour before they entered an Industrial Park.

“The Supercomputing Center is in this Park,” Wang Chi introduced. It’s fine here, but the security is still very tight when we’re near the Supercomputing Center!”
