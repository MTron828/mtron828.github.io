Chapter 779: Chapter 516 – a turtle in a jar (2)

After Xia ruofei figured out all these, he did not dare to delay. He quickly sat cross – legged on the ground, took out his laptop from the medium, and turned it on.

At the same time, he took out a few wasps with miniature cameras that he had prepared in the space in the small hotel.

Kappei Yamaguchi’s body was curled up in a pool of blood, but Xia ruofei did not feel any discomfort or fear at all. He quickly operated the laptop.

After turning on the monitoring computer client, Xia ruofei quickly turned on the switch of the Super – tiny camera on the hornet’s body. Then, he used his spiritual power to control them and flew them in the direction of the abandoned brick factory.

Xia ruofei knew that he had to hurry up and make sure that he lost contact with kappei Yamai. The Japanese would be alerted soon.

After Ma Feng and the others set off, Xia ruofei found some branches and covered up yamamizumi’s body. Then, he took his laptop and headed in the direction of the abandoned brick factory.

As Xia ruofei’s spiritual power could only radiate for about 100 meters, and the wireless transmission module of the Super – miniature camera did not have a high power output, it had a limited range. Hence, Xia ruofei had to get as close as possible to the brick factory.

However, Xia ruofei did not take the road that led to the brick factory. Instead, he walked through the bushes that had no road. The Japanese would definitely not send only kappei Shani to keep watch. There must be hidden sentries near the brick factory. It was definitely not possible to swagger through the road.

The lone wolf assault team often carried out missions in the tropical forest. Although there were no roads in this mountain forest and the terrain was very complicated, it was not a problem for Xia ruofei. His speed was no different from walking on flat ground.

Blackie’s physique was excellent. It followed Xia ruofei closely and its speed was not any slower.

Soon, Xia ruofei was approaching the brick factory. In a straight line, he was only about 50 to 60 meters away. If he went any further, he would lose the cover of the bushes and would probably expose himself.

Xia ruofei’s spiritual power could cover the entire area and there was no problem with the reception of the ultra – tiny camera. Hence, Xia ruofei slowly lowered his body.

“Blackie,” he said softly.”From now on, don’t make any sound, understand?”

......

Blackie was very understanding. It immediately nodded and lay down beside Xia ruofei, burying its head very low.

Seeing this, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but smile. He patted Blackie’s head and said,””You don’t have to be so exaggerated ...”

Blackie bared its teeth at Xia ruofei gloomily. Xia ruofei laughed and opened the laptop on the ground. He used his spiritual power to command the “mini Scouts” while staring at the surveillance image on the computer.

The blue van was quickly discovered. It was hidden in a run – down room in the Brickyard, and there was even some hay on top of it.

Then, the Wei nation agents ‘secret sentries were also discovered one by one.

Ma Feng’s target was very small, and the Wei nation agent would never have thought that the Chinese military would have such “advanced” investigation methods, so even when a Hornet flew past the hidden Sentry, he didn’t notice it at all.

Xia ruofei took out a piece of A3 paper and a red and blue pencil from the space and started to draw quickly on it.

Soon, a topographic map of the area appeared on the paper. The plowing roads, water channels, Hills, forests, brick kilns, and other things were clearly shown.

Xia ruofei then marked the locations of the three hidden sentries.

Xia ruofei’s drawing was very beautiful. This kind of military drawing was a necessary skill for every Scout. Although he had been discharged from the Army for more than a year, Xia ruofei still had not forgotten his specialty.

He commanded the Hornet to scout a few more rounds around the periphery. After confirming that there were no more hidden sentries, he then ordered them to carefully investigate the interior of the brick factory.

The computer displayed the surveillance footage that was sent back.

Abandoned factory, no one. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Kiln No. 1, no one.

Kiln No. 2, no one.

……

All the suspicious points were eliminated.

Finally, when a Hornet flew into the fourth and last brick kiln, seven or eight people appeared on the screen!

I’ve finally found the Japanese! Xia ruofei clenched his fists in excitement.

He commanded the Hornet to circle around carefully and take as many pictures as possible of the inside of the brick kiln.

This abandoned brick kiln was sunken, and more than half of it was underground, so the interior space was very large.

Xia ruofei saw that the Japanese had brought sufficient supplies. Their food and drinks were neatly arranged in the brick kiln. Everyone was carrying a gun. Almost everyone had a portable mini submachine gun and a whole box of grenades. It was a shocking sight.

When they were scouting the perimeter, Xia ruofei had also confirmed that one of the hidden sentries was equipped with a high – Precision Sniper Rifle.

This was clearly a group of well – equipped and well – trained enemies.

In a corner of the brick kiln, a dispirited old man was tied up and sitting on the ground. A Japanese kid was interrogating him.

Xia ruofei had seen the relevant information and recognized the old man with one look. He was the National treasure – Level scientist, professor Liang Qiming!

Although Xia ruofei was furious to see professor Liang being tortured, he also heaved a sigh of relief. This meant that professor Liang Qiming did not confess and the Japanese did not get what they wanted.

Therefore, for the time being, professor Liang’s life was at least safe.
