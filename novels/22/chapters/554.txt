Chapter 555: Chapter 429 – respect me by a foot (3)

This meant that Qian Lijun was more sensible than before.

Xia ruofei asked curiously,”master Luo, what happened to uncle Qian?” Why would our assets shrink by so much?”

“Boss Xia, our boss’s assets didn’t just shrink back then,” said master Luo. When he was at his lowest, he still owed a huge debt! We workers haven’t been paid for at most half a year, so we’re all old people. During that time, we followed the boss and got through it. Now, he’s very good to us, and his salary is much higher than that of other cultivation bases!”

“Then why?” Xia ruofei nodded. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“I don’t know much about the details,” master Luo shook his head and said,”I think I was deceived. “I remember the boss took out all the cash and sold a few properties. In the end, he even borrowed some from his relatives and friends, saying that he was doing some investment. In the end, it seemed like he met a scammer and all the money was gone. He even owed a huge debt ...”

Xia ruofei nodded thoughtfully and said,””So it’s like this ...”

Master Luo continued,”I think that man is a good friend of the boss. He used to come to our cultivation base often. Once, the boss got drunk and scolded him for being a jerk. He even lied to his good friend ...”

Xia ruofei had a rough idea. There was a lot of private fund – raising in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Province. Boss Qian most likely invested the money in this kind of illegal fund – raising place. Then, the other party’s capital chain broke, and the money was naturally lost.

“Uncle Qian didn’t report the case?” Xia ruofei asked.

“Why not?” Master Luo said,”the court also ruled that boss won, but what can they do if they can’t pay? Our boss trusted his friends too much, and he was scammed to the point that nothing was left. Fortunately, he has recovered over the past few years and paid back the money he owed. The cultivation base has made a lot of profits every year. ”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”you learn from your mistakes!”

He knew that master Luo was an outsider after all, and master Luo would not be very clear about the specific situation.

In fact, when Xia ruofei heard about this, he was slightly moved and wondered if he could help the Qian family.

Boss Qian was quite to his liking. He was also a loyal person. Qian Lijun was his good brother. It was all thanks to him for helping him with this matter.

Furthermore, boss Qian had promised to train workers for him. By right, they were competitors. Although the supply of high – Quality fengdou had always been in short supply, they were still considered to be in the same industry. There were not many people who could do what boss Qian did.

If it were someone else, not to mention helping with the training, they might even have to specifically tell the workers going to the southeast province to keep their skills confidential. Because only in this way could they collect processing fees! If they taught Xia ruofei’s men, they would not be able to earn any money, right?

Just based on this, Xia ruofei would definitely help if he could.

The reason why he had such an idea was because he now knew a lot of high – ranking officials and nobles. He might be able to help with this kind of thing. At least, it would be good to get back some money for them.

Although he could not get any more information from master Luo for the time being and it was not convenient for Xia ruofei to ask Qian Lijun directly, he thought that since it involved tens of millions of funds, it might even be reported in the news.

Hence, Xia ruofei took advantage of the fact that it was not time to board the plane yet and opened his phone to search for Boss Qian’s name.

Xia ruofei found a lot of useful information.

Moreover, after browsing through it, he felt that he might really be able to help and return the favor.
