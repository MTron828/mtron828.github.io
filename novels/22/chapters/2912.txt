The brothers were holding all kinds of weapons. There were switchblades, steel pipes, and some people holding a shotgun. This was the strongest firepower. Some of them even rushed out with the leg of a stool, looking like a ragtag Army.

“Brother Chao!”

“What do we do? Let’s fight it out with them, brother Chao!”

Everyone shared the same hatred for the enemy, and they were completely going all out.

At this time, the bodyguards had already raised their guns. They had a sinister smile on their faces, as if they had already foreseen the one – sided slaughter.

Indeed, such a ragtag group of soldiers did not even have decent weapons. How could they compare to these well – trained people?

Zhang Chao’s eyes were bloodshot. He roared,””Let’s rush up together. Even if we die today, we must kill them all! Ah Qiang, Ah Hua, you two protect Mr. Xia and retreat from the back door!”

“Yes! Brother Chao!” Everyone’s eyes were red as they gritted their teeth, looking like they were going to fight for their lives.

At this moment, Xia ruofei said indifferently,””Qingfeng, take care of these B * stards! Don’t take their lives, or they’ll bring trouble to our brothers in the Hong sect!”

Zhang Chao was stunned for a moment. He even thought that Xia ruofei had gone crazy.

However, just as Xia ruofei finished speaking, they heard an old voice respectfully reply,””Yes! Mr. Xia!”

Then, a blue figure flashed out of the Huafeng shipping building. It was even faster than when Xia ruofei had slapped yirade. No one could see who it was.

Then, it was as if everyone was watching a scene from a kung fu movie. It was a scene of Youyou charging into the group of bodyguards at four times the normal speed. No one could see his movements clearly. In at most seven or eight seconds, the strong bodyguards were lying all over the courtyard, and their guns were all twisted into fried dough twists and thrown to the ground.

The bodyguards didn’t even have the time to shoot. The speed of the opponent was too fast for them to see clearly. If they shot randomly, they would probably hurt their teammates by mistake. If they hesitated, they would have no chance to shoot at all.

It was not until all the bodyguards had laid down that Zhang Chao and the others could see clearly that the blue figure was the old man in the blue robe who had come to the company with Xia ruofei today.

Zhang Chao and the others ‘mouths were so wide open that a light bulb could be stuffed in, but they didn’t even realize it.

The shock in Zhang Chao’s heart was extremely strong. When Luo Qingfeng and Xia ruofei came to Huafeng shipping today, they had been very low – Key. They just followed Xia ruofei and did not even say a word.

Cultivators were different from those who practiced martial arts in the secular world. Qingfeng Luo’s body looked very thin, and he did not look as energetic as a martial artist. In fact, this was equivalent to returning to the original in martial arts. In the eyes of the people in the secular world, Qingfeng Luo was just an ordinary old man.

Zhang Chao could never have imagined that the skinny old man that Xia ruofei had brought with him was so powerful. This was the rhythm of a human – shaped Gundam! Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The Mexicans across the street were also frightened.

No matter if it was ERAD or Madel, as well as the state Councilmen and city government officials who had come to help boost the momentum today, all of them were dumbfounded, unable to believe their eyes.

Qingfeng Luo, a golden core stage master, dealing with a few ordinary people with guns was like using a butcher’s knife to kill a chicken. He did not even sweat a drop and had already settled it.

Qingfeng Luo did not think that his actions were impressive because he knew that if his master had acted on his own, he would definitely be faster than him. It was just a few ordinary people, not worth mentioning.

After he was done with the bodyguards, he walked up to Xia ruofei and said respectfully,””Mr. Xia, I’ve knocked them all out. They’re not dead, but I think they’ll need to rest for a while before they can get off the bed.”

“Good job!” Xia ruofei nodded.

Then, he turned his gaze to ERAD and strode towards him.

ERAD’s entire body quivered. He quickly took two steps back and said with a look of horror,””Don’t come any closer!”

ERAD was really scared now. He had never seen a person with such heaven – defying martial strength. He could even ignore firearms and directly crush them in a one – sided manner.

ERAD’s skills were quite good. He had even killed several Mexico police officers with his bare hands. However, compared to the old man in front of him, he felt that he was a weakling who couldn’t even truss a chicken. He couldn’t even handle one of the man’s hands.

The bodyguards were also lying down. He had no help at all. Obviously, the situation had been reversed. At least for now, in this yard, he was the meat on the anvil, while the other party was holding a knife.

“If you try to pull out that gun, I guarantee that your wrist will be broken before you can shoot ...” Xia ruofei said calmly.

ERAD always carried a weapon with him because he didn’t trust anyone and he had too many enemies.

He had indeed wanted to take out his gun when Xia ruofei was not paying attention.

For a ruthless character like ERAD, he would never give up on the idea of fighting at any time, but the premise was that the opponent was not prepared. Now that Xia ruofei had exposed him, he naturally did not dare to make any small moves. He had seen the terrifying speed of Xia ruofei and Luo Qingfeng with his own eyes. He knew that he had no chance to take out his gun and shoot when the opponent had already noticed him.

Therefore, ERAD’s hand, which had been stretched out halfway, immediately stopped, and he obediently took it out. His hand was naturally empty.

He slowly raised his hands and said in Spanish,””Sir, please calm down. I won’t attack you ...”

Xia ruofei walked over slowly, and Luo Qingfeng followed closely behind him.

Although he knew that Xia ruofei did not need his protection, it was his duty as a servant.

Xia ruofei stared at ERAD coldly for a few seconds and did not say anything. The atmosphere became extremely tense.

At this time, Fernando, the state parliament member, said in a trembling voice,””Sir, any form of violence is illegal. Please remain calm!”

Sanchez, the Deputy Mayor of quachaquarkos, was shaking with both legs. She gathered her courage and said,””If you kill someone here, you can’t leave Mexico. The police will never let go of a murderer!”

Xia ruofei’s face revealed a mocking expression as he said,””The words of the two of you are really righteous! In any other country, these words might have some credibility, but in Mexico ... Hehe! There had been more than 20000 murders last year. How many had the police solved? Also, speaking of murderers, this Mr. ERAD in front of me is one of the biggest murderers. Aren’t you guys close to him?”

Sanchez’s face turned red and he said guiltily,””That’s all hearsay! The Mexico police have always been committed to Social Security, and Mr. ERAD is the chairman of the harbor Group. He is a law – abiding businessman, not a murderer!”

“Shut up!” Xia ruofei scolded.

Sanchez trembled in fear and couldn’t help but take a step back.

In fact, Xia ruofei was not particularly fierce, but the cold aura that he exuded was terrifying. Especially the moment Xia ruofei told her to shut up, it was as if a huge pressure had hit her face. It made her feel that the harmless – looking young man in front of her had suddenly turned into a fierce beast, making her shudder.

Xia ruofei did not bother with these politicians who had no moral integrity. He went straight to ERAD, looked down at him, and asked indifferently,””Do you know how we killed your bodyguard?”

“I don’t know ...” ERAD said, trembling with fear.

“Then let me tell you.” Xia ruofei said coldly,”Chinese Kungfu! Chinese Kongfu! Have you heard of it?”
