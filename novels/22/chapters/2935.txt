“Don ‘t!” Ma su quickly said,”ruofei, I was just joking with you! The farm serves us with good food and drinks every day! It was because of this that the brothers felt uneasy! You’re just eating and not working, and we haven’t even arrived at the base yet, and you’re already paying everyone their salary!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”old company commander, sharpening a knife will not delay the work of cutting wood!”

“The blade is already polished until it’s shiny! Everyone’s looking forward to chopping wood!” Ma su said,”ruofei, we can only do some basic training in the country. We can’t get any equipment. I think we’re almost ready now. You’d better arrange for everyone to go to the island as soon as possible!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”old company commander, I’m calling you to tell you that everything is ready on peach source Island. Everyone’s barracks have been built, and the first batch of equipment has arrived. Since everyone is eager to fight, let’s get ready and set off in a few days!”

“That’s great!”Ma su was overjoyed. We’ve been looking forward to this day!”

“Old company commander, you can sort out a list of names and send it to my email! I’m going to book a plane to pick everyone up, and the name list must be specific to everyone. ” Xia ruofei said,”you have to provide a name list of the accompanying people. For example, isn’t sister – in – Law coming this time? That must also be reflected in the list. ”

“No problem!” Ma Jia said,”this time, your sister – in – Law is the only person who is not part of the guard. I will send the list to your email in a while!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said,”old company commander, please get everyone ready in the next two days and wait for further notice!”

“Alright!” Ma Jia said excitedly.

After hanging up, Xia ruofei called his assistant at peach blossom company, Qin Yanan, and gave him some instructions.

At this moment, Song Wei, Ling Qingxue, Li Yifu, and Luo Qingfeng all walked out of the weapons and equipment Warehouse. Everyone looked at Xia ruofei with admiration.

Xia ruofei called for everyone to go downstairs. As he walked, he said to Li Yifu,””Foster husband, there shouldn’t be any problems in the guard Camp. I just took a look. Everyone’s dormitories, kitchens, dining rooms, training grounds, warehouses, and so on are all complete. All the facilities are basically in place, so I’m going to gather the guards here and get them to get to work as soon as possible.”

“Yes! Senior granduncle!” Li Yifu nodded and asked,”is there anything I can help you with?”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”with more than a hundred people coming here together, we definitely have to book a plane.” I’m thinking ... Why don’t we just book a bigger plane from Australia so that everyone can have a more comfortable flight!”

“No problem! Leave this matter to this disciple!” Li Yifu said without hesitation.

The Hong sect was quite powerful in Australia, especially Li Yifu, who had a close relationship with Tang Yitian. He could coordinate the charter of the plane from Australian Airlines at any time. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Of course, with Tang Yitian and Xia ruofei’s relationship, as long as Xia ruofei asked, he would naturally take care of everything. It was just that Xia ruofei didn’t want to worry about these trivial matters. Besides, he was more at ease to leave it to Li Yifu.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes!” I’ll give you the contact information of the person in charge of the whale Island guard, and you’ll be in charge of the details. ”

“Yes! Senior granduncle!” Li Yifu nodded and said.

“Adopted husband,” Xia ruofei continued,”before we pick up the guards, there’s one more thing that must be done.”

“Grand uncle – Master, what are your instructions?” Li Yifu quickly said.

“We have to recruit staff for other positions on the island first.” Xia ruofei said,”you have a lot of connections in Australia and North America. You should know what kind of people are needed on the island, so I’ll leave this matter to you.”

“Alright, martial granduncle!” Li Yifu said,”I will get it done as soon as possible!”

Xia ruofei nodded.”I’m thinking of registering another company. It’ll be in charge of managing the secular Affairs of Paradise Island. This way, the salary of all the staff, including the guards, can be paid through this company.”

“This is a good idea!” Li Yifu asked,”great uncle – Master, do you want to register this company in China or overseas?”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”I think we should register an offshore company in Cayman Islands and then have 100% control of a domestic company.” It’s more convenient this way. ”

Many employees from China, including Ma Jia and his family, needed to apply for insurance and housing Fund, so it was more convenient to stay in a local company.

In the beginning, Xia ruofei wanted to hang them at paradise Corporation. After some thought, he decided that it was better to separate them. Although he had absolute control of the company and owned a majority of the shares, Feng Jing and the other higher – ups of the company all had a small share. In the future, Xia ruofei would gradually release more shares to motivate his employees. Therefore, it was best for those who had nothing to do with paradise company to leave. Otherwise, it would be difficult to do the accounting.

“No problem!” Li Yifu replied. Martial granduncle, this disciple’s company in the United States has people who specialize in this area, so let this disciple handle the registration of the company!”

“Mm! You’ll have to work hard for the next few days!” Xia ruofei nodded slightly and said,”there are very few people available right now and you are someone I absolutely trust. So, I can only rely on the capable to do more work!”
