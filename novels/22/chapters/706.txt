Chapter 707: A trace of gloominess (1)

“Xue Fei, you’re really lucky this time. You’re in the same exam hall as Lin Qiao, and you’re sitting in front and behind her! Lin Qiao’s English is so good. You should have no problem with English, right?” The tall and thin boy said enviously. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The other short and fat Boy said hatefully,””Don’t even mention it! I told her before the exam, but this brat didn’t answer at all. During the exam, she even deliberately protected the paper tightly. I kicked the chair a few times, but she ignored me! Damn it, I almost got the invigilator to come ...”

The tall and thin boy was surprised,”no way?” Such a personality? Didn’t she transfer from the countryside? How dare he disobey you? Doesn’t she know that your father is the Deputy Mayor?”

“Hmph! This brat doesn’t know what’s good for her!” Xue Fei snorted coldly.”Xia Ming, I’m going to teach her a lesson that will leave a deep impression on her! Teach her how to be a good person!”

Xia Ming, the tall and thin boy, smiled and said,””Alright! Please allow me to mourn for that girl! It seems like young master Xue is really angry ...”

“Nonsense! No one has ever dared to treat me like this before!” Xue Fei said,”I’m considered a failure in English! I’ll have to rely on my old man to get into college, and I’ll definitely be scolded by him for the whole summer! Fuck! I’m so annoyed just thinking about it ...”

“Xue Fei, I heard a rumor ...” Xia Ming hesitated and said,”this Lin Qiao might not be simple. I heard that when she transferred here, even the school leaders went to welcome her in person ...”

“Tsk! So What if I do?” Xue Fei snorted.”In this Sanshan city, how big can his background be?” I don’t believe there’s anyone I can’t touch! I’m telling you, Xia Ming, I’m definitely going to teach this stupid B * tch a lesson! No one will be able to persuade me otherwise!”

“Alright!” Xia Ming shrugged.

Xia ruofei squinted his eyes and heard every single word of their conversation.

These two boys were both from No. 8 high school, and there weren’t many students from No. 8 high school assigned to Chengnan high school. It was unlikely that two people named Lin Qiao would be assigned to ran ran at the same time. The probability was too low, so it could be confirmed that the two of them were Qiao’ er.

Why were the kids so vicious these days? Xia ruofei frowned and thought to himself.

Just as he was about to catch up with Xue Fei and give him a warning, the other candidates started to leave the exam venue. He immediately saw Lin Qiao in the front of the crowd.

......

Hence, Xia ruofei took a step back and looked deeply at Xue Fei and Xia Ming’s back. Then, he walked toward Lin Qiao.

Foreign language was the last subject. After taking this subject, it would mean that the hellish third – year life was finally over.

All the candidates, regardless of whether they did well or not, felt a sense of relief from the bottom of their hearts. Their faces were filled with smiles, and their steps were much lighter.

Basically, this summer vacation of the third year of high school was the most relaxing period of his life.

Lin Qiao also saw Xia ruofei from afar. A charming smile appeared on her pretty face. She waved at Xia ruofei and shouted,””Brother ruofei!”

The coldness on Xia ruofei’s face disappeared instantly. He smiled warmly and walked up to her.

“Brother ruofei! The exam is finally over!” Lin Qiao held Xia ruofei’s arm and said with a smile.

Xia ruofei was already used to such an intimate action. He urged him to say it a few times, but Lin Qiao still did it her own way, so he had no choice but to accept it.

Xia ruofei laughed and asked,”how is it?” Don’t you feel relieved?”

“Yes, it is!” “I feel so relaxed!” Lin qiaojiao said.

“How did you do?” Xia ruofei asked casually.

“With your super – stimulant, I have to go beyond my usual level!” Lin Qiao said happily,”brother ruofei, I feel that I did very well this time. Every subject is much better than I expected.” But that’s just my own feeling. I don’t know what the final result will be. ”

Xia ruofei smiled.”The questions ‘answers will be out by tomorrow at the earliest. By then, you’ll have a rough idea of what to do by comparing the answers!”

“En!” Lin Qiao nodded her head with anticipation.

As they spoke, the two of them had already reached the Knight XV SUV that Xia ruofei had parked by the side of the road.

At noon, when he sent Lin Qiao out for the exam, Xia ruofei had already checked out of the Kempinski Hotel room. Hu Zi’s mother had also returned home in advance to prepare dinner.

Hence, after the two of them got in the car, Xia ruofei drove directly to Lin Qiao’s house.

On the way, Xia ruofei casually asked,””Qiao’ er, you guys should have split up and assigned the exam grounds, right? Are there any students in the same exam hall as you?”

“There are two people in the same exam hall as me, and the other one is sitting behind me!” Lin Qiao said.

Xia ruofei squinted his eyes. He was pretty sure that the “Lin Qiao” that Xue Fei was talking about was Qiao’ er.

“Did you guys ‘help each other’?” Xia ruofei asked in a joking tone.

Lin Qiao curled her lips and said,”who would dare?” The invigilating of the college entrance examination was very strict, and there were surveillance cameras installed in the classroom. If they were caught cheating, their lives would be ruined! That classmate of mine even asked me to show my paper for him to copy before the exam, but I ignored him!”
