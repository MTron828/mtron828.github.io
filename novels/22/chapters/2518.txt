The heart of the strong

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”you can shower here!” Aren’t you afraid that you’ll suffocate others when you go out with this smell?”

“This …” Wu Lei said awkwardly. After all, Xia ruofei was the boss of the club and had helped him so much. He already felt that he owed him a lot of favors. Now that he had made the boss’s room stinky and wanted to take a bath here, he was a little hesitant.

Xia ruofei laughed,”you’re a man, why are you being so shy?” Wait a minute, I have some clean clothes here, I’ll go get it for you. ”

With that, Xia ruofei got up and walked into the bedroom. He took out a new set of sportswear and a box of underwear from the interspace. He had put many different types of clothes in the interspace. He did not need to tidy up when he went out. He could just take whatever he needed from the interspace.

Xia ruofei walked into the living room and stuffed the clothes into Wu Lei’s hands.””Hurry up and go!”

“Alright then!” Wu Lei said,”thank you, director Xia!”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”hurry up!” Hurry up! I have to hurry up and ventilate the room. This smell …”

Wu Lei was even more embarrassed when he heard that. He quickly took the clothes and rushed into the bathroom.

Xia ruofei turned on the ventilation system in the room and opened a few Windows at the same time. Then, he sat on a chair by the window, lit a cigarette, and enjoyed the night view of Barcelona as he smoked.

By the time Wu Lei came out of the shower, the smell in the room had almost dissipated.

His figure was similar to Xia ruofei ‘s, so Xia ruofei’s clothes were quite suitable for him.

As soon as they came out of the bathroom, Wu Lei said,””President Xia, my clothes have been sealed in the laundry bag. I’ll take them out and throw them away later.”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I can still wear it after a shower!” Don’t waste it!”

Wu Lei scratched his head and said,”I sniffed it myself just now and I almost vomited … Why is there such a strong smell?” I sweat a lot during training, but I don’t sweat like this!”

Xia ruofei said,”this action can expel some impurities from your body. These are things that your body can’t purify normally. They’ve been accumulating in your body. Of course, they don’t smell good.”

“Then if I were to learn this move, wouldn’t it cost me a lot of clothes?” Wu Lei said worriedly.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.”What beautiful things are you thinking of! Only the first few times had better effects. How could it be like this every time? Your body doesn’t have that many impurities for you to excrete!”Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“That makes sense! That makes sense!” Wu Lei scratched his head and said,”President Xia, I’ll go back to my room to rest first and find a few sets of clothes that I don’t really wear. I’ll come back later and please continue to guide me!”

Just now, he only felt a piercing pain. It was not until he took a shower in the bathroom that Wu Lei felt the changes in his body. Although there was no change in his body shape, he clearly felt that his body’s flexibility and strength had been improved to a certain extent.

He had just finished today’s match, so he would feel a sense of fatigue. However, after today’s practice, this familiar feeling of fatigue had been swept away.

Naturally, Wu Lei knew that the move that Xia ruofei had taught him was not simple.

He had only persisted for about two minutes, and there was already such an effect. If he persisted for a long time … Wu Lei felt extremely excited when he thought of this.

He wished he could practice a few more times a day, but Xia ruofei had advised him to practice twice a day and to persist for as long as possible each time. That was naturally reasonable, so he did not plan to practice more himself.

Of course, it was very difficult for him to practice more now. Without Xia ruofei’s correction, he would not be able to do this move without any mistakes. In addition, as a professional athlete, he was also very clear about this principle. It was the same in football training. Blindly adding more training might not necessarily be effective. It was better to plan it according to one’s physical condition. Otherwise, not only would it be ineffective, but it might even backfire and cause physical injury.

Wu Lei rested in his room for about an hour. Then, he changed into a pair of short – sleeved sports shorts and returned to Xia ruofei’s room.

“Mr. Xia, I’ve already handed your clothes to the hotel staff. They’ll send it to your room after they’re done washing it,” Wu Lei said as soon as he entered the room.

Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand.”It’s just a set of clothes. Besides, you’ve only worn it for a few minutes. What’s the matter if you wash it or not?” You’re too serious …”

Wu Lei had an honest smile on his face and said,””I’ve already troubled you … Then … If it’s possible, shall we start now?”

Xia ruofei nodded.”If you think you’re ready, we can start anytime.”

In fact, practicing this set of movements from the little golden man wouldn’t cause any harm to the body, and there wasn’t a problem of whether one could bear it or not. The key was that the pain was very difficult to bear if one didn’t have great perseverance, especially after practicing it once and immediately repeating it after a short rest.

Xia ruofei’s will was strong enough. When he first started to practice, he would feel terrified whenever he thought about the pain he had to go through during the last practice.

And if they couldn’t bear the pain and broke down mentally, they wouldn’t be able to hold on for a long time. Moreover, the more one persisted to the limit, the better the effect.
