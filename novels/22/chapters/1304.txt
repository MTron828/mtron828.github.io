However, President Lin and the others didn’t have the mood to taste the delicious food. They filled a large bowl of rice and quickly put the rice into their mouths along with the dishes. The six of them looked like they were gobbling down food.

Even Feng Rao couldn’t wait to eat. Although she didn’t eat in an ugly manner, she was obviously eating faster.

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. He could only speed up a little. He couldn’t wait for everyone to finish eating and then watch him eat alone, right?

After a simple lunch, Xia ruofei brought President Lin and the rest back to his villa. Feng Jing followed them.

“Everyone, feel free to take a seat in the living room!” After Xia ruofei led everyone in, he smiled and said,”I’ll go upstairs and bring the things down!”

“Brother Xia, I’ll get someone to go up and help you!” President Lin quickly said. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

A hundred kilograms of weight was not light. He was afraid that Xia ruofei would not be able to carry it. If he accidentally damaged the wormgrass inside, it would not be worth it.

“No need, no need. You guys just wait!” Xia ruofei said.

After he finished speaking, he quickly went upstairs and returned to his room. After he locked the door and windows, he took out all the Cordyceps that Xia Qing had prepared in advance from the spirit map space.

More than 130 kilograms of Cordyceps were packed into many sealed bags and then placed into three large cardboard boxes. Each layer was filled with foam and sponges to prevent the bottom layer from being squeezed.

Each box was more than 40 kilograms in weight.

Xia ruofei easily stacked the two boxes together and carried them out. When Xia ruofei carried the two boxes, they were already taller than his head. From afar, they could only see the two boxes moving forward.

President Lin saw Xia ruofei carrying the cardboard box down the stairs in such a dangerous position and was so scared that his soul almost left his body. He quickly called for his subordinates to pick it up.

Xia ruofei replied easily,”no need!” Just wait below!”

After saying that, he walked down the stairs with light steps, then gently put the box on the ground and said,””There’s another box upstairs. Please wait a moment!”

After that, Xia ruofei turned around and went upstairs to get the last box.

President Lin saw how relaxed Xia ruofei was and couldn’t help but try to move the cardboard box out of curiosity. The cardboard box was about 80 to 90 pounds but he didn’t move it at all. He couldn’t help but be shocked. Xia ruofei looked so white and clean, but his arm strength was so strong!

Xia ruofei quickly moved the last box downstairs and said,””Everything is here, including the samples you saw this morning. It’s about 136 kilograms in total! Chief Lin, let everyone inspect the goods!”

“Alright!” Mr. Lin’s voice trembled as he asked Dr. Huang and the others to open the boxes and check the aweto inside.

He also opened a paper box.

Bags of aweto packed in plastic were taken out and placed in a row in the living room.

Feng Jing’s heart started to race when she saw the scene and thought of the sky – High price of 750000 Yuan per kilogram.

The living room was very quiet. Everyone was focused on the examination and appraisal.

It was impossible to look at all the aweto in the bag. However, it was a huge deal. Even though CEO Lin was familiar with Xia ruofei, he did not dare to take it lightly.

Therefore, they would open each bag and then repeatedly randomly pick samples for inspection.

Xia ruofei sat on the sofa leisurely and did not urge her at all.

Everyone had been watching for more than half an hour. Mr. Lin felt that he had seen more top quality wormgrass in his previous life than he had seen today.

In the end, he was even a little numb.

He opened a random bag and grabbed a handful. They were all top quality wormgrass that were rare.

Finally, President Lin said very excitedly,””Brother Xia! This batch of wormgrass was of extremely high quality! The headquarters will definitely agree to the acquisition. I’ll call to apply for permission immediately!”
