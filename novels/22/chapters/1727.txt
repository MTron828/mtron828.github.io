Chapter 1728: What a big battle formation_2

Everything would be handled after he returned to the country.

Xia ruofei was also full of anticipation for the two barrels of clear grape juice. He could not wait to see what quality of wine he would get in the end if he fermented it in the best oak barrels in the spirit map space.

Naturally, the two of them took an A.S.A. Flight back. Xia ruofei had booked Feng Jing a first – Class ticket while he used his right as an honorary passenger to get a free ride and a free upgrade. He sat in the first – Class with Feng Jing.

The entire flight took more than ten hours. The service of the flight attendants was meticulous. Although they used to be very professional, their smiles were more or less professional. This time, Xia ruofei truly felt at home.

When the plane landed at the capital’s airport, the captain on duty personally came out and gave Xia ruofei a bottle of red wine.

When the two of them came out of seclusion, Feng Rao even smiled and said,””Ruofei, if you take a few more flights in the future, the wine cabinet in your house will be full!”

Xia ruofei did not know whether to laugh or cry.”This is the first time I’m on a plane as an honored passenger. That’s why they sent me wine. How can they send me wine every time?” Besides, who would take international flights for no reason?!”

“It’s free anyway! If you’re free, go abroad and play!” Feng Rao said with a smile. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“You said it yourself! Don’t complain that I don’t care about the company’s Affairs!” Xia ruofei said half – jokingly.

The two of them chatted and laughed as they walked out of the restricted area of the airport. However, as soon as they came out, Xia ruofei was dazzled by the flashes of cameras. He looked at the large group of reporters in front of him with his mouth agape, not knowing what was going on.

Feng Jing was also shocked. Did we take the same flight as some big star?

Xia ruofei’s first reaction was the same. However, this thought was quickly crushed by countless microphones and questions.

“Mr. Xia! I’m a reporter from Weibo, welcome back to China! How does it feel to be a national hero in Australia?”

“Some people say that you are the light of the Chinese in the new era. What do you think of this evaluation?”

“Mr. Xia! What were you thinking when you were forced to land?”

......

Even though Xia ruofei had always been a calm person, he was still a little confused in this chaotic environment.

Are these reporters here for me? What the hell was going on!

At the end of the day, both Xia ruofei and Feng Jing had been overseas for the past few days. They knew that Xia ruofei was in China and was especially popular on the internet, but they did not expect him to be so popular.

In fact, when they boarded the plane, the flight number and landing time of the flight had already been spread on the internet. Wanwan, this was a flight to the capital of China. There were many Chinese people on this flight. Some were tourists from Australia, and some were Chinese from Australia who came to China. These people had personally experienced the change in the status of Chinese people brought about by Xia ruofei’s influence in Australia, so almost everyone knew who Xia ruofei was.

Hence, before Xia ruofei and Feng Jing could even sit down in the first class cabin, photos of them boarding the plane were already posted on Weibo.

At the same time, the flight number, destination, landing time, and so on were also exposed.

News about Xia ruofei was still on the top search list in the country. The return of such a key figure was naturally a celebration for the media, so the reporters all rushed to the capital’s airport.

As the flight time was more than ten hours, during this time, many foreign reporters took the fastest flight to the capital city. After getting off the plane, they immediately started working at the airport, ready to interview Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei also saw that other than the reporters, there were even some ordinary people who had come to the airport to welcome him.

He saw a group of young people in white T – shirts behind the reporters. Their custom – made white T – shirts and banners had the words “overbearing president’s fan club” and Xia ruofei’s photo.

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. When did he become a bossy President?

Furthermore, the company’s CEO was Feng Jing! I’m the president’s superior, okay? We’re familiar with each other, but what’s the meaning of dropping me by half a level for no reason?

Xia ruofei was used to big scenes. He quickly calmed himself down. Facing the sea of microphones, he gently pushed one of the microphones that was almost in his mouth forward.

“Everyone, please step back,” Xia ruofei said.”Don’t crowd around, in case you cause a stampede!”

Xia ruofei’s voice was not loud and his tone was calm. However, in such a noisy environment, everyone could hear him clearly.

Even though it was very crowded just now, Xia ruofei had been protecting Feng Rao with one hand. No matter how crowded it was, Xia ruofei did not move an inch. He was like a solid dam. No matter how the tide washed over him, he would always stand tall.

Initially, Feng Jing was a little flustered when she saw this scene. However, when she saw Xia ruofei’s strong back and strong arms, she calmed down and felt a warm current in her heart.

Feng Jing stood behind Xia ruofei. The way she looked at Xia ruofei gradually changed. Her watery eyes were filled with unconcealable tenderness.

The airport security personnel also noticed the commotion and quickly sent over staff to maintain order.

“Sir, for the safety of you and the others, we suggest you leave the airport through the passenger passage.” A manager – like person said.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”okay, I’ll cooperate with your work. However, it must be hard for the reporters to come all the way here. Also, let me answer a few questions from those people who are picking us up.”

“Thank you for your understanding, Sir. Please settle the matters here as soon as possible!” The manager said.

“Don’t worry!”Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.

Then, Xia ruofei raised his voice and said,””Reporters, let’s take a step back. Don’t block the passage. The people behind can’t get out ...”

A few Chinese passengers behind Xia ruofei shouted,””It’s okay, President Xia, we can wait!”

Everyone burst into laughter, and the atmosphere became much more relaxed.

The reporters saw that Xia ruofei’s attitude was so peaceful and they were naturally willing to cooperate. So, the group of people surrounded Xia ruofei and walked more than ten meters in the direction of the hall.

Xia ruofei said,”you’ve all seen it. We can’t have too many people here. The security guards are still waiting over there.” I’ll answer three of your questions!”

“Alright!” The reporters responded in unison.

In a situation where there were too many monks and too little gruel, the reporters were naturally anxious to ask questions. So, it became like just now, everyone fighting to ask questions, and all the voices were mixed together.

It was a good thing that Xia ruofei’s hearing was exceptional. In such an environment, he could still clearly understand everyone’s questions. Otherwise, he would not have been able to deal with them.

Feng Rao felt her head throb as she said loudly,”Everyone, please ask your questions one by one. This way, no one will be able to hear clearly! President Xia can’t answer everyone’s questions!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it’s okay, I heard it.” I’ll pick a question to answer! The reporter from Penguin News asked me how it felt to be an Australian hero, right?”

The reporter in the crowd gave Xia ruofei a thumbs up and said with a smile,””President Xia is indeed amazing! You can even hear me clearly like this!”

It was indeed unbelievable to everyone. Xia ruofei not only heard the question clearly, but he also heard the reporter’s name clearly. He did not mix it up even if someone else spoke at the same time. Just based on this, many people could not help but think highly of him.

People who could be heroes were indeed not ordinary! Everyone thought to themselves.
