Chapter 1601: Chapter 927 -[weapon refining secrets](1)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei stepped into the quiet bamboo house.

The furnishings in the bamboo house were very simple. There was only a bed and a desk, and there was nothing else.

Miraculously, no one knew how long it had been since anyone had set foot in this place, but the interior of the bamboo house was still spotless, as if someone had just cleaned it.

Xia ruofei had already dabbled in arrays to a certain extent, so he was not surprised. He knew that this was definitely the effect of the array. This seemingly ordinary bamboo house actually had a lot of arrays set up. It was just that they did not repel or harm him, the owner of the spirit map space. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The interior of the bamboo house was so simple that everything could be seen at a glance. Hence, Xia ruofei’s attention was naturally focused on the study table.

Because there were three books neatly stacked on the desk, the puppet refining method that Xia Qing had mentioned should be in these three books.

Xia ruofei walked over excitedly and picked up the three books.

The material of these three books was very special. One look and one could tell that they were not made of ordinary paper. It felt very tough in his hand. Xia ruofei could not tear it open even with a little force. The words on them were very clear. They did not show any signs of aging.

There were no words on the cover of the first book. Xia ruofei flipped through it roughly. It was a record of some interesting anecdotes in the cultivation world. Many of them should be the personal experiences of the previous owner of this spirit map space. There were also many more famous cultivation legends. Each piece seemed to be written casually.

Xia ruofei quickly put down the first book and flipped to the second one.

The cover of this booklet was written <>. It introduced the cultivation methods of some Ling grasses and Ling medicines.

From the spirit herb garden outside, it could be seen that the previous owner of the spirit map space was quite experienced in the cultivation of spirit herbs.

Xia ruofei knew how precious these insights were, but he was more concerned about how to make a puppet. So, after briefly reading the <>, he put it on the table and looked at the last booklet.

The cover of the book read <>. Xia ruofei was overjoyed. ‘This should be it!’

Xia ruofei couldn’t wait to open this <>. As expected, it was filled with notes on armament refining. It wasn’t a systematic knowledge, but more like a random collection of experiences. It was a little messy.

Xia ruofei flipped the pages quickly. Suddenly, the words “analysis of puppet refining method” appeared in front of his eyes. He stopped flipping the pages and began to read the insight hungrily.

Xia ruofei’s eyes brightened.

It was indeed it! The title of this article looked very small, but in fact, it completely and systematically described how to refine a puppet. From the preparation of materials, the refining technique, the use of arrays ... Every link was complete. It also included some experiences during the refining process, including some detours taken, and a series of reverse washing based on these mistakes. It could be said to be very detailed.

Of course, just because the content was detailed didn’t mean that it was easy to make.

Although Xia ruofei had only read through it once, he could still feel that the refining of this puppet would be quite difficult. Every step seemed to be extremely complicated.

At the same time, the use of some formations was beyond the scope of Xia ruofei’s current understanding of formations.

Speaking of which, the easiest part was the gathering of materials that Xia ruofei had been worried about the most.

He originally thought that it would be very difficult to gather all the materials, especially some rare materials that might not even be found on earth today.

However, after looking at the list of materials, Xia ruofei secretly heaved a sigh of relief. The materials on the list were not particularly difficult to find. Although the top – grade Jade and some precious metals were expensive, they were not a problem for Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei quickly memorized the puppet – making method.

Now that Xia ruofei’s brain was probably many times more developed than an ordinary person ‘s, it was not difficult for him to rote and memorize this piece of equipment refining experience.

In a short while, the puppet making method was engraved in Xia ruofei’s mind and he would never forget it.

Thus, he put down the book and left the bamboo house.

If he wanted to create a puppet that could help him, Xia ruofei felt that he still had a long way to go. There might be many difficulties and setbacks in the process, but Xia ruofei was not afraid of them.

It was only interesting to do challenging things!

Furthermore, Xia ruofei knew that once he successfully created one puppet, it would be much easier to create the second, the third, and even more puppets.

Xia ruofei drove the motorboat away from spirit map Island and returned to the shore.

“Master, how is it?” Xia Qing came forward and asked.

Xia ruofei forced a smile at Xia Qing and said,””You’re just giving me a big picture! Although the future looks great, it’s too difficult to achieve ...”

Xia Qing also thought that it would not be easy for Xia ruofei to successfully create a puppet at his current stage. He smiled and said,””Master, don’t be discouraged. Perhaps it’s not easy to evolve the spirit map world to the point where you can control any speck of dust in the space at will, or even to the point where you can even command it with your words. However, as long as you work hard and continuously improve your cultivation, it’s completely possible to refine a puppet!”
