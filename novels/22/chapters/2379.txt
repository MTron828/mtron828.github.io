2380 Taking in the captives (1)

When Xia ruofei arrived at the mountain and sea realm in the spirit map space, Bao Guijun, Qian guiyou, and the others were working hard in the herb garden. They had been following China’s time in the space. It was now three in the afternoon in arulei, which was about ninety in the morning in China. It was the morning working time.

After Xia ruofei entered the medium, Xia Qing immediately told Bao Guijun and the others to continue with their work. He flashed in front of Xia ruofei and called out respectfully,””Master, you’re here!”

Xia ruofei nodded slightly and said,”are the mobile houses in place?” This time, I’ve sent you a lot of manpower. You have to arrange and manage them well!”

“Yes! Thank you, master!” Xia Qing said as she bowed slightly.

Although Xia ruofei had captured more than 100 people in the past two days and locked them in small spatial cages, these spatial cages could be placed anywhere in this vast space, including high up in the sky.

As long as Xia ruofei didn’t want them to be discovered, no one in this space would be able to find them, including Xia Qing and Bai Qingqing. Even though Bai Qingqing could feel that the space fluctuations were different, she could not see what was going on inside the space cage.

In terms of understanding of the laws of space, Xia ruofei was definitely not as good as Bai Qingqing. However, in this world, he could be said to be invincible. This was his absolute control over the spirit map space.

Hence, even though there was such a huge commotion outside and Xia ruofei had captured so many people, Xia Qing and Bao Guijun did not notice at all.

Xia ruofei reached out his hand and grabbed something in the air.

Figures suddenly appeared in the sky and fell down, even temporarily covering the sky.

Bao Guijun and the others, who were working, were dumbfounded at the scene in front of them.

The new captives that Xia ruofei had just captured were scared out of their wits. They waved their hands and legs in the air in vain, but they could not find any place to hold on to. Their ears were filled with the sound of the wind and they could see the green earth approaching them quickly.

Most of these prisoners were captured from the training camp in the town of Basoko. Many of them were unconsciously captured in their sleep, and after waking up, they were trapped in such a narrow and monotonous space for more than a day. Many of them were on the verge of a mental breakdown.

Now that he had finally come out, he found that his situation seemed to be even worse. He was going to be smashed into meat patties!

Many people closed their eyes in despair.

However, at this moment, they felt a gentle force supporting their bodies, and then their falling momentum immediately slowed down, slowly landing on the ground.

Many people’s legs went soft, and they couldn’t stand at all, falling directly to the ground.

Bao Guijun and the others all stopped what they were doing. It wasn’t that they were slacking off, but that their brains had almost stopped thinking. They were completely dumbfounded.

Bao Guijun and the others could tell from the clothes of these newcomers that they were from the barsoco town training camp because Bao Guijun and the others had also come from there.

Moreover, that night, Bao Guijun and Huang rujue were taken to the outside world by Xia ruofei to act as temporary interpreters. They could more or less guess what had happened.

However, they did not expect Xia ruofei to be so fierce. Looking at the scale, he must have wiped out the entire secret training camp in Basoko town!

The sharp – eyed Qian guiyou even noticed the person in charge of the training camp, the Golden Fox Metatron, in the crowd.

After these people landed, they discovered that their bodies were bound by an invisible force, and they could not move freely.

Xia ruofei glanced at them, then reached out his hand and grabbed Manzila out of the crowd.

Manzila saw Xia ruofei’s “grab” with his own eyes. He remembered that he had just performed the “grab” in front of Xia ruofei. Although it was both the use of spiritual power, Manzila had to admit that his performance was really child’s play when compared with Xia ruofei ‘s.

Xia ruofei pointed at Manzila and said to Xia Qing,””This person’s hands and feet are broken. Treat him a little. Don’t use too good of a medicine, just use the ready – made herbs planted in our medicine garden. Whether he can be cured or not will depend on his luck. ” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The scale of Xia ruofei’s herb garden continued to expand. Other than the herbs needed to produce the Jade skin cream and the heart – nourishing soup, some common herbs were also planted. It was not difficult for Xia Qing to use the herbs produced in the interspace to make some medicine.

In fact, Xia ruofei was not worried that Manzila would become disabled. It would be a waste of food to deal with a level 3 Qi cultivator in such an environment with rich spiritual energy. If he could not even deal with such a small injury, then his cultivation would have been in vain.

“Yes, master ...” Xia Qing said.

Not far from the edge of the herb garden, Bao Guijun and the others were curiously observing the situation. They were also chatting in low voices, “Who’s that old man? He looked so pitiful! My limbs are broken ...”

“He must have done something bad and was caught by master!”

“Looking at his wrinkled face, he shouldn’t be young! Can he really survive in this place?”

Although Bao Guijun and the others spoke softly, they could not hide from Xia ruofei’s ears.
