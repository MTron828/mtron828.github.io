Chapter 27: The Wolf King Strikes

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Xia Ruofei chuckled in embarrassment and said.

“Chief, aren’t I calling you now?”

“You won’t be looking for me if you don’t have something on right?” The person on the other end of the line snorted and said, “Tell me! Did you get into trouble?”

“The Wolf King knows me best!” Xia Ruofei giggled. “Boss, I’m handcuffed and being sent to the police station! Hurry up and save me!”

The voice on the other end of the line was suddenly grave.

“What’s going on? Tell me!”

The person Xia Ruofei called was his leader when he was serving in the army, the captain of the Wild Wolves Commando Team, Guo Zhan, codenamed “Wolf King”.

Xia Ruofei, who had a terminal illness after retiring, was basically waiting for death. After returning to his hometown, he had never contacted Guo Zhan again.

If he had not been forced into a corner by Li Zhengyi, Xia Ruofei would not have troubled the leader of his previous troop.

However, that day’s matter involved Hu Zi’s mother and Lin Qiao. Xia Ruofei had to protect them no matter what. He did not know anyone in the area, so he could only look for Guo Zhan.

“Yes! Wolf King,” Xia Ruofei replied.

Then he told Guo Zhan everything that had happened that day.

On the other end of the phone, Guo Zhan’s expression became uglier and uglier. His eyes were about to spit fire.

After Xia Ruofei finished reporting, Guo Zhan asked indifferently.

“Blood Wolf, are you saying that Wild Wolf’s family is already poor? And that little gangster has harassed Wild Wolf’s sister many times in the past?”

Wild Wolf was Hu Zi’s code name in the Lone Wolf commandos when he was alive.

“Yes,” Xia Ruofei said.

“That little hooligan insulted the Wild Wolf and the family of the martyrs today?” Guo Zhan’s voice was cold.

“Yes.”

“I understand,” Guo Zhan said. “I’ll handle this. You should do as you deem fit. I only have two requests: first, don’t kill anyone. Second, don’t forget that you’re part of the Lone Wolf commandos!”

Guo Zhan’s tone was very calm. However, Xia Ruofei had been with Guo Zhan for so many years. He knew very well that once Guo Zhan spoke in this tone, it meant that he was really angry, and someone was going to suffer.

“Understood!” Xia Ruofei said without hesitation.

With Guo Zhan’s words, Xia Ruofei had nothing to worry about.

He hung up with a relaxed expression. Li Zhengyi and Zhong Qiang looked at Xia Ruofei fiercely, but Xia Ruofei ignored them and held the auxiliary policeman hostage, a cold smile on his lips.

Little Island Village was not far from town. Soon, a police car with a siren drove into the courtyard of the Linhai Town police station.

As soon as the car stopped, Li Zhengyi jumped out and shouted.

“Men! Come out! All of you! Little Wang, go to the gun warehouse and take out all the guns and distribute them to everyone!”

When the police officers in the police station heard Li Zhengyi’s shouting, they all ran out of their offices. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

A police officer with two arrowheads and a one-star rank also hurried out. He frowned and asked.

“Deputy Director Li, what’s going on?”

This was Li Zhengyi’s immediate superior, Su Ruiwu, the director of the Linhai Town Police Station.

“Director Su, something terrible has happened. A suspect has taken our auxiliary police officer hostage during the escort. He’s in the police car right now!” Li Zhengyi said quickly.

“What?” Su Ruiwu was shocked.

He glanced at Zhong Qiang, who had gotten out of the car with Li Zhengyi. He frowned slightly and asked.

“This is your nephew, right? Why is he in the car?”

Li Zhengyi’s expression froze slightly. His eyes darted around before he said.

“Director Su, Zhong Qiang is the victim. He was beaten up in Little Island Village this morning. I brought him to identify the suspect!”

A trace of dissatisfaction appeared on Su Ruiwu’s face. He knew very well what kind of person Zhong Qiang was. He had also heard about Li Zhengyi’s dirty involvement in Little Island Village, but Li Zhengyi was usually sensible and never violated his interests, so he turned a blind eye.

He did not expect the matter to blow up so much this time. Even the auxiliary police were being held hostage. If he did not handle this well and caused the matter to blow up, he would definitely lose his reputation if someone died.

However, at this moment, Su Ruiwu was not in the mood to ask about Li Zhengyi’s matters. He came to the police car with a solemn expression and shouted after checking the situation.

“Will you release our comrade first, lad?”

“Are you powerful enough to call the shots here?” Xia Ruofei asked calmly.

“I’m Su Ruiwu, the director of the Linhai Police Station. I’m the person in charge here. You can feedback anything to me. Don’t go to the extreme!” Su Ruiwu quickly said.

Xia Ruofei pursed his lips and said.

“Then open the door!”

Su Ruiwu was stunned for a moment. He did not expect this suspect who was holding the auxiliary police hostage to be so easy to talk to. After a moment, he reacted and hurriedly gestured for a police officer to open the door from the back of the police car.

As soon as the door opened, the other auxiliary police officer in the iron cage rushed out as if he had been pardoned.

Xia Ruofei only smiled faintly and ignored him.

He said.

“Qiao’er, support Auntie and follow me closely!”

The matter had already blown up, and Lin Qiao had no idea what to do. At this moment, Xia Ruofei was the support for the two of them, so she quickly nodded.

Xia Ruofei gently nudged the auxiliary policeman again and said.

“Let’s go!”

Thus, Xia Ruofei used the handcuffs to strangle the auxiliary police officer, and the two of them got out of the police car one after another.

Lin Qiao supported her mother and followed closely behind Xia Ruofei.

As soon as the group got out of the car, Li Zhengyi felt as if he was facing a great enemy and instinctively reached for his gun at the side. He pulled it out and pointed it at Xia Ruofei.

“Release him immediately!”

Zhong Qiang also said proudly.

“You’re dead this time, boy!”

Xia Ruofei pursed his lips and exerted a little force with his hand. The kidnapped auxiliary police officer immediately let out a scream like a pig being slaughtered.

The purple-red mark on the auxiliary police officer’s neck was shocking. It was obvious how strong Xia Ruofei’s hand was.

“Put your guns away!” Su Ruiwu glared at Li Zhengyi and Zhong Qiang unhappily, then hurriedly said to Xia Ruofei, “Young man, don’t be rash. Let’s talk things over…”

Only then did Xia Ruofei relax a little and say lightly.

“Inspector Su, I need an interview room.”

“Young man, shouldn’t you release the person first?” Su Ruiwu advised. “You can feedback any situation to me. There’s no need to use this method…”

“I don’t want to repeat myself!” Xia Ruofei interrupted Su Ruiwu impatiently.

“You…” Su Ruiwu could not help but feel embarrassed by the young man’s retort.

However, given the current situation, Su Ruiwu had no other choice.

Scowling, he nodded and said.

“Okay, come with me!”

With that, he personally led the way. Xia Ruofei held the auxiliary police hostage and followed behind. Lin Qiao and Hu Zi’s mother followed closely behind Xia Ruofei.

Li Zhengyi and the gang of policemen looked at each other, but there was nothing they could do.

Soon, Su Ruiwu opened the door of an interrogation room and said.

“So this is our interrogation room, lad.”

Xia Ruofei nodded slightly and gestured for Lin Qiao and her mother to enter first. Then, he also walked in with the auxiliary policeman.

As soon as he entered the room, Xia Ruofei kicked the door of the interrogation room and closed it tightly.

Su Ruiwu did not give up in asking.

“Young man, let’s talk this through! There’s nothing that can’t be resolved. You don’t have to resort to such extreme measures, do you? Attacking a police officer is a serious crime! It’s not too late to stop…”

Xia Ruofei pursed his lips and said.

“Director Su, there’s plenty of time to talk, but not now. Just wait! Don’t worry, as long as you don’t act rashly, I won’t hurt your subordinate.”

At this point, Xia Ruofei paused and added.

“By the way, here’s a piece of advice: You should take the initiative and deal with some problems as early as possible. When it’s too late to settle them, you’ll regret it!”

After that, no matter what Su Ruiwu said, Xia Ruofei ignored him and stayed in the interrogation room calmly.

After Su Ruiwu probed a few times and saw that Xia Ruofei did not respond, he could only instruct the police to guard it tightly before leaving the interrogation room resentfully.

He walked up to Li Zhengyi with a furious expression and scolded him. Li Zhengyi was stunned and wanted to explain, but he could not get a word in.

After cursing enough, Su Ruiwu asked hatefully.

“Tell me! How do we end this now?”

Li Zhengyi thought for a moment, then said.

“Director Su, actually, we can look at the bright side. Although this kid has a hostage, we blocked him in the interrogation room. Even if he has three heads and six arms, he won’t be able to escape.”

“Are you stupid! He doesn’t even want to escape, okay?” Su Ruiwu couldn’t help but get angry again.

It was obvious that Xia Ruofei wanted an interrogation room because he wanted to use the location to deal with the police.

The interrogation room had no windows, only a steel door. The room had almost no blind spots, and with a hostage in his hand, he was practically invincible.

“Well…” Li Zhengyi was lost for words for a moment. Then he said, “Director Su, we’ll have to ask the county office for help. Let the Criminal Police Brigade deal with him!”

Su Ruiwu looked at Li Zhengyi and wanted to slap him.

If this matter was reported to the county office, no matter what the outcome was, he as a supervisor would definitely be held responsible.

However, the police station really could not handle the situation.

Su Ruiwu thought for a moment and said coldly.

“You’re the one who caused this. Call the county office and report this!”

After saying that, Su Ruiwu turned around and left without looking back.

However, Su Ruiwu was only thinking about shirking his responsibility and had completely ignored Xia Ruofei’s meaningful last few words.

“Director Su…” Li Zhengyi called weakly from behind, but Su Ruiwu did not stop walking and ignored him.

Li Zhengyi and Zhong Qiang looked at each other.

“Qiang, you’ve screwed me over this time…”

“Uncle…” Zhong Qiang gritted his teeth and said,” Since Director Su has said so, let’s inform the county office! This kid has committed a huge crime. It’s enough to kill him on the spot! ”

Zhong Qiang had long hated Xia Ruofei to the core and wanted him dead. To him, the current situation was a very good opportunity.

As for how Su Ruiwu and Li Zhengyi would be dealt with, he did not care at all.

Li Zhengyi sighed and said.

“That’s the only way. I’ll call Chief Zheng!”

He picked up his phone and went to the side to call Chief Zheng.

Meanwhile, hundreds of kilometers away in Jinling, a huge storm was brewing. The target of the storm was this small Linhai Town police station…
