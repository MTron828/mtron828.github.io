“Of course not!” Zhou leiyun said,”I’m not an idiot! That sports daily reports that involve Spanish clubs are all weird and have never been objective or neutral. I can’t wait for them to close down tomorrow!”

“Then isn’t it settled?” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”this is equivalent to giving you a surprise!”

Zhou leiyun smiled.”Then why didn’t you tell me that you were going to play in a match this weekend?” he asked.

“This is called double the surprise!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”you’re not going to object to me participating again, are you? Besides, you’re the club chairman, and you never care about the manager’s formation! As long as Ruby is willing to put me in the lineup, it will be fine!”

“I don’t care about the other players!” Zhou leiyun smiled bitterly.”Can you be like the other players? But you’re right, I welcome you with open arms if you’re willing to stay and participate in the competition! From my point of view, it would be best if you could participate in every round of the competition! Even though I know it’s impossible ...”

“Hahaha!” Xia ruofei said,”I’ve calculated it. If we can defeat Herona in the next round, we’ll have a high chance of getting into the top seven!”

Zhou leiyun nodded and said,”yeah!” In fact, it was mainly because the three points from the last round were completely unexpected. We were prepared to lose the game against bar?a. Maybe at the end of the season, we will find that these three points are really precious! Who knows, maybe one of the spots in the European tournament will be decided!”

“Herona’s performance this season has been very poor, especially in the away game!” Xia ruofei said,”and now that our Spanish team’s morale is high, it’s not a big problem to take them down with the home – court advantage! So I’ll talk to Ruby. I hope to get more chances to take the ball and shoot in this game ...”

At this point, Xia ruofei’s eyes lit up.

Zhou leiyun was slightly taken aback, but then he smiled and said,””It seems like you’re going to use this match to make those suspicious voices completely disappear!”

“It’s a must!” Xia ruofei nodded.

“Looks like I’ll have to mourn for Herona in advance ...” Zhou leiyun laughed.

……

After the Spanish club’s press conference ended, the news of the press conference was spread through the internet media at once.

Jiang Xiaochen’s statement on behalf of the club did not cause too much of a stir. After all, it was just a normal statement. Any club in the Spanish position would probably make a similar statement when they encountered this kind of situation. There was nothing special about it.

However, the two pieces of news that Xia ruofei had released were like a stone that caused a thousand ripples. It attracted a lot of attention in an instant.

The club’s press officer was very efficient. He sent the video directly to the computer in the control room of the conference hall, using group email, to the media reporters who had left their e – mails.

Some of the reporters were still on their way back, but they had already received the video file. When their news reports came out, they would basically be able to match the video.

Therefore, Mayes’s video quickly spread on the internet like a virus.

At first, it was only in Catalonia. Soon, all the fans in Spain and all of Europe who were paying attention to La Liga had received push messages from various platforms and seen the video.

In an old apartment in Barcelona, Pablo was drinking and browsing the news on the internet. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

In just over a day’s time, he had become unkempt and unkempt, with an unkempt beard, which was very different from his previous image as an elite reporter.

He had basically stayed in the apartment for the past two days, but he was not isolated from the world. He had always been using the computer to understand the outside world, and he had also seen the criticism from the outside world.

Pablo was still a little relieved. In the Office of the Chief editor of The Sports Daily, he had thought of a way to stop losses at the critical moment. Although he still couldn’t keep his job, at least he didn’t have to wear the hat of a fake news maker. After all, Yingying, who could still continue to work in the news industry in the future, didn’t know any other skills besides sports news interviews.

Pablo sent an email to a college classmate on the day he was fired by The Sports Daily.

His classmate was now in the media industry as well. He was a reporter for team news in Spain was in charge of interviewing La Liga players.

His classmate was the manager of a team, which was equivalent to the station manager of a reporter station here.

Pablo hoped to get a position in team news, even if it was far away from Spain or other European countries.

After all, the level of team news was much higher than that of The Sports Daily. If he could be hired, it would be quite a high level.

After his classmates learned about his situation, they said that they would try their best to mediate. They also said that if there was no obvious bad record, there was still a good chance.

Thus, Pablo had been waiting for his classmates ‘notice for the past two days.

Pablo raised his glass and finished the remaining wine in it. He stared at the computer screen in front of him, which was the official Facebook page of The Sports Daily. There were many comments left by fans and netizens, giving various criticisms to The Sports Daily.

Pablo revealed a cold smile and muttered to himself,”Even if you guys force me to resign, I still can’t avoid the public’s scolding, right? I’ll just take the opportunity to change the environment! As long as team news is willing to hire me, I’ll go far away to France. I’ll leave the mess here to you to clean up!”

At this moment, Pablo’s phone rang. He grabbed it, and when he saw the name on the screen, a smile appeared on his face.

Pablo hurriedly picked it up and said,””Thelnio! Did the headquarters of team report give you a reply?”

The unhappy voice of his classmate from Pablo University, thelnio, came from the phone.”Pablo! I’ve been screwed over by you this time! How could you do such a thing?”

Pablo was stunned for a moment before asking,””I don’t understand what you mean ... How did I trick you?”

Sarnio snorted and said,””Don’t you know what you’ve done? To think that I trusted you so much and sent your resume to the headquarters at the first moment! In the end, I was scolded by my superior today!”

“This ...” Pablo was confused.”Cernio, is there something wrong with my resume?”

“Go online and take a look yourself!” Sario said impatiently. Also, don’t contact me anymore!”

Pablo heard the busy tone from the phone, and an ominous feeling rose in his mind.

He quickly threw his phone down and rushed to the computer, quickly opening a browser.

Pablo did not look at the official website of his former owner, the daily sports, because he knew that if the matter of him bribing Mayers was exposed, it would definitely not be reported in the daily sports. So, he clicked on the official website of the daily sports’s biggest competitor in Catalonia, the sports world.

When he saw a piece of news that had just been published by World Sports on the website, his mind buzzed. With trembling hands, he clicked on the title of the article,”shocking scandal!” The daily sports reporter> spent money to produce a press release for fake news.

After entering the reading page, Mayes’s video began to play on its own.

Pablo’s face was ashen as he stared at the computer screen. The video hadn’t even finished playing, but he had already collapsed in his chair, his heart completely disheartened.

Pablo only had one thought: It’s over ... It’s over ... This time, it’s completely over ...

Just like Pablo, there was another person who was feeling the same way. That person was Mayers ...
