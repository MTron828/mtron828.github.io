“Although the value of this batch of Chi – amassing pills is much higher than I expected, it may be a little difficult to compete for the storage rings if we only rely on the spirit stones exchanged for the Chi – amassing pills,” Xia ruofei said,”that’s why I’m planning to sell something more. I have some pretty good talismans on hand. Qingfeng, you’re more familiar with the situation, so tell me what kind of talismans are more popular and can be easily sold for a high price?”

“Master,” Luo Qingfeng said.”Actually, as long as it’s a talisman array, it’s very rare. No matter what type of talisman array it is, as long as it’s of good quality, it’s generally not cheap.”

The biggest advantage of talismans was that they were convenient. It didn’t require the user to have a high level of array Dao because the person who made the talismans had already fixed the array in the Jade stone. The user only needed to arrange it in a specific position. Some didn’t even need to be activated by mental power. Once it was placed in a specific position, the array would be activated automatically.

This way, it greatly lowered the threshold of use. It allowed cultivators who weren’t proficient in array Dao to use array techniques.

As a result, the price of talismans had always been relatively high.

In particular, there were fewer and fewer array Masters in recent years. The loss of inheritances led to the loss of many array techniques. Some array talismans excavated from some historical remains were sold for sky – High prices.

“Relatively speaking, spirit – gathering array talismans should be the most popular,” Luo Qingfeng continued.”I’m sure you know the reason for this, master.”

Xia ruofei nodded and smiled.””Indeed, the spirit gathering talisman is probably the best seller.” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

With the deterioration of the Earth’s cultivation environment, cultivators could not even cultivate at any time and place. Every day, there were only two periods of time, one at midnight and one at seven at night, where the spiritual energy was relatively peaceful. If there were no natural arrays or blessed lands like the Paradise Island, cultivators could only cultivate during these two periods. It was easy to imagine the low efficiency.

On the other hand, the spirit gathering array could purify the heterogeneous spirit Qi and increase the concentration of spirit Qi, allowing cultivators to cultivate at all times. This was of great help to cultivators who lacked resources.

Xia ruofei continued,”however, the spirit gathering talisman is relatively easy to make. I think there should be a lot of them in stock in the cultivation world!” The rarer something is, the more valuable it is. ”

“Master,” Luo Qingfeng said with a smile,”there are indeed more spirit – gathering talismans than other types of talismans. Even our star Seizer sect has a set of spirit – gathering talismans. But it’s precisely because they have a wider range of uses that there are so many of them in the world! And compared to the number of people in the world of cultivation, spirit gathering talismans are still very rare. As long as you take it out for auction, you don’t have to worry about not being able to get a good price!”

Xia ruofei saw that Luo Qingfeng was so certain, so he nodded and said,””Since that’s the case, I’ll take one Spirit gathering talisman!”

Xia ruofei sighed and said,””I do have a ready – made spirit gathering talisman on hand, but ... In order to sell it for a high price, I’ll modify it a little!”

With that, Xia ruofei flipped his hand and took out a set of spirit gathering talismans that he had used before.

As Luo Qingfeng had said, the spirit – gathering talisman was the most widely used. Hence, Xia ruofei had obtained several methods of making the spirit – gathering talisman from the Jade talisman of inheritance.

The set of spirit gathering talismans that he took out was a set of relatively higher quality talismans. The array technique that was sealed within the talisman was also more exquisite.

However, there were actually two versions of this talisman. The one he had taken out was only the simplified version. He planned to modify it into an advanced version based on the foundation of this talisman.

These two versions were originally from the same source, and the basic principles were exactly the same. There were not many changes, and it was completely possible to directly upgrade the simplified version.

In fact, the biggest difference between the advanced version and the simplified version was that the advanced version had three slots for spirit stones.

In the past, Xia ruofei had never used such low – end cultivation resources like spiritual stones. Hence, when he carved the array talismans, he naturally would not choose the ones with spiritual stone grooves.

The advanced version of the spirit stone groove did not directly absorb the spiritual Qi of the spirit stone. The spiritual Qi contained in the spirit stone was very limited, and the spiritual Qi of three spirit stones was just a cup of water on a burning cart of firewood. The spirit stones were mostly used to power arrays, and the version with spirit stone grooves had a lower threshold of use. There was almost no requirement for spiritual power, which was the kind mentioned earlier. As long as there was no mistake in the arrangement, the spirit stones would operate automatically.

In addition, the advanced version of the spirit stone – driven spirit gathering array had also been upgraded to a certain extent, and the efficiency of gathering spirit Qi was relatively higher than the previous simplified version.

Since it was not difficult to modify, Xia ruofei decided to take out this set of talismans and upgrade it. Then, he would give it to Luo Qingfeng to auction.

When Luo Qingfeng and Li Yifu saw that Xia ruofei was going to draw a talisman on the spot, they could not help but open their eyes wide and stare at Xia ruofei. They were afraid that they would miss this rare opportunity to learn.

Xia ruofei had no intention of hiding anything. He smiled and with a thought, the main array talisman floated in front of him.

He moved his fingers as if they were flying, and lines of light patterns flashed and disappeared, entering the main array talisman at an extremely fast speed.

Luo Qingfeng and Li Yifu could both sense the subtle changes in the complicated array runes within the main array talisman ...
