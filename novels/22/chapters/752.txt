Chapter 753: Chapter 506 – hidden skill and fame (2)

“Alright, alright, alright!” The manager said,”then I’ll have to trouble you!”

Lin Qiao nodded slightly and then walked back to the private room with faster steps.

In the crowd, she found the class monitor who was singing with others. After Lin Qiao told him what happened, the class monitor sobered up and hurriedly led a few people out.

After confirming that the two unlucky guys who had been stung by the Hornet were really Xue Fei and Hu Lili, the party naturally couldn’t continue.

However, there was no need for all 40 people in the class to stay, and the scene was quite chaotic. The class leader who was in charge of organizing the event left a few boys to help, and then asked the students who were familiar with Xue Fei and Hu Lili to inform their parents.

As for the rest of the people, they naturally went back to their own homes to find their mothers.

The class monitor was quite responsible. He didn’t forget what he had said before. He even arranged for boys to send some girls whose homes were further and more remote.

Of course, he did it for the sake of safety. Xue Fei and Hu Lili’s incident had already happened today. If any girl went home and encountered any safety issues, he, as the party organizer, would have to bear the blame.

However, Lin Qiao’s home was in the city, so she declined the class monitor’s offer to send her back. She said that her home was not far from here and she could take a taxi back.

The class monitor was busy and didn’t care much. After reminding Lin Qiao to be careful, he let her go.

After Lin Qiao left, she hailed a taxi and went back to the dormitory in the forestry Bureau.

Meanwhile, Xia ruofei had already taken advantage of the chaos to recall all the Hornets back into the spirit map space.

He put his laptop into the spirit map space, and then his phone rang.

......

“Brother Xia, Lin Qiao went out alone and took a taxi.” Lei Hu replied,”I’m following behind in the car with little song.”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes, thank you!” Report to me after Qiao’ er has safely entered the house. ”

“Understood!” Lei Hu said.

He couldn’t help but sigh in his heart, brother Xia’s love for Lin Qiao is really unspeakable! This silly girl didn’t know that brother Xia had done so much work behind the scenes, nor did she know that she had almost fallen into a dangerous situation! Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Lei Hu and the other veterans were very clear about the relationship between Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao’s family. Hence, Lei Hu was very touched. He was full of admiration for Xia ruofei’s act of taking care of the will of martyrs and the families of his comrades and brothers.

Just as Lei Hu was about to hang up, Xia ruofei said,””The other brothers are still waiting for orders downstairs, right? Let them all come up! I’m in Room 605. ”

“Brother Xia, this is ...”

“The private rooms have already been reserved. Brothers, come up and sing a song!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”come over after you escort Qiao’ er home. I’ll order some food and wine first!”

“Yes!” Lei Hu’s heart warmed as he replied. Brother Xia!”

After a while, four or five veterans came to Room 605. Xia ruofei pressed the service bell and asked the waiter to bring a few boxes of beer. He also ordered some dishes that went with the beer and a large bowl of seafood noodles for each person. The Xuanji nightclub mostly sold marinade, side dishes, and snacks. There were not many staple foods to choose from.

Xia ruofei personally gave them a toast to thank them for their hard work over the past two days. Then, he invited everyone to eat their noodles first.

Ten minutes later, Lei Hu called. Lin Qiao had arrived home safely.

When Lei Hu arrived at Room 605, Xia ruofei picked up another can of beer and said,””Brothers, it’s been hard on everyone these two days! I’ll give you another toast!”

The ex – soldiers agreed and raised their beer.

Xia ruofei gulped down the can of beer and said with a smile,””Everyone, start singing! Let’s drink the wine!”

Then, he said to Lei Hu,”Hu, I still have something to do, so I’ll go back first. Treat the brothers to a good meal and drink. I’ve paid for the private room. You can play until the closing time!” Don’t arrange for our brothers who will be participating in today’s operation to take turns tomorrow!”

“Alright, brother Xia, take care!” Lei Hu quickly said.

Xia ruofei nodded and took out a stack of hundred – Yuan bills from his wallet. He handed it to Lei Hu and said,”If you don’t have enough wine, continue to shout. In short, everyone must eat and drink well!”

“No, no, we can’t drink that much ...” Lei Hu quickly declined.

Xia ruofei laughed and scolded,”nonsense!” This wine is not even enough for you to drink alone! They were all trained in the Army, who didn’t know who? You can’t go back until you finish spending this money!”

Lei Hu grinned as he took the money and said,”Yes! Thank you, brother Xia!”

The ex – soldiers also expressed their thanks loudly.

Xia ruofei waved to everyone and walked towards the door. After two steps, he turned back and said,””It’s fine if everyone drinks, but you’re not allowed to drive under the influence of alcohol! Remember to call for a designated driver!”

For this operation, Lei Hu had rented a seven – seater van, which was why Xia ruofei had reminded him.

“Understood!” Lei Hu and the others said with a smile.

Xia ruofei remembered that this was a nightclub and couldn’t help but remind her,””By the way, it’s fine for everyone to drink and sing, but you can’t call her miss! That’s a matter of principle!”

Lei Hu immediately smiled and said,”don’t worry, brother Xia!” We’re all long – tested revolutionary soldiers, and we’ll never be corrupted!”

The ex – soldiers all laughed out loud.

Xia ruofei also knew that it was the happiest thing for the old soldiers to gather together to drink, brag, and sing military songs. It would be an eyesore to ask a few men to accompany them to drink and flirt, so he was not worried. He just gave them a reminder.
