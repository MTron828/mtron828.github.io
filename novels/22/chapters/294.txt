After elder song finished speaking, du Xiaohai immediately said sincerely,”Chief, your criticism is right! We must correct it immediately and start from grasping our work style. We will firmly play the two cards of tourism and tea culture. As for the chaos in some industries, we will immediately come up with effective measures to rectify it!” Although Lei Yong was the leader of the Provincial Party Committee, he was mainly in charge of Political and Legal Affairs. The purpose of his visit this time was only to deal with emergencies, so he didn’t say much about the deeper problems raised by elder song. He only expressed his position on behalf of the Provincial Party Committee. Songping city’s Secretary of the committee of judges also made a similar statement. After elder song heard this, he calmly nodded. “It’s good that you have such an attitude. “Our party’s cadres must calm their hearts and truly do practical and good things for the common people. Their views on achievements can not be biased, otherwise, the achievements they make will only be bright on the outside, but unbearable on the inside!” “Yes, chief. We will definitely remember your teachings!” Du Xiaohai said. The atmosphere eased up a lot after they were done talking about business. Lei Yong and the others also heaved a sigh of relief. At this moment, du Xiaohai gathered his courage and reported,””Bureau chief, after the sudden interrogation last night, the crimes of Wu De and the rest are basically clear ...” After saying that, du Xiaohai handed over the report that he had personally written overnight. Elder song waved his hand.”I won’t read the report. I believe that you will use the law as a guide and deal with this matter fairly and appropriately.” “Yes! We will definitely follow the instructions of the Bureau chief and severely punish the people involved in the case!” Du Xiaohai said. Lei Yong also reported,”chief, our Provincial party’s political and legal Committee and the provincial Public Security Department have also specially mobilized capable personnel to guide the trial of this case in Mount Wu Yi. In addition, I have also instructed the relevant leaders of the provincial Procuratorate and provincial High Court to guide the follow – up prosecution and trial work. We will definitely handle this case with irrefutable evidence.” Elder song nodded slightly and said,”yes, a rigorous working attitude is good. We can’t blindly be serious and fast just because this case involves me and my friends. Governing the country according to law must be implemented in every detail. Everything must be based on the law!” “I understand! Don’t worry, we’ll definitely carry out your instructions!” Lei Jun immediately said. He was also secretly glad that he had made sufficient preparations. He had also understood elder song’s nature and characteristics in advance. He knew that elder song was an old general who hated evil as if it were his enemy and was full of righteousness. Therefore, he did not make any harsh words about how to punish him. Instead, he reported it from the perspective of procedural justice. The facts proved that this was exactly in line with elder song’s philosophy. After talking about the case, du Xiaoyu said,””Chief, there are two things I need to ask you. The first is that our municipal government hopes to hire li Zhifu as a Senior Consultant for the tea culture industry in Wuyi Mountain. Regarding the tea of our city ...” “I don’t think so.” Elder song waved his hand.”Based on my understanding of li Zhifu, he won’t agree to such an honorary position.” Elder song continued,”if you really want li Zhifu to make full use of his talents, I suggest that he be a teacher.” As far as I know, there’s a tea – making major in your city’s vocational school. Comrade Zhifu’s tea – making skills have been passed down from generation to generation. If we can invite him to the school to give a lecture, it would be a very good inheritance. ” “That’s a good idea, chief!”Du Xiaohai was overjoyed. We can also choose a few students with better comprehension and let them follow Mr. Li Zhifu, just like a Master Teaching his disciples in the old society. At the same time, they can also take care of Mr. Li’s daily life. It can be said to be killing two birds with one stone!” “That’s a good idea,”said eccentric song with a smile. However, it’s hard to say whether comrade Zhifu will agree to it. I’ll mention it to him. ” “Thank you! Thank you, chief!” Du Xiaohai said excitedly. “You just said you have two things to ask. What else?” eccentric song asked with a faint smile. “Oh! Du Xiaohai hesitated for a moment and said,”chief, I was thinking ... Since you’ve come to our Wuyi Mountain, I’d like to invite you to inspect and guide us in our city, especially some of the iconic locations of the tea culture industry, such as the Jiulong Ridge ...” Xia ruofei, who had been silent all this while, could not help but ask,””Secretary du, is the nine Dragon carriage where the six Da Hong Pao parent trees are located?” When du Xiaohai asked for permission, he was worried that elder song would reject him. Now that Xia ruofei was suddenly very interested, du Xiaohai quickly nodded and said,”Yes, yes. The six most famous Da Hong Pao parent trees in WYS city are located in jiulongyao, West of Yongle Zen temple in the northeast of our city. The older generation of revolutionaries also had a lot of praise for the Da Hong Pao grown from the parent trees. Old chief Zhu even wrote poems for them.” Elder song had almost blurted out his rejection. He didn’t like welcoming and sending people off, especially after retirement. Every time they went to a place, the local officials would always ask the Chief to inspect and guide them. In comparison, he preferred to walk around without being disturbed. This way, he could see more of the real situation. However, Master Song saw that Xia ruofei seemed to be very interested in the mother tree, Da Hong Pao. Du Xiaohai’s story about master Zhu’s poem also piqued his interest. He had been in the military for his entire life, so he was naturally full of respect for the highest commander in the Army. The place where the commander – in – chief had been to and praised the tea, he also had the idea of going to take a look. Seeing this, du Xiaohai quickly struck while the iron was hot.”Chief, we have an ecological tea plantation and a tea art school near Jiulong District. We would like to ask for your guidance.” “I’m just a layman, what guidance can I give you?”elder song couldn’t help but laugh. Du Xiaoyu smiled awkwardly and didn’t dare to answer. Just when he thought elder song was going to refuse, elder song said,””Since you’re here, there’s no harm in taking a look. However, I can go and take a look, but you guys are not allowed to do anything ostentatious such as police cars clearing the way, road intersections sealing, scenic spots clearing, etc. You are not allowed to do anything! We can’t disturb the residents, so let’s go there quietly and not alarm the local people and tourists. ” “Yes!” Du Xiaohai said happily,”we’ll definitely follow the chief’s instructions!” Du Xiaohai then asked tentatively,””Bureau chief, then ... Do you think we should invite Mr. Li Zhifu? He’s an expert in this area, and he can give us more guidance. ” “Forget it,” elder song muttered,”comrade Zhifu hasn’t been feeling well recently. Oh right, since we’ve come to this point, Secretary du, please personally arrange for a full body examination for comrade Zhifu at the best hospital in the city. ” “Alright, I’ll get it done immediately!” Du Xiaohai quickly said. “Well, since we’re going to the nine Dragon carriage, let’s set off in the morning!” Said eccentric song with a nod. He looked at the people in the room and said,””There’s no need for too many accompanying personnel. Don’t make a big fuss. Xiao Lu will stay here and accompany comrade Zhifu to the hospital. Xiao Xia and Xiao Rui will accompany me. The rest of you will be on standby at the hotel. ” Then, elder song turned to Lei Yong and said kindly,””Secretary Lei, I think one of you three can be my guide. What do you think?” “No problem,” Lei Yong quickly said,”then let little du go!” He’s the Secretary here, so he’s more familiar with all aspects. Secretary he and I will stay behind to deal with the case from yesterday. ” Secretary he was the Secretary of the song Ping City Committee. In fact, both Lei Yong and Secretary he wanted to show their faces to elder song, but since the Bureau chief had spoken, they naturally didn’t dare to force their way in. After all, objectively speaking, du Xiaohai was the most suitable candidate. Du Xiaohai was overjoyed. He secretly decided that even if he had to give it his all, he would make elder song’s trip to the nine Dragon carriage perfect and complete, to make up for the bad impression he had left in the leader’s heart because of his previous failure. Thus, the group set off immediately. Before they left, Xu Wu, who had stayed at the hotel to write a report, even gave his gun to Xia ruofei. He was still worried about what had happened the day before. Although the local government leaders were with them this time, he was still a little worried. The car was still the Mercedes – Benz, which was a specially made bulletproof vehicle. No car in the city was as safe as this one. The chauffeur was a capable man specially selected by Huang Fang. Du Xiaohai sat in the front passenger seat. This was not only a humble gesture, but also convenient for him to guide the driver. Xia ruofei was still sitting beside elder song. This way, he could ensure the safety of the general. As for song Rui, he could only sit in the back row again. After the car left the hotel, they first went out of the city in the northeast direction according to the navigation instructions. On the way, du Xiaohai kept explaining the situation to elder song. It was obvious that he was very familiar with the situation. Wherever the car passed, he explained it to elder song and some data was at his fingertips. Elder song also listened with interest. Sometimes, he would ask a question or two, to which du Xiaohai answered very calmly. Xia ruofei, who was sitting at the side, did not care about what du Xiaohai was talking about. His mind had already flown to the nine Dragon carriage. It was the location of the six mysterious Da Hong Pao parent trees. Xia ruofei had always wanted to plant top – grade tea trees in the spirit map space, and the mother tree, Da Hong Pao, was naturally the best choice. He didn’t know if he could get one or two tea tree branches this time ... Xia ruofei mumbled in his heart,’it doesn’t matter even if it’s not the standard ear – cutting method. As long as it’s a branch from the mother tree, the spirit map space will definitely be able to succeed!’ Hehe, it’d be best if each of the six trees had one or two branches. This was because Xia ruofei had checked the information. The six mother trees were not of the same species. Their leaf – shaped leaves and germination stages were all different. If he could collect all of them, he could replicate six different species of Dahongpao tea trees in the origin space. The quality could even surpass the mother tree on the Jiulong carriage! Xia ruofei was very excited just thinking about it!
