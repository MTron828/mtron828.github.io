Chapter 313: Top quality veined lines (1)

Everyone in the Liang family was shocked by elder Tang’s words. Even Xia ruofei could not help but raise his eyebrows in surprise. Elder Tang’s original price was ten million Chinese dollars, but it was suddenly changed to ten million US dollars. This was a six – fold difference! Although this piece of Phoebe zhennan material looked to be of extremely high quality, was it really worth that much money? 10 million US dollars, how many people could not earn that much money in a few lifetimes! Even Liang Weimin couldn’t help but say,”Uncle, the price you offered ...” “Do you all think that I’m asking for too much?” Elder Tang interrupted Liang Weimin with a smile as he looked around at everyone. The Liang family didn’t say anything, but from their expressions, it could be seen that they clearly felt that the price was a little too high. Elder Tang looked at Liang Weimin with a smile and asked,””For the people, it was your Lil Chao who helped me find this material. Tell me, how much do you think I should offer?” Liang Weimin looked at the Phoebe zhennan and then at Xia ruofei. Finally, he said,””Uncle, RUO Fei’s golden Nannan is indeed of high quality and can be considered a top – grade old material. What’s rare is that it’s a whole piece. But even so, I think ... 20 million Chinese dollars should be more appropriate.” “Hehe, 20 million?” Elder Tang smiled.”For the sake of the people, I’ll pay 30 million. As long as it’s of this quality, I’ll take as much as you have!” Xia ruofei stood up and smiled,””Elder Tang, it seems like I’m not as simple as I look!” Liang Weimin also came back to his senses, and he quickly asked,”Uncle, is there something more to this material? Please give me some pointers!” The other relatives of the Liang family also looked at elder Tang, hoping that he would give them some advice. Elder Tang smiled and walked up to the Phoebe zhennan. He pointed to the window and asked,””You guys should be able to tell that the texture of this material is very beautiful, right?” Everyone nodded in agreement. “Then tell me, what kind of pattern is this?” Elder Tang wasn’t in a hurry to answer everyone’s questions. Instead, he asked a question in return. Liang Weimin said with uncertainty,””Uncle, it should be the water ripples!” At this moment, another relative of the Liang family frowned and said,””I think it’s a little like Yingzi ...” In fact, whether it was the water ripples that Liang Weimin had mentioned or the galls that another person had mentioned, the fact that they had appeared on the Phoebe zhennan was already very precious. This meant that the golden threads in the Phoebe zhennan wood were distributed in patches, which was why they formed such patterns. Otherwise, there would only be sparse golden threads. However, neither the water ripples nor the galls were enough to increase the value of this material by more than six times. Elder Tang smiled faintly and said,””Both of you are quite close, but neither of you is correct!” “Uncle, this is ...” Liang Weimin asked. Elder Tang pointed at the patterns on the material and said,””First of all, this is definitely not a tumor. A tumor is formed by a lesion. However, this nanmu was very healthy when it was growing and did not have any lesions at all. As long as you look at it carefully, you will know that these are all naturally formed veins.” Elder Tang continued,”in reality, this is already a cloud pattern. Although it looks like a water ripple, its texture is smaller than the water ripple. It’s like clouds, very irregular. Look at this position, doesn’t it look like lightning and thunder?” Liang Weimin and the others looked at the spot that old master Tang pointed at. After a careful look, they all nodded. “Cloud – patterned material is worth much more than water – patterned material!” Elder Tang said with a smile. And this is only the tip of the iceberg ...” Elder Tang then pointed to the other parts of the wood and said,””There are more than 30 lumps on it, and the ones we’ve just cut out are the smaller ones. I have reason to believe that if the whole piece is cut out, it will give me a lot of surprises. There might even be a top – grade big wave!” Liang Weimin and the others couldn’t help but look aghast. If he really got the highest quality wave pattern, then 10 million dollars was really not expensive. In fact, it was too cheap! This was because the big waves were the best of the gold Phoebe Wood veins. It was shaped like a stormy sea, and the golden threads were fine and smooth like Jiangnan silk. It had the momentum of the waves, but also had a charming visual impact. None of the people present had ever seen such a top – grade material before because it was too rare. They had only seen it in pictures. However, just by looking at the pictures, one could feel the strong visual impact. In fact, such a large piece of material with high – Quality patterns like the cloud – colored pattern was basically worth 10 million US dollars. Of course, this price could only be obtained in an auction. However, if the core hidden in the bark and the edges could be carved with more beautiful patterns, then the price that elder Tang offered was really not too expensive. After listening to elder Tang’s explanation, everyone looked at Xia ruofei with envy. Liang Weihua and Liang Xiaojun were so jealous that they were about to go crazy. Xia ruofei had ruined their plan, and now he was going to make 10 million US dollars. How could the father and son be calm? At the same time, Liang Weihua felt a little scared. If elder Tang had really gone with the flow and made him pay for the extra money, he would have really lost a lot of money. Xia ruofei smiled.”Elder Tang, you’re so honest. If you didn’t tell us, we wouldn’t have been able to tell what’s so special about these patterns. You don’t have to pay such a high price.” “Honesty is the most important thing in business,” elder Tang said.”I’m sure you’re aware that I’m buying this goldthread Nannan material to make a longevity material for myself, brother Xia!” If it was obtained through deceptive means, how could I lie in it in peace after a hundred years?” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh. This old master Tang was really an interesting person. “How is it? Are you satisfied with this price, brother Xia?” Elder Tang smiled and said,”of course, you can also choose to open a few more Windows. If a higher quality rare pattern appears, we can discuss the price again.” Xia ruofei waved his hand without hesitation and said,””No need! If it wasn’t for that little incident just now, I would’ve sold it for 10 million Chinese dollars. It’s already very good that I can get six times the amount, one should be content with what they have!” “I’m content!”Elder Tang laughed. Brother Xia has a good attitude!” “Old man, it’s decided then!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”from now on, this piece of material is yours.” “Thank you! Thank you!” Elder Tang was overjoyed. After speaking, elder Tang gestured for his assistant to bring the checkbook over. At this moment, Liang Weimin suddenly said,””Uncle, wait!”
