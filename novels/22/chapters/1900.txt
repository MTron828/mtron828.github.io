Chapter 1901 Major progress (2)

Zeng Liang said,”F * ck ... Even the driver is so extravagant!” However, the possibility of what you said is quite high! Alright, I got it! I’ll be right back!”

“En,” Xu Yougang nodded and said,”you can go directly to the North exit of the community and meet Aijun! He’s keeping an eye on that area alone!”

“Understood!” Zeng Liang said.

Xu Yougang and the others were waiting quietly. The process was very boring, but for them who had been professionally trained, waiting was like eating a meal. Even if they sat in the car all day, they would not be anxious at all, and they would still work meticulously.

In the penthouse apartment of West Lake Mansion’s building 3, Liu haojun was already lying on the big bed in the master bedroom. Fang Chenchen, who was also naked, was curled up like a kitten beside him. She had a satisfied look on her face.

Of course, only Fang Chenchen herself knew how real her expression was and how fake it was.

In fact, Liu haojun’s unrestrained lust for women had long drained his body. Moreover, Fang Chenchen was at the age where her needs were the most exuberant. With Liu haojun’s few moves, it would be difficult for Fang Chenchen to satisfy her.

Fang Chenchen was just doing her job, and at the same time, she had to act like she couldn’t stand being criticized to satisfy Liu haojun’s vanity as a man.

“My dear, how come you’re so awesome here today!” Fang Chenchen said in a sweet voice,”I can’t take it anymore ...”

Ever since she became Liu haojun’s lover, Fang Chenchen had learned how to please the man in front of her, who was a powerful man in her eyes. As for her integrity and dignity, they had long been thrown away.

Liu haojun laughed and said,”we’re not even there yet!” Baby, don’t go back tonight. I’ll take you out for dinner later, and we’ll have another 300 rounds of battle tonight!”

Fang Chenchen pretended to be afraid and said,””Big brother Jun, I can’t stand your torture with my small body! You must take pity on me ...”

“Don’t worry, baby!” Liu haojun laughed heartily.”If I don’t pity you, who should I pity? By the way, one of my buddies is preparing for a new movie, and it’s mainly going to be shot in Heron Island. Haven’t you always wanted to enter the entertainment industry? I’ll give him a call later and reserve a role for you to test the waters!”

Fang Chenchen was overjoyed when she heard that. She kissed Liu haojun on the cheek and said,””Jun bro, you’re so good to me!”

Liu haojun laughed and said,”but I’ll say this first!” It’s impossible for you to be the first or second female lead. After all, you’ve never acted before ...”

“I know that. It’s my first time acting, so I don’t dare to hope for the female lead!” Fang Chenchen said quickly.

Liu haojun said leisurely,”of course, even if it’s a supporting role, there are more or less scenes. The importance is also not the same. As for what role can be given to you, then ... It will depend on your performance tonight!”

Fang Chenchen immediately showed a shy expression and said,””Brother Jun, you’re so bad! You only know how to bully me ...”

“Then, do you want a good role?” Liu haojun asked jokingly.

“I want to! Of course I want to!” Fang Chenchen said without thinking.

“Hehe, then you know what to do?” Liu haojun laughed evilly.

“Brother Jun, even if you didn’t ask me to, I’d still serve you well ...” Fang Chenchen said, embarrassed.

“Sensible!” Liu haojun snapped his fingers, stood up, and said,”let’s go, baby! Let’s go take a bath, and then big brother will take you to eat a big meal!”

……

As night fell, a red beetle car drove out of the main entrance of West Lake Mansion.

As usual, Xu Yougang picked up his camera to take pictures. At this time, he saw a familiar face in the frame of the camera. The car window was open. Liu haojun was sitting in the front passenger seat, and his left hand was on the thigh of the young woman who was driving.

Almost subconsciously, Xu Yougang pressed the shutter continuously, then threw the camera on the passenger seat and started the car.

In the back row, Wang Chong was fiddling with the equipment he had bought yesterday. Seeing this, he hurriedly asked,”Squad leader Xu, what’s the situation?”

Xu Yougang turned the steering wheel to drive the car out of the parking space as he said,””The target is in the beetle car in front!”

Wang Chong’s spirit was instantly lifted. He placed the miniature camera in his hand into his bag, then swiftly made his way to the front passenger seat and picked up the camera.

As Xu Yougang carefully followed the beetle from a distance, he said to Wang Chong,”Call liangzi and tell him what’s going on here. Tell them to drive over as well!” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Understood!”

Whether it was Fang Chenchen or Liu haojun, their anti – reconnaissance ability was almost zero. Moreover, Xu Yougang and Zeng Liang had rich tracking experience. The two cars often followed each other, so they did not notice at all.

They followed the car all the way to a Western restaurant about four kilometers away. Xu Yougang saw the beetlemon turn in from a distance. He immediately drove to a good spot on the side of the road outside the Western restaurant and stopped.

Behind the fence was the Western restaurant’s small parking lot.

Xu Yougang soon saw the red beetle reversed into the parking space under the command of the security guard. Liu haojun and Fang Chenchen got out of the car.

Liu haojun wrapped his arm around Fang Chenchen’s slender waist, and Fang Chenchen leaned on Liu haojun like a little bird. The two of them walked into the Western restaurant very intimately.

Xu Yougang’s long focus camera kept making shutter sounds, recording the intimate state of the two.

“Wang Chong, bring over the laptop!” Xu Yougang said.

“Alright!” Wang Chong took the laptop bag from the back seat, turned on the power, and passed it to Xu Yougang.

“I’ll direct the photos, you keep an eye on them!” Xu Yougang said.

“Understood!” Wang Chong said.

He turned to the back seat and closely watched the situation in the Western restaurant through the dark – colored window.

Xu Yougang transferred all the photos from the camera to the laptop.

He quickly found a few photos with their faces in the pile. The lens of this camera was very professional, and the hands were very stable when taking photos. The focus was also very accurate, so although the distance was a little far, the photos were still very clear.

Xu Yougang didn’t have many resources at his disposal, so he couldn’t find out the identity of the woman who was obviously close to Liu haojun through the license plate number. Therefore, he decided to start with these photos.

Nowadays, the mainstream search engine had a picture recognition function. Through the uploaded pictures, they could find similar online pictures, and they could even circle the comparison range and then list them in order of similarity.

Xu Yougang was ready to try this method to see if he could find out the identity of the young woman.

He opened Baidu picture search and uploaded one of the photos. He circled the young woman’s face and searched for her.

In fact, the success rate was not high, because it required the premise that the young woman’s photo was already on the internet.

This was a process of trying one’s luck. After all, social media was so developed now. Some people liked to post their photos on Weibo and other platforms. Who knew, they might get something out of it.

As it turned out, Xu Yougang was quite lucky.

Fang Chenchen was a foreign reporter, and later became a popular female live streamer on the City Channel. There were many photos of her on the internet.

The first photo that Xu You found was a recent photo of Fang Chenchen in the Feng Cai section of the City Channel.

There were also a bunch of photos, including some from the local forum and some news pictures of Fang Chenchen.

As soon as Xu You clicked on the source of the first photo, a smile appeared on his face as he looked through the photos of Fang Chenchen in the streamer’s elegance section. He immediately recognized the female streamer as the young woman who was with Liu haojun today!

Moreover, this program was originally meant to showcase the elegance of female streamers. Not only were there a set of photos of Fang Chenchen, but there was also a section of her resume.

It really didn’t take any effort at all!
