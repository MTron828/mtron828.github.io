Chapter 1250: It’s too exciting_1

Translator: 549690339

When the doorbell rang, both Xia ruofei and Monica were petrified. They froze in their tracks.

Now, one of them was naked, only wearing a pair of small underwear, while the other was wrapped in a bathrobe that could not cover her seductive figure. When they heard the doorbell, their hearts almost jumped out of their throats.

Xia ruofei slowly turned his head and noticed a small LCD screen on the wall. There were many such control terminals in the Presidential Suite to ensure that the guests could control it from a close distance.

Feng Jing was displayed on the LCD screen with a small plastic bag in her hand.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but sigh,”didn’t he send her away after dinner?” Why did the women return to the hotel so quickly? This didn’t make sense!

He didn’t realize that two to three hours had passed since he and Monica had been fooling around in the hotel.

And how could a strong woman like Feng Jing have the same brain circuits as an ordinary woman? She was not very interested in shopping, but she was dragged out by the girls, so she took a taxi back to the hotel after shopping for a while.

Xia ruofei quickly gestured for Monica to keep quiet. Monica nodded in understanding. The two of them did not even dare to move. They stood still and looked at the LCD screen nervously.

Xia ruofei thought that Feng Rao would probably think that he was not in the room and return to her room after the doorbell rang for a while.

The situation was just as he had predicted. Through the LCD screen, Xia ruofei saw Feng Jing ring the doorbell twice. After a while, a suspicious expression appeared on her face before she turned around and walked back.

Xia ruofei heaved a long sigh of relief.

However, before his expression could relax, he was shocked again.

Feng Rao, who was still in the video, took out her phone and dialed a number.

Xia ruofei’s heart skipped a beat. Everything happened so quickly that he had no time to react.

“Forward, forward, forward! Our team is facing the sun ...”

Xia ruofei’s unique ringtone suddenly rang loudly.

The worst thing was that when Xia ruofei opened the door for Monica, he had placed his phone on the shelf beside the door.

Then, the two of them kissed each other at the door and couldn’t wait to get into bed. His phone was left at the door.

Although the Presidential Suite’s sound insulation was good, the phone’s volume was set to the maximum. Furthermore, it was a very loud rock – and – Roll military song. It was hard for Feng Jing not to hear it even though there was only a door between them.

As expected, Xia ruofei saw the scene on the LCD screen. Feng Jing was stunned for a moment, then she walked back to the door and listened carefully.

Then, the doorbell rang again.

Obviously, Feng Jing had heard Xia ruofei’s phone ring.

Xia ruofei made a prompt decision and pointed to a room. Monica understood and immediately tiptoed into the room and locked the door.

‘Luckily, there are more rooms in the Presidential Suite,’ Xia ruofei thought to himself.

He didn’t have time to think about it. He quickly started to clean up the room as fast as he could. He even used his true Qi and mental power.

On the sofa in the living room, on the desk in the study room, on the floor of the bedroom ... His and Monica’s clothes were scattered everywhere.

Xia ruofei seemed to have transformed into a Superman who could teleport. He used his fastest speed to shuttle back and forth and stuffed all the clothes into an empty cabinet. Then, he picked up a shirt and fanned it hard, hoping that the smell in the room would spread out as much as possible.

Even though Xia ruofei was physically strong, he had done so many things in just one or two minutes. He was exhausted and drenched in sweat. Most importantly, he was scared.

His mind was spinning quickly, and he quickly picked up a bathrobe and put it on. Then he quickly went to the bathroom to wet his hair and picked up a towel.

Only then did she drag her slippers and walk to the door.

“They’re coming!” Xia ruofei replied loudly.

Opening the door, Xia ruofei asked while drying his hair,””President Feng? Why are you back so soon?”

“I rang the doorbell for a long time, so I thought you weren’t in the room!” Feng Rao laughed.

“Hehe ...” Xia ruofei laughed and said calmly,”I was in the shower and didn’t hear the sound of the water. Did you call my phone?” I can vaguely hear my phone ringing ...”

“Yup! If I didn’t call you, I wouldn’t have known you were in the room!” Feng ke said.

Then, she looked at Xia ruofei strangely and asked,””Chairman, what are you doing at the door? It’s ... Inconvenient for me to go in?”

Xia ruofei quickly replied,”how can that be?” It was convenient! It was convenient! Come in!”

After saying that, he quickly stepped aside to make way for her.

Feng Rao looked at Xia ruofei with a smile and walked into the Presidential Suite with the small bag.

“I saw a nice bag when I was shopping just now,” she said as she walked.”I bought one for you too. You can give it to your girlfriend when you go back!”

“Yo! You’re still thinking of me when you’re shopping!” Xia ruofei said absent – mindedly,”then I won’t stand on ceremony! I’ll thank you on behalf of Qingxue ...”

“Why are you being so polite with me?” Feng Jing said as she looked around.”Although it’s not the first time I’ve been to this suite, I still can’t help but exclaim how luxurious it is ...”
