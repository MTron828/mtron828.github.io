Chapter 412: Master Luo (1)

The midnight Dream bar was located on the North bank of Min River. Next to it was the river Beach that was full of tourists. It was not far from the old Min River dock. It used to be an old warehouse, but after the old dock left the stage of history, the warehouse had lost its original function. It was rented and transformed into the bar today.

The bar adopted a rough industrial design, and the original appearance of the entire building was almost completely preserved. The mottled concrete floor was full of potholes, the red brick wall left with the mark of time, the painted wall with mottled paint, and the irregular barbed wire ...

The outer wall of the bar was covered with unruly graffiti. After being blocked by the thick soundproof door, the loud music inside seemed a little dull.

Lu You stepped on the soft sand and walked to the entrance of the midnight Dream bar. After pushing the door open, the distant music seemed to be amplified by ten times. The intense sound waves made Lu You frown slightly. She didn’t like such a lively and noisy place.

However, she was in a rather low mood today. She only hesitated for a moment before walking into the bar.

The waiters holding trays walked through the crowd, the DJ shouted at the top of his lungs, and the people in the bar waved their arms and twisted their bodies willfully with the music. Under the swaying of the spotlights, the leisure and tranquility outside formed a sharp contrast, as if it was a strange and grotesque world.

Lu You walked through the crowd and came to the bar counter. She found an empty high stool and sat down.

“What would you like to drink, Madam?” The bartender asked with a smile.

“Wine!” Lu You said concisely.

The bartender was slightly stunned. Of course, she came to the bar to drink, but there were hundreds of types of alcohol here. What kind of alcohol was she going to drink?

A beautiful lady would always be treated well. The bartender did not get impatient because of this. He still had a warm smile on his face and asked,””May I ask what kind of wine you would like to drink?”

“Anything is fine, as long as you can get drunk.” Lu You said indifferently.

A strange look flashed in the bartender’s eyes. He nodded silently and then got busy behind the bar.

Very quickly, the bartender pushed a glass of wine in front of Lu You and said,””Please enjoy your Bacardi Rum.”

Lu You nodded silently. She raised her glass and took a look.

The glass of wine looked like plain water, colorless and transparent. There were a few pieces of ice floating on it. She brought it to her nose and sniffed. A strong smell of wine assailed her nose, making her feel a little dizzy.

It was hard liquor. Lu You nodded and took a big gulp from her glass.

The burning wine had a strong smell, like a ball of fire burning in his mouth. After he swallowed the wine, the burning feeling started to spread along his esophagus and into his stomach.

This was the first time Lu You had drunk such strong alcohol. She immediately coughed violently, and tears filled her eyes.

However, she showed a faint smile. After drinking the wine, the slight dizziness made her suddenly feel relaxed, as if all her troubles were beginning to slowly leave her.

Lu You took out a piece of tissue and wiped her mouth. She picked up the glass and took another sip.

This time, she didn’t take such a big gulp, and she was already mentally prepared. Her performance was much better than the first sip. Not only did she not cough, but she even showed a trace of enjoyment. She seemed to have experienced the beauty of this strong wine.

Lu You held the glass and drank it mouthful by mouthful. Very soon, the glass of wine was empty.

Her eyes became a little dazed, and under the effect of alcohol, two red clouds rose on her delicate face, making her even more charming and moving.

Lu You slammed the empty cup on the bar counter and shouted,””Another cup!”

“Please wait!” The bartender said.

He was already used to seeing such customers. Working in this kind of place, he could meet such single female customers who drank to drown their sorrows every day. However, the one today was a little too beautiful, and he couldn’t help but feel a trace of regret.

It was because he had already seen the gazes of several tables of customers glancing in Lu You’s direction. They were all regular customers of the bar and were also experienced in hunting for women. A few of them could meet different women here almost every day.

The beautiful girl in front of him was obviously not a regular at the bar. If she met those Masters of hunting for beauties, she would definitely be eaten up until not even her bones were left. It was just that he didn’t know which lucky guy would benefit from it.

As the bartender thought to himself, his hands did not stop. Very quickly, he pushed a glass of rum in front of Lu You.

Although he could predict what Lu You might encounter, the bartender couldn’t warn her. He knew that it would be useless even if he did. Furthermore, if he wanted to continue working here, he had to know when to speak and when to shut up.

Lu You picked up a new glass of wine. A few people at the table beside her exchanged glances. Then, a man in an expensive casual suit stood up and walked towards Lu You with a glass of wine in his hand.

The Man in the White Suit was quite good – looking. In addition to his branded clothes, he had a somewhat elegant appearance. He sat down on the high stool beside Lu You and leaned one hand on the bar counter. He turned to Lu You and revealed a smile that he thought was very charming. He raised his glass to Lu You.

“Miss, it’s so lonely to drink alone. Why don’t we have a chat?” The Man in the White Suit said.

Lu You didn’t even lift her eyelids. Her gaze was completely focused on the glass in her hand. She picked up the glass and took another sip of rum.

The Man in the White Suit was rebuffed, but he wasn’t discouraged. The smile on his face became brighter and he said,””Miss ...”

“Get lost!” Lu You coldly spat out a word.

The Man in the White Suit was stunned for a moment. A hint of anger flashed in his eyes, but he concealed it very well. He only smiled and shrugged his shoulders before leaving Lu You’s side.

When he returned to his seat, he looked at Lu You, who was in front of the bar, while talking to his companions. At that moment, his eyes revealed an undisguised desire.

Lu You was simply too beautiful. She was like a shining star in this bar. They naturally wouldn’t let go of such a top – grade product easily.

One after another, a few people who thought they were gentlemanly went up to strike up a conversation, but without exception, they were all rejected.

These people did not leave after being rebuffed. They just returned to their seats and observed silently, waiting for an opportunity.

He was waiting for Lu You to get drunk.

In fact, these experienced hunters knew very well that Lu You didn’t need anyone to persuade her to drink and add fuel to the fire. She would get drunk very soon, and their chance would come then.

The problem was that there were more wolves than meat, and it was not clear who would end up the winner.

The regular customers of these bars had even begun to observe their respective “opponents” in secret, hoping to seize the opportunity.

At this time, in a corner of the bar, a fierce – looking burly man took out his mobile phone and made a call.

“Master Luo, there’s a high – Quality item on the first floor. You’ll definitely be interested ...” The burly man said in a low voice while holding his phone.

After saying a few more words, he sent a photo with his phone.

……

The second floor of the bar was not open to the public, but there was a luxuriously decorated private room.

A man in his 30s was sitting on an expensive leather sofa. On his left and right were two scantily dressed girls, who were smiling and feeding lychees to the man.

There were also four black – clothed men standing in the private room. In the dimly lit private room, they were all wearing black sunglasses. Each of them had a cold expression and stood straight, turning a blind eye to everything in front of them. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

The man’s name was Fang Luo, and he was a natural – born Desperado.

Fang Luo’s past experience of dejection had also made him pay special attention to the enjoyment of life. He had never lacked women in his bed.

Today, Fang Luo had brought a few of his personal bodyguards to this Midnight Dream bar that belonged to him. Initially, he had just come to have some fun, but he had not expected to have an unexpected harvest.

One of his underlings who was having fun downstairs found a beautiful woman.

Fang Luo’s phone vibrated, and he retracted his large, rough hand. He picked up his phone and glanced at it, and his eyes lit up.

The lighting and the composition of the picture could be said to be an amateur among amateurs. However, the graceful figure and the side profile that was so exquisite that it was suffocating made Fang Luo’s hormones stir.

The corners of his mouth curled up into a smile as he raised his chin.

A burly Man in Black immediately came to his side and slightly lowered his body, shouting,””Master Luo, what are your orders?”

“Go down and find ah li.” Fang Luo said calmly. He then showed the photo on his phone to the Man in Black and said,”I want this woman to appear in my room tonight.”

“Yes!” The Man in Black replied respectfully, then turned around and quickly left the private room.

The lady next to Fang Luo saw the photo as well. She put her arms around Fang Luo’s neck and said coyly,””Master Luo, now that you have another beauty, do you not want her anymore?”

After she finished speaking, she laughed.

Fang Luo’s expression did not change at all. He said indifferently,””My bed is big enough for eight to ten people, but ...” He said.

At this point, a sharp glint flashed in Fang Luo’s eyes, and he slapped her as fast as lightning. He said coldly,””Since when is it your turn to comment on my matters, you slut?”

The woman’s teeth were loosened and blood was flowing out of the corner of her mouth from Fang Luo’s slap. However, she did not dare to make a sound. Her entire body was trembling uncontrollably, and her eyes were filled with extreme fear.

The other girl was also so scared that she kept quiet out of fear, not even daring to breathe.

Fang Luo stretched out his hand to caress the lady’s face and asked gently,””Does it hurt?”

The woman was so scared that she couldn’t say a word. Her body trembled involuntarily, and her eyes revealed a pleading look.

“You’re very scared?” A smile appeared on Fang Luo’s face as he asked calmly.

The woman nodded, then quickly shook her head, her face completely pale.

Fang Luo stretched out his hand and patted the lady’s face twice. He said indifferently,””Don’t be afraid, I’ve always been gentle to women ...”

“Master ... Master Luo ... Have mercy ...” The woman finally spoke as she begged.

“I told you, I’m very gentle to women. Why would I want your life?” With a smile on his face, Fang Luo said,”I’m going to be a groom again today. For the sake of my bride, you guys can get lost ...”

The two girls felt like they had been granted Amnesty and quickly said,””Yes ... Thank you, master Luo ... Thank you, master Luo ...”

After that, the two of them left the private room.

A cruel glint flashed in Fang Luo’s eyes as he ordered indifferently,””Send them to the Black Rock nightclub. If they can’t sell for a million, let them stay there!”

“Yes, master Luo!” A black – clothed man immediately responded and then went to make the arrangements.

……

On the first floor, the burly man who had called Fang Luo earlier stood up and walked toward Lu You.

Many people in the bar noticed this scene.

Including The Man in the White Suit, all the experienced beauties sighed in their hearts that Qianqian had wasted her efforts tonight. She definitely didn’t have a chance.

The frequent customers all knew the identity of the burly man. The people behind him were not people they could afford to offend. Since the burly man had made a move, this woman must have caught the eye of the fearsome master Luo.

They wouldn’t dare to have any ideas about the woman that master Luo had his eyes on.

Some people even started to leave. They were the people who had hit on Lu You before. These people were worried that master Luo would harm them, so they all left the bar as if they were escaping.

Lu You, on the other hand, was completely unaware of the approaching danger. She continued to drink her rum ...
