Chapter 1713: Haoran’s breakthrough (2)

The bottleneck of Qi disciple Level 1 was easily broken through by Tang Haoran.

“Don’t stop, continue to cultivate and consolidate your cultivation!” Xia ruofei’s voice was heard again.

Tang Haoran nodded slightly and continued to cultivate without any distractions. After the breakthrough, the total amount of true Qi had increased a lot, but his control of true Qi had decreased a little in comparison. However, this was only a normal phenomenon during the breakthrough. As he continued to control his true Qi and circulate it according to the mental cultivation method, those slightly violent true Qi quickly became well – behaved.

Over and over again, the true energy in Tang Haoran’s body became more and more submissive. His meridians, which had been widened due to the breakthrough, were also quickly consolidated in each Qi circulation.

At around 12 o’ clock in the evening, Tang Haoran’s realm had finally stabilized and he had successfully entered the realm of Qi disciple Level 2.

He opened his eyes, and the first thing he saw was Xia ruofei’s happy smile.

Xia ruofei patted Tang Haoran’s head and said,””Little fellow, well done! Tonight’s cultivation will end here. Go and rest first, tomorrow master will teach you the second level of the heart technique!”

The “scorching sun Scripture” that Xia ruofei had chosen for Tang Haoran could support him in his cultivation until he reached the foundation establishment stage. It was the most suitable cultivation method for Qi cultivation stage cultivators. Moreover, each level corresponded to a different heart technique. Previously, Xia ruofei had only taught Tang Haoran the first level of heart technique because he was worried that a child’s heart was not stable enough and would bite off more than he could chew.

Now that Tang Haoran had broken through to Qi disciple Level 2, which meant that he had already perfected the first stage of the Qi cultivation method, if he used the first stage of the Qi cultivation method to cultivate, the efficiency would be much lower for his current cultivation level. So, it was time to teach him the corresponding second stage of the Qi cultivation method.

Tang Haoran’s eyes lit up when he heard that.””Master, I’m not tired at all. I feel full of energy. Can you teach me now?”

Xia ruofei laughed and tapped his nose.”Even if you’re not tired, master is!”

Tang Haoran stuck out his tongue. His face was full of disbelief. In his eyes, his master was like a god. How could he get tired so easily?

After Xia ruofei made a joke, he said seriously,””Haoran, master has said more than once that cultivation must be done step by step, and there can’t be the slightest impatience! You’ve just made a breakthrough today and consolidated your cultivation base. Your body and spirit are already in a very tired state. It’s just that you haven’t noticed it. The only thing you need to do now is to rest well and conserve your energy! Even though I’ve given you crystals, I hope you can remember what I said before. It’s best if you don’t cultivate for more than four hours a day. I don’t want you to waste your talent because you’re too eager to succeed!”

“I’ll remember it, master!”Tang Haoran quickly said. Don’t worry, I’ll definitely be obedient! I’ll go rest now!”

Then, he quickly returned the spiritual crystal to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. The master and disciple duo walked out of the tea room.

Although Tang Yitian had gone to rest, he still arranged for a servant to wait at the entrance of the tea room. When the servant saw the two of them coming out, she hurriedly welcomed them and led Xia ruofei to the guest room that had already been prepared for them. Tang Haoran, on the other hand, went back to his own room with ease.

The next morning, Xia ruofei got up and cultivated for about an hour before he went to wash up.

Now that he was on the verge of a breakthrough, Xia ruofei did not relax in his cultivation. He was waiting for the right opportunity to officially enter Qi disciple Level 6.

By then, if Song Wei could break through again, she would have a great chance of dealing with the remaining peach blossom miasma.

Xia ruofei washed up, changed his clothes, and was ready to go out for breakfast.

As soon as he opened the door, Xia ruofei was shocked. Li Yifu was standing respectfully at his door.

“Good Morning, martial granduncle!” Li Yifu bowed to Xia ruofei respectfully.

“What are you doing, foster husband?” Xia ruofei could not help but ask.

Li Yifu revealed a matter – of – fact expression and said,””Senior granduncle, this disciple pays his respects to you!”

Xia ruofei could not help but smile bitterly,”there’s no need for that!” Foster husband, times have changed, and I’m a very casual person. I’m really not used to you waiting at the door every morning to pay my respects to me ...”

Xia ruofei’s seniority was so high, and his cultivation was also much higher than Li Yifu ‘s. To Li Yifu, this was the most basic courtesy. He revealed a hint of embarrassment and said,””Martial granduncle, you’re an elder of the sect, this etiquette can’t be abandoned!”

Xia ruofei glared at him and pretended to be angry.””My words don’t work? Alright, then I’ll order you in the name of my great uncle – Master to return to United States today! So that you don’t annoy me all day long ...”

Li Yifu was shocked and almost knelt down. He quickly apologized,””Martial granduncle, this disciple knows his mistake! Martial granduncle, please punish me! No matter what, please don’t expel this disciple. Let this disciple follow you ...”

Seeing Li Yifu’s fearful expression, Xia ruofei couldn’t bear it. He said,””Forget it, forget it, foster husband. You’re good at everything, but you have too many rules and are too old – fashioned ...”

Halfway through his sentence, Xia ruofei suddenly realized something. He couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows and ask,””What did you just say? Serve at his side? Don’t tell me you’re not leaving!”
