2588 The answer is obvious (1)

Xia ruofei followed Liu Qunfeng to the second floor. Old man Liu was still living in the same room, but compared to the time when Xia ruofei had come for a follow – up, the air was filled with tension. With a casual sweep of his spiritual power, he could find a few guards.

Obviously, the Liu family also suspected that there was a human factor in the deterioration of old master Liu’s condition.

In addition to the security personnel, there were also many medical staff here.

In the past, when Xia ruofei had treated elder Liu, the effect was very obvious, so the Liu family had only left two health doctors and a few nurses in this house. Now, they had a medical team stationed in the house, and they were all experts from Room 301.

After entering the room, two doctors were checking the data of the life support equipment. Old man Liu was lying on the bed with his eyes closed and his face ashen. He had already been put on a ventilator.

The room was very quiet. Other than the rhythmic beeping of the instrument, no one spoke. The air was heavy.

The two doctors greeted Liu Qunfeng with a nod.

Liu Qunfeng knew Xia ruofei’s rules, so he whispered to them,””Dr. Hu, Dr. Zhang, please go to the next room to rest for a while.”

The two doctors nodded and left the room with the nurse.

At Liu Qunfeng’s signal, the two men in charge of security also left silently.

Then, Liu Qunfeng said to Xia ruofei,””Mr. Xia, I’ll leave this place to you!”

Then, Liu Qunfeng bowed deeply to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei glanced at Liu Qunfeng. Compared to the first time he saw him, he looked much older.

As he bowed, Xia ruofei could see his white hair even more clearly.

Of course, Xia ruofei also knew that Liu Qunfeng looked so Haggard because, on the one hand, he was mentally and physically exhausted from old master Liu’s repeated illness. On the other hand, it was because of the pain of losing his son. It was a huge blow to him.

Xia ruofei replied calmly,”you’re too kind. It’s my duty to treat elder Liu. Don’t worry. I’ll find out the reason for his relapse as soon as possible and do my best to treat him.” If ... It’s really beyond my power, I’ll definitely give the Liu family an explanation. ”

Liu Qunfeng looked embarrassed and said,””Mr. Xia, you’re too kind. You’ve treated my father very successfully, and everyone has seen it. Even if it was ... We would never blame you.”

At a time like this, Liu Qunfeng naturally had to do his best to flatter Xia ruofei. Otherwise, if this man really quit, then elder Liu would definitely be dead.

In the past two days, the expert team from Room 301 had tried everything they could, but they still couldn’t stop the deterioration of elder Liu’s condition. They watched as the old man’s vital signs weakened bit by bit, and the tumor cells in his body began to wreak havoc again.

Pancreatic cancer was a very dangerous disease, and it developed very quickly. In a sense, if Xia ruofei had not intervened, the current development curve would have been normal.

Xia ruofei nodded.”Let’s not think about that for now. The most important thing now is to try our best to save elder Liu’s life.”

“Yes, yes, yes!” “Mr. Xia, I won’t disturb you any longer,” Liu Qunfeng said.

After he finished speaking, he bowed slightly to Xia ruofei and quickly left the room. He even personally closed the door from the outside.

After they left, Liu Qunfeng regained some of his dignity. He said to the two men who were guarding the door,””Move your posts to the stairs. Without my permission, no one is allowed to approach the old man’s room, including you! In addition ... No matter what happens in the room, unless Mr. Xia personally calls for you, you are not allowed to enter the room without permission!”

“Yes!” The two of them replied respectfully.

The two big men followed Liu Qunfeng’s instructions and moved to the stairs. Their bright eyes were always on the situation in elder Liu’s room.

Liu Qunfeng looked back at the closed door and sighed. He then walked toward the stairs with a worried expression.

In the room, Xia ruofei scanned the entire room with his spiritual power.

This time, the Liu family had learned their lesson and did not set up any monitoring equipment.

Xia ruofei walked to the window and looked in a certain direction. Then, he pulled the curtains.

Xia ruofei was not surprised that the Liu family had set up security guards outside.

After checking his safety, Xia ruofei walked to the front of elder Liu’s bed. He reached out and grabbed his pulse. Then, he released his mental strength and started to scan his body along his meridians.

Xia ruofei frowned slightly. After the treatment, the tumor cells in elder Liu’s body had lost their vitality and could only struggle on at death’s door. Now, the tumor cells seemed to have revived. They were obviously full of vitality and the signs of spreading were quite obvious. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Why did this happen?

Obviously, the force that suppressed the cancer cells had disappeared, so they could rapidly grow by absorbing the energy of their host’s body and constantly divide into new cancer cells.

After the examination, Xia ruofei did not find any signs of poisoning.

Then, the answer was obvious. The problem was likely to lie in those pills.
