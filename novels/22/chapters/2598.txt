2599 Meeting again (2)

The two of them quickly reached an agreement. Hou Liang, who was at the side, wanted to cry but had no tears. The 300 yuan was his, okay?

Xia ruofei and the other two chatted as they walked into the main building of the club. They went straight to a luxury private room reserved for the shareholders. Song Rui ordered the manager of the club to prepare some fruit platters, snacks, and various alcoholic drinks.

After the three of them finished a can of beer, Xia ruofei told Hou Liang,””Liangzi, are you an idiot? To make such a bet with song Rui ... He must have heard the news before he made the bet with you!”

The Liu family would definitely try their best to hide the news of old master Liu’s serious illness so as to not cause any turmoil. Therefore, it was normal for Hou Liang to not know about the situation. However, no matter how the Liu family hid it, the song family would definitely have their own channels to get the news. Song Rui was no longer the good – for – nothing son he used to be. He had more or less participated in the family’s Affairs, so it was not surprising that he heard about the Liu family’s situation.

Song Rui knew very well that Xia ruofei had treated elder Liu. Hence, he knew that Xia ruofei would definitely come to the capital soon.

After listening to Xia ruofei’s analysis, Hou Liang felt like crying even more.”Didn’t you just happily split the money?” And you’re the one taking the biggest share!

Song Rui asked with a smile,”ruofei, how’s the Liu family’s young master?” Can you make it?”

“It’s alright! However, it’s hard to say if he can survive this. ” Xia ruofei said.

“There are times when you can’t be sure?” Song Rui grinned and said,”why do I not believe you?”

Then, song Rui asked again,”by the way, why did the old man’s condition suddenly worsen?” You’re his attending doctor. The Liu family didn’t cause you any trouble, right?”

“This has nothing to do with me, and it’s not a mistake in my treatment.” Xia ruofei said casually, then immediately asked,”let’s not talk about these boring things. Let’s talk about our paradise chapter! I heard that business has been good since the opening?”

“What do you mean it’s alright? That’s simply too good, alright?” Song Rui exclaimed exaggeratedly.

“Brother Xia, if our business is called ‘not bad’, then all the other clubs in Beijing are on the verge of closing down!” Hou Liang laughed.

“Woof! It’s inflated!” Xia ruofei smiled and pointed at the two of them.”Then tell me, how many new members have we gained in the past month that I wasn’t around?”

“The number of members didn’t increase by much!” Song Rui said,”but that’s under our control. We raised the entry conditions so that the members ‘spending experience won’t be reduced. After all, with the scale of our club, if there are too many members, it will become a farmer’s market every day. It won’t look like a high – end club anymore!”

“That’s right!”Hou Liang also said. Otherwise, I’m afraid that the people who apply for membership cards alone will be able to step over our threshold!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but tease them.”The two of you are singing the same tune. You two can go and do a crosstalk!”

“It’s the truth! Brother Xia!” “Of course!” Hou Liang said,”our Paradise club’s KPI definitely can’t be calculated by the increase in the number of members!”

“Then tell me, how do you want to calculate it?” Xia ruofei asked on purpose.

“Of course it’s the member’s activity!” “Yes.” Hou Liang said,”some clubs might seem to have a lot of members, but not many members spend their money there every day. I have quite a number of such membership cards, but I didn’t have a deep impression of them after going there. Basically, I’ve never gone there again after going there once!”

“Our paradise gathering is different!” From the first day of its opening, the number of members who had come to spend money had always maintained a high proportion. Basically, all the members had been here several times. That’s right, sister-in-law’s family’s private restaurant has a lot of business every day! Especially the Buddha Jumps Over the Wall dish, which has become very famous in the capital. Nowadays, they have to prepare the ingredients for the Buddha Jumps Over the Wall dish in large quantities every day!”

Song Rui also said,”that’s right!” From the opening to now, there was not a single day where the turnover was less than two million! A few of our buddies have used this place as their gathering point, and they’ve almost used up all the money they’ve spent on their membership cards. Yesterday, one of us topped up another 300000!”

“We should upgrade such a high – Quality member!” Xia ruofei said with a smile. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“We’ve been studying this recently!” Song Rui said,”you and brother Yongjun have the same idea!”

Xia ruofei could tell that the peach blossom society’s overall business situation was quite good. Of course, he didn’t care about the daily profits that the Paradise Club generated. Although this level of profit was already quite good in the eyes of many people, it paled in comparison to the speed at which the Paradise Corporation was making money.

Xia ruofei was even more pleased with the changes that the club had brought to song Rui and the others.

This place had already created an excellent high – end social environment. The frequent visits of high – Quality members had formed a virtuous cycle. Being in such an environment every day was a good exercise and improvement for song Rui and the others.

Xia ruofei could clearly feel that Qianqian, song Rui, and Hou Liang had given him a different feeling this time.

Moreover, this kind of subtle influence would become deeper and deeper with the passage of time.

The three of them sat in the private room, drinking and chatting. Soon, Zhao Yongjun, Wei Jun, and the others who knew that Xia ruofei had come to the capital arrived at the club. Hence, they simply ordered a table of food at Ling Ji private kitchen and sent it directly to the private room.

After knowing that it was their son – in – Law who wanted to order a meal, the chefs of the Ling Ji private restaurant of the peach blossom Association naturally did not dare to be negligent. They went all out and brought out their best skills. Soon, a table full of wine and food was prepared and delivered to the private room.

Xia ruofei and his brothers drank and chatted until the sky turned dark. Then, he politely declined everyone’s invitation to go to the sauna. He took the car back to the courtyard in liuhai Lane, a little tipsy.

As soon as Xia ruofei got off the car in the backyard, Xia Xiaolan came up to him and said with a smile,””Boss, miss song came over this afternoon and just had dinner. I saw that she didn’t plan to leave tonight, so I arranged a guest room for her in your courtyard.”

Xia ruofei was slightly stunned. He had sent Song Wei a WeChat message when he got off the plane to let her know that he was in the capital. However, considering that it was the weekend tomorrow, Xia ruofei had planned to bring Song Wei over. He did not expect her to come to the courtyard house this afternoon without telling Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei could not help but feel guilty when he thought about how he had spent the entire afternoon drinking and chatting with his friends at the Paradise society while Song Wei was waiting for him at home.

However, Xia ruofei did not show it in front of Xia Xiaolan and Wu Qiang. He just nodded and said,””I know, thank you for your hard work!”

With that, Xia ruofei strode towards the courtyard in the middle of his residence.

The workers in the courtyard house were familiar with Xia ruofei’s friends in Beijing. It was not Song Wei’s first time staying over at the courtyard house. However, they did not gossip and were very careful not to enter the owner’s courtyard when Xia ruofei had guests.

The design of the courtyard house had taken into account the privacy of the owner, so the front yard and the backyard could be connected by a corridor on the side. This way, the middle yard would be relatively independent.

Wu Qiang, Xia Xiaolan, and the other experienced security guards all cherished the job that offered them great benefits. At the same time, they were also very grateful to Xia ruofei. Naturally, they would pay attention to their behavior and not go against the rules.

Xia Xiaolan’s way of handling things today was very clever. How could she not have guessed the relationship between Xia ruofei and Song Wei? It was impossible! They were all smart people and could more or less tell what was going on, but she could pretend that she didn’t know anything. She even arranged a guest room for Song Wei in Xia ruofei’s courtyard.

This way of handling things was very comfortable.

Xia ruofei went through the moon gate and returned to the courtyard where he lived.

He scanned the room with his psychic power and found Song Wei sitting on the sofa in Xia ruofei’s room. She did not look impatient at all. She was reading a magazine lazily. She looked quiet and elegant, like an orchid that was blooming quietly.

Xia ruofei’s heart skipped a beat and he couldn’t help but pick up his pace.

The door was pushed open, and Song Wei raised her head.

When she saw Xia ruofei standing at the door with a smile on his face, her eyes slowly brightened. A bright smile appeared on her face, like the sun, and it infected Xia ruofei.
