“Yes! Master!” Zheng Yongshou quickly said,”after we leave the sect’s territory, this disciple will immediately let martial nephew Bo Shan arrange the journey!”

Within the range of star Seizer sect’s protective formation, even satellites could not detect Star Island. Naturally, there was no signal for mobile phones here. If he wanted to contact Wang Boshan, he had to leave the sect’s range.

After Wang Boshan was in charge of the affairs of the secular world, he had managed to obtain legal identities for all the important figures of the star Seizer sect. As the sect leader of the star Seizer sect, Luo Qingfeng naturally had a set of legal identity documents. He could even leave the country without any problems.

Although Qingfeng Luo had never used this identity, Wang Boshan still carefully maintained his identity as the chairman of stars corporation’s Board of Directors. Even the visas for major countries in the world were ready – made. As the chairman of a Board of Directors of a large corporation with a scale of ten billion US dollars, it was very easy to apply for a business visa for multiple trips. It was just that a little disguise was needed when applying for the visa. After all, Qingfeng Luo could not really apply for it from the Embassy. It was not difficult for cultivators to change their appearances.

Therefore, as long as he left the range of the sect’s great array, Zheng Yongshou could give Wang Boshan a call, and Wang Boshan would be able to arrange the trip very quickly.

In fact, Zheng Yongshou’s identity was also done this way. His public identity was that of an executive of Stars Group.

Luo Qingfeng reluctantly chose to travel by plane, which also reduced a lot of trouble for Zheng Yongshou. He could directly pass the news to Xia ruofei through Wang Boshan, without even using code words.

Qingfeng Luo nodded and said,”let’s do that!” However ... It’s too inefficient to leave by boat. I’ll give you a ride!”

Without waiting for Zheng Yongshou to react, a flying sword with a sharp aura appeared in front of Luo Qingfeng like a fish. Then, Zheng Yongshou felt a force lift him up into the air.

Qingfeng Luo and Zheng Yongshou turned into a stream of light and flew out of the quiet room’s window. They drew an arc in the air and then flew toward the land at an extremely fast speed.

When Luo Qingfeng flew out of the quiet room on his sword, he left a message,””I’ll be in closed – door cultivation for a while. No one is allowed to enter my room!”

The voice was still there, but the person had long disappeared.

The Dao child who was waiting for orders not far away quickly and respectfully replied,””I will obey the orders of the ancestor!”

After he finished, he looked at the closed door of the quiet room suspiciously and muttered in his heart,”Why didn’t he see martial uncle Zheng? Could it be that martial uncle Zheng was also in closed – door cultivation with the Grandmaster? Or ... Did martial uncle Zheng leave when I was napping?

The Dao child couldn’t think of a reason, so he didn’t think about it anymore. In any case, he just had to follow the orders of the sect leader. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

He quickly went to pass on the order to increase the number of people here to prevent anyone from unknowingly barging in and disturbing the sect master’s seclusion.

……

When Zheng Yongshou saw the flying sword, his heart couldn’t help but tremble. He subconsciously thought that he had been exposed. Of course, he wasn’t worried about his own safety, but he was afraid that it would affect the execution of his master’s plan.

However, he soon realized that he had misunderstood. In the next moment, Luo Qingfeng had already taken him on his flying sword and flew out.

When Zheng Yongshou came back to his senses, they were already flying at high speed above the sea. Even with the protection of the vital energy released by Luo Qingfeng, they could not be completely isolated. Flying at such a high speed, the wind was blowing into Zheng Yongshou’s mouth, and he could not even open his eyes.

His heart trembled. Although he was a cultivator, he had never experienced sword Kinesis flight before. This was the first time he had ever experienced it! He didn’t expect it to be such an exciting ‘sport’.

Qingfeng Luo was only an early – Stage golden core cultivator. If he were to ride a flying sword to the Peach Blossom Island, which was thousands of miles away, his vital energy would not be able to withstand the consumption even if he was alone, not to mention bringing Zheng Yongshou with him.

Therefore, such a flight was destined to be short.

Of course, Luo Qingfeng could also choose to fly all the way there, but he would have to find an island to stop on the way and recover his vital energy before he could continue flying.

Cultivation resources were so precious now, so how could he waste his true Qi on sword Kinesis flight?

Therefore, although taking a plane was a helpless choice, it was actually the most reasonable choice.

Qingfeng Luo flew with Zheng Yongshou for about ten minutes before they slowly descended and finally landed on an uninhabited island.

Naturally, he had already left the range of the star Seizer sect’s protective formation.

Qingfeng Luo looked at Zheng Yongshou, who was pale and weak at the knees. A smile flashed in his eyes as he asked,””Yongshou, is this your first time riding a flying sword? How do you feel?”

Zheng Yongshou resisted the urge to vomit and said,””Shizun, disciple almost vomited in the air just now! This disciple has finally seen the difference between himself and a golden core cultivator!”

Luo Qingfeng could not help but laugh and said,””Look at you! Wasn’t it just a little faster, a little higher, and a little stronger wind? You’re a Qi Level 7 cultivator, how could you be so scared?”

Qingfeng Luo, who was in a good mood, teased Zheng Yongshou and said,””You should call Boshan! Get him to arrange our trip as soon as possible!”

Zheng Yongshou was stunned for a moment and quickly said,””Master, this is an uninhabited island. There’s definitely no signal here!”
