2412 Personally taking action (2)

Elder song looked at Xia ruofei with a meaningful look. The answer was obvious. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

However, Xia ruofei was still in disbelief. He shook his head and said,””This ... This isn’t possible! Even a vicious Tiger will not eat its Cubs ...”

“Liu haojun’s father is Liu QUN FENG!” Elder song interrupted Xia ruofei and said,”as long as old Liu is alive, Liu Qunfeng will not be able to make the decisions in the Liu family!”

“I understand! But ... Liu haojun is also old man Liu’s grandson!” Xia ruofei said,”you’re even closer after a generation!”

Xia ruofei felt that elder song’s conclusion was too crazy. It had subverted his three views.

He had thought that the Liu family would reprimand Liu haojun harshly, then send him abroad and never let him return to the country. In the worst case scenario, he could be brought back to his home in the capital and locked up, which was not much different from going to jail.

However, Xia ruofei did not expect elder song to tell him that the Liu family might “put righteousness before family”. After all, blood was thicker than water!

“You’re talking about the average family. For a big family like the Liu family, family ties are already very indifferent. I know old Liu very well. As long as he can help the Liu family get out of this crisis faster and better with less losses, what’s the big deal about losing a grandson?”

Xia ruofei was speechless. Were these people from the big families all so crazy? He subconsciously glanced at eccentric song.

Elder song seemed to be able to read Xia ruofei’s mind. He said angrily,””What are you looking at me for? Our song family is different from the Liu family! We have a good family culture, and what I value the most is that the siblings love each other and help each other!”

“I didn’t say anything. Please don’t get so worked up!” Xia ruofei quickly said.

“Enough!” Elder song snapped. I’m a little tired, you should go rest too! Get Xiao Lu to arrange a room for you!”

“Okay, Grandpa song!” Xia ruofei said. Then, he suddenly remembered something and quickly said,”Oh right, Grandpa song, I have something else ...”

“Go ahead,”

“If you want to present the evidence tomorrow, you must access the internet directly and use hardware encryption.” Xia ruofei said,”I’ve used that encryption dog before. Do you think ... It’s better to get a new one?”

Eccentric song pondered for a moment before nodding. “You’re right! We have to avoid any possibility of exposing you, so it’s better to get a new one!”

“Then we’ll need a new encryption dog and a burning device,” Xia ruofei said.

There were also two types of encryption dogs. One was those that could not be modified by fixed programs. This type was generally not very safe. After all, the possibility of universal encryption programs being cracked was very high. The other kind of encryption dog was empty. After buying it, one would need to burn the encryption program that they had written. The security performance of this kind of encryption dog naturally depended on the program that was burned. However, in any case, it was definitely safer than the first kind.

What Manzila used was the second type of encryption dog, and the encryption program was saved on the computer on the island.

“If you have any needs, let Xiao Lu know. He’ll coordinate it for you immediately!” Elder song said.

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said,”Grandpa song, you should rest early. I won’t disturb you any longer!”

“Mm, go!” Elder song said.

After Xia ruofei left elder song’s study, he quickly found manager Lu in the room next door.

Xia ruofei told manager Lu that he would be staying the night and told him what he needed.

Manager Lu agreed without a second word. Then, he asked a staff member to arrange a place for Xia ruofei to stay while he went to find Xia ruofei an encryption dog and a burning device.

At this hour, those electronic cities would definitely be closed. It was not easy for an average person to buy an empty encryption dog, not to mention a ready – made burning device.

However, it was a piece of cake for manager Lu.

Xia ruofei waited in the guest room for about half an hour before manager Lu came over with the things.

Xia ruofei and elder song did not take the initiative to say anything, so manager Lu did not ask further. He left after putting down the things.

Before he left, he even told Xia ruofei to look for him if she had any needs.

Xia ruofei smiled and expressed his gratitude. He personally sent manager Lu to the door of the guest room, then locked the door and walked back to the room.

Out of habit, he used his mental power to check the whole room, and then took out two laptops and encryption dogs that he had seized from Manzila.

The encryption dog looked like a USB drive, but it had a chip inside and generally did not come with a storage function.

The two of them only looked similar, but they were actually two completely different things.

The encryption dog in his hand was what Manzila usually used, and it was originally from South Africa. Under normal circumstances, this encryption dog would not be used in China. If he really took it out, he might expose some of the situation.

This was the reason why Xia ruofei had specifically brought up the encryption dog.

He quickly connected the burning device to the computer on the island, found the encryption program stored in the computer, and burned the program into the chip of the encryption dog.

Then, Xia ruofei turned on the computer that was connected to the internet. He inserted the encryption dog into the computer and tried to access the internal website of the modr organization. After testing that everything was normal, he heaved a sigh of relief.

Xia ruofei kept the two laptops and the encryption dog in his storage space.

Xia ruofei would never take out these things when there were outsiders around.

After he packed his things, he went to the bathroom to wash up and went to bed.

It was not convenient for Xia ruofei to enter the medium as he was staying at the song family’s place.

As for the 200 or so people locked up in the space cage, he would just let them stay up for another night. He hoped that no one would go crazy.

In any case, the second time they were caught in the realm, other than the mercenary group, it would be the assassins from the dark shadow Squad. These people were harder to tame than the rookies in the training camp, so it was necessary to let them wait for a day or two.

It was a quiet night.

The next morning, while Xia ruofei was having breakfast with elder song, manager Lu came in with a Lieutenant Colonel in a neat military uniform.

Xia ruofei glanced at the officer’s collar and knew that he was probably a technician that elder song had called over. There was a difference between the collar of a commander and a Technical Officer. People who knew the ropes could tell at a glance.

“Chief, Xiao Liao is here,” said manager Lu.

The Lieutenant Colonel quickly saluted elder song and said in a clear voice,””Chief! Liao Jun reporting for duty!”

Eccentric song nodded with a smile,”Little Liao, you haven’t eaten either, have you? Do you want to eat together?”

“Reporting to the chief,” Liao Jun replied.”I already had breakfast before I came out. I’m ready to work at any time!”

“En!” Elder song nodded and looked at Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei finished the milk in his glass and said,””Chief, I’m full too. Let’s start working!”

“Alright!” Eccentric song nodded. Xiao Liao, you follow RUO Fei! He’ll demonstrate it to you. If there’s anything you don’t understand, don’t be afraid of trouble, you must ask clearly!”

“Yes! Chief!” Liao Jun said.

Elder song then turned to Xia ruofei.”Ruofei, little Liao is a senior engineer at the garrison district’s automation station. His major is computer and network. Show little Liao what you showed me yesterday in detail. Don’t hold back!”
