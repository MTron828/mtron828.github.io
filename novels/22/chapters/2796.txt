2797 Unity of will (1)

1 to 2!

After being snubbed twice in the opening stage, Barcelona finally recovered a point in the 30th minute of the first half with Messi. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

In fact, before this mistake, there had already been a hole in Spain’s defense. It was just that they were lucky and only lasted for about 30 minutes.

However, mark Rocca’s mistake was too big. He passed directly to zujare s feet. After zujare’s straight pass, Messi faced the goalkeeper alone. In the face of such an opportunity, Messi would probably score at least 90 times out of 100 times, and the result was unsurprising.

There was no celebration after Messi’s goal. He went straight past Diego Lopes, who had fallen to the ground in frustration, rushed into the goal to pick up the football and then went straight to the center circle.

The bar?a players just ran over and patted Messi on the shoulder, then surrounded him and ran to the center circle.

The meaning of the Barcelona players was clear. They did not want to waste a single second and hoped to resume the game as soon as possible.

After all, they were still one goal behind.

This was nokapu, their home ground. To be scored two goals in ten minutes by a mid – to – Low level team like RCD Espanyol, who was still struggling to stay in the first half of the league, was undoubtedly a disgrace for the stars of the universe team.

Wu Lei’s and Xia ruofei’s goals had successfully incited the anger of the bar?a players, and they urgently needed to vent this anger.

Such a bar?a team was more terrifying than ever.

Xia ruofei did not participate in the defense of the ball just now and was a little far from the point where mark Roka’s mistake happened. When he saw zuárez intercept the ball and go straight for Messi, he already knew the result, so he did not even see Messi’s final shot and went straight to the center circle.

Xia ruofei could not help but smile when he saw the many Barcelona players surrounding Messi as he placed the ball in the center circle and then quickly returned to his position. The game was getting more and more interesting.

Xia ruofei did not become nervous just because Barcelona scored a goal. He turned back to look at the Spaniard who was walking back to his position dejectedly and shouted,””Cheer up! We’re still ahead of them! Quickly return to your position and don’t make any more mistakes!”

As long as the bar?a players returned to their own half, and the Spanish players were also in their own half, regardless of whether all the Spanish players were in their positions, according to the rules, the referee could blow the whistle and kick off.

Of course, because it was the Espanyol who had lost the ball, it was the Espanyol’s turn to kick off this time. Iglasias and Wu Lei naturally would not rush to kick off before their own players had returned to their positions.

In fact, the Spaniards ‘mentality had changed a little. It could be seen from their current performance that they wanted to buy as much time as possible.

However, Xia ruofei was very clear that it was useless to blindly defend against the strong Barcelona. Including the injury time in the first and second half, there were at least 60 to 70 minutes until the end of the game. It was simply a fool’s dream to rely on the bus to keep the current score.

It was conceivable that if the morale of the Spanish players was still so low, they might not even be able to get a draw, let alone keep three points.

Bar?a’s offensive firepower was not just for show.

Although Xia ruofei did not participate in many games, and this was only his second game, he was the owner of the team after all. He had won the respect of the players with his own strength, so no one had any rebellious thoughts when he stood out to shout. Even the captain, Victor Sanchez, felt that it was normal.

Victor Sanchez also immediately realized the problem, so he kept clapping his hands and loudly boosted the team’s morale.

Soon, everyone returned to their respective positions, and the referee finally blew the whistle to restart the game.

Iglasias passed the ball to Wu Lei, who immediately passed it back to Victor Sanchez.

On the Barcelona team’s side, the players heard the whistle as if they had heard the horn to charge, and the overall situation immediately pressed over the center line.

By the time Victor Sanchez received the ball, bar?a’s forward line had already advanced to this position. Suyass and cutinho pressed over from different directions.

In the front field, iglasias, Wu Lei, and Xia ruofei were all marked by bar?a’s players. Victor Sanchez did not have a suitable route for the ball for a while and could only choose to return the ball again.

After the center back Naldo received the ball, bar?a’s forward player pressed on again. Naldo passed the ball diagonally forward to mark Roca. Mark Roca had just stopped the ball, and bar?a’s Busquets immediately rushed up while he was still unstable.

Mark Roca had to pass the ball back again. After Naldo had just passed the ball, he had not run to the appropriate position to receive the ball, so mark Roca chose to pass the ball back to the goalkeeper, Diego Lopes.

Bar?a’s forward line also continued to be high on pressure and rushed toward Diego Lopes.

In just a few seconds, the space in the Spanish team had been compressed to a very small size.

Diego Lopez could only choose to use a long kick to pass forward. At this point, he could no longer care about whether he could create an offensive opportunity. His first priority was to keep the football away from their goal.

Iglasias was defeated in the contest for the header against pique, and the football was headed by pique to lakitic.

Less than ten seconds after the restart, the ball had changed hands and the football was back at bar?a’s feet again.

Bar?a then did another drowsy conduction. The football went up and down, up and down, up and down, but it was always controlled under the feet of the bar?a players.

Xia ruofei frowned slightly. He was well aware of the team’s current passive situation.

Bar?a’s conduction seemed to be neither fast nor slow, and it did not threaten the Espanyol’s goal for the time being, but the killing intent was often revealed in a flash.

People loved bar?a’s style of play and thought that it was the representative of modern football. Those who didn’t like it hated it and thought that too many ineffective passes greatly reduced the viewing pleasure and made people drowsy.

But in any case, for so many years, bar?a had relied on this set of play to dominate La Liga and the European arena. It could be said that it was rare to meet an opponent.

Spain’s defensive strength was average. In the face of Bassa’s Mercury – like ground attack, they would be in greater danger if they did not make any changes.

Xia ruofei squinted his eyes and kept his spiritual power out. He paid attention to the situation on the field and quietly adjusted his position.

Xia ruofei’s change was very subtle. When Barcelona was controlling the ball, Xia ruofei’s defense was symbolic and did not attract the attention of the Barcelona players.

At this time, when bar?a faced the defense of the Spanish players, they used a classic “M”- shaped passing route, and the football eventually returned to the feet of Semedo on the right.

Xia ruofei had been secretly moving towards them and had already observed the situation of the entire field with his spiritual power. He had predicted bar?a’s pass.

Just as the ball was stopped by Semedo’s chest, Xia ruofei suddenly moved. The moment the ball landed, Xia ruofei’s flying shovel had already arrived.

He accurately shoveled the ball down, and at the same time, like a bulldozer, he also took down Samel.

Immediately, Semedo grabbed his ankle in an exaggerated manner and rolled on the ground.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh. He knew that he had shoveled the ball and had only brought down Semedo. He definitely did not touch his ankle.

As expected of a member of the universe team, even though he wasn’t a product of Lamasia Film Academy, his acting skills were still not to be underestimated.

At this time, the referee decisively blew the whistle and quickly ran to the scene of the incident while using a hand gesture to indicate that Spain had fouled.

“Sir, I shoveled the ball just now!” Xia ruofei immediately cried out.

The main judge stared at Xia ruofei and said,””I saw it very clearly. Although you shoveled the ball, it was a dangerous move, so you’ve committed a foul!”

Xia ruofei shrugged and left the judge.

Xia ruofei did not care if the ball was considered a foul. He just hoped that through this fierce interception, the RCD Espanyol players would be able to cheer up.

...

This was the Catalan derby. Even if he lost, he had to play with hemorrhage!

The judge was still shouting behind Xia ruofei,””Be careful with your movements when you’re kicking! I’ve already remembered it. If there are similar dangerous moves, I’m going to pull out my cards!”

This was a verbal warning, but Xia ruofei did not care. He turned around and nodded at the referee, then called out to the players on his side,””Show some courage! A Derby doesn’t need a refined gentleman!”

The RCD Espanyol players witnessed Xia ruofei’s tackle and knew that it was Xia ruofei’s gesture. Especially after listening to Xia ruofei’s words, the players ‘courage was really aroused.

After Semedo pretended to be treated by the team doctor, he quickly stood up. He didn’t look like an injured person at all.

The competition resumed.

The bar?a players clearly felt that the momentum of the Spanish players had changed.

No matter who it was, as long as they took the ball for a little longer, two or three Spanish players would immediately come forward to snatch it.

And if the ball was passed out, several Spanish players would also appear on the other side to surround and block it.

The number of players on both sides was the same, including the goalkeeper. There was one player in total, but the bar?a stars felt that the Spanish players seemed to be everywhere.

Everyone was actively running and did not hesitate to use their physical strength to carry out a high position attack on bar?a, which was very physically exhausting.

...

Under Xia ruofei’s lead, the Spanish team’s will was united and they finally held on for the last fifteen minutes of the first half.

When the referee blew the whistle to signal the end of the first half, Xia ruofei heaved a long sigh of relief and entered the changing room with a score of 2 – 1. For them, the second half was equivalent to having a certain initiative.

Although the final result was still difficult to predict, at least the Spanish team was still in the lead, which was the best news.
