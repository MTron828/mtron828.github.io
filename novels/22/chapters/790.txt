Chapter 791: Good things come one after another (1)

In an unassuming office in the southeast province Military District.

A large office table was filled with all kinds of scattered documents, and a large ashtray was filled with cigarette butts. The office was also filled with smoke. Obviously, the owner of this office was in a very busy state.

This was Niu Tao’s office. He had been really busy these days.

Niu Tao was holding his phone in one hand and a cigarette in the other. He was standing in front of the window talking to Xia ruofei.

When Xia ruofei mentioned that he wanted his help to investigate a working Deputy Mayor of Sanshan city, Niu Tao subconsciously frowned. This was a very difficult matter for him. Furthermore, it was a serious violation of the organization’s principles. If this matter was exposed, the lightest punishment he could get was to remove his military uniform and transfer to another job.

However, Niu Tao didn’t have the heart to reject Xia ruofei directly. He had heard that after the death of old Luo, Xia ruofei played an important role in the mission and killed the enemy for old Luo.

Niu Tao and Guo Zhan had entered lone wolf at almost the same time. They were both brought up by squad leader old Luo.

However, when Xia ruofei said that the Deputy Mayor he wanted to investigate was Xue Zhengbang, who was in charge of science, education, Culture, and health, Niu Tao’s embarrassed expression suddenly froze. He opened his mouth slightly, and his expression was quite interesting.

Xia ruofei saw that Niu Tao was silent after hearing this and could not help but smile bitterly.””Flying Wolf, I know that this request is a bit too much, it’s a bit too much ... Forget it, I can’t make things difficult for you, this matter ...”

“RUO Fei, I can help you.” Niu Tao said in a serious tone.

Xia ruofei wasn’t in front of Niu Tao. Otherwise, he would have seen that although Niu Tao’s tone was very serious, his expression had become very relaxed. It was like a completely different person from the difficult look he had just now.

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment and said,””Flying Wolf, don’t force yourself! This is not a joke ...”

“I’m still a Colonel of the Republic,”Niu Tao replied with a faint smile.” Do I need to brag in front of a Sergeant like you? I’ll put it this way! I can help you investigate Xue Zhengbang, but how do you plan to thank me?”

......

Hearing Niu Tao’s relaxed tone, Xia ruofei realized that there must be a reason behind it. He relaxed a little and smiled.”How about I treat you to a big meal? You can choose the restaurant!”

“And a few bottles of good wine!” Niu Tao laughed.

“No problem!” Xia ruofei said,”the exquisite Drunken Eight Immortals is enough!”

“I want paradise vegetables!”

“Brother! This was even less of a problem! I’m selling this!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you can eat as much as you want! I’ll bring some back for my sister – in – Law to try! That’s interesting!”

“Woof! This was the rhythm of not being able to bear the consequences! That’s interesting!” “Deal!” Niu Tao laughed heartily.

Xia ruofei stopped smiling and asked seriously,””Fire Wolf, Are you sure? If you’re not confident, then forget it. I don’t want to drag you into this ...”

“You think you can drag me into this?” Niu Tao laughed. Don’t worry! For the sake of your big meal, I’ll definitely settle this matter properly for you!”

“Something’s wrong!” Xia ruofei asked suspiciously,”you have so much power now? Checking on a Deputy – Director level official is as easy as eating and drinking?”

“If it were any other Deputy department head, we naturally wouldn’t be able to investigate him so casually. But Xue Zhengbang is an exception because we’re investigating him!” Niu Tao laughed. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Xia ruofei was stunned for a long time before he said,””Fire Wolf, you’re so sneaky! You tricked me into a big meal and a few bottles of good wine just like that?”

“Hahaha!” Niu Tao laughed heartily.”I heard that you’re a profiteer. This time, I’ll make you bleed a little. That’s great!”

“Don’t you dare!” Xia ruofei said,”quickly tell me what happened. Why would the military suddenly investigate a Deputy Mayor? This is not normal!”

Niu Tao said triumphantly,”Speaking of which, this matter is most likely related to you guys!” We’re investigating the leak of information on the research at Sanshan University, and we found a foreign company with Wei nation funding.

This technology company called ‘Yamada Corporation’ had just settled in Sanshan this year, and it had already been found out that Yamada Corporation was actually an intelligence branch of the Wei nation, responsible for the intelligence collection and analysis of the southeast Region.

“We found this Xue Zhengbang by following the clues. Xue Zhengbang has a close relationship with Yamada & Co., And has provided a lot of help for this company to establish itself in San Shan city. The confirmed bribe is two million HxB, and we’re currently digging deeper ...”

Xia ruofei was dumbfounded.

This was too much of a coincidence!

“Fire Wolf, this Deputy Mayor is so bold?” Xia ruofei found it a little unbelievable.”He actually dared to help the Wei nation’s intelligence organization? This isn’t just a simple bribe, it’s a crime that threatens national security and even treason!”

“This fellow isn’t going to the extent of betraying his country. He doesn’t have the guts to do so!” Niu Tao laughed. “We’re guessing that Xue Zhengbang doesn’t know the background of Yamada & Co., And he’s just a low – ranking Deputy Mayor. He doesn’t usually earn much. The Japanese sent him so much money all of a sudden, he must have lost his sense of direction ...”
