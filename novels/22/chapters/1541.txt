The raw stone seemed to have heard Xia ruofei’s thoughts. Although it was riddled with holes under the absorption of the spirit map space, it was still very strong and did not break into pieces. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The spirit map space had already reached the critical point of upgrading, but it was still greedily absorbing the Jade essence in the raw stone.

Through the hole in the raw stone, one could even see a touch of intoxicating green through it.

Out of the seven raw gemstones, this one had the most intense reaction from the painting. Xia ruofei had purposely left it at the end.

Finally, just as the Jade in the rough stone was about to be completely absorbed, the spirit map space began to shake violently. Even Xia ruofei, who was sensing the situation in the space outside, could feel the power of the shaking.

In the mountain and sea realm, the White realm Fox, which had been quietly comprehending the laws of space, finally opened its eyes and looked at the distant spatial membrane.

As the mountain and sea realm trembled, another Earth – shaking transformation occurred, and the dimensional membrane began to expand outward at an incredible rate.

The spirit map space had finally been upgraded again! Xia ruofei heaved a long sigh of relief.

He put the painting in his palm, then went to the bathroom and washed his face with cold water. He then went to the window of the room and lit a cigarette, quietly waiting for the space to upgrade.

About half an hour later, Xia ruofei finally received Xia Qing’s notice. The spirit map space’s upgrade was completed.

Xia ruofei could not wait to close the curtains. He summoned the spirit map scroll from his palm and entered the medium.

The concentration of spiritual Qi in the space had increased again. Once he entered the space, Xia ruofei felt refreshed. He suspected that if he continued to upgrade, the space might be able to produce spiritual crystals.

Other than that, there were no obvious changes in the Archean realm. Xia ruofei had expected this, and he quickly arrived at the mountain and sea realm.

The most obvious change in the mountain and sea realm was naturally the expansion of the area. Furthermore, it was an expansion that was multiple times larger.

The entire mountain sea realm was already close to 20000 mu in area. This was a vastness that one could not see the end of.

The mountain peaks grew taller, the rivers widened, and the seas expanded ... The entire mountain sea realm was filled with a vibrant vitality.

Xia ruofei had no doubt that if a person lived in such an environment for a long time, their lifespan might be extended by ten to twenty years.

He didn’t have the mood to check it carefully at this time. He directly flashed to Xia Qing’s side and asked,””Xia Qing, now that the spirit map world has risen two levels in a row, where is the opportunity to cure Song Wei? you can tell me now, right?”

“Master, have you noticed that the mountain sea realm has gained something new?” Xia Qing asked with a smile.

“What’s extra?” Xia ruofei was confused.”Didn’t the territory get bigger like before?” I don’t feel anything extra!”

“Please take a closer look ...” Xia Qing said as she pointed in a direction.

That was the direction of the space ocean.

Xia ruofei looked in the direction that Xia Qing was pointing at and suddenly saw a black silhouette in the spiritual mist.

“That’s ...” Xia ruofei asked doubtfully,”a small island?”

Xia Qing nodded with a smile.

Xia ruofei suddenly became alert and asked,””You’re saying ... That there’s something on the island that can cure Song Wei?”

“Master, why don’t you go and take a look first?” Xia Qing said.

Xia ruofei didn’t blame Xia Qing for keeping him in suspense. He knew that it might be due to the damn supreme law’s restriction. He was in a hurry to save her, so he didn’t think about anything else. His figure flashed and disappeared from the spot.

Originally, Xia ruofei was the Supreme ruler of this space. He could appear at any place he wanted to and the rules of space could be fully exerted here.

However, to Xia ruofei’s surprise, when he reappeared, he was above the sea and the island was more than a hundred meters away.

Xia Qing’s voice rang in his ears,”master, the space within three hundred feet of spirit map Island is sealed. You can’t teleport in directly.”

“Why didn’t you say so earlier ...” Xia ruofei smiled bitterly.”Then how do we get in?”

“You.” Xia Qing only said one word.

Xia ruofei was speechless. There was such a weird setting?

He didn’t know that this was only because he was the master of the spirit map space. If it was someone else, the space within three hundred feet of the spirit map Island would be completely sealed off. No matter how strong they were, they wouldn’t be able to enter.

Xia ruofei did not hesitate. He took out his phone and other items, let them float on the sea, and then fell into the sea.

When Xia ruofei was in the Army, he would participate in the sea training every year. This distance was a piece of cake for him.

Although the waves on the sea were quite big, Xia ruofei was like a Dolphin. He used the standard breaststroke posture and quickly approached the island.

The breaststroke was also the standard swimming style for armed swimming in the Army. Although it was not as fast as freestyle, it was better at hiding.

Although there was no need to hide in the spirit map space, Xia ruofei still chose to do the breaststroke out of habit.

The distance of more than a hundred meters was covered in no time. Xia ruofei felt the soft sand under his feet. He stood up from the water and waded towards the island.

Looking at it from a close distance, the island was full of lush vegetation. On Xia ruofei’s side, there was a white beach. In addition, the spiritual Qi in the space was very rich. It was definitely a good place for a vacation.
