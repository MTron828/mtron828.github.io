2880 A super – grade golden core (2)

It was just that he didn’t even have the right to understand this matter now, which also gave him a deep sense of defeat.

Seeing Xia ruofei fall into silence, immortal Shanhe couldn’t help but smile and say,””Don’t feel too much pressure. Since I’ve left behind this mountain river spiritual map and you’ve inherited it, you’ll have a high chance of reaching the advanced stage of the nascent Soul Stage. Also, when you reach the Yuanying stage, I’ll give you a big gift that will be of great help to you. ”

“Thank you for your encouragement, senior mountain river ...” Xia ruofei said,”but I’m worried that my cultivation speed is too slow ...”

“You’re overthinking it,” Immortal mountain river said with a smile,”I said that the rate of environmental deterioration is intensifying, but that’s relative to the long river of history. How long will it take for you to cultivate to the nascent Soul Stage? “In addition, this is only the worst possibility. There is another possibility. If it succeeds, you don’t even need to do anything, and the problem will be solved ...”

“You can’t tell me exactly what this possibility is, right?” Xia ruofei asked.

“You’re Teachable!” Immortal mountain river laughed and said.

Xia ruofei smiled helplessly. He suddenly thought of something and quickly asked,””Senior mountain river, may I ask if you have a disciple named li beihuai?”

Li beihuai was Li Yifu’s Grandmaster. Although Xia ruofei had basically confirmed this relationship from his cultivation technique and the personal notes left behind by perfected mountain river, he still wanted to confirm it since perfected mountain river was here.

Immortal mountain river’s expression changed, and he said,””Young friend, you know li beihuai? He’s indeed an in – Name disciple I’ve taken in. Bei Huai’s talent wasn’t bad, but at that time, the cultivation environment in the divine continent had already deteriorated by a lot, so I’m afraid that his path of cultivation would be extremely difficult. Furthermore, I was already planning to leave the divine continent, so I only took him in as an in – Name disciple. ”

At this moment, the illusory figure of immortal mountain river trembled slightly. He spoke faster and said,””Little friend, if you have any more questions, ask them quickly. As long as I know and can say it, I’ll definitely tell you. I won’t be able to maintain this will for much longer. ”

Xia ruofei was shocked and quickly asked,””Senior, you’re ...”

“I’m just a thought, and now that I’ve completed my mission, it’s time for me to disappear,”immortal mountain river said with a smile. The spiritual Pearl’s energy can still be maintained for a while. If you have any questions, young friend, please ask them quickly!”

Xia ruofei nodded quickly. He did not have time to be sad. He racked his brain to think of what questions he had that needed to be answered. However, the more anxious he was, the more he could not think of anything. After half a minute, he saw that the shadow of immortal mountain river was starting to fade away. Suddenly, an idea flashed through his mind.

Xia ruofei quickly asked,”may I ask, senior? when I was forming the beginner Aurous core energy Whirlpool, I noticed a small purple – Gold ball in the center of the whirlpool. It seemed to contain a very terrifying power. What caused this?” Are there any hidden dangers?”

Immortal mountain river smiled.”Don’t worry, my young friend. You’ve broken through to Jindan by cultivating the great way of Dao. It’s normal for vital Qi beads to appear in the vital Qi Whirlpool. Moreover, the vital Qi beads have reached the highest grade of purple – Gold, which means that your cultivation Foundation is very solid. You just need to seriously cultivate according to the “great Dao chant.” As long as you don’t make any mistakes, there won’t be any problems. ”

Xia ruofei heaved a long sigh of relief. Ever since he discovered the purple – Gold bead in the yuan Qi vortex, he had been feeling uneasy. It was mainly because he had read through the descriptions of the early jiedan stage in many cultivation books in his mind, but none of them had mentioned that there would be a solid bead – like object in the yuan Qi vortex of the early jiedan stage. This made him even more worried about whether there was a deviation in his cultivation process.

Immortal Shanhe’s words completely dispelled Xia ruofei’s concerns and worries.

“Senior Shanhe,” Xia ruofei continued,”according to the cultivation records, the quality of the Golden core is closely related to the grade of the vital Qi Whirlpool. What grade is the vital Qi Whirlpool with the purple – Gold vital Qi condensed Pearl in the center of the nine grades?”

Hearing this, immortal mountain river revealed a confident smile and said lightly,””The nine levels of the Golden core are divided according to most cultivation methods. Little friend, you practice the great Dao Arts, so your golden core is naturally not in the nine grades. If you have to divide it, then it’s super – grade, right? After all, the Golden core formed by cultivating the great Dao Arts is much stronger than an ordinary ninth – grade golden core ...”

Xia ruofei’s mouth was wide open in shock. Daoist mountain river’s words were really domineering! A super – grade golden core! They all sounded much more domineering than the upper three ranks, middle three ranks, and lower three ranks! He also said that the Golden core formed by cultivating the great Dao Arts was much more powerful than an ordinary ninth – grade golden core.

Furthermore, according to what immortal mountain river said, the essence Qi Whirlpool that Xia ruofei had created this time was the highest – grade purple – Gold essence Qi Pearl. Wouldn’t the Golden core that he would form in the future be awesome?

Xia ruofei was still in shock and deep in thought. He didn’t even notice that the apparition of immortal mountain river had become fainter. It was as if he would disappear without a trace with a gust of wind.

At this time, Xia Qing, who had been standing respectfully at the side, shouted in a sad voice,””Master ...”

Only then did Xia ruofei come back to his senses. He saw that the apparition of immortal mountain river had faded so much that it was almost unrecognizable. He couldn’t help but cry out sadly,””Senior mountain river!”

Immortal mountain river’s illusory figure was in the dark and in the light. He smiled and said,””Little six, little friend, don’t be sad. We will meet again if we are fated ...”

Immortal mountain river’s voice became more and more ethereal. He said,””Little friend, I hope you will work hard in your cultivation and not waste this rare opportunity ...”

Xia ruofei looked at the shadow of immortal mountain river that had almost disappeared. He suddenly shouted,””Senior, this junior has a presumptuous request. I hope to be your disciple, and I hope that senior will grant me this wish!” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

At this moment, the apparition of immortal mountain river could no longer be seen with the naked eye. However, immortal mountain river’s hearty laughter could still be heard. He said,””You obtained my opportunity and cultivated my cultivation technique. You and I are naturally fated to be master and disciple. I ... Will take you as my disciple ...”

The sound stopped abruptly and the shadow of immortal Shan He disappeared completely. The Pearl with the pattern of the Yin Yang fish in Xia ruofei’s hand cracked into a few pieces ...

Xia Qing’s face was filled with grief as she shouted,””Master ...”

Xia ruofei could hear Xia Qing’s sorrow. If Xia Qing was not a spiritual puppet but a human with flesh and blood, she would be in tears by now.

Xia ruofei’s emotions were also a little agitated. After a while, he slowly calmed down. He first knelt down solemnly in the direction where the illusionary figure of immortal mountain river had disappeared and kowtowed three times respectfully. After completing the ceremony of acknowledging a master, he stood up and said,””Xia Qing, you don’t have to be too sad. Master just said that this is only a thought of his old man. Master has already left earth. I promise you, when my cultivation reaches master’s requirements in the future, I will definitely find an opportunity to take you to him!”

Xia Qing’s face was filled with gratitude as she respectfully said,””This subordinate thanks master!”

“No need for formalities,” Xia ruofei said, waving his hand.

After that, Xia ruofei asked Xia Qing a few more questions about the recent situation in the spirit map space. After knowing that everything was normal, including the labor team formed by the mercenaries, he left the spirit map space in a hurry and returned to the outside world.

Xia ruofei also knew that Song Wei and the rest must be looking forward to it, so he did not stay in the spirit map space for long.

After returning to the outside world, Xia ruofei kept the spirit map scroll in his palm and removed the array talismans that he had just set up. Through the core of the array, he restored the many protective arrays of the Taixu xuanqing array to their original positions. Then, his figure flashed and he headed towards the building where Song Wei and Ling Qingxue lived.
