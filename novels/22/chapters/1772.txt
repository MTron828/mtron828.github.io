Chapter 1773: The problem of candidates (1)

Xia ruofei was stunned. Feng Jing, who was thousands of miles away, found out about this news so quickly! He immediately realized that it must have been his bad friends who wanted to push this matter forward, so they secretly revealed it to Feng Jing.

He revealed a bitter smile and said,””Sister ran, is it brother Zhao or song Rui?”

“You don’t need to know who told me this,” Feng Jing replied.”It’s true, right?”

Xia ruofei felt a headache and said,””Okay, okay, okay, I agree to participate in this show, okay?”

In fact, Xia ruofei had already been convinced, but he was still hesitating. He knew Feng Jing’s temper. If he didn’t agree, Feng Jing would definitely keep asking until he agreed. By then, it would be extremely annoying, and the final result would be the same.

Feng Jing was surprised by Xia ruofei’s quick response. She asked,””Really?”

“Sister ran, do you want me to change my mind?” Xia ruofei asked with a bitter smile.

“Don’t even think about it! RUO Fei, I really don’t know why you’re hesitating over such a good thing!” Feng Jing said,”but it’s good that you’ve agreed. Leave the rest to us!”

“What do you mean?” Xia ruofei asked. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Of course it’s to discuss the details with xiangnan TV!” Feng Jing said matter – of – factly,”you’ll need to sign a contract if you’re going to participate in their show, so I’m thinking of signing it under the company’s name!” I’ll set up a team to serve you, not just for this matter, but also for the maintenance of your Weibo account and external communication. Won’t it be much easier for you then?”

“Sister ran, are you really planning to make me a big star?” Xia ruofei said helplessly.

“You’re a big star!” Feng Jing chuckled.”Even without the Quto incident, you’d still be the most dazzling star in our company! A lot of young ladies are crazy about you!”

Xia ruofei quickly said,”sister ran, please spare me!” I’ll agree to participate in the program. In the future, the fewer such things happen, the better. ”

“I know ... I’ll just do my best this time!” Feng Rao said perfunctorily.

After hanging up, Xia ruofei mumbled to himself,””Who’s the real boss?”

Xia ruofei wondered if he should establish his authority as the boss. And Zhao Yong Jun and the others, they actually wanted to save the country in a roundabout way, they really couldn’t take it.

That being said, Xia ruofei was just not used to being in the spotlight. He did not really reject the idea of participating in shows.

He put away his phone and realized that the car had stopped. It turned out that Wu Qiang had already parked the car in the backyard of the siheyuan.

Hence, Xia ruofei got out of the car and said,””Wu Qiang, you’ve worked hard today. Park the car and rest early!”

“It’s no trouble at all, President Xia!”Wu Qiang laughed.

Xia ruofei strode towards the main courtyard in the middle. After two steps, he stopped and turned around.””By the way, how’s the progress with the staff I asked you to find?”

Wu Qiang sat in the driver’s seat and scratched his head,””I do have a candidate, but I don’t know if President Xia will be satisfied ...”

“You’re still beating around the bush, kid?” Xia ruofei laughed and scolded,”hurry up and tell me!”

“It’s my sister – in – Law ...” Wu Qiang said,”my sister-in-law’s cooking skills are not bad. Whenever there’s a joyous occasion in the village, everyone will ask her to cook. However, she has never learned how to cook, nor does she have a chef’s certificate ...”

“It’s fine as long as the cooking is good! Why would I want her to have a chef’s certificate?” Xia ruofei continued,”is your sister – in – Law willing to come to the capital to work?”

“I’ve mentioned it to her, and she’s very willing to come!”Wu Qiang quickly nodded and said. My brother died of cancer a few years ago. She took care of the child alone and her life was hard. Of course, she would be very willing to work here!”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and asked,”does your sister – in – Law have a child?” If she comes to the capital to work, will there be no one to take care of the child?”

Wu Qiang said,”my nephew is already in high school. He usually stays in the dormitory. Moreover, my nephew is very sensible and his grades are very good. My sister – in – Law doesn’t need to worry about him.”

“That’s good!” Xia ruofei said,”in that case, tell your sister – in – Law to come to work immediately! As for her salary ... I’ll give her six thousand Yuan first! As usual, sign a contract with our paradise Corporation. There will be five insurances and one housing Fund, food and accommodation included, and five days of paid leave every year for five years. After that, there will be an additional five days of leave every five years!”

“Thank you, director Xia!” Wu Qiang was overjoyed.”I’ll call my sister – in – Law immediately!”

A salary of 6000 Yuan was not considered high, but it depended on who it was compared to. In Wu Qiang’s hometown, the average salary was only 2000 to 3000 Yuan. If one was farming in the countryside, facing the yellow Earth and facing the sky, the final annual income might only be 10000 to 20000 Yuan. Coming here, not only did they have food and accommodation, but they also had medical insurance and social security. They basically did not need to spend their salary and could save all of it.

In this way, he could save up 60000 to 70000 Yuan a year. He wouldn’t have to worry about his nephew’s College tuition in the future.

Sister – in – Law would definitely be overjoyed to hear such a good thing! Wu Qiang was also very grateful to Xia ruofei.

“Wait ...” Xia ruofei said after some thought.
