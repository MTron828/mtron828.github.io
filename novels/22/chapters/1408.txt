“It’s only been a few days!”Feng Rao smiled bitterly. And he’s not in China ...”

“It can’t be that you haven’t contacted him yet, right?” Xia ruofei asked Feng Rao.

Feng Rao nodded in embarrassment and quickly said,””But the headhunting company said that Dong Yun should be returning to China for the Chinese New Year this year. They’ll try to arrange for me to meet her then!”

“That’s fine. A few days won’t make a difference ...” Xia ruofei nodded. Then, he realized something and turned to Feng Jing.”Sister Jing, you ... You won’t be coming home even during the spring Festival, right?”

Feng Rao’s expression was a little strange as she said,”I don’t really feel like going back this year ... Besides, the company has just started this year. I’m too busy!”

“Do you have the money to go home for the new year?” Xia ruofei said,”the company is also on holiday! What are you doing in the company during the new year? Sister ran, the most important thing is to go home for the new year! If it really doesn’t work, then let’s not contact that Dong Yun! Our company is on the rise, and when the time comes, we’ll be fighting for talents, so we won’t be short of one!”

“Dong Yun is different ... She’s really super strong!” Feng Jing said,”besides, I’m staying over for the new year. It doesn’t really have much to do with Dong Yun. I just don’t have any plans to go home ...”

“How can I do that?” Xia ruofei said,”if you don’t go back, how lonely will uncle and Auntie be?”

Feng Rao glared at Xia ruofei and said,””Why do you care so much! I’m willing to stay and work overtime, okay? Don’t tell me you don’t want to pay triple your salary?”

“Am I that stingy?” Xia ruofei forced a smile and said,”sister che, the Spring Festival is the most important Festival in China. Are you really not going home?”

“I’ve already decided! Ruofei, I can’t explain this in a short time. Anyway, don’t worry about it, I know what to do!” Feng ke said.

“Sister ran ... You ... Are you afraid that you’ll be forced to get married?” Xia ruofei asked with a strange expression.

Feng Rao immediately flew into a rage out of humiliation. She stomped her feet and said,”Hey! Are you done!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.”What the ... Did I guess it right? Sister ran, is it that serious? You don’t even want to go home? This ... Uncle and aunty will be very sad!”

“Ruofei, you don’t know my parents,” Feng Rao said helplessly.”They must be doing well on their side. You should just stay out of it!”

“But ...”

“Hey! I still have work to report! Do you want to hear it or not?” Feng Rao asked, pouting.

“Listen, listen!” Xia ruofei raised his hands in surrender and decided not to interfere in Feng Jing’s family matters.

However, since Feng Jing was staying for the new year, he decided to invite her, himself, Hu Zi’s mother, and Lin Qiao to have a New Year’s Eve dinner. He also made sure to get the administrative department to prepare some new year goods, such as couplets, lanterns, and the Chinese character “fortune” for Feng Jing. She was all alone at the company for the new year, so he wanted her to feel the company’s warmth.

While Xia ruofei was thinking about Feng Jing, Feng Jing had already started to report her second plan.

“Ruofei, I’ve also come up with a plan for the bonus bonus for the company’s top executives.” Feng Jing said,”according to the company’s reorganization plan, there will be a total of 12 executives. You and I will not be participating in the dividends, while the Chief Executive Officer and the two vice presidents will be absent. There will be seven people who will be participating in the dividends, namely the Chief Marketing Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the director of the overseas business department, the director of the e – commerce business department, the person in charge of the charity fund, and the manager of the two branch offices.”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”there are still seven people?” I remember that last time, you said you would take out 5% of the profits as dividends! Isn’t the money too little? If it really doesn’t work, just add a little! Since we’re going to encourage them, we must be able to greatly promote everyone’s enthusiasm. Otherwise, it’s better not to do it, lest it backfires!”

Feng Rao didn’t know whether to laugh or cry,”ruofei, five percent is a lot!” The financial report for the past year is still being calculated, but I have the rough figures. The net profit can reach about 300 million, and 5% is 15 million!”

Xia ruofei was also slightly surprised and said,””The profit margin last year was quite high!” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“I really don’t know what kind of boss you are ...” Feng Jing couldn’t help but complain. She then explained,”it’s mainly because of the jaded skin cream. This lucrative project has directly pulled up the profits by a large margin. “Ruofei, the jaded skin cream will generate more profits for the whole of next year. In addition, the pomfrets have also started to be sold on the market, and the prospects of the heart – nourishing soup are very good. So, the profits next year may increase by several times. I suggest that you lower the dividend ratio a little ...”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,” 5% is not high!” The more profits we create, the more dividends we should get!”

Feng Jing was silent. This rule was naturally very appropriate in other companies, but it wasn’t the case in paradise Corporation.

This was because Xia ruofei was the core of the entire company. Be it the jaded skin ointment, Chinese perch, or the highly profitable Dendrobium candids, Cordyceps, and Taoyuan Dahongpao, they were all created by Xia ruofei alone.

In comparison, the company’s administrative team and operations team only did some basic work.
