Chapter 1455: Guan Ping’s troubles (1)

Translator: 549690339

After breakfast, Xia ruofei bade farewell and left the Ling residence.

After all, they had to visit their relatives and friends during the first lunar month. At the same time, with Ling Xiaotian’s current status, there would definitely be many friends, relatives, and disciples who would come to visit.

Moreover, Xia ruofei had not returned to the farm since New Year’s Eve, while Feng Jing was still spending the new year at the farm. It was only right that he return to the farm.

After returning to Taoyuan farm, Xia ruofei went to the various posts as usual and expressed his condolences to the employees who had stayed on duty during the new year.

He even made a trip upstairs to his office. When he saw that Feng Jing wasn’t in, and most importantly, Dong Yun wasn’t here for overtime, he nodded his head in satisfaction.

Xia ruofei took out his phone and called Feng Jing. He laughed and asked,””Boss Feng, where are you?”

“Chairman ...” Feng Jing hesitated for a moment before saying,”I’m at Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory right now!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be stunned. He smiled bitterly and said,””Why aren’t you resting properly during the holidays? I saw that you weren’t in the office just now, so I wanted to call you to praise you ...”

“Consultant Dong wants to look into the pharmaceutical factory. I didn’t have anything to do, so I accompanied her here ...” Feng Jing said.

Fine! The two strong women were together again ...

“Chairman, what’s the matter?” Feng Rao asked again.

“It’s fine, it’s fine ...” Xia ruofei said.”But ... Just take a look. It’s still the holidays. If there’s anything, we can talk about it after the start of the new year!”

“I know. If there’s nothing else, I’m hanging up!” Feng Rao said with a smile, obviously not taking Xia ruofei’s words seriously.

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly and stopped trying to persuade them. He knew that it was useless unless he went to the pharmaceutical factory and took them away by force. However, this would dampen their enthusiasm for work. Since they were enjoying it, he might as well not care.

After walking around for a while, Xia ruofei decided to go back to the small villa. He played with lightning, Blackie, and the rest in the courtyard, basking in the warm winter sun and enjoying the rare leisure time.

......

That evening, on ancient tower Street in the Laocheng District of three mountains.

There were a lot of food stalls here, and the narrow streets were a little dirty and messy, but it was very popular.

Pang Hao strolled in from the corner of the street and walked to the entrance of a food stall with ease. He looked around.

A slightly thin youth was sitting behind an oily table. When he saw the obvious target, pang Hao, he immediately stood up and waved, calling out,””Little fatty, over here!”

Pang Hao’s small eyes immediately narrowed into a line as he quickly walked over. The fat on his body jiggled with his steps, making him look rather comical.

“Pingzi, you’re quite early, kid!” After pang Hao sat down, he lightly punched the shoulder of the thin young man opposite him.

This man was none other than Xia ruofei and pang Hao’s classmate, Guan Ping.

Last time, pang Hao had mentioned to Xia ruofei that Guan Ping had been unhappy with his work recently. Xia ruofei had asked pang Hao to invite Guan Ping out for a chat. Pang Hao knew that Xia ruofei had the intention to let Guan Ping work in the Paradise Corporation, so he had also contacted Guan Ping and arranged for this meeting.

Guan Ping’s eye bags were a little deep, and his face was filled with fatigue. It was clear that he had been working hard recently.

However, Guan Ping was still very happy to see his good friend from his high school days.

He smiled and said,”today is my treat!” The host naturally has to come earlier!”

“You brat ...” Pang Hao laughed and continued,”that fellow, ruofei, should be here soon! My appointment with him is at Sixo’ clock sharp. He has always been very punctual. ”

“It’s not easy to find this place, and it’s not convenient to park nearby. ” Guan Ping laughed and said,”let’s chat while we wait.”

“Nonsense! I ate skewers here every day when I was in high school, how could he not find it?” Pang Hao said,”it’s 5:50 right now. I bet he’ll definitely be here in ten minutes!”

As the two of them were talking, they heard a voice behind them.””Little fatty! Are you talking bad about me behind my back?”

Pang Hao turned around to look. Wasn’t that Xia ruofei? Speak of the Devil and the devil will come.

Beside Xia ruofei was a young man with a cold expression. It was ye Lingyun.

Xia ruofei had specially brought ye Lingyun over today. Firstly, it was to let him get closer to pang Hao and Guan Ping as they were all his Good Brothers. Secondly, it was to let ye Lingyun be his driver. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

He was definitely going to drink today. Although he could use his true energy to force the alcohol out of his body, it was not easy to explain. If he insisted on driving after drinking, it would inevitably be a bad example.

Pang Hao quickly put on a flattering expression and said exaggeratedly,””Oh great boss Xia, how would I dare to speak ill of you! I was just telling Hiroshi that you’ve always been very punctual!”

Xia ruofei glanced at pang Hao speechlessly, then turned to Guan Ping and said with a smile,””Pingzi, it’s been a long time since we got together!”

“RUO Fei is here!” Guan Ping also stood up and said with a smile,”come and sit! Who is this brother?”

“Oh, let me introduce him. He’s Ye Lingyun, a comrade from my old army!” Xia ruofei replied,”he’s in charge of security in my company! Ling Yun, this is Guan Ping, one of my best friends in middle school!”
