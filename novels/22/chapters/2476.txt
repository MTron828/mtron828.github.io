2477 Reaching an agreement (2)

“Director Xia, there’s no need for that, really ...” Zhou leiyun said after some hesitation.

“Director Zhou, if we’re working together, please follow my plan. Otherwise, I don’t want this chest advertisement anymore!” Xia ruofei said.

This was a matter of principle. Xia ruofei did not want to go against his principles just to save some money.

The advertisement on the chest of the Jersey was a little different from the previous share transfer.

Those shares were all owned by Zhou leiyun’s glory world Corporation. Even if he gave it to his friends for free, no one would say anything about it, let alone giving it to them at a cheaper price.

However, it was different for the Jersey breast advertisement. Zhou leiyun only had 54% of the shares in the club, and the other 40% was owned by others. If Zhou leiyun sold the Jersey breast advertisement at a low price, the other shareholders would also have some objections. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Although Zhou leiyun’s shengshi group had absolute control over the Spanish clubs and had absolute authority, it was not a good thing to leave a bad impression.

Besides, Xia ruofei felt that it was worth it to spend three million euros on the chest advertisement for a season. There were 30 to 40 games in a season. Every game would be broadcast live in China and would attract a large number of Chinese viewers. Once again, there were Chinese people in the LA Liga. The Chinese advertisement on the chest of the LA Liga team’s Jersey was very eye – catching. The effect of the advertisement was definitely worth three million euros.

Seeing Xia ruofei’s firm attitude, Zhou leiyun could only say helplessly,””Alright then! We’ll do as you say, President Xia ...”

Zhou leiyun could not help but say,””Actually ... Even if Wu Lei joins, RCD Espanyol is only a mid – tier team in the league after all. A 50% increase in the chest advertisement is still a bit too high. It’s not worth it ...”

The seller kept pushing the price down, which was a wonder.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it’s only three million euros. It’s not a big deal. Don’t worry about it, director Zhou.” Moreover, if Wu Lei performs well in the next few rounds of the league tournament, or if we are a little bolder and Spain enters the European League this season, wouldn’t I make a big profit?”

Zhou leiyun forced a smile and said,”European war?” We can’t even dream of it. Our team is still struggling to avoid relegation!”

“So miserable?” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“In fact, the ranking is not bad. There are still five teams behind us. It’s just that this year’s La Liga is polarized and the points gap between the last dozen teams is very small. Although we are ranked sixth from the bottom, we are only two points away from the relegation zone. It’s only a matter of one game.” Zhou leiyun laughed bitterly.”And we still have bar?a, Atletico Madrid, and sevilya as our opponents ... So this season is very dangerous! If we really get demoted, your three million euros will be wasted!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”then let’s take a gamble!” Wasn’t the martial Ball King joining? The Espanyol will definitely rush up in the last dozen rounds and it’s impossible to be relegated!”

“Then I’ll count on your blessings!”

“Of course! I’m going to be a shareholder of Spain soon! And he’s a major shareholder!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“That’s true, that’s true ...” Zhou leiyun could not help but laugh.

Zhao Yongjun saw the two of them talking and laughing, and he couldn’t help but feel envious. He said,””You two nouveau riche, can’t you keep a low profile? A poor man like me is right next to you! Can’t you consider the feelings of a pauper?”

“Director Zhou said he’d bring you out to play, but you didn’t want to!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Yongjun is sticking to his principles.” Zhou leiyun smiled and said,”he’s always been like this. This is what I admire most about him!”

“Don’t flatter me!” Zhao Yongjun said,”now that your business is done, shouldn’t you treat me, the witness, to a meal?”

“Sure! There’s a ready – made place to eat in our Taoyuan club! Ling’s private kitchen, just eat and order whatever you want, just put it on my tab!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“You’re really good at saving money!” Zhao Yongjun couldn’t help but laugh.

The three of them chatted and laughed as they left the lounge. Xia ruofei went to look for Ling Qingxue, Song Wei, and the rest. Zhou leiyun did not leave either. Instead, he gave a call to the person in charge of the legal department in his Corporation and ordered them to quickly draft up the contract for the transfer of shares.

At the same time, he immediately made an overseas call to Spain asked the manager of the Spanish team to prepare a chest advertising contract for next season and send it over by email.

When the manager heard that a Chinese company had bought a season’s chest advertisement for three million euros, he was both surprised and happy. This was 50% more than the previous sponsorship contract! He quickly agreed.

At this time, the Spain team had just started work. The club had a dedicated legal counsel, and the template of the sponsorship contract was ready – made. The contract was drafted very quickly and sent to Zhou leiyun’s email.

On glory world corporation’s side, the legal department had also completed the share transfer contract at the fastest speed possible and had even sent an experienced lawyer to the Paradise society.

……

Paradise club’s mini golf course.

Xia ruofei and the rest were there to experience golf.

Song Rui stood in front of the golf ball with the club. After a few strokes, he swung the club high. With a “clang”, the White golf ball immediately flew high up.

However, song Rui didn’t control his strength very well. What was worse was that his judgment of the wind direction and wind power had a big deviation. After he threw the pole, he knew that he had missed it, and it was a little too far off.

Sure enough, the White golf ball eventually landed in a sand pit on the side. It was the complete opposite of song Rui’s original plan.

In the end, it took song Rui seven golf balls to put the four holes in the hole.

Xia ruofei walked to the starting point and looked at the hole from afar. He raised the cue and closed one eye as if he was aiming. After looking for a while, he extended his thumb to measure the distance.

Song Rui, who was depressed, couldn’t help but say,””Are you still fighting?”

“Of course, how can we not fight?” Xia ruofei chuckled and asked,”by the way, how many shots have you lost to me?”

Song Rui couldn’t help but sneer and said,””Song Wei is calculating! You won’t be left out!”

” 10000 Yuan for one?” Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”let me confirm!”

“Ten thousand dollars!” Song Rui’s face turned even uglier. He felt his heart ache at the thought of the Number of poles he was behind.

How long had it been? He was already so far behind.

Xia ruofei even said that he had never played golf before and that his swing posture at the start was not very standard. However, after a few shots, he became like a professional athlete.

No! He was even more perverted than a professional golf player. No matter how he played, he would get it ...

I don’t believe you! He actually thought that he was a rookie!

This bad old man is really evil!

Xia ruofei chuckled and asked,””By the way, Xiao Rui, I really don’t know much about golf. I made the three – hole hole in one go. You said it was called an Eagle ball? This was a hole in four, but what about a hole in one? What should it be called?”

“You’re thinking too much, aren’t you?”song Rui said with an exaggerated expression. You want to get a hole in one after four holes? Do you really think you’re a god?”

Xia ruofei smiled and swung the club.

With a bang, the golf ball flew high into the air and accurately flew toward the small hole in the distance where the flag was inserted. After landing, it jumped a few times on the grass and then slowly rolled toward the hole ...

The return point for the level four hole was actually quite far from the hole. It was impossible to see it clearly from where they were standing. However, song Rui could roughly see that the golf ball landed quite accurately. Even if it was not a hole in one, with Xia ruofei’s fiery hand, he could easily push the golf ball in with a push rod.

Song Rui could not help but feel speechless ...
