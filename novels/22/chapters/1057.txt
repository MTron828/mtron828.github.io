Chapter 1058: The final auction item (1)

Translator: 549690339

Ma Zhiming, who was sitting beside Xia ruofei, could not help but turn his head and look at him with envy.

Ma Zhiming wasn’t that envious of paradise corporation’s profits this time. Tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of funds were nothing in the eyes of a wealthy family like him. He was only envious of Xia ruofei’s company, which had only been established for a little more than a year. Moreover, the team was so young, but they could achieve such dazzling results.

Ma Zhiming had also inherited MA Xiong’s business acumen. He had slowly begun to take control of his family’s business empire. A few years ago, Ma Zhiming had used the funds given to him by MA Xiong to start a company, and the profits had been very good.

However, no matter what kind of achievements he made, it was inevitable that he would be labeled as MA Xiong. Others were more envious of his good life, outstanding reincarnation skills, and a good father, but they often ignored the efforts he had put in.

This situation was similar to that of young master Wang in the mainland.

Hence, Ma Zhiming was especially envious of young people like Xia ruofei who started from scratch and built their own business Kingdom from scratch.

Xia ruofei sat below the stage and looked at Feng Jing, who was standing by the side of the stage. She had a faint smile on her face and exuded a strong sense of confidence. Feng Rao seemed to have felt something and looked at Xia ruofei. The two of them smiled at the same time.

At this time, the auction for the second top – Quality one – headed abalone had already begun. This abalone weighed about 613 grams, and the bidding was also quite enthusiastic.

In the end, the abalone was sold at a price of 2.92 million Hong Kong dollars. It was also won by a bidder from the normal District, who was a glutton from a well – off family.

The auction went on quite smoothly.

Starting from the third one – headed abalone, the final price had already exceeded 3 million Hong Kong dollars.

In the audience, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be stunned. He had a small agreement with Tang He. That was, if the transaction price exceeded 3 million Huaxia dollars, the sales of the abalones produced by paradise Corporation in North America would be entrusted to shengbang Corporation.

It seemed that he had lost the bet.

3 million Hong Kong dollars and 3 million Chinese dollars were basically the same value. There were still 15 abalones waiting to be auctioned, and their weight was gradually increasing. It would be too easy for them to exceed 3 million Chinese dollars.

Of course, Xia ruofei would not be dejected even if he lost the bet.

With the strength of shengbang group, and the cooperation area was the headquarters of shengbang group, the Paradise company would not suffer a loss no matter what.

Xia ruofei’s principle was that, with the exception of Paradise Farm, the company’s shares must not be further diluted. Furthermore, he had no plans to go public in the future. He wanted to have 100% control over the company.

Xia ruofei would not mind working with other companies during the company’s development.

The auction was live – streamed on the Internet. Xia ruofei didn’t know if Tang He was watching it on the computer. If he was, the old man should be very proud now. Xia ruofei thought to himself.

The abalones were being auctioned off one after another.

Everyone’s bidding enthusiasm was always high, and the final price kept rising until it was around 3.9 million Hong Kong dollars.

The first 18 top – Quality one – headed abalones were sold out very quickly. In the end, the average price of each abalone was about 3.6 million Hong Kong dollars. In addition to the three extra large two – headed abalones that were used to warm up the auction, the total transaction price was about 70 million Hong Kong dollars. This had far exceeded Xia ruofei’s expectations.

In fact, when an abalone weighed more than 620 grams, the rich people in the VIP area would compete with each other. The last two abalones weighed more than 630 grams, and their prices exceeded 4 million Hong Kong dollars. That was why the average price of the first 18 abalones was raised to about 3.6 million Hong Kong dollars.

There were only three top – grade one – Head abalones left in the auction. They were the heaviest and of the highest quality among the items.

More than half of the rich people in the VIP area didn’t bid at all, and there were only a dozen people who bid for the abalone.

These were all billionaires, so everyone’s target was actually concentrated on the final auction item. It was conceivable that the competition for these three abalones would be quite fierce, especially the last one, the “abalone King” that weighed 653.2 grams. It was estimated that it would set off a “bloody storm”.

Everyone was filled with anticipation, waiting for this exciting moment.

Even the eyes of many rich people in the VIP area were filled with eagerness.

Lu zhongguang’s voice also became more excited. He said loudly,””Ladies and gentlemen! The next item up for auction is our final item! The final three abalones all weighed more than 635 grams, far exceeding the standard weight of a one – headed abalone! It’ll be difficult to buy such high – Quality abalones in the future if you miss them!”

There were three trays on the stage in the middle of the stage, all covered with red silk. Lu zhongguang pulled the red silk off the tray on the left, revealing a huge abalone.

“Let’s cut to the chase. Let’s start the auction for the first Finale abalone!” Lu zhongguang did not even need to look at the cue card. He already knew the situation of the three abalones.”This abalone weighs 638.8 grams. The starting price is 3 million Hong Kong dollars. Each bid must be at least 100000 Hong Kong dollars!”

As soon as Lu zhongguang finished speaking, someone in the VIP area immediately raised his sign.

“3.5 million!” A middle – aged man with a balding head raised his sign and shouted.
