3153 Blasted off the stage (2)

Xia ruofei and Chen Xuan frowned at the same time. Of course, they did not question it just because of the title.

On the other hand, Song Wei’s face darkened when she heard the topic of the speech. She raised her head and stared at Shen Heping.

Obviously, Shen Heping’s research group didn’t name this artificial intelligence “Xiao Wei” randomly, which made Song Wei very uncomfortable.

When Shen Heping spoke, he kept looking at Song Wei.

When Song Wei’s angry gaze fell on him, he immediately showed a smile that he thought was very charming. Then, he pressed a shortcut key to output the contents of the computer screen to the projector. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Everyone immediately saw the contents of Shen Heping’s computer on the projection screen.

The PowerPoint on this page had a big title, and there was a cartoon of a girl on the bottom left. It was probably the AI Xiao Wei.

This was normal. In the research of artificial intelligence, regardless of whether they were really intelligent or the commonly seen “artificial retards,” most of them would have an anthropomorphic image, and most of them were female. After all, women were naturally more approachable.

Even Wang Chi could not help but frown at the cartoon figure. Chen Xuan and Xia ruofei were even more displeased.

Song Wei’s face was as dark as water, and she looked at Shen Heping with disgust.

The reason was simple. The cartoon figure was too similar to Song Wei.

Her style of dressing, hairstyle, and appearance were at least 80% similar to Song Wei ‘s.

“Associate Professor Shen, isn’t this a little inappropriate?” Chen xuanxian asked with a frown.

Chen Xuan really treated Xia ruofei as his good friend. Song Wei was Xia ruofei’s cultivation partner, but Shen Heping used Song Wei’s image as an artificial intelligence to “train” her every day. If this was in the world of cultivation, he would have drawn his sword against her long ago.

Shen Heping had an innocent expression on his face as he shrugged his shoulders and asked,””Sir, what do you mean? I’m sharing my research results now. If you have any questions, wait until I’m done speaking, don’t interrupt me. This is the most basic etiquette, don’t you understand?”

In Shen Heping’s eyes, Xia ruofei still had some weight. After all, Xia ruofei was richer than him! However, it was just a little bit, and the amount was very limited.

As for Chen Xuan, Shen Heping didn’t even care about him.

The academic world had never heard of such a person. Moreover, he had been following Xia ruofei the entire day. He was obviously just a follower.

Therefore, Shen Heping was not polite at all when he spoke to Chen Xuan. In fact, he was even a little overbearing.

If the people in the world of cultivation knew that the young master of the first heaven society was treated as a follower by an ordinary person, they would laugh their heads off.

Xia ruofei stopped Chen Xuan with his eyes and said,””Associate Professor Shen, we’re talking about the application of supercomputing today. The artificial intelligence you’re talking about has nothing to do with today’s topic.”

“President Xia, you definitely know more about business than me, but in terms of scientific research ...” Shen Heping said casually,”some things still need to be done by professionals. How do you know that artificial intelligence and supercomputing have nothing to do with each other?”

Shen Heping’s words were unreasonable. The research of artificial intelligence naturally required the use of supercomputers, but it had deviated from today’s topic. This was an indisputable fact.

From the topic of the speech, one could tell that Shen Heping’s speech today was to brag about his research results and use ‘Xiaowei’ to show off in front of Song Wei. Such content would not be of any help to Xia ruofei and Chen Xuan.

It was like the organizers had spent a lot of money to invite a singer to sing, but when he arrived at the venue, the singer did a stand – up comedy for everyone.

Xia ruofei and Chen Xuan looked at each other, not knowing whether to laugh or cry.

Shen Heping’s self – righteousness made Xia ruofei feel that it was ridiculous.

He was too lazy to argue with Shen Heping, so he directly beckoned the staff member next to him over and ordered,””Turn off the projector and the microphone on the podium.”

The staff of the Paradise clubhouse naturally didn’t care if the other party was an expert or a professor. They would definitely listen to Xia ruofei.

So, he nodded without hesitation, then quickly walked to the temporary control desk next to him. He turned the microphone to the lowest volume, picked up the remote control, and turned off the projector.

Shen Heping did not expect Xia ruofei’s solution to be so simple and brutal. His face turned ashen as he slammed the table and asked,””What’s the meaning of this?”

Xia ruofei leaned back in his chair and said,””Since Associate Professor Shen doesn’t have a speech on the topic of this exchange meeting, then in order to save everyone’s precious time, Associate Professor Shen doesn’t need to speak. You can come down!”

Guo Qian and Li Yufu looked at each other. They had attended many social events, but this was the first time they had seen such a tense situation.

In the past, the organizers had always treated the experts and professors like Masters. They had never been as domineering as Xia ruofei.

Wang Chi was also caught off guard. Shen Heping was someone he had brought along. Although his performance was indeed a little outrageous, Xia ruofei’s tough attitude was also beyond his expectations.

Wang Chi looked at Shen Heping’s ashen face and cleared his throat,””President Xia, Shen’s research has some new things. Actually ... There’s no harm in listening to it, right?”

Xia ruofei sat up straight and said,””Academician Wang, I’m sure you know what we want to hear about this exchange. After all, we’ve already communicated with you and the leaders of the other two universities. I’m just a businessman. I may not understand the big picture, but I also know that time is precious, and wasting time is a shameful behavior! Moreover, what this Associate Professor Shen is teaching is not what we need at all. It won’t bring us any benefits, so there’s really no need to listen. ”

Song Rui also rolled his eyes and said,””We have a lot of things to do every day. How can we have the time to listen to his artificial intelligence? I think this Associate Professor Shen really doesn’t know his place. Since there’s nothing we want to hear, why did he come here and join in the fun?”

Song Rui had always been a person who didn’t care about anything. He even dared to talk back to an academic Big Shot like Wang Chi, not to mention that Shen Heping’s level was far from Wang Chi ‘s! He didn’t even put people like Shen Ping in his eyes.

Wang Chi saw the other party’s domineering attitude and revealed a trace of displeasure. He felt that he had lost face.

However, when he thought about the cautious attitude of the person who had entrusted him with this task, he quickly suppressed his unhappiness.

At Wang Chi’s level, he was no longer just a scholar or an expert. To be more precise, he was a “feudal lord”. He was not simply immersed in research. He had to consider all aspects of relationships and resources. Of course, all of this was to serve his academic career. But no matter what, Wang Chi was actually more like an official.

He naturally would not rashly offend those who obviously had a deep background for Shen Heping.

Thus, Wang Chi chose to keep his mouth shut.

In this way, Shen Heping was left hanging on the stage. His chest was rising and falling rapidly, and his expression was extremely ugly.

This was the first time he had faced such “humiliation” since he returned to the country. Perhaps his previous life had been too smooth, making him forget himself.

Shen Heping pointed at Xia ruofei with a trembling finger and said with hatred,””You’re all unreasonable! You guys don’t understand academia at all, yet you’re here pointing fingers! It’s an insult to academia to talk about academics with you!”

Xia ruofei said calmly,”Associate Professor Shen, I advise you to come down yourself.” Don’t delay academician Wang’s speech. ”

At this point, Xia ruofei paused for a moment and glanced at Shen Heping indifferently. Then, he continued,””If I were you, I’d come down myself. Otherwise, it won’t look good when the security guards ask you to come down. Since you’re not prepared for today’s exchange, why don’t you go out and take a look? The hot spring in the Paradise clubhouse is not bad. There’s also a Western restaurant and a lingji private restaurant. The dishes there are also very special. You can go and try them. Just put it on my bill ...”
