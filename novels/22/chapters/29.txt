Chapter 30: Hitting A Nail

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

It was Tian Huilan, who had rushed to the Linhai Police Station with the Public Security Bureau, the Southeast Province Military District, and the Three Mountains Police Team.

Tian Huilan’s heart skipped a beat when she saw the armed police surrounding the police station.

When she saw a few police officers at the entrance of the interrogation room charging at the door with equipment, and Deputy Director Zheng of the Changping County Public Security Bureau, who was in charge of the scene, still holding a gun in his hand, urging the police officers to speed up the process with a ferocious expression, she could not help but be furious and shout at them to stop.

Deputy Chief Zheng was furious because of Xia Ruofei’s attitude. In addition, he was the leader of the county office, so he scolded without turning his head.

“F*ck! Who dares to stop me? You must be tired of living!”

When Chen Bo, the director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, who had come with Tian Huilan, saw this, he was almost scared out of his wits. He hurriedly took a step forward and shouted.

“Zheng Xiaodong! Who are you scolding? The words that come out of your mouth are all vulgarities. Do you still have the demeanor of a party member? How outrageous!”

Deputy Director Zheng Xiaodong was just overwhelmed with anger. In addition, a bureaucrat of his level did not have much chance to come into contact with the city leaders, so he was not familiar with Tian Huilan’s voice. However, Chen Bo was his direct supervisor, the boss of the city’s Public Security Bureau. How could he not recognize Chen Bo’s voice?

Zheng Xiaodong trembled and turned around in shock. Only then did he realize that there was a group of people standing behind him, all glaring at him.

One of them was a middle-aged woman in a black business suit. Her face was dark and her eyes were cold.

Meanwhile, his boss, Chen Bo, and a senior colonel officer accompanied the middle-aged woman on both sides. Even a fool could tell that this woman’s status was even more impressive than Chief Chen’s.

Immediately after, a bolt from the blue struck Zheng Xiaodong’s mind because the more he looked at this woman, the more familiar she looked… This… Wasn’t this Mayor Tian, who appeared in the Three Mountains News every day?

‘Did I curse at Mayor Tian just now? And I cursed her so badly?’ Zheng Xiaodong’s mind went blank. Beads of sweat rolled down his forehead and his face turned extremely pale.

“Chief Chen… I… I…” Zheng Xiaodong stammered with a pale face.

Chen Bo glanced at Zheng Xiaodong as if he was looking at a dead man and snorted coldly without saying anything.

In Chen Bo’s opinion, Zheng Xiaodong was indeed no different from a dead person. Now that the highest ranked official here was Tian Huilan, he naturally wouldn’t overstep his boundaries.

Tian Huilan asked coldly.

“Who are you?”

Zheng Xiaodong quickly said.

“Reporting… reporting to Mayor Tian… I’m the Deputy Director of the Changping County Public Security Bureau, Zheng Xiaodong… I didn’t know…”

Usually, if the leader asked for his name and position, Zheng Xiaodong would definitely be overjoyed because this meant that the leader had an impression of him! But that day, Zheng Xiaodong felt as if he had lost his soul. He had left an impression, and it was extremely deep, but it was an extremely bad one.

Sure enough, Tian Huilan was not interested in listening to Zheng Xiaodong’s explanation at all. She directly interrupted him and asked.

“Deputy Chief Zheng, what were you doing just now?”

Zheng Xiaodong glanced at the interrogation room in surprise, and a ridiculous thought appeared in his mind. Could Mayor Tian, Chief Chen, and the others be here for that fellow inside?

But he dismissed the idea in an instant, because it was indeed ridiculous. Besides, Li Zhengyi had reported to him that the two women were the daughter and widow living on the Little Island Village. How could they have alerted the mayor?

Mayor Tian must have been doing a sudden inspection and happened to be here.

Zheng Xiaodong firmed up his thoughts and quickly organized his words in his mind before saying.

“Mayor Tian, I’m leading a team to deal with an emergency. A suspect kidnapped one of our police officers during the escort. We’ve already cornered him in the interrogation room and are preparing to attack. Just now… just now, because the situation was complicated, I… I didn’t know that you were here, so please forgive me!”

Tian Huilan’s expression did not change at all. She did not comment on Zheng Xiaodong’s explanation and only continued to ask.

“A suspect? What’s his name?”

Zheng Xiaodong really did not know Xia Ruofei’s name. Hearing this, he quickly looked at Su Ruiwu and Li Zhengyi.

Su Ruiwu immediately lowered his gaze and pretended not to see it.

Li Zhengyi forced himself to come out and say.

“Mayor, the suspect’s name is Xia Ruofei. He’s suspected of causing trouble…”

When she heard Xia Ruofei’s name, Tian Huilan raised her eyebrows and her expression finally changed a little.

When Secretary Wu Liqian, who was half a body’s length behind Tian Huilan, heard this name, she could not help but be slightly stunned and revealed a thoughtful expression.

The one thing that Tian Huilan had asked her to do in the morning was to find out the identity of the young man who had saved Professor Tian. Wu Liqian had basically found out everything, but before she could report to Tian Huilan, she had to follow Tian Huilan to deal with the unexpected incident.

According to Wu Liqian’s investigation, the young man’s name was Xia Ruofei, and he had taken a bus to Changping County in the morning.

Could it be the same person? Wu Liqian thought to herself.

As Wu Liqian’s mind raced, Tian Huilan’s expression changed slightly. Then, she asked calmly.

“Deputy Chief Zheng, how were you going to deal with this sudden incident?”

Zheng Xiaodong immediately puffed out his chest and said.

“Reporting to Mayor Tian! The criminal suspect is extremely vicious. Not only did he beat up the villagers, but he also kidnapped police officers during the escort. He can be said to be lawless and extremely dangerous to society!”

“Therefore, I have already ordered the Criminal Police Brigade to organize a strong attack and authorized snipers to kill the suspects if necessary! Mayor Tian, the scene is very dangerous. Please take a seat in the lounge upstairs for the time being. Our Changping County Public Security Bureau is confident and capable of handling this sudden incident well!”

If he didn’t express his resolve, when would he be able to show it? In Zheng Xiaodong’s opinion, whether he could “make up for his mistake” depended on this. It would be best if he could kill the suspect cleanly and let the mayor see his capability. Perhaps she would let bygones be bygones.

However, he did not see that Tian Huilan’s expression was getting uglier.

As soon as Zheng Xiaodong finished speaking, a lieutenant colonel beside Tian Huilan suddenly said angrily.

“Bullsh*t! A bunch of useless officials! You are even going to shoot a suspect? If Xia Ruofei loses a single hair, I’ll shoot you!”

Zheng Xiaodong was dumbfounded by this sudden scolding. After a while, he stammered.

“How … how … how can you curse at me?”

The lieutenant colonel’s eyes widened.

“It’s a light punishment to even curse at you! You’re lucky I didn’t slap you!”

“You…” Zheng Xiaodong was, after all, the leader of the county’s Public Security Bureau and a leading officer of the main branch. He naturally couldn’t maintain his dignity after being scolded like this, and his face turned red and white.

However, with Tian Huilan, Chen Bo, and the other leaders here, he did not dare to flare up at all. He could only put on an aggrieved expression.

The lieutenant colonel glared at Zheng Xiaodong before turning around and saying. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Mayor Tian, Commissar Wu, Director Chen, I’m sorry… I didn’t control my emotions.”

Tian Huilan smiled and said.

“It’s fine! Director Niu, we’re all here to hold the line for you. You still have to handle this matter!”

This lieutenant colonel was Officer Niu Tao, who was in charge of the special retired personnel. Although he was called an officer, his rank was not low. Tian Huilan was not just being respectful when she called him “Director Niu”.

Among the leaders of this line of work, Tian Huilan, Wu Huai, and Chen Bo were all representing the Three Mountains City government. Even though Wu Huai was the political commissar of the garrison, he was also a member of the Three Mountains City Committee. This time, he was called over mainly because the military was involved.

The one who was really in charge of handling this matter was Niu Tao.

Niu Tao represented the provincial military region and had accepted the direct order from the Jinling warzone to handle this matter.

Therefore, Niu Tao did not stand on ceremony. He nodded at Tian Huilan and the others, then walked forward and pulled Zheng Xiaodong away. He came to the door of the interrogation room and said.

“Comrade Xia Ruofei, I’m Niu Tao from the provincial military. Please open the door and let him go! Don’t worry, we’ll definitely seek justice for you!”

As soon as Niu Tao said this, Zheng Xiaodong and Li Zhengyi’s faces turned pale. The two of them looked at each other and saw the deep shock in each other’s eyes.

The last thing they wanted had happened!

The city leaders and the military were actually all here for that fellow inside!

They had hit an iron nail…

At this moment, Zheng Xiaodong even had the intention to kill Li Zhengyi. It was one thing for him to court death, but now, he had actually dragged him down with him. And he was still foolishly trying to “perform” in front of Mayor Tian. This time, he was really done for!

Then a lazy voice came from the interrogation room.

“Are you one just because you said so? Why should I believe you?”

Niu Tao smiled bitterly. As expected of Guo Zhan’s most valued soldier! Even his tone was equally annoying…

Niu Tao sighed and leaned over to the peephole. He lowered his voice a little and said.

“Blood Wolf, stop playing… I’m your senior after all. Can you give me some face?”

When he heard the words “Blood Wolf”, Xia Ruofei’s heart finally relaxed. It was impossible to know the code names of the Lone Wolf Special Forces unless one was an insider.

Moreover, Xia Ruofei had also heard the commotion outside the door clearly. He did not think that Zheng Xiaodong would put on such a show just to capture him alive—after all, he was about to succeed in breaking down the door just now.

Click!

As everyone watched, the steel door to the interrogation room opened.

First to appear in the doorway was the auxiliary policeman, who staggered out after his release, a look of utter horror on his face.

Then, Xia Ruofei swaggered out, followed by Lin Qiao and Hu Zi’s mother.

Xia Ruofei walked up to Niu Tao and sized him up. His expression changed slightly as he asked.

“Are you Fire Wolf?”

Niu Tao said wryly.

“Looks like there’s still a picture of me in the hall…”

It turned out that Niu Tao was also from the Lone Wolf Commando Team, codenamed Fire Wolf. He was a soldier in the same year as the Wolf King, Guo Zhan, who was also his life and death partner.

However, Niu Tao had been seriously injured in battle ten years ago, and his body was left with injuries. He was not suitable to serve in the special forces, so he took the initiative to be transferred to the provincial military system to be in charge of special retired personnel.

The eyes of the special forces soldiers were naturally quite sharp. Although Xia Ruofei had only seen Niu Tao’s youthful appearance ten years ago, he still recognized him.

Xia Ruofei stood at attention and raised his head and puffed out his chest in a standard military salute.

“Good day, Chief!”

Niu Tao returned the salute and said.

“Comrade Xia Ruofei, you have suffered…”

After Xia Ruofei saluted, he returned to his lazy appearance and smiled.

“Fire Wolf, since you’re my senior, do me a favor!”

“What is it? Tell me!” Niu Tao agreed readily.

“Help me take responsibility for what happened today…” Xia Ruofei said.

Niu Tao had an ominous feeling, but Xia Ruofei didn’t give him time to react. After saying that, he shot out and arrived in front of Zheng Xiaodong in a flash.

“Xia—” was all Niu Tao could manage.

Slap!

In front of the city leaders, the garrison leader, and a large group of police officers, Xia Ruofei slapped Zheng Xiaodong hard on the face.

This slap was extremely heavy. Zheng Xiaodong was sent flying before landing heavily on the ground. He spat out two molars from his mouth and his cheek swelled up visibly.

There was dead silence…
