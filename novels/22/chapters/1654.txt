Chapter 1655: Temporary departure from the capital (2)

Xia ruofei was speechless. How could they make the time so tight? he casually said,””I know, I know. I will come to Australia as soon as possible!”

After hanging up, Xia ruofei returned to the private room.

“Ruofei, you’re not a good boy! He actually ran out to hide from the wine!” Song Rui, who was already a little drunk, shouted,”hurry up and drink three cups as punishment!”

Xia ruofei smiled and did not explain further. Anyway, with his current alcohol tolerance, he would not get drunk no matter how much he drank. Besides, he was about to do something that would seem to be letting his friends down ...

Xia ruofei poured himself another glass of wine and drank three in a row.

“Straightforward!” Song Rui shouted.

Xu Zi Xuan and the others also joined in the fun and started clapping.

Liu Jian poured a glass of wine and raised it to Xia ruofei.”Brother Xia, if you need us to do anything, just say it! Anyway, we’ll listen to your command for this period of time!”

Xia ruofei was a little embarrassed. He scratched his head and said,””That ... I was just about to tell you! I ... I have something urgent to attend to and need to leave the capital for a few days. I might have to wait a few days before I can talk about the formation ...”

“What?” Song Rui and Zhao Yongjun both shouted in unison.

Song Rui immediately said,”ruofei, are you joking?” What could be more important than this?”

Xia ruofei smiled awkwardly and said,”my business in Australia ... There’s something urgent that I need to deal with!” It wouldn’t take long! It won’t affect our business here!”

Song Rui asked,”what’s the rush?” Can’t you wait until you’re done with your business here?”

Xia ruofei said,”the situation over there is really urgent!” Besides ... We still need to prepare some materials, and we can’t start work for a while ...”

Zhao Yongjun then realized that Xia ruofei wasn’t joking. He quickly said,””Ruofei, the problem is that we can’t do anything in little Tang town after you leave!” He said.

“I won ‘t, I won’ t!” Xia ruofei quickly said,”I’ll make a list of the things I need today. You guys go and prepare them first! In addition, we don’t have much to do on that piece of land in the early stages. At most, the designers need to survey and measure the site ...”

“How can we let the designers in with the current situation?” Zhao Yongjun smiled bitterly.

Xia ruofei said,”it’s okay!” As long as it’s during the day, it’s best to go there at noon. Generally speaking, there won’t be too much of a problem!”

Zhao Yongjun knew that Xia ruofei had already made up his mind. He said helplessly,””Okay then ... Come back quickly and settle the things over there as soon as possible!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said,”I won’t take too long. Don’t worry!”

“By the way ...” Xia ruofei said,”if we don’t have enough money on our account these few days, let me know immediately. I can pay for it first!”

“You don’t have to worry about this!” Zhao Yongjun waved his hand and said,”take this land as a mortgage. It should be approved very soon. There will definitely be enough funds for the early stage!”

After everyone had finished eating, Xia ruofei directly listed out the materials needed for the reversal formation on his phone and sent it to their WeChat group, letting Xu Zixuan and the others use the next few days to prepare.

On the way back to the courtyard house, Xia ruofei used his phone to book a ticket from the capital to Australia the next morning. Then, he called Ling Qingxue to report to her. Ling Qingxue was used to Xia ruofei running around and she was very understanding. She repeatedly reminded Xia ruofei to be careful when he was out.

Xia ruofei suggested that he take Ling Qingxue to Australia as a vacation to relax. However, Ling Qingxue had been busy with work recently. Although she wanted to go, she could only wait for the next opportunity.

Then, Xia ruofei called Feng Jing.

As the head of the company, she had to inform Feng Jing before going overseas. She had called Ling Qingxue just now and talked about going to Australia together. She also gave Xia ruofei a reminder. Was ran ran going to bring Feng Jing along this time?

After Feng Jing came to work at paradise Corporation, it could be said that she worked hard without any complaints. As the boss of the company, he had to pay more attention to such employees. Not to mention, Paradise Farm was also considered an overseas business of the Paradise Corporation. As the company’s general manager, Feng Jing had yet to inspect it!

Xia ruofei felt that it made more sense. So, after briefly telling Feng Jing that he was going to Australia, he immediately said,””CEO Feng, I want to bring you along to Australia this time. You can put aside your work for now!”

Feng Rao, who was resting in her dormitory, heard this and her heart skipped a beat. She blushed and said,””Why did you bring me along? There’s a lot of things to do at the company!”

“After you joined the company, you didn’t even take a break for the Spring Festival. The company is thriving under your leadership. As your boss, I have to reward you well! Otherwise, what if you run away?” Xia ruofei made a joke and continued,”besides, you’re the General Manager. You haven’t even been to our overseas farm. This isn’t appropriate. This time, I’ll take you to Paradise Farm for an inspection!”

Feng Rao wanted to decline, but she realized that it was difficult to reject Xia ruofei’s suggestion. She said weakly,””Ruofei, I can’t leave the company ...”

Xia ruofei said,”isn’t dong Yun already employed?” She should be able to help you share a lot of pressure! Take advantage of your trip to Australia in the next few days and hand over the company’s administrative affairs to her temporarily. At the same time, you can also observe her ability! We’re training her to be the Vice President, let’s see if she can do it!”

The more Xia ruofei spoke, the more he felt that it made sense, so he said firmly,””It’s decided! I’ve booked a ticket to Australia for tomorrow morning. Arrange the work at hand immediately and meet me in Beijing by tonight at the latest! Oh right, I’ll send you my flight number. Ask your administrative colleagues to book a ticket for you on the same flight immediately! Remember to book a first – Class ticket! The company will reimburse the expenses!”

After that, Xia ruofei hung up the phone and found his ticket page. He took a screenshot and sent it to Feng Jing.

Three mountains, Taoyuan farm.

Feng Jing sat cross – legged on her bed in the dormitory, her face still a little red. Xia ruofei had made his decision in a domineering manner. She could not help but criticize him in her heart, but subconsciously, she was filled with anticipation for this trip to Australia. Just thinking about it made her heart throb ...

She sat on the bed in a daze for a long time before she realized that time was tight. She quickly got up and sent a WeChat message to her assistant, asking her to book a ticket for the evening flight to Beijing and a ticket for the morning flight to Australia. She also sent the flight number in the screenshot of Xia ruofei’s flight to her.

Following that, Feng Jing got her assistant, Liu Qian, to inform the company’s top executives, including Dong Yun, Xiao Qiang, and pang Hao, to head to the meeting room for work. She had to hold an impromptu meeting to arrange the work at hand.

Feng Jing had already decided to follow Xia ruofei’s instructions. Dong Yun would temporarily be in charge of the daily affairs of the company, while Xiao Qiang and pang Hao would be in charge of the sales and financial matters. If there were any difficult decisions to make, they would call and report it immediately.

In fact, the current paradise Corporation had already embarked on the road of formal management. Everything had corresponding rules and regulations, and there would be no problems in the company’s operation just because a senior executive was absent.

Feng Jing had hesitated when she found out that Xia ruofei wanted to bring her to Australia. On one hand, it was because she had been employed by the Paradise company when it was still a workshop. She was in charge of all the company’s Affairs, big and small, and it had become a habit. On the other hand, it was naturally because of that trace of emotion in her heart that made her feel a little guilty.

Feng Jing had just used WeChat to arrange for her assistant, Liu Qian, to book the tickets and inform her of the meeting when her phone vibrated again.

Feng Rao took a look and her heart skipped a beat. It was Xia ruofei again.

She muttered in her heart,”could this guy have changed his mind again?” I’ve already asked Liu Qian to book the tickets ...
