Chapter 349: Welcome, veterans (2)

Ye linyun immediately put down the dustpan and said,””Brother Xia, the comrades I contacted have all arrived in the afternoon. I’ve asked them to settle down in the mobile house next to the construction site. Do you have time now? Is it convenient to meet them?” Xia ruofei’s eyes lit up.”Oh? All of them are here? What were they waiting for? Call them over!” “Alright!” Ye linyun said happily. He took out his phone and made a call. After a while, Xia ruofei saw three people standing in a row and one person standing in the middle of the left side of the row. The four of them formed a standard small team formation and walked into the villa in neat steps. Although the four of them were dressed in casual clothes, they could not hide the strong military temperament on their bodies. Each of them still had a short crew cut, and their waists were always straight, and every step they took was vigorous and vigorous. Xia ruofei nodded to himself. He used to be an elite member of the Special Forces, so he could tell that the four of them had excellent military quality. “Stand still!” The young man leading the team gave the order, and the four of them stopped in unison. He ran to ye linyun and said,””Class monitor ye, we’re here!” “Don’t just stand there,” ye linyun said with a nod.”Disband, disband. Come over here!” The three people who were still in line walked over quickly. “This is our boss! You can just call him boss Xia!” Ye linyun introduced. “Hello, boss Xia!” The four of them shouted in unison. Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””We’re all brothers. You guys can call me brother Xia like Ling Yun. ” “Yes!” Ye Lingyun then started to introduce the four old soldiers to Xia ruofei. He first pointed to the young man who had just led the team and said,””This is Lei Hu, he was an assaulter in the Army!” Lei Hu grinned at Xia ruofei and said,”Brother Xia, you can just call me Hu Zi!” Hu Zi ... At this moment, Lin Hu’s figure seemed to appear in front of Xia ruofei. This good brother who had blocked a bullet for him ... Xia ruofei was slightly dazed, but he quickly smiled and patted Lei Hu’s shoulder.””Alright, Hu, work hard in my company from now on!” “Yes!” Lei Hu straightened his back and replied in a deep voice. “Brother Xia; this is Hong Tao; he’s a sniper in the Army; This is Qin Xiaojun; The Dynamiter; and this is Xu Wei, in charge of field medical and communication. His marksmanship is not bad; so it’s not a problem for him to occasionally act as a sniper!” “Hello, brother Xia!” The three of them said in unison. Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””Good, not bad! One look and one could tell that they were all good soldiers! Ling Yun has told me about your situation. From now on, you can work in my company without worry. As long as I have something to eat, I will definitely not let you go hungry!” “Thank you, brother Xia!” The four of them said in unison, their eyes revealing a trace of excitement. All four of them came from rural areas, and their family conditions were relatively poor. These veterans were the backbones of the Army, but the skills learned by the special combat units were hardly useful in other places. Unless they went down the wrong path, ordinary companies would not need them at all. So before ye Lingyun called them, the four of them were living a precarious life. Some were working part – time jobs, some were security guards, and their days were tight. In addition, at this age, the heavy burden of the family gradually fell on their shoulders, so the pressure was also increasing. After coming to paradise Corporation, not only was the salary several times higher than before, but more importantly, his old comrades could get together again. People who came from the Army cherished their camaraderie very much. They also missed the time when they ate in the same pot in the military camp. Now that several Good Brothers could work in the same company, it was something that made them very excited. In addition, the salary was so high. It was really a dream job! Lei Hu looked at Xia ruofei curiously and asked,””Brother Xia, I heard from class monitor ye ... Where did you come from?” “There” naturally referred to the lone wolf assault team. This unit was very mysterious, and ordinary soldiers did not even know of its existence. Lei Hu and the others were all soldiers of the Special Forces, so they had heard of the lone wolf assault team. After all, every time the lone wolf absorbed new blood, the main members were from the Special Forces. Ordinary troops could not meet their requirements. Hence, when Lei Hu heard that Xia ruofei had retired from the famous lone wolf and had once been ye Lingyun’s training instructor, he was very curious about Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””Yup!” Lei Hu looked at Xia ruofei hesitantly and said,””But ... You look ...” “It doesn’t look like it?” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”in your imagination, the people who come out from there should be big and muscular men, right?” “That’s not it ...” Lei Hu said, a little embarrassed. Xia ruofei smiled and said,”there are many things that can’t be judged on the surface. For example, the four of you!” As long as you have a little experience, you can tell that you are soldiers from the way you walk. Those drug lords at the border are all very sharp. If lone Wolf’s people are all like you, how can you carry out the disguised investigation mission? We’re going to be destroyed as soon as we enter the mountain ...” In fact, when Xia ruofei had just left the Army, he was just like the four of them. Every step he took was a standard 75 centimeters. However, when he was on a mission, he could hide his strong military temperament according to his needs. It could be said that if he wore a bamboo hat and coarse clothes, he would be exactly like a border farmer walking in the mountains. Lei Hu revealed a thoughtful look. Xia ruofei laughed and patted Lei Hu’s shoulder.””Alright, the few of you should go and rest. I’ll let Ling Yun bring you around to familiarize you with your work tomorrow. If there’s a chance in the future, I’ll spar with you guys ...” With that, Xia ruofei turned around and walked into the villa. Xia ruofei only casually patted Lei Hu’s shoulder, but Lei Hu felt a huge force as if Mount Tai was pressing down on him, causing his waist to go soft and he almost knelt down. His shoulder was also burning. Lei Hu could not help but be shocked. As he watched Xia ruofei’s back as he left, a bright light flashed in his eyes. “Hu, what’s wrong?” Hong Tao asked curiously. Lei Hu came back to his senses and said awkwardly,”Oh ... It’s nothing ...” He couldn’t possibly say that the boss had given him a moderate amount of pressure the first time they met, right? In fact, when they saw Xia ruofei’s thin and weak – looking body, not only Lei Hu, but Hong Tao and the other two also felt that they could not believe that a person like Chi Chi lone wolf could be so weak. Hong Tao looked in the direction of the villa and asked curiously,””AI! How do you think brother Xia got selected for lone wolf? I think his body ... He can’t even reach the standard of the Special Forces. ” Ye linyun, who had been watching coldly from the side, snorted and said,””Hongtao, are you thinking of sparring with brother Xia? Do you want me to spar with you first?” “I wouldn’t dare, I wouldn’t dare.” Hong Tao quickly laughed.”How could I be a match for squad leader Xia?” “If you can’t even beat me, then you’d better not fight with brother Xia.” “Because brother Xia can easily subdue me with one hand ...” Ye Lingyun replied indifferently. “What?” Hong Tao, Xu Wei, and Qin Xiao Jun cried out in surprise. “Class monitor ye, although brother Xia is our boss, you don’t have to praise him like this!” Hong Tao laughed. I won’t believe it even if you beat me to death. Brother Xia is so weak that he can subdue you with one hand ...” Ye Lingyun looked at Lei Hu meaningfully and asked,”Hu, Hong Tao doesn’t seem to believe what I said. What do you think?”
