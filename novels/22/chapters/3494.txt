Chapter 3495: Consecutive breakthroughs i

Translator: 549690339

Li Yifu’s cultivation level was higher than Song Wei’s, so the speed at which he absorbed the Vermillion Jade Fruit was naturally faster.

In reality, in the trial Pagoda, even though Xia ruofei had broken through to the intermediate stage of the Golden elixir realm, which was much more difficult, he had woken up earlier than Ling Qingxue.

Therefore, Li Yifu was the same. Song Wei was still immersed in her cultivation, but he had already finished absorbing the Vermillion Jade Fruit and opened his eyes.

While absorbing the Vermilion Jade Fruit, Li Yifu’s consciousness was still clear, so he was very clear that his cultivation had undergone a tremendous change. As soon as he opened his eyes, he revealed an extremely excited expression and got up.

However, before he could say anything, Xia ruofei waved his hand and pouted at Song Wei.

Li Yifu immediately shut his mouth and stood quietly beside Xia ruofei with his hands by his side. However, he could not hide the excitement on his face.

Today’s experience was like a dream.

To be exact, it was from the moment he met Xia ruofei. Every step he took felt like a dream.

At that time, he was already over 80 years old, but it was difficult for him to advance on the path of cultivation. He was only a cultivator at the third Qi layer, but he was stuck at the third Qi layer for decades without making any progress.

At that time, Li Yifu had already given up on the idea of continuing to break through on the path of cultivation.

However, after meeting his grand uncle – Master Xia ruofei, his fate had changed dramatically.

Xia ruofei casually gave him a few pointers and he broke through the shackles of refined Qi Level 3. After that, Xia ruofei gave him the Guiyuan Scripture, which was much more perfect than the Guiyuan Scripture that he had cultivated before. In addition, Xia ruofei gave him some cultivation resources, including precious wild tea and spiritual crystals. With the help of the Taixu xuanqing formation, his cultivation started to break through and reached refined Qi Level 7 in just one or two years.

This time, he had completely subverted his understanding. He had only taken half a spirit fruit, but he had directly soared from lianqi Level 7 to the peak of lianqi level 9, almost touching the bottleneck of the Golden core stage.

It must be known that even breaking through from the seventh Qi layer to the eighth Qi layer was many times more difficult than when he broke through the bottleneck of the third Qi layer, not to mention breaking through two realms in a row. This was something he didn’t even dare to dream of, and it had actually become a reality today.

Back then, when the Earth’s cultivation environment was deteriorating, the Rogue cultivator who had fumbled his way forward on the thorny cultivation path alone could now see the threshold of the Golden core stage. How could Li Yifu suppress his excitement at this time?

Therefore, although he did not dare to speak, his heart was surging with emotions, and his body could not help but tremble slightly.

Li Yifu didn’t have to wait for too long. In just five to six minutes, Song Wei had also finished her cultivation.

Just like Ling Qingxue, Song Wei’s cultivation level reached the peak of refined Qi Level 6 after consuming half a Vermillion Jade Fruit. She was only one step away from refined Qi Level 7.

When Song Wei opened her eyes, Li Yifu had already knelt down in front of Xia ruofei before she could speak. Song Wei, who was initially overjoyed, was shocked. She swallowed the words that she was about to blurt out.

With Xia ruofei’s current cultivation and reaction speed, it would be easy for him to stop Li Yifu from kneeling. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

However, in a flash, he did not stop Li Yifu, but accepted the kneel.

Normally, when an 80 – year – old man knelt in front of him, he would feel uncomfortable. Xia ruofei could not avoid it, but he still accepted Li Yifu’s kneel.

He knew that Li Yifu’s gratitude came from the bottom of his heart, and the surging emotions needed an outlet to vent. It would not be a good thing if he forcibly stopped Li Yifu from kneeling. Of course, the most important reason was that Li Yifu was Xia ruofei’s Grand – disciple, and his Grand – Master was his direct senior. In the world of cultivation, strength and inheritance were more important. In comparison, age was not as important. From this perspective, it was reasonable for Xia ruofei to receive Li Yifu’s bow.

After Li Yifu knelt down, he respectfully kowtowed to Xia ruofei and said in a trembling voice,””Martial granduncle, your disciple has no way to repay you for your kindness. The only thing 1 can do is to work harder in my cultivation and strive to break through to the Aurous core stage as soon as possible so that I can share your burden in the future …”

Xia ruofei had a gentle smile on his face. He raised his hands in the air and Li Yifu was lifted up by a gentle force. He could not help but stand up.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”foster husband, I helped you because you’re a junior disciple of my sect. It’s also because you’re a pure and kind person. You’re worth cultivating. I don’t need you to repay me.” However, you really do need to work harder in your cultivation. You can’t relax just because your cultivation base has skyrocketed. You should know that you’re already over eighty years old, and only by breaking through to the Golden core stage as soon as possible can you run faster than the old age and break through the shackles of your longevity. Cultivation is to defy the heavens and change one’s fate. It’s not that easy. Time is of the essence for you, so You Must Remember This!”

Xia ruofei’s words were sincere. If Li Yifu had not met Xia ruofei, he might have been a low – Level Qi refining cultivator for the rest of his life. Even if he was lucky enough to break through to Level 4, he would have reached the limit of his achievements. A low – Level Qi refining cultivator could only live for about a hundred years before he would inevitably die. And if he could break through to the Golden core stage, then his lifespan would suddenly increase to about 300 years, so 80 years was not too old..
