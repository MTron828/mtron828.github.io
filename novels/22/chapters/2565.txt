In addition to Zidane, marca also interviewed the managers of several other La Liga teams and some well – known star players. They were also full of praise for Xia ruofei, especially those three goals, which were repeatedly mentioned.

Bar?a’s manager, valdeverté, even publicly said,”A good player like Xia should have a bigger stage, such as nokapu ...

Of course, the authenticity of the Barcelona manager’s offer of an olive branch to Xia ruofei was still open to discussion.

As the Spanish’s arch – enemy in the same city, bar?a naturally did not mind disgusting the Spanish team. If they could shake the morale of the other side, it would naturally be better.

Of course, they could not rule out the possibility that Barcelona was really interested in Xia ruofei. After all, any professional manager would be amazed by Xia ruofei’s strength after a careful analysis of that game.

In the face of Barcelona’s head coach, valverdyé’s open poaching, Ruby was very calm. He said,””I think Mr. Valwei must not have woken up! A Spaniard joining bar?a? He must be telling a cold jokes...Besides, Mr. Xia ruofei is not for sale in the Spanish team. He is now, he will be, and he will always be!”

Ruby’s response was quite firm. Of course, this was a normal attitude as a mortal enemy of the same city. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

However, regardless of Ruby or the other players of Espanyol, they intentionally or unintentionally avoided a question in the interview. Xia ruofei could not play for Espanyol for the entire season. At most, he could come over to support in some key games. From now to the end of the season, it was estimated that he would only play three or four games at most. It would not be appropriate to play more.

After all, Xia ruofei was mostly in China. Every time he played for the Spaniards, he had to fly a long distance across Eurasia. Moreover, he was a shareholder of the club. Who would dare to let the boss travel back and forth like this?

It was just that Ruby and the others deliberately didn’t mention this matter, which was a little interesting.

In the next few rounds, Spain’s opponents would spend a lot of effort studying Xia ruofei and setting up targeted defensive tactics.

Ruby had even planned to put Xia ruofei on the list as a smokescreen. There were 23 people on the list, and only 14 people could actually fight. It did not matter if one person was missing.

On the other hand, the Spanish team’s opponents only found out that Xia ruofei was not in the starting list when the game was about to start. He did not even come to the field. The expressions on their faces must have been very interesting.

The key was that many of the tactics he had laid out before were useless. It was like a boxer who had accumulated enough strength to punch out, only to find that the opponent had suddenly disappeared. This punch hit the air, and it was easy to hurt himself.

This was the case for these teams. When the time came to adjust the tactics at the last minute, to what extent could the players implement it? Would there be any loopholes in their coordination? These were all very possible.

This was the part that Xia ruofei could still play for the team even if he did not play in the game.

Xia ruofei didn’t care about the troubles in La Liga.

On the second day after the competition, he had already boarded Paradise’s private plane and was ready to fly back to China.

On the same plane as him were, of course, Xue Jinshan and the other employees of the Paradise company.

In addition, there was one more unlucky employee who needed to take a commercial flight back to China. Zhou leiyun had also decided to return to China, and he hoped to “hitch a ride”.

Naturally, Xia ruofei would not refuse, so he could only ask Xue Jinshan and the others to choose another “unlucky” person to change to a civil flight.

On Sunday afternoon, local time, the “peach origin” took off from Barcelona Airport and flew East ...
