Chapter 3813  Destruction before establishment (1)

    Until now, although the breakthrough was a little difficult, it was relatively smooth. Xia ruofei was also a little happy. Maybe he could really break through the bottleneck smoothly and save on the nascent formation pills. When Song Wei and the others broke through to the original infant stage, the success rate of the breakthrough would be greatly increased with these nascent formation pills.

  Of course, this thought only flashed across Xia ruofei's mind. As he was only halfway through his breakthrough, he quickly focused his attention and continued to operate the "great Dao technique" to increase the intensity of his absorption of spiritual Qi.

  In fact, when all the yuan Qi inside the purplish - Gold golden core was converted into liquid, the Golden core was already full, and the liquid could no longer be compressed.

  Xia ruofei continued to use his cultivation technique and forced the newly produced vital Qi into his purplish - Gold golden elixir.

  During this process, the purplish - Gold golden core trembled even more intensely.

  Breaking through to the nascent soul realm was essentially a process of destruction before establishment.

  In the end, the purplish - Gold golden core would be completely broken or even exploded into pieces. Then, it would be reassembled into a nascent soul.

  Therefore, this was a very dangerous process. For cultivators, breaking through from the Golden core stage to the original infant stage was a very big hurdle on the road of cultivation. The degree of danger was far greater than breaking through from the Qi refining stage to the Golden core stage, and even more dangerous than breaking through from the original infant stage to the original spirit stage.

  However, cultivation itself was going against the natural order of things. If one were to be afraid just because they knew there was danger, then it would be absolutely impossible to succeed.

  At this moment, Xia ruofei did not have any apprehensions or hesitation. He continued to circulate the "great Dao Sutra" with a determined expression and continuously forced his vital Qi into the purplish - Gold golden elixir.

  The purplish - Gold golden elixir was like a barrel of gunpowder.

  Xia ruofei really felt like he was going to explode. He knew very well that the purplish - Gold golden core was much tougher than the average golden core. If he wanted to break it, the "breaking" process would not be easy to complete. As for the process of "forming", Xia ruofei did not have much experience from his predecessors. After all, no one had condensed a Supreme - grade golden core like the purplish - Gold golden core. In other words, he could only explore on his own based on the experience of his predecessors and finally create a path that belonged to him.

  As more and more vital Qi poured in, the purplish - Gold golden core trembled more and more.

  However, Xia ruofei clearly felt a strong resistance. It seemed that his guess was right. The Golden core was too powerful. It would be much more difficult to break through.

  The feeling of "overeating" was becoming more and more obvious, but he still had to continuously increase the input of vital Qi. He had already broken through to this stage, so he couldn't give up halfway.

  This kind of feeling was naturally not good. Yingying was clearly very full, but she still had to keep stuffing food into her mouth. No one would feel comfortable if it was anyone else, not to mention that her stomach couldn't take it!

  Fortunately, Xia ruofei's military life had cultivated his tenacious character. The more difficult it was, the more determined he was. He had been gritting his teeth to overcome that uncomfortable feeling.

  This process continued for more than two hours. The purplish - Gold golden Elixir's vibration was getting stronger and stronger. Xia ruofei even felt that if it was not wrapped by his dantian, the purplish - Gold golden elixir would have flown out.

  Finally, Xia ruofei seemed to have heard a "crack" sound.

  This was, of course, his misperception, but he could clearly sense that the surface of his purplish - Gold golden core had already begun to crack.

  This greatly roused his spirit, and he continued to circulate the "great Dao Arts" cultivation technique, continuously and rapidly absorbing the rich spiritual energy from the purple origin crystals and the outside environment.

  As the vital Qi continued to be forced into the purple - Gold golden core, more and more cracks appeared on the surface of the Golden core.

  Finally, another critical point was crossed.

  The entire purplish - Gold golden core exploded.

  Xia ruofei felt as if he had heard a loud explosion. In fact, he felt the violent impact as well. The dantian where the purplish - Gold golden elixir was located was the first to bear the brunt of the impact. Xia ruofei's dantian was almost blown up by the violent impact. He felt something sweet in his throat and almost spat out a mouthful of blood. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

  Fortunately, Xia ruofei was not only strengthening his golden elixir during his cultivation. His dantian and meridians were also constantly being strengthened. If it was an ordinary cultivator, there would only be one result if such a strong explosion occurred in his dantian. His dantian would be blown to pieces. Even if he was lucky enough to survive, he would become a disabled person.

  This was also an important reason why the success rate of breaking through to the Yuanying stage from the Jindan stage was low and the risk was high.

  Although his dantian did not rupture, he was actually quite badly injured.

  Xia ruofei was rather good at treating injuries in the dantian. The prescription he gave Yu qingzi was the most appropriate. He also had the ink cloud grass and other supplementary herbs in stock in the space.

  However, he didn't have the time to care about that, and he couldn't stop to brew the medicine.

  Hence, Xia ruofei chose a simpler and crueler method. He planned to use the petals of the spirit Heart Flower to heal the injury in his dantian. He took out three petals in one go.

  Dantian injuries were more difficult to treat than other injuries. At this moment, Xia ruofei was at a critical juncture of his breakthrough and could not be calculative. Hence, to be on the safe side, he simply used three spirit Heart Flower petals in one go.
