After listening to Liu Kuan’s report last night, old man Liu had a rough idea of what Xia ruofei was going to do. However, when Xia ruofei told him about her choice, he had a different feeling.

After weighing the pros and cons, old master Liu had made clear cloud Island his top priority and hoped that Xia ruofei would choose this option. However, when Xia ruofei made this choice, he still felt very reluctant.

After all, he had poured too much blood, sweat, and tears into the blue cloud Island.

These complicated emotions lingered in old man Liu’s mind for a moment, but he quickly composed himself and nodded with a smile.””No problem! So ... You’ve decided to choose this plan? Green cloud Island and 500 million US dollars in cash. ”

Xia ruofei waved his hand.”You don’t need the money. You can just transfer the ownership of the island to me.”

“Just the value of the green cloud Island is not worth 3 billion US dollars, much less 40% of the shares of our family group.” Old man Liu said,”the value of the three proposals I’ve proposed are roughly the same.” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“It doesn’t matter. I only want the blue cloud Island.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”old man, I saved your family 500 million dollars. You should be happy!”

“But if that’s the case, I’ll feel even more apologetic!” Old man Liu said with a bitter smile. And ... I’m worried that old song will scold me for taking advantage of the younger generation! No! I really can’t take advantage of this! Blue cloud Island and the 500 million US dollars are bundled together. If you choose this plan, you have to have both. Otherwise, you can just choose one of the other two!”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. There was still someone who was in a hurry to give away money, and it was 500 million US dollars ...

Elder song probably played a big part in this. After all, 500 million dollars was not a small amount for house Liu, but it was within their budget. They could take it out all at once, so there was no need for them to give him a hard time.

Since old master Liu had said so, Xia ruofei did not insist.

He had originally thought that he had already taken a huge advantage by taking the blue cloud Island. Moreover, he was not in need of money now, so he had saved a little for the Liu family. However, old man Liu was firm in his decision, so he could not push the money away anymore. Otherwise, it would easily arouse suspicion.

Hence, Xia ruofei revealed a helpless expression and said,””Alright! Then we’ll do as you say!”

Old man Liu finally showed a satisfied smile and said,””That’s the way!”

“Since it’s already decided, let’s do it as soon as possible!” Old man Liu said.

With that, old man Liu pressed the call bell on the bed. Soon, a burly Man in Black walked in and bowed slightly to old man Liu.

“Go and call Liu Kuan and Qunfeng over,” said old man Liu lightly.

“Yes!” The black – clothed man replied respectfully, then turned around and walked out of the room.

After a while, Liu Qunfeng and Liu Kuan arrived at old master Liu’s room. They saw Xia ruofei sitting by the bed and nodded at him.

Seeing this, Liu Qunfeng knew that the results were probably out. He couldn’t help but feel a little nervous.

I hope it’s not the worst result! Liu Qunfeng said to himself.

“QUN FENG, Kuan, Xiao Xia has just chosen the treatment fee plan. He wants the plan of adding cash to the blue cloud Island ...” Old man Liu said.

When Liu Qunfeng heard this, his tensed heart relaxed. At the same time, he looked at Xia ruofei gratefully. After all, to him, 40% of the shares was the best choice. Xia ruofei might have considered his request if he did not choose to take the shares.

Liu Kuan had accompanied Xia ruofei throughout the tour of the island, so he was not surprised by Xia ruofei’s decision.

“Qunfeng, immediately ask your uncle Chongli to transfer the cash. The 500 million US dollars must be paid to little Xia within three days,” old man Liu continued.

Then, old man Liu looked at Xia ruofei and said,””Little Xia, you can provide the account number to QUN FENG later! Any account in the world will do. ”

Old master Liu knew that Xia ruofei probably had an overseas account to make it easier for him to use his funds.

Xia ruofei said,”Mr. Liu, there’s no hurry. 500 million US dollars is not a small amount. It’s not easy to get it all in three days.” I’m not in urgent need of money, so I can wait for a while, or I can pay in installments!”

“We can gather the funds in a short time,” elder Liu said with a smile.”Since you’ve chosen this plan, we also hope to fulfill the agreement as soon as possible.”

Xia ruofei smiled and did not say anything else. He understood the hidden meaning behind elder Liu’s words. He wanted the Liu family to fulfill their promise so enthusiastically. Naturally, he had to cure elder Liu as soon as possible. He could not use the excuse of not having enough medicinal herbs anymore.

“Alright!” Liu Qunfeng said. I will contact uncle Chongli immediately and ask him to raise the funds!”

Grandpa Liu nodded, then turned to Liu Kuan and said,””Kuan, I’ll leave the transfer of the blue cloud Island to you! I’ll have to trouble you to make another trip to the ponaafford map. ”

“Yes, master!” Liu Kuan said calmly.

Old man Liu explained to Xia ruofei,””When we first got the permanent ownership of blue cloud Island, we had an agreement with the agate map. We can transfer this ownership, and the agate map will also recognize it, but we need to go to them to make a record, and you also need to be there to confirm it.”
