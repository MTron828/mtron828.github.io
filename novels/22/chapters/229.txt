Chapter 230: News of the Phoebe zhennan (1)

“Young master Song!” The Man in Black called out respectfully. Song Rui smiled at Xia ruofei and said,”let’s go!” Get in the car, I’ll send you off first!” “No need! My car is parked in the airport’s parking lot!” Xia ruofei said,”I can drive back by myself.” “Alright then! Remember to contact me after you’re done. ” Song Rui said,”when my grandfather comes in a few days, he won’t have that much freedom!” “I know! You can go first!” Xia ruofei watched as song Rui’s Mercedes – Benz left the harbor Hall. Then, he walked to the parking lot and picked up his pickup truck, which was covered in a layer of dust. He drove away from the airport. Xia ruofei paid a total of 150 yuan for the parking fee at the airport’s exit. It turned out that the overnight parking fee was 30 yuan a day. Xia ruofei threw the receipt into the receipt box beside the driver’s seat and criticized,”The fees were a little too high ... He started the car and drove away from the airport toll booth. After driving for dozens of meters, Xia ruofei felt that the black Mercedes – Benz parked by the side of the road looked familiar. He fixed his eyes on it and saw song Rui standing by the side of the road. He was leaning on the car and smoking while looking in the direction of the incoming car. Xia ruofei slowed down and drove to song Rui’s side. He rolled down the window and asked,””Young master Song, what’s the situation? The car broke down?” Song Rui didn’t notice the dirty pickup at first, but he raised his head when he heard Xia ruofei’s voice. He opened his eyes wide and said,””F * ck ... Ruofei, why are you driving such a broken car? Aren’t you a businessman? You won’t be so miserable, right?” “Get lost!” Xia ruofei laughed and scolded,”what’s wrong with my car? It could be used for both passenger and cargo, and it was also sturdy! Buzzzzzz! Did your car really break down? Why don’t ... I reluctantly send you off?” Song Rui pouted and said,”tsk!” How could a Big Ben break down so easily? I purposely stayed behind to see how your car looks like, but I’m really disappointed!” “You’re really boring, kid!” Xia ruofei was speechless.”Alright, since your car is fine, I’ll leave first!” Then, Xia ruofei did not wait for song Rui’s reply. He put the car into gear and stepped on the accelerator. Before they could even go two kilometers, the black Mercedes whistled past the pickup, accompanied by song Rui’s whistle. Xia ruofei looked at song Rui’s arm stretching out of the window and shook his head with a bitter smile. He said in his heart,”I wonder if all the children of the big families are as childish as this kid ...” Xia ruofei drove unhurriedly until the black Mercedes – Benz drove away. When he could no longer see the taillights, he sped up. At dusk, Xia ruofei finally returned to Taoyuan farm. As soon as Xia ruofei got out of the car, lightning rushed out of the doghouse in the courtyard and threw itself onto Xia ruofei affectionately. Almost at the same time, ye Lingyun’s figure appeared at the door. He scanned the room vigilantly. After confirming that it was Xia ruofei, he called out respectfully,””Brother Xia, you’re back?” Xia ruofei hugged lightning and rubbed the fur on its head. Then, he smiled and asked,”Mm! Ling Yun, how’s the house these few days?” “Everything is normal!” Ye Lingyun replied,”it’s just that Chairman Ling from Ling Ji restaurant and President Zheng from Xi Jiang Yue came to the farm in person. They went back when they saw that you weren’t back. They looked quite anxious.” “I know.” Xia ruofei patted Lightning’s head and put it down. He continued,”it’s fine. They’re just worried that I won’t be able to supply enough vegetables. Now that I’m back, it’s fine. I’ll go out and bring back the vegetables for tomorrow.” “Alright,” he said. “Is everything else fine?” Xia ruofei asked. “They’re all good. The vegetables in the greenhouse are growing very well. Old Cao said that they might be able to harvest in more than ten days.” Ye linyun said. Originally, Cao tieshu had estimated that the vegetables with the shortest maturity period would be harvested in about a month. The current growth rate had also far exceeded his expectations. They would be able to ripen in a little more than 20 days. Xia ruofei nodded and said,”okay, I got it.” Then I’ll go in first. You should rest early if you have nothing to do. ” “Brother Xia, you can go back first!” Ye linyun said,”I’ll go to the farm to patrol again.” Ye Lingyun beckoned to lightning and walked out of the room, disappearing into the night. Xia ruofei entered the house with his suitcase. He first went to the big fish tank in the living room. Seeing that the two Blood Dragons were still alive and well, he was relieved. The fish tank was equipped with a very advanced circulation and filtration system. It was not a problem to change the water once a month. Furthermore, Xia ruofei was using the spiritual pool water in the interspace. It did not matter how long it would take. Xia ruofei opened his suitcase and found a bottle of petal solution with the lowest concentration. He dropped some into the fish tank. The two Blood Dragons were obviously much more excited. They swam happily in the wide fish tank, greedily absorbing the petal solution. Xia ruofei looked at it for a while, then went upstairs with his suitcase. He first called the managers of lingji F & B and Xi jiangyue, who were in charge of purchasing, to tell them that he had returned to San Shan and asked them to come over as usual tomorrow morning to pick up the dishes. The two managers were overjoyed. The cell phone signal in the ravine was not very good these few days. Xia ruofei mainly used the fixed – line phone to communicate with the outside world. They could not contact Xia ruofei and were almost driven crazy by their boss. Xia ruofei then called Ling Qingxue to let her know that he was safe. The two of them cuddled on the phone for a long time before they reluctantly hung up. After hanging up the phone, Xia ruofei remembered that he had to provide the vegetables tomorrow morning. Therefore, he took out the spirit map scroll and entered the space with a thought. He harvested the vegetables with ease and put them in the basket according to their type and weighed them. Then, Xia ruofei took the opportunity to check out the medium. It was still a thriving scene, especially the pair of little red Dragons. They were almost 40 centimeters long, a lot longer than their siblings in the other fish pond. Then, Xia ruofei went to the new space to play with Blackie and the others for a while. After giving them some food, he left the space. After keeping the painting, Xia ruofei went downstairs to get the pickup truck. In fact, he had only gone to the beach to smoke a few cigarettes and rested for about half an hour before he drove back. Xia ruofei found an empty spot on the road and took out the vegetable basket from the medium and placed it in the car. In order to keep the vegetables fresh, Xia ruofei sprinkled a lot of space spirit pool water on the vegetables. After returning to the villa, Xia ruofei asked ye Lingyun to help him move the vegetables to the garage and then went upstairs to his room. After returning to his room, Xia ruofei thought of the new building on the farm, so he took out his phone and called Liang Qichao. “Hey, RUO Fei! What’s the matter?” Liang Qichao asked in a low voice. Xia ruofei felt that Liang Qichao seemed to be a little unhappy, so he asked,””Brother Liang, what’s wrong? I feel like you’re a little unhappy!” “Oh ... It’s nothing,” Liang Qichao said,”Do you remember when I asked you to help me find the Phoebe zhennan wood? I haven’t found anything yet, but a few days ago, one of my father’s cousins found a piece of good wood. My cousin’s grandfather in the United States is quite satisfied with it, and he’s preparing to return to China soon ... Sigh!” It was no wonder that Liang Qichao was so depressed. It was conceivable that Liang Qichao’s relatives must have been trying their best to find the Phoebe zhennan material, all of them trying to gain points in front of the old man. They had searched for Liang Qichao’s house for so long and had spent a lot of energy and money, but they had returned without success. Now that someone else had gotten there before them, how could they not be depressed? However, Xia ruofei’s heart skipped a beat when he heard Liang Qichao’s words. He wasn’t in a hurry to talk about building a house, so he asked,””Brother Liang, what’s the size of the material that your relative found?”
