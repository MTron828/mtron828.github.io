2049 Drinking and chatting merrily (2)

“Holy sh * t, kun fish!” Song Rui still knew what was good.

He was the first to reach out with his chopsticks and pick up a piece of meat near the fish’s belly. There were also large pieces of fish skin and scales, and he attentively placed it in Zhuo Yiyi’s bowl.

“Yiyi, try it!” Song Rui said. This is a wild Chinese perch, and it’s very hard to eat now ... Right, don’t lose the scales! This is the most delicious part of the Chinese perch. It’s both nourishing and beautiful. ”

After being steamed, the fish scales of the Chinese perch had all softened and turned into jelly. The taste of bamboo shoots, mushrooms, and other auxiliary materials had also seeped into the fish scales, making it quite delicious.

“Can the fish scales be eaten?” Zhuo Yiyi looked at song Rui in disbelief.”You’re not teasing me on purpose, are you?”

Song Rui didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.”If this can’t be eaten, can you keep it, ruofei? You’ll know when you try it! A fish like this would cost a few thousand Yuan! You can’t usually eat it ...”

“So expensive?” Zhuo Yiyi couldn’t help but draw in a breath of cold air when she heard this.

Her monthly salary was only five to six thousand Yuan. Even if she didn’t eat or drink, it would only be enough to buy a fish like this?

When Zhuo Yiyi thought of this, she couldn’t help but think that ‘comparisons are odious’.

Xia ruofei laughed.”Yiyi, the scales of Chinese perch are edible. Su Shi, a great writer in the song Dynasty, once called Chinese perch ‘cherishing scale fish’!”

Zhuo Yiyi nodded and said,”yes!” I still believe in boss Xia’s words ...”

Song Rui almost hit the table with his head.”Why didn’t you believe me when I said it? Xia ruofei just said it casually and added Su Shi in it. Why did you believe it so easily?” Do you really think I have no credibility?

Xia ruofei held back his laughter and said,”everyone, don’t be so polite!” Hurry up and try it!”

After taking a bite, Zhuo Yiyi immediately said,””It’s too delicious!”

When song Rui saw this, he quickly grabbed another piece of beluga and placed it in Zhuo Yiyi’s bowl before Hou Liang. He said,””If you like it, eat more ...”

Zhuo Yiyi was a little embarrassed as she said,””Don’t give me any more food. We didn’t eat much!”

Pomfrets were generally not big, and the three of them added up to less than one or two catties. With so many people eating them together, if anyone ate more, there would definitely be people who couldn’t eat it.

“It’s okay, you can have my share!”Song Rui said casually.

“You’re my brother!” Zhuo Yiyi said.

Xia ruofei almost laughed out loud. Song Rui had tried so hard for so long, but he still couldn’t get rid of his brother’s identity!

After Zhao Yong Jun, Xu Zi Xuan and the rest tried it, they were naturally full of praise.

“Ruofei, after our paradise gathering opens, Ling Ji ‘s’ Buddha Jumps Over the Wall ‘and this steamed kun fish must be our signature dishes!” Zhao Yongjun said.

These two delicacies were extremely attractive even to Zhao Yongjun and the others, who had high standards.

Song Rui chimed in.”And the Drunken Eight Immortals we’re drinking today can’t be bought in the market. It’s best to get some of it too. We’ll divide the members into several levels. Only the highest level members can enjoy this kind of Drunken Eight Immortals wine!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”Hey! I didn’t expect Xiao Rui to have improved so much! You’re quite a business – minded person ...”

Song Rui said proudly,”I’m gifted, okay?” It’s just that I didn’t learn it seriously in the past!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”don’t worry!” Although the production of Drunken Eight Immortals was extremely low, it wasn’t a problem to supply a portion of it to the peach blossom Association! As for the ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’, even though the ingredients used were precious, they could be bought in the market. More than 10% of our peach blossom company’s monthly production of this Chang Jiang Chinese perch is supplied to the Ling Ji F & B group. When the time comes, the peach blossom Association’s restaurants will definitely have this signature dish!”

“That’s great!” Zhao Yongjun said happily,”with just these two dishes and the Eight Immortals drunk that Xiao Rui mentioned, I’m afraid we’ll be able to attract many more members!”

“And the other projects we’ve designed are definitely top – notch in the entire Beijing – Tianjin region!” Xu Zi Xuan smiled and said,”our club is still under construction. Recently, many friends have been asking me when we will open the membership application ...”

“Hahaha!” Xia ruofei raised his glass and said,”then everyone should have a drink for the success of the Paradise gathering!”

“Cheers!” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Cheers!”

Xia ruofei drank a glass of white wine and wiped his mouth with a small towel.””Speaking of which, I haven’t paid attention to our paradise gathering for a long time. How’s the construction going?”

Song Rui said unhappily,”you know that too!” Leave us brothers in the capital and we’ll work ourselves to death, while you go around the world to have fun! I heard from brother Zhao that you’re going to Italy?”

“Official business! Official business!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Xiao Rui, although RUO Fei didn’t manage the specific matters, the peach blossom Association’s project being able to get started smoothly is definitely due to his efforts.” Zhao Yongjun said,”we’re familiar with Beijing. It’s only right to do more!”

“I understand,” song Rui said.”But I’m so angry when I see this kid being free and unfettered all day ...”

Xia ruofei laughed bitterly,”Xiao Rui, you’re only eating meat when you see a thief, but you’re not getting beaten when you see a thief!” I’m not free and easy! Wasn’t he still extremely busy every day? Hundreds of people in the company are depending on me to make a living!”

“Brother Xia is definitely showing off!” Hou Liang said with a smile.

Zhao Yongjun couldn’t help but laugh,””Ruofei, the club’s construction is going very well, much faster than we expected. We expect it to be completed before the end of the year and start operations before the Spring Festival. There will definitely be no problem!”

“It’s much faster than I thought!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”thank you for your hard work!”

Zhao Yongjun laughed and said,”the construction company is quite good, and it can’t be done without Yiyi’s strong support!” She also participated in the entire design process, and many of the eye – catching designs were Yiyi’s ideas!”

Xia ruofei had also looked at the design plan, and the final draft was indeed stunning. He immediately smiled and said,””Then what are we waiting for? Let’s give a toast to consultant Zhuo!”

Xu Zi Xuan and the others immediately responded, and everyone filled their glasses.

Zhuo Yiyi was a little embarrassed as she said,””I don’t actually have a job, but you guys are paying me such a high salary ...”

Song Rui had asked Zhuo Yiyi to be his consultant because he wanted to give her some extra income to help with the family. Otherwise, with a salary of 5000 to 6000 Yuan in an institution, it would be hard for her to make ends meet in the capital.

This club was built by a group of good friends, so the brothers naturally didn’t mind giving them an extra salary.

However, no one had expected Zhuo Yiyi to be so serious and responsible. She was very involved in the project and even provided many constructive suggestions, which was of great help to the design and construction of the club.

“Labor is the most glorious thing. You’ve worked hard, and we’ll pay you. Isn’t that normal?” Xia ruofei said,”right, Xiao Rui?”

“Yes, yes, yes!” Song Rui quickly replied. Come, come, come, let’s all give a toast to Yiyi!”

Only then did Zhuo Yiyi clink her glass with everyone ‘s. Then, she very forthrightly downed a glass of half – llon white wine.

After putting down the glass, Zhao Yongjun smiled and said,””By the way, ruofei, the mushroom house that xiangnan TV is working on is almost complete. Director Gao seems to want to start filming before the end of the year. The new season of a life you yearn for will be broadcast around the Spring Festival at the latest. You have to be prepared to be on the show!”

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly,”you’re all waiting to see a joke!” President Feng is really too much, he’s simply pushing a duck onto a rack ...”

“I think that’s a good idea!” Xu Zixuan said,”not only did you promote our Paradise Club and your company, but you also increased your exposure. You’re now the living signboard of your company! Just your fans alone can increase the sales of your company by a lot!”

Xia ruofei rolled his eyes and said,”please, our company’s products have always been in short supply.” The only thing restricting our sales is our production capacity!”

“I’ll ... Find someone to show off ... We’re caught off guard!” Song Rui said,”brothers, Xia ruofei is so arrogant. Do you agree?”

“I don’t agree!” Xu Zi Xuan and the others jeered.

“Then what should we do?” Song Rui only wished for the world to be chaotic.

“Pour it on him!” Xu Zixuan and the others said in unison, even Zhao Yongjun laughed and joined in.

“I’ll come! I’m not afraid of you!” Xia ruofei said as he slammed the table.

Another round of competition at the wine table began ...
