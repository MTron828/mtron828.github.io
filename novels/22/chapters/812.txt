Xia ruofei laughed.”Mr. Lin, the most important thing in business is to keep your word. When have I ever broken my promise?”

“That’s right, that’s right!” President Lin said happily,”I can trust President Xia’s credibility!”

President Lin never dared to look down on this young man who was more than ten years younger than him. The Dendrobium candids alone had already added quite a dazzling performance to his business. The quality of the Dendrobium candids was so high that high – end consumers were flocking to it. Now, all the branches in the country were eagerly waiting for him to get a quota!

Besides, Xia ruofei had a way to get high – Quality wild ginseng, which was a treasure that was priceless.

Because of his performance during this period of time, there were many calls from the headquarters to promote him to the position of Deputy president of the company in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Province.

Therefore, President Lin could not wait to worship Xia ruofei.

“The new batch of iron – Skin kaedeos is already in production. They should be ready in two days!” Xia ruofei said.

“That’s great!” President Lin said happily,”President Xia, thank you!”

“You’re welcome. It’s a win – win situation ...” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

President Lin then said in a negotiating tone,””President Xia, but in terms of supply ... Can you increase it?”

Xia ruofei pretended to be surprised and said,”CEO Lin, I remember that we always supply the goods in full!” We’ll be able to supply more than 120 kilograms each time. This way, we’ll be able to supply far more than the agreed amount in a year. ” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“I know, I know ...” Mr. Lin said quickly.”It’s just that ... Your company’s sales of the iron dukedom are very high, and so many branches in the country are looking for us for goods. The supply is a little short of supply now!”

“CEO Lin,” Xia ruofei said awkwardly,”the current production capacity is basically the limit. It’s not easy to increase the supply ...”

In fact, there was always a surplus every time they supplied goods. For example, Xia ruofei kept some of the 140 kilograms of iron maple buckets. On one hand, he wanted to give them to his family and elders. On the other hand, he didn’t want to have no stock at all and hand them all over to Tongren Hall to sell. If that happened, he wouldn’t be able to build his own sales channel.

Now that Xia ruofei had the intention to develop his own e – commerce platform, he would naturally follow the agreement strictly in terms of supply. The extra iron maples would be left for his own e – commerce platform.

President Lin smiled apologetically.”I know that ... President Xia, please help. Give as much as you can!” I’ve been bugged by the branch managers “calls every day, and I can’t stand it ...”

Although President Lin was complaining when he said this, he was actually a little proud in his heart. He was only the manager of the Qiantang branch. When had he ever been so proud?

Xia ruofei smiled faintly.”Boss Lin, regarding the issue of the supply of iron – Skin fengdou, I’ve really done my best. I’m afraid it’ll be difficult to increase it in the short term. However ...”

Xia ruofei paused and said,””I have two good wild ginsengs on hand recently. I wonder if you’re interested, President Lin ...”

“Yes, yes, yes! I’m so interested!” President Lin quickly shouted,”President Xia! Brother Xia! You must, you must, you must save it for me! I ... I’ll book a plane ticket and come over now!”

President Lin didn’t even ask Xia ruofei about the quality of the wild ginseng and immediately asked to buy it. He was afraid that Xia ruofei would sell the wild ginseng to someone else if he was too late.

CEO Lin had already formed a fixed thought in his mind. The wild ginseng that Xia ruofei was selling was definitely of high quality. There was no need to hesitate.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”President Lin, don’t worry!” After the production of the iron – Skin maples is completed in two days, you can bring a few people here. After we’re done trading the wild ginseng, you can take the iron – Skin maples back as well, which will save our staff the trouble of making another trip. ”

“Hehe, President Xia, I’m just afraid that a long night will cause more trouble.” President Lin laughed dryly.”But since President Xia has spoken, I’ll come back after you’re done with the Ironhide Kaede bucket!”

“Alright, a week at most!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’ll let you know in advance when the time comes!”

“Alright, alright, it’s a deal!” Mr. Lin said, then carefully said,”Mr. Xia, you must keep the wild ginseng for Tongren Hall! We can discuss the price!”

“Don’t worry! I, Xia ruofei, have never gone back on my words!” Xia ruofei said.

After hanging up the phone, Xia ruofei sat in his office and smoked a cigarette. He realized that he had nothing to do.

Even though everyone in the company was busy, as long as Xia ruofei had the general direction and shared the specific work, he basically had nothing to do.

Feng Jing was still working overtime to come up with a proposal. Xia ruofei did not disturb her and left the office after a short rest.

At this time, it was time for the company to start working. Employees came from the dormitory to the complex for work one after another. When they saw Xia ruofei, they greeted him very respectfully. Xia ruofei also smiled and nodded at them frequently.

After going downstairs, Xia ruofei went to the production site of the iron – Skin maples. Seeing that Qin Xiaojun and the rest were working in an orderly manner and master Luo was watching over them, he returned to the small villa with a peace of mind.

The villa was quiet. Hu Zi’s mother and Lin Qiao had gone back to their rooms to rest.
