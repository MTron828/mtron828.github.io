Chapter 559: Iron – skinned Kaede fight (2)

After stir – frying, the coating on the surface of the Dendrobium had to be rubbed off. Then, the peeled iron – Skin Dendrobium was wrapped around an iron wire and repeatedly baked for five to eight times in a drying cage to further remove the water.

The temperature of the baking was also very important. The iron maple Dipper made by master Luo would not be burnt at all, and the final product would be a beautiful golden yellow.

The process seemed simple, but there was actually quite a lot of attention to it.

Xia ruofei looked at master Luo as he finished the first batch of maples. He took out a few curly golden grains from the bag and asked with a smile,””Master Luo, how’s the quality of these fengdou?”

Master Luo wiped the sweat from his forehead and said excitedly,””Boss Xia, I’ve been making Ironhide Kaede Doudou for most of my life, but this is the first time I’ve made such a high – Quality finished product! The raw materials you provided are really good, these iron maples are much better than the special products on the market!”

“That’s great! Master Luo, thank you for your hard work!”Xia ruofei said happily.

Master Luo smiled and said,”it’s not hard at all!” Boss Xia, you may not know this, but in this line of work, it’s a pleasure to be able to meet such good raw materials and personally process them into the best iron maple!” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Then, master Luo pointed at the tin Kaede bucket in the bag and said,””These iron maples are golden and shiny, so comfortable to look at! Boss Xia, there are now some illegal businesses that burn old newspapers to add color to the Maple buckets, but even so, the color of the Maple buckets can’t compare to ours! Look at how pure this color is! The taste is so natural!”

Xia ruofei could tell that master Luo was full of achievement, so he laughed and said,””Master Luo, I’ll leave this batch of iron – Skin Dendrobium to you. We’ll try to finish processing it as soon as possible!”

“Alright!” Master Luo grinned.

“Also, please teach our employees.” Xia ruofei said.

“Don’t worry, boss Xia! This isn’t a unique skill!” Master Luo chuckled and said,”as long as they’re willing to learn, I’ll teach them all my secret skills!”

Xia ruofei looked at the five employees who were learning from master Luo and said,””Did you guys hear that? You’ve all seen master Luo’s skills. Don’t waste the opportunity to have such a good teacher to guide you! In the future, I will only let you officially take up your posts after you pass master Luo’s test!”

“Yes, boss!”

“We’ll definitely study hard!”

The five of them quickly nodded in agreement. After they finished their studies, their treatment would be doubled. That would be better than many white – collar workers! Furthermore, once they mastered a skill, they would never go hungry. They naturally cherished this opportunity.

Xia ruofei encouraged master Luo with a few words and let them continue with their work. He did not stay behind to be a hindrance and went straight back to the villa.

After Xia ruofei returned to her room, she recalled the discussion she had with Ling Xiaotian about the online promotion of Drunken Eight Immortals. Since she had nothing else to do, she turned on her computer to see how Li Jing was doing.

Xia ruofei immediately opened the search engine and searched with ‘Drunken Eight Immortals’ as the keyword.

After checking, he realized that Li Jing’s efficiency was quite high. At least, he had already read seven or eight versions of the article at a glance. Some of them were even being discussed enthusiastically on major forums.

“The memories of youth of the three mountain men: the Drunken Eight Immortals wine in my eyes.”

“The newly packaged Drunken Eight Immortals creates a miracle and is sold out as soon as it hits the market.”

<<Drunken Eight Immortals, what’s so magical about them?>< The old liquor worm explains it to you ”

“Do you know how popular this liquor has been recently? I’ll tell you the five sets of data!”

“A price of conscience, the spirit of the craftsmen, the rebirth of the phoenix of a century – old brand”

Where can i buy the Eight Immortals drunk now? Urgently waiting online ”

“Jia Junpeng, your mother is calling you to the supermarket to buy Drunken Eight Immortals.”

……

Xia ruofei clicked on each article and browsed through them. He could not help but admire the creative ability of these fake reviewers. These articles did not leave obvious traces of advertising, and they hyped up the sales miracle of Drunken Eight Immortals from various angles.

Other than the article, Xia ruofei even found a whole set of emojis, such as “I’ll set a small goal first. After work, I’ll buy a box of Drunken Eight Immortals”,”mantis shrimp, let’s go buy Drunken Eight Immortals”,”I’ve failed to buy Drunken Eight Immortals three times. I suspect I went to a fake supermarket”...

Aside from the various mainstream forums, there were also many topics regarding Drunken Eight Immortals on Weibo. Although they had yet to make it to the hot search rankings, the number of views and discussions on them were steadily rising.

Of course, negative comments were inevitable.

People these days were no fools. Those who frequently surfed the internet still had basic judgment. As such, many people scoffed at drunken eight immortal and believed that this was a complete hype.

There were also quite a few voices looking at Drunken Eight Immortals.

In fact, there were even some people who, in order to expose the “low – Level hype” created by Drunken Eight Immortals, even thought of ways to queue up and personally buy the wine to “test the poison” with their own bodies. They even took a video of it.

The result was unsurprising. After this “anti – fraud Fighter” drank drunk Eight Immortals, he immediately became a fan and was not stingy with his praises.

Of course, this person had also been accused by many of the netizens of being the Internet Water Army hired by immortal drunken eight, and all kinds of ridicule were thrown at him.

In short, there were supporters, oppositions, and neutral factions. Everyone had their own opinions, and the argument was very lively.
