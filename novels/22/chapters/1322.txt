Lin Zhongming looked at Xia ruofei with a grateful and excited expression.

Xia ruofei was giving him a golden achievement! It was definitely a big gift!

Even if the purchase price was 780000 Yuan, with Tongren Hall’s powerful channels and a large number of high – end consumers, this batch of goods would still be profitable. Even if the peach blossom company earned the majority of the profits, the invisible boost to the brand’s popularity would still be invaluable.

Such an achievement was enough for Lin Zhongming to quickly gain a firm foothold in the East China region and establish his prestige. In the future, his Foundation would be even more solid.

Tang weiran had long noticed that Xia ruofei took care of Lin Zhongming. Even if they did not sign the contract under the name of East China District, he decided to promote Lin Zhongming at the appropriate time to show his goodwill to Xia ruofei.

Moreover, for a leader like Tang weiran, he didn’t need to compete with Lin Zhongming for this performance.

Therefore, he said without hesitation,”yes!” This is a job that comrade Zhongming personally came down to do!”

“Then there’s no problem!” Xia ruofei stood up and extended his hand to Tang weiran across the conference table. He smiled and said,”President Tang, I wish us a happy cooperation!”

“Happy cooperation!” Tang weiran stood up and shook hands with Xia ruofei.

He even felt that his palms were sweating. It was rare for a Department – Level state – owned enterprise leader to be so nervous in front of a young boss in his twenties.

“We’ve prepared some wine in the canteen. Please come with us, President Tang!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you can have a few more drinks tonight and then rest at our farm. The conditions are limited, I hope you don’t mind.”

Xia ruofei still gave the necessary respect to this Child of Fortune.

“No, no, no!” Tang Wei Ran quickly said,”we can’t ask for more! People like us who have been living in a forest of reinforced concrete all year round have a lot of yearning for such a rural life!”

“Then, President Tang, you can stay for a few more days!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’ll provide you with food and accommodation!”

Everyone burst into laughter. They had reached a consensus on the most important part, so everyone was more relaxed.

It was almost time to get off work in the evening, so Xia ruofei took Tang weiran and the others to the cafeteria directly.

Although Xia ruofei didn’t give any special instructions, Feng Jing had already arranged for the cafeteria to prepare dinner after confirming Tang weiran’s identity. When everyone arrived at the cafeteria, Taoyuan’s specialty dishes were served.

Tang weiran was naturally full of praise for the delicious Peach Garden vegetables and the mellow Drunken Eight Immortals liquor. Moreover, this was not a false boast. At least 80% to 90% of it came from the bottom of her heart. Even the leaders of the companies who were tested on alcohol could not remain calm when faced with the double taste of Peach Garden vegetables and Drunken Eight Immortals liquor.

Lin Zhongming was the most excited. He repeatedly toasted to Xia ruofei to express his gratitude. At the same time, he didn’t forget to toast to Tang weiran, the boss of his boss’s boss ‘boss.

Lin Zhongming wanted to leave a deep impression in the leader’s mind, and Tang weiran was also willing to treat Lin Zhongming differently to be on good terms with Xia ruofei. Therefore, his attitude was very kind and he even chatted with Lin Zhongming for a long time. Lin Zhongming couldn’t help but feel flattered and grateful to Xia ruofei.

The dinner was a happy one. Xia ruofei had solved the capital problem and didn’t need to use overseas funds. Tang weiran had completed the task that Wei Jianming had given her. Moreover, things were developing in the best direction of “turning bad things into good things”, so they were both in a good mood.

In comparison, some people in the capital were in a terrible mood.

When Chen Weinan finally got the news, it was already too late. His mood at that time was like the 39th day had suddenly fallen into an ice cave ...
