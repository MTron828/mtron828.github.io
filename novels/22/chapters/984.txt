Ling Qingxue, who was listening at the side, could not help but turn and look at Xia ruofei deeply. So it was really Secretary song who was treating this guy to a meal! I always thought he was just bragging ...

Xia ruofei also smiled.”Secretary song, it’s my fault. I wanted to see my girlfriend. That’s why I came early.”

“Your girlfriend?” Song Qiming raised his eyebrows and looked at Ling Qingxue, who was holding Xia ruofei’s arm.

“Dad, mom, you guys don’t know yet, do you?” Song Wei said with a smile. This shop is owned by RUO Fei’s girlfriend. ”

Song Wei then introduced Ling Xiaotian and Ling Qingxue to song Qiming.

Ling Xiaotian and Ling Qingxue did not dare to delay and quickly came forward to greet song Qiming.

Because of Xia ruofei, song Qiming’s attitude was very good. He took the initiative to shake hands with Ling Xiaotian and Xia ruofei and exchanged a few words.

“Dad, don’t just chat!” Song Wei said. There’s still serious business to attend to!”

Song Qiming was stunned and asked,”what’s the matter?” You kept me in suspense over the phone just now, you can finally tell me now!”

“Let’s go in first!”Song Wei said with a smile. Let’s talk while we walk ... Don’t go to the private room first, I’ll take you to the kitchen!”

“What’s there to see in the kitchen?” Song Qiming asked in confusion.

Song Wei gestured to Xia ruofei and said,””RUO Fei, why don’t you say it?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”let uncle Ling say it!” He understands the situation better. ”

Song Qiming also realized that something had happened. He could not help but frown and ask,””What happened?”

Ling Xiaotian knew that it was time for him to step forward, so he cleared his throat and said,””Secretary song, the situation is like this ...”

When Ling Xiaotian was reporting to song Qiming, everyone did not stop and headed straight to the restaurant’s kitchen.

……

In the kitchen.

Manager Lu’s face was ashen, and his heart had already sunk to the bottom.

He already had a stack of tickets in his hand. Some were from the safety supervision Department, the Environmental Protection Department, the urban management Department, and of course, most were from the health supervision Department.

These people were clearly here to find trouble, and they were just short of digging three feet deep. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Their inspection standards were so strict that it was outrageous. The restaurant was newly renovated, and today was only the first day of business, but they had already found a bunch of problems.

There was dust on the top of the box’s door frame, the fire extinguisher case’s lid could not open and close smoothly, the parking space was five millimeters narrower than the standard space, and there were water stains in the sink in the bathroom ...

There were more than a dozen of these so – called problems that would make people laugh if they were told about them. Every time they found a problem, they would issue a fine according to the upper limit. The fine in manager Lu’s hands was already in the tens of thousands.

These people were not looking for problems! It was even stricter than the standard of internal affairs inspection in the Army.

For example, when inspector Wu touched the top of the door frame with his new white gloves, a dark gray mark appeared on the white gloves, and he immediately classified it as a problem.

If all the restaurants were to meet this standard, not to mention the restaurants on the street, they would be punished to close down. Even the barracks of the Army would not be qualified.

Now, this group of people were picking bones from all kinds of eggs in the kitchen. Tian Mingyi also followed behind everyone proudly, and from time to time, he would cast a mocking look at manager Lu.

“There’s oil on this stove!” Inspector Wu was making a fuss.

Manager Lu’s heart sank, and he quickly walked over. At first glance, he was so angry that he almost fainted. There was a small drop of oil on the clean stove that was almost invisible to the naked eye. It was probably accidentally dropped on it by the chefs when they were preparing the dishes. It was obvious that it had been wiped, but not completely wiped clean.

In fact, it was only the first day of the opening of Ling Ji private kitchen. The entire kitchen was bright and clean. It could be said that it was much cleaner than the kitchen of most restaurants.

But no matter how clean it was, it couldn’t withstand someone picking bones from an egg!

“Director Wu, this ... This is just a small mark, I don’t think ...” Manager Lu tried to suppress his anger.

“Are you going to check or should I check?” Inspector Wu rebuked him,”do I still need you to teach me the standard of inspection?”

“I don’t dare ...” Manager Lu swallowed his anger and said.

Director Wu glanced at manager Lu and said,””The kitchen’s hygiene is not up to standard! You’ll be fined 5000 Yuan and suspended for half a month. After half a month, we can resume business after we review it. Otherwise, we’ll suspend the operation indefinitely!”

Manager Lu was shocked and couldn’t help but shout,””What? It will be closed for half a month?”

“You have an opinion?” Inspector Wu glanced at manager Lu and asked coldly.

“Inspector Wu, we’ll accept the fine, but closing for half a month is too much!” Manager Lu gritted his teeth and said,”you all know what happened today. Why do you have to be so ruthless?”

“Lu fengwen! What do you mean by that?” Inspector Wu shouted,”are you saying that I’m abusing my power to take revenge?”

Manager Lu thought to himself,”even a fool can see it. What’s the point of acting?”

Both sides had already shed all pretenses of cordiality, and manager Lu was not prepared to tolerate it any longer. He snorted coldly and said,””Isn’t it? Ask yourself, is there really a problem with our shop? And look at these tickets in my hand!”
