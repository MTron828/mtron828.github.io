Chapter 1914 Godly prediction (1)

At that moment, Liu Dong’s head buzzed as if it had been hit by a heavy hammer.

In the photo in front of him, there were two naked people. The man’s back was facing the camera, so he couldn’t see his face, while the woman was facing the camera. The two were kissing passionately, and half of the woman’s face was blocked.

However, Liu Dong recognized the woman immediately. She was his first wife, Fang Chenchen.

Liu Dong could not believe what he was seeing.

When he was with Fang Chenchen, he would go along with her in everything. In his opinion, his love for Fang Chenchen had reached the limit. Even though Fang Chenchen often complained about him, even calling him a good – for – nothing and a good – for – nothing, he had never doubted the feelings between husband and wife, and he had never thought that Fang Chenchen would betray him.

“It must be fake ...” Liu Dong mumbled to himself.”This photo must be fake!” It’s ... It’s photoshopped ...”

Then, he suddenly came to his senses and opened the multimedia message with trembling hands. He found the number that sent the text message and dialed it.

“I’d like to see who’s so vicious to intentionally drive a wedge between us!” Liu Dong’s lips trembled as he muttered to himself,”answer it! Why don’t you pick up the phone ...”

The other party seemed to be trying to make Liu Dong anxious. Other than the cold ringing sound, there was no other sound.

Just when Liu Dong thought that the other party would not pick up the phone, the call suddenly connected.

“Hey! Who are you?” “Why did you send me such a fake photo?” Liu Dong asked in a hurry.

The person on the other end of the phone was silent for a moment, then asked calmly,””Mr. Liu, do you really think this is a fake photo?”

Liu Dong was taken aback. He had been trying to convince himself that this was a photoshopped photo. It made sense if he said so. After all, Fang Chenchen was a public figure, and her photo could be easily found on the internet. It was not difficult to use a software to connect her head to such a photo.

However, there was a voice in Liu Dong’s subconsciousness that kept reminding him that the photo was not fake! The moment he saw the photo, he had a strong feeling.

Liu Dong’s eyes flickered, but he forced himself to say,””Nonsense! I understand my wife, she’s not that kind of person! Speak! What is your purpose? Why did you intentionally come to ruin our relationship?”

The person on the other end of the phone chuckled and said,””Mr. Liu, if that’s the case, then we have nothing more to say. You can continue to live in your dream! How did the saying go again? you can never wake up a person who is pretending to be asleep! Mr. Liu, good luck! Goodbye ...”

“Wait!” “Tell me, where did you get this photo?” Liu Dong asked.

The person on the other end of the phone said indifferently,””If you want to know more, add my WeChat! This is the number ...”

After that, the man hung up the phone. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Liu Dong was a little flustered. He knew that the person would not send him such a photo for no reason. There must be a purpose, so he thought that the person would continue to disclose more information and finally reveal the purpose.

Unexpectedly, this person didn’t play by the rules at all. He lightly said to add her on WeChat and then hung up the phone.

Liu Dong frantically dialed the number again, but it was rejected after only one Ring. He didn’t give up. He called several times in a row, but without exception, he was hung up firmly. Sometimes, the phone was hung up before it even rang.

Liu Dong knew that the other party had probably blacklisted his number.

Add me on WeChat? Wouldn’t it be more convenient to talk over the phone? Why did he add her on WeChat? Liu Dong did not understand, but he had almost lost his ability to think. He had no choice but to open the WeChat app and add her as a friend through his phone number.

Liu Dong’s hands were shaking so badly that he had entered the short string of numbers wrong four times. Finally, he entered the correct number and pressed the search button. A WeChat account with the nickname ‘justice is not absent’ was displayed. The picture of the head portrait was a half – drawn sword, and the personal signature was ‘I’ll help you when you see injustice on the road!’

Liu Dong could not help but smile self – deprecatingly as he chose to add her as a friend.

This time, the other party responded very quickly, and the friend request was accepted a few seconds later.

Before Liu Dong could ask, justice is not absent sent him three pictures and wrote,””You decide for yourself whether it’s photoshopped! Come find me after you’ve thought it through. ”

Liu Dong’s hands trembled as he looked at the picture on his phone. His eyes were bloodshot, and he looked like a man – eating beast.

The main characters in all three photos were Fang Chenchen and the man. One thing was the same, the “male lead” did not show his face, while Fang Chenchen’s face was exposed in all three photos.

Liu Dong did not need a professional agency to verify that the photos were not photoshopped.

He was an amateur photographer, so he was quite familiar with Photoshop software. With one look, he knew that Photoshop couldn’t have perfectly blended the people in the photos with the surrounding light. The lighting of the head and body was also very natural. The other party seemed to have deliberately chosen a few photos like this. There was a chandelier above the two people in the photos, and the light cast a complex shadow on the two people. It was impossible to synthesize such a flawless photo under such circumstances.
