After the players had calmed down a little, Xia ruofei clapped his hands and said loudly,””Guys! Calm down! Since everyone is here today, I have a few things to announce!”

The RCD Espanyol players quieted down. Everyone looked at Xia ruofei with a hint of anticipation in their eyes. Some even thought that since the team was in a good position to compete for the European tournament, would Xia ruofei simply stay and finish the remaining three rounds? If that was the case, then it could really be said that he could rest easy.

After all, the opponents in the last three rounds of the Espanyol were not particularly strong. Even without Xia ruofei, they still had to strive to win these three matches, and the hope was not small. If Xia ruofei could represent the team, it was no exaggeration to say that the combat power of the entire Espanyol would be improved by a large margin. There was no doubt that they would win the next three rounds.

Obviously, the players were overthinking it. Xia ruofei could not possibly stay in Spain for the next three weeks.

He looked around and said with a smile,””The first thing is that I have just discussed with general manager Zhou. We have won a hearty big victory today, and Sevilla has also lost an unexpected defeat. We have finally rushed to the seventh place position, which is something to be happy about. So, we have decided that the winning bonus for today’s game will be increased by 20%. Remember to check your bills after you have received it!”

“Long live!”

“Long live the boss!”

“The shop owner is so handsome!”

Some of the players even whistled, and the locker room was filled with cheers. In fact, a 20% increase in the goal bonus was not a lot of money for professional players with a high income. However, everyone was in a good mood today. When Xia ruofei announced the good news, they all cheered.

Xia ruofei smiled and pointed at the loudest young player, Pedro, and said,””I like your useless looks!”

The players in the locker room burst into laughter. Xia ruofei waited for everyone to quiet down before he continued,””The second thing is that if the club can enter the European region this season, even if it’s just a spot for the qualification round, the club will provide a sum of money as a special bonus for everyone. The exact amount will be kept a secret for now, but it will definitely surprise everyone!”

This time, the cheers from the players were even louder. This time, everyone was really happy from the bottom of their hearts because everyone knew that since Xia ruofei had specifically mentioned this matter, once they really achieved their goal of returning to the European arena at the end of the season, the club would definitely give out a considerable amount of bonus.

Xia ruofei finally said,”there’s one more thing. I’ll treat the entire team to a big meal tonight!” I’ve already asked director Zhou to send someone to pick the place. It’s definitely the highest – Standard restaurant in Barcelona! Everyone had to attend, and no one was allowed to be absent! In addition ... Family members are allowed!”

“Boss, how many can I bring?” Markelka asked with a smile.

“How many wives do you have?” Xia ruofei immediately asked.

The players burst into laughter. One by one, they touched mark Rocca’s head and asked him how many girlfriends he had.

Markelka scratched his head in embarrassment and laughed. Xia ruofei had obviously misunderstood him on purpose, but it made the atmosphere in the changing room even more cheerful.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”there’s no limit to the number of people. You can bring your girlfriend, wife, and children. It’s a family gathering!”

“Understood!”

“The shop owner is generous!”

“Thank you, boss!” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

……

The Spanish team’s game kicked off very early today. Even though they had watched half the game in the locker room after the game, it was not even FiveO’ clock yet, so the players went home to change their clothes and brought their families to meet. The time was just right.

Everyone talked and laughed as they walked out of the locker room. The players had to take the team’s bus back to Dani Halk base. Everyone’s car was parked at the training base and then they took the bus together.

Xia ruofei and Wu Lei walked out side by side. He said,””Lei, when you go back, bring your wife and children with you. This is also a rare opportunity to interact with your teammates. If you want to play on a team for a long time, it is impossible to do so without the support of your teammates, so you have to learn to integrate into the team.”

Wu Lei was a humble person, and his training and game attitude were very positive. He could be said to be a player full of positive energy. However, he was a little shy, and he had not learned Spanish well, so he usually communicated with his teammates less.

“I understand. Thank you for your reminder, brother Xia!” Wu Lei nodded and said.

Xia ruofei did not leave with the team’s bus. Instead, he took Zhou leiyun’s car back to the hotel.

Although it was said that Xia ruofei was treating, Zhou leiyun’s assistant was actually the one handling everything, including deciding on the restaurant and informing the players and coaches.

Xia ruofei and Zhou leiyun chatted for a while in the hotel. When it was past six in the evening, they took Zhou leiyun’s luxury business car to the restaurant with Song Wei and Ling Qingxue.

Although the season was not over yet and there was still the league next week, Spain had won six points in these two rounds. One was to snatch food from the Tiger’s mouth from Barcelona, and the other was an eight – goal victory. The team was filled with a joyous atmosphere and morale was very high, so it was just right to call everyone together for a meal.
