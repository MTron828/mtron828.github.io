1962 Cruel delicacies (1)

Old Blake nodded without hesitation,”No problem! I’ll be able to transfer the money to your company’s account today ... Or any account you’d like, Mr. Xia. ”

Old Blake was thinking about the two million dollars “emotional damage compensation” he had paid Xia ruofei the last time he made peace with him. Xia ruofei had asked him to transfer the money to an offshore company account.

He also knew that the procedures for sending funds out to sea in China were somewhat cumbersome, and many rich people liked to set up overseas accounts.

A deposit of one million euros was not very high. Even though the market price of ordinary black truffles was around a few thousand euros per kilogram, and 50 kilograms was definitely less than a million euros, that was the price of ordinary truffles, and black truffles.

The truffles that Xia ruofei provided definitely had both black and white truffles. Furthermore, Xia ruofei’s truffles were not only big in size, but their overall quality was also higher than the truffles on the market by more than one grade. Naturally, the price could not be estimated according to the average market price.

This was also the reason why so many traditional truffle suppliers and Michelin star restaurants were so eager to attend this auction.

Otherwise, with the black family’s annual sales of a few tons, how could the patriarch personally come to negotiate for a mere 50 kilograms of truffle?

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”it’s the same account as last time. Also ... Mr. Blake, I won’t sign any agreement with you. You need to trust me.”

Old Blake was stunned for a moment and then said with a bitter smile,””Xia ... You’re really ... Alright! It doesn’t matter if you don’t have an agreement, I believe in your credibility!”

Xia ruofei smiled noncommittally and said,””If there are no objections, then I wish us a happy cooperation!”

Xia ruofei’s actions seemed a little overbearing, but the reason was simple. He had no intention of using the company’s name to do business with the black family. Moreover, he did not have the company’s official seal! As for signing the agreement in his own name, Xia ruofei felt that it was meaningless. Anyway, as long as the black family followed the agreement, he could not break the agreement.

If old Blake didn’t accept it, it didn’t matter if the business didn’t work.

Xia ruofei was so domineering because he didn’t care. He didn’t have any concerns because he didn’t want anything.

Old Blake smiled and said,””Happy cooperation!”

Xia ruofei stood up and poured two glasses of red wine. He clinked his glass with old Blake’s and asked,””By the way, how’s your George doing?”

Old Blake was embarrassed.

Last time, George Blake was completely humiliated by Xia ruofei. In order to maintain their working relationship, old Blake even stripped him of his position as the successor. To the Blake family, this was not something to be proud of.

Old Blake said,”I’ve removed him from all his positions in the family company, and he has been stripped of his identity as the heir. However, as a member of the family, he still has the most basic guarantee every month. But don’t worry, Mr. Xia. The monthly salary is not enough for him to continue his previous life of debauchery.”

Xia ruofei nodded lightly. Old Blake had done a good job. After all, George Blake was a direct descendant of their family. Blood ties could not be severed. They could not possibly ask him to kick George Blake out of the family.

Xia ruofei was not worried that old Blake would lie or brush him off because it was easy to find out. Unless the Blake family valued George Blake very much and made him pretend to be in a bad state while secretly training him.

With George Blake’s idiotic performance, the possibility of this happening was infinitely close to zero.

After casually asking about George Blake, Xia ruofei started chatting with old Blake. After all, he was a guest. Since he did not take the initiative to say goodbye, he could not ask him to leave directly. After all, they had just closed a business deal!

Old Blake also wanted to get closer to Xia ruofei, so he praised the truffles produced by the Paradise Corporation. Of course, he also wanted to find out the origin of the truffles.

After all, there were only a few famous truffle – producing areas in the world. Basically, the truffle business in the world was monopolized by the traditional truffle families. Xia ruofei’s paradise Corporation had appeared out of nowhere and snatched a piece of the market share with their almost perfect products.

Of course, Xia ruofei was taking the high – end route. He did not dump truffles to make the price of truffles drop. It would not cause too much of an impact on the sales of dozens of tons of truffles around the world every year. Therefore, old Blake was more curious.

Xia ruofei naturally changed the topic, and old Blake stopped asking.

As the two of them chatted, they started talking about high – end ingredients. Xia ruofei had nothing else to talk about. Two grown men couldn’t just stare at each other! Besides, this was their old profession.

“Mr. Xia,” old Blake asked,”I wonder if your company has any involvement in other high – end Western food ingredients other than truffles?”

“What high – end ingredients do you mean, Mr. Blake?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

“Foie gras, truffle, and caviar have always been known as the world’s top three delicacies,” old Blake said. Your company’s truffle is definitely the best!”

Old Blake gave a thumbs up and continued,”I wonder if your company has foie gras and caviar in this area? If there is, I’m quite looking forward to it!”

“Does the black family have any other food ingredient business?” Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows and asked.

Old Blake smiled and said,”Our family started out by selling truffles, and after several generations of hard work, we’ve reached our current scale. Truffles are, of course, our most important business, but as the company grows, our business will naturally expand as well. We’re basically involved in all high – end ingredients, but of course, we’re mainly using agent sales. ”

Xia ruofei’s interest was piqued. He leaned back on the sofa and took a sip of his wine. Then, he asked,””Mr. Blake, if you don’t mind, can you introduce foie gras and caviar to me? Our company is also preparing to expand our business scope. ”

Xia ruofei did not lie. In fact, he had heard of the three most precious delicacies in the world, but he did not know much about them. However, at least he knew that whether it was foie gras, caviar, or the truffle business that peach blossom company was already operating, the profits were huge.

Making money was one thing, but Xia ruofei also paid special attention to the richness of the company’s product line and the company’s reputation.

As the three most famous ingredients in the Western food industry, paradise Corporation definitely couldn’t avoid them if they wanted to take the route of high – end ingredients. Since the black family had business in this area, he could take the opportunity to understand the situation.

As soon as old Blake heard that, he knew that paradise Corporation didn’t have foie gras and caviar at the moment, and he couldn’t help but feel a little disappointed.

However, he quickly adjusted himself and said enthusiastically,””Of course not! Xia, I’ll tell you about foie gras. The foie gras here referred to the French foie gras, which had been eaten in France for thousands of years. In those days, even Caesar the great praised this dish. It was also said to be rich in nutritional value, so it was a must – have menu in high – end Western restaurants. But ...”

Then, old Blake changed the topic and said,””This dish is also known as the cruelest delicacy in the world!”

Hearing this, Xia ruofei was very curious. He couldn’t help but ask,””The cruelest? Why do you say that?”

“This is related to the method of obtaining foie gras.” Old Blake said,”the French foie gras that we talk about is different from ordinary foie gras. In fact, this is the liver collected from a goose that has fatty liver. It usually weighs more than 700 grams, which is dozens of times more than ordinary foie gras. Why would a goose get a fatty liver? It’s the result of human intervention ...”

Old Blake’s tone was a little low, which made Xia ruofei feel like he was listening to a Midnight Ghost story. He could not help but feel a chill in his heart.

Old Blake continued,”the young geese were brought to the farm after they were born. In the first 12 weeks, they were squeezed into small cages. Only rows of necks were exposed outside the iron bars. They were fixed on the rack that was dedicated to training neck muscles. The farm owner increased the amount of food he was fed every day, trying his best to make the goose’s stomach as full as a dough bag. The real torture would only begin when the goose’s neck muscles and stomach were as strong as steel ...

The farm owner would stuff a 30 – centimeter – long tube directly into the goose’s stomach multiple times a day, and then feed it at least 12 kilograms of food every day! As a result, the size of the liver was abnormally large due to overwork. Such torture would take 18 days to’ create ‘a fatty liver that was ten or even dozens of times larger than normal goose liver! In order to prevent the geese from digesting because of exercise, besides being confined to a very small space, the farm owners also deliberately reduced calcium in their food recipes. So, these fat geese basically have osteodystrophy and can only lie lazily on the ground every day until they die!”

Hearing this, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel a chill run down his spine. He immediately inserted the tube into his stomach and pressed the food inside. This was several times more painful than a gastroscopy! These geese had to undergo the “enhanced version of gastroscopy” many times a day. Then, their stomachs would be severely bloated at any time and any place. Moreover, they had very little space to move around. This was simply a hellish torture! It was scary just thinking about it!

“How could there be such an evil method?” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but sigh.

Old Blake shrugged his shoulders and said,”it’s all for profit!” The profit margin of French foie gras is very large, so everyone is eager for it. Even if there are protests from animal protection organizations every year, the effect is not obvious. ”

Xia ruofei nodded silently. He realized that he no longer had any interest in the dish of French foie gras, and he was afraid that paradise Corporation would never operate the foie gras business again.

However, at this moment, Xia ruofei’s heart moved slightly. A strange idea suddenly emerged in his mind ...Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎
