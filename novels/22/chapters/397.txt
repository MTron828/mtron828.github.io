Chapter 398: County Head Wu’s inspection (1)

Wu Liqian pursed her lips and smiled.”I’m not here to inspect and give guidance. I’m here to eat and take my card. I want an evil guest!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh. “I’d welcome you to eat and take cards! It was rare for big sis Wu to visit! If it wasn’t for the jaded skin cream, I don’t know when you’d remember this little farm of mine!”

Wu Liqian couldn’t help but blush. She wasn’t embarrassed that Xia ruofei had hit the nail on the head. In fact, she had wanted to visit Xia ruofei’s farm for a long time. However, she had been busy opening up a new job in Changping County and had been physically and mentally exhausted. She had not been able to free herself.

Xia ruofei was just joking. When he saw that Wu Liqian didn’t say anything, he immediately smiled and changed the topic.”Sis Wu, since you’re here, let me show you around the farm!” He said.

“Alright!” Wu Liqian said immediately.

Thus, the two of them walked out of the villa together.

Xia ruofei and Wu Liqian walked side by side on the path in the farm. The sun shone on them and they felt warm.

The air in the farm was very fresh, and the greenery was very well done. Sometimes, she could even see the coastline in the distance. Wu Liqian felt very relaxed. She had not been in this state for a long time.

After coming to work in Changping County, it was as if she had entered a Whirlpool of undercurrents. For a weak woman to fight for a position in the dangerous officialdom, one could imagine the hardships.

It could be said that Wu Liqian’s nerves had always been in a very tense state. Today, she had come to the farm for the jaded skin ointment, but she had unexpectedly been able to relax both physically and mentally.

Wu Liqian felt very comfortable in this state.

Xia ruofei walked beside Wu Liqian and introduced the farm to her. The two of them were very close to each other. Occasionally, their shoulders would touch. However, they were very natural and did not feel uncomfortable.

Wu Liqian felt that Xia ruofei had a very clean, fresh, and sunny aura. Walking beside Xia ruofei made her heart feel much calmer.

“Sis Wu, our vegetable greenhouse is just up ahead.” With a warm smile on his face, Xia ruofei said,”currently, our main business is here. Every day, we will continuously export paradise brand vegetables.”

“Oh, really? Then I’ll have to take a good look!” Wu Liqian smiled sweetly and said,”Taoyuan vegetables ‘name is well – known in Sanshan city! But it’s too expensive, I can’t even bear to eat it a few times a month!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”of course, good things are expensive!” But if sis Wu wants to eat Taoyuan vegetables, you don’t have to go to the store. Just give me a call and I’ll get someone to send it to you. There’ll definitely be enough!”

“That won’t do! A catty of your vegetables should be worth at least tens of Yuan!” Wu Liqian said,”how can I just ask you for it?”

“Even if it’s a few hundred or a few thousand Yuan per 500 grams, sis Wu can eat as much as she wants!” Xia ruofei said straightforwardly,”if it wasn’t for sis Wu’s help, I wouldn’t have been able to rent such a good place and buy such a suitable villa!”

“This isn’t my credit. I’m just responsible for setting up the bridge.” Wu Liqian smiled and said,”you spent real money on the villa, and the land here is barren. If you rent it, the village would be dying to have it!” Not only did it bring benefits to the village, but it also solved a lot of employment problems! From this point of view, I have to thank you!”

“After becoming a parent official, his awareness is really different!” Xia ruofei laughed.

“Are you looking for a beating?” Wu Liqian couldn’t help but glare at Xia ruofei and said coyly.

He had to admit that Wu Liqian had taken good care of herself. Her beautiful face revealed a little girlish look. She did not have the demeanor of a successful woman in politics at all. However, she had a different kind of charm. Xia ruofei could not help but be dazed.

Wu Liqian blushed slightly, but she was not upset by Xia ruofei’s momentary daze. In fact, Xia ruofei’s eyes were clear and clean, full of pure admiration, without a trace of evil thoughts. Wu Liqian could feel this.

Wu Liqian’s heartstrings trembled slightly. Her heart had long been frozen, but at this moment, a crack seemed to appear in the layers of ice.

Wu Liqian walked a few steps forward unnaturally and said,””Xiao Xia, quickly bring me in to take a look!”

The slight awkwardness was resolved just like that.

Xia ruofei pushed open the door of the greenhouse and led Wu Liqian in.

It just so happened that Cao tieshu was working in the greenhouse with his workers. The price of these vegetables was so high, and Cao tieshu and the others also knew how precious they were. Thus, they took care of them meticulously. The work that could normally be done in two or three steps in their own fields became very careful and meticulous here.

Seeing Xia ruofei enter, Cao tieshu quickly stood up and greeted him.

Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand to let them continue with their work. He did not introduce Wu Liqian to Cao tieshu and the others. After all, this was Wu Liqian’s first personal visit.

However, someone quickly recognized Wu Liqian. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m
