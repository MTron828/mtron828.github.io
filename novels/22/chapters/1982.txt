1983 Cleaning up inventory (3)

Bastian asked hesitantly,””Mr. Xia, we’ll buy all the truffles from corner restaurant. The price ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”tell me what price you can offer.” If it’s suitable, I’ll sell it to you!”

To be honest, Xia ruofei was doing Cheng Xiaoxiao a favor. He didn’t really care if he sold more or less for this batch of truffles.

He didn’t like to eat truffles anyway, and it would be a waste to keep them in the space. Even if he gave them away, he wouldn’t need so much.

Before Bastian came, he had confirmed his authority with the headquarters. This time, if the unit price of the black truffle was below 5000 euros and the White truffle was below 10000 euros, he could directly make the decision. This was already a standard set in accordance with the high – end truffles on the market.

But now, it seemed that the price was too low. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Bastian was a little hesitant. The highest price he had set before was obviously not going to be used. Otherwise, if he said it out loud, it would be an insult to these top – grade truffles! It would be strange if Xia ruofei was not angry!

In fact, he was overthinking. Xia ruofei would at most feel that the price was a little low and would not really be angry. After all, Xia ruofei did not care much about the truffle that Bastian regarded as a treasure.

But Bastian did not think so! He felt that he had to increase the price, and the increase in price could not be too low. However, he did not have the authority to do so! It did not seem to be a good time to go to the company’s headquarters now. What if Xia ruofei was impatient?

Xia ruofei was still smiling as he waited for Bastian’s reply. Bastian could not hesitate for too long. He quickly thought of something and made up his mind. He decided to put everything else aside! Let’s bid first! It would be a crime to miss such a top – grade truffle! He believed that after the company headquarters saw this batch of truffles, they would not doubt his decision.

Thinking of this, Bastian gritted his teeth and said,””Mr. Xia, do you think ... The black truffle is 8000 euros per kilogram and the White truffle is 20000 euros per kilogram is appropriate?

Xia ruofei didn’t think much about it. He smiled and said,”Sure, let’s trade at this price! Mr. Bastian, you can have someone draw up the agreement!”

“We are all ready! I just need to change a few key numbers!” Bastian hurriedly said.

Cheng Xiaoxiao immediately took out her laptop, opened the document she had prepared, and wrote down the price they had agreed on.

Bastian then took out a precise scale from the box he carried with him and re – weighed the truffles. He wrote them into the agreement and calculated a total transaction amount of 418600 euros.

“Mr. Xia, what do you think ...” Bastian handed the printed agreement to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei glanced at it and signed his name.

Bastian also quickly signed the agreement on behalf of the company, and then said,””Mr. Xia, please wait for a moment. I’ll immediately inform the company to transfer the money to your designated account!”

Then, he said to Cheng Xiaoxiao,””Cheng, you talk to Mr. Xia for a while. I’ll call the head office!”

“Yes, Mr. Bastian!” Cheng Xiaoxiao said.

Bastian nodded at Xia ruofei, then took his phone and went to the room next door.

Not only did he have to inform the company headquarters to make the payment, but most importantly, he also had to convince the headquarters to accept his new offer and the transaction amount as soon as possible.

Bastian called the sales Director uneasily and briefly explained the situation here. He was about to emphasize the unique quality of this batch of truffles, hoping to persuade the sales Director as much as possible, but the sales Director said without much hesitation,”No problem! We’ll trade according to your price. Bastian, immediately fax a copy of the agreement back to the head office. I’ll arrange for the finance staff to transfer the money immediately!”
