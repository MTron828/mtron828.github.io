Xia ruofei laughed and said,”of course, no problem!” Didn’t I tell you? My Qingxue is so smart, how could she not be suitable for cultivation!”

Ling Qingxue immediately said happily,””Really? That’s great, you almost scared me to death just now. As long as I think of me becoming an old woman and you still looking like a young man, I ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”isn’t that good?” Everyone will be envious of you! An old cow eating young grass!”

Ling Qingxue playfully hit Xia ruofei a few times and said,””A dog’s mouth can’t spit out ivory! You only know how to talk nonsense ...”

Xia ruofei laughed,”wife!” Let’s return! The wind by the sea is quite strong, don’t catch a cold ...”

“Then when will you teach me how to cultivate?” Ling Qingxue asked, full of anticipation.

Xia ruofei had opened a door for her, a door to a whole new world. Ling Qingxue couldn’t wait to see him.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”don’t worry!” I’ll have to find the most suitable cultivation technique for your attribute according to your body’s condition! After I’m done tidying up, I’ll have to help you recuperate a little before I can start cultivating! This is called sharpening a knife will not delay the work of cutting wood!”

“Alright then! You have to be quick!” Ling Qingxue didn’t doubt him and nodded happily.

“Don’t worry!” Xia ruofei said and then reminded her,”by the way, Qingxue, you must keep your cultivation a secret! This thing is quite sensitive, and it will cause a lot of unnecessary trouble if it gets out. ”

Ling Qingxue giggled and said,”I know!” I won’t tell anyone! And ... Even if I tell others, no one will believe me!”

“That’s true ...” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”just keep it a secret!” It’s best if you don’t even tell uncle Ling. ”

Ling Qingxue nodded. She hesitated for a moment before asking,””Ruofei, then ... My dad ... Can he cultivate?”

Xia ruofei did not hesitate and said,””Uncle Ling is already too old and has missed the best time to cultivate. In fact, our age is no longer the best age to cultivate. It’s just that we can still cultivate with some auxiliary means.” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Ling Qingxue’s disappointment was evident in her words. She said,””Oh ... I know!”

Xia ruofei smiled and patted Ling Qingxue’s head.””Although uncle Ling can’t cultivate, as long as we cultivate well, it’s still very easy to provide him with some longevity – extending spiritual medicine. Not to mention other things, it’s definitely not a problem to live to a hundred years old!”

“Really?”

“When have I ever lied to you? Don’t you worry!” Xia ruofei laughed.”Isn’t your father my father too?”

Ling Qingxue blushed and said,”no way!” Don’t think too highly of yourself!”

“Eh? My wife has grown up!” Xia ruofei laughed.”You’re forcing me to use the Family Law!”

When Ling Qingxue heard the word ‘family punishment’, her face turned even redder. She could not help but roll her eyes at Xia ruofei and said,””Let’s go! Aren’t you going back to the city for lunch? If you dawdle any longer, you’ll miss the meal time!”

“Hahaha! Let’s go, let’s go!” Xia ruofei said,”it’s your treat today!”

The two of them left the beach and walked together to the parking lot.

Ling Qingxue didn’t notice that Xia ruofei’s eyes were clouded.

The actual situation was not as optimistic as Xia ruofei had made it out to be. There were so many people in the world, but only a few were suitable for cultivation. Ling Qingxue’s physique happened to belong to the general public. Even if she forced herself to cultivate, it would be difficult to achieve much. It would even be difficult to get started.

Xia ruofei had made up his mind to bring Ling Qingxue on the path of cultivation not just to explain his relationship with Song Wei. The scene that he had just described to Ling Qingxue had actually appeared in his mind many times. He also found it hard to accept the fact that Ling Qingxue would leave this world so early one day ...

If Ling Qingxue couldn’t cultivate, Xia ruofei would only be able to extend her lifespan to a hundred years old at most. With Xia ruofei’s current cultivation, it would be easy for him to live to a hundred and fifty years old. As his cultivation level increased, his lifespan would also increase. If he could successfully build his Foundation, his lifespan would be at least three hundred years.

Xia ruofei was very confident that he could reach the foundation establishment stage.

Could it be that when he was over a hundred years old, he would have to watch Ling Qingxue leave the world with regret and reluctance, and then live alone for another one or two hundred years?

No! He would not allow such a situation to happen! Xia ruofei roared in his heart.

Of course, he didn’t show these emotions on his face, and Ling Qingxue had been in a state of extreme joy the whole time, so she naturally didn’t notice anything.

The two of them returned to the city and had a happy lunch. Of course, Ling Qingxue’s happiness came from the bottom of her heart, while Xia ruofei was more or less forcing a smile.

After the meal, Xia ruofei did not ask Ling Qingxue to send him back, as she had work to do in the afternoon. He called a taxi and went back to the farm.

Xia ruofei’s departure this time would take about a month. When they heard that he was back, Feng Jing and the other higher – ups were waiting to report to him about the work at this stage. However, Xia ruofei directly sent a message to the higher – ups ‘WeChat group, saying that he was tired from the journey and needed to rest. If there was anything else, he would talk about it tomorrow.
