2981 It’s the same_

Xia ruofei took out a “handwritten copy”. It was a stack of ordinary A4 papers bound together with ordinary nails. It seemed that the binding was done in a hurry, so the pages were not even aligned ...

The first thing that caught his eye on the cover was the words “the glittering jewel Wonderland” in a vertical row. There were also three small words on the lower right corner: The second volume.

The handwriting looked very ethereal, as if it had a trace of immortal Qi. It looked quite comfortable, but it was obvious that it was written with a gel pen.

Compared to Xia ruofei’s simple manuscript, Luo Feng’s manuscript was much more sophisticated.

The paper used first should have been specially processed. The slightly yellow paper was very tough and looked antique.

Moreover, this manuscript was very exquisitely thread – bound, and the words on the cover were also written with a brush. It was a very nice regular script, as if it had been printed.

When Luo Feng and Wu Ming saw the “handwritten copy” that Xia ruofei took out, they were even more certain of their guess that Yingluo had definitely made this manuscript at the last minute. The crude and crude air that came from it was simply unbearable to look at.

Wu Ming sneered,”the star Seizer sect’s hand – written manuscripts are truly unique!” This thing is worth more than 70000 spirit stones? I’ve really opened my eyes ...” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Xia ruofei replied indifferently,”knowledge is priceless!” Only superficial people will pay attention to their appearance. ”

Liu Mansha couldn’t help but burst out laughing when she heard this. She said,”Fellow Daoist Xia’s words make sense. As long as the content of the cultivation method is good, I don’t pay much attention to the form ...”

Wu Ming could not help but feel depressed when he heard this. He had wanted to take the opportunity to mock Xia ruofei, but he did not expect to be retorted by Xia ruofei instead.

Wu Ming could use his status as the young sect master of the spirit Vulture mountain to oppose Xia ruofei. However, he did not dare to act rashly when facing Liu Mansha, who was on the same level as his father and was even slightly stronger than him.

Wu Ming, who had suffered a loss, glared at Xia ruofei with hatred and shut his mouth unwillingly.

Liu Mansha naturally did not care about the thoughts of a junior. She smiled faintly and said,”Then I’ll start the verification?”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.

“Valley Head Liu,” Luo Feng said.”Please start checking from the first page. If the discrepancy is too big, please stop immediately.”

Luo Feng naturally didn’t want to reveal too much of his family’s treasured cultivation technique. If it wasn’t for the fact that he had been forced into a corner, he wouldn’t even have agreed to this bet. When he thought of this, Luo Feng could not help but glance at Wu Ming with a bit of resentment. He sighed in his heart.

Liu Mansha naturally knew what Luo Feng was thinking. She smiled and nodded, saying,”Naturally!”

After saying that, Liu Mansha placed the handwritten copies of the two families on the coffee table in front of the sofa and turned to the first page at the same time.

Xia ruofei, Luo Feng, and the others naturally looked at the two handwritten copies on the left and right.

As for Shao Qingyang, who was standing outside the barrier, although he could hear everyone’s voices and see the situation inside, everyone’s back was facing him, so his eyes couldn’t see through the human body to see the manuscript on the coffee table. Under the circumstances where he couldn’t use his mental power to investigate, he naturally couldn’t see a single thing.

When Liu Mansha flipped to the first page, Luo Feng immediately glanced at Xia ruofei’s handwritten copy. As Wu Tiancheng’s trusted subordinate, he had studied the original version of the lingjue mountain’s “the glittering jewel true understanding” for many years and was already familiar with the contents. Naturally, there was no need to make any comparisons. He could just look at Xia ruofei’s handwritten copy.

After reading a few lines, Luo Feng’s heart sank. The content that Xia ruofei had copied onto the A4 paper with his distinctive and elegant handwriting was exactly the same as the lingjue mountain ‘s’ the truth of glittering jewels ‘.

How was this possible? Luo Feng sighed in his heart.

Could it be that there were two copies of the glittering jewel true understanding and the lingjue mountain had only obtained one, and it was even an incomplete one?

Luo Feng held on to a glimmer of hope and continued to read anxiously.

It was the same.

It was the same.

It was exactly the same ...

A cultivator’s brain development was far greater than an ordinary person ‘s, so it was easy for him to read ten lines at a glance. Furthermore, there wasn’t much content on a page. After a short while, Luo Feng had finished reading the contents on the first page of Xia ruofei’s handwritten copy.

He felt bitter in his heart – from what he had seen so far, Xia ruofei’s handwritten copy was exactly the same as the beginning of the second volume of the “the truth of glittering jewels – that they had –

If there was anything different, it was that Xia ruofei had added a sentence according to his own understanding of the technique.

There were no punctuation marks in the writing habits of the ancient people, and the cultivation technique was more obscure. Different sentence breaking methods could produce two different understandings.

The second volume of the glittering jewel true understanding that he had obtained from the spirit Vulture mountain was the original copy without any broken sentences. When he was making the manuscript, he had copied the original version of the spirit Vulture mountain.

To Luo Feng’s dismay, he realized that after Xia ruofei’s handwritten copy was broken, it was much easier to understand the technique. There were even two parts where the broken sentences were different from what the cultivators of the spirit Vulture mountain had studied for years. Luo Feng felt that Xia ruofei’s broken sentences were more reasonable.
