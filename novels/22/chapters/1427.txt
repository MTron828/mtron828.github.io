Translator: 549690339

“There’s no shortage of haters on the internet. Without any investigation or evidence, they just come at us! Who did this company offend? I’ve said so much, but I actually want to ask the coachman, what company is this? Are they still recruiting?”

As the post reached the top, more and more netizens clicked on it, and the number of comments quickly exceeded a thousand. Everyone’s comments were mixed, and there were all kinds of opinions. However, the “tricycle driver” didn’t say anything else after he posted.

The old forum members all knew the nature of the job of a “tricycle driver.” If there was a flight mission the next day, he had to ensure that he slept. He might go to sleep after posting the post.

The self – discipline of a pilot was quite good.

Just as everyone was discussing the post, a comment popped up.”Everyone, go to the main post and refresh it. The coachman editor has updated the content of the main post!”

The netizens who saw this comment immediately returned to the first page. After refreshing the page, they saw that the post had been edited by the original poster a minute ago.

The tricycle driver wrote in bold red in the post: I didn’t expect that a random post would cause so much discussion. I’ve seen everyone’s comments. In response to the netizens ‘doubts, I’ll give a simple explanation!

First, I’m definitely not a water Army. The netizens who know me know that although I’m not very rich, at least I’m not a fifty – cent party.

“Second, I won’t comment on whether this company is creating hype or not. At least, so far, I haven’t seen similar content anywhere else on the internet.

“Thirdly, I naturally know the name of the company, but to avoid suspicion of hype, I won’t say it.

Fourth, tomorrow’s flight will be earlier, so I should go and rest, so I won’t be able to see your replies and private messages for the time being. I can only reply after my plane lands.

“Fifth, for the sake of the harmony of the forum, please pay attention to your manners. You are welcome to express your opinions, but if you want to curse, please turn left. This post does not welcome you.

The “tricycle driver” ‘s response was very short, but it caused a wave of praise from the netizens. The anti – fans who had previously “argued with the group of scholars” also disappeared, mainly because there were too many people scolding them.

The “tricycle driver” still had a very good foundation in the Banyan Tree forum.

Of course, the netizens were also against the “tricycle driver” ‘s behavior of not announcing the company’s name. They all expressed that they would not post the pictures but the balls, some kind of spending ten thousand people to stab ...

However, the “tricycle driver” really went to sleep after updating the post. No matter how the netizens called for him in the post, there was no response.

However, the netizens couldn’t do anything if the “tricycle driver” didn’t announce it? That would be underestimating the “human search” godly weapon.

There were many talents on the internet, as if they were all Conan. Soon, someone found some clues in the eight or nine pictures given by the “tricycle driver.”

“Everyone, pay attention to the third picture. You can see half of the LOGO on the upper right corner. Although the image quality is not very clear after compression, you can still see the general outline after zooming in. I have used Photoshop to draw the outline of this half of the LOGO. Don’t you think it looks a little familiar?”

Then, this resourceful netizen posted another picture. It was the complete LOGO that had been removed from the official website of paradise Corporation.

With such a comparison, the netizens found that it was really quite similar. All of a sudden, the reply speed of the post went up.

“What a godly man! I’ve studied these photos for a long time, but I couldn’t find anything wrong with them. How could you find half of the LOGO in such an inconspicuous position?”

“It’s definitely the Paradise Corporation! Because everything makes sense now!”

“Yes, yes, yes! In the past year, the most popular company in Sanshan was undoubtedly the Paradise Corporation!”

“Hehehe!” Static electricity reporting for duty!”

“After this big brother mentioned it, I also saw some traces! Everyone, look at the eighth card. It’s a picture of someone bending over to fish for money. Although it’s quite far away, he really looks like boss Xia from the Paradise Corporation!”

After Deputy – Mayor Jiang Liangyu’s speech at the heart – nourishing soup conference was released by the official media, Xia ruofei had also become a little popular, especially in the three mountains.

Many people had seen some of the publicly released photos, and some fangirls had collected these photos.

After all, Xia ruofei had the masculinity of a soldier. At the same time, after cultivating the great Dao formula, he gave off a very clean and friendly feeling. He was very pleasing to the eye.

After this netizen’s comment, many people also expressed their agreement.

“I think it’s President Xia!”

“He can’t run! He’s my most beloved retired soldier brother!”

“Brother Fei is so righteous! He’s so good to his own employees!”

“Wuwuwu! I also want to apply for the job, but I don’t know if they’re still recruiting!”

“Previous poster, I’ve already inquired about it. The Paradise company will continue to recruit after the new year, but they’re mainly going to the pharmaceutical factory, and most of them are for worker positions!”

“Ah? If I go to the factory, I won’t be able to see the soldier every day! I don’t want to ...” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“You’re thinking too much. Do you think you can see President Xia every day just because you’re at the farm? You’re too na?ve, I have a friend from paradise Corporation. He said that President Xia is always so elusive and often doesn’t show his face for many days!”

“Waa! He’s not always at the company, so doesn’t that mean he has a lot of time to spend with his girlfriend?”
