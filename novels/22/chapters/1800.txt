Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei saw that everyone was looking at each other and no one spoke first. He couldn’t help but laugh and said,””Why are you being so modest at this time? Then I’m going to call names! Director Dong, you go first!”

When Dong Yun heard this, she didn’t decline. She pondered for a moment and said,””Chairman, after our headquarters moved to the city, the employees are facing the problem of accommodation. Now, some employees are renting houses in the city by themselves. Do you think the company can provide some rental subsidies?”

Xia ruofei replied without hesitation,”no problem!” Isn’t the company now fully implementing a hierarchical system? “As long as you’re actually renting a house outside, you’ll be given rent subsidies according to different levels. Director Dong and director pang should discuss it together and come up with a plan as soon as possible! Let’s announce it before the relocation and make everyone happy!”

“Alright!” Dong Yun replied.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”in addition to the rental Allowance, if you’re willing to live on the farm, the company can get an employee bus!” It didn’t cost much to buy two buses. Wasn’t there a gold dragon Company in Heron Island that specialized in bus production? Get in touch and purchase two cars as soon as possible. Also, hire two drivers. Director Dong will be in charge of this matter!”

“No problem!” Dong Yun said as she jotted down notes in her notebook.

After Dong Yun finished speaking, Xiao Qiang looked at everyone and said,”Chairman, I also have something to ask. Our company’s products are doing very well in all major channels and e – commerce. I’m considering ... Should we start setting up our own physical channels?”

Xia ruofei was stunned.”Our products have been in short supply. Is it necessary to set up our own channels?” he asked.

“I personally think it’s quite necessary,” said Xiao Qiang. Firstly, if they always relied on super – Commercial channels, they would always be controlled by others, including e – commerce. After all, it was someone else’s business. This was equivalent to having their life in the hands of others. Also...Developing self – operating channels can also maximize profits, and we don’t have to be exploited by the distributors. ”

Xiao Qiang’s second point was easy to understand. After all, whether it was the supermarket or the e – commerce channel, they also had to make money, which would thin out paradise corporation’s profits.

For the first reason, although Xia ruofei felt that the possibility of all the channels having problems at the same time was very small, there was nothing to refute. After all, nothing was absolute.

At this time, Feng Jing added,”Chairman, I agree with director Xiao’s opinion. I think that opening up our own channels isn’t just about the profit. There’s something more important, which is to increase the invisible value of the brand.”

Feng Jing paused for a moment before she continued,””The self – operating channel I’m talking about should be similar to an offline experience Store, where we can display our company’s various series of products. At the same time, we can also adopt a membership system and even introduce a point system. We can hold member activities from time to time to increase everyone’s loyalty to the brand ...”

Hearing this, Xia ruofei was really tempted. He smiled and said,””I get it, you want to make it like the house of little rice!”

Xiaomi’s brand had been criticized by many people, who believed that it was more about marketing than substance. As more and more companies became Xiaomi’s so – called ecosystem company, Xiaomi’s Mall was becoming more and more like a grocery store. However, everyone had to admit that the results were indeed excellent after the marketing was done to the extreme.

Moreover, the cohesiveness of the millet fans was still very high. Some people would buy it as soon as a new product was released. The whole house was filled with the products of millet and its ecological chain enterprises, which was very similar to those die – hard fruit fans.

“Yes, I am!” Feng Rao said,”we can also build a paradise!”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,””Since you’ve made this proposal, you must have a specific plan. Director Xiao, please tell us!” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Seeing that Xia ruofei was moved, Xiao Qiang couldn’t help but feel happy and quickly said,””Chairman, we initially hope to open two self – operated stores in Sanshan city in the first half of the year and strive to cover all the prefecture – Level cities in the southeast province by the year.”

“Hmm, this plan isn’t too radical.” Xia ruofei asked,”what’s the long – term plan?”

“Considering the coverage of the company’s products, we hope to be able to expand our self – Service stores to the entire East China region within two years. We will also set up stores in the prefecture – Level cities and above, and we will open one or two more in the provincial and sub – provincial cities. Xiao Qiang said,”in the future, we naturally hope to open the Paradise home all over the country. If we can really do this, I think we will no longer rely on these existing channels!”

Xia ruofei nodded and asked,”this must have cost a lot, right?”

“The one – time investment is mainly for the renovation of the store. Xiao Qiang said,”the continuous expenses are the store rent and the employee’s salary. We have made a preliminary calculation. The budget for the construction of each store is about three million Yuan. Of course, the expenses are different in different cities.”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”how about this?” We’ll make a budget of 10 million to open two paradises in the three mountains to test the waters. If the results are good, we’ll continue to expand!”

“Okay, Chairman,” Xiao Qiang said, overjoyed.”I’ll come up with a specific plan and budget as soon as possible!”
