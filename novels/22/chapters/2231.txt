2232 A happy gathering (2)

Qin Yanan quickly stood up and held the wine glass with both hands.””Chairman, I should be the one to respect you! I’ll drink first as a form of respect!”

After she finished speaking, she raised her head and drank the remaining half of the glass of noble rot wine in the quilt.

Xia ruofei quickly replied,”I’m fine!” It’s fine! Yanan, drink slowly! We’re not forcing them to drink, so we’ll drink as much as we can!”

After that, Xia ruofei also finished the glass of liquor.

Qin Yanan wiped her mouth with a tissue and said with a smile,””I’m fine. Thank you for your concern, Chairman!”

Xia ruofei nodded and asked,””Oh right, the meeting with xiangnan TV this afternoon, did it go smoothly?”

“It’s going quite smoothly!”Qin Yanan nodded. They’ve attached great importance to the Chairman’s participation in the program’s recording this time, and they’ve ensured and coordinated everything in place. We’ll continue to communicate the specific details tomorrow, and I’ll give you a detailed report tomorrow afternoon. The production team will start the full recording the day after tomorrow. ”

Xia ruofei nodded.”Alright. I’ll leave it to you. I’m very assured!”

“Thank you for your affirmation, Chairman!” Qin Yanan pursed her lips and smiled.”By the way, I also learned today that the first batch of supplies we promised to provide to the program group has all been delivered. The vegetable greenhouse attached to the mushroom house has also been successfully transplanted. After long – distance transportation, our vegetables still have a high survival rate!”

“That’s good!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”come! He Yu, I also propose a toast to you!”

He Yu quickly stood up and said, somewhat overwhelmed by the unexpected favor,”Chairman, a toast to you!”

When Xia ruofei was talking to Qin Yanan and he Yu, Zhao Yongjun and the others had lowered their voices as well, so they could hear the contents of their conversation clearly.

After Xia ruofei and he Yu finished drinking, Hou Liang could not help but ask,”Brother Xia, why are you guys providing free supplies to the festival Group?”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”It’s just some vegetable seedlings. There’s also our Dahongpao tea leaves, Yushi cream, and so on. They’re all our own products. They’re also advertising for us!”

“How could Gao Jun do this?” Hou Liang frowned and said,”how can he take your things for free? Furthermore, didn’t he know how valuable the Jade skin cream and Da Hong Pao were? It wasn’t like the festival Group didn’t have money, so these things should be bought with money! I’ll give him a call later!”

When Qin Yanan heard this, she couldn’t help but be stunned.

There’s such an operation?

Xiangnan TV used your product to advertise for you. It’s already unprecedented that they didn’t charge you for your advertising fees, yet you still want to charge them?

Qin Yanan felt that the skinny young man in front of him probably didn’t understand the situation, so he made such a joke.

However, when she thought about it, she felt that something was amiss. Just now, Hou Liang had mentioned Gao Jun’s name and even said that he would call him to scold him. This meant that Hou Liang knew Gao Jun and their relationship was obviously not ordinary. Otherwise, he would not have said such things.

However, she still found it unbelievable and couldn’t help but look at Xia ruofei.

Originally, Qin Yanan thought that Xia ruofei would explain to Hou Liang what it meant to plant an advertisement. Unexpectedly, Xia ruofei just smiled and said,””Monkey! Don’t make things difficult for station head Gao! These products were only expensive, but in reality, the production cost was not that high. It did not cost much! You didn’t want me to be stingy, did you? You should know that you’re the one who pulled the strings for this matter. Our paradise Corporation is so stingy, isn’t that embarrassing for you?”

“Brother Xia, how much is my monkey face worth?” Hou Liang said,”Gao Jun didn’t handle this matter properly! This is not giving you any face!”

Song Rui was also someone who wished for the world to be in chaos. He immediately echoed,””Monkey, that makes sense! That station head Gao dared to use ruofei’s things for free, that’s not giving us face! I say ... Find a chance to talk to your old man? When the time was right, he would make room for this guy! Xiangnan satellite TV’s Deputy Director in charge of entertainment is a lucrative position!”

Qin Yanan felt as if his brain was about to crash. These young people were actually so boastful. A Deputy station head of a provincial station could be changed just like that? He didn’t even drink a few glasses of wine! He was this drunk?

However, Qin Yanan quickly realized that he was wrong. Xia ruofei was not joking at all. He was serious.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”no, no, no!” Don’t you guys get on the hook! I have a good relationship with the high platform! Don’t add to the mess! I’m doing pretty well, why should I change for no reason!”

To be honest, Gao Jun was indeed a good person. He had lowered his attitude to the extreme. However, he probably never thought that he would be remembered by song Rui, Hou Liang, and the other Playboys just because the Paradise Corporation provided some products for free.

If that was the case, he would be too wronged ... How much were those things worth? How could it compare to the huge advertising effect?

Zhao Yongjun cleared his throat and said,””Ruofei is right. Xiao Rui, monkey, don’t shout about killing for no reason! You guys don’t understand the situation, so just do as RUO Fei says!”

Zhao Yongjun had absolute authority in their small circle. Hou Liang scratched his head in embarrassment and said,””Jun bro, I know ... Me too ... Wasn’t I the one who pulled the strings? I just think that things weren’t done well enough!”

Xia ruofei quickly smiled and said,”I’m fine!” He was fine! That’s good enough. Monkey, thank you! Come, come, come, let us brothers have a drink!”

Qin Yanan’s heart trembled. From Xia ruofei, Zhao Yongjun, and the others ‘words, she could guess that the people at this table today probably had terrifying backgrounds. Of course, in addition to the shock, she also felt extremely at ease that the chairman of Xuanji was brothers with these second – generation heirs who had a lot of power in Beijing. Then, the resistance in the company’s development process would definitely be much less.

At this moment, Zhuo Yiyi gently touched Qin Yanan’s arm, leaned over, and whispered,””Yanan, ruofei didn’t tell you who these people are, did he?”

“No...” Qin Yanan shook her head slightly.

Zhuo Yiyi smiled and said,”I knew it just by looking at your expression!” If I didn’t know them, I would also think that these people are definitely boasting and flattering each other!”

“So you’re saying it’s not?” Qin Yanan asked with a smile.

“It really isn ‘t!” Zhuo Yiyi said,”do you know what that ‘monkey’ over there is for?”

“What are you doing?” Qin Yanan asked.

“It doesn’t matter what he did!” Zhuo Yiyi smiled and said,”but his father is the executive Deputy Chief of the state radio, film, and television ...”

Qin Yanan suddenly understood. No wonder Hou Liang was so confident. So it was because of this layer of relationship.

Zhuo Yiyi smiled.”Since RUO Fei didn’t tell you, I won’t tell you the rest one by one. If you’re interested, you can go ask your Chairman yourself.”

“Thank you, sister Yiyi!” Qin Yanan said in a low voice. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

On the other side, Xia ruofei and Zhao Yongjun’s conversation topic had shifted to some anecdote in the circle of the capital.

Although Qin Yanan and he Yu were not in this circle, Xia ruofei still trusted them, so everyone did not avoid them.

“By the way, Xiao Rui, don’t tell your old master about my return for now!” Xia ruofei said,”I’m about to start recording the show. I’ll pay him a visit after I’m done!”

“I know!” Song Rui said lazily,”I don’t usually go back!”

“Speaking of which ... Have you guys heard? it seems that the Liu family’s young lady is not in good health ...” Song Rui added.

“Which Liu family?” Xia ruofei asked subconsciously, then immediately came back to his senses.”You mean that old man from Liu haofan’s family?”
