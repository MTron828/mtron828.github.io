With that, Xue Jinshan quickly led the way. A group of people surrounded Xia ruofei as they walked to the reception room in the branch factory.

Xia ruofei was carrying a box in his hand as he followed Xue Jinshan to the reception room. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei opened the locked suitcase, revealing stacks of hundred – Yuan bills.

“Help me pack the red packets! It’s three hundred Yuan per serving!” Xia ruofei poured all the money in the locked suitcase on the coffee table.

“Yes! President Xia!”

Xue Jinshan quickly called for a few of his subordinates to help Xia ruofei pack the red packet.

There was strength in numbers. After about half an hour, the red packets were all prepared.

Xia ruofei simply asked Xue Jinshan to find a small cart, put the red packets in plastic bags, and then put them in the compartment of the cart.

Xue Jinshan quickly found someone to help push the cart and then carried Xia ruofei to the production workshop.

The advanced production line was running at full speed, and the workers were busy working in an orderly manner. Some were monitoring the status of the equipment, some were busy at the feed port, and some were doing sample testing on the produced drugs …

Xia ruofei and the others changed into sterile clothes and entered the workshop.

Xue Jinshan clapped his hands and shouted,”brothers and sisters! President Xia is here to visit everyone!”

“Everyone, you’ve worked hard!” Xia ruofei said loudly,”everyone, please continue to work at your posts. It’s not easy to stick to your posts on the first day of the first lunar month! Thank you!”

Xia ruofei looked around and continued,””I’ve prepared a red packet for everyone. I hope that everyone will continue to work hard in the new year and create more glory!”

After that, Xia ruofei personally went to each post to give out red packets to everyone.

When the employees received this unexpected surprise, they were naturally excited. Each and every one of them was full of energy and threw themselves into their work.

After leaving the first workshop, Xia ruofei went to the second workshop, then the third workshop…

Very quickly, he had gone around and sent out tens of thousands of red packets.

Of course, Xia ruofei did not care about money.

“President Xia, just stay for lunch in the pharmaceutical factory!” Xue Jinshan said. We’ll just eat our staff’s food, how about that?”

Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory’s products had always been in short supply. After opening a branch factory in Changping County, they could basically meet the domestic demand. However, there were also a large number of people with autism who were waiting for medicine abroad, and the gap in the export had always been huge.

Therefore, even during the new year, the production line of the pharmaceutical factory was still running.

As for Taoyuan farm, they also needed people to keep watch.

Of course, these workers who stuck to their work during the spring Festival were also strictly paid three times their salary according to the regulations by the Paradise company. Everyone was also given a big red packet for the new year.

Therefore, everyone actively stayed to work, and then adjusted to a time after the spring Festival when there was less manpower shortage. The workers of the pharmaceutical factory and the farm had a holiday every year, but they needed to make overall arrangements to ensure that the work ran smoothly.

Xia ruofei first went to visit the farm workers and security guards who stayed behind to keep watch. He even gave them a red packet in his own name.

Of course, he had bought the red packet at the convenience store near the village entrance.

The lucky number at San Shan was 3, so Xia ruofei gave each red packet 300 yuan. Although it was not a lot, it was a big surprise for the employees. The main reason was that the boss came to visit them on the first day of the new year. This was also a form of recognition and respect for their work.

Then, Xia ruofei arrived at the pharmaceutical factory.

Now that the manufacturing factory’s branch was connected to Tao Yuan farm, Xia ruofei could reach the manufacturing factory by driving through the farm’s internal road.

Xia ruofei’s visit this time was a spontaneous one and he did not inform anyone. However, after he had been to the farm, he could not keep it a secret.

The farm and the pharmaceutical factory were under the same company, and they lived next to each other, so they had a lot of interaction. As soon as Xia ruofei left the farm, he received a call from the factory.

Hence, when Xia ruofei drove into the factory from the back, he saw Xue Jinshan already waiting by the roadside.

Xia ruofei stopped the car, opened the door and got out.

Xue Jinshan hurriedly brought a few core members to welcome them.

“Old Xue, why didn’t you go home to rest during the new year?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

Xue Jinshan must have been on duty at the factory branch today. Otherwise, even if the farm had informed them in advance, he wouldn’t have appeared in time. After all, it would only take three to five minutes at most to drive here.

Xue Jinshan smiled and said,”Happy New Year, general manager Xia!” The branch factory is rushing for a batch of export orders. I’m a little worried, so I came over to keep an eye on it! Besides, everyone is working overtime. As the factory manager, how can 1 run home for the new year?”

“Your girlfriend has no objections?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

Although Xue Jinshan was already the factory director of the pharmaceutical factory, that was because Xia ruofei did not stick to one pattern and demoted his talent. In fact, he had only graduated from his master’s degree a few years ago. He was still very young and had not married. He only had a girlfriend.

If it was in other companies, no matter how heaven – defying Xue Jinshan was, it would be impossible for him to reach such a height. At most, he would be a small manager.

Hence, Xue Jinshan had always been grateful for Xia ruofei’s help.

Xue Jinshan laughed and said,”President Xia, it’s not a problem to coax your girlfriend. It’s not easy to find such a satisfying job …”

“You have the guts to say that in front of your girlfriend?” Xia ruofei scolded jokingly.

“I said that in front of her! And she’s also quite supportive of me being busy with my career at this stage.” Xue Jinshan said with a smile.

“You little brat, you’ve done a lot of good in your past life! You’re so reasonable even when you’re looking for a girlfriend!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

After exchanging a few pleasantries, Xia ruofei pulled Xue Jinshan to the side and asked,””Kanayama, go and prepare some empty red packets for me.” “President Xia, how much do you want?” Xue Jinshan didn’t think too much and asked directly.

“All the employees working overtime at the branch factory today are counted, including you. Prepare as many red packets as there are people.” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Xue Jinshan finally understood and quickly said,”President Xia, the company has already paid everyone three times their salary. We have also given red packets to the employees who insisted on working during the new year. You don’t have to give them any more!”

“That’s a separate matter. This is a little token of my appreciation to my employees.” Xia ruofei said,”stop dawdling. Hurry up and count the number of people and prepare red packets!” I’ve already prepared the money, it’s in the trunk!”

Xia ruofei had indeed taken out a box of hundred – Yuan cash from the spirit map space and placed it in the Knight XV’s trunk.

“Alright!” Xue Jinshan replied. 1’11 get someone to prepare it immediately!”

After a while, Xue Jinshan came over with a plastic bag. Inside the plastic bag were stacks of empty red packets.

“President Xia, I’ve brought the red packet!” Xue Jinshan said,”we’ve calculated that there are a total of 342 people in the management and employees of the factory! I’ve prepared 400 red packets, it’s definitely enough!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said,”let’s find a place to prepare the red packets. Then, we’ll go to the production workshop to visit everyone.”

“Then let’s go to the reception room!” Xue Jinshan quickly said,”that place has just been renovated. It hasn’t even been officially put into use yet!”

With that, Xue Jinshan quickly led the way. A group of people surrounded Xia ruofei as they walked to the reception room in the branch factory.

Xia ruofei was carrying a box in his hand as he followed Xue Jinshan to the reception room.

Xia ruofei opened the locked suitcase, revealing stacks of hundred – Yuan bills.

“Help me pack the red packets! It’s three hundred Yuan per serving!” Xia ruofei poured all the money in the locked suitcase on the coffee table.

“Yes! President Xia!”

Xue Jinshan quickly called for a few of his subordinates to help Xia ruofei pack the red packet.

There was strength in numbers. After about half an hour, the red packets were all prepared.

Xia ruofei simply asked Xue Jinshan to find a small cart, put the red packets in plastic bags, and then put them in the compartment of the cart..
