Chapter 1854: Imparting knowledge and answering questions (2)

Translator: 549690339

“Yes, sir!” Xia ruofei immediately replied.

Then, he walked quickly to the kitchen. Ling Qingxue was about to sit on the sofa in the living room to rest when Xia ruofei immediately popped his head out of the kitchen and asked with a smile,””Wife, after dinner, do you think it’s okay to do some exercise to digest your food?”

Ling Qingxue blushed and said,””Let’s see if your cooking skills can move me ...”

“Wife, just wait and see!” Xia ruofei’s heart skipped a beat.

……

He did not know if Ling Qingxue was satisfied with Xia ruofei’s cooking, but he was sure that Ling Qingxue was quite satisfied with that “after – meal exercise”. It could be seen from the fragrant sweat on her forehead and the flush on her cheeks.

She curled up in Xia ruofei’s arms and said reluctantly,””Ruofei, I have to go back today ...”

Xia ruofei caressed Ling Qingxue’s smooth shoulders and said,””I’ll just go back for a day or two and come back! Remember to tell uncle Ling to find a professional team of managers to manage the company as soon as possible. That way, you can get away from the complicated work. Didn’t my adopted husband give me a Gulfstream? When the time comes, you can take a long vacation and we’ll travel around the world on a private jet!”

Ling Qingxue’s heart was filled with anticipation as she said,””Mm! I’ll try my best to convince my dad ...”

The two of them slept in each other’s arms for a while and only got up at four in the afternoon. Ling Qingxue washed up and dressed up, then walked to Xia ruofei and said softly,””Ruofei, I’ll be leaving then ...”

Xia ruofei cupped Ling Qingxue’s face in his hands and kissed her tender red lips. He said,””Mm! Be careful when you drive ...”

The two of them held hands and went downstairs. Xia ruofei handed Ling Qingxue a paper bag that he had already prepared and said,””This is for your future father – in – Law.”

Ling Qingxue opened the paper bag and took a look. Inside were two bottles of expensive rotten wine and a box of Dahongpao tea leaves.

She nodded.”Sure. Everything you’ve brought out is good stuff. He’ll definitely like it!”

“I have to curry favor with my father – in – Law!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”generally speaking, in the eyes of the Father – in – Law, the son – in – Law is a robber who stole his treasure ...”

“It’s not that exaggerated ...”Ling Qingxue pouted.

Xia ruofei suddenly thought of a joke and laughed.”You don’t say. I saw a passage a few days ago, and it was quite appropriate ...”

“What did he say?” Ling Qingxue asked curiously.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”they say that raising a daughter is like planting a pot of rare flowers. You have to be careful and take care of her. You’re afraid of the sun on sunny days and the rain on rainy days. You’re afraid of the summer heat and the winter cold. You’ve worried your heart and looked forward to it so much. Finally, the flowers bloomed and stunned everyone, but they were taken away by a man called son – in – Law!”

After Ling Qingxue heard this, she held her stomach and laughed out loud.”Where did you learn all this nonsense from? By the way, what about raising a son?”

“There’s also a son!” Xia ruofei said,”it’s said that raising a son is similar to playing a game. You create an account, come up with a name, and start to level up. You keep throwing money ... Throwing money ... Throwing money ... You level up every year. When you level up and have amazing equipment, your account was hacked by someone called daughter – in – Law!”

“Hahaha!” Ling Qingxue laughed so hard that she couldn’t even straighten her back.

Xia ruofei said with a serious face,”you can try to use my account!” My parents “spirits in heaven will be so happy to see me find such a beautiful wife ...”

Ling Qingxue then remembered that Xia ruofei’s closest family members were no longer around. In reality, he was all alone. She could not help but hug Xia ruofei and said softly,””Ruofei, no matter what happens, I will always be by your side!”

Xia ruofei saw that Ling Qingxue’s eyes were a little red. He smiled and pinched her cheek. “Weren’t you telling a joke? Why did you start crying?”

Ling Qingxue’s face heated up slightly as she said,””Isn’t it all your fault?”

Then, she left Xia ruofei’s arms and said,””I’m leaving!”

Xia ruofei sent Ling Qingxue to the door with a smile and watched her drive away. Then, he returned to the villa.

Xia ruofei remembered that he had not entered the origin space for a long time. As he had been with Ling Qingxue these few days, it had not been convenient for him to do things. Now that he finally had some time alone, he went to the bedroom upstairs, locked the door and windows, summoned the spirit map space, and entered it with a thought.

It was still the familiar refreshing air and the dense spiritual Qi that had already turned into mist. Xia ruofei could not help but feel refreshed in this environment.

He could sense that Xia Qing was in the mountain and sea realm, and so with a flash, he appeared beside her.

What came into view was a paddy field. Green rice seedlings had already been planted in the paddy field. The rows of seedlings were straight, and each seedling looked very lively.

Beside the paddy field, there was a simple water channel that drew in the irrigation water from the big River at the foot of the mountain.

“Master!” When Xia Qing saw Xia ruofei, she quickly bowed and greeted him.

Xia ruofei nodded.”You’re done so quickly. You’re very efficient!”

“Growing seedlings is done at the Archean realm,” Xia Qing said.”It saves time. Opening up a paddy field is actually very easy ...”

Xia ruofei praised,”well done!” I couldn’t tell that you had such a talent for farming! You have to take good care of these two mu of land. Whether I can eat high – Quality rice or not, it’s all up to you!”

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing immediately said,”this subordinate will definitely do her best!”

In fact, rice didn’t need to be taken care of, and there were no pests in this space. Moreover, the spirit Qi in the environment was so strong that the water used to irrigate the rice was the same as the water in the spirit pool. Basically, after planting the rice, they just had to wait for the harvest.

Xia Qing continued,”in order to let master eat the rice produced in the spirit map world as soon as possible, I have also opened up a small paddy field in the Archean realm. The first batch of rice should be produced in a few days. However, due to the limited space, the production rate might not be too high.”

The rice that Xia ruofei had bought would take about five months to ripen. At the Archean realm, time passed 30 times faster, so it would only take five to six days to ripen.

However, the space at the Archean realm was too small, so it was impossible to plant them on a large scale. It was only enough for Xia ruofei to try out the new ones.

Hearing this, Xia ruofei was very happy.””Not bad, not bad! Inform me immediately when the time comes!”

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing said.

Xia ruofei looked around and asked,”did that realm Fox cause any trouble recently?”

Xia Qing laughed and said,”it hasn’t moved for a long time. It seems that it has a new understanding of the spatial rules. Perhaps it is about to make a breakthrough!”

Xia ruofei said,”we can’t keep it for nothing. We have to let it do some work!” Let me know when it’s done with its cultivation!”

The biggest help that the realm Fox could provide Xia ruofei was naturally to find the realm stone. It was extremely sensitive to the realm stone. With it, it was like having a super radar that was specifically used to find the realm stone.

The upgrade of the space could not be done without the world stones. Xia ruofei was prepared to bring the White world Fox Around the World when he had some free time. He hoped to collect as many world stones as possible to provide the spirit map space for the breakthrough.

“Understood!” Xia Qing replied calmly.

Next, Xia ruofei patrolled around his personal territory, including the spirit map Island in the realm heart. He took the motorboat and patrolled around. All sorts of precious crops were growing well, and the entire realm was thriving.

After he was done, Xia ruofei bade Xia Qing farewell and left the medium, keeping the spirit map scroll.

After returning to the outside world, Xia ruofei picked up the phone on the table and realized that there was a missed call from Song Wei.

He couldn’t help but feel a sense of guilt. He had been busy helping Ling Qingxue with her cultivation for the past few days and had barely contacted Song Wei. After all, it wasn’t convenient for him to contact her with Ling Qingxue by his side. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

With a slight sense of guilt, Xia ruofei immediately called back.
