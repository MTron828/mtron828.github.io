Chapter 1797: Cultivating the heart - concentrating grass (1)

Translator: 549690339

Xia Qing thought that Xia ruofei would hesitate, but she didn’t expect him to be so determined. She couldn’t help but freeze.

“Master, that’s at least five spiritual crystals!” Xia Qing couldn’t help but remind him,”moreover ... It’s still unknown how much effect a stalk of heart concentrating grass has. We might need two or three stalks ...”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”as many as you want!” As long as he had enough crystals! Even if I need ten or even twenty, you can cultivate them as much as you want!”

Seeing this, Xia Qing also knew that there was no need to persuade him anymore. She nodded and said,””Yes, master, I’ll do it now!”

Xia Qing continued: “but ... Master, you will need to personally retrieve the heart condensing grass from the realm Heart Island. Other than you, no one else can enter.”

“No problem!” Xia ruofei asked,”are there any precautions for digging out this heart concentrating grass?”

“There’s nothing special to pay attention to. There’s only one thing, and that’s that you must use a wooden shovel.” Xia Qing said,”in addition, try not to hurt the roots of the heart concentrating grass. Otherwise, you may need more spirit crystals to recover!”

“I know!” Xia ruofei said,”I’ll go now!”

With that, Xia ruofei waved his hand, and a wooden shovel flew into his hand from the tool rack. Then, with a single thought, he appeared at the seaside of the mountain sea realm.

Xia ruofei got on the motorboat and sped towards the direction of the realm Heart Island.

After arriving at the realm Heart Island, Xia ruofei did not waste any time. He immediately found that heart concentrating grass.

Because Xia ruofei had just harvested it not long ago, there was only a small section of the heart condensing grass left and it looked very unremarkable.

Xia ruofei mumbled to himself.”It’s up to you whether Qingxue can cultivate successfully. You have to work hard!”

With that, Xia ruofei started digging with a wooden shovel. His movements were very careful because he would have to spend more spiritual crystals if he accidentally touched any of the roots.

Although he had told Xia Qing that he would cultivate enough heart – concentrating herbs at all costs, Xia ruofei still cherished the spiritual crystals, which were extremely precious cultivation resources. It would be good if he could waste less.

It took him more than an hour to dig out the soil around the heart condensing grass. In the end, he pulled up the entire heart condensing grass.

Xia ruofei had even left some soil to maintain the vitality of the heart – concentrating grass.

After everything was settled, Xia ruofei did not waste a single second and immediately left.

After leaving the boundary of the realm Heart Island, Xia ruofei directly used his mind and disappeared from the sea. The next moment, he appeared in the middle of the Archean realm.

Due to the difference in the flow of time, Xia Qing had already set up a small spirit gathering array in the Archean realm. Six spirit crystals were neatly stacked at the eye of the spirit gathering array. This array was slightly different from ordinary spirit gathering arrays. After the array was activated, it would only absorb spiritual energy from the spirit crystals at the eye of the array and would not use the spiritual energy within the spirit map space.

The reason why six of them were placed was naturally to ensure that nothing would go wrong.

In theory, five spiritual crystals were enough. However, if the spiritual crystals were all used up and the heart – concentrating grass was not ripe yet, the array would automatically start to absorb the spiritual Qi in the space.

The heart – concentrating grass consumed a lot of spiritual energy, especially at a time flow of 2000 times. If Xia Qing was delayed for even a moment and didn’t notice this situation in time, the spirit map space might suffer a great loss of vitality due to the excessive consumption of spiritual energy.

Therefore, it was the safest to put six crystals in.

Xia ruofei’s heart ached as he looked at the spiritual crystals. If these six spiritual crystals were used for cultivation, it would be enough to support Xia ruofei’s cultivation to the foundation establishment stage. If it were given to others, Xia ruofei could cultivate at least seven or eight cultivators who were at the same level as him.

And now, just to cultivate a small blade of grass, the price paid was quite high.

Of course, Xia ruofei was just lamenting. He would not change his mind just because of the consumption. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

He carefully handed the heart concentrating grass to Xia Qing and said solemnly,””Xia Qing, I’ll be counting on you for the rest of the matter!”

“Don’t worry! Master, although I can’t guarantee that the heart – concentrating grass will be of great use, I’m confident that I can quickly cultivate a mature heart – concentrating grass without considering the cost!” Xia Qing said.

“You can go plant it!” Xia ruofei said,”I’ll wait here!”

“Yes, master!”

Xia Qing re – planted the heart – concentrating grass in the spirit gathering array. Then, Xia ruofei quickly set up time array flags around the spirit gathering array.

The entire formation had been compressed to the extreme. Compared to the outside world, the time inside the spirit gathering formation was about two thousand times faster.

“Xia Qing, you can temporarily put aside the other matters!” Xia ruofei reminded him,”you must take good care of this heart concentrating grass. If you really can’t do it, you can stop all other work and focus on taking care of the heart concentrating grass!” You must ensure that the cultivation is successful, and at the same time, it can not affect the spirit map world. If even six spirit crystals are not enough, you must replenish them in time! You don’t need to ask me anymore!”

“I understand! Don’t worry, master!” Xia Qing said.

“Thank you for your hard work ...” Xia ruofei said.

Although Xia Qing was only a soul puppet, he didn’t need sleep and was absolutely loyal to his master, Xia ruofei still felt that Xia Qing’s sleepless work made him look like a capitalist who was exploiting his labor.
