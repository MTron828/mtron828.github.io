But he still did it. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Lu You said in her heart,’even song Rui, this hedonistic son of a rich family who is usually not serious, can disregard everything for love. Why do I not dare to face my heart and always be overcautious?’

Lu You’s beautiful eyes moved. She bit her lower lip gently as thoughts spun in her mind.

After Xia ruofei finished talking about song Rui and Zhuo Yiyi, he turned to look at Lu You and couldn’t help but ask,””Lu You, what’s wrong? Are you alright?”

“I’m fine ...” Lu You replied subconsciously. However, she immediately looked up at Xia ruofei and said,”no, I’m not!”

Xia ruofei was confused by Lu You’s nonsensical words. He smiled bitterly and said,””Young miss Lu, are you possessed? Why was he speaking in such a jumble? Could it be that brother Wu’s house is not clean? I’ve spent more than a hundred million ...”

Lu You glared at Xia ruofei and said,””You’re the one who’s possessed!”

Then, Lu You’s face suddenly blushed, but she quickly returned to normal. She stared into Xia ruofei’s eyes seriously and said word by word,””Xia ruofei, I like you!”

Xia ruofei was petrified.

Although Lu You’s voice was soft, it was like a huge Bell to Xia ruofei, causing his heart to tremble. At the same time, he subconsciously looked at the crowd on the other side of the pool. When he realized that they were not paying attention to him, he heaved a sigh of relief.

Immediately after, Xia ruofei felt his head throb. He stuttered,””Lu You, I ...”

“Let me finish,” Lu You said very calmly,”I’ve never dared to face my heart, but today, I don’t want to run away anymore. I don’t know when it started. Maybe it was you who nurtured Mo Lan for us, or you protected me on the plane without a care for your own safety, or you saved me from the bar ... Anyway, I know that I’ve already fallen for you, but I just haven’t been willing to face it ...”

Xia ruofei sat there in a daze, his mouth slightly open.

Lu You continued to say in one breath,””I’ve always had these concerns because you already have a girlfriend. My best friend, Jiang Yue, is also infatuated with you ...”

When Lu You said this, she revealed a self – deprecating smile and said,””I’ve always said that Yueyue is a coward, but I’m not even as good as her. At least, she never hid her feelings for you in front of me, while I always pretended that I didn’t care about you ...”

Then, Lu You’s expression became much more determined. She bravely looked into Xia ruofei’s eyes and said,””After hearing about song Rui today, I’m very touched. I’ve decided not to run away anymore. I must tell you what I’m thinking!”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a while before he smiled bitterly and said,”Lu You, I’m really honored ... But you know ... I already have a girlfriend ...”

“So what?” Lu You shrugged her shoulders and said,”that’s your business. As long as you’re not married, I still have the chance to compete with Ling Qingxue.”

Xia ruofei’s expression was very interesting at the moment. He felt that he was being ridiculous. He had only told Lu You the story of song Rui and Zhuo Yiyi. How could it have given Lu You such a big shock?

Could it be that he was getting his retribution for gossiping about others behind their backs?

However, how could it be retribution to be liked by such a beautiful woman with a good family background, a hot figure, and excellent looks?

Lu You took a deep breath and said,””Xia ruofei, you don’t have to feel pressured. It’s my business that I like you. Although I will compete with Ling Qingxue, I’m not the kind of woman who will pester you. Huhu ... I feel so much better after I say it!”

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly.”You’re feeling better, but I’m in a dilemma.”

Although Xia ruofei had already noticed it, he could at least pretend that he did not know as long as they did not say it out loud. However, there was no room for escape now.

Xia ruofei sighed and said,””Lu You, actually, you don’t have to ...”

Lu You smiled easily and interrupted Xia ruofei.””Alright, take your time and sit down! I’ll go drink with Sister Feng and the others!”

Lu You stood up and took two steps before turning back and saying with a smile,””By the way, I don’t think you need to worry at all. Even if I didn’t say this, your love life doesn’t seem to be so calm!”

After saying that, Lu You looked at Feng Rao who was not far away. She pouted and said,””For example, your CEO Feng, and I heard that uncle song’s Weiwei also ...”

At this point, Lu You pursed her lips and smiled. She said,””Anyway, you don’t have to worry about your debts, right?”

After she finished speaking, Lu You smiled at Xia ruofei and walked briskly towards Feng Rao and the rest.

It was as if she felt much more relaxed after she had said everything that was on her mind.

However, while Lu You was relaxed, Xia ruofei felt a mountain of pressure. He sat on the chair in a daze and stared at the water in the pool.

He had mixed feelings in his heart. He couldn’t tell what he was feeling. There was worry, helplessness, and of course, a little pride. In short, it was a very complicated feeling.

Life was just like this ...
