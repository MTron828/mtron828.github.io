Chapter 124: MA Xiong’s gift (1)

Chapter 4: seeking monthly votes and subscriptions! Xia ruofei looked at the White truffle in the chef’s hand and wanted to snatch it away and throw it into the spirit map space. He almost couldn’t help but ask MA Xiong for the remaining half truffle. However, Xia ruofei knew that he couldn’t be so impulsive. Otherwise, it would be too suspicious. After the White truffle was picked, it would not be preserved for more than a week. If he didn’t eat it, what was he going to do? Hence, Xia ruofei waited until the luncheon was over. Every dish of this meal used top – Quality ingredients, and several dishes were accompanied by precious white truffle. Even if it was a very ordinary dish, the taste of white truffle would immediately change dramatically. This made Xia ruofei even more determined to develop his white truffle plantation business. After the meal, Xia ruofei reminisced and said,””Mr. MA, this white truffle is really impressive and memorable!” “Xia Sheng, that’s what every customer who has tasted the high – Quality white truffle would say,” MA Xiong laughed. Xia ruofei deliberately put on a bitter face and said,”old Mr. MA, you’ve brought me harm!” I can’t taste anything after I go back!” Seeing Xia ruofei’s high opinion of the White truffle, MA Xiong was very happy. He laughed and said,””Xia Sheng, this is easy! This is the season for truffles. I’ll immediately order my men Italy to buy it and then fly it directly to the three mountains so that you can taste the freshest truffles!” Xia ruofei was shocked and quickly said,””No, it’s too precious ... But since you’re familiar with it, I’d like to trouble you to help me buy a batch of high – Quality truffles ...” “A batch?” MA Xiong asked in shock. “I don’t need a lot, just one or two kilograms!” Xia ruofei was a little embarrassed as he said,”I’ll eat a portion for myself. I’m planning to give some to the elders.” “No problem!” MA Xiong said straightforwardly. Xia ruofei said happily,”thank you!” I’ll pay for it ...” “Xia Sheng, let’s not talk about the money!” MA Xiong waved his hand and interrupted Xia ruofei.”I don’t even know how to repay you for saving my life! Besides, you should know that this small amount of money is nothing to me. Just give me a chance to express my sincerity!” Xia ruofei thought for a while and smiled,”sure!” I’ll have to trouble you then!” MA Xiong invited Xia ruofei to stay in Hong Kong for a few more days, but Xia ruofei was still worried about his company, so he declined politely. He stayed at the MA family’s house for a day and prepared a course of Chinese medicine for Huanhuan. This time, he added two – thirds of the petals of the exotic flower. This way, Huanhuan would be able to recover completely after the course of treatment. That day, Ma Zhiming didn’t go to work. Instead, he brought his wife and daughter to tour Hong Kong with Xia ruofei. In the evening, Ma Zhiming and his wife brought Huanhuan along with Xia ruofei on MA Xiong’s Sunseeker luxury yacht for a night tour of Hong Kong. They enjoyed the beautiful night view of Hong Kong. The next day, Ma Zhiming’s family personally sent Xia ruofei to the airport. They used MA Xiong’s private jet, a Gulfstream 650, to send Xia ruofei back to San Shan city. Xia ruofei also enjoyed the luxurious charter flight service. Not only that, but he also had a check of 5 million Chinese dollars in his arms. This was the consultation fee for MA Xiong’s treatment. Xia ruofei had made a special trip to Hong Kong for this and had even used a precious flower petal. Hence, he did not reject it and accepted it. In addition to the one million they had paid for Huanhuan’s medical fees, Xia ruofei had already made six million Chinese dollars, which was several times more than what he had earned from stone gambling, growing vegetables, and selling meat. Private planes, luxury cars, yachts, mansions ... Xia ruofei had experienced the life of the top rich people personally this time. He was greatly touched. Although he did not expect to become a rich man in one go or become as rich as MA Xiong, Xia ruofei at least had a direction to work towards and an intuitive understanding of the future. After returning to Sanshan, they quickly cleared the customs through the private jet passageway. When they came out of the special terminal building, a Mercedes – Benz car from Hengfeng group’s office in Sanshan was already waiting there. Xia ruofei asked the driver to send him to San Shan city. He went to the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China to cash out the two checks. One million Yuan was deposited into the company’s account to pay for the next stage of the workers ‘salaries and the rest of the project funds. With this one million Yuan, it was basically enough for last year. Xia ruofei deposited the remaining five million into his card. He was going to buy another batch of Jade before the Spring Festival and was looking forward to the spirit map space being upgraded again. Then, Xia ruofei went to the headquarters of the lingji restaurant to look for Ling Qingxue and gave her the small gift he had bought in Hong Kong. Although a Cartier crystal necklace worth a hundred thousand Yuan was not considered a luxury to the little princess of the lingji cosmetics store, Ling Qingxue was still pleasantly surprised. This was the first time Xia ruofei had bought jewelry for her, so it had a different meaning. Ling Qingxue’s face was red and her eyes were filled with tenderness. She bit her lower lip lightly and looked around to make sure no one was around. Then, she quickly stood on her tiptoes and gave Xia ruofei a light kiss on the cheek. She then ran back to the Ling Ji headquarters building with a red face. Xia ruofei touched his cheek that had been ‘suddenly attacked’ again and grinned. This girl was getting bolder and bolder. She even dared to be so bold in front of her own company ... However, Xia ruofei had originally wanted to invite Ling Qingxue for lunch. However, Ling Qingxue’s sudden attack had naturally ruined his plan for lunch. Xia ruofei lifted his head and looked at the Ling Ji building with a smile. At this moment, his phone rang with a WeChat notification. Xia ruofei took it out and saw that it was a message from Ling Qingxue. “RUO Fei, thank you! I’m very happy ...” “This girl ...” Xia ruofei said with a smile. He didn’t hesitate and immediately sent Ling Qingxue a kiss emoji of a big cat. Ever since he recovered from his terminal illness, Xia ruofei’s attitude towards Ling Qingxue had changed. Although they did not break the ice, Xia ruofei enjoyed this little ambiguous relationship very much. Ling Qingxue quickly replied with an emoji of an iron hammer hitting the head. Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh. Since Ling Qingxue’s lunch plan was ruined, Xia ruofei went to Hu Zi’s mother’s house. It was almost lunch time, so he could freeload a meal there and bring the gifts for Hu Zi’s mother and Lin Qiao. Lin Qiao was on winter vacation, so she stayed at home. Naturally, he was overjoyed to see Xia ruofei. Especially when they saw the gifts that Xia ruofei had brought from Hong Kong, they were so excited that they cheered. Xia ruofei had prepared some nutritional supplements for Hu Zi’s mother, and Lin Qiao had a set of Dior cosmetics and an authentic Disney doll. Lin Qiao was a big girl now, so she could use some cosmetics. As for the doll, Xia ruofei had bought it when he was at Disneyland in Hong Kong with Ma Zhiming’s family. Lin Qiao really liked it and played with it for a long time. She didn’t even put it down when she was eating. After having a heartwarming lunch with Hu Zi’s mother and Lin Qiao, Xia ruofei bade them farewell and left. As there was still some unfinished work on the farm, the construction site was still in a mess. Xia ruofei promised the two that he would come and pick them up a few days before the Spring Festival. After leaving Lin Qiao’s house, Xia ruofei took a taxi back to Taoyuan farm. Ye Lingyun and pang Hao were both busy with their own matters. When they saw Xia ruofei return, they came over to report the progress of their work. The security system was all in place. Ye Lingyun had personally inspected it. Now, the installation and debugging work was going on in an orderly manner. With ye Lingyun watching over the scene, Xia ruofei was very assured. Pang Hao had also managed the finance department’s work in an orderly manner. The fifteen newly recruited workers had all applied for their salary cards and could be paid directly through the bank. At the same time, the communication with the construction team was also done well, and the construction money was paid to the other party in batches and sufficient amounts. Xia ruofei was very satisfied with everyone’s work. He estimated that in another five or six days, the entire Taoyuan farm would be ready for use. In the next few days, Xia ruofei resumed his daily routine. Other than patrolling the construction site, he would read books, surf the internet, go out for a walk with lightning, or take care of all kinds of plants and crops in the space. During this period, he completed another batch of succulent plants cutting. At the same time, he put the matured succulent seedlings on the shelves for sale, earning him another 100000 Yuan. On the third day, Xia ruofei suddenly received a call. “Hello, are you Mr. Xia?” “I’m Xia ruofei, Who are you?” Xia ruofei asked. “Hello, Mr. Xia. I’m the manager of Hengfeng group’s office in Sanshan. My surname is Huang.” The person on the other end of the line said,”Chairman MA of our group’s Board of Directors has something to pass to you. May I know if it’s convenient for you to receive it now?” Xia ruofei knew that the truffles MA Xiong had bought for him had arrived. He quickly said,””I’m free anytime. I’ll send you the address. Come over now!” “Alright!” After Xia ruofei sent the address to manager Huang, about half an hour later, a black SUV with a fierce design drove up to the entrance of the villa ...
