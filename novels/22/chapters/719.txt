Chapter 720: High – end atmosphere, high – end Level_2

“Good, good!” Lin Qiao said happily.

The workload in high school was heavy, and she had no time to deal with other things. After the college entrance examination, Lin Qiao’s pressure was greatly reduced, and everything was fresh to her.

“Boss Feng, Qiao’ er just finished her college entrance examination. She still has to estimate her score and fill in her university application soon ...” Xia ruofei said.

Lin Qiao immediately said,”I’ll be able to estimate my scores in two days after the answers are out. This won’t take too long. I’ll have to fill in the application form next month. It won’t affect my internship with Sister Feng Jing at all!”

Feng Rao smiled and said,”Chairman, since little sister Lin Qiao is so interested, you can let her go with me!” I’ll have free labor!”

“That’s right, I won’t charge you!”Lin Qiao said with a smile.

Xia ruofei could only smile bitterly and said,””Alright! Qiao’ er, you’re not allowed to add to President Feng’s troubles! The mission this time is very tight. ”

“I know! You’re even more naggy than my mom!” Lin Qiao stuck out her tongue and said.

Xia ruofei looked at Lin Qiao affectionately and shook his head with a bitter smile.

Everyone stood up. Xia ruofei put the lychees and cherries in a bag and prepared to bring them back for Hu Zi’s mother to try.

Then, he ordered Cao tieshu to pick more fruits for the company’s employees and workers to try. This was the first batch of fruits produced by the farm, and it could be considered an employee benefit.

Cao tieshu immediately followed Xia ruofei’s instructions and started picking the fruits with his tools. Xia ruofei, Feng Rao, and Lin Qiao started to walk down the mountain.

“Oh right, Chairman, how are you going to price these fruits?” Feng Jing suddenly asked.

......

Xia ruofei thought for a while.”Since we’re going for the high – Quality products, the price can’t be too affordable. It has to be of a higher grade!” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

This was also Xia ruofei’s strategy. In the future, other than the heart – nourishing soup, the products of paradise Corporation would all be high – end and premium products. The price would definitely be much higher than similar products on the market.

On the one hand, the quality of the products was clear, so it was very reasonable to sell them at a higher price. On the other hand, this could also give the audience an established impression that as long as the products of paradise Corporation were produced, they would definitely be high – end products.

As long as this impression was formed, Xia ruofei would have achieved his goal.

Lin Qiao smiled,”brother ruofei, you look like a money – grubber now!” You don’t even need to put on makeup to play the role of a profiteer!”

“What are you saying!” Xia ruofei said angrily,”if I’m a money – grubber, then you’re a little money – grubber. Who asked you to be my sister?”

“Chairman’s strategy is correct,” Feng Jing said with a smile.”Besides, the quality of our fruits is so high. If we sell them at the market price, we’re going against ourselves!”

“Boss Feng, you’re a smart person!” Xia ruofei gave him a thumbs – up, thought for a moment, and said,” 100 yuan per kilogram of lychees and 300 yuan per kilogram of cherries. We’ll set the price for now. Director Feng, if you have time, you can learn about the market situation this year and make adjustments if necessary. ”

“Alright!” Feng Rao said calmly.

Lin Qiao was shocked by the price of the Qingqing cherries. They were very expensive, and it was normal for the wholesale price to be 100 or 200 yuan per kilogram in the initial market. The quality of the peaches from Taoyuan farm was obviously much higher than other cherries on the market, so 300 yuan per kilogram was nothing.

However, wasn’t it too much to sell lychees at 100 per kilogram? In the South, in the years of high yield, unsalable lychees were only two or three Yuan per kilogram. Even the normal price was about 21 to 31 kilograms. Xia ruofei had actually set a unit price of 100 yuan? Who would be stupid enough to buy your expensive lychees?

In contrast, Feng Jing was very calm. This was because the Paradise company’s pricing had always been like this. It was five to ten times higher than the normal products on the market, but the supply still didn’t meet the demand. It was the same for the Paradise vegetables and the tin Kaede bucket. Feng Jing was already used to it.

However, when it came to the specific operations of the company, Lin Qiao knew what to do. Although she was shocked, she didn’t interrupt.

Soon, the three of them arrived at the foot of the mountain. Xia ruofei first drove Feng Jing back to the general office building in the pickup truck, then returned to the villa with Lin Qiao.

They had spent a lot of time picking and deploying the troops in the orchard, so Hu Zi’s mother had already prepared lunch.

Seeing the two of them return, Hu Zi’s mother quickly called them over for dinner.

Xia ruofei placed the bag of fruits on the table and smiled.””Auntie, try the fruits that we produce on our farm first!”

“It’s almost time for dinner, let’s talk after dinner,”Hu Zi’s mother said.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”aunty, fruits are healthy only if you eat them before meals!” Nowadays, many big hotels provide fruit before the meal for banquets. ”

Lin Qiao also said,”yeah!” Mom, just have a taste! Let me tell you ... Ruofei-GE’s fruits are really delicious!”

“You ate a lot in the orchard, didn’t you?” asked Hu ‘Zi’s mother. Don’t be unable to eat later!”

Lin Qiao stuck out her tongue mischievously and laughed in embarrassment.

However, under the persuasion of the two, Hu Zi’s mother still took a few lychees and cherries to try.

“These lychees are so sweet!” Hu ‘Zi’s mother looked surprised.”The cherries are delicious too! Ruofei, I didn’t expect that your farm could grow such good fruits ...”
