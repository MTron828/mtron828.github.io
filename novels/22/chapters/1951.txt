Xia ruofei paused for a moment. After everyone’s attention was on him, he smiled and said,””Tomorrow, our company will be holding a special auction in Hong Kong. Many of paradise corporation’s products will be up for auction, including the best truffles, one – headed abalones, Cordyceps, wild ginseng, and so on. This auction will be hosted by Hong Kong’s Hengfeng group, and so far, we have received more than 300 million Hong Kong dollars as the auction deposit. Some of the Super – rich in Europe and the United States, as well as the managers of world – famous Michelin star restaurants, have arrived in Hong Kong in advance. This will be the first time our company will auction off a series of high – end products!”

There was a commotion among the reporters. Everyone was more concerned about the news in the mainland. The peach blossom company’s product auction in Hong Kong had been hyping up for some time, but the ordinary people in the mainland, including these reporters, were not aware of this news.

Some of the high – end auctions in Hong Kong were very well – known in the world. It was quite impressive for a company from mainland China to hold a special auction in Hong Kong, and the deposit of the auction alone was more than 300 million Hong Kong dollars.

No one suspected that Xia ruofei had given a false number because the news of the auction was not a secret. Previously, no one had paid attention to it. Now that they knew the news, they could just go to the Hengfeng auction house’s official website to check.

Moreover, the speed of the mobile internet was very fast these days. Basically, such high – end auctions would have a live video broadcast of the entire process. The number of rich people attending and the approximate number of people attending could be roughly calculated through the live broadcast.

Hence, there was no point in Xia ruofei making a false number as it would be exposed very quickly.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”that’s why, of course, we won’t shift all our focus to the production of the jaded skin cream just because it’s selling like hotcakes.” The company’s strategy is to go for the high – end and premium route. In the future, our company’s product line will become richer and richer, and the fields we will be involved in will also become wider and wider. ”

After Xia ruofei answered this question, the reporters immediately got excited and couldn’t wait to continue asking questions.

Wu Liqian quickly appointed another reporter.

The next few reporters asked Xia ruofei questions one after another. Many of them were about the details of the auction.

Zeng jianzhang didn’t feel unhappy about being ignored. On the contrary, he was secretly relieved.

The female reporter’s question just now had made him sweat a little. Time was short, and the answers to these questions were not prepared in advance. If he was not careful, he would say the wrong thing and then be magnified by the media infinitely.

Now that everyone’s attention was on the auction that Xia ruofei had mentioned, he felt much more relaxed.

Zeng jianzhang even secretly thanked Xia ruofei. He felt that Xia ruofei had chosen to reveal the news of the auction at this time to help him divert the reporters ‘attention.

After Xia ruofei had answered about four to five questions, Wu Liqian said,””Thank you for your questions, reporters. Because of time constraints, President Xia has to fly to Hong Kong to attend the auction, so today’s Q & A session will end here. Thank you!”

After the press conference ended, the reporters didn’t want to leave. They all gathered around the podium, hoping to continue asking Xia ruofei questions. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Usually, after a press conference, the spokesperson would be willing to answer questions from the reporters. However, Xia ruofei was in a hurry today, so he had to separate the crowd and said,””I’m sorry! I’m sorry! We have to rush to the airport immediately. If you want to know more, you can contact our company’s marketing department or directly contact the Hengfeng auction house! Thank you, everyone ...”

Finally, they returned to the lounge next to the conference room. Xia ruofei wiped his sweat and said,””The reporters are so enthusiastic ...”

Zeng jianzhang laughed and said,”that’s because you have your own traffic, President Xia!” Usually, when we want to release news in our County, many media outlets are not willing to come! This time, when they said it was related to the cooperation with the Paradise Corporation, even though they only contacted each other last night, the media in San Shan all rushed over!”

Xia ruofei didn’t expect Zeng jianzhang to know the internet slang for “built – in data.” He couldn’t help but feel surprised. He smiled and said,”Secretary Zeng, you’re too kind.”

Zeng jianzhang asked with a smile,”you really don’t want to stay for a meal?” I’ve already asked the comrades from the county party Committee to book a hotel!”

Xia ruofei shook his head.”Secretary Zeng, I didn’t lie to the reporters. We really have to catch a flight to Hong Kong. We even brought our luggage with us.”

Sanshan’s airport was located within the borders of Changping County. Xia ruofei and the rest had planned to go to the airport directly from Changping County after attending the signing ceremony and the press conference. They did not have to make a round trip from the city. Therefore, a few of them who were going to Hong Kong had packed their luggage in advance and placed them in the car.

“Alright then! I won’t keep you!” Zeng jianzhang said readily,”director Xia, I wish your Hong Kong auction a great success!”

“Thank you, Secretary Zeng!” Xia ruofei smiled.”We’ll push on with the pharmaceutical factory project as soon as possible! Of course, we’ll also need help from Changping County for the land acquisition. Otherwise, we won’t be able to proceed with the land leveling and construction. “
