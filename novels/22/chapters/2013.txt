2014 The stormy waves (1)

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. He stood up and said,Ah Yong, take me to my friend’s room!

Yes, Mr. Xia! Ah Yong quickly replied.

Xia ruofei slightly nodded to Lu hai, Lu zhengfeng and the others, saying,You guys discuss, I’ll go rest first!

Mr. Xia, take care! Lui hai and the others stood up to see him off.

Ah Yong brought Xia ruofei to Luo SI’s room on the first floor. Monica had not rested yet and was accompanying Luo Si in the room.

Xia ruofei chatted with the siblings for a while, mainly to let them relax. He told them that it was very safe here and that the Gelman family and the Grasso family would not be able to find her. Even if they did, they would not dare to come in and take her away.

Then, Xia ruofei returned to the room that ah Yong had prepared for him. He took a shower and went to bed.

In the small meeting room upstairs, Lyu zhengfeng looked at Lyu hai,Brother hai, what’s the situation with Mr. Xia

Lui hai said unhappily,you’re asking me Who am I supposed to ask!

Lu zhengfeng’s subordinates also expressed their opinions. They all felt that Xia ruofei’s request was unrealistic and might even put the Hong sect’s Turin branch in danger.

Lui hai waved his hand impatiently,Alright! That’s enough! That’s enough! Everyone, let’s not talk about this for now! I’ll give uncle Yi a call and tell him about the situation here. Let’s see what he’ll do!

Right! Right! That’s right! Lu zhengfeng agreed very much.We still have to find uncle Yi to make a decision on this matter! After all, he was the one who introduced us!

Lui hai nodded slightly. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Then ... Big brother hai! Lu zhengfeng asked again. Are we still going to carry out the plan that Mr. Xia mentioned

Lui hai glared at him,don’t you talk nonsense Since Mr. Xia has spoken, can we not do it Not only did he have to do it, but he also had to do it in detail, in place, and with feasibility! We can’t let Mr. Xia think that we’re being perfunctory, understand

But ... Aren’t you also against this unrealistic idea Lu zhengfeng asked.

Lui hai said with disappointment,Opposing it is one thing, and doing it or not is another. That’s a matter of attitude! Mr. Xia is a distinguished guest that my adopted uncle has personally greeted, do I need to teach you

Lu zhengfeng shrank his neck and said,I know!

You guys are the most familiar with the situation in Turin. You guys should work together! Lui hai stood up,I’ll call uncle Yi!

After that, lui hai got up, pushed open the door and walked out.

He thought about his words a little, then called Li Yifu with his mobile phone.

Li Yifu quickly picked up the phone and asked in a dignified voice,Ah hai, have you seen Mr. Xia

I’ve already received them! Lui hai said hurriedly,Mr. Xia and his two friends are now in our branch in Turin. I’ve settled them down!

We must receive them well! Li Yifu said seriously,no matter what request Mr. Xia has, you must obey it unconditionally!

Lui Hai’s heart skipped a beat. It seemed that this Mr. Xia was more important than he had imagined in his adopted uncle’s heart!

But what happened tonight was related to the survival of the Hong sect’s branch in Turin. Even though Mr. Xia had a high status, lui hai had to report it to Li Yifu.

He took a deep breath and said,Uncle Yi, I was just about to report to you! That ... Mr. Xia suggested ...

Don’t you understand what I’m saying Li Yifu interrupted lui Hai’s words seriously and said in a heavy tone,I’ll emphasize it again! No matter what request Mr. Xia makes, you must obey it unconditionally!

Yes! Uncle, we respect Mr. Xia very much! Lui hai said with a bitter smile,but tonight, he suggested that our branch in Turin attack the biggest Mafia force in Turin! And from what I can see, Mr. Xia wants to destroy this force in one fell swoop!

Then you guys should cooperate! Li Yifu said,do you need me to teach you this

Lui hai didn’t know whether to laugh or cry,uncle, you might not know the situation here ... Turin is a Mafia family. It’s the subordinate force of an elder of the glory Association. If we rashly mobilize our men to deal with the Gelman family, it might lead to a full – scale conflict between the Italy branch of the Hong sect and the glory Association! I’ve asked Mr. Xia about this, but I think he wants us to leave the people in the city to the branch in Turin. However, the branch in Turin is not powerful enough to destroy the Germain family. We might suffer heavy losses and we might not be able to achieve our goal!

Lui hai said all that in one breath and felt relieved. No matter whether Li Yifu would blame him or not Italy he was doing his duty as the boss of the Italian Freemasonry.

In any case, he had the obligation to explain the stakes to Li Yifu.

Li Yifu listened to lui hai quietly and said lightly,Ah hai, that’s all

Lui hai was stunned,that’s all! Uncle, is it convenient for you to tell Mr. Xia that if we want to get rid of the Gelman family, we can think of a plan. Besides, it’s good for us to take out the biggest Mafia group in Turin. We’ll do our best to get this done, but we can’t rush in!
