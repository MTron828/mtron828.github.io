Chapter 1814: Xia ruofei’s gift (1)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei was not surprised that Xu lang had discovered the extraordinariness of the Jade sculpture. Previously, at the headquarters of the lingji F & B, Ling Xiaotian’s good friend, du Qinghong, who was also a well – known Fengshui master, had recognized that it was a ‘magical weapon’ at a glance and was even willing to pay 100 million in cash to buy it.

However, Xia ruofei did not know much about Feng Shui, nor did he know how powerful a ‘magical weapon’ of this level could be. Seeing Xu Lang’s reaction, Xia ruofei knew that his jade carving was extraordinary.

This was just a Guan Yu statue with an ordinary spirit gathering formation carved on it. On the other hand, the bell ring Jade statue that Xia ruofei had given to Ling Xiaotian had a formation that he had deduced many times before he dared to use. In terms of the level of the formation, this Guan Yu statue was obviously not as good as the bell ring Jade statue.

Of course, Xia ruofei had his own reasons for drawing the spirit gathering formation. On one hand, he was running out of time, and the spirit gathering formation was his best formation, so it could be said that he could do it with ease. On the other hand, he also realized that spirit Qi and the world of Feng Shui seemed to be inextricably linked. Xu Lang’s previous judgment that the aura at the Peach Blossom Farm was better than that of the building was mostly because of the spirit Qi, so he simply drew a spirit gathering array.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and smiled.””Uncle Xu, I don’t know much about the magical weapon you’re talking about, but it seems like this Guan Gong jade carving can be used?”

“It’s more than just usable?” Xu lang said excitedly,”with this second master Guan guarding your building, your aura will soon surpass that of the farm! This magic tool can continuously improve the building’s aura, and at the same time dissolve the fiendish Qi. It’s killing two birds with one stone!”

Xia ruofei had a feeling that he was right. Xu lang had said that he was constantly changing his aura. Was this not the characteristic of the spirit gathering array? The longer the spirit gathering array was set up, the more spirit Qi it would gather. Of course, due to the level of the array, when the limit of the array was exceeded, the spirit Qi would still overflow and reach a dynamic balance.

Xia ruofei said happily,”that’s great!” Uncle Xu, can you help me see how to place second master Guan? The position you just mentioned, see if I’m right?”

Xu lang carefully compared the location of the intersection of the two rivers in the distance, then made some minor adjustments to the Guan Gong jade carving. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

He did not know if it was a psychological factor, but when Xu lang finally got into position, Xia ruofei really felt that the whole environment was more comfortable and his emotions became calmer.

He had once personally operated the nine rotations heaven and earth formation. At that time, ordinary people would not be able to see any difference when the yin Qi filled the air. However, it would inexplicably produce some negative emotions. Perhaps the evil Qi that Xu lang mentioned had a similar effect?

Xia ruofei had never dared to underestimate the metaphysics of Feng Shui, nor did he dare to come to a conclusion so easily. He had even personally witnessed such a ridiculous thing as cultivation. How could a theory that had been passed down for so many years be denied by simple feudal superstition?

No matter what, this was Xia ruofei’s first time experiencing the effects of Feng Shui metaphysics. It was just a slight adjustment of position but it could change the atmosphere of the entire office. It was quite magical.

Of course, only Xia ruofei, who had a high level of spiritual power, could detect this subtle change. Feng Rao and Dong Yun did not feel it.

After Xu lang adjusted Guan Yu’s position, he smiled and said,””Mr. Xia, this second master Guan is very precious. I suggest you add some anti – Theft measures, such as adding a bulletproof glass cover on the outside, setting up alarms and so on. Don’t worry, as long as the bulletproof glass is transparent enough, it won’t affect its ability to change the aura and dispel evil Qi.”

In fact, Xu lang had a measure of the value of the Jade statue in his heart, and his judgment was similar to du Qinghong ‘S. He believed that the Jade statue was worth at least hundreds of millions of Chinese dollars.

However, he didn’t say it out loud because other than Xia ruofei, Feng Jing and Dong Yun were also there. Although the two beautiful executives were from Xia ruofei’s company, it was inevitable that they would be tempted by money. If they had any evil intentions, he would be doing something bad with good intentions.

Xia ruofei accepted her advice and smiled.””Thank you for your reminder, uncle Xu!”

“CEO Feng,” he said to Feng Rao,”tell Lei Hu to take charge of this matter. Contact the best security equipment Company and have them custom – make a set of protective equipment for this Guan Gong Jade!”

“Alright!” Feng ke said.

In fact, no matter how good the anti – Theft equipment was, it was not foolproof. According to Xia ruofei’s idea, he did not need any alarms or bulletproof glass covers. He only needed to set up a few small protective arrays around it. Even if it could not stop real cultivators for long, it was more than enough to deal with thieves. Even the thieves in the movies would not be able to steal the Jade statue under the protection of the protective arrays as long as they were not cultivators.

In the eyes of true cultivators, even if this Jade statue was very precious, it was not enough for them to take such a risk. As long as they saw the protective array, they would know that the owner of this Jade statue was also a cultivator and would most likely retreat. After all, there was no need to risk their lives for an ordinary spirit gathering array.
