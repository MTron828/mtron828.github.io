Lui hai said,”there are no obvious movements against us for the time being. The Honorable elder of the German family sent people to Duling city and checked the German Manor that had been blown to ruins. But he said nothing and went back to Sicili Island.”

“We still have to be wary of their sudden attacks.” Xia ruofei said,”these Mafia groups are cruel and merciless. They would definitely not remain silent after suffering a loss.”

“Mr. Xia, we didn’t ask for help from other regions in Turin. This is the power struggle in Turin. The glory society won’t dare to take the risk of a full – scale conflict.” Lui hai said.

“A full – scale conflict is not worth it for them. It can be said that they will hurt others and hurt themselves. I don’t think they are crazy to this extent.” Xia ruofei said,”but the family they were protecting was destroyed just like that. They can’t just leave it at that, right? Maybe they don’t dare to launch a large – scale attack on the Freemasons, but what if they only target some of the key figures in the Italy Freemasons?”

Xia ruofei glanced at Lu hai and Lu zhengfeng, saying,””For example, the two of you. You can’t possibly be under heavy protection forever, right? It’s impossible to stay at home forever, right? By then, they only need one sniper bullet. Bang!”

Lui hai and lui zhengfeng couldn’t help but shiver. What Xia ruofei said was totally possible.

The other core members of the Hong sect’s branch in Turin also looked at each other. If the glory Association really wanted to take revenge, they would be the first targets.

Xia ruofei smiled.”It’s also difficult to find evidence for such an assassination. By then, would the Hong sect take the risk of mutual destruction to launch a full – scale attack on the glory Association?” Besides, even if the Hong sect gathered all their forces and destroyed the glory Association, what’s the point if you’re all dead?”

Lui hai said,”Mr. Xia, we have considered this possibility. In fact, we have been very careful since we exterminated the Gelman family. We never go out alone. We always bring many people to protect us.”

“Mr. Xia,” Lu zhengfeng said with a smile,”we’ve been living a life of bloodshed. If we really die under a sniper rifle, that’s our fate!”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”It’s good that you’re on guard. I’m afraid that you don’t take it seriously and go to see the King of Hell without knowing it ... Speaking of which, this is Europe. The King of Hell might not be able to control this place!” You guys probably won’t be able to see God, so let’s see if you can see Satan!” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Lyu zhengfeng, Lyu hai and the others all laughed.

Indeed, they did not take life and death too seriously. After all, in the underworld, even without the incident with the Gelman family, they had made many enemies over the years. There were many people who wanted to tear them into pieces! Isn’t he still alive and well now?

He just had to be careful. If he really fell for it, it was his fate. He couldn’t blame anyone else.

Xia ruofei smiled.”You guys did this to help me. That’s why I can’t do anything. After all, you’re all my adopted husband’s disciples.”

Hearing Xia ruofei’s words, Lyu hai and the others couldn’t help but stare. They knew that this Mr. Xia was of noble status, but seeing him call Li Yifu’s name so naturally and as if it was only natural, they couldn’t help feeling a surge of emotions.

Li Yifu’s position in the Hong sect was very high. Even the leader of the Hong sect respected him. He was also one of the leaders of the Hong sect. Judging from Mr. Xia’s tone, he was at least on the same level as Li Yifu, and his status was even slightly higher than Li Yifu ‘s. How could this not be shocking?

Xia ruofei smiled and looked around at the people in the meeting room. He took out a few jade pendants from his bag and said,””Come and get it! One for each person, everyone who sees it gets a share!”

Lui hai looked at the jade pendant on the table curiously. The design of the jade pendant looked very ordinary and the Jade used was not the rare Imperial Green, but just average.

Why did Mr. Xia give each of us a jade pendant? Lui hai muttered in his heart.

“What are you doing?” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”come and get it! Do you want me to deliver them to you one by one?”

“I wouldn’t dare!” Lui hai said hurriedly. He walked to Xia ruofei first and picked up a jade pendant,””Thank you for your reward, Mr. Xia!”

No matter if the Jade was valuable or not, Xia ruofei’s status was there. He had to be grateful for the gift from the bottom of his heart. Even if it was a screw, it was still giving him face!

When Lu zhengfeng and the others saw this, they followed suit and walked over one by one, each holding a jade pendant.

Xia ruofei smiled as he watched everyone take out a jade pendant. Then, he glanced at the table and said,””Yo! There was one more! That’s just nice ...”

Then, Xia ruofei walked to lui hai and asked,””Ah hai, did you bring a gun?”

Lui hai was confused by Xia ruofei’s thinking. They had just finished talking about the potential threat of the glory society, and then he changed the topic without any warning. He gave everyone a piece of Jade that didn’t look high – end at all, and then immediately asked if he had a gun. These things seemed to have nothing to do with each other, right?
