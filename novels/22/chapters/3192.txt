Of course, Cai Songlin’s consideration was not only about Wang Chi’s reputation. The main thing was that Xia ruofei was still the chairman of the Paradise Corporation. He was worried that if the supercomputer was used to simulate a project related to the Paradise corporation’s trade secrets, there would be some trouble in the future if the secret was leaked.

Therefore, the strict implementation of confidential data processing procedures was also a kind of protection for the Supercomputing Center itself.

After Xia ruofei received the data, he did not stay in the increasingly busy control room. He greeted engineer he and left the control room with Chen Xuan and the rest.

“Brother Xia, where are we going now?” Chen Xuan asked.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”let’s go to the guest house first.” Let’s look at the situation in the data first ...”

If the data was still wrong, Xia ruofei might need to coordinate more supercomputer hours. Even if Wang Chi couldn’t help, if he really needed to use a supercomputer, Xia ruofei would have to ask elder song for help to coordinate more supercomputer hours.

However, no matter what, it was right to stay in new Wu city for now, lest he had to go back and forth later.

Not to mention, Wang Chi was still at the Supercomputing Center. Even if he was going back to Beijing, he couldn’t just leave this old scholar here!

Hence, the group returned to the guest house and went to Xia ruofei’s room.

Xia ruofei didn’t waste any time. He took out his laptop from the spirit map space and connected the hard drive to the computer. He first copied the data onto the computer and then used the decryption software that he had written to uncompress the data.

The text data couldn’t be that big, so it only took about ten seconds to uncompress it.

This time, there was only a text document in the folder.

Xia ruofei took a deep breath and double clicked the document.

Everyone held their breath and stood behind Xia ruofei, staring at the computer screen.

What entered his sight were rows of numbers: “6035502,201335052,635223,72 ...”

Of course, this was not surprising. Xia ruofei had written the algorithm program based on the idea that each floating point represented a number or a group of numbers. After adding various logical judgments, there was only one result.

However, in the face of a pile of numbers, no one could figure out the reason for it.

This was even more difficult to judge than the previous time.

Previously, all that was generated were words. Even though there were 1000 chapters, everyone could make a basic judgment with a glance. At least, they knew if it was meaningless words piled up or if there was really content. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

This time, all the generated were numbers. No one could even judge whether the program was running normally or whether the generated results were correct.

Xia ruofei quickly scanned through all the 3000 sets of numbers. He had already confirmed that there were 3865 sets of numbers in the generated document, which corresponded to Floating Points.

In other words, after a variety of logical judgments, the program believed that each floating point represented a set of numbers, not a single number.

This was in line with Xia ruofei’s prediction. After all, if there were more than 3800 numbers, the number of times they would be repeated would not be that few. With more than 3800 sets of numbers, the probability of repeated numbers would naturally be much lower. This was in line with the current distribution of results.

Xia ruofei smiled.”This is the result. We can only assume that this result is correct. Then, we can analyze the data.” Everyone, please tell me! What do you see from these 3000 sets of numbers?”

Chen Xuan and the others looked at one another with bitter smiles on their faces.

Mu Sheng and Liu Mansha could only barely recognize the Arabic numbers. After all, they were used to using “one” to represent ” 1″ most of the time. Although it was not difficult to master these tadpole – like Arabic numbers, it still took time to get used to them.

“Just say what you have to say! Everyone, let’s brainstorm!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I don’t know why either, so I wanted to ask everyone’s thoughts. Who knows, someone might have a flash of inspiration and find a breakthrough! Weiwei, Qingxue, just tell us what you found. Brother Jianfei and miss Xin ‘er, don’t be embarrassed. You can tell us anything you found for everyone’s reference!”

Yu Xin ‘er’s face turned slightly red. She glanced at her master.

Liu Mansha said with a smile,”Xin ‘er, just say what you have to say!” Don’t be nervous, no one will blame you if you say something wrong!”

Now that everyone had no ideas, it was natural to encourage everyone to speak up. Even if they said something wrong, it would not matter. Perhaps it could give others some inspiration.

Yu Xin ‘er nodded and said in a soft voice,””I ... Looked at these numbers and found that there were only 0 to 7. I didn’t see 8 or 9! I don’t know if this is a special place ...”

Yu Xin ‘er was still unconfident and lowered her head shyly after she finished speaking.

Xia ruofei looked at the document filled with numbers on the computer screen. After a quick glance, he immediately smiled and said,””Miss Xin ‘er, you’re very good! This was definitely a discovery! To be more precise, there were only positive and negative 1 to 7, and 0. There were no positive and negative 8 or 9! Miss Xin ‘er has made a good start! Let’s analyze again and see if there’s anything different about these numbers!”

After being praised by Xia ruofei, Yu Xin ‘er’s face blushed and she lowered her head even more.

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue looked at each other, then at the same time, they looked at Xia ruofei with a faint smile.

Xia ruofei did not notice the murderous look in his two close female friends ‘eyes. He was still staring at the computer screen and mumbled to himself,””The length of each group of numbers is not constant, and there is no fixed pattern. The ratio of positive and negative values ...”

“Brother Xia, is it possible that there’s some sort of special encryption method?” Chen Xuan asked.

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly.”If it’s just a simple password ... It would require a strong foundation in mathematics. Without enough samples, it would be difficult to crack it with just this document!”

At this point, Xia ruofei paused for a moment and said,””I don’t think it’s possible ... In fact, to translate the floating point pattern into a combination of numbers without the help of a supercomputer is already hell – Level difficulty. If this combination of numbers is still encrypted, and there is no way to crack it, it can only mean one thing ...”

Everyone turned to look at Xia ruofei.

“This means that the person who made these five tokens didn’t want to be able to decipher the secret in them!” Xia ruofei said.

Everyone could not help but laugh.

Xia ruofei continued,”seniors, brother Chen, this token is so exquisitely designed. The floating patterns on it are also very mysterious. I think that this token, which took so much effort to make, must be meant to leave some important information. If it’s too difficult to decipher, or even beyond the scope of human labor, the possibility of this happening is not very high!”

Mu Sheng stroked his beard and smiled. He nodded and said,””I agree with little brother Xia’s words. I think we shouldn’t think too much about it and focus on finding out if there are any patterns in these numbers! Perhaps it’s just as little brother Xia said, everything isn’t that complicated!”

“Mm! We don’t need to complicate a simple problem!” Chen Xuan nodded his head and said,”let’s try to find a pattern first. If it really doesn’t work, we’ll consider a more complicated plan!”

Everyone started to discuss it. However, other than Yu xiner’s initial discovery that only had numbers 0 to 7 and ” 7 to” 1, and the missing discovery of positive and negative 8 and 9, no one made any particularly exciting discoveries.

At this moment, Song Wei, who had been standing beside Xia ruofei, stared at the numbers on the computer screen and subconsciously started to hum ...
