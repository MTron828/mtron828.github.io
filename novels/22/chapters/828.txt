“Aren’t you talking nonsense?”song Rui said. Have you forgotten where my old man is from?”

Xia ruofei was stunned. He just remembered that elder song’s hometown was in the Ganjiang province. However, he had joined the Army when he was young and had been working in other places. Xia ruofei had looked for song Rui because he vaguely understood that the song family’s territory was in the Ganjiang province. He had forgotten that this was elder song’s hometown.

“So you’re saying that the answer you gave me is yes?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

“I can’t guarantee anything too troublesome, but I can still do most things in the Ganjiang province.” Song Rui said,”don’t keep me in suspense. What’s the matter? Don’t tell me you got some Ganjiang girl pregnant and can’t clean up the mess?”

“I’ll go to hell!” Xia ruofei laughed and scolded,”I’m talking business! Since you’re so confident, then you have to help me do this well! Otherwise, don’t blame me for not acknowledging you as my brother!”

Seeing that Xia ruofei was so serious, song Rui stopped teasing him and said seriously,””You say it! As long as it’s not murder, arson, or drug trafficking, I’ll help you settle it!”

Xia ruofei pouted and said,”do I look like the kind of person who would commit crimes?”

Then, Xia ruofei didn’t keep song Rui in suspense anymore. He told him the whole story from the beginning. Except for squad leader Luo’s unit number and the specific reason for his death, which had to be kept secret, Xia ruofei told song Rui everything in detail.

Song Rui was from a family of generals and had special feelings for the Army. When he heard that someone dared to defame a martyr in such a despicable way, he couldn’t help but curse.”Fuck his Grandpa! This grandson is not human!”

Then, song Rui asked without hesitation,””Ruofei, what do you want to do about this? How big was it going to be? Just give me the word, and I’ll use all my connections to do it! If even I can’t do it, I’ll go and beg my dad and Grandpa. I’ll make sure you’re satisfied!”

Xia ruofei was touched when he heard that. He said,””Just two points. First, make all the deliberately edited information about squad leader Luo that has been posted online disappear; Second, this scumbag reporter ...”

At this point, Xia ruofei paused, looked at Huang Zhenyu, and asked,””Hey, what’s your name?”

Huang Zhenyu snorted coldly and glared at Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei did not wait for his reply and continued,””I don’t know his name, but he’s from the provincial entertainment channel. You’ll find out once you get your people to check. I want him to lose all his reputation and suffer a fate worse than death!”

Song Rui replied without hesitation,”OK!” I’ll immediately get the head of the publicity department of the Ganjiang Provincial Party Committee to personally handle this matter!”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and added,””By the way, this grandson went to class monitor Luo’s house to make trouble this morning, so I gave him a little punishment and taught him how to behave! If you have any leaders you are familiar with in the political and legal department, you should also give them a call. Don’t leave any traces behind!”

“Understood!” Song Rui said. Then, he asked with a smile,”ruofei, what’s the level of your ‘small punishment’?”

Xia ruofei replied indifferently,”I didn’t really hit him. I just took out a tooth and broke his legs. I’m already very kind with my bad temper!”

Song Rui was stunned for a moment before he muttered,””Fuck! I have to say, you F * cking ... Well done!”
