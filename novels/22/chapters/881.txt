Yang Jianren quickly waved his hand.”No, no... Director Cao, then ... Then I won’t disturb you any longer. I’ll take my leave first ...”

Guangzhi Cao didn’t look at yang Jianren. He just gave a faint “hmm” and turned to Xia ruofei.

Yang Jianren was very regretful. He hesitated and said to Xia ruofei,””Young ... Young master Xia, I’m sorry if I offended you just now. I’m really sorry. I’ll apologize to you with a drink next time ...”

In fact, Xia ruofei had not paid any attention to yang Jianren from the beginning. At first, yang Jianren had been sarcastic, but Xia ruofei had been sitting on the sofa with an indifferent face.

At that time, yang Jianren had subconsciously thought that Xia ruofei was guilty, so he had looked down on him.

Now that he thought about it, she didn’t put him in her eyes at all and was just sitting there watching the show!

Yang Jianren couldn’t help but smile bitterly to himself. His performance of jumping up and down just now seemed no different from a Dancing Clown.

He looked at Xia ruofei nervously, hoping that Xia ruofei would respond to him if he took the initiative to give in.

However, Xia ruofei didn’t seem to hear him. He laughed and said to Guangzhi Cao,””Brother Cao, I heard that you civil servants are not allowed to drink alcohol for eight hours. Don’t make a mistake just because you want to eat with me!”

“The Secretary gave me half a day off today,” Guangzhi Cao laughed.”I’ll continue my research tomorrow!” So, I’m sure it’s not a problem to drink with you ...” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Guangzhi Cao was all smiles when he said that, but he was sighing in his heart. Song Qiming had some private matters to deal with at home today. It seemed like an important guest had come to visit, so he gave Guangzhi a half – day off.

If Guangzhi Cao had been the Secretary of a leader for a few years, he would have asked the Secretary to help him with such private matters. This meant that song Qiming didn’t really treat Guangzhi Cao as someone close to him.

Guangzhi Cao also had a sense of crisis. Of course, he knew that this kind of thing couldn’t be rushed. Only by working hard to show that he was worthy of the Secretary’s trust would the Secretary slowly treat him as one of his own.

For example, meeting Xia ruofei by chance today was a very good opportunity.

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Brother Cao, I won’t stand on ceremony then. Today, I’ve formed an alliance with Mayor he. We won’t stop until we’ve gotten you drunk!”

He Feng quickly waved his hand and said with a smile,””You two have a fair fight. I’ll be the judge ...”

While Xia ruofei and the other two were chatting happily, yang Jianren, who had been ignored, felt awkward.

He didn’t know whether to leave or stay.

After hesitating for a long time, yang Jianren could only force himself to say to Xia ruofei,””Young master Xia, I won’t disturb you and chief Cao anymore. You two take your time ...”

After he finished speaking, he did not continue to invite ridicule. He bowed slightly and then left the Lotus pond moonlight private room.

He Dong and the other lackeys naturally didn’t dare to make a sound as they followed yang Jianren and left the private room dejectedly.

At this moment, President Zheng of the West River Moon Club came forward and said,””President Xia, director Cao, District head he, please wait for a moment. I’ll arrange for the kitchen to prepare the dishes immediately!”

“Sorry to trouble you, President Zheng,” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“President Zheng, please add a few more dishes to my previous menu.” He Feng said,”also, give me a few bottles of Drunken Eight Immortals wine.”

Because of their cooperation with the Paradise Corporation, the West River Moon Club had a stable supply of wine. The supply of Drunken Eight Immortals wine, which was in high demand outside, was also quite sufficient.

“Alright, alright.” President Zheng said,”don’t worry. I will definitely make the proper arrangements.”

After that, President Zheng went down to make the arrangements.

Only Xia ruofei and the other two were left in the boisterous room.

Just then, Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”brother Cao, who was that clown just now?” It’s so noisy!”

Guangzhi Cao smiled bitterly.”Brother Xia, Yang Jianren’s father, yang Jinsheng, is the executive Vice Minister of the municipal organization Department. This kid opened his own trading company and made quite a lot of money by relying on his father’s connections to buy low and sell high ...”

Xia ruofei pouted. He didn’t care about such a low – Class rich kid.

Guangzhi Cao noticed Xia ruofei’s disapproving expression and quickly explained,””Brother Xia, I worked in the organization Department before I joined the Secretary Department. Director yang is my old leader. Yang Jianren has invited me several times these days. I only agreed to come because I was too embarrassed to refuse. I didn’t expect him to do this. I’m really sorry ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”brother Cao, why are you apologizing to me?” This matter has nothing to do with you!”

Guangzhi Cao said,”brother Xia, Yang Jianren has always had a smooth life since he was a child. He’s used to being arrogant and domineering. He doesn’t know the immensity of heaven and earth. He offended you today. I’ll teach him a good lesson later!”

Xia ruofei smiled faintly and said,”brother Cao, I’m not that petty. It’s not worth it to know this kind of person.” But ...”

Xia ruofei hesitated. He had wanted to give Guangzhi Cao a few words of advice, but even though they called each other brothers, they had just met. It might not be a good thing to have a deep conversation with strangers.

Hearing this, Guangzhi Cao said sincerely,”Brother Xia, if you have anything to say, you can just say it. To be honest, I’ve been trembling with fear these days, afraid that I’ll have a mental breakdown soon ...”
