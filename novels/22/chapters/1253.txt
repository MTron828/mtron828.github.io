Chapter 1254: Old Blake (1)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei was stunned. He could hear that MA Xiong was in a difficult position.

After a moment of silence, Xia ruofei smiled and said,””Mr. MA, I know this person?”

“You don’t know him, but you can say that they have a connection!” MA Xiong said with a bitter smile.

Xia ruofei suddenly understood something. He smiled and said,””Mr. MA, your friend is French, right?”

Since MA Xiong had called, he did not plan to hide it from Xia ruofei. He immediately said,””Xia Sheng is really quick – witted! Old Blake just arrived in Hong Kong this morning. He asked me to do a job and he wants to talk to you. ”

With Xia ruofei’s personality, he would definitely not agree to this meeting. Blake’s restaurant chain had a huge influence in the Western food industry, but it had nothing to do with Xia ruofei. He did not need to do business with Blake’s group at all.

Even Xia ruofei was not afraid that Blake Corporation would ban Youyou. How could they ban the top – grade truffle that was sold at the auction yesterday? There were plenty of people who would buy it.

However, since MA Xiong had made this call, it meant that he had a certain relationship with Blake’s group, or Blake’s group had found someone who could influence MA Xiong to pass on the message. Wasn’t it also because of this that Blake’s incident at the beginning of the year was left unsettled?

MA Xiong had treated Xia ruofei well and he did not want to put MA Xiong in a difficult position because of this. Hence, he thought for a while and nodded,””It’s nothing to meet him. Mr. MA, you can arrange it!”

“Thank you, Xia Sheng!” MA Xiong said happily.

After hanging up the phone, Xia ruofei’s lips twitched. He did not take the matter to heart.

In the morning, Feng Rao and the rest completed their mission and returned to the three mountains.

Xia ruofei asked Ma Zhiming for a car to send them to the airport. Xia ruofei also personally followed the car to send them to the airport, giving Feng Jing enough face.

At noon, in the revolving restaurant on the top floor of Hengfeng Jiahua Hotel.

Xia ruofei was accompanied by MA Xiong to one of the private rooms.

As soon as Xia ruofei entered the room, he saw Blake sitting on his seat with a gloomy face. There was an old man with silver hair beside him. The old man looked familiar. It seemed like the black family’s genes were quite strong.

The old man was wearing a well – tailored suit, and his silver hair was neatly combed. Although his face was full of wrinkles, his eyes were bright and full of spirit, not at all cloudy like an old man.

“Horse! My friend!” Old Blake stood up and gave MA Xiong a warm hug.”Thank you very much for your help!” He said. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Old Blake, you guys talk!” MA Xiong said indifferently. I won’t disturb you any longer. However, Xia Sheng is my most distinguished guest, and I don’t want him to feel unhappy. ”

“Understood!” Old Blake said with a smile.

MA Xiong nodded at Xia ruofei, closed the door, and left.

“Mr. Xia, please sit!” Old Blake said with an elegant smile.

Xia ruofei glanced at Blake, then pulled out a chair and sat down.

“Mr. Blake, I heard that you flew all the way here from France. You didn’t just come here to see me, did you?” Xia ruofei asked with a faint smile.

Old Blake was still smiling. He said,”Mr. Xia, please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Jason. Blake is the chairman of the black Restaurant chain in France, and also the patriarch of the black family. ”

“I’ve long heard of your great name!” Xia ruofei said indifferently.

“Mr. Xia, you’re too kind.” Old Blake said,”I heard that my good – for – nothing grandson and Mr. Xia had some unpleasant things. I felt very uneasy, so I flew here from France this morning, hoping to resolve the misunderstanding between you two.”

Xia ruofei had a teasing smile on his face the whole time. He listened to old Blake quietly without saying anything.

Old Blake’s eyes flickered for a moment, then he looked at Blake with his sharp eyes and said in a deep voice,””George! Why aren’t you apologizing to Mr. Xia?”

Old Blake was French, but he had been speaking in English. He even spoke to his grandson in English. Obviously, he was considering Xia ruofei’s feelings.

He probably didn’t know Chinese, or he would have used it to communicate.

Xia ruofei looked at Blake indifferently.

Blake’s face was so dark that it was scary. There were some red marks on his cheeks. Obviously, old Blake had slapped Xia ruofei before he came in.

Blake couldn’t help but shiver when his grandfather looked at him.

Old Blake was the head of the whole family. He had supreme authority in the group and within the family. It could even be said that he had the power to decide the life and Death of the Family. Since he was a child, Blake had left an indelible impression in his heart. He respected and feared his grandfather.

“M – Mr. Xia, I’m sorry ...” Although Blake was unwilling, he did not dare to go against old Blake’s wishes. He gritted his teeth and apologized to Xia ruofei.

Before Xia ruofei could say anything, old Blake said loudly,”George, speak louder! Didn’t you eat? Also, an apology must be sincere. Stand up!”

Blake was so scared that he stood up from his seat.
