2644 Going to the green cloud Island again (2)

After that, old man Liu said,””Xia, since you’re done here, you can go to the agate map with Kuan. Hurry up with the transfer of ownership of the island, or I’ll keep thinking about it!” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Old master Liu’s words were exactly what Xia ruofei was thinking. He was worried that a long delay would cause more problems! It was because the cyan Cloud Island was too important and precious to him.

Besides, this was an agreement between the two parties, so Xia ruofei did not decline. He nodded and said,””Alright! Today, you should take a pill first. I’ll stay and observe your situation. We’ll leave tomorrow morning! I’ll inform my commercial plane crew in a moment and ask them to apply for a route in advance and make the relevant preparations!”

“I won’t be using your plane this time!” Old man Liu waved his hand. I heard from Kuan that you went to Qingyun island two days ago, and because of the distance, you stayed in Australia for a while. So this time, I asked Kuan to contact a Chartered plane, which is an Airbus A350. Its range is much further than your Gulfstream, and it’s enough for you to fly directly from Beijing to Qingyun Island. ”

It was a bit ironic. Although it was only an island country in the South Pacific Ocean, it was at least a country. However, many of its infrastructure facilities were not as good as those of blue cloud Island, including the airport.

The airport in ponautu was very small, and the runway was very short. A wide – body passenger plane like the A350 could not land at all. On the other hand, although the three – thousand – meter runway on Qingyun Island was considered a short runway for the A350, it still met the take – off and landing standards.

Therefore, even if they rented an A350, they still needed to land on Qingyun Island and then take a helicopter to evates Island, where the capital of the Carnelian Empire was located.

“Actually, it’s not too much trouble to refuel after landing. It won’t take long.” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“We’ve already prepared the plane,” old man Liu said.”Let your crew rest in Beijing for a few more days!”

“Alright! We’ll follow your arrangements!” Xia ruofei said readily.

If it were an ordinary person, they might have some doubts after hearing this arrangement and worry that the Liu family would do something to the plane.

However, Xia ruofei did not need to worry about this. Even if the plane crashed, Xia ruofei had enough trump cards to save his life.

Furthermore, Xia ruofei knew that the Liu family was not that crazy. Besides, Liu Kuan would be with Xia ruofei the entire time. Old master Liu would not sacrifice a loyal servant who had been with him for decades just to get rid of Xia ruofei.

……

Xia ruofei stayed in the Liu family’s residence for the entire day.

After lunch, Xia ruofei asked the medical staff to give a pill to elder Liu.

Liu Qunfeng was really on guard. He set up the next room like an iron bucket array. Even when the medical staff went to get the medicine, there were several people watching them. Their main task was to prevent the medical staff from touching the pills with their hands.

After going through a strict process, the medical staff could only take out a pill.

After taking the medicine, Xia ruofei immediately gave old man Liu a thorough examination.

Of course, this was mostly routine, because he didn’t need to check at all. After taking the pill this time, the tumor cells in elder Liu’s body would be greatly suppressed, and there would be no hope of revival. Taking the pill every day would only suppress the sphere of influence of the tumor cells more and more.

After the examination, Xia ruofei gave a very optimistic conclusion that within three months, elder Liu would definitely recover.

After hearing the news, old man Liu, Liu Qunfeng, and Liu Kuan were all overjoyed. Liu Kuan even had tears on his face. He had spent most of his life with the Liu family, and old man Liu was his God. He had even made up his mind at one point that if old man Liu were to pass away, he would continue to serve old man Liu as soon as possible after settling his funeral Affairs.

……

The next morning, Xia ruofei and Liu Kuan left the Liu family’s house with the necessary documents.

At the Capital International Airport, Xia ruofei and Liu Kuan entered the airport’s restricted area through the bus passage and were quickly sent to the tarmac where the Airbus A350 was located.

Compared to Xia ruofei’s Gulfstream G650, this Airbus was equivalent to a giant. Standing on the tarmac, one had to look up hard to see the porthole of the plane.

The flight crew lined up next to the ramp, waiting for today’s guests.

Xia ruofei noticed that the Airbus A350 even had a Chinese flag printed on it. This meant that the charter flight this time was rented from China’s Air China. Air China was the only flag – carrying airline in China. Other companies ‘planes did not have a national flag on them.

Xia ruofei and Liu Kuan were warmly welcomed by the flight crew as they walked up the stairs. They took dozens of steps before they reached the cabin door.

The purser behind Xia ruofei hurried to the window and bowed.””Welcome to Air China’s plane rental service! This way, please!”

Xia ruofei and Liu Kuan walked into the cabin. Under the lead of the purser, they went straight to the first – Class area at the front of the plane.

This plane was not specially Chartered for the rich, so the interior of the plane was still like an ordinary civil passenger plane. However, the economy Class was empty. The only two passengers, Xia ruofei and Liu Kuan, naturally sat in the first class.

Xia ruofei and Liu Kuan each took a seat by the window. There was a semi – first – Class seat between them so that they could have as much private space as possible.

There were only two passengers on this charter flight. After Xia ruofei and Li Kuan boarded the plane, the flight attendants and security personnel immediately closed the cabin door, and the pilot in the cockpit began to request for ground control to push them out.

Although there were no written rules, Air China was indeed a special existence in the industry, especially at Beijing International Airport, where it would receive all kinds of preferential treatment.

In addition, the control center also found out that the air China plane was not operating as usual for passengers, but was privately Chartered.

Therefore, the ground soon allowed the A350 to be pushed out and driven.

After a series of complicated calls and confirmations, the plane finally glided slowly to the runway. Then, after a skilled turn and head adjustment operation, the Airbus A350 finally entered the runway. The front landing gear accurately pressed on the white line.

There were countless flights at Beijing International Airport every day, and it was one of the busiest airports in the world. Therefore, the airport administrator would definitely not let this plane stay on the runway to avoid delaying the take – off and landing of other planes.

Just like that, the A350 that Xia ruofei was on took off immediately. Its thrust gradually increased, and the speed of the plane gradually increased. It was difficult to increase the speed at the beginning, but once it accelerated to v1, it was almost impossible to stop the take – off due to the strong inertia.

After the big guy accelerated to the speed of a wheel, it slowly flew off the ground and began to climb.

After a period of climbing, the plane finally entered level – Flight cruise.

In all fairness, the Airbus A350 was much less comfortable than paradise. Moreover, its cruising altitude was not as high as paradise, so it would be a little bumpy during the flight due to the airflow.

However, Xia ruofei did not care much about this. Besides, the conditions in the first – Class cabin were much better than the narrow economy cabin, not to mention the transport aircraft or helicopter that Xia ruofei had taken during his military service.

The Airbus A350’s speed was slightly slower than paradise. The flight took about 15 hours. Xia ruofei had two meals on the plane, laid down his seat, and took a nap. The plane finally landed steadily on the runway of Qingyun Island in the night.
