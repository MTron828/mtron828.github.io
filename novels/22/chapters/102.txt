Chapter 103: I’m really just a vegetable

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be dumbfounded. After a while, he smiled bitterly and said,””No way? What a coincidence! I’m just having a meal and I’m in your territory ...” At this time, a man in a suit and leather shoes hurried over and said,””Manager Xu, Welcome to our shop for inspection and guidance! We would also like to thank the head office for your care and concern for Hongtian restaurant. We have been looking forward to this batch of Taoyuan vegetables! I’ve been looking forward to this day ...” Manager Xu smiled apologetically at Xia ruofei before turning to the man in the suit and said,””Store manager Lin, Taoyuan vegetables are in the car outside. You can have them move to the back kitchen! Also, Mr. Ling told me to check the purchasing records of the other branches. Please get them ready, I still have something to deal with here. ” “Alright, alright!” Branch Manager Lin said hurriedly. He handed it over to the front desk manager and quietly gave a few instructions to have the people below move the vegetables and prepare the accounts. He himself stood somewhat cautiously on the side, urging the head company’s department manager to come to the branch. That was the Imperial envoy! He had to be served carefully. When manager Xu faced Xia ruofei, his facial expression immediately became very gentle and respectful. “Mr. Xia,” she asked,”if I may ask, is this a gathering of friends?” “Oh! It’s our tenth graduation anniversary, so we’re all going to have a meal together. ” Xia ruofei said with a smile. After that, Xia ruofei introduced manager Xu to the students. Manager Xu nodded enthusiastically to everyone. When Xia ruofei’s middle school classmates heard that this B * tch was actually the famous Ling Ji’s F & B procurement department manager, and that the new branch Manager of Hongtian restaurant was also respectful to her, yet she was so polite in front of Xia ruofei, they immediately looked at Xia ruofei in a different light. Liu Hang’s face turned red and white. He did not expect Xia ruofei, who called himself a “vegetable farmer”, to have such a big reputation. Compared to his previous poor performance, he really wanted to find a hole to hide in. “Mr. Xia, when I came in just now, I saw that you two didn’t seem to be happy.” Manager Xu asked,”is there something wrong with the service?” As soon as manager Xu said this, Branch Manager Lin, who was next to him, suddenly became nervous. “It’s nothing. “Xia ruofei smiled faintly. However, the private room we wanted has already been booked in advance. We were just discussing the change of private rooms!” “Oh?” When manager Xu heard this, he immediately turned to manager Lin and said,”manager Lin, prepare the top floor’s Linjiang Pavilion for Mr. Xia and the others immediately!” When Branch Manager Lin heard that, he was stunned for a moment, then said hesitantly,””Manager Xu, Linjiang Pavilion is CEO Ling’s private room. This ...” As it turned out, Ling Xiaotian, who was from the three mountains, had a special liking for min cuisine. In terms of the degree of authentic min cuisine, the large – scale Ling Ji restaurant chain could not be compared to the decades – old Hong Tian restaurant. Therefore, after Ling Xiaotian had acquired Hong Tian restaurant, he had specially ordered people to renovate a large private room on the top floor. This private room was reserved for Ling Xiaotian’s personal use, and was not open for business. So, even though manager Xu had spoken, Branch Manager Lin still felt that it was very difficult for Wanwan. After all, manager Xu was only a department manager at the head office, but the Linjiang Pavilion was the private room of the boss of the company! Manager Xu frowned and said,”what’s wrong with President Ling’s private room?” Mr. Xia was CEO Ling’s esteemed guest, so of course, he had to open the best private room to receive him! Why don’t you ... Give President Ling a call and ask for instructions?” Branch Manager Lin’s forehead was covered in sweat, and he quickly said,””I don’t dare, I don’t dare, I’ll arrange it immediately!” He also secretly scolded himself for being out of his mind. Since manager Xu had already spoken, he would just do as she said. Anyway, if President Ling really wanted to blame someone, she would be the one to take responsibility. But now, the private room had to be opened, and he had offended her for no reason. Manager Xu nodded expressionlessly. Then, he turned to Xia ruofei and smiled.””Mr. Xia, I’m really sorry. The people below don’t know your identity ... I’ve already ordered them to move you to the top floor, Linjiang Pavilion.” Xia ruofei could feel the strange looks from the students around him. He could not help but smile bitterly.”Big sister Xu, there’s no need for that! We don’t have many people, so the Ruyi Pavilion is fine. ” “That won’t do!” Manager Xu said seriously,”if CEO Ling finds out that we have neglected you, I can’t bear the blame ...” “Well ...” Xia ruofei smiled bitterly and turned to Yuan Lili.”Yuan Lili, since manager Xu is so polite, shall we change to another room?” “Sure, let’s take advantage of you!” Yuan Lili nodded with a smile. When Branch Manager Lin heard that, he quickly led the way and led Xia ruofei and the others to the exclusive elevator of the private room in Linjiang Pavilion. They went directly to the top floor. The Linjiang Pavilion private room was located above the auspicious Pavilion and the Ruyi Pavilion. It was as large as the two private rooms combined and was very spacious. Facing the river were two full glass curtains, allowing one to enjoy the 270 – degree view of the river with no dead angle. The luxurious decorations in the room made Xia ruofei’s junior high school classmates feel like they were in a Grand View Garden. A thick white wool carpet covered the entire room, and against the wall was an antique pure oak Museum shelf, on which was a dazzling collection. In front of the shelf was a row of luxurious handmade Netherlands sheepskin couches, and an exquisite tea set was placed on the marble coffee table. On one side of the glass wall, there was a large, luxurious round table. On top of the Round Table, there was a bright Crystal lamp. The hanging ornament swayed gently in the breeze, reflecting a blurred light. The glass window on the curtain wall was half – Open, and as the river Wind blew, the tassel – like gauze curtain gently swayed, making people feel relaxed and happy. Every detail in the private room was done to the extreme. There was clearly a Western luxury and a Chinese classical, but the two completely different styles were harmonious in this place, making people feel that there was no sense of disharmony. Even Liu Hang, who was self – proclaimed to be knowledgeable, could not help but click his tongue when he entered the room. He had been to this restaurant many times, but he had never known that there was such an extremely luxurious room hidden on the top floor. Manager Xu personally made tea for everyone, and store manager Lin became an errand boy, directing the youngest and prettiest waitresses in the store to get busy. After chatting for a while, everyone went to the Round Table and took their seats. Manager Xu also tactfully took his leave. The students were all curious about Xia ruofei. Yuan Lili took the lead and asked with a smile,””Xia ruofei, we’re all thanks to you today! This was definitely the treatment of a top VIP! Tell me the truth, what do you do? Why does the famous Ling Ji restaurant have to be so polite to you?” “Yes, yes, yes, if you dare to hide anything, I’ll make sure you die without a burial ground!” Pang Hao also joined in the fun, the fat on his face jiggling as he laughed, looking very comical. The other students also echoed. Only Liu Hang lowered his head slightly, and his face was frighteningly gloomy. Xia ruofei forced a smile and said,”didn’t I already tell everyone?” Actually, I’m just a vegetable farmer ...” “Tsk! Who would believe that?” Pang Hao shouted,”students, do you believe me?” “I don’t believe it!” Xia ruofei’s classmates all laughed. At this moment, the restaurant’s Branch Manager Lin personally came in with a dish. He had a warm smile on his face, but there was a heartache in his eyes that could not be hidden, making his smile seem a little bitter ...Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m
