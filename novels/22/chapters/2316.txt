After arriving at the outpatient building, Xia ruofei walked into the elevator.

However, he didn’t go straight to the 16th floor. Instead, he took the elevator to the 14th floor and walked out. Then, he turned to the emergency escape stairs and began to climb up.

Just as he reached the 15th floor, Xia ruofei’s expression changed slightly. He quickened his pace. His spiritual power was locked onto the man in gray. Just now, he realized that the man in gray was leaving his previous position quickly.

He sensed danger just like that? Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows.

He thought to himself,”it seems that this group of people are not simple!”

Only those who had gone through countless trials of life and death would have an almost instinctive sense of danger.

Xia ruofei was sure that he did not reveal any flaws throughout the entire process. The man in gray or his accomplices would not have noticed him in advance. The only possibility was that the man in gray felt uneasy. Although he was not clear about the situation, he knew that danger was approaching, so he retreated decisively.

Xia ruofei had this feeling a lot too. It was this intuition that had saved him on the battlefield several times. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Could it be that the other party was also a Special Forces soldier who had experienced the test of life and death? Xia ruofei suddenly had a thought.

“Who did uncle song offend?” Xia ruofei mumbled to himself and continued,”I don’t care who you are. Since I’ve set my eyes on you, don’t even think about running away!”

Although his mind was racing, Xia ruofei’s pace never slowed down. In fact, it got faster and faster. In the blink of an eye, he had climbed to the 16th floor.

However, he didn’t rush out directly. Instead, he continued to climb up.

Because the man in gray had not escaped his psychic energy, he found that the man in gray had come to the emergency escape passage on the other side and was running up the stairs, so he simply chased up from this side.

Xia ruofei’s speed was much faster than the man in gray. He used his spiritual power to lock onto the man in gray from a distance as he ran up the stairs at full speed. In a short while, he arrived at a door that led to the roof.

For the sake of safety, the door was locked, and it was a very thick iron lock.

Xia ruofei did not hesitate. He reached out and grabbed the iron lock. With a slight breath of genuine Qi, he pulled the iron lock off as if it was a dead branch.

He believed that the lock on the other side of the roof must have been destroyed in advance.

Just as he had expected, the man in gray also did not stop and went straight to the rooftop.

The corners of Xia ruofei’s mouth curved up slightly. He pushed open the door and walked up to the rooftop.

On the other side of the stairs, the man in gray was running up the stairs as he pressed the headset hidden in his ear. He said in a hurry,””All positions, evacuate immediately! Number 6, go to position B to meet me!”

This was obviously a well – trained team. No one said a word of nonsense, and no one asked why they were retreating. Soon, the man in gray’s headset gave a crisp reply.

” 6, I understand!”

“Number 3 received!”

“No. 2 received!”

“No. 5 is retreating!”

The man in gray was slightly out of breath as he rushed to the door of the rooftop.

He reached out his hand and twisted it. The door lock that had been opened and hung on the door in advance was immediately twisted open.

The man in gray opened the iron latch, opened the door to the rooftop, and flashed out.

He had obviously checked out the location before. After arriving at the rooftop, he rushed in one direction without any hesitation.

But ...

The man in gray had only run two steps before he came to a sudden stop.

A look of disbelief appeared on his face as he stared straight ahead.

On the edge of the rooftop opposite him stood a young man with a harmless smile on his face.

The man in gray didn’t know this young man, but a huge warning sign welled up in his heart, as if this young man was quite dangerous.

The one who had come here in advance to bet on the gray – robed man’s path was naturally Xia ruofei, who had already changed his appearance.

He maintained his smile and reached out to a thin line on the edge of the roof. He asked,””I guess ... You’re looking for it?”

This line was very thin, and it was at the top of the building, so it was impossible for the people below to notice it.

One end of the thin thread was firmly fixed to the rooftop while the other end extended to the rooftop of the examination building, which was much shorter than the outpatient building.

Xia ruofei knew that this thin thread looked like it could be broken with a gentle pull, but it was actually made of a high – strength carbon fiber material. It seemed to have used carbon nanomaterials as well. It could not be broken even if an elephant was hanging on it, let alone the weight of an adult.

Xia ruofei had known about this type of special combat equipment when he was serving in the Army. At that time, it was still a concept product and was not equipped to the Army. He did not expect that the group of people who wanted to harm song Qiming would actually use such high – end equipment.

This further confirmed Xia ruofei’s judgment that Wufu’s group was not simple.

The man in gray’s eyes narrowed. He saw Xia ruofei flip his palm and a shiny dagger appeared in his hand like a magic trick. Then, Xia ruofei gently waved his hand and the high – strength carbon fiber rope broke with a sound and fell down gently ...

This kind of carbon fiber rope was very light. Even if there were people below, they would not be hurt.

Furthermore, this was the spot they had checked in advance. The side that the man in gray had found was not crowded to begin with. There were also many trees planted between the outpatient building and the laboratory building, so he would not attract any attention if he were to slide down quickly from here.

After Xia ruofei cut the carbon fiber rope, it most likely fell on the top of the tree.

The man in gray didn’t say a word. He looked at Xia ruofei deeply and turned to run without hesitation.

The man in gray had obviously received strict training. Compared to ordinary people, his speed could be said to be quite fast.

However, his speed was not as fast as Xia ruofei ‘s.

When the man in gray was running at full speed, he saw a flash in front of him and then saw Xia ruofei smiling and standing in front of him with his arms crossed. It was as if he had been standing there waiting for him.

The man in gray’s eyes revealed a look of horror, and he forcibly stopped his figure. If he continued to rush forward, he would undoubtedly be walking into a trap.

“Where can you run to?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

A look of despair appeared on the gray – robed man’s face, but it quickly turned into a look of determination. He even revealed a smile.

Xia ruofei frowned. He dashed towards the man in gray and grabbed his jaw.

However, he was still too late.

A trace of black blood flowed out from the corner of the gray – clothed man’s mouth, and his eyes quickly lost their light.

Xia ruofei’s expression turned ugly. He let go of the man in gray and he fell to the ground. His eyes were wide open as he looked at the sky. He was dead.

Although he was already dead, the man in gray’s mouth still maintained a slight curve, as if he was mocking Xia ruofei.

“They’re actually death Warriors!” Xia ruofei clenched his fists in regret.

He was still a little too arrogant. If he didn’t have the mentality of a cat toying with a mouse, he would have had enough time to restrain the man in gray and wouldn’t have given him the chance to commit suicide.

This method of hiding a highly toxic substance in one’s mouth and biting open the poison sac without hesitation once one was certain that one could not escape was the standard style of a death warrior. Xia ruofei’s moment of carelessness had cut off this lead.

Xia ruofei stared at the man in gray’s glasses and slowly inched closer. With a cold expression, he said,””Wait! I’ll catch you soon!”

With that, Xia ruofei kept the man in gray’s body into the spirit map space and rushed to the edge of the roof, sweeping out his spiritual power ...

A grey van was parked quietly at the entrance of the examination building. Xia ruofei’s spiritual power quickly enveloped the van. The next second, his eyes shot out a cold light.

The van had already started moving quickly and was heading out of the hospital.

Xia ruofei waved his hand and three black shadows appeared out of thin air. They were three huge Hornets. After they appeared, they flapped their wings and flew towards the van ...
