Translator: 549690339

Wu Qiang replied and quickly walked toward the front courtyard.

Xia ruofei picked up the purple clay teapot on the stone table and took a sip of tea. After coming to the capital, he followed the local customs and stopped making kungfu tea. He just put the Dahongpao tea leaves into the purple clay teapot and poured it into hot water. It had a different taste.

After a while, Xia ruofei heard the sound of footsteps.

“Woof! Chairman, you’re really carefree!” Feng Jing joked,”we’re all as tired as dogs, but you’re just drinking tea and lying down like an old man ...”

Xia ruofei straightened up and saw a group of people coming in. He couldn’t help but laugh and said,””Shua shua! Why are you all here? Are you guys here to eat a rich man?”

Other than Feng Jing, Duff also came to join in the fun. There was also Feng Jing’s assistant, Liu Qian, as well as a few other staff members from the company’s administrative office. They were all called to Beijing later to prepare for the jaded skin cream’s launch.

“That’s a must!” Feng Jing laughed.”It’s not easy for our stingy Chairman to treat us to a meal. Don’t we have to mobilize all our members?”

Duff also greeted Xia ruofei with a smile.””Mr. Xia, we meet again!”

Liu Qian and the rest were a little reserved as they greeted Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei chuckled and nodded.”Hello, everyone! Don’t be so restrained, just treat it as your own home!”

Then, he stood up and stretched.””CEO Feng, what you said just now was a little unkind! Although I don’t really care about things as the chairman, I’m not stingy! When have I ever mistreated my own employees?”

“Yes, yes, yes, you’re the most generous!” Feng Rao laughed. Chairman, what are you treating us to tonight?”

“It must be the best!” Xia ruofei said,”everyone has been working hard recently. I’ll go out and buy some ingredients now. I’ll personally cook today and make a delicious meal for everyone!”

“I’ll go, boss!”Wu Qiang quickly said. I’m familiar with all the food markets nearby, so I can cook!”

Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand.”It’s okay. It’s okay. I’m rewarding my employees today. This is what I want!” Wu Qiang, you’re in charge of receiving everyone. Now, bring them for a walk!”

“Alright then!” Wu Qiang hesitated for a moment before he replied. I’ll do as you say!”

“Give me the car keys!” Xia ruofei said,”I’ll go buy the ingredients now!”

“Then, let’s thank the chairman!” Feng Jing cheered.

Liu Qian and the rest knew that Xia ruofei did not put on airs and did not stand on ceremony. They all smiled and expressed their gratitude to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei drove to the nearby Sam’s Club and bought some ready – made braised dishes, cooked food, meat, and seasonings. He also bought a few extra shopping bags when he paid the bill.

Back in the car, he took out paradise vegetables and Drunken Eight Immortals wine from the origin space and put them in empty shopping bags. Then, he drove back to the courtyard.

The garage in the backyard was ready to be used after the renovation. Xia ruofei entered the backyard from the side door and parked the car in the garage.

Wu Qiang was showing everyone around the backyard. When he saw the situation, he quickly ran forward and took the shopping bags from Xia ruofei’s hands.

Xia ruofei passed the car keys to Wu Qiang and said with a smile,””I’ve really put in a lot of money today! He bought a lot of Taoyuan vegetables from Sam’s shop ... What do you think this is? It’s obviously our company’s product, but we have to pay a high price to buy it from the supermarket in Beijing ...”

Feng Rao and the others couldn’t help but laugh.

At the same time, everyone was well aware of the delicious taste of the Taoyuan vegetables produced by their own company, so they couldn’t help but be full of anticipation for tonight’s dinner.

“Chairman, do you need any help?” Feng Jing asked with a smile.

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”no need, no need. You’re in charge of eating today!” If you’re free, you can go to the theater to watch a movie. I think we can start eating after the movie!”

“Then we won’t be polite!” Feng Rao said. Dear colleagues, since the chairman has spoken, let’s go! I’m telling you! The Chairman’s siheyuan’s cinema was very advanced, not worse than a professional cinema! I’ll bring you guys to experience it!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”go ahead!” “Wu Qiang, you go over there as well and find a new movie for everyone. You don’t have to worry about this!”

“Okay, boss!” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

After everyone had left, Xia ruofei rolled up his sleeves, put on his apron, and started to work in the kitchen.

Actually, although Xia ruofei was a little lazy, he was still quite motivated when it came to food. He felt a sense of accomplishment when he saw the dishes that looked, smelled, and tasted good.

An hour later, Xia ruofei heard footsteps from the courtyard and Duff’s surprised voice.””It smells so good!”

Xia ruofei finished the last dish and poked his head out of the kitchen. He smiled and said,””Don’t just watch! Come and help serve the dishes!”

Everyone had just finished watching a movie and was famished. They cheered and swarmed over, quickly bringing Xia ruofei’s food to the dining room.

The large round dining table could fit around ten people. Xia ruofei took off his apron and hung it in the kitchen before calling for everyone to eat.

Wu Qiang subconsciously thought that it would be better to deal with it in the kitchen, but he was stopped by Xia ruofei.
