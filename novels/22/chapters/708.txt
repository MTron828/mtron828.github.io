Chapter 709: A trace of gloominess (3)

Hu ‘Zi’s mother said,”ruofei, don’t run back and forth anymore. You might as well stay at our house tonight!” You sleep in Qiao’ er’s room, I’ll sleep with Qiao’ er!”

Hearing that, Lin Qiao quickly said,”yes, yes, yes!” Brother ruofei, don’t go! Accompany me to buy a computer tomorrow! I’ll be able to use it to estimate and check my scores later. I can also bring him to the University directly after I go to college. ”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”okay, then I’ll stay at your house tonight!”

“Yay!” Lin Qiao cheered.

“Qiao’ er, I’ll give you the money tomorrow,” Hu ‘Zi’s mother said.”You can’t spend your brother ruofei’s money on the computer, okay?”

“I know ...” Lin Qiao said.

Xia ruofei said,”Auntie, you don’t have to be so clear about it!” It’s no big deal if I buy a computer for my sister!”

“That won’t do!” Hu Zi’s mother said,”ruofei, Auntie still has money. How can Qiao’ er let you pay for her computer?”

Xia ruofei smiled and did not say anything. Anyway, Hu Zi’s mother was not going with them tomorrow. By then, he would be the one to decide how he wanted to buy it.

Since he had decided not to go back, Xia ruofei sat back on the sofa and chatted with Hu Zi’s mother and Lin Qiao until it was past nine.

He saw that Hu ‘Zi’s mother had a tired expression on her face, so he stood up and said,””Aunty, I’m a little sleepy. You guys should rest early too!” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Alright, go take a shower then!” Hu Zi’s mother said,”ruofei, we don’t have any pajamas that you can wear. Why don’t I go out and buy you a set now?”

“Aunty, there’s no need to trouble yourself. I have some in my car!” Xia ruofei quickly said.

......

With that, Xia ruofei immediately opened the door and went downstairs. In fact, he had prepared some clothes in the spirit map space, including home clothes, pajamas, and so on. Going downstairs was just a way to hide. After sitting in the car for a while, Xia ruofei took out a set of short – sleeved home clothes from the space and went upstairs with it.

After the shower, Xia ruofei went to Lin Qiao’s room and said Goodnight to the two of them. He then closed the door and prepared to rest.

The young girl’s boudoir was fragrant, and the bedsheets had just been changed by Hu Zi’s mother, so there was still the smell of sunshine.

Xia ruofei lay on the bed and soon fell asleep.

The next morning, Lin Qiao dragged Xia ruofei out to buy a computer after dinner.

Hu Zi’s mother gave Lin Qiao 5000 Yuan and reminded her not to spend Xia ruofei’s money.

Lin Qiao naturally agreed. In fact, she didn’t want Xia ruofei to buy a computer for her.

Lin Qiao was a simple and honest girl from the countryside. She simply liked to be with Xia ruofei and enjoyed the feeling of being taken care of. She wasn’t the kind of girl who would waste money.

The two of them drove to the largest distribution center of electronic products in Sanshan city, xuanlijia Electronics City.

As soon as he walked through the gate of the electronic shopping center, a few people immediately surrounded him. They were holding flyers in their hands and were constantly trying to attract customers.

“Boss, do you want a computer?”

“Young man, if you want to buy a computer, come to our house. We’re having a big promotion!”

“We just got Apple’s smuggled machine. It’s much cheaper than the store!”

Xia ruofei tried his best to separate these people who were trying to attract customers. He took the escalator to some bigger and more formal shops on the second and third floor.

The elevator went up slowly. Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao were looking at the dazzling signs around them. At this moment, Xia ruofei suddenly felt a cold gaze on him.

He couldn’t help but turn his head and look in the direction of the gaze he felt.
