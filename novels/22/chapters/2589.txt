Liu Qunfeng looked at the pills in the container and asked,””Mr. Xia, is there something wrong with these pills?”

Xia ruofei did not answer Liu Qunfeng’s question directly. Instead, he asked,””Who can come into contact with these pills?”

“Mainly the nurse in charge of taking care of the old man,” Liu Qunfeng said without even thinking.

Then, Liu Qunfeng pointed at the Man in Black and said,””The nurses also took the pills under their eyes. From here to the old man’s room, the whole process was under surveillance. There shouldn’t have been any chance to do anything.”

There was something else that Liu Qunfeng didn’t say. If even the remaining pills in the container had been tampered with, it would be even more impossible.

Because the time the nurse took to get the medicine was very short each time, there was no time to tamper with every pill.

Xia ruofei looked at the man in Black and asked,””What about them? They are responsible for guarding these pills, so they should have enough time to do something to these pills, right?”

The burly Man in Black looked angry, but he quickly lowered his head and did not dare to show it in front of Xia ruofei.

Liu Qunfeng explained,”Mr. Xia, before the old man’s condition worsened, there were at least two people on duty here. In addition to the doctors and nurses on duty, there were five or six people in this room at all times. There were eight cameras in this room, and they were aimed at the refrigerator from multiple angles. There were no blind spots, so they couldn’t have come into contact with the pills without anyone knowing.”

Xia ruofei nodded in agreement with Liu Qunfeng. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

If everyone in the room was in the same condition as Liu Qunfeng had described before elder Liu’s condition had worsened, then they could basically rule out the suspicion of these staff members. And after the condition worsened, even if the people here had the opportunity to secretly come into contact with the pills, it did not mean anything.

This was because it was very obvious that the deterioration of old man Liu’s condition had started a week ago, which meant that there must have been something wrong with all of these pills a week ago. If only a portion of the pills had been tampered with, then from a probability point of view, it was unlikely that old man Liu had been so unlucky to have taken all of the pills that had been tampered with.

As long as there was a pill that was normal during this process, then at least the illness would be contained to a certain extent.

What’s more, the pills in the preservation box had lost their medicinal properties. The person who had tampered with the pills would not risk exposure and tamper with the pills again after he had already gotten his hands on them.

This was not logical at all.

So, the first truth was that the medicine had been tampered with, and the reason for elder Liu’s deterioration was because it had been tampered with. The second fact that could be confirmed was: This incident had happened a week ago, and it could even be precise to a few days.

“Who was it?” Xia ruofei asked.”Who was in contact with the pill seven or eight days ago?”

“We should have registered the nurses on duty for the past few days. We’ll know once we check.” Liu Qunfeng said.

“Although you can check it out, don’t get your hopes up.” Xia ruofei said indifferently,”this person is unlikely to be a doctor or a nurse.”

“Then ...” Liu Qunfeng tried to recall. Suddenly, a figure flashed through his mind. He couldn’t help but frown, and a strange expression appeared on his face.

Xia ruofei, who was standing at the side, saw everything clearly. He smiled and said,””It seems that you already have an answer in your heart? If you don’t mind, I’d like to hear your judgment!”
