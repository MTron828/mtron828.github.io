This way, the taste would be a little worse, but the tea leaves were good enough, and the tea fragrance would overflow when it was brewed.

Xia ruofei poured a cup of tea for everyone, then smiled and said,””Brother Zhao, tell me about your relationship with this brother Wu Qiang first!”

Zhao Yong Jun took a sip of tea and smiled,””This kid was from the first batch of new recruits that I taught when I was a platoon leader ...”

Following Zhao Yongjun’s story, Xia ruofei and song Rui found out that after Zhao Yongjun was thrown into the Army by general Zhao Cheng, he was promoted smoothly in his third year. After half a year of training in the Academy, he was awarded the rank of second lieutenant.

His first job in the Army was to be a platoon leader of new recruits, in charge of training the new recruits who had just been recruited.

Wu Qiang was one of the new recruits. Because his military quality was better, he was highly regarded by Zhao Yongjun. After the recruit training, the new recruits were assigned to their own companies. Zhao Yongjun even specially asked him to join his company.

Wu Qiang didn’t let down Zhao Yongjun’s high regard. He performed well in all aspects and became the Vice class monitor in the second year. He was even promoted to Sergeant later.

However, Zhao Yongjun had no interest in working in the Army, so he applied to leave the Army when he was a company commander.

At that time, Wu Qiang was still serving in the Army, and he had already become the backbone of his company. He had been the squad leader for several years and had even acted as the acting platoon leader when the platoon leader was vacant.

After Zhao Yong Jun changed his career, he was transferred to a public institution. However, he was a restless person. He quit his job not long after and started to work on antiques. At that time, general Zhao Cheng was quite angry.

Zhao Yongjun had lost contact with some of his comrades in the Army after moving to other places for a few years. He had only heard that Wu Qiang had retired after he had completed his service as a class two non – commissioned officer. He did not expect Wu Qiang to come to the capital to ask him to tell him that the Army they were serving in at that time was in the Beibei province.

After Zhao Yongjun finished, he looked at Wu Qiang and said, “You’ve been in Beijing for so many years, but you didn’t even contact the old platoon leader. Do you not see me as a brother?”

“I didn’t know you were in Beijing, platoon leader!” Wu Qiang quickly said. Besides, the contact information from back then is no longer valid. Beijing is so big, I can’t find you even if I wanted to!”

Wu Qiang was telling the truth. Zhao Yongjun had changed his number several times over the years, and he had lost contact with his comrades who he had not seen for many years.

If Zhao Yongjun wanted to find Wu Qiang in the capital, it wouldn’t be difficult at all. However, Wu Qiang was just a child of an ordinary family and didn’t have any connections in the capital. Even if he wanted to find Zhao Yongjun, it would be impossible.

Zhao Yongjun couldn’t help but be at a loss,”You have a point.”

Then, Zhao Yongjun looked at song Rui and asked,””Xiao Rui, how did you know Wu Qiang? you even introduced him to work for RUO Fei.”

Song Rui smiled and said,”of course someone introduced me!” Ruofei said that he wanted to find a reliable person, preferably a retired soldier, so I asked Guo ruchao for help. He knows more soldiers! That’s why I introduced him to Wu Qiang. It just so happens that Wu Qiang is in the capital, so I brought him over. ”

“Guo ruchao?” Zhao Yongjun asked, surprised. Wu Qiang, how do you know Guo ruchao?”

Guo ruchao was one of them, but he was older than song Rui and the others. His father’s position wasn’t as high as Zhao Cheng ‘s.

However, Guo ruchao had been developing in the Army. He was now the deputy chief of staff of a division stationed in Beijing. At the age of 35 or 36, he had reached the level of a Regiment commander. It could be considered a very good development.

“He used to be my chief of staff,” Wu Qiang replied honestly.

It turned out that after Zhao Yongjun transferred to another profession, Wu Qiang performed outstandingly in a group military competition. He was transferred to the main battle group where Guo ruchao was the Chief of Staff as the squad leader of the reconnaissance team. Guo ruchao also thought highly of Wu Qiang, who had excellent military quality. When Wu Qiang was discharged from the Army, he had asked him to stay many times and even specially went to the higher – ups to ask for the quota of a third class Sergeant.

However, the reason why Wu Qiang chose to retire from the Army was not only because of the lack of a high – ranking officer, but more importantly, it was because the expenses for his family’s medical bills and his younger siblings ‘school fees were too high. The salary of a Sergeant was simply not enough. Therefore, he wanted to leave the Army and work somewhere else to earn more money.

Guo ruchao felt sorry for Wu Qiang when he found out about the reason, but he still allowed him to leave the Army. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Not only that, but Guo ruchao also used his connections in Beijing to help Wu Qiang find a job.

Because Wu Qiang was a rural resident, there was no job arrangement for him after he retired from the Army. Originally, Guo ruchao wanted to arrange a white – collar office job for him, but Wu Qiang said that his academic qualifications were low and declined. In the end, he chose a job as a security Captain, which was considered a professional counterpart.

In the past few years when Wu Qiang was in Beijing, Guo ruchao had been taking care of him. When he heard that song Rui was looking for a job as a private nurse for his friend, he immediately recommended Wu Qiang.

After listening to Wu Qiang’s explanation, Zhao Yongjun couldn’t help but feel a little emotional.”I didn’t expect Guo ruchao to be so loyal!”

Then, he said guiltily,””Wu Qiang, I didn’t even know that you were in Beijing all these years. Guo ruchao has been taking good care of you ...”

“Old platoon leader, it’s me who didn’t take the initiative to contact you ...” Wu Qiang quickly said.

Zhao Yongjun waved his hand.”We’ve contacted each other today. If you have any difficulties in the future, you must let me know. I’ll definitely help you if I can!”
