Chapter 1720: The press conference full of laughter (2)

Now that Xia ruofei had personally exaggerated the credit of the experienced captain Brook to the greatest extent, it could actually alleviate the pressure of public opinion that the Australian Airlines was facing to a large extent.

The second reporter’s question was for Tony.

The male reporter in a suit asked,”Mr. Tony, according to the media reports, at the time of the incident, Wilkinson had already successfully locked himself in the cockpit, and the crew broke the door down. As far as I know, the design of the cockpit door is very solid. In theory, as long as the pilot in the cockpit does not actively open the door, it is impossible to break it from the outside. Is there any issue with the quality of the plane?”

Tony’s smile faded a little and he said,””I’m sorry, the details are still under investigation. I don’t have the right to announce it before a definite conclusion is reached, so I can’t verify the details you mentioned. If there’s any further information, we’ll announce it as soon as possible.”

A few more reporters asked Tony questions, but Tony did not answer them directly when it came to some details of the incident. The official information that the reporters could get was very limited.

Hence, the reporters quickly shifted their focus to Xia ruofei.

For the media, the official voice was naturally needed, but they were more focused on the eye – catching points, such as the lone hero.

“Mr. Xia, what was the biggest difficulty in the whole process?” A female reporter with freckles on her face asked.

Xia ruofei smiled and replied without thinking,””The greatest difficulty? Of course, I don’t know how to fly a plane! Everything had to be learned on the spot. Additionally, the automatic driving device had been damaged at that time. From the moment I sat in the pilot’s seat to the moment the plane landed in Saipan, it was manually driven. Therefore, I have to say it again, Captain Brook ...”

The reporters laughed kindly. Xia ruofei’s stance was too obvious.

However, Xia ruofei still said seriously,””Captain Brook is really a great teacher. He can even teach a layman who has never flown a fixed – Wing plane and complete the landing on the spot. Therefore, I strongly suggest that qplease promote Mr. Brook as your instructor!”

This time, everyone laughed even louder, and even Tony joined in.””We will definitely consider Mr. Xia’s suggestion seriously!”

The atmosphere at the scene was very joyous. The reporters continued to ask questions. Most of them threw their questions to Xia ruofei. Occasionally, one or two of them asked the chief flight attendant Guli and the air traffic police.

All in all, Xia ruofei’s response was very appropriate. Other than a few details that were consistent with the words of Australian Airlines, he answered most of the questions very seriously.

Xia ruofei could speak fluent English and was very smart. He often said something humorous to make everyone laugh. This was very different from the image of the Chinese people in everyone’s mind.

It could be seen that the media reporters had a good impression of Xia ruofei, and the reports would probably be good.

It was already noon, and the Q & A session had taken a lot of time. Most of the reporters had gotten the information they wanted.

“Due to this incident, we have one last question to ask!” The host said.

In the end, the right to ask this question was given to the reporter from The Daily Telegraph.

“My question is for Mr. Tony,” he said with a smile.”After the incident happened, with the disclosure of some details, our first impression was that it was too bizarre and exciting. It was even more thrilling than a movie. What I want to ask is if qstrang airlines has any plans to adapt this forced surrender into a movie? I believe that if we can put this incident on the screen, there will be a lot of people willing to go to the cinema to watch it!”

Tony was stunned for a moment. He had been busy dealing with the matter of the forced surrender for the past few days. Naturally, he had not considered the adaptation of the film.

What’s more, this matter was essentially an internal problem of qstro airlines. From qstro airlines ‘point of view, they were not willing to expose their own dirty laundry, let alone make it into a movie.

However, Tony thought for a moment and smiled,””A movie adaptation? That was a good idea! Although our main focus is still on the investigation and the aftermath, we will also seriously consider your suggestion! Of course, if it’s a movie adaptation, it’ll be perfect if Mr. Xia is the main character!”

The press conference ended with everyone’s laughter. The reporters had gotten enough information. The Australian Airlines had also achieved the effect of leading the public opinion. Xia ruofei had also gained a lot. Other than the rewards from the Australian Airlines, as the contents of the press conference were reported, Xia ruofei would become a well – known hero in Australia.

It could be said that everyone was happy. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Tony and Xia ruofei went to the backstage of the conference hall. Although the conference had ended, Tony still said sincerely,””Mr. Xia, thank you very much for speaking up for qiuhang!”

Xia ruofei smiled faintly and said,”I’m just telling the truth. By the way, how’s Captain Brook’s injury?” Will it affect his future flight duties?”

“After the examination, Brook’s life is not in danger,” Tony said.”The bone fracture in his arm may take some time to recover. The doctor is still optimistic. There should be no problem for him to return to his flight position.”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”that’s good!” Where is he receiving treatment now?”

“The company has already sent a special medical plane to pick him up and bring him back to the suttani.” “He’s currently receiving treatment at St Vincent’s Hospital,” Tony said.

Xia ruofei nodded.”Okay. If I have time before I return, I’ll visit him.”

At this time, Tang Yitian and Li Yifu also walked over.

“Mr. Tony, I’m very interested in the last reporter’s suggestion!” Tang Yitian told Tony. If qplease airlines wants to adapt this forced surrender into a film, our Mei ya group is willing to invest and cooperate!”

The Maya Group had evolved from a giant in the retail industry a few years ago into a comprehensive large group. In addition to the retail business, other businesses were also doing well. The entertainment industry was personally handled by Jennifer. In addition to the artist management company, there was also a film company, so it was naturally very easy to shoot a movie.

“Thank you, Mr. Tang,” said Tony,”but our group hasn’t considered this matter yet, and I can’t make a decision myself. Of course, if we’re really going to make this movie, we’ll definitely consider cooperating with the Meya group first!”

Tang Yitian nodded seriously and said,””Mr. Tony, this is actually a pretty good theme. You can strike the iron while it’s hot and launch a movie plan. This is also a kind of publicity for quandé!”

Tang Yitian paused, then continued,””If you really invite RUO Fei to be the main character of the movie, our Mei ‘ya group is willing to bear 70% of the shooting funds and not a single cent of the profits. All of it will be donated to charity organizations in our names. What do you think?”

Tony couldn’t help but be a little tempted. Although Maya pictures wasn’t one of the top companies in Australia, their main business was retail, but their influence was still good, especially with their abundant funds. Qinba was very happy to cooperate with such a rich company.

Just as Tang Yitian had said, if the movie was made well, it would have a positive impact on Quto.

If qstrang took the lead in the shooting, it would be easy to weaken the negative impact of the co-pilot’s intentional suicide and emphasize the role of Captain Brook and Xia ruofei in the script.

What’s more, Tang Yitian had agreed to make a big contribution. He was even willing to donate the full amount of the profits in the name of both parties. Wasn’t this another opportunity for Macau airlines to increase their reputation?

Tony, who had initially been a little perfunctory with the reporter, was now really tempted. He even began to seriously consider the feasibility of the matter.
