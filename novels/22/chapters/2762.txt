2763 We won’t go home until we’re drunk (1)

Translator: 5496903Today’s gathering should be called a meal in the Army. The atmosphere was very lively. The Veterans had gathered again after such a long time and everyone was very happy. In this atmosphere, they naturally drank a lot.

Xia ruofei had drunk a lot as well, but he did not use his spiritual energy to disperse the alcohol. At this moment, if he did not get drunk no matter how much he drank, it would be tasteless. Of course, Xia ruofei’s current physique was completely different from before. Even if he did not use his true energy to dispel the alcohol, his alcohol tolerance was much stronger than before.

Therefore, even though he was the host and had finished a bottle of white wine in a short while, he only felt a little dizzy, not even tipsy.

On the other hand, Ma Jia and the other veterans’ eyes had already begun to wander after three rounds of wine.

It wasn’t that Ma Jia and the others couldn’t hold their liquor, but that Xia ruofei’s alcohol tolerance was too good.

Ma Jia patted Xia ruofei’s shoulder and said, ” “RUO Fei! You ... You brat ... After you left the Army ... Your alcohol tolerance has increased a lot! At ... At ... The ... At ... The ... Place ... You didn’t ... Practice less, did you? ”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,” old company commander, I’ve always been good at drinking!” It’s just that you used to be my leader, so I was too embarrassed to make you drink until you lie down!”

MA Yinlong laughed and said,” you ... You’re bragging!” I think you’re also holding on ... Come! If you have the ability ... Have another big drink with me!”

“Company commander MA, you should drink less! ” Both you and ruofei have drunk quite a lot tonight ...” Lin Yue’ e persuaded.

Ma Jia was actually a little bit drunk at this time. He said, ” “Sis-in-law ... It’s ... Fine ... We ... We still have some left!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,” sister-in-law, if the old company commander wants to drink, then let him drink!” There’s no one else here, and we’re in our own territory. If he gets drunk, I’ll just carry him back, he’ll be fine!”

Lin Yue’ e didn’t drink at night, so she could naturally tell that Ma Jia had drunk too much. However, Xia ruofei was still sober. After all, Xia ruofei was the host. Since he had already said so, Lin Yue’ e couldn’t persuade him any further and could only nod helplessly.

“Ruofei, you’d better control yourself. Don’t drink too much and cause an accident. If that happens, things might turn bad ...”She said after some thought.

It was a small matter to lose face after drinking too much. Lin Yue’ e was worried that if she drank too much, she might suffer from severe alcohol poisoning or stomach bleeding. That would be troublesome. As the organizer of the banquet and the boss of these people, Xia ruofei had to take responsibility. Furthermore, these veterans were all old squad leader Luo’s comrades. Lin Yue’ e definitely didn’t want to see anything happen to them.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded,” don’t worry, sis-in-law.” I know what I’m doing, nothing will happen!”

The Veterans were all physically fit. When the military unit did not prohibit drinking, they would drink together a lot after training and missions. Xia ruofei was confident in their alcohol tolerance.

Even if someone did get sick from drinking too much, Xia ruofei would be there and nothing would happen.

After Lin Yue’ e heard Xia ruofei’s words, she nodded her head and stopped trying to persuade him.

Xia ruofei smiled and took the bottle of wine. He first filled Ma Jia’s glass and then filled his own.

He picked up his cup and said,”old company commander, I’ll toast this cup to you!” I want to thank you for taking care of me during my time in the Army. At the same time, I wish you all the best after you end your military career!”

Ma Jia nodded heavily and said,””Thank you, brother!”

The two of them clinked their glasses, then raised their heads and drank at the same time. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Xia ruofei drank the waiter’s glass of white wine easily. Ma Jia, on the other hand, was a little forced. After drinking the large glass of white wine, the smell of alcohol suddenly surged up. However, he covered his mouth in time and forced it down. Then, he sat in his seat for a while, picked up the glass of juice, and took two big gulps to avoid the embarrassment of ‘live broadcast’.

At this moment, another veteran came over to toast Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei did not refuse anyone. He used his eyes to signal Lei Hu to pay attention to ma SU’s condition while chuckling and pouring wine from the bottle. He started drinking with the Veterans again.

Lin Yue ‘E’s eyes were twitching. Xia ruofei’s manner of drinking white wine as if it were water was really scary.

However, the ex – soldiers had all drunk to a certain extent and were not as observant as Lin Yue ‘e. When they saw that Xia ruofei had finished his glass, they all gave him a thumbs up and went to find their close comrades to drink.

At nineo’ clock in the evening, Xia ruofei saw that there was not much white wine left in Lei Hu’s bottle. Some of the Veterans were already sleeping on the table. He felt that he had drunk enough. In fact, he was feeling a little dizzy as well. This was a sign of alcohol.

Hence, Xia ruofei stood up and suggested that everyone drink up.

The Veterans who were still sober raised their glasses and drank their last glass of wine. Then, they helped their drunk comrades back to the dormitory.

Ma Jia was already fast asleep in her seat. Xia ruofei walked over and gestured for Lei Hu, who was about to help her up, to move aside. Then, he easily carried Ma Jia on his back and turned to Lei Hu, saying,”Make sure someone stays in the dormitory at night. If anyone feels any serious discomfort, inform me immediately! Also, get the cafeteria to prepare some hangover soup for everyone to drink!”
