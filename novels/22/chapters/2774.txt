Beijing, the song family’s old residence.

Elder song was sitting in front of a computer with his reading glasses on. After his retirement, he still maintained the habit of paying attention to national affairs. After the rise of the internet in recent years, he also slowly learned to use the internet because he found that although the internet was mixed with good and bad people, it was closer to the lives of ordinary people and could better understand the real situation. These were things that he couldn’t see in the documents and internal references that were sent to him every day.

Manager Lu was standing not far behind him, waiting for his orders.

Manager Lu realized that the Bureau chief had been on this page for quite some time. As for the contents of the page, he was very clear about it. This was because elder song had only opened it after he had reported to him.

Elder song was browsing the Weibo video that Xia ruofei had posted. After watching Xia ruofei’s video, the old man flipped through the comments with great interest.

After a long time, elder song muttered to himself,”RUO Fei is a good kid ...”

Then, he turned his head slightly and said to manager Lu,””Xiao Lu, tell the sports Bureau that RUO Fei’s willingness to play for the national team has already shown his noble character and unquestionable integrity. Tell them to be less bureaucratic, consider RUO Fei’s actual situation, and try to meet his reasonable requirements.”

“Yes, chief!” Manager Lu quickly replied and recorded the incident in his little notebook.

Manager Lu couldn’t even remember how many of these notebooks he had used. Ever since he started working, he had developed a good habit of taking notes at all times. It was even more so as a Secretary. He had to remember the instructions of the Bureau chief clearly, otherwise, it was easy to make mistakes. Especially in the past few years, he had gradually grown older and his memory was far from what it used to be, so he paid more attention to this aspect.

“You go ahead ...” Elder song waved his hand and said,”I’ll read the comments again. ”

“Alright!” Manager Lu replied respectfully.

He quietly left the study and went to his own small office next door. Then, he immediately picked up the phone on his desk and called the sports Bureau according to elder song’s instructions ...

A similar scene was happening in the Liu family.

Elder Liu was still living in the same courtyard. After listening to Liu Qunfeng’s report, he took a tablet from Liu Qunfeng. He looked through it for a while before putting it down.

“Qunfeng, I remember that Xiao Zhao from the Chinese Football Association used to work under you, right?” he said lightly.

“Yes!” Liu Qunfeng quickly replied. He used to be my assistant. ”

The “little Zhao” that old Liu was talking about was not the kind of young man that was often seen in government agencies. In fact, this little Zhao was the full – time Vice President of the Chinese Football Association, Zhao Zhenghao. His rank was not low in China, and in the sports field, especially in the football field, he was naturally a Big Boss.

“Tell Xiao Zhao to inform his subordinates that Xiao Xia can’t be managed like an ordinary player. After all, he has his actual situation!” Moreover, Xiao Xia could completely ignore the recruitment of the Chinese Football Association because he was not even a professional player! However, he resolutely responded to the enlistment. As the governing body, we should consider him more!”

“Understood!” Liu Qunfeng said,”I’ll contact him now! Convey your orders. ” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Elder Liu didn’t object to Liu QUN FENG using his name to call Zhao Zhenghao. He just nodded.

When Liu Qunfeng saw this, he immediately knew what was going on. The old man’s attitude was clear. All he had to do was spread the word.

……

The Chinese Football Association.

Zhao Zhenghao was sitting in his spacious and bright office. The room was warm and his forehead was covered in sweat.

Of course, whether it was because of the heating or the two phone calls just now, he didn’t know.

It had been three to four minutes since Zhao Zhenghao finished the call, but his heart was still beating fast.

He was indeed quite frightened.

In the beginning, it was a high – ranking Deputy bureau chief from the headquarters who called personally, saying that he wanted to know more about Xia ruofei’s situation. However, the meaning of his words was very clear, which was that special circumstances needed special treatment, and special talents needed special care. They had to satisfy Xia ruofei’s reasonable requests as much as possible and could not repeat the previous mistakes.

Although the management was separated after the football reform, the football management Center of the general Administration had been abolished, and the Chinese Football Association had become an independent mass group in a legal sense, in fact, the influence of the general Administration had not decreased much. The opinions of a Deputy Director must also be taken seriously.

Zhao Zhenghao naturally agreed and said that he would personally handle this matter.

The Deputy Director hung up the phone, satisfied.

After a while, another call to say hello to Xia ruofei came in. This time, it was from Zhao Zhenghao’s old leader, Liu Qunfeng.

Zhao Zhenghao was well aware of Liu Qunfeng’s resources and strength. In addition, he was his old leader, so his attitude was very warm.

To his surprise, Liu Qunfeng didn’t make any small talk. He went straight to the point and made a request to him about Xia ruofei. His opinion was similar to that of the Deputy bureau chief. However, the same thing would have different weight when said by different people.

Especially in the end, Liu Qunfeng made it clear that this was his father’s opinion, and he was only responsible for conveying it.
