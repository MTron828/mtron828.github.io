Chapter 3452: Breaking the record (2)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei was still as strong as a hot knife through butter. He didn’t stop for long and continued to climb up. When he reached the 100th step, he felt the pressure making him uncomfortable.

The pressure of his spiritual power was still alright. After all, his spiritual power was infinitely close to the spirit transformation realm of a nascent soul cultivator. However, the pressure of the Obsidian stairway could be said to be Omni – directional. As long as he stood on the steps, the huge pressure around him existed at all times. It could be said that every part of his body was bearing such pressure.

Xia ruofei roughly estimated that the external pressure was at least ten times his own weight.

And it wasn’t pressing down from above, but from all directions.

The vertical overload suffered by the pilot of the aircraft carrier was about 4 G, which was equivalent to four times its own weight.

When astronauts took off, the maximum Overload they had to bear was less than 8g.

On the other hand, Xia ruofei was overloaded by dozens of gigabytes of data.

Of course, even aircraft carrier pilots and astronauts with strong bodies couldn’t be compared with cultivators.

Even if Ling Qingxue’s Stairway to Heaven was suitable for Qi refinement cultivators, and the difficulty was obviously lower than Xia ruofei*s, she had reached more than one hundred and seventy steps. Basically, the external pressure she had to endure at that time should be the same as the pressure Xia ruofei was facing now on the one hundred steps.

Ling Qingxue, a seemingly weak woman, could withstand dozens of GS of overload. This was not only the effect of external pressure, but also the powerful spiritual power Pressure and the invisible force that affected the circulation of the true Qi in the body. From this, one could see the huge gap between ordinary people and cultivators.

For Xia ruofei, it was easier to withstand the spiritual pressure at the hundredth step. Although the external pressure was tens of gigabytes, it was at most a little more Yuan Qi consumption and was far from his limit. What made him most uncomfortable was the invisible force. With every step he took, the force would increase a little, causing the yuan Qi in his body to vibrate continuously.

The key was that he had to constantly circulate his vital Qi to resist the external pressure, so under the influence of the invisible force, the vital Qi in his body vibrated even more violently. If he did not control it well, it was really easy to cause his vital Qi to go berserk and then go into Qi deviation.

Fortunately, Xia ruofei’s “great Dao technique” was indeed a top – notch technique. When he felt that his vital Qi was getting out of control, he would stop and start to operate the “great Dao technique” technique. When the technique started to operate at full speed, the vital Qi that was on the verge of losing control would quickly be controlled.

In the hidden space that was enshrouded in purple mist, Daoist Qing Xuan nodded slightly and said,””It seems like this little kid has some strength. He’s able to reach the 100th level so easily. Brother Shanhe, your judgment is correct. It shouldn’t be a problem for this kid to break through the 200th level!”

Daoist priest Qing Xuan smiled with relief and said,””After waiting for so long, there’s finally another genius who meets the selection requirements! 1 didn’t stay here in vain!”

“Everyone knows that Daoist brother Qing Xuan has worked hard and achieved great things!” If Xia ruofei can pass the selection this time, Daoist Qing Xuan’s contribution will be indispensable!”

Daoist Qing Xuan rolled his eyes and said,””I’m just guarding the trial Pagoda, what’s so important about that? On the other hand, you, brother mountain river, not only have you killed so many enemies, but you’ve also left behind a trace of destiny in the cultivation world of China, and you’ve even raised such an outstanding disciple. This is what I call a contribution that can not be missed!”

Immortal mountain river laughed happily, but he still said humbly,””Not really! Not really! Besides … This child hadn’t even passed level 200! It’s hard to say…”

“Against my will!” Daoist Qing Xuan snorted and said,”this little kid has reached the hundredth step and still doesn’t look like he’s in any difficulty. Isn’t it certain that he’ll break through the two hundredth step? What I’m curious about now is how many levels he can reach. Speaking of which, the record of this heavenly stairs has already been sealed for several hundred years, right?”

Immortal mountain river waved his hand and said,”it’s too unrealistic to break the record!” As long as this child can make it to the 200th floor, I’m already satisfied!”

On the eighth level of the trial Pagoda, Xia ruofei did not stay on the hundredth level for too long. After simply regulating his breathing and stabilizing the Restless Yuan Qi in his body, he continued to climb up.

However, when he reached the hundredth step, it was no longer so easy for him to deal with the pressure. At least, he did not dare to be careless enough to directly climb up the steps. Every time, he would stand firmly on the steps with two feet, then slightly adjust himself before continuing to climb up. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Of course, the time he took to adjust himself was also very short. It was usually just a few breaths of time before he immediately stepped onto the next step.

Just like that, as the pressure increased, Xia ruofei took a longer time to adjust.

However, he still maintained a relatively stable pace.

Unknowingly, he had also reached around rank one hundred and seventy.

When Ling Qingxue had been climbing the stairway to heaven, it had already been very difficult for her to reach this position. With every step she took, she had to adjust for a long time before she could stabilize her swaying body. She also had to rest for a while and accumulate enough strength before continuing to climb.

On the other hand, Xia ruofei was much more relaxed than Ling Qingxue.

Although the pressure was so great that he had to resist it with all his strength, he was still able to stand firmly on the steps in a very short time, and the origin Energy in his body was also quickly stabilized.

The reason why Xia ruofei was able to appear relatively relaxed was largely due to the “great Dao technique”, which allowed his control of vital Qi to be far superior to ordinary cultivators of the same level. In addition, his psyche had almost reached the level of a nascent soul cultivator, which made it easier for him to resist the pressure of psyche force.

As for the strength of his body, Xia ruofei, who had cultivated the little golden man body refining technique, was also stronger than the average golden core stage cultivator who specialized in cultivating vital Qi.

At the height of one hundred and seventy steps, Xia ruofei felt that the external pressure was at least seventy to eighty times his own weight, or even more.

If it was a cultivator with a weaker body, they would naturally need to consume more vital Qi to resist such a huge pressure.

On the other hand, Xia ruofei was in a much better state.

In addition, he also had a treasure like the energy storage Pearl. His energy storage was several times more abundant than that of an ordinary intermediate golden core cultivator, so he had even less to worry about.

With all these advantages, Xia ruofei’s performance had been smooth.

In fact, most of the intermediate and advanced Aurous core cultivators were barely holding on when they reached the 170th step. They looked very embarrassed.

Even if they could pass the 200th level, they would often have exhausted their strength and would not be able to display better.

Judging from Xia ruofei’s current state, he should not have only reached the 200th step.

Xia ruofei’s heart was as still as water. He did not consider the gains and losses at all. He maintained his own unique rhythm. As long as his Yuan Qi was restored and stabilized, he would continue to climb.

One hundred and eighty, one hundred and ninety…

Before he knew it, Xia ruofei was already standing on the one hundred and ninety – ninth step. In front of him was the two hundredth step.

Xia ruofei didn’t know that the 200th step was a dividing line, but he was clear that every 100 steps meant that the difficulty would increase.

Therefore, even though he felt that he still had a lot of energy left, he still rested for a while on the one hundred and ninety ninth step. While resisting the omnipresent pressure, he adjusted his condition.

Then, he raised his head to look at the light screen door at the top of the steps. He took a deep breath and his left foot firmly stepped onto the 200th step..
