“Mark Rocca’s interception! He passed the ball to Xia ruofei. It was a good chance for the Spaniards to fight back! Iglasias, Wu Lei, and Granello were all quickly moving forward! Wu Lei’s speed is the fastest!” Shen fangjian’s tone suddenly became a lot higher.

He continued to speak excitedly,”Xia ruofei directly made a long pass!” He found Wu Lei accurately! Wu Lei ran past a little ... He jumped high and did a header cross! “Go in!” Iglasias, who followed up from the middle, kicked the ball and it went in! The ball went in! In the 59th minute of the game, Spain scored another goal. Now the score was three to one, and the Spaniards were leading by two goals again! It’s simply unbelievable!”

Jia Tianning said,”most of the credit for this goal should be given to our two Chinese players!” “Of course, markelka’s interception is crucial, but Xia ruofei is the one who really instigates the attack. His super long distance pass is as accurate as a guided missile. Such a pass is a test of one’s Foundation. Without a doubt, Xia ruofei’s footwork has reached a very high level.”

Jia Tianning continued,”also, Wu Lei’s handling was very calm!” In the past, he had often been criticized for his rough handling of the ball in the opponent’s penalty area. This time, he was very calm and did not force a header. Otherwise, there was a high probability that he would waste Xia ruofei’s beautiful pass! Wu Lei’s header could be said to be just right! As long as Iglesia ran to his position, he could score the ball without any difficulty! This is equivalent to sending a pancake to his mouth!”

Shen fangjian smiled and said,”this shows that Wu Lei has improved a lot during his time in RCD Espanyol!” In fact, I’ve been saying that our players should try their best to train in the high – Level European leagues. Otherwise, it’s very difficult to improve the overall level of Chinese football!”

Jia Tianning sighed,”the problem now is that China’s League has a high income!” Especially for the young domestic players with Chinese household registers, it was not normal for their value to skyrocket. It was a bubble economy! A lot of young players have the opportunity to go out, but many people are reluctant to give up their annual salary of millions and tens of millions in the country. They accept the result of a sharp decline in income and go to the foreign leagues to fight. ”

“It’s actually still decided by the environment,”Shen fangjian said.” After all, a player’s career is only for a few years. The income of the domestic league is so high now. If he goes out, it would be a waste of precious time to make money! One year of playing is one year less!”

“You have to have some feelings when it comes to football!” Jia Tianning said,”the current income of domestic players is definitely abnormal. It is impossible for European clubs to pay such a high salary to bring in a young player who has not proven himself in any major competition!”

“In fact, I think the Chinese Football Association should encourage young players to go out.” Shen fangjian said,”we can provide some policy support! In addition, the clubs in the Chinese Super League could also share a part of the salary! As long as it is stated in the transfer contract that once the player returns to play, he must unconditionally choose his previous team. This way, it is equivalent to sending our good players out to’ level up ‘.”

At this time, the live broadcast signal was already replaying the goal, so Shen fangjian and Jia Tianning decisively ended this slightly sensitive topic and re – discussed the goal.

At the same time, commentators from all over the country’s major broadcasting platforms also gave high praise to the goal. They mainly analyzed it from a tactical point of view and believed that the Spanish team’s decision to firmly fight back under the premise of a solid defense was the right choice.

Of course, almost all the commentators gave Xia ruofei’s precise pass a very high evaluation. Some even compared the pass to Beckham’s “full moon scimitar.”

Indeed, whether it was the passing distance or the accuracy, Xia ruofei’s pass was perfect. Compared to Beckham, it was just that babe’s “full moon scimitar” had been displayed in front of the fans countless times and had become his representative. Xia ruofei, on the other hand, did not play in many matches. It was hard to say whether this was his true strength or a flash of inspiration.

Nokapu Stadium.

After the game resumed, Xia ruofei could clearly feel that the fans in the stands had weakened a lot. It was obvious that the consecutive blows had made them doubt their lives.

With such a good form, was Espanyol really a weak team that they could easily beat?

The first score on the scoreboard already gave the answer.

In fact, it was not only the fans, but even the Barcelona players on the field seemed to be a little lacking in spirit, and their impatience was gradually growing.

Although they still launched a fierce attack on the Espanyol’s goal, there were often some hasty passes and a few low – Level mistakes, one of which almost allowed the Spanish team to counterattack again.

If Granello’s shot had not been over the crossbar, the score on the field might have been changed to four – one.

Bar?a’s head coach, valdevi ?, decisively made a substitution. He replaced Semedo and artil, who did not perform well, with Roberto and Malcolm. At this time, the game time was only about 60 minutes.

There was only one substitution left, and valwade did not dare to use it easily. After all, there was still half an hour left in the game. If the substitution was used up early and the team was injured, there would be no room for adjustment. They might even be forced to play one less player. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

After Alberto and Malcolm played, they brought valdwei’s latest instructions, so the Barcelona team gradually stabilized and began to patiently look for opportunities with their skillful guidance.

Espanyol’s lineup could be said to have exceeded their level today. The current situation was very favorable to Espanyol, so Ruby did not make any player adjustments for the time being.

The main theme of the game still did not change. After Spain led by two goals, they were more determined to carry out the manager’s defensive tactics, and the trailing bar?a naturally launched waves of attacks.

The game time had unknowingly reached seventy – five minutes, and the time left for Barcelona was getting less and less.

The anxiety on the faces of the Barcelona players became more and more obvious.

However, just as things seemed calm, a straight ball from the referee Busquets found cudinho. After the latter broke into the penalty area, he did not find a chance to shoot under Naldo’s close interference. Just when everyone thought that the attack would most likely end without a goal, cudinho, who had already dribbled the ball and was close to the end line, suddenly used his heel to make an inverted triangle Pass.

The ball just passed between Naldo’s legs, and zujare s charged out from the middle and received the ball with an angry shot.
