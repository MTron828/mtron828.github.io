3119 Family dinner (3)

In front of Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue, song Qiming naturally did not put on any airs as a leader of a province or city. He was completely a cheerful uncle next door.

He took a sip of his juice and asked,””Qingxue, how’s the development of your Ling Ji restaurant? I noticed that you guys seem to have participated in the bidding for the canteens of several universities?”

Ling Qingxue was a little surprised. She did not expect song Qiming to pay attention to such a small matter.

The Ling’s F & B group had been taking a multi – faceted development route in the past few years. While they continued to develop in the mid – range F & B market, they had also opened several high – end private restaurants. In addition, they were also actively participating in cooperation projects with some college canteens.

Song Qiming was talking about the bidding projects that Ling Ji F & B had recently participated in for the canteens of several provincial high schools.

“Thank you for your concern, uncle song,” Ling Qingxue said. “Everything is going quite smoothly. The economic situation in the southeast province is quite good now, and there’s also great potential in the food and beverage industry. The management of our Corporation is quite confident. I’m not the one following up on the University food and beverage project, but I heard that it’s going quite smoothly. If there are no accidents, we should be able to reach a cooperation. ”

Song Qiming smiled and nodded.””This is a good thing! If a star company like Ling’s restaurant enters a University, it’ll be of great help to improve the standard of the university’s food and beverage. ”

It was only a family dinner and not in song Qiming’s office, so he only had a casual chat and did not go too deep.

Furthermore, Ling Qingxue clearly had no intention of using him to take any shortcuts, so he nodded in approval.

If it was an ordinary merchant, they would do everything they could to get involved with him. Since he took the initiative to ask, wouldn’t the other party immediately follow up?

Song Qiming thought to himself,’as expected of RUO Fei’s girlfriend, she’s so open and honest!’

This was pure love for the house and its Crow.

Then, song Qiming chuckled and said,””Ruofei, where’s your paradise Corporation? You’ve been developing well recently! You’re already a star company in Sanshan city, especially the two products of Yushi cream and heart – nourishing soup, which have long been well – known at home and abroad. It’s no exaggeration to say that you’re a star company in Sanshan!”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”It’s all thanks to President Feng and the others. I rarely manage the company’s Affairs.”

“I’ve heard from Deputy Mayor Hao that you’re the one who handles all the government affairs. You’re always so elusive, Chairman Xia!” Song Qiming laughed.

Xia ruofei laughed in embarrassment and said,””You’re talking about the key enterprises supported by the city this time, right? Director Feng has already reported to me that the city has been giving us a lot of support. I’ve always wanted to express my gratitude!”

Song Qiming waved his hand and said,”this is what the government should do. Star companies like yours should be supported more!” Besides, you don’t have to thank me. I didn’t interfere in the entire matter from the beginning to the end. The selection process was also fair and open. All the treatment and policies are what you deserve. ”

“No matter what, our paradise Corporation has received a lot of policy support because of this!” Xia ruofei said,”especially the land acquisition for the park project. The city’s support is too strong. CEO Feng can’t believe it ...” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Song Qiming laughed and said,”then focus on developing your business. You guys will create more taxes and jobs for the city. That will be the greatest support for the work in the city!”

“That’s for sure!” Xia ruofei said,”the park project is a project that will involve a lot of infrastructure construction. In the end, won’t it still be digested by the enterprises in the city? Moreover, the expansion of the pharmaceutical factory could also produce many new jobs and solve many employment problems. Even our company’s headquarters are doing a mass recruitment, preparing to launch our own online shopping center. ”

“Then shouldn’t you spend more time and effort on the company?” Song Qiming smiled and said,”I see that you haven’t been at Sanshan for a long time. Are you going to retire early? How can an old man like me, who’s still working so hard at my age, bear this?”

Xia ruofei smiled awkwardly and said,””Uncle song, you’re always worrying about our country’s national affairs. I’m different from you. Paradise Corporation is just a small company, and President Feng and the others are all outstanding enough. Now that the company is on the right track, it doesn’t make much of a difference whether I’m around or not.”

“Dad!” Song Wei pursed her lips and smiled. RUO Fei still had many things to do! He’s not just busy with paradise Corporation, you’ll know in the future. ”

Song Qiming smiled and said,”it seems like there’s a lot of things I don’t know!” Hahaha! Then I won’t ask anymore. I don’t understand the things you young people do ...”

Xia ruofei thought to himself, there are so many things that you don’t know! For example, your daughter has already ...

Fang Liyun rolled her eyes at song Qiming.””You only know now! The children are just here for a meal and you have to nag for half a day about work. This isn’t your office in the municipal Party Committee. You should change your bad habit of being a teacher when you get home!”

Song Qiming accepted her advice and said with a smile,””Alright, alright, alright, let’s not talk about work!”

After that, song Qiming did not mention anything about work. He only chatted with everyone.

After dinner, Xia ruofei said,””Uncle song, why don’t we ... Have some tea in the study?”

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue’s eyes lit up, but they were also a little nervous. Even though they knew the effects of wild tea, song Qiming had only cultivated for a short period of time, and his cultivation level was low. They did not know what the effects of wild tea were.

Even the first heaven sect couldn’t afford to let a first Qi layer disciple drink wild tea.

Song Qiming chuckled and said,”the kind of tea you make before dinner?” The fragrance of the tea was really tempting! I’m going to have a good taste!”
