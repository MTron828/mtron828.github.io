Xia ruofei felt that he was in a good state. He added a few fancy movements in the process of tossing the ball. When the ball spun and fell, Xia ruofei’s feet quickly circled the football twice and then lightly padded under the football. The football suddenly stopped at his feet and did not move an inch.

Then, Xia ruofei kicked the ball up with all his strength. The ball flew up at least ten meters high, and it was not the kind of ball that went up and down.

Xia ruofei jogged a few steps towards the predicted landing point. At this time, the football also fell quickly.

Under the effect of gravity, the football fell faster and faster.

Everyone watched as Xia ruofei lightly touched the bottom of the ball with the tip of his foot. The ball immediately stopped as if it was stuck to Xia ruofei’s toes and did not move at all.

From the speed of the whizzing arrow to the moment when it obediently stopped on Xia ruofei’s toes, the change from extreme movement to extreme stillness had a strong visual impact.

Even the professional coaches and players couldn’t help but exclaim in admiration. Although the action seemed simple, it was actually a test of the control of the football. Even some professional football players might not be sure to stop the ball well when facing such a fast ball that went straight up and down.

Chinese fans often joked that some National Football players stopped the ball ten meters away. In fact, when they encountered some difficult balls, many professional athletes were not sure that they could stop it well.

Xia ruofei gently picked up the ball again. Then, before the ball fell to the ground, he bent his body, nocked the arrow, and kicked the bottom half of the ball.

The football suddenly flew out at an extremely fast speed, drawing a large arc in the air, and suddenly went into the net. When it fell, the football was still spinning at a high altitude.

Xia ruofei tossed the ball to the side of the field. The distance between the end line and the center line was almost the same. Although the training ground was a small field, he shot directly near the sidelines, and he used an outer instep arc. The trajectory of the football was almost perfect. Finally, it flew into the goal along the corner between the pillar and the crossbar.

It could be said that even if the goal was guarded by a goalkeeper, there was nothing he could do in the face of this kind of world wave that went straight into an absolute dead corner.

“Wow!”

“God, what did I just see …”

……

After the players took a deep breath, they couldn’t help but wonder if they were born to see a company boss wearing amazing sneakers, stretching more than a professional footballer, side – stepping near the sidelines and sending the ball directly into the goal. If luck was excluded, many people secretly compared the ball to themselves and sadly found that they might not be able to do it …

Wu Lei was the first to react. It wasn’t because he had a strong mentality. It was because Xia ruofei’s image and position in his heart had been deified. No matter what Xia ruofei did, he would not be surprised. In his heart, Xia ruofei was omnipotent.

So, Wu Lei was the first to cheer. Then, the players and coaches all reacted and applauded Xia ruofei’s wonderful performance.

Zhou leiyun and Ruby even gave Xia ruofei a thumbs up.

“Mr. Xia, I didn’t expect your footwork to be so good. Have you received professional football training before?” Ruby came forward and asked.

After Xia ruofei heard Jiang Xiaochen’s translation, he smiled and shook his head.””I only liked to play football when I was in middle school. I didn’t learn it systematically.”

Ruby couldn’t help but say with some regret,””I can see that your talent is quite good! If he had received professional football training from a young age, he would have definitely become a star player!”

Ruby suddenly reacted and smiled in embarrassment.””Of course, maybe it’s a good thing … If you play football, you won’t be so successful in your career …”

Ruby recalled that Xia ruofei was already a shareholder of the club. For a young man to be able to easily invest tens of millions of euros in a Football Club, his net worth must be in the hundreds of millions, and in euros.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

In comparison, what was the big deal about becoming a football star?

Even a top star like Messi could only earn about a few hundred million euros in his entire career. Xia ruofei was still so young. When he reached Messi’s age, his wealth would definitely not be lower than that.

And how many people could be Messi ‘s?

Xia ruofei chuckled.”It’s not necessarily a good thing for a hobby to become a career. But to be honest, the population of China is there. There are still many talented players. It’s just that because of the environment, many talented players did not end up on the path of professional football. Some people started to go downhill early and did not display their talent because of unscientific training or other reasons.”

Ruby nodded in agreement. In the past, he did not know much about Chinese football. He only knew that it was almost a football desert. When the club decided to bring in Wu Lei, he was a little disapproving, thinking that the commercial significance of the signing might far exceed the competitive level.

However, after getting in touch with Wu Lei and watching his training, Ruby’s perception of him changed.

“You’ve said a lot,” Ruby said.”I’ll suggest that the club visit China more often to investigate. If there are talented young players, they can be recruited into our youth training camp.”

“That’s a good idea!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Boss, let us see your footwork again!” A young player shouted.

After Jiang Xiaochen translated the player’s words to Xia ruofei, he said,””Director Xia, this player is called mark Rocca. He is a product of RCD Espanyol’s own youth training. He is only 21 years old this year, but he is already the core of the team’s midfield and an important point of the backfield. His straight passes are very accurate and can often tear open the opponent’s defense. Coach Ruby values this player very much.”

Xia ruofei looked at the young player in the number 21 Jersey and smiled.””If it doesn’t affect everyone’s training, then I’ll kick a few more times?”

Ruby saw that Xia ruofei was in high spirits and did not want to dampen his spirits. He immediately said,””This morning’s training schedule is a little loose. Mr. Xia, please show us your footwork again!”

Xia ruofei nodded. He pondered for a while, then asked Jiang Xiaochen to arrange for the staff to move a few human figures to the venue.

Everyone could tell that Xia ruofei was ready to attack the goal with a free kick.

However, everyone was still mumbling in their hearts because Xia ruofei had arranged for the dummies to be placed a little far away. They were almost 30 meters away from the goal.

The human wall was also very dense. Two human walls were formed by eight Dummies, which almost blocked all the shooting routes. This was almost impossible in a real game. There were only 11 people in the team. Besides the goalkeeper, if eight people were used to form a human wall, there would only be two people left. How could they defend?

Xia ruofei easily picked up a ball and walked over. He placed it at a position about thirty – two or thirty – three meters away from the goal. The position was relatively straight, almost directly facing the goal.

Those who had played before knew that the best distance for a truly threatening free kick must be more than 20 meters. This distance was just right for the force to be released, and there was enough space to make a curve ball. If it was too close, the ball would have already flown out before the arc could be drawn. If it was too far, both the accuracy and speed of the ball would be affected. Furthermore, the goalkeeper would have more time to react, and it would be difficult to pose a threat.

Moreover, the position had to be slightly off. It would be bad if the angle was too straight.

Xia ruofei’s current position was not only far away, but the angle was also very accurate. It was too difficult to shoot directly.

Xia ruofei stepped on the soccer ball and smiled at markeloka.””Rocca, are you interested in competing with a direct free kick to attack the goal from this position?”
