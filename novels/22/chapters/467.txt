Chapter 468: The Furious Liang Haiming (3)

Xia ruofei felt that something was wrong as soon as he got on the highway.

Through the rearview mirror, Xia ruofei saw an unremarkable black car appear a few hundred meters behind his car.

This was the third time the black car had appeared behind his car since he left the farm and went to the highway.

Although the car did not tail them, it was obvious to Xia ruofei, who was a tracking expert.

He was being followed! Xia ruofei frowned.

After he retired, Xia ruofei had offended many people. He did not know who the person who had followed him was and what his purpose was.

Xia ruofei remained silent, and the speed of the car gradually decreased.

The driver of the black car obviously had some experience in following people. He didn’t slow down immediately.

The distance between the two cars began to slowly close.

Xia ruofei glanced at the rearview mirror. As the car had slowed down, many cars had passed by Xia ruofei’s car on both sides. The black car was already behind Xia ruofei’s car. There were no other cars in between the two.

At this moment, an exit that could quickly circle around the city appeared in front of them. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

If Xia ruofei were to return to the city, he would have to go through at least four more exits before he could leave the swirling highway.

He drove the pickup truck as usual. However, just as they were about to pass the exit, Xia ruofei turned the steering wheel and hit the brakes.

The car grazed the exit guardrail and forcefully turned into the side road.

The defenseless black car drove straight past them.

A burly man in sunglasses in the black car slammed on the brakes and stopped the car on the emergency lane. Then, he began to reverse the car on the highway, ignoring the danger.

However, as the car behind him honked crazily and reversed into the side road, Xia ruofei’s pickup truck had already turned a few small roads and disappeared from his sight.

The big man in sunglasses was livid. While driving aimlessly, he took out his mobile phone and made a phone call. He said dejectedly,”Brother he, I lost him ...”

……

Xia ruofei’s expression was serious as he drove the pickup truck through a small road. After making a few turns, he went through another road and chose to stay away from the winding highway. He continued to drive towards the city from the old road.

Xia ruofei first took out his phone and called Qin Xiaojun, asking him to be on high alert and protect Feng Rao and pang Hao. Then, he called Lei Hu, who was guarding the farm, and asked him to take note of the farm’s security and to keep an eye out for suspicious people around the farm.

Xia ruofei trusted the retired soldiers of the Special Forces. As long as they were alert, no matter who the other party was, it would be difficult for them to gain any advantage.

He thought about it and continued to drive in the direction of the Jade Market. No matter who was following him or dealing with him, he would still respond to the changes by staying the same. He believed that the other party would not stop this time and would definitely come to his door again.

In fact, this was the case.

After Xia ruofei returned to the city, he soon realized that he was being followed.

This time, the other party seemed to be even more unscrupulous. He only used one car and followed Xia ruofei. When Xia ruofei turned left, he turned left. When Xia ruofei turned right, he turned right.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows and sneer.

If the Tiger doesn’t show its might, they’ll really think that I’m Hello Kitty!

Xia ruofei began to deliberately drive the car that was following them to a secluded area. There were many shanty areas in the south of the city. When he had just retired from the Army and sold his house to treat Hu Zi’s mother’s illness, he had rented this area and was very familiar with the terrain.

Xia ruofei drove around the city and stopped near a quiet alley.

He pushed the car door open, pretended not to notice, and strode into the alley.
