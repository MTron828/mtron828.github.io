Chapter 3646: Meeting an old friend in a foreign land (1)

Translator: 549690339

Tang Yitian had arranged for Zheng Yongshou and the people from paradise to stay at the park Yue hotel between the harbor Bridge and the Sydney Opera House. It was one of the most luxurious hotels in Australia – so Tang Yitian naturally wouldn’t be stingy to Xia ruofei’s friends.

The Park Hyatt Hotel was also very close to the city center. It only took about ten minutes to reach Sydney’s landmarks such as the historical block, the rock District Market, and the Museum of Contemporary Art.

Xia ruofei found a quiet place near the harbor Bridge to land the airboat. Then, he revealed himself and leisurely enjoyed the scenery as he walked towards the park Joy Hotel.

In a short while, Xia ruofei arrived at the entrance of the Park Hyatt Hotel. He walked through the lobby and was about to contact Zheng Yongshou when a surprised voice suddenly came from behind him.”Chairman? You’re also in Sydney!”

Xia ruofei turned around and couldn’t help but smile.””Liu Qian! Did your Department participate in the auction this time?”

Liu Qian was Feng Jing’s first assistant. She was very capable and quick – witted, so Feng Jing spent a lot of time and effort training her. She was later assigned to a specific Department for training, and if nothing went wrong, she would definitely be put in an important position in the future.

“I’m here with President Feng!”Liu Qian said with a smile.

“Oh? Does that mean you’ve changed your position again?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

“I was appointed as the Secretary of the Board of Directors some time ago.” Liu Qian said, a little embarrassed,”you and President Feng have been taking care of me very well…”

“That’s also because you’re capable enough to take on the new position. Otherwise, it’s useless no matter who takes care of you. 1 still know boss Feng quite well.” Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”by the way, you said that CEO Feng is here too? She’s a general manager, and she’s here to attend the auction!” “Yup! Director Feng has always placed great importance on the company’s brand building!” Liu Qian said,”this time, not only is President Feng here, but President Dong is also here!”

“Woof! This company’s senior management came in a group!” Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”Where are they now?”

“President Feng and President Dong should be having a meeting in the room to discuss the details of the auction.” Liu Qian said,”the second group of colleagues will arrive at the hotel in a while. 1 just came down to wait for them.

1 didn’t expect to meet the chairman … Why are you in Sydney?” We didn’t know about this beforehand!” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Hahaha! How can I leak my whereabouts?” Xia ruofei joked.

Then, he said,”that means there are a lot of old acquaintances coming to Sydney this time!” Then I’ll treat everyone to a meal later! It must be tough for everyone to travel all the way here for a business trip!”

“Really? That’s great!” Liu Qian cheered,”the chairman is treating us to a big meal. If everyone knew about this, they would definitely be overjoyed! Chairman, can 1 report your visit to the hotel to director Feng?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”report!” 1 just happened to be in Sydney and heard that everyone was here for an auction, so … I came here to visit you, but 1 didn’t expect you to come here in person, boss Feng and boss Dong!”

“Yes! Then I’ll give President Feng a call first!” Liu Qian said happily.

“By the way, how many people do you have?” Xia ruofei asked casually.

“The first batch only consisted of President Feng, President Dong, and me. The second batch consisted of slightly more people, including colleagues from the sales department, the legal department, and other departments. There are ten people in total.” Liu Qian said.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”then the 13 of you … Okay!” I know, go make the call!”

“Alright! Chairman, please take a seat and rest for a while!” Liu Qian said.

Then, she quickly walked to the front desk and used the phone to call Feng Jing’s hotel room. Although Yingluo’s phone was set up for international calls, the bill was still very expensive, so she tried to save as much as she could.

Xia ruofei sat down on the sofa in the hotel lobby. He looked around and waved at a capable young man in a navy blue suit.

The young man had been watching Xia ruofei from the corner of his eyes, so he quickly walked over.

He bent down in front of Xia ruofei and asked in a low voice,””Mr. Xia, may 1 know what you need?”

Xia ruofei’s memory was amazing. With just a glance, he could recognize that this capable and experienced Chinese young man had once appeared in Tang Yitian’s Manor. He was one of the many staff members, so this capable and experienced young man was obviously sent by Tang Yitian to provide service guarantee for the Paradise Corporation.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’m going to treat the employees of paradise Corporation to lunch this afternoon. Please help me make the arrangements. We’ll book a private room with a better environment at the restaurant in this hotel. Oh right, we have about 15 people, so the venue will be a little bigger.” “Understood!” The capable young man said without hesitation,”please wait a moment, I’ll arrange it now!”
