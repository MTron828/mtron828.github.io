Chapter 177: Travelling with the United States (1)

It was MA Xiong who called. He said apologetically,”Xia Sheng, I’m really sorry. There’s an emergency at the company, so we have to fly back to Hong Kong. I’ve already asked someone to book an afternoon flight for you and Youyou back to Sanshan city. I’m really sorry!” Xia ruofei quickly said,”it’s okay, it’s okay. Old Mr. MA, is your company’s matter urgent?” “It’s fine, it’s still under control. I’m just sorry that you and Youyou have to take the commercial plane ...”MA Xiong said with a smile. “What does it matter?” Xia ruofei said,”actually, we can book our own tickets. If you have something urgent, you can go back directly.” “I’ve already arranged for someone to make the reservation. The hotel car will send you directly to the airport in a while!” MA Xiong said with a bright smile. His voice was very calm. It seemed that even though the company’s matters were more urgent, he was still confident. Besides, they were a world – Class Financial Group. Even if there were problems that they could not solve, Xia ruofei could not help much, so he did not ask. “I’ve discussed with a few of my friends about Blake. We’ll keep an eye on him when we return to the port. I’ll let you know as soon as I get any news,” MA Xiong said. Xia ruofei was touched to see that MA Xiong did not forget about this small matter even though he had an urgent matter to attend to. “Mr. MA, it’s more important for you to deal with the company’s Affairs. You don’t have to worry about this!” He said. “Hahaha! I, MA Xiong, have never given up halfway!” MA Xiong laughed heartily.”You don’t have to worry about this. Just wait for my news!” “Alright, old Mr. MA, thank you!” Xia ruofei said. Not long after he hung up, the private butler of the Presidential Suite came to the room and respectfully informed Xia ruofei that the car to send him to the airport had been arranged and he could leave now. Hence, Xia ruofei went downstairs. The private butler had already completed the check – out procedures. Xia ruofei only needed to sign when he left the Presidential Suite. As for his simple luggage, it was naturally carried downstairs by someone. When they reached the first floor, the Rolls – Royce Phantom for the Presidential Suite was already parked at the entrance of the hotel. The private butler opened the door for Xia ruofei. After Xia ruofei got in, she opened the door to the passenger seat and got in. The Rolls – Royce Phantom started and drove directly to Hongqiao International Airport. A black Mercedes – Benz had just arrived at the entrance of the airport departure hall. The private butler opened the car door for Xia ruofei. When Xia ruofei lowered his head and got out of the Rolls – Royce Phantom, he saw Lu You getting out of the Mercedes – Benz next to him. “Lu You!” Xia ruofei smiled and greeted him. Lu You also saw Xia ruofei at the same time. The corner of her mouth twitched slightly, and she nodded her head lightly in response to Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei was also used to Lu You’s attitude. He just smiled and did not take it to heart. The private butler took Xia ruofei’s luggage from the trunk and handed it to Lu You’s entourage. Then, he respectfully bade Xia ruofei farewell and left. On the other side, MA Xiong’s entourage was carrying their luggage and leading them into the airport departure hall. They took Xia ruofei and Lu You’s identity cards and went straight to the VIP check – in counter to check in. Meanwhile, Xia ruofei and Lu You stood at the side and waited. Xia ruofei wanted to find something to chat about, but Lu You kept her head lowered and fiddled with her phone. She had no intention of responding to Xia ruofei, so Xia ruofei did not ask for a rebuff. As both of them only had their carry – on luggage, they didn’t need to go through the check – in procedures, so the entourage quickly got their boarding passes. A uniformed personnel in ground clothes led Xia ruofei and Lu You through the security check through the VIP passage. The entourage could only send them to the security check and wave goodbye to the two. When Xia ruofei saw Lu You bidding farewell to the Hengfeng group’s staff, he revealed a smile and was quite polite. The ground service staff led the two of them to the VIP waiting room, then politely left. There were only three to five people in the empty VIP lounge. Lu You pushed her luggage and found a seat far away from Xia ruofei. She sat down and continued to play with her phone. Xia ruofei smiled bitterly and shook his head. He didn’t know how he had offended this girl again. He felt that Lu You’s attitude towards him had improved a lot. Why did she back off now? A girl’s thoughts were really hard to guess. Monica and Lu You were the same ... Naturally, Xia ruofei would not invite ridicule on himself. He found a seat nearby and sat down. He took out a book from his suitcase and read it while waiting to board the plane. The two of them had met at the entrance of the airport Hall, but they had not spoken a word. The atmosphere was strange and awkward. After waiting for more than 20 minutes in the quiet VIP lounge, the boarding for Xia ruofei’s flight began. Hence, Xia ruofei put the book back into his small suitcase and walked towards the gate with his boarding pass. Xia ruofei saw Lu You walking over with her luggage, but he didn’t stop to wait. Instead, he took his boarding pass and passed through the gate and walked onto the covered bridge. This was his temper. Since Lu You wasn’t willing to talk to him, he naturally wouldn’t be in a hurry to court her. Xia ruofei did not look at the boarding pass carefully just now. He only realized that MA Xiong had booked a first – Class ticket for him when he arrived at the cabin entrance. No wonder he had boarded earlier than the usual time. Furthermore, there was a first – Class flight attendant who immediately served him and led him to the first – Class cabin. Xia ruofei took out the books that he wanted to read during the journey and stuffed the small suitcase into the upper luggage compartment. The first – Class seats were very spacious, and Xia ruofei got a seat by the window. After he sat down, he adjusted the angle of the seat and found the most comfortable position. He leaned on the seat and casually flipped through the book. At this moment, Xia ruofei smelled a fragrance. He turned around and saw Lu You walking over under the guidance of the air stewardess. Lu You’s seat was actually right next to Xia ruofei ‘s. Xia ruofei thought about it and felt at ease. Their tickets were booked together, and the same person had helped to change the boarding passes, so their seats were definitely connected. Seeing that Xia ruofei’s seat was next to hers, Lu You didn’t say anything. She just frowned slightly and put her luggage away. She sat quietly beside Xia ruofei and started to play with her phone. One of them was reading a book while the other was on her phone. Neither of them said a word. About half an hour after boarding, the passengers in the economy Class had all boarded and the cabin door closed. After waiting for a while, the plane started to slide out. When the plane was moving forward on the runway, Xia ruofei put the book aside, leaned back in the chair, and closed his eyes to rest. The plane entered the runway, accelerated, and took off. When the plane was still rising at a higher angle, Xia ruofei opened his eyes and saw that Lu You’s phone screen was still lit from the corner of his eye. Xia ruofei couldn’t help but turn around and remind her softly,”Lu You, you have to turn off your phone during the flight ...” Xia ruofei’s expression changed when he was halfway through his sentence. He saw that Lu You was not playing with her phone. Instead, her face was pale and her brows were slightly furrowed as she leaned back in her seat. There was even a pained expression on her face.
