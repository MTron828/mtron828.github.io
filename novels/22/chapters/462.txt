Chapter 463: Spiritual Vulture (1)

Feng Rao’s Swift and decisive actions left a deep impression on Xia ruofei.

The next day at work, Xia ruofei asked Lei Hu to inform all the employees, including the workers at the vegetable greenhouse and even the two employees in the cafeteria, to gather in the meeting room on the second floor.

There were only about 20 employees in the company at the moment, so the meeting room wouldn’t seem crowded even if all of them were in it.

Xia ruofei announced that Feng Jing had officially joined paradise Corporation as the General Manager. He requested everyone to support Feng Jing’s work and obey her orders.

Following that, Feng Jing gave a brief introduction.

Feng Jing didn’t say much. She just wanted to say that from now on, she would be on the same side as her employees and that she was willing to work hard together to build a strong company. She also hoped that her employees would support her in her work.

After Feng Jing’s speech, the conference room erupted into a round of applause.

To Cao tieshu and the others, it was nothing to have another leader in the company. They were all working anyway, and the boss of the company was Xia ruofei. The benefits and treatment had not changed, so everyone was naturally at ease.

After Paradise corporation’s first staff meeting, Feng Jing pulled Xia ruofei, who was about to go downstairs with the employees, and handed over the recruitment proposal she had written last night.

Xia ruofei could not help but smile bitterly. However, he could not dampen his subordinate’s enthusiasm. He could only smile in satisfaction and return to his office with the report.

Feng Jing’s plan was very detailed.

The recruitment included two directors, the administrative Director and the marketing director. The requirements were relatively high, requiring a master’s degree in a relevant field and at least three years of experience in the relevant industry. Feng Jing offered an annual salary of 150000 Yuan.

In addition, they were recruiting five employees for administration and marketing, two for finance, and one general assistant. In total, they were recruiting ten people this time.

An ordinary employee’s monthly salary was 5000 Yuan, while a general manager’s assistant’s monthly salary was 7000 Yuan. The requirements for academic qualifications and work experience were naturally more relaxed than that of a director’s position. Only a bachelor’s degree or above was required, and there were no rigid requirements for working experience. Of course, those with relevant experience would naturally be recruited first.

Feng Jing also explained that even though the pay of ordinary employees was similar to that of farm workers, this was a common practice in many large companies. Frontline workers had more work to do, and many of them were paid more than office workers.

Moreover, there was a lot of room for the development of an administrative team. Feng Jing had even designed a set of performance evaluations that could measure each employee’s performance and give them a corresponding performance bonus every month. Of course, if the employee’s performance was poor, they wouldn’t even get the bonus and might even be fired.

However, overall, if the company’s performance got better, the salary of the first batch of administrative team members would definitely rise. In addition, the expansion of the company in the future would further refine the division of labor. For example, the administrative department would gradually build a Human Resources Department, a training department, a customer service department, and so on. If this batch of employees did a good job, they were likely to become the managers of small departments in the future.

In addition, although Taoyuan farm was located in a remote area, it provided free employee apartments, which was naturally very attractive to young people.

Xia ruofei looked at the long list of pages. He couldn’t imagine that Feng Jing had spent one night to come up with this.

Xia ruofei was more and more convinced of the General Manager’s ability.

Feng Jing had also placed a form at the top of the recruitment plan, with the Chairman’s opinion written in the column.

In Feng Jing’s words, if the company wanted to be standardized and systemized, she had to start now. She had to report this plan to Xia ruofei and get his official approval before she could start working.

Feng Rao was putting herself in the right position, so Xia ruofei naturally wouldn’t find it troublesome. Yingying only had to sign the papers, so how troublesome could it be? Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Xia ruofei took out a pen from his pen holder and wrote “agreed” with a wave of the big pen. Then, he signed his name.

After signing the proposal, Xia ruofei did not immediately hand it over to Feng Jing. Instead, he picked up the phone on the table and called Wu Liqian.

Over the phone, Xia ruofei sincerely expressed his gratitude to Wu Liqian. Up until now, Xia ruofei was very satisfied with Feng Jing’s work. Naturally, he had to express his gratitude to Wu Liqian for being the one who had recommended him.

Then, Xia ruofei mentioned that he was going to rent more land to expand his farm.

Wu Liqian agreed without hesitation. She told Xia ruofei that she would inform jianggang town immediately and ask Xia ruofei to go to the village council to get ruan Fugui to approve the land.

Xia ruofei naturally said a lot of words of thanks before hanging up the phone.

After making the call, Xia ruofei made a call to Feng Jing’s office and said,””President Feng, I’ve finished reading your proposal. Come and get it!”

“Alright, I’ll be right there!” Feng Rao immediately said.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and took out another Jade skin cream from the spirit map space. Then, he opened the drawer of his desk and put it in.

Very quickly, there was a knock on the door. Xia ruofei said loudly,””Please enter!”
