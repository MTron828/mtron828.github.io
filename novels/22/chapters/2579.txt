Xia ruofei looked at song Qiming in amusement. The black – haired song Qiming looked young and strong. He did not look like an ‘old man’ at all! However, from the look of helplessness on song Qiming’s face, it was obvious who was the master of the house.

Song Qiming said,”ruofei, don’t just stand there and talk. Let’s sit over there!” Um ... Liyun, didn’t you say that you wanted to show off your cooking skills? You can go! I’ll greet RUO Fei!”

Fang Liyun slapped her head and said,”yes, yes, yes!” I’m so happy to see RUO Fei, there’s still a lot of things to do in the kitchen! Ruofei, chat with your uncle song for a while. I’ll go cook for you!”

“It’s been hard on you, aunt Fang!” Xia ruofei said.

Fang Liyun waved her hand and laughed,”you silly child!” What’s so hard about cooking? Quickly go over and sit for a while! Don’t just stand there!”

Then, Fang Liyun went into the kitchen while song Qiming led Xia ruofei to the living room and sat down. He personally arranged the tea set and made tea for Xia ruofei. He smiled and said,””Ruofei, you’ve caused quite a stir on your trip to Spain!”

Xia ruofei knew that song Qiming was referring to the time when he played for RCD Espanyol, so he smiled and said,””This matter ... Is also a coincidence. The earliest we met was in Beijing, on the day of our paradise gathering’s opening. I had a chat with President Zhou of glory world Corporation, and then ...”

Xia ruofei briefly told song Qiming about his purchase of shares in the Spanish club, his vacation in Spain to reward his employees, and his decision to register as a player on a whim to join the team and play a game.

Song Qiming laughed and said,”I say! Why is a Big Boss like you working so hard and even playing football ... You don’t lack that little bit of money, do you? This is your family’s business!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it’s mainly a hobby!” When I was studying, I liked to play football. After I joined the Army, I played football with my comrades every week. I didn’t have much time after I retired. ”

“You’re a person who’s good at creating miracles. ” Song Qiming said,”if it were someone else who had never received any systematic professional training and was already 27 years old, it would be unimaginable for them to suddenly appear in the world’s top professional league. However, all of this seems to be so logical when it happens to you. ”

“That’s too high of an evaluation ...” Xia ruofei said, a little embarrassed.

“I’m not trying to flatter you,”song Qiming waved his hand. Ruofei, I’ve known you for quite some time and have seen you create many miracles. Whether it’s the Bureau chief’s illness or my injury from a while ago ... Other than you, no one else could have done it. ”

Song Qiming continued,”from a business point of view, you’re killing two birds with one stone by buying the shares of this Espanyol club!” Especially when you joined the team and played an amazing game, that was even more amazing. As long as this momentum is maintained, whether it’s glory world Corporation or your paradise Corporation, it’ll be extremely beneficial. This Zhou leiyun sure has sharp eyes!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Director Zhou is a good person. You know how to please others.”

“Hahaha! In the business world, this is considered a fair and just method!” Song Qiming said,”nowadays, some businessmen are keen to invest in the ‘good’ of certain leaders. It’s worth being wary of ...”

Song Qiming’s thoughts were a little scattered, but this involved a sensitive issue. Xia ruofei did not answer and only smiled and nodded.

Song Qiming obviously knew that it was not appropriate to talk about this with Xia ruofei. Besides, Xia ruofei obviously did not care about politics, so he quickly changed the topic.

The two of them chatted for a while before Xia ruofei took the initiative to say,””Uncle song, it looks like you’re recovering well! However, I still want to give you a comprehensive examination to prevent any hidden dangers!”

“You’re so kind ...” Song Qiming said,”ruofei, you’re a doctor. I’ll do whatever you want me to do!” Do you need to change locations?”

“Oh, there’s no need for that ...” Xia ruofei said.”Chinese medicine is all about looking, listening, asking, and feeling. It’s fine here! I’ll take your pulse first!”

“Alright!”

Song Qiming extended his hand in cooperation. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Xia ruofei felt song Qiming’s pulse and closed his eyes to feel his pulse.

Although the main purpose of coming to song Qiming for a check – up was not to do so, Xia ruofei was not pretending. He still analyzed song Qiming’s pulse seriously and even used his spiritual power to do a comprehensive physical examination of his body.

Even though he could tell with a glance that song Qiming’s body was recovering well, he still did not let his guard down. On one hand, he wanted to check if there were any hidden injuries. More importantly, he wanted to see if song Qiming’s physical condition was suitable for cultivation.

The most important task of his visit today was to help song Qiming start cultivating the ruoxu Heart Sutra.

Yesterday, Xia ruofei had thought about it and felt that it was not a good plan to let Song Wei come back and show her affection or to show off some of his cultivation skills.

So, he eventually chose a more secure way to use his identity as a doctor.

There was no doubt that song Qiming had absolute trust in Xia ruofei’s medical skills, especially after the emergency treatment and the near – Death experience. He trusted Xia ruofei even more. He would not doubt Xia ruofei’s words at all.

What Xia ruofei needed to do was to use his identity as a doctor to get this done without song Qiming knowing.

After a long time, Xia ruofei took song Qiming’s pulse and checked his tongue.

Finally, Xia ruofei said,”uncle song, it’s just as I expected. You’re recovering well!” There were no hidden dangers in the injured area. If nothing unexpected happens, you’ll definitely pass this test. You’re bound to have good fortune after surviving a great disaster. I’ll congratulate you in advance!”

Song Qiming laughed and said,”after what happened last time, I’ve come to terms with it. The future isn’t important. As long as the family is healthy, that’s more important than anything else!”

“That being said, wouldn’t it be better if there were better opportunities and a higher platform for you to realize your political ambitions?” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Generally speaking, this kind of topic was a little sensitive, especially when it came to song Qiming’s level.

However, song Qiming did not treat Xia ruofei as an outsider. He did not hide anything and laughed. “That’s even better! It’s just that after that incident, my mentality has become a lot more free and easy. I’ll be lucky if I get it, but if I don ‘t, it’s my fate!”

“This kind of mentality is very good! It’s easier to lose your cool if you worry about gains and losses!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Then, he changed the topic and said,”Uncle song, although you’re recovering well, the serious injury last time has damaged your body’s Foundation, so I suggest you continue to receive treatment,”

That was lying through his teeth. How could song Qiming’s body be damaged after being repaired by the precious petals of the spirit Heart Flower? Not only was he not injured, but because of the magical effects of the heart concentrating grass, he even had a physique that could cultivate now.

However, song Qiming believed Xia ruofei’s words. He did not expect Xia ruofei to lie to him.

Therefore, song Qiming’s expression turned serious when he heard that. He asked,””So ... There’s still a hidden danger in my body?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”uncle song, don’t be nervous.” Even if you don’t receive treatment, at most, your body will be a little weaker when you get old, and you’ll get sick from time to time ... For the quality of your life in your later years, I suggest you continue to receive treatment!”
