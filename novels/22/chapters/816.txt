Chapter 817: Aweto (2)

Translator: 549690339

Although this tea was very precious, there was an endless supply of it in the interspace. CEO Lin was an important business partner of Xia ruofei, so it was not a big deal to give him one or two taels.

President Lin was overjoyed when he heard this and thanked him repeatedly.

After he took a sip of tea, he couldn’t help but ask curiously,””Brother Xia, I’ve drunk a lot of Da Hong Pao tea, even those that cost tens of thousands per catty, but they can’t be compared to your tea! This ... Don’t tell me it’s the kind that’s specially provided for our leaders?”

Xia ruofei smiled and didn’t say anything. President Lin immediately said,””I understand, I understand...President Xia, this gift of yours is too expensive. I’ll be grateful for this!”

Xia ruofei laughed.”Let’s not talk about this. Let’s drink some tea!”

He was no longer a newbie who had just stepped out of society. He was not stupid enough to explain himself when chief Lin had such a misunderstanding.

Anyway, he didn’t say anything. It was all President Lin’s own guess.

However, with such a preconceived idea in President Lin’s heart, he believed that he would not dare to have the slightest bad intentions in future cooperation.

Everyone was drinking tea and chatting when President Lin suddenly asked,””Brother Xia, I know you have your own channels in the area of expensive medicinal materials, but I don’t know if you have any ways to get high – Quality Cordyceps sinensis? Our Tongren Hall also has a high demand for wormgrass. If it’s the top wormgrass, the price is even higher than that of iron maples!”

Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows and said,”Oh?” Is the price of aweto so good now?”

“Yup!” Mr. Lin said,”our Tongren Hall is selling a kind of high – Quality wormgrass, which is a pure natural wormgrass from the Nagqu City of Tibet. The price of a first – Class wormgrass is 16888 Yuan per box ... Brother Xia, there are only 50 grams in this box! That’s equivalent to 330 thousand Yuan per kilogram!”

President Lin took a sip of tea and continued,””Brother Xia, if you can get wormgrass of higher quality, the price will be much higher! Nowadays, high – end health herbs were in high demand but not in supply! There were more and more rich people. How was it? Brother Xia, are you interested?”

Xia ruofei smiled faintly and said,”I’ll go and understand the situation first.” We don’t know if there’s a supply of it now. ”

“Good, good, good!” President Lin said,”brother Xia, if you have good wormgrass, you must consider us first! Don’t worry about the price, our Tongren Hall will definitely satisfy you!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.

Xia ruofei had heard of aweto before, but he did not know it could be sold at such a high price.

However, he didn’t have a deep understanding of this medicinal herb, and he didn’t know if it could be cultivated artificially. Under the circumstances where everything was unclear, he naturally wouldn’t casually express his opinion.

Of course, Mr. Lin’s words had also increased Xia ruofei’s interest in aweto. He decided to find out more about it after he was done with his work.

After chatting for a while, Xia ruofei received a notification from the bank on his phone. The 5.8 million Yuan for the sale of wild ginseng had been transferred to his account.

Xia ruofei took a look at the message and smiled as he reached out his hand to President Lin.”President Lin, the money has been transferred to my account. Happy cooperation!”

“Happy cooperation!”

Xia ruofei had already ordered the canteen to prepare a banquet for President Lin. It was almost lunchtime, so he called President Lin and Dr. Huang to the company canteen downstairs for lunch.

At noon, Xia ruofei invited Feng Jing, Xiao Qiang, pang Hao, and the other management members of the company to sit at this table. CEO Lin had successfully bought two precious wild ginsengs this time and was in a very good mood. He did not refuse everyone’s toasts and was seventy to eighty percent tipsy after the meal.

The staff of Tongren Hall would not arrive until evening, so Xia ruofei asked pang Hao to arrange for someone to send President Lin and Dr. Huang to the guest room upstairs to rest. He then returned to his small villa.

Ever since Lin Qiao had two designers as her Masters, she was almost invisible every day. She would often be in the company office during her lunch break. Even when she came back, she would practice on her laptop.

As soon as Xia ruofei entered the room, he saw that Lin Qiao’s door was half open. Through the door, he could see Lin Qiao’s back sitting in front of the desk. She was carefully drawing the LOGO of paradise Corporation on the computer. This was probably homework given to her by her designer master to help her become more familiar with the operation of the software.

It was rare for Lin Qiao to be so enthusiastic. Xia ruofei naturally wouldn’t pour cold water on her. On the contrary, he was very encouraging. Hence, Xia ruofei didn’t disturb Lin Qiao and went straight upstairs.

However, Xia ruofei did not take a nap. Instead, he turned on his computer and started to look for information on aweto. After CEO Lin finished talking in the morning, Xia ruofei was quite concerned about this matter.

No one would ignore something that could earn them a lot of money.

Xia ruofei brewed a cup of tea and placed it by his side. Then, he lit up a cigarette and smoked while browsing the internet. He was very relaxed. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

After some research, Xia ruofei had a basic understanding of the aweto.

It was because of this initial impression that Xia ruofei could not help but be amazed. He felt a sense of awe towards the work of nature.

Cordyceps sinensis was undoubtedly a very precious Chinese medicine. From the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine, it entered the lungs and kidneys. It had the effect of nourishing the lungs and kidneys. It could nourish kidney deficiency, soothe coughs, improve the lungs, and improve immunity. It was suitable for long – term consumption.

Xia ruofei did not know much about aweto and had always thought that it was just a type of herb that looked like an insect.

Only now did he know that he had been ridiculously wrong. The aweto really did have bugs.

Behind every aweto, there was a beautiful and mysterious story of the combination of animals and fungi.

In the middle of summer, in the Highlands above 3800 meters above sea level, the ice and snow would melt, and the bats and moths would leave thousands of eggs on the flowers. The bat moth larvae were infected by the Cordyceps fungus and continued to reproduce in the larvae, causing the larvae to be full of mycelium. The larvae infected by the fungus gradually wriggled to a place two to three centimeters above the ground and died from head to tail. This was the “Cordyceps.”

Although the larvae were dead, the fungus in their bodies grew day by day until it filled the entire insect body. At the end of spring and the beginning of summer next year, a purple – Red blade of grass would grow out of the head of the insect. It would be about two to five centimeters tall and would be known as the ‘summer grass’.

Therefore, every aweto was made up of two parts that were combined together.

It could be said that the aweto was the perfect combination of animals and plants. There were only worms and no grass, so it was not the aweto. There were only grass and no worms, and it was not the aweto.

Of course, Xia ruofei also understood that this precious Chinese medicine had yet to achieve effective artificial cultivation and large – scale production of its spores. In other words, no one had been able to artificially reproduce the authentic aweto.

However, there was another type of Cordyceps that had similar medicinal effects that had been artificially cultivated. The Cordyceps was also a type of Cordyceps that belonged to the fungi clan, but they were different species.

In terms of medicinal effects, the northern wormgrass couldn’t be compared to the real Cordyceps, but this kind of wormgrass had already been artificially cultivated and could meet the huge market demand.

The truly high – end people naturally still favored the traditional aweto.

Xia ruofei carefully studied the manual cultivation method of the northern Cordyceps and the formation principle of the traditional and authentic Cordyceps. He felt that it was possible to cultivate and breed the Cordyceps in the spirit map space.

Of course, Xia ruofei still had to make a trip to the traditional wormgrass production area because only there could he find the bats and moths that produced wormgrass and the land that was rich in wormgrass and fungi.

It was Midsummer, the season when bats and moths laid their eggs. This was the perfect time to create an artificial cultivation environment for Cordyceps in the spirit map space.

Xia ruofei turned off his computer and mumbled to himself,””It seems that I really have to find time to make a trip to Tibet!”
