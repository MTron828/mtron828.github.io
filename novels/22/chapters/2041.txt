2042 A windfall (1)

Xia ruofei opened the email and took a look. He couldn’t help but gasp. If he wasn’t still in the car, he would have cried out in surprise.

It was an email from the bank he had opened an overseas account. The content was simple. Ten minutes ago, a sum of money had been wired into his account. The amount was...270 million! And the unit of measurement was ... Euro!

What was going on? A windfall? Xia ruofei couldn’t help but think to himself.

He looked at the email carefully. The huge amount of money had been transferred in by a trading company called Lehmann.

It was an unfamiliar company name. Xia ruofei was sure that he had never heard of this company before.

However, this was normal. It was likely that this was a shell company set up in Cayman Islands as a tax – avoiding paradise. The real controller behind it couldn’t be found just by looking at the company information.

Who on earth had transferred such a large sum of money to him? Xia ruofei was also puzzled.

With such a large amount of money, it was impossible to have been transferred by mistake. First of all, it involved 200 to 300 million euros. The probability of a low – Level mistake during the transfer was almost zero, and the bank had to confirm it repeatedly before the money was transferred.

He thought about it but couldn’t think of a clue.

“Sir, we’ve arrived!”

The taxi driver’s voice brought Xia ruofei back to her senses. She looked over and saw that the car had stopped at the entrance of the courtyard house in liuhai Lane.

“Oh! Thank you!” Xia ruofei said as he took out a hundred Yuan bill from his wallet and handed it to the driver.

After getting out of the car with his small suitcase, Xia ruofei walked to the gate of the courtyard house and stood still. After a while, the iris recognition door lock opened automatically and Xia ruofei pushed the door open and entered.

Outside the door, the taxi driver turned his head and couldn’t help but look at the magnificent siheyuan gate again. He thought to himself, this guy really wasn’t bragging in the car just now! Other people really only had a lot of rooms! Such a large courtyard house in the central Urban area must cost hundreds of millions ...

When Xia ruofei entered the first courtyard, Wu Qiang had already come out to welcome him.

The security system of the entire courtyard house had been upgraded. There were many cameras installed on the four walls, and the access control system was also integrated. When the front door opened, Wu Qiang was notified immediately. Although it did not open abnormally, he still checked the surveillance camera at once. Naturally, he realized that Xia ruofei had returned and quickly came out to welcome him.

“Boss, you’re back!” Wu Qiang greeted as he took Xia ruofei’s luggage.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””How’s the family these few days?”

“Everything is normal!” Wu Qiang said.

The two of them passed through the moon gate and arrived at the second courtyard where Xia ruofei lived.

Even though they had not stayed there for a few days, the yard was still spotless. Xia ruofei pushed the door open and entered the house. He realized that the house was very clean and tidy.

He did not inform them in advance that he was coming back today. It was obvious that Wu Qiang, Wu Xiujuan, and Xia Xiaolan had worked very hard and were very meticulous.

“Let’s get Mrs. Wu to prepare something light for lunch!” Xia ruofei took off his coat and hung it on the coat rack as he said,”buy more ingredients tomorrow. Brother Zhao and the others will come over for a small gathering!”

“Alright!” Wu Qiang replied,”boss, do you have any specific requirements for the ingredients?”

“Pick the good ones! Don’t be afraid of spending money. ” Xia ruofei said,”why don’t we go to the Sam’s Club to buy some? Try your best to pick our paradise brand’s ingredients. If the company doesn’t have any products, just pick the best!”

“Understood!” “Alright.” Wu Qiang replied,”then you should wash up and take a rest first. I’ll call you when lunch is ready!”

“Mm! Go!”

After Wu Qiang left, Xia ruofei took a bath and walked out of the bathroom feeling refreshed.

The heater in the house was on, and Xia ruofei had almost fallen asleep in the jacuzzi.

He had been busy and on the move for the past few years, so he could be considered to have stolen half a day of leisure. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

However, he was still thinking about the 270 million euros in his overseas account, so after soaking for a while, he got up, put on a bathrobe, and went back to his bedroom.

While he was taking a bath, Xia ruofei had thought about it and felt that there was something fishy about the money. Hence, he wanted to find out the background of Lyman company first.

After returning to the bedroom, Xia ruofei was about to call Li Yifu and ask him to check on the direct line of Lyman company. However, when he picked up his phone, he realized that he had a missed call. It was from Li Yifu.

Hence, Xia ruofei did not even think and called back.

“Senior granduncle!” Li Yifu answered the phone in the shortest time possible, his attitude as respectful as ever.

“Foster husband, you called me just now?” Xia ruofei said,”just in time. I have something to discuss with you!”

Li Yifu didn’t have time to talk about his own matters and quickly said,””Martial granduncle, please give me your orders! This disciple will definitely do his best!”

“It’s not that serious!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”help me check the background of a company called Lehmann. Just now, a sum of money was inexplicably transferred into my account. It was from this company! I don’t know what’s going on ...”

Hearing this, Li Yifu’s tone suddenly became a little strange, or rather a little embarrassed. He said,””That ... Martial granduncle! Lehman was a shell company under the Hong sect ...”
