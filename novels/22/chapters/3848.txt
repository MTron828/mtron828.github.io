Chapter 3849  Reaching an agreement (2)

  Xia ruofei smiled."Of course. I'm not planning to hide anything from you."

  Chen Nanfeng was overjoyed. He quickly said,""I'd like to hear the details!"

  At this moment, Chen Nanfeng had completely treated Xia ruofei as an equal. He even felt that he was a head lower than Xia ruofei.

  In fact, this was the case. Both of them were at the beginning stage of the nascent soul realm, and Xia ruofei's aura was clearly much stronger than Chen Nanfeng 's. Furthermore, there might be a mysterious and powerful cultivator behind Xia ruofei. Chen Nanfeng could not compare to them.

  Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,""Sect leader Chen, what I'm going to say next is my own judgment based on certain facts. I can't guarantee absolute accuracy. In addition, this matter is of great importance. I hope that sect leader Chen can keep his mouth shut after we leave this room. After all, if some news gets out, it will only cause panic and have no meaning. "

  "I understand," Chen Nanfeng said immediately."Don't worry, fellow Daoist Xia. This matter will end here with me. I definitely won't spread it!"

  Xia ruofei nodded and said,"according to my judgment, the entire cultivation world, or even the entire earth, had been facing an unknown crisis since 200 to 300 years ago. At that time, the crisis was imminent. Therefore, all the cultivators above the nascent Soul Stage in the cultivation world had left earth in full force to deal with this crisis!"

  Chen Nanfeng couldn't help but take a deep breath and said,""So, the continuous deterioration of the environment in the cultivation world is also related to this crisis?"

  Xia ruofei nodded and said,"it should be. Our ancestors built a barrier for the cultivation world on earth. However, this barrier can only barely hold on and can't completely isolate this crisis. Therefore, the cultivation world's environment is still affected and has been deteriorating. It can be imagined that the seniors of the cultivation world who resolutely left earth a few hundred years ago are likely to have been carrying out a very difficult resistance all this time!"

  Chen Nanfeng nodded silently. He knew that since Xia ruofei had said it, it must not be baseless speculation or nonsense. Just like what Xia ruofei had said, there must be some evidence.

  Xia ruofei's words caused a huge wave in his heart.

  However, Xia ruofei did not tell Chen Nanfeng about his experience in the North Pole. After all, he did not know what the seniors in the world of cultivation had planned. In fact, he did not know Chen Nanfeng's character in depth. If Chen Nanfeng really went to the North Pole to investigate, Xia ruofei did not want to see him ruin the seniors 'plan or get into danger himself.

  After a long while, Chen Nanfeng finally said,""Fellow Daoist Xia's words are truly earth - shattering! Thinking back to the past ... Even when I was in the late jiedan stage, I was called the number one in the cultivation world, and I was actually a little self - satisfied, now that I think about it, it's really a bit ridiculous!"

  "Sect leader Chen, you're being too serious ..." Xia ruofei said.

  Chen Nanfeng waved his hand and said,"all these years, we've really been like frogs at the bottom of a well ... Let's not talk about it anymore!" Fellow Daoist Xia, did you hear this from your master?"

  Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment, but he soon realized that most of the people in the cultivation world, including Chen Nanfeng, had guessed that he had a master with extremely high cultivation. Some of the rumors even made it sound real.

  Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,""Master didn't tell me all of this personally, but ... I can only say that my speculations have a certain basis and should be very close to the truth!" Zhang xuan replied.

  Chen Nanfeng nodded, then couldn't help but ask,""Fellow Daoist Xia, if I may ask, what is your master's current cultivation level?"

  "I'm just a little curious," he explained."If it's not convenient for you to tell me, then forget it. It's fine!"

  Xia ruofei laughed and waved his hand. "There's nothing that I can't tell you, but I'm afraid sect leader Chen will be disappointed. Actually, I don't know what master's cultivation level is now. He has never mentioned this before ..." Chen Nanfeng agreed to Xia ruofei's request to borrow the seven Star Pavilion without hesitation.

  He said,"of course, there's no problem with using the seven Star Pavilion!" The disciples of the first heaven society don't use the seven Star Pavilion very often, so we usually gather a certain number of disciples and open it again. If fellow Daoist Xia has such a request, I can open the seven Star Pavilion alone!"

  Chen Nanfeng was obviously more concerned about what Xia ruofei had said about the deterioration of the cultivation world and the mysterious disappearance of high - Level cultivators. He quickly asked,""Fellow Daoist Xia, what information do you have about the sudden disappearance of those seniors at the nascent Soul Stage and above a few hundred years ago? Is it convenient for you to share?"

  Xia ruofei smiled."Of course. I'm not planning to hide anything from you."

  However, Xia ruofei did not tell Chen Nanfeng about his experience in the North Pole. After all, he did not know what the seniors in the world of cultivation had planned. In fact, he did not know Chen Nanfeng's character in depth. If Chen Nanfeng really went to the North Pole to investigate, Xia ruofei did not want to see him ruin the seniors 'plan or get into danger himself.

Even when I was in the late jiedan stage, I was called the number one person in the cultivation world, and I actually felt a little proud of myself. Now that I think about it, it's really a bit ridiculous!"

  "Sect leader Chen, you're being too serious ..." Xia ruofei said.
