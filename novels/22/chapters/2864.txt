2865 Run after pretending (2)

On the other hand, the Spanish players were all smiling as they walked to the sidelines, talking and laughing with each other. It was a stark contrast to the players of Herona.

Even though it was only the end of half the game, manager Ruby still stood on the sidelines to welcome his players and high – fived each of them in celebration as if the whole game had ended. He only turned to the locker room when the last player left the field.

……

The 15 – minute halftime passed quickly, and the players from both teams returned to the field under the lead of the referee.

At this moment, the fans in the stadium realized that Xia ruofei was not on the field.

The fourth official also raised the substitution card on the sidelines. At the same time, the Spanish number 14, merendo, also stood on the sidelines. After the fourth official showed the substitution card, merendo ran straight to the field as he did not need to wait for the player to be replaced to leave the field.

It was only then that everyone was sure that Xia ruofei had been replaced.

Not only did he not appear on the field, but he was also not even seen on the substitutes ‘bench.

The fans watching the game at the stadium and in front of the television could not help but feel a little regretful. With Xia ruofei’s hot form and his complete physical fitness, if they continued to play in the second half, they would definitely score more goals. The chances of getting four big happy goals and five goals were very high.

In the PP sports studio, Shen fangjian noticed the substitution and immediately said,””I’m a little surprised that Xia ruofei has been replaced. However, no one would think that Xia ruofei’s strength was only enough to play half the game. I even think that he should have asked to leave the field. After all, he had only used half a long time to show his strength and the team had long taken the lead. I guess he felt that it was meaningless to only bully noobs!”

“Although it’s a little disappointing, the fans must not go away,” Jia Tianning said with a smile.”There’s also a Chinese player, Wu Lei, on the field. He scored a goal in the first half and got three assists at the same time. His performance was quite eye – catching. However, in terms of the number of goals, he was slightly inferior to Xia ruofei’s hat – trick. I believe his performance in the second half is also worth looking forward to!”

“Right!” Shen fangjian said,”although Xia ruofei is not on the field and the RCD Espanyol’s offensive power in the front field will be reduced, Wu Lei’s characteristics are very distinct. His running position is quite outstanding and his sense of smell in front of the goal is also top – notch. Against a completely dispirited Herona, there’s still a full forty – five minutes. He definitely has a chance to score!”

Shen fangjian and Jia Tianning’s guess was right. Xia ruofei’s departure was indeed his own request. Otherwise, how would Ruby dare to replace him?

During the half – time break in the changing room, Xia ruofei told Ruby that he did not intend to continue playing in the second half. From Ruby’s point of view, he was still a little worried that Herona would lose in a fit of rage and would stoop to Xia ruofei’s level, the initiator of today’s tragedy! Xia ruofei was not only a core player of the team, but also a shareholder of the club! If he was crippled in the competition, he would really become a joke. Thus, Ruby happily expressed that he had the same intention. Then, he called merendo over and told him to go out and warm up in advance so that he could replace Xia ruofei in the second half.

There was no longer any suspense in this match, so Xia ruofei did not even appear on the court. Instead, he showered and changed in the changing room.

Of course, he didn’t forget to remind Wu Lei to bring back a game ball. Although he easily completed a hat – trick, it was still a real hat – trick, so he definitely had to bring a ball back as a memento.

When the Spanish Main players walked out of the field, Xia ruofei had already taken a shower and changed into the Spanish team’s yellow training suit. He quietly came out of the locker room and walked to the VIP box in the stands.

Along the way, Xia ruofei even changed his appearance slightly and lowered the brim of his hat. In addition, many of the fans were wearing the Spanish team’s uniform or training uniform. Xia ruofei’s outfit was not eye – catching at all, so the fans did not notice that the new king of the team, Xia ruofei, was walking past them.

Xia ruofei quickly arrived at the VIP box of the host team. Before he pushed the door open, he had already restored his original appearance.

In the private room, Zhou leiyun, Song Wei, and Ling Qingxue were discussing. They had also noticed the substitution and found out that Xia ruofei was not playing in the second half. At this moment, the door was pushed open by Xia ruofei. The three of them turned around at the same time. When they saw that it was Xia ruofei, they were all in disbelief and quickly stood up to welcome him.

“Why did you come here?” Song Wei asked with a smile.

“President Xia, you said you’d play a game to show your strength, but you haven’t finished playing yet!” Zhou leiyun chuckled and said,”and you’re not in the bench. You’re in the stands ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I’ve already made my opponent cry in the first half of the game. I’d be bullying him if I played again in the second half.” As for the replacement seats ... How could that place be more comfortable than this place? It’s just watching the game anyway, so it doesn’t matter where we watch it. ”

Xia ruofei then walked to a soft seat and sat down comfortably. He turned around and said,””Sit down and watch the game! The second half is starting!”

Ling Qingxue and Song Wei couldn’t help but laugh and shake their heads. They returned to their seats.

In the second half of the game, the morale of the Herona team was still low. Even though their manager had given everyone a lot of encouragement during the halftime interval and even made changes to the players, it still seemed to have little effect.

Without Xia ruofei, the Spanish team’s attack power and control of the midfield had declined. However, overall, the Spanish team still had the initiative.

Wu Lei was still very active, cruising between the defensive lines of Herona. His running was too flexible, which gave the players of Herona a headache.

Besides, with Xia ruofei’s support and his own hard work, Wu Lei was no longer isolated in the team. Everyone was getting more and more familiar with his characteristics. He often passed good shots to him and his running position was often responded to by his teammates.

However, when it came to passing, Xia ruofei’s pass was the most comfortable.

Without Xia ruofei, the Spanish team’s attack power dropped significantly. Compared to the first half, the game was a lot more dull.

However, Wu Lei’s relentless running still paid off. At the 63rd minute, Spain’s number 10, Dardell, made a long shot in front of the penalty area, causing the Herona goalkeeper to lose his grip on the ball. When Dardell shot, Wu Lei had already quickly inserted himself into the penalty area to make up for the shot.

And the football just happened to bounce in Wu Lei’s direction. He faced the incoming ball with the tip of his foot and gently poked it, and the football went into the net. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

After the goal, Wu Lei ran to the Billboard. The fans sitting in the front also reached out to him and shouted his name. Wu Lei also kissed the team emblem in front of the fans and suddenly gained a lot of good feelings.

The moment the goal was scored, the director in charge of the live broadcast immediately used the walkie – talkie to inform one of the cameras in charge of the grandstand area to quickly point the camera at the Spanish VIP box. They had long discovered that the Spanish boss, Zhou leiyun, was also watching the game live. So every time the Spanish team scored a goal, the broadcast camera would be aimed at this box.

After the slow motion replay of the goal, the director cut the scene to the VIP box after the goal was scored.

Naturally, Zhou leiyun stood up with a smile on his face and applauded his compatriot for scoring a goal. This scene was not surprising, but very quickly, the director in the stadium, the commentators in charge of the commentary, and the fans who were paying attention to the big screen in the stadium and the fans watching the game in front of the television all widened their eyes in unison.

That was because ... They saw Xia ruofei standing beside Zhou leiyun, clapping and laughing.
