Song Wei could not help but Pat Xia ruofei’s shoulder and said,”Are you looking for a beating?”

Xia ruofei raised his head and laughed,”then who asked you to do that?” It’s a win – win situation. Look at me, I didn’t want anything in return. I took the initiative to help song Rui match – make this happen ...”

“You two are just bad friends! If you don’t help him, who else will you help?” Song Wei pouted.

“Hey! Is there anyone who would talk about their own uncle like that?” Xia ruofei said,”I’m good friends with song Rui. Shouldn’t you call me ...”

“No way!” Song Wei was embarrassed.”Do you still want my help?” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“I want to, I want to!” Xia ruofei said,”then I’ll leave this to you! You can’t just do your job without putting in effort!”

Song Wei pondered for a moment and asked,”ruofei, are you sure my uncle song Rui is serious?” I ... I’m afraid that Yiyi will get hurt ... She might have graduated from University and is usually very carefree, but she’s actually very innocent, especially in terms of relationships. She’s like a blank piece of paper ...”

“Don’t worry,” Xia ruofei said seriously.”If song Rui dares to let Zhuo Yiyi down in the future, I’ll be the first to deal with him!”

Song Wei nodded her head heavily and said,”Alright, I’ll take this job!”

“This is right!” Xia ruofei said happily,”if the two of them really get together, it’ll be a great thing!”

“I can’t guarantee that I’ll succeed, but I’ll definitely try my best.” Song Wei said.

“There won’t be a problem if you do it!” Xia ruofei said confidently.

“You’re pretty confident in me, aren’t you?”Song Wei pursed her lips and smiled. But come to think of it, you’re so good at coaxing girls. If you just teach my uncle song Rui a few tricks, wouldn’t that silly girl Zhuo Yiyi be able to get her? Do you still need to come and beg me?”

“What are you saying!” Xia ruofei said,”I don’t know how to coax girls.”

“You’re still so modest!” Song Wei said with a half – Smile,”Lu you and I both saw it tonight! Good girl...You’ve managed to coax that little girl Shi Yang so much that she’s almost willing to devote herself to you ...”

“Hold on, hold on ...” Xia ruofei said hurriedly.”I’m just trying to liven up the atmosphere! Besides, I’m not just treating the stone puppet. Didn’t you see that Liu Zhe kept my prescription like a treasure?”

Song Wei couldn’t help but blush and laugh when she thought of Liu Zhe being teased by Xia ruofei.

At this time, the car had arrived at the municipal committee’s family courtyard. Xia ruofei felt as if he had been pardoned and wanted to continue the topic. Who knew what song Wei would say next!

He quickly jumped out of the car and opened the door for Song Wei.

Song Wei glanced at Xia ruofei and asked,””Do you want to go in and have a cup of tea? My dad hasn’t seen you for a long time. He was just talking about you yesterday!”

Xia ruofei quickly waved his hand and said,”next time!” It’s too late, let’s not disturb uncle song ...”

“Alright then!” Song Wei laughed. Thank you for sending me! Goodbye!”

After she finished speaking, Song Wei walked towards the small villa.

“Don’t forget what I’ve just told you!”Xia ruofei said.

“Don’t worry!” Song Wei waved her hand and said without turning her head.

Xia ruofei watched as Song Wei entered the courtyard. Then, he got back into the car and started the engine to return to the farm.

As the car was on the road, Xia ruofei tapped the steering wheel lightly and muttered to himself,””Hey! How could I have forgotten about the ancient tomb? It’s all Song Wei’s fault for always interrupting ...”

The world stone was very important to Xia ruofei. However, he knew that the ancient tomb had been sealed off after the incident. Furthermore, the tomb was filled with an invisible and odorless ‘poisonous gas’. No one would be able to get there in a short period of time.

In addition, the Jade skin cream and heart – nourishing soup would be on the market in a few days, so it was indeed not suitable for him to go far at this time.

Since he didn’t have the time to mention it this time, he would find another opportunity next time! Xia ruofei said in his heart.

He stepped on the gas pedal as he thought about it. Knight XV made a powerful roar and sped out of the city.
