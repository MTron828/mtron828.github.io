Chapter 1643: A sharp turn for the worse (1)

Zhou Tianyu grabbed manager Wu and asked him for a while. He got the details of the situation intermittently.

He slumped into his chair and waved his hand weakly.””You can leave first! Take a good rest these two days and recover your spirit!”

“Alright, director Zhou!” Manager Wu said gratefully.

Zhou Tianyu said again,”tell the workers at the construction site to retreat!” We won’t start work for the time being! Remember, you must seal off the news and not leak a single bit!”

“Understood!” Manager Wu said with a serious expression. I’ll immediately make the arrangements!”

Manager Wu knew very well that this kind of thing must not be spread. If the slightest bit of news was spread, the competitors would definitely hype it up. The reputation of this land would be completely ruined, and no one would buy the house even if it was built.

What Zhou Tianyu and manager Wu didn’t know was that no matter how tight they tried to hide it, they couldn’t resist the responsibility of someone helping to promote it.

What happened at the construction site these few days couldn’t be hidden from Zhao Yongjun and the others, who were always paying attention to the situation at the construction site. There were even spies bought by Zhao Yongjun and the others among the workers.

This was why although Zhou Tianyu was very careful and ordered to block the news, this news couldn’t be blocked no matter what.

Of course, Zhou Tianyu didn’t know about this. After he sent manager Wu away, he immediately picked up the phone on his desk and called Liu haofan.

The moment the call connected, Zhou Tianyu said eagerly,”Young master Liu, things are bad ... There’s a problem with the land in Xiaotang!”

Liu haofan said impatiently,””Old Zhou, what could go wrong? Wasn’t it just a matter of delaying the completion of the project? This isn’t the first time your Great Tang has coordinated something like this, and you still want me to come out and greet you?”

Liu haofan thought that Zhou Tianyu came to him for help because they had difficulties in controlling the land storage, so he felt a little sick of it.

Zhou Tianyu smiled bitterly and said,”not that!” Young master Liu, there’s a problem with the land itself ...”

“Is there a problem with the land transfer?” Liu haofan asked, then said lazily,”that’s just right! We don’t need it! I was just thinking that it was too expensive!” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Zhou Tianyu sighed and said,””No... Young master Liu, I’ll put it this way! There’s something dirty in the land we’re taking ... It’s ... It’s haunted!”

Liu haofan was silent for a few seconds on the other end of the phone, then said,””Old Zhou, are you still sleeping? Or are you too free at work and are here to make fun of me?”

Zhou Tianyu smiled bitterly and said,”my young master Liu!” How could I be in the mood to joke with you at a time like this! There might really be a problem with that piece of land ...”

Then, Zhou Tianyu told Liu haofan everything that happened in the past few days, including the haunted incident that manager Wu experienced last night.

Although Zhou Tianyu didn’t exaggerate or exaggerate on purpose, his objective description made Liu haofan feel a chill down his spine.

After listening to the story, Liu haofan’s voice changed.””Old Zhou, there’s really such a thing? Then what should we do?”

Zhou Tianyu said,”I’ve already told the people below to block the news. Then, I asked the workers to withdraw first!”

“Yes, yes, yes! Don’t let this spread, or this land will be ruined!” Liu haofan said quickly.

Zhou Tianyu nodded and said,”young master Liu, that’s the situation. What do you think we should do next?” Do you want to go to the scene ...”

“I’m not going, not going!” Liu haofan said hurriedly,”old Zhou, I don’t want to go to such an unlucky place!”

“Then ...”

“I’ll make use of the time to coordinate!” Liu haofan said,”if there’s really no other way, we can get the workers to do construction during the day. We can just build some simple buildings on top of it, and then this piece of land will be kept for the time being. Who knows, maybe it’ll recover by itself in a year or two?”

Zhou Tianyu thought about it and said,”that’s the only way ...”

They had originally planned to hoard land, but after this incident, Liu haofan was finally willing to go and coordinate with the relevant units on his own. With him, the young master of the Liu family, personally coming forward, it was too easy to exploit the loopholes in the policy.

With that, Zhou Tianyu was happy to relax.

As for whether the land would still be haunted after a year or two, that was a matter for the future. He could not think too much about it now.

However, although Zhou Tianyu and Liu haofan’s plan was very well thought out, in reality, their plans couldn’t keep up with the changes.

On the day Zhou Tianyu called Liu haofan, a post related to the haunted construction site in Xiaotang town appeared on the internet.

At first, it was still circulating on some local forums in Beijing, but soon, such posts were all over the internet. Before Zhou Tianyu and Liu haofan could react, it had already spread all over the internet.

Zhou Tianyu was shocked and angry, but there was no point in pursuing manager Wu’s responsibility or investigating the leak source. He could only find Liu haofan again in a hurry.

Liu haofan was also furious after hearing this. He slammed the table and said,””Old Zhou, how do you guys do things over there? You can even mess up such a small matter!”

Zhou Tianyu also knew that he was in the wrong this time, so he quickly said carefully,””Young master Liu, I was too careless this time ... The most important thing now is not to pursue responsibility, but to deal with the public opinion crisis as soon as possible. Otherwise, the reputation of this land will be ruined ...”
