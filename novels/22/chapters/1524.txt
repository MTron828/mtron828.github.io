Chapter 1525: Time (2)

Translator: 549690339

As expected, after Xia ruofei’s spiritual power entered Song Wei’s meridians, he quickly found the poison in her body. He was very familiar with this poison. It even had the aura of the realm stone. It could be said that he was right on the mark.

Xia ruofei did not hesitate to use the “great way of Dao” and transferred his Qi into Song Wei’s body. With the cooperation of his spiritual power, the poison was naturally exposed and was quickly burned into nothingness by the Qi.

Just as Xia ruofei was circulating the “great Dao chant”, the White realm Fox outside the cave seemed to have sensed something. It opened its eyes and looked into the cave.

However, it did not get up. It was not that it was not interested in the pure Qi, but it had already sensed that there was an invisible spatial barrier at the entrance of the cave. Only Xia ruofei could pass through it easily.

Without Xia ruofei’s permission, no one else could enter the cave, not even the realm Fox, the darling of the space.

The realm Fox quickly closed its eyes and began to comprehend the strange space rules. Xia ruofei used his true Qi to clean Song Wei’s body and used his spiritual energy to check repeatedly to make sure that nothing had escaped.

When Xia ruofei used his spiritual power to check on Song Wei, he felt that something was wrong. However, he could not find anything.

Xia ruofei shook his head in confusion and mumbled to himself,””Perhaps I’m being too sensitive?”

He let go of Song Wei’s hand and walked out of the cave with a tired look on his face.

“Master, the spirit nurturing soup is ready!” Xia Qing immediately said respectfully.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”thank you.”

He picked up the bowl of herbal soup with the fragrance of the spirit heart fruit and walked back to the stone room. He put the soup aside first, then went over to help Song Wei up and let her lean against the bed.

Xia ruofei tested the temperature of the soup and fed it to Song Wei.

People who had lost their minds could not be fed medicine like this because they would not be able to swallow it under such circumstances. However, Xia ruofei had his own way. He only needed to release a small wisp of essential Qi to wrap the medicine and send it directly into Song Wei’s stomach.

After feeding her the medicine, Xia ruofei carefully laid Song Wei flat and observed her condition.

Song Wei was still lying on the stone bed, motionless. The bowl of medicinal soup was like a stone sinking into the sea. There was no movement at all.

Xia ruofei could only wait.

The theory of the soul was vague, but Xia ruofei had been cultivating for a long time. He knew that the soul existed. When one’s cultivation was strong enough, even if the body was destroyed, the soul could still survive independently under certain conditions.

For example, the spirit that tried to possess Song Wei.

Unfortunately, Xia ruofei’s cultivation was still too low. He could not even check on the situation, let alone help Song Wei recover her soul.

According to the common knowledge in the world of cultivation, a person’s soul existed in the sea of consciousness. As an ordinary person without any cultivation, Song Wei’s sea of consciousness was quite fragile. Moreover, her soul was damaged. If Xia ruofei were to investigate rashly, there might be an unpredictable accident.

If the soup did not work, Xia ruofei really did not know what else to do.

He sighed and walked out of the cave.

“Master, what’s the situation?” Xia Qing asked.

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly.”There’s no change ... Xia Qing, other than the gestation soup, do you know of any other methods to help recover from soul injuries?”

The pregnancy soup could only be used once every seven days. Xia ruofei did not dare to let Song Wei take it continuously.

One of the main herbs used to make the pregnancy soup was the spirit heart fruit. If consumed alone, it would be highly toxic. Who knew what would happen if it was consumed continuously instead of seven days?

However, he found it hard to accept that Xia ruofei had to wait for seven days and then try his luck with a bowl of pregnancy soup.

Song Wei was going to start school soon. She had left the house on the pretext of traveling. If she did not contact her family for a long time, song Qiming and his wife would definitely notice that something was wrong.

The power of a vice – Minister was not to be underestimated. Once song Qiming used all his connections to find Song Wei, there was no way to hide the fact that he and Song Wei were in Xiang Nan Province. Even song Zhengping knew about it. There was no way to keep it a secret.

At that time, the situation would become difficult to deal with.

Moreover, Xia ruofei could not accept letting Song Wei continue to be in a coma.

Xia Qing’s face showed that she was in a difficult position.”Master, the effect of the spirit nurturing soup in the aspect of nourishing the soul is already very good. The main reason is that we have sufficient raw materials. As for the other methods ... The spirit herbs that can nourish the soul are very rare. Now that the outside environment is deteriorating, I’m afraid it will be even more difficult to find ...”

Xia ruofei looked disappointed and said,””So ... There’s no other better way?”

“Master,” Xia Qing said,”actually, the spirit nurturing soup should be effective. It’s just that miss song’s soul injury might be a little serious. One or two doses of medicine are definitely not enough ...”

“That’s the problem!” Xia ruofei said,”you can only take the soup once every seven days but Song Wei can’t be away for too long. There’s not enough time now ...”

At this point, Xia ruofei suddenly stopped and mumbled,””There’s not enough time...Time ...”

Then, he smacked his head and said,””How could I have forgotten about this?”

If he didn’t have enough time, he could just accelerate time!

At the Archean realm, time could be accelerated by 30 times. If Song Wei was placed inside for five hours (outside world time), she would have spent seven days in the Archean realm. After that, she could continue to consume the spirit nourishment soup.

He didn’t even need to reach the Archean realm. Xia ruofei still had array flags that could accelerate time even more quickly.

If the small area around Song Wei was covered by the time formation, it would be accelerated by at least 90 times.

This way, it would only take slightly more than an hour.

“Xia Qing!” Xia ruofei said to Xia Qing,”Xia Qing, immediately make another portion of the pregnancy soup!”

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing quickly responded.

Xia ruofei turned around and returned to the cave. With a thought, he sent the array flag from the Archean realm over. At the same time, he brought a few bottles of flower petal solution. Song Wei’s body definitely could not last seven days without eating or drinking. Hence, she still needed these flower petal solutions to maintain her vitality.

Xia ruofei first fed Song Wei half a bottle of the petal solution. He still used his essential Qi to wrap the petal solution and sent it directly into her stomach through her esophagus.

After waiting for a while, he checked on Song Wei’s condition and found that she was still alive.

Hence, Xia ruofei did not hesitate any longer. With a thought, he appeared on a flat grassland outside.

Beside him, there were array flags and a porcelain bottle that contained the solution of the spirit Heart Flower petals.

Song Wei was also moved out of the stone room in the cave. He carefully laid her flat on the grass.

Then, Xia ruofei grabbed the array flags and waved them. The eight array flags immediately occupied eight positions around Song Wei and accurately stabbed into the soil.

The next moment, Xia ruofei felt the difference in the flow of time.

He stood outside the formation to monitor Song Wei’s situation. After about 15 minutes, Xia ruofei teleported Song Wei out of the formation.

Fifteen minutes in the outside world meant that Song Wei had spent more than a day in the formation. Xia ruofei needed to replenish her energy.

He carefully fed Song Wei half a bottle of the spirit Heart Flower petal solution. After two minutes, the components of the spirit Heart Flower petal were completely absorbed. He then sent Song Wei into the array.

Just like that, every fifteen minutes or so, Xia ruofei would move Song Wei out to replenish the solution of the spirit Heart Flower petals and then send her back to the formation.

Although it was complicated, Xia ruofei did it seriously.

Before he knew it, more than an hour had passed.

Xia ruofei did a quick calculation. Song Wei had actually been here for at least seven days, maybe even eight.

He glanced at the cave entrance on the mountainside not far away and asked with divine telekinesis,””Xia Qing, is the spirit nurturing soup ready?”
