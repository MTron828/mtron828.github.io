Translator: 549690339

She didn’t expect Tang Yitian and his wife to be so close to Xia ruofei that they even took the initiative to invite him to dinner.

Moreover, Tang Yitian and Jennifer’s child even called Xia ruofei master.

What kind of person was Tang Yitian? He was a giant in the entire Australian retail industry, a world – Class rich man with tens of billions of dollars in assets! Moreover, Jennifer’s status in the entertainment industry was the same as Tang Yitian’s status in the business world. If she hadn’t retired at the peak of her career, she would have been a big sister – like figure!

As a professional in the field of Finance and Business Administration, Feng Jing was naturally familiar with the world’s business leaders. She was also very familiar with Tang Yitian’s situation.

As a Chinese, the fact that he was able to build such a huge business empire in Australia was something that Feng Jing admired greatly.

To think that her idol would appear right in front of her. Feng Jing felt as if she was in a dream.

Xia ruofei nudged Feng Rao lightly and smiled.””Big brother Tang, let me introduce you to Feng Jing, the General Manager of our paradise Corporation! Boss Feng, this is the Maya Group from Australia ...”

“Chairman, there’s no need for introductions!” Feng Jing came back to her senses and said with a smile,”the famous founder of the Mei ya group, Mr. Tang Yitian, and the world – Class star, Ms. Jennifer. How could I not know them?”

“Hello, President Feng!” Tang Yitian graciously extended his hand and said,”President Feng, you look young and promising! Ruofei’s company is full of vitality. I’m so envious!”

Feng Rao gently shook Tang Yitian’s hand and smiled,””You’re too kind, Mr. Tang. You’re a business legend! When I was an MBA student, my teacher used the 2001 merger and acquisition case of the Meiya group as a classic case to teach us!”

In 2001, through a series of dazzling operations, the Maya Group successfully acquired another large Australian retail company and completed absolute control, thus establishing its position as the Australian retail giant.

Tang Yitian was still proud of this case, so after hearing Feng Jing’s words, he laughed out loud and said,””That was a long time ago. When I was young, I dared to fight and risk my life. Now, I don’t have the same drive as I did back then ...”

“Mr. Tang is still very young! You’re too humble!” Feng Rao pursed her lips and smiled.

Then she also greeted Jennifer politely, pinched Tang Haoran’s face very affectionately, and praised him.

Unlike Lin Qiao, who was Jennifer’s hardcore fan, Feng Jing, as an excellent professional manager with a professional background, naturally admired Tang Yitian more. So, when facing the world – Class star Jennifer, she would not lose her composure like Lin Qiao.

After some small talk, everyone sat down.

Soon, the waiter came over with the menu.

“RUO Fei, miss Feng, what would you like to eat?” Tang Yitian asked with a smile.

“The guest does as the host wishes!” Xia ruofei shrugged his shoulders and said,”we don’t know much about this restaurant either. Brother Tang, you should keep an eye on it! But let me make this clear first! I didn’t bring my wallet today!”

Tang Yitian laughed and said,””Then I’ll help you order! The foie gras in Zola’s restaurant is very good. You can try it later!”

After that, Tang Yitian started to order the dishes.

Zola’s restaurant was a global chain. Obviously, Tang Yitian had visited it more than once. He knew Jennifer and Tang Haoran’s taste very well, so he ordered the dishes very quickly.

In addition to the signature dishes of Zola restaurant, Tang Yitian also ordered a bottle of red wine.

“I have a few bottles of good wine in Sydney’s Zola,” Tang Yitian laughed.”But this is the Beijing shop, so I can only buy one bottle ...”

Xia ruofei said exaggeratedly,”a bottle of 80000 Yuan is just passable?” Big brother Tang, don’t scare me ...”

“Don’t pretend to be poor in front of me, ruofei!”Tang Yitian laughed.

Everyone sat down and chatted for a while before the dishes were served.

The waiter took out a bottle of wine that was worth more than 80000 Yuan. After Tang Yitian checked it, he opened the bottle with his permission.

“Come! Let’s have a drink first!” Tang Yitian raised his wine glass and said with a smile,”for our reunion in the capital!”

Ding! Ding!

Everyone clinked their glasses, took a sip of red wine, and then began to enjoy the exquisite French food.

Tang Yitian and Jennifer were both people with very high emotional intelligence, so the atmosphere during the meal was very good. They also took Feng Jing’s feelings into consideration, looking for topics of common interest from time to time, so Feng Jing’s tension was quickly eliminated.

Naturally, Xia ruofei wasn’t reserved. Besides chatting with Tang Yitian and his wife, he would also talk to Tang Haoran from time to time.

However, since Feng Jing was present, Xia ruofei did not mention anything about cultivation.

Tang Haoran seemed to have matured quite a bit. He was very respectful and affectionate towards Xia ruofei.

Tang Yitian asked,”Oh right, ruofei, why did you come to the capital this time?” You said on the phone in the morning that there was an accident? Is there anything you need my help with?”

When Feng Rao heard this, she subconsciously turned her eyes to Jennifer and her mind suddenly became active.

However, Xia ruofei shook his head at Feng Rao discreetly and smiled.””It’s nothing, big brother Tang. I can handle it myself. ”

Xia ruofei could guess what Feng Rao was thinking.

Jennifer was a world – Class star. Compared to a small star like Dong Xinyu, the difference was like the difference between an ordinary working class and a billionaire. Or rather, there was no comparison at all.

Feng Rao’s mind had been filled with the idea of a spokesperson for the past few days. Seeing that Xia ruofei and Tang Yitian were so close to each other, she naturally had the idea of asking Jennifer to be her spokesperson. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

If they could get a superstar like Jennifer to endorse them, it would be worth it even if they had to spend ten times the endorsement fee of Dong Xinyu.

It was understandable for Feng Jing to have such thoughts, but Xia ruofei could not and did not want to do so.

He believed that if he asked, Jennifer would definitely agree.

However, Xia ruofei was also very clear that Jennifer had left the entertainment industry a long time ago. Moreover, she was Tang Yitian’s wife and had successfully changed her career. How could she be allowed to do such a thing?

Even if Tang Yitian didn’t mind, Xia ruofei couldn’t do that.

That was why Xia ruofei beat Feng Jing to it and told her that it was just a small problem.

Tang Yitian saw that Xia ruofei didn’t want to talk about this topic, so he naturally didn’t continue to ask. He also vaguely knew about Xia ruofei’s magical ability, so he didn’t think that there was anything that would be difficult for Xia ruofei.

As for Feng Jing, she naturally followed Xia ruofei’s lead. Although she didn’t quite understand, she believed that Xia ruofei had his reasons for doing so, so she obediently kept her mouth shut.

“Okay. If you need any help, don’t hesitate to ask!” Tang Yitian smiled and nodded.

“Of course I won ‘t!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”by the way, brother Tang, sister – in – Law, I don’t have much to do these two days. Why don’t we go to the famous places in the capital of China?”

“Good, good!” Without waiting for Tang Yitian and his wife to speak, Tang Haoran said happily,”master, I’ve long wanted to go to the Great Wall to take a look. It’s because dad said that the Great Wall isn’t a hero!”

Xia ruofei laughed.”Haoran, it’s easy if you want to be a hero. I’ll take you to climb the Great Wall tomorrow!”

“En!” Tang Haoran nodded his head heavily.

Xia ruofei casually brushed off the issue of finding a spokesperson for the jaded skin cream. Everyone tacitly stopped talking about this topic.

Tang Yitian was also very happy to see Xia ruofei. He unconsciously drank a lot of red wine.

He stood up and said,”I’m sorry, you guys can continue chatting. I’ll go to the washroom!”
