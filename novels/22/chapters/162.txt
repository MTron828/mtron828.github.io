Chapter 163: The heated auction (1)

Xia ruofei really could not associate the sexy lady in the three – point sportswear at the gym this morning with this noble, generous, and alluring heir of the Grasso family. But that was the truth. Monica Grasso was the same sexy Caucasian woman who had chatted with Xia ruofei in the gym this morning. In fact, Monica noticed that Xia ruofei’s seat was too eye – catching as soon as she got on the stage. It was almost the center of the first row, and beside him was the world – Class billionaire, MA Xiong. When Monica saw Xia ruofei, she was also slightly surprised. However, she was in a much better state than Xia ruofei. When they had bade each other goodbye at the entrance of the gym today, Monica had seen Xia ruofei walk towards the Presidential Suite’s elevator with her own eyes. At that time, she had a feeling that Xia ruofei’s identity was not ordinary. Monica’s beautiful dark blue eyes glowed. Her gaze stopped on Xia ruofei for a moment and even gave him an elegant smile. Then, she looked around the audience. Monica’s sexy red lips opened slightly as she said,””Ladies and gentlemen! “Thank you, everyone, for taking the time out of your busy schedules to attend our Grao family’s truffle auction. Our Grao family has always attached great importance to the Chinese market. This time, we have specially placed the finale of this season’s truffle auction in China. The Grao family has been managing truffles for more than 150 years, and we have always adhered to ...” Monica spoke with fervor and assurance on the stage, exuding the innate confidence of a noble. With such an eye – catching beauty standing on stage, everyone naturally wouldn’t be impatient. Furthermore, Westerners were not used to giving long speeches. Monica briefly introduced the truffles at the auction and handed the microphone to the host. Of course, she didn’t get off the stage. Instead, she walked to a chair at the side and sat down. Monica sat down and tidied up her dress. She looked up at Xia ruofei and smiled charmingly. Xia ruofei nodded back at her. At this moment, Lu You, who was standing beside Xia ruofei, moved closer to him and asked in a low voice,””You know that Caucasian girl?” Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment. Although he had “exchanged glances” with Monica on the stage a few times, he thought that they were very secretive. He did not expect Lu You to discover him so quickly. Xia ruofei turned to look at Lu You and said,””We met at the gym today.” There was no need to hide this. He was open and honest, and he had not done anything wrong. “I’ll tell Jiang Yue when we get back!”Lu You pouted. Xia ruofei was confused. He was even stunned for a second or two before he remembered that Jiang Yue was the college student he had saved, Lu You’s best friend from the same dormitory. Xia ruofei smiled bitterly,”why did you suddenly mention Jiang Yue?” What does this have to do with her?” “You’re playing dumb,” Lu You said indifferently and then sat up straight. Xia ruofei felt as if ten thousand alpacas were running over him. This lady’s thoughts were too erratic and she was not willing to speak clearly. It was so difficult to communicate! However, it was obviously not appropriate to ask anything at this time. He could only ask after he came down. The auction had already started. In all fairness, the quality of the truffles that the Grao family had air – flown to China for auction this time was actually very good. For example, the White truffle on the stage now weighed about 300 grams. Once the transparent lid was lifted, the unique and rich fragrance of the White truffle immediately filled the air. This year, the price of white truffle was about 5000 dollars per kilogram. However, when the 300 – gram white truffle was put up for auction, the buyers were very enthusiastic. The starting price of 1000 dollars was quickly raised to 5000 dollars, which was more than three times the market price. Of course, the quality of the truffles that the Grao family had brought for auction this time was very good, so it was natural that the price would be higher. Furthermore, the Grao family’s tradition was that they would donate 5% of their profits from each auction to charity. This time, the money from the auction in China would be directly donated to the Chinese Charity Foundation. Those who were invited to such an auction were all business elites with considerable net worth. Some of them were particularly fond of truffles, and with the intention of doing charity, they didn’t particularly care about the price. In the end, the 300 – gram truffle was sold for 5888 dollars. From the final price, it could be seen that the buyer was a Chinese. A middle – aged man in his early forties, dressed in a suit and leather shoes, won the bid for the truffle and went to the staff to pay for it with a smile on his face. He had also brought a good start to the auction. The following auction went smoothly. More than a dozen truffles were sold for more than 5000 dollars. These truffles generally weighed about 300 grams. Most of the buyers were from Huaxia. Of course, some of the truly important tycoons had yet to bid. Most of the bidders were small and medium – sized enterprises or food and beverage industries. As the auction went on, the truffles taken out became heavier and heavier. White truffles above 500 grams also began to appear. Everyone’s enthusiasm was completely aroused, and some chefs of famous Western restaurants also began to participate in the auction. A white truffle like Yingying could definitely become the treasure of a Western restaurant. Although it would only last for two or three days, it could definitely bring great popularity and a loud reputation to the restaurant. The price also rose rapidly, and soon, a 580 – gram white truffle was sold for more than 10000 dollars. However, some people noticed that as a loyal fan of the White truffle, MA Xiong did not even bid once. He just sat there with a smile on his face. It was understandable that MA Xiong didn’t bid. After all, as a super – rich person, he had very high standards. The truffles on auction might be very precious in the eyes of others, but MA Xiong might not even think much of them. However, even the chef of the French restaurant on the top floor of Hengfeng Jiahua Hotel, Mark Lawrence, had no intention of participating in the bidding at all, which made everyone a little puzzled. By right, at this stage of the auction, the competition between those high – end Western restaurants should be the fiercest! Of course, many people only felt that it was a little strange. The auction atmosphere in the hall was very lively, and everyone’s attention was still more on the stage. As the auction continued, Xia ruofei did a rough calculation. The total price of the truffles should have reached about 300000 USD. Finally, the auctioneer used an extremely infectious tone and exaggeratedly said,””Ladies and gentlemen, up next is today’s grand finale! This was also the largest single white truffle collected by the Grao family in this truffle season. It weighed 1.45 kg! This is a weight that almost sets a world record!” As soon as the auctioneer said this, the crowd instantly boiled over ...
