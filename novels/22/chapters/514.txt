Chapter 515: Australia_here I come

“How can we do that!” Tang He said,”it’s my own plane anyway. It’s just a few more hours of flight. You’re my distinguished guest! I can’t neglect you!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”old man, I’m not a guest!” Don’t forget that I also have shares in the farm, and I’m a major shareholder!”

Tang He was stunned for a moment before he burst into laughter.

Xia ruofei continued,”Mr. Tang, I’m really not being polite with you. Your time is precious. There’s no need to waste it on flying. Just do as I say! You can fly directly to Australia from the United States I will take a flight from China! I’ll book the plane tickets in a while!”

Seeing Xia ruofei’s firm attitude, Tang He didn’t insist that ran ran follow Xia ruofei’s plan. He could stay in the United States for more than half a day to deal with those complicated official Affairs.

“Alright then!” Tang He said. I’ll do as you say! But you can’t refuse to take my private plane back from United States!”

“It’s a deal!” Xia ruofei laughed.

“Xiao Xia,” Tang He continued,”you don’t have to worry about the ticket booking. I’ll get Zhou Qing to settle it.”

“Alright! Then I’ll see you in Australia!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“I’ll see you in Australia!”

After making an appointment with Tang He, Xia ruofei also went downstairs. As he walked to the staff cafeteria, he sorted out his work in his mind. After all, he had to leave for a few days!

However, Xia ruofei soon realized that ever since he had Feng Jing as the General Manager, it did not matter whether he was in charge of the farm or not. He did not think that there was any work that required him to do it.

When they arrived at the canteen, Xia ruofei told Feng Jing that he would be going to the Australian farm for a few days. Feng Jing was not surprised or troubled at all. To her, the farm in Australia was Xia ruofei’s most valuable business. It was normal for Xia ruofei to go there often for business trips.

For a professional manager, the Chairman’s presence didn’t make much of a difference.

Other than the construction of the new plot of land, which required Xia ruofei’s approval, Feng Jing could carry out the rest of the work on her own and did not need Xia ruofei to stay behind.

In fact, the construction plan was not urgent. Even if it could not be finalized because Xia ruofei was not in charge, it would not delay much.

After the meal, Xia ruofei gave Ling Qingxue a call to tell her that he would be going overseas for a few days.

Even though Ling Qingxue was a little reluctant, she knew that Xia ruofei was going out for work and not for fun. Hence, she only reminded him to take care of his health and safety.

The next morning, Zhou Qing personally came to Tao Yuan farm and took Xia ruofei’s relevant identity information to go through the overseas procedures and book the plane tickets.

The next day, Lei Hu represented Xia ruofei to attend the Public Security Bureau’s award ceremony. Everything went smoothly. Under Chen Bo’s strict orders, the Public Security Bureau did not make any additional requests. Lei Hu, who had been disguised, really looked like a mascot. At the award ceremony, he accepted the prize money personally presented by Chen Bo, along with an enlarged symbolic check. Then, he was photographed by the media with Chen Bo. He did not say a word throughout the entire process.

The Public Security Bureau was very efficient. They transferred 150000 Yuan to Xia ruofei’s personal account on the same day.

In the next few days, Xia ruofei made the best use of his time and concentrated on practicing drawing independent runes. He only had one date with Ling Qingxue the day before he left the country.

Since they were about to part, the two of them were naturally reluctant to part. Xia ruofei worked even harder on the bed, causing Ling Qingxue to moan and beg for mercy.

The next day, Ling Qingxue reluctantly returned to the company to work while Xia ruofei closed his door and continued to practice drawing independent runes. There was only one flight from the three mountains to Australia every day, which took off at 9:30 p.m. So Xia ruofei still had an entire day’s time, and he naturally did not want to waste it.

Now, the practice of drawing independent runes had entered the final stage, and only the most complicated and difficult rune was not mastered.

Xia ruofei locked himself in the villa for the whole day. In the evening, he finally felt that he had completely mastered the drawing of the 17 independent runes.

However, he was not in a hurry to start carving on the Supreme – grade sheep – Fat white jade.

After all, after three days of practice, his spiritual power had been in a state of exhaustion, and he had used up a lot of energy. He had to make sure that he was in his best condition before he engraved it, so as not to waste this precious material.

He packed his things and went to the staff cafeteria for dinner.

At eighto’ clock in the evening, Zhou Qing personally brought a Mercedes – Benz to Taoyuan farm. Xia ruofei dragged his simple luggage into Zhou Qing’s car.

He had told them all the work he needed to do. He didn’t say goodbye to anyone and left the farm in a car.

The Mercedes – Benz business car sped in the direction of the airport.

Xia ruofei sat in the car and closed his eyes to rest. He was looking forward to this trip to Australia. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Although the farm was not fully owned by him, it was his first overseas business.

Besides, Xia ruofei was also concerned about one thing. That was whether Liang Qichao had really gone to work at Paradise Farm as he had wished.

He didn’t ask Tang He over the phone, nor did he try to contact Liang Qichao. After all, the answer would be revealed on this trip to Australia.

Taoyuan farm and Sanshan airport were both located in Changping County, so it only took about half an hour for the car to arrive at the airport.

Xia ruofei got out of the car and walked into the International departure hall under Zhou Qing’s lead ...
