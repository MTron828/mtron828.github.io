Chapter 212: Chapter 208 – choice (1)

“Secretary Tian, you ... Are you joking?” Manager Lu was in disbelief. “Manager Lu, would I dare to joke about elder song’s matter?” Tian Huilan asked seriously. Xiao Xia is really the Chinese medicine doctor I invited. ” Manager Lu looked at Xia ruofei and said,””But, this is also ...” “Manager Lu, don’t underestimate Xia because he’s young. His medical skills are definitely not inferior to those famous doctors in big hospitals.” Tian Huilan said,”moreover, he’s especially good at treating difficult diseases ...” At this point, Tian Huilan looked at Xia ruofei with a questioning look. Xia ruofei also understood Tian Huilan’s meaning and nodded slightly. Tian Huilan continued,”Xiao Xia had successfully cured a case of severe autism. She had also completely cured a patient with a severe cerebral hemorrhage. At that time, Hong Kong’s Hengfeng hospital had already declared that there was no hope of saving the patient.” Manager Lu was slightly surprised. He looked at Xia ruofei and said,””Doctor Xia, it’s not that I don’t trust you, but the chief’s identity ...” Xia ruofei smiled faintly and said,”I understand.” Manager Lu, Secretary Tian wouldn’t treat the chief’s life as a child’s play. You should be very clear about this. ” “I understand,” Manager Lu said,”but all of the Bureau chief’s treatment is handled by the specialist Group sent by the police. If we were to rashly use Chinese medicine for treatment, and with all due respect, Dr. Xia, you’re still so young. I’m afraid it’s not easy to talk to the specialist Group ...” When elder song had decided to come to Jiangnan Province to recuperate after returning to the country, the organization had immediately set up a special medical team, including some medical equipment that were all transported by air from Room 301. In addition, they had also sent a reinforced company to take on the task of guarding the Bureau chief. This company came from the old army that elder song had served as the commander of. They were absolutely loyal and reliable. All of elder song’s treatment plans were drawn up by a group of experts. As elder song’s Secretary, manager Lu had no say in the treatment. “Manager Lu, can’t you think of something?” Tian Huilan frowned slightly and asked,”we rushed over as quickly as possible just to do our part.” Since the effect of the previous treatment was not obvious, and her condition continued to worsen, why not try Chinese medicine treatment?” Tian Huilan was just short of saying “treating a dead horse as if it were alive”. After all, elder song was a highly respected person, and it would be too disrespectful to compare him to a dead horse. “I understand. Secretary Tian, I also understand and thank you for elder song’s sincere attitude.” Manager Lu said,”but the team leader of the specialist Group is the youngest chief physician in the entire hospital, Liang Haitao. He’s not easy to talk to ...” “The one from the Liang family?” Tian Huilan’s brows furrowed. Manager Lu nodded without saying anything. There were some big families in China that had great influence in the political and business fields. These families often had many members in important positions, and their ancestors had come from the war. Every family had a heritage that ordinary people couldn’t imagine. The Liang family of Beijing was one of the well – known families. Even Tian Huilan had heard of this young chief physician, Liang Haitao. He was only thirty years old this year, but his resume was brilliant. After he graduated from Colombia University, he joined Harvard University’s post – doc station. After working for two years, he became an Associate Chief physician and was named a chief physician last year. He was also the youngest official title holder in the history of the police force. Such a young man with a powerful family background was naturally proud. Furthermore, chief physician Liang had studied abroad for many years. He highly respected Western medicine and disdained Chinese medicine. He even publicly expressed his doubts about Chinese medicine on the internet, which was criticized by many seniors in the Chinese medicine industry. However, they didn’t take these criticisms seriously and continued to do things their own way. This was the confidence of a big family. Liang Haitao was now in charge of elder song’s specialist medical team. It was difficult to get the medical team to agree to the intervention of Chinese medicine, especially when it was done by a young Chinese medicine practitioner like Xia ruofei who did not seem very reliable. Tian Huilan was also in a difficult position. At this moment, Xia ruofei suddenly said,””Manager Lu, you should know the situation of the Bureau chief the best. If we don’t think of other ways, I don’t think I need to say what the final result will be, right? To be honest, I don’t have any confidence even if I use Traditional Chinese Medicine to treat it. I can only say that I’m trying my best. ” At this point, Xia ruofei paused and looked at manager Lu before he continued,””However, if you don’t even try, then there’s no hope at all. If you try, you might still have a chance. So ... It all depends on whether you’re manager Lu or Lu Liansheng. ” Xia ruofei’s last sentence was meaningful and obvious. It all depended on whether manager Lu was concerned about his political future or elder song’s safety. Manager Lu’s eyes showed a conflicted look. After a long time, he gritted his teeth and said,””Good! Doctor Xia, I’ll fight for it! Do your best to fight for it! Even if doctor Liang doesn’t agree, I’ll try my best to create an opportunity for you to get close to elder song!” Xia ruofei’s eyes were filled with admiration. He could tell that manager Lu really treated elder song as a family member. One must know that a high – Level official like elder song had a very strict medical plan. If manager Lu really bypassed the medical team and allowed Xia ruofei to get involved in the treatment of Chinese medicine, it was equivalent to gambling his political life. From manager Lu’s point of view, the chances of winning this gamble were very low. Xia ruofei was too young. It was impossible for a young man like him to cure late – Stage liver cancer. However, manager Lu still made a decision for that slim hope, which made Xia ruofei admire him. “However,” manager Lu continued,”we can’t skip the necessary review process. I hope you can understand this, Dr. Xia.” “I understand,” Xia ruofei nodded. Xia ruofei had once carried out a security mission for the Bureau chief. He knew very well that not just anyone could come into contact with the Bureau chief, especially someone at elder song’s level. He had strict security rules. Anyone who got close to him had to go through a strict Political Review. Even manager Lu did not dare to go against this. Tian Huilan was also prepared. She gestured to her Secretary, Xiao Xiao, who immediately took out a piece of paper from her briefcase and handed it to her. Tian Huilan took it and passed it to manager Lu.”Manager Lu, this is Xiao Xia’s basic condition.” Manager Lu nodded and took the piece of paper. He glanced at it and handed it to the major who had gone to the airport to pick up the person.”Xu Wu, go and verify the information immediately. Be quick!” “Yes!” The major took the piece of paper and quickly returned to the courtyard. “Secretary Tian, let’s go in!” Manager Lu said to Tian Huilan. The floor elder song is on has already been completely controlled, and he’s still unconscious, so I’m afraid you can’t visit him for now. ” “Alright, thank you for the trouble, manager Lu,” Tian Huilan nodded. Manager Lu led Tian Huilan and the other two into the small courtyard. After bringing them to a room, manager Lu said,””Please have a seat, I’ll go talk to team leader Liang ...”FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com
