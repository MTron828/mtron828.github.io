Chapter 3426: Another battle with the star beasts (2)

Translator: 549690339

In addition, while Xia ruofei was dodging, he could also find time to attack the Star Beast with his bare hands. His heavy punches were hard for the Star Beast to withstand. When he used his full strength to punch the Star Beast with his vital Qi, it would often cause the Star Beast’s internal organs to shake greatly, leaving behind internal injuries that were even more serious than external injuries.

During the battle, Xia ruofei felt more and more at ease.

Regardless of whether it was the noble Sword or the floating duckweed steps, he was becoming more and more proficient in them.

Very quickly, star beasts suffered fatal injuries and fell to the ground. As more and more star beasts lost their combat power or even died on the spot, the pressure on Xia ruofei decreased. The power of the gentleman sword technique was more fully displayed.

The star beasts fell down one by one. The speed of the flying swords became faster and faster, leaving behind deadly afterimages in the air.

About half an hour later, there were no longer any star beasts standing in the square.

Most of the star beasts had already died, and there were still two or three star beasts that were on the verge of death, having completely lost their fighting strength.

Xia ruofei waved his hand and the blue travel immortal sword made a sharp whistling sound as it cut through the necks of these star beasts, freeing them completely.

Xia ruofei let out a long sigh of relief. Looking at the corpses of the star beasts on the ground, he couldn’t help but sigh.

On the second level of the Tower of Trials, he had to struggle to deal with one star Beast. In the end, he had to use the trap and kill array to complete the task of killing 100 intermediate star beasts. Especially when he encountered a high – Level astral beast at the end. Without the help of the formation, Xia ruofei would not even be able to escape. He would not be able to cause any harm to the high – Level astral beast.

But now, even if a high – Level astral beast appeared, Xia ruofei had the confidence to fight it. Even if he couldn’t win, he could at least stall it for a while. As for escaping, it would be even easier.

This was the most direct comparison of Xia ruofei’s improvement in strength after breaking through to the intermediate stage of the Golden core realm.

He felt a surge of confidence. In the world of cultivation, strength spoke for itself. The stronger one was, the stronger one’s ability to control one’s own fate would naturally be.

With a thought, Xia ruofei moved Ling Qingxue out of the spirit map.

Ling Qingxue’s vision blurred and she was back in the square between the two halls. The first thing she saw was the corpses of the astral beasts on the ground and Xia ruofei, who was completely unscathed. Not even his clothes were stained with blood.

“RUO Fei, you’ve dealt with all these star beasts?” Ling Qingxue asked, her face filled with joy.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””In the second level of the Tower of Trials, I had to rely on the array to complete the task. But this time, I was able to kill more than 20 star beasts with my own strength. It seems that after breaking through, my strength has indeed increased a lot!”

“That’s a must!” Ling Qingxue said happily,”! remember that in the cultivation world, the only late – Stage golden core cultivator is Chen Xuan’s father, Chen Nanfeng, right? There aren’t many middle – Stage golden core cultivators, but you’ve already reached the top of the pyramid of the cultivation world!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”That’s because the cultivation environment on earth is deteriorating. No one has any cultivation resources.” There’s nothing to be proud of for being the king in that poor cultivation environment!”

“No matter what, you’re still one of the top experts in the world. You shouldn’t be proud of that! Aren’t you setting too high a standard for yourself?” Ling Qingxue said with a smile.

“I mean, our vision should not be limited to the cultivation world on earth.” Xia ruofei said,”the intermediate stage of the Golden core realm might be considered very powerful in the cultivation world on earth. However, compared to those senior Almighty experts, we are just at the beginning stage! For example, I can’t imagine what kind of cultivation base is needed to build this trial Pagoda … In addition, this Mystic realm on the moon makes me more certain that the power of the cultivation world is not limited to earth. Don’t forget that hundreds of years ago, the seniors above the nascent Soul Stage disappeared one after another. Where did they go?”

Ling Qingxue nodded her head thoughtfully and said,'”‘What you said makes sense! I think that this Mystic realm on the moon might be related to the departure of those seniors!”

“That’s why I have to do my best to reach the highest level of the tower. Maybe when I get there, I’ll be able to find out why those seniors left one after another.” Xia ruofei said,”let’s not talk about this anymore. Let’s finish the seventh level of the trial Pagoda first!”

“En!”

“Same old rules. Once there’s an emergency, don’t resist. I’ll protect you first, and then I can deal with it without any distractions.” Xia ruofei said.

“No problem!” Ling Qingxue said calmly.

The two of them stepped over the corpses of these star beasts and continued to walk towards the second Palace.

The astral beasts had rushed out of this Palace just now, so the two of them didn’t dare to let their guard down and were always on high alert.

Xia ruofei was even prepared to keep Ling Qingxue in the mountain and sea realm at any time.

The two of them walked into the palace. It was also a tall Palace door. After entering, they felt that the palace was quiet, so quiet that it made them feel a little uneasy.

Xia ruofei protected Ling Qingxue behind him and slowly turned his head to observe the situation around him.

The 100 – meter – tall Palace was supported by 16 huge bluestone pillars, and it looked magnificent.

The floor of the hall was also paved with bluestone, making the entire Hall look very ancient and simple.

At this moment, Xia ruofei heard the sound of hurried footsteps. Ling Qingxue also heard the sound immediately. The two of them leaned back against each other and carefully observed the situation in front of them and to their sides.

This Hall was very spacious and was so high up, so when the sound of footsteps rang out, they could hear a very clear echo.

After a few breaths, Xia ruofei finally saw who it was. His eyes narrowed and his face turned serious.

This was a high – Level astral beast!

Without another word, Xia ruofei immediately put Ling Qingxue into the spirit map space. At the same time, he took out the materials for the trap and kill array. With a wave of his hand, he threw the materials accurately in their respective positions. Then, he threw out the origin crystals. In just a few breaths, Xia ruofei’s trap and kill array was ready.

The high – Level astral beast seemed to have smelled the astral beast blood on Xia ruofei’s body. Its Bell – like eyes suddenly shot out a ray of light. It did not even try to hide its murderous intent.

Xia ruofei was not in a hurry to activate the array. Instead, he took out the blue immortal sword and the qushuang flying sword. He stood in front of the trap and kill array and stared at the advanced star Beast that was approaching step by step.

The high – Level astral beast did not stop. There was even a trace of disdain in his eyes, as if he was saying that the opponent in front of him was too weak, and there was no sense of accomplishment in winning against him!

Of course, this high – Level astral beast did not use its full speed. Instead, it stared at Xia ruofei and walked towards him step by step.

Xia ruofei silently used his sword technique. The flying sword of the qushuang flew out first, followed by the blue immortal sword. The two flying swords attacked the high – Level Star Beast.

After a series of metal clanging sounds, two shallow white marks were left on the neck of the high – Level astral beast. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

High level astral beasts were indeed much more difficult to deal with than mid level astral beasts. Just their defensive capabilities alone were much stronger.

It let out an angry roar and suddenly sped up, pouncing in Xia ruofei’s direction.

Xia ruofei dodged it calmly and at the same time, he threw a heavy punch at the high – Level astral beast.

The high – Level astral beast was at the point where it had used up all its energy and could not Dodge in time. It could only watch as Xia ruofei’s fist grew bigger in its field of vision. Then, there was a violent vibration. Although the head of the high – Level astral beast was very hard, it could not withstand the full – Power attack of an intermediate golden core cultivator. The high – Level astral beast groaned and looked dejected..
