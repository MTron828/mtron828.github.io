Chapter 703: Time for the college entrance examination (3)

After a semester of high school life, Lin Qiao had become more and more beautiful, and her whole body was filled with the aura of youth.

Every time she saw Xia ruofei, Lin Qiao would be very happy. She liked to stick to Xia ruofei.

Hu Zi had sacrificed himself to save him. Xia ruofei treated Lin Qiao like his own sister and naturally doted on her.

Soon, it was June 6th. Lin Qiao was going to take the college entrance examination the next day.

Xia ruofei naturally came to Lin Qiao’s house that day.

There were no classes at school two days ago, so it was basically useless to ask everyone to go home and rest.

Xia ruofei arrived at Hu Zi’s mother’s house in the afternoon. He brought the vegetables, fruits, chicken, duck, and fish to the kitchen with great familiarity.

Hu Zi’s mother said,”ruofei!” You’ve taken too much. We haven’t even finished the ones you brought last time!”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Auntie, if you haven’t finished it, throw it away. It’ll make it fresher. Qiao’ er’s college entrance examination is a big event in her life. She must get more nutrition!”

“You can’t throw it!” Hu Zi’s mother said,”I heard that these vegetables of yours are all sold for tens of Yuan per 500 grams. They’re many times more expensive than the average vegetable!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”that’s the price for selling to the outside world. How can the actual cost be so high?” I grew it myself, so it doesn’t cost much!”

“You ... You can’t waste it!” Hu ‘Zi’s mother said,”ruofei, don’t give too many gifts in the future. If you sell them, you’ll make a lot of money!”

“I know, Auntie!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

......

Hu Zi’s mother could tell that Xia ruofei was being perfunctory. She knew that no matter what she said, Xia ruofei would still do things his own way. She could only smile bitterly and shake her head.

At this moment, there was a knock on the door. Lin Qiao came back from outside.

When she saw Xia ruofei, she immediately called out happily,””Brother ruofei!”

Then, she kicked off her shoes and ran over barefooted.

“The college entrance examination is tomorrow. Why are you still going out to do crazy things today?” Xia ruofei asked affectionately.

“Where?” Lin Qiao pouted and said,”I went to familiarize myself with the examination hall this afternoon. The school organized us to go!”

“This is more like it!” Xia ruofei asked,”how is it? Do you have confidence in your college entrance exam tomorrow?”

“There must be! I’ve worked hard for so many years, it’s all about this!” Lin Qiao said with a smile.

“And don’t feel any pressure.” Xia ruofei said gently,”the admission rate for the college entrance examination is very high now. It’s better to travel light.”

“En!” Lin Qiao smiled sweetly and held Xia ruofei’s arm affectionately. She looked up and asked,”brother ruofei, can you come and send me to the exam venue tomorrow?”

At this moment, Hu Zi’s mother came out with a dish. After hearing Lin Qiao’s words, she quickly said,””Qiao’ er, why are you so insensible? Your exam is at 9 o’ clock, and your brother ruofei lives in the suburbs. Do you want him to wake up at 5 or 6 O’ clock and run to the city?”

Xia ruofei quickly said,”aunty!” Even if Qiao’ er didn’t say so, I was prepared to send her off!”

“No, no, no! Wasn’t it just an exam? Why did it have to be so troublesome? I’ll just send her there. ” Hu Zi’s mother said.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Auntie, I have a car. It’s very convenient!” Besides, I’ll be there personally to cheer Qiao’ er on, so maybe she’ll be able to perform better!”

“I’ll definitely do a great job!” Lin Qiao quickly said.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”aunty, did you hear that?” This is related to Qiao’ er’s college entrance examination results. What’s the big deal for me to drive over? This matter is settled!”

Hu Zi’s mother’s mouth moved. She wanted to object, but Xia ruofei quickly said,””Auntie, let’s not dwell on this matter. I’m a little hungry. Can we start eating?”

“Oh! It’ll be ready soon!” Hu ‘er’s mother quickly said before quickly returning to the kitchen.

Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao looked at each other and smiled.

After dinner, Xia ruofei sat for a while before leaving. Lin Qiao had to take the college entrance examination tomorrow and needed to rest early.

……

The next morning, Xia ruofei arrived at Lin Qiao’s house at Seveno’ clock sharp with the breakfast he had bought on the way.

After having breakfast with the mother and daughter, Lin Qiao rested for a while and was ready to set off.

Her exam venue was Chengnan middle school, which was quite far from here. It would take about 30 minutes to drive. Considering that there would be many parents sending their children to the college entrance examination today, which might cause traffic jams, Xia ruofei decided to leave early.

Hu Zi’s mother was also afraid of putting pressure on Lin Qiao, so she didn’t nag her as she usually did. She only said,”do well in the exam and don’t be stressed.”

Xia ruofei drove the Knight XV and drove Lin Qiao to the examination hall of Chengnan high school.

The two of them arrived at the vicinity of Chengnan high school a little after eighto’ clock.

There were more and more cars on the road. Xia ruofei simply found a parking space and parked the car by the side of the road. Then, the two of them walked to Cheng Nan high school.

When they got out of the car, Xia ruofei carefully reminded Lin Qiao to check if she had brought her pen and exam admission ticket.

At the entrance of Chengnan high school, the two of them stood and chatted for a while before the examination hall opened and the candidates could enter.

“Brother ruofei, I’m going in!” Lin Qiao said with a relaxed expression.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”yes!” Don’t feel any pressure, just go ahead and take the exam. I’ll be waiting for you at the door!”

Lin Qiao smiled sweetly, nodded, and was about to walk into the exam hall.

“Qiao’ er, wait!” Xia ruofei called out.

He walked forward and took out a drink bottle, which was half – filled with Chinese medicine.

Xia ruofei passed the bottle to Lin Qiao and said,””Drink this before the exam starts later!”

“Brother ruofei, you can’t drink water before the exam. What if you need to use the toilet during the exam?” Lin Qiao blushed.

Xia ruofei laughed,”just a little, it’s okay!” Remember this! You must drink it all in one go before the exam, understand?”

“What kind of godly medicine is this?” Lin Qiao asked with a smile.

“Don’t ask so much, you’ll know when the time comes!” Xia ruofei said,”hurry into the exam hall! Remember my words, drink before the exam!”

“yessir!”Lin Qiao said cheekily. She took the Chinese medicine that Xia ruofei gave her and walked quickly to the exam hall. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Xia ruofei looked at Lin Qiao’s back and muttered to himself,””Qiao’ er, this is all I can do for you. You still have to rely on yourself for the exam ...”
